The parameter $\\gamma$ is real, so $\\gamma^2 \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the term $\\kappa_c \\kappa_r$ is strictly positive. The term $\\kappa_c \\kappa_r + \\gamma^2$ is also strictly positive.\nThis implies that the numerator, $-(\\kappa_c \\kappa_r + \\gamma^2)$, is strictly negative.\nConsequently, the Gaussian curvature $K(u,v)$ is negative for all points $(u,v)$ on the surface:\n$$\nK(u,v)  0\n$$\nA point on a surface where the Gaussian curvature is negative is known as a hyperbolic point. The local geometry around a hyperbolic point resembles a saddle shape. This means the surface curves in opposite directions along two perpendicular axes (the principal directions). For the given surface, it is concave down along a direction related to the circumferential axis $u$ (since $z_{uu} = -\\kappa_c  0$) and concave up along a direction related to the radial axis $v$ (since $z_{vv} = \\kappa_r  0$).\n\nIn the context of heart valve mechanics and leaflet kinematics, a region with negative Gaussian curvature has significant functional implications:\n1.  **Flexibility and Shape-Changing Ability**: Surfaces with negative Gaussian curvature have very low bending energy, meaning they can be deformed and change their curvature with minimal energy input. This property is crucial for the aortic valve leaflet, which must undergo large, rapid deformations during the cardiac cycle, transitioning smoothly between an open and a closed state.\n2.  **Avoidance of Wrinkling and Stress Concentration**: The saddle morphology allows the leaflet to adapt its shape to the changing blood flow and pressure without developing sharp folds or wrinkles, which could lead to high stress concentrations and material fatigue over millions of cycles. The commissural regions, in particular, experience complex deformations as the leaflets coapt. A negative Gaussian curvature facilitates this complex motion.\n3.  **Efficient Coaptation**: The specific saddle shape contributes to a stable and efficient seal when the valve is closed. The curvature in the radial direction helps the leaflet belly press against the adjacent leaflets, while the circumferential curvature helps to distribute the load along the coaptation line.\n\nIn summary, the negative Gaussian curvature found in this model reflects a fundamental design principle of heart valve leaflets, endowing them with the flexibility and mechanical resilience required for their demanding and long-term function.",

Assume the leaflet mid-surface is a thin continuum with deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$, and the Jacobian determinant $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$ describes local volumetric change. Two modeling assumptions are compared: (i) constant thickness (violating incompressibility), and (ii) enforcing incompressibility by $J=1$ at all times via thickness stretch. The goal is to quantify how these assumptions impact the predicted coaptation height over a prescribed pressure waveform.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Newtonian mechanics and small-deflection Euler–Bernoulli beam theory for a clamped cantilever under a uniform transverse load. For a uniform load per unit length $q(t)$ on a beam of length $L$, elastic modulus $E$, and second moment of area $I$, the tip slope $\\theta(t)$ and tip deflection $\\delta(t)$ scale with $q(t)$, $L$, $E$, and $I$ by well-tested relations. For a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $h(t)$, the second moment of area is $I(t) = b h(t)^3/12$.\n- Kinematics of incompressibility: for the leaflet mid-surface areal stretch $\\Lambda(t)$ relative to reference configuration, incompressibility imposes $J(t) = \\det(\\mathbf{F}) = \\Lambda(t) \\lambda_3(t) = 1$, where $\\lambda_3(t)$ is the thickness-direction stretch. If the reference thickness is $h_0$, the current thickness is $h(t) = \\lambda_3(t) h_0 = h_0 / \\Lambda(t)$ under $J=1$.\n- Constitutive simplification for mid-surface distensibility: the areal stretch is proportional to the instantaneous pressure, $\\Lambda(t) = 1 + \\beta P(t)$, with $\\beta$ a small positive constant (units of $\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$), representing the effective in-plane compliance of the collagenous network under physiological loading.\n\nAssume a distributed transverse load per unit length $q(t) = P(t) b$, where $P(t)$ is the transvalvular pressure and $b$ is the leaflet width.

The forces exerted by the fluid are not constant; they are dynamic and time-varying, which has profound implications for the stresses experienced by the tissue. This problem contrasts the wall shear stress generated by a realistic pulsatile flow with that from a simplified steady flow, highlighting the crucial role of fluid inertia and temporal acceleration. This comparison will deepen your understanding of the hemodynamic forces that drive leaflet motion and contribute to mechanobiological responses over the valve's lifespan .",

            "problem": "You are asked to compare pulsatile and steady laminar flow through an identical heart valve orifice area by evaluating the role of temporal acceleration $\\partial_t \\mathbf{u}$ in the momentum balance and quantifying differences in shear stress on the leaflet surface, modeled as one wall of a planar slit of height $h$ and width $w$. Consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid of density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and assume unidirectional flow with velocity $u(y,t)$ in the axial direction $x$, varying only across the gap coordinate $y \\in [0,h]$. The orifice area is $A = w h$. The governing axial momentum equation for the slit, neglecting convective inertia and body forces, is\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2},\n$$\nwith no-slip boundary conditions $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(h,t) = 0$. The wall shear stress on the leaflet surface (at $y=0$) is defined by\n$$\n\\tau_w(t) = \\mu \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0}.\n$$\nYou will compare two cases for each parameter set: (i) a steady flow with constant volumetric flow rate $Q_s$ through the orifice area $A$, and (ii) a pulsatile flow driven by a purely harmonic pressure gradient that yields a volumetric flow rate of amplitude $Q_0$ at angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second). In the pulsatile case, the temporal acceleration $\\rho \\,\\partial_t u$ must be retained. In the steady case, $\\partial_t u = 0$ and the axial pressure gradient is constant.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the governing equation and boundary conditions stated above, derive an expression for the steady wall shear stress $\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}}$ in terms of $\\mu$, $h$, $w$, and $Q_s$.\n2. For the pulsatile case, assume a harmonic pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{P e^{i \\omega t}\\}$ with complex amplitude $P \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and seek a harmonic solution $u(y,t) = \\operatorname{Re}\\{U(y) e^{i \\omega t}\\}$ where $U(y)$ is a complex spatial mode.

Show how the complex amplitude of volumetric flow rate $\\hat{Q}$ per width $w$ depends linearly on $U(y)$, and use this to relate the magnitude of $\\hat{Q}$ to the magnitude of the unknown forcing amplitude $P$. Then eliminate $P$ to express the peak (amplitude) of the wall shear stress $|\\hat{\\tau}_w|$ directly in terms of $\\rho$, $\\mu$, $h$, $w$, $\\omega$, and a specified target flow amplitude $Q_0$.\n3.

Angular frequency $\\omega$ must be in radians per second. Report wall shear stresses and their difference in Pascals, and the ratio as a dimensionless float.\n\nTest suite (each case uses identical orifice area between steady and pulsatile comparisons; the slit height $h$ and width $w$ define the area $A = w h$ used consistently within that case):\n- Case 1 (baseline physiological): $\\rho = 1060$, $\\mu = 0.0035$, $h = 0.002$, $w = 0.020$, $Q_s = 0.00006$, $\\omega = 4\\pi$, $Q_0 = 0.00006$.\n- Case 2 (low frequency, quasi-steady regime): $\\rho = 1060$, $\\mu = 0.0035$, $h = 0.002$, $w = 0.020$, $Q_s = 0.00006$, $\\omega = 0.4\\pi$, $Q_0 = 0.00006$.\n- Case 3 (high frequency, inertia-dominated): $\\rho = 1060$, $\\mu = 0.0035$, $h = 0.002$, $w = 0.020$, $Q_s = 0.00006$, $\\omega = 20\\pi$, $Q_0 = 0.00006$.\n- Case 4 (narrower slit, same width): $\\rho = 1060$, $\\mu = 0.0035$, $h = 0.0005$, $w = 0.020$, $Q_s = 0.00006$, $\\omega = 4\\pi$, $Q_0 = 0.00006$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each case’s result is itself a list of four floats in the order $\\left[\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}},\\,|\\hat{\\tau}_w|,\\,\\Delta \\tau_w,\\,R\\right]$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in fluid mechanics (oscillatory flow in a channel, or Womersley flow) applied to a biomechanical context. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and physical parameters are clearly defined and consistent. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement. First, the steady-state wall shear stress is derived. Second, the peak wall shear stress for the pulsatile case is derived. Finally, these derived expressions are summarized for implementation.\n\n### Part 1: Steady Flow Analysis\n\nFor steady, unidirectional, fully developed laminar flow, the temporal acceleration term in the governing equation is zero, $\\partial u / \\partial t = 0$. The governing axial momentum equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the velocity profile $u(y)$:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \\frac{d p}{d x}\n$$\nHere, the axial pressure gradient, $\\frac{d p}{d x}$, is a constant, which we will denote as $P'$. Integrating this equation twice with respect to the gap coordinate $y$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{P'}{\\mu} y + C_1\n$$\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{P'}{2\\mu} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions, $u(0) = 0$ and $u(h) = 0$.\nApplying $u(0)=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = 0 + 0 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nApplying $u(h)=0$:\n$$\nu(h) = \\frac{P'}{2\\mu} h^2 + C_1 h = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{P'h}{2\\mu}\n$$\nSubstituting these constants back into the velocity profile expression gives the well-known parabolic profile for plane Poiseuille flow:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{P'}{2\\mu}(y^2 - hy)\n$$\nTo relate the pressure gradient $P'$ to the given steady volumetric flow rate $Q_s$, we integrate the velocity profile over the orifice area $A = wh$:\n$$\nQ_s = \\int_A u \\,dA = w \\int_0^h u(y) \\,dy = w \\int_0^h \\frac{P'}{2\\mu}(y^2 - hy) \\,dy\n$$\n$$\nQ_s = \\frac{w P'}{2\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{hy^2}{2} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{w P'}{2\\mu} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\frac{h^3}{2} \\right) = -\\frac{w h^3 P'}{12\\mu}\n$$\nFrom this, we express the pressure gradient in terms of the flow rate:\n$$\nP' = -\\frac{12 \\mu Q_s}{w h^3}\n$$\nThe wall shear stress on the leaflet surface at $y=0$ is defined as $\\tau_w = \\mu \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0}$. For the steady case:\n$$\n\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}} = \\mu \\left.\\frac{du}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = \\mu \\left[ \\frac{P'}{\\mu}y - \\frac{P'h}{2\\mu} \\right]_{y=0} = -\\frac{P'h}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P'$ gives the final result for the steady wall shear stress:\n$$\n\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}} = -\\frac{h}{2} \\left( -\\frac{12 \\mu Q_s}{w h^3} \\right) = \\frac{6 \\mu Q_s}{w h^2}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Pulsatile Flow Analysis\n\nFor the pulsatile case, we assume a harmonic pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{P e^{i \\omega t}\\}$ and seek a velocity solution of the form $u(y,t) = \\operatorname{Re}\\{U(y) e^{i \\omega t}\\}$, where $U(y)$ is the complex spatial amplitude of the velocity. Substituting these into the full governing equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\operatorname{Re}\\{U(y) e^{i \\omega t}\\}) = -\\operatorname{Re}\\{P e^{i \\omega t}\\} + \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}(\\operatorname{Re}\\{U(y) e^{i \\omega t}\\})\n$$\nThis leads to an ODE for the complex amplitude $U(y)$:\n$$\n\\rho (i \\omega U) = -P + \\mu \\frac{d^2 U}{d y^2}\n$$\nRearranging gives a standard second-order linear non-homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 U}{d y^2} - \\frac{i \\omega \\rho}{\\mu} U = -\\frac{P}{\\mu}\n$$\nUsing the kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$ and the complex wavenumber $\\lambda = (1+i)\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\nu)}$ (which satisfies $\\lambda^2 = i\\omega/\\nu$), the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 U}{d y^2} - \\lambda^2 U = -\\frac{P}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of a particular solution $U_p$ and a homogeneous solution $U_h$. A constant particular solution is $U_p = P/(\\mu\\lambda^2)$. The homogeneous solution is $U_h = C_1 e^{\\lambda y} + C_2 e^{-\\lambda y}$. For better handling of boundary conditions, it is convenient to use a form symmetric about the channel centerline $y=h/2$:\n$$\nU(y) = \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(y - h/2))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right)\n$$\nThis form satisfies the ODE and the no-slip boundary conditions $U(0)=0$ and $U(h)=0$.\n\nThe complex amplitude of the wall shear stress, $\\hat{\\tau}_w$, is found by differentiating $U(y)$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_w = \\mu \\left.\\frac{dU}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = \\mu \\left[ \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( -\\frac{\\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda(y-h/2))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right) \\right]_{y=0}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_w = \\frac{P}{\\lambda} \\left( -\\frac{\\sinh(-\\lambda h/2)}{\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right) = \\frac{P}{\\lambda} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we relate the complex pressure gradient amplitude $P$ to the complex volumetric flow rate amplitude $\\hat{Q}$.\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = w \\int_0^h U(y) \\,dy = w \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\int_0^h \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(y - h/2))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right) \\,dy\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = w \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left[ y - \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda(y - h/2)) / \\lambda}{\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right]_0^h = w \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( h - \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda h/2) - \\sinh(-\\lambda h/2)}{\\lambda\\cosh(\\lambda h/2)} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = w \\frac{P}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( h - \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nNow we eliminate $P$ to relate $\\hat{\\tau}_w$ to $\\hat{Q}$. From the shear stress expression, $P = \\hat{\\tau}_w \\lambda \\coth(\\lambda h/2)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\hat{Q}$:\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = w \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w \\lambda \\coth(\\lambda h/2)}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( h - \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = \\frac{w \\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu \\lambda} \\left( h \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) - \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{w \\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu \\lambda^2} \\left( \\lambda h \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) - 2 \\right)\n$$\nRecalling $\\mu\\lambda^2 = i\\omega\\rho$, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = \\frac{w \\hat{\\tau}_w}{i \\omega \\rho} \\left( \\lambda h \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) - 2 \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\tau}_w$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_w = \\frac{i \\omega \\rho \\hat{Q}}{w} \\frac{1}{\\lambda h \\coth(\\lambda h/2) - 2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the peak flow rate amplitude $Q_0 = |\\hat{Q}|$. We require the peak wall shear stress, which is the magnitude of its complex amplitude, $|\\hat{\\tau}_w|$:\n$$\n|\\hat{\\tau}_w| = \\left| \\frac{i \\omega \\rho \\hat{Q}}{w} \\frac{1}{\\lambda h \\coth(\\lambda h/2) - 2} \\right| = \\frac{\\omega \\rho |\\hat{Q}|}{w} \\frac{1}{|\\lambda h \\coth(\\lambda h/2) - 2|}\n$$\n$$\n|\\hat{\\tau}_w| = \\frac{\\omega \\rho Q_0}{w \\left| \\lambda h \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) - 2 \\right|}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Summary of Formulae for Implementation\n\nThe quantities to be computed for each parameter set are:\n1.  **Steady wall shear stress**:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}} = \\frac{6 \\mu Q_s}{w h^2}\n    $$\n2.  **Pulsatile peak wall shear stress**:\n    $$\n    |\\hat{\\tau}_w| = \\frac{\\omega \\rho Q_0}{w \\left| \\lambda h \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}\\right) - 2 \\right|}\n    $$\n    where $\\rho$ is density, $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$ is kinematic viscosity, $\\omega$ is angular frequency, $h$ is slit height, $w$ is slit width, $Q_0$ is the flow rate amplitude, and $\\lambda$ is the complex wavenumber:\n    $$\n    \\lambda = (1+i)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}\n    $$\n3.  **Difference in wall shear stress**:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\tau_w = |\\hat{\\tau}_w| - \\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}}\n    $$\n4.  **Ratio of wall shear stresses**:\n    $$\n    R = \\frac{|\\hat{\\tau}_w|}{\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{steady}}}\n    $$\nThese formulae will be implemented in the provided Python environment using the given test cases.",
