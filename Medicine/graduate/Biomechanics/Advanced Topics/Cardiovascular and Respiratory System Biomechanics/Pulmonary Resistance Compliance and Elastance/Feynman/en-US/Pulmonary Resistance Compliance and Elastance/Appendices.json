This practice demonstrates how to extract the fundamental parameters of resistance ($R$) and elastance ($E$) from pressure waveforms commonly observed during volume-controlled mechanical ventilation.

            "problem": "Consider the single-compartment lung model that relates measured airway pressure to flow and volume during mechanical ventilation. The model is defined by the constitutive relationship $P_{aw}(t) = P_0 + R \\, Q(t) + E \\, V(t)$, where $P_{aw}(t)$ is the airway pressure in $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$, $P_0$ is the baseline pressure due to Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) in $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$, $R$ is pulmonary resistance in $\\mathrm{cmH_2O \\cdot s \\cdot L^{-1}}$, $Q(t)$ is inspiratory flow in $\\mathrm{L/s}$, $E$ is elastance in $\\mathrm{cmH_2O \\cdot L^{-1}}$, and $V(t)$ is lung volume above end-expiratory level in $\\mathrm{L}$. Compliance $C$ is the reciprocal of elastance, so $C = 1/E$ in $\\mathrm{L \\cdot cmH_2O^{-1}}$. Under volume-controlled ventilation with constant inspiratory flow $Q(t) = F$ during inspiration and an end-inspiratory hold, the inspiratory volume satisfies $V(t) = \\int_0^t Q(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = F \\, t$ for $t \\in [0, T_{insp}]$, where the inspiratory time is $T_{insp} = V_T / F$ and $V_T$ is tidal volume. Just before the end-inspiratory hold, the peak airway pressure $P_{peak}$ occurs while $Q(t) = F$, and during the plateau, the flow is zero so the plateau pressure $P_{plat}$ reflects only the elastic component. Derive expressions for $R$ and $E$ using measured $P_{peak}$, $P_{plat}$, $V_T$, $F$, and $P_0$, then assess the model fit by computing residuals between measured airway pressure samples and the model-predicted airway pressure at the corresponding times. The residual at time $t_i$ is $r_i = P_{meas}(t_i) - P_{model}(t_i)$, where $P_{model}(t)$ is given by the single-compartment model using the derived $R$ and $E$, with $Q(t) = F$ and $V(t) = F t$ for $t \\le T_{insp}$, and $Q(t) = 0$, $V(t) = V_T$ for $t > T_{insp}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of respiratory mechanics, mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for analysis. We will proceed with the derivation of the required parameters and the statistical analysis of the model fit.\n\nThe single-compartment model of the respiratory system relates airway pressure, $P_{aw}(t)$, to flow, $Q(t)$, and volume, $V(t)$, via the linear ordinary differential equation known as the equation of motion:\n$$P_{aw}(t) = P_0 + R \\, Q(t) + E \\, V(t)$$\nwhere $P_0$ is the Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), $R$ is the airway resistance, and $E$ is the elastance of the respiratory system.\n\nThe problem specifies a volume-controlled ventilation mode with a constant inspiratory flow, $F$. During the inspiratory phase, which lasts for an inspiratory time $T_{insp}$, the flow is $Q(t) = F$ and the volume increases linearly with time: $V(t) = \\int_0^t Q(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = F \\cdot t$. Inspiration ends when the delivered volume equals the tidal volume, $V_T$. Thus, $T_{insp} = V_T / F$.\n\nThe problem requires deriving expressions for resistance $R$ and elastance $E$ from specific pressure measurements taken during the respiratory cycle.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of Elastance ($E$)**\n\nThe plateau pressure, $P_{plat}$, is measured during an end-inspiratory hold. During this maneuver, the flow into the lungs is zero, $Q(t) = 0$, and the lung volume is held constant at the tidal volume, $V(t) = V_T$. Substituting these conditions into the equation of motion:\n$$P_{plat} = P_0 + R \\cdot (0) + E \\cdot V_T$$\n$$P_{plat} = P_0 + E V_T$$\nThis equation isolates the elastic component of pressure. We can rearrange it to solve for elastance, $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{P_{plat} - P_0}{V_T}$$\nThis expression is valid provided $V_T \\neq 0$, a condition inherent to ventilation.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of Resistance ($R$)**\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure, $P_{peak}$, is the maximum pressure reached during inspiration. It occurs just at the end of the inspiratory phase, at time $t = T_{insp}$. At this instant, the flow is still at its constant value, $Q(T_{insp}) = F$, and the volume has reached the full tidal volume, $V(T_{insp}) = V_T$. Substituting these conditions into the equation of motion:\n$$P_{peak} = P_0 + R \\cdot F + E \\cdot V_T$$\nWe can see that the term $P_0 + E V_T$ is equal to $P_{plat}$ from our previous derivation. Substituting this into the equation for $P_{peak}$:\n$$P_{peak} = R \\cdot F + P_{plat}$$\nThis equation shows that the difference between peak and plateau pressure is due to the resistive pressure drop across the airways. We can now rearrange this to solve for resistance, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{P_{peak} - P_{plat}}{F}$$\nThis expression is valid provided $F \\neq 0$, a condition of constant flow ventilation.\n\n**Step 3: Model Prediction and Residual Analysis**\n\nWith the derived parameters $R$ and $E$, we can formulate the model-predicted airway pressure, $P_{model}(t)$, for any time $t$ during the specified ventilatory cycle.\n\nFor the inspiratory phase ($t_i \\le T_{insp}$):\n- $Q(t_i) = F$\n- $V(t_i) = F \\cdot t_i$\n- $P_{model}(t_i) = P_0 + R F + E F t_i$\n\nFor the end-inspiratory hold phase ($t_i > T_{insp}$):\n- $Q(t_i) = 0$\n- $V(t_i) = V_T$\n- $P_{model}(t_i) = P_0 + E V_T = P_{plat}$\n\nThe residual at each time point $t_i$ is the difference between the measured pressure $P_{meas}(t_i)$ and the model-predicted pressure $P_{model}(t_i)$:\n$$r_i = P_{meas}(t_i) - P_{model}(t_i)$$\nFrom the set of $N$ residuals, we compute the following statistics:\n1.  **Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)**: A measure of the magnitude of the errors.\n    $$\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N r_i^2}$$\n2.  **Mean Residual**: A measure of the average bias of the model.\n    $$\\text{mean\\_residual} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N r_i$$\n3.  **Maximum Absolute Residual**: The largest deviation at any single point.\n    $$\\text{max\\_abs\\_residual} = \\max_{i} |r_i|$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case involves:\n1.  Calculate $T_{insp} = V_T / F$.\n2.  Calculate $E$ and $R$ using the derived formulas.\n3.  For each pair of $(t_i, P_{meas}(t_i))$:\n    a. Determine if $t_i \\le T_{insp}$ or $t_i > T_{insp}$.\n    b. Calculate $P_{model}(t_i)$ using the appropriate formula.\n    c. Compute and store the residual $r_i$.\n4.  Calculate the RMSE, mean residual, and maximum absolute residual from the stored residuals.\n5.  Collect and format the five output values: $R$, $E$, RMSE, mean residual, and maximum absolute residual, each rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases.",

The problem is valid.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated with precise, quantitative language and free of subjective elements. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved.\n\nThe dynamic behavior of each compartment is governed by the pressure balance equation. The driving pressure, $\\Delta P$, is equal to the sum of the resistive pressure drop and the elastic recoil pressure within the compartment. For a given compartment $i$, this relationship is expressed as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\Delta P = R_i \\frac{dV_i(t)}{dt} + P_{el,i}(t)\n$$\nwhere $V_i(t)$ is the volume in compartment $i$ at time $t$, $\\frac{dV_i(t)}{dt}$ is the instantaneous flow rate into the compartment, and $P_{el,i}(t)$ is the elastic recoil pressure. The elastic pressure is related to volume and compliance $C_i$ (or elastance $E_i = 1/C_i$) by $P_{el,i}(t) = \\frac{1}{C_i} V_i(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the pressure balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\Delta P = R_i \\frac{dV_i(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C_i} V_i(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_i}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R_i C_i} V_i = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_i}\n$$\nWe define the time constant for each compartment as $\\tau_i = R_i C_i$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_i}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_i} V_i = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_i}\n$$\nThe general solution to this non-homogeneous differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($V_{h,i}(t)$) and a particular solution ($V_{p,i}(t)$).\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dV_{h,i}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_i} V_{h,i} = 0$, which has the solution $V_{h,i}(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau_i)$, where $A$ is a constant of integration.\nFor a constant driving pressure $\\Delta P$, the particular solution is a constant steady-state volume, $V_{p,i}(t) = V_{ss,i}$. Substituting this into the ODE gives $0 + \\frac{1}{\\tau_i}V_{ss,i} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_i}$, which yields $V_{ss,i} = \\frac{\\tau_i \\Delta P}{R_i} = \\frac{(R_i C_i) \\Delta P}{R_i} = C_i \\Delta P$. This is the maximum volume the compartment would hold if inspiration were infinitely long.\n\nThe general solution is therefore:\n$$\nV_i(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) + C_i \\Delta P\n$$\nWe apply the initial condition $V_i(0)=0$:\n$$\nV_i(0) = 0 = A \\exp(0) + C_i \\Delta P \\implies A = -C_i \\Delta P\n$$\nSubstituting the constant $A$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the filling dynamics of compartment $i$:\n$$\nV_i(t) = C_i \\Delta P \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_i C_i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we calculate the parameters and volumes for each compartment.\n\nFor compartment 1:\n- Time constant: $\\tau_1 = R_1 C_1 = (3 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}\\cdot \\text{s}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.05 \\text{ L}/\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}) = 0.15 \\text{ s}$.\n- Volume at the end of inspiration, $t = T_I = 0.60 \\text{ s}$:\n$$\nV_1(T_I) = C_1 \\Delta P \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_I}{\\tau_1}\\right)\\right) = (0.05)(10) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.60}{0.15}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_1(T_I) = 0.5 \\left(1 - \\exp(-4)\\right) \\text{ L}\n$$\n\nFor compartment 2:\n- Time constant: $\\tau_2 = R_2 C_2 = (12 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}\\cdot \\text{s}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.02 \\text{ L}/\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}) = 0.24 \\text{ s}$.\n- Volume at the end of inspiration, $t = T_I = 0.60 \\text{ s}$:\n$$\nV_2(T_I) = C_2 \\Delta P \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_I}{\\tau_2}\\right)\\right) = (0.02)(10) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.60}{0.24}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_2(T_I) = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\exp(-2.5)\\right) \\text{ L}\n$$\n\nThe tidal volume, $V_T$, is the total volume that has entered the lung by $t=T_I$.

The alveolus has radius $R(t)$, volume $V(t)$, and surface area $A(t)$. Let the alveolar pressure required to inflate the alveolus be the sum of three components: elastic tissue pressure, surface-tension-derived pressure, and airway resistive pressure. The development of the constitutive and dynamical relations must start from the following bases:\n- The Laplace law for a thin spherical interface: the pressure required to maintain a spherical interface of radius $R$ with surface tension $T$ is $P_{\\mathrm{surf}} = 2 T / R$.\n- Linear elastic recoil for tissue: the elastic tissue pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = E_{\\mathrm{t}} \\, (V - V_{0})$, where $E_{\\mathrm{t}}$ is tissue elastance and $V_{0}$ is the reference volume.\n- Linear airway resistance: the resistive pressure drop is $P_{\\mathrm{res}} = R_{\\mathrm{aw}} \\, \\dot{V}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{aw}}$ is airway resistance and $\\dot{V} = dV/dt$ is volumetric flow.\n- Conservation of surfactant adsorbed on the air–liquid interface: let $\\Gamma(t)$ denote the surface concentration (coverage) of surfactant on the interface and $\\Gamma_{\\max}$ its saturation value. Assume effective adsorption and desorption kinetics produce a net source term that, when combined with surface dilatation, yields the surface balance $d(\\Gamma A)/dt = k_{\\mathrm{a}} \\, \\Gamma_{\\max} (1 - \\Gamma/\\Gamma_{\\max}) \\, A - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\, \\Gamma \\, A$, where $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{d}}$ are effective rate constants combining bulk concentration effects into $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Introducing the dimensionless coverage $\\theta(t) = \\Gamma(t)/\\Gamma_{\\max}$, this can be expressed as a single ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\theta$.\n- Equation of state linking surface tension to surface coverage: let $T(\\theta)$ be a monotone decreasing function of $\\theta$ such that $T(\\theta)$ interpolates between the clean air–water value at zero coverage and a low-tension value at full coverage.\n\nYou must:\n1. Derive the ODE for the dimensionless coverage $\\theta(t)$ in terms of the adsorption rate $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$, desorption rate $k_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and the fractional area rate $(\\dot{A}/A)$ generated by breathing-induced area changes.\n2.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of mechanics and transport phenomena, is mathematically well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary parameters and constitutive relations are provided to formulate a solvable model. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires four main steps:\n1.  Derivation of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the dimensionless surfactant coverage $\\theta(t)$.\n2.  Establishment of the geometric and kinematic relationships for the spherical alveolus.\n3.  Specification of all components of the total airway pressure $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t)$.\n4.  Formulation and numerical evaluation of the integral for dissipated energy $W$.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the ODE for Surfactant Coverage\n\nThe problem states the conservation of surfactant on the alveolar surface is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Gamma A)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} \\Gamma_{\\max} (1 - \\Gamma/\\Gamma_{\\max}) A - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\Gamma A $$\nwhere $\\Gamma(t)$ is the surfactant surface concentration, $A(t)$ is the surface area, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible concentration, and $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{d}}$ are effective adsorption and desorption rate constants, respectively.\n\nWe introduce the dimensionless coverage $\\theta(t) = \\Gamma(t) / \\Gamma_{\\max}$, which implies $\\Gamma(t) = \\theta(t) \\Gamma_{\\max}$. Substituting this into the conservation equation:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\theta \\Gamma_{\\max} A)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} \\Gamma_{\\max} (1 - \\theta) A - k_{\\mathrm{d}} (\\theta \\Gamma_{\\max}) A $$\nSince $\\Gamma_{\\max}$ is a constant, we can divide the entire equation by it:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\theta A)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} (1 - \\theta) A - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\theta A $$\nApplying the product rule for differentiation to the left side, $d(\\theta A)/dt = A (d\\theta/dt) + \\theta (dA/dt)$:\n$$ A \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\theta \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} (1 - \\theta) A - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\theta A $$\nDividing by the area $A(t)$ (which is always non-zero) and using dot notation for the time derivative ($\\dot{A} = dA/dt$):\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\theta \\frac{\\dot{A}}{A} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} (1 - \\theta) - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\theta $$\nRearranging to isolate $d\\theta/dt$, we obtain the ODE for the dimensionless coverage $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} (1 - \\theta) - k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\theta - \\theta \\frac{\\dot{A}}{A} $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} - (k_{\\mathrm{a}} + k_{\\mathrm{d}}) \\theta - \\frac{\\dot{A}}{A} \\theta $$\n\n### 2. Geometric and Kinematic Relationships\n\nThe problem specifies a spherical geometry. The volume $V(t)$, radius $R(t)$, and surface area $A(t)$ are related by:\n$$ V(t) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R(t)^3 \\quad \\implies \\quad R(t) = \\left( \\frac{3V(t)}{4\\pi} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n$$ A(t) = 4 \\pi R(t)^2 = 4 \\pi \\left( \\frac{3V(t)}{4\\pi} \\right)^{2/3} = (36\\pi)^{1/3} V(t)^{2/3} $$\nTo find the fractional area rate of change $\\dot{A}/A$, we differentiate $A(t)$ with respect to time using the chain rule:\n$$ \\dot{A} = \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( (36\\pi)^{1/3} V(t)^{2/3} \\right) = (36\\pi)^{1/3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} V(t)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\dot{V}(t) $$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\dot{A}/A$:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{A}}{A} = \\frac{(36\\pi)^{1/3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} V(t)^{-1/3} \\dot{V}(t)}{(36\\pi)^{1/3} V(t)^{2/3}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\dot{V}(t)}{V(t)} $$\nSubstituting this into the ODE for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{a}} - \\left( k_{\\mathrm{a}} + k_{\\mathrm{d}} + \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\dot{V}(t)}{V(t)} \\right) \\theta(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE that can be solved numerically once $V(t)$ and $\\dot{V}(t)$ are specified.\n\nThe breathing waveform is given as:\n$$ V(t) = V_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta V}{2} \\left( 1 - \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi t}{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} \\right) \\right) $$\nwhere $V_0 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R_0^3$. The volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}(t)$ is its time derivative:\n$$ \\dot{V}(t) = \\frac{d V}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{2} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi t}{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{2 \\pi}{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta V}{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi t}{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} \\right) $$\n\nThe initial condition for $\\theta(t)$ at $t=0$ is the kinetic equilibrium for a static interface ($\\dot{V}(0)=0$, hence $\\dot{A}(0)=0$), where $d\\theta/dt = k_{\\mathrm{a}} - (k_{\\mathrm{a}} + k_{\\mathrm{d}})\\theta = 0$. This yields $\\theta(0) = k_{\\mathrm{a}}/(k_{\\mathrm{a}}+k_{\\mathrm{d}})$, provided $k_{\\mathrm{a}}+k_{\\mathrm{d}} \\neq 0$. If $k_{\\mathrm{a}}+k_{\\mathrm{d}} = 0$, a specified initial value $\\theta_{\\mathrm{init}}$ is used.\n\n### 3. Airway Pressure Components\n\nThe total airway pressure $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t)$ is the sum of three components: $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) = P_{\\mathrm{tissue}}(t) + P_{\\mathrm{res}}(t) + P_{\\mathrm{surf}}(t)$.\n\n-   **Tissue Elastic Pressure**: $P_{\\mathrm{tissue}}(t) = E_{\\mathrm{t}} (V(t) - V_0)$. This pressure is determined by the tissue elastance $E_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and the change in volume from the reference state $V_0$.\n\n-   **Airway Resistive Pressure**: $P_{\\mathrm{res}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{aw}} \\dot{V}(t)$. This pressure component is proportional to the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}(t)$ and the airway resistance $R_{\\mathrm{aw}}$.\n\n-   **Surface Tension Pressure**: $P_{\\mathrm{surf}}(t) = 2T(t)/R(t)$, as per the Laplace law for a sphere. The surface tension $T(t)$ depends on the surfactant coverage $\\theta(t)$ via the given equation of state:\n    $$ T(\\theta(t)) = T_{\\min} + (T_{\\max} - T_{\\min}) (1 - \\theta(t)) $$\n    The radius $R(t)$ is determined by the volume $V(t)$. Thus, all quantities required to calculate $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t)$ are determined once $\\theta(t)$ is found by solving its ODE.\n\n### 4. Energy Dissipation Calculation\n\nThe energy dissipated per cycle, $W$, is the work done by the pressure on the system, integrated over one full breathing cycle of duration $T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$.\n$$ W = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) \\dot{V}(t) dt $$\nThis integral represents the area enclosed by the pressure-volume ($P-V$) loop. The work done by purely elastic components like $P_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$ over a closed cycle is zero. Energy dissipation arises from components that cause hysteresis, namely the resistive pressure $P_{\\mathrm{res}}(t)$ and the surface tension pressure $P_{\\mathrm{surf}}(t)$, whose value at a given volume depends on whether the alveolus is inflating or deflating due to the dynamics of $\\theta(t)$.\n\nTo compute $W$, we will perform the following numerical procedure for each test case:\n1.  Set up a discrete time grid from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$.\n2.  Solve the ODE for $\\theta(t)$ over this grid using a numerical solver (e.g., `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`). The ODE function will compute $V(t)$ and $\\dot{V}(t)$ at each time step.\n3.  At each point in the time grid, calculate the instantaneous values of $V(t)$, $\\dot{V}(t)$, $R(t)$, $T(\\theta(t))$, and subsequently the pressure components $P_{\\mathrm{tissue}}(t)$, $P_{\\mathrm{res}}(t)$, and $P_{\\mathrm{surf}}(t)$.\n4.  Sum the pressure components to find the total pressure $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t)$.\n5.  Compute the integrand, the instantaneous power, $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) \\dot{V}(t)$.\n6.  Numerically integrate the instantaneous power over the time grid from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$ (e.g., using `scipy.integrate.trapezoid`) to find the total energy $W$ in Joules.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented in a Python program to calculate $W$ for each specified test case.",
