            "problem": "Consider a cylindrical arterial segment modeled as a three-layer, thick-walled, axisymmetric tube with the intima, media, and adventitia represented by concentric, homogeneous annuli. Let the inner (luminal) radius be $a$, the intima-media interface radius be $r_{1}$, the media-adventitia interface radius be $r_{2}$, and the outer radius be $b$, with $a < r_{1} < r_{2} < b$. The tube is subjected to an internal pressure $p$ at $r=a$ and zero external pressure at $r=b$. A uniform axial stretch $\\lambda_{z}$ is imposed (assume small axial strain so that $\\varepsilon_{z} = \\lambda_{z} - 1$), and there are no body forces.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid as it is scientifically grounded in continuum mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent boundary conditions, and objectively stated.

Each layer $j \\in \\{I, M, A\\}$ (Intima, Media, Adventitia) is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, linearly elastic material.\n\n**1. Kinematics and Incompressibility**\nFor an axisymmetric problem with purely radial displacement $u(r)$, the small-strain components in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du}{dr}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u}{r}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\lambda_z - 1\n$$\nThe material in each layer is incompressible, which for small strains implies that the trace of the strain tensor is zero:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} + \\varepsilon_{zz} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the strain-displacement relations yields a differential equation for the displacement $u^{(j)}(r)$ in each layer $j$:\n$$\n\\frac{du^{(j)}}{dr} + \\frac{u^{(j)}}{r} + \\varepsilon_{z} = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r u^{(j)}) = -\\varepsilon_z$. Integrating with respect to $r$ gives $r u^{(j)} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_z r^2}{2} + C_{1}^{(j)}$, where $C_{1}^{(j)}$ is a constant of integration for layer $j$. The radial displacement field in layer $j$ is thus:\n$$\nu^{(j)}(r) = \\frac{C_{1}^{(j)}}{r} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z r}{2}\n$$\nThe problem requires continuity of radial displacement at the interfaces $r=r_1$ and $r=r_2$.\n$$\nu^{(I)}(r_1) = u^{(M)}(r_1) \\implies \\frac{C_{1}^{(I)}}{r_1} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z r_1}{2} = \\frac{C_{1}^{(M)}}{r_1} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z r_1}{2} \\implies C_{1}^{(I)} = C_{1}^{(M)}\n$$\n$$\nu^{(M)}(r_2) = u^{(A)}(r_2) \\implies \\frac{C_{1}^{(M)}}{r_2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z r_2}{2} = \\frac{C_{1}^{(A)}}{r_2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z r_2}{2} \\implies C_{1}^{(M)} = C_{1}^{(A)}\n$$\nThis leads to the important simplification that the integration constant $C_1$ is the same for all layers: $C_1 \\equiv C_{1}^{(I)} = C_{1}^{(M)} = C_{1}^{(A)}$.\n\nThe strain components in layer $j$ are then:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{rr}^{(j)}(r) = \\frac{d u^{(j)}}{dr} = -\\frac{C_1}{r^2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{(j)}(r) = \\frac{u^{(j)}}{r} = \\frac{C_1}{r^2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{zz}^{(j)}(r) = \\varepsilon_z\n$$\n\n**2. Equilibrium and Constitutive Law**\nThe constitutive equation for an incompressible, isotropic, linearly elastic material is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -q\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $q$ is the hydrostatic pressure part of the stress and $\\mu$ is the shear modulus.\nThe static equilibrium equation in the radial direction, with no body forces, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0\n$$\nThe stress difference is related to the strain difference:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(j)} = 2\\mu_j(\\varepsilon_{rr}^{(j)} - \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{(j)}) = 2\\mu_j \\left( \\left(-\\frac{C_1}{r^2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{C_1}{r^2} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_z}{2}\\right) \\right) = -4\\mu_j\\frac{C_1}{r^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}}{dr} + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(-4\\mu_j\\frac{C_1}{r^2}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}}{dr} = \\frac{4\\mu_j C_1}{r^3}\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $r$ gives the radial stress distribution in layer $j$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}(r) = -\\frac{2\\mu_j C_1}{r^2} + C_{2}^{(j)}\n$$\nwhere $C_{2}^{(j)}$ is a second constant of integration for each layer. The circumferential (hoop) stress is then found from the equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(j)}(r) = \\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}(r) - r\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}}{dr} = \\left(-\\frac{2\\mu_j C_1}{r^2} + C_{2}^{(j)}\\right) - r\\left(\\frac{4\\mu_j C_1}{r^3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\mu_j C_1}{r^2} + C_{2}^{(j)}\n$$\nIn summary, for each layer $j \\in \\{I, M, A\\}$, the stresses are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}(r) = C_{2}^{(j)} - \\frac{2\\mu_j C_1}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(j)}(r) = C_{2}^{(j)} + \\frac{2\\mu_j C_1}{r^2}\n$$\nWe have a total of four unknown constants: $C_1$, $C_{2}^{(I)}$, $C_{2}^{(M)}$, and $C_{2}^{(A)}$.\n\n**3. Application of Boundary and Continuity Conditions**\nWe use the pressure boundary conditions and the continuity of radial stress at the interfaces to form a system of four linear equations for the four constants.\n1. Inner boundary condition: $\\sigma_{rr}^{(I)}(a) = -p \\implies C_{2}^{(I)} - \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2} = -p$.\n2. Outer boundary condition: $\\sigma_{rr}^{(A)}(b) = 0 \\implies C_{2}^{(A)} - \\frac{2\\mu_A C_1}{b^2} = 0$.\n3. Interface continuity at $r=r_1$: $\\sigma_{rr}^{(I)}(r_1) = \\sigma_{rr}^{(M)}(r_1) \\implies C_{2}^{(I)} - \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{r_1^2} = C_{2}^{(M)} - \\frac{2\\mu_M C_1}{r_1^2}$.\n4. Interface continuity at $r=r_2$: $\\sigma_{rr}^{(M)}(r_2) = \\sigma_{rr}^{(A)}(r_2) \\implies C_{2}^{(M)} - \\frac{2\\mu_M C_1}{r_2^2} = C_{2}^{(A)} - \\frac{2\\mu_A C_1}{r_2^2}$.\n\nThe objective is to find $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(I)}(a) = C_{2}^{(I)} + \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2}$. From equation (1), we have $C_{2}^{(I)} = -p + \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2}$. Substituting this into the expression for the hoop stress gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(I)}(a) = \\left(-p + \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2}\\right) + \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2} = -p + \\frac{4\\mu_I C_1}{a^2}\n$$\nThus, we only need to solve for the constant $C_1$. We do this by expressing $C_{2}^{(M)}$ in two ways and equating them.\nFrom (1) and (3): $C_{2}^{(M)} = C_{2}^{(I)} + 2(\\mu_M - \\mu_I) \\frac{C_1}{r_1^2} = -p + \\frac{2\\mu_I C_1}{a^2} + 2(\\mu_M - \\mu_I) \\frac{C_1}{r_1^2}$.\nFrom (2) and (4): $C_{2}^{(M)} = C_{2}^{(A)} + 2(\\mu_M - \\mu_A) \\frac{C_1}{r_2^2} = \\frac{2\\mu_A C_1}{b^2} + 2(\\mu_M - \\mu_A) \\frac{C_1}{r_2^2}$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $C_{2}^{(M)}$:\n$$\n-p + 2C_1\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I}{a^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_I}{r_1^2}\\right) = 2C_1\\left(\\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\np = 2C_1 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_I}{a^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_I}{r_1^2} - \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2} - \\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\np = 2C_1 \\left[ \\mu_I\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\mu_M\\left(\\frac{1}{r_1^2} - \\frac{1}{r_2^2}\\right) + \\mu_A\\left(\\frac{1}{r_2^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nLet the term in the brackets be denoted by $K$:\n$$\nK = \\mu_I\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\mu_M\\left(\\frac{1}{r_1^2} - \\frac{1}{r_2^2}\\right) + \\mu_A\\left(\\frac{1}{r_2^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right)\n$$\nThen $C_1 = \\frac{p}{2K}$.\n\n**4. Final Expression for Circumferential Stress**\nSubstituting $C_1$ into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(I)}(a)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(I)}(a) = -p + \\frac{4\\mu_I}{a^2} \\left(\\frac{p}{2K}\\right) = p\\left(\\frac{2\\mu_I}{a^2 K} - 1\\right) = p\\left(\\frac{2\\mu_I - a^2K}{a^2K}\\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the full expression for $K$:\nThe numerator term is $2\\mu_I - a^2K$:\n$$\n2\\mu_I - a^2\\left[ \\mu_I\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\mu_M\\left(\\frac{1}{r_1^2} - \\frac{1}{r_2^2}\\right) + \\mu_A\\left(\\frac{1}{r_2^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= 2\\mu_I - \\left[ \\mu_I\\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{r_1^2}\\right) + \\mu_M\\left(\\frac{a^2}{r_1^2} - \\frac{a^2}{r_2^2}\\right) + \\mu_A\\left(\\frac{a^2}{r_2^2} - \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\mu_I + \\frac{a^2\\mu_I}{r_1^2} - \\frac{a^2\\mu_M}{r_1^2} + \\frac{a^2\\mu_M}{r_2^2} - \\frac{a^2\\mu_A}{r_2^2} + \\frac{a^2\\mu_A}{b^2} = \\mu_I + a^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I - \\mu_M}{r_1^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2} + \\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe denominator term is $a^2K$:\n$$\na^2K = \\mu_I - a^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I - \\mu_M}{r_1^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2} + \\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the final expression for the luminal hoop stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{I}(a) = p \\frac{\\mu_I + a^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I - \\mu_M}{r_1^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2} + \\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2}\\right)}{\\mu_I - a^2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I - \\mu_M}{r_1^2} + \\frac{\\mu_M - \\mu_A}{r_2^2} + \\frac{\\mu_A}{b^2}\\right)}\n$$\nIt is noted that the uniform axial stretch $\\lambda_z$ does not appear in the final expressions for $\\sigma_{rr}(r)$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$. This is because the term related to $\\varepsilon_z = \\lambda_z - 1$ cancels out of the displacement continuity equations, making the constants $C_1, C_{2}^{(j)}$ independent of the axial deformation under these specific modeling assumptions. The axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$, however, does depend on $\\lambda_z$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be a function of all listed variables, including $\\lambda_z$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the local hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta)$. We apply a force balance on an infinitesimal segment of the fibrous cap. Consider a segment of the cap of axial length $L$ that subtends a small angle $d\\theta$. The area of the inner surface of this segment is $dA = (r d\\theta) L$. The outward radial force on this segment due to the transmural pressure $p$ is $dF_p = p \\cdot dA = p r L d\\theta$.\n\nThis outward force must be balanced by the net inward radial component of the tension forces in the cap membrane. The tension force, or hoop force, acting on each cut face of the segment is $F_H = \\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) A_{\\text{face}}$, where $A_{\\text{face}} = t(\\theta) L$ is the cross-sectional area of the cap. Thus, $F_H = \\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) t(\\theta) L$. For a small angle $d\\theta$, the two hoop forces $F_H$ are nearly opposite, and their vector sum points radially inward. The magnitude of this resultant force is $dF_{H,r} = 2 F_H \\sin(d\\theta/2)$. Using the small-angle approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$, we have $dF_{H,r} \\approx 2 F_H (d\\theta/2) = F_H d\\theta$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $F_H$:\n$$dF_{H,r} = \\left(\\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) t(\\theta) L\\right) d\\theta$$\nFor equilibrium, the outward and inward radial forces must balance: $dF_p = dF_{H,r}$.\n$$p r L d\\theta = \\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) t(\\theta) L d\\theta$$\nCanceling the term $L d\\theta$ from both sides yields the local equilibrium equation, which is a generalization of Laplace's Law for a cylinder with non-uniform thickness:\n$$p r = \\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) t(\\theta)$$\nSolving for the local hoop stress gives:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta) = \\frac{p r}{t(\\theta)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must find the peak hoop stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{peak}}$. Since $p$ and $r$ are positive constants, the stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(\\theta)$ is maximized when its denominator, the cap thickness $t(\\theta)$, is minimized. We are given the thickness function:\n$$t(\\theta) = t_{0}(1 + \\beta \\cos(2\\theta))$$\nTo find the minimum value of $t(\\theta)$, we must find the minimum value of $\\cos(2\\theta)$. The minimum value of the cosine function is $-1$. This occurs when its argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi$, i.e., $2\\theta = (2k+1)\\pi$ for any integer $k$. The angular locations are thus $\\theta = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$. For the domain $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the specific locations are $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAt these locations, the minimum thickness $t_{\\text{min}}$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{min}} = t_{0}(1 + \\beta(-1)) = t_{0}(1 - \\beta)$$\nThe constraint $0 < \\beta < 1$ ensures that $t_{\\text{min}}$ is positive. The peak hoop stress is then:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{p r}{t_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{p r}{t_{0}(1 - \\beta)}$$\nThis completes the second part of the problem.\n\nFinally, we must compute the skew factor $S = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{avg}}}$. To do this, we first need to find $\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{avg}}$. This is the stress calculated using a uniform thickness equal to the circumferential average of $t(\\theta)$, denoted as $\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle$.\nThe average thickness is calculated by integrating over the full circumference and dividing by the length of the interval, $2\\pi$:\n$$\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} t(\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} t_{0}(1 + \\beta \\cos(2\\theta)) d\\theta$$\nWe can split the integral:\n$$\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle = \\frac{t_0}{2\\pi} \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 d\\theta + \\beta \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(2\\theta) d\\theta \\right)$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(2\\theta) d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2}\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\sin(4\\pi)}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(0)}{2} = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for average thickness:\n$$\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle = \\frac{t_0}{2\\pi} (2\\pi + \\beta \\cdot 0) = t_0$$\nAs expected, the mean thickness is $t_0$. Now, we calculate $\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{avg}}$ by applying the standard TWPV formula with the uniform average thickness $\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle = t_0$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{p r}{\\langle t(\\theta) \\rangle} = \\frac{p r}{t_0}$$\nNow we can compute the skew factor $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{avg}}} = \\frac{\\frac{p r}{t_{0}(1 - \\beta)}}{\\frac{p r}{t_0}}$$\nThe terms $p$, $r$, and $t_0$ cancel out:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the skew factor.",

The circumferential stress is obtained from the energy by $\\sigma_\\theta = \\dfrac{dW}{de}$.\n\nUse the following constitutive choice for the strain-energy density in the circumferential direction:\n$$\nW(e) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa\\, e^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{c^2}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1 - c\\,e\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa > 0$ is the linear matrix stiffness (with units of pascals), $\\alpha > 0$ is a fiber stiffness scale (with units of pascals), and $c > 0$ is a dimensionless fiber nonlinearity parameter controlling the exponential stiffening. The corresponding circumferential stress is\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(e) = \\frac{dW}{de} = \\kappa\\, e + \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1\\right).\n$$\n\nRupture metrics:\n- Stress-based metric $M_s$ compares the operating stress to a critical stress threshold $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$ and is defined as\n$$\nM_s = \\frac{\\sigma_\\theta}{\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}}.\n$$\n- Energy-based metric $M_e$ compares the operating strain energy density to a critical energy density threshold $W_{\\text{crit}}$ and is defined as\n$$\nM_e = \\frac{W}{W_{\\text{crit}}}.\n$$\nIn both cases, values exceeding $1$ indicate predicted rupture risk by that metric. Divergence between metrics for a given parameter set is defined to occur if one metric predicts risk ($>1$) while the other predicts safety ($\\leq 1$).\n\nTask: Starting from the stated fundamental laws and constitutive definitions, derive the governing equation to determine the operating engineering strain $e$ under a given pressure $p$, radius $R$, thickness $h$, and material parameters $\\kappa$, $\\alpha$, and $c$. Solve for $e$ via a robust numerical root-finding method by enforcing the force equilibrium with the stress from the energy potential, then compute $M_s$ and $M_e$, and finally determine the divergence condition as a boolean.\n\nUse the following fixed parameters and units throughout:\n- Pressure $p = 13{,}000$ pascals (Pa),\n- Radius $R = 0.0015$ meters (m),\n- Linear matrix stiffness $\\kappa = 500{,}000$ pascals (Pa),\n- Fiber stiffness scale $\\alpha = 5{,}000$ pascals (Pa),\n- Critical stress $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}} = 90{,}000$ pascals (Pa),\n- Critical energy density $W_{\\text{crit}} = 4{,}500$ pascals (Pa), noting that energy density has units of joules per cubic meter, equivalent to pascals.\n\nParametric study and test suite: Vary the cap thickness $h$ and fiber nonlinearity $c$ over the following sets to probe typical, boundary, and edge-case behaviors:\n1. $h = 0.00035$ m, $c = 40$,\n2. $h = 0.00030$ m, $c = 20$,\n3. $h = 0.00025$ m, $c = 10$,\n4. $h = 0.00020$ m, $c = 30$,\n5. $h = 0.00010$ m, $c = 10$,\n6. $h = 0.00050$ m, $c = 10$.\n\nFor each test case, numerically solve for $e$ satisfying the equilibrium and compute the stress-based metric $M_s$ and energy-based metric $M_e$. The program must then determine a boolean flag $D$ per case indicating divergence, where $D$ is true if $(M_s > 1 \\wedge M_e \\leq 1)$ or $(M_s \\leq 1 \\wedge M_e > 1)$, and false otherwise.\n\nOutput format and units:\n- For each test case, output the triple $[M_s, M_e, D]$, where $M_s$ and $M_e$ are unitless floats rounded to six decimal places, and $D$ is a boolean.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each element itself being a three-element list corresponding to one test case, for example: [[M_s1,M_e1,D1],[M_s2,M_e2,D2],...].\n\nAngles are not involved. All physical quantities are handled in International System of Units (SI). Ensure scientific realism by verifying monotonicity of the stress function in the chosen interval for root finding and by selecting brackets that guarantee a unique solution for the operating strain for each test case.",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the potential for divergence between stress-based and energy-based rupture metrics for an atherosclerotic plaque cap under pressure. This is accomplished by numerically solving for the mechanical state of a simplified plaque model and then evaluating the metrics for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe solution process is as follows:\n1.  Derive the governing algebraic equation for the operating circumferential engineering strain, $e$.\n2.  Solve this nonlinear equation numerically for $e$ for each specified parameter set.\n3.  Compute the operating stress $\\sigma_\\theta$ and strain energy density $W$.\n4.  Calculate the stress-based metric $M_s$ and energy-based metric $M_e$.\n5.  Determine the boolean divergence flag $D$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for the engineering strain $e$. The problem is in quasistatic equilibrium, so the stress generated within the membrane must balance the stress induced by the internal pressure. The effective pressure-induced stress is given by the thin-membrane version of Laplace's law for a cylinder:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{p R}{h}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the internal pressure, $R$ is the mean radius, and $h$ is the cap thickness. This is the required circumferential Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_\\theta$, that the material must sustain.\n\nThe material's constitutive response provides the stress as a function of the strain. The problem states this relationship as:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(e) = \\frac{dW}{de} = \\kappa\\, e + \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1\\right)\n$$\nwhere $W(e)$ is the strain-energy density function, $\\kappa$ is the linear matrix stiffness, $\\alpha$ is a fiber stiffness scale, and $c$ is a dimensionless fiber nonlinearity parameter.\n\nEquating the required stress and the constitutively generated stress gives the governing equation for the operating strain $e$:\n$$\n\\kappa\\, e + \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1\\right) = \\frac{p R}{h}\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $e$ that cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, a numerical root-finding method is necessary. We can define a function $f(e)$ whose root corresponds to the solution:\n$$\nf(e) = \\kappa\\, e + \\frac{\\alpha}{c}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1\\right) - \\frac{p R}{h} = 0\n$$\n\nTo solve for $e$ robustly, we must ensure that a unique solution exists in the domain of interest. We expect tensile strain, so $e \\ge 0$. The derivative of the stress function with respect to strain is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{de} = \\kappa + \\alpha \\exp(c\\,e)\n$$\nGiven that the material parameters $\\kappa > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, and $\\exp(c\\,e) > 0$, the derivative $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{de}$ is strictly positive for all $e$. This proves that $\\sigma_\\theta(e)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $e$. Consequently, for any positive required stress $\\sigma_{\\text{req}} = pR/h$, there exists a single, unique value of $e$ that satisfies the equilibrium equation.\n\nWe will use a bracketing root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` in SciPy), which guarantees convergence if an interval $[a, b]$ is found such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.\nFor $e=0$, the stress $\\sigma_\\theta(0)=0$, so $f(0) = -\\frac{p R}{h} < 0$.\nWe need an upper bound $e_{\\text{max}}$ where $f(e_{\\text{max}}) > 0$. Given the monotonic nature of $\\sigma_\\theta(e)$, any sufficiently large $e$ will produce a stress exceeding $\\sigma_{\\text{req}}$. A physically reasonable strain limit for soft biological tissues, such as $e=1.0$ (representing a $100\\%$ stretch), is a safe upper bound for all test cases. The search interval $[0, 1]$ will securely bracket the unique positive root.\n\nOnce the unique operating strain $e$ is found for a given set of parameters $\\{h, c\\}$, we can calculate the rupture metrics.\nThe operating stress is simply the required stress from equilibrium:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{p R}{h}\n$$\nThe stress-based metric $M_s$ is then:\n$$\nM_s = \\frac{\\sigma_\\theta}{\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}} = \\frac{p R}{h \\sigma_{\\text{crit}}}\n$$\n\nThe operating strain energy density $W$ is calculated by substituting the solved value of $e$ into its definition:\n$$\nW(e) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa\\, e^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{c^2}\\left(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1 - c\\,e\\right)\n$$\nThe energy-based metric $M_e$ is then:\n$$\nM_e = \\frac{W(e)}{W_{\\text{crit}}}\n$$\n\nFinally, the divergence condition is evaluated. Divergence is defined to occur if one metric predicts risk (value $> 1$) while the other predicts safety (value $\\le 1$). This is captured by the boolean expression:\n$$\nD = (M_s > 1 \\land M_e \\le 1) \\lor (M_s \\le 1 \\land M_e > 1)\n$$\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case $\\{h, c\\}$ is:\n1.  Define the fixed parameters: $p = 13000$, $R = 0.0015$, $\\kappa = 500000$, $\\alpha = 5000$, $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}} = 90000$, $W_{\\text{crit}} = 4500$.\n2.  Calculate the target equilibrium stress $\\sigma_{\\text{target}} = pR/h$.\n3.  Define the function $f(e) = \\kappa\\, e + (\\alpha/c)(\\exp(c\\,e) - 1) - \\sigma_{\\text{target}}$.\n4.  Numerically find the root $e$ of $f(e)=0$ in the interval $[0, 1]$.\n5.  Calculate $M_s = \\sigma_{\\text{target}}/\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$.\n6.  Calculate $W(e)$ using the solved $e$.\n7.  Calculate $M_e = W(e)/W_{\\text{crit}}$.\n8.  Determine the divergence flag $D$ using the logical condition above.\n9.  Store the resulting triple $[M_s, M_e, D]$, with floats rounded to six decimal places.\nThis procedure is repeated for all provided test cases.",
