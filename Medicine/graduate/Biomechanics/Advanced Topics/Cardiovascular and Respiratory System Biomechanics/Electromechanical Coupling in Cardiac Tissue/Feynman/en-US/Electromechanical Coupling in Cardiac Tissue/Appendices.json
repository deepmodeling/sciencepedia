            "problem": "A one-dimensional strand of electrically coupled cardiac myocytes is modeled as a uniform cylindrical cable of radius $a$, intracellular conductivity $\\sigma$, membrane specific resistance $R_{m}$, and membrane specific capacitance $C_{m}$. Assume the strand is long compared to any emergent length scale so that end effects are negligible. The electrical behavior follows conservation of axial current and capacitive charging of the membrane, with axial resistance per unit length $r_{i}$, membrane resistance per unit length $r_{m}$, and membrane capacitance per unit length $c_{m}$. The action potential upstroke is driven primarily by the fast sodium current ($I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), and the voltage rise during the propagating front is characterized by a rise time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$.\n\nUsing only the definitions of $r_{i}$, $r_{m}$, and $c_{m}$ for a cylindrical cable and the idea that a traveling depolarization must charge the downstream membrane over a characteristic distance while rising over a characteristic time, derive an order-of-magnitude expression for the conduction velocity in terms of a space constant and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$. Then compute the numerical value of the conduction velocity for the following physiologically plausible parameters: $a = 7.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$, $R_{m} = 0.2\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $C_{m} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}$, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNext, suppose a cytosolic calcium (Ca) transient during the upstroke engages a calcium-dependent inactivation gate on $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ that reduces the available sodium conductance to a fraction $\\beta$ of its baseline value during the upstroke.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts: 1) derivation of the necessary cable parameters and the space constant, 2) derivation of the expression for conduction velocity, 3) calculation of the initial and modified velocities, and 4) mechanistic justification for the change in velocity.\n\n**1. Cable Parameters and Space Constant**\n\nWe begin by defining the distributed circuit parameters per unit length ($r_i$, $r_m$, $c_m$) for a cylindrical cable of radius $a$.\n- The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is the intracellular resistivity ($\\rho = 1/\\sigma$) divided by the cross-sectional area ($A = \\pi a^2$).\n$$r_{i} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma A} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\pi a^2}$$\n- The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, relates the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (units $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$) to the membrane circumference per unit length ($2 \\pi a$). It is defined as $r_m = R_m / (\\text{circumference})$.\n$$r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2 \\pi a}$$\n- The membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_m$, relates the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ (units $\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$) to the circumference.\n$$c_{m} = C_{m} (2 \\pi a)$$\nThe space constant, $\\lambda$, is a characteristic length scale in cable theory that describes how far a steady-state voltage change will propagate along the cable. It is defined as:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2 \\pi a)}{1/(\\sigma \\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} \\sigma \\pi a^2}{2 \\pi a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a \\sigma R_{m}}{2}}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Conduction Velocity Expression**\n\nThe problem requests an order-of-magnitude expression derived from the idea that a propagating wave must charge the downstream membrane. Conduction velocity, $\\theta$, has units of distance per time. The characteristic distance over which the axial current from an excited region can effectively depolarize the downstream membrane is the space constant, $\\lambda$. For an actively propagating action potential, the characteristic time scale for the voltage to change at a given point in space is the upstroke rise time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$.\n\nA simple scaling argument, as prompted, combines these characteristic scales. The wavefront propagates a distance on the order of $\\lambda$ in a time on the order of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$. This yields the following order-of-magnitude expression for conduction velocity:\n$$\\theta \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}}$$\nThis expression correctly captures the qualitative dependencies: velocity increases with a larger space constant (current spreads further) and decreases with a longer rise time (local charging is slower).\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation of Conduction Velocities**\n\nFirst, we calculate the space constant $\\lambda$ using the given parameters: $a = 7.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$, and $R_{m} = 0.2\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{(7.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.2\\,\\mathrm{S/m})(0.2\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{2}} = \\sqrt{0.15 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{15 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = \\sqrt{15} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we compute the initial conduction velocity $\\theta$ using $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 0.7746\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nNext, we consider the modification due to calcium-dependent inactivation of $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. The sodium conductance is reduced by a factor $\\beta = 0.6$. The problem states this leads to a new rise time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}' = \\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}/\\beta$. The passive cable properties ($a$, $\\sigma$, $R_m$) are unchanged, so the space constant $\\lambda$ remains the same. The modified conduction velocity, $\\theta'$, is:\n$$\\theta' = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}'} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}/\\beta} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}}\\right) = \\beta\\theta$$\nSubstituting the values for $\\beta$ and $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta' = 0.6 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\\right) \\approx 0.6 \\times 0.7746\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 0.46476\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nRounding the final numeric answer to three significant figures, we get $0.465\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n**4. Mechanistic Justification**\n\nCalcium-dependent inactivation of the fast sodium current ($I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) reduces the number of available sodium channels during the action potential upstroke. This diminishes the peak inward current that depolarizes the cell membrane, thus slowing the maximum rate of voltage rise and increasing the upstroke duration ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}'$). Because the conduction velocity is inversely proportional to this rise time in our model ($\\theta' \\propto 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}'$), the slower local depolarization results in a slower propagation of the action potential wavefront along the cardiac strand.",

            "problem": "Consider a single cardiac sarcomere modeled as two identical half-sarcomeres with sliding filaments.

            "solution": "The problem presents a multi-part question concerning a standard biophysical model of cardiac muscle contraction. The model incorporates the sliding filament theory for force generation, length-dependent activation through lattice spacing changes, and Hill-type kinetics for calcium binding. All components of the problem are scientifically grounded, well-defined, and internally consistent. The parameters and assumptions are standard in the field of cardiac biomechanics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts, corresponding to the four tasks in the problem statement.\n\n1. Derivation of the total geometric overlap length $\\ell(L)$.\n\nThe problem defines a half-sarcomere with the M-line at coordinate $x=0$ and the Z-line at $x=L/2$. The thick filament domain is given as the interval $[0, m]$, and the thin filament domain is given as $[L/2 - a, L/2]$. The overlap length in one half-sarcomere, denoted as $\\ell_{1/2}(L)$, is the length of the intersection of these two intervals.\n\nThe length of the intersection of two intervals $[x_1, x_2]$ and $[y_1, y_2]$ is given by $\\max(0, \\min(x_2, y_2) - \\max(x_1, y_1))$.\nFor our case, $x_1=0$, $x_2=m$, $y_1=L/2 - a$, and $y_2=L/2$.\nThus, the half-sarcomere overlap length is:\n$$\n\\ell_{1/2}(L) = \\max\\left(0, \\min\\left(m, \\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\max\\left(0, \\frac{L}{2} - a\\right)\\right)\n$$\nWe analyze this expression in a piecewise manner based on the value of the sarcomere length $L$ relative to the filament lengths. We use the provided typical values $m=0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $a=1.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This implies $2m = 1.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $2a = 2.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Since $m < a$, the critical lengths in increasing order are $2m$ and $2a$.\n\nCase i: Ascending limb ($0 < L < 2m$).\nIn this range, $L/2 < m$, so $\\min(m, L/2) = L/2$. Also, $L/2 < m < a$, which implies $L/2 - a < 0$, so $\\max(0, L/2 - a) = 0$.\nThe overlap length is $\\ell_{1/2}(L) = L/2 - 0 = L/2$. This corresponds to the thin filaments from opposite Z-lines beginning to overlap each other, but the problem's definition of overlap focuses only on thick-thin filament interaction.\n\nCase ii: Plateau of the length-tension curve ($2m \\le L \\le 2a$).\nIn this range, $L/2 \\ge m$, so $\\min(m, L/2) = m$. Also, $L/2 \\le a$, which implies $L/2 - a \\le 0$, so $\\max(0, L/2 - a) = 0$.\nThe overlap length is $\\ell_{1/2}(L) = m - 0 = m$. Here, the thick filament half is fully overlapped by the thin filament.\n\nCase iii: Descending limb ($2a < L \\le 2(m+a)$).\nIn this range, $L/2 > a > m$, so $\\min(m, L/2) = m$. Also, $L/2 > a$, which implies $L/2 - a > 0$, so $\\max(0, L/2 - a) = L/2 - a$.\nThe overlap length is $\\ell_{1/2}(L) = m - (L/2 - a) = m + a - L/2$. This corresponds to the thin filaments being pulled past the ends of the thick filaments as the sarcomere stretches. Overlap ceases completely when $m = L/2 - a$, or $L = 2(m+a)$.\n\nThe total geometric overlap length in the sarcomere is $\\ell(L) = 2 \\cdot \\ell_{1/2}(L)$.\nCombining the cases, we have the piecewise expression for $\\ell(L)$:\n$$\n\\ell(L) =\n\\begin{cases}\nL & \\text{if } 0 < L < 2m \\\\\n2m & \\text{if } 2m \\le L \\le 2a \\\\\n2(m+a) - L & \\text{if } 2a < L \\le 2(m+a) \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } L > 2(m+a)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nUsing the given parameters $m=0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $a=1.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we find $2m = 1.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $2a=2.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe physiologically relevant regions are:\n- Plateau: $1.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\le L \\le 2.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, where $\\ell(L) = 1.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Descending limb: $2.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} < L \\le 3.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, where $\\ell(L) = 2(0.8+1.1) - L = 3.8 - L$.\n\n2. Derivation of the active tension expression $T(L,[Ca])$.\n\nThe conservation of unit cell volume is given by $s(L)^{2}\\,L = s_{0}^{2}\\,L_{0}$. We first solve for the lattice spacing $s(L)$:\n$$\ns(L)^2 = s_0^2 \\frac{L_0}{L} \\implies s(L) = s_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{L_0}{L}} = s_0 \\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nNext, we express the length-dependent dissociation constant $K_d(L)$ in terms of $L$. We are given $K_{d}(L) = K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\frac{s(L)}{s_{0}}\\right)^{\\alpha}$. Substituting the expression for $s(L)$:\n$$\nK_{d}(L) = K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\frac{s_0 (L_0/L)^{1/2}}{s_0}\\right)^{\\alpha} = K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{1/2}\\right)^{\\alpha} = K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{\\alpha/2}\n$$\nThe active tension $T(L,[Ca])$ is proportional to the product of the total overlap length $\\ell(L)$ and the calcium activation function $f([Ca];L)$. Let $C$ be the positive proportionality constant.\n$$\nT(L,[Ca]) = C \\cdot \\ell(L) \\cdot f([Ca];L) = C \\cdot \\ell(L) \\cdot \\frac{[Ca]^{n}}{[Ca]^{n} + K_{d}(L)^{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $K_{d}(L)$:\n$$\nT(L,[Ca]) = C \\cdot \\ell(L) \\cdot \\frac{[Ca]^{n}}{[Ca]^{n} + \\left(K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{\\alpha/2}\\right)^{n}} = C \\cdot \\ell(L) \\cdot \\frac{[Ca]^{n}}{[Ca]^{n} + K_{d0}^{n}\\,\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{n\\alpha/2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\ell(L)$ is the piecewise function derived in part 1. This is the complete expression for active tension up to the constant $C$.\n\n3. First-order optimality condition for maximal tension.\n\nWe want to find the sarcomere length $L^*$ that maximizes $T(L,[Ca]_{0})$ for a fixed calcium concentration $[Ca]_{0}$. The first-order optimality condition is $\\frac{d}{dL}T(L,[Ca]_{0}) \\big|_{L=L^*} = 0$.\nThe problem specifies that we are in the descending limb region, where $\\ell(L) = 2(m+a) - L$.\nThe tension expression is:\n$$\nT(L,[Ca]_{0}) = C \\cdot (2(m+a)-L) \\cdot \\frac{[Ca]_{0}^{n}}{[Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_{d0}^{n}\\,L_{0}^{n\\alpha/2} L^{-n\\alpha/2}}\n$$\nTo find the derivative, we use the product rule, $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$. Let $u(L) = 2(m+a)-L$ and $v(L) = \\frac{[Ca]_{0}^{n}}{[Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_{d}(L)^n}$. The constant $C$ can be ignored for finding the maximum.\n$u'(L) = -1$.\nFor $v'(L)$, we use the quotient rule or chain rule. Let's use the chain rule on $([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_{d}(L)^n)^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dL} K_d(L)^n = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left( K_{d0}^n L_0^{n\\alpha/2} L^{-n\\alpha/2} \\right) = K_{d0}^n L_0^{n\\alpha/2} \\left( -\\frac{n\\alpha}{2} L^{-n\\alpha/2-1} \\right) = -K_d(L)^n \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L}\n$$\nSo, $\\frac{d}{dL} \\left([Ca]_{0}^{n} + K_{d}(L)^{n}\\right) = -K_d(L)^n \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L}$.\nThe derivative of $v(L)$ is:\n$$\nv'(L) = [Ca]_{0}^{n} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\left([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\left( -K_d(L)^n \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L} \\right) = [Ca]_{0}^{n} \\frac{K_d(L)^n \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L}}{\\left([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n\\right)^2}\n$$\nThe optimality condition $\\frac{d}{dL}T(L) = 0$ implies $u'v + uv' = 0$ (after dividing by $C$):\n$$\n(-1) \\frac{[Ca]_{0}^{n}}{[Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n} + (2(m+a)-L) \\cdot [Ca]_{0}^{n} \\frac{K_d(L)^n \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L}}{\\left([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n\\right)^2} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n)^2}{[Ca]_0^n}$ (assuming $[Ca]_0 \\neq 0$):\n$$\n-([Ca]^{n}_{0} + K_d(L)^n) + (2(m+a)-L) \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L} K_d(L)^n = 0\n$$\nThis is the first-order optimality condition for $L=L^*$. To write it explicitly in terms of the given parameters, we substitute back $K_d(L)^n = K_{d0}^n (L_0/L)^{n\\alpha/2}$:\n$$\n\\left(2(m+a)-L\\right) \\frac{n\\alpha}{2L} K_{d0}^{n} \\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{n\\alpha/2} = [Ca]_{0}^{n} + K_{d0}^{n} \\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{n\\alpha/2}\n$$\n\n4. Derivation of the shift in calcium sensitivity, $\\Delta pCa50$.\n\nThe concentration $[Ca]_{50}(L)$ is defined as the calcium concentration at which tension is half of its maximum with respect to $[Ca]$ at a fixed length $L$. The tension $T(L, [Ca])$ is maximal when the activation function $f([Ca];L) = 1$. The half-maximal tension occurs when $f([Ca]_{50};L) = 1/2$.\n$$\nf([Ca]_{50};L) = \\frac{[Ca]_{50}^{n}}{[Ca]_{50}^{n} + K_{d}(L)^{n}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $[Ca]_{50}$:\n$$\n2[Ca]_{50}^{n} = [Ca]_{50}^{n} + K_{d}(L)^{n} \\implies [Ca]_{50}^{n} = K_{d}(L)^{n}\n$$\nSince concentrations and dissociation constants are positive real numbers, we have $[Ca]_{50}(L) = K_d(L)$.\nThe calcium sensitivity is defined as $pCa50(L) = -\\log_{10}([Ca]_{50}(L))$.\nTherefore, $pCa50(L) = -\\log_{10}(K_d(L))$.\nUsing the expression for $K_d(L)$ from part 2:\n$$\npCa50(L) = -\\log_{10}\\left( K_{d0}\\,\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{\\alpha/2} \\right)\n$$\nUsing logarithm properties, $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$ and $\\log(x^p) = p\\log(x)$:\n$$\npCa50(L) = -\\left[ \\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)^{\\alpha/2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\npCa50(L) = -\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $-\\log(x/y) = \\log(y/x)$:\n$$\npCa50(L) = -\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate the shift $\\Delta pCa50 = pCa50(L_2) - pCa50(L_1)$, where $L_1 = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $L_2 = 2.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\npCa50(L_2) = -\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\npCa50(L_1) = -\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\n\\Delta pCa50 = \\left(-\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_0}\\right)\\right) - \\left(-\\log_{10}(K_{d0}) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe constant term $-\\log_{10}(K_{d0})$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\Delta pCa50 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_0}\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ and using the logarithm property $\\log(a) - \\log(b) = \\log(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\Delta pCa50 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\left[ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_0}\\right) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2/L_0}{L_1/L_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta pCa50 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the shift in calcium sensitivity, expressed solely in terms of $\\alpha$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ as requested.",

This phenomenon, known as mechano-electric feedback, is explored by modeling how membrane stretch alters the resting potential through the action of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), which generate the current $I_{SAC}$ . By analyzing the stability and sensitivity of the membrane potential ($V_m$) to mechanical strain, you will uncover a fundamental feedback loop that contributes to both physiological regulation and pathological conditions like arrhythmias.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of cardiac cell electrophysiology under mechanical load, rooted in the principle of charge conservation and Hodgkin-Huxley-type formalism for ionic currents. All necessary parameters and equations are provided to perform the requested analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe governing equation for the membrane potential $V_m$ is given by the conservation of charge:\n$$\nC_m\\dfrac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{ion}\n$$\nwhere $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance per unit area and $I_{ion}$ is the total ionic current density. The total ionic current is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$\nI_{ion} = I_{K_b} + I_{Na_b} + I_{L} + I_{SAC}\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the currents yields:\n$$\nC_m\\dfrac{dV_m}{dt} = -\\Big(g_{K_b}(V_m - E_K) + g_{Na_b}(V_m - E_{Na}) + g_{L}(V_m - E_{L}) + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon)(V_m - E_{SAC})\\Big)\n$$\n\n**1. Fixed-Point Equation and Closed-Form Expression for $V_m^{*}$**\n\nA fixed point, or steady-state membrane potential $V_m^{*}$, is achieved when the membrane potential is no longer changing with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\dfrac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$. For a sustained strain $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_0$, the governing equation at steady state becomes:\n$$\n0 = -\\Big(g_{K_b}(V_m^{*} - E_K) + g_{Na_b}(V_m^{*} - E_{Na}) + g_{L}(V_m^{*} - E_{L}) + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)(V_m^{*} - E_{SAC})\\Big)\n$$\nThis is the fixed-point equation, which states that the total ionic current at the steady-state potential $V_m^{*}$ must be zero.\n\nTo obtain a closed-form expression for $V_m^{*}$, we solve this algebraic equation. We can regroup the terms by factoring out $V_m^{*}$:\n$$\ng_{K_b}(V_m^{*} - E_K) + g_{Na_b}(V_m^{*} - E_{Na}) + g_{L}(V_m^{*} - E_{L}) + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)(V_m^{*} - E_{SAC}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nV_m^{*}\\big(g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)\\big) - \\big(g_{K_b}E_K + g_{Na_b}E_{Na} + g_{L}E_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)E_{SAC}\\big) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $V_m^{*}$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$\nV_m^{*} = \\dfrac{g_{K_b}E_K + g_{Na_b}E_{Na} + g_{L}E_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)E_{SAC}}{g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the steady-state potential is a weighted average of the reversal potentials of all active channels, where the weights are their respective conductances.\n\n**2. Fixed-Point Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nTo analyze the sensitivity of the fixed point $V_m^{*}$ to changes in strain $\\epsilon$, we compute the derivative $\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon}$. For this analysis, we treat $\\epsilon$ as a variable. Let $g_S(\\epsilon) = g_{SAC}(\\epsilon)$ for notational simplicity. Let $g_{bg} = g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L}$ be the total constant background conductance, and let $\\Sigma_{bg} = g_{K_b}E_K + g_{Na_b}E_{Na} + g_{L}E_{L}$. The expression for $V_m^{*}$ becomes:\n$$\nV_m^{*}(\\epsilon) = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_{bg} + g_S(\\epsilon) E_{SAC}}{g_{bg} + g_S(\\epsilon)}\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation with respect to $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon} = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon} E_{SAC}\\right)(g_{bg} + g_S) - (\\Sigma_{bg} + g_S E_{SAC})\\left(\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon}\\right)}{(g_{bg} + g_S)^2}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon}$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon} \\Big(E_{SAC}(g_{bg} + g_S) - (\\Sigma_{bg} + g_S E_{SAC})\\Big)}{(g_{bg} + g_S)^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the term in the large parentheses:\n$$\nE_{SAC}g_{bg} + E_{SAC}g_S - \\Sigma_{bg} - g_S E_{SAC} = E_{SAC} g_{bg} - \\Sigma_{bg}\n$$\nFrom the expression for $V_m^{*}$, we can write $\\Sigma_{bg} = V_m^{*}(g_{bg} + g_S) - g_S E_{SAC}$. Substituting this into the simplified term:\n$$\nE_{SAC}g_{bg} - \\Big(V_m^{*}(g_{bg} + g_S) - g_S E_{SAC}\\Big) = E_{SAC}g_{bg} - V_m^{*}g_{bg} - V_m^{*}g_S + g_S E_{SAC} = (E_{SAC} - V_m^{*})(g_{bg} + g_S)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the derivative expression:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon} (E_{SAC} - V_m^{*})(g_{bg} + g_S)}{(g_{bg} + g_S)^2} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{d g_S}{d\\epsilon} (E_{SAC} - V_m^{*})}{g_{bg} + g_S}\n$$\nWe are given the assumption $\\dfrac{d g_{SAC}}{d\\epsilon} > 0$. The denominator is the total conductance $G_{tot} = g_{bg} + g_S$, which is a sum of non-negative physical quantities and thus is positive. Therefore, the sign of $\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon}$ is determined by the sign of $(E_{SAC} - V_m^{*})$.\nUnder the assumption $E_{SAC} > V_m^{*}$, the term $(E_{SAC} - V_m^{*})$ is positive. All terms in the numerator and denominator are positive, so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_m^{*}}{\\partial \\epsilon} > 0$. This means that an increase in strain $\\epsilon$ leads to an increase in $V_m^{*}$. Since $V_m^{*}$ is less than $E_{SAC}$, this increase constitutes a shift of the membrane potential *toward* the SAC reversal potential $E_{SAC}$.\n\n**3. Linearization and Stability Analysis**\n\nTo analyze the local asymptotic stability of the fixed point $V_m^{*}$, we linearize the governing ODE about this point. Let $V_m(t) = V_m^{*} + \\delta V(t)$, where $\\delta V(t)$ is a small perturbation. The ODE is $\\dfrac{dV_m}{dt} = f(V_m) / C_m$, where\n$$\nf(V_m) = - (g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0))V_m + (g_{K_b}E_K + g_{Na_b}E_{Na} + g_{L}E_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)E_{SAC})\n$$\nLet $G_{tot} = g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L} + g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)$. Then $f(V_m) = -G_{tot} V_m + \\text{constant}$.\nThe linearized equation for the perturbation is:\n$$\n\\dfrac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = \\dfrac{1}{C_m} \\left.\\dfrac{df}{dV_m}\\right|_{V_m=V_m^{*}} \\delta V\n$$\nThe derivative of $f(V_m)$ with respect to $V_m$ is:\n$$\n\\dfrac{df}{dV_m} = -G_{tot}\n$$\nSince this derivative is a constant, its value at $V_m^{*}$ is also $-G_{tot}$. The linearized equation becomes:\n$$\n\\dfrac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -\\dfrac{G_{tot}}{C_m} \\delta V\n$$\nThe solution to this linear ODE is $\\delta V(t) = \\delta V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{G_{tot}}{C_m} t\\right)$. For the fixed point $V_m^{*}$ to be locally asymptotically stable, the perturbation $\\delta V(t)$ must decay to zero as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. This requires the argument of the exponential to be negative:\n$$\n-\\dfrac{G_{tot}}{C_m} < 0\n$$\nSince the membrane capacitance $C_m$ is a positive physical constant, this condition simplifies to $G_{tot} > 0$. The total conductance $G_{tot}$ is the sum of all individual conductances, which are non-negative physical quantities. Assuming at least one conductance is non-zero (which is the case here), $G_{tot}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the condition for local asymptotic stability is that the total membrane conductance must be positive.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation of $V_m^{*}$**\n\nWe use the given parameter values to compute $V_m^{*}$. First, we calculate the stretch-activated conductance $g_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0)$ for $\\epsilon_0 = 0.08$.\nThe open probability $p(\\epsilon_0)$ is:\n$$\np(\\epsilon_0) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_{1/2}}{s_\\epsilon}\\right)} = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{0.08 - 0.06}{0.02}\\right)} = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp(-1)}\n$$\nNumerically, $p(0.08) \\approx \\dfrac{1}{1 + 0.367879} \\approx 0.731058$.\nThe stretch-activated conductance is:\n$$\ng_{SAC}(\\epsilon_0) = \\bar{g}_{SAC}\\,p(\\epsilon_0) = (0.20 \\ \\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times 0.731058 \\approx 0.1462117 \\ \\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^2\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the expression for $V_m^{*}$. The units of conductance ($\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$) and potential ($\\mathrm{mV}$) are consistent, resulting in a potential in $\\mathrm{mV}$.\nNumerator:\n$$\n\\sum g_j E_j = g_{K_b}E_K + g_{Na_b}E_{Na} + g_{L}E_{L} + g_{SAC}E_{SAC}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum g_j E_j = (0.15)(-90) + (0.02)(60) + (0.05)(-60) + (0.1462117)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum g_j E_j = -13.5 + 1.2 - 3.0 + 0 = -15.3\n$$\nDenominator (Total Conductance $G_{tot}$):\n$$\nG_{tot} = g_{K_b} + g_{Na_b} + g_{L} + g_{SAC}\n$$\n$$\nG_{tot} = 0.15 + 0.02 + 0.05 + 0.1462117 = 0.3662117 \\ \\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^2\n$$\nFinally, we compute $V_m^{*}$:\n$$\nV_m^{*} = \\dfrac{\\sum g_j E_j}{G_{tot}} = \\dfrac{-15.3}{0.3662117} \\approx -41.7797 \\ \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the steady-state membrane potential is $V_m^{*} \\approx -41.78 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.",
