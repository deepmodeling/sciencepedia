            "problem": "In a realistic spectacle optical system in air, consider a thick meniscus spectacle lens fabricated from a homogeneous isotropic material of refractive index $n_{\\ell} = 1.60$ at the design wavelength. The front surface (first surface encountered by light) has radius of curvature $R_{1} = +50.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, the back surface has radius of curvature $R_{2} = +75.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (using the Cartesian sign convention with left-to-right light propagation and radii positive when the center of curvature lies to the right of the surface), and the center thickness is $t = 4.00\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The spectacle lens is mounted such that the vertex distance from the back surface to the corneal apex is $d = 12.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The surrounding medium is air with refractive index $n_{a} = 1.00$. Assume paraxial, small-angle behavior with angles measured in radians.\n\nAn object at infinity subtends a small field angle at the eye. Model the eye as an emmetropic reduced eye whose retina is located at the back focal plane of the eye’s own optics so that, in the absence of the spectacle lens, an object at infinity forms a sharp retinal image.\n\nUsing only first principles of Gaussian (paraxial) optics, namely:\n- refraction expressed by surface power $F = (n_{2} - n_{1})/r$,\n- vergence transfer across space $L \\mapsto L/(1 - s L/n)$ for propagation over distance $s$ in medium of refractive index $n$,\n- and the definition of equivalent power of a thick lens assembled from two refracting surfaces and a homogeneous thickness,\n\nperform the following:\n\n1) For the object at infinity, compute the location of the image formed by the spectacle lens measured from the back surface along the optical axis (that is, the back focal distance of the lens in air).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in ophthalmic optics with realistic parameters and a clear set of tasks based on fundamental principles.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested. All calculations are performed symbolically first, followed by numerical evaluation. The Cartesian sign convention is used throughout, where light propagates from left to right.\n\n**Part 1: Back Focal Distance**\n\nThe back focal distance is the distance from the back surface of the lens to the image plane for an object at infinity. This distance, denoted $f'_{v}$, is the reciprocal of the back vertex power, $F'_{v}$, in air ($n_{a} = 1.00$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the power of each refracting surface using the formula $F = (n_{2} - n_{1})/R$.\n\nThe front surface (surface 1) has radius $R_{1} = +50.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Light travels from air ($n_{a} = 1.00$) into the lens ($n_{\\ell} = 1.60$).\n$$F_{1} = \\frac{n_{\\ell} - n_{a}}{R_{1}} = \\frac{1.60 - 1.00}{+50.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.60}{0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = +12.0 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\nThe back surface (surface 2) has radius $R_{2} = +75.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Light travels from the lens ($n_{\\ell} = 1.60$) into air ($n_{a} = 1.00$).\n$$F_{2} = \\frac{n_{a} - n_{\\ell}}{R_{2}} = \\frac{1.00 - 1.60}{+75.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{-0.60}{0.075 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = -8.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\nTo find the back vertex power, $F'_{v}$, we trace the vergence of light from an object at infinity. The initial vergence at the front surface is $L_{1} = 0$.\nAfter refraction by the first surface, the vergence is $L'_{1} = L_{1} + F_{1} = F_{1}$.\nThis vergence is then transferred across the lens thickness, $t = 4.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, in the lens medium of index $n_{\\ell}$. The vergence arriving at the second surface, $L_{2}$, is given by the vergence transfer formula $L \\mapsto L/(1 - s L/n)$:\n$$L_{2} = \\frac{L'_{1}}{1 - t \\frac{L'_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}} = \\frac{F_{1}}{1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1}}$$\nFinally, refraction at the second surface gives the final vergence, $L'_{2}$, which is the back vertex power $F'_{v}$.\n$$F'_{v} = L'_{2} = L_{2} + F_{2} = \\frac{F_{1}}{1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1}} + F_{2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$F'_{v} = \\frac{12.0 \\ \\mathrm{D}}{1 - \\frac{4.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.60} (12.0 \\ \\mathrm{D})} + (-8.00 \\ \\mathrm{D})$$\n$$F'_{v} = \\frac{12.0}{1 - (0.0025)(12.0)} - 8.00 = \\frac{12.0}{1 - 0.03} - 8.00 = \\frac{12.0}{0.97} - 8.00$$\n$$F'_{v} \\approx 12.371134 \\ \\mathrm{D} - 8.00 \\ \\mathrm{D} = +4.371134 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe back focal distance in air ($n_{a} = 1.00$) is the reciprocal of the back vertex power:\n$$f'_{v} = \\frac{n_{a}}{F'_{v}} = \\frac{1.00}{4.371134 \\ \\mathrm{D}} \\approx 0.228773 \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting to millimeters and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$f'_{v} = 228.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n**Part 2: Spectacle Magnification (SM)**\n\nSpectacle Magnification (SM) is the ratio of the retinal image height with the lens to that without it. For an object at infinity subtending a small angle $\\alpha$, the retinal image height is proportional to the angle of the chief ray entering the eye's optical system, $\\alpha'$. Without the lens, this angle is $\\alpha$. With the lens, it is some new angle $\\alpha'$. Thus, $SM = \\alpha'/\\alpha$. We derive this ratio by tracing a chief ray, which is defined as the ray from the object that passes through the center of the eye's entrance pupil. The reduced eye model assumption simplifies the eye's optics to a single principal plane at the corneal apex. Therefore, the entrance pupil is located at a distance $d = 12.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ from the back vertex of the lens.\n\nWe trace a ray forwards from the object at angle $\\alpha$ and initial height $y_{1}$ at the front vertex. This ray must pass through the pupil center, meaning its height must be zero at a distance $d$ from the back vertex.\nThe paraxial ray trace equations for a thick lens from the front vertex (height $y_{1}$, angle $\\alpha$) to the back vertex (height $y_{2}$, angle $\\alpha'$) in air are:\n$$y_{2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) y_{1} + \\left(\\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) \\alpha$$\n$$\\alpha' = \\left(-F_{eq}\\right) y_{1} + \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{2}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) \\alpha$$\nwhere $F_{eq} = F_{1} + F_{2} - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{1}F_{2}$ is the equivalent power of the thick lens.\n\nThe condition that the ray passes through the pupil center at $(z=d, y=0)$ implies $y_{2} + d \\cdot \\alpha' = 0$, or $y_{2} = -d \\alpha'$.\nSubstitute this into the first ray trace equation:\n$$-d \\alpha' = \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) y_{1} + \\left(\\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) \\alpha$$\nSolve for the initial height $y_{1}$:\n$$y_{1} = \\frac{-d \\alpha' - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} \\alpha}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}}$$\nNow substitute this expression for $y_{1}$ into the second ray trace equation:\n$$\\alpha' = -F_{eq} \\left(\\frac{-d \\alpha' - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} \\alpha}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{2}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) \\alpha$$\nGroup terms in $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$ to find the ratio $\\alpha'/\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha' \\left[1 - \\frac{d F_{eq}}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}}\\right] = \\alpha \\left[\\frac{\\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{eq}}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}} + \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{2}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe term multiplying $\\alpha$ on the right-hand side simplifies. Let's expand the numerator:\n$$ \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{eq} + \\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{2}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) = \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}(F_{1}+F_{2}-\\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{1}F_{2}) + 1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{1} - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{2} + \\frac{t^{2}}{n_{\\ell}^{2}}F_{1}F_{2} = 1 $$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$\\alpha' \\left[1 - \\frac{d F_{eq}}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}}\\right] = \\alpha \\left[\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}}}\\right]$$\nMultiplying both sides by $(1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}})$ gives:\n$$\\alpha' \\left[1 - \\frac{t F_{1}}{n_{\\ell}} - d F_{eq}\\right] = \\alpha$$\nThus, the spectacle magnification is:\n$$SM = \\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1} - d F_{eq}}$$\nUsing the identity $F_{eq} = F'_{v} \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{1}\\right)$, we can rewrite this in its more common form:\n$$SM = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1} - d F'_{v}\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}}F_{1}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1}\\right) \\left(1 - d F'_{v}\\right)}$$\nThis expression is the product of two factors:\nThe Shape Factor, $M_{S} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} F_{1}}$\nThe Power Factor, $M_{P} = \\frac{1}{1 - d F'_{v}}$\n\nNow we evaluate SM numerically with $d = 12.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$M_{S} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.60}(12.0 \\ \\mathrm{D})} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.03} = \\frac{1}{0.97}$$\n$$M_{P} = \\frac{1}{1 - (12.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})(4.371134 \\ \\mathrm{D})} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.0524536} = \\frac{1}{0.9475464}$$\n$$SM = M_{S} \\times M_{P} = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.97}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{0.9475464}\\right) \\approx 1.0309278 \\times 1.0553539 \\approx 1.088033$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$SM = 1.088$$",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of paraxial optics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no violations of fundamental principles, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to derive an explicit expression for the largest symmetric allowable vertex-distance error magnitude, $|\\Delta s|$, and then to compute its numerical value.\n\nThe starting point is the set of fundamental principles provided. For an object at infinity, the light rays are parallel, so the vergence incident on the spectacle lens is $V_{\\text{in}} = 0$. According to the thin lens equation, the vergence of light immediately after exiting the lens is:\n$$ V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} + F = 0 + F = F $$\nThis vergence $F$ is at the back surface of the lens. To find the effective vergence at the corneal plane, we must account for the propagation of light over the vertex distance $s$.

The magnitude of the error in effective vergence at the corneal plane is $|V(s_0 + \\Delta s) - V(s_0)|$. This error must not exceed a maximum tolerated value, $\\Delta V_{\\max}$.

Therefore, the reverse slab-off technique is preferred when the required corrective prism is negative:\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} < 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$-y(F_U - F_A) < 0$$\nSince $y > 0$, we can divide the inequality by $-y$ and reverse the inequality sign:\n$$F_U - F_A > 0 \\implies F_U > F_A$$\n\nThus, the general condition under which the reverse slab-off technique is used is that the algebraic power of the unaffected lens ($F_U$) must be greater than the algebraic power of the affected lens ($F_A$). The affected lens is, by definition, the one with the smaller magnitude of power, $|F_A| < |F_U|$. In summary, reverse slab-off is indicated when the lens with the smaller magnitude of power is also the lens with the smaller algebraic power.\n\n### Part 2: Specific Calculation\n\nThe given values are:\n- Right lens power: $F_{\\text{R}} = +1.75$ D.\n- Left lens power: $F_{\\text{L}} = +4.25$ D.\n- Vertical drop: $y = 12$ mm.\n\nFirst, we must convert the vertical drop $y$ from millimeters to centimeters to be consistent with the units in Prentice's rule as given:\n$$y = 12 \\text{ mm} = 1.2 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nNext, we identify the affected lens by comparing the magnitudes of the lens powers:\n$$|F_{\\text{R}}| = |+1.75| = 1.75 \\text{ D}$$\n$$|F_{\\text{L}}| = |+4.25| = 4.25 \\text{ D}$$\nSince $|F_{\\text{R}}| < |F_{\\text{L}}|$, the right lens is the affected lens ($A=R$) and the left lens is the unaffected lens ($U=L$).\n\nNow, we calculate the initial prismatic effect at the near fixation point for each lens using the formula $P = -yF$:\n$$P_{\\text{R}} = -(1.2 \\text{ cm}) \\times (+1.75 \\text{ D}) = -2.1 \\text{ prism diopters}$$\n$$P_{\\text{L}} = -(1.2 \\text{ cm}) \\times (+4.25 \\text{ D}) = -5.1 \\text{ prism diopters}$$\nThe negative sign indicates base down (BD) prism for both lenses, as expected for positive powers. The right lens induces $2.1 \\Delta$ BD, and the left lens induces $5.1 \\Delta$ BD.\n\nThe required corrective prism, $P_{\\text{corr}}$, is added to the affected lens (right lens) to equalize its prismatic effect with the unaffected lens (left lens):\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = P_L - P_R$$\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = (-5.1 \\Delta) - (-2.1 \\Delta) = -5.1 \\Delta + 2.1 \\Delta = -3.0 \\Delta$$\n\nThe corrective prism required is $-3.0$ prism diopters. The negative sign signifies base down prism. This is consistent with our general condition, as $F_U = F_L = +4.25$ is algebraically greater than $F_A = F_R = +1.75$, indicating a reverse slab-off (BD prism) is needed.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $-3.0$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $-3.000$.\n\nThe required modification is to introduce $3.000$ prism diopters base down to the right lens. As a signed number, this is $-3.000$ prism diopters.",
