            "problem": "A patient encounter is documented using the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) framework. Consider the canonical evidentiary roles that define each SOAP section: patient-reported experiences and histories without clinician-generated measurements belong to the Subjective section; clinician-observed or measured findings that are reproducible and recorded with methods or instruments belong to the Objective section; diagnostic synthesis and differential diagnoses belong to the Assessment section; and decisions for management, including interventions, tests to be ordered, counseling, and follow-up, belong to the Plan section. You are seeing a $58$-year-old woman with long-standing hyperopia who presents with sudden right eye pain and headache, nausea, blurred vision, and “rainbow halos around lights” worse in dim illumination for approximately $12$ hours. She denies trauma. Past ocular records note “narrow angles” from a prior optometrist visit. She reports starting an over-the-counter decongestant containing pseudoephedrine $2$ days ago. She reports a generalized rash with “sulfa” medications in the past. Family history is positive for her mother having an acute “high eye pressure” attack. On examination, the right eye (oculus dexter, OD) best-corrected visual acuity is $20/80$ and the left eye (oculus sinister, OS) is $20/25$. Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) measures intraocular pressure of $52$ mmHg OD and $18$ mmHg OS. Slit-lamp examination reveals corneal microcystic edema, a shallow anterior chamber, and a mid-dilated, sluggish pupil in the right eye. Gonioscopy shows a closed angle in the right eye and a narrow angle in the left eye. The optic nerve in the right eye is difficult to visualize due to corneal edema. You synthesize that an acute primary angle-closure crisis is occurring in the right eye. You intend to rapidly lower intraocular pressure, avoid pilocarpine initially, consider intravenous mannitol at $1$ g/kg, avoid acetazolamide in light of the reported “sulfa” allergy, and arrange definitive laser peripheral iridotomy bilaterally once the cornea clears.\n\nWhich of the following option statements correctly map a specific data element from this encounter to its appropriate SOAP section, based strictly on the evidentiary role of that element? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Place the patient’s report of “seeing rainbow halos around lights for about $12$ hours” in Subjective.\n\nB.

            "problem": "An ophthalmology trainee is asked to design a targeted history for suspected angle-closure susceptibility in a patient who presents with intermittent episodes of blurred vision and colored rings around lights in dim environments. The patient is a $58$-year-old hyperopic woman who reports episodic brow ache and transient worsening of distance vision after starting a new migraine medication approximately $2$ weeks ago. She also recently took an over-the-counter cold remedy. The attending emphasizes that the history should be constructed from first principles regarding anterior chamber angle mechanics and pharmacologic pupil dynamics, and it must be sufficiently specific to distinguish pupillary-block–mediated angle closure from uveal effusion–mediated angle closure.\n\nUsing core definitions of anterior chamber angle anatomy and aqueous humor dynamics, along with well-tested physiologic observations about pupillary behavior in light/dark and known drug effects on the iris–lens–ciliary body complex, select the single best option that represents the most focused, high-yield set of questions to capture angle-closure susceptibility and medication triggers, and to differentiate pupillary block from topiramate-associated uveal effusion. The set should explicitly probe dim-light episodes, halo phenomena, brow ache, and both anticholinergic/sympathomimetic exposures and topiramate-induced uveal effusion features, while avoiding inclusion of unrelated features suggestive primarily of open-angle disease or non-ocular headache syndromes.\n\nA. Ask about episodes in dim environments (for example, “dark theater” or night driving), transient colored halos around lights, brow or periocular ache with nausea, the timing and nature of new medications including anticholinergic antihistamines/decongestants and topiramate, and whether there was an acute bilateral myopic shift or sudden onset of blurred distance vision soon after topiramate initiation; also clarify whether symptoms abate with bright light, and whether similar episodes have occurred previously.\n\nB.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient Profile**: A $58$-year-old hyperopic woman.\n- **Presenting Complaint**: Intermittent episodes of blurred vision and colored rings (halos) around lights in dim environments.\n- **Associated Symptoms**: Episodic brow ache.\n- **Medication History**: Started a new migraine medication approximately $2$ weeks ago, followed by transient worsening of distance vision. Recently took an over-the-counter (OTC) cold remedy.\n- **Suspected Condition**: Angle-closure susceptibility.\n- **Diagnostic Task**: Design a targeted history to distinguish between pupillary-block–mediated angle closure and uveal effusion–mediated angle closure.\n- **Required Principles**: The history should be based on first principles of anterior chamber angle mechanics, aqueous humor dynamics, pharmacologic pupil dynamics, pupillary behavior in light/dark, and known drug effects on the iris–lens–ciliary body complex.\n- **Required Scope**: The history must probe for dim-light episodes, halo phenomena, brow ache, anticholinergic/sympathomimetic exposures, and topiramate-induced uveal effusion features.\n- **Exclusion Criteria**: The history should avoid features primarily related to open-angle disease or non-ocular headache syndromes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against standard validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is impeccable from a scientific and medical standpoint. The patient profile ($58$-year-old, hyperopic) represents a classic demographic for primary angle-closure susceptibility. The symptoms (intermittent blur, halos, brow ache) and triggers (dim light) are pathognomonic for subacute angle-closure episodes. The potential medication triggers—OTC cold remedies (containing sympathomimetics/anticholinergics) and a new migraine prophylactic (strongly suggesting topiramate)—are well-established precipitants of angle closure via two distinct mechanisms. The core task of differentiating pupillary block from uveal effusion syndrome (specifically, topiramate-associated) is a critical and standard clinical reasoning challenge in ophthalmology. All concepts mentioned, such as anterior chamber mechanics, pupil dynamics, myopic shift, and drug-induced effects, are core, fact-based principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear clinical scenario and a specific, answerable question: to select the best set of history questions from a list of options based on clearly defined criteria. The existence of a single best option is plausible given the specificity of the required diagnostic differentiation.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or opinion. The criteria for the correct answer are explicitly defined and based on established medical knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and represents a realistic clinical reasoning task. The solution process can proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to formulate a history that distinguishes between two primary mechanisms of angle closure in a susceptible patient: pupillary block and uveal effusion syndrome.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Pupillary-Block Angle Closure**:\n    - **Anatomy**: This occurs in anatomically predisposed eyes, typically hyperopic eyes with a shallow anterior chamber, a large crystalline lens, and a narrow iridocorneal angle.\n    - **Mechanism**: In dim light, the pupil dilates (mydriasis). In a crowded anterior segment, this causes the lax peripheral iris to bunch up at the angle, physically obstructing the trabecular meshwork (the primary site of aqueous humor outflow). Simultaneously, increased contact between the posterior iris and the anterior lens capsule can impede the flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, a phenomenon called relative pupillary block. This pressure gradient causes the peripheral iris to bow forward (iris bombé), further closing the angle. IOP rises rapidly.\n    - **Triggers**: Physiologic mydriasis (dim light, emotional stress) and pharmacologic mydriasis (anticholinergic drugs like atropine or certain antihistamines; sympathomimetic drugs like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, common in OTC cold remedies).\n    - **Key History Questions**: Do episodes occur in dark environments (e.g., movie theaters, night driving)? Do symptoms resolve in bright light (which causes pupillary constriction, or miosis, pulling the peripheral iris away from the angle)? Has the patient recently used OTC cold, allergy, or motion sickness medications?\n\n2.  **Analysis of Uveal Effusion-Mediated Angle Closure**:\n    - **Mechanism**: This is a distinct, non-pupillary-block mechanism. It is most commonly associated with certain sulfonamide-derived drugs, with topiramate being a classic example. The drug induces an idiosyncratic inflammatory reaction causing supraciliary and ciliary body edema and effusion. This swelling causes the entire ciliary body to rotate anteriorly, which in turn pushes the crystalline lens and iris forward as a single unit (the lens-iris diaphragm). This secondary displacement shallows the anterior chamber uniformly and closes the angle.\n    - **Hallmark Features**:\n        - **Bilateralism**: Tends to be bilateral, unlike many cases of primary pupillary block.\n        - **Acute Myopic Shift**: The anterior displacement of the lens increases the total refractive power of the eye, inducing a sudden-onset myopia (nearsightedness). Patients report a sudden blurring of their distance vision. This is a crucial diagnostic clue. The patient's report of \"transient worsening of distance vision\" is highly suggestive of this.\n        - **Timing**: Typically occurs within the first $1-2$ weeks of initiating the causative drug (e.g., topiramate). The patient's timeline of symptoms appearing $2$ weeks after starting a new migraine medication is a perfect match.\n    - **Key History Questions**: What is the specific name of the new migraine medication? When was it started relative to symptom onset? Was there a sudden, bilateral worsening of distance vision?\n\n3.  **Synthesis for the Optimal History**:\n    An effective history must integrate questions to probe both pathways. It needs to confirm the classic symptoms of angle closure (halos, brow ache, nausea), and then specifically target the triggers and features that differentiate the two mechanisms. It must include questions about:\n    -   Light conditions (dim vs. bright).\n    -   OTC medications (anticholinergic/sympathomimetic).\n    -   The specific migraine medication (topiramate).\n    -   The timing of drug initiation.\n    -   The presence of an acute myopic shift.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ask about episodes in dim environments (for example, “dark theater” or night driving), transient colored halos around lights, brow or periocular ache with nausea, the timing and nature of new medications including anticholinergic antihistamines/decongestants and topiramate, and whether there was an acute bilateral myopic shift or sudden onset of blurred distance vision soon after topiramate initiation; also clarify whether symptoms abate with bright light, and whether similar episodes have occurred previously.**\n-   This option comprehensively covers all necessary points derived from first principles. It probes for pupillary block triggers (dim environments, abatement with bright light) and symptoms (halos, ache). It explicitly asks about medications that cause pupillary block (anticholinergic/sympathomimetic agents). Crucially, it also specifically asks about topiramate and its hallmark sign, the acute myopic shift, directly addressing the need to differentiate from uveal effusion. This set of questions is focused, high-yield, and directly maps to the diagnostic challenge.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**.\n\n**B. Emphasize diurnal fluctuation of intraocular pressure (IOP), chronic corticosteroid use, gradual peripheral vision loss, and dryness/redness; ask about family history of glaucoma and adherence to pressure-lowering drops, but do not focus on light-dependent symptom modulation or recent systemic medications.**\n-   This history is targeted toward **primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)**, a chronic, slowly progressive disease. Gradual peripheral vision loss is its hallmark, not the acute symptoms described. Diurnal IOP fluctuation is a feature of many glaucomas but not a key differentiator here. Chronic corticosteroid use is a risk factor for steroid-induced open-angle glaucoma. By explicitly avoiding questions about light modulation and recent medications, this option fails the primary task of investigating acute angle-closure triggers.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Focus on migraine aura descriptors (for example, scintillations, fortification spectra), photophobia, phonophobia, and response to triptans; add questions about contact lens intolerance and evaporative dry eye triggers, without probing dim-light episodes, halos, brow ache, or systemic medications.**\n-   This history incorrectly shifts the focus from an ocular emergency to a neurological or surface-level ocular problem. While the patient is on a migraine medication, the symptoms described (halos, brow ache) are not typical migraine auras. This line of questioning would dangerously misdirect the diagnostic process. The instruction to avoid probing the cardinal symptoms and triggers of angle closure makes this option completely inappropriate.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Center the history on prior blunt ocular trauma, ultraviolet light exposure, occupational particulate exposure, and sleeping position; include questions on seasonal allergies and sinus pressure, but do not inquire about dim-light visual phenomena or recent systemic drug changes.**\n-   This option focuses on a miscellaneous collection of risk factors for other conditions. Blunt trauma can cause angle recession glaucoma, but the presentation is different. The other factors are largely irrelevant to the acute presentation. Most importantly, it explicitly excludes inquiry into the most critical diagnostic information (dim light phenomena and drug changes), thus failing to address the problem.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Ask specifically about anticholinergic and sympathomimetic cold remedies and antihistamines and about urinary retention or constipation, but omit questions about dim-light episodes, halos, brow ache, and topiramate-associated acute myopic shift or timing relative to drug initiation.**\n-   This option is partially on the right track by asking about drugs that cause pupillary block. However, it is fatally flawed by its omissions. It neglects the cardinal symptoms of angle closure (halos, brow ache) and, most critically, omits any inquiry into the topiramate-induced uveal effusion mechanism. This prevents the clinician from performing the required differentiation between the two potential etiologies.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**.",

During ophthalmic history taking, the clinician records whether the patient reports new-onset floaters within the past $24$ hours. The target condition is a retinal tear. Let $D$ denote the presence of a retinal tear and $S$ denote the history feature “new-onset floaters.” The baseline (pre-test) probability of retinal tear among all adult non-trauma ophthalmic presentations in this service is $P(D) = 0.02$. A pooled evidence review specific to this triage context yields a positive likelihood ratio for $S$ of $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = 6.5$, defined as $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = \\frac{P(S \\mid D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D)}$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, and using the odds-based formulation as needed, derive an expression for the updated (posterior) probability $P(D \\mid S)$ in terms of $P(D)$ and $\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$.

If you reference other history elements such as flashes or Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD), assume they are not being combined in the calculation for this question.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference as applied to medical diagnostics. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\mid S)$ given the prior probability $P(D)$ and the positive likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$, and then to compute its numerical value.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability, which leads to Bayes' theorem. The probability of event $A$ given event $B$ is defined as:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nFrom this, we can write $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$. By symmetry, $P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\mid A) P(A)$. Equating these two expressions gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has a retinal tear (the disease) and $S$ be the event that the patient reports new-onset floaters (the sign/symptom). We are interested in finding the posterior probability of a retinal tear given the report of floaters, which is $P(D \\mid S)$. Applying Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S)}$$\nThe term $P(D)$ is the prior probability of the disease. The term $P(S \\mid D)$ is the probability of the sign given the disease (sensitivity). The term $P(S)$ is the overall probability of observing the sign in the population. We can expand $P(S)$ using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive states: disease present ($D$) and disease absent ($\\neg D$):\n$$P(S) = P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nThis equation expresses the posterior probability in terms of the prior probability and the conditional probabilities of the sign.\n\nTo use the likelihood ratio, we transition to the odds-based formulation. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(\\neg A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$$\nThe prior odds of disease are $\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}$. The posterior odds of disease, given the sign $S$, are $\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)}$.\n\nLet us derive an expression for the posterior odds. Using Bayes' theorem for both $P(D \\mid S)$ and $P(\\neg D \\mid S)$:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S)}$$\n$$P(\\neg D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(S)}$$\nDividing the first equation by the second, the common denominator $P(S)$ cancels:\n$$\\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)} = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nWe can rearrange the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)} = \\left(\\frac{P(S \\mid D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}\\right)$$\nRecognizing the terms, this is:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = \\frac{P(S \\mid D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D)}$ is the given positive likelihood ratio for the sign $S$. This elegant relationship states that the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.\n\nFinally, we must convert the posterior odds back to a probability. If we let $O_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)$, then:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{1 - P(D \\mid S)}$$\nSolving for $P(D \\mid S)$:\n$$O_{\\text{post}}(1 - P(D \\mid S)) = P(D \\mid S)$$\n$$O_{\\text{post}} - O_{\\text{post}}P(D \\mid S) = P(D \\mid S)$$\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = P(D \\mid S) (1 + O_{\\text{post}})$$\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $O_{\\text{post}}$, $\\mathrm{LR}_S$, and $\\text{Odds}(D)$:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)}{1 + \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}}{1 + \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\mid S)$ in terms of the prior probability $P(D)$ and the likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$.\n\nA likelihood ratio is particularly appropriate for quantifying the diagnostic value of a history feature because it is a property of the test or sign itself, independent of the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. It directly answers the clinically relevant question: \"How much does this finding change my suspicion of the disease?\". This separation of test characteristics ($\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$) from population characteristics ($P(D)$) makes it a robust and transportable measure for clinical decision-making.\n\nThe assumption of conditional independence is relevant when combining multiple, distinct pieces of evidence. For example, if we were considering both floaters ($S_1$) and flashes ($S_2$), we would need to assume that, given the presence of a retinal tear, the occurrence of floaters is independent of the occurrence of flashes (i.e., $P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\mid D) = P(S_1 \\mid D)P(S_2 \\mid D)$). In this problem, however, we are updating the probability based on only a single feature, $S$. Therefore, the concept of conditional independence between different findings is not invoked or required.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.\nGiven:\n- Prior probability, $P(D) = 0.02$.\n- Positive likelihood ratio, $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = 6.5$.\n\nFirst, calculate the prior odds of having a retinal tear:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.02}{1 - 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{2}{98} = \\frac{1}{49}$$\nNext, calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D) = 6.5 \\times \\frac{1}{49} = \\frac{6.5}{49}$$\nFinally, convert the posterior odds back to a probability:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{1 + \\frac{6.5}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{\\frac{49}{49} + \\frac{6.5}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{\\frac{55.5}{49}}$$\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{6.5}{55.5} = \\frac{13}{111}$$\nTo obtain the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{13}{111} \\approx 0.117117117...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1171$.\nThe presence of new-onset floaters increases the probability of a retinal tear from a baseline of $2\\%$ to approximately $11.7\\%$.",
