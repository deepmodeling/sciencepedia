It is based on established principles and definitions from vision science and clinical ophthalmology, specifically concerning automated static perimetry. All necessary information for a derivation is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nThe task is to derive expressions for the threshold stimulus luminance, $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$, and the corresponding Weber contrast, $C$, based on the provided definitions.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Threshold Stimulus Luminance ($L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$)**\n\nWe begin with the definition of decibel ($dB$) attenuation provided for the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA):\n$$x = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{L_{\\max}}{L_{\\mathrm{stim}}}\\right)$$\nHere, $x$ is the attenuation in decibels, $L_{\\max}$ is the maximum stimulus luminance of the instrument, and $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$ is the stimulus luminance presented at the patient's detection threshold. Our goal is to solve this equation for $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$ as a function of $x$ and $L_{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, we isolate the logarithmic term by dividing both sides of the equation by $10$:\n$$\\frac{x}{10} = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{L_{\\max}}{L_{\\mathrm{stim}}}\\right)$$\nTo eliminate the base-$10$ logarithm, we apply the inverse operation, which is exponentiation with a base of $10$. We raise $10$ to the power of each side of the equation:\n$$10^{\\frac{x}{10}} = 10^{\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{L_{\\max}}{L_{\\mathrm{stim}}}\\right)}$$\nBy the definition of a logarithm, $10^{\\log_{10}(y)} = y$. Applying this property to the right side of the equation yields:\n$$10^{\\frac{x}{10}} = \\frac{L_{\\max}}{L_{\\mathrm{stim}}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$ by algebraic rearrangement:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{stim}} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{x}{10}} = L_{\\max}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{stim}} = \\frac{L_{\\max}}{10^{\\frac{x}{10}}}$$\nThis expression can be written using a negative exponent:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{stim}} = L_{\\max} 10^{-\\frac{x}{10}}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the threshold stimulus luminance in $\\mathrm{cd}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ as a function of the measured decibel attenuation $x$ and the instrument's maximum luminance $L_{\\max}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Weber Contrast ($C$)**\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Weber contrast, $C$. The problem provides the definition of Weber contrast for a light-on-light increment threshold:\n$$C = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{stim}} - B}{B}$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$ is the luminance of the stimulus at threshold and $B$ is the uniform background luminance. The problem states this is an appropriate model for the Goldmann III stimulus under photopic conditions (the Weber regime).\n\nTo express $C$ in terms of the initial given variables ($x$, $L_{\\max}$, and $B$), we substitute the expression for $L_{\\mathrm{stim}}$ derived in Part 1 into the equation for $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{(L_{\\max} 10^{-\\frac{x}{10}}) - B}{B}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the dimensionless Weber contrast required to reach threshold. This expression can also be written as:\n$$C = \\frac{L_{\\max} 10^{-\\frac{x}{10}}}{B} - 1$$\nHowever, the single-fraction form is more compact.\n\nThe two requested expressions are:\n1) $L_{\\mathrm{stim}} = L_{\\max} 10^{-\\frac{x}{10}}$\n2) $C = \\frac{L_{\\max} 10^{-\\frac{x}{10}} - B}{B}$\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a single row matrix containing these two expressions.",
