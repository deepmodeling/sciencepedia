            "solution": "The task is to derive the posterior probability of a patient having fungal keratitis given a positive result from a combined assay, and then to calculate its numerical value. We will use the provided parameters for sensitivity, specificity, and pre-test probability.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has fungal keratitis (the \"Disease\" is present).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have fungal keratitis.\nLet $T$ be the event that the combined assay yields a \"positive\" result (the \"Test\" is positive).\nLet $T^c$ be the event that the combined assay is not positive.\n\nThe information provided in the problem can be translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pre-test probability of fungal keratitis, which is the prior probability of the disease, is $P(D) = 0.30$.\n2.  The probability of a patient not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is formally written as $P(T|D) = 0.85$.\n4.  The specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is formally written as $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate). This is the complement of the specificity:\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe goal is to find the posterior probability of having fungal keratitis given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D|T)$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nWe start from Bayes' theorem, which is derived from the definition of conditional probability. The conditional probability of event $D$ given event $T$ is:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability as:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D) P(D)$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. This can be expanded using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios: the patient has the disease or does not have the disease.\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term in the sum:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the posterior probability $P(D|T)$ in terms of the prior probability $P(D)$, the sensitivity $P(T|D)$, and the false positive rate $P(T|D^c)$. The false positive rate is derived from the specificity, $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression:\n$P(D) = 0.30$\n$P(D^c) = 0.70$\n$P(T|D) = 0.85$\n$P(T|D^c) = 0.10$\n\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)}$$\nFirst, calculate the products in the numerator and denominator:\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$P(T|D)P(D) = 0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$$\nThe second term in the denominator is the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$P(T|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.10 \\times 0.70 = 0.070$$\nNow, substitute these values back into the fraction:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.070}$$\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.255}{0.325}$$\nFinally, we compute the value of this fraction:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{255}{325} = \\frac{51}{65} \\approx 0.78461538...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $8$, $4$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth digit).\nTherefore, the numerical value is $0.7846$.",

            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation and Computation of the PK/PD Index**\n\nThe problem states that for concentration-dependent antibiotics, such as the fluoroquinolone class, the antibacterial effect is driven by the magnitude of the peak drug concentration relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target pathogen. The goal is to construct a dimensionless index from these two parameters.\n\nLet the peak achievable drug concentration in the target tissue be denoted by $C_{\\max}$. The unit of this quantity is concentration, given here as $\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$.\nLet the susceptibility of the bacterium to the drug be quantified by the minimum inhibitory concentration, denoted by $\\mathrm{MIC}$. The unit of this quantity is also concentration, given here as $\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$.\n\nTo form a dimensionless index, one must take a ratio of two quantities that possess the same physical dimensions. The relationship described—\"peak concentration relative to the MIC\"—mathematically implies a ratio. The appropriate dimensionless index, let us call it $I$, is therefore the ratio of the maximum concentration to the minimum inhibitory concentration.\n\n$$I = \\frac{C_{\\max}}{\\mathrm{MIC}}$$\n\nThis index represents how many times the peak drug concentration exceeds the minimum concentration required to inhibit the growth of the infecting organism.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$C_{\\max} = 2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n$\\mathrm{MIC} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for the index $I$. The cancellation of units is shown explicitly:\n\n$$I = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}}$$\n\nThe units $\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out, confirming that the index $I$ is indeed dimensionless.\n\n$$I = \\frac{2}{0.25} = 8$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $8$ can be expressed as $8.00$ to meet this requirement.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Assessment of Target Attainment**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a qualitative assessment of whether PK/PD target attainment is likely. This requires comparing the calculated PK/PD index to established thresholds that correlate with clinical and microbiological success.\n\nFor concentration-dependent antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, a large body of preclinical and clinical evidence has established that a $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ ratio of approximately $10$ to $12$ or greater is typically required for rapid bactericidal activity and to minimize the selection of resistant subpopulations. We will adopt the conservative and widely accepted target of $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC} \\ge 10$ as our assumption for assessing success.\n\nThe calculated index for this patient is:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\max}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} = 8.00$$\n\nWe compare this value to the therapeutic target:\n$$8.00 < 10$$\n\nThe calculated $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ ratio of $8.00$ is below the accepted target threshold of $\\ge 10$. Therefore, based on these well-tested PK/PD principles, target attainment is not likely. This dosing regimen may be insufficient to produce a rapid bactericidal effect and carries a higher risk of clinical failure or the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The therapy may be suboptimal for this specific pathogen, despite the organism being classified as \"susceptible\" based on the MIC value alone.",
