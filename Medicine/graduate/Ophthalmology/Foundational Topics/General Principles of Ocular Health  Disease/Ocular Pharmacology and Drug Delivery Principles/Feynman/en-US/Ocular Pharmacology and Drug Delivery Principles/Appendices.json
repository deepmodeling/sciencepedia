Assume one-dimensional diffusion normal to the surface and identical cross-sectional area across corneal layers. The cornea is modeled as three layers in series: epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. For each isolated layer, the permeability coefficient is defined by $P_i = K_i D_i / h_i$, where $K_i$ is the partition coefficient into the layer, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient within the layer, and $h_i$ is the layer thickness.

This is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables to solve for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the concentration at any time $t$, we integrate both sides.

Drug transport within this medium is slow and dominated by molecular diffusion. Elimination of large molecules like ranibizumab (a monoclonal antibody fragment) from the vitreous occurs primarily via two slow, diffusion-limited pathways: an anterior route into the aqueous humor and a posterior route across the retina into the systemic (choroidal) circulation.\n\nPars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) is a surgical procedure where the vitreous gel is removed and replaced with a simple aqueous solution, such as a balanced salt solution. This fundamentally alters the fluid dynamics of the vitreous cavity.\n\n1.  **Change in Transport Mechanism:** The primary change is the shift from a diffusion-dominated environment to a convection-dominated one. The low viscosity of the aqueous replacement fluid allows for much greater bulk fluid movement (convection) driven by physiological eye movements (saccades). Convection is a significantly more efficient mechanism for mass transport over macroscopic distances (i.e., the scale of the vitreous cavity) than diffusion.\n\n2.  **Impact on Elimination:** This enhanced convection rapidly transports the drug molecules from the center of the vitreous cavity to the elimination boundaries (the retina-choroid-sclera interface posteriorly and the aqueous humor anteriorly). By removing the rate-limiting step of slow diffusion through the gel, PPV drastically accelerates the rate at which the drug is cleared from the eye.\n\n3.  **Effect on the Elimination Rate Constant ($k$):** The elimination rate constant $k$ is a measure of the fractional rate of drug removal. Since PPV significantly accelerates the drug removal process, the value of $k$ is expected to **increase substantially** in a vitrectomized eye compared to a non-vitrectomized eye.\n\n4.  **Influence on Dosing Intervals:** The half-life, $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$, is inversely proportional to the elimination rate constant $k$. A higher $k$ results in a shorter $t_{1/2}$. This means the drug is eliminated more quickly. The therapeutic objective is to maintain the drug concentration above a certain minimum effective or trough concentration. With a shorter half-life, the drug concentration will fall below this therapeutic threshold more rapidly. Therefore, to maintain therapeutic efficacy in a vitrectomized eye, the **dosing interval between injections must be shortened**.\n\nIn summary, based on first principles of fluid dynamics and mass transport, a PPV increases the elimination rate constant $k$ by replacing a diffusive medium with a convective one, which in turn decreases the drug's half-life and necessitates more frequent dosing to maintain a target trough concentration.",
