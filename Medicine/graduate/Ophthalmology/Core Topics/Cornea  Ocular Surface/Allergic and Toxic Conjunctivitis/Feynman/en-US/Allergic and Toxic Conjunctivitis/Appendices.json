            "problem": "A patient with chronic allergic and toxic conjunctivitis is prescribed a topical solution containing Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK) at a labeled concentration of $0.01\\%$ weight by volume. The patient instills one drop of the solution, with volume $30~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ per drop, three times daily in a single eye. Assume complete ocular surface retention for each instillation (that is, no loss to blinking or nasolacrimal drainage). Using the fundamental definition of concentration as mass per unit volume and the conventional interpretation of percentage weight by volume ($1\\%~\\mathrm{w/v}$ means $1~\\mathrm{g}$ of solute per $100~\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution), derive the cumulative daily BAK exposure in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nExpress your final answer in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to calculate the cumulative daily exposure to Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK), denoted as $M_{daily}$, in units of milligrams per day ($\\mathrm{mg/day}$). The calculation is based on the fundamental relationship between mass, concentration, and volume.\n\nThe cumulative daily exposure is the product of the solution's concentration and the total volume of the solution administered per day.\nLet $C$ be the concentration of BAK in the solution, $V_{drop}$ be the volume of a single drop, and $N$ be the number of instillations per day.\n\nFirst, we must determine the concentration $C$ in units that are convenient for calculation, specifically $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. The labeled concentration is given as $0.01\\%$ weight by volume ($\\mathrm{w/v}$). The problem states that $1\\%~\\mathrm{w/v}$ corresponds to $1~\\mathrm{g}$ of solute per $100~\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution.\nTherefore, a concentration of $0.01\\%~\\mathrm{w/v}$ is equivalent to:\n$$ C = 0.01 \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} $$\nTo convert this to $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$, we use the conversion factor $1~\\mathrm{g} = 1000~\\mathrm{mg}$:\n$$ C = \\frac{0.01~\\mathrm{g}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mathrm{mg}}{1~\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{10~\\mathrm{mg}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.1~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of the solution administered per day, $V_{daily}$. The patient instills one drop three times daily. The volume of a single drop is given as $V_{drop} = 30~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$, and the number of instillations is $N=3$.\nThe total daily volume is:\n$$ V_{daily} = N \\times V_{drop} = 3 \\times 30~\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 90~\\mu\\mathrm{L} $$\nTo ensure unit consistency with the concentration, we convert this volume from microliters ($\\mu\\mathrm{L}$) to milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$), using the conversion factor $1~\\mathrm{mL} = 1000~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$:\n$$ V_{daily} = 90~\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times \\frac{1~\\mathrm{mL}}{1000~\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 0.09~\\mathrm{mL} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the cumulative daily mass exposure, $M_{daily}$, by multiplying the concentration $C$ by the total daily volume $V_{daily}$. The problem assumes complete retention, so we use the full calculated volume.\n$$ M_{daily} = C \\times V_{daily} $$\nSubstituting the values we derived:\n$$ M_{daily} = \\left(0.1~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) \\times \\left(0.09~\\mathrm{mL}\\right) = 0.009~\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe resulting unit is milligrams per day ($\\mathrm{mg/day}$).\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.009$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.00900$. In scientific notation, this is $9.00 \\times 10^{-3}$.",

This practice applies Bayes' theorem to a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating how to update your diagnostic certainty for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis ($VKC$) after receiving a positive biomarker result .

Literature supports that, in this diagnostic context, the test’s sensitivity is $0.85$ and specificity is $0.80$. The test result returns positive. Using only the foundational definitions of conditional probability, the meaning of sensitivity and specificity, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the posterior probability that the patient has VKC given the positive tear ECP result.

            "solution": "Let $V$ be the event that the patient has Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).\nLet $V^c$ be the event that the patient does not have VKC.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The pretest probability of VKC is the prior probability, $P(V) = 0.30$.\n- The probability of not having VKC is therefore $P(V^c) = 1 - P(V) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+ | V) = 0.85$. This is the true positive rate.\n- Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^- | V^c) = 0.80$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability that the patient has VKC given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(V | T^+)$.\n\nWe begin from the foundational definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{P(V \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(V \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having VKC and testing positive, and $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nFirst, we express the numerator, $P(V \\cap T^+)$, using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+|V)$:\n$$P(T^+ | V) = \\frac{P(V \\cap T^+)}{P(V)}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$P(V \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | V) P(V)$$\nThese are the probabilities of true positive cases among the entire population.\n\nNext, we evaluate the denominator, $P(T^+)$, using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1. The patient has VKC and tests positive (a true positive). The probability for this is $P(V \\cap T^+)$.\n2. The patient does not have VKC and tests positive (a false positive). The probability for this is $P(V^c \\cap T^+)$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(T^+) = P(V \\cap T^+) + P(V^c \\cap T^+)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability as before, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | V) P(V) + P(T^+ | V^c) P(V^c)$$\n\nWe have the values for $P(T^+ | V)$, $P(V)$, and $P(V^c)$. We must determine $P(T^+ | V^c)$, which is the false positive rate. This is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease. It is the complement of the specificity (the true negative rate, $P(T^- | V^c)$):\n$$P(T^+ | V^c) = 1 - P(T^- | V^c) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\n\nNow, we substitute all these components back into the original expression for $P(V | T^+)$. This reconstruction is Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | V) P(V)}{P(T^+ | V) P(V) + P(T^+ | V^c) P(V^c)}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$P(V) = 0.30$$\n$$P(V^c) = 0.70$$\n$$P(T^+ | V) = 0.85$$\n$$P(T^+ | V^c) = 0.20$$\n\nThe posterior probability is:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (0.20)(0.70)}$$\nWe calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nNumerator:\n$$P(V \\cap T^+) = (0.85)(0.30) = 0.255$$\nDenominator:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.30) + (0.20)(0.70) = 0.255 + 0.140 = 0.395$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{0.255}{0.395}$$\n$$P(V | T^+) \\approx 0.64556962...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
