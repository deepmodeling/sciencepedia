            "problem": "A patient with intermittent outward deviation of the eyes is evaluated for distance and near angles using prism cover testing, reported in prism diopters (prism diopter, $\\Delta$). Intermittent exotropia variants are classically distinguished by the relation between the distance angle and near angle and by the effect of brief monocular occlusion. You are given three measurements: a pre-occlusion distance angle of $30\\,\\Delta$, a pre-occlusion near angle of $10\\,\\Delta$, and a post-occlusion near angle of $28\\,\\Delta$ after monocular occlusion of one eye for $30$ minutes. Based solely on the measurements and fundamental definitions of convergence mechanisms, select the most accurate classification and the mechanism that explains the change in the near angle.\n\nUse the following fundamental base to guide your reasoning:\n- A prism diopter ($\\Delta$) is defined such that a ray is deviated by $1$ centimeter at a distance of $1$ meter.\n- Intermittent exotropia is categorized by the relative magnitudes of the distance and near deviations and by the effect of monocular occlusion on the near deviation. The categories include basic exotropia (distance $\\approx$ near), divergence excess exotropia (distance $$ near), convergence insufficiency exotropia (near $$ distance), and simulated or pseudo-divergence excess exotropia (apparent distance $$ near that equalizes after occlusion).\n- Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio is defined as the amount of convergence (in prism diopters or meter-angles) induced per diopter of accommodation. A high AC/A ratio increases convergence at near for a given accommodative demand, potentially reducing a near exodeviation. Proximal and fusional convergence can mask the near deviation and may be disrupted by monocular occlusion.\n\nWhich option best classifies the variant and justifies the mechanism producing the change?\n\nA. True divergence excess intermittent exotropia due to a high Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio reducing near deviation; monocular occlusion reduces accommodation, increasing the near angle.\n\nB. Convergence insufficiency exotropia due to low fusional convergence at near; monocular occlusion breaks fusion reserves at near, increasing the near angle above the distance angle.\n\nC. Basic intermittent exotropia with normal Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio; monocular occlusion does not meaningfully alter the near deviation when distance and near are initially different.\n\nD. Simulated (pseudo-) divergence excess intermittent exotropia; tenacious proximal fusion at near initially masks the true near angle, and monocular occlusion disrupts this fusion, revealing a near deviation that approximates the distance deviation.",
            "solution": "From the fundamental definitions, the categorization depends on comparing the distance and near prism cover test measurements and understanding how monocular occlusion affects the near measurement. The given values are a pre-occlusion distance angle of $30\\,\\Delta$, a pre-occlusion near angle of $10\\,\\Delta$, and a post-occlusion near angle of $28\\,\\Delta$.\n\nStep $1$: Compare pre-occlusion distance and near angles. The distance angle is $30\\,\\Delta$ and the near angle is $10\\,\\Delta$. Therefore, distance $$ near by $20\\,\\Delta$, which is a large distance-near discrepancy.\n\nStep $2$: Interpret the effect of monocular occlusion. After $30$ minutes of monocular occlusion, the near angle increases from $10\\,\\Delta$ to $28\\,\\Delta$, which is now within $2\\,\\Delta$ of the distance angle. This equalization indicates that the initially small near angle was masked by convergence mechanisms that were disrupted by occlusion.\n\nStep $3$: Use mechanistic definitions. A high Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio implies that at near, increased accommodation produces more convergence, thereby reducing an exodeviation at near relative to distance. However, monocular occlusion does not directly reduce the accommodative demand when the patient views a near target; the viewing eye still needs to accommodate for the near task. Instead, monocular occlusion breaks binocular fusion and proximal convergence (awareness of near target and binocular alignment), including what has been termed tenacious proximal fusion (TPF), thereby revealing the dissociated near angle. In simulated (pseudo-) divergence excess exotropia, the apparent large distance-near discrepancy disappears after occlusion, with near increasing to approximate distance. In true divergence excess exotropia driven by high AC/A ratio, the near angle remains substantially smaller even after occlusion because the accommodative demand and the high AC/A-induced convergence persist.\n\nApplying these principles to the given data, the pattern (distance $30\\,\\Delta$, near pre-occlusion $10\\,\\Delta$, near post-occlusion $28\\,\\Delta$) is characteristic of simulated (pseudo-) divergence excess intermittent exotropia, explained by occlusion disrupting tenacious proximal fusion and fusional convergence that had reduced the apparent near exodeviation.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. True divergence excess intermittent exotropia due to a high Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio reducing near deviation; monocular occlusion reduces accommodation, increasing the near angle. Verdict: Incorrect. While true divergence excess can feature distance $$ near due to high AC/A ratio, monocular occlusion does not necessarily reduce the accommodative demand during near fixation with the viewing eye; the near target still requires accommodation. In true divergence excess, the near angle typically remains smaller even after occlusion. The marked increase of the near angle from $10\\,\\Delta$ to $28\\,\\Delta$ contradicts the expected persistence of a smaller near deviation in true divergence excess.\n\nB. Convergence insufficiency exotropia due to low fusional convergence at near; monocular occlusion breaks fusion reserves at near, increasing the near angle above the distance angle. Verdict: Incorrect. Convergence insufficiency exotropia is defined by near $$ distance at baseline. Here, near is $10\\,\\Delta$ compared to distance $30\\,\\Delta$ at baseline, which is the opposite pattern. Furthermore, the post-occlusion near angle ($28\\,\\Delta$) does not exceed the distance angle; it approximates it. The mechanism described does not match the observed data.\n\nC. Basic intermittent exotropia with normal Accommodation Convergence per Accommodation (AC/A) ratio; monocular occlusion does not meaningfully alter the near deviation when distance and near are initially different. Verdict: Incorrect. Basic intermittent exotropia is characterized by distance $\\approx$ near at baseline, which is not the case here (distance $30\\,\\Delta$ versus near $10\\,\\Delta$). Additionally, the substantial change in near deviation after occlusion is not characteristic of basic exotropia.\n\nD. Simulated (pseudo-) divergence excess intermittent exotropia; tenacious proximal fusion at near initially masks the true near angle, and monocular occlusion disrupts this fusion, revealing a near deviation that approximates the distance deviation. Verdict: Correct. The large pre-occlusion distance-near discrepancy (distance $30\\,\\Delta$, near $10\\,\\Delta$) that nearly disappears after occlusion (near increases to $28\\,\\Delta$) is the defining feature of pseudo-divergence excess. The mechanism is disruption of tenacious proximal fusion and fusional convergence by occlusion, revealing the true near deviation that approximates the distance deviation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate classification and mechanism are given in option D.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective question within the field of clinical optics and ophthalmology. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to calculate the resultant near deviation of a patient with exotropia after the introduction of spherical plus lenses. This requires a step-by-step application of the principles of accommodation and accommodative convergence.\n\nLet the baseline near exodeviation be $\\Delta_{\\text{near},0} = 20\\ \\Delta$.\nLet the fixation distance be $d = 33\\ \\text{cm}$, which is equivalent to $d = \\frac{1}{3}\\ \\text{m}$.\nLet the accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio be notated as $k_{AC/A} = 4\\ \\Delta/\\text{D}$.\nLet the power of the added spherical plus lenses be $P_{\\text{lens}} = +3.00\\ \\text{D}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial accommodative stimulus, $A_{s,0}$, required for the patient to focus on the target at distance $d$. The accommodative stimulus, measured in diopters ($D$), is defined as the reciprocal of the viewing distance in meters ($m$).\n$$A_{s,0} = \\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}\\ \\text{m}} = 3\\ \\text{D}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the new accommodative stimulus, $A_{s,1}$, when the patient fixates on the same target while looking through the $+3.00\\ \\text{D}$ lenses. A plus lens provides focusing power, thereby reducing the amount of accommodation the patient's own crystalline lens must exert. The new stimulus is the original stimulus minus the power of the lens.\n$$A_{s,1} = A_{s,0} - P_{\\text{lens}} = 3\\ \\text{D} - 3.00\\ \\text{D} = 0\\ \\text{D}$$\nAn accommodative stimulus of $0\\ \\text{D}$ means that the patient's accommodative system is fully relaxed, as if viewing a target at optical infinity.\n\nThe problem states that the accommodative response is equal to the accommodative stimulus. Therefore, the change in the patient's accommodation, $\\Delta A$, is equal to the change in the accommodative stimulus.\n$$\\Delta A = A_{s,1} - A_{s,0} = 0\\ \\text{D} - 3\\ \\text{D} = -3\\ \\text{D}$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates a relaxation of accommodation.\n\nThe AC/A ratio, $k_{AC/A}$, quantifies the change in accommodative convergence, $\\Delta C_A$, that occurs for a given change in accommodation, $\\Delta A$. Their relationship is:\n$$\\Delta C_A = k_{AC/A} \\times \\Delta A$$\nWe can now substitute the known values to find the change in accommodative convergence.\n$$\\Delta C_A = (4\\ \\Delta/\\text{D}) \\times (-3\\ \\text{D}) = -12\\ \\Delta$$\nThe result, $-12\\ \\Delta$, represents a decrease in convergence of $12\\ \\Delta$. A decrease in convergence is equivalent to an increase in divergence.\n\nThe final near deviation, $\\Delta_{\\text{near,final}}$, is the initial deviation plus the change in deviation induced by the lenses. The patient has a baseline exodeviation (a form of divergence). The calculated change is a further divergence of $12\\ \\Delta$. Therefore, the magnitude of the final exodeviation will be the sum of the initial magnitude and the magnitude of the induced divergence.\nLet us adopt a sign convention where exodeviations are positive. The initial deviation is $+20\\ \\Delta$. A change in convergence of $-12\\ \\Delta$ means the deviation changes by $-(-12\\ \\Delta) = +12\\ \\Delta$.\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{near,final}} = \\Delta_{\\text{near},0} - \\Delta C_A$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{near,final}} = 20\\ \\Delta - (-12\\ \\Delta) = 20\\ \\Delta + 12\\ \\Delta = 32\\ \\Delta$$\nThe resultant near deviation is an exodeviation of $32\\ \\Delta$. The problem asks for the magnitude, which is a single real number. The value is exact, so no rounding is necessary.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe solution will be derived from the foundational principles provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet $C$ represent the surgical correction in units of prism diopters ($\\Delta$).\nLet $d$ represent the amount of muscle recession in millimeters ($\\text{mm}$).\nLet $k$ represent the dose-response constant, which is the correction in prism diopters per millimeter of recession ($\\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}$).\n\nThe first principle states a linear dose-response relationship for a single muscle. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$C_i = k \\cdot d_i$$\nwhere the subscript $i$ denotes a specific muscle.\n\nThe second principle states that for a surgery involving multiple muscles, the total correction, $C_{total}$, is the linear sum of the individual corrections:\n$$C_{total} = \\sum_i C_i$$\n\nThe problem describes a bilateral surgery, meaning two muscles are operated on: the left lateral rectus and the right lateral rectus. Let's denote them as muscle $1$ and muscle $2$. The total correction is therefore:\n$$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$$\n\nThe surgery consists of equal recessions on both muscles. Let this recession amount be $d$. So, $d_1 = d_2 = d$. The dose-response constant $k$ is the same for both lateral rectus muscles. The expression for the total correction becomes:\n$$C_{total} = (k \\cdot d_1) + (k \\cdot d_2) = k \\cdot d + k \\cdot d = 2kd$$\nThis is the general expression for the total expected correction produced by operating on two muscles with equal recessions $d$ and the same dose-response constant $k$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for this specific case. The given values are:\n- Dose-response constant, $k = 2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}$.\n- Recession amount for each muscle, $d = 7\\ \\text{mm}$.\n- Number of muscles, $N=2$.\n\nUsing the derived expression:\n$$C_{total} = 2 \\cdot \\left(2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}\\right) \\cdot (7\\ \\text{mm})$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the numerical values:\n$$2 \\times 2.5 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7 = 35$$\nThe units cancel as follows: $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}} \\times \\text{mm} = \\Delta$.\nSo, the total expected correction is:\n$$C_{total} = 35\\ \\Delta$$\n\nAlternatively, one can calculate the correction for a single muscle first:\n$$C_{single} = k \\cdot d = 2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}} \\times 7\\ \\text{mm} = 17.5\\ \\Delta$$\nApplying the principle of linear additivity for the bilateral procedure:\n$$C_{total} = C_{left} + C_{right} = 17.5\\ \\Delta + 17.5\\ \\Delta = 35\\ \\Delta$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks to compare this expected correction to the preoperative deviation to assess the adequacy of the surgical plan.\n- Preoperative exotropia, $X_{preop} = 35\\ \\Delta$.\n- Expected surgical correction, $C_{total} = 35\\ \\Delta$.\n\nThe expected correction $C_{total}$ is exactly equal to the magnitude of the preoperative deviation $X_{preop}$. This implies that, according to the linear additive model, the planned surgery is of adequate magnitude to fully correct the patient's exotropia, with an expected postoperative alignment of $0\\ \\Delta$ (a state known as orthotropia).",
