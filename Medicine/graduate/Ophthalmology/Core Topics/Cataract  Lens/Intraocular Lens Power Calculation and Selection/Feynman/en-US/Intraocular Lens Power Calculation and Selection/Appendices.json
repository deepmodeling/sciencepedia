            "problem": "A patient seeks micro-monovision after cataract surgery, with the dominant eye targeted for plano at the spectacle plane and the non-dominant eye targeted for mild myopia. Biometry yields a common axial length of both eyes of $23.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, a corneal power (anterior corneal surface acting as a thin lens) of $43.25\\ \\mathrm{D}$ at the corneal plane, and the refractive index of the aqueous/vitreous media of $1.336$.

            "solution": "The user wants me to validate and solve a problem in ophthalmic optics concerning the calculation of an intraocular lens (IOL) power.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Model:** A reduced-eye model. The cornea and IOL are treated as a single thin lens assembly at the corneal plane.\n-   **Methodology:** Gaussian paraxial optics, vergence, and vertex conversion.\n-   **Axial Length (AL):** $23.50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n-   **Corneal Power (K):** $43.25\\ \\mathrm{D}$\n-   **Aqueous/Vitreous Refractive Index (n):** $1.336$\n-   **Object Space Refractive Index:** Air, $n_{air} = 1.0$ (assumed)\n-   **Target Postoperative Refraction at Spectacle Plane ($R_{spec}$):** $-0.75\\ \\mathrm{D}$\n-   **Vertex Distance (vd):** $12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the fundamental principles of Gaussian optics applied to a standard, simplified model of the eye (the reduced eye). The provided values for axial length, corneal power, and refractive index are within the normal physiological range. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique value for the IOL power under the specified model. The language is objective and precise. No flaws, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity, are present. The \"thin lenses acting at the corneal plane\" is an explicit simplification for the model, making the problem self-contained and solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the intraocular lens (IOL) power, $P_{IOL}$, for the non-dominant eye to achieve a specific postsurgical refractive error. We will use a simplified reduced-eye model where a single thin lens, representing the combined power of the cornea and the IOL, is located at the corneal plane.\n\nThe total power of this equivalent lens, $P_{eye}$, is the sum of the corneal power, $K$, and the IOL power, $P_{IOL}$:\n$$P_{eye} = K + P_{IOL}$$\nThe refractive state of an eye is defined by the correction required to focus light from an object at optical infinity onto the retina. Let $R_{cornea}$ be the required refractive correction at the corneal plane. For light from infinity to be focused on the retina, its vergence must be transformed by the total optical system of the eye. The vergence of light from an object at infinity is $U = 0$. After being corrected by a lens of power $R_{cornea}$ at the corneal plane, the vergence becomes $U' = U + R_{cornea} = R_{cornea}$. This light then enters the eye's optical system, which has a power $P_{eye}$. The final vergence, $V$, is given by the thin lens equation:\n$$V = U' + P_{eye} = R_{cornea} + P_{eye}$$\nFor the image to be focused on the retina, which is at a distance $AL$ from the corneal plane inside a medium of refractive index $n$, the final vergence must be:\n$$V = \\frac{n}{AL}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $V$, we establish the governing equation for the system:\n$$\\frac{n}{AL} = R_{cornea} + P_{eye}$$\nSubstituting $P_{eye} = K + P_{IOL}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{n}{AL} = R_{cornea} + K + P_{IOL}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the required IOL power, $P_{IOL}$:\n$$P_{IOL} = \\frac{n}{AL} - K - R_{cornea}$$\nThe problem provides the target refraction at the spectacle plane, $R_{spec} = -0.75\\ \\mathrm{D}$, which is located at a vertex distance $vd = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ from the cornea. We must convert this spectacle-plane refraction to its equivalent at the corneal plane, $R_{cornea}$. The relationship is given by the vertex correction formula:\n$$R_{cornea} = \\frac{R_{spec}}{1 - vd \\cdot R_{spec}}$$\nIt is crucial to use consistent units. We will convert the vertex distance to meters: $vd = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.012\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $R_{cornea}$:\n$$R_{cornea} = \\frac{-0.75\\ \\mathrm{D}}{1 - (0.012\\ \\mathrm{m})(-0.75\\ \\mathrm{D})} = \\frac{-0.75}{1 + 0.009} = \\frac{-0.75}{1.009}\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n$$R_{cornea} \\approx -0.7433102\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nNext, we calculate the term $\\frac{n}{AL}$, which represents the total power an emmetropic eye with this axial length would require. The axial length must also be in meters: $AL = 23.50\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.02350\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\frac{n}{AL} = \\frac{1.336}{0.02350\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 56.851064\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nNow, we substitute all the known values into the equation for $P_{IOL}$:\n$$P_{IOL} \\approx 56.851064\\ \\mathrm{D} - 43.25\\ \\mathrm{D} - (-0.7433102\\ \\mathrm{D})$$\n$$P_{IOL} \\approx (13.601064 + 0.7433102)\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n$$P_{IOL} \\approx 14.3443742\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is a $4$, so we round down.\n$$P_{IOL} \\approx 14.34\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThis is the power of the intraocular lens that should be implanted in the non-dominant eye to achieve the target postoperative refraction of $-0.75\\ \\mathrm{D}$ at the spectacle plane.",

It describes a standard clinical calculation in ophthalmology for planning toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The vector analysis method using double-angle plots is a fundamental and widely accepted technique for combining astigmatic components. The given values are clinically realistic.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the vector analysis framework provided. The goal is to determine the net corneal astigmatism after surgery, which is the vector sum of the preoperative astigmatism and the surgically induced astigmatism (SIA). The magnitude of this net astigmatism represents the amount of astigmatic correction the toric IOL must provide at the corneal plane.\n\nFirst, we represent the preoperative corneal astigmatism as a vector, $\\vec{V}_{\\mathrm{pre}}$. The givens are the magnitude $C_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 1.50\\ \\mathrm{D}$ and the axis $a_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 90^{\\circ}$. The components of this vector, $V_{x,\\mathrm{pre}}$ and $V_{y,\\mathrm{pre}}$, are calculated using the provided double-angle formulas:\n$$\nV_{x,\\mathrm{pre}} = C_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\cos(2 a_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = 1.50 \\cos(2 \\times 90^{\\circ}) = 1.50 \\cos(180^{\\circ})\n$$\nSince $\\cos(180^{\\circ}) = -1$, the x-component is:\n$$\nV_{x,\\mathrm{pre}} = 1.50 \\times (-1) = -1.50\n$$\nThe y-component is:\n$$\nV_{y,\\mathrm{pre}} = C_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\sin(2 a_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = 1.50 \\sin(2 \\times 90^{\\circ}) = 1.50 \\sin(180^{\\circ})\n$$\nSince $\\sin(180^{\\circ}) = 0$, the y-component is:\n$$\nV_{y,\\mathrm{pre}} = 1.50 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, the vector for the preoperative astigmatism is $\\vec{V}_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1.50 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNext, we represent the surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) as a vector, $\\vec{V}_{\\mathrm{SIA}}$. The givens are the magnitude $C_{\\mathrm{SIA}} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{D}$ and the axis $a_{\\mathrm{SIA}} = 180^{\\circ}$.

This indicates that the resulting astigmatism is purely \"with-the-rule\", as its vector representation lies entirely on the negative x-axis of the double-angle plot.\n\nFinally, we calculate the magnitude of the net astigmatism, $C_{\\mathrm{net}}$, which is the required cylinder power for the toric IOL at the corneal plane.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\sqrt{V_{x,\\mathrm{net}}^{2} + V_{y,\\mathrm{net}}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated component values:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\sqrt{(-1.30)^{2} + (0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{1.69} = 1.30\n$$\nThe magnitude of the net astigmatism is $1.30\\ \\mathrm{D}$.

Its minimum can be found by analyzing its derivative with respect to $c$. The derivative of the absolute value function $|x|$ is $\\text{sgn}(x)$ for $x \\neq 0$, where $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function. The derivative of $S(c)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i - c| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{d}{dc} |e_i - c|\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dc}|u(c)| = u'(c) \\cdot \\text{sgn}(u(c))$, where $u(c) = e_i - c$ and $u'(c) = -1$.

At all other points, $\\text{sgn}(e_i - c)$ is either $+1$ (if $e_i > c$) or $-1$ (if $e_i < c$). The minimum of the convex function $S(c)$ occurs where its derivative is zero or changes sign from negative to positive. Setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{sgn}(e_i - c) = 0\n$$\nThis condition implies that the number of data points $e_i$ greater than $c$ must equal the number of data points less than $c$.
