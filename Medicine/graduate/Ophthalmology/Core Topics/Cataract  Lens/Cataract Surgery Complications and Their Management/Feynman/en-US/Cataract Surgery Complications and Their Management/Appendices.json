It presents a standard dilution calculation problem set in a realistic clinical context, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles.\n\nThe task is to derive the relationship for a dilution calculation and then to compute a specific volume. The derivation must start from two fundamental principles: the definition of concentration and the conservation of solute mass.\n\nLet us define the variables for the initial (stock) solution and the final (diluted) solution.\nFor the stock solution:\nLet $C_1$ be the concentration of the stock cefuroxime solution.\nLet $V_1$ be the volume of the stock solution that must be withdrawn.\nLet $m_1$ be the mass of the solute (cefuroxime) in the volume $V_1$.\n\nFor the final diluted solution:\nLet $C_2$ be the concentration of the final cefuroxime solution.\nLet $V_2$ be the total volume of the final solution.\nLet $m_2$ be the mass of the solute (cefuroxime) in the volume $V_2$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n$C_1 = 100$ mg/mL\n$C_2 = 10$ mg/mL\n$V_2 = 5$ mL\n\nThe first principle is the definition of concentration ($C$) as the mass of solute ($m$) per unit volume of solution ($V$):\n$$C = \\frac{m}{V}$$\nFrom this definition, the mass of the solute can be expressed as the product of its concentration and volume:\n$$m = C \\cdot V$$\nApplying this to our specific case, we can write expressions for the mass of cefuroxime in the stock volume to be used and in the final prepared volume:\n$$m_1 = C_1 V_1$$\n$$m_2 = C_2 V_2$$\n\nThe second principle is the conservation of solute mass during dilution. When the stock solution is diluted with a sterile diluent, the amount (mass) of the solute (cefuroxime) remains unchanged. The mass of cefuroxime taken from the stock solution is the same mass that is present in the final diluted solution. Therefore, we can state:\n$$m_1 = m_2$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $m_1$ and $m_2$ into the conservation of mass equation, we derive the required relationship:\n$$C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2$$\nThis equation is the general formula for dilution calculations, derived as requested from first principles.\n\nThe problem asks for the volume of the stock solution, $V_1$, that must be withdrawn. We can rearrange the derived relationship to solve for $V_1$:\n$$V_1 = \\frac{C_2 V_2}{C_1}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation to calculate the volume $V_1$.\nThe values are:\n$C_1 = 100$ mg/mL\n$C_2 = 10$ mg/mL\n$V_2 = 5$ mL\n\nSubstituting these values yields:\n$$V_1 = \\frac{(10 \\text{ mg/mL}) \\cdot (5 \\text{ mL})}{100 \\text{ mg/mL}}$$\nThe units of mg/mL in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the result in mL, which is dimensionally correct for a volume.\n$$V_1 = \\frac{50}{100} \\text{ mL}$$\n$$V_1 = 0.5 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThus, the volume of the $100$ mg/mL stock solution that must be withdrawn is $0.5$ mL. This volume would then be mixed with a sterile diluent (such as sterile water for injection or balanced salt solution) to a total final volume of $5$ mL to achieve the desired concentration of $10$ mg/mL. The volume of the diluent to be added would be $V_2 - V_1 = 5 \\text{ mL} - 0.5 \\text{ mL} = 4.5 \\text{ mL}$.",

A complete and reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the necessary change in the intraocular lens (IOL) power, denoted as $\\Delta P_{IOL}$, to correct a postoperative hyperopic refractive error. The solution involves a two-step process based on the principles of vergence transfer.\n\nFirst, we must determine the magnitude of the refractive error at the corneal plane. The given manifest refraction, $P_{spec} = +1.25$ D, is measured at the spectacle plane, which is located at a vertex distance $d = 12$ mm from the cornea. This spectacle correction lens works by placing its secondary focal point at the far point of the eye. The equivalent power required at the corneal plane, $P_{cornea}$, must also have its focal point at the same location in space.\n\nThe relationship between the power of a lens at the spectacle plane ($P_{spec}$) and its equivalent power at the corneal plane ($P_{cornea}$) is given by the vertex distance formula. The medium between the spectacle and the cornea is air, with a refractive index $n_{air} = 1.000$. The distances must be in meters for calculations with diopters (D), where $1$ D $= 1$ m$^{-1}$. Thus, $d = 12$ mm $= 0.012$ m.\n\n$$P_{cornea} = \\frac{P_{spec}}{1 - d \\cdot P_{spec}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{cornea} = \\frac{+1.25}{1 - (0.012)(1.25)} = \\frac{1.25}{1 - 0.015} = \\frac{1.25}{0.985} \\text{ D}$$\n\nThis value, $P_{cornea}$, represents the required dioptric correction at the corneal plane to achieve emmetropia. Since the eye is hyperopic (positive correction), this is the amount of additional power the eye's optical system is lacking, as referenced to the corneal plane.\n\nSecond, we must determine the change in IOL power, $\\Delta P_{IOL}$, that will produce this desired effect of adding $P_{cornea}$ diopters of power at the corneal plane. The IOL is located at the effective lens position (ELP), which is a distance $e = 5.2$ mm $= 0.0052$ m posterior to the cornea. The medium between the cornea and the IOL is the aqueous humor, with a refractive index of $n = 1.336$.\n\nThis calculation is another application of vergence transfer, relating the power of a correcting element at one plane (the IOL) to its effective power at another plane (the cornea). We can derive this relationship by considering the vergence error. A refractive error of $P_{cornea}$ at the corneal plane corresponds to an outgoing vergence of $V_{cornea} = -P_{cornea}$ for light originating from the retina. We can trace this vergence back to the IOL plane using the formula for vergence transfer over a reduced distance $e/n$:\n\n$$V_{IOL} = \\frac{V_{cornea}}{1 + (e/n)V_{cornea}}$$\n\nHere, $V_{IOL}$ is the vergence error at the IOL plane. Substituting $V_{cornea} = -P_{cornea}$:\n\n$$V_{IOL} = \\frac{-P_{cornea}}{1 + (e/n)(-P_{cornea})} = \\frac{-P_{cornea}}{1 - (e/n)P_{cornea}}$$\n\nTo nullify this vergence error at the IOL plane, the power of the IOL must be changed by an amount $\\Delta P_{IOL} = -V_{IOL}$.\n\n$$\\Delta P_{IOL} = - \\left( \\frac{-P_{cornea}}{1 - (e/n)P_{cornea}} \\right) = \\frac{P_{cornea}}{1 - (e/n)P_{cornea}}$$\n\nThis formula gives the required change in IOL power. A positive value for $\\Delta P_{IOL}$ indicates an increase in the IOL's power, consistent with the problem's sign convention and the need to correct a hyperopic error.\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $P_{cornea}$ and the given values for $e$ and $n$ to find the final numerical answer.\n\n$$P_{cornea} = \\frac{1.25}{0.985} \\text{ D} \\approx 1.2690355 \\text{ D}$$\n\n$$\\Delta P_{IOL} = \\frac{\\frac{1.25}{0.985}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.0052}{1.336}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1.25}{0.985}\\right)}$$\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n$$ \\frac{e}{n} = \\frac{0.0052}{1.336} \\approx 0.0038922 \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{e}{n}\\right) P_{cornea} \\approx (0.0038922) \\cdot (1.2690355) \\approx 0.0049378 $$\n$$ 1 - \\left(\\frac{e}{n}\\right) P_{cornea} \\approx 1 - 0.0049378 = 0.9950622 $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{IOL} \\approx \\frac{1.2690355}{0.9950622} \\approx 1.275335 \\text{ D} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta P_{IOL} \\approx 1.28 \\text{ D} $$\nThis indicates that the power of the implanted IOL must be increased by approximately $1.28$ diopters to render the patient emmetropic.",
