Epiretinal traction generates measurable tangential shear on the inner retinal surface.\n2. OCT backscatter intensity reflects microstructural composition.\n\n**Case X Data:**\n- Age: $67$ years\n- Complaint: metamorphopsia\n- Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): $20/40$\n- En face OCT: radially oriented, hyperreflective striae centered on the fovea with perimacular vessel kinking and surface wrinkling.\n- B-scan OCT: a thin, highly reflective linear structure along the ILM with focal points of adherence and subtle retinal plication; a lamellar foveal defect with steep, sharp edges and intraretinal schisis predominantly in the inner retinal layers; the outer nuclear layer is relatively preserved and the ellipsoid zone appears intact; no full-thickness retinal defect.\n\n**Case Y Data:**\n- Age: $72$ years\n- Complaint: gradual visual decline\n- BCVA: $20/80$\n- En face OCT: a homogenous, gray, plaque-like area centered at the fovea without radiating striae or vessel kinking; the lesion margins are smooth.\n- B-scan OCT: a thick, homogenous, medium-reflective material that conforms to the inner retinal contour, is contiguous with the margins of the lamellar defect, and partially fills it. The lamellar defect has round, undermined edges with outer retinal involvement including ellipsoid zone disruption and outer nuclear layer thinning; minimal surface folds.\n\n**Question:**\nDetermine which case represents a tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM and which represents a degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of ophthalmology and biomedical optics. The descriptions of Epiretinal Membrane (ERM), Lamellar Hole-Associated Epiretinal Proliferation (LHEP), and their manifestations on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are consistent with current clinical and pathological understanding. The biophysical principles cited (tractional shear, OCT reflectivity) are correct and directly applicable. The problem is free of pseudoscience or factual error.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides two distinct clinical cases with detailed, non-overlapping imaging descriptions. It also provides clear definitions for the two key pathological entities (ERM and LHEP). The task is to map the findings of each case to the correct entity based on these definitions and principles. This structure allows for a unique and logical solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is clinical, precise, and descriptive. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined. The problem is free of subjective or biased statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided data for each case is sufficient to make a differential diagnosis based on the given definitions. There are no internal contradictions. For instance, the B-scan findings are consistent with the en face findings in both cases.\n- **Feasibility**: The clinical scenarios and OCT findings are realistic and commonly encountered in retinal practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to differentiate between a tractional lamellar macular hole (LMH) caused by an ERM and a degenerative LMH associated with LHEP, using the provided case descriptions and definitions.\n\n**Principle Analysis:**\n- A **tractional LMH due to ERM** is defined by the presence of a *contractile* membrane. The fundamental principle states that this contractility generates *tangential shear*. Therefore, we expect to see morphological evidence of this traction. According to the definitions, an ERM is *thin* and *highly reflective*. Its contractile nature would lead to surface wrinkling (striae on en face OCT), vessel tortuosity (kinking), and pulling apart of the inner retinal layers (intraretinal schisis), resulting in a defect with sharp, steep edges. The damage would be primarily focused on the inner retina, where the traction is applied.\n- A **degenerative LMH with LHEP** is defined by a *noncontractile*, *homogenous* proliferation. The lack of contractility implies an absence of the tangential shear forces seen with ERM. Therefore, we expect no significant surface wrinkling or vessel kinking. The LHEP material itself is described as *isoreflective to inner retina* and tends to *fill or bridge* the defect. The underlying pathology is degenerative, suggesting a process of tissue loss and atrophy rather than mechanical tearing. This would manifest as a defect with rounded, undermined edges and often involves deeper retinal layers, such as the outer nuclear layer and ellipsoid zone.\n\n**Analysis of Case X:**\n- The en face OCT shows `radially oriented, hyperreflective striae`, `perimacular vessel kinking`, and `surface wrinkling`. These are all definitive signs of tangential traction on the retinal surface.\n- The B-scan reveals a `thin, highly reflective linear structure along the ILM`, which precisely matches the definition of an ERM.\n- The B-scan also shows `retinal plication`, `steep, sharp edges` of the defect, and `intraretinal schisis predominantly in the inner retinal layers`. These features are the direct anatomical consequences of the tractional forces exerted by the ERM.\n- The relative preservation of the outer retina (`ellipsoid zone appears intact`) further supports a mechanism primarily affecting the inner retinal surface.\n- **Conclusion for Case X:** The combination of clear tractional features on the retinal surface and a lamellar defect with characteristics of mechanical tearing is pathognomonic for a tractional lamellar macular hole due to an ERM.\n\n**Analysis of Case Y:**\n- The en face OCT shows a `homogenous, gray, plaque-like area` and, crucially, is `without radiating striae or vessel kinking`. This explicitly rules out significant tangential traction.\n- The B-scan shows a `thick, homogenous, medium-reflective material` that `conforms to the inner retinal contour` and `partially fills` the lamellar defect. This description is a perfect match for LHEP, which is defined as `homogenous`, `isoreflective to inner retina` (which would appear as medium-reflectivity), and fills/bridges the defect.\n- The lamellar defect exhibits `round, undermined edges` and signs of `outer retinal involvement including ellipsoid zone disruption and outer nuclear layer thinning`. These are features of a chronic, atrophic, or degenerative process, not acute traction.\n- **Conclusion for Case Y:** The absence of traction, the presence of a proliferative material conforming to the defect, and the degenerative features of the hole itself are all characteristic of a degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nBased on the analysis, Case X is a tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM, and Case Y is a degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Case X: Tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM; Case Y: Degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP**\n  This option correctly assigns the diagnosis to each case based on our derivation. Case X shows clear signs of traction from an ERM. Case Y shows the characteristic features of a non-tractional, degenerative process with LHEP.\n  **Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **B. Case X: Degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP; Case Y: Tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM**\n  This option incorrectly reverses the diagnoses. Case X exhibits traction, which is inconsistent with LHEP. Case Y lacks traction, which is inconsistent with an ERM-driven process.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **C. Case X: Tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM; Case Y: Tractional lamellar macular hole due to ERM**\n  This option is incorrect because the findings in Case Y (absence of striae/kinking, presence of homogenous plaque-like LHEP material) are inconsistent with a tractional etiology.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **D. Case X: Degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP; Case Y: Degenerative lamellar macular hole with LHEP**\n  This option is incorrect because the findings in Case X (surface wrinkling, vessel kinking, thin hyperreflective membrane) are definitive for traction from an ERM, not a degenerative process with LHEP.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **E. Case X: Full-thickness macular hole; Case Y: Macular pseudohole due to ERM**\n  This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. The problem statement for Case X explicitly states there is `no full-thickness retinal defect`. A macular pseudohole is an aperture in an ERM that mimics a macular hole, but the foveal contour is typically intact, whereas Case Y has a clear lamellar defect with outer retinal disruption.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect**",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested: the calculation of the Macular Hole Index (MHI) and the explanation of its prognostic significance.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Macular Hole Index (MHI)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the average macular hole height, denoted by $h$, using the provided definition and measurements for the nasal height ($h_{n}$) and temporal height ($h_{t}$). The height is the arithmetic mean of these two values.\n$$h = \\frac{h_{n} + h_{t}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$h = \\frac{385\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 415\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{2} = \\frac{800\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{2} = 400\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the average base diameter, denoted by $d$, using the provided definition and measurements for the two perpendicular axes ($d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$). The base diameter is the arithmetic mean of these two values.\n$$d = \\frac{d_{1} + d_{2}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$d = \\frac{620\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 650\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{2} = \\frac{1270\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{2} = 635\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nFinally, the Macular Hole Index (MHI) is defined as the ratio of the hole height ($h$) to the base diameter ($d$).\n$$\\text{MHI} = \\frac{h}{d}$$\nUsing the calculated values for $h$ and $d$:\n$$\\text{MHI} = \\frac{400\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{635\\,\\mu\\text{m}} \\approx 0.629921259...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{MHI} \\approx 0.630$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanatory Component**\n\n**Prognostic Significance of MHI for Anatomical Closure**\n\nThe Macular Hole Index (MHI) is a dimensionless parameter, $\\text{MHI} = h/d$, that quantifies the geometric shape of the macular hole. From first principles, its prognostic value arises from the biomechanics of retinal tissue and the geometry of hole closure.\n\n1.  **Geometric Interpretation**: A higher MHI indicates a taller, narrower hole (a more \"V-shaped\" or acute configuration). Conversely, a lower MHI indicates a wider, flatter hole (a more \"U-shaped\" or obtuse configuration). The surgery, which includes vitrectomy and ILM peeling, aims to release the tractional forces that created and maintain the hole, allowing the hole edges to re-appose.\n\n2.  **Biomechanical Reasoning**: The anatomical closure of a macular hole requires the neurosensory retinal tissue at the hole's margin to bridge the defect. The MHI provides an insight into the dominant forces at play.\n    -   A **low MHI** (wide base diameter $d$ relative to height $h$) suggests that significant **tangential tractional forces** are acting on the retina, pulling the edges of the hole apart horizontally. This creates a large gap that the retinal tissue must stretch across to close. Even after these forces are released surgically, a large baseline defect and potentially less pliable, atrophic retinal edges may impede successful apposition. The amount of tissue needed to bridge the horizontal gap is substantial.\n    -   A **high MHI** (tall height $h$ relative to base diameter $d$) suggests that **anteroposterior (or vitreofoveal) traction** might have been a more dominant pathogenic factor than tangential traction. This vertical traction elevates the retinal edges. Vitrectomy effectively releases this anteroposterior traction. With the vertical pull eliminated, the taller, less horizontally-retracted hole edges can more easily fall back into place and approximate each other. The geometry is simply more favorable for closure because the horizontal distance to be bridged is smaller relative to the tissue volume at the hole margins. A commonly cited clinical threshold is an $\\text{MHI} > 0.5$, which is associated with higher rates of successful anatomical closure.\n\nIn essence, the MHI acts as a proxy for the a balance of tractional forces and the amount of retinal tissue available and required for closure. A higher MHI indicates a configuration that requires less lateral tissue movement to achieve closure, thus predicting a better surgical outcome.\n\n**Influence of Epiretinal Membrane (ERM) on MHI**\n\nAn epiretinal membrane (ERM) is a sheet of fibrocellular tissue that proliferates on the inner retinal surface. Its defining characteristic in this context is its contractility.\n\n1.  **Mechanism of Influence**: The contractile nature of an ERM exerts significant **tangential traction** on the surface of the retina. When an ERM coexists with a macular hole, these forces act to pull the retina centripetally toward the ERM's epicenter but also tangentially across the macular surface. This has a direct effect of pulling the edges of the macular hole apart.\n2.  **Impact on MHI**: The primary geometric consequence of the tangential traction from an ERM is an increase in the hole's base diameter ($d$). While the ERM can also cause retinal thickening and cystic changes that might affect the hole height ($h$), its most direct and pronounced effect is the widening of the base. According to the definition $\\text{MHI} = h/d$, an increase in the denominator ($d$) directly leads to a **decrease in the MHI**.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a coexistent ERM biases the hole geometry towards being wider and flatter, resulting in a lower MHI than would be expected for a hole of similar vertical dimension without an ERM. As a lower MHI is a negative prognostic indicator, the presence of an ERM is associated with a poorer prognosis for spontaneous or even surgical closure if the membrane is not adequately removed. The surgical plan correctly includes peeling of the ILM, which is the layer upon which the ERM forms, ensuring the release of this critical source of tangential traction.",

The core physical principle is the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$.\n\nLet state $1$ be the condition at sea level and state $2$ be the condition at altitude $h = 2{,}500\\,\\mathrm{m}$. We denote the pressure, volume, number of moles, and temperature of the gas bubble in each state as $(P_1, V_1, n_1, T_1)$ and $(P_2, V_2, n_2, T_2)$, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the gas is isothermal, meaning $T_1 = T_2$. It also assumes no significant diffusion, which implies the number of moles of gas is constant, so $n_1 = n_2$. From the ideal gas law, we have:\n$$P_1 V_1 = n_1 R T_1$$\n$$P_2 V_2 = n_2 R T_2$$\nSince $n_1 = n_2$ and $T_1 = T_2$, we can equate the two expressions to get Boyle's Law:\n$$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$\n\nThe absolute pressure of the gas bubble at any altitude is given as the sum of the local atmospheric pressure and a constant relative intraocular pressure, $P_{\\text{IOP,rel}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\nFirst, we convert $P_{\\text{IOP,rel}}$ to the SI unit of kilopascals:\n$$P_{\\text{IOP,rel}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.133322\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kPa}}{\\mathrm{mmHg}} = 1.99983\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\n\nNext, we establish the absolute pressures $P_1$ and $P_2$.\nAt sea level (state $1$), the atmospheric pressure is $P_{\\text{atm},1} = P_0 = 101.325\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. The absolute pressure inside the bubble is:\n$$P_1 = P_{\\text{atm},1} + P_{\\text{IOP,rel}} = 101.325\\,\\mathrm{kPa} + 1.99983\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 103.32483\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\n\nAt altitude $h = 2{,}500\\,\\mathrm{m}$ (state $2$), the atmospheric pressure $P_{\\text{atm},2}$ is given by the barometric formula:\n$$P_{\\text{atm},2} = P(h) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Mgh}{RT}\\right)$$\nWe first calculate the value of the exponent:\n$$\\frac{Mgh}{RT} = \\frac{(0.028964\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol})(9.80665\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2})(2{,}500\\,\\mathrm{m})}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)} \\times 288.15\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\approx 0.296374$$\nSo, the atmospheric pressure at altitude is:\n$$P_{\\text{atm},2} = (101.325\\,\\mathrm{kPa}) \\exp(-0.296374) \\approx (101.325\\,\\mathrm{kPa})(0.743512) \\approx 75.3220\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThe absolute pressure inside the bubble at altitude is:\n$$P_2 = P_{\\text{atm},2} + P_{\\text{IOP,rel}} = 75.3220\\,\\mathrm{kPa} + 1.99983\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 77.32183\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\n\nNow we relate the volumes. The initial volume of the gas at sea level, $V_1$, is a fraction $f$ of the total vitreous cavity volume $V_{\\text{eye}}$:\n$$V_1 = f V_{\\text{eye}}$$\nThe problem asks for the maximum allowable initial fraction, $f_{\\max}$. This corresponds to the case where the final volume $V_2$ reaches its maximum permitted value, $V_{\\max}$. The safety constraint is $V_2 \\le V_{\\max}$, where $V_{\\max} = 0.90\\,V_{\\text{eye}}$. We set $V_2 = V_{\\max}$ for the limiting case.\n$$V_2 = 0.90\\,V_{\\text{eye}}$$\nThe initial volume corresponding to this limit is $V_1 = f_{\\max} V_{\\text{eye}}$.\n\nWe substitute these volume expressions into Boyle's Law:\n$$P_1 (f_{\\max} V_{\\text{eye}}) = P_2 (0.90 V_{\\text{eye}})$$\nThe term $V_{\\text{eye}}$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides:\n$$P_1 f_{\\max} = 0.90 P_2$$\nSolving for $f_{\\max}$:\n$$f_{\\max} = 0.90 \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$$\nSubstituting the calculated pressure values:\n$$f_{\\max} = 0.90 \\times \\frac{77.32183\\,\\mathrm{kPa}}{103.32483\\,\\mathrm{kPa}}$$\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 0.90 \\times 0.748344 \\approx 0.67351$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$f_{\\max} \\approx 0.674$$\nThis means the initial gas fill at sea level should not exceed $67.4\\%$ of the vitreous cavity volume to ensure safety during the ascent to $2{,}500\\,\\mathrm{m}$.",
