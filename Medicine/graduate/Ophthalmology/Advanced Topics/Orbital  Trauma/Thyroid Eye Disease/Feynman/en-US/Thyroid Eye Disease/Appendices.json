In the diagnostic workup of Thyroid Eye Disease (TED), serological markers like thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) are powerful but not perfect tools. This exercise will guide you through the application of Bayes' theorem to precisely calculate how a positive test result transforms an initial clinical suspicion (pretest probability) into a refined, evidence-based diagnostic conclusion (post-test probability), a fundamental skill in modern medicine .",

            "problem": "In a tertiary ophthalmology clinic, a patient presents with signs suggestive of thyroid eye disease (TED). Based on epidemiological data and clinical assessment, the clinician estimates a pretest probability of TED of $0.60$. A serum thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) assay is obtained. For this laboratory and population, the TRAb assay has a sensitivity of $0.85$ and a specificity of $0.95$. Using Bayes’ theorem and starting from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability, compute the post-test probability of TED given a positive TRAb result. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the post-test probability of a patient having thyroid eye disease (TED) given a positive test result from a thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) assay. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem in the context of medical diagnostics.\n\nFirst, we must rigorously define the events and translate the given information into the language of probability theory.\nLet $D$ denote the event that the patient has thyroid eye disease.\nLet $\\neg D$ denote the event that the patient does not have thyroid eye disease.\nLet $T$ denote the event that the TRAb assay result is positive.\nLet $\\neg T$ denote the event that the TRAb assay result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1. The pretest probability of TED is $0.60$. This is the prior probability of the patient having the disease before the test result is known. In probabilistic terms, this is:\n$$P(D) = 0.60$$\nFrom this, the prior probability of the patient not having the disease is the complement:\n$$P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\n2. The sensitivity of the TRAb assay is $0.85$. Sensitivity is defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present. This is a conditional probability, also known as the true positive rate:\n$$P(T|D) = 0.85$$\n\n3. The specificity of the TRAb assay is $0.95$. Specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent. This conditional probability is also known as the true negative rate:\n$$P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.95$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of TED given a positive TRAb result. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(T|D)P(D)$, represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, $P(D \\cap T)$. The denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result, regardless of the patient's true disease status.\n\nTo find $P(T)$, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive). The total probability $P(T)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap \\neg D)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\nWe have been given $P(T|D) = 0.85$, $P(D) = 0.60$, and we have derived $P(\\neg D) = 0.40$. The term $P(T|\\neg D)$ is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent, which is the false positive rate. This can be calculated from the specificity. Since the events of a positive test ($T$) and a negative test ($\\neg T$) are complementary for a given condition ($\\neg D$), we have:\n$$P(T|\\neg D) + P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\nNow we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = (0.85)(0.60) + (0.05)(0.40)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.51 + 0.02$$\n$$P(T) = 0.53$$\nFinally, we substitute the known and calculated values back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.60)}{0.53}$$\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.51}{0.53}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.9622641509...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $6$, $2$, and $2$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round the fourth figure up.\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.9623$$\nThis is the post-test probability of the patient having thyroid eye disease given a positive TRAb assay result.",

On examination, the following seven CAS elements are assessed: spontaneous orbital pain (present), gaze-evoked pain (present), eyelid erythema (present), conjunctival injection (absent), chemosis (present), caruncular edema (absent), and swelling of eyelids (present).

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the Clinical Activity Score (CAS) for a patient with suspected Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) and the subsequent classification of the disease activity. The solution is derived by following the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the problem defines the CAS as the total count of present inflammatory signs out of a specific list of seven elements. The patient's examination findings for these seven elements are provided:\n1. Spontaneous orbital pain: present\n2. Gaze-evoked pain: present\n3. Eyelid erythema: present\n4. Conjunctival injection: absent\n5. Chemosis: present\n6. Caruncular edema: absent\n7. Swelling of eyelids: present\n\nTo calculate the CAS, we simply sum the number of signs that are \"present\". We can assign a value of $1$ for each \"present\" sign and $0$ for each \"absent\" sign.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- Spontaneous orbital pain: $1$\n- Gaze-evoked pain: $1$\n- Eyelid erythema: $1$\n- Conjunctival injection: $0$\n- Chemosis: $1$\n- Caruncular edema: $0$\n- Swelling of eyelids: $1$\n\nThe total score, or CAS, is the sum of these values:\n$$ \\text{CAS} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5 $$\nThe problem denotes this value as $a$. Therefore, $a = 5$.\n\nNext, the problem requires classifying the disease as clinically active or not. This is based on the \"accepted baseline activity threshold\". In the context of the 7-point CAS for TED (often referred to as the Mourits' score), the standard and widely accepted definition for active disease is a CAS of $3$ or greater.\nThe condition for active disease is:\n$$ \\text{CAS} \\ge 3 $$\nOur calculated CAS is $5$. We compare this value to the threshold:\n$$ 5 \\ge 3 $$\nThis inequality is true, which indicates that the disease is clinically active.\n\nThe problem states that the classification should be represented by a variable $b$, where $b=1$ if the disease is active and $b=0$ if it is not. Since the disease is classified as active, we have:\n$$ b = 1 $$\n\nFinally, the answer must be expressed as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the values we found for $a$ and $b$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix represents a CAS of $5$ and a classification of active disease.",

            "introduction": "Beyond diagnosis and activity assessment, advanced management of TED involves predicting and preventing its most severe complications. Dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), a potential cause of irreversible vision loss, arises from mechanical crowding at the orbital apex. This advanced practice delves into how clinical research translates anatomical measurements from CT scans into a powerful prognostic tool, using the principles of logistic regression to model the probability of DON and identify high-risk patients who may require proactive intervention .",
            "id": "4730389",
            "problem": "In thyroid eye disease (TED), the risk of dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) is influenced by how tightly extraocular muscles and orbital fat crowd the orbital apex. Consider the orbital apex crowding index measured on computed tomography (CT), defined as a dimensionless ratio of the summed cross-sectional areas of extraocular muscles to the available bony orbital cross-sectional area at the apex on a standardized slice. Empirically, increasing crowding index is associated with a monotonic increase in the risk of DON. Suppose we model this risk using a probabilistic framework where the odds of DON are defined as the ratio of the probability of DON to the probability of no DON, and we assume that the natural logarithm of the odds (the log-odds) is a linear function of the crowding index. Specifically, let the log-odds be given by an intercept $\\alpha$ and a slope $\\beta$ multiplied by the index. \n\nStarting from the definitions of probability, odds, and log-odds, and the assumption of linear log-odds in the index, derive the analytic expression for the probability of DON as a function of the crowding index, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$. Then, for a patient with measured index $=120$, and parameters $\\alpha=-3$ and $\\beta=0.05$ determined from a validated logistic regression model, compute the predicted probability of DON. Express the final probability as a decimal fraction (no percentage sign), which is dimensionless, and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "### Derivation of the Probability Function\nLet $P$ be the probability of DON. The probability of not having DON is then $1-P$. The odds of DON, $O$, are defined as:\n$$ O = \\frac{P}{1-P} $$\nThe problem states that the natural logarithm of the odds is a linear function of the crowding index, $I$. The parameters of this linear relationship are the intercept $\\alpha$ and the slope $\\beta$:\n$$ \\ln(O) = \\alpha + \\beta I $$\nSubstituting the definition of odds into this equation, we get the log-odds (or logit) function:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P}{1-P}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta I $$\nTo solve for $P$, we first exponentiate both sides of the equation to eliminate the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{P}{1-P} = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) $$\nNow, we perform algebraic manipulation to isolate $P$. Let's multiply both sides by $(1-P)$:\n$$ P = (1-P) \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) $$\nDistribute the exponential term on the right side:\n$$ P = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) - P \\cdot \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) $$\nGroup all terms containing $P$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ P + P \\cdot \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) $$\nFactor out $P$ from the left side:\n$$ P \\left(1 + \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I)\\right) = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I) $$\nFinally, divide to solve for $P$:\n$$ P(I; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I)}{1 + \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I)} $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the probability of DON. This function is known as the logistic function. An equivalent form can be obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I)$:\n$$ P(I; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\alpha + \\beta I)} + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\beta I))} $$\n\n### Calculation of the Predicted Probability\nWe are given the following values:\n- Crowding index, $I = 120$\n- Intercept, $\\alpha = -3$\n- Slope, $\\beta = 0.05$\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the linear component, which is the log-odds:\n$$ \\alpha + \\beta I = -3 + (0.05)(120) $$\n$$ \\alpha + \\beta I = -3 + 6 $$\n$$ \\alpha + \\beta I = 3 $$\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived expression for the probability $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\exp(3)}{1 + \\exp(3)} $$\nUsing the second form of the expression:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3)} $$\nWe now calculate the numerical value. The value of $\\exp(-3)$ is approximately $0.049787068$.\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.049787068} = \\frac{1}{1.049787068} $$\n$$ P \\approx 0.9525741268 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
