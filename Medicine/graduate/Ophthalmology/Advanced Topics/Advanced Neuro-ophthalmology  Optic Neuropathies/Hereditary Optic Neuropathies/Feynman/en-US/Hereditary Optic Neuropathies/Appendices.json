This practice explores autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA), focusing on the critical concepts of incomplete penetrance and how to update risk probabilities based on an individual's clinical status. By working through this scenario , you will develop the quantitative skills needed to translate genetic principles into precise risk figures for at-risk family members.",

            "problem": "A family presents with dominant optic atrophy attributed to a confirmed heterozygous pathogenic variant in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene in the proband. Assume autosomal dominant transmission, independent meioses, no phenocopies, and age-complete penetrance of $0.8$ by age $40$ for OPA1 variant carriers. The proband has three adult children: Child A, Child B, and Child C. At age $40$, Child C is clinically affected, while Child A and Child B are clinically unaffected. Child A and Child B each have exactly one biological child, both currently age $40$.\n\nUsing only the following foundational principles:\n- In autosomal dominant inheritance, a heterozygous parent transmits the pathogenic allele to each child with probability $1/2$.\n- Penetrance is the probability that an individual who carries a disease-causing allele expresses the phenotype; here this is $0.8$ by age $40$.\n- All meioses and disease expressions across individuals are independent given genotypes.\n\nDerive, from first principles and appropriate conditioning on the observed phenotypes, the probability that at least one of the two grandchildren (one from Child A and one from Child B) is clinically affected by age $40$. Express your final answer as an exact fraction. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics and probability theory, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the probability that at least one of two specific grandchildren is clinically affected by age $40$, given the family history and phenotypes.\n\nLet us define the following events and probabilities based on the problem statement:\n- $G$: The event that an individual has the pathogenic heterozygous OPA1 genotype.\n- $g$: The event that an individual does not have the pathogenic genotype (i.e., is homozygous wild-type).\n- $A$: The event that an individual is clinically affected by age $40$.\n- $U$: The event that an individual is clinically unaffected by age $40$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following foundational probabilities:\n1.  The proband is a heterozygous carrier ($G$). For any child of the proband, the prior probability of inheriting the pathogenic allele is $P(\\text{child has } G) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of not inheriting it is $P(\\text{child has } g) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  The penetrance of the genotype is $P(A|G) = 0.8$.\n3.  The probability of being a non-penetrant carrier (having the genotype but being unaffected) is $P(U|G) = 1 - P(A|G) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.\n4.  There are no phenocopies, which means an individual without the pathogenic genotype cannot be affected. This implies $P(A|g) = 0$.\n5.  Consequently, an individual without the pathogenic genotype must be unaffected: $P(U|g) = 1 - P(A|g) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that Child A and Child B are clinically unaffected at age $40$. We must first determine the posterior probability that Child A (and by symmetry, Child B) is a carrier of the pathogenic allele, given their unaffected status. Let us denote the event that Child A has the genotype as $G_A$ and the event that Child A is unaffected as $U_A$. We use Bayes' theorem to find $P(G_A|U_A)$:\n\n$$P(G_A|U_A) = \\frac{P(U_A|G_A)P(G_A)}{P(U_A)}$$\n\nTo find the denominator, $P(U_A)$, we use the law of total probability:\n$$P(U_A) = P(U_A|G_A)P(G_A) + P(U_A|g_A)P(g_A)$$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- $P(G_A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(g_A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(U_A|G_A) = 0.2$\n- $P(U_A|g_A) = 1$\n\nSo, the total probability of Child A being unaffected is:\n$$P(U_A) = (0.2) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0.1 + 0.5 = 0.6$$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability that Child A is a carrier, given they are unaffected:\n$$P(G_A|U_A) = \\frac{P(U_A|G_A)P(G_A)}{P(U_A)} = \\frac{(0.2) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{0.6} = \\frac{0.1}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nThe probability that Child A is not a carrier, given they are unaffected, is:\n$$P(g_A|U_A) = 1 - P(G_A|U_A) = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nBy symmetry, the same probabilities apply to Child B: $P(G_B|U_B) = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $P(g_B|U_B) = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nNext, we determine the probability that the grandchild of Child A, let's call this individual GA, is clinically affected by age $40$. Let this event be $A_{GA}$. We use the law of total probability, conditioning on the genotype status of Child A:\n$$P(A_{GA}) = P(A_{GA}|G_A)P(G_A|U_A) + P(A_{GA}|g_A)P(g_A|U_A)$$\n\nLet's evaluate the conditional probabilities for the grandchild:\n- If Child A is a carrier ($G_A$), the probability that GA inherits the allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$. If GA inherits the allele, the probability they are affected is the penetrance, $0.8$. Thus, $P(A_{GA}|G_A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.8 = 0.4$.\n- If Child A is not a carrier ($g_A$), they cannot pass on the allele, so the probability of GA being affected is $0$. Thus, $P(A_{GA}|g_A) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $P(A_{GA})$:\n$$P(A_{GA}) = (0.4) \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) + (0) \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{0.4}{6} = \\frac{4}{60} = \\frac{1}{15}$$\n\nSo, the probability that the grandchild of Child A is clinically affected is $\\frac{1}{15}$. Due to the identical situation, the probability that the grandchild of Child B is affected, $P(A_{GB})$, is also $\\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that at least one of the two grandchildren is clinically affected. Let this event be $E = A_{GA} \\cup A_{GB}$. It is simpler to calculate the probability of the complement event, $E^c$, which is that neither grandchild is affected. Since the inheritance and expression in the two family branches (A and B) are independent events, we have:\n$$P(E^c) = P(U_{GA} \\cap U_{GB}) = P(U_{GA}) \\times P(U_{GB})$$\n\nThe probability that a grandchild is unaffected is:\n$$P(U_{GA}) = 1 - P(A_{GA}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{14}{15}$$\n$$P(U_{GB}) = 1 - P(A_{GB}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{14}{15}$$\n\nThe probability that both are unaffected is:\n$$P(E^c) = \\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{14}{15} = \\frac{196}{225}$$\n\nFinally, the probability of at least one grandchild being affected is $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$:\n$$P(E) = 1 - \\frac{196}{225} = \\frac{225 - 196}{225} = \\frac{29}{225}$$\nThis is an exact fraction and requires no rounding.",

For a patient in the treatment arm, let the random variable $X_t$ represent the outcome, where $X_t = 1$ denotes a clinically meaningful recovery and $X_t = 0$ denotes no such recovery. The probability distribution for $X_t$ is a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p_t$.\nThe probability of recovery is $P(X_t=1) = p_t$.\nThe probability of no recovery is $P(X_t=0) = 1 - p_t$.\n\nThe expected value of the outcome for a single patient in the treatment arm, $E[X_t]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[X_t] = 1 \\cdot P(X_t=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_t=0) = 1 \\cdot p_t + 0 \\cdot (1 - p_t) = p_t$$\n\nSimilarly, for a patient in the control arm, let the random variable $X_c$ represent the outcome.
