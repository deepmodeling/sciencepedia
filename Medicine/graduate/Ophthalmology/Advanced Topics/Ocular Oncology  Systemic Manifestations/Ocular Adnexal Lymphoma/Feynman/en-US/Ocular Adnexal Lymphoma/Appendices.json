The adjacent extraocular muscle has an ADC of approximately $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT)**: No osseous erosion.\n*   **Provided Foundational Principles**:\n    1.  Hypercellular tumors produce restricted water diffusion with low ADC values.\n    2.  Edema-rich inflammatory processes tend to be T$2$ hyperintense.\n    3.  Lymphomatous infiltrates characteristically mold around orbital structures with homogeneous enhancement.\n*   **Question**: Determine the most likely diagnosis and the most appropriate next step in management.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in established principles of ophthalmology, neuroradiology, and oncology. The clinical signs (proptosis, diplopia, abduction deficit) are consistent with an orbital mass affecting the lateral rectus muscle. The MRI and CT findings described (T$1$/T$2$ signal characteristics, enhancement pattern, DWI/ADC values, lack of bone erosion) are standard parameters used in the diagnostic workup of orbital lesions. The ADC values provided, $0.55 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ for the lesion and $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ for muscle, are physically realistic and pathologically significant. The stated \"foundational principles\" correctly reflect established imaging-pathophysiology correlations: hypercellularity is linked to low ADC, inflammation/edema to T$2$ hyperintensity, and lymphoma to specific morphological and enhancement patterns. The entire scenario is scientifically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a detailed and coherent set of clinical and radiological data and asks for a logical deduction of the most likely diagnosis and corresponding management plan. The information is sufficient to allow for a reasoned differential diagnosis and convergence on a primary suspect.\n\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem statement is presented using objective, clinical language. It avoids subjective or biased terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is not factually unsound, is highly relevant to its field, provides a complete and consistent setup, describes a realistic clinical scenario, and is well-structured for a diagnostic reasoning task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Synthesis of Findings and Differential Diagnosis**\n\nThe goal is to integrate the patient's age, clinical history, physical findings, and detailed imaging results to arrive at the most probable diagnosis.\n\n*   **Clinical Profile**: A $68$-year-old patient with a painless, progressive orbital mass developing over $4$ months points towards a subacute or chronic neoplastic or lymphoproliferative process, rather than an acute infection or aggressive malignancy.\n*   **Imaging - Morphology and Location**: The mass is described as \"molding\" around the lateral rectus muscle. This feature is highly suggestive of a soft, pliable tumor that insinuates itself between and around existing orbital structures without invading or destroying them. This is a classic characteristic of orbital lymphoma, as stated in the provided principles. The lack of osseous erosion on CT further supports a process that respects anatomical boundaries.\n*   **Imaging - Signal Characteristics and Enhancement**:\n    *   T$1$-isointensity to muscle is a non-specific finding common to many cellular tumors.\n    *   T$2$-hypointensity is a critical clue. As per the problem's principles, inflammatory processes are typically T$2$-hyperintense due to edema. T$2$-hypointensity in a soft tissue mass suggests high cellular density with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, which displaces free water. This strongly argues against diagnoses like idiopathic orbital inflammation.\n    *   Homogeneous contrast enhancement is also typical for tumors with uniform cellularity and vascularity, such as lymphoma.\n*   **Imaging - Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)**: This is the most specific piece of evidence. The lesion shows restricted diffusion with a very low ADC value of $0.55 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$. The problem explicitly states that hypercellular tumors cause restricted diffusion and low ADC values. This quantitative measure provides strong evidence for a densely packed cellular tumor. Lymphomas are archetypal hypercellular tumors and consistently demonstrate very low ADC values, often below $0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, which is significantly lower than most other orbital tumors and inflammatory conditions. The contrast with the normal muscle ADC of $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ quantifies the severe restriction.\n\n**Conclusion on Diagnosis**: The confluence of findings—an older patient, an indolent course, and the specific imaging tetrad of (1) molding morphology, (2) T$2$-hypointensity, (3) homogeneous enhancement, and (4) marked diffusion restriction (low ADC)—is pathognomonic for orbital lymphoproliferative disorder, most commonly extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma).\n\n**2. Management Plan**\n\nBased on the highly probable diagnosis of lymphoma, the appropriate management follows a strict oncologic protocol:\n1.  **Histopathologic Confirmation**: Despite strong imaging evidence, treatment must not begin without tissue confirmation. An incisional biopsy is required to obtain adequate tissue. A portion of the specimen must be sent fresh (in saline or Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium, not formalin) for flow cytometry, a crucial test for immunophenotyping and classifying lymphomas. The remainder is sent for routine histology and immunohistochemical staining.\n2.  **Systemic Staging**: Orbital lymphoma may be a localized disease or a manifestation of systemic lymphoma. After diagnosis is confirmed, comprehensive staging is mandatory. This includes a physical examination, laboratory tests (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase), a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) scan, and a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\n3.  **Treatment**: Therapy depends on the lymphoma subtype and stage. For localized (Ann Arbor stage IE or IIE) low-grade MALT lymphoma of the orbit, the standard of care with the highest local control rate is involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Idiopathic orbital inflammation; commence high-dose systemic glucocorticoids immediately and defer biopsy if there is a rapid clinical response.**\n*   The diagnosis is inconsistent with the imaging findings. Idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is typically painful and presents with prominent T$2$ hyperintensity due to edema and inflammation. The observed T$2$-hypointensity and extremely low ADC value argue strongly against IOI.\n*   The management is inappropriate. Administering high-dose steroids without a diagnosis (a \"steroid trial\") is risky. Lymphomas can show a partial and temporary response to steroids, which can delay the correct diagnosis and complicate subsequent histologic analysis by inducing cell lysis. Given the high suspicion for lymphoma, biopsy is the mandatory next step.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma); obtain urgent incisional biopsy with fresh tissue for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, followed by systemic staging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) and bone marrow evaluation; for localized stage $1$–$2$ disease, consider involved-site external beam radiation therapy.**\n*   The diagnosis of MALT lymphoma perfectly aligns with the patient's demographics, clinical course, and the full set of pathognomonic imaging findings.\n*   The management plan is comprehensive and accurate, reflecting the current standard of care for suspected orbital lymphoma: (1) proper biopsy technique for definitive diagnosis, (2) thorough systemic staging, and (3) appropriate first-line treatment for localized disease.\n*   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Cavernous venous malformation; observe or schedule elective excision as needed; systemic oncologic work-up is not indicated.**\n*   The diagnosis is incorrect. Cavernous venous malformations are typically well-circumscribed but are characteristically very bright (hyperintense) on T$2$-weighted images due to their blood-filled vascular channels. They also do not exhibit restricted diffusion; their ADC values are high. The T$2$-hypointensity and low ADC in this case rule out this diagnosis.\n*   The management is therefore inappropriate for this patient's actual condition.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Metastatic carcinoma to the orbit, most likely from breast; initiate systemic endocrine therapy without tissue diagnosis.**\n*   The diagnosis is less likely. While metastasis is in the differential for an orbital mass in an older adult, metastases are often more rapidly progressive and painful, and frequently cause bone destruction. The molding morphology and indolent course are more characteristic of lymphoma.\n*   The management is incorrect and dangerous. Initiating systemic therapy, especially targeted therapy like endocrine therapy, without a confirmed tissue diagnosis and receptor status is a violation of fundamental oncologic principles.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma; begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy emergently based on imaging findings alone.**\n*   The diagnosis is incorrect. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary orbital malignancy in *childhood*. It is exceedingly rare in a $68$-year-old. It presents as a rapidly growing, destructive mass, which contradicts the $4$-month indolent history and lack of bone erosion.\n*   The management plan is flawed as it advocates for aggressive treatment without a biopsy, which is never the standard of care.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

All descriptions (\"salmon-patch lesion,\" \"confined to the bulbar conjunctiva,\" measurements) are precise and devoid of subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded, and objective question based on established clinical practice and staging criteria. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine the correct clinical T category ($\\mathrm{cT}$) for the described conjunctival lymphoma using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) $8$th edition staging manual. The staging for primary ophthalmic adnexal lymphomas of the conjunctiva is based on the anatomical extent of the tumor. The relevant T categories are defined as follows:\n\n-   **$\\mathrm{TX}$**: Primary tumor cannot be assessed\n-   **$\\mathrm{T0}$**: No evidence of primary tumor\n-   **$\\mathrm{Tis}$**: Carcinoma in situ (not applicable for lymphoma)\n-   **$\\mathrm{T1}$**: Tumor confined to the bulbar conjunctiva\n-   **$\\mathrm{T2}$**: Tumor involves the forniceal conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctiva, and/or caruncle\n-   **$\\mathrm{T3}$**: Tumor directly invades the eyeball (e.g., cornea, sclera, uvea, retina), lacrimal sac, or eyelid (tarsus)\n-   **$\\mathrm{T4}$**: Tumor invades the orbit and/or periorbital sinuses and/or central nervous system\n\nNow, we map the patient's findings, as listed in the validation step, to these definitions.\n\n1.  The lesion is described as \"localized to the temporal bulbar conjunctiva\" and \"confined to the bulbar conjunctiva\". This directly corresponds to the definition of a $\\mathrm{T1}$ lesion.\n2.  To confirm it is not a higher stage, we must evaluate the criteria for $\\mathrm{T2}$, $\\mathrm{T3}$, and $\\mathrm{T4}$.\n3.  For a **$\\mathrm{T2}$** lesion, there must be involvement of the forniceal conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctiva, or caruncle. The problem statement explicitly says, \"no involvement of the forniceal or palpebral conjunctiva, and no caruncular involvement.\" Therefore, the lesion is not $\\mathrm{T2}$.\n4.  For a **$\\mathrm{T3}$** lesion, there must be direct invasion of the eyeball, lacrimal sac, or eyelid. The slit-lamp exam notes \"no extension onto the cornea\" and \"eyelids are normal without tarsal abnormalities.\" The MRI shows \"no scleral or intraocular extension.\" Therefore, the lesion is not $\\mathrm{T3}$.\n5.  For a **$\\mathrm{T4}$** lesion, there must be invasion of the orbit or other extensive structures. The MRI of the orbits \"shows no orbital or lacrimal gland involvement.\" The negative PET-CT further supports the absence of sinus or CNS disease. Therefore, the lesion is not $\\mathrm{T4}$.\n\nThe clinical findings unequivocally demonstrate that the tumor is confined to the bulbar conjunctiva, with no involvement of other conjunctival subsites, the globe, or the orbit. Based on the AJCC $8$th edition criteria, this corresponds to a clinical T category of $\\mathrm{cT1}$. The prefix 'c' denotes clinical staging, based on physical examination and imaging, as performed in this case.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{cT1}$**\nThis category is defined as \"Tumor confined to the bulbar conjunctiva.\" The problem statement explicitly details that the lesion is \"localized to the temporal bulbar conjunctiva\" and \"confined to the bulbar conjunctiva.\" This is a perfect match with the definition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{cT2}$**\nThis category requires the involvement of the forniceal conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctiva, and/or caruncle. The problem states there is \"no involvement of the forniceal or palpebral conjunctiva, and no caruncular involvement.\"\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{cT3}$**\nThis category requires invasion into adjacent ocular structures (cornea, sclera), eyelids, or lacrimal sac. The problem states there is \"no extension onto the cornea,\" \"no scleral or intraocular extension\" (from MRI), and normal eyelids.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{cT4}$**\nThis category requires invasion of the orbit, sinuses, or CNS.

This advanced problem delves into the core principles of modern radiation oncology, asking you to define safety constraints based on organ radiobiology and to devise adaptation strategies when these limits are challenged. Engaging with this scenario will deepen your understanding of how concepts like the linear-quadratic model and serial organ tolerance are translated into practical, patient-specific treatment planning .",

            "problem": "A patient with biopsy-proven extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) involving the medial orbital soft tissues has a Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) that abuts the intraorbital segment of the optic nerve. The intent is definitive external beam radiation therapy with a conventional fractionation prescription of $30$ Gray (Gy) in $15$ fractions of $2$ Gy per fraction to the Planning Target Volume (PTV). You are asked to select the most appropriate dose-volume constraints for the optic nerve and retina and to identify plan adaptation strategies if those constraints are exceeded.\n\nUse foundational radiobiological reasoning that distinguishes serial from parallel organ architecture and the linear-quadratic model for fractionation response. In particular, recall that:\n- In serial organs, damage to a small high-dose subvolume critically compromises function, so constraints emphasize $D_{\\max}$-type limits (e.g., $D_{0.03\\ \\text{cc}}$).\n- In parallel organs, function depends on the fraction of parenchyma spared, so constraints emphasize mean dose and intermediate-volume limits (e.g., $D_{\\text{mean}}$, $V_x$).\n- The linear-quadratic model gives the biologically effective dose as $BED = n d \\left(1 + \\dfrac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$, where $n$ is number of fractions, $d$ is dose per fraction, and $\\alpha/\\beta$ characterizes tissue sensitivity; lymphoma has a relatively high $\\alpha/\\beta$ (early-responding, approximately $10$ Gy), whereas the optic nerve and retina exhibit lower $\\alpha/\\beta$ values (late-responding, approximately $2$–$3$ Gy).\n\nChoose the single best option that provides appropriate constraint metrics and values for the optic nerve and retina, and outlines scientifically coherent plan adaptation strategies if constraints are exceeded.\n\nA.

MALT lymphoma of the orbit is a known clinical entity. The treatment paradigm, dose prescription ($30$ Gy in $15$ fractions), distinction between serial and parallel organs, dose-volume constraints, and the linear-quadratic model are all fundamental, non-controversial concepts in radiotherapy.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides a clear basis for a rigorous, principle-based analysis. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe primary challenge is to deliver a curative dose of radiation to the PTV, which encompasses the GTV, while respecting the tolerance of the abutting optic nerve and nearby retina.\n\n1.  **Characterization of Organs at Risk (OARs):**\n    *   **Optic Nerve:** This is the archetypal **serial organ**. Its function is signal conduction. A small volume of damage exceeding its tolerance threshold can transect the nerve functionally, leading to irreversible blindness. Therefore, dose constraints must strictly limit the maximum dose delivered to any small part of the nerve. This is best represented by a maximum point dose ($D_{\\max}$) or, more accurately, the maximum dose to a small volume, such as $D_{0.03\\ \\text{cc}}$. The established tolerance dose for the optic nerve to keep the risk of radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) below an acceptable level (e.g., $<5\\%$) is a maximum dose of $54$ Gy when delivered in $2$ Gy fractions. This is an equivalent dose in $2$ Gy fractions ($EQD2$).\n    *   **Retina:** The retina has features of both serial and parallel organs. A small high-dose area can cause a scotoma (blind spot), a serial-type injury, while widespread lower-dose injury can degrade overall visual acuity, a parallel-type injury. Consequently, a comprehensive set of constraints would include limits on both maximum dose (to prevent focal necrosis) and mean dose (to preserve global function). Common constraints are a $D_{\\max}$ of approximately $50$ Gy ($EQD2$) and a $D_{\\text{mean}}$ of approximately $45$ Gy ($EQD2$).\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the Prescription and Radiobiology:**\n    The prescription is $n=15$ fractions, $d=2$ Gy/fraction. The total dose is $30$ Gy. Since $d=2$ Gy, the physical dose is numerically equal to the $EQD2$.\n    The clinical goal is to spare the late-responding optic nerve and retina (low $\\alpha/\\beta \\approx 3$ Gy) while successfully treating the early-responding lymphoma (high $\\alpha/\\beta \\approx 10$ Gy).\n    The linear-quadratic formula, $BED = n d \\left(1 + \\dfrac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$, shows that for a given tumor BED, decreasing the dose per fraction $d$ (and correspondingly increasing $n$) selectively reduces the BED delivered to late-responding tissues. For instance, changing the fractionation to a smaller $d$ is a powerful strategy to increase the therapeutic ratio if the optic nerve constraint is violated.\n\n3.  **Hierarchy of Adaptation Strategies:**\n    If initial treatment planning fails to meet OAR constraints, a cascade of strategies should be employed:\n    *   **Tier 1 (Planning Optimization):** Re-optimize the plan using advanced technologies. Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) are superior to 3D conformal radiation for creating steep dose gradients, allowing high dose to the target and low dose to the adjacent OAR. Using non-coplanar beam angles can further improve sparing.\n    *   **Tier 2 (Increased Precision):** Implement daily Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT). Verifying the target and OAR positions daily reduces geometric uncertainties, allowing for a reduction in the PTV margin. A smaller PTV, particularly where it abuts the OAR, is one of the most effective ways to lower OAR dose.\n    *   **Tier 3 (Radiobiological/Modality Change):** If constraints are still not met, consider more advanced options.\n        *   **Fractionation Change:** Change the prescription to a smaller dose per fraction (e.g., $1.8$ Gy/fraction) to exploit the differential $\\alpha/\\beta$ effect and spare the optic nerve.\n        *   **Proton Therapy:** Protons have no exit dose beyond the Bragg peak, making them ideal for sparing structures distal to the target. This would be a highly effective but resource-intensive solution.\n    *   **Tier 4 (Clinical Trade-offs):** If all else fails, a clinical discussion about trade-offs is necessary. This may involve accepting a minor constraint violation with informed consent, dose de-escalation to the PTV (potentially reducing tumor control probability), or integrating systemic therapy (like rituximab) to enhance tumor response, thereby allowing for a safer, lower radiation dose.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Optic nerve constraint: $D_{\\max} \\le 54$ Gy ($EQD2$). Retina constraints: $D_{\\text{mean}} \\le 45$ Gy, and $D_{10\\%} \\le 50$ Gy. If exceeded: reduce Planning Target Volume (PTV) margins without image guidance, increase beam energy to improve penetration, and lower total dose without adjusting fraction size.**\n- **Constraints:** The optic nerve constraint is correct. The retina constraints are reasonable values, though $D_{10\\%}$ is less common than a $D_{\\max}$.\n- **Adaptation Strategies:** The strategies are fundamentally flawed and dangerous. Reducing PTV margins *without* the improved accuracy of IGRT is a geometric miss waiting to happen, risking tumor recurrence. Increasing beam energy for a superficial target is generally inappropriate and will not necessarily improve sparing.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Optic nerve constraint: $V_{40\\ \\text{Gy}} \\le 5\\%$. Retina constraint: $V_{20\\ \\text{Gy}} \\le 0\\%$. If exceeded: increase the dose per fraction to $4$ Gy to shorten treatment time, add posterior orbital bolus, and accept increased hot spots near the optic nerve.**\n- **Constraints:** The use of a volumetric constraint ($V_{40\\ \\text{Gy}}$) for the optic nerve is inappropriate for a serial organ. The retina constraint ($V_{20\\ \\text{Gy}} \\le 0\\%$) is clinically unrealistic for a $30$ Gy plan where the PTV abuts OARs.\n- **Adaptation Strategies:** These are counterproductive. Increasing the dose per fraction to $4$ Gy would dramatically *increase* the BED to the late-responding optic nerve, elevating the risk of toxicity. A \"posterior orbital bolus\" is nonsensical. \"Accepting increased hot spots\" on the optic nerve is the exact outcome to be avoided.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Optic nerve constraint: $D_{\\max} \\le 25$ Gy (any fractionation). Retina constraint: $D_{\\text{mean}} \\le 20$ Gy. If exceeded: deliver a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the GTV while blocking the optic nerve with a multileaf collimator (MLC) aperture and maintain the same number of fractions.**\n- **Constraints:** The dose limits of $25$ Gy and $20$ Gy are overly conservative and not based on standard evidence-based tolerance data. The parenthetical \"(any fractionation)\" is a radiobiologically incorrect statement, as tissue tolerance is highly dependent on fraction size.\n- **Adaptation Strategies:** A Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) increases the dose to the GTV, which abuts the optic nerve. This would make the problem of sparing the nerve *more* difficult, not less. \"Blocking\" the nerve with an MLC would likely mean under-dosing the part of the tumor adjacent to it.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Optic nerve constraints: $D_{0.03\\ \\text{cc}} \\le 54$ Gy ($EQD2$) and $D_{\\max} \\le 54$ Gy ($EQD2$). Retina constraints: $D_{\\max} \\le 50$ Gy ($EQD2$) and $D_{\\text{mean}} \\le 45$ Gy ($EQD2$). If exceeded: re-optimize prioritizing serial-organ sparing with Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) using non-coplanar beams and daily Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT); decrease fraction size $d$ and increase $n$ to maintain tumor $BED$ while reducing late-tissue $BED$ given lower $\\alpha/\\beta$ for optic nerve and retina; consider proton therapy to exploit the Bragg peak for distal sparing; if constraints remain violated, shrink PTV margins based on improved motion management and multimodal imaging, and consider dose de-escalation with staged treatment or integration of systemic therapy (e.g., rituximab) to lower radiation dose without compromising tumor control.**\n- **Constraints:** These are the correct, state-of-the-art constraints. The use of $D_{0.03\\ \\text{cc}}$ is a precise formulation for a serial organ like the optic nerve, and the values are consistent with QUANTEC guidelines. The retina constraints correctly use both a $D_{\\max}$ and $D_{\\text{mean}}$.\n- **Adaptation Strategies:** This option presents a comprehensive, logical, and scientifically sound hierarchy of modern radiotherapeutic strategies. It correctly identifies IMRT/VMAT/IGRT as initial steps, correctly applies the LQ model to justify changing fractionation, correctly identifies the role of proton therapy, and correctly describes the final clinical trade-offs of margin reduction (with IGRT justification), dose de-escalation, and integration of systemic therapy. This option perfectly aligns with the principles outlined in the problem statement.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.",
