            "introduction": "At the heart of optogenetics lies the ability of light-sensitive proteins like Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to function as light-gated ion channels. The dynamic interplay between the channel's open and closed states dictates the neural response, and understanding this behavior is fundamental to designing effective stimulation paradigms. This practice problem  invites you to model this process from first principles, deriving the steady-state open-channel fraction to quantify how the channel population responds to continuous illumination.",

            "problem": "A population of identical Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) molecules embedded in retinal ganglion cell membranes is modeled as a two-state system, with a closed state and an open, conducting state. Under continuous illumination, assume that the fraction of open channels, denoted by $O(t)$, evolves according to the law of mass action applied to state transitions. The forward transition rate into the open state is proportional to the product of a bimolecular on-rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and an effective opsin activation concentration $[A]$ that remains constant under the illumination protocol, while the reverse transition out of the open state occurs with a first-order off-rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a population of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) molecules as a two-state system, consisting of a closed state, which we denote by $C$, and an open, conducting state, denoted by $O$. The transitions between these states are governed by mass-action kinetics. The kinetic scheme is:\n$$ C \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} O $$\nThe forward transition from $C$ to $O$ is characterized by a pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_1$. The problem states this rate is proportional to the product of a bimolecular on-rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and a constant effective opsin activation concentration $[A]$. Thus, we define $k_1$ as:\n$$ k_{1} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A] $$\nThe reverse transition from $O$ to $C$ is a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\nLet $O(t)$ and $C(t)$ be the fractions of channels in the open and closed states, respectively, at time $t$. Since the system is comprised entirely of these two states, the sum of their fractions must be unity:\n$$ O(t) + C(t) = 1 $$\nThis conservation law allows us to express the fraction of closed channels in terms of the open channels: $C(t) = 1 - O(t)$.\n\nThe time evolution of the fraction of open channels, $O(t)$, is described by a differential equation. The rate of change of $O(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dO(t)}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of channel opening and the rate of channel closing.\nThe rate of opening is the product of the forward rate constant, $k_1$, and the fraction of channels in the closed state, $C(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of opening} = k_{1} C(t) = k_{1} (1 - O(t)) $$\nThe rate of closing is the product of the reverse rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and the fraction of channels in the open state, $O(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of closing} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} O(t) $$\nCombining these gives the full kinetic equation for $O(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dO(t)}{dt} = k_{1}(1 - O(t)) - k_{\\mathrm{off}}O(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dO(t)}{dt} = k_{1} - k_{1}O(t) - k_{\\mathrm{off}}O(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dO(t)}{dt} = k_{1} - (k_{1} + k_{\\mathrm{off}})O(t) $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state open-channel fraction, $O_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. At steady state, the system is in equilibrium, meaning the net rate of change of state populations is zero. Therefore, we set $\\frac{dO(t)}{dt} = 0$ and solve for the corresponding fraction $O_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ 0 = k_{1} - (k_{1} + k_{\\mathrm{off}})O_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $O_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ (k_{1} + k_{\\mathrm{off}})O_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{1} $$\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{1} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_1$:\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A]}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A] + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nThis is the general analytical solution for the steady-state open-channel fraction.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ [A] = 1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\nFirst, we must express the concentration $[A]$ in the base unit of Molarity ($\\mathrm{M}$):\n$$ [A] = 1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M} $$\nNext, we calculate the value of the pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_1 = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A]$:\n$$ k_{1} = (1 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values of $k_1$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ into the expression for $O_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 100\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{101} $$\nThe problem asks for a decimal value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{1}{101} \\approx 0.0099009900... $$\nRounding this value to $4$ significant figures yields:\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\approx 0.009901 $$\nThis result is a dimensionless fraction, as expected.",

            "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the retinal irradiance, $E_{\\text{retina}}$, and compute its value. Irradiance is defined as radiant power per unit area. The calculation proceeds in three main steps: determining the radiant power reaching the retina, determining the area of the illuminated spot on the retina, and then computing their ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the radiant power incident on the retina, $P_{\\text{retina}}$. The problem states that the fundus projector outputs a nominal radiant power of $P_{\\text{out}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mW}$ at the corneal plane. The ocular media transmit a fraction $T = 0.60$ of this power to the retina. Therefore, the power at the retina is:\n$$P_{\\text{retina}} = T \\cdot P_{\\text{out}}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the area of the illuminated spot on the retina, $A_{\\text{retina}}$. The spot has an angular diameter of $\\theta_{\\text{diam}} = 5^{\\circ}$. The retinal magnification factor, $M = 0.29\\,\\mathrm{mm/deg}$, provides a conversion from visual angle in degrees to linear size in millimeters on the retina. The linear diameter of the spot on the retina, $d_{\\text{retina}}$, is thus:\n$$d_{\\text{retina}} = M \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{diam}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the spot is uniform and circular.
