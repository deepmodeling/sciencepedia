The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the size of a relaxing retinectomy needed to correct a circumferential length mismatch between the retina and the scleral bed. We model the sclera and the intrinsically contracted retina as concentric circular arcs with radii $R_s$ and $R_r$, respectively.\n\nLet's consider a circumferential segment of the eye subtended by some central angle $\\alpha$. The arc length of the scleral bed, $L_s$, and the corresponding arc length of the retina, $L_r$, are given by:\n$$L_s = \\alpha R_s$$\n$$L_r = \\alpha R_r$$\nThe problem states that there is a circumferential shortening, or mismatch, quantified as $\\Delta L$. This mismatch is the difference between the length of the scleral bed and the available length of the retina over the region of interest. Let's denote the initial lengths of a segment of sclera and retina as $L_{s,initial}$ and $L_{r,initial}$. The initial mismatch is:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{s,initial} - L_{r,initial}$$\nThis is the total length deficit that the surgery aims to correct.\n\nA relaxing retinectomy is performed by excising a wedge of retinal tissue that subtends a central angle $\\theta$. The arc length of the excised retinal tissue, measured along its own curvature, is:\n$$L_{cut} = \\theta R_r$$\nThis is the quantity we are ultimately asked to compute.\n\nThe surgical procedure of excising the retinal wedge and then closing the resulting gap has two effects on the geometry of the problem.\n$1$. The total length of retinal tissue is reduced by $L_{cut}$. The final length of the retina is $L_{r,final} = L_{r,initial} - L_{cut} = L_{r,initial} - \\theta R_r$.\n$2$. The length of the scleral bed that the retina must now cover is also reduced, because the two cut edges of the retina are brought together, bypassing a scleral arc of angle $\\theta$. The reduction in the required scleral length is $\\theta R_s$. The final length of the scleral bed to be covered is $L_{s,final} = L_{s,initial} - \\theta R_s$.\n\nThe goal of the surgery is to eliminate the mismatch, meaning the final length of the available retina must equal the final length of the scleral bed it covers.\n$$L_{r,final} = L_{s,final}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the final lengths:\n$$L_{r,initial} - \\theta R_r = L_{s,initial} - \\theta R_s$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate the terms related to the retinectomy angle $\\theta$ on one side and the initial lengths on the other:\n$$\\theta R_s - \\theta R_r = L_{s,initial} - L_{r,initial}$$\nFactoring out $\\theta$ and substituting the definition of the initial mismatch $\\Delta L$:\n$$\\theta (R_s - R_r) = \\Delta L$$\nThis equation fulfills the first part of the task, which is to derive an expression for the required central angle $\\theta$ in terms of $R_s$, $R_r$, and $\\Delta L$. Solving for $\\theta$ gives:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\Delta L}{R_s - R_r}$$\nThe second part of the task is to compute the circumferential arc length of retina that must be excised. This is the quantity we defined as $L_{cut}$:\n$$L_{cut} = \\theta R_r$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\theta$ into this equation, we obtain the analytical expression for the excised retinal arc length:\n$$L_{cut} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta L}{R_s - R_r} \\right) R_r$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values to compute the length of the cut.\nGiven:\n-   $R_{s} = 10.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n-   $R_{r} = 9.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n-   $\\Delta L = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the difference in radii:\n$$R_s - R_r = 10.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm} - 9.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nNow, we substitute this and the other values into the expression for $L_{cut}$:\n$$L_{cut} = \\left( \\frac{2.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}} \\right) \\times 9.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$L_{cut} = 2.0 \\times 9.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 19.6 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem explicitly requests the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $19.6$ has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$L_{cut} = 19.60 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$",

The fold can be idealized as an axisymmetric “tent” of the retina with an apex elevation of $h_{0}$ above the retinal bed over a circular footprint of radius $a$. The combined effect of retinal elasticity and epiretinal membrane contracture is approximated near the operating point by a linear stiffness $k$ relating the net flattening load to apex displacement. Perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) is instilled, forming a free surface at height $H$ above the fold apex. The PFCL is treated as a static incompressible fluid producing a hydrostatic pressure $p=\\rho g H$ at the apex, distributed approximately uniformly over the circular footprint of area $A=\\pi a^{2}$. The surgeon can apply additional downward traction at the apex using end-grasping microforceps, modeled as a point load that adds to PFCL loading to produce the required net flattening load. The retina tears when the in-plane tensile stress at the grasped site reaches a critical tensile strength $\\sigma_{c}$.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the minimum PFCL column height, $H_{\\min}$, required to ensure the grasping force, $F_g$, does not exceed the safety limit $\\beta F_{\\mathrm{tear}}$.\n\nFirst, we model the total force required to completely flatten the retinal fold. The fold has an initial apex elevation of $h_0$. The problem states that the system has a linearized stiffness $k$. According to Hooke's law, the total force, $F_{\\mathrm{total}}$, needed to displace the apex by $h_0$ and flatten the fold is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} = k h_{0}$$\n\nThis total force is provided by the combination of the force from the PFCL hydrostatic pressure, $F_{\\mathrm{PFCL}}$, and the additional grasping force from the surgeon's forceps, $F_g$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} = F_{\\mathrm{PFCL}} + F_g$$\n\nThe force from the PFCL is due to the hydrostatic pressure, $p = \\rho g H$, acting over the circular footprint of the fold. The area of this footprint is $A = \\pi a^2$. Assuming uniform pressure distribution as per the problem statement:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{PFCL}} = p A = (\\rho g H)(\\pi a^2)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and $F_{\\mathrm{PFCL}}$ into the force balance equation gives:\n$$k h_0 = \\rho g H \\pi a^2 + F_g$$\n\nWe can solve this for the required grasping force $F_g$ as a function of the PFCL height $H$:\n$$F_g = k h_0 - \\rho g H \\pi a^2$$\n\nThe safety policy requires that the grasping force does not exceed a fraction $\\beta$ of the tearing force $F_{\\mathrm{tear}}$. Thus, the maximum allowable grasping force is $F_{g, \\max} = \\beta F_{\\mathrm{tear}}$. To find the minimum required PFCL height, $H_{\\min}$, we set the grasping force to this maximum permissible value. Any height greater than $H_{\\min}$ would further reduce the necessary grasping force, satisfying the safety condition.\n$$F_{g, \\max} = \\beta F_{\\mathrm{tear}} = k h_0 - \\rho g H_{\\min} \\pi a^2$$\n\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for $H_{\\min}$:\n$$\\rho g H_{\\min} \\pi a^2 = k h_0 - \\beta F_{\\mathrm{tear}}$$\n$$H_{\\min} = \\frac{k h_0 - \\beta F_{\\mathrm{tear}}}{\\rho g \\pi a^2}$$\n\nThe problem defines the tearing force as $F_{\\mathrm{tear}}=\\sigma_{c}\\,t\\,l$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nThe volume of the intraocular gas bubble, $V(t)$, is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = -k V(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes exponential decay. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{V(0)}^{V(t)} \\frac{1}{V'} \\, dV' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(V(t)) - \\ln(V(0)) = -kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(t)}{V(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general solution for the volume as a function of time:\n$$\nV(t) = V(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem states that the initial condition is a complete fill of the vitreous cavity, so $V(0) = V_{\\mathrm{vit}}$. The volume decay is therefore:\n$$\nV(t) = V_{\\mathrm{vit}} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nAs requested, we first demonstrate the relationship between the absorption rate constant $k$ and the gas half-life $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time at which the volume has decreased to one-half of its initial value, i.e., $V(t_{1/2}) = V(0)/2 = V_{\\mathrm{vit}}/2$. Substituting this into our solution:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{vit}}}{2} = V_{\\mathrm{vit}} \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $V_{\\mathrm{vit}}$ isolates the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides allows us to solve for $k$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nThus, the rate constant $k$ is directly determined by the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nThis confirms the relationship between the absorption rate and half-life inherent in the first-order kinetics model.\n\nNext, we derive the analytic expression for the tamponade duration, $t_{\\mathrm{tam}}$. This is the time at which the bubble volume reaches the threshold volume, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = f V_{\\mathrm{vit}}$. We set $V(t_{\\mathrm{tam}}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ in our volume decay equation:\n$$\nf V_{\\mathrm{vit}} = V_{\\mathrm{vit}} \\exp(-k t_{\\mathrm{tam}})\n$$\nThe absolute volume of the vitreous cavity, $V_{\\mathrm{vit}}$, cancels, indicating the result is independent of the specific eye size:\n$$\nf = \\exp(-k t_{\\mathrm{tam}})\n$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{tam}}$:\n$$\n\\ln(f) = -k t_{\\mathrm{tam}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tam}} = -\\frac{\\ln(f)}{k}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $k$ in terms of $t_{1/2}$ to obtain the desired expression for $t_{\\mathrm{tam}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tam}} = -\\frac{\\ln(f)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = -t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(f)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in a more intuitive form using logarithm properties:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tam}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{-\\ln(f)}{\\ln(2)} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{\\ln(2)} = t_{1/2} \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for the tamponade duration in terms of the gas half-life $t_{1/2}$ and the volume fraction $f$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for $t_{\\mathrm{tam}}$ for both gases using the provided data: $f=0.10$, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{SF6}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{days}$, and $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{C3F8}} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nFor sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$):\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tam,SF6}} = -(3.0\\,\\mathrm{days}) \\frac{\\ln(0.10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx -(3.0) \\frac{-2.302585}{0.693147} \\approx 9.965784\\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the tamponade duration for $SF_6$ is $9.966\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nFor perfluoropropane ($C_3F_8$):\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tam,C3F8}} = -(7.0\\,\\mathrm{days}) \\frac{\\ln(0.10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx -(7.0) \\frac{-2.302585}{0.693147} \\approx 23.253496\\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the tamponade duration for $C_3F_8$ is $23.25\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nThe two computed durations provide the solution as required.",
