This is a standard and well-established model in ophthalmology and optometry. The given value for the refractive index difference between the cornea and air ($n_c - n_a = 0.376$) is consistent with standard values (e.g., $n_c \\approx 1.376$ and $n_a \\approx 1.000$).

The described effect of Orthokeratology—central corneal flattening (increase in radius of curvature) to reduce myopia—is factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($r_{initial}$, $r_{final}$, $n_c - n_a$) and a clear physical model to calculate a unique answer. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and scientific terminology. It is free of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a well-defined physics problem applied to a relevant clinical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe refractive power, $P$, of a single spherical surface separating two media with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$ is given by the lensmaker's equation for a single surface:\n$$ P = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{r} $$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of curvature of the surface. For the power $P$ to be in units of diopters ($D$), the radius $r$ must be expressed in meters ($m$), as $1\\,D = 1\\,m^{-1}$.\n\nIn this problem, the light travels from air ($n_1 = n_a$) into the cornea ($n_2 = n_c$). The power of the anterior corneal surface, $P_{cornea}$, is therefore:\n$$ P_{cornea} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r} $$\nWe are given the value for the difference in refractive indices, $n_c - n_a = 0.376$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial power of the corneal surface, $P_{initial}$, before the Orthokeratology treatment. The initial radius is $r_{initial} = 7.80\\,\\text{mm}$, which must be converted to meters:\n$$ r_{initial} = 7.80\\,\\text{mm} = 7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m $$\nThe initial power is:\n$$ P_{initial} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{initial}} = \\frac{0.376}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the final power of the corneal surface, $P_{final}$, after the treatment. The treatment increases the radius of curvature (flattens the cornea) to $r_{final} = 8.00\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$ r_{final} = 8.00\\,\\text{mm} = 8.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m $$\nThe final power is:\n$$ P_{final} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{final}} = \\frac{0.376}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m} $$\n\nThe change in the anterior surface power, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the final and initial powers:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{final} - P_{initial} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for power:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{final}} - \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{initial}} $$\nFactoring out the common term $(n_c - n_a)$:\n$$ \\Delta P = (n_c - n_a) \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{final}} - \\frac{1}{r_{initial}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta P = 0.376 \\left( \\frac{1}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}} - \\frac{1}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}} \\right) $$\nCalculating the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{1}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = 125.0\\,m^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 128.205128\\,m^{-1} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 0.376 \\times (125.0 - 128.205128) $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 0.376 \\times (-3.205128) $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx -1.205128\\,D $$\n\nThe problem states to neglect all other optical components of the eye. In this simplified model, the total refractive change of the eye is equal to the change in power of the anterior corneal surface. A myopic eye has excessive positive power. The calculated change in power, $\\Delta P$, is negative, which signifies a reduction in the eye's total power. This reduction in power corresponds to the reduction in myopia.\n\nThe question asks for the magnitude of the myopia reduction. This is the absolute value of the change in power:\n$$ \\text{Myopia Reduction} = |\\Delta P| \\approx |-1.205128\\,D| = 1.205128\\,D $$\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ 1.205128\\,D \\approx 1.21\\,D $$\nThe magnitude of the myopia reduction is $1.21$ diopters.",

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem will be solved using paraxial geometric optics for a thin lens.\n\nLet $P_C$ be the optical power of the central, correctly focused zone of the eye's optical system. For a distant object (incoming rays are parallel), these rays are brought to a focus at the retina. In the simplified model specified, the eye's axial length, $L$, is equal to the focal length of this central zone, $f_C$.\n$$L = f_C = \\frac{1}{P_C}$$\nThe problem states that the annular region of the cornea, extending from radius $r_{\\mathrm{tz}}$ to the pupil edge radius $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$, has an additional relative power of $\\Delta P$. The total power in this annular zone, $P_A$, is therefore:\n$$P_A = P_C + \\Delta P$$\nRays passing through this annulus will be focused at a different distance, $f_A$:\n$$f_A = \\frac{1}{P_A} = \\frac{1}{P_C + \\Delta P}$$\nSince $\\Delta P = +2.00\\,\\mathrm{D} > 0$, we have $P_A > P_C$, which implies $f_A < f_C = L$. The rays from the annulus are focused in front of the retina. After this focal point, they diverge until they strike the retina, forming a blur.\n\nWe now derive the size of this blur on the retina. Consider a ray entering the eye parallel to the optical axis at a height $y$ within the annular zone (i.e., $r_{\\mathrm{tz}} \\le y \\le R_{\\mathrm{p}}$). After passing through the thin lens, this ray is refracted such that it crosses the optical axis at the focal point $F_A$, located at a distance $x=f_A$ from the lens. The path of the ray after the lens is a straight line passing through the point $(x=0, \\text{height}=y)$ at the lens and the point $(x=f_A, \\text{height}=0)$ at the focal plane.\n\nThe height of this ray, $h$, at an arbitrary distance $x$ from the lens is given by the line equation:\n$$h(x) = y - \\left(\\frac{y}{f_A}\\right)x = y\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{f_A}\\right)$$\nThe retina is located at the distance $x=L$. The height of the ray on the retina, denoted $h_b(y)$, is therefore:\n$$h_b(y) = y\\left(1 - \\frac{L}{f_A}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $L$ and $f_A$ in terms of optical power:\n$$h_b(y) = y\\left(1 - \\frac{1/P_C}{1/P_A}\\right) = y\\left(1 - \\frac{P_A}{P_C}\\right)$$\nNow, substitute $P_A = P_C + \\Delta P$:\n$$h_b(y) = y\\left(1 - \\frac{P_C + \\Delta P}{P_C}\\right) = y\\left(\\frac{P_C - (P_C + \\Delta P)}{P_C}\\right) = -y \\frac{\\Delta P}{P_C}$$\nThe radius of the blur pattern on the retina is the absolute value of this height, $|h_b(y)|$. The halo is formed by rays passing through the entire annulus. The outer edge of the halo corresponds to rays passing at the edge of the pupil, $y = R_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The maximum radius of the blur on the retina, $|h_{b, \\max}|$, is:\n$$|h_{b, \\max}| = R_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{P_C}$$\nThe problem asks for the angular diameter $2\\theta_{\\max}$, where $\\theta_{\\max}$ is the half-angle subtended by this maximum blur radius at the eye's nodal region. For the specified thin-lens model (where the surrounding medium is effectively air, with $n'=1$), the nodal point is at the lens. The angle $\\theta_{\\max}$, for small angles, is given by:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} \\approx \\tan(\\theta_{\\max}) = \\frac{|h_{b, \\max}|}{L}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $|h_{b, \\max}|$ and $L$:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{P_C}}{1/P_C} = R_{\\mathrm{p}} \\Delta P$$\nThis remarkably simple result shows that the angular radius of the halo is the product of the pupil radius and the power difference of the annulus. The result is in radians if $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is in meters and $\\Delta P$ is in diopters ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$).\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\nPupil radius $R_{\\mathrm{p}} = 3.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nRelative power increase $\\Delta P = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{D} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe angular half-angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ in radians is:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = (3.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (2.00\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 6.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{radians}$$\nThe angular diameter of the halo is $2\\theta_{\\max}$:\n$$2\\theta_{\\max} = 2 \\times (6.50 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.30 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{radians}$$\nFinally, we convert this value to degrees. The conversion factor is $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$ degrees per radian.\n$$2\\theta_{\\max} (\\text{degrees}) = (1.30 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 0.744845...^\\circ$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.745^\\circ$.",
