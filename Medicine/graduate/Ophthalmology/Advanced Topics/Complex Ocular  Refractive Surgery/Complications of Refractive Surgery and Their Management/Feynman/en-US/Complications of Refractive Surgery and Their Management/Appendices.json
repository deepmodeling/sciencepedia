The parameters ($CCT$, $D$, $S$, flap thickness, $RSB$) are standard clinical variables in LASIK planning. The request to derive the ablation depth scaling (Munnerlyn's formula) is based on fundamental optical and geometrical principles.

A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the worst-case residual stromal bed, $RSB_{wc}$. The residual stromal bed is defined as the initial central corneal thickness ($CCT$) minus the flap thickness ($F$) and the ablation depth ($A_d$).\n\n$$\nRSB = CCT - F - A_d\n$$\n\nTo determine the worst-case scenario, we must use the thickest probable flap and the full planned ablation depth.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Worst-Case Flap Thickness ($F_{wc}$)**\n    The problem specifies a worst-case flap as being $2$ standard deviations thicker than the mean.\n    - Mean flap thickness, $F_{mean} = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n    - Standard deviation, $SD = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\n    The worst-case flap thickness, $F_{wc}$, is therefore:\n    $$\n    F_{wc} = F_{mean} + 2 \\cdot SD = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 2 \\cdot (10\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 20\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 120\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Derive and Calculate the Central Ablation Depth ($A_d$)**\n    The problem requires a derivation of the ablation depth from core principles. Myopic correction involves flattening the central cornea by removing a small, lens-shaped volume of stromal tissue (a lenticule). This lenticule can be approximated as a thin plano-concave lens, but it is more direct to consider the geometry of the removed tissue. The ablated tissue forms a cap of a sphere.\n\n    Let $A_d$ be the central ablation depth (the sagitta of the spherical cap), $S$ be the diameter of the optical zone, and $R$ be the radius of curvature of the ablated surface. The radius of the optical zone is $y = S/2$. From the sagittal theorem (or paraxial approximation for a sphere), the relationship between these quantities is:\n    $$\n    A_d \\approx \\frac{y^2}{2R} = \\frac{(S/2)^2}{2R} = \\frac{S^2}{8R}\n    $$\n    This approximation is valid because the ablation depth $A_d$ is much smaller than the radius of curvature $R$.\n\n    Next, we relate the radius $R$ to the required dioptric correction, $D$. The power of a single refractive surface is given by $P = (n_2 - n_1) / r$, where $n_2$ and $n_1$ are the refractive indices of the media and $r$ is the radius of curvature. We are effectively removing a lenticule whose power, $P_{lenticule}$, must be equal and opposite to the desired myopic correction $D$. The power of this lenticule, treated as a thin lens in air, is determined by its curved surface.\n    $$\n    P_{lenticule} = -D = \\frac{n_{cornea} - n_{air}}{R}\n    $$\n    For myopic correction, $D$ is negative, so $-D$ is positive, which is consistent with the positive power of the convex-plano lenticule being removed. Using the standard refractive index of the cornea, $n_{cornea} \\approx 1.376$, and for air, $n_{air} \\approx 1$.\n    The magnitude of the dioptric correction is $|D|$.\n    $$\n    |D| = \\frac{n_{cornea} - 1}{R} \\implies R = \\frac{n_{cornea} - 1}{|D|}\n    $$\n    Substituting this expression for $R$ into the equation for $A_d$:\n    $$\n    A_d \\approx \\frac{S^2}{8} \\left( \\frac{|D|}{n_{cornea} - 1} \\right) = \\frac{|D| S^2}{8(n_{cornea} - 1)}\n    $$\n    Using $n_{cornea} = 1.376$, the denominator becomes $8(1.376 - 1) = 8(0.376) = 3.008$. This value is commonly approximated as $3$. This gives the well-established Munnerlyn formula for myopic ablation:\n    $$\n    A_d \\approx \\frac{|D| S^2}{3}\n    $$\n    The ablation depth $A_d$ will be in meters if $S$ is in meters and $D$ is in diopters ($m^{-1}$). It is conventional to perform the calculation with $S$ in millimeters and obtain $A_d$ in micrometers.\n    - Correction, $D = -5.00\\,\\text{D}$, so $|D| = 5.00$ D.\n    - Optical zone diameter, $S = 6.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    $$\n    A_d = \\frac{5.00 \\cdot (6.0)^2}{3} = \\frac{5.00 \\cdot 36}{3} = 5.00 \\cdot 12 = 60\n    $$\n    The central ablation depth is $A_d = 60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Worst-Case Residual Stromal Bed ($RSB_{wc}$)**\n    Now we can calculate $RSB_{wc}$ using the values for $CCT$, $F_{wc}$, and $A_d$.\n    - $CCT = 505\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n    - $F_{wc} = 120\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n    - $A_d = 60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\n    $$\n    RSB_{wc} = CCT - F_{wc} - A_d = 505\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 120\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 60\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n    $$\n    $$\n    RSB_{wc} = 505\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 180\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 325\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Compare with Institutional Criterion**\n    The calculated worst-case residual stromal bed is $RSB_{wc} = 325\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. The institutional safety criterion is $RSB \\ge 300\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n    Since $325\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\ge 300\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the planned procedure meets the specified safety margin.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the worst-case central RSB in $\\mu\\text{m}$, rounded to three significant figures.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the post-enhancement residual stromal bed ($R_f$) and evaluate it against a safety criterion. This requires two steps: first, deriving a formula for the depth of corneal tissue ablated, and second, applying this to the pre-enhancement stromal bed thickness.\n\nLet $R_0$ be the pre-enhancement residual stromal bed thickness, and let $t_c$ be the central ablation depth. The post-enhancement residual stromal bed, $R_f$, is given by the principle of tissue conservation:\n$$R_f = R_0 - t_c$$\nOur primary task is to derive an expression for $t_c$. The problem specifies using a \"widely tested geometric ablation depth model for myopic corrections.\" This refers to a model based on the geometry of the tissue removal, commonly known as the Munnerlyn formula.\n\nWe derive this from first principles. A myopic correction flattens the central cornea, changing its radius of curvature from an initial value $r_1$ to a final, larger value $r_2$. This is achieved by ablating a lenticule of tissue that is thickest at the center and tapers to zero at the edge of the optical zone. The central ablation depth, $t_c$, is the difference in the sagitta (the height of a circular arc) of the pre-ablation and post-ablation corneal surfaces, measured over the optical zone diameter, $Z$.\n\nThe sagitta, $s$, of a spherical surface with radius of curvature $r$ over a chord of length $Z$ is approximated for $s \\ll r$ as:\n$$s \\approx \\frac{(Z/2)^2}{2r} = \\frac{Z^2}{8r}$$\nThe ablation depth at the center is the difference between the initial sagitta ($s_1$) and the final sagitta ($s_2$):\n$$t_c = s_1 - s_2 \\approx \\frac{Z^2}{8r_1} - \\frac{Z^2}{8r_2} = \\frac{Z^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2}\\right)$$\nThe change in corneal power, which is the dioptric correction $|D|$, is related to the change in curvature by the lensmaker's equation for a single surface:\n$$|D| = (n_c - n_{air}) \\left(\\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_c$ is the refractive index of the cornea (approximately $1.376$) and $n_{air}$ is the refractive index of air (approximately $1$). Thus, we can write:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2} = \\frac{|D|}{n_c - 1}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $t_c$:\n$$t_c \\approx \\frac{Z^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{|D|}{n_c - 1}\\right) = \\frac{Z^2 |D|}{8(n_c - 1)}$$\nFor practical clinical use, and in accordance with the problem's reference to a \"widely tested\" model, the term $8(n_c - 1)$ is simplified. Using $n_c \\approx 1.375$, the denominator becomes $8(1.375 - 1) = 8(0.375) = 3$. This yields the standard simplified Munnerlyn formula, where $Z$ is given in millimeters and $|D|$ in diopters, to yield $t_c$ in micrometers:\n$$t_c \\approx \\frac{Z^2 |D|}{3}$$\nNow, we can write the full expression for the post-enhancement RSB as requested:\n$$R_f = R_0 - \\frac{Z^2 |D|}{3}$$\nThis is the derived expression. We now proceed to compute the numerical value.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Pre-enhancement RSB: $R_0 = 300$ $\\mu$m\n-   Optical zone diameter: $Z = 6.5$ mm\n-   Dioptric correction: $D = -1.75$ D, so the magnitude is $|D| = 1.75$ D\n\nFirst, calculate the central ablation depth, $t_c$:\n$$t_c = \\frac{(6.5)^2 \\times 1.75}{3} = \\frac{42.25 \\times 1.75}{3} = \\frac{73.9375}{3}$$\n$$t_c \\approx 24.64583... \\text{ micrometers}$$\nNext, calculate the post-enhancement RSB, $R_f$:\n$$R_f = 300 - t_c = 300 - \\frac{73.9375}{3} \\approx 300 - 24.64583...$$\n$$R_f \\approx 275.35416... \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R = 275.4 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nFinally, we must evaluate this result against the safety criterion, which specifies a minimal acceptable post-enhancement RSB of $280$ micrometers. We compare our calculated value $R$ to this minimum $R_{min} = 280 \\mu$m.\n$$275.4 \\mu\\text{m} < 280 \\mu\\text{m}$$\nSince $R < R_{min}$, the enhancement does not meet the specified safety criterion. Therefore, the flag $F$ is $0$.\n\nThe final result is reported as the row matrix $(R, F)$.\n$R = 275.4$\n$F = 0$\nThe result is $\\left(275.4, 0\\right)$.",

Assume the central ablation depth is described by the Munnerlyn formula, which relates the optical zone diameter $S$ (in millimeters) and the spherical correction magnitude $D$ (in diopters) to the maximum central ablation depth $t$ (in micrometers) via a quadratic dependence on $S$ and linear dependence on $D$.

Refractive laser ablation (LASIK) reduces the central corneal thickness and alters its biomechanical properties, making the cornea less resistant to applanation and causing GAT to systematically read lower than the true intraocular pressure. To quantify this error, we connect the ablation depth to the induced bias using an empirical linear correction factor.\n\nWe begin with the Munnerlyn relationship, a well-tested geometric-optics formula describing the central ablation depth as a function of the spherical correction magnitude and optical zone geometry.

For example, a measured GAT of $18$ millimeters of mercury could correspond to a true IOP near $22.225$ millimeters of mercury, which may be sufficient to precipitate interface fluid in susceptible corneas. This systematic downward bias can delay recognition and treatment of PISK, emphasizing the need to consider alternative tonometry methods less affected by corneal properties (such as dynamic contour tonometry), to interpret GAT in light of ablation depth–based corrections, and to promptly reduce steroid load and initiate intraocular pressure–lowering therapy when clinical signs of interface pathology occur despite “normal” GAT readings.",
