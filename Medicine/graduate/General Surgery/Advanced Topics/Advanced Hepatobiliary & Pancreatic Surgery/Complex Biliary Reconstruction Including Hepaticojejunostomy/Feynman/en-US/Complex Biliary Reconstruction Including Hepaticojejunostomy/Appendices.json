            "problem": "A patient undergoes complex biliary reconstruction with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy after a major iatrogenic biliary injury. She is a $56$-year-old woman with a Strasberg type $E4$ injury sustained during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, referred $8$ weeks after injury once cholangitis is controlled and bilirubin is down-trending. Intraoperative assessment identifies two small ducts at the hepatic hilum that join into a short common channel measuring a luminal radius $r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$. The ductal edges are mildly inflamed but viable, and the jejunal limb is well perfused. The goal is to minimize early bile leak and late anastomotic stricture.\n\nYou must select the most appropriate combination of suture material and anastomotic technique for the hepaticojejunostomy under these conditions. Base your reasoning on the following fundamental principles and core facts:\n\n- Healing biology and support requirement: Anastomotic integrity depends on mucosa-to-mucosa apposition with minimal ischemia. Collagen deposition provides increasing strength over approximately $3$ to $6$ weeks, and bile duct and enteric mucosa require mechanical support through the early inflammatory and proliferative phases. Excess foreign body load and high-capillarity materials increase infection risk.\n\n- Material properties: Braided sutures exhibit capillarity that can wick bile and bacteria; monofilaments have lower tissue reactivity. Tensile strength retention differs: polydioxanone retains approximately $50\\%$ of tensile strength at about $4$ weeks, polyglactin $910$ loses a large fraction by $2$ to $3$ weeks, and poliglecaprone $25$ loses most tensile strength within approximately $1$ to $2$ weeks. Permanent intraluminal foreign bodies can serve as a nidus for stone formation.\n\n- Flow and radius sensitivity: For laminar flow in a cylindrical conduit, Poiseuille’s law states\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L},$$\nwhere $Q$ is volumetric flow rate, $r$ is radius, $\\Delta P$ is pressure difference, $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, and $L$ is length. Small reductions in $r$ can cause large decreases in $Q$. Anastomotic techniques that constrict the lumen or create inwardly protruding knots can reduce $r$ and predispose to stricture.\n\n- Technique considerations: Interrupted sutures allow tension adjustment around irregular ducts and may reduce purse-string constriction in small-caliber ducts compared to continuous sutures. Small bites with precise mucosa-to-mucosa apposition, knots external to the lumen, and avoidance of eversion are preferred to preserve radius and minimize intraluminal foreign bodies. In very small ducts (e.g., $r<4\\,\\text{mm}$), short internal transanastomotic stents can be considered to maintain early patency; routine external T-tubes are generally avoided in hepaticojejunostomy.\n\nWhich option best reflects the appropriate suture material and technique for this hepaticojejunostomy?\n\nA. Polyglactin $910$ (Vicryl), braided absorbable, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) $4\\text{-}0$, continuous running suture with knots tied intraluminally and relatively large tissue bites to ensure hemostasis.\n\nB.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n- **Patient and Injury**: A $56$-year-old woman with a Strasberg type $E4$ iatrogenic biliary injury.\n- **Timing**: Reconstruction is performed $8$ weeks post-injury.\n- **Clinical State**: Cholangitis is controlled, and bilirubin is down-trending.\n- **Intraoperative Findings**: Two small ducts at the hepatic hilum join into a short common channel with a luminal radius $r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$. Ductal edges are mildly inflamed but viable. The jejunal limb is well perfused.\n- **Goal**: Minimize early bile leak and late anastomotic stricture.\n- **Principle 1 (Healing Biology)**: Anastomotic integrity requires mucosa-to-mucosa apposition with minimal ischemia. Collagen deposition provides strength over $3$ to $6$ weeks. Mechanical support is needed during early healing. Excess foreign body load and high-capillarity materials increase infection risk.\n- **Principle 2 (Material Properties)**:\n    - Braided sutures have capillarity.\n    - Monofilaments have lower tissue reactivity.\n    - Tensile strength retention:\n        - Polydioxanone: $\\approx 50\\%$ at $\\approx 4$ weeks.\n        - Polyglactin $910$: loses a large fraction by $2$ to $3$ weeks.\n        - Poliglecaprone $25$: loses most strength within $\\approx 1$ to $2$ weeks.\n    - Permanent intraluminal foreign bodies can be a nidus for stone formation.\n- **Principle 3 (Flow Dynamics)**: Poiseuille’s law, $Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$, dictates that flow rate $Q$ is highly sensitive to radius $r$. Small reductions in $r$ cause large decreases in $Q$. Techniques that constrict the lumen or have inwardly protruding knots can reduce $r$.\n- **Principle 4 (Technique Considerations)**:\n    - Interrupted sutures may reduce purse-string constriction in small ducts compared to continuous sutures.\n    - Small bites, precise mucosa-to-mucosa apposition, and external knots are preferred.\n    - For small ducts (e.g., $r<4\\,\\text{mm}$), short internal transanastomotic stents can be considered.\n    - Routine external T-tubes are generally avoided in hepaticojejunostomy.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of surgery, biomaterials science, and fluid dynamics. The healing timeline for biliary tissue, properties of various suture materials, the risks associated with foreign bodies, and the hemodynamic implications of Poiseuille's law are all standard and factual knowledge in medicine and surgery. The clinical scenario (Strasberg E4 injury) is a real-world, complex surgical problem.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific clinical scenario and a clear objective. It provides a set of fundamental principles to be used as the basis for reasoning. The question asks for the \"most appropriate\" option, which implies a comparative analysis to find the optimal solution among the choices, a standard format for clinical decision-making problems.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical and scientific language. It is free from subjective claims, speculation, or bias.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). All provided information is consistent, relevant, and sufficient to derive a logically sound answer.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived by applying the provided principles to the specific clinical case.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to select the optimal combination of suture material and technique for a hepaticojejunostomy on a small duct ($r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$, diameter $d \\approx 6\\,\\text{mm}$) to minimize early leak and late stricture. We will synthesize the requirements from the provided principles and evaluate each option.\n\n**Synthesized Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Suture Material Duration**: The anastomosis requires mechanical support for the duration of healing, which is stated to be approximately $3$ to $6$ weeks. Therefore, the suture must retain significant tensile strength for at least $4$ weeks.\n2.  **Suture Material Type**: To minimize tissue reactivity and the risk of infection from wicking bile and bacteria, a monofilament suture is superior to a braided one. To avoid a long-term nidus for stone formation, an absorbable suture is strongly preferred over a nonabsorbable one.\n3.  **Suture Size**: For a small duct ($d \\approx 6\\,\\text{mm}$), a fine suture (e.g., USP $5\\text{-}0$ or $6\\text{-}0$) is necessary to permit small, precise bites and minimize tissue trauma.\n4.  **Anastomotic Technique**: To prevent luminal compromise (the \"purse-string\" effect) and subsequent stricture, which is a major risk according to Poiseuille's law ($Q \\propto r^4$), an interrupted suture technique is preferred over a continuous one for small ducts.\n5.  **Knot Placement**: Knots must be placed external to the lumen to avoid creating a foreign body nidus for stone formation and to prevent flow obstruction.\n6.  **Tissue Handling**: Small, precise mucosa-to-mucosa bites are essential to ensure a watertight seal and preserve blood supply, minimizing ischemia.\n7.  **Stenting**: The duct radius is $r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$, which falls into the category of \"very small ducts\" ($r<4\\,\\text{mm}$) for which a short internal transanastomotic stent can be considered to maintain early patency and mitigate stricture risk. External T-tubes are to be avoided.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Polyglactin $910$ (Vicryl), braided absorbable, USP $4\\text{-}0$, continuous running suture with knots tied intraluminally and relatively large tissue bites to ensure hemostasis.**\n- **Suture Material**: Polyglactin $910$ is braided, which increases infection risk via capillarity. It loses most of its tensile strength by $2$ to $3$ weeks, which is insufficient for the $3$ to $6$ week healing timeline. USP $4\\text{-}0$ is arguably too large for this delicate anastomosis.\n- **Technique**: A continuous suture risks a purse-string constriction on this small duct. Knots tied intraluminally create a nidus for stone formation. Large tissue bites cause ischemia and necrosis, impairing healing.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option violates nearly every principle outlined for a successful biliary reconstruction.\n\n**B. Polydioxanone (PDS), monofilament absorbable, USP $5\\text{-}0$, interrupted mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with small, evenly spaced bites and knots tied external to the lumen, with a short internal transanastomotic stent.**\n- **Suture Material**: Polydioxanone is a monofilament (low reactivity), absorbable (no stone nidus), and retains tensile strength for an appropriate duration ($\\approx 50\\%$ at $4$ weeks), matching the healing requirements. USP $5\\text{-}0$ is an appropriate size for this anastomosis.\n- **Technique**: An interrupted technique is ideal for a small duct. Mucosa-to-mucosa apposition with small bites and external knots is the standard of care for preserving the lumen and minimizing foreign body reaction, directly addressing the concerns raised by Poiseuille's law and healing biology.\n- **Stenting**: The use of a short internal stent is explicitly justified by the principle for ducts with $r < 4\\,\\text{mm}$ (here, $r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$) to ensure patency.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option aligns perfectly with all the synthesized requirements derived from the provided fundamental principles.\n\n**C. Polypropylene (Prolene), monofilament nonabsorbable, USP $5\\text{-}0$, continuous everting anastomosis with snug approximation and knots placed intraluminally to prevent suture slippage.**\n- **Suture Material**: Polypropylene is a nonabsorbable material. Placing a permanent foreign body in the biliary tract is highly undesirable as it will serve as a nidus for stone formation.\n- **Technique**: A continuous technique carries the purse-string risk. An everting anastomosis is incorrect; precise apposition or slight inversion is required for proper mucosal healing. Intraluminal knots are to be avoided.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The choice of a nonabsorbable suture is a critical error, and the technique described (everting, continuous, internal knots) is technically flawed for this application.\n\n**D. Silk, braided nonabsorbable, USP $4\\text{-}0$, interrupted technique over an external T-tube traversing the hepaticojejunostomy to ensure decompression.**\n- **Suture Material**: Silk is a braided, nonabsorbable suture. It incites a significant inflammatory reaction and its braided nature promotes infection. As a permanent material, it is a nidus for stones.\n- **Technique**: The use of an external T-tube is explicitly discouraged (\"generally avoided in hepaticojejunostomy\") in the problem statement's principles. T-tubes are associated with their own set of significant complications.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Both the suture material and the use of an external T-tube are contrary to the best practices outlined in the problem.\n\n**E. Poliglecaprone $25$ (Monocryl), monofilament absorbable, USP $6\\text{-}0$, interrupted mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis without stenting to minimize foreign body presence.**\n- **Suture Material**: Poliglecaprone $25$ is a monofilament absorbable suture, and USP $6\\text{-}0$ is an excellent size. However, its crucial flaw is its rapid loss of tensile strength, becoming unreliable within $1$ to $2$ weeks. This is too short to support the anastomosis through the critical $3$ to $6$ week healing phase, creating a high risk of bile leak.\n- **Technique**: The technique is generally good (interrupted, mucosa-to-mucosa). However, forgoing a stent in this high-risk scenario (small $r \\approx 3\\,\\text{mm}$ duct, inflamed, post-injury reconstruction) is a questionable judgment, especially when the principles explicitly suggest considering one. The primary failure of this option, however, remains the inadequate duration of suture support.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The choice of suture material provides inadequate mechanical support for the required healing duration, which is a critical failure.",

It is a valid, well-posed problem in applied mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to derive an expression for the maximum allowable inter-suture spacing, $s_{\\max}$, based on the provided principles and model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the mechanical equilibrium of the composite anastomotic ring under an internal pressure $P$. According to Principle (i), the total hoop force per unit axial length, $F'_{\\text{total}}$, required to balance the pressure load is given by Laplace's law for a thin cylinder:\n$$F'_{\\text{total}} = P r$$\nThis total force is distributed between the two layers of the anastomosis: the bile duct and the jejunum.\n$$F'_{\\text{total}} = F'_{\\mathrm{duct}} + F'_{\\mathrm{jej}}$$\nwhere $F'_{\\mathrm{duct}}$ and $F'_{\\mathrm{jej}}$ are the hoop forces per unit axial length carried by the duct and jejunal walls, respectively.\n\nNext, we relate these forces to the material properties and strain using Principle (ii), Hooke's Law. The circumferential stress, $\\sigma_\\theta$, in each layer is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{duct}} = E_{\\mathrm{duct}} \\epsilon_\\theta$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{jej}} = E_{\\mathrm{jej}} \\epsilon_\\theta$$\nThe problem states that both layers are constrained to have the same circumferential strain, $\\epsilon_\\theta$.\n\nThe force per unit axial length in each layer is the stress in that layer multiplied by its thickness (which is its cross-sectional area per unit axial length):\n$$F'_{\\mathrm{duct}} = \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} = (E_{\\mathrm{duct}} \\epsilon_\\theta) t_{\\mathrm{duct}}$$\n$$F'_{\\mathrm{jej}} = \\sigma_{\\theta, \\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}} = (E_{\\mathrm{jej}} \\epsilon_\\theta) t_{\\mathrm{jej}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the force balance equation:\n$$P r = (E_{\\mathrm{duct}} \\epsilon_\\theta) t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + (E_{\\mathrm{jej}} \\epsilon_\\theta) t_{\\mathrm{jej}}$$\nWe can factor out the common strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$:\n$$P r = \\epsilon_\\theta (E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}})$$\nSolving for the circumferential strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ of the composite ring gives:\n$$\\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{P r}{E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}}}$$\nThe term $(E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}})$ represents the total circumferential stiffness per unit length of the anastomotic wall.\n\nThe final step is to relate the strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ to the inter-suture spacing $s$ and the average edge separation $\\delta$. Circumferential strain is defined as the change in circumferential length per unit original length. Consider an arc segment of the anastomosis between two adjacent sutures, with an initial length $s$. Under pressure, this arc segment elongates by an amount $\\Delta s$. The strain is $\\epsilon_\\theta = \\Delta s / s$. The problem statement defines the \"average edge separation\" $\\delta$ as this elongation. This is a direct interpretation based on the given principles, where the total stretch of the tissue between the suture points manifests as a gap.\n$$\\delta = \\Delta s = s \\epsilon_\\theta$$\nWe are looking for the maximum suture spacing, $s_{\\max}$, that corresponds to the maximum tolerable separation, $\\delta_{\\max}$.\n$$\\delta_{\\max} = s_{\\max} \\epsilon_\\theta$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\epsilon_\\theta$:\n$$\\delta_{\\max} = s_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{P r}{E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}}} \\right)$$\nSolving for $s_{\\max}$, we obtain the desired symbolic expression:\n$$s_{\\max} = \\delta_{\\max} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}}}{P r}$$\n\nNow we evaluate $s_{\\max}$ numerically. To ensure consistency, we will use a coherent set of units: Newtons ($N$), millimeters ($mm$), and Megapascals ($MPa$). Note that $1 \\text{ MPa} = 1 \\text{ N/mm}^2$ and $1 \\text{ kPa} = 10^{-3} \\text{ MPa}$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $\\delta_{\\max} = 0.050 \\text{ mm}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{duct}} = 0.30 \\text{ MPa} = 0.30 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{duct}} = 0.70 \\text{ mm}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{jej}} = 0.20 \\text{ MPa} = 0.20 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{jej}} = 2.00 \\text{ mm}$\n- $P = 2.50 \\text{ kPa} = 0.00250 \\text{ MPa} = 0.00250 \\text{ N/mm}^2$\n- $r = 3.00 \\text{ mm}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term, which is the composite circumferential stiffness:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{duct}} t_{\\mathrm{duct}} + E_{\\mathrm{jej}} t_{\\mathrm{jej}} = (0.30 \\text{ N/mm}^2)(0.70 \\text{ mm}) + (0.20 \\text{ N/mm}^2)(2.00 \\text{ mm})$$\n$$= 0.21 \\text{ N/mm} + 0.40 \\text{ N/mm} = 0.61 \\text{ N/mm}$$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator term, which is the hoop force per unit length:\n$$P r = (0.00250 \\text{ N/mm}^2)(3.00 \\text{ mm}) = 0.0075 \\text{ N/mm}$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $s_{\\max}$:\n$$s_{\\max} = (0.050 \\text{ mm}) \\frac{0.61 \\text{ N/mm}}{0.0075 \\text{ N/mm}}$$\n$$s_{\\max} = (0.050 \\text{ mm}) \\times \\frac{0.61}{0.0075} = 0.050 \\times \\frac{6100}{75} = 0.050 \\times \\frac{244}{3}$$\n$$s_{\\max} = \\frac{12.2}{3} \\text{ mm} \\approx 4.0666... \\text{ mm}$$\n\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get:\n$$s_{\\max} \\approx 4.07 \\text{ mm}$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the minimum semi-major axis, denoted as $a$, of an elliptical anastomotic aperture that simultaneously satisfies three specified constraints: a minimum area, a maximum pressure drop, and a maximum average wall shear stress. The semi-minor axis $b$ is fixed. We will analyze each constraint to determine the permissible range for $a$ and then find the smallest value of $a$ that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe given parameters are:\nSemi-minor axis: $b = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\nEffective length: $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\nBile viscosity: $\\mu = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\nRequired flow rate: $Q_{\\mathrm{req}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/s}$\nMaximum pressure drop: $\\Delta p_{\\max} = 500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\nMaximum average wall shear stress: $\\tau_{\\max} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\nMinimum contact area: $A_{\\min} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}}$\n\nLet's analyze each constraint separately to establish a lower bound on the semi-major axis $a$.\n\n**Constraint 1: Minimum Area**\nThe area $A$ of the elliptical aperture is given by $A = \\pi a b$. The constraint is that this area must be at least the minimum required healing area $A_{\\min}$.\n$$\n\\pi a b \\ge A_{\\min}\n$$\nSolving for $a$, we find the first lower bound, $a_1$:\n$$\na \\ge \\frac{A_{\\min}}{\\pi b} = a_1\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\na_1 = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}}}{\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.183 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThus, the area constraint requires $a \\ge 3.183 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Maximum Pressure Drop**\nThe relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$ and pressure drop $\\Delta p$ for the given geometry is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi a^{3} b^{3}}{4 \\mu L (a^{2} + b^{2})} \\Delta p\n$$\nFor the required flow rate $Q_{\\mathrm{req}}$, the pressure drop must not exceed $\\Delta p_{\\max}$. Rearranging for $\\Delta p$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{4 \\mu L (a^{2} + b^{2})}{\\pi a^{3} b^{3}} Q_{\\mathrm{req}} \\le \\Delta p_{\\max}\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten in terms of $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^3} \\le \\frac{\\pi b^3 \\Delta p_{\\max}}{4 \\mu L Q_{\\mathrm{req}}}\n$$\nLet's define a constant $K_p$ for the right-hand side:\n$$\nK_p = \\frac{\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})^3 (500)}{4 (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-8})} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} = \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-6}}{7.2 \\times 10^{-14}}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} \\approx 1.745 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}\n$$\nThe function on the left, $f(a) = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{b^2}{a^3}$, is a strictly decreasing function for $a > 0$ because its derivative $f'(a) = -\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{3b^2}{a^4}$ is always negative. Therefore, the inequality $f(a) \\le K_p$ holds for $a \\ge a_2$, where $a_2$ is the solution to $f(a_2) = K_p$.\n$$\n\\frac{a_2^2 + b^2}{a_2^3} = K_p \\implies K_p a_2^3 - a_2^2 - b^2 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $b = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and the value of $K_p$:\n$$\n(1.745 \\times 10^8) a_2^3 - a_2^2 - (4.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0\n$$\nThis cubic equation can be solved for its positive real root $a_2$. Given the large coefficient of the $a^3$ term, we expect $a_2$ to be small. Assuming $a_2 \\ll b$, the equation approximates to $K_p a_2^3 \\approx b^2$, which gives $a_2^3 \\approx \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.745 \\times 10^8} \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$, leading to $a_2 \\approx 2.84 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. A more precise numerical solution confirms this approximation. Let's take $a_2 \\approx 2.84 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The pressure constraint requires $a \\ge 2.84 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Constraint 3: Maximum Average Wall Shear Stress**\nThe average wall shear stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta p D_{h}}{4 L} \\le \\tau_{\\max}\n$$\nwhere the hydraulic diameter is $D_h = \\frac{4A}{P} = \\frac{4\\pi a b}{P}$. We substitute the expression for $\\Delta p$ from the pressure drop constraint:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\left( \\frac{4 \\mu L (a^{2} + b^{2})}{\\pi a^{3} b^{3}} Q_{\\mathrm{req}} \\right) \\frac{4\\pi a b}{4LP} = \\frac{4 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{req}} (a^2+b^2)}{a^2 b^2 P} \\le \\tau_{\\max}\n$$\nThe perimeter $P$ is approximated by Ramanujan's formula: $P \\approx \\pi [ 3(a+b) - \\sqrt{(3a+b)(a+3b)} ]$.\nRearranging the inequality for $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2 P(a)} \\le \\frac{b^2 \\tau_{\\max}}{4 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{req}}}\n$$\nLet's define the constant $K_s$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nK_s = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2 (3.0)}{4 (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-8})} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-5}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-11}} \\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}} = 2.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}\n$$\nThe function on the left, $h(a) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2 P(a)}$, is a strictly decreasing function of $a$ for $a>0$. Thus, the inequality holds for $a \\ge a_3$, where $a_3$ is the solution to $h(a_3) = K_s$.\nThis transcendental equation must be solved numerically. By testing values, we find that the root $a_3$ is significantly smaller than $b$. Numerical iteration reveals that $a_3 \\approx 4.45 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The shear stress constraint requires $a \\ge 4.45 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTo satisfy all three constraints simultaneously, the semi-major axis $a$ must be greater than or equal to the lower bounds derived from each constraint:\n1.  Area constraint: $a \\ge a_1 \\approx 3.183 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n2.  Pressure drop constraint: $a \\ge a_2 \\approx 2.84 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n3.  Shear stress constraint: $a \\ge a_3 \\approx 4.45 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe minimal value for $a$ that satisfies all three conditions is the maximum of these lower bounds:\n$$\na_{\\min} = \\max(a_1, a_2, a_3) = \\max(3.183 \\times 10^{-3}, 2.84 \\times 10^{-5}, 4.45 \\times 10^{-5})\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\na_{\\min} = 3.183 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe limiting factor is the minimum area requirement. The problem asks for the answer in millimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\na_{\\min} = 3.183\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $3.18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.",
