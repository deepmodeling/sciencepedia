Based on personal and family history modeled by a validated clinical risk tool, the pre-test probability that the patient has Lynch syndrome (LS) is $0.25$. Tumor Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins is performed, and the report shows intact staining for all MMR proteins, which the laboratory interprets as a test negative for LS-associated loss-of-expression. For this IHC assay, the sensitivity for detecting LS-associated loss-of-expression is $0.95$, and the specificity for correctly identifying non-LS tumors as intact is $0.90$.

It provides all necessary data for a standard application of Bayes' theorem in a clinically realistic scenario. The provided values for pre-test probability, sensitivity, and specificity are plausible within the context of medical diagnostics for hereditary cancer syndromes. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $LS$ denote the event that the patient has Lynch syndrome.\nLet $LS^c$ denote the event that the patient does not have Lynch syndrome.\nLet $T-$ denote the event of a negative test result (i.e., intact staining for all MMR proteins on IHC).\nLet $T+$ denote the event of a positive test result (i.e., loss of MMR protein expression on IHC).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pre-test probability of Lynch syndrome is $P(LS) = 0.25$.\nThe probability of not having Lynch syndrome is therefore $P(LS^c) = 1 - P(LS) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test for detecting LS-associated loss-of-expression is given. Sensitivity is defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the condition is present.\n$P(T+ | LS) = 0.95$.\n\nThe specificity of the test is also given. Specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test result given that the condition is absent.\n$P(T- | LS^c) = 0.90$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the posterior probability that the patient has Lynch syndrome given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(LS | T-)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:\n$$P(LS | T-) = \\frac{P(T- | LS) \\cdot P(LS)}{P(T-)}$$\n\nFirst, we need to determine the terms in this equation.\nThe term $P(LS)$ is given as $0.25$.\n\nThe term $P(T- | LS)$ is the probability of a negative test given that the patient has Lynch syndrome. This is the complement of the sensitivity, also known as the false negative rate.\n$$P(T- | LS) = 1 - P(T+ | LS) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe term $P(T-)$ is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive scenarios (the patient has LS or does not have LS):\n$$P(T-) = P(T- | LS) \\cdot P(LS) + P(T- | LS^c) \\cdot P(LS^c)$$\n\nWe have all the necessary values to compute $P(T-)$:\n$P(T- | LS) = 0.05$\n$P(LS) = 0.25$\n$P(T- | LS^c) = 0.90$\n$P(LS^c) = 0.75$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $P(T-)$:\n$$P(T-) = (0.05)(0.25) + (0.90)(0.75)$$\n$$P(T-) = 0.0125 + 0.675$$\n$$P(T-) = 0.6875$$\n\nNow we have all the components to substitute into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(LS | T-) = \\frac{P(T- | LS) \\cdot P(LS)}{P(T-)}$$\n$$P(LS | T-) = \\frac{(0.05)(0.25)}{0.6875}$$\n$$P(LS | T-) = \\frac{0.0125}{0.6875}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(LS | T-) \\approx 0.01818181...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is in the hundredths place, so we count four digits starting from there.\n$$P(LS | T-) \\approx 0.01818$$\n\nThus, the posterior probability that the patient has Lynch syndrome, given the negative IHC test result, is approximately $0.01818$.",

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that requires the calculation of a posterior probability using Bayes' theorem. The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient age: $62$ years\n- Clinical presentation: Resected colon adenocarcinoma with universal tumor testing.\n- Test result $1$ (IHC): Concurrent loss of MutL homolog $1$ (MLH$1$) and postmeiotic segregation increased $2$ (PMS$2$). Let this event be $E_1$.\n- Test result $2$ (PCR): Microsatellite instability (MSI-high). Let this event be $E_2$.\n- Test result $3$ (Sequencing): B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) V$600$E mutation detected. Let this event be $E_3$.\n- Pretest probability of Lynch syndrome: $P(L) = 0.03$.\n- Pretest probability of sporadic colorectal cancer: $P(S) = 0.97$.\n- Assumption: The three tumor test results ($E_1, E_2, E_3$) are conditionally independent given the true state (sporadic versus Lynch syndrome).\n- Likelihood ratio for $E_1$ (MLH$1$/PMS$2$ loss) in favor of sporadic: $LR_1 = \\frac{P(E_1|S)}{P(E_1|L)} = 1.3$.\n- Likelihood ratio for $E_2$ (MSI-high) in favor of sporadic: $LR_2 = \\frac{P(E_2|S)}{P(E_2|L)} = 0.2$.\n- Likelihood ratio for $E_3$ (BRAF V$600$E detected) in favor of sporadic: $LR_3 = \\frac{P(E_3|S)}{P(E_3|L)} = 50$.\n- Objective: Compute the posterior probability that the cancer is sporadic, $P(S | E_1, E_2, E_3)$, and round to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of medical genetics and oncology. The diagnostic pathway described (IHC for mismatch repair proteins, MSI testing, and BRAF mutation analysis) is the standard of care for identifying Lynch syndrome in patients with colorectal cancer. The given likelihood ratios are clinically realistic; for instance, the BRAF V$600$E mutation is strongly associated with sporadic MSI-high cancers but is exceptionally rare in Lynch syndrome, justifying the high likelihood ratio.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data—prior probabilities, likelihood ratios for all pieces of evidence, and the crucial assumption of conditional independence—to calculate a unique posterior probability. The objective is clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Consistency Check**: The prior probabilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: $P(S) + P(L) = 0.97 + 0.03 = 1.00$. All conditions for a valid probabilistic inference problem are met.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a solution. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the use of Bayes' theorem in odds form. The relationship between posterior odds, prior odds, and the likelihood ratio is given by:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\nThe goal is to calculate the posterior probability of the cancer being sporadic, which we denote as $P(S | E)$, where $E$ represents the combined evidence from all three tests, $E = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3$. The odds are calculated in favor of the 'sporadic' state ($S$) versus the 'Lynch syndrome' state ($L$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds in favor of the cancer being sporadic.\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds}(S) = \\frac{P(S)}{P(L)} = \\frac{0.97}{0.03} $$\n\nNext, we determine the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence $E$. The problem states that the test results are conditionally independent given the true state. This allows us to find the combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{total}}$, by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{P(E|S)}{P(E|L)} = \\frac{P(E_1|S)P(E_2|S)P(E_3|S)}{P(E_1|L)P(E_2|L)P(E_3|L)} $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\left(\\frac{P(E_1|S)}{P(E_1|L)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_2|S)}{P(E_2|L)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_3|S)}{P(E_3|L)}\\right) $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = LR_1 \\times LR_2 \\times LR_3 $$\nSubstituting the given values for the likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 1.3 \\times 0.2 \\times 50 $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 1.3 \\times 10 = 13 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds in favor of the sporadic state:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\text{Prior Odds}(S) \\times LR_{\\text{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\left(\\frac{0.97}{0.03}\\right) \\times 13 $$\nTo maintain precision, we work with fractions:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E) = \\frac{97}{3} \\times 13 = \\frac{1261}{3} $$\n\nThe final step is to convert the posterior odds back into a probability. If the odds in favor of an event $A$ are $O(A)$, the probability of $A$ is given by:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{O(A)}{1 + O(A)} $$\nApplying this to our posterior odds for the sporadic state:\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E)}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}(S | E)} $$\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{1 + \\frac{1261}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{\\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{1261}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1261}{3}}{\\frac{1264}{3}} $$\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{1261}{1264} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$ P(S | E) = \\frac{1261}{1264} \\approx 0.997626582... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.9976$.\nThe result indicates that despite the initial findings suggestive of Lynch syndrome (MSI-high and MLH1/PMS2 loss), the presence of the BRAF V$600$E mutation provides such strong evidence for a sporadic etiology that the posterior probability of the cancer being sporadic is extremely high.",
