In this tertiary surgical cohort, the pretest prevalence of complicated diverticulitis is $0.30$. At the chosen CRP threshold, the diagnostic sensitivity is $0.80$ and the specificity is $0.70$. Use Bayes’ theorem, together with the core definitions of sensitivity and specificity and the law of total probability, to derive from first principles the post-test probability of complicated diverticulitis given a positive CRP (above threshold).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information to calculate the post-test probability using established principles of probability theory. The provided values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are clinically plausible for the described context.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of complicated diverticulitis given a positive C-reactive protein (CRP) test result. We will derive this from first principles using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and translate the given information into probabilistic notation.\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has complicated diverticulitis.\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have complicated diverticulitis.\nLet $T+$ be the event that the CRP test is positive (i.e., the value is above the predefined threshold).\nLet $T-$ be the event that the CRP test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following probabilities:\nThe pretest prevalence of complicated diverticulitis is the prior probability of the disease, $P(D)$.\n$$P(D) = 0.30$$\nThe probability that a patient does not have complicated diverticulitis is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease.\n$$P(T+ | D) = 0.80$$\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease.\n$$P(T- | D^c) = 0.70$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of complicated diverticulitis given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T+)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:\n$$P(D | T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be found by rearranging the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity:\n$$P(T+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(D)}$$\n$$P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+ | D) \\times P(D)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D \\cap T+) = 0.80 \\times 0.30 = 0.24$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive).\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D) + P(T+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ | D)P(D) + P(T+ | D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(T+ | D)P(D) = 0.24$. For the second term, we need $P(T+ | D^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity. Since a person without the disease can either test negative (specificity) or positive, these two probabilities must sum to $1$.\n$$P(T+ | D^c) + P(T- | D^c) = 1$$\n$$P(T+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T- | D^c) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T+) = (0.80 \\times 0.30) + (0.30 \\times 0.70)$$\n$$P(T+) = 0.24 + 0.21 = 0.45$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values for the numerator and the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the desired post-test probability, $P(D | T+)$:\n$$P(D | T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{0.24}{0.45}$$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$P(D | T+) = \\frac{24}{45} = \\frac{8}{15} \\approx 0.533333...$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D | T+) \\approx 0.5333$$\nThis is the post-test probability of complicated diverticulitis for a patient in this cohort with a CRP level above the specified threshold.",

While guidelines like the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend an initial fluid bolus, a one-size-fits-all approach can be suboptimal or even harmful.

            "problem": "A $62$-year-old patient presents with perforated sigmoid diverticulitis causing generalized purulent peritonitis (Hinchey class III) and septic shock. The patient is intubated, on controlled mechanical ventilation in sinus rhythm with a tidal volume of $8\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ of predicted body weight, and shows a pulse pressure variation (PPV) of $0.18$ under these conditions. Point-of-care transthoracic echocardiography reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of $0.30$. The patient’s mass is $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe explicit data and definitions provided in the problem statement are:\n- Patient age: $62$ years\n- Diagnosis: Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis, generalized purulent peritonitis (Hinchey class III), septic shock\n- Ventilatory status: Intubated, on controlled mechanical ventilation\n- Cardiac rhythm: Sinus rhythm\n- Tidal volume ($V_T$): $8\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ of predicted body weight\n- Pulse pressure variation (PPV): $0.18$\n- Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): $0.30$\n- Patient mass ($m$): $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Mean arterial pressure (MAP): $55\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Serum lactate: $4.2\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n- Initial fluid resuscitation recommendation: $30\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$\n- Reference LVEF ($\\mathrm{LVEF}_{\\mathrm{ref}}$): $0.60$\n- PPV threshold ($\\mathrm{PPV}_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$): $0.13$\n- Definition of base volume: $V_{0} = (30\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}) \\times m$\n- Definition of composite adjustment coefficient: $C = \\min\\big(\\frac{\\mathrm{LVEF}}{0.60},\\,1\\big) \\times \\min\\big(\\frac{\\mathrm{PPV}}{0.13},\\,1\\big)$\n- Definition of adjusted volume: $V_{\\mathrm{adj}} = V_{0}\\,C$\n- Required output: $V_{\\mathrm{adj}}$ in $\\mathrm{mL}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is subjected to rigorous validation against the specified criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of critical care medicine and physiology. Septic shock, fluid resuscitation, the Frank-Starling relationship, and dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness like PPV are all standard, well-validated concepts. The LVEF is a primary measure of cardiac systolic function. The specific values provided for clinical parameters (MAP, lactate, LVEF, PPV) are realistic for a patient in severe septic shock with underlying septic cardiomyopathy. The adjustment model, while a simplification, is physiologically coherent: it reduces the fluid bolus for poor cardiac function (low LVEF) while confirming that the patient is in a preload-responsive state (high PPV). The model does not violate any fundamental scientific laws.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical values and a precise, unambiguous formula for the calculation. A unique solution exists and can be determined through direct computation.\n- **Objective**: The language is objective and quantitative. It describes a clinical scenario using standard medical terminology and provides specific numerical data for calculation. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All data required to perform the calculations are provided. There are no internal contradictions. The provided context (controlled ventilation, sinus rhythm) is crucial as it establishes the validity conditions for interpreting the given PPV value.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is clinically realistic and represents a common, challenging problem in general surgery and intensive care. The proposed quantitative adjustment is a formalization of the clinical reasoning process, where a clinician would balance the need for volume (indicated by shock and high PPV) against the risk of volume overload (suggested by low LVEF).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution will now be derived as requested.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as specified by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Computation of the Base Volume ($V_{0}$)**\n\nThe base volume, $V_{0}$, is determined by the standard initial fluid resuscitation guideline for septic shock, which is given as $30\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ of crystalloid per kilogram of body mass. The patient's mass, $m$, is given as $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\n$$V_{0} = (30\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}) \\times m$$\nSubstituting the patient's mass:\n$$V_{0} = 30\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 70\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 2100\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**2. Computation of the Composite Adjustment Coefficient ($C$)**\n\nThe composite adjustment coefficient, $C$, is defined as the product of two normalized factors, one for cardiac reserve (based on LVEF) and one for fluid responsiveness (based on PPV). The formula is given as:\n\n$$C = \\min\\big(\\frac{\\mathrm{LVEF}}{\\mathrm{LVEF}_{\\mathrm{ref}}},\\,1\\big) \\times \\min\\big(\\frac{\\mathrm{PPV}}{\\mathrm{PPV}_{\\mathrm{thresh}}},\\,1\\big)$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Patient's LVEF $= 0.30$\n- Reference LVEF ($\\mathrm{LVEF}_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) $= 0.60$\n- Patient's PPV $= 0.18$\n- PPV threshold ($\\mathrm{PPV}_{\\mathrm{thresh}}$) $= 0.13$\n\nFirst, we compute the LVEF-based factor, which we can denote $C_{\\mathrm{LVEF}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{LVEF}} = \\min\\big(\\frac{0.30}{0.60},\\,1\\big) = \\min(0.5,\\,1) = 0.5$$\nThis factor adjusts the fluid volume downwards due to the patient's significantly reduced cardiac systolic function (an LVEF of $0.30$ is only $50\\%$ of the reference normal LVEF of $0.60$).\n\nNext, we compute the PPV-based factor, which we can denote $C_{\\mathrm{PPV}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{PPV}} = \\min\\big(\\frac{0.18}{0.13},\\,1\\big)$$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{0.18}{0.13} \\approx 1.3846$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{PPV}} = \\min(1.3846...,\\,1) = 1$$\nThis factor indicates that the patient is highly likely to be fluid-responsive, as their PPV of $0.18$ is well above the threshold of $0.13$. The model truncates the effect at $1$, meaning that evidence of fluid responsiveness does not warrant an *increase* in the baseline volume but rather serves as a condition permissive of giving volume.\n\nNow, we compute the composite coefficient $C$ by multiplying the two factors:\n$$C = C_{\\mathrm{LVEF}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{PPV}} = 0.5 \\times 1 = 0.5$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Adjusted Recommended Volume ($V_{\\mathrm{adj}}$)**\n\nThe adjusted recommended initial bolus volume, $V_{\\mathrm{adj}}$, is the product of the base volume $V_{0}$ and the composite adjustment coefficient $C$.\n\n$$V_{\\mathrm{adj}} = V_{0} \\times C$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $V_{0}$ and $C$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{adj}} = 2100\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.5 = 1050\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $1050\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ can be written as $1.05 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, which already has exactly three significant figures ($1$, $0$, and $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe adjusted recommended initial bolus volume is $1050\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.",

A solution will be generated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for elective sigmoid resection to prevent one hospitalization for recurrent diverticulitis. This requires three sequential calculations:\n1.  The overall probability of hospitalization in the surgery arm ($p_{surg}$).\n2.  The absolute risk reduction (ARR) comparing surgery to non-operative management.\n3.  The NNT, which is the reciprocal of the ARR.\n\nLet $H$ be the event of hospitalization for recurrent diverticulitis within the $T=2$ year time horizon.\nLet $C$ denote the control group (non-operative management) and $S$ denote the surgery group (elective resection).\nThe risk in the control group is given as $P(H | C) = p_{0} = 0.30$.\n\nIn the surgery arm, a patient either survives the initial operative period or does not. Let $M$ be the event of operative mortality, and $M^{c}$ be the complementary event of surviving the operation.\nThe probabilities are given as:\n-   $P(M) = p_{m} = 0.015$\n-   $P(M^{c}) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - p_{m} = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985$\n\nThe problem states that death precludes subsequent hospitalization, which translates to a conditional probability of hospitalization given operative mortality of zero: $P(H | M) = 0$.\nThe probability of hospitalization, conditional on surviving the operation, is given as $P(H | M^{c}) = p_{1} = 0.06$.\n\nTo find the total probability of hospitalization in the surgery arm, $p_{surg} = P(H | S)$, we apply the law of total probability, partitioning the outcome based on operative survival ($M$ and $M^{c}$):\n$$p_{surg} = P(H | S) = P(H | M) P(M) + P(H | M^{c}) P(M^{c})$$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$p_{surg} = (0)(p_{m}) + (p_{1})(1 - p_{m}) = p_{1}(1 - p_{m})$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for $p_{surg}$:\n$$p_{surg} = 0.06 \\times (1 - 0.015) = 0.06 \\times 0.985 = 0.0591$$\nThis is the average risk of hospitalization for recurrence in the surgery arm.\n\nNext, we compute the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference between the risk in the control group ($p_{0}$) and the risk in the treatment group ($p_{surg}$):\n$$ARR = p_{0} - p_{surg}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ARR = 0.30 - 0.0591 = 0.2409$$\n\nFinally, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the value for ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.2409} \\approx 4.15110004151...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final NNT to be rounded to four significant figures.
