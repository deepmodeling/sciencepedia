            "introduction": "A deep understanding of achalasia management begins with its fundamental pathophysiology. This practice problem  uses a pharmacological thought experiment to bridge the gap between the molecular-level defect—the loss of inhibitory nitrergic neurons—and its clinical manifestation as impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. By analyzing the effect of blocking nitric oxide synthesis on the Integrated Relaxation Pressure ($IRP$), you will reinforce the causal link that underpins modern manometric diagnosis.",

            "problem": "A patient with suspected achalasia undergoes high-resolution manometry (HRM). In this HRM experiment, nitric oxide (NO) signaling is pharmacologically blocked by administering $N^{\\omega}$-nitro-$L$-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. After a standardized 5 mL water swallow, the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) rises from 12 mmHg to 28 mmHg.\n\nUsing the following foundational base:\n- Enteric inhibitory neurons in the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus release nitric oxide (NO), which mediates lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation during swallowing.\n- Achalasia physiology is characterized by selective degeneration of inhibitory nitrergic neurons, leading to impaired swallow-induced LES relaxation.\n- The IRP measured by HRM is a standardized metric of deglutitive EGJ relaxation, which increases when swallow-induced relaxation is inadequate.\n- LES tone reflects the net balance between excitatory cholinergic drive and inhibitory nitrergic drive. Let the net sphincter tone be $T$, with $T = E - I$, where $E$ is the excitatory component and $I$ is the inhibitory component attributable in part to NO.\n- IRP is a monotone increasing function of LES tone, denoted $IRP = f(T)$ with $\\frac{df}{dT} > 0$.\n\nFirst, justify the causal chain from NO deficiency to elevated IRP in terms of the above constructs, starting from these physiological principles without assuming any specialized or shortcut formulas. Then, compute the percent increase in IRP from the pre-blockade value of 12 mmHg to the post-blockade value of 28 mmHg. Express the percent increase as a decimal or a fraction without using a percent sign, and give your final answer as a single fraction in simplest terms.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of esophageal physiology and pharmacology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, precise language. All provided data and definitions are physically and clinically plausible.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, a justification of the causal chain from nitric oxide (NO) deficiency to elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). Second, the computation of the percent increase in IRP.\n\nPart 1: Justification of the Causal Chain\n\nThe problem provides a foundational model for the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone, $T$, as the net result of competing excitatory and inhibitory inputs:\n$$T = E - I$$\nHere, $E$ represents the tonic excitatory drive, primarily mediated by acetylcholine, which promotes sphincter contraction. $I$ represents the inhibitory drive, which mediates sphincter relaxation. The problem states that enteric inhibitory neurons release nitric oxide (NO) to mediate this relaxation. Therefore, the magnitude of the inhibitory component, $I$, is a direct function of NO signaling. A reduction in NO leads to a reduction in $I$.\n\nThe experiment involves administering $N^{\\omega}$-nitro-$L$-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for producing NO. By inhibiting NOS, L-NAME pharmacologically blocks the synthesis of NO.\n\nThis blockade has the following sequential effects:\n1.  A decrease in the production and availability of NO in the myenteric plexus at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ).\n2.  Since the inhibitory input $I$ is mediated by NO, a decrease in NO signaling leads to a decrease in the magnitude of $I$. Let the pre-blockade inhibitory input be $I_{pre}$ and the post-blockade input be $I_{post}$. The action of L-NAME ensures that $I_{post} < I_{pre}$.\n3.  The net sphincter tone, $T$, is then altered. Assuming the excitatory component $E$ remains constant during the experiment, the change in tone is solely due to the change in $I$.\n    -   Pre-blockade tone: $T_{pre} = E - I_{pre}$\n    -   Post-blockade tone: $T_{post} = E - I_{post}$\n    -   Since $I_{post} < I_{pre}$, it follows logically that $T_{post} > T_{pre}$. The net sphincter tone increases because the counteracting inhibitory force has been diminished.\n\n4.  The problem defines the relationship between IRP and LES tone as a monotone increasing function, $IRP = f(T)$, with the property $\\frac{df}{dT} > 0$. This mathematical property signifies that an increase in the input variable (tone, $T$) necessarily results in an increase in the output variable (IRP).\n\n5.  Combining these points, the increase in tone from $T_{pre}$ to $T_{post}$ causes a corresponding increase in the measured IRP. Thus, $f(T_{post}) > f(T_{pre})$, which means $IRP_{post} > IRP_{pre}$.\n\nThis causal chain, starting from the pharmacological inhibition of NO synthesis and flowing through the provided physiological model ($T=E-I$) and the defined mathematical relationship ($IRP=f(T)$), rigorously explains why a deficiency in NO signaling leads to an elevated IRP. This experiment effectively simulates the hallmark pathophysiology of achalasia, which is the natural degeneration of these same inhibitory nitrergic neurons.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Percent Increase in IRP\n\nThe percent increase is a measure of the relative change from an initial value to a final value. The problem asks for this value to be expressed as a fraction or decimal, not using a percent sign. This is equivalent to calculating the fractional increase.\n\nThe initial IRP is given as $IRP_{initial} = 12$ mmHg.\nThe final IRP after L-NAME administration is given as $IRP_{final} = 28$ mmHg.\n\nThe formula for fractional increase is:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{IRP_{final} - IRP_{initial}}{IRP_{initial}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{28 - 12}{12} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute increase in IRP:\n$$ \\Delta IRP = 28 - 12 = 16 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the fractional increase by dividing the absolute increase by the initial value:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{16}{12} $$\n\nTo express this fraction in its simplest terms, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator ($16$) and the denominator ($12$), which is $4$. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by $4$:\n$$ \\frac{16 \\div 4}{12 \\div 4} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\n\nThus, the fractional increase in IRP is $\\frac{4}{3}$.",

            "problem": "A patient with suspected achalasia undergoes high-resolution esophageal manometry (High-Resolution Manometry, HRM). For the assessment of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, the integrated relaxation pressure (Integrated Relaxation Pressure, IRP) is measured over ten standardized wet swallows, yielding values (in millimeters of mercury): $[32, 28, 30, 35, 29, 33, 31, 27, 34, 29]$ mmHg.

It provides all necessary data (the ten IRP values) and a precise set of instructions for calculation (compute the mean), comparison (check against a threshold), and encoding the result. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the arithmetic mean of the provided Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP) values. Let the set of $n=10$ measurements be denoted by $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{10}\\}$, where the values are:\n$$X = \\{32, 28, 30, 35, 29, 33, 31, 27, 34, 29\\}$$\n\nThe arithmetic mean, denoted as $\\overline{\\text{IRP}}$, is calculated using the formula provided:\n$$\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of the observations, $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = 32 + 28 + 30 + 35 + 29 + 33 + 31 + 27 + 34 + 29$$\nSumming these values yields:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = 308$$\n\nNext, we divide this sum by the number of observations, $n=10$:\n$$\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = \\frac{308}{10} = 30.8$$\nThe resulting mean IRP is $30.8$ mmHg. The problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $30.8$ already consists of three significant figures ($3$, $0$, and $8$), so no further rounding is necessary. The value for the first entry of the final answer is $30.8$.\n\nThe second task is to determine the exceedance indicator, $E$. This indicator is based on a comparison of the calculated mean IRP with the given upper limit of normal, which is $T = 15$ mmHg. The rule is:\n$$E = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\overline{\\text{IRP}} > 15 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\overline{\\text{IRP}} \\le 15 \\end{cases}$$\nWe compare our calculated mean, $\\overline{\\text{IRP}} = 30.8$, to the threshold $T = 15$:\n$$30.8 > 15$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the mean IRP exceeds the upper limit. According to the specified encoding, the exceedance indicator is $E=1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row matrix containing two entries: the rounded mean IRP and the exceedance indicator. The two entries are $30.8$ and $1$. The resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 30.8 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
