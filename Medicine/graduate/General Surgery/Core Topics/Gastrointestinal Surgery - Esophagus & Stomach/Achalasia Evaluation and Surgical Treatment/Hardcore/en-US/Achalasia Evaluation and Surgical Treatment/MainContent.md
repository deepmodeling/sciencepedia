## Introduction
Achalasia is a debilitating esophageal motility disorder that profoundly affects a patient's ability to eat, causing severe dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain. As a [neurodegenerative disease](@entry_id:169702) of the esophagus, its management demands more than just technical proficiency; it requires a deep, principled understanding that connects the microscopic loss of neurons to the macroscopic challenges of diagnosis and surgical correction. Simply identifying the condition is not enough; effective, long-lasting treatment hinges on the ability to interpret nuanced physiological data and apply biomechanical principles to restore esophageal transit. This article is structured to build this crucial expertise from the ground up.

First, in "Principles and Mechanisms," we will explore the core pathophysiology of achalasia, focusing on the selective neural destruction that defines the disease and how this translates into the classic findings on High-Resolution Manometry and other diagnostic tests. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will bridge this foundational knowledge to the operating room, detailing how an understanding of physics, pharmacology, and physiology informs the selection and execution of modern therapies like Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy and POEM. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide opportunities to apply these concepts through simulated clinical problems, solidifying your ability to evaluate and manage this complex condition.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles governing esophageal motility and the specific pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie achalasia. We will deconstruct the elegant neuromuscular coordination required for normal swallowing and explore how its disruption leads to the clinical and manometric patterns characteristic of achalasia and its related disorders. Understanding these core mechanisms is paramount for accurate diagnosis, appropriate subtyping, and rational selection of therapeutic interventions.

### The Neuromuscular Basis of Esophageal Function

The coordinated act of swallowing is a complex reflex governed by the central nervous system but executed with remarkable precision by the intrinsic neural circuitry of the esophagus itself: the **enteric nervous system (ENS)**. Embedded within the esophageal wall, the **myenteric plexus** (also known as Auerbach's plexus) acts as a local "brain," orchestrating the sequence of muscle contraction and relaxation necessary for bolus transit. This intricate process hinges on a delicate balance between two primary types of neurons.

First are the **cholinergic excitatory neurons**. These neurons release the neurotransmitter **acetylcholine (ACh)**, which acts on muscarinic receptors on esophageal smooth muscle cells, causing them to depolarize and contract. These neurons are responsible for maintaining the basal resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and for generating the propulsive, contractile phase of peristalsis that pushes the bolus toward the stomach.

Counterbalancing this excitatory input are the **nitrergic inhibitory neurons**. These neurons are the primary mediators of smooth muscle relaxation. They release [inhibitory neurotransmitters](@entry_id:194821), principally **nitric oxide (NO)**—synthesized by neuronal [nitric oxide synthase](@entry_id:204652) (nNOS)—and to a lesser extent, **vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)**. These substances cause smooth muscle cells to hyperpolarize, leading to relaxation. This inhibitory signaling is essential for two critical events during a swallow: the timely and complete relaxation of the LES to allow the bolus to pass into the stomach, and the wave of "deglutitive inhibition" that precedes the peristaltic contraction, ensuring the esophageal lumen is open ahead of the bolus.

Normal swallowing, therefore, is not simply a wave of contraction but a precisely orchestrated sequence: the swallow triggers a wave of nitrergic inhibition that travels down the esophagus, relaxing the LES, followed milliseconds later by a wave of cholinergic excitation that generates the peristaltic contraction.

### The Pathophysiological Hallmark of Achalasia: A Selective Loss of Inhibition

Primary achalasia is, at its core, a neurodegenerative disease. It is an idiopathic, and likely autoimmune-mediated, inflammatory process that results in the progressive and selective destruction of the inhibitory nitrergic neurons within the myenteric plexus, especially in the distal esophagus and LES. The excitatory cholinergic neurons are relatively spared.

This selective loss of inhibition has two profound consequences that define the disease:

1.  **Impaired LES Relaxation**: Without the crucial NO-mediated relaxation signal, the basal excitatory tone from cholinergic neurons becomes unopposed. The LES, therefore, remains in a state of tonic contraction, failing to relax adequately in response to a swallow. This creates a functional outflow obstruction at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ).

2.  **Aperistalsis**: The destruction of inhibitory neurons also obliterates the organized wave of deglutitive inhibition necessary to pattern a normal peristaltic contraction. Without this organizing influence, the esophageal body is incapable of generating a propagating contractile wave, a condition known as **aperistalsis**.

The histopathological signature of primary achalasia confirms this mechanism. On microscopic examination of the myenteric plexus, there is a marked reduction in the number of ganglion cells (hypoganglionosis) or even their complete absence (aganglionosis). Critically, immunohistochemical staining reveals a profound and disproportionate loss of nNOS-positive neurons. For instance, in a patient with primary achalasia, one might find a severely reduced ganglion cell density and observe that only a small fraction (e.g., $12\%$) of the remaining neurons are nNOS-positive. In contrast, in a patient with an achalasia-like motility pattern caused by a tumor (**pseudoachalasia**), the myenteric plexus architecture is often preserved, with normal ganglion cell density and a high proportion of nNOS-positive neurons, indicating the neuromuscular machinery is intact but functionally obstructed by an external cause.

### Manometric Manifestations: The Language of High-Resolution Manometry

High-Resolution Manometry (HRM) is the gold standard for diagnosing achalasia, as it provides a detailed spatiotemporal map of esophageal pressures. The diagnosis is built upon two pillars: demonstrating impaired EGJ relaxation and confirming the absence of normal peristalsis.

#### The Cardinal Sign: Esophagogastric Junction Outflow Obstruction

The hallmark of impaired EGJ relaxation is an elevated **Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP)**. The IRP is a metric that quantifies the average pressure of the EGJ during the 4 seconds of its most profound relaxation within a 10-second window following a swallow. An elevated IRP indicates a persistent pressure barrier at the EGJ.

The Chicago Classification version 4.0 (CCv4.0) protocol emphasizes the importance of performing swallows in both the supine and upright positions. This dual-position testing is crucial for diagnostic accuracy. In the supine position, factors such as compression by the crural diaphragm or angulation of the [manometry](@entry_id:137079) catheter can create an artifactual elevation of the IRP. The upright position mitigates these postural artifacts and introduces the force of gravity, which helps bolus transit. If the IRP remains elevated in both positions, it strongly suggests that the obstruction is due to a true, posture-independent pathophysiological barrier at the EGJ (i.e., impaired LES relaxation) rather than a measurement artifact. This significantly increases the specificity of the diagnosis of **esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO)**.

#### Classifying Achalasia Subtypes

Once a patient is determined to have EGJOO and 100% failed peristalsis, they are diagnosed with achalasia. The condition is then subtyped based on the motor pattern of the esophageal body during swallowing.

*   **Type I Achalasia (Classic Achalasia)**: This subtype is characterized by an elevated IRP and 100% failed [peristalsis](@entry_id:140959), with minimal or no contractile activity in the esophageal body. On HRM, this appears as an almost complete absence of pressurization in the esophagus following a swallow. The distal contractile integral (DCI), a measure of contractile vigor, is consistently low (e.g., $DCI \lt 100 \ \mathrm{mmHg \cdot s \cdot cm}$).

*   **Type II Achalasia**: This is the most common subtype and features an elevated IRP, 100% failed [peristalsis](@entry_id:140959), and **panesophageal pressurization** in at least 20% of swallows. This signature pattern of a simultaneous, uniform pressure rise throughout the esophagus is not a spastic contraction. Rather, it is a biophysical consequence of a closed chamber. The re-closed upper esophageal sphincter (UES) proximally and the non-relaxing EGJ distally trap the liquid bolus. The preserved contraction of the longitudinal esophageal muscle shortens the esophagus, decreasing the chamber's volume. Because the trapped bolus is an [incompressible fluid](@entry_id:262924), this volume reduction results in a sharp, uniform increase in pressure throughout the esophageal lumen, as dictated by Pascal's principle.

*   **Type III Achalasia (Spastic Achalasia)**: This subtype is defined by an elevated IRP, absent normal peristalsis, and the presence of premature (spastic) contractions in at least 20% of swallows. These are rapidly propagating, often high-amplitude contractions in the distal esophagus. Prematurity is defined by a short **Distal Latency (DL)**, which is the time from swallow initiation to the onset of the distal contraction. A $DL \lt 4.5$ seconds indicates a premature, spastic response.

### The Comprehensive Diagnostic Workup

While HRM is the definitive diagnostic tool, a comprehensive evaluation for achalasia involves a multimodal approach to confirm the diagnosis, exclude mimics, and assess the anatomy and severity of the disease.

#### Endoscopy: The First Look

Upper endoscopy is typically one of the first investigations. In primary achalasia, the findings are a direct consequence of stasis and functional obstruction. The endoscopist may observe a dilated, food-filled esophagus with retained, often frothy, saliva. The esophageal mucosa itself usually appears normal, though chronic stasis can sometimes lead to secondary inflammation (stasis esophagitis). At the EGJ, a tight, puckered sphincter is encountered. A key diagnostic sign is that in most cases of primary achalasia, the endoscope can be advanced into the stomach with gentle, sustained pressure, often accompanied by a characteristic tactile "pop" as the muscular resistance is overcome. This finding reflects a functional, non-fibrotic obstruction.

#### Timed Barium Esophagram (TBE): Quantifying Stasis

The TBE is a crucial functional and anatomical study. A standardized protocol involves the patient standing upright and rapidly ingesting a large volume (e.g., 200–250 mL) of low-density barium. Radiographs are taken at 1, 2, and 5 minutes post-ingestion. The TBE provides several key pieces of information:
*   **Esophageal emptying**: The height of the retained barium column is measured at each time point. A column height greater than 5 cm at 5 minutes is considered abnormal and indicates significant stasis.
*   **Esophageal anatomy**: The degree of esophageal dilation can be assessed.
*   **EGJ morphology**: The classic radiographic finding is a smooth, tapered narrowing at the EGJ, famously described as a **"bird's beak"** appearance.
The TBE is valuable not only for initial diagnosis but also for objectively assessing the success of treatment by measuring the improvement in esophageal emptying post-intervention.

### Distinguishing True from False: Critical Differential Diagnoses

A manometric pattern of achalasia does not always signify the primary, idiopathic disease. It is imperative to differentiate primary achalasia from its mimics.

#### Pseudoachalasia

**Pseudoachalasia** is a term for conditions that mimic the manometric findings of achalasia (impaired LES relaxation and aperistalsis) but are caused by a secondary process, most often a malignancy at or near the EGJ. Distinguishing pseudoachalasia from primary achalasia is a critical task, guided by several "red flag" features:
*   **Demographics**: Pseudoachalasia typically occurs in an older demographic (e.g., age > 60 years), whereas primary achalasia often presents in younger or middle-aged adults.
*   **Clinical History**: The onset of symptoms in pseudoachalasia is often rapid (weeks to months) and associated with significant, unintentional weight loss. Primary achalasia usually has an insidious onset over years.
*   **Endoscopic Findings**: Malignancy often creates a nodular, irregular, ulcerated, and firm stricture that is difficult or impossible to traverse with the endoscope. This contrasts with the smooth, concentric, and often traversable EGJ of primary achalasia.
*   **Response to Treatment**: Mechanical treatments like pneumatic dilation provide poor or only transient relief in pseudoachalasia because the obstruction is due to a rigid tumor mass, not just [hypertonic](@entry_id:145393) muscle.

#### Esophagogastric Junction Outflow Obstruction (EGJOO)

A crucial diagnosis to distinguish from achalasia is idiopathic EGJOO. This manometric diagnosis is made when a patient has an elevated IRP (impaired EGJ relaxation) but **preserved [peristalsis](@entry_id:140959)**. By definition, this is *not* achalasia. While it can be an early form of achalasia or a standalone functional disorder, the finding of EGJOO mandates a thorough investigation to rule out a mechanical cause. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes subtle peptic strictures, eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki rings, hiatal hernias, and extrinsic compression. A careful repeat endoscopy with biopsies, a TBE with a solid bolus (e.g., a 13 mm barium tablet), and sometimes endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are required to exclude these structural causes before a diagnosis of idiopathic EGJOO can be made and treatment considered.

### Clinical Consequences: The Burden of Impaired Clearance

The clinical presentation of achalasia stems directly from the failure of esophageal emptying. Patients experience dysphagia to both solids and liquids, regurgitation of undigested food, and substernal chest pain. One of the most dangerous complications is **nocturnal aspiration**.

During the day, an upright posture provides a [gravitational assist](@entry_id:176821), helping to keep the retained esophageal contents away from the UES. However, when a patient lies supine to sleep, this gravitational benefit is lost. Furthermore, the natural frequency of swallowing decreases dramatically during sleep, virtually eliminating any active clearance mechanism. The esophagus becomes a static, fluid-filled reservoir. During transient UES relaxations, which occur normally during sleep, the retained non-acidic food and saliva can easily overflow into the pharynx and be aspirated into the tracheobronchial tree. This explains the common symptoms of nocturnal cough, choking, and the high risk of recurrent pneumonia in patients with untreated achalasia.
