While a patient's surgical history is often revealing, confirming functional asplenia relies on specific diagnostic markers.

            "problem": "A general surgery service is evaluating a screening strategy to mitigate the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) by identifying patients with functional asplenia. Howell–Jolly bodies (HJB) on peripheral blood smear are used as the index test, and a composite gold standard for asplenia combines radionuclide spleen scintigraphy and validated immunologic markers. In a prospective cohort of $200$ adult patients who had undergone splenectomy or splenic embolization within the past $12$ months, the following $2\\times 2$ classification counts were obtained:\n\n- HJB positive and gold-standard asplenia positive: $72$.\n- HJB negative and gold-standard asplenia positive: $8$.\n- HJB positive and gold-standard asplenia negative: $18$.\n- HJB negative and gold-standard asplenia negative: $102$.\n\nUsing foundational definitions from diagnostic test evaluation and conditional probability, calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of HJB for detecting asplenia in this cohort. Express each result as a decimal (not a percentage), and round each to $4$ significant figures. Report your final four values in the order: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of four key performance metrics for a diagnostic test: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, provides a complete and consistent set of data, and is well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework for analyzing the diagnostic test data. Let $D+$ denote the presence of the condition (gold-standard confirmed asplenia) and $D-$ denote its absence. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result (Howell-Jolly bodies, HJB, are present) and $T-$ denote a negative test result (HJB are absent).\n\nThe data provided can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, which cross-classifies the test results against the true disease status according to the gold standard. The four cells of this table are defined as follows:\n-   **True Positives ($TP$)**: Individuals who have the condition and test positive.\n-   **False Negatives ($FN$)**: Individuals who have the condition but test negative.\n-   **False Positives ($FP$)**: Individuals who do not have the condition but test positive.\n-   **True Negatives ($TN$)**: Individuals who do not have the condition and test negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following counts for a cohort of $N=200$ patients:\n-   $TP$ (HJB positive, asplenia positive): $72$\n-   $FN$ (HJB negative, asplenia positive): $8$\n-   $FP$ (HJB positive, asplenia negative): $18$\n-   $TN$ (HJB negative, asplenia negative): $102$\n\nWe can construct the contingency table and calculate the marginal totals:\n\n| Test Result | Disease Present ($D+$) | Disease Absent ($D-$) | Row Total |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Test Positive ($T+$)** | $TP = 72$ | $FP = 18$ | $TP+FP = 90$ |\n| **Test Negative ($T-$)** | $FN = 8$ | $TN = 102$ | $FN+TN = 110$ |\n| **Column Total** | $TP+FN = 80$ | $FP+TN = 120$ | $N = 200$ |\n\nThe total number of patients with asplenia ($D+$) is $TP + FN = 72 + 8 = 80$.\nThe total number of patients without asplenia ($D-$) is $FP + TN = 18 + 102 = 120$.\nThe total number of patients with a positive HJB test ($T+$) is $TP + FP = 72 + 18 = 90$.\nThe total number of patients with a negative HJB test ($T-$) is $FN + TN = 8 + 102 = 110$.\nThe total number of patients in the cohort is $80 + 120 = 200$ or $90 + 110 = 200$, confirming the consistency of the data.\n\nNow, we calculate the four requested metrics using their fundamental definitions as conditional probabilities.\n\n**1. Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**\nSensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. It is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T+ | D+) = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{72}{72 + 8} = \\frac{72}{80} = 0.9 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.9000$.\n\n**2. Specificity (True Negative Rate)**\nSpecificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such. It is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease.\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T- | D-) = \\frac{TN}{FP + TN} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{102}{18 + 102} = \\frac{102}{120} = 0.85 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.8500$.\n\n**3. Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nPPV is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives. It is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result.\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D+ | T+) = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{72}{72 + 18} = \\frac{72}{90} = 0.8 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.8000$.\n\n**4. Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nNPV is the proportion of negative test results that are true negatives. It is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result.\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D- | T-) = \\frac{TN}{FN + TN} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{102}{8 + 102} = \\frac{102}{110} \\approx 0.927272... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.9273$.\n\nThe calculated values, rounded to $4$ significant figures, are:\n-   Sensitivity: $0.9000$\n-   Specificity: $0.8500$\n-   Positive Predictive Value: $0.8000$\n-   Negative Predictive Value: $0.9273$\n\nThese values are to be reported in the specified order.",

Consider a cohort in which a proportion $p_{\\text{vacc}}$ of patients received pneumococcal vaccination and the remaining proportion $p_{\\text{unvacc}} = 1 - p_{\\text{vacc}}$ did not.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core task is to derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for a cohort-wide prophylactic antibiotic intervention. The NNT is defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR, in turn, is the difference between the risk of the outcome (Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection, OPSI) in the untreated cohort and the risk in the treated cohort.\n\nFirst, we define the cumulative risk, $R$, of an event over a time interval of length $t$, given a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$. The relationship is given by:\n$$R(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nThe cohort is stratified into two groups: vaccinated and unvaccinated. We begin by calculating the baseline (no prophylaxis) one-year risk of OPSI for each stratum, using the provided constant hazard rates. The time horizon is $t=1\\ \\text{year}$.\n\nFor the vaccinated stratum, with proportion $p_{\\text{vacc}}$ and hazard rate $\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}}$, the one-year risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{vacc, no-proph}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}} t)$$\n\nFor the unvaccinated stratum, with proportion $p_{\\text{unvacc}}$ and hazard rate $\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}}$, the one-year risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{unvacc, no-proph}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}} t)$$\n\nThe overall baseline risk for the entire cohort, $R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}}$, is the weighted average of the risks of the two strata, where the weights are the proportions of each stratum in the cohort:\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} = p_{\\text{vacc}} R_{\\text{vacc, no-proph}} + p_{\\text{unvacc}} R_{\\text{unvacc, no-proph}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the strata-specific risks, we get:\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} = p_{\\text{vacc}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}} t)\\right) + p_{\\text{unvacc}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}} t)\\right)$$\n\nNext, we consider the intervention: prophylactic antibiotics administered to the entire cohort. The problem states that this intervention results in a relative risk (risk ratio) of $RR$. By definition, the relative risk is the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the untreated (control) group.\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{\\text{cohort, proph}}}{R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}}}$$\nTherefore, the risk in the treated cohort, $R_{\\text{cohort, proph}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, proph}} = RR \\times R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}}$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference in risk between the untreated and treated groups:\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} - R_{\\text{cohort, proph}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\text{cohort, proph}}$:\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} - (RR \\times R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}})$$\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} (1 - RR)$$\n\nFinally, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} (1 - RR)}$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}}$ yields the complete formula for the NNT:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{(1 - RR) \\left[ p_{\\text{vacc}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}} t)\\right) + p_{\\text{unvacc}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}} t)\\right) \\right]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $p_{\\text{vacc}} = 0.7$\n- $p_{\\text{unvacc}} = 0.3$\n- $\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$\n- $\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}} = 3.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$\n- $t = 1\\ \\text{year}$\n- $RR = 0.45$\n\nFirst, we calculate the arguments of the exponential functions:\n$$-\\lambda_{\\text{vacc}} t = -(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 1 = -0.0012$$\n$$-\\lambda_{\\text{unvacc}} t = -(3.8 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 1 = -0.0038$$\n\nNext, we calculate the one-year risks for each stratum:\n$$R_{\\text{vacc, no-proph}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.0012)$$\n$$R_{\\text{unvacc, no-proph}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.0038)$$\n\nNow, we compute the overall baseline cohort risk, $R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} = 0.7 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.0012)\\right) + 0.3 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.0038)\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} \\approx 0.7 \\left(1 - 0.99880072\\right) + 0.3 \\left(1 - 0.99620721\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} \\approx 0.7 \\left(0.00119928\\right) + 0.3 \\left(0.00379279\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} \\approx 0.00083950 + 0.00113784$$\n$$R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} \\approx 0.00197734$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{cohort, no-proph}} (1 - RR)$$\n$$ARR \\approx 0.00197734 \\times (1 - 0.45)$$\n$$ARR \\approx 0.00197734 \\times 0.55$$\n$$ARR \\approx 0.00108754$$\n\nFinally, we compute the NNT:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00108754}$$\n$$NNT \\approx 919.511$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $920$.",

            "problem": "A $34$-year-old male underwent emergency splenectomy $18$ months ago for traumatic splenic rupture and has missed booster vaccinations. He presents $6$ hours after the onset of rigors, vomiting, and confusion. On arrival, his vital signs are: respiratory rate $30$ breaths per minute, heart rate $128$ beats per minute, systolic blood pressure $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, temperature $39.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, oxygen saturation $88\\%$ on room air, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score $13$ with new confusion.

For the purpose of a single numeric output, the institution uses a composite splenic sepsis escalation index defined by $I = \\mathrm{qSOFA} + \\mathrm{NEWS}2$. Compute $I$. Express the final value of $I$ as an exact integer with no rounding. No units are required for $I$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary clinical data to compute the requested scores based on standard, universally accepted medical definitions (qSOFA and NEWS2). The premises are clinically realistic, describing a classic presentation of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). The composite index $I$ is explicitly defined, ensuring a unique solution can be derived from the provided data.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, then the National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), and finally combining them to find the composite index $I$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the qSOFA Score**\n\nThe qSOFA score is a bedside prompt to identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome. It consists of three criteria, with one point awarded for each criterion that is met. A score of $2$ or more suggests a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.\n\nThe three criteria are:\n- Respiratory rate (RR) $\\ge 22$ breaths per minute.\n- Altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale score $< 15$).\n- Systolic blood pressure (SBP) $\\le 100 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nApplying the patient's data:\n- The patient's respiratory rate is $30$ breaths per minute. Since $30 \\ge 22$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n- The patient has new confusion and a GCS score of $13$. Since $13 < 15$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n- The patient's systolic blood pressure is $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. Since $88 \\le 100$, this criterion is met. (Score = $+1$)\n\nThe total qSOFA score is the sum of the points for each criterion:\n$$ \\mathrm{qSOFA}_{\\text{score}} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the NEWS2 Score**\n\nThe NEWS2 score is a standardized system for assessing the severity of a patient's illness. It is based on six physiological parameters plus a seventh for supplemental oxygen use.\n\nThe patient's parameters are scored as follows:\n- **Respiratory Rate (RR):** The patient's RR is $30$ breaths/min. In the NEWS2 scoring system, an RR $\\ge 25$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2):** The patient's SpO2 is $88\\%$ on room air. The problem states no history of chronic lung disease, so Scale $1$ is used. An SpO2 $\\le 91\\%$ on Scale $1$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Supplemental Oxygen:** The patient is on room air. This scores $0$ points.\n- **Temperature:** The patient's temperature is $39.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature $\\ge 39.1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ scores $2$ points.\n- **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** The patient's SBP is $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. An SBP $\\le 90 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ scores $3$ points.\n- **Heart Rate (HR):** The patient's HR is $128$ beats/min. A heart rate between $111$ and $130$ beats/min scores $2$ points.\n- **Level of Consciousness:** The patient is described as having \"new confusion.\" Any new confusion (or a score of V, P, or U on the AVPU scale) scores $3$ points.\n\nThe total NEWS2 score is the sum of the individual parameter scores:\n$$ \\mathrm{NEWS}2_{\\text{score}} = \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{RR}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{SpO2}} + \\underbrace{0}_{\\text{O2}} + \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{Temp}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{SBP}} + \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{HR}} + \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{Consciousness}} = 16 $$\n\nA NEWS2 score of $7$ or more is a high-risk score, indicating a high likelihood of clinical deterioration and mandating an urgent response by a critical care team. This patient's score of $16$ signifies an extremely critical condition.\n\n**3. Proposed Escalation Plan (Qualitative Discussion)**\n\nThe patient presents with septic shock (hypotension, confusion, and hyperlactatemia) secondary to suspected OPSI, a life-threatening emergency. The management plan must be immediate and aggressive.\n- **Fluid Resuscitation:** The patient is hypotensive (SBP $88 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) with a lactate of $5.8 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, indicating severe tissue hypoperfusion. Immediate, aggressive fluid resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid solution at $30 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ is indicated. For a $70 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ patient, this amounts to $2100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$, administered rapidly. If hypotension persists, vasopressor therapy (e.g., norepinephrine) should be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least $65 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- **Antimicrobial Therapy:** Given the high mortality of OPSI, empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics must be administered within one hour of recognition, after blood cultures are drawn. The regimen must cover encapsulated organisms, the most common pathogens in OPSI ($Streptococcus$ $pneumoniae$, $Haemophilus$ $influenzae$ type b, and $Neisseria$ $meningitidis$). A standard high-potency regimen includes a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone $2 \\ \\mathrm{g}$) plus vancomycin (to cover for resistant pneumococci and staphylococci).\n- **Supportive Care:** The patient's hypoxia (SpO2 $88\\%$) and tachypnea (RR $30$) require immediate supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation $>94\\%$. Given the altered mental status and high work of breathing, immediate admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is mandatory for continuous monitoring, with a low threshold for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Composite Splenic Sepsis Escalation Index ($I$)**\n\nThe problem defines the composite index $I$ as the sum of the qSOFA and NEWS2 scores.\n$$ I = \\mathrm{qSOFA} + \\mathrm{NEWS}2 $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ I = 3 + 16 = 19 $$\n\nThe value of the composite index $I$ is $19$.",
