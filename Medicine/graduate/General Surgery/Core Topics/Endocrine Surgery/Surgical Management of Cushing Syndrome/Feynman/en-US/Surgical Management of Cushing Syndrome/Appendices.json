            "problem": "A patient presents with classic hypercortisolism features including proximal muscle weakness, violaceous striae, easy bruising, hypertension, and new-onset diabetes mellitus. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis follows negative feedback: Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates pituitary secretion of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), which stimulates adrenal cortisol production; cortisol feeds back negatively on both CRH and ACTH. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, engages the glucocorticoid receptor, exerting feedback suppression of ACTH in glucocorticoid-sensitive corticotrophs. In ACTH-independent adrenal hypercortisolism, circulating ACTH is suppressed by feedback; in ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, ACTH is inappropriately normal or elevated. Pituitary corticotroph adenomas (Cushing disease) retain some glucocorticoid receptor–mediated feedback, whereas ectopic ACTH sources typically do not suppress.\n\nThe following data are obtained:\n- Baseline morning serum cortisol: $28\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\n- Overnight low-dose dexamethasone ($1\\ \\text{mg}$ at $23{:}00$) morning serum cortisol: $26\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\n- High-dose dexamethasone ($8\\ \\text{mg}$ total overnight) morning serum cortisol: $9\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\n- Plasma ACTH: $45\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$ (laboratory reference $10$–$60\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$).\n\nAn abdominal computed tomography scan notes a $1.2\\ \\text{cm}$ left adrenal nodule with noncontrast attenuation of $8\\ \\text{HU}$, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging shows a $4\\ \\text{mm}$ hypoenhancing lesion in the right anterior pituitary.

Bilateral adrenalectomy as initial definitive therapy.\nD. Empiric thoracic surgery to resect a presumed ectopic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) source without further localization.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established pathophysiology of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the clinical diagnostics of Cushing's syndrome. The data provided are internally consistent, well-posed, and objective, allowing for a logical deduction of the diagnosis and appropriate management plan.\n\nThe solution proceeds by a systematic analysis of the provided data.\n\n**1. Confirmation and Classification of Hypercortisolism**\n\nThe diagnosis of hypercortisolism is confirmed by the failure of the overnight low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). A normal physiological response to $1\\ \\text{mg}$ of dexamethasone is the suppression of morning serum cortisol to a low level (typically $<1.8\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$). The patient's morning serum cortisol after the LDDST was $26\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$, which is profoundly abnormal and confirms the presence of pathological, autonomous cortisol secretion.\n\nThe next step is to classify the hypercortisolism as either ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.\n- **ACTH-independent hypercortisolism** is caused by a primary adrenal pathology (e.g., an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma) that autonomously secretes cortisol. The resulting high cortisol levels suppress pituitary ACTH secretion via negative feedback, leading to a low or undetectable plasma ACTH level (typically $<5\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$).\n- **ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism** is caused by excessive ACTH secretion, either from a pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing disease) or from a non-pituitary, ectopic source (e.g., a small cell lung carcinoma or carcinoid tumor). This inappropriate ACTH secretion drives the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol, resulting in a plasma ACTH level that is normal or elevated.\n\nThe patient's plasma ACTH level is $45\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$, which falls within the provided laboratory reference range of $10$–$60\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$. An ACTH level in this range in the presence of confirmed hypercortisolism is inappropriately non-suppressed and is therefore diagnostic of **ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism**. This finding effectively rules out a primary cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor as the cause.\n\n**2. Localization of the ACTH Source**\n\nOnce ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism is established, the differential diagnosis is between a pituitary source (Cushing disease) and an ectopic ACTH source. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) is a key tool for this differentiation.\n\nThe principle, as stated in the problem, is that most pituitary corticotroph adenomas retain some degree of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated negative feedback. Therefore, they will suppress ACTH (and consequently cortisol) production in response to a high dose of dexamethasone. In contrast, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors are typically autonomous and do not express functional glucocorticoid receptors, so they fail to suppress.\n\nA standard criterion for suppression consistent with Cushing disease is a reduction in serum cortisol of $>50\\%$ from baseline after the HDDST. Let's perform a quantitative assessment:\n- Baseline morning serum cortisol ($C_{\\text{baseline}}$): $28\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\n- Post-HDDST morning serum cortisol ($C_{\\text{HDDST}}$): $9\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\n\nThe percentage suppression is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Suppression} \\% = \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{baseline}} - C_{\\text{HDDST}}}{C_{\\text{baseline}}} \\right) \\times 100\\% $$\n$$ \\text{Suppression} \\% = \\left( \\frac{28\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL} - 9\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}}{28\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{19}{28} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 67.9\\% $$\nA suppression of approximately $68\\%$ is greater than the $50\\%$ threshold, strongly suggesting that the source of the ACTH is a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease).\n\n**3. Correlation with Imaging Findings**\n\nThe biochemical diagnosis must be correlated with imaging.\n- **Pituitary MRI**: The discovery of a $4\\ \\text{mm}$ hypoenhancing lesion in the right anterior pituitary is a direct anatomical correlate for the biochemically diagnosed pituitary microadenoma. This finding confirms the diagnosis of Cushing disease.\n- **Abdominal CT**: The $1.2\\ \\text{cm}$ left adrenal nodule with noncontrast attenuation of $8\\ \\text{HU}$ is a classic adrenal \"incidentaloma.\" The attenuation value ($\\le10\\ \\text{HU}$) indicates it is a lipid-rich, benign adenoma. Since the hypercortisolism is ACTH-dependent, this adrenal nodule is non-functional and is not the cause of the disease. The adrenal glands in ACTH-dependent Cushing's are typically bilaterally hyperplastic due to chronic ACTH stimulation, but discrete incidentalomas are also common.\n\n**Conclusion on Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nThe collective evidence—ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism ($ACTH = 45\\ \\text{pg}/\\text{mL}$), suppression of cortisol by $>50\\%$ with high-dose dexamethasone, and a corresponding lesion on pituitary MRI—points definitively to a diagnosis of Cushing disease caused by a pituitary microadenoma. The first-line, and potentially curative, treatment for Cushing disease is the selective surgical removal of the pituitary adenoma via a transsphenoidal approach.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy of the left adrenal nodule.**\n    This surgical option targets the adrenal gland. It would be appropriate for ACTH-independent hypercortisolism. The patient's disease is ACTH-dependent, and the adrenal nodule is an incidental finding. This intervention would fail to address the root cause (the pituitary tumor) and would not cure the hypercortisolism.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary corticotroph microadenoma.**\n    This procedure directly targets the pathologically confirmed source of the disease: the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. It is the standard-of-care, first-line surgical treatment for Cushing disease with the goal of cure while preserving pituitary function.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Bilateral adrenalectomy as initial definitive therapy.**\n    Bilateral adrenalectomy removes the target organs of ACTH action, thus curing the hypercortisolism. However, it is a salvage therapy, not a first-line treatment when the primary tumor is identifiable and resectable. It necessitates lifelong steroid replacement and carries the risk of Nelson's syndrome (uninhibited growth of the pituitary adenoma). Given that a resectable pituitary adenoma has been identified, this is not the most appropriate initial intervention.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Empiric thoracic surgery to resect a presumed ectopic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) source without further localization.**\n    This option assumes an ectopic ACTH source. The biochemical data (suppression on HDDST) argue strongly against this diagnosis. Furthermore, performing major surgery such as a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy \"empirically\" without having localized a tumor is contrary to all surgical principles and carries unacceptable risk.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The calculated harm of $480$ is substantially higher than the minimum. Relying on a pituitary MRI with only $S_M=0.60$ sensitivity and $C_M=0.80$ specificity to make a major surgical decision leads to a high number of wrong-site surgeries.\n\nB. **Algorithm B:** Incorrect. The calculated harm of $140.9$ is very close to, but slightly higher than, that of Algorithm C. The combination of CRH and HDDST is more specific than MRI alone, but not as definitive as IPSS, still resulting in some wrong-site surgeries before the IPSS step.\n\nC. **Algorithm C:** Correct. This algorithm yields the lowest total harm of $140$. By using the most accurate test (IPSS, with $S_I = 0.95$ and $C_I = 0.98$) for all patients before any surgical commitment, it maximally reduces the number of wrong-site surgeries. The harm from universal IPSS ($100$ units) is more than offset by the reduction in harm from surgical errors (only $40$ units).\n\nD. **Algorithm D:** Incorrect. This algorithm is clinically illogical and results in a catastrophic expected harm of $1360$. It initiates workup by looking for a pathology (primary adrenal disease) that has already been ruled out by the finding of ACTH-dependent disease, leading to a high rate of incorrect surgeries.",

Express your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} D & L \\end{pmatrix}$, where $D$ is the enoxaparin dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours if indicated by the category mapping above (use $D=0$ if no pharmacological prophylaxis is indicated), and $L$ is the total duration in days. No rounding is required. Do not include units in the final boxed answer; use the units specified here.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a systematic application of a provided set of clinical risk stratification rules and prophylaxis guidelines to a specific patient case. The process involves three main steps: calculating the patient's Caprini risk score, determining the corresponding prophylaxis intensity, and establishing the total duration of prophylaxis based on postoperative factors.\n\nFirst, the patient's Caprini score for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk must be calculated by summing the points for all applicable risk factors provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Age**: The patient is $46$ years old. This falls within the \"Age $41$–$60$ years\" category, which confers $1$ point.\n2.  **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: The patient's BMI is $36\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$. This value is greater than the threshold of $25\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, conferring $1$ point.\n3.  **Surgery Duration**: The operation duration is $120$ minutes. This is classified as \"Major surgery $>45$ minutes\", which confers $2$ points.\n4.  **Estrogen Therapy**: The patient is on combined estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills, which falls under \"Estrogen therapy\", conferring $1$ point.\n5.  **Immobilization**: The patient is on strict bedrest for $96$ hours postoperatively. This meets the criterion for \"Bedrest immobilization $\\geq 72$ hours\", conferring $1$ point.\n6.  **Hypercoagulable State**: The patient has Cushing's disease, which is specified to be treated as an \"Acquired hypercoagulable state\", conferring $3$ points.\n\nThe total Caprini score is the sum of these individual points:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9 $$\n\nSecond, this total score is used to determine the patient's risk category and the appropriate prophylaxis intensity. The \"Caprini Risk Assessment Model categories\" define a score of $\\geq 9$ points as the \"Highest\" risk category. According to the \"Prophylaxis intensity mapping by category\", the \"Highest\" risk category mandates \"LMWH enoxaparin $40\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours plus mechanical methods.\" The problem asks for the parameter $D$, defined as the enoxaparin dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours. Based on the mapping, this value is $40$.\n$$ D = 40 $$\n\nThird, the total duration of pharmacological prophylaxis, $L$, must be calculated using the \"Duration mapping\". This mapping is conditional upon the patient's postoperative mobility and biochemical status.\n\n1.  **Postoperative Mobility**: The patient is on strict bedrest for $96$ hours. The condition for extended duration is \"postoperative mobility is limited (bedrest $\\geq 72$ hours)\". Since $96 \\geq 72$, this condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Biochemical Status**: The problem defines \"persistent hypercortisolism\" as a postoperative day $1$ serum cortisol $\\geq 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/dL}$. The patient's serum cortisol is $18\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/dL}$. Since $18 \\geq 10$, the condition for persistent hypercortisolism is satisfied.\n\nThe duration mapping provides a specific rule for when both conditions are met: \"If both limited mobility (bedrest $\\geq 72$ hours) and persistent hypercortisolism are present, extend to $42$ days.\" Since both criteria are met in this case, the total duration of prophylaxis is $42$ days.\n$$ L = 42 $$\n\nFinally, the answer is to be expressed as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} D & L \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the derived values for $D$ and $L$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 40 & 42 \\end{pmatrix} $$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 40 & 42 \\end{pmatrix}}$$"
