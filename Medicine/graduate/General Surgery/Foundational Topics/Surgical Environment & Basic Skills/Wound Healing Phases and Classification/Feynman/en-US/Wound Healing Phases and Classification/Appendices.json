            "problem": "A linear midline skin incision, created under sterile conditions in the operating room, measures $L = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in length and is classified as a clean-contaminated wound according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification (Class II). The surgical team plans a primary intention closure using simple interrupted skin sutures, guided by Halsted’s principles of gentle tissue handling and evenly distributed tension to support orderly progression through the phases of wound healing (hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation). To optimize perfusion and minimize wound edge ischemia, the center-to-center spacing between adjacent sutures along the incision is standardized at $s = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and each stitch will take symmetric dermal bites of size $b = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ from each wound edge to achieve reliable eversion without excess strangulation. Assume the incision is straight, tissue creep is negligible during placement, there is no dog-ear formation, and no special corner or anchoring stitches are required beyond the regularly spaced simple interrupted sutures. The first stitch is placed at a distance of $s/2$ from one end of the incision, and subsequent stitches are placed every $s$ along the length so that the last stitch lies $s/2$ from the opposite end, maintaining even edge-to-edge perfusion along the entire wound.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and starting from first principles of discretizing a continuous length by equal center-to-center intervals, determine the exact number $N$ of simple interrupted sutures required to span the incision under the described plan. Express your answer as an exact integer. No rounding is required and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to attempting a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total length of the incision: $L = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- Wound classification: Clean-contaminated (CDC Class II).\n- Closure method: Primary intention with simple interrupted sutures.\n- Center-to-center spacing between adjacent sutures: $s = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Dermal bite size from each wound edge: $b = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- First suture placement: distance of $s/2$ from one end of the incision.\n- Last suture placement: distance of $s/2$ from the opposite end of the incision.\n- The incision is a straight line.\n- Assumptions: Negligible tissue creep, no dog-ear formation, no special corner stitches.\n- Objective: Determine the exact number $N$ of simple interrupted sutures required.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set in a realistic surgical context. The parameters, such as incision length and suture spacing, are plausible. The terminology (CDC classification, primary intention, Halsted's principles) is correct and standard in medicine.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of conditions to determine a unique integer solution for the number of sutures, $N$. The geometric and placement constraints are clearly defined and consistent. The information regarding wound classification, bite size $b$, and surgical principles provides context but does not introduce contradictions or ambiguities into the mathematical task.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It asks for a specific numerical value based on the provided data and constraints.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formalizable problem in applied geometry and discrete mathematics, grounded in a valid scientific context.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\nThe problem requires determining the number of sutures, $N$, needed to close an incision of length $L$ with a specified spacing rule. Let the incision lie along a one-dimensional axis from position $0$ to $L$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$$L = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$s = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nTo perform the calculation, the units must be consistent. We convert the length $L$ from centimeters to millimeters:\n$$L = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe placement rule states that the first suture is at a distance of $\\frac{s}{2}$ from one end (position $0$), and the last suture is at a distance of $\\frac{s}{2}$ from the other end (position $L$). The sutures are spaced by a distance $s$.\n\nLet us model the total length $L$ as the sum of all the intervals along the incision. If there are $N$ sutures, there are $N-1$ intervals of length $s$ between the first and the last suture. The total length is composed of the initial gap from the end to the first suture, the sum of the lengths of the inter-suture intervals, and the final gap from the last suture to the other end.\n\nMathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n$$L = (\\text{initial gap}) + (\\text{sum of inter-suture intervals}) + (\\text{final gap})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L = \\frac{s}{2} + (N-1)s + \\frac{s}{2}$$\n\nWe can now solve this equation for $N$. First, combine the terms involving $\\frac{s}{2}$:\n$$L = \\left(\\frac{s}{2} + \\frac{s}{2}\\right) + (N-1)s$$\n$$L = s + (N-1)s$$\nFactor out the common term $s$:\n$$L = s(1 + (N-1))$$\n$$L = s(1 + N - 1)$$\n$$L = sN$$\n\nThis remarkably simple relationship demonstrates that the specified placement convention (starting and ending with a half-interval) is equivalent to partitioning the total length $L$ into $N$ contiguous segments, each of width $s$.\n\nTo find the number of sutures $N$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{s}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values for $L$ and $s$ in consistent units (millimeters):\n$$N = \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{mm}}$$\n$$N = 20$$\n\nThe number of sutures required is exactly $20$. The additional information such as the wound classification (CDC Class II), bite size ($b=10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$), and adherence to Halsted's principles, while critical for the surgical context and indicating a valid, well-planned procedure, are not necessary for the purely mathematical calculation of $N$.",

The scenario of a colon resection is a common surgical procedure. The risk model, while a simplification, is a valid mathematical construct for a problem of this nature.

There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task requires two sequential steps: first, to classify the surgical wound based on the provided definitions and procedural details, and second, to calculate the estimated Surgical Site Infection (SSI) risk using the given model.\n\n**1. Wound Classification**\n\nThe procedure described is a \"left colon resection,\" which involves operating on the colon, a part of the alimentary (gastrointestinal) tract. A \"controlled enterotomy\" confirms that the alimentary tract was intentionally opened under controlled conditions.\n\nWe evaluate the scenario against the provided wound class definitions:\n- **Clean**: This class requires \"no entry into the ... alimentary ... tract.\" Since the colon was entered, this case cannot be classified as Clean.\n- **Clean-Contaminated**: This class is defined by a \"controlled entry into one of these tracts without unusual contamination.\" The scenario specifies a \"controlled enterotomy,\" \"no gross spillage,\" and \"no pre-existing intra-abdominal infection.\" This description perfectly aligns with the definition of a Clean-Contaminated wound.\n- **Contaminated**: This class involves a \"major break in sterile technique,\" \"gross spillage,\" or \"fresh traumatic wounds.\" The problem explicitly states that \"sterile technique is maintained\" and there was \"no gross spillage.\" Therefore, the case is not Contaminated.\n- **Dirty or Infected**: This class applies when there is \"established infection or perforated viscera.\" The problem states there was \"no pre-existing intra-abdominal infection.\" Therefore, the case is not Dirty or Infected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the operation is correctly classified as **Clean-Contaminated**.\n\n**2. SSI Risk Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides a model for SSI risk based on wound class. The classes, in increasing order of contamination and risk, are: Clean, Clean-Contaminated, Contaminated, and Dirty/Infected.\n\nLet $R_{clean}$ be the risk for the Clean class, $R_{cc}$ for Clean-Contaminated, $R_{con}$ for Contaminated, and $R_{dirty}$ for Dirty/Infected.\n\nThe baseline risk for the Clean class is given as:\n$$R_{clean} = 0.02$$\n\nThe model states that the relative risk doubles with each successive class increment. The Clean-Contaminated class is the first increment above the Clean class. Therefore, its risk, $R_{cc}$, is twice the risk of the Clean class.\n\n$$R_{cc} = 2 \\times R_{clean}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $R_{clean}$:\n$$R_{cc} = 2 \\times 0.02$$\n$$R_{cc} = 0.04$$\n\nThe estimated SSI risk for this case, which falls into the Clean-Contaminated class, is $0.04$.",

It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and contains no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem describes the evolution of wound tensile strength in two distinct phases.\nFirst, for the time interval $0 \\le t \\le t_{\\text{lag}}$, there is a lag phase where the tensile strength is constant. We are given $t_{\\text{lag}} = 4$ days and the strength during this phase is $S_{\\text{lag}} = 0.03$.\nSo, for $0 \\le t \\le 4$, $S(t) = 0.03$.\n\nSecond, for time $t \\ge t_{\\text{lag}}$, the tensile strength $S(t)$ increases according to the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = k(S_{\\infty} - S)\n$$\nThe initial condition for this phase is the strength at the end of the lag phase, which is $S(t_{\\text{lag}}) = S_{\\text{lag}}$, or $S(4) = 0.03$. We are given the parameters $k = 0.05$ day$^{-1}$ and $S_{\\infty} = 0.8$.\n\nWe must solve this ODE to find the function $S(t)$ for $t \\ge t_{\\text{lag}}$. This is a separable linear first-order ODE. We can separate the variables $S$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{S_{\\infty} - S} = k \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the particular solution, we integrate both sides. We will integrate from the initial condition $(t_{\\text{lag}}, S_{\\text{lag}})$ to a general point $(t, S(t))$.\n$$\n\\int_{S_{\\text{lag}}}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S_{\\infty} - S'} \\, dS' = \\int_{t_{\\text{lag}}}^{t} k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integral on the left is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\ln|S_{\\infty} - S'| \\right]_{S_{\\text{lag}}}^{S(t)} = -\\ln|S_{\\infty} - S(t)| - (-\\ln|S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}|) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{|S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}|}{|S_{\\infty} - S(t)|}\\right)\n$$\nSince the healing process starts from $S_{\\text{lag}} < S_{\\infty}$ and approaches $S_{\\infty}$ from below, the term $S_{\\infty} - S(t)$ will always be positive for finite $t$. Thus, we can drop the absolute value signs.\n\nThe integral on the right is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{\\text{lag}}}^{t} k \\, dt' = k [t']_{t_{\\text{lag}}}^{t} = k(t - t_{\\text{lag}})\n$$\nEquating the two results:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}{S_{\\infty} - S(t)}\\right) = k(t - t_{\\text{lag}})\n$$\nNow, we solve for $S(t)$ by exponentiating both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}{S_{\\infty} - S(t)} = \\exp(k(t - t_{\\text{lag}}))\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $S(t)$:\n$$\nS_{\\infty} - S(t) = (S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}})\\exp(-k(t - t_{\\text{lag}}))\n$$\n$$\nS(t) = S_{\\infty} - (S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}})\\exp(-k(t - t_{\\text{lag}}))\n$$\nThis equation describes the tensile strength for $t \\ge t_{\\text{lag}}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the time $T$ at which the incision attains half-normal tensile strength, which corresponds to $S(T) = 0.5$. Since $0.5 > S_{\\text{lag}} = 0.03$, this event must occur during the second phase, i.e., $T > t_{\\text{lag}}$. We can therefore use the derived expression for $S(t)$ by setting $t=T$ and $S(T)=0.5$:\n$$\n0.5 = S_{\\infty} - (S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}})\\exp(-k(T - t_{\\text{lag}}))\n$$\nNow, we solve for the time $T$:\n$$\n(S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}})\\exp(-k(T - t_{\\text{lag}})) = S_{\\infty} - 0.5\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-k(T - t_{\\text{lag}})) = \\frac{S_{\\infty} - 0.5}{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}\n$$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k(T - t_{\\text{lag}}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{\\infty} - 0.5}{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}\\right)\n$$\nTo eliminate the negative sign, we can invert the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\nk(T - t_{\\text{lag}}) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{S_{\\infty} - 0.5}{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}{S_{\\infty} - 0.5}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $T$:\n$$\nT = t_{\\text{lag}} + \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{\\infty} - S_{\\text{lag}}}{S_{\\infty} - 0.5}\\right)\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $t_{\\text{lag}} = 4$ days, $S_{\\text{lag}} = 0.03$, $S_{\\infty} = 0.8$, and $k = 0.05$ day$^{-1}$.\n$$\nT = 4 + \\frac{1}{0.05} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8 - 0.03}{0.8 - 0.5}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT = 4 + 20 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.77}{0.30}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT = 4 + 20 \\ln(2.5666...)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\ln(2.5666...) \\approx 0.942603\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx 4 + 20 \\times 0.942603\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx 4 + 18.85206\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx 22.85206 \\text{ days}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures of $22.85206$ are $2$, $2$, and $8$. The fourth digit is $5$, so we round the third digit up.\n$$\nT \\approx 22.9 \\text{ days}\n$$",
