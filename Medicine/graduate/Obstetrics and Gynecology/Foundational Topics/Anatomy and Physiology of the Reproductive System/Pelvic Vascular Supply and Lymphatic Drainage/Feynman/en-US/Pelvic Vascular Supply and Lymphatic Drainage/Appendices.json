This exercise uses a simplified model of the uterine artery to explore the Hagen-Poiseuille law, demonstrating how profoundly the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is influenced by changes in vessel radius, $r$. Mastering this $Q \\propto r^4$ relationship is essential for understanding both normal physiological adaptations, like those in pregnancy, and the consequences of vascular pathologies.",

The Hagen–Poiseuille relation is applicable.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically hemodynamics. The Hagen-Poiseuille law is a standard and appropriate model for the given assumptions. The physiological context and values are plausible for a uterine artery during mid-gestation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to determine the required ratio. All terms are clearly defined, and the objective is unambiguous. The problem is free from contradictions, subjective claims, and other invalidating flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided, starting from the first principles as requested.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a determination of the change in volumetric flow rate, starting from first principles for laminar flow in a rigid tube. This entails deriving the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.\n\nConsider a cylindrical pipe of radius $R$ and length $L$. For steady, laminar flow of an incompressible fluid, there is a balance between the pressure force driving the flow and the viscous drag force opposing it. Let us analyze the forces on a cylinder of fluid of radius $r$ (where $r \\le R$) concentric with the pipe axis.\n\nThe pressure force is the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ acting on the cross-sectional area $\\pi r^2$:\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = \\Delta P (\\pi r^2)$$\n\nThe viscous drag force acts on the cylindrical surface area $2\\pi r L$. According to Newton's law of viscosity, the shear stress $\\tau$ is related to the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv}{dr}$. To be precise, $\\tau = -\\eta \\frac{dv}{dr}$, where the negative sign indicates that the fluid velocity $v$ decreases as the radial distance $r$ from the center increases. The drag force is:\n$$F_{\\text{viscous}} = \\tau (2\\pi r L) = \\left(-\\eta \\frac{dv}{dr}\\right)(2\\pi r L)$$\n\nFor steady flow (no acceleration), the net force is zero, so $F_{\\text{pressure}} + F_{\\text{viscous}} = 0$.\n$$\\Delta P (\\pi r^2) - \\eta \\frac{dv}{dr} (2\\pi r L) = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for the velocity gradient:\n$$\\frac{dv}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} r$$\n\nTo find the velocity profile $v(r)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $r$:\n$$v(r) = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} r \\, dr = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} r^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We apply the no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the artery, which has a total radius we will now call $R$. At $r=R$, the fluid velocity is zero, so $v(R)=0$.\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} R^2 + C \\implies C = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} R^2$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow:\n$$v(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (R^2 - r^2)$$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe. We integrate infinitesimal annular rings of area $dA = 2\\pi r dr$:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{R} v(r) dA = \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr$$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} \\int_{0}^{R} (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) - (0) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)$$\nThis yields the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis equation expresses the volumetric flow rate $Q$ as a function of the pipe radius $R$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and pipe length $L$.\n\nNow we apply this relationship to the problem. Let $Q_{\\text{before}}$ be the flow rate with radius $r_{\\text{before}}$ and $Q_{\\text{after}}$ be the flow rate with radius $r_{\\text{after}}$.\nThe flow rate before the radius change is:\n$$Q_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{before}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe flow rate after the radius change is:\n$$Q_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{after}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe problem states that $\\Delta P$, $L$, and $\\eta$ are constant. We are asked to find the multiplicative change in flow rate, which is the ratio $Q_{\\text{after}} / Q_{\\text{before}}$.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{after}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{before}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}$$\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{(r_{\\text{after}})^4}{(r_{\\text{before}})^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{after}}}{r_{\\text{before}}}\\right)^4$$\nThis shows that the volumetric flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, a key consequence of the Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n\nWe are given the values $r_{\\text{before}} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_{\\text{after}} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Substituting these into the expression:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\left(\\frac{2.5}{2.0}\\right)^4$$\nWe simplify the fraction inside the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{2.5}{2.0} = \\frac{25}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\nNow, we compute the fourth power of this fraction:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{5^4}{4^4}$$\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n$$5^4 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\times 25 = 625$$\n$$4^4 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\times 16 = 256$$\nThus, the exact multiplicative change in volumetric flow rate is:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{625}{256}$$\nThis fraction is in its simplest form, as the prime factorization of the numerator is $5^4$ and that of the denominator is $(2^2)^4 = 2^8$, and they share no common prime factors.",

This exercise bridges theory and clinical practice by focusing on the uterine artery waveform, a key component in assessing uteroplacental circulation. By calculating the Pulsatility Index ($PI$) from waveform data and analyzing how it reflects changes in distal resistance, you will develop the skills to interpret these vital diagnostic measurements in contexts such as fetal surveillance and preeclampsia screening.",

            "problem": "In a hemodynamic assessment of pelvic vascular supply relevant to obstetrics and gynecology, a transvaginal Doppler ultrasonography of the uterine artery is performed in a nulliparous patient during the late proliferative phase. The waveform shows a clear systolic peak and diastolic trough, and the machine reports the following cycle-averaged velocities: peak systolic velocity $S = 60$ cm/s, end-diastolic velocity $D = 20$ cm/s, and time-averaged mean velocity $\\bar{v} = 30$ cm/s. The Pulsatility Index (PI) is a dimensionless quantity used in Doppler ultrasonography (DU) to quantify waveform pulsatility.\n\nStarting from the foundational hemodynamic principles that relate volumetric flow and velocity to vascular resistance and compliance (e.g., Poiseuille’s law for steady laminar flow and the Windkessel concept for pulsatile flow), and from the standard definition that PI represents the normalized amplitude of velocity variation over a cardiac cycle relative to the mean, derive an expression for PI in terms of $S$, $D$, and $\\bar{v}$. Then compute the PI for the measurements given above. Express the final PI as an exact value with no rounding and no units.\n\nFinally, using the same hemodynamic framework, provide a qualitative interpretation of how a decrease in distal resistance within the uterine arterial tree (as occurs with physiologic trophoblastic remodeling of spiral arteries) would affect PI, and justify your reasoning without invoking any untested or device-specific heuristics. The qualitative interpretation is not part of the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The goal is to express the Pulsatility Index (PI) in terms of the measurable velocities of the Doppler waveform and then compute it for the given uterine artery data. We also aim to interpret how changes in distal resistance affect PI using basic hemodynamic reasoning.\n\nDefinitions and hemodynamic base:\n- In Doppler ultrasonography (DU), arterial velocity over a cardiac cycle is pulsatile due to periodic pressure and flow changes. The peak systolic velocity $S$ reflects the maximum forward velocity during systole, and the end-diastolic velocity $D$ reflects the minimum forward velocity (often above zero in low-resistance beds) at end-diastole. The time-averaged mean velocity $\\bar{v}$ is the average over the cardiac cycle.\n- The Pulsatility Index (PI) is defined conceptually as the normalized amplitude of the waveform’s velocity excursion relative to its cycle mean, capturing the magnitude of pulsatility independent of absolute scale. Under this definition, the amplitude of pulsatility is quantified by the difference between the peak and trough velocities, which for an arterial waveform is $S - D$, and normalization is achieved by dividing by the mean $\\bar{v}$. Therefore, the expression for PI in terms of measurable quantities is\n$$\n\\mathrm{PI} = \\frac{S - D}{\\bar{v}}.\n$$\n\nDerivation justification from hemodynamic principles:\n- Poiseuille’s law for steady laminar flow states $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$ with $R = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^{4}}$, where $Q$ is volumetric flow, $\\Delta P$ is pressure gradient, $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, $L$ is segment length, and $r$ is vessel radius. In pulsatile flow, instantaneous velocity $v(t)$ is proportional to instantaneous flow $Q(t)$ over cross-sectional area (assuming relatively constant caliber in the segment measured), so the time-course of $v(t)$ mirrors that of $Q(t)$ driven by arterial pressure and downstream resistance/compliance.\n- In the Windkessel model, distal compliance and resistance shape diastolic runoff: lower distal resistance and higher compliance increase $v(t)$ during diastole (increase $D$), reducing the relative pulsatility amplitude for a given mean $\\bar{v}$. This supports using the normalized difference $(S - D)/\\bar{v}$ to quantify pulsatility.\n\nCalculation:\nGiven $S = 60$ cm/s, $D = 20$ cm/s, and $\\bar{v} = 30$ cm/s,\n$$\n\\mathrm{PI} = \\frac{S - D}{\\bar{v}} = \\frac{60 - 20}{30} = \\frac{40}{30} = \\frac{4}{3}.\n$$\nPI is dimensionless, so no units are attached.\n\nQualitative interpretation of decreased distal resistance:\n- Consider a decrease in distal resistance $R$ due to trophoblastic remodeling of spiral arteries in pregnancy. From $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$, for any given arterial pressure waveform $\\Delta P(t)$, decreasing $R$ increases $Q(t)$ particularly in diastole because diastolic flow is most limited by resistance (as momentum and elastic recoil govern runoff). In DU terms, this manifests as an increase in end-diastolic velocity $D$ and often a modest increase in $\\bar{v}$.\n- Since $\\mathrm{PI} = \\frac{S - D}{\\bar{v}}$, an increase in $D$ reduces the numerator $(S - D)$. Although $\\bar{v}$ may rise, the reduction in $(S - D)$ is typically the dominant effect in low-resistance beds, leading to a net decrease in PI. Thus, decreased distal resistance lowers PI, reflecting reduced pulsatility and enhanced diastolic runoff, consistent with physiologic changes in uterine artery waveforms during healthy placentation.",
