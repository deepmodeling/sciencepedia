            "problem": "In a cross-sectional histology slide of the human umbilical cord, three vascular profiles are visible embedded in Wharton’s jelly: two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The vessel walls are cut near-perpendicular to the long axis, but two of the lumens appear mildly elliptical, consistent with oblique sectioning or differential post-fixation contraction. From vascular biomechanics, the circumferential wall stress definition and Laplace’s law for thin-walled cylinders state that the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ scales as $\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto \\dfrac{P r}{t}$, where $P$ is transmural pressure, $r$ is lumen radius, and $t$ is wall thickness.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding with a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Context:** A cross-sectional histology slide of a human umbilical cord shows three vascular profiles ($X$, $Y$, $Z$) embedded in Wharton's jelly. There are two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein.\n- **Biomechanical Principle:** Circumferential wall stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is proportional to $\\dfrac{P r}{t}$, where $P$ is transmural pressure, $r$ is lumen radius, and $t$ is wall thickness.\n- **Physiological Adaptation:** Higher-pressure vessels (arteries) are expected to have a larger wall thickness-to-lumen radius ratio ($\\dfrac{t}{r}$) compared to lower-pressure vessels (veins). Umbilical arteries have higher pressure than the umbilical vein.\n- **Task:** Construct a single-threshold decision rule using a wall thickness-to-lumen size ratio to classify two profiles as arteries and one as a vein.\n- **Data for Profile $X$:** Lumen described by orthogonal diameters $D_1 = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $D_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

The area of an ellipse with semi-axes $a$ and $b$ is $A = \\pi a b$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of vascular biomechanics (Laplace's law), anatomy (umbilical cord structure), and physiology (pressure differences between umbilical arteries and vein). The data values are realistic. This criterion is met.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and a clear, formalizable method (area-equivalent radius) to handle the geometric complexities. The objective (classify 2 arteries, 1 vein) is explicit, providing a constraint for the solution. This criterion is met.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All definitions and principles are from established science. This criterion is met.\n4.  **Flaw Check:** The problem exhibits no scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, ambiguity, or other logical flaws listed in the validation checklist.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core principle is that umbilical arteries, operating at higher pressure, will have a larger wall thickness-to-lumen radius ratio ($\\dfrac{t}{r}$) than the umbilical vein. The task is to calculate this ratio for each profile and use it for classification. The problem specifies using an area-equivalent radius, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, to normalize for elliptical cross-sections.\n\nFor an elliptical lumen with semi-axes $a$ and $b$, the area is $A = \\pi a b$. An equivalent circle with radius $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ has the same area, $A = \\pi r_{\\mathrm{eq}}^2$. Therefore, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{a b}$. The semi-axes are half the given diameters, $a = D_1/2$ and $b = D_2/2$. So, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{D_1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{D_2}{2}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{D_1 D_2}}{2}$. For a circular lumen with diameter $D$, the radius is $r = D/2$, which is also the area-equivalent radius.\n\nWe will calculate the ratio $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ for each profile.\n\n**Profile $X$:**\n- Diameters: $D_1 = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $D_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Area-equivalent radius: $r_{\\mathrm{eq},X} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{(1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm})(0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm})}}{2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{1.12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{1.0583\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} \\approx 0.52915\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_X = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_X = \\dfrac{t_X}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},X}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.35\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.52915\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 0.6614$.\n\n**Profile $Y$:**\n- Diameters: $D_1 = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $D_2 = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Area-equivalent radius: $r_{\\mathrm{eq},Y} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{(0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm})(0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm})}}{2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{0.24}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{0.4899\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} \\approx 0.24495\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_Y = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_Y = \\dfrac{t_Y}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},Y}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.24495\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 1.8371$.\n\n**Profile $Z$:**\n- Diameter: $D = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Radius (which is also the area-equivalent radius): $r_{\\mathrm{eq},Z} = \\dfrac{D}{2} = \\dfrac{1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_Z = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_Z = \\dfrac{t_Z}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},Z}} = \\dfrac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.3125$.\n\n**Ranking and Classification:**\nThe calculated ratios are:\n- $R_Y \\approx 1.837$\n- $R_X \\approx 0.661$\n- $R_Z \\approx 0.3125$\n\nOrdering them from highest to lowest: $R_Y > R_X > R_Z$.\nAccording to the biomechanical principle, the two profiles with the highest ratios are the arteries, and the one with the lowest ratio is the vein.\n- **Arteries:** Profiles $Y$ and $X$.\n- **Vein:** Profile $Z$.\n\nA single-threshold decision rule, $R > R^{\\star}$, should separate the arteries from the vein. The threshold $R^{\\star}$ must lie between the lowest artery ratio ($R_X \\approx 0.661$) and the vein ratio ($R_Z = 0.3125$). A robust choice for the threshold would be one that maximizes the separation margin, for instance, by lying in the middle of the gap: $R^{\\star} = \\dfrac{R_X + R_Z}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{0.6614 + 0.3125}{2} = \\dfrac{0.9739}{2} \\approx 0.487$. A value of $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ is a well-justified choice.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$, with $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ the area-equivalent radius of each lumen. Choose a threshold $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ (midway between the closest pair of observed ratios) to maximize separation margin. Classify $X$ and $Y$ as arteries and $Z$ as the vein.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This uses the scientifically justified ratio $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ as directed by the problem's reasoning. This is correct.\n- **Threshold Choice:** The threshold $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ is a reasoned choice, falling in the gap between the artery group and the vein, specifically near the midpoint of the interval $[0.3125, 0.6614]$. This method maximizes the classification margin. This is correct.\n- **Classification:** The classification of $X$ and $Y$ as arteries and $Z$ as the vein matches our derived result. This is correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately specifies the justified ratio, a robust threshold, and the correct final classification, consistent with all problem constraints and principles.\n\n**B. Define $R_D = \\dfrac{t}{D_{\\mathrm{mean}}}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ is the arithmetic mean of measured diameters for each lumen ($D_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\dfrac{D_1 + D_2}{2}$ for elliptical profiles, $D_{\\mathrm{mean}} = D$ for circular). Use a threshold $R_D^{\\star} = 0.35$. Classify $Y$ as an artery and $X$ and $Z$ as veins.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This ratio, $R_D = \\dfrac{t}{D_{\\mathrm{mean}}}$, is not what is suggested by the biomechanical principle ($\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto \\dfrac{Pr}{t}$ which supports a $t/r$ ratio), nor does it adhere to the problem's instruction to use an area-equivalent radius.\n- **Classification:** Let's check the classification with this method.\n  - $R_{D,X} = \\dfrac{0.35}{(1.4+0.8)/2} = \\dfrac{0.35}{1.1} \\approx 0.318$.\n  - $R_{D,Y} = \\dfrac{0.45}{(0.6+0.4)/2} = \\dfrac{0.45}{0.5} = 0.9$.\n  - $R_{D,Z} = \\dfrac{0.25}{1.6} \\approx 0.156$.\n  - Using the threshold $R_D^{\\star} = 0.35$, only profile $Y$ is classified as an artery ($0.9 > 0.35$), while $X$ and $Z$ are classified as veins ($0.318 < 0.35$ and $0.156 < 0.35$). This classification of one artery and two veins contradicts the known anatomy of the umbilical cord (two arteries, one vein).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The ratio definition is less justified than the one based on area equivalence, and the resulting classification is inconsistent with the problem's premise.\n\n**C. Define $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ but choose a conservative threshold $R^{\\star} = 1.0$ to avoid false positives. Classify only $Y$ as an artery and $X$ and $Z$ as veins.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This uses the correct ratio, $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$.\n- **Threshold Choice and Classification:** Using the calculated ratios ($R_Y \\approx 1.837$, $R_X \\approx 0.661$, $R_Z \\approx 0.3125$) and a threshold of $R^{\\star} = 1.0$, profile $Y$ would be classified as an artery, while profiles $X$ and $Z$ would be classified as veins. This again results in a classification of one artery and two veins, which is factually incorrect for the umbilical cord. The threshold, while perhaps \"conservative,\" is not functional as it fails to partition the data according to the known ground truth.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The threshold is poorly chosen, leading to a classification that contradicts the problem statement.\n\n**D. Use the largest-lumen criterion: identify the profile with the largest lumen ($Z$) as the vein and the other two profiles as arteries; ignore wall thickness-to-lumen ratios when deciding.**\n- **Method:** This option explicitly instructs to \"ignore wall thickness-to-lumen ratios\". This is a direct violation of the problem's central task, which is to \"Construct a single-threshold decision rule based on a wall thickness-to-lumen size ratio\". While a common heuristic is that arteries are smaller and thicker-walled than their accompanying veins, and this heuristic would lead to the correct classification here (Lumen area of $Z$ is $\\pi(0.8)^2 = 0.64\\pi \\approx 2.01\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, largest of the three), the method discards the scientific principle and methodology requested.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The proposed method fails to adhere to the explicit instructions and scientific reasoning laid out in the problem statement, even if its resulting classification happens to be correct.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biomechanics, specifically the Law of Laplace for cylindrical vessels. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear objectives. The given values for pressure and radius are physiologically plausible for an umbilical artery.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: first, a derivation of the circumferential wall tension from first principles; second, a numerical calculation of this tension for given parameters; and third, a qualitative explanation of the relationship between wall thickness and wall stress.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Circumferential Wall Tension ($T$)**\n\nWe model a segment of the umbilical artery as a thin-walled cylinder of length $L$ and internal radius $r$. The transmural pressure $P$ is the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the vessel, which acts to expand the vessel. We analyze the forces acting on a longitudinally bisected half of this cylindrical segment, assuming the system is in static mechanical equilibrium.\n\nTwo main forces are at play:\n1.  An outward-directed force, $F_P$, resulting from the transmural pressure $P$ acting on the internal surfaces. For a force balance, we consider the projection of this pressure onto the plane of a bisection. The projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the cylinder's diameter ($2r$) and its length ($L$). The total force pushing the two halves of the cylinder apart is therefore the pressure multiplied by this projected area:\n    $$F_P = P \\times (2rL)$$\n\n2.  A restraining inward-directed force, $F_T$, arising from the circumferential tension in the artery wall. Tension, $T$, is defined as force per unit length. This tension acts along the two cut edges of the wall material. Each cut edge has a length $L$. The total restraining force, which holds the cylinder together, is the tension $T$ multiplied by the total length of the two edges:\n    $$F_T = T \\times (2L)$$\n\nFor the vessel to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_P$ and $F_T$:\n$$P(2rL) = T(2L)$$\nThe terms $2$ and $L$ are present on both sides of the equation and can be canceled, provided $L \\neq 0$. This simplification yields the relationship between tension, pressure, and radius:\n$$T = Pr$$\nThis is the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder. It states that the circumferential wall tension $T$ (force per unit length) is the product of the transmural pressure $P$ and the luminal radius $r$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of Tension**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nTransmural pressure, $P = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\nLuminal radius, $r = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nConversion factor, $1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nTo calculate the tension in SI units ($\\mathrm{N/m}$), we must first convert the given values to base SI units.\nPressure conversion from $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$ or $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$):\n$$P = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} = 7999.32\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 7999.32\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$$\nRadius conversion from millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$r = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula $T = Pr$:\n$$T = (7999.32\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$T = 11.99898\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$T \\approx 12.0\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Explanation of Wall Stress**\n\nCircumferential wall tension, $T$, is the force acting per unit *length* of the vessel wall. In contrast, circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$, is the force acting per unit *cross-sectional area* of the wall material. Let the thickness of the arterial wall (the media and other layers) be denoted by $h$.\n\nThe force that the wall material must withstand is carried by a cross-sectional area of $h \\times L$ along each cut edge. The total force is $F_T = 2TL$. The total area supporting this force is $2hL$. The stress is this force divided by the area over which it acts. A simpler way to view this is to relate stress $\\sigma$ to tension $T$. The tension $T$ (force per unit length) is distributed over the wall thickness $h$.\nTherefore, the average circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{T}{h}$$\nSubstituting our derived result for tension, $T = Pr$, into this equation gives:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{h}$$\nThis final relationship shows that for a constant transmural pressure $P$ and luminal radius $r$, the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ is inversely proportional to the wall thickness $h$. A thicker arterial media means a larger value for $h$. Consequently, a larger $h$ leads to a smaller value for $\\sigma$. This mechanical principle explains how a robust, thick wall allows an artery to withstand high internal pressure; the force is distributed over a larger area of tissue, reducing the stress experienced by the tissue's constituent cells and extracellular matrix, thereby lowering the risk of mechanical failure or rupture. The thick layer of Wharton's jelly surrounding the umbilical vessels also provides external mechanical support, which helps reduce the effective transmural pressure and further limits vessel distension, contributing to the overall stability.",

In this scenario, the external pressure on both the vein and the arteries is the compressive pressure from the knot, $P_e$.\n    Therefore, for any vessel $x \\in \\{v,a\\}$:\n    $$P_{tm,x} = P_{i,x} - P_e$$\n\n2.  **Condition for Collapse (Occlusion)**: The problem states that luminal collapse occurs when \"the magnitude of negative transmural pressure exceeds a vessel-specific critical threshold $P_{\\mathrm{cr},x}$\".\n    A negative transmural pressure, $P_{tm,x}  0$, occurs when $P_e > P_{i,x}$.\n    The magnitude of the negative transmural pressure is $|P_{tm,x}|$. Since $P_{tm,x}$ is negative, this is $|P_{i,x} - P_e| = -(P_{i,x} - P_e) = P_e - P_{i,x}$.\n    The condition for collapse is therefore:\n    $$P_e - P_{i,x} > P_{\\mathrm{cr},x}$$\n    Rearranging this inequality, the condition for the occlusion of vessel $x$ is:\n    $$P_e > P_{i,x} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},x}$$\n    Let us define the total collapse pressure for vessel $x$ as $P_{\\mathrm{collapse},x} = P_{i,x} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},x}$. Thus, occlusion of vessel $x$ occurs when $P_e > P_{\\mathrm{collapse},x}$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Selective Venous Occlusion**: The question asks for the condition under which the vein is occluded but the arteries are not. This requires satisfying two simultaneous conditions:\n    -   The vein is occluded.\n    -   The arteries are not occluded.\n\n    Applying the collapse condition derived above:\n    -   Condition for venous occlusion: $P_e > P_{\\mathrm{collapse},v} = P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$.\n    -   Condition for arterial non-occlusion: The artery does *not* collapse, which is the negation of the collapse condition. The condition for arterial collapse is $P_e > P_{\\mathrm{collapse},a} = P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$. The negation is therefore $P_e \\le P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$.\n\n4.  **Combining the Conditions**: To have venous occlusion *before* arterial occlusion, the external pressure $P_e$ must be in the range that satisfies both conditions:\n    $$P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_e \\le P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$$\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**: For this pressure range to exist, the lower bound must be less than the upper bound:\n    $$P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$$\n    Let's verify this inequality based on the given information.\n    -   We are given $P_{i,v}  P_{i,a}$.\n    -   The critical pressure $P_{\\mathrm{cr},x}$ is related to the vessel's structural resistance to buckling. For a thin-walled cylindrical shell under uniform external pressure, the critical buckling pressure $P_{cr}$ is proportional to the material's stiffness ($E$) and the cube of the thickness-to-radius ratio ($h/r$). A simplified model is $P_{cr} \\propto E (h/r)^3$.\n    -   We are given for the vein versus the artery: $E_v  E_a$, $h_v  h_a$, and $r_v  r_a$.\n    -   This means the ratio $h_v/r_v$ is significantly smaller than $h_a/r_a$.\n    -   Therefore, every factor contributing to $P_{cr}$ is smaller for the vein: its material is less stiff ($E_v  E_a$) and its geometry is far less resistant to buckling ($(h_v/r_v)^3 \\ll (h_a/r_a)^3$).\n    -   Consequently, it is certain that $P_{\\mathrm{cr},v} \\ll P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$.\n    -   Since both $P_{i,v}  P_{i,a}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$, their sum must also satisfy the inequality: $P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$.\n    -   This confirms that a non-empty range for $P_e$ exists, and the physical premise of the problem is sound: the vein, being more compliant and having lower internal pressure, will indeed collapse at a lower external pressure than the arteries.\n\nThe derived condition for selective venous occlusion is $P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_e \\le P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$. We now evaluate the options based on this result.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}  P_e  P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$**\nThis inequality states that the external pressure $P_e$ is greater than the collapse threshold for the vein ($P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$) and less than the collapse threshold for the artery ($P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$). This correctly identifies the range where the vein is occluded but the artery is not. The use of a strict inequality on the upper bound ($$) instead of less-than-or-equal-to ($\\le$) is a minor distinction common in multiple-choice questions and does not alter the fundamental correctness of the physical range being described. This option accurately captures the derived condition.\nThis option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. $P_e  P_{i,v}$ and $P_e  P_{i,a}$**\nThis expression can be written as $P_{i,v}  P_e  P_{i,a}$. This condition only considers the internal pressures. It posits that a vessel collapses as soon as the external pressure exceeds the internal pressure ($P_e  P_i$). This is fundamentally incorrect because it entirely neglects the structural integrity of the vessel wall, which provides resistance to collapse. The critical pressure terms, $P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$, which represent this structural resistance, are missing.\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}  P_e  P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$**\nThis inequality is the reverse of the correct relationship. As established in our consistency check, the total collapse pressure for the artery is greater than that of the vein: $P_{i,a} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}  P_{i,v} + P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$. Therefore, the interval defined by this option is empty; no value of $P_e$ can simultaneously be greater than a larger number and smaller than a smaller number. This describes an impossible condition.\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $P_e  \\max\\!\\left(P_{i,v},\\,P_{i,a}\\right)$**\nGiven that $P_{i,a}  P_{i,v}$, this condition simplifies to $P_e  P_{i,a}$. This inequality states that the external pressure must be greater than the internal arterial pressure. While this is a necessary condition for arterial collapse to even be possible (i.e., for $P_{tm,a}$ to be negative), it is not a sufficient condition for collapse, as it ignores the critical pressure $P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$. More importantly, it does not define a condition for *selective venous occlusion*. A pressure $P_e$ in this range could be high enough to occlude both vessels, or neither, depending on the magnitudes of $P_{\\mathrm{cr},v}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{cr},a}$. It fails to describe the specific range where only the vein is occluded.\nThis option is **Incorrect**.",
