            "problem": "A laboratory that routinely performs intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) wishes to formalize its internal quality assessment by predicting the probability of post-ICSI fertilization, denoted $p_f$, and the probability that a fertilized oocyte will progress to a competent embryo (for example, blastocyst stage with normal morphology and euploid likelihood), denoted $p_b$. As a starting point, use the following foundational framework based on fundamental cell biology and reproductive physiology. In ICSI, a single sperm is microinjected through the oolemma directly into the oocyte cytoplasm, bypassing zona pellucida binding and acrosomal reactions. Successful activation depends on the delivery of sperm-specific Phospholipase C zeta ($\\text{PLC}\\zeta$), propagation of cytosolic calcium oscillations ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ waves) over the endoplasmic reticulum network, and subsequent oolemma resealing, cortical granule exocytosis, and pronuclear formation. Embryo competence depends on the oocyte’s cytoplasmic maturity, including properly distributed endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria with adequate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) output, balanced reactive oxygen species (ROS), functional cytoskeleton, and appropriate stores of maternal transcripts and proteins.\n\nConsider three oocyte dysmorphisms observed at denudation prior to ICSI: cytoplasmic vacuoles, a large perivitelline space (PVS), and dark cytoplasm (coarse granularity and hyperpigmentation). You are asked to reason from the above base to trace plausible causal pathways from each dysmorphism to $p_f$ and $p_b$, explicitly considering intermediate states such as $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ wave propagation, mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox balance, and cortical granule distribution.\n\nWhich option most plausibly characterizes the direction and relative magnitude of impact of these dysmorphisms on $p_f$ and $p_b$ under ICSI conditions?\n\nA. Vacuoles predominantly reduce $p_f$ by perturbing oolemma fusion and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling, with a secondary reduction in $p_b$; dark cytoplasm predominantly reduces $p_b$ via mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS, with a modest effect on $p_f$; large PVS has minimal effect on $p_f$ in ICSI and a small downstream effect on $p_b$ through altered cortical granule distribution and cytoplasmic maturity.\n\nB. Dark cytoplasm primarily reduces $p_f$ because heavy lipid content prevents sperm decondensation, vacuoles have negligible impact, and large PVS dramatically reduces $p_f$ by blocking sperm penetration.\n\nC. Large PVS and vacuoles both improve $p_f$ by increasing cytoplasmic fluidity and “storage capacity,” while dark cytoplasm improves $p_b$ by providing extra energy reserves.\n\nD. All three dysmorphisms equivalently reduce $p_f$ but do not affect $p_b$ because after ICSI embryo competence is determined solely by the paternal genome.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and objectivity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n-   **Probabilities of interest**: $p_f$, the probability of post-ICSI fertilization; $p_b$, the probability that a fertilized oocyte progresses to a competent embryo.\n-   **Procedure**: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which bypasses zona pellucida binding and acrosomal reactions.\n-   **Framework for Fertilization ($p_f$)**: Success depends on:\n    1.  Delivery of sperm-specific Phospholipase C zeta ($\\text{PLC}\\zeta$).\n    2.  Propagation of cytosolic calcium oscillations ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ waves) over the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network.\n    3.  Oolemma resealing, cortical granule exocytosis, and pronuclear formation.\n-   **Framework for Embryo Competence ($p_b$)**: Depends on oocyte's cytoplasmic maturity, including:\n    1.  Properly distributed ER.\n    2.  Mitochondria with adequate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) output.\n    3.  Balanced reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n    4.  Functional cytoskeleton.\n    5.  Appropriate stores of maternal transcripts and proteins.\n-   **Oocyte Dysmorphisms**:\n    1.  Cytoplasmic vacuoles.\n    2.  A large perivitelline space (PVS).\n    3.  Dark cytoplasm (coarse granularity and hyperpigmentation).\n-   **Task**: To trace plausible causal pathways from each dysmorphism to its effects on $p_f$ and $p_b$ based on the provided framework and intermediate states ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ waves, mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox balance, cortical granule distribution).\n-   **Question**: Identify the option that most plausibly characterizes the direction and relative magnitude of impact of these dysmorphisms on $p_f$ and $p_b$ under ICSI conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of reproductive cell biology and assisted reproductive technology. The descriptions of ICSI, oocyte activation via the $\\text{PLC}\\zeta$-$\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ pathway, and the requirements for embryonic developmental competence are all standard and factually correct representations of the current scientific understanding. The listed dysmorphisms are well-documented in clinical embryology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a qualitative, deductive reasoning process based on a given set of biological principles and initial conditions. It seeks the \"most plausible\" outcome, which is a standard assessment in complex biological systems where multiple factors are at play. A unique, most-likely answer can be reasoned from the provided premises.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased scientific language. It defines its terms and sets up a clear logical task without resorting to subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides a sufficient framework to derive a logical conclusion. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to deduce the most likely effects of three oocyte dysmorphisms on the probabilities of fertilization ($p_f$) and competent embryo development ($p_b$) following ICSI, based on the provided biological framework.\n\n**1. Analysis of Cytoplasmic Vacuoles**\n\n-   **Nature**: Vacuoles are fluid-filled sacs that displace the normal cytoplasm. Their presence often indicates cellular stress, autophagy, or degenerative processes. They represent a significant disruption to the oocyte's cytoarchitecture.\n-   **Impact on $p_f$ (Fertilization)**: The fertilization process relies on the propagation of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ waves across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. Large or numerous vacuoles can physically displace or fragment the ER network, thereby impairing or blocking the propagation of these essential $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillations. A failure in the $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling cascade leads to a failure of oocyte activation, directly and significantly reducing $p_f$. Vacuoles near the cortex can also interfere with oolemma resealing post-injection or disrupt the organized exocytosis of cortical granules, both of which are components of successful activation. The primary impact is thus on the structural integrity required for signaling, which is essential for fertilization.\n-   **Impact on $p_b$ (Embryo Competence)**: Embryo competence depends on a healthy cytoplasm with functional organelles. Vacuoles indicate a compromised cytoplasm. By displacing organelles like mitochondria and disrupting the cytoskeleton, they can lead to lower total ATP production and faulty cell divisions (cleavage) after fertilization. This represents a general reduction in oocyte quality that negatively impacts its developmental potential, thus reducing $p_b$. This effect is a downstream consequence of the poor cellular health indicated by the vacuoles.\n-   **Conclusion**: Vacuoles are expected to have a primary, strong negative impact on $p_f$ by disrupting the signaling apparatus for activation, and a secondary negative impact on $p_b$ due to generalized cytoplasmic compromise.\n\n**2. Analysis of Dark Cytoplasm (Coarse Granularity)**\n\n-   **Nature**: This appearance is typically associated with an unusually high density of organelles, particularly mitochondria and smooth ER, and/or an accumulation of lipid droplets. While it may seem like an abundance of resources, it is clinically correlated with metabolic stress.\n-   **Impact on $p_f$ (Fertilization)**: The effect on fertilization is not as direct as with vacuoles. The core machinery for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling might be intact or even hyper-abundant (more SER). Thus, a major disruption of fertilization is not the most direct consequence. Any effect would be secondary to general cellular dysfunction. Clinical data often show that fertilization rates for such oocytes are not drastically reduced.\n-   **Impact on $p_b$ (Embryo Competence)**: This is where the primary impact is expected. The problem statement links $p_b$ directly to \"mitochondria with adequate ATP output\" and \"balanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)\". Dark, granular cytoplasm is a strong indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction. Such mitochondria may be numerous but inefficient, producing less ATP and generating higher levels of ROS. Insufficient ATP compromises the high energy demands of embryonic cleavage and blastulation. High ROS causes oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to developmental arrest. Therefore, dark cytoplasm points directly to a failure in the metabolic requirements for embryo competence, leading to a predominant and strong reduction in $p_b$.\n-   **Conclusion**: Dark cytoplasm is expected to have a primary, strong negative impact on $p_b$ by indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, with a more modest or secondary effect on $p_f$.\n\n**3. Analysis of a Large Perivitelline Space (PVS)**\n\n-   **Nature**: The PVS is the space between the cell membrane (oolemma) and the zona pellucida. A large PVS may result from oocyte shrinkage (due to osmotic stress or cytoskeletal issues) or be a feature of post-maturity.\n-   **Impact on $p_f$ (Fertilization)**: In ICSI, the injection pipette mechanically penetrates the zona pellucida and the oolemma, delivering the sperm directly into the cytoplasm. The size of the PVS is therefore largely irrelevant to the physical act of sperm delivery and the initiation of activation by $\\text{PLC}\\zeta$. It does not pose a physical barrier to the critical steps of ICSI. Therefore, a large PVS is expected to have a minimal, if any, direct effect on $p_f$.\n-   **Impact on $p_b$ (Embryo Competence)**: While not directly affecting fertilization, a large PVS can be an indirect indicator of compromised oocyte quality. It can be a sign of post-maturity or suboptimal cytoplasmic maturation. The problem mentions that phenomena like altered cortical granule distribution can be linked to cytoplasmic maturity. Such subtle defects in maturation, which a large PVS may signify, can translate to a reduced ability to support embryonic development. The impact on $p_b$ would therefore be downstream and likely small compared to the more severe defects indicated by vacuoles or dark cytoplasm.\n-   **Conclusion**: A large PVS is expected to have minimal impact on $p_f$ under ICSI conditions, but may be associated with a small, indirect negative effect on $p_b$ as a marker for suboptimal cytoplasmic maturity.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Vacuoles predominantly reduce $p_f$ by perturbing oolemma fusion and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling, with a secondary reduction in $p_b$; dark cytoplasm predominantly reduces $p_b$ via mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS, with a modest effect on $p_f$; large PVS has minimal effect on $p_f$ in ICSI and a small downstream effect on $p_b$ through altered cortical granule distribution and cytoplasmic maturity.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the detailed analysis above. It correctly identifies the primary mechanisms and relative impacts for each dysmorphism: vacuoles affect structural integrity for fertilization ($p_f$); dark cytoplasm affects metabolic competence for development ($p_b$); and large PVS is largely bypassed by ICSI, acting only as a weak indicator for developmental potential ($p_b$).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Dark cytoplasm primarily reduces $p_f$ because heavy lipid content prevents sperm decondensation, vacuoles have negligible impact, and large PVS dramatically reduces $p_f$ by blocking sperm penetration.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The claim that vacuoles have \"negligible impact\" is false; they are a major negative prognostic factor. The claim that a large PVS \"dramatically reduces $p_f$ by blocking sperm penetration\" is incorrect for ICSI, where the PVS is physically bypassed by the injection pipette. The primary impact of dark cytoplasm is on $p_b$ (development), not $p_f$ (fertilization).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Large PVS and vacuoles both improve $p_f$ by increasing cytoplasmic fluidity and “storage capacity,” while dark cytoplasm improves $p_b$ by providing extra energy reserves.**\nThis option is biologically nonsensical. All three listed dysmorphisms are well-established negative indicators of oocyte quality. Vacuoles represent degeneration, not useful \"storage.\" Dark cytoplasm indicates metabolic stress and dysfunction, not healthy \"extra energy reserves.\" There is no scientific basis to claim these pathologies are beneficial.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. All three dysmorphisms equivalently reduce $p_f$ but do not affect $p_b$ because after ICSI embryo competence is determined solely by the paternal genome.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. First, the dysmorphisms act through different mechanisms, so it is implausible they would have an \"equivalent\" impact. Second, the claim that embryo competence is \"solely determined by the paternal genome\" is a gross oversimplification and factually wrong. Early embryonic development is critically dependent on the maternal contribution stored in the oocyte's cytoplasm (mitochondria, mRNA, proteins), as correctly stated in the problem's premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Vacuoles primarily increase polyspermy risk in ICSI, thereby lowering $p_f$ but not $p_b$.**\nThis statement reflects a profound misunderstanding of the ICSI procedure. ICSI involves the injection of a single sperm, making polyspermy (fertilization by multiple sperm) virtually impossible. Polyspermy is a concern in conventional in-vitro fertilization (IVF), not ICSI. Furthermore, the logic that polyspermy lowers $p_f$ but not $p_b$ is contradictory; a polyspermic zygote is not a \"competent embryo,\" so $p_b$ would be zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe verbatim data provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n- **Procedure:** Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) on metaphase II oocytes.\n- **Concurrent Conditions:**\n    - Culture medium osmolarity: $O_{\\text{med}} = 240$ mOsm/kg.\n    - Stage temperature: $T = 34^\\circ$C.\n    - ICSI pipette inner diameter: $p = 7$ µm.\n    - Injection volume fraction: $V_{\\text{inj}}/V_{\\text{oocyte}} = 0.08$.\n    - Aspiration pressure: $P_{\\text{asp}} = 60$ kPa.\n    - Injection system: Piezo-actuated, minimal amplitude setting.\n- **Observed Complications:**\n    - Oocyte $1$: Rapid global ooplasm clearing and fragmentation within seconds of injection (oocyte lysis).\n    - Oocyte $2$: Persistent cytoplasmic leakage from the injection site after pipette withdrawal.\n    - Oocyte $3$: Repeated attempts to puncture the oolemma fail; the ooplasm displaces, the oolemma dimples, but no rupture occurs (failed oolemma rupture).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated for scientific soundness, well-posedness, and objectivity.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is set within the real-world context of assisted reproductive technology. The described complications (lysis, leakage, puncture failure) are well-documented procedural risks in ICSI. The parameters provided are all critical variables in the ICSI process.\n    - **Osmolarity ($O_{\\text{med}} = 240$ mOsm/kg):** Standard physiological osmolarity for human cells is approximately $280-300$ mOsm/kg. A medium with $240$ mOsm/kg is significantly hypoosmotic, a condition known to induce osmotic stress and cell swelling. This is a scientifically plausible but non-ideal condition.\n    - **Temperature ($T = 34^\\circ$C):** The standard incubation temperature is $37^\\circ$C. A temperature of $34^\\circ$C is suboptimal and known to affect membrane fluidity and enzymatic processes, which is a plausible experimental variable or error.\n    - **Pipette Diameter ($p = 7$ µm):** Typical ICSI pipette inner diameters range from $4-6$ µm. A diameter of $7$ µm is large but within the realm of possibility for a manufactured or custom pipette, representing an \"oversized\" condition.\n    - **Injection Volume ($V_{\\text{inj}}/V_{\\text{oocyte}} = 0.08$):** An injection of $8\\%$ of the oocyte's total volume is extremely large. A typical human oocyte volume is $\\approx 0.5$ nL, so an injected volume of $\\approx 40$ pL is massive compared to the standard $1-2$ pL. This represents a severe mechanical insult.\n    - The combination of these non-ideal parameters does not violate fundamental physical laws but rather describes a scenario of poor laboratory practice, which forms a coherent basis for a problem about identifying procedural errors. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem provides a clear set of conditions and a clear set of observations. It asks for the most appropriate causal link between them based on scientific principles. This is a well-posed problem in biophysics and cell biology. The language is objective and technical.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **Valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on objective, quantifiable parameters. The scenario describes a set of plausible technical errors leading to known complications, making it a suitable problem for analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires linking the given abiotic conditions to the three distinct biological outcomes using principles of biophysics.\n\n**Analysis of Causal Factors:**\n1.  **Hypoosmotic Stress:** The culture medium osmolarity is $O_{\\text{med}} = 240$ mOsm/kg, which is significantly lower than the oocyte's intracellular osmolarity ($\\approx 280-300$ mOsm/kg). This creates an osmotic gradient that drives water into the oocyte, causing it to swell. According to the Law of Laplace for a spherical shell, the membrane tension ($\\sigma$) is proportional to the internal pressure difference ($\\Delta P$) and radius ($R$), $\\Delta P = 2\\sigma/R$. As the oocyte swells, its radius increases and its membrane is stretched, leading to elevated baseline membrane tension. This pre-stresses the oolemma, making it more vulnerable to rupture.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Stress from Injection:** The injection of a volume fraction of $V_{\\text{inj}}/V_{\\text{oocyte}} = 0.08$ represents a sudden and large increase in intracellular volume. This causes a rapid spike in internal hydrostatic pressure and a corresponding drastic increase in membrane tension, further stretching the oolemma toward its lytic limit.\n\n3.  **Wound Size and Resealing:** A large ICSI pipette with an inner diameter of $p = 7$ µm will create a larger perforation in the oolemma than a standard pipette. The cell's ability to reseal membrane wounds is a finite, calcium-dependent process involving the formation of a patch vesicle or cytoskeletal contraction. A defect that is too large can overwhelm this repair mechanism, resulting in a failure to reseal and consequent leakage of cytoplasm.\n\n4.  **Membrane Mechanics and Puncture:** The temperature of $T = 34^\\circ$C is below the physiological optimum of $37^\\circ$C. Lower temperatures decrease the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, which can increase its stiffness and resistance to deformation and puncture. The piezo-actuated injection system, when set to a \"minimal amplitude,\" delivers a low amount of mechanical energy. To successfully puncture the oolemma, the applied force from the pipette tip must exceed the membrane's local rupture strength.\n\n**Evaluation of Complications:**\n\n- **Oocyte $1$ (Lysis):** The lysis is best explained by the combination of two severe stressors. First, the oocyte is already osmotically swollen and its membrane is under high tension due to the hypoosmotic medium ($O_{\\text{med}} = 240$ mOsm/kg). Second, the injection of a massive volume ($V_{\\text{inj}}/V_{\\text{oocyte}} = 0.08$) provides the final, catastrophic tensile stress that pushes the membrane tension far beyond its lytic limit, causing it to rupture completely.\n\n- **Oocyte $2$ (Leakage):** The persistent leakage is a direct consequence of a failure in membrane resealing. The most direct cause for this among the given parameters is the oversized pipette ($p = 7$ µm), which creates a large defect in the oolemma that the cell's repair machinery cannot close effectively or quickly enough. The slightly elevated internal pressure from osmotic swelling would further promote the extrusion of cytoplasm through this unsealed wound.\n\n- **Oocyte $3$ (Failed Rupture):** The failure to puncture the oolemma despite repeated attempts points to an imbalance between the membrane's resistance to rupture and the applied force. The minimal setting on the piezo-actuator provides insufficient force. This is likely compounded by the lower temperature ($T = 34^\\circ$C), which can make the membrane stiffer and thus more resistant to puncture by a low-energy impulse. The oolemma deforms elastically (\"dimples\") but the energy delivered is not sufficient to initiate fracture.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Oocyte $1$ lysis: hypoosmotic swelling elevates membrane tension at the moment of a relatively large-volume injection, precipitating catastrophic rupture; Oocyte $2$ leakage: oversized pipette aperture produces a large defect that fails to reseal promptly; Oocyte $3$ failed oolemma rupture: insufficient piezo impulse at low amplitude prevents surpassing the rupture threshold of a stiffened membrane at lower temperature.**\n- This option correctly identifies the primary causes for all three events, drawing directly from the provided data. It links lysis to hypoosmolarity and large injection volume. It links leakage to the oversized pipette. It links puncture failure to the minimal piezo setting and lower temperature. This explanation is fully consistent with the biophysical principles discussed.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Oocyte $1$ lysis: hyperosmotic shrinkage makes the membrane brittle and prone to immediate lysis; Oocyte $2$ leakage: too small pipette inner diameter creates an ultrafine defect that preferentially leaks; Oocyte $3$ failed oolemma rupture: elevated temperature increases membrane fluidity and prevents rupture.**\n- The premise for Oocyte $1$ is factually incorrect; the medium is hypoosmotic ($240$ mOsm/kg), not hyperosmotic.\n- The premise for Oocyte $2$ is factually incorrect; the pipette is large ($7$ µm), not small, and larger defects are more prone to leakage.\n- The premise for Oocyte $3$ is factually incorrect; the temperature is low ($34^\\circ$C), not elevated.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Oocyte $1$ lysis: injection too close to the meiotic spindle causes cytoskeletal collapse leading to lysis; Oocyte $2$ leakage: residual cumulus cells on the oolemma distort the aperture and promote extrusions; Oocyte $3$ failed oolemma rupture: absence of zona pellucida increases membrane compliance and prevents rupture.**\n- These explanations invoke conditions not mentioned in the problem statement (injection location, cumulus cells, absent zona). The provided quantitative data (osmolarity, pipette size, volume, temperature) offer more direct and sufficient explanations. Therefore, these are less appropriate causal links.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Oocyte $1$ lysis: mineral oil overlay toxicity causing immediate membrane dissolution; Oocyte $2$ leakage: high viscosity of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution drives cytoplasm out; Oocyte $3$ failed oolemma rupture: incorrect medium pH prevents the oolemma from rupturing mechanically.**\n- These explanations also introduce factors (oil toxicity, PVP viscosity, pH) that are not provided in the problem statement. The given parameters offer a complete etiological picture for the observed outcomes, making these alternative explanations speculative and less direct.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The probability of success in any given trial is $p_s(a)$. The number of trials, $N$, required to get the first success follows a geometric distribution. The expected value, $E[N]$, for a geometric distribution with success probability $p_s$ is given by:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{1}{p_s}$$\nThis represents the expected number of oocytes that must be retrieved to obtain one euploid blastocyst.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the formula to each age group.**\n\n*   **For Maternal Age 32:**\n    $$p_s(32) = 0.80 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.55 \\times 0.50 = 0.165$$\n    $$E[N(32)] = \\frac{1}{0.165} = \\frac{1}{165/1000} = \\frac{1000}{165} = \\frac{200}{33}$$\n\n*   **For Maternal Age 38:**\n    $$p_s(38) = 0.78 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.30 = 0.0819$$\n    $$E[N(38)] = \\frac{1}{0.0819} = \\frac{1}{819/10000} = \\frac{10000}{819}$$\n\n*   **For Maternal Age 42:**\n    $$p_s(42) = 0.75 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.40 \\times 0.15 = 0.02925$$\n    $$E[N(42)] = \\frac{1}{0.02925} = \\frac{1}{2925/100000} = \\frac{100000}{2925} = \\frac{4000}{117}$$\n\nThe expected numbers of retrieved oocytes required to obtain one euploid blastocyst for maternal ages 32, 38, and 42 are $\\frac{200}{33}$, $\\frac{10000}{819}$, and $\\frac{4000}{117}$, respectively. These values will be presented in a row matrix as requested.",
