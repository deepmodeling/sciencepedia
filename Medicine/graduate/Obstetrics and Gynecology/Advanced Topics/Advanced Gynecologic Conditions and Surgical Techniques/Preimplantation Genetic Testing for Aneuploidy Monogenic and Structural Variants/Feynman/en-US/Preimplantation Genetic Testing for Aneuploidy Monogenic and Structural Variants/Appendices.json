The validated assay performance for their laboratory is sensitivity $0.95$ and specificity $0.98$.

Express both posterior probabilities as decimals, and round each to four significant figures. Provide both numbers in the final answer as a single row matrix.",
            "solution": "We are asked to calculate the posterior probability that an embryo is aneuploid given that it received a \"euploid\" test result, for two different prior probabilities of aneuploidy. This is a problem of conditional probability.\n\nLet us define the events:\n$A$: The event that the embryo is truly aneuploid.\n$E$: The event that the embryo is truly euploid.\n$T_A$: The event that the assay returns an \"aneuploid\" call.\n$T_E$: The event that the assay returns a \"euploid\" call.\n\nThe events $A$ and $E$ form a partition of the sample space, meaning an embryo is either aneuploid or euploid. Thus, $E = A^c$ and $P(E) = 1 - P(A)$. Similarly, the test results $T_A$ and $T_E$ are mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\nThe sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test (aneuploid call) given the condition is present (embryo is aneuploid).\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T_A | A) = 0.95 $$\nThe specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test (euploid call) given the condition is absent (embryo is euploid).\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T_E | E) = 0.98 $$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the posterior probability $P(A | T_E)$, the probability that the embryo is aneuploid given a \"euploid\" test result.\n\nAccording to the core definition of conditional probability,\n$$ P(A | T_E) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T_E)}{P(T_E)} $$\n\nWe must derive expressions for the numerator, $P(A \\cap T_E)$, and the denominator, $P(T_E)$, using the given information.\n\nFor the numerator, we can again use the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(T_E | A) = \\frac{P(T_E \\cap A)}{P(A)} $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ P(A \\cap T_E) = P(T_E | A) P(A) $$\nThe term $P(T_E | A)$ is the probability of a \"euploid\" call for an aneuploid embryo. This is the false negative rate. Since the test call can only be \"aneuploid\" or \"euploid\", we have $P(T_A | A) + P(T_E | A) = 1$.\nTherefore,\n$$ P(T_E | A) = 1 - P(T_A | A) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\nSo, the numerator is $P(A \\cap T_E) = (0.05) P(A)$.\n\nFor the denominator, $P(T_E)$, we use the Law of Total Probability. The event $T_E$ can be partitioned based on the true state of the embryo, which is either aneuploid ($A$) or euploid ($E$).\n$$ P(T_E) = P(T_E \\cap A) + P(T_E \\cap E) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$ P(T_E) = P(T_E | A) P(A) + P(T_E | E) P(E) $$\nWe have all the necessary components for this expression:\n$P(T_E | A) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 0.05$\n$P(A)$ is the prior probability of aneuploidy.\n$P(T_E | E) = \\text{Specificity} = 0.98$\n$P(E) = 1 - P(A)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T_E)$:\n$$ P(T_E) = (0.05) P(A) + (0.98) (1 - P(A)) $$\n\nNow we can assemble the final expression for our desired posterior probability, $P(A | T_E)$:\n$$ P(A | T_E) = \\frac{P(T_E | A) P(A)}{P(T_E | A) P(A) + P(T_E | E) (1 - P(A))} $$\n$$ P(A | T_E) = \\frac{(0.05) P(A)}{(0.05) P(A) + (0.98) (1 - P(A))} $$\n\nNow we can compute the value for each of the two cases.\n\nCase 1: Prior probability of aneuploidy is $P_1(A) = 0.4$.\nThe corresponding prior probability of being euploid is $P_1(E) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.\nSubstituting $P_1(A) = 0.4$ into the derived formula:\n$$ P_1(A | T_E) = \\frac{(0.05)(0.4)}{(0.05)(0.4) + (0.98)(1 - 0.4)} $$\n$$ P_1(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.02}{0.02 + (0.98)(0.6)} $$\n$$ P_1(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.588} $$\n$$ P_1(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.02}{0.608} $$\n$$ P_1(A | T_E) \\approx 0.032894753... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.03289$.\n\nCase 2: Prior probability of aneuploidy is $P_2(A) = 0.2$.\nThe corresponding prior probability of being euploid is $P_2(E) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\nSubstituting $P_2(A) = 0.2$ into the derived formula:\n$$ P_2(A | T_E) = \\frac{(0.05)(0.2)}{(0.05)(0.2) + (0.98)(1 - 0.2)} $$\n$$ P_2(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.01}{0.01 + (0.98)(0.8)} $$\n$$ P_2(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.784} $$\n$$ P_2(A | T_E) = \\frac{0.01}{0.794} $$\n$$ P_2(A | T_E) \\approx 0.012594458... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.01259$.\n\nThe two posterior probabilities are approximately $0.03289$ and $0.01259$.",

Consider a patient with three cryopreserved blastocysts, each to be transferred singly in a fresh attempt if available, with transfer ceasing immediately upon the first live birth. The three embryos are:\n- Embryo $1$: PGT-A euploid, morphology grade BB; per-transfer live birth probability $p_{1} = 0.55$.\n- Embryo $2$: PGT-A mosaic monosomy $7$ with $0.20$ mosaic fraction, morphology grade AA; per-transfer live birth probability $p_{2} = 0.45$.\n- Embryo $3$: PGT-SR segmental duplication of length $5$ megabases present in a mosaic state with $0.40$ mosaic fraction, morphology grade AB; per-transfer live birth probability $p_{3} = 0.35$.\n\nAssume the following foundational conditions, grounded in standard clinical modeling:\n- Each embryo’s live birth outcome upon transfer is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p_{i}$, independent across embryos.\n- Only one embryo is transferred per attempt.\n- If a transfer fails, there is a probability $d = 0.25$ that the couple discontinues treatment before attempting the next transfer; with probability $1-d$ they continue.

The success probability for the embryo in the $j$-th position of the sequence is $p_{i_j}$. The probability of a couple discontinuing treatment after a failed transfer is $d$, and the probability of continuing is $c = 1-d$.\n\nThe cumulative probability of at least one live birth, denoted by $P(\\sigma)$, is the sum of probabilities of the mutually exclusive events of achieving a first live birth at each transfer attempt.\nLet $E_j$ be the event that the first live birth occurs on the $j$-th transfer.\n\n1.  The probability of a live birth on the first transfer is the success probability of the first embryo in the sequence, $p_{i_1}$.\n    $$P(E_1) = p_{i_1}$$\n\n2.  For a live birth to occur for the first time on the second transfer, the first transfer must fail (with probability $1-p_{i_1}$), the couple must continue treatment (with probability $c=1-d$), and the second transfer must succeed (with probability $p_{i_2}$).\n    $$P(E_2) = (1-p_{i_1}) c p_{i_2}$$\n\n3.

We can determine the optimal ordering by a general principle without calculating all $3! = 6$ permutations. Consider any sequence $\\sigma'$ that contains an adjacent pair of embryos $(i_k, i_{k+1})$ not in descending order of success probability, i.e., $p_{i_k} < p_{i_{k+1}}$. Let us form a new sequence $\\sigma$ by swapping this pair to $(i_{k+1}, i_k)$. All other embryos remain in their original positions.\n\nThe total probability $P(\\sigma)$ can be written as the sum of contributions from transfers up to $k-1$, the contribution from transfers $k$ and $k+1$, and the contribution from transfers after $k+1$. The initial and final parts of the sequence are identical for $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma'$. The factor representing the probability of having failed and continued up to the $k$-th transfer, let's call it $F_{k-1}$, is also identical for both sequences. Therefore, to determine which sequence yields a higher overall probability, we only need to compare the sum of probabilities of success at steps $k$ and $k+1$, conditioned on reaching step $k$.\n\nFor the order $(\\dots, i_k, i_{k+1}, \\dots)$, the contribution from these two steps is $p_{i_k} + c(1-p_{i_k})p_{i_{k+1}}$.\nFor the order $(\\dots, i_{k+1}, i_k, \\dots)$, the contribution is $p_{i_{k+1}} + c(1-p_{i_{k+1}})p_{i_k}$.\n\nLet's compare these two quantities. Let $\\Delta$ be their difference:\n$$\\Delta = \\left[ p_{i_{k+1}} + c(1-p_{i_{k+1}})p_{i_k} \\right] - \\left[ p_{i_k} + c(1-p_{i_k})p_{i_{k+1}} \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta = p_{i_{k+1}} + c p_{i_k} - c p_{i_k} p_{i_{k+1}} - p_{i_k} - c p_{i_{k+1}} + c p_{i_k} p_{i_{k+1}}$$\n$$\\Delta = (p_{i_{k+1}} - p_{i_k}) - c(p_{i_{k+1}} - p_{i_k})$$\n$$\\Delta = (1-c)(p_{i_{k+1}} - p_{i_k})$$\nGiven $d=0.25$, we have $c = 1-d = 0.75$. Thus, $1-c = 0.25$, which is a positive constant. The sign of $\\Delta$ is therefore the same as the sign of $(p_{i_{k+1}} - p_{i_k})$.\n\nIf $p_{i_{k+1}} > p_{i_k}$, then $\\Delta > 0$. This means swapping the pair $(i_k, i_{k+1})$ to $(i_{k+1}, i_k)$ increases the total cumulative probability of live birth. This logic applies to any adjacent pair in the sequence. Any sequence that is not in descending order of success probability can be improved by swapping an incorrectly ordered adjacent pair. The only sequence that cannot be improved is the one where all embryos are ordered from highest success probability to lowest. This greedy strategy is therefore optimal.\n\nThe given probabilities are:\n- Embryo $1$: $p_1 = 0.55$\n- Embryo $2$: $p_2 = 0.45$\n- Embryo $3$: $p_3 = 0.35$\n\nOrdering these probabilities in descending order gives $p_1 > p_2 > p_3$.\nTherefore, the optimal transfer order $\\sigma^{\\star}$ is to transfer Embryo $1$, then Embryo $2$ if the first attempt fails, and finally Embryo $3$ if the first two attempts fail. The sequence of indices is $(1, 2, 3)$.\n\nThe question requests this optimal order be expressed as a row matrix of indices.\n$$\\sigma^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$$",
