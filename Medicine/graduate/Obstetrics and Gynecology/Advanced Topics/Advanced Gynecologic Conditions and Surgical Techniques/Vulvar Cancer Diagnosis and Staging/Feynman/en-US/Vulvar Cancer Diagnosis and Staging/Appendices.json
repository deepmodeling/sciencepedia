            "problem": "A histopathology laboratory is validating how to compute depth of invasion for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma using printed micrographs that include an internal scale bar. Consider a resection specimen from a primary vulvar lesion that is clinically confined to the vulva with no clinical or radiologic evidence of regional lymph node involvement. On the hematoxylin and eosin section, the epithelial surface over the tumor is ulcerated. Following the accepted pathological definition, depth of invasion (DOI) is defined as the perpendicular distance from the epithelial–stromal junction at the most superficial adjacent dermal papilla (i.e., the original basement membrane level next to the ulcer) down to the deepest point of invasive tumor.\n\nA calibrated micrograph is printed on paper. The printed internal scale bar labeled \"$200~\\mu\\text{m}$\" measures $16~\\text{mm}$ when measured on the print with a ruler. On the same print, the measured perpendicular distance from the epithelial–stromal junction at the most superficial adjacent dermal papilla to the deepest invasive tumor nest is $72~\\text{mm}$. Assume the print magnification is isotropic and the scale bar is accurate.\n\nUsing only the definition of depth of invasion and the principle that a uniform magnification scales all linear dimensions by the same factor, compute the actual depth of invasion in millimeters. Then, based solely on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2021 criteria for tumors confined to the vulva or perineum, determine whether the lesion is stage IA (depth of invasion $\\leq 1~\\text{mm}$) or stage IB (depth of invasion $> 1~\\text{mm}$).\n\nRound your computed depth of invasion to four significant figures and express it in millimeters. Your final answer should be only the numerical value of the depth of invasion.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information and definitions to compute the depth of invasion and determine the corresponding pathological stage based on established medical criteria.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying this calculation is that a micrograph represents a uniformly scaled version of the actual tissue specimen. This implies the existence of a single, constant magnification factor, $M$, that relates any length measured on the printed micrograph, $L_{print}$, to its corresponding actual length, $L_{actual}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{print}}{L_{actual}}$$\nThis relationship holds for all linear dimensions, assuming isotropic magnification as stated in the problem.\n\nWe can determine the magnification factor $M$ using the provided internal scale bar. Let $L_{scale, actual}$ be the actual length that the scale bar represents, and let $L_{scale, print}$ be the length of the scale bar as measured on the printed micrograph with a ruler.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The actual length represented by the scale bar: $L_{scale, actual} = 200~\\mu\\text{m}$\n- The measured length of the scale bar on the print: $L_{scale, print} = 16~\\text{mm}$\n\nTo maintain dimensional consistency, we must express these lengths in the same unit. The final answer is required in millimeters ($\\text{mm}$), so we will convert all units to millimeters. The conversion between micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) and millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) is $1~\\text{mm} = 1000~\\mu\\text{m}$.\nTherefore, the actual length of the scale bar in millimeters is:\n$$L_{scale, actual} = 200~\\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1~\\text{mm}}{1000~\\mu\\text{m}} = 0.2~\\text{mm}$$\n\nNow, we can express the magnification factor, $M$, as the ratio of the printed length to the actual length of the scale bar:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{scale, print}}{L_{scale, actual}} = \\frac{16~\\text{mm}}{0.2~\\text{mm}} = 80$$\nThe magnification is a dimensionless quantity. The micrograph is magnified $80$ times.\n\nNext, we apply this same magnification factor to the measured depth of invasion (DOI). Let $L_{DOI, print}$ be the measured perpendicular distance on the print and $L_{DOI, actual}$ be the true, unknown depth of invasion.\nWe are given:\n- The measured DOI on the print: $L_{DOI, print} = 72~\\text{mm}$\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{DOI, print}}{L_{DOI, actual}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the actual depth of invasion, $L_{DOI, actual}$:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = \\frac{L_{DOI, print}}{M}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $L_{DOI, print}$ and $M$:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = \\frac{72~\\text{mm}}{80}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = 0.9~\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.9~\\text{mm}$ has one significant figure. To express this value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = 0.9000~\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine the pathological stage based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2021 criteria for tumors confined to the vulva or perineum with no nodal involvement. The criteria provided are:\n- Stage IA: depth of invasion $\\leq 1~\\text{mm}$\n- Stage IB: depth of invasion $> 1~\\text{mm}$\n\nOur calculated actual depth of invasion is $L_{DOI, actual} = 0.9000~\\text{mm}$. We compare this value to the threshold of $1~\\text{mm}$:\n$$0.9000~\\text{mm} \\leq 1~\\text{mm}$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, based on the FIGO 2021 criteria, the lesion is Stage IA.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the depth of invasion as the final answer.",

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient age: $68$-year-old\n- Diagnosis: Biopsy-proven vulvar squamous cell carcinoma\n- Procedure: Radical local excision with ipsilateral inguinofemoral lymph node (IFLN) dissection\n- Preoperative imaging: No pelvic lymphadenopathy or distant disease\n- Primary vulvar lesion:\n    - Greatest dimension: $2.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n    - Stromal invasion depth: $4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    - Extension: No involvement of urethral, vaginal, or rectal mucosa\n    - Margins: Negative\n- Frozen section of IFLNs:\n    - Three metastatic deposits\n    - Sizes: $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $3.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $2.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    - Extracapsular extension (ECE): Not appreciated\n    - Provisional FIGO stage assigned: Stage IIIA\n- Final postoperative pathology:\n    - One metastatic deposit of $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ with confirmed extracapsular extension (ECE)\n    - Two intranodal metastatic deposits of $3.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $2.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Clinical findings:\n    - No clinical evidence of fixed or ulcerated inguinal nodes\n    - No pelvic lymph node involvement\n    - No distant metastases\n- Question: Select the most appropriate updated stage after incorporation of final pathology, based on the FIGO vulvar cancer staging system for Stage III.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a realistic clinical scenario in gynecologic oncology, using standard medical terminology and presenting data typically used for cancer staging. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system is the internationally accepted standard for gynecologic cancers, including vulvar cancer. The provided data are sufficient and internally consistent for determining the final pathological stage.\n\nThe problem statement mentions a \"provisional ... stage of Stage IIIA is assigned.\" Based on the frozen section data (three positive nodes, one of which is $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the correct provisional stage would have been Stage IIIB (T1, N2b, M0). This discrepancy does not invalidate the problem, as the core task is to determine the *updated* stage based on the *final pathology*. The inaccuracy of the provisional staging is part of the clinical narrative and does not affect the calculation of the correct final answer. The problem is a straightforward application of a well-defined classification system.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed by applying the FIGO staging criteria to the final pathological findings.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires determining the correct FIGO stage for a patient with vulvar cancer based on final histopathological findings. The staging of vulvar cancer is determined by the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification, as defined by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The most recent revision is the 2021 FIGO staging system.\n\n**1. Determine the T (Primary Tumor) Stage:**\nThe primary vulvar lesion is described as being $2.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension with a stromal invasion depth of $4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The tumor is confined to the vulva.\nAccording to the FIGO 2021 staging:\n- **T1:** Tumor confined to the vulva or perineum.\n  - **T1a:** Tumor size $\\leq 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ AND stromal invasion $\\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n  - **T1b:** Tumor size $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ OR stromal invasion $> 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **T2:** Tumor of any size with extension to adjacent perineal structures ($1/3$ lower urethra, $1/3$ lower vagina, anus).\n- **T3:** Tumor of any size with extension to upper part of adjacent perineal structures ($2/3$ upper urethra, $2/3$ upper vagina) or with gross-local invasion of any of the following structures: bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa or fixed to pelvic bone.\n\nThe patient's tumor is $2.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ (which is $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) and has a stromal invasion of $4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (which is $> 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The tumor is confined to the vulva. This corresponds to a **T1b** classification.\n\n**2. Determine the N (Regional Lymph Node) Stage:**\nThe regional lymph nodes for vulvar cancer are the inguinofemoral lymph nodes. The final pathology report is the definitive source for N staging.\n- Total number of metastatic lymph nodes: $3$\n- Sizes of metastatic deposits: $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $3.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $2.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Key finding: The $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ metastasis has **extracapsular extension (ECE)**.\n\nAccording to the FIGO 2021 nodal staging:\n- **N1a:** One or two lymph node metastasis(es) each $< 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N1b:** One lymph node metastasis $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2a:** Three or more lymph node metastasis(es) each $< 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2b:** Two or more lymph node metastasis(es), at least one of which is $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2c:** Lymph node metastasis(es) with extracapsular spread.\n- **N3:** Fixed or ulcerated regional lymph node metastasis(es) or pelvic lymph node metastasis(es).\n\nThe patient has a lymph node metastasis with confirmed extracapsular extension (ECE). The presence of ECE is a specific criterion that automatically classifies the nodal status. Therefore, the patient's nodal stage is **N2c**. The number and size of the nodes are superseded by the presence of ECE for N-classification. The problem also states there is no evidence of fixed or ulcerated nodes, ruling out N3.\n\n**3. Determine the M (Distant Metastasis) Stage:**\nThe problem states \"Preoperative imaging shows no ... distant disease\" and on final assessment, \"no distant metastases\". This corresponds to an **M0** classification.\n\n**4. Determine the Overall FIGO Stage:**\nThe overall stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M classifications.\n- **Stage IIIA:** T1/T2, N1a/N1b, M0\n- **Stage IIIB:** T1/T2, N2a/N2b, M0\n- **Stage IIIC:** T1/T2, N2c, M0  OR  T3, any N, M0\n- **Stage IVA:** Any T, N3, M0  OR  T4, any N, M0\n- **Stage IVB:** Any T, any N, M1\n\nThe patient's final staging is T1b, N2c, M0.\nSubstituting these into the stage group definitions:\n- The patient's T-stage is T1.\n- The patient's N-stage is N2c.\n- The patient's M-stage is M0.\nThis combination (T1, N2c, M0) fits the criteria for **Stage IIIC**.\n\n### OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Stage IIIA**\nThis stage corresponds to T1/T2, N1a/N1b, M0. The patient's N-stage is N2c due to the presence of extracapsular extension. N2c is a more advanced nodal stage than N1a or N1b. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B. Stage IIIB**\nThis stage corresponds to T1/T2, N2a/N2b, M0. Without the finding of ECE, the patient's nodal status (three positive nodes, one $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) would have been N2b, and the stage would have been IIIB. However, the definitive final pathology identified ECE, which upgrades the nodal stage to N2c. N2c defines Stage IIIC, not IIIB. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C. Stage IIIC**\nThis stage includes the combination T1/T2, N2c, M0. The patient's classification is T1b, N2c, M0, which fits this definition precisely. The presence of extracapsular extension is the critical determinant that leads to this stage. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Stage IVA**\nThis stage requires T4 disease (invasion of upper urethra/vagina, bladder/rectal mucosa, or fixed to bone), or N3 disease (fixed, ulcerated, or pelvic nodes). The patient has a T1b tumor and N2c nodal status. The problem explicitly rules out T4 and N3 criteria. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**E. Stage IVB**\nThis stage requires the presence of distant metastasis (M1). The problem explicitly states the patient is M0. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of nodal metastasis given a negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) result, denoted as $P(\\text{metastasis} \\mid \\text{SLNB negative})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, sensitivities, and specificities, derived from first principles.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that the patient has nodal metastasis, and $M^c$ be the event that the patient does not have nodal metastasis.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the SLNB test result is negative, and $T^+$ be the event that the SLNB test result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following prior probability:\nThe pretest probability of metastasis is $P(M) = 0.20$.\nTherefore, the pretest probability of no metastasis is the complement:\n$$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nThe test characteristics are given as:\nSensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease (metastasis) is present:\n$$Se = P(T^+ \\mid M) = 0.93$$\nSpecificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease (metastasis) is absent:\n$$Sp = P(T^- \\mid M^c) = 0.98$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of metastasis given a negative test result, which is $P(M \\mid T^-)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid M) P(M)}{P(T^-)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the two possible states (metastasis present or absent):\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\mid M) P(M) + P(T^- \\mid M^c) P(M^c)$$\n\nWe already have $P(M)$, $P(M^c)$, and $P(T^- \\mid M^c) = Sp$. We need the term $P(T^- \\mid M)$, which is the probability of a negative test result when metastasis is actually present. This is the false negative rate (FNR). The false negative rate is the complement of the sensitivity:\n$$P(T^- \\mid M) = 1 - P(T^+ \\mid M) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known values into the expanded Bayes' theorem formula:\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid M) P(M)}{P(T^- \\mid M) P(M) + P(T^- \\mid M^c) P(M^c)}$$\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{(0.07)(0.20)}{(0.07)(0.20) + (0.98)(0.80)}$$\n\nWe perform the arithmetic calculations:\nThe numerator is:\n$$(0.07)(0.20) = 0.014$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$(0.07)(0.20) + (0.98)(0.80) = 0.014 + 0.784 = 0.798$$\n\nSo, the post-test probability is:\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{0.014}{0.798}$$\n\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we can write the decimal numbers as fractions:\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{\\frac{14}{1000}}{\\frac{798}{1000}} = \\frac{14}{798}$$\n\nWe simplify this fraction by finding common divisors. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by $2$:\n$$\\frac{14 \\div 2}{798 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{399}$$\nNext, we check if $399$ is divisible by $7$.\n$$399 \\div 7 = 57$$\nThus, the fraction simplifies to:\n$$P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{1}{57}$$\n\nThe final step is to compare this post-test probability with the clinical threshold for additional imaging, $\\tau = 0.05$.\nThe threshold is $\\tau = 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\nWe need to compare $P(M \\mid T^-) = \\frac{1}{57}$ with $\\tau = \\frac{1}{20}$.\nSince $57 > 20$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{57} < \\frac{1}{20}$.\nTherefore, the patient's post-test probability of nodal metastasis, $\\frac{1}{57}$, is less than the institutional threshold of $\\tau = 0.05$.\n\nConclusion on Clinical Decision: Based on the institutional policy, since the post-test probability of metastasis ($P(M \\mid T^-) \\approx 0.0175$) is less than the threshold of $\\tau = 0.05$, additional imaging is not warranted.",
