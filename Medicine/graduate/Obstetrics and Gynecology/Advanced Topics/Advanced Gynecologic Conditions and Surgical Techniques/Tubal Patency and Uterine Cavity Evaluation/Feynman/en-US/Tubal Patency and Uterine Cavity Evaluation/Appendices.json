A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has true tubal occlusion.\nLet $\\neg D$ be the event that a patient has true tubal patency.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result from hysterosalpingography (HSG).\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test result from HSG.\n\nThe givens are expressed in probabilistic terms as:\n-   Pretest probability of occlusion: $P(D) = 0.25$.\n-   Sensitivity: $P(T^{+} | D) = 0.65$.\n-   Specificity: $P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 0.83$.\n\nThe task is to first derive the relationship between post-test odds and pretest odds, and then to calculate the post-test probability, $P(D | T^{+})$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Odds Relationship**\n\nWe start from the fundamental definitions as required.\n\n1.  **Bayes' Theorem** for the post-test probability of disease given a positive test is:\n    $$P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\n2.  **Definition of Odds**: Odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n    -   The **pretest odds** of occlusion are:\n        $$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}$$\n    -   The **post-test odds** of occlusion after a positive test are:\n        $$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D | T^{+})}{P(\\neg D | T^{+})}$$\n\n3.  **Definition of Positive Likelihood Ratio (LR$^{+}$)**: The LR$^{+}$ is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in diseased individuals to the probability of a positive test in non-diseased individuals.\n    $$\\text{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D)}$$\n\nOur goal is to derive the relationship $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D | T^{+})}{P(\\neg D | T^{+})}$$\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem to both the numerator and the denominator. For the numerator, we have $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$. For the denominator, we can write a corresponding form for the probability of no disease given a positive test: $P(\\neg D | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^{+})}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the post-test odds expression:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}}{\\frac{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^{+})}}$$\n\nThe term for the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^{+})$, cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\n\nRearranging the terms to group the ratios:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{P(T^{+} | D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} \\right)$$\n\nBy substituting the definitions of the positive likelihood ratio and pretest odds, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Post-Test Probability**\n\nWe now apply this derived relationship to compute the post-test probability, $P(D|T^{+})$.\n\n1.  **Calculate Pretest Odds ($\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$)**:\n    -   Given $P(D) = 0.25$.\n    -   The probability of not having the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Positive Likelihood Ratio (LR$^{+}$)**:\n    -   The numerator is the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} | D) = 0.65$.\n    -   The denominator, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D)$, is the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity, $P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 0.83$. Since a patient either tests positive or negative, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D) + P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 1$.\n    -   Therefore, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 1 - 0.83 = 0.17$.\n    -   $\\text{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D)} = \\frac{0.65}{0.17}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Post-Test Odds ($\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$)**:\n    -   Using the derived formula: $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.17} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.51}$.\n\n4.  **Convert Post-Test Odds to Post-Test Probability**:\n    -   The relationship between probability ($p$) and odds is $p = \\frac{\\text{odds}}{1 + \\text{odds}}$.\n    -   Therefore, the post-test probability is $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}$.\n    -   $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.51}}{1 + \\frac{0.65}{0.51}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.51}}{\\frac{0.51 + 0.65}{0.51}} = \\frac{0.65}{0.51 + 0.65} = \\frac{0.65}{1.16}$.\n\n5.  **Final Numerical Calculation**:\n    -   $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{0.65}{1.16} \\approx 0.560344827...$\n    -   Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.5603$.\n\nThus, for a patient with a positive HSG, the probability of having true tubal occlusion increases from a pretest probability of $0.25$ to a post-test probability of approximately $0.5603$.",

            "introduction": "Diagnostic tests are rarely perfect, and understanding their specific limitations is crucial for sound clinical judgment. This problem moves from abstract probabilities to a concrete clinical scenario: the common finding of proximal tubal occlusion on HSG, which can often be a false positive due to tubal spasm.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the false occlusion rate for hysterosalpingography (HSG) in detecting proximal tubal occlusion, based on provided cohort data, and a subsequent discussion on the clinical implications.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total number of women with an initial proximal tubal occlusion finding on HSG who underwent a confirmatory test: $60$.\n- Number of women from this group who demonstrated tubal patency on the definitive confirmatory test: $12$.\n- Definition of false occlusion rate: \"the proportion of initial occlusion diagnoses that are false when verified by a definitive test\".\n- Required precision for the numerical answer: a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it deals with the performance evaluation of a standard medical diagnostic procedure (HSG) using established principles of test accuracy. The context is obstetrics and gynecology, and the procedures mentioned (HSG, selective salpingography, laparoscopy with chromopertubation) are standard clinical practice for evaluating tubal patency. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary data and a clear, operational definition for the quantity to be calculated. The language is objective and precise. The data are consistent and biologically plausible. The problem is formalizable into a simple statistical calculation and is directly relevant to its stated topic. No flaws listed in the validation checklist are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks for the \"false occlusion rate.\" It is operationally defined as the proportion of initial occlusion diagnoses that are found to be false upon verification with a definitive test. In the parlance of diagnostic test evaluation, the HSG finding of \"proximal tubal occlusion\" can be considered a \"positive\" test result for the condition of occlusion. The definitive confirmatory test (e.g., laparoscopy) is treated as the gold standard. A case where HSG indicates occlusion, but the confirmatory test shows patency, represents a \"false positive\" result for the occlusion diagnosis.\n\nLet $N_{HSG_+}$ be the total number of patients with a positive HSG test for proximal tubal occlusion. From the givens, $N_{HSG_+} = 60$.\nLet $N_{FP}$ be the number of false positive results, defined as patients with a positive HSG test ($HSG_+$) who are found to be negative for occlusion (i.e., have patent tubes) by the gold standard confirmatory test. From the givens, $N_{FP} = 12$.\n\nThe false occlusion rate, which we can denote as $R_{FO}$, is defined as the proportion of positive HSG tests that are false. This corresponds directly to the calculation of the False Positive Rate, which is often expressed as $1$ minus the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) when considering the population tested. However, using the explicit definition provided is more direct.\n\nThe rate is calculated as:\n$$R_{FO} = \\frac{\\text{Number of false occlusion diagnoses}}{\\text{Total number of initial occlusion diagnoses}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{FO} = \\frac{N_{FP}}{N_{HSG_+}} = \\frac{12}{60}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$R_{FO} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$R_{FO} = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.2$ with three significant figures, we must add trailing zeros.\n$$R_{FO} = 0.200$$\n\n**Discussion of Clinical Implications**\nA false occlusion rate of $0.200$, or $20\\%$, is a clinically significant finding. It indicates that one in five women diagnosed with proximal tubal blockage via HSG may actually have patent fallopian tubes. This has several important implications for clinical practice:\n\n1.  **HSG as a Screening Tool**: This rate reinforces the understanding that HSG is an excellent initial screening tool but lacks perfect specificity for proximal tubal occlusion. A diagnosis of proximal blockage on HSG should not be considered definitive without further investigation.\n2.  **Informing Clinical Decision-Making**: Based on this rate, proceeding directly to treatments that bypass the fallopian tubes, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), based solely on an HSG result would be inappropriate for a significant minority of patients. It would lead to unnecessary, costly, and invasive treatment for the $20\\%$ of women who may be capable of natural conception.\n3.  **Value of Confirmatory Testing**: The data strongly support a clinical pathway that includes a second, more definitive test after an HSG shows proximal occlusion. The problem mentions selective salpingography and laparoscopy with chromopertubation, which serve as the gold standard. Performing such a test is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate counseling.\n4.  **Role of Tubal Cannulation**: Selective salpingography often involves transcervical tubal cannulation. This procedure is not only diagnostic but can also be therapeutic. The apparent \"blockage\" on an HSG can sometimes be due to transient tubal spasm or a simple mucus plug. Cannulation can overcome these issues, simultaneously confirming patency and potentially restoring fertility, thus avoiding the need for IVF. Therefore, the high false occlusion rate highlights the utility of a procedure like selective salpingography with cannulation as the logical next step.\n\nIn summary, a practitioner armed with this knowledge would be compelled to counsel the patient that the HSG finding is provisional and to strongly recommend a confirmatory procedure before concluding that the fallopian tubes are non-functional and moving to IVF.",

Derivation of the Decision Threshold ($p^{\\ast}$)**\n\nWe want to choose the action (laparoscopy vs. noninvasive testing) that minimizes the expected harm. Let $p$ be the posterior probability of disease, $P(D|\\text{evidence})$.\n\n-   **Action 1: Perform diagnostic laparoscopy.** The problem defines the expected harm of this action as a constant, $C_L$. A more formal derivation from first principles considers the harm of an unnecessary procedure. If the disease is absent (with probability $1-p$), the harm is $C_L$. If the disease is present (with probability $p$), the procedure is necessary, and this pathway leads to the correct treatment, so the relative harm from the *decision itself* is $0$. The expected harm is thus $E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Laparoscopy})] = p \\cdot 0 + (1-p)C_L = (1-p)C_L$.\n\n-   **Action 2: Proceed with noninvasive testing.** The harm in this pathway, $C_M$, occurs if the disease is actually present (with probability $p$), leading to delay and potential mismanagement. If the disease is absent (with probability $1-p$), this is the correct pathway, so the relative harm is $0$. The expected harm is thus $E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Noninvasive})] = p \\cdot C_M + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = p C_M$.\n\nThe decision threshold, $p^{\\ast}$, is the probability at which we are indifferent between the two actions, i.e., where their expected harms are equal.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Laparoscopy})] = E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Noninvasive})]\n$$\n$$\n(1-p^{\\ast})C_L = p^{\\ast} C_M\n$$\n$$\nC_L - p^{\\ast}C_L = p^{\\ast}C_M\n$$\n$$\nC_L = p^{\\ast}(C_L + C_M)\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{C_L}{C_L + C_M}\n$$\nIf the patient's posterior probability $p$ is greater than $p^{\\ast}$, then $p C_M > (1-p)C_L$, meaning the expected harm of the noninvasive path is higher, so we should choose laparoscopy.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Bayesian Update Algorithm**\n\nBayes' theorem is most conveniently applied in its odds-likelihood form, especially when combining multiple pieces of conditionally independent evidence.\n-   **Pretest Odds:** The odds of an event are the probability of the event divided by the probability of its complement.\n    $$\n    \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}\n    $$\n-   **Likelihood Ratios (LR):** An LR quantifies how much a given test result changes the odds of disease.\n    -   For a positive test result: $LR_{+} = \\frac{P(\\text{Test}+|D)}{P(\\text{Test}+|\\neg D)} = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1-\\text{specificity}}$.\n    -   For a negative test result: $LR_{-} = \\frac{P(\\text{Test}-|D)}{P(\\text{Test}-|\\neg D)} = \\frac{1-\\text{sensitivity}}{\\text{specificity}}$.\n-   **Posterior Odds:** Under the assumption of conditional independence, the posterior odds are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratios for each piece of evidence.\n    $$\n    \\text{Odds}(D|\\text{evidence}) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR_1 \\times LR_2 \\times \\dots \\times LR_n\n    $$\n-   **Posterior Probability:** The posterior odds can be converted back to a probability.\n    $$\n    P(D|\\text{evidence}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(D|\\text{evidence})}{1+\\text{Odds}(D|\\text{evidence})}\n    $$\n\n**3. Application to the Patient**\n\n-   **Calculate the Decision Threshold:**\n    $$\n    p^{\\ast} = \\frac{C_L}{C_L + C_M} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.07} = \\frac{0.03}{0.10} = 0.30\n    $$\n    The decision rule is: if $P(D|\\text{evidence}) > 0.30$, prioritize laparoscopy.\n\n-   **Calculate Pretest Odds:**\n    $$\n    \\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{1-0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n\n-   **Calculate Likelihood Ratios for the Patient's Evidence:**\n    -   **CAT positive:** This is a positive test result. We use $LR_{+}$.\n        $$\n        LR_{\\text{CAT+}} = \\frac{\\text{sens}_{\\text{CAT}}}{1-\\text{spec}_{\\text{CAT}}} = \\frac{0.76}{1-0.70} = \\frac{0.76}{0.30} = \\frac{76}{30} = \\frac{38}{15} \\approx 2.533\n        $$\n    -   **No hydrosalpinx on TVUS:** This is a negative test finding. We use $LR_{-}$.\n        $$\n        LR_{\\text{TVUS-}} = \\frac{1-\\text{sens}_{\\text{TVUS}}}{\\text{spec}_{\\text{TVUS}}} = \\frac{1-0.85}{0.95} = \\frac{0.15}{0.95} = \\frac{15}{95} = \\frac{3}{19} \\approx 0.158\n        $$\n    -   **History of PID:** The likelihood ratio is given directly.\n        $$\n        LR_{\\text{Hx}} = 2.5 = \\frac{5}{2}\n        $$\n\n-   **Calculate Posterior Odds:**\n    $$\n    \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times LR_{\\text{CAT+}} \\times LR_{\\text{TVUS-}} \\times LR_{\\text{Hx}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{38}{15} \\times \\frac{3}{19} \\times \\frac{5}{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{1 \\times 38 \\times 3 \\times 5}{3 \\times 15 \\times 19 \\times 2} = \\frac{1 \\times (2 \\times 19) \\times 3 \\times 5}{3 \\times (3 \\times 5) \\times 19 \\times 2}\n    $$\n    By cancellation of terms ($2, 3, 5, 19$ from numerator and denominator):\n    $$\n    \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n    The combined likelihood ratio of all evidence is $(38/15) \\times (3/19) \\times (5/2) = 1$. The evidence for disease (CAT+, PID Hx) is perfectly balanced by the evidence against disease (no hydrosalpinx).\n\n-   **Calculate Posterior Probability:**\n    $$\n    P(D|\\text{evidence}) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1+\\text{Posterior Odds}} = \\frac{1/3}{1+1/3} = \\frac{1/3}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n    $$\n    The posterior probability of clinically significant tubal disease is $0.25$.\n\n-   **Make the Decision:**\n    We compare the posterior probability to the threshold:\n    $$\n    P(D|\\text{evidence}) = 0.25 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p^{\\ast} = 0.30\n    $$\n    Since $0.25 \\le 0.30$, the expected harm of the noninvasive pathway is lower than or equal to the expected harm of proceeding directly to laparoscopy. Therefore, the algorithm prioritizes a noninvasive patency test.\n\n-   **Plan for Uterine Cavity Evaluation:**\n    The initial TVUS showed a normal uterine contour without intracavitary lesions. Noninvasive tubal patency tests such as Hysterosalpingo-Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) or Hysterosalpingography (HSG) also provide an image of the uterine cavity. A reasonable clinical plan would be to proceed with one of these tests. If the imaging of the cavity from HyCoSy/HSG raises new suspicion of a lesion, a dedicated uterine cavity evaluation like saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) or office hysteroscopy would then be warranted. It is not necessary to plan for SIS upfront given the normal initial TVUS.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Assume conditional independence, convert $P(D)$ to pretest odds, multiply by $LR_{+}$ for CAT positivity, $LR_{-}$ for absent hydrosalpinx on TVUS, and $LR_{\\text{Hx}}$ for prior PID, convert back to probability, and compare to a threshold $p^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{C_{L}}{C_{L} + C_{M}}$. With CAT positive and TVUS negative for hydrosalpinx, obtain $P(D \\mid \\text{evidence}) \\approx 0.25$, which is less than $p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.30$; therefore, prioritize a noninvasive patency test (Hysterosalpingo-Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) or Hysterosalpingography (HSG)) and, given normal TVUS cavity, plan saline infusion sonohysterography only if HyCoSy suggests cavity irregularity.**\n\nThis option perfectly matches the derived algorithm, calculations, decision, and clinical plan. The logic is sound from start to finish.\n-   Algorithm: **Correct**.\n-   Threshold formula: **Correct**.\n-   Posterior probability calculation: **Correct**.\n-   Decision: **Correct**.\n-   Ancillary plan: **Correct** and clinically logical.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Add sensitivities and historical $LR$ to update risk directly: $0.76 + 0.85 + 2.5 \\approx 4.11$, treat this as the posterior probability, which exceeds the threshold, and prioritize laparoscopy.**\n\nThis option proposes an arithmetical procedure that is devoid of any basis in probability theory. Sensitivities and likelihood ratios cannot be added. Probabilities cannot exceed $1$. This is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Multiply likelihood ratios correctly but compare posterior odds directly to $p^{\\ast}$, and since posterior odds $\\approx 0.33$ exceeds $p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.30$, prioritize laparoscopy.**\n\nThis option correctly calculates the posterior odds $(\\approx 0.333...$ or $1/3)$. However, it makes a category error by comparing odds ($1/3$) with a probability threshold ($p^{\\ast}=0.30$). Odds and probabilities are not directly comparable on the same scale. The odds of $1/3$ correspond to a probability of $0.25$, which is *less than* the threshold. The comparison is invalid, leading to the wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use CAT alone to compute the positive predictive value from sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, obtaining approximately $0.46$, treat this as definitive, and prioritize laparoscopy without integrating TVUS or history.**\n\nThis option correctly calculates the posterior probability using only the CAT result ($P(D|\\text{CAT+}) \\approx 0.46$). However, its core flaw is failing to incorporate all available evidence as instructed by the problem statement (\"integrate... CAT... TVUS, and clinical history\"). Ignoring relevant clinical information (the reassuring TVUS finding) is a significant methodological error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Multiply $LR_{+}$ for CAT and clinical history and use $LR_{+}$ for TVUS despite absent hydrosalpinx, yielding $P(D \\mid \\text{evidence}) \\approx 0.97$, which exceeds the threshold; therefore, prioritize laparoscopy and defer uterine cavity evaluation to intraoperative hysteroscopy.**\n\nThis option makes a critical error by using the positive likelihood ratio ($LR_{+}$) for a negative test result (absent hydrosalpinx on TVUS). For a negative finding, the negative likelihood ratio ($LR_{-}$) must be used. This error dramatically and incorrectly inflates the posterior probability, leading to the wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
