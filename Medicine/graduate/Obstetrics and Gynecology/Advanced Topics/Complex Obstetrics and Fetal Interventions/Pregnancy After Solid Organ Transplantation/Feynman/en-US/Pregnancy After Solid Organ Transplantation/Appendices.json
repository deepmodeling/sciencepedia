            "problem": "A maternal-fetal medicine team is counseling a cohort of pregnant kidney transplant recipients with stable allograft function about preventive strategies for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In the general obstetric population, the baseline absolute risk of preeclampsia is $0.045$. In kidney transplant recipients, the relative risk multiplier for preeclampsia attributable to the transplant status is $3.0$. Among these recipients, a proportion $p$ have preexisting chronic hypertension, where $p = 0.55$. For those with chronic hypertension, there is an additional multiplicative relative risk factor of $1.8$ beyond the transplant-associated relative risk; for those without chronic hypertension, there is no additional multiplicative factor beyond the transplant-associated relative risk. A policy of universal low-dose aspirin prophylaxis starting at $12$ weeks' gestation is considered; based on meta-analytic evidence, the relative risk multiplier for preeclampsia under aspirin prophylaxis is $0.85$ (assumed constant across strata).\n\nAssume the following:\n- Relative risks combine multiplicatively within a stratum.\n- The absolute risk in each stratum equals the general population baseline absolute risk multiplied by the applicable relative risk multipliers for that stratum.\n- The effect of aspirin prophylaxis is a constant multiplicative relative risk applied to the stratum-specific absolute risk.\n\nUnder these assumptions, compute the Number Needed to Treat with aspirin to prevent one case of preeclampsia in this kidney transplant pregnancy cohort.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Baseline absolute risk of preeclampsia in the general population, $R_{base}$: $0.045$.\n- Relative risk multiplier for preeclampsia due to kidney transplant status, $RR_{tx}$: $3.0$.\n- Proportion of kidney transplant recipients with preexisting chronic hypertension, $p$: $0.55$.\n- Additional multiplicative relative risk factor for transplant recipients with chronic hypertension, $RR_{cHTN}$: $1.8$.\n- Relative risk multiplier for preeclampsia under aspirin prophylaxis, $RR_{ASA}$: $0.85$.\n- Assumptions:\n    1. Relative risks combine multiplicatively.\n    2. Stratum-specific absolute risk = $R_{base} \\times (\\text{product of applicable relative risks})$.\n    3. The effect of aspirin is a constant multiplicative relative risk applied to the stratum-specific absolute risk.\n- Objective: Compute the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) with aspirin to prevent one case of preeclampsia in this cohort, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard epidemiological scenario for calculating NNT in a stratified population. The given values are plausible within the context of obstetrics and transplant medicine. The assumptions of multiplicative risk and constant treatment effect are common simplifications in such models. The problem is self-contained, with no contradictions or missing information required for a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR, in turn, is the difference between the absolute risk in the untreated population ($AR_{untreated}$) and the absolute risk in the treated population ($AR_{treated}$).\n\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated}}\n$$\n\nThe cohort of pregnant kidney transplant recipients is heterogeneous and can be divided into two strata:\n1.  Stratum 1: Recipients with preexisting chronic hypertension (cHTN). This group constitutes a proportion $p = 0.55$ of the cohort.\n2.  Stratum 2: Recipients without preexisting chronic hypertension (no cHTN). This group constitutes the remaining proportion, $1-p = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute risk of preeclampsia without aspirin prophylaxis ($AR_{untreated}$) for the entire cohort. This is the weighted average of the absolute risks of the two strata.\n\nFor Stratum 1 (with cHTN), the total relative risk, $RR_{1}$, is the product of the relative risk from the transplant and the additional relative risk from chronic hypertension.\n$$\nRR_{1} = RR_{tx} \\times RR_{cHTN} = 3.0 \\times 1.8 = 5.4\n$$\nThe absolute risk for this stratum, $AR_{1}$, is the baseline risk multiplied by this combined relative risk.\n$$\nAR_{1} = R_{base} \\times RR_{1} = 0.045 \\times 5.4 = 0.243\n$$\n\nFor Stratum 2 (no cHTN), the total relative risk, $RR_{2}$, is solely the relative risk from the transplant.\n$$\nRR_{2} = RR_{tx} = 3.0\n$$\nThe absolute risk for this stratum, $AR_{2}$, is:\n$$\nAR_{2} = R_{base} \\times RR_{2} = 0.045 \\times 3.0 = 0.135\n$$\n\nThe overall absolute risk for the entire cohort without treatment, $AR_{untreated}$, is the weighted average of the stratum-specific absolute risks.\n$$\nAR_{untreated} = (p \\times AR_{1}) + ((1 - p) \\times AR_{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nAR_{untreated} = (0.55 \\times 0.243) + (0.45 \\times 0.135)\n$$\n$$\nAR_{untreated} = 0.13365 + 0.06075 = 0.1944\n$$\nThis represents the absolute risk of preeclampsia in the cohort if no aspirin prophylaxis is given.\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk of preeclampsia with aspirin prophylaxis ($AR_{treated}$). The problem states that aspirin confers a relative risk multiplier of $RR_{ASA} = 0.85$. The absolute risk in the treated cohort is the untreated risk multiplied by this factor.\n$$\nAR_{treated} = AR_{untreated} \\times RR_{ASA}\n$$\n$$\nAR_{treated} = 0.1944 \\times 0.85 = 0.16524\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n$$\nARR = AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated}\n$$\n$$\nARR = 0.1944 - 0.16524 = 0.02916\n$$\nAlternatively, $ARR = AR_{untreated} \\times (1 - RR_{ASA}) = 0.1944 \\times (1 - 0.85) = 0.1944 \\times 0.15 = 0.02916$.\n\nFinally, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the ARR.\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.02916} \\approx 34.2935528...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nNNT \\approx 34.3\n$$\nThis means that, on average, for every $34.3$ pregnant kidney transplant recipients treated with low-dose aspirin, one case of preeclampsia is prevented.",
