            "problem": "A gravida $2$, para $1$ patient at $9$ weeks gestation presents with worsening nausea and vomiting. To standardize assessment and guide management intensity, use the validated $24$-hour Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) instrument, which assigns ordinal scores to three patient-reported domains over the prior $24$ hours. The three domains and their scoring rules are as follows (each item scored from $1$ to $5$):\n\n- Duration of nausea in the past $24$ hours:\n  - Score $1$: $\\leq 1$ hour\n  - Score $2$: $2$–$3$ hours\n  - Score $3$: $4$–$6$ hours\n  - Score $4$: $7$–$9$ hours\n  - Score $5$: $\\geq 10$ hours\n\n- Number of vomiting episodes in the past $24$ hours:\n  - Score $1$: $0$\n  - Score $2$: $1$–$2$\n  - Score $3$: $3$–$4$\n  - Score $4$: $5$–$6$\n  - Score $5$: $\\geq 7$\n\n- Number of retching (dry heave) episodes in the past $24$ hours:\n  - Score $1$: $0$\n  - Score $2$: $1$–$2$\n  - Score $3$: $3$–$4$\n  - Score $4$: $5$–$6$\n  - Score $5$: $\\geq 7$\n\nThe total PUQE score is the sum of the three item scores. Severity categories commonly used to guide treatment intensity are defined by the total score as:\n- Mild: total $\\leq 6$\n- Moderate: total $7$–$12$\n- Severe: total $\\geq 13$\n\nThe patient reports the following for the last $24$ hours:\n- Nausea lasted for $7$ hours and $45$ minutes.\n- Vomiting occurred $3$ times.\n- Retching (dry heaves without vomiting) occurred $5$ times.\n\nFrom first principles using the definitions above, compute the total $24$-hour PUQE score for this patient and identify the severity category that would guide the intensity of management. Express the final answer as a single integer representing the total PUQE score. No units are required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the 24-hour Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) score for a patient based on her reported symptoms and a defined scoring system. The total score will then be used to classify the severity of her condition. The solution proceeds by systematically determining the score for each of the three domains and then summing them.\n\nLet $S_N$ be the score for the duration of nausea, $S_V$ be the score for the number of vomiting episodes, and $S_R$ be the score for the number of retching episodes. The total PUQE score, denoted as $S_{Total}$, is the sum of these individual scores:\n$$S_{Total} = S_N + S_V + S_R$$\n\nFirst, we determine the score for the duration of nausea, $S_N$.\nThe patient reported nausea lasted for $7$ hours and $45$ minutes. To compare this with the scoring criteria, we convert the duration into hours.\n$$7 \\text{ hours} + 45 \\text{ minutes} = 7 + \\frac{45}{60} \\text{ hours} = 7 + 0.75 \\text{ hours} = 7.75 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe scoring rules for nausea duration are:\n- Score $1$: $\\leq 1$ hour\n- Score $2$: $2$–$3$ hours\n- Score $3$: $4$–$6$ hours\n- Score $4$: $7$–$9$ hours\n- Score $5$: $\\geq 10$ hours\n\nThe patient's nausea duration of $7.75$ hours falls within the range of $7$ to $9$ hours, as $7 \\leq 7.75 \\leq 9$. Therefore, the score for nausea is:\n$$S_N = 4$$\n\nSecond, we determine the score for the number of vomiting episodes, $S_V$.\nThe patient reported $3$ episodes of vomiting in the past $24$ hours. The scoring rules for vomiting episodes are:\n- Score $1$: $0$ episodes\n- Score $2$: $1$–$2$ episodes\n- Score $3$: $3$–$4$ episodes\n- Score $4$: $5$–$6$ episodes\n- Score $5$: $\\geq 7$ episodes\n\nThe patient's reported count of $3$ episodes falls within the range of $3$ to $4$ episodes. Therefore, the score for vomiting is:\n$$S_V = 3$$\n\nThird, we determine the score for the number of retching episodes, $S_R$.\nThe patient reported $5$ episodes of retching (dry heaves) in the past $24$ hours. The scoring rules for retching episodes are:\n- Score $1$: $0$ episodes\n- Score $2$: $1$–$2$ episodes\n- Score $3$: $3$–$4$ episodes\n- Score $4$: $5$–$6$ episodes\n- Score $5$: $\\geq 7$ episodes\n\nThe patient's reported count of $5$ episodes falls within the range of $5$ to $6$ episodes. Therefore, the score for retching is:\n$$S_R = 4$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total $24$-hour PUQE score, $S_{Total}$, by summing the individual scores.\n$$S_{Total} = S_N + S_V + S_R = 4 + 3 + 4$$\n$$S_{Total} = 11$$\n\nTo complete the assessment as described in the problem, we classify the severity based on the total score. The severity categories are:\n- Mild: $S_{Total} \\leq 6$\n- Moderate: $7 \\leq S_{Total} \\leq 12$\n- Severe: $S_{Total} \\geq 13$\n\nWith a total score of $11$, the patient's condition is classified as moderate severity, since $7 \\leq 11 \\leq 12$. The problem asks for the total PUQE score itself as the final answer.\nThe total score is $11$.",

This problem will guide you through a first-principles calculation of a potassium replacement strategy, integrating concepts of total body deficit, ongoing losses, and the critical physiological role of magnesium in facilitating potassium correction.

            "problem": "A pregnant patient at $10$ weeks of gestation presents with hyperemesis gravidarum characterized by intractable vomiting for $7$ days, orthostatic symptoms, and clinical dehydration. Laboratory studies reveal serum potassium $[K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}} = 2.8\\ \\text{mmol/L}$, serum magnesium $[Mg^{2+}]_{\\text{serum}}$ consistent with hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and normal renal function. Electrocardiogram (ECG, electrocardiogram) shows prominent $U$ waves and flattened $T$ waves. A $24$-hour urine collection obtained prior to magnesium replacement shows urinary potassium excretion consistent with ongoing renal losses. After administering intravenous (IV, intravenous) magnesium sulfate to correct hypomagnesemia, renal potassium wasting is expected to diminish; based on prior measurements in this patient, the fractional retention of administered potassium improves to $f = 0.90$ once $[Mg^{2+}]_{\\text{serum}}$ is corrected. Ongoing total losses of potassium from urine and non-renal routes over the next $24$ hours are estimated to be $L = 40\\ \\text{mmol}$.\n\nAssume the following well-tested clinical observation holds once magnesium deficiency is corrected and distribution equilibrates: in adults with normal renal function, administration of $10\\ \\text{mmol}$ of potassium chloride typically increases $[K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}}$ by approximately $0.1\\ \\text{mmol/L}$. The target serum potassium for this patient is $[K^{+}]_{\\text{target}} = 4.2\\ \\text{mmol/L}$.\n\nUsing first-principles mass balance reasoning for total body potassium and the empirical response relationship above, derive the total potassium chloride dose to be administered over the next $24$ hours, in $\\text{mmol}$, that will achieve $[K^{+}]_{\\text{target}}$ given the improved retention fraction $f$ after magnesium correction and the expected ongoing losses $L$.\n\nExpress your final answer as the total $\\text{mmol}$ of potassium chloride to administer over the next $24$ hours. Round your answer to three significant figures and use $\\text{mmol}$ as the unit.",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the total dose of potassium chloride, denoted as $D$ (in $\\text{mmol}$), to be administered over a $24$-hour period. The solution will be derived using the principle of mass balance for potassium.\n\nThe total amount of potassium administered must account for two components:\n1.  The amount required to replace the ongoing potassium losses, $L$.\n2.  The amount required to correct the existing total body potassium deficit, $K_{\\text{deficit}}$, which will raise the serum potassium concentration from its initial value to the target value.\n\nThe problem states that after correction of hypomagnesemia, a fraction $f$ of the administered potassium dose $D$ is retained by the body. The total amount of potassium retained is therefore $D \\cdot f$. This retained amount must be equal to the sum of the amount needed to replace losses and the amount needed to replete the deficit. This can be expressed with the following mass balance equation:\n\n$$D \\cdot f = K_{\\text{deficit}} + L$$\n\nTo solve for $D$, we must first determine the value of $K_{\\text{deficit}}$. This is the net increase in total body potassium required to achieve the desired change in serum potassium concentration.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required change in serum potassium concentration, $\\Delta [K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}}$.\nThe initial serum potassium is $[K^{+}]_{\\text{initial}} = 2.8\\ \\text{mmol/L}$.\nThe target serum potassium is $[K^{+}]_{\\text{target}} = 4.2\\ \\text{mmol/L}$.\n\nThe required change is:\n$$\\Delta [K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}} = [K^{+}]_{\\text{target}} - [K^{+}]_{\\text{initial}} = 4.2\\ \\text{mmol/L} - 2.8\\ \\text{mmol/L} = 1.4\\ \\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nNext, we use the provided empirical relationship to convert this change in serum concentration into the corresponding total body potassium deficit, $K_{\\text{deficit}}$. The relationship states that the administration of $10\\ \\text{mmol}$ of potassium chloride increases serum potassium by $0.1\\ \\text{mmol/L}$. This establishes a linear relationship:\n\n$$\\frac{K_{\\text{deficit}}}{\\Delta [K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}}} = \\frac{10\\ \\text{mmol}}{0.1\\ \\text{mmol/L}}$$\n\nWe can now calculate $K_{\\text{deficit}}$ for our required concentration change of $\\Delta [K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}} = 1.4\\ \\text{mmol/L}$:\n\n$$K_{\\text{deficit}} = \\Delta [K^{+}]_{\\text{serum}} \\times \\left( \\frac{10\\ \\text{mmol}}{0.1\\ \\text{mmol/L}} \\right)$$\n$$K_{\\text{deficit}} = 1.4\\ \\text{mmol/L} \\times \\left( \\frac{10\\ \\text{mmol}}{0.1\\ \\text{mmol/L}} \\right) = 1.4 \\times 100\\ \\text{mmol} = 140\\ \\text{mmol}$$\n\nNow we have all the components needed for our mass balance equation. The given values are:\n- Potassium deficit, $K_{\\text{deficit}} = 140\\ \\text{mmol}$.\n- Total ongoing losses, $L = 40\\ \\text{mmol}$.\n- Potassium retention fraction, $f = 0.90$.\n\nWe can now rearrange the mass balance equation to solve for the total administered dose, $D$:\n\n$$D = \\frac{K_{\\text{deficit}} + L}{f}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n\n$$D = \\frac{140\\ \\text{mmol} + 40\\ \\text{mmol}}{0.90}$$\n$$D = \\frac{180\\ \\text{mmol}}{0.90}$$\n$$D = 200\\ \\text{mmol}$$\n\nThe calculated total dose of potassium chloride to be administered over the next $24$ hours is $200\\ \\text{mmol}$. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express this unambiguously to three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $2.00 \\times 10^2$.",

            "problem": "A nulliparous patient at gestational age $9$ weeks presents with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Her pre-pregnancy weight was $68$ kg. The Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea over $24$ hours (PUQE-$24$) is used to quantify symptom severity; higher scores reflect greater severity and are commonly interpreted as mild for $3$ to $6$, moderate for $7$ to $12$, and severe for $\\ge 13$. Ketonuria on urine dipstick reflects negative energy balance and starvation physiology; moderate-to-large ketonuria (e.g., $\\ge 2+$) persisting over time correlates with clinical dehydration and inadequate oral intake. Clinically meaningful weight loss in early pregnancy is commonly defined as a loss of $\\ge 5\\%$ from pre-pregnancy weight, which signals increased risk for complications and the need to intensify support. The patient’s course unfolds as follows:\n\n- Initial visit ($t_0$): weight $65.0$ kg, PUQE-$24$ score $11$, urine ketones $1+$, vital signs stable. She is able to sip small amounts of fluid and keeps occasional crackers. She is started on oral pyridoxine-doxylamine with dietary counseling and oral rehydration, with safety-net follow-up.\n\n- Reassessment after $72$ hours of outpatient therapy ($t_1$): weight $64.2$ kg, PUQE-$24$ score $13$, urine ketones $2+$, she reports ongoing inability to meet fluid targets despite maximal oral regimen. Basic metabolic panel shows mild hypokalemia but no severe electrolyte derangements.\n\n- After $36$ hours of day-unit therapy with intravenous fluids, thiamine supplementation, and stepwise antiemetic escalation ($t_2$): weight $64.6$ kg, PUQE-$24$ score $7$, urine ketones negative, tolerating small frequent oral intake without emesis.\n\n- Outpatient follow-up $5$ days later ($t_3$): weight $65.2$ kg, PUQE-$24$ score $5$, urine ketones negative across the prior $72$ hours by home testing, meeting oral hydration and caloric targets.\n\nYou are asked to design objective decision points and criteria for escalation and de-escalation anchored to the serial PUQE-$24$ scores, ketone status, and weight trajectory over time, such that the plan would (i) appropriately trigger escalation at $t_1$ and (ii) appropriately support de-escalation between $t_2$ and $t_3$. Which of the following protocols best meets these requirements?\n\nA. Escalate to day-unit or inpatient care with parenteral therapy (including thiamine before any dextrose-containing fluids) when any of the following occur: PUQE-$24$ rises to $\\ge 13$, urine ketonuria of $\\ge 2+$ persists beyond $24$ hours, or cumulative weight loss exceeds $\\ge 5\\%$ from pre-pregnancy weight; de-escalate to outpatient oral therapy once, for at least $\\ge 48$ hours, PUQE-$24$ is $\\le 6$, ketonuria is negative, and weight is stable or increasing with adequate oral intake, with follow-up within $3$ to $5$ days.\n\nB. Escalate only if both PUQE-$24$ is $\\ge 13$ and cumulative weight loss is $\\ge 10\\%$ from pre-pregnancy weight, regardless of ketone status; de-escalate as soon as PUQE-$24$ falls below $10$, even if ketonuria persists and weight continues to decline.\n\nC. Escalate whenever any ketonuria of $1+$ is detected at a single time point, regardless of PUQE-$24$ score or weight trend; de-escalate once ketonuria decreases to trace, even if PUQE-$24$ remains $9$ to $10$ and weight continues to fall.\n\nD. Escalate only after $7$ days of failed outpatient therapy, independent of PUQE-$24$, ketones, or weight trajectory; de-escalate immediately after the first intravenous fluid session if the patient reports subjective improvement, without objective reassessment of PUQE-$24$, ketones, or weight.",
            "solution": "The goal is to find the protocol that correctly mandates escalation of care at timepoint $t_1$ and provides appropriate criteria for the successful de-escalation that occurs between $t_2$ and $t_3$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the objective clinical thresholds based on the problem description:\n- **Severe PUQE-24 Score**: $\\ge 13$.\n- **Significant Ketonuria**: $\\ge 2+$.\n- **Significant Weight Loss**: A loss of $\\ge 5\\%$ from the pre-pregnancy weight of $68$ kg. The threshold weight is $68 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 64.6$ kg. Any weight at or below this indicates significant loss.\n\nNow, let's analyze the patient's status at the key timepoint $t_1$:\n- **Weight**: $64.2$ kg. This is below the $64.6$ kg threshold, representing a $5.59\\%$ loss. The criterion for significant weight loss is met.\n- **PUQE-24**: $13$. The criterion for a severe score is met.\n- **Urine Ketones**: $2+$. The criterion for significant ketonuria is met.\nAt $t_1$, the patient's condition has objectively worsened and meets multiple criteria for severe disease, warranting an escalation of care from outpatient to parenteral therapy.\n\nNext, let's analyze the de-escalation phase between $t_2$ and $t_3$:\n- At $t_2$, after initial treatment, the patient shows improvement (PUQE-24 is $7$, ketones are negative), but symptoms are still in the moderate range. A safe protocol would require further demonstrated stability before de-escalation.\n- At $t_3$, the patient is stable on oral therapy (PUQE-24 is $5$ (mild), ketones are negative, weight is increasing). This confirms that the de-escalation was successful. A correct protocol should have criteria that are met sometime between $t_2$ and $t_3$.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n\n**A.** This protocol escalates care if *any* of the following are met: PUQE-24 $\\ge 13$, ketonuria $\\ge 2+$, or weight loss $\\ge 5\\%$. At $t_1$, the patient meets all three criteria, so this protocol correctly triggers escalation. For de-escalation, it requires PUQE-24 $\\le 6$, negative ketones, and stable/increasing weight for $\\ge 48$ hours. At $t_2$, the PUQE-24 is $7$, so this protocol would not de-escalate immediately, which is safe. By $t_3$, all criteria are met. This protocol aligns perfectly with the clinical scenario.\n\n**B.** This protocol requires *both* PUQE-24 $\\ge 13$ and weight loss $\\ge 10\\%$. At $t_1$, the patient's weight loss is only $5.59\\%$, so this protocol would fail to escalate care. This is clinically unsafe.\n\n**C.** This protocol escalates for *any* ketonuria of $1+$. This would have triggered escalation at the initial visit ($t_0$), which is overly aggressive. The de-escalation criteria are unsafe, ignoring PUQE score and weight trends.\n\n**D.** This protocol uses an arbitrary $7$-day waiting period for escalation, ignoring objective data. This would have dangerously delayed care for the patient at $t_1$. De-escalation is based on subjective improvement, which is unreliable.\n\nConclusion: Protocol A is the only one that uses objective, clinically appropriate criteria that match the patient's trajectory for both escalation and de-escalation.",
