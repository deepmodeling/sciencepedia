While a patient's Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is a traditional starting point, first-trimester ultrasound measurement of the Crown-Rump Length (CRL) is the gold standard for dating, especially when menstrual cycles are irregular. This foundational exercise hones your ability to use definitive ultrasound data to anchor the pregnancy timeline and perform the precise date calculations essential for scheduling all subsequent care.",

            "problem": "A patient presents for initial prenatal care with irregular menstrual cycles ranging from 21 to 45 days. Her reported Last Menstrual Period (LMP) began on 2025-07-02, but she notes that in the past 6 months her menses have varied unpredictably. A first-trimester ultrasound was performed on 2025-08-20 measuring a Crown-Rump Length (CRL) of $12.4 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$; the sonographer documented a gestational age of 53 days using a standardized CRL dating reference. The patient returns for her first comprehensive prenatal visit on 2025-09-15.\n\nUsing only well-established definitions and facts in obstetrics, and selecting the appropriate dating method given the clinical context of irregular cycles, determine both:\n- the gestational age on the date 2025-09-15, expressed as a count of days since the gestational age origin, and\n- the Estimated Due Date (EDD), expressed as the ordinal day-of-year number in the Gregorian calendar year 2026 (where January 1 is ordinal day 1 and December 31 is ordinal day 365).\n\nIf any intermediate calculations produce fractions, do not round; the final reported quantities must be exact whole-number day counts. Express the gestational age in days and the EDD as an ordinal day-of-year number. Provide your final answers as a single row matrix in the form $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{GA in days} & \\text{EDD ordinal day-of-year}\\end{pmatrix}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of obstetrics, specifically concerning the dating of pregnancy. The provided data are self-contained, consistent, and realistic. The core of the problem lies in selecting the appropriate dating method, a standard clinical decision-making process. Guidelines from professional bodies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that in a pregnancy with a certain first-trimester ultrasound, the gestational age and estimated due date should be determined from the ultrasound measurements, especially when the patient has irregular menstrual cycles. The problem explicitly states a history of irregular cycles (ranging from 21 to 45 days), making the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) date of 2025-07-02 unreliable. Therefore, the ultrasound measurement is the definitive basis for all subsequent calculations.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe primary data point for establishing the timeline of the pregnancy is a first-trimester ultrasound performed on 2025-08-20, which determined a gestational age (GA) of 53 days based on a Crown-Rump Length (CRL) of $12.4 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This information serves as the anchor for all calculations.\n\nFirst, we determine the gestational age on the date of the comprehensive prenatal visit, 2025-09-15. To do this, we must calculate the number of days that have passed between the ultrasound date and the visit date.\nThe ultrasound date is 2025-08-20.\nThe visit date is 2025-09-15.\nThe year 2025 is not a leap year, so August has 31 days.\nThe number of days remaining in August after the ultrasound is:\n$$ 31 - 20 = 11 \\ \\text{days} $$\nThe number of days into September until the visit is 15 days.\nThe total number of days elapsed between the ultrasound and the visit is:\n$$ \\Delta t = 11 + 15 = 26 \\ \\text{days} $$\nThe gestational age on the visit date is the gestational age on the ultrasound date plus the elapsed time:\n$$ \\text{GA}_{\\text{visit}} = \\text{GA}_{\\text{ultrasound}} + \\Delta t $$\n$$ \\text{GA}_{\\text{visit}} = 53 + 26 = 79 \\ \\text{days} $$\nThis is the first required quantity.\n\nSecond, we determine the Estimated Due Date (EDD). The standard human gestation period is defined as 280 days from the conceptual origin of the pregnancy. We must first establish this origin date, which we can call the Gestational Age Origin (GAO). The GAO is the date corresponding to Day 0 of gestation. Since the GA was 53 days on 2025-08-20, the GAO is 53 days prior to this date.\nTo find the GAO, we subtract 53 days from 2025-08-20:\n- Subtracting 20 days from August 20 brings us to July 31. We have $53 - 20 = 33$ days left to subtract.\n- The month of July has 31 days. Subtracting 31 days brings us to June 30. We have $33 - 31 = 2$ days left to subtract.\n- Subtracting 2 days from June 30 brings us to June 28.\nThus, the GAO is 2025-06-28.\n\nThe EDD is 280 days after the GAO.\n$$ \\text{EDD} = \\text{GAO} + 280 \\ \\text{days} = 2025\\text{-}06\\text{-}28 + 280 \\ \\text{days} $$\nWe need to find the ordinal day-of-year for the EDD in the year 2026. First, we calculate the number of days remaining in the year 2025 starting from the GAO.\nThe year 2025 is not a leap year and has 365 days.\nNumber of days remaining in June 2025: $30 - 28 = 2$ days.\nNumber of days in July: 31.\nNumber of days in August: 31.\nNumber of days in September: 30.\nNumber of days in October: 31.\nNumber of days in November: 30.\nNumber of days in December: 31.\nTotal days remaining in 2025 from the GAO:\n$$ 2 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 186 \\ \\text{days} $$\nThe pregnancy duration is 280 days. The number of days of the pregnancy that will fall in the year 2026 is:\n$$ 280 - 186 = 94 \\ \\text{days} $$\nThe EDD is therefore the 94-th day of the year 2026. The year 2026 is not a leap year. This ordinal day number is the second required quantity.\n\nThe two final answers are:\n1.  Gestational age on 2025-09-15 is 79 days.\n2.  The EDD, expressed as an ordinal day-of-year number in 2026, is 94.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a single row matrix.",

            "introduction": "Once the pregnancy is accurately dated, routine prenatal care is structured around a standard schedule of visits designed to provide timely screening and assessment at key gestational milestones. This practice reinforces the evidence-based visit frequency recommended by organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

            "problem": "A healthy nulliparous patient with an uncomplicated singleton gestation presents for prenatal care. The first day of her Last Menstrual Period (LMP) is Monday, January 6, 2025. Gestational age is defined in the usual obstetric manner as the time elapsed from the first day of the LMP, with 1 week equal to 7 days, so that a gestational age of $w$ weeks $d$ days corresponds to $7w + d$ days after the LMP. The practice follows the standard schedule used by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG): routine visits occur every 4 weeks up to and including 28 weeks 0 days, then every 2 weeks strictly after 28 weeks 0 days up to and including 36 weeks 0 days, and then every 1 week strictly after 36 weeks 0 days until delivery. Prenatal care is initiated at exactly 8 weeks 0 days with the first routine visit. Visits are scheduled at exact whole-week gestational ages that respect the stated intervals and boundaries, aligned so that the first visit occurs at 8 weeks 0 days; for example, the 4-weekly segment thus includes 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 weeks 0 days, the 2-weekly segment includes 30, 32, 34, and 36 weeks 0 days, and the weekly segment includes 37, 38, 39, and so on. The pregnancy remains uncomplicated and continues through at least 40 weeks 3 days, and the delivery encounter itself is excluded from the count of routine prenatal visits.\n\nUsing the Gregorian calendar for the year 2025 (with February having 28 days), generate the complete calendar of routine prenatal visit dates implied by these rules by mapping each whole-week gestational target $w$ to the calendar date $D(w)$ defined by $D(w) =$ LMP date $+ 7w$ days. Then compute the total number of routine prenatal visits scheduled before delivery. Express the final answer as a single integer (no units).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the total number of routine prenatal visits for a patient with an uncomplicated pregnancy, based on a specified schedule and timeline. The first step, problem validation, has been completed and the problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution involves three main steps:\n1.  Identifying the exact gestational ages for all routine visits based on the provided schedule.\n2.  Calculating the calendar date for each of these visits.\n3.  Summing the total number of visits that are scheduled to occur within the specified minimum duration of the pregnancy.\n\nThe last menstrual period (LMP) is on Monday, January 6, 2025. This date serves as the reference point for all gestational age calculations. A visit at gestational age $w$ weeks and $d$ days occurs on a date that is $7w + d$ days after the LMP. All routine visits are scheduled at exact whole-week gestational ages, i.e., $d=0$.\n\nThe visit schedule is defined in three phases:\n1.  Every 4 weeks, starting from the first visit at 8 weeks 0 days, up to and including 28 weeks 0 days.\n2.  Every 2 weeks, strictly after 28 weeks 0 days, up to and including 36 weeks 0 days.\n3.  Every 1 week, strictly after 36 weeks 0 days, until delivery.\n\nThe pregnancy is stated to continue through at least 40 weeks and 3 days. This means we must count all visits scheduled up to and including the visit at 40 weeks 0 days. The visit at 40 weeks 0 days takes place $7 \\times 40 = 280$ days after the LMP. The pregnancy continues for at least $7 \\times 40 + 3 = 283$ days. Since day 280 is before day 283, the 40-week visit is included in our count. The next scheduled visit would be at 41 weeks 0 days, which is $7 \\times 41 = 287$ days after LMP. As the pregnancy is only known to continue until day 283, we cannot assume the 41-week visit occurs. Therefore, our count stops at the 40-week visit.\n\nLet us enumerate the visits based on these rules.\n\nPhase 1: Visits every 4 weeks from 8 to 28 weeks.\nThe gestational ages ($w$) for these visits are $w = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28$.\nThe number of visits in this phase is $N_1 = \\frac{28-8}{4} + 1 = 6$.\n\nPhase 2: Visits every 2 weeks from 30 to 36 weeks.\nThe schedule is \"strictly after 28 weeks 0 days\", so the first visit in this series is at 30 weeks.\nThe gestational ages for these visits are $w = 30, 32, 34, 36$.\nThe number of visits in this phase is $N_2 = \\frac{36-30}{2} + 1 = 4$.\n\nPhase 3: Visits every 1 week from 37 to 40 weeks.\nThe schedule is \"strictly after 36 weeks 0 days\". The pregnancy continues through at least 40 weeks 3 days.\nThe gestational ages for these visits are $w = 37, 38, 39, 40$.\nThe number of visits in this phase is $N_3 = \\frac{40-37}{1} + 1 = 4$.\n\nThe total number of routine prenatal visits is the sum $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14$.\n\nAs per the problem statement, we will also generate the calendar of these 14 visit dates. The year 2025 is a non-leap year, so February has 28 days. The LMP date is January 6, 2025. A visit at week $w$ occurs $7w$ days after this date. Since the LMP is a Monday, and each interval is a multiple of 7 days, all visits will fall on a Monday.\n\nWe calculate the date for each of the 14 visits:\n- Visit 1 ($w=8$): January 6, 2025 + 56 days $\\rightarrow$ March 3, 2025.\n- Visit 2 ($w=12$): January 6, 2025 + 84 days $\\rightarrow$ March 31, 2025.\n- Visit 3 ($w=16$): January 6, 2025 + 112 days $\\rightarrow$ April 28, 2025.\n- Visit 4 ($w=20$): January 6, 2025 + 140 days $\\rightarrow$ May 26, 2025.\n- Visit 5 ($w=24$): January 6, 2025 + 168 days $\\rightarrow$ June 23, 2025.\n- Visit 6 ($w=28$): January 6, 2025 + 196 days $\\rightarrow$ July 21, 2025.\n- Visit 7 ($w=30$): January 6, 2025 + 210 days $\\rightarrow$ August 4, 2025.\n- Visit 8 ($w=32$): January 6, 2025 + 224 days $\\rightarrow$ August 18, 2025.\n- Visit 9 ($w=34$): January 6, 2025 + 238 days $\\rightarrow$ September 1, 2025.\n- Visit 10 ($w=36$): January 6, 2025 + 252 days $\\rightarrow$ September 15, 2025.\n- Visit 11 ($w=37$): January 6, 2025 + 259 days $\\rightarrow$ September 22, 2025.\n- Visit 12 ($w=38$): January 6, 2025 + 266 days $\\rightarrow$ September 29, 2025.\n- Visit 13 ($w=39$): January 6, 2025 + 273 days $\\rightarrow$ October 6, 2025.\n- Visit 14 ($w=40$): January 6, 2025 + 280 days $\\rightarrow$ October 13, 2025.\n\nThe enumeration is complete and the logic is consistent with all constraints provided in the problem statement. The total number of visits is 14.",

            "introduction": "Modern antepartum care relies heavily on interpreting screening tests to assess risk and guide management. This practice moves beyond simple scheduling to the critical task of probabilistic reasoning, a core skill in evidence-based medicine.

            "problem": "A gravida 1 para 0 patient aged 36 years presents at her initial routine prenatal visit at gestational age 11 weeks. As part of routine antepartum care, she elects screening for fetal trisomy 21 using cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA).

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability of a condition (fetal trisomy 21) given a positive screening test result, and a subsequent decision based on this probability. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and translate the given information into probabilistic terms.\nLet $D$ be the event that the fetus has trisomy 21.\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event that the fetus does not have trisomy 21.\nLet $+$ be the event that the cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) test result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The pretest (baseline) probability of trisomy 21: $P(D) = p_{0} = \\frac{1}{270}$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive result given the presence of the condition: $S = P(+|D) = 0.994$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative result given the absence of the condition: $C = P(-|D^c) = 0.9992$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive two other necessary probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the condition: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\frac{1}{270} = \\frac{269}{270}$.\n- The false positive rate (FPR), which is the probability of a positive result given the absence of the condition: $P(+|D^c) = 1 - P(-|D^c) = 1 - C = 1 - 0.9992 = 0.0008$.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is the posterior probability, $p_{\\text{post}}$, which is the probability that the fetus has trisomy 21 given that the test result is positive, i.e., $P(D|+)$.\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result.
