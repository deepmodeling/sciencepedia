            "problem": "A postpartum patient at day $14$ is transitioning into mature lactation. Let $P(t)$ denote the instantaneous milk production capacity of the mammary gland (aggregated across alveoli), measured as milliliters per day. Clinical and physiological observations suggest two robust facts relevant to lactation support and breastfeeding problem management: (i) milk removal events trigger bursts of Prolactin (PRL), with each event causing an average increment in production capacity due to upregulation of synthesis pathways; (ii) in the absence of removal, stored milk and the Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL) mediate a downregulation that returns capacity toward a lower baseline on a timescale of days. Assume the following:\n- Milk removal events are stochastic and can be modeled as occurring according to a Poisson process with instantaneous rate $R(t)$ in events per day.\n- The expected increment in production capacity per removal event is a constant $\\alpha$ in milliliters per day per event and does not depend on the current $P(t)$.\n- The downregulation acts continuously and is proportional to the current capacity with rate constant $\\beta$ in day$^{-1}$.\n- The timescale of adaptation is slow enough to justify a continuous-time mean-field model for the expected value of $P(t)$.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the definition of the Poisson process, derive a first-principles, linear differential equation for the expected dynamics of $P(t)$ that links milk removal frequency $R(t)$ to the rate of change of milk production capacity. Then, for the case of constant removal frequency $R(t) \\equiv R$ (events per day), solve for the steady-state production capacity $P^{*}$ such that $dP/dt = 0$.\n\nState clearly the units of all quantities: $P(t)$ in milliliters per day, $R$ in events per day, $\\alpha$ in milliliters per day per event, and $\\beta$ in day$^{-1}$. Express your final steady-state answer in milliliters per day as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$, $R$, and $\\beta$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to derive a differential equation for the expected milk production capacity, $P(t)$, and then solve for its steady-state value under a constant milk removal frequency. The derivation will be based on the physiological principles and mathematical assumptions provided.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- $P(t)$: Instantaneous milk production capacity in milliliters per day (mL/day).\n- Patient is at day $14$ postpartum.\n- Milk removal events are modeled as a Poisson process with instantaneous rate $R(t)$ in events per day.\n- The expected increment in production capacity per removal event is a constant, $\\alpha$, in milliliters per day per event ((mL/day)/event).\n- Downregulation is continuous and proportional to the current capacity $P(t)$ with a rate constant $\\beta$ in day$^{-1}$.\n- A continuous-time mean-field model for the expected value of $P(t)$ is assumed to be valid.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem statement is based on established physiological principles of lactation, namely the stimulatory effect of milk removal (mediated by prolactin) and the inhibitory effect of milk stasis (mediated by FIL). The use of a rate equation to model these competing processes is a standard and scientifically sound approach in quantitative biology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of assumptions and definitions from which a unique mathematical model can be derived. The subsequent task of finding a steady-state solution is a standard analysis of such a model.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Differential Equation\nWe aim to construct a differential equation for the rate of change of the expected milk production capacity, $\\frac{d P(t)}{dt}$. The problem states that the model is for the *expected value* of $P(t)$, which we will denote simply as $P(t)$ in line with the mean-field approximation. The total rate of change of $P(t)$ is the sum of the rate of upregulation (increase) and the rate of downregulation (decrease).\n\n$1$. **Upregulation Term:**\nMilk removal events, which stimulate production, are modeled as a Poisson process with rate $R(t)$ events per day. For a Poisson process, the expected number of events in a small time interval $dt$ is $R(t) dt$.\nEach event contributes an expected increment of $\\alpha$ to the production capacity.\nTherefore, the total expected increase in production capacity over the interval $dt$ is the product of the expected number of events and the expected increment per event:\n$$ \\text{Expected Increase in } P(t) \\text{ over } dt = \\alpha \\cdot (R(t) dt) $$\nThe rate of increase is this quantity divided by $dt$, which gives the upregulation rate:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Upregulation} = \\alpha R(t) $$\nThe units of this term are $\\left(\\frac{\\text{mL}/\\text{day}}{\\text{event}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{events}}{\\text{day}}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{day}^2}$, which are the correct units for a rate of change of capacity (capacity being in mL/day).\n\n$2$. **Downregulation Term:**\nThe downregulation is a continuous process that is proportional to the current capacity $P(t)$ with a rate constant $\\beta$. This represents a first-order decay or degradation process. The rate of decrease is therefore directly proportional to $P(t)$:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Downregulation} = -\\beta P(t) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that this process reduces the production capacity. The units of this term are $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{day}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{day}}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{day}^2}$, consistent with the upregulation term.\n\n$3$. **Combining the Terms:**\nThe net rate of change of the production capacity, $\\frac{dP(t)}{dt}$, is the sum of the upregulation and downregulation rates:\n$$ \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\alpha R(t) - \\beta P(t) $$\nThis is the first-principles, linear ordinary differential equation for the expected dynamics of $P(t)$, as required by the problem.\n\n### Calculation of the Steady-State Production Capacity\nNext, we consider the specific case where the milk removal frequency is constant, i.e., $R(t) = R$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\alpha R - \\beta P(t) $$\nThe steady state is the condition where the system is in equilibrium, and the production capacity no longer changes with time. This is defined by setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 $$\nLet $P^*$ denote the steady-state production capacity. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$ 0 = \\alpha R - \\beta P^* $$\nWe can now solve for $P^*$:\n$$ \\beta P^* = \\alpha R $$\n$$ P^* = \\frac{\\alpha R}{\\beta} $$\nThis expression represents the steady-state milk production capacity in terms of the frequency of removal ($R$), the strength of the stimulatory signal per removal ($\\alpha$), and the rate constant of endogenous inhibition ($\\beta$). The units of the expression are:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\text{mL}/\\text{day}}{\\text{event}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{events}}{\\text{day}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{day}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{day}^2}}{\\frac{1}{\\text{day}}} = \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{day}} $$\nThe units are correct, matching the units of production capacity $P(t)$.",

The corresponding displayed weights are given as $W_{d,pre} = 3645$ g and $W_{d,post} = 3678$ g.

Let $X = \\epsilon_{post}$ and $Y = -\\epsilon_{pre}$. Since $\\epsilon_{pre} \\sim U[-1, 1]$, the random variable $Y$ is also distributed as $U[-1, 1]$. Because $\\epsilon_{pre}$ and $\\epsilon_{post}$ are independent, so are $X$ and $Y$. Thus, $\\epsilon_I$ is the sum of two independent and identically distributed random variables, $X, Y \\sim U[-1, 1]$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of $\\epsilon_I = X+Y$, denoted $f_{\\epsilon_I}(z)$, is the convolution of the PDFs of $X$ and $Y$. The PDF for a $U[-1, 1]$ distribution is $f(u) = 1/2$ for $u \\in [-1, 1]$ and $0$ otherwise.\nThe convolution integral is:\n$$ f_{\\epsilon_I}(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_X(x) f_Y(z-x) \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{2} f_Y(z-x) \\,dx $$\nFor the integrand to be non-zero, we need $-1 \\le z-x \\le 1$, which implies $z-1 \\le x \\le z+1$.

We must choose the negative root.\n$$ c = 2 - \\sqrt{0.2} $$\nThe statement $P(-c \\le \\epsilon_I \\le c) = 0.95$ can be rewritten using $\\epsilon_I = I_e - I_t$:\n$$ P(-c \\le I_e - I_t \\le c) = 0.95 $$\n$$ P(-I_e - c \\le -I_t \\le -I_e + c) = 0.95 $$\n$$ P(I_e - c \\le I_t \\le I_e + c) = 0.95 $$\nThus, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true intake $I_t$ is $[I_e - c, I_e + c]$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nThe intake point estimate is $I_e = 33$ g.\nThe value of $c$ is:\n$$ c = 2 - \\sqrt{0.2} \\approx 2 - 0.4472136 = 1.5527864 \\text{ g} $$\nThe lower confidence bound (LCB) is:\n$$ \\text{LCB} = I_e - c = 33 - (2 - \\sqrt{0.2}) = 31 + \\sqrt{0.2} \\approx 31.4472136 \\text{ g} $$\nThe upper confidence bound (UCB) is:\n$$ \\text{UCB} = I_e + c = 33 + (2 - \\sqrt{0.2}) = 35 - \\sqrt{0.2} \\approx 34.5527864 \\text{ g} $$\nRounding the final numeric entries to four significant figures:\n- Intake point estimate: $I_e = 33.00$ g.\n- Lower confidence bound: $\\text{LCB} \\approx 31.45$ g.\n- Upper confidence bound: $\\text{UCB} \\approx 34.55$ g.\n\nThe requested values are the intake point estimate, the lower confidence bound, and the upper confidence bound, in that order, expressed in grams and rounded to four significant figures.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested: determining the minimal dose $D$ and verifying the Relative Infant Dose (RID).\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Minimal Dose ($D$)**\n\nAt steady state, the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. The average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, is given by the ratio of the bioavailable dosing rate to the systemic clearance.\n\nThe dosing rate is the dose $D$ administered every $\\tau$ hours. The bioavailable fraction is $F_m$. Therefore, the bioavailable dosing rate is $\\frac{D \\cdot F_m}{\\tau}$.\n\nThe relationship is expressed as:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{D \\cdot F_m}{\\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}$$\n\nThe problem requires achieving a target concentration $C_{\\text{target}} = 10\\,\\text{mg/L}$. To find the minimal dose $D$, we set the average steady-state concentration equal to this target threshold:\n$$C_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{D \\cdot F_m}{\\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}$$\n\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the dose, $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}{F_m}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 10\\,\\text{mg/L}$\n-   $\\text{CL} = 5.0\\,\\text{L/h}$\n-   $\\tau = 8\\,\\text{h}$\n-   $F_m = 0.90$\n\n$$D = \\frac{(10\\,\\text{mg/L}) \\cdot (5.0\\,\\text{L/h}) \\cdot (8\\,\\text{h})}{0.90} = \\frac{400}{0.90}\\,\\text{mg} \\approx 444.44...\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nSo, the minimal dose required is approximately $444.44\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Verification of the Relative Infant Dose (RID)**\n\nThe problem defines the RID as the ratio of the infant's daily dose (in mg/kg/day) to the mother's daily dose (in mg/kg/day).\n$$\\text{RID} = \\frac{\\text{Infant Dose}_{\\text{mg/kg/day}}}{\\text{Maternal Dose}_{\\text{mg/kg/day}}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maternal daily dose. The mother takes a dose $D$ every $\\tau = 8\\,\\text{h}$. The number of doses in a $24$-hour period is $\\frac{24\\,\\text{h}}{8\\,\\text{h}} = 3$.\nThe total daily administered dose to the mother is $3D$.\nTo express this per unit of body mass, we divide by the maternal weight $W_m = 70\\,\\text{kg}$.\n$$\\text{Maternal Dose}_{\\text{mg/kg/day}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot D}{W_m} = \\frac{3 \\cdot (400/0.90)\\,\\text{mg}}{70\\,\\text{kg}} = \\frac{1200 / 0.90}{70}\\,\\text{mg/kg/day} = \\frac{400}{21}\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$$\n$$\\text{Maternal Dose}_{\\text{mg/kg/day}} \\approx 19.048\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the infant's daily dose received via milk. This is based on the average drug concentration in milk, $C_{\\text{milk,avg}}$, and the infant's daily milk intake rate. The infant oral bioavailability, $F_i$, is not used in the standard definition of RID, which concerns the dose ingested by the infant.\nThe average concentration in milk is related to the average maternal plasma concentration by the M/P ratio:\n$$C_{\\text{milk,avg}} = C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\cdot (\\text{M/P})$$\nUsing $C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = C_{\\text{target}} = 10\\,\\text{mg/L}$ and $\\text{M/P} = 0.020$:\n$$C_{\\text{milk,avg}} = (10\\,\\text{mg/L}) \\cdot (0.020) = 0.20\\,\\text{mg/L}$$\n\nThe infant's daily milk intake is given as $0.15\\,\\text{L/kg/day}$. The infant's daily dose is the product of the milk concentration and the intake rate:\n$$\\text{Infant Dose}_{\\text{mg/kg/day}} = C_{\\text{milk,avg}} \\cdot (\\text{Intake Rate}) = (0.20\\,\\text{mg/L}) \\cdot (0.15\\,\\text{L/kg/day}) = 0.030\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the RID:\n$$\\text{RID} = \\frac{0.030\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}}{400/21\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}} = \\frac{0.030 \\cdot 21}{400} = \\frac{0.63}{400} = 0.001575$$\n\nAlternatively, a general expression for RID can be derived by substituting the symbolic expressions. This shows that RID is independent of the dose $D$ or target concentration $C_{\\text{target}}$ under linear kinetics.\n$$\\text{RID} = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\cdot (\\text{M/P}) \\cdot (\\text{Intake Rate})}{\\frac{D \\cdot (24/\\tau)}{W_m}}$$\nSubstituting $D = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\cdot \\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}{F_m}$:\n$$\\text{RID} = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\cdot (\\text{M/P}) \\cdot (\\text{Intake Rate})}{\\frac{(\\frac{C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\cdot \\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}{F_m}) \\cdot (24/\\tau)}{W_m}} = \\frac{(\\text{M/P}) \\cdot (\\text{Intake Rate}) \\cdot F_m \\cdot W_m}{\\text{CL} \\cdot 24}$$\nSubstituting values:\n$$\\text{RID} = \\frac{(0.020) \\cdot (0.15\\,\\text{L/kg/day}) \\cdot (0.90) \\cdot (70\\,\\text{kg})}{(5.0\\,\\text{L/h}) \\cdot (24\\,\\text{h/day})} = \\frac{0.189}{120} = 0.001575$$\nThis confirms the previous calculation.\n\nThe final step is to verify if this value satisfies the safety condition $\\text{RID} < 0.1$.\n$$0.001575 < 0.1$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The calculated RID is approximately $0.16\\%$, which is well below the common safety threshold of $10\\%$.\n\nThe problem asks for the single numerical value of the minimal per-dose amount $D$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D = 444.44...\\,\\text{mg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $D = 444\\,\\text{mg}$.",
