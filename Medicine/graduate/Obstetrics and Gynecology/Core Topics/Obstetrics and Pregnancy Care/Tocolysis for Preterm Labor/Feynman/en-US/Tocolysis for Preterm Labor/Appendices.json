In the control arm (no tocolysis), the observed probability of delivery within the next $48$ hours is $0.6$. The trial reports a relative risk for delivery within $48$ hours with atosiban versus no tocolysis of $0.75$, and assumes that this relative effect is homogeneous across the baseline risk.\n\nUsing only standard epidemiologic definitions of risk, relative risk, absolute risk reduction, and number needed to treat, determine the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat for atosiban to prevent one delivery within $48$ hours compared to no tocolysis in this population.\n\nProvide your final result as a pair in the order: absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat, based on provided clinical trial data. We will use standard epidemiological definitions for these metrics.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant quantities:\n- Let $R_c$ be the risk of the outcome (delivery within $48$ hours) in the control group (no tocolysis).\n- Let $R_t$ be the risk of the outcome in the treatment group (atosiban).\n- The Relative Risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the control group:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_t}{R_c}$$\n- The Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the absolute difference in risk between the control and treatment groups:\n$$ARR = R_c - R_t$$\n- The Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nAn important condition for the $NNT$ to be meaningful is that $R_c > R_t$, which implies $ARR > 0$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The risk in the control arm, $R_c = 0.6$.\n- The relative risk for the atosiban group versus the control group, $RR = 0.75$.\n\nOur objective is to compute $ARR$ and $NNT$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the risk in the treatment group, $R_t$. We can rearrange the formula for relative risk:\n$$R_t = RR \\times R_c$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_t = 0.75 \\times 0.6$$\nTo ensure precision, we can use fractional representation:\n$$R_t = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{18}{40} = \\frac{9}{20}$$\nConverting this back to a decimal gives:\n$$R_t = 0.45$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) using its definition:\n$$ARR = R_c - R_t$$\nSubstituting the values for $R_c$ and the calculated $R_t$:\n$$ARR = 0.6 - 0.45 = 0.15$$\nThis value is exact. As a fraction, $ARR = \\frac{6}{10} - \\frac{45}{100} = \\frac{60}{100} - \\frac{45}{100} = \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{3}{20}$. The decimal representation $0.15$ is exact and thus acceptable.\n\nFinally, we calculate the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) as the reciprocal of the $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the value of $ARR = 0.15$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{15}{100}} = \\frac{100}{15}$$\nTo express this in its simplest exact form, we reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{100 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\nThis is an improper fraction representing a repeating decimal ($6.666...$), so the fractional form $\\frac{20}{3}$ is the required exact representation.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat, in that order.\n- Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) = $0.15$\n- Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) = $\\frac{20}{3}$",

Management Algorithm: For sepsis or suspected intraamniotic infection with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM), prioritize source control (delivery) and antimicrobial therapy.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem describes a classic clinical scenario in obstetrics. The patient's presentation—preterm labor with PPROM, fever ($38.3^\\circ\\text{C}$), maternal tachycardia ($112$ bpm), fetal tachycardia ($170$ bpm), uterine tenderness, leukocytosis ($17{,}500$ per $\\text{mm}^3$), and elevated CRP ($72$ $\\text{mg/L}$)—are all hallmark signs and symptoms of intraamniotic infection (IAI), or chorioamnionitis. The provided foundational bases are accurate representations of established medical principles. The data are internally consistent and sufficient to formulate a diagnosis and management plan. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and does not violate any of the listed invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **VALID**. A solution will be derived based on the provided clinical data and foundational principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Management Strategy**\n\n1.  **Diagnosis:** The clinical picture is unequivocally that of PPROM and preterm labor complicated by intraamniotic infection (chorioamnionitis). The patient meets multiple diagnostic criteria:\n    - Maternal fever ($38.3^\\circ\\text{C}$).\n    - Maternal leukocytosis ($17{,}500$ per $\\text{mm}^3$).\n    - Maternal tachycardia ($112$ bpm).\n    - Fetal tachycardia ($170$ bpm).\n    - Uterine tenderness.\n    - Malodorous amniotic fluid.\n    - Furthermore, the patient meets all four given criteria for SIRS in pregnancy, indicating significant systemic inflammation.\n\n2.  **Application of Principles:**\n    - The second principle explains that the contractions are a direct consequence of the infection. Therefore, addressing the infection is paramount.\n    - The third principle explicitly states that tocolysis (the use of medications to suppress uterine contractions) is contraindicated in the setting of suspected IAI. Attempting to stop labor would prolong the exposure of both mother and fetus to a harmful infectious environment, increasing the risk of maternal sepsis, postpartum complications, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n    - The fourth principle dictates the required course of action: treatment of the infection with antimicrobial agents and definitive source control. In IAI, the source of infection is the contents of the uterus. Thus, `source control` is synonymous with `delivery of the fetus and placenta`.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of the Optimal Plan:** Based on this reasoning, the correct management strategy for this patient must include:\n    - Immediate initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection.\n    - Complete avoidance of tocolytic agents.\n    - Expedited delivery to remove the source of infection. The goal is not to prolong the pregnancy.\n    - Supportive care for the mother (e.g., antipyretics, intravenous fluids) and continuous electronic fetal monitoring to assess for worsening fetal status, which may necessitate a more urgent (e.g., cesarean) delivery.\n    - Administration of magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection is appropriate given the gestational age ($32$ weeks) and anticipated imminent delivery, but it is not a tocolytic and should not be used to delay delivery.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n-   **A. Administer indomethacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, begin expectant management for $48$ hours to complete antenatal corticosteroids, and reassess after contraction suppression.**\n    Indomethacin is a tocolytic agent. Its use is contraindicated (Principle 3). Attempting expectant management for $48$ hours to allow for corticosteroid benefit is also contraindicated, as it would unacceptably delay delivery in the face of an active, severe infection (Principle 4). The risks of ongoing infection far outweigh the benefits of steroids in this scenario.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. Begin broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, obtain blood and amniotic fluid cultures, avoid tocolysis, and plan for delivery after maternal stabilization, with continuous fetal assessment.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with the derived management plan. It correctly prioritizes antibiotics to treat the infection, avoids contraindicated tocolysis, and plans for delivery as the definitive treatment (source control). Obtaining cultures is standard practice, and continuous fetal monitoring is essential.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **C. Initiate beta-adrenergic agonist tocolysis to suppress contractions and defer antibiotics until the patient is afebrile in order to avoid masking signs of worsening infection.**\n    This approach is fundamentally flawed and dangerous. It advocates for tocolysis, which is contraindicated (Principle 3). Critically, it proposes delaying antibiotics, which would allow the infection to progress unchecked, increasing the risk of severe maternal and fetal harm. The rationale to \"avoid masking signs\" is medically unsound; the goal is to treat the disease, not merely observe its manifestations.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Administer nifedipine to suppress contractions while closely monitoring for infection and continue observation until contractions cease; start antibiotics only if fever persists beyond $24$ hours.**\n    Similar to options A and C, this option incorrectly proposes tocolysis (using nifedipine). It also dangerously recommends delaying antibiotics despite overwhelming evidence of an existing infection. Waiting an additional $24$ hours for a persistent fever would constitute a significant and harmful delay in care.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Give magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection and continue tocolysis with a calcium channel blocker to prolong gestation to $34$ weeks before delivery.**\n    While magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection is appropriate for imminent preterm birth at this gestational age, its use is coupled here with an incorrect strategy. The primary error is the plan to use tocolysis to \"prolong gestation to $34$ weeks.\" This is a prolongation of over $4$ weeks, which is absolutely contraindicated in the setting of chorioamnionitis and would likely have catastrophic outcomes for both mother and fetus. The primary goal must be delivery, not prolongation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Magnesium sulfate is a commonly used medication in obstetrics for both tocolysis (historically) and fetal neuroprotection (current standard of care). The described signs and symptoms—loss of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression, somnolence, and oliguria—are classic manifestations of magnesium toxicity (hypermagnesemia). The mechanism involves magnesium's role as a physiological calcium antagonist at the presynaptic nerve terminal, inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. This leads to muscle weakness and respiratory compromise. The doses provided are standard. The entire scenario is clinically realistic and scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear clinical scenario with sufficient data to identify a specific medical emergency (magnesium toxicity) and asks for the established, standard-of-care management. A unique and correct course of action can be determined based on established medical guidelines.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical language and data (e.g., RR $10$/minute, DTR $0$, UO $20$ mL). It is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity. It is a valid, well-constructed clinical problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe patient is presenting with acute magnesium sulfate toxicity. The therapeutic serum magnesium concentration for preeclampsia seizure prophylaxis or fetal neuroprotection is typically targeted at $4$ to $7$ mEq/L (or approximately $4.8$ to $8.4$ mg/dL). Clinical signs of toxicity correlate with rising serum levels:\n*   Loss of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs): Occurs at approximately $7$ to $10$ mEq/L. The patient has absent DTRs ($0$).\n*   Respiratory depression: Occurs at approximately $10$ to $12$ mEq/L. The patient's respiratory rate is $10$/minute, which is critically low (normal is $12-20$/minute) and indicates significant respiratory depression.\n*   Cardiac arrest: Can occur at levels exceeding $12$ mEq/L.\n\nThe patient also exhibits oliguria (urine output of $20$ mL/hour, which is less than the standard threshold of $30$ mL/hour). Since magnesium is cleared exclusively by the kidneys, decreased urine output will lead to accumulation of magnesium, further exacerbating the toxicity. The patient's somnolence is a sign of central nervous system depression.\n\nGiven these life-threatening signs, the immediate management priorities are:\n1.  **Cessation of the causative agent**: The magnesium sulfate infusion must be stopped immediately.\n2.  **Administration of the specific antidote**: Calcium is the direct physiological antagonist to magnesium at the neuromuscular junction. Intravenous calcium gluconate is the treatment of choice. It reverses the respiratory depression and heart block associated with severe hypermagnesemia. The standard dose is $1$ gram of calcium gluconate ($10$ mL of a $10\\%$ solution) administered intravenously over $5$ to $10$ minutes.\n3.  **Supportive care**: The most immediate threat to life is respiratory arrest. Therefore, airway management is critical. This includes providing supplemental oxygen and preparing for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory effort does not improve or worsens.\n4.  **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of vital signs (especially RR), DTRs, level of consciousness, and urine output is essential to guide further management.\n\nStandard clinical practice also defines clear safety thresholds for withholding or discontinuing magnesium sulfate infusion to prevent the development of toxicity. These thresholds are:\n*   Respiratory rate $ 12$/minute.\n*   Absent deep tendon reflexes.\n*   Urine output $ 30$ mL/hour.\n*   Significant drop in blood pressure.\n*   Altered level of consciousness.\n*   Serum magnesium level exceeding the therapeutic range (e.g., $ 8$ mEq/L or $\\approx 9$ mg/dL).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Immediately stop magnesium infusion; administer intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate $10$ mL of $10\\%$ solution ($\\approx 1$ g) over $10$ minutes; provide airway support with supplemental oxygen and prepare for assisted ventilation if RR remains $12$/minute; reassess DTR and urine output; and hold magnesium whenever RR $12$/minute, DTR are absent, urine output $30$ mL/hour, or serum magnesium is $\\geq 8$ mEq/L (approximately $\\geq 9$ mg/dL).**\n\n*   **Stop infusion**: Correct. This is the first and most crucial step.\n*   **Administer calcium gluconate**: Correct. This is the specific antidote, given at the correct dose and rate.\n*   **Airway support**: Correct. This addresses the most life-threatening complication.\n*   **Reassessment**: Correct. Close monitoring is essential.\n*   **Cessation thresholds**: Correct. These are the universally accepted clinical safety parameters for magnesium sulfate administration. The serum level conversion ($8$ mEq/L $\\approx 9$ mg/dL, more precisely $9.7$ mg/dL) is appropriate for a clinical threshold.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**. This option outlines the complete and accurate standard of care for managing magnesium toxicity.\n\n**B. Reduce magnesium infusion by $50\\%$; administer naloxone $0.4$ mg IV for somnolence; continue magnesium unless heart rate is $60$/minute; thresholds for cessation should focus on systolic blood pressure $90$ mmHg.**\n\n*   **Reduce infusion by $50\\%$**: Incorrect. In the presence of life-threatening toxicity (RR $10$/min, absent DTRs), the infusion must be stopped completely, not merely reduced.\n*   **Administer naloxone**: Incorrect. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. The patient's somnolence is due to hypermagnesemia, and the problem explicitly states no opioids were given.\n*   **HR threshold**: Incorrect. Bradycardia is a very late sign of severe toxicity. Relying on this parameter is dangerous.\n*   **BP threshold**: Incorrect. While hypotension is a concern, respiratory arrest is the more immediate danger, and thresholds based on RR, DTRs, and UO are paramount.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Continue magnesium infusion to maintain uterine quiescence; add oral nifedipine $20$ mg immediately; reserve cessation of magnesium only if mean arterial pressure drops $65$ mmHg or oxygen saturation is $85\\%$; do not administer calcium antidote due to risk of uterine irritability.**\n\n*   **Continue infusion**: Incorrect. This is extremely dangerous and would worsen the toxicity.\n*   **Add nifedipine**: Incorrect. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker and can potentiate the neuromuscular blockade and hypotensive effects of magnesium.\n*   **Cessation thresholds**: Incorrect. These are dangerously late thresholds. A drop in SpO2 to $85\\%$ is a pre-arrest state.\n*   **Withhold calcium**: Incorrect. Preventing maternal respiratory/cardiac arrest is the absolute priority. The risk of uterine irritability is a secondary concern and does not justify withholding a life-saving antidote.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Administer IV furosemide $20$ mg to enhance magnesium excretion; continue magnesium at a reduced rate; provide oxygen by nasal cannula; hold magnesium only if RR $8$/minute or urine output $10$ mL/hour; avoid calcium because it may precipitate arrhythmias.**\n\n*   **Administer furosemide**: Incorrect as a primary intervention. Furosemide-induced diuresis can enhance magnesium excretion, but it is not rapid enough for acute toxicity and is secondary to stopping the infusion and administering the antidote.\n*   **Continue infusion at reduced rate**: Incorrect. The infusion must be stopped.\n*   **Cessation thresholds**: Incorrect. These thresholds ($RR  8$, $UO  10$) are far too low and represent a state of profound toxicity, bordering on arrest.\n*   **Avoid calcium**: Incorrect. The justification is false. While a rapid IV push of calcium can be arrhythmogenic, slow infusion (as is standard practice) is safe. In fact, calcium is used to treat arrhythmias caused by hypermagnesemia.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Administer IV calcium chloride $10$ mL of $10\\%$ solution through a peripheral line; continue magnesium but switch to terbutaline $0.25$ mg subcutaneously; do not use DTR or urine output as cessation thresholds; use a fixed serum magnesium cutoff of $12$ mg/dL only.**\n\n*   **Calcium chloride in peripheral line**: Incorrect and dangerous practice. Calcium chloride is highly caustic and can cause severe tissue necrosis if it extravasates. It is preferentially given via a central line. Calcium gluconate is the standard for peripheral IV administration.\n*   **Continue magnesium and add terbutaline**: Incorrect. Continuing the toxic agent is wrong. Addressing tocolysis with another agent is a separate decision to be made only after the mother is stabilized.\n*   **Ignore DTR and UO**: Incorrect. These are essential clinical monitoring parameters. Ignoring them constitutes medical negligence.\n*   **Serum cutoff $12$ mg/dL**: Incorrect. This level is associated with respiratory arrest and potential cardiac arrest. Waiting for this level before acting is unacceptable. Clinical signs must be acted upon immediately.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
