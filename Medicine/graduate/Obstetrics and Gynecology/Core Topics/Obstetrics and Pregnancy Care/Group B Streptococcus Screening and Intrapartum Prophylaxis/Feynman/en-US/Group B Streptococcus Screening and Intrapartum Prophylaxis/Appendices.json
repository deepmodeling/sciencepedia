The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value are fundamental in medical statistics. The clinical context (GBS screening) and the numerical values provided are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($p$, $Se$, $Sp$) to calculate the requested quantity (Positive Predictive Value, PPV). The question is clear and leads to a single, unique, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nLet $C$ be the event that a patient is truly colonized with GBS. Let $T$ be the event that the screening assay returns a positive result. The complements, $C^c$ and $T^c$, represent the events of no colonization and a negative test, respectively.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n- The prevalence of GBS colonization is $P(C) = p = 0.25$.\n- The probability of not being colonized is $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- The sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is colonized: $P(T \\mid C) = Se = 0.90$.\n- The specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test given that the patient is not colonized: $P(T^c \\mid C^c) = Sp = 0.95$.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient is truly colonized given that they have a positive test result. This is written as $P(C \\mid T)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' rule):\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(C \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of being colonized and testing positive. It can be found by rearranging the definition of conditional probability $P(T \\mid C) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T)}{P(C)}$:\n$$P(C \\cap T) = P(T \\mid C) P(C) = Se \\cdot p$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, by considering the two mutually exclusive ways a positive test can occur: a true positive (patient is colonized and tests positive) and a false positive (patient is not colonized but tests positive).\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap C) + P(T \\cap C^c)$$\nWe have already expressed the first term, $P(T \\cap C)$. The second term, $P(T \\cap C^c)$, is derived similarly:\n$$P(T \\cap C^c) = P(T \\mid C^c) P(C^c)$$\nHere, $P(T \\mid C^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given no colonization, which is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $Sp = P(T^c \\mid C^c)$:\n$$P(T \\mid C^c) = 1 - P(T^c \\mid C^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$P(T \\cap C^c) = (1 - Sp) P(C^c) = (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nNow, we can write the full expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap C) + P(T \\cap C^c) = (Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(C \\mid T)$:\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the derived formula for the positive predictive value from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $p=0.25$, $Se=0.90$, and $Sp=0.95$.\n- Numerator: $Se \\cdot p = 0.90 \\times 0.25 = 0.225$.\n- Denominator: $(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (0.90 \\times 0.25) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.25)$.\n- Denominator: $0.225 + (0.05)(0.75) = 0.225 + 0.0375 = 0.2625$.\n\nSo, the PPV is:\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{0.225}{0.2625}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to $\\frac{6}{7}$. Converting to a decimal:\n$$\\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.8571$.\n\n**Interpretation**\nA positive predictive value of $0.8571$ signifies that for a patient in this population who receives a positive GBS screening result at $36$–$37$ weeks' gestation, there is an $85.71\\%$ probability that she is truly colonized with GBS. In the context of intrapartum decision-making, this high PPV indicates that the test is a strong predictor of true GBS carrier status. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with early-onset neonatal GBS disease, and the relatively low risk of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), this level of certainty robustly supports the clinical guideline to administer IAP. Although there is a $1 - 0.8571 = 0.1429$ or $14.29\\%$ chance of a false positive (meaning the patient receives antibiotics unnecessarily), this is generally considered an acceptable trade-off to prevent the severe consequences of neonatal infection in the $85.71\\%$ of cases that are true positives.",

The risk of EONS in this case is $q_0$.\n    The overall probability of EONS in Strategy A, $P(EONS_A)$, is the probability of being a colonized mother ($p$) multiplied by the conditional probability of EONS given colonization:\n    $$\n    P(EONS_A) = p \\left[ q_1 \\cdot P(T+_A|C) + q_0 \\cdot P(T-_A|C) \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    P(EONS_A) = p \\left[ q_1 \\cdot Sens_A + q_0 (1 - Sens_A) \\right]\n    $$\n    Substituting $q_1 = r_R q_0$:\n    $$\n    P(EONS_A) = p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ r_R \\cdot Sens_A + (1 - Sens_A) \\right] = p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_A \\right]\n    $$\n    The expected EONS cost is $c_s \\cdot P(EONS_A)$:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{Cost}_{\\text{EONS}, A}] = c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_A \\right]\n    $$\n\nCombining these three components, the total expected cost for Strategy A is:\n$$\nC_A = c_t + c_a \\left[ p \\cdot Sens_A + (1 - p)(1 - Spec_A) \\right] + c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_A \\right]\n$$\n\n**Strategy B: Risk-Based Prophylaxis**\n\nThe expected cost for Strategy B, $C_B$, is derived similarly, but with $c_t = 0$ and using the sensitivity ($Sens_B$) and specificity ($Spec_B$) of the risk-criteria rule.\n\n1.  **Screening Cost**: There is no screening test, so the cost is $0$.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{Cost}_{\\text{screening}, B}] = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Antibiotic Cost**: Antibiotics are given to mothers meeting the risk criteria ($T+$). The probability of meeting the criteria, $P(T+_B)$, is:\n    $$\n    P(T+_B) = P(T+_B|C)P(C) + P(T+_B|\\bar{C})P(\\bar{C}) = Sens_B \\cdot p + (1 - Spec_B)(1 - p)\n    $$\n    The expected antibiotic cost is:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{Cost}_{\\text{antibiotics}, B}] = c_a \\left[ p \\cdot Sens_B + (1 - p)(1 - Spec_B) \\right]\n    $$\n\n3.  **EONS Cost**: The derivation is identical in form to Strategy A, but with the parameters for Strategy B.\n    $$\n    P(EONS_B) = p \\left[ q_1 \\cdot Sens_B + q_0 (1 - Sens_B) \\right] = p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_B \\right]\n    $$\n    The expected EONS cost is:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{Cost}_{\\text{EONS}, B}] = c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_B \\right]\n    $$\n\nCombining the components, the total expected cost for Strategy B is:\n$$\nC_B = c_a \\left[ p \\cdot Sens_B + (1 - p)(1 - Spec_B) \\right] + c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_B \\right]\n$$\n\n### b) Calculation of Incremental Cost\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\Delta C = C_A - C_B$ using the provided parameter values.\n-   $p = 0.20$\n-   $c_t = 20$ USD\n-   $c_a = 50$ USD\n-   $c_s = 100000$ USD\n-   $q_0 = 0.015$\n-   $r_R = 0.20$\n-   Strategy A: $Sens_A = 0.90$, $Spec_A = 0.95$\n-   Strategy B: $Sens_B = 0.55$, $Spec_B = 0.85$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected cost for Strategy A, $C_A$.\n-   Cost of screening = $20$.\n-   Expected antibiotic cost:\n    $$\n    c_a \\left[ p \\cdot Sens_A + (1-p)(1 - Spec_A) \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.20 \\cdot 0.90 + (1-0.20)(1-0.95) \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.18 + 0.80 \\cdot 0.05 \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.18 + 0.04 \\right] = 50 \\cdot 0.22 = 11\n    $$\n-   Expected EONS cost:\n    $$\n    c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_A \\right] = 100000 \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 0.015 \\left[ 1 - (1 - 0.20) \\cdot 0.90 \\right] = 300 \\left[ 1 - 0.80 \\cdot 0.90 \\right] = 300 \\left[ 1 - 0.72 \\right] = 300 \\cdot 0.28 = 84\n    $$\n-   Total cost for Strategy A:\n    $$\n    C_A = 20 + 11 + 84 = 115 \\; \\text{USD}\n    $$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected cost for Strategy B, $C_B$.\n-   Cost of screening = $0$.\n-   Expected antibiotic cost:\n    $$\n    c_a \\left[ p \\cdot Sens_B + (1-p)(1 - Spec_B) \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.20 \\cdot 0.55 + (1-0.20)(1-0.85) \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.11 + 0.80 \\cdot 0.15 \\right] = 50 \\left[ 0.11 + 0.12 \\right] = 50 \\cdot 0.23 = 11.50\n    $$\n-   Expected EONS cost:\n    $$\n    c_s \\cdot p \\cdot q_0 \\left[ 1 - (1 - r_R) Sens_B \\right] = 100000 \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 0.015 \\left[ 1 - (1 - 0.20) \\cdot 0.55 \\right] = 300 \\left[ 1 - 0.80 \\cdot 0.55 \\right] = 300 \\left[ 1 - 0.44 \\right] = 300 \\cdot 0.56 = 168\n    $$\n-   Total cost for Strategy B:\n    $$\n    C_B = 0 + 11.50 + 168 = 179.50 \\; \\text{USD}\n    $$\n\nFinally, we compute the incremental cost, $\\Delta C = C_A - C_B$.\n$$\n\\Delta C = 115.00 - 179.50 = -64.50\n$$\nThe value is requested to three significant figures.
