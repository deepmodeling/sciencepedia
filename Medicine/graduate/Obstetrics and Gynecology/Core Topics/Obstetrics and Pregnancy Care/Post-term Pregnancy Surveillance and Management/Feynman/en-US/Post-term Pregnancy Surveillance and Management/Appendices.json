This exercise focuses on the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a powerful tool that helps us understand the real-world impact of an intervention.

            "problem": "A randomized comparison of routine induction of labor at $41$ completed weeks versus expectant management to $42$ weeks in otherwise low-risk singleton pregnancies reports an absolute risk difference in perinatal death defined as the risk in the expectant-management group minus the risk in the induction group of $0.9$ per $1{,}000$ births in favor of induction. In perinatal epidemiology, the absolute risk of an event is the individual-level probability of that event over a specified time window, and the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the difference in absolute risks between control and intervention. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the number of individuals who must receive the intervention (here, routine induction at $41$ weeks) to prevent one additional event (here, one perinatal death) compared with the control strategy (expectant management to $42$ weeks) over the same time window.\n\nStarting from these definitions and standard probability reasoning for independent outcomes across individuals, derive the functional dependence of $NNT$ on the Absolute Risk Reduction, and then compute the $NNT$ given the reported absolute risk difference of $0.9$ per $1{,}000$ births. Express the final answer as a count of pregnant individuals. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign anywhere in your working or final answer.",
