            "problem": "A gravida $2$ para $1$ patient in active labor with ruptured membranes for $12$ hours develops arrest of descent and is taken for an intrapartum cesarean delivery. To minimize maternal infectious morbidity—particularly Surgical Site Infection (SSI) and postpartum endometritis—peri-incision antibiotic prophylaxis is administered. Well-tested clinical guidance recommends weight-adjusted cefazolin at higher body mass to achieve adequate tissue concentrations above the pathogen minimal inhibitory concentration, and the addition of azithromycin when cesarean delivery occurs after labor or rupture of membranes.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- Volume of distribution and tissue antibiotic concentrations scale with body mass, so weight-based dosing is employed to achieve target pharmacodynamic exposure.\n- Widely accepted obstetric antibiotic prophylaxis guidance indicates cefazolin $3$ g intravenously (IV) when maternal weight is $\\geq 120$ kg and azithromycin $500$ mg IV is added for intrapartum cesarean or ruptured membranes.\n\nThe patient’s weight is $130$ kg and body mass index (BMI) is $42$.\n\nStarting from mass-balance principles for dose per kilogram, compute the cefazolin dose per kilogram that this patient will receive under the recommended regimen. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the cefazolin dose per kilogram for a patient undergoing a cesarean delivery, based on provided clinical guidelines and patient-specific data. The fundamental principle is that the dose per unit mass is the total administered dose divided by the total body mass.\n\nFirst, we identify the relevant parameters provided in the problem statement.\nThe patient's body mass is given as $W = 130 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe clinical guidance for cefazolin administration is stated as a total dose of $D_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\text{ g}$ for patients with a maternal weight greater than or equal to $120 \\text{ kg}$.\n\nWe verify that the patient meets the criterion for this dosage. The patient's weight is $130 \\text{ kg}$, which satisfies the condition $130 \\text{ kg} \\geq 120 \\text{ kg}$. Therefore, the correct total dose of cefazolin for this patient is $3 \\text{ g}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be expressed in units of milligrams per kilogram ($\\mathrm{mg/kg}$). We must convert the total dose from grams ($\\text{g}$) to milligrams ($\\text{mg}$). The conversion factor is $1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}$.\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 3000 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNext, we compute the dose per kilogram, which we denote as $d$. This is calculated by dividing the total dose in milligrams by the patient's mass in kilograms.\n$$d = \\frac{D_{\\text{total}}}{W}$$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$d = \\frac{3000 \\text{ mg}}{130 \\text{ kg}}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value for the dose per kilogram:\n$$d = \\frac{300}{13} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\approx 23.076923... \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $3$, $0$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$d \\approx 23.08 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n\nThe other information provided, such as the patient being gravida $2$ para $1$, the indication for cesarean delivery (arrest of descent), the duration of ruptured membranes ($12$ hours), the patient's BMI ($42$), and the co-administration of azithromycin, serve to establish the clinical context and justify the antibiotic prophylaxis regimen but are not directly required for the calculation of the cefazolin dose per kilogram.",

Since $63.21 \\geq 40$, the patient accrues $2$ points for this risk factor.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the total risk score ($S$).**\nThe total risk score $S$ is the sum of points from all applicable risk factors.

Therefore, the per-dose amount is calculated as:\n$$\nd(178.4) = 0.4 \\times 178.4 \\text{ mg} = 71.36 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nThe total daily dose $D_{\\text{daily}}$ is twice the per-dose amount because the regimen is twice-daily:\n$$\nD_{\\text{daily}} = 2 \\times d(178.4) = 2 \\times 71.36 \\text{ mg} = 142.72 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD_{\\text{daily}} \\approx 142.7 \\text{ mg}\n$$\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- Total risk score $S = 11$.\n- Total daily enoxaparin dose $D_{\\text{daily}} = 142.7$ mg.\n- Duration of prophylaxis $T = 42$ days.\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row vector containing these three values in order.",

Consider an elective cesarean delivery scheduled at $38$ weeks, recognizing the clinically observed probability $p_i = 0.85$ that membranes are intact at the time of the scheduled operation. The risk of vertical HIV transmission is modeled as follows. The baseline perinatal transmission probability under intact membranes and consistent ART for any delivery mode is given by $R(V) = \\beta \\ln(1+V)$, where $\\beta = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm. Membrane rupture increases transmission risk multiplicatively by $\\gamma = 1.5$ compared with intact membranes.
