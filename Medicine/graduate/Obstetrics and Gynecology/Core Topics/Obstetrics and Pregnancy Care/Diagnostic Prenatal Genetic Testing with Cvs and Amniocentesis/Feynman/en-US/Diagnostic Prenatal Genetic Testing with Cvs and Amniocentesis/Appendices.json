            "problem": "A pregnant patient at gestational age between $11$ and $13$ weeks is considering Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) versus waiting for amniocentesis at $16$ to $18$ weeks for diagnostic prenatal genetic testing. Assume the following scientifically grounded quantities and interpret them as probabilities over the immediate post-procedure window at the respective gestational ages: the baseline probability of miscarriage without any invasive procedure is $0.015$ in the $11$ to $13$ week window and $0.010$ in the $16$ to $18$ week window. The procedure-attributable excess probability of miscarriage is $0.002$ for CVS and $0.001$ for amniocentesis. Using the epidemiologic definition that absolute risk over a window equals the probability of miscarriage from any cause in that window, and treating the baseline and procedure-attributable components as independent rare-event contributions over the window of interest, compute the absolute risk difference, defined as the absolute risk with CVS minus the absolute risk with amniocentesis. Express your final answer as a decimal probability and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. It presents a standard risk calculation problem in medical epidemiology.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the quantities provided in the problem statement.\nLet $P_{b,CVS}$ be the baseline probability of miscarriage in the $11$ to $13$ week gestational window, and $P_{b,Amnio}$ be the baseline probability of miscarriage in the $16$ to $18$ week gestational window.\nLet $P_{p,CVS}$ be the procedure-attributable excess probability of miscarriage for Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS).\nLet $P_{p,Amnio}$ be the procedure-attributable excess probability of miscarriage for amniocentesis.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $P_{b,CVS} = 0.015$\n- $P_{b,Amnio} = 0.010$\n- $P_{p,CVS} = 0.002$\n- $P_{p,Amnio} = 0.001$\n\nThe problem defines \"absolute risk\" over a window as the probability of miscarriage from any cause within that window. It specifies that the baseline and procedure-attributable components should be treated as independent rare-event contributions. The term \"procedure-attributable excess probability\" is an epidemiological standard that represents the additive risk conferred by an exposure (in this case, the medical procedure) on top of the baseline risk. Therefore, the absolute risk for a given procedure is the sum of the corresponding baseline risk and the procedure-attributable excess risk.\n\nLet $R_{CVS}$ be the absolute risk of miscarriage for a patient undergoing CVS, and $R_{Amnio}$ be the absolute risk for a patient undergoing amniocentesis. Based on the additive model implied by the terminology:\n$$\nR_{CVS} = P_{b,CVS} + P_{p,CVS}\n$$\n$$\nR_{Amnio} = P_{b,Amnio} + P_{p,Amnio}\n$$\nThis additive model is a direct consequence of interpreting \"excess probability\" and is justified by the \"rare-event\" condition. For two independent events, the probability of union $A \\cup B$ is $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$. For rare events where probabilities are very small, the product term $P(A)P(B)$ is negligible, leading to the approximation $P(A \\cup B) \\approx P(A) + P(B)$.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we calculate the absolute risks:\nFor CVS:\n$$\nR_{CVS} = 0.015 + 0.002 = 0.017\n$$\nFor amniocentesis:\n$$\nR_{Amnio} = 0.010 + 0.001 = 0.011\n$$\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk difference, which we denote as $ARD$, defined as the absolute risk with CVS minus the absolute risk with amniocentesis.\n$$\nARD = R_{CVS} - R_{Amnio}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated absolute risks:\n$$\nARD = 0.017 - 0.011 = 0.006\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal probability rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.006$. The first significant figure is $6$. To express this with four significant figures, we append three zeros.\n$$\nARD = 0.006000\n$$\nThis result quantifies the additional risk of fetal loss associated with choosing the earlier CVS procedure compared to waiting for the later amniocentesis procedure, based on the provided probabilistic model.",

This problem challenges you to construct and evaluate a complete, evidence-based plan for performing a transcervical CVS, from initial setup to post-procedure care.

            "problem": "A pregnant patient at $11$ weeks with an anterior placenta presents for diagnostic prenatal genetic testing via transcervical Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Constructing a stepwise plan must begin from fundamental infection-control principles (microorganisms cause infection and transmission risk decreases with antisepsis and barrier technique), the physics of ultrasound imaging (real-time high-frequency sound wave imaging enables spatial localization and trajectory control, lowering iatrogenic injury), and maternal-fetal immunology (fetomaternal hemorrhage can incite maternal alloimmunization against Rhesus D antigen, preventable with Rhesus D immune globulin). Which option best articulates a complete, evidence-based, stepwise plan for transcervical CVS—covering instrument selection, aseptic technique, and ultrasound guidance—and correctly explains how each component mitigates key complications such as infection, membrane disruption, fetal injury, bleeding, maternal cell contamination, and Rhesus alloimmunization?\n\nA. Pre-procedure: Confirm viability, gestational age at $10$–$13$ weeks, and placental location with real-time transabdominal ultrasound; assess for contraindications (active genital tract infection, heavy bleeding). Asepsis: Place a sterile speculum; perform thorough vaginal and ectocervical antiseptic prep (e.g., povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine) and sterile draping; use sterile gloves and instruments; avoid routine prophylactic antibiotics absent specific indications. Instruments: Use a sterile, flexible transcervical CVS catheter with an obturator/stylet; avoid cervical dilation and rigid instruments; stabilize the cervix gently only if needed to align the canal. Guidance: Maintain continuous real-time ultrasound visualization; select the shortest path through the cervical canal to the chorionic plate, keeping the catheter tangential to the placental surface to avoid crossing membranes; advance the catheter under direct visualization and apply gentle suction with a syringe to aspirate villi; limit to $1$–$2$ passes and confirm macroscopic villi (frond-like tissue) rather than decidua; if inadequate sample, reconsider a transabdominal approach rather than repeated transcervical attempts. Post-procedure: Provide Rhesus D immune globulin to Rhesus-negative patients (typically $50\\ \\mu\\text{g}$ at $<12$ weeks), observe for bleeding or cramping, and counsel on warning signs. Rationale: Asepsis reduces microbial inoculum and chorioamnionitis risk per germ theory; flexible catheter and minimal passes lower cervical and placental trauma, bleeding, and procedure-related loss; real-time ultrasound trajectory control reduces membrane disruption and fetal injury; villus verification lowers maternal cell contamination; Rhesus D immune globulin prevents alloimmunization if fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs.\n\nB. Pre-procedure: Confirm placental location but proceed without real-time ultrasound; administer routine prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients. Asepsis: Minimal cervical cleansing; no sterile drape. Instruments: Perform cervical dilation with Hegar dilators and use a rigid curette to scrape placental tissue; perform $4$–$6$ passes to ensure an adequate sample. Post-procedure: No Rhesus D immune globulin. Rationale: Antibiotics are expected to prevent infection; repeated passes ensure adequate tissue yield.\n\nC. Pre-procedure: Confirm gestational age and placenta. Asepsis: Use clean (non-sterile) speculum and gloves with brief Betadine swabbing only if time permits; avoid draping. Instruments: Use a rigid metal curette because it yields larger samples that reduce culture failure; perform without ultrasound visualization other than initial placental mapping. Rationale: Larger samples decrease maternal cell contamination and negate the need for ultrasound.\n\nD. Pre-procedure: Skip ultrasound; transcervically insert a transabdominal amniocentesis needle (e.g., $20$-gauge spinal needle) through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity; advance until resistance is met and aspirate. Asepsis: Standard clinic-level cleanliness is sufficient. Rationale: Needles are more precise than catheters and eliminate bleeding risks.\n\nE. Pre-procedure: Confirm placenta and gestational age with ultrasound. Asepsis: Full sterile prep and drape. Instruments: Use a flexible transcervical catheter under ultrasound, but routinely administer a paracervical block and prophylactic tocolytics (e.g., indomethacin) to prevent miscarriage; perform $3$–$4$ passes to ensure adequate tissue. Post-procedure: Give $300\\ \\mu\\text{g}$ Rhesus D immune globulin to all patients regardless of Rhesus status. Rationale: Analgesia and tocolysis prevent discomfort and loss; higher-dose Rhesus D immune globulin is universally protective.\n\nChoose the single best option.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides an excellent framework for evaluating a complex medical procedure. It correctly establishes three core principles: infection control based on germ theory, the application of ultrasound physics for real-time guidance to minimize iatrogenic injury, and the immunological basis for preventing Rhesus (Rh) D alloimmunization. A correct plan for transcervical Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) must integrate all three principles to ensure patient safety and diagnostic accuracy. We will now evaluate each option against this established standard of care.\n\n**Option A: Pre-procedure: Confirm viability, gestational age at $10$–$13$ weeks, and placental location with real-time transabdominal ultrasound; assess for contraindications (active genital tract infection, heavy bleeding). Asepsis: Place a sterile speculum; perform thorough vaginal and ectocervical antiseptic prep (e.g., povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine) and sterile draping; use sterile gloves and instruments; avoid routine prophylactic antibiotics absent specific indications. Instruments: Use a sterile, flexible transcervical CVS catheter with an obturator/stylet; avoid cervical dilation and rigid instruments; stabilize the cervix gently only if needed to align the canal.

Post-procedure: Provide Rhesus D immune globulin to Rhesus-negative patients (typically $50$ $\\mu\\text{g}$ at $<12$ weeks), observe for bleeding or cramping, and counsel on warning signs. Rationale: Asepsis reduces microbial inoculum and chorioamnionitis risk per germ theory; flexible catheter and minimal passes lower cervical and placental trauma, bleeding, and procedure-related loss; real-time ultrasound trajectory control reduces membrane disruption and fetal injury; villus verification lowers maternal cell contamination; Rhesus D immune globulin prevents alloimmunization if fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs.**\n\nThis option describes the procedure with exemplary accuracy and completeness, correctly integrating all specified principles.\n1.  **Pre-procedure:** The steps are correct. Confirmation of gestational age (the window of $10$–$13$ weeks is standard), viability, and placental location by ultrasound is fundamental. Screening for contraindications like active infection is a critical safety measure.\n2.  **Asepsis:** The description of strict aseptic technique (sterile speculum, drapes, gloves, instruments, and thorough antiseptic preparation) is correct and directly addresses the principle of infection control. The recommendation against routine prophylactic antibiotics is consistent with current evidence-based guidelines.\n3.  **Instruments and Guidance:** The use of a flexible catheter under continuous real-time ultrasound guidance is the standard of care. This directly applies the physics of ultrasound to minimize risk. Limiting passes to $1$–$2$ and avoiding traumatic instruments (like rigid curettes) or unnecessary interventions (cervical dilation) are crucial for minimizing pregnancy loss, bleeding, and membrane rupture. Macroscopic verification of the sample is essential to reduce the likelihood of maternal cell contamination and ensure sample adequacy.\n4.  **Post-procedure:** The administration of Rhesus D immune globulin to Rh-negative patients is mandatory to prevent alloimmunization. The specified dose of $50\\ \\mu\\text{g}$ for a gestational age of $11$ weeks (which is $12$ weeks) is correct.\n5.  **Rationale:** The rationale flawlessly connects each procedural component to the mitigation of a specific, known risk, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the underlying principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: Pre-procedure: Confirm placental location but proceed without real-time ultrasound; administer routine prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients. Asepsis: Minimal cervical cleansing; no sterile drape. Instruments: Perform cervical dilation with Hegar dilators and use a rigid curette to scrape placental tissue; perform $4$–$6$ passes to ensure an adequate sample. Post-procedure: No Rhesus D immune globulin. Rationale: Antibiotics are expected to prevent infection; repeated passes ensure adequate tissue yield.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed and describes a dangerous and outdated procedure.\n1.  **Guidance:** Proceeding without continuous real-time ultrasound guidance is a gross deviation from the standard of care and dramatically increases the risk of fetal injury, membrane rupture, and placental trauma. This violates the principle of using ultrasound for safety.\n2.  **Asepsis:** Minimal cleansing and no sterile drape violate the principles of infection control. Relying on routine prophylactic antibiotics is not a substitute for proper aseptic technique.\n3.  **Instruments:** a rigid curette and cervical dilation are highly traumatic and inappropriate for CVS. The number of passes ($4$–$6$) is excessive and unacceptably increases the risk of procedure-related pregnancy loss.\n4.  **Post-procedure:** Omitting Rhesus D immune globulin for an Rh-negative patient constitutes medical negligence and violates the principle of preventing alloimmunization.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: Pre-procedure: Confirm gestational age and placenta. Asepsis: Use clean (non-sterile) speculum and gloves with brief Betadine swabbing only if time permits; avoid draping. Instruments: Use a rigid metal curette because it yields larger samples that reduce culture failure; perform without ultrasound visualization other than initial placental mapping. Rationale: Larger samples decrease maternal cell contamination and negate the need for ultrasound.**\n\nThis option is also incorrect and dangerous.\n1.  **Asepsis:** The use of \"clean\" (non-sterile) equipment is a major breach of aseptic technique and poses a significant risk of iatrogenic infection (chorioamnionitis).\n2.  **Instruments and Guidance:** As with option B, a rigid curette is the wrong instrument. More critically, performing the procedure with only initial ultrasound mapping and not continuous real-time guidance is unsafe.\n3.  **Rationale:** The rationale is scientifically nonsensical. A larger sample does not \"negate the need for ultrasound\"; the purpose of ultrasound is for safe instrument guidance, not sample acquisition volume.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: Pre-procedure: Skip ultrasound; transcervically insert a transabdominal amniocentesis needle (e.g., $20$-gauge spinal needle) through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity; advance until resistance is met and aspirate. Asepsis: Standard clinic-level cleanliness is sufficient. Rationale: Needles are more precise than catheters and eliminate bleeding risks.**\n\nThis option describes a hazardous and nonsensical procedure.\n1.  **Guidance:** Skipping ultrasound entirely is reckless.\n2.  **Instruments:** An amniocentesis needle is designed for a transabdominal approach to sample amniotic fluid. Using it for a blind transcervical placental biopsy is incorrect and extremely dangerous. Advancing an instrument until \"resistance is met\" is a recipe for perforation of the membranes or fetus.\n3.  **Asepsis:** \"Standard clinic-level cleanliness\" is an undefined and insufficient standard for an invasive intrauterine procedure.\n4.  **Rationale:** The claim that this method is more \"precise\" or \"eliminates bleeding risks\" is false. A blind approach is the opposite of precise, and the potential for traumatic injury significantly increases bleeding risk.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E: Pre-procedure: Confirm placenta and gestational age with ultrasound. Asepsis: Full sterile prep and drape. Instruments: Use a flexible transcervical catheter under ultrasound, but routinely administer a paracervical block and prophylactic tocolytics (e.g., indomethacin) to prevent miscarriage; perform $3$–$4$ passes to ensure adequate tissue. Post-procedure: Give $300$ $\\mu\\text{g}$ Rhesus D immune globulin to all patients regardless of Rhesus status. Rationale: Analgesia and tocolysis prevent discomfort and loss; higher-dose Rhesus D immune globulin is universally protective.**\n\nThis option contains several significant errors, despite getting some elements correct.\n1.  **Interventions:** Routine administration of paracervical block and prophylactic tocolytics is not the standard of care. The efficacy of tocolytics in preventing miscarriage after CVS is not established.\n2.  **Technique:** The number of passes ($3$–$4$) is excessive and increases risk; the goal is to minimize passes.\n3.  **Post-procedure:** The Rhesus D immune globulin protocol is incorrect on two counts. First, it should only be given to Rh-negative patients, not all patients. Second, the dose for a gestation of $11$ weeks is typically $50\\ \\mu\\text{g}$, not $300\\ \\mu\\text{g}$ (the dose for gestations $\\geq 12$ weeks).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only option that presents a complete, coherent, and evidence-based plan consistent with the fundamental principles of modern obstetric practice. The other options contain multiple errors that range from suboptimal to dangerously incorrect.",

            "problem": "A Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) specimen is submitted for diagnostic prenatal genetic testing with concern for Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC). Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling is performed at three autosomal loci that are informative for paternal contribution. At each locus, the biological mother is homozygous for the allele she shares with the fetus, and the fetus is heterozygous, carrying one allele shared with the mother and one paternal-specific allele absent from the mother. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) electropherogram peak heights are recorded in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- In STR genotyping, within a locus, PCR peak height for an allele is proportional to the number of template allele copies and to the mass fraction of that DNA source in the mixture. This proportionality is linear over the dynamic range used.\n- For a heterozygous individual, each allele contributes equally to the locus-specific signal from that individual.\n- In a mixed specimen containing fetal and maternal DNA, the maternal DNA contributes signal only at alleles present in the maternal genotype. The paternal-specific fetal allele receives no contribution from maternal DNA.\n- Ignore stutter and differential amplification among alleles within a locus; treat locus-specific amplification efficiency as equal across contributors and alleles, and let it cancel via ratio-based derivations.\n\nDefine the fetal DNA mass fraction in the specimen as $f$ and the maternal contamination proportion as $m = 1 - f$. For each locus $i$, let $H_{A,i}$ be the observed peak height of the allele shared by mother and fetus, and let $H_{B,i}$ be the observed peak height of the paternal-specific fetal allele.\n\nData:\n- Locus $1$: $H_{A,1} = 3200$ and $H_{B,1} = 950$.\n- Locus $2$: $H_{A,2} = 4100$ and $H_{B,2} = 1200$.\n- Locus $3$: $H_{A,3} = 2800$ and $H_{B,3} = 800$.\n\nUsing only the stated base and assumptions, derive an expression for $f$ in terms of the observed ratio $R_i = H_{B,i}/H_{A,i}$ for each locus, compute $f_i$ at each locus, then compute the specimen-level fetal fraction $\\bar{f}$ as the arithmetic mean of the three $f_i$ values. From this, compute the MCC proportion $m = 1 - \\bar{f}$. Laboratory policy states that for Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS), if $m > 0.05$, re-sampling is required; otherwise, proceed with analysis using mixture-aware adjustment.\n\nRound the MCC proportion $m$ to four significant figures and report your final answer as two values in a row matrix: the MCC proportion $m$ (as a decimal, without a percent sign) and an indicator where $1$ denotes that re-sampling is required and $0$ denotes that analysis adjustment without re-sampling is sufficient.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative molecular genetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe primary task is to quantify the level of Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in a Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) specimen and decide on a clinical course of action based on a predefined threshold. This is achieved by analyzing Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiles.\n\nLet $f$ be the mass fraction of fetal DNA and $m$ be the mass fraction of maternal DNA in the specimen. By definition, these fractions sum to unity: $f + m = 1$, or $m = 1 - f$. For each locus $i$, we are given that the mother is homozygous for an allele (let's call it allele A) and the fetus is heterozygous, possessing the maternal allele A and a unique paternal allele (let's call it allele B).\n\nAccording to the problem's stated base assumptions, the observed peak height of an allele in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) electropherogram is linearly proportional to the number of template copies of that allele in the initial sample. Let $k_i$ be the locus-specific proportionality constant for locus $i$, which encapsulates factors like amplification efficiency.\n\nThe signal for each allele is the sum of contributions from the maternal and fetal DNA pools.\nThe maternal DNA has a mass fraction of $m = 1 - f$. Since the mother is homozygous for allele A, her entire contribution at this locus is to allele A. The number of template copies is proportional to her mass fraction, so her contribution to the peak height of allele A is $k_i \\cdot m = k_i(1-f)$. Her contribution to allele B is $0$.\n\nThe fetal DNA has a mass fraction of $f$. The fetus is heterozygous (A, B). The problem states that for a heterozygous individual, each allele contributes equally. Therefore, the fetal DNA contributes proportionally to $f/2$ for allele A and $f/2$ for allele B. The fetal contribution to the peak height of allele A is $k_i \\cdot \\frac{f}{2}$, and to the peak height of allele B is also $k_i \\cdot \\frac{f}{2}$.\n\nThe total observed peak heights, $H_{A,i}$ and $H_{B,i}$, are the sum of the maternal and fetal contributions:\nFor the shared allele A:\n$$H_{A,i} = (\\text{Maternal Contribution}) + (\\text{Fetal Contribution}) = k_i(1-f) + k_i\\frac{f}{2} = k_i\\left(1 - f + \\frac{f}{2}\\right) = k_i\\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right)$$\nFor the paternal-specific allele B:\n$$H_{B,i} = (\\text{Maternal Contribution}) + (\\text{Fetal Contribution}) = 0 + k_i\\frac{f}{2} = k_i\\frac{f}{2}$$\n\nThe problem defines the ratio $R_i = H_{B,i} / H_{A,i}$. Using the expressions above, we can write:\n$$R_i = \\frac{k_i \\frac{f}{2}}{k_i \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right)}$$\nThe proportionality constant $k_i$ cancels, as expected.\n$$R_i = \\frac{\\frac{f}{2}}{1 - \\frac{f}{2}}$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $f$ to derive a general formula for the fetal fraction based on the observable ratio $R_i$.\n$$R_i \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right) = \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i - R_i \\frac{f}{2} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i = \\frac{f}{2} + R_i \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i = \\frac{f}{2} (1 + R_i)$$\n$$2R_i = f (1 + R_i)$$\n$$f = \\frac{2R_i}{1 + R_i}$$\nThis equation allows us to calculate the fetal fraction $f_i$ for each informative locus $i$.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the data provided for the three loci.\n\nFor locus $1$: $H_{A,1} = 3200$ and $H_{B,1} = 950$.\nThe ratio is $R_1 = \\frac{H_{B,1}}{H_{A,1}} = \\frac{950}{3200} = \\frac{19}{64}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_1 = \\frac{2R_1}{1+R_1} = \\frac{2(\\frac{19}{64})}{1+\\frac{19}{64}} = \\frac{\\frac{38}{64}}{\\frac{64+19}{64}} = \\frac{38}{83}$.\n\nFor locus $2$: $H_{A,2} = 4100$ and $H_{B,2} = 1200$.\nThe ratio is $R_2 = \\frac{H_{B,2}}{H_{A,2}} = \\frac{1200}{4100} = \\frac{12}{41}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_2 = \\frac{2R_2}{1+R_2} = \\frac{2(\\frac{12}{41})}{1+\\frac{12}{41}} = \\frac{\\frac{24}{41}}{\\frac{41+12}{41}} = \\frac{24}{53}$.\n\nFor locus $3$: $H_{A,3} = 2800$ and $H_{B,3} = 800$.\nThe ratio is $R_3 = \\frac{H_{B,3}}{H_{A,3}} = \\frac{800}{2800} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_3 = \\frac{2R_3}{1+R_3} = \\frac{2(\\frac{2}{7})}{1+\\frac{2}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{7}}{\\frac{7+2}{7}} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nThe problem specifies to compute the specimen-level fetal fraction $\\bar{f}$ as the arithmetic mean of the three locus-specific values.\n$$\\bar{f} = \\frac{f_1 + f_2 + f_3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{38}{83} + \\frac{24}{53} + \\frac{4}{9} \\right)$$\nTo compute the value, we convert the fractions to decimals:\n$f_1 \\approx 0.4578313$\n$f_2 \\approx 0.4528302$\n$f_3 \\approx 0.4444444$\n$$\\bar{f} \\approx \\frac{0.4578313 + 0.4528302 + 0.4444444}{3} = \\frac{1.3551059}{3} \\approx 0.4517020$$\nThe MCC proportion, $m$, is then calculated as:\n$$m = 1 - \\bar{f} \\approx 1 - 0.4517020 = 0.5482980$$\nThe problem requires rounding $m$ to four significant figures.\n$$m \\approx 0.5483$$\nThe laboratory policy states that if $m > 0.05$, re-sampling is required.
