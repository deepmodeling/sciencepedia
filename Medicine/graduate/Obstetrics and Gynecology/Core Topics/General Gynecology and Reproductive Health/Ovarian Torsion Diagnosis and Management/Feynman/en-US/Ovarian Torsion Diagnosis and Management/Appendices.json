            "problem": "A patient of reproductive age presents with sudden unilateral pelvic pain and a tender adnexal mass. Based on synthesis of history, examination, and non-Doppler ultrasonography findings (enlarged ovary with peripheral follicles), the clinician estimates a pretest probability of ovarian torsion of $0.30$. A targeted transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography (TCDU) assessment of venous flow in the affected ovary is performed; for the binary classifier defined as \"absent venous flow\" versus \"present venous flow,\" assume hypothetical test characteristics: sensitivity $0.75$ and specificity $0.90$ for the diagnosis of ovarian torsion.\n\nStarting from foundational definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities, the definition of likelihood ratio (LR), and Bayes theorem in odds form, derive the positive likelihood ratio $\\text{LR}^{+}$ and the negative likelihood ratio $\\text{LR}^{-}$ for the \"absent venous flow\" classifier. Then, using these likelihood ratios and the given pretest probability $0.30$, compute the post-test probability of ovarian torsion after a positive test and after a negative test.\n\nRound all numerical quantities to four significant figures. Express probabilities as decimals without a percent sign. Provide the final answer as a row matrix in the order: $\\text{LR}^{+}$, $\\text{LR}^{-}$, post-test probability after a positive test, post-test probability after a negative test.

Let $T^+$ be a positive test result (defined as \"absent venous flow\") and $T^-$ be a negative test result (defined as \"present venous flow\").\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\nThe pretest probability of disease is $P(D) = 0.30$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is $Sens = 0.75$.\nThe specificity of the test is $Spec = 0.90$.\n\nFirst, we express sensitivity and specificity in terms of conditional probabilities. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present:\n$$Sens = P(T^+ | D) = 0.75$$\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent:\n$$Spec = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also find the probabilities of the complementary events:\nThe false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present:\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Sens = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$\nThe false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Spec = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for the likelihood ratios.

            "problem": "A reproductive-age patient presents with acute pelvic pain in a setting where ultrasound is temporarily unavailable. A $28$-year-old nulligravid woman arrives with sudden-onset, severe left lower quadrant pain of $1$ hour duration, maximal at onset, associated with nausea and a single episode of emesis. She reports regular menses, last period $20$ days ago. A midstream urine pregnancy test is negative. Vital signs: blood pressure $110/70\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, heart rate $96\\ \\mathrm{beats/min}$, temperature $37.2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, respiratory rate $16\\ \\mathrm{breaths/min}$, oxygen saturation $99\\%$ on room air. Abdominal examination reveals focal left lower quadrant tenderness with voluntary guarding; there is no rebound. Pelvic examination shows left adnexal tenderness without cervical motion tenderness. Complete blood count (CBC) shows hemoglobin $12.5\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$, white blood cell count $10.0\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$, platelets $280\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$. Her prior outpatient transvaginal ultrasound $1$ month ago documented a $6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ simple left ovarian cyst; she has had intermittent mild twinges since then. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are available but would delay intervention; bedside ultrasound is projected to be unavailable for $2$ to $3$ hours.\n\nUsing fundamental pathophysiologic principles and well-tested clinical facts as a base, reason through how to weigh ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst versus ovarian torsion as the leading cause of her pain, and select the most appropriate immediate management. The fundamental base includes: (i) the definition that ovarian torsion is rotation of the ovary and often the fallopian tube around the vascular pedicle, initially obstructing venous and lymphatic outflow and subsequently arterial inflow, producing time-dependent ischemia and potential necrosis; (ii) that rupture of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst results in intraperitoneal bleeding and peritoneal irritation, with hemodynamic compromise proportional to bleed volume and rate; (iii) that negative pregnancy testing markedly lowers, but does not fully eliminate, the probability of ectopic pregnancy; (iv) that expected-utility decision-making allows action at a probability threshold $p^{*}$ where the expected harm of inaction exceeds the expected harm of action; (v) that multimodal imaging such as CT or MRI may be nonspecific for torsion and may delay definitive surgical care.\n\nWhich of the following represents the most appropriate reasoning process and immediate management in this scenario?\n\nA. Given a prior $6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ ovarian cyst and the abrupt, severe unilateral pain with nausea/emesis, assign a high pretest probability to ovarian torsion. Because ovarian viability decreases with time from onset due to progressive ischemia, and ultrasound is delayed $2$ to $3$ hours, proceed to urgent diagnostic laparoscopy without waiting for imaging, after obtaining type and crossmatch and establishing serial hemoglobin monitoring to mitigate hemorrhagic risk.\n\nB. Hemodynamic stability and guarding with normal hemoglobin suggest a small intraperitoneal bleed from a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst; administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), observe for $3$ hours until ultrasound becomes available, and intervene only if hemoglobin declines or vital signs worsen.\n\nC. Order an immediate contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to distinguish torsion from hemorrhagic cyst rupture, as CT can demonstrate adnexal edema and hemoperitoneum; defer laparoscopy until imaging clarifies the diagnosis.\n\nD. Initiate empiric antibiotics for presumed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) given adnexal tenderness and leukocytosis, and defer surgical evaluation; schedule outpatient transvaginal ultrasound when available.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The central task is to weigh the differential diagnoses based on the provided data and principles and to select the management path that minimizes expected harm.\n\n**1. Analysis of Differential Diagnoses**\n\n*   **Ovarian Torsion**: The evidence for ovarian torsion is strong.\n    *   **Risk Factor**: The patient has a known $6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ left ovarian cyst. Ovarian masses, particularly those greater than $5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, are the most significant risk factor for torsion.\n    *   **Symptomology**: The pain is of sudden onset, severe, and maximal at onset. This \"thunderclap\" character is classic for an acute ischemic event, such as the twisting of the ovarian pedicle described in principle (i).\n    *   **Associated Findings**: Nausea and vomiting are present in a majority of torsion cases (approximately $70$-$85\\%$) due to vagal stimulation and are highly suggestive.\n    *   **Physical Exam**: Focal left adnexal tenderness corresponds to the location of the known cyst and the affected ovary.\n    *   **Labs**: The white blood cell count of $10.0\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ is at the upper limit of normal, which can be seen as an early inflammatory response to tissue ischemia in torsion.\n\n*   **Ruptured Hemorrhagic Ovarian Cyst**: This is a key differential, but several factors make it less likely to be the primary driver of this clinical picture.\n    *   **Pathophysiology (Principle ii)**: The pain from a ruptured cyst is due to peritoneal irritation from blood. The severity of pain and hemodynamic instability are proportional to the bleed volume.\n    *   **Clinical Findings**: The patient's vital signs are relatively stable (heart rate is borderline at $96\\ \\mathrm{beats/min}$), and her hemoglobin is a normal $12.5\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$. This argues against a large-volume hemorrhage that would be expected to cause such severe, unremitting pain. While a small rupture is possible, it is less likely to cause this intensity of symptoms.\n\n*   **Ectopic Pregnancy**: The negative urine pregnancy test makes this diagnosis extremely unlikely, as per principle (iii). While not a $100\\%$ exclusion, it is reasonable to place it very low on the differential in this acute setting.\n\n*   **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)**: This is unlikely. The pain onset is too abrupt for a typical infectious process. The patient is afebrile ($37.2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), and, critically, lacks cervical motion tenderness, a key sign of PID.\n\n**2. Application of Expected-Utility Decision-Making (Principle iv)**\n\nThe decision to operate now versus wait for imaging must be framed by comparing the expected harms of each course of action.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Assume the diagnosis is ovarian torsion.**\n    *   **Harm of Inaction (Waiting $2$-$3$ hours for ultrasound)**: Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive emergency. As per principle (i), progressive ischemia leads to necrosis. The chance of salvaging the ovary decreases significantly after $4$-$6$ hours of ischemia. The patient is already $1$ hour into her symptoms. A $2$-$3$ hour delay for ultrasound, followed by time to consent and prepare for surgery, could easily push the total ischemic time beyond the point of viability. The harm is the irreversible loss of an ovary, impacting fertility and endocrine function. This is a very high-magnitude harm.\n    *   **Harm of Action (Proceeding to surgery)**: Diagnostic laparoscopy carries procedural risks (anesthesia, bleeding, infection, organ damage). In a healthy $28$-year-old woman, these risks are statistically low.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Assume the diagnosis is a ruptured cyst with minimal bleeding.**\n    *   **Harm of Inaction (Waiting)**: Low. Such a condition is often managed conservatively with analgesia and observation.\n    *   **Harm of Action (Proceeding to surgery)**: The surgery would not have been strictly necessary for organ preservation, but it would be diagnostic and could be therapeutic (e.g., draining a hematoma). The harm is that of a low-risk but non-essential procedure.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\nThe pre-test probability of ovarian torsion is very high based on the risk factor and classic presentation. The competing diagnosis of a major hemorrhagic event is less likely given the stable hemodynamics and normal hemoglobin. According to the expected-utility framework, the potential harm of a lost ovary (high probability, high magnitude harm) from delaying intervention far outweighs the harm of a potentially \"negative\" (i.e., finding a non-torsed ovary) diagnostic laparoscopy (low-risk procedure). Therefore, immediate surgical intervention is warranted. Waiting for imaging (ultrasound or CT/MRI, per principle v) introduces an unacceptable delay that jeopardizes ovarian viability.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Given a prior $6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ ovarian cyst and the abrupt, severe unilateral pain with nausea/emesis, assign a high pretest probability to ovarian torsion. Because ovarian viability decreases with time from onset due to progressive ischemia, and ultrasound is delayed $2$ to $3$ hours, proceed to urgent diagnostic laparoscopy without waiting for imaging, after obtaining type and crossmatch and establishing serial hemoglobin monitoring to mitigate hemorrhagic risk.**\n    This option correctly identifies the high pre-test probability of torsion, correctly applies the principle of time-dependent ischemia, and correctly concludes that the delay for imaging is unacceptable. The proposed action, urgent diagnostic laparoscopy, is the standard of care in this situation. The additional safety measures (type and crossmatch, serial hemoglobin) are prudent to manage surgical risk and the small possibility of a hemorrhagic process. This reasoning is sound and the action is appropriate.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Hemodynamic stability and guarding with normal hemoglobin suggest a small intraperitoneal bleed from a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst; administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), observe for $3$ hours until ultrasound becomes available, and intervene only if hemoglobin declines or vital signs worsen.**\n    This option incorrectly prioritizes the lower-probability diagnosis (ruptured cyst) over the high-probability, high-risk diagnosis (torsion). The management plan of watchful waiting directly courts the primary harm to be avoided: ovarian necrosis. This approach violates the principle of minimizing expected harm.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Order an immediate contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to distinguish torsion from hemorrhagic cyst rupture, as CT can demonstrate adnexal edema and hemoperitoneum; defer laparoscopy until imaging clarifies the diagnosis.**\n    This option introduces a delay for an imaging modality that is acknowledged in the problem's own principles (v) to be potentially nonspecific and to delay definitive care. In a time-critical condition like ovarian torsion with a classic presentation, the imperative is to proceed to surgery, not to obtain more, potentially unhelpful and time-consuming, data.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Initiate empiric antibiotics for presumed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) given adnexal tenderness and leukocytosis, and defer surgical evaluation; schedule outpatient transvaginal ultrasound when available.**\n    This represents a gross misinterpretation of the clinical data. The presentation is inconsistent with PID (sudden onset, afebrile, no cervical motion tenderness). The proposed management would miss a surgical emergency and lead to certain organ loss.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Attempt bedside manual detorsion via bimanual pelvic manipulation, as this can reverse torsion without operative intervention when ultrasound is not available, while arranging outpatient follow-up.**\n    Bedside manual detorsion is not a standard, evidence-based, or safe procedure. It is performed blind, risks rupturing the ovary or associated cyst, and cannot confirm successful detorsion or assess viability. Surgical exploration is required to visually confirm detorsion and viability, and to address the underlying pathology (e.g., cystectomy, oophoropexy) to prevent recurrence. This option proposes a non-standard and dangerous intervention.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A $26$-year-old nulligravid patient presents with acute unilateral pelvic pain and nausea. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an enlarged ovary with peripheral follicles and free fluid, consistent with torsion. The patient reports that her pain began approximately $24$ hours ago. The on-call team debates whether a reported $24$-hour pain duration should preclude attempted detorsion.\n\nUse the following context-appropriate fundamental base and observational facts to reason from first principles:\n\n- Pathophysiology of torsion: adnexal torsion compromises venous outflow first, with arterial inflow potentially persisting due to dual vascular supply (ovarian and uterine arteries), leading to variable ischemia progression. Tissue viability thus declines over time but is not governed by a single fixed threshold because torsion can be intermittent and perfusion is heterogeneous.\n- Decision theory: an intervention should be favored when the expected benefit exceeds the expected harm. Let the expected utility be modeled as $U = p_{\\text{salvage}} \\cdot B - p_{\\text{complication}} \\cdot C$, where $p_{\\text{salvage}}$ is the probability of ovarian salvage with detorsion, $B$ is the benefit of salvage (normalized to $1$ for fertility-preserving value), $p_{\\text{complication}}$ is the probability of a serious complication from attempted detorsion, and $C$ is the disutility of such a complication (on the same scale as $B$).\n- Observational salvage data: pooled observational series in modern practice report approximate ovarian salvage rates of about $70\\%$ when detorsion is performed within $8$ hours, about $50\\%$ within $12$ hours, and about $30\\%$ by $24$ hours, reflecting a declining probability of salvage with increasing duration.\n- Onset reporting uncertainty: patient-reported onset time is imprecise; model the actual duration $T$ as centered on the reported duration $R$ with symmetric error, $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(R,\\sigma^{2})$, where $R = 24$ hours and $\\sigma = 6$ hours, capturing uncertainty due to recall error and intermittent symptoms.\n- Complication risk: laparoscopic detorsion has a serious complication probability $p_{\\text{complication}} \\approx 0.01$, and the disutility of a serious complication is $C \\approx 0.2$ relative to the benefit scale $B = 1$. Historical concern for thromboembolism from reperfusion is rare in contemporary series.\n\nAssume a constant hazard model for loss of viability to operationalize the declining salvage probability over time (a widely used survival modeling assumption), and integrate the onset uncertainty to estimate the expected salvage probability at a reported $24$ hours. Based on this principle-driven estimate and expected utility, choose the best management statement.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?\n\nA. A reported $24$-hour pain duration should not preclude urgent laparoscopy with attempted detorsion, because expected ovarian salvage remains clinically meaningful once onset uncertainty and observational salvage data are integrated.\n\nB. A reported $24$-hour pain duration should preclude detorsion and prompt oophorectomy, because the ovary is nonviable beyond $24$ hours.\n\nC. It is preferable to delay intervention to obtain repeat Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDUS), because the salvage probability is too uncertain to justify operative exploration.\n\nD. Attempt detorsion only if CDUS demonstrates absent arterial flow; otherwise observe, because preserved flow indicates sufficient viability and low torsion likelihood at $24$ hours.\n\nE. Detorsion is contraindicated after $24$ hours due to high risk of thromboembolism from reperfusion; proceed directly to oophorectomy.",
            "solution": "The analysis proceeds by first formalizing the relationship between symptom duration and ovarian salvageability, then integrating patient-reported time uncertainty, and finally applying a decision-theoretic model to compare outcomes.\n\n1.  **Modeling Salvage Probability Over Time**\n    The problem specifies a constant hazard model for the loss of viability. This implies that the probability of the ovary being salvageable, $p_{\\text{salvage}}(t)$, follows an exponential decay function of time $t$:\n    $$p_{\\text{salvage}}(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the constant hazard rate. We can estimate $\\lambda$ from the provided observational data:\n    -   $p_{\\text{salvage}}(8 \\text{ hours}) \\approx 0.70 \\implies e^{-8\\lambda} \\approx 0.70 \\implies \\lambda \\approx -\\frac{\\ln(0.70)}{8} \\approx 0.0446 \\text{ hours}^{-1}$\n    -   $p_{\\text{salvage}}(12 \\text{ hours}) \\approx 0.50 \\implies e^{-12\\lambda} \\approx 0.50 \\implies \\lambda \\approx -\\frac{\\ln(0.50)}{12} \\approx 0.0578 \\text{ hours}^{-1}$\n    -   $p_{\\text{salvage}}(24 \\text{ hours}) \\approx 0.30 \\implies e^{-24\\lambda} \\approx 0.30 \\implies \\lambda \\approx -\\frac{\\ln(0.30)}{24} \\approx 0.0502 \\text{ hours}^{-1}$\n    The values for $\\lambda$ are reasonably consistent. A value of $\\lambda \\approx 0.05 \\text{ hours}^{-1}$ is a robust approximation that fits the data well, especially for longer durations relevant to the case. Using $\\lambda = 0.05$, we can verify the data points: $e^{-0.05 \\cdot 8} = e^{-0.4} \\approx 0.67$, $e^{-0.05 \\cdot 12} = e^{-0.6} \\approx 0.55$, and $e^{-0.05 \\cdot 24} = e^{-1.2} \\approx 0.30$. This model is adequate for the analysis.\n\n2.  **Integrating Onset Time Uncertainty**\n    The actual duration of ischemia, $T$, is not a fixed value but a random variable modeled as a normal distribution, $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, with mean $\\mu = R = 24$ hours and standard deviation $\\sigma = 6$ hours. We must calculate the expected salvage probability, $E[p_{\\text{salvage}}(T)]$, over this distribution.\n    $$E[p_{\\text{salvage}}] = E[e^{-\\lambda T}] = E[e^{-0.05 T}]$$\n    This is the moment-generating function (MGF) of the normal distribution, $M_T(s) = E[e^{sT}] = e^{s\\mu+\\frac{1}{2}s^2\\sigma^2}$, evaluated at $s = -0.05$.\n    Plugging in the values $\\mu=24$, $\\sigma=6$, and $s=-0.05$:\n    $$E[p_{\\text{salvage}}] = \\exp\\left((-0.05)(24) + \\frac{1}{2}(-0.05)^2(6)^2\\right)$$\n    The terms in the exponent are:\n    -   $(-0.05)(24) = -1.2$\n    -   $\\frac{1}{2}(-0.05)^2(6)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.0025)(36) = 0.045$\n    The total exponent is $-1.2 + 0.045 = -1.155$.\n    $$E[p_{\\text{salvage}}] = e^{-1.155} \\approx 0.3150$$\n    Thus, the expected salvage probability, accounting for uncertainty in symptom onset, is approximately $31.5\\%$.\n\n3.  **Applying the Decision Theory Model**\n    The problem asks to evaluate the decision to attempt detorsion using the expected utility model $U = p_{\\text{salvage}} \\cdot B - p_{\\text{complication}} \\cdot C$. The alternative, oophorectomy, has a utility of $U_{\\text{ooph}} = 0$ as $p_{\\text{salvage}}=0$.\n    For detorsion, we use our calculated expected probability:\n    -   $E[p_{\\text{salvage}}] \\approx 0.315$\n    -   $B = 1$ (benefit of salvage)\n    -   $p_{\\text{complication}} \\approx 0.01$ (probability of complication)\n    -   $C \\approx 0.2$ (disutility of complication)\n    The expected utility of attempting detorsion is:\n    $$U_{\\text{detorsion}} = (0.315 \\cdot 1) - (0.01 \\cdot 0.2) = 0.315 - 0.002 = 0.313$$\n    Since $U_{\\text{detorsion}} = 0.313 > 0$, the model indicates that attempting detorsion is the preferred course of action because the expected utility is positive. A $31.5\\%$ chance of saving an ovary is clinically significant, and the expected utility calculation formally demonstrates that this benefit outweighs the small associated risk of complications.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. A reported $24$-hour pain duration should not preclude urgent laparoscopy with attempted detorsion, because expected ovarian salvage remains clinically meaningful once onset uncertainty and observational salvage data are integrated.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of our analysis. We calculated an expected salvage probability of approximately $31.5\\%$, which is clinically meaningful. The decision model yielded a positive expected utility, supporting intervention. The reasoning provided matches our methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A reported $24$-hour pain duration should preclude detorsion and prompt oophorectomy, because the ovary is nonviable beyond $24$ hours.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem's premises explicitly state that viability is not governed by a fixed threshold, and the provided data show a salvage rate of $\\approx 30\\%$ at $24$ hours, which contradicts the claim of guaranteed non-viability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. It is preferable to delay intervention to obtain repeat Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDUS), because the salvage probability is too uncertain to justify operative exploration.**\nThis is incorrect. Our model, which explicitly incorporates uncertainty, still favors immediate intervention. Delaying surgery for further imaging would increase time $t$, thereby decreasing the salvage probability $p_{\\text{salvage}}(t)$ and reducing the expected utility. In cases of high clinical suspicion for torsion, prompt surgical exploration is the standard of care to maximize the chance of salvage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Attempt detorsion only if CDUS demonstrates absent arterial flow; otherwise observe, because preserved flow indicates sufficient viability and low torsion likelihood at $24$ hours.**\nThis is incorrect. It misrepresents the pathophysiology of ovarian torsion. As stated in the problem, arterial flow often persists due to dual supply, while venous occlusion causes ischemic damage. Preserved arterial flow does not rule out torsion or guarantee viability. \"Observation\" in this context is inappropriate and dangerous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Detorsion is contraindicated after $24$ hours due to high risk of thromboembolism from reperfusion; proceed directly to oophorectomy.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly provides that the risk of thromboembolism is \"rare in contemporary series\" and assigns a low overall serious complication probability ($p_{\\text{complication}} \\approx 0.01$). This option relies on an outdated concern that is not supported by the data provided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
