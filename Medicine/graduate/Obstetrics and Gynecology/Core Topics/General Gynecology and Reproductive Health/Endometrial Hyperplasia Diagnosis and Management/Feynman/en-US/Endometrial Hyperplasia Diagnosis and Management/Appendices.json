The concepts of prevalence (pre-test probability), likelihood ratio, and post-test probability are fundamental to evidence-based medicine. The values provided, a prevalence of $10\\%$ in a referral population and an $LR_+$ of $2$ for a clinical finding, are plausible. The association between type 2 diabetes and endometrial hyperplasia is also clinically established.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to compute the post-test probability. The relationship between pre-test probability, likelihood ratio, and post-test probability is mathematically well-defined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective clinical and statistical terminology. It is free from ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) given a positive index finding (presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus). We will use the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $H$ denote the event that a patient has endometrial hyperplasia.\nLet $D$ denote the event that a patient has the index finding (type 2 diabetes), which constitutes a positive test result.\n\nThe problem provides the pre-test probability, or prevalence, of EH:\n$$P(H) = 10\\% = 0.1$$\n\nThe probability of not having EH is therefore:\n$$P(\\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\n\nFirst, we convert the pre-test probability into pre-test odds. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. The pre-test odds of EH are:\n$$Odds_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(H)}{P(\\neg H)} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nThe problem provides the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_+$.\n$$LR_+ = 2$$\nThe definition of the positive likelihood ratio is $LR_+ = \\frac{P(D|H)}{P(D|\\neg H)}$.\n\nBayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds and likelihood ratios as:\n$$Odds_{\\text{post}} = Odds_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR$$\nFor a positive test result, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_+$:\n$$Odds_{\\text{post}} = Odds_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_+$$\n\nSubstituting the known values, we can calculate the post-test odds of EH:\n$$Odds_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{9}$$\n\nFinally, we must convert these post-test odds back into a probability. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds is $p = \\frac{\\text{odds}}{1 + \\text{odds}}$. The post-test probability, $P(H|D)$, is therefore:\n$$P(H|D) = \\frac{Odds_{\\text{post}}}{1 + Odds_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{9}}{1 + \\frac{2}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{2}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{11}{9}} = \\frac{2}{11}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{2}{11} \\approx 0.181818...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1818$.",

Let there be two Bernoulli attributes measured at $12$ months: fertility preservation status $u_{F} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (where $u_{F}=1$ if the uterus is retained at $12$ months and $u_{F}=0$ otherwise) and oncologic status $u_{O} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (where $u_{O}=1$ if no endometrial carcinoma is present at $12$ months and $u_{O}=0$ if carcinoma is present).

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the expected utility for each of the three strategies and then solve a system of inequalities. The expected utility $E[U]$ for a given strategy is the sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, weighted by their respective probabilities: $E[U] = \\sum_{i} p_i U_i$.\n\nThe multiattribute utility for an outcome with fertility status $u_F$ and oncologic status $u_O$ is given by $U(u_F, u_O) = w\\,u_{F} + (1-w)\\,u_{O}$.\n\nFirst, we define the utility values for the possible outcome states, which are combinations of $(u_F, u_O)$:\n1.  **Regression:** Uterus is preserved, no cancer. $(u_F, u_O) = (1,1)$. The utility is $U_{Reg} = w(1) + (1-w)(1) = w + 1 - w = 1$.\n2.  **Progression to Cancer:** Cancer is present. This implies failure of both oncologic control and fertility preservation. $(u_F, u_O) = (0,0)$. The utility is $U_{Canc} = w(0) + (1-w)(0) = 0$.\n3.  **Persistence / Hysterectomy:** Uterus is removed, no cancer. $(u_F, u_O) = (0,1)$. The utility is $U_{Hyst} = w(0) + (1-w)(1) = 1-w$.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of persistence for the two medical management strategies.\nFor LNG-IUD:\n$p_{P,L} = 1 - p_{R,L} - p_{C,L} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{20}{20} - \\frac{15}{20} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nFor Oral Progestin:\n$p_{P,O} = 1 - p_{R,O} - p_{C,O} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{5}{10} - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected utility for each strategy.\n\n**1. Expected Utility of LNG-IUD ($E[U_L]$)**\nThe outcomes are regression, cancer, or persistence.\n$E[U_L] = p_{R,L} \\cdot U_{Reg} + p_{C,L} \\cdot U_{Canc} + p_{P,L} \\cdot U_{Hyst}$\n$E[U_L] = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)(1-w)$\n$E[U_L] = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1-w}{5} = \\frac{15 + 4(1-w)}{20} = \\frac{15+4-4w}{20} = \\frac{19-4w}{20}$\n\n**2. Expected Utility of Oral Progestin ($E[U_O]$)**\nThe outcomes are regression, cancer, or persistence.\n$E[U_O] = p_{R,O} \\cdot U_{Reg} + p_{C,O} \\cdot U_{Canc} + p_{P,O} \\cdot U_{Hyst}$\n$E[U_O] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)(1-w)$\n$E[U_O] = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2(1-w)}{5} = \\frac{5 + 4(1-w)}{10} = \\frac{5+4-4w}{10} = \\frac{9-4w}{10}$\n\n**3. Expected Utility of Hysterectomy ($E[U_H]$)**\nThis strategy has a single, certain outcome: hysterectomy. The probability is $1$.\n$E[U_H] = 1 \\cdot U_{Hyst} = 1-w$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum value $w^*$ in $[0,1]$ such that the LNG-IUD strategy is at least as good as the other two. This translates to the following system of inequalities:\n1) $E[U_L] \\geq E[U_O]$\n2) $E[U_L] \\geq E[U_H]$\n\nWe solve each inequality for $w$.\n\n**Inequality 1: $E[U_L] \\geq E[U_O]$**\n$\\frac{19-4w}{20} \\geq \\frac{9-4w}{10}$\nTo clear the denominators, we multiply both sides by $20$:\n$19-4w \\geq 2(9-4w)$\n$19-4w \\geq 18-8w$\n$4w \\geq -1$\n$w \\geq -\\frac{1}{4}$\nSince the domain for $w$ is $[0,1]$, this inequality is satisfied for all permissible values of $w$. This indicates that for any patient preference within the model's constraints, the LNG-IUD is always superior to or equivalent to oral progestin therapy.\n\n**Inequality 2: $E[U_L] \\geq E[U_H]$**\n$\\frac{19-4w}{20} \\geq 1-w$\nMultiply both sides by $20$:\n$19-4w \\geq 20(1-w)$\n$19-4w \\geq 20 - 20w$\n$16w \\geq 20 - 19$\n$16w \\geq 1$\n$w \\geq \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, $w$ must be in the set $\\{w \\in [0,1] \\mid w \\geq -1/4 \\text{ and } w \\geq 1/16\\}$. The intersection of these conditions is $w \\geq 1/16$.\nThe problem asks for the minimum value $w^*$ in this set. This minimum value is the threshold at which a patient's preference for fertility preservation is just high enough to make the LNG-IUD strategy preferable to or equivalent to immediate hysterectomy.\nTherefore, the minimum value is $w^* = \\frac{1}{16}$.",
