The terms ICER, NMB, QALY, and willingness-to-pay threshold are well-defined and central to the field. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data ($\\Delta C$, $\\Delta E$, $\\lambda$) are provided to compute the requested quantities. The language is objective and unambiguous. The numerical values are realistic for a new medical therapy. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the foundational definitions of cost-effectiveness analysis. We are given the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$, of a new therapy compared to a standard of care.\n\n1.  **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\n    The ICER is a primary metric in cost-effectiveness analysis. It represents the additional cost per unit of additional health outcome gained. By its fundamental definition, it is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n    \n    The expression for the ICER is:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n    $$\n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    \n    The numerical value of the ICER is calculated as:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{12000}{0.4} = \\frac{120000}{4} = 30000\n    $$\n    The units of the ICER are dollars per QALY, or $\\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n2.  **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n    The NMB is an alternative metric that quantifies the value of an intervention in monetary terms. It is derived by first monetizing the incremental health gain using the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, and then subtracting the incremental cost. The value $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$ represents the monetary worth of the health gain, and $\\Delta C$ is its cost. The net benefit is the difference.\n    \n    The expression for the NMB is:\n    $$\n    NMB = (\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n    $$\n    An intervention is considered cost-effective if its NMB is positive ($NMB  0$), meaning the monetized value of the health gain exceeds the cost.\n    \n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\lambda = 30000$ (in dollars per QALY)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    \n    The numerical value of the NMB is calculated as:\n    $$\n    NMB = (30000 \\cdot 0.4) - 12000 = 12000 - 12000 = 0\n    $$\n    The unit of the NMB is dollars ($\\$$). An NMB of $0$ indicates that the monetized health gain is exactly equal to the cost of the intervention.\n\n3.  **Decision Indicator (D)**\n    The decision indicator $D$ is to be formalized based on the NMB and the specified decision rules. The intervention is:\n    - Cost-effective if $NMB  0$.\n    - Indifferent if $NMB = 0$.\n    - Not cost-effective if $NMB  0$.\n    \n    The indicator $D$ is defined with the values $1$, $0$, and $-1$ corresponding to these three cases. This structure formally corresponds to the signum function, denoted $\\text{sgn}(x)$, which extracts the sign of a real number.\n    \n    Therefore, the decision indicator $D$ can be formalized as:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(NMB) = \\text{sgn}((\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C)\n    $$\n    where the signum function is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\text{sgn}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    We have already calculated that $NMB = 0$. Therefore, the value of the decision indicator is:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(0) = 0\n    $$\n    A value of $D=0$ signifies that the therapy is exactly on the cusp of cost-effectiveness at the given willingness-to-pay threshold. This is consistent with the finding that the $ICER = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$, which is equal to the threshold $\\lambda = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n**Summary of Computations**\n- ICER: $30000$ ($\\$/\\text{QALY}$)\n- NMB: $0$ ($\\$$)\n- Decision Indicator $D$: $0$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix $[\\text{ICER}, \\text{NMB}, D]$.",

            "solution": "**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe problem provides three strategies, $\\mathsf{A}$, $\\mathsf{B}$, and $\\mathsf{C}$, with their incremental costs ($\\Delta C$) and incremental effectiveness ($\\Delta E$) relative to the baseline strategy, usual care ($\\mathsf{A}$).\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{A}$ (Usual Care): $\\Delta C_{\\mathsf{A}} = \\$0$, $\\Delta E_{\\mathsf{A}} = 0.00$ QALYs.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{B}$ (NGS Panel): $\\Delta C_{\\mathsf{B}} = \\$7,300$, $\\Delta E_{\\mathsf{B}} = 0.10$ QALYs.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ (IHC-guided): $\\Delta C_{\\mathsf{C}} = \\$8,000$, $\\Delta E_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0.05$ QALYs.\n\nThe outcome measure is Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\nThe problem requires a stepwise analysis:\n1.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe analysis proceeds by following the four steps stipulated in the problem statement. We can tabulate the costs and effects of each strategy. Since strategy $\\mathsf{A}$ is the baseline, its incremental cost and effectiveness are zero.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{A}$: Cost $C_{\\mathsf{A}} = \\$0$, Effectiveness $E_{\\mathsf{A}} = 0.00$ QALYs.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{B}$: Cost $C_{\\mathsf{B}} = \\$7,300$, Effectiveness $E_{\\mathsf{B}} = 0.10$ QALYs.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{C}$: Cost $C_{\\mathsf{C}} = \\$8,000$, Effectiveness $E_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0.05$ QALYs.\n\n**1) Order strategies by increasing effectiveness**\n\nWe arrange the strategies in ascending order of their effectiveness ($E$):\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{A}$: $E_{\\mathsf{A}} = 0.00$ QALYs\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{C}$: $E_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0.05$ QALYs\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{B}$: $E_{\\mathsf{B}} = 0.10$ QALYs\n\nThe ordered list of strategies is $\\mathsf{A}$, $\\mathsf{C}$, $\\mathsf{B}$. Their respective costs are $C_{\\mathsf{A}} = \\$0$, $C_{\\mathsf{C}} = \\$8,000$, and $C_{\\mathsf{B}} = \\$7,300$.\n\n**2) Identify any strictly dominated strategy**\n\nA strategy is strictly dominated if there exists another strategy that is both less costly and more effective. The definition states a strategy is strictly dominated if it is weakly more costly ($C_{dominated} \\geq C_{dominant}$) and weakly less effective ($E_{dominated} \\leq E_{dominant}$), with at least one inequality being strict. We compare pairs of strategies.\n- Compare $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{C}$: $C_{\\mathsf{C}}  C_{\\mathsf{A}}$ and $E_{\\mathsf{C}}  E_{\\mathsf{A}}$. Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$: $C_{\\mathsf{B}}  C_{\\mathsf{A}}$ and $E_{\\mathsf{B}}  E_{\\mathsf{A}}$. Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare $\\mathsf{C}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$: We have $C_{\\mathsf{C}} = \\$8,000$ and $E_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0.05$ QALYs for strategy $\\mathsf{C}$, and $C_{\\mathsf{B}} = \\$7,300$ and $E_{\\mathsf{B}} = 0.10$ QALYs for strategy $\\mathsf{B}$.\n\nWe check if strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ is dominated by strategy $\\mathsf{B}$.\n- Cost comparison: $C_{\\mathsf{C}} = \\$8,000  \\$7,300 = C_{\\mathsf{B}}$. Strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ is strictly more costly than $\\mathsf{B}$.\n- Effectiveness comparison: $E_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0.05  0.10 = E_{\\mathsf{B}}$. Strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ is strictly less effective than $\\mathsf{B}$.\n\nSince strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ is both more costly and less effective than strategy $\\mathsf{B}$, it is strictly dominated by $\\mathsf{B}$. A rational planner would never choose strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ when $\\mathsf{B}$ is available. Therefore, strategy $\\mathsf{C}$ is removed from further consideration.\n\nThe remaining strategies are $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$.\n\n**3) Test for extended dominance**\n\nExtended dominance (or weak dominance by combination) occurs when a strategy's ICER, relative to the next less effective strategy on the efficiency frontier, is greater than the ICER of the next more effective strategy. This analysis requires at least three non-dominated strategies.\n\nThe remaining, non-dominated strategies, ordered by effectiveness, are:\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{A}$: $C_{\\mathsf{A}} = \\$0$, $E_{\\mathsf{A}} = 0.00$ QALYs.\n- Strategy $\\mathsf{B}$: $C_{\\mathsf{B}} = \\$7,300$, $E_{\\mathsf{B}} = 0.10$ QALYs.\n\nSince only two strategies remain, there is no intermediate strategy. The efficiency frontier consists of a single segment from $\\mathsf{A}$ to $\\mathsf{B}$. The concept of extended dominance is not applicable to eliminate any further strategies in this case. No strategy is extendedly dominated.\n\n**4) Compute the ICER of the remaining strategies**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the ICER for the most effective remaining strategy ($\\mathsf{B}$) compared to the next most effective strategy ($\\mathsf{A}$). The ICER is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(\\mathsf{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathsf{A}) = \\frac{C_{\\mathsf{B}} - C_{\\mathsf{A}}}{E_{\\mathsf{B}} - E_{\\mathsf{A}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides these incremental values directly, as all comparisons are relative to strategy $\\mathsf{A}$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\Delta C_{\\mathsf{B}} = C_{\\mathsf{B}} - C_{\\mathsf{A}} = \\$7,300\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\Delta E_{\\mathsf{B}} = E_{\\mathsf{B}} - E_{\\mathsf{A}} = 0.10 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the ICER formula:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$7,300}{0.10 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$73,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $73,000$. To express this unambiguously with four significant figures, we write it in scientific notation:\n$$\n73,000 = 7.300 \\times 10^4\n$$\nThis value represents the cost per QALY gained by choosing Strategy $\\mathsf{B}$ over Strategy $\\mathsf{A}$.",

We will calculate the probability of each pathway and the associated costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The expected cost and QALYs are the probability-weighted averages of these values over all possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, we define the population subsets based on true disease status (D: diseased, nD: not diseased) and screening test result (T+: positive, T-: negative). The probabilities of these states are derived from the given prevalence ($p$), sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}$), and specificity ($\\mathrm{Sp}$).\n\nThe four fundamental outcomes for any individual are:\n1.  True Positive (TP): The person has the disease and tests positive.\n    The probability is $P(TP) = P(T+ | D)P(D) = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p$.\n2.

The total cost is $C_{t} + C_{c} + C_{e}$. The health outcome is $Q_{e}$.\n- A FN individual is screened ($C_{t}$), receives no further immediate care, and is treated later ($C_{\\ell}$).
