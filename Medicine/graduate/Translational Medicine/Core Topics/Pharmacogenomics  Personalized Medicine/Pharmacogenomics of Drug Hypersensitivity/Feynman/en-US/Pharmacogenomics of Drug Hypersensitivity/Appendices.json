Case-control studies are a powerful design for this purpose, and the odds ratio ($OR$) is the primary metric used to quantify the strength of the association. This exercise provides hands-on practice in calculating and interpreting the $OR$ from raw study data, a core skill for critically evaluating the evidence that underpins a pharmacogenomic association .",

            "problem": "A translational pharmacogenomics case-control study is conducted to quantify the association between carriage of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I allele HLA-B*57:01 and Abacavir Hypersensitivity Syndrome (AHS). Investigators recruit hypersensitivity cases after clinically confirmed AHS and tolerant controls after uneventful abacavir exposure, and ascertain HLA-B*57:01 status by validated genotyping.\n\nUse only foundational epidemiologic definitions. In particular, use the definition that the odds of an event with probability $p$ is $\\frac{p}{1-p}$, and that sample odds can be constructed from observed counts by forming the ratio of counts corresponding to the event and non-event within the group of interest. Derive the odds ratio comparing the odds of hypersensitivity in HLA-B*57:01 carriers to the odds of hypersensitivity in non-carriers by appropriately using the $2\\times 2$ counts below. Do not use any shortcut formulas; build your derivation explicitly from the definition of odds.\n\nThe observed counts are:\n- Hypersensitivity cases: $75$ carriers of HLA-B*57:01 and $25$ non-carriers.\n- Tolerant controls: $5$ carriers of HLA-B*57:01 and $195$ non-carriers.\n\nAssume independent sampling within strata and no misclassification of genotype or phenotype. Compute the odds ratio and, based on its magnitude, provide a concise interpretation in the context of pharmacogenomics of drug hypersensitivity. Express the final odds ratio as a real number rounded to three significant figures. No units are required for the odds ratio.",
            "solution": "In a case-control study, the odds ratio ($OR$) is calculated as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls. Let's denote carriage of HLA-B*57:01 as the \"exposure\".\n\nFirst, we organize the data into a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & \\text{AHS Cases} & \\text{Tolerant Controls} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{HLA-B*57:01 Carrier} & 75 & 5 & 80 \\\\\n\\text{Non-carrier} & 25 & 195 & 220 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 100 & 200 & 300\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the odds of exposure (being a carrier) among the AHS cases, using the provided definition of sample odds as a ratio of counts:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of exposed cases}}{\\text{Number of unexposed cases}} = \\frac{75}{25} = 3\n$$\n\nThen, we calculate the odds of exposure among the tolerant controls:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of exposed controls}}{\\text{Number of unexposed controls}} = \\frac{5}{195} = \\frac{1}{39}\n$$\n\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{39}} = 3 \\times 39 = 117\n$$\n\nThe value $117$ has three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Interpretation:** An odds ratio of $117$ indicates an extremely strong association. It means the odds of being a carrier of HLA-B*57:01 are $117$ times higher for individuals who experience Abacavir Hypersensitivity Syndrome compared to those who tolerate the drug. This strong predictive power is the basis for using HLA-B*57:01 genetic screening to prevent this adverse reaction.",
