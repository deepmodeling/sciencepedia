The total number of subjects is $N = 2n$. The statistical model for the observation, assuming no sequence effect, is:\n$Y_{ijk} = \\mu + S_{ij} + P_k + T_{t(j,k)} + \\epsilon_{ijk}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the overall mean, $S_{ij}$ is the random effect of subject $i$ in sequence $j$, $P_k$ is the fixed effect of period $k$, $T_{t(j,k)}$ is the fixed effect of the treatment, and $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the within-subject random error with $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{ijk}) = \\sigma_{w}^{2}$.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the treatment effect $\\Delta$ that adjusts for period effects is $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{D}_2 - \\bar{D}_1)$, where $\\bar{D}_j$ is the mean of the within-subject period differences $Y_{ij2} - Y_{ij1}$ for sequence group $j$. The variance of this estimator is:\n$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2\\sigma_{w}^{2}}{N}$\n\nFor a large sample size, $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is approximately normally distributed. For a two-sided test with type I error $\\alpha$ and power $1-\\beta$ to detect a true difference of $\\Delta$, the required total sample size $N$ can be derived from the standard formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{2\\sigma_{w}^{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\nwhere $z_{q}$ is the $q$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $\\Delta = 0.5$\n- $\\sigma_{w}^{2} = 1.0$\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$ (two-sided)\n- $1 - \\beta = 0.9 \\implies \\beta = 0.1$\n\nWe need the corresponding quantiles (z-scores) from the standard normal distribution:\n- For the type I error rate: $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$. This value is approximately $1.95996$.\n- For the power: $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{1-0.1} = z_{0.9}$. This value is approximately $1.28155$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the sample size formula:\n$N = \\frac{2(1.0)(1.95996 + 1.28155)^2}{(0.5)^2}$\n$N = \\frac{2(3.24151)^2}{0.25}$\n$N = 8 \\times (3.24151)^2$\n$N = 8 \\times 10.50738$\n$N \\approx 84.05904$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numeric answer to four significant figures.\n$N \\approx 84.06$",

First, the validity of the problem statement will be assessed.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Study Design**: Two-period, two-sequence within-subject crossover design.\n- **Pharmacokinetic Model**: First-order elimination.\n- **Dosing**: Single oral dose per period.\n- **Terminal Half-Life**: $t_{1/2} = 12$ h.\n- **Washout Criterion**: The residual drug concentration at the start of the second period must be below a fraction $f = 0.01$ of the peak concentration ($C_{peak}$) observed in the first period.\n- **Required Output**: Minimum washout duration ($t_w$) in hours, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, specifically first-order elimination, which is a standard model for drug clearance.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe concentration of a drug, $C(t)$, that undergoes first-order elimination decreases over time according to the exponential decay model. We measure time $t$ starting from the point at which the peak concentration, $C_{\\text{peak}}$, is achieved. The concentration at any subsequent time $t$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe elimination rate constant $k_e$ is related to the drug's terminal half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time required for the concentration to decrease to $50\\%$ of its initial value. Therefore, at $t = t_{1/2}$:\n$$C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{peak}}$$\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{peak}} = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$$\nDividing by $C_{\\text{peak}}$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $k_e$ yields:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum washout duration, $t_w$, such that the residual concentration at the start of the second period, $C(t_w)$, is below a fraction $f = 0.01$ of the peak concentration from the first period. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$C(t_w) \\le f \\cdot C_{\\text{peak}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(t_w)$:\n$$C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t_w) \\le f \\cdot C_{\\text{peak}}$$\nWe can divide by $C_{\\text{peak}}$ since it is a positive concentration:\n$$\\exp(-k_e t_w) \\le f$$\nTo solve for $t_w$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. As the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-k_e t_w)) \\le \\ln(f)$$\n$$-k_e t_w \\le \\ln(f)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$k_e t_w \\ge -\\ln(f)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(f) = \\ln(1/f)$:\n$$k_e t_w \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\right)$$\nIsolating $t_w$:\n$$t_w \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{k_e}$$\nThis expression gives the minimum required washout duration.
