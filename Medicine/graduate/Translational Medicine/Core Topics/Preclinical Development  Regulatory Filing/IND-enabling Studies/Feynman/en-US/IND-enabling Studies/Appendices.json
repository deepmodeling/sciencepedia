The relationship is assumed to follow a power law:\n$$CL = a \\cdot (BW)^b$$\nwhere $a$ is the allometric coefficient and $b$ is the allometric exponent.\n\nTo fit this model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), we linearize the equation by taking the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a \\cdot (BW)^b)$$\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a) + \\ln((BW)^b)$$\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a) + b \\cdot \\ln(BW)$$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y = c + mx$, where:\n- $y = \\ln(CL)$\n- $x = \\ln(BW)$\n- $m = b$ (the slope of the line is the allometric exponent)\n- $c = \\ln(a)$ (the y-intercept is the natural logarithm of the allometric coefficient)\n\nFirst, we transform the given data by taking the natural logarithm of each $BW$ and $CL$ value.

Consider a reversible, competitive inhibitor of CYP3A, and assume metabolism of a sensitive probe substrate under conditions where substrate concentration is much lower than the Michaelis constant. Use the Michaelis–Menten framework for competitive inhibition, the law of mass action, and the definition of intrinsic clearance as the proportionality between metabolic rate and substrate concentration at low substrate levels. Define a conservative, dimensionless screening index $R_1$ that scales with the unbound inhibitor concentration and reflects the instantaneous fold-increase pressure on exposure consistent with competitive inhibition, expressed as a function of the maximum unbound plasma inhibitor concentration $I_{max,u}$ and the inhibition constant $K_i$.

Finally, use the prespecified trigger threshold of $1.02$ for basic screening to state whether further evaluation is warranted. Express your final numerical answer for the screening index as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of a basic static screening index, $R_1$, for assessing the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) potential of a new investigational small-molecule that acts as a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework based on Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. The rate of metabolism ($v$) of a substrate is given by:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction rate, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, which is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{max}$.\n\nIn the presence of a reversible, competitive inhibitor at a concentration $[I]$, the inhibitor binds to the same active site as the substrate. This increases the apparent Michaelis constant to $K_{m,app}$ without affecting $V_{max}$. The relationship is:\n$$ K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}\\right) $$\nHere, $[I_u]$ is the concentration of the unbound inhibitor, which is the pharmacologically active species, and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant, representing the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The rate of metabolism in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_I$, is therefore:\n$$ v_I = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_{m,app} + [S]} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} $$\nThe problem specifies that the metabolism is studied under conditions where the substrate concentration is much lower than the Michaelis constant, i.e., $[S] \\ll K_m$. This is a standard assumption for modeling in vivo linear pharmacokinetics. This condition allows for simplification of the rate equations.\n\nIn the absence of the inhibitor (control condition), the rate equation $v_0$ simplifies to:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\approx \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m} $$\nIn the presence of the inhibitor, the rate equation $v_I$ simplifies to:\n$$ v_I = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} \\approx \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}\\right)} $$\nThe problem requires using the definition of intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$. Intrinsic clearance relates the rate of metabolism to the substrate concentration in the linear range (low $[S]$), defined as $v = CL_{int} \\cdot [S]$. Comparing this definition with our simplified rate equations, we can identify expressions for the intrinsic clearance without inhibitor ($CL_{int,0}$) and with inhibitor ($CL_{int,I}$).\n\nFrom the uninhibited rate equation:\n$$ CL_{int,0} = \\frac{v_0}{[S]} = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_m} $$\nFrom the inhibited rate equation:\n$$ CL_{int,I} = \\frac{v_I}{[S]} = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}\\right)} = \\frac{CL_{int,0}}{1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}} $$\nThe screening index $R_1$ is defined to reflect the instantaneous fold-increase pressure on the exposure of the substrate drug. The exposure, often quantified by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), is inversely proportional to clearance ($CL$). In this static model, we use intrinsic clearance as a surrogate for total clearance. Thus, the ratio of exposure with the inhibitor ($\\text{AUC}_I$) to exposure without the inhibitor ($\\text{AUC}_0$) can be expressed as the inverse ratio of the corresponding intrinsic clearances:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_I}{\\text{AUC}_0} = \\frac{CL_{int,0}}{CL_{int,I}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $CL_{int,I}$ in terms of $CL_{int,0}$:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{CL_{int,0}}{\\frac{CL_{int,0}}{1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i}}} = 1 + \\frac{[I_u]}{K_i} $$\nFor a conservative screening assessment, we use the worst-case scenario for the inhibitor concentration, which is the maximum unbound plasma concentration, denoted as $I_{max,u}$. Therefore, the final expression for the screening index $R_1$ is:\n$$ R_1 = 1 + \\frac{I_{max,u}}{K_i} $$\nThis dimensionless index represents the predicted fold increase in the substrate's AUC due to competitive inhibition at the peak concentration of the inhibitor.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided values:\nMaximum unbound plasma inhibitor concentration, $I_{max,u} = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nInhibition constant, $K_i = 1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$ R_1 = 1 + \\frac{0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures, which gives $R_1 = 1.50$.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value to the prespecified trigger threshold of $1.02$.\nSince our calculated value $R_1 = 1.50$ is greater than the threshold of $1.02$, this basic screening test is positive.\n$$ 1.50 > 1.02 $$\nThis result indicates a potential for a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction. Therefore, further, more detailed evaluation (such as more complex static modeling, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, or a clinical DDI study) is warranted to better characterize the risk. The final numerical answer requested is the value of the screening index.",
