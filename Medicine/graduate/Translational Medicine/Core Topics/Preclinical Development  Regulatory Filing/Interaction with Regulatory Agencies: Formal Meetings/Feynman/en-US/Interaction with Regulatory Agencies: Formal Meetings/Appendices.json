            "problem": "A clinical-stage biotechnology company is preparing for a Type B formal meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the end of Phase $2$ in a translational medicine program for a novel anti-inflammatory biologic in a well-characterized immune-mediated disease. The team’s draft question is “Is our Phase $2$ design acceptable?” and they seek to reformulate it into a structured, answerable ask. The goal is to phrase the ask so the Agency can provide clear advice on pre-specified elements, consistent with first principles of effective regulatory interactions: questions should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART); focused on decision-enabling content; and grounded in established regulatory science frameworks such as the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E$9$(R$1$) estimand framework for defining treatment effects in the presence of intercurrent events, and Good Meeting Management Practices (GMMP) for scoping and clarity. In formal meetings, Agencies provide scientific and regulatory advice rather than approvals, using a benefit-risk framework guided by clearly articulated endpoints, analyses, and thresholds. A structured ask should therefore contain the essential design elements (population, intervention, comparator, endpoints, estimand, analysis plan, sample size, error rates), explicit success criteria that are both clinically meaningful and statistically evaluable, and clearly enumerated aspects for which concurrence is sought.\n\nWhich option best reformulates the draft question into a structured, answerable ask that includes the design elements, success criteria, and specific aspects for which agreement is sought?\n\nA.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Context:** A clinical-stage biotechnology company is preparing for a Type B formal meeting with the FDA at the end of a Phase $2$ translational medicine program.\n- **Product and Indication:** A novel anti-inflammatory biologic for a well-characterized immune-mediated disease.\n- **Initial Draft Question:** “Is our Phase $2$ design acceptable?”\n- **Goal:** Reformulate the draft question into a structured, answerable ask.\n- **Principles for an Effective Ask:**\n    1.  Questions should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n    2.  Questions should be focused on decision-enabling content.\n    3.  Questions must be grounded in established regulatory science frameworks (e.g., ICH E$9$(R$1$) estimand framework, Good Meeting Management Practices (GMMP)).\n    4.  The purpose of formal meetings is to receive scientific and regulatory advice, not approvals.\n    5.  Advice is provided within a benefit-risk framework.\n- **Required Components of a Structured Ask:**\n    1.  Essential design elements: population, intervention, comparator, endpoints, estimand, analysis plan, sample size, error rates.\n    2.  Explicit success criteria: clinically meaningful and statistically evaluable.\n    3.  Clearly enumerated aspects for which concurrence is sought.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established practices of pharmaceutical drug development and regulatory science. All concepts mentioned—Phase $2$ trials, Type B meetings, FDA, ICH E$9$(R$1$), estimands, power calculations, MMRM, etc.—are standard and factually correct within the field of translational medicine. The problem is relevant to the specified topic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of criteria for what constitutes a \"structured, answerable ask\" and then asks to select the option that best meets these criteria. This structure allows for a unique, best solution to be determined through logical evaluation.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, using precise, technical language. The criteria for evaluation are explicitly stated and are based on established professional and regulatory standards (GMMP, ICH guidances), not subjective opinion.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution will proceed by evaluating each option against the specified criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will evaluate each option against the three core requirements for a structured question as stipulated in the problem statement: (1) inclusion of essential design elements, (2) definition of explicit success criteria, and (3) enumeration of specific aspects for which concurrence is sought. The evaluation will also consider adherence to the general principles of effective regulatory interaction.\n\n**A. Evaluation of Option A**\n\nThis option proposes the following question: \"Does the Agency concur that, for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase $2$ trial in adults with moderate-to-severe disease defined by baseline Disease Activity Index (DAI) $\\,\\ge\\,6$, our proposed design—total sample size $n=180$, $2:1$ randomization to investigational biologic at a fixed dose versus placebo, $12$-week treatment, primary endpoint change from baseline in DAI at week $12$, estimand defined using the treatment policy strategy per ICH E$9$(R$1$), primary analysis via mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for baseline DAI and stratification factors, two-sided type I error $\\alpha=0.05$, power $1-\\beta=0.90$ to detect a mean difference $\\Delta=2.0$ points—with success declared if the observed mean difference is $\\ge \\Delta$ and the $95\\%$ confidence interval excludes $0$, and safety success defined as no increase in serious adverse events with a relative risk $>1.5$—is acceptable for the following specific aspects: (i) acceptability of the primary endpoint and estimand; (ii) handling of intercurrent events (rescue medication and treatment discontinuation) under a treatment policy strategy; (iii) control of familywise type I error at $\\alpha=0.05$ across key secondary endpoints using Hochberg procedures; (iv) an interim futility boundary triggered at conditional power $<0.20$ without unblinding by treatment arm; and (v) use of exposure–response analysis to justify Phase $3$ dose selection contingent on observing effect size $\\Delta$?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** This option is comprehensive. It specifies the Population (adults, moderate-to-severe disease, DAI $\\,\\ge\\,6$), Intervention (biologic), Comparator (placebo), Endpoint (change in DAI at week $12$), Estimand (treatment policy), Analysis plan (MMRM), and Sample size/statistical parameters ($n=180$, $2:1$ ratio, $\\alpha=0.05$, $1-\\beta=0.90$, $\\Delta=2.0$). It covers all required components.\n2.  **Success Criteria:** It provides explicit, statistically evaluable success criteria for both efficacy (observed mean difference $\\ge \\Delta$ and $95\\%$ CI excludes $0$) and safety (relative risk of serious adverse events $\\le 1.5$).\n3.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** It breaks the general request for acceptability into five discrete, technically specific, and decision-relevant questions. This aligns perfectly with GMMP and enables the agency to provide targeted, actionable advice.\n\nThis option fully adheres to all principles outlined in the problem statement. It transforms the vague initial question into a precise, multi-part query suitable for a formal regulatory meeting.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Evaluation of Option B**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Is our Phase $2$ design acceptable, and will FDA approve the drug if the trial meets its endpoints?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** None are specified. The question is generic.\n2.  **Success Criteria:** None are specified.\n3.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** None are enumerated.\n4.  **Regulatory Principles:** This question has two critical flaws. First, \"Is our Phase 2 design acceptable?\" is the exact vague question the problem seeks to improve. Second, asking for a pre-commitment to approval (\"will FDA approve the drug...\") is inappropriate for any formal meeting, especially at the End-of-Phase-$2$ stage. The agency provides advice, not guarantees of future approval.\n\nThis option fails on all criteria for a structured ask.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Evaluation of Option C**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Please confirm our overall development program is adequate, including our Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) strategy, nonclinical toxicology package, clinical pharmacology, labeling goals, Phase $2$ study design, budget, and timelines, and that our proposed dose will be commercially viable.\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** While it mentions \"Phase 2 study design\", it provides no details.\n2.  **Regulatory Principles:** This question is excessively broad and violates the principle of focused questions (GMMP). A single Type B meeting is not the forum to review an entire development program spanning CMC, nonclinical, and clinical. Furthermore, it asks for feedback on non-regulatory items such as \"budget,\" \"timelines,\" and \"commercial viability,\" which are outside the FDA's purview.\n\nThis option is improperly scoped and includes inappropriate topics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Evaluation of Option D**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Does the Agency agree that any positive change in DAI at week $12$ is clinically meaningful and that per-protocol analysis without adjustment for multiplicity is sufficient, given our planned $n=90$, single-arm Phase $2$ study with $\\alpha=0.10$ one-sided and $1-\\beta=0.70$?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** It specifies some elements ($n=90$, single-arm design, $\\alpha=0.10$, $1-\\beta=0.70$) but these describe a scientifically weak design. For a well-characterized disease, a single-arm study lacks a concurrent control and is generally insufficient for robust efficacy evaluation. A per-protocol analysis as the primary approach is disfavored due to bias. The statistical parameters ($\\alpha=0.10$, $1-\\beta=0.70$) are lax.\n2.  **Regulatory Principles:** This option asks for agreement on a flawed scientific approach. A sponsor should propose a robust, defensible plan, not a minimal one. The claim that \"any positive change...is clinically meaningful\" is also a weak assertion that requires substantial justification. This question represents a poor regulatory strategy, not an effective one.\n\nThis option proposes a scientifically questionable design and analysis plan, which is contrary to the goal of seeking advice on a robust program.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Evaluation of Option E**\n\nThis option proposes: \"Does the Agency concur with our plan to randomize $n=150$ participants $1:1$ to drug versus placebo with a $16$-week treatment period and DAI change at week $16$ as the primary endpoint, analyzed by analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline DAI, and that we will collect safety and pharmacokinetic data as exploratory measures?\"\n\n1.  **Design Elements:** It provides some key elements (Population is implied, Intervention, Comparator, Endpoint, some Analysis details, Sample size). However, it is critically incomplete.\n2.  **Missing Components:** It fails to specify the estimand and how intercurrent events will be handled, which is a key component of modern trial design per ICH E$9$(R$1$). It omits the target effect size, power ($1-\\beta$), and type I error rate ($\\alpha$).\n3.  **Success Criteria:** No explicit criteria for trial success are defined.\n4.  **Specific Aspects for Concurrence:** The question is a single, monolithic request for concurrence on a partial plan rather than an enumerated list of specific points for discussion.\n\nThis option is an improvement over B, C, and D, but it is substantially less complete and structured than option A. It omits several key components required by the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only choice that comprehensively and correctly incorporates all the required components of a structured, answerable question for a formal regulatory meeting as described in the problem statement. It presents a complete and robust clinical trial design, defines clear success criteria, and enumerates specific, decision-relevant points for which agency concurrence is sought, demonstrating a high level of regulatory and scientific acumen.",

            "problem": "A sponsor planning a first-in-human study for a small molecule in calendar quarter $Q4$ seeks to secure a formal Pre-Investigational New Drug (pre-IND) meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By definition, pre-IND meetings are Type B formal meetings with the FDA, and the FDA’s well-established scheduling goal is that Type B meetings occur within $60$ calendar days of receipt of a complete request and briefing package. The FDA expects a complete briefing package at the time of the meeting request. The sponsor’s internal governance requires a $30$-day drafting and quality-control cycle to finalize the meeting materials once pivotal Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology (tox) study results are in hand.\n\nAssume the following modeling framework to formalize the timeline:\n- Label calendar months by integers $1$ through $12$, with $1$ representing January and $12$ representing December.\n- Quarters are $Q1 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $Q2 = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$, $Q3 = \\{7, 8, 9\\}$, and $Q4 = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n- “Mid-$Q2$” availability of the final GLP tox results means results become available during the middle month of $Q2$, i.e., in month $5$.\n- Treat $30$ days as one calendar month and $60$ days as two calendar months for scheduling purposes.\n- The sponsor aims to hold the pre-IND meeting in $Q3$ to maximize the buffer to incorporate FDA feedback before the planned first-in-human start in $Q4$.\n\nUnder these assumptions and constraints, determine the optimal calendar month number (an integer between $1$ and $12$) in which the sponsor should submit the pre-IND meeting request to both incorporate the final GLP tox results and achieve the FDA’s $60$-day scheduling goal, while targeting a meeting in $Q3$ ahead of the planned $Q4$ start. Express your final answer as the calendar month number $1$ through $12$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the optimal calendar month for a sponsor to submit a pre-Investigational New Drug (pre-IND) meeting request to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The solution is derived by constructing a timeline based on the provided constraints and applying the stated optimization criterion.\n\nLet us define the relevant variables and parameters based on the problem statement.\n- Let $M$ denote a calendar month, represented by an integer from $1$ (January) to $12$ (December).\n- The calendar quarters are defined as $Q1 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $Q2 = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$, $Q3 = \\{7, 8, 9\\}$, and $Q4 = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n- Let $M_{tox}$ be the month when the final Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study results become available. According to the problem, this occurs in \"mid-$Q2$\", which is specified as month $5$. Thus, $M_{tox} = 5$.\n- Let $T_{prep}$ be the duration of the internal drafting and quality-control cycle required to finalize the meeting materials. This is given as $30$ days, which is modeled as $1$ calendar month. So, $T_{prep} = 1$ month.\n- Let $T_{FDA}$ be the FDA's scheduling goal for a Type B meeting. This is given as $60$ days, which is modeled as $2$ calendar months. So, $T_{FDA} = 2$ months.\n- Let $M_{submit}$ be the calendar month in which the sponsor submits the meeting request. This is the value we are tasked to determine.\n- Let $M_{meeting}$ be the calendar month in which the pre-IND meeting is held.\n\nThe logical sequence of events is governed by several constraints.\n\nFirst Constraint: Package Readiness. The meeting request requires a complete briefing package. The preparation of this package takes $T_{prep} = 1$ month and commences once the GLP tox results are available. The results are available in month $M_{tox} = 5$. The preparation work is therefore completed during the subsequent month. This implies that the earliest the complete package is ready for submission is at the beginning of month $6$. Let $M_{ready}$ be the first month in which submission is possible.\n$$M_{ready} = M_{tox} + T_{prep} = 5 + 1 = 6$$\nTherefore, any valid submission month $M_{submit}$ must satisfy the condition:\n$$M_{submit} \\ge 6$$\n\nSecond Constraint: FDA Scheduling Timeline. The problem states that Type B meetings are scheduled to occur within $60$ days, modeled as $T_{FDA} = 2$ months, of the receipt of the request. The relationship between the meeting month and the submission month can be written as:\n$$M_{meeting} = M_{submit} + T_{FDA} = M_{submit} + 2$$\n\nThird Constraint: Target Meeting Quarter. The sponsor aims to hold the meeting in the third quarter, $Q3$, to maximize preparedness for the $Q4$ study start. The months in $Q3$ are $\\{7, 8, 9\\}$. This imposes a constraint on the meeting month:\n$$M_{meeting} \\in \\{7, 8, 9\\}$$\n\nWe can now combine these constraints to determine the set of permissible submission months. By substituting the expression for $M_{meeting}$ from the second constraint into the third constraint, we obtain:\n$$M_{submit} + 2 \\in \\{7, 8, 9\\}$$\nSolving for $M_{submit}$ by subtracting $2$ from each element in the set gives the possible range for the submission month based on the desired meeting quarter:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{7-2, 8-2, 9-2\\}$$\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{5, 6, 7\\}$$\n\nThis set of potential submission months must also satisfy the first constraint, which is that the briefing package must be ready ($M_{submit} \\ge 6$). We find the intersection of the two conditions for $M_{submit}$:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{5, 6, 7\\} \\cap \\{M \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid M \\ge 6\\}$$\nThe resulting set of valid submission months is:\n$$M_{submit} \\in \\{6, 7\\}$$\n\nThis indicates two possible scenarios:\n- If the sponsor submits in $M_{submit} = 6$, the meeting will occur in $M_{meeting} = 6 + 2 = 8$. Month $8$ is in $Q3$.\n- If the sponsor submits in $M_{submit} = 7$, the meeting will occur in $M_{meeting} = 7 + 2 = 9$. Month $9$ is in $Q3$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the optimization criterion: \"to maximize the buffer to incorporate FDA feedback before the planned first-in-human start in $Q4$.\" A larger buffer is achieved by holding the meeting as early as possible. A meeting in month $8$ provides a larger buffer before $Q4$ (which begins in month $10$) than a meeting in month $9$. The earlier meeting in month $8$ results from the earlier submission in month $6$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal calendar month for the sponsor to submit the pre-IND meeting request is month $6$.",

The FDA meeting minutes include required feedback that must be implemented before the milestone \"First Patient In\" can occur.

Both workstreams must be completed before enrollment can begin. \n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic constraints consistent with critical path reasoning:\n- The assay validation requires a duration of $6$ weeks from initiation to completion, contingent on predefined performance specifications, and cannot be compressed further due to laboratory throughput limits.\n- The protocol amendment, IRB re-approval, and site activation collectively require a duration of $8$ weeks, driven by document revision cycles and regulatory board meeting schedules.\n- Because of shared subject-matter experts and the need for cross-referenced assay specifications in the amended protocol, the two workstreams cannot fully overlap.

Let the feasible overlap be $o = 2$ (weeks). Because both tasks are mandatory prerequisites, the milestone cannot occur until both are complete. Given both tasks can start at time $t = 0$, the total time to complete both with overlap equals the sum of the two durations minus the length of their concurrent execution, which is bounded above by $o$.\n\nFormally, if one schedules both tasks to maximize overlap subject to the constraint that overlap cannot exceed $o$, the time to complete both is\n$D = d_{A} + d_{B} - o$,\nprovided that $o \\leq \\min(d_{A}, d_{B})$, which is necessary for the overlap to be realizable.
