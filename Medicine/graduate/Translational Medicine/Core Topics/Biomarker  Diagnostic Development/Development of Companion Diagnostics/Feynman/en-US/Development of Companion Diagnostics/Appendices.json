            "problem": "A translational medicine team is developing an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based companion diagnostic (CDx) to enrich patients likely to benefit from a targeted therapy. In IHC scoring, tumor cells are categorized by membrane staining intensity into ordinal classes denoted `0`, `1+`, `2+`, and `3+` based on visual assessment. For regulatory-grade analytical validation and clinical cut-off setting, the team needs a scalar index that summarizes the distribution of staining intensities across all tumor cells into a single value with a fixed dynamic range suitable for cohort stratification and between-laboratory comparability.\n\nStarting only from foundational principles of measurement and probability (specifically, the definition of a weighted mean as an expectation of a discrete random variable and the interpretation of observed category proportions as an empirical probability distribution), derive a mathematically justified expression for an index that:\n- Treats the staining intensity as a discrete random variable $I$ taking values in $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$,\n- Aggregates the contributions of all intensity categories in a linear, frequency-weighted manner,\n- Yields a unitless index with a dynamic range spanning from $0$ (all cells at $0$) to $300$ (all cells at $3^{+}$) when category frequencies are provided as percentages that sum to $100$.\n\nThen, using your derived expression, compute the index (commonly referred to as the H-score in IHC-based CDx development) for a specimen in which a board-certified pathologist reports the following percentage of tumor cells in each category:\n- $0$: $18\\%$\n- $1^{+}$: $37\\%$\n- $2^{+}$: $25\\%$\n- $3^{+}$: $20\\%$\n\nProvide the final index as an exact integer (unitless).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a scalar index for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and its subsequent calculation for a given specimen. The derivation must adhere to specific foundational principles and constraints.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Context**: Development of an IHC-based companion diagnostic (CDx) in translational medicine.\n- **Scoring System**: Tumor cells are categorized by staining intensity into ordinal classes: $0$, $1^{+}$, $2^{+}$, and $3^{+}$.\n- **Objective**: Derive a scalar index that summarizes the distribution of staining intensities.\n- **Index Requirements**:\n    1.  The index treats staining intensity as a discrete random variable $I$ taking values in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    2.  The index aggregates contributions from all intensity categories in a linear, frequency-weighted manner.\n    3.  The index must be unitless and have a dynamic range from $0$ to $300$.\n    4.  The range from $0$ to $300$ corresponds to category frequencies being provided as percentages that sum to $100$.\n- **Foundational Principles**:\n    1.  Use the definition of a weighted mean as the expectation of a discrete random variable.\n    2.  Interpret observed category proportions as an empirical probability distribution.\n- **Data for Calculation**:\n    - Percentage of cells in category $0$: $18\\%$\n    - Percentage of cells in category $1^{+}$: $37\\%$\n    - Percentage of cells in category $2^{+}$: $25\\%$\n    - Percentage of cells in category $3^{+}$: $20\\%$\n- **Final Output Requirement**: The calculated index (H-score) must be an exact integer.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the field of pathology and translational oncology. IHC scoring, the use of intensity categories, and the concept of an H-score are standard, well-established practices for quantifying protein expression to guide therapeutic decisions (e.g., for HER2 or PD-L1). The approach is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies the variable, its possible values, the necessary properties of the index to be derived, and provides all data required for the calculation. The constraints are sufficient to determine a unique mathematical expression for the index.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Consistency**: The given percentages ($18\\% + 37\\% + 25\\% + 20\\% = 100\\%$) are internally consistent. The requirements for the index are not contradictory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Index (H-Score)**\n\nAs per the problem statement, we begin by defining the staining intensity as a discrete random variable, which we denote as $I$. The set of possible values for $I$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, corresponding to the IHC staining categories $0$, $1^{+}$, $2^{+}$, and $3^{+}$, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the observed category proportions should be interpreted as an empirical probability distribution. Let $p_i$ denote the percentage of tumor cells observed in intensity category $i$, where $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The probability of a randomly selected cell having an intensity of $i$, denoted $P(I=i)$, is therefore the percentage converted to a proportion:\n$$P(I=i) = \\frac{p_i}{100}$$\nBy definition, the sum of these probabilities over all possible outcomes must equal $1$:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P(I=i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} \\frac{p_i}{100} = \\frac{1}{100} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} p_i$$\nSince the percentages sum to $100$, we have $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} p_i = 100$, which correctly yields $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P(I=i) = 1$.\n\nThe problem requires a linear, frequency-weighted aggregation of the intensity contributions. This is precisely the definition of the expected value (or mean) of a discrete random variable, which is a weighted average of its possible values, with the weights being their respective probabilities. The expected value of $I$, denoted $E[I]$, is:\n$$E[I] = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot P(I=i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot \\frac{p_i}{100} = \\frac{1}{100} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot p_i$$\nLet us examine the dynamic range of $E[I]$.\n- The minimum value occurs when all cells are in category $0$ ($p_0 = 100$, $p_1=p_2=p_3=0$).\n$$E[I]_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{100} (0 \\cdot 100 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 0) = 0$$\n- The maximum value occurs when all cells are in category $3^{+}$ ($p_3 = 100$, $p_0=p_1=p_2=0$).\n$$E[I]_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{100} (0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 100) = \\frac{300}{100} = 3$$\nThe dynamic range of $E[I]$ is therefore $[0, 3]$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the final index, which we will call the H-score ($H$), must have a dynamic range from $0$ to $300$. To map the range $[0, 3]$ of $E[I]$ onto the desired range $[0, 300]$, we must apply a linear scaling transformation. Let this scaling be $H = k \\cdot E[I]$ for some constant $k$. We can determine $k$ by relating the maximum values:\n$$H_{\\max} = k \\cdot E[I]_{\\max}$$\n$$300 = k \\cdot 3$$\nSolving for $k$ gives $k = 100$.\n\nNow we can write the final, mathematically justified expression for the H-score:\n$$H = 100 \\cdot E[I] = 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{100} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot p_i\\right)$$\n$$H = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot p_i$$\nThis expression satisfies all the stated requirements. It is a linear sum where each intensity value $i$ is weighted by its percentage frequency $p_i$. Its minimum value is $0 \\cdot 100 = 0$ and its maximum value is $3 \\cdot 100 = 300$.\n\n**Calculation for the Given Specimen**\n\nWe are given the following percentages for a specific tumor specimen:\n- $p_0 = 18$ (for intensity $i=0$)\n- $p_1 = 37$ (for intensity $i=1$)\n- $p_2 = 25$ (for intensity $i=2$)\n- $p_3 = 20$ (for intensity $i=3$)\n\nUsing the derived formula for the H-score:\n$$H = (0 \\cdot p_0) + (1 \\cdot p_1) + (2 \\cdot p_2) + (3 \\cdot p_3)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$H = (0 \\cdot 18) + (1 \\cdot 37) + (2 \\cdot 25) + (3 \\cdot 20)$$\n$$H = 0 + 37 + 50 + 60$$\n$$H = 147$$\nThe H-score for the specimen is an exact integer, $147$.",

The test has sensitivity $Se = 0.95$ and specificity $Sp = 0.98$. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as the probability that a patient truly has the biomarker given a positive test result.

It is based on the fundamental principles of probability theory, specifically Bayes' theorem, applied to the standard biostatistical measures of diagnostic test performance (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and positive predictive value). The context is standard for the field of translational medicine and companion diagnostics. All variables are clearly defined, and the data provided ($Se = 0.95$, $Sp = 0.98$, $p_1 = 0.05$, $p_2 = 0.20$) are consistent and realistic for a clinical setting. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value, $PPV$, and then to calculate its change for two different values of prevalence, $p$. The $PPV$ is defined as the conditional probability of a patient having the biomarker ($D$) given that the test result is positive ($+$). This can be written as $PPV = P(D \\mid +)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes’ theorem:\n$$\nP(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}\n$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly in the problem statement:\n-   $P(+ \\mid D) = Se$ (Sensitivity)\n-   $P(D) = p$ (Prevalence)\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on the true biomarker status, $D$ or $\\neg D$:\n$$\nP(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)\n$$\nWe can express the terms in this expansion using the given definitions:\n-   $P(+ \\mid D) = Se$\n-   $P(D) = p$\n-   The probability of not having the biomarker is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n-   The term $P(+ \\mid \\neg D)$ is the probability of a positive test in a subject without the biomarker, which is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Specificity is defined as $Sp = P(- \\mid \\neg D)$. Since for a given condition (here, $\\neg D$), the probabilities of all possible outcomes must sum to $1$, we have $P(+ \\mid \\neg D) + P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1$. Therefore, $P(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this full expression for $P(+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem for $PPV$:\n$$\nPPV(p, Se, Sp) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the Positive Predictive Value as a function of prevalence $p$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$.\n\nNext, we use the provided values ($Se = 0.95$ and $Sp = 0.98$) to compute the $PPV$ for the two given prevalence values.\n\nFor the initial Phase II study, the prevalence is $p_1 = 0.05$. The corresponding $PPV_1$ is:\n$$\nPPV_1 = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.05}{0.95 \\cdot 0.05 + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.05)}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_1 = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0475 + (0.02)(0.95)}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_1 = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0475 + 0.019}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_1 = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0665} \\approx 0.7142857...\n$$\nFor the later multicenter rollout with an enriched population, the prevalence is $p_2 = 0.20$. The corresponding $PPV_2$ is:\n$$\nPPV_2 = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.20}{0.95 \\cdot 0.20 + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.20)}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_2 = \\frac{0.19}{0.19 + (0.02)(0.80)}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_2 = \\frac{0.19}{0.19 + 0.016}\n$$\n$$\nPPV_2 = \\frac{0.19}{0.206} \\approx 0.9223300...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the numerical change in $PPV$, which is $\\Delta PPV = PPV_2 - PPV_1$.\n$$\n\\Delta PPV = 0.9223300... - 0.7142857... = 0.2080443...\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.2080$.\n\nThe clinical impact of this change is substantial. By enriching the patient population to increase biomarker prevalence from $0.05$ to $0.20$, the confidence that a positive test result correctly identifies a patient with the actionable mutation rises from a probability of approximately $0.71$ to $0.92$. This enhancement in predictive power is critical for clinical practice as it significantly reduces the number of patients who would be incorrectly identified for a targeted therapy (i.e., false positives). This improves patient safety by avoiding unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic treatments and ensures the therapy is more accurately allocated to the patient population most likely to derive a clinical benefit.",
