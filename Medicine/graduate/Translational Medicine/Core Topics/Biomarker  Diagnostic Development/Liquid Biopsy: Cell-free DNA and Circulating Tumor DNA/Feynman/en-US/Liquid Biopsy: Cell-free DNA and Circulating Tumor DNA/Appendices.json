            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and statistics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the average number of template molecules per droplet, $\\lambda$, based on the fraction of positive droplets, $p$, and then to calculate a numerical value for $\\lambda$ from experimental data.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that the number of target molecules, let's call this integer variable $k$, in any given droplet follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) representing the number of target molecules in a droplet.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a droplet is scored as \"negative\" if it contains zero target molecules. Therefore, the probability of a droplet being negative, which we can denote as $p_{\\text{neg}}$, corresponds to the case where $k=0$:\n$$p_{\\text{neg}} = P(k=0; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!}$$\nSince $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$p_{\\text{neg}} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nA droplet is scored as \"positive\" if it contains at least one target molecule, i.e., $k \\ge 1$. The problem statement assumes unit detection efficiency, meaning a droplet with $k \\ge 1$ molecules will always be detected as positive. The probability of a droplet being positive, denoted by $p$, is the complement of the probability of it being negative:\n$$p = P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - p_{\\text{neg}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{\\text{neg}}$, we get the relationship between the fraction of positive droplets $p$ and the mean template copies per droplet $\\lambda$:\n$$p = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of $p$, we rearrange the equation above:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - p$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda)) = \\ln(1 - p)$$\n$$-\\lambda = \\ln(1 - p)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ yields the desired expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(1 - p)$$\nThis is the required expression. It is a cornerstone of absolute quantification using digital PCR, often referred to as a \"Poisson correction\".\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the provided experimental data. The total number of droplets generated is $N_{\\text{total}} = 18,000$. The number of observed positive droplets is $N_{\\text{pos}} = 3,600$.\n\nThe observed fraction of positive droplets, $p$, is the ratio of the number of positive droplets to the total number of droplets:\n$$p = \\frac{N_{\\text{pos}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{3,600}{18,000} = \\frac{36}{180} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nNow, we substitute this value of $p$ into the derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(1 - 0.2)$$\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(0.8)$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the natural logarithm of $0.8$:\n$$\\ln(0.8) \\approx -0.2231435513$$\nTherefore, $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\\lambda \\approx -(-0.2231435513) \\approx 0.2231435513$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $3$, and $1$.

To mitigate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification biases and sequencing errors, the workflow attaches a random Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) of length $L$ nucleotides to each input cfDNA molecule prior to any amplification. Assume the UMI alphabet is the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alphabet with $4$ equiprobable nucleotides per position, and that UMI assignment is independent and uniform across molecules.\n\nExplain mechanistically how UMIs enable deduplication of PCR duplicates and consensus-based error correction of sequencing errors in the context of cfDNA/ctDNA variant calling.

            "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question grounded in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and probability theory. It consists of two parts: a qualitative explanation of the function of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and a quantitative derivation to determine the minimal UMI length required to keep the probability of random UMI collisions below a specified threshold.\n\n### Mechanistic Role of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)\n\nUMIs are short, random oligonucleotide sequences attached to nucleic acid molecules (in this case, cell-free DNA or cfDNA) before any amplification steps, such as the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Each original molecule is intended to be tagged with a unique UMI. This initial labeling enables two critical functions in downstream analysis: the correction of amplification bias and the mitigation of process-induced errors.\n\n1.  **Deduplication of PCR Duplicates for Unbiased Quantification**: PCR amplification is not perfectly efficient and is subject to stochastic effects and sequence-dependent biases. Consequently, some DNA templates amplify more readily than others, leading to a skewed representation of the original molecular population in the final sequencing library. By design, all amplicons derived from a single original cfDNA molecule will share the same UMI, as well as the same genomic start and end mapping coordinates. After sequencing, bioinformatic analysis can group reads into \"families\" based on this identical UMI and alignment position. All reads within such a family are considered PCR duplicates originating from one parent molecule. For quantitative applications, such as measuring the variant allele frequency (VAF) of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation, the entire read family is collapsed and counted as a single observation. This deduplication process removes the distortionary effect of amplification bias, allowing for a more accurate and unbiased estimate of the true prevalence of molecules in the original, pre-amplification sample.\n\n2.  **Consensus-Based Error Correction for High-Fidelity Sequencing**: Both PCR and the sequencing process itself introduce errors at low but non-zero rates. These errors can be indistinguishable from true, low-frequency biological variants, such as rare ctDNA mutations. The UMI framework provides a powerful mechanism for error correction. Since all reads within a UMI-defined family originate from the same initial molecule, any nucleotide differences among them must be artifacts of PCR or sequencing. By constructing a consensus sequence for each read family (e.g., by taking the majority-vote base at each position), these random errors can be effectively filtered out. For a base to be called in the consensus, it must be observed in a majority of the reads within that family, making it highly improbable that a random error would persist. This consensus-based approach dramatically reduces the background error rate, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and enabling the confident detection of genuine low-VAF variants.\n\n### Derivation of Minimal UMI Length\n\nThe quantitative part of the problem requires deriving the minimal UMI length, $L$, to ensure the probability of a \"collision\" is below a target threshold. A collision occurs when two or more distinct input molecules are inadvertently labeled with the same UMI sequence.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of input DNA molecules, and let $M$ be the total number of possible UMI sequences. The UMI is of length $L$ with an alphabet of $4$ nucleotides, so $M = 4^L$. The problem of UMI collision is analogous to the classical \"birthday problem,\" where we are assigning $n$ molecules (balls) to $M$ possible UMI sequences (bins), with each assignment being independent and uniformly random.\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one collision, $P_{\\text{coll}}$. It is more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: no collisions. The probability of no collisions, $P_{\\text{no coll}}$, is the probability that all $n$ molecules are assigned distinct UMIs.\n\nThe first molecule can be assigned any of the $M$ UMIs.\nThe second molecule must be assigned one of the remaining $M-1$ UMIs to avoid a collision. The probability of this is $\\frac{M-1}{M}$.\nThe third molecule must be assigned one of the remaining $M-2$ UMIs. The probability is $\\frac{M-2}{M}$.\n...\nThe $n$-th molecule must be assigned one of the remaining $M - (n-1)$ UMIs. The probability is $\\frac{M-n+1}{M}$.\n\nThe total probability of no collisions is the product of these individual probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{no coll}} = \\frac{M}{M} \\times \\frac{M-1}{M} \\times \\frac{M-2}{M} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac{M-n+1}{M} = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{M-k}{M} = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{M}\\right)$$\n\nFor a large $M$, we can approximate this product. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides allows us to convert the product into a sum:\n$$\\ln(P_{\\text{no coll}}) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{M}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{M}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states we are in the regime where $n \\ll \\sqrt{M}$, which implies $n^2 \\ll M$, and therefore $k/M$ is very small for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. We can use the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm, $\\ln(1-x) = -x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\dots$, and for small $x$, we can approximate $\\ln(1-x) \\approx -x$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\\ln(P_{\\text{no coll}}) \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left(-\\frac{k}{M}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k$$\n\nThe sum of the first $n-1$ non-negative integers is given by the formula $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = \\frac{(n-1)n}{2}$. Substituting this into our expression:\n$$\\ln(P_{\\text{no coll}}) \\approx -\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}$$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the approximate probability of no collisions:\n$$P_{\\text{no coll}} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}\\right)$$\n\nThe probability of at least one collision is $P_{\\text{coll}} = 1 - P_{\\text{no coll}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{coll}} \\approx 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}\\right)$$\n\nWe are given the requirement that this probability must be strictly less than a target level $p$. This gives us the inequality:\n$$1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}\\right) < p$$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for $M$.\n$$1 - p < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(1-p) < -\\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$-\\ln(1-p) > \\frac{n(n-1)}{2M}$$\nFinally, rearranging to solve for $M$ yields the analytic criterion:\n$$M > \\frac{n(n-1)}{-2\\ln(1-p)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values: $n = 10,000,000 = 10^7$ and $p=0.01$.\nFor $n=10^7$, the term $n(n-1) = 10^7(10^7-1)$ is extremely close to $n^2 = (10^7)^2 = 10^{14}$. This approximation is well justified. The value for the logarithm is $-\\ln(1-0.01) = -\\ln(0.99)$.\n$$M > \\frac{10^7(10^7 - 1)}{-2\\ln(0.99)} \\approx \\frac{10^{14}}{-2(-0.01005033585...)} \\approx \\frac{10^{14}}{0.0201006717} \\approx 4.97496 \\times 10^{15}$$\n\nWe require the UMI space size $M$ to be greater than approximately $4.975 \\times 10^{15}$. The size of the UMI space is given by $M=4^L$. We must find the minimal integer $L$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$4^L > 4.975 \\times 10^{15}$$\nTo solve for $L$, we take the logarithm base $4$ of both sides.\n$$L > \\log_4(4.975 \\times 10^{15})$$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(b)}$:\n$$L > \\frac{\\ln(4.975 \\times 10^{15})}{\\ln(4)}$$\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\ln(4.975 \\times 10^{15}) \\approx \\ln(4.975) + 15\\ln(10) \\approx 1.60443 + 15(2.30259) \\approx 1.60443 + 34.53885 \\approx 36.14328$$\n$$\\ln(4) \\approx 1.38629$$\n$$L > \\frac{36.14328}{1.38629} \\approx 26.0718$$\n\nSince $L$ must be an integer representing the number of nucleotides, we must choose the smallest integer greater than $26.0718$.\nTherefore, the minimal integer UMI length is $L=27$.\n\nFinally, we verify that the approximation regime $n \\ll \\sqrt{M}$ is valid for $L=27$.\n$M = 4^{27} = (2^2)^{27} = 2^{54} \\approx 1.8014 \\times 10^{16}$.\n$\\sqrt{M} = \\sqrt{4^{27}} = 2^{27} \\approx 1.342 \\times 10^8$.\nThe number of molecules is $n=10^7$.\nThe condition $10^7 \\ll 1.342 \\times 10^8$ is satisfied, as $n$ is more than an order of magnitude smaller than $\\sqrt{M}$, justifying the approximations used in the derivation.",

This is given by the constraint:\n$$1 - (1 - t_{0})^{M} \\le \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sample}}$$\nwhere $t_0$ is the per-locus false positive rate (the Type I error for a single locus). Given the values $M=1000$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sample}} = 0.001$, $t_0$ must be very small. For small $x$, the inequality $1 - (1-x) \\approx x$ holds. For multiple tests, the Bonferroni correction approximates the FWER as $M \\times t_0$. This provides a slightly more conservative (stricter) threshold for $t_0$ but is computationally simpler and a standard, justifiable approximation in this context.

The per-locus false positive rate $t_0$ is the probability of observing $k$ or more mutant families:\n$$t_0 = P(X_0 \\ge k)$$\nSince the number of trials $D$ is large and the probability $p_0$ is very small, we can approximate the binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. The mean of this Poisson distribution is $\\lambda_0 = D \\times p_0$.\n$$\\lambda_{0} = 5000 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.1$$\nSo, $X_0 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_0 = 0.1)$. We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $P(X_0 \\ge k) \\le 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.

This corresponds to calculating the probability of observing $k \\ge 5$ mutant families under the alternative hypothesis.\n\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, a UMI family reports a mutant with probability $p_1$.
