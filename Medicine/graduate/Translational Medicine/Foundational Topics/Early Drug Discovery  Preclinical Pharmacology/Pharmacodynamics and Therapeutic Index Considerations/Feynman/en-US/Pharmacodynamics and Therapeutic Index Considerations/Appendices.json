The parameters and values provided ($EC_{50} = 2.50$ nM, $n=1$) are realistic for a targeted kinase inhibitor. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $EC_{90}$**\n\nThe relationship between pharmacologic effect ($E$) and drug concentration ($C$) is described by the sigmoidal $E_{\\max}$ model, also known as the Hill equation:\n$$E(C) = E_0 + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\nHere, $E_0$ is the baseline effect, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect increment produced by the drug, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, and $K$ is the concentration at which half of the maximal effect increment is achieved. By definition, $K$ is identical to $EC_{50}$. Thus, the equation can be written as:\n$$E(C) = E_0 + \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nThe drug-induced effect is the increase over baseline, which we can denote as $\\Delta E(C) = E(C) - E_0$.\n$$\\Delta E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nThe problem defines $EC_p$ as the concentration $C$ that produces an effect increment equal to a fraction $p$ of the maximal increment, $E_{\\max}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\\Delta E(EC_p) = p \\cdot E_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the model into this definition, we get:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot (EC_p)^n}{EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n} = p \\cdot E_{\\max}$$\nSince $E_{\\max}$ represents a non-zero maximal effect, we can divide both sides by $E_{\\max}$:\n$$p = \\frac{(EC_p)^n}{EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n}$$\nWe now solve for $EC_p$.\n$$p(EC_{50}^n + (EC_p)^n) = (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n + p \\cdot (EC_p)^n = (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n = (EC_p)^n - p \\cdot (EC_p)^n$$\n$$p \\cdot EC_{50}^n = (EC_p)^n (1 - p)$$\n$$(EC_p)^n = EC_{50}^n \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides yields the general formula for $EC_p$:\n$$EC_p = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n}$$\nWe are asked to compute $EC_{90}$ for a drug with $n=1$ and $EC_{50} = 2.50$ nM. We set $p=0.90$ and $n=1$.\n$$EC_{90} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.90}{1-0.90}\\right)^{1/1}$$\n$$EC_{90} = 2.50 \\text{ nM} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.90}{0.10}\\right)$$\n$$EC_{90} = 2.50 \\text{ nM} \\times 9$$\n$$EC_{90} = 22.5 \\text{ nM}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$EC_{90} = 22.50 \\text{ nM}$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Role of the Hill Coefficient ($n$)**\n\nThe Hill coefficient, $n$, quantifies the cooperativity of the drug-receptor interaction and dictates the steepness of the concentration-effect curve.\n-   If $n=1$, the relationship follows simple ligand-receptor binding kinetics (Michaelis-Menten-like), indicating no cooperativity.\n-   If $n>1$, there is positive cooperativity, meaning the binding of one drug molecule increases the affinity for subsequent molecules.\n-   If $n<1$, there is negative cooperativity, where binding of one molecule decreases the affinity for others.\n\n**Effect on Curve Steepness and Pharmacologic Sensitivity Window:**\nThe steepness of the curve is best understood by examining the range of concentrations required to transition from a low level of effect to a high level. A common metric is the ratio of concentrations needed for $90\\%$ and $10\\%$ of the maximal effect, i.e., the ratio $EC_{90}/EC_{10}$. Using the general formula derived above:\n$$EC_{90} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.9}{1-0.9}\\right)^{1/n} = EC_{50} \\cdot 9^{1/n}$$\n$$EC_{10} = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{0.1}{1-0.1}\\right)^{1/n} = EC_{50} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{1/n}$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{EC_{90}}{EC_{10}} = \\frac{EC_{50} \\cdot 9^{1/n}}{EC_{50} \\cdot (1/9)^{1/n}} = \\frac{9^{1/n}}{9^{-1/n}} = 9^{2/n}$$\nThis ratio defines the pharmacologic sensitivity window.\n-   For $n=1$ (the case in the problem), the ratio is $9^{2/1} = 81$. An $81$-fold increase in concentration is required to move from $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ effect. This represents a relatively broad sensitivity window.\n-   For $n=2$ (positive cooperativity), the ratio is $9^{2/2} = 9$. Only a $9$-fold concentration change is needed. The curve is steeper, and the sensitivity window is narrower.\n-   For $n=4$ (strong cooperativity), the ratio is $9^{2/4} = 9^{1/2} = 3$. An extremely steep transition occurs over a very narrow concentration range.\nAs $n$ increases, the ratio $EC_{90}/EC_{10}$ decreases, signifying a steeper concentration-effect curve and a narrower pharmacologic sensitivity window.\n\n**Implications for Dosing Precision and Therapeutic Index (TI):**\n1.  **Dosing Precision:** A steep concentration-effect curve (high $n$) means that small fluctuations in drug concentration—due to dosing errors, food effects, drug-drug interactions, or inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability—can cause large and potentially dangerous shifts in pharmacologic effect. This demands greater dosing precision to keep the drug concentration within its desired therapeutic range. A shallow curve (low $n$) is more \"forgiving\" of such variations.\n\n2.  **Therapeutic Index (TI):** The TI classically compares the concentration causing toxicity to that causing efficacy (e.g., $TC_{50}/EC_{50}$). While a high TI is desirable, the Hill coefficients for the efficacy ($n_{eff}$) and toxicity ($n_{tox}$) curves are critically important. A drug with an acceptable TI might still be hazardous if its toxicity curve is extremely steep (high $n_{tox}$). In such a case, the concentration range between the top of the therapeutic effect (e.g., $EC_{90}$) and the onset of unacceptable toxicity (e.g., $TC_{10}$) could be dangerously narrow. A small overdose could rapidly escalate the effect from therapeutic to toxic. Therefore, a steep dose-response relationship can shrink the practical therapeutic window, increasing the risk of adverse events and making the drug less safe, regardless of a favorable-appearing TI based on midpoint values.",

It utilizes standard models ($EC_{50}$, Hill-Langmuir equation) and parameters ($C_{\\max}$, $f_u$, $K_{p,uu}$) that are routinely used in drug development. All concepts are scientifically established.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of data and clear definitions required to compute the specified quantities. There is a clear path to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and realistic. The terms are defined, and the question is unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the off-target fractional occupancy at the effect site when the total plasma concentration is at its maximum, $C_{\\max}$. This requires a multi-step calculation beginning with the determination of the relevant drug concentration at the site of action.\n\nFirst, we must determine the unbound drug concentration in plasma at the peak total concentration, $C_{u,\\max}$. This is calculated by multiplying the total maximum concentration, $C_{\\max}$, by the unbound fraction in plasma, $f_u$.\n$$C_{u,\\max} = f_u \\times C_{\\max}$$\nThe given values are $C_{\\max} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $f_u = 0.05$. To maintain consistent units with the $EC_{50}$ values provided in $\\mathrm{nM}$, we convert $C_{\\max}$ from $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $\\mathrm{nM}$ using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$C_{\\max} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 2.0 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNow, we calculate $C_{u,\\max}$:\n$$C_{u,\\max} = 0.05 \\times 2000\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the unbound drug concentration at the effect site, $C_{u,e}$, corresponding to this peak plasma concentration. This is determined by the unbound effect-site to plasma ratio, $K_{p,uu}$, which represents the equilibrium partitioning of the unbound drug between the effect site and plasma.\n$$C_{u,e} = K_{p,uu} \\times C_{u,\\max}$$\nUsing the given value $K_{p,uu} = 0.20$ and the calculated $C_{u,\\max}$:\n$$C_{u,e} = 0.20 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThis is the concentration responsible for the pharmacological effect at the target and off-target sites.\n\nThird, we use the Hill-Langmuir equation to model the fractional occupancy, $O$. The problem states that the pharmacological effect is equivalent to receptor occupancy. The general form of the Hill equation for fractional effect (or occupancy, with $E_{\\max} = 1$) is:\n$$O(C) = \\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nwhere $C$ is the drug concentration, $EC_{50}$ is the half-maximal effective concentration, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. The problem specifies that $n=1$ for both target and off-target. This simplifies the equation to the standard Langmuir isotherm (or Michaelis-Menten form):\n$$O(C) = \\frac{C}{EC_{50} + C}$$\n\nNow we can compute the fractional occupancy for the off-target, $O_{\\mathrm{off}}$, using the calculated unbound effect-site concentration $C_{u,e} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the given off-target half-maximal effective concentration $EC_{50}^{\\mathrm{off}} = 250\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$O_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{C_{u,e}}{EC_{50}^{\\mathrm{off}} + C_{u,e}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$O_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{250\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{20}{270} = \\frac{2}{27}$$\nAs a decimal fraction, this is approximately $0.074074074...$.\n\nThe problem also mentions other quantities for context. The selectivity index $S$ is:\n$$S = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\mathrm{off}}}{EC_{50}^{\\mathrm{target}}} = \\frac{250\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 50$$\nThis indicates a 50-fold selectivity for the intended target over the off-target.\n\nThe fractional occupancy for the target, $O_{\\mathrm{target}}$, at $C_{u,e} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is:\n$$O_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{C_{u,e}}{EC_{50}^{\\mathrm{target}} + C_{u,e}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{20}{25} = 0.80$$\nThis shows $80\\%$ engagement of the intended target at the peak concentration.\n\nThe assessment of off-target engagement is based on comparing $O_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to the threshold $\\theta_{\\mathrm{off}} = 0.10$. Since $O_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.07407$, which is less than $0.10$, the off-target engagement does not exceed the threshold for clinically meaningful effects at the peak concentration.\n\nThe final question asks for the off-target fractional occupancy at the effect site corresponding to $C_{\\max}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$O_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{2}{27} \\approx 0.074074074...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.07407$.",
