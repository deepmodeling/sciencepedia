It describes a standard sample size calculation for a bioequivalence study, a common task in pharmaceutical development. All necessary parameters are provided, the constraints are consistent, and the terminology is precise and standard. The problem is well-posed and objective. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution proceeds.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the minimum sample size $N$ for a $2 \\times 2$ crossover bioequivalence study. The analysis is performed on log-transformed pharmacokinetic data.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters on the logarithmic scale. The regulatory equivalence interval on the original scale is $[0.8, 1.25]$. On the log scale, this corresponds to $[\\ln(0.8), \\ln(1.25)]$. Since $\\ln(0.8) = \\ln(4/5) = -\\ln(5/4) = -\\ln(1.25)$, the symmetric equivalence interval on the log scale is $[-\\theta_E, \\theta_E]$, where the equivalence limit $\\theta_E = \\ln(1.25)$.\n\nThe anticipated true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of Test to Reference formulation is $0.95$. On the log scale, this corresponds to the true difference in means, $\\Delta = \\mu_T - \\mu_R = \\ln(0.95)$.\n\nThe within-subject coefficient of variation on the original scale, $CV_W$, is given as $0.20$. For log-normally distributed data, the within-subject variance on the log scale, $\\sigma_W^2$, is derived from $CV_W$ using the relationship:\n$$ \\sigma_W^2 = \\ln(CV_W^2 + 1) $$\n\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ crossover study with a total of $N$ subjects allocated equally to two sequences ($N/2$ per sequence), the variance of the estimator for the difference in means, $\\hat{\\Delta}$, is given by:\n$$ Var(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2}{N} $$\nThe standard error of the estimator is therefore:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma_W^2}{N}} $$\n\nThe TOST procedure is used to establish bioequivalence. This involves testing two one-sided null hypotheses at the $\\alpha$ significance level:\n$H_{01}: \\Delta \\ge \\theta_E$\n$H_{02}: \\Delta \\le -\\theta_E$\n\nBioequivalence is concluded if both null hypotheses are rejected. For study planning, we require that the statistical power to reject both nulls is at least $1-\\beta = 0.90$. A standard, conservative approach to sample size calculation is to ensure that the power to reject each one-sided null hypothesis is at least $1-\\beta$. This requires calculating the necessary sample size for each test and taking the maximum of the two.\n\nUsing a large-sample normal approximation, the condition to achieve a power of at least $1-\\beta$ for the test of $H_{01}$ (the upper bound test) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta_E - \\Delta}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nThis leads to a required sample size $N_U$:\n$$ N_U \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E - \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nSimilarly, the condition for the test of $H_{02}$ (the lower bound test) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta - (-\\theta_E)}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} \\implies \\frac{\\Delta + \\theta_E}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nThis leads to a required sample size $N_L$:\n$$ N_L \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nThe overall sample size $N$ must satisfy both conditions, so $N = \\max(N_U, N_L)$. We must determine which of $N_U$ or $N_L$ is larger. This depends on which denominator, $(\\theta_E - \\Delta)^2$ or $(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2$, is smaller. This corresponds to the test against the boundary to which the true mean difference $\\Delta$ is closer.\n\nGiven $\\Delta = \\ln(0.95)  0$:\nThe distance to the upper bound is $\\theta_E - \\Delta = \\ln(1.25) - \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25/0.95) \\approx \\ln(1.316)$.\nThe distance to the lower bound is $\\Delta - (-\\theta_E) = \\theta_E + \\Delta = \\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25 \\times 0.95) = \\ln(1.1875)$.\nSince $\\ln(1.1875)  \\ln(1.316)$, the true mean $\\Delta$ is closer to the lower bound $-\\theta_E$. The lower bound test is therefore the more challenging one and requires a larger sample size. Thus, we must use the formula for $N_L$.\n\nThe governing planning inequality is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta_E + \\Delta}{SE(\\hat{\\Delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $SE(\\hat{\\Delta})$ and solving for $N$ gives the closed-form expression for the total sample size:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma_W^2 (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\theta_E + \\Delta)^2} $$\n\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically with the given inputs:\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $z_{1-\\alpha} = z_{0.95} \\approx 1.64485$.\n- Power $= 0.90$, so $\\beta = 0.10$ and $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.90} \\approx 1.28155$.\n- $CV_W = 0.20$, so $\\sigma_W^2 = \\ln(0.20^2 + 1) = \\ln(1.04)$.\n- $\\theta_E = \\ln(1.25)$.\n- $\\Delta = \\ln(0.95)$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $N$:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\ln(1.04) (z_{0.95} + z_{0.90})^2}{(\\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95))^2} $$\nThe denominator can be simplified using logarithm properties: $\\ln(1.25) + \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25 \\times 0.95) = \\ln(1.1875)$.\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\ln(1.04) (z_{0.95} + z_{0.90})^2}{(\\ln(1.1875))^2} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\times \\ln(1.04) \\times (1.64485 + 1.28155)^2}{(\\ln(1.1875))^2} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{2 \\times 0.0392207 \\times (2.92640)^2}{(0.171850)^2} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{0.0784414 \\times 8.56387}{0.0295325} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{0.671911}{0.0295325} $$\n$$ N \\ge 22.751 $$\n\nThe total sample size $N$ must be an even integer. The smallest even integer greater than or equal to $22.751$ is $24$.",

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to construct a $90\\%$ confidence interval for the mean of a normally distributed population with unknown variance. Let $\\{x_i\\}$ be a sample of size $n$ from a $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ distribution. The sample mean is $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ and the sample variance is $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\n\nThe $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for the population mean $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$ \\bar{x} \\pm t_{1-\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nwhere $\\nu = n-1$ are the degrees of freedom and $t_{1-\\alpha/2, \\nu}$ is the critical value from the Student's $t$-distribution.\n\nFor this problem, the confidence level is $90\\%$, so $1-\\alpha = 0.90$, which implies $\\alpha = 0.10$. The number of subjects is $n=10$, so the degrees of freedom are $\\nu = 10-1 = 9$. The required two-tailed critical value is $t_{1-0.10/2, 9} = t_{0.95, 9}$.

It presents a standard scenario for dose adjustment in patients with organ impairment. The assumptions provided are common and reasonable for this type of calculation (e.g., linear pharmacokinetics, unchanged nonrenal clearance). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data are internally consistent (e.g., $f_r + f_{nr} = 0.60 + 0.40 = 1.00$). The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find a new maintenance dose, $D_{new}$, for patients with renal impairment that results in the same steady-state exposure as the baseline dose, $D_0$, in subjects with typical renal function. Steady-state exposure is quantified by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over one dosing interval at steady state, $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$.\n\nFor an orally administered drug with linear pharmacokinetics, $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$ is given by the equation:\n$$\nAUC_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{\\text{tot}}}\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the oral bioavailability, $D$ is the dose, and $CL_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total body clearance.\n\nThe principle of exposure matching requires that the steady-state exposure in the impaired population ($AUC_{\\tau,ss,new}$) equals the exposure in the typical population ($AUC_{\\tau,ss,0}$):\n$$\nAUC_{\\tau,ss,new} = AUC_{\\tau,ss,0}\n$$\nSubstituting the formula for $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{new} \\cdot D_{new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},new}} = \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}}\n$$\nThe problem states that oral bioavailability $F$ is unchanged, so $F_{new} = F_0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},new}} = \\frac{D_0}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}}\n$$\nSolving for the new dose, $D_{new}$:\n$$\nD_{new} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}}\n$$\nOur task is to determine the ratio of the total clearance in the impaired state to the total clearance in the baseline state. Total body clearance is the sum of renal ($CL_r$) and nonrenal ($CL_{nr}$) clearance:\n$$\nCL_{\\text{tot}} = CL_r + CL_{nr}\n$$\nAt baseline, the components are related to the total clearance as follows:\n$CL_{r,0} = 0.60 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}$\n$CL_{nr,0} = 0.40 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}$\n\nNow, we determine the clearance components in the renally impaired state.\nFrom assumption (iii), nonrenal clearance is unchanged:\n$$\nCL_{nr,new} = CL_{nr,0} = 0.40 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}\n$$\nFrom assumption (ii), renal clearance is proportional to creatinine clearance ($CL_{cr}$). Let $k$ be the proportionality constant:\n$$\nCL_r = k \\cdot CL_{cr}\n$$\nWe can find $k$ using the baseline values:\n$$\nk = \\frac{CL_{r,0}}{CL_{cr,0}}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the new renal clearance, $CL_{r,new}$:\n$$\nCL_{r,new} = k \\cdot CL_{cr,new} = \\left(\\frac{CL_{r,0}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right) \\cdot CL_{cr,new} = CL_{r,0} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_{cr,new}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $CL_{r,0} = 0.60 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}$:\n$$\nCL_{r,new} = (0.60 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_{cr,new}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right)\n$$\nThe new total clearance, $CL_{\\text{tot},new}$, is the sum of the new renal and nonrenal components:\n$$\nCL_{\\text{tot},new} = CL_{r,new} + CL_{nr,new}\n$$\n$$\nCL_{\\text{tot},new} = \\left( (0.60 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_{cr,new}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right) \\right) + (0.40 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot},0})\n$$\nWe can factor out $CL_{\\text{tot},0}$:\n$$\nCL_{\\text{tot},new} = CL_{\\text{tot},0} \\left[ 0.60 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_{cr,new}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right) + 0.40 \\right]\n$$\nNow we can compute the clearance ratio $\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}} = 0.60 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_{cr,new}}{CL_{cr,0}}\\right) + 0.40\n$$\nSubstitute the given values for creatinine clearance: $CL_{cr,0} = 100 \\ \\text{mL/min}$ and $CL_{cr,new} = 30 \\ \\text{mL/min}$.\n$$\n\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}} = 0.60 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{30}{100}\\right) + 0.40\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}} = 0.60 \\cdot (0.30) + 0.40\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}} = 0.18 + 0.40 = 0.58\n$$\nFinally, we can calculate the new dose, $D_{new}$, using the baseline dose $D_0 = 300 \\ \\text{mg}$:\n$$\nD_{new} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{tot},new}}{CL_{\\text{tot},0}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{new} = 300 \\ \\text{mg} \\cdot 0.58\n$$\n$$\nD_{new} = 174 \\ \\text{mg}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to three significant figures. The calculated value $174$ already has three significant figures.\nThe new maintenance dose that matches the steady-state exposure is $174 \\ \\text{mg}$.",
