            "problem": "A translational medicine team is deciding between running three separate indication-specific trials versus a single platform master protocol. In a separate-trials design, each arm operates as its own independent trial with redundant screening and setup. In a master protocol, common infrastructure reduces screening inefficiency by centralizing biomarker testing and eligibility workflow. Consider the following cost model grounded in first principles of trial operations:\n\n- Each enrolled patient requires one pre-enrollment screening workflow with per-patient screening cost $C_s$ and then per-patient operational cost $C_p$ for treatment, follow-up, and data capture.\n- Total cost is the sum over arms of the per-patient total cost multiplied by the expected sample size for that arm.\n- Under separate trials, there is no cross-arm efficiency, so the per-patient total cost is $C_s + C_p$ in every arm.\n- Under a master protocol, centralized screening yields a relative screening cost reduction of $20\\%$, so the per-patient screening cost becomes $(1 - 0.20)\\,C_s$, while $C_p$ is unchanged.\n\nAssume three arms with expected sample sizes $(80, 100, 120)$, per-patient screening cost $C_s=\\$2{,}000$, and per-patient operational cost $C_p=\\$20{,}000$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total cost for two clinical trial strategies: a set of three independent, separate trials, and a single master protocol trial encompassing three arms. The calculation is based on a provided cost model.\n\nLet the number of arms be $k=3$. The expected sample sizes for the three arms are given as $n_1 = 80$, $n_2 = 100$, and $n_3 = 120$. The total number of patients to be enrolled across all arms is the sum of the individual sample sizes:\n$$ n_{total} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 80 + 100 + 120 = 300 $$\n\nThe cost components are defined as:\n- Per-patient screening cost, $C_s = 2000$ USD.\n- Per-patient operational cost, $C_p = 20000$ USD.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost for the separate-trials strategy, denoted as $T_{sep}$. In this model, there are no shared efficiencies. The per-patient total cost for any given arm is the sum of the screening cost and the operational cost.\n$$ C_{patient, sep} = C_s + C_p $$\nThe total cost is the sum of the costs for each arm, which can be expressed as the total number of patients multiplied by the per-patient cost:\n$$ T_{sep} = (n_1 + n_2 + n_3) \\times (C_s + C_p) = n_{total} \\times (C_s + C_p) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ C_s + C_p = 2000 + 20000 = 22000 $$\n$$ T_{sep} = 300 \\times 22000 = 6600000 $$\nSo, the total cost for the separate-trials strategy is $6,600,000$ USD.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the master protocol strategy, denoted as $T_{mp}$. This strategy introduces a centralized screening process that results in a relative screening cost reduction of $20 \\%$. Let this reduction factor be $r=0.20$. The new, reduced screening cost per patient, $C_s'$, is:\n$$ C_s' = (1 - r) \\times C_s = (1 - 0.20) \\times C_s = 0.80 \\times C_s $$\nSubstituting the value of $C_s$:\n$$ C_s' = 0.80 \\times 2000 = 1600 $$\nThe per-patient operational cost, $C_p$, remains unchanged. Therefore, the per-patient total cost under the master protocol is:\n$$ C_{patient, mp} = C_s' + C_p = 1600 + 20000 = 21600 $$\nThe total cost for the master protocol is the total number of patients multiplied by this new per-patient cost:\n$$ T_{mp} = n_{total} \\times (C_s' + C_p) = n_{total} \\times ((1-r)C_s + C_p) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ T_{mp} = 300 \\times 21600 = 6480000 $$\nSo, the total cost for the master protocol strategy is $6,480,000$ USD.\n\nThe problem asks for the two total costs, ordered as $(\\text{separate trials total}, \\text{master protocol total})$.

            "problem": "A health system is planning to evaluate three candidate therapies under a master protocol in translational oncology. Each therapy targets a distinct, mutually exclusive biomarker-defined subtype of the same disease, and each subtype has the same prevalence. The system has a centralized prescreening capability that can test for all three biomarkers simultaneously, and an alternative plan with three independent trials in which each trial runs its own separate screening pipeline limited by the same overall resource constraints.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded scenario:\n- The flow of patients entering prescreening is well approximated by a homogeneous Poisson process with annual rate $A$ patients per year.\n- Each screened patient is independently positive for the biomarker criterion relevant to any single therapy with probability $p$, and the therapy-specific biomarkers are mutually exclusive across patients. Thus, for any fixed therapy, the positivity probability is $p$.\n- Under the master protocol with shared screening, all three biomarkers are assessed for each screened patient in one pass, and any patient found positive for a given biomarker is allocated to the corresponding therapy arm immediately.\n- Under the three independent trials with separate pipelines, the total prescreening capacity is split equally across the three trials, so each trial screens at rate $A/3$ and assesses only its own biomarker.\n\nSuppose each therapy requires $n$ eligible patients to reach the interim analysis of a signal-seeking stage, and all three arms run concurrently until each accrues $n$ eligible patients. Starting from the core definition of a homogeneous Poisson process and the law of rare events for independent Bernoulli thinning, derive the expression for the expected calendar time to reach $n$ eligible patients per arm under each strategy, and then compute the expected calendar time reduction (in years) achieved by the master protocol relative to the independent trials.\n\nUse the parameters $A=600$ patients per year, $p=0.2$, and $n=150$ eligible patients per therapy.

The use of a homogeneous Poisson process to model patient arrivals and Bernoulli thinning to model patient eligibility is a standard and scientifically sound approach in biostatistics and operations research for healthcare. Master protocols are a contemporary and important topic in translational medicine.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($A, p, n$) and clearly defines two distinct scenarios for comparison. The objective is to calculate a specific, meaningful quantity (expected time reduction).\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in clear, objective, and quantitative language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n-   **Flaw Check**:\n    1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: None. The model is consistent. The probabilities are sound; with $3$ mutually exclusive biomarkers each with prevalence $p=0.2$, the total probability of a patient being positive for one of the biomarkers is $3p = 0.6$, which is less than $1$.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: None. The problem is directly formalizable using probability theory and is highly relevant to the specified topic.\n    3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory**: None.

The parameters are plausible for a large-scale clinical trial setting.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: The phrase \"expected calendar time to reach $n$ eligible patients per arm\" can be interpreted in two ways: (i) the expected time for any single, representative arm to complete accrual, $E[T_i]$, or (ii) the expected time for the last of all arms to complete accrual, $E[\\max(T_1, T_2, ...)]$. The former is a common measure of a trial's intrinsic efficiency, while the latter measures the expected duration of the entire multi-arm study. Given the request to derive the expression from first principles without specifying advanced methods for order statistics, the most direct and standard interpretation is the expected time for a single arm, which directly reflects the accrual rate. This interpretation will be adopted.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: None. The problem requires a correct application of stochastic process theory to a practical scenario, demonstrating a key quantitative advantage of a specific trial design.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: None. The solution is a mathematical derivation that is fully verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution based on the interpretation that the quantity of interest is the expected accrual time for a single, representative arm under each strategy.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows. First, the fundamental principle of Poisson process thinning is established. Second, this principle is applied to derive the expected accrual time for a single arm under the master protocol strategy. Third, the same is done for the independent trials strategy. Finally, the difference in these expected times is calculated, and numerical values are substituted to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the properties of a homogeneous Poisson process. The stream of patients arriving for screening is modeled as a Poisson process with a constant rate $A$.\n\nA key theorem of stochastic processes states that if a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ is \"thinned\" by subjecting each event to an independent Bernoulli trial with probability of success $p$, the resulting process of \"successes\" is also a homogeneous Poisson process with a new, lower rate of $\\lambda' = \\lambda p$. This is known as Poisson thinning or splitting.\n\n**Strategy 1: Master Protocol**\n\nUnder the master protocol, all incoming patients are screened from a single pool at a rate of $A$ patients per year. Each patient is assessed for all three mutually exclusive biomarkers. For any single therapy arm, a randomly selected patient is eligible if they are positive for that arm's specific biomarker. This occurs with probability $p$.\n\nWe can therefore model the arrival of eligible patients for any specific arm (e.g., arm $i$) as a thinned Poisson process.\nThe original rate is $\\lambda_{total} = A$.\nThe probability of being eligible for arm $i$ is $p$.\nThe rate of arrival of eligible patients for arm $i$ is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_{MP} = A \\cdot p $$\nThe time to accrue $n$ patients for this arm, let us call it $T_{MP}$, is the waiting time for the $n$-th event in a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{MP}$. This waiting time follows an Erlang distribution, which is a special case of the Gamma distribution. The expected value of this waiting time is given by the number of events $n$ divided by the rate $\\lambda_{MP}$.\nThus, the expected calendar time to accrue $n$ patients for a single arm under the master protocol is:\n$$ E[T_{MP}] = \\frac{n}{\\lambda_{MP}} = \\frac{n}{Ap} $$\n\n**Strategy 2: Independent Trials**\n\nUnder the independent trials strategy, the total screening capacity $A$ is divided equally among the three trials. Each trial thus operates its own screening pipeline with an input flow of patients at a rate of $A/3$. Each pipeline screens only for its one specific biomarker.\n\nFor a single one of these independent trials, the arrival process of eligible patients is again a thinned Poisson process.\nThe original rate for this single trial is $\\lambda_{trial} = \\frac{A}{3}$.\nThe probability of a patient being eligible is $p$.\nThe rate of arrival of eligible patients for this single trial is:\n$$ \\lambda_{Ind} = \\lambda_{trial} \\cdot p = \\frac{A}{3} \\cdot p = \\frac{Ap}{3} $$\nThe expected calendar time to accrue $n$ patients for this arm, $E[T_{Ind}]$, is similarly given by $n$ divided by the rate $\\lambda_{Ind}$:\n$$ E[T_{Ind}] = \\frac{n}{\\lambda_{Ind}} = \\frac{n}{Ap/3} = \\frac{3n}{Ap} $$\n\n**Expected Calendar Time Reduction**\n\nThe expected calendar time reduction, $\\Delta T$, achieved by the master protocol relative to the independent trials is the difference between their expected accrual times.\n$$ \\Delta T = E[T_{Ind}] - E[T_{MP}] $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{3n}{Ap} - \\frac{n}{Ap} = \\frac{2n}{Ap} $$\nThis expression represents the expected time savings in years. The master protocol is three times as efficient in patient accrual per arm ($ \\lambda_{MP} = 3 \\lambda_{Ind} $), so the expected time for each arm is one-third as long. The reduction in time is therefore two-thirds of the time required for the independent trial strategy.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Annual screening rate, $A = 600$ patients/year.\n- Biomarker positivity probability, $p = 0.2$.\n- Required patients per arm, $n = 150$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta T$:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{2 \\times 150}{600 \\times 0.2} $$\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$ 600 \\times 0.2 = 120 $$\nNow, calculate the fraction:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{2 \\times 150}{120} = \\frac{300}{120} = \\frac{30}{12} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{5 \\times 6}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 $$\nThe expected calendar time reduction is $2.5$ years. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the final numerical answer is $2.500$.",
