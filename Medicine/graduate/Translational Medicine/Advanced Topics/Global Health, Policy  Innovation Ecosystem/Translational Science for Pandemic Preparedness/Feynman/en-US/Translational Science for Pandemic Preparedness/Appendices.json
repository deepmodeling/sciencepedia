            "problem": "A public health laboratory is designing a two-stage pooled testing protocol (Dorfman pooling) to expand Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) capacity for respiratory virus surveillance during an early pandemic phase. Assume there is a large screening cohort of size $N$ in which each individual has independent infection probability $p$, and that analytic validation has confirmed that, for the group sizes considered, pooling does not degrade sensitivity or specificity relative to individual tests. In the first stage, the laboratory tests pooled specimens formed by partitioning the $N$ individuals into groups of equal size $g \\in \\mathbb{N}$; one pooled test is run per group.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and its application to public health logistics (specifically, Dorfman pooled testing). The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the closed-form expression for the expected number of tests per individual, $E[T](g,p)$.\nThe screening protocol involves two stages. We consider a cohort of $N$ individuals, partitioned into $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups of size $g$. The infection status of each individual is an independent Bernoulli trial, with probability of being infected equal to $p$.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is not infected is $1-p$.\nA group of size $g$ tests negative in the first stage if and only if all $g$ individuals in that group are not infected. Due to the independence assumption, the probability of a group testing negative is $(1-p)^g$.\n\nA group tests positive in the first stage if at least one individual is infected. The probability of this event, which we denote as $P_{pos}$, is the complement of the group testing negative:\n$$P_{pos} = 1 - (1-p)^g$$\n\nThe total number of tests, $T_{total}$, is the sum of tests from Stage 1 and Stage 2.\nIn Stage 1, one test is run for each of the $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups. So, the number of Stage 1 tests is deterministically $\\frac{N}{g}$.\nIn Stage 2, individual tests are performed for all $g$ members of each group that tested positive in Stage 1. Let $K$ be the random variable for the number of positive groups. The number of Stage 2 tests is $gK$.\n\nThe total number of tests is $T_{total} = \\frac{N}{g} + gK$.\nWe need the expected total number of tests, $E[T_{total}]$. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[T_{total}] = E\\left[\\frac{N}{g} + gK\\right] = \\frac{N}{g} + gE[K]$$\nThe number of positive groups, $K$, follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}\\left(n=\\frac{N}{g}, q=P_{pos}\\right)$, since each of the $\\frac{N}{g}$ groups represents an independent trial. The expected value of a binomial distribution is $nq$. Thus, the expected number of positive groups is:\n$$E[K] = \\frac{N}{g} \\times P_{pos} = \\frac{N}{g}\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E[T_{total}]$:\n$$E[T_{total}] = \\frac{N}{g} + g\\left[\\frac{N}{g}\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)\\right] = \\frac{N}{g} + N\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of tests per individual, $E[T](g,p)$, which is $E[T_{total}]$ divided by the total number of individuals, $N$:\n$$E[T](g,p) = \\frac{E[T_{total}]}{N} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\frac{N}{g} + N\\left(1 - (1-p)^g\\right)\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the required closed form:\n$$E[T](g,p) = \\frac{1}{g} + 1 - (1-p)^g$$\n\nSecond, we determine the optimal integer group size $g$ that minimizes $E[T](g,p)$ for $p=0.01$.\nThe function to minimize is:\n$$f(g) = E[T](g, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{g} + 1 - (0.99)^g$$\nwhere $g$ is an integer $g \\ge 2$. To find the approximate location of the minimum, we can treat $g$ as a continuous variable and find where the derivative is zero.\n$$f'(g) = -\\frac{1}{g^2} - (0.99)^g \\ln(0.99) = 0$$\nThis leads to the equation $g^2 (0.99)^g = -1/\\ln(0.99)$. A common approximation for small $p$ is $g_{opt} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}$. For $p=0.01$, this gives $g_{opt} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.01}} = \\frac{1}{0.1} = 10$. This suggests the true integer minimum is close to 10. We test integer values of $g$ in this vicinity.\nFor $g=10$:\n$$E[T](10, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{10} + 1 - (0.99)^{10} \\approx 0.1 + 1 - 0.904382075 \\approx 0.195617925$$\nFor $g=11$:\n$$E[T](11, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{11} + 1 - (0.99)^{11} \\approx 0.090909091 + 1 - 0.895338254 \\approx 0.195570837$$\nFor $g=12$:\n$$E[T](12, 0.01) = \\frac{1}{12} + 1 - (0.99)^{12} \\approx 0.083333333 + 1 - 0.886384871 \\approx 0.196948462$$\nComparing these values, $E[T](g, 0.01)$ is smallest for $g=11$. Thus, the optimal integer group size is $g_{opt} = 11$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the efficiency gain. This is the ratio of the expected number of tests for individual testing to that of the optimal pooled strategy.\nThe expected number of tests per individual for individual testing is 1.\nThe expected number of tests per individual for the optimal pooled strategy is $E[T](11, 0.01) \\approx 0.195570837$.\nThe efficiency gain, $\\eta$, is:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{1}{E[T](11, 0.01)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{11} + 1 - (0.99)^{11}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.195570837} \\approx 5.113238$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the efficiency gain is 5.113.\n\nThe two results requested are the optimal group size, 11, and the efficiency gain, 5.113.",

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe core principle for preventing epidemic growth is to ensure that the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is less than or equal to $1$. $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ represents the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population with some pre-existing immunity. It is defined as the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the fraction of the population that is susceptible to the infection, $s$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0 \\cdot s$$\nThe critical threshold for preventing an epidemic is $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le 1$. The minimal vaccination coverage, $p^{\\ast}$, will be the coverage that achieves $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$.\n\nWe must derive an expression for the effective susceptible fraction of the population, $s$, under the leaky vaccine model. Let $p$ be the fraction of the population that has been vaccinated. Consequently, the fraction $(1-p)$ remains unvaccinated.\n\nThe unvaccinated individuals are fully susceptible to the pathogen. Their relative susceptibility is $1$.\n\nThe vaccinated individuals are partially protected. The problem states the vaccine has an efficacy, $\\mathrm{VE}$, which reduces susceptibility by a constant fraction. Therefore, the remaining susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is $(1 - \\mathrm{VE})$.\n\nThe total effective susceptible fraction of the population, $s$, is the weighted sum of the susceptibilities of the unvaccinated and vaccinated subgroups:\n$$s = (1-p) \\cdot 1 + p \\cdot (1 - \\mathrm{VE})$$\nExpanding and simplifying this expression:\n$$s = 1 - p + p - p \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}$$\n$$s = 1 - p \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $s$ into the herd immunity threshold condition, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$, letting $p = p^{\\ast}$ to denote the critical vaccination coverage.\n$$R_0 \\cdot s = 1$$\n$$R_0 (1 - p^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}) = 1$$\nWe now solve this equation for $p^{\\ast}$ to derive the general formula from first principles, as requested.\n$$1 - p^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{VE} = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{VE} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{\\mathrm{VE}}$$\nThis formula gives the minimal vaccination coverage required to achieve herd immunity with a leaky vaccine.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $R_0 = 3$ and $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.8$.\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}{0.8}$$\nFirst, evaluate the numerator:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nNext, express the denominator as a fraction:\n$$\\mathrm{VE} = 0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nNow, substitute these fractions back into the equation for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{4}{5}}$$\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{10}{12}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final answer:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.8333...$.
