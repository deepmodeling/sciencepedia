A naive application of a single prevalence rate to a whole country can be highly misleading, as populations are rarely homogenous. This exercise  will guide you through a more sophisticated approach, integrating principles of population genetics—including allele frequencies and inbreeding coefficients—to calculate disease burden across different demographic strata.

            "problem": "Consider a monogenic rare disease, RD-X, that follows autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Assume the population is partitioned into three demographic strata indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, each characterized by an AR risk allele frequency $q_i$, an inbreeding coefficient $F_i$, and a population weight $w_i$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1$. Under the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) with inbreeding, the probability of being AR homozygous ($aa$) in stratum $i$ is $q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)$. Let clinical penetrance be $\\pi \\in (0,1)$, so the probability that an individual in stratum $i$ is clinically affected is $\\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$. The total population size is $N$, and the stratum sizes are $N_i = w_i N$.\n\nYou are given the following scientifically plausible parameters for a country with genetic diversity and varying consanguinity practices:\n- Total population size $N = 68{,}000{,}000$.\n- Penetrance $\\pi = 0.8$.\n- Stratum $1$: $w_1 = 0.60$, $q_1 = 0.004$, $F_1 = 0$.\n- Stratum $2$: $w_2 = 0.35$, $q_2 = 0.002$, $F_2 = 0.01$.\n- Stratum $3$: $w_3 = 0.05$, $q_3 = 0.03$, $F_3 = 0.02$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the linearity of expectation and the probabilistic definition of prevalence as disease risk, derive the expected number of individuals with RD-X in the country by aggregating across strata.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles of population genetics. The problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expected total number of individuals with the rare disease RD-X in a demographically stratified population. We begin from the first principles as requested.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of clinically affected individuals in the country. The country's population is partitioned into $3$ disjoint strata, so we can define $X_i$ as the number of affected individuals in stratum $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The total number of affected individuals is the sum of those in each stratum:\n$$X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of affected individuals is the sum of the expectations for each stratum:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E[X_i]$$\nNow, we must find the expected number of affected individuals, $E[X_i]$, within each stratum $i$. The population of stratum $i$ is $N_i = w_i N$, where $N$ is the total population size and $w_i$ is the population weight of the stratum. For any individual chosen randomly from stratum $i$, the probability of being clinically affected is defined as the disease prevalence in that stratum, let's call it $P_{\\text{aff},i}$. According to the problem statement, this probability is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{aff},i} = \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\pi$ is the clinical penetrance, $q_i$ is the risk allele frequency, and $F_i$ is the inbreeding coefficient for stratum $i$.\n\nThe number of affected individuals in stratum $i$, $X_i$, can be modeled as a sum of indicator random variables. Let $A_{ij} = 1$ if the $j$-th individual in stratum $i$ is affected, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise, for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_i\\}$. Then $X_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} A_{ij}$. The expectation of each indicator variable is $E[A_{ij}] = P(A_{ij}=1) = P_{\\text{aff},i}$. Using the linearity of expectation for $X_i$:\n$$E[X_i] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} A_{ij}\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} E[A_{ij}] = N_i \\cdot P_{\\text{aff},i}$$\nSubstituting $N_i = w_i N$ and the expression for $P_{\\text{aff},i}$:\n$$E[X_i] = (w_i N) \\cdot \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nFinally, the total expected number of affected individuals in the country is the sum over all strata:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i N \\pi \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nFactoring out the constants $N$ and $\\pi$, we get the final expression for our calculation:\n$$E[X] = N \\pi \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \\left(q_i^{2} + F_i q_i (1 - q_i)\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $N = 68,000,000$\n- $\\pi = 0.8$\n- Stratum $1$: $w_1 = 0.60$, $q_1 = 0.004$, $F_1 = 0$\n- Stratum $2$: $w_2 = 0.35$, $q_2 = 0.002$, $F_2 = 0.01$\n- Stratum $3$: $w_3 = 0.05$, $q_3 = 0.03$, $F_3 = 0.02$\n\nWe calculate the term inside the summation for each stratum:\nFor stratum $1$:\n$$w_1 \\left(q_1^{2} + F_1 q_1 (1 - q_1)\\right) = 0.60 \\left( (0.004)^{2} + 0 \\cdot (0.004)(1-0.004) \\right) = 0.60 \\cdot (0.000016) = 0.0000096$$\nFor stratum $2$:\n$$w_2 \\left(q_2^{2} + F_2 q_2 (1 - q_2)\\right) = 0.35 \\left( (0.002)^{2} + (0.01)(0.002)(1-0.002) \\right)$$\n$$= 0.35 \\left( 0.000004 + 0.00002 \\cdot 0.998 \\right) = 0.35 \\left( 0.000004 + 0.00001996 \\right) = 0.35 \\cdot (0.00002396) \\approx 0.000008386$$\nFor stratum $3$:\n$$w_3 \\left(q_3^{2} + F_3 q_3 (1 - q_3)\\right) = 0.05 \\left( (0.03)^{2} + (0.02)(0.03)(1-0.03) \\right)$$\n$$= 0.05 \\left( 0.0009 + 0.0006 \\cdot 0.97 \\right) = 0.05 \\left( 0.0009 + 0.000582 \\right) = 0.05 \\cdot (0.001482) = 0.0000741$$\nThe sum of these terms is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\dots) = 0.0000096 + 0.000008386 + 0.0000741 = 0.000092086$$\nThis sum represents the overall population prevalence of the AR homozygous genotype, averaged across strata. Now, we calculate the total expected number of affected individuals:\n$$E[X] = N \\pi \\cdot (0.000092086) = 68,000,000 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot 0.000092086$$\n$$E[X] = 54,400,000 \\cdot 0.000092086 = 5009.4784$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $5009$.\n\nRegarding the effect of demographic heterogeneity: The aggregated estimate is derived by summing the expected number of cases from each stratum. This approach is necessary because the prevalence of the disease is a non-linear function of the underlying genetic parameters, specifically the allele frequency $q_i$ and the inbreeding coefficient $F_i$. The total expected number of cases is proportional to the weighted average of stratum-specific prevalences, $\\sum w_i P_{\\text{aff},i}$. A naive approach might be to first average the parameters across strata (e.g., $\\bar{q} = \\sum w_i q_i$, $\\bar{F} = \\sum w_i F_i$) and then compute a single prevalence estimate for the entire population. This would be incorrect and yield a different result because, in general, $\\sum w_i f(q_i, F_i) \\neq f(\\sum w_i q_i, \\sum w_i F_i)$ for a non-linear function $f$.\nThe dominant non-linear term is $q_i^2$. Due to the convexity of the function $x \\mapsto x^2$, Jensen's inequality implies that the weighted average of the squares is greater than or equal to the square of the weighted average: $\\sum w_i q_i^2 \\ge (\\sum w_i q_i)^2$. This means that ignoring the stratification and using an average allele frequency will typically underestimate the number of homozygotes (this is known as the Wahlund effect). In this problem, stratum $3$ has a much higher allele frequency ($q_3=0.03$) and inbreeding coefficient ($F_3=0.02$) than the other strata. Although it represents only $5\\%$ of the population, its contribution to the overall genotype prevalence ($0.0000741$) is substantially larger than that of the other two strata combined ($0.0000096 + 0.000008386 = 0.000017986$). Heterogeneity thus allows small, high-risk subpopulations to contribute disproportionately to the total disease burden, an effect that is only captured by the correct stratum-by-stratum aggregation.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard biostatistical problem based on established principles (binomial sampling, confidence intervals) and is directly relevant to the field of translational medicine. All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three parts: the derivation of the Wilson score confidence interval for a binomial proportion $p$, a justification for its use over the Wald interval in the context of rare events, and its application to a given dataset.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Wilson Score Interval**\n\nLet $k$ be the number of observed cases in a sample of size $n$. The disease status of each newborn is an independent Bernoulli trial with probability of success (disease presence) $p$. Thus, the total number of cases $k$ follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$. The maximum likelihood estimator for $p$ is the sample proportion, $\\hat{p} = k/n$.\n\nThe score test is based on the standardized difference between the observed data and what is expected under a null hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$. The score test statistic uses a standard error calculated under the null hypothesis, which makes its distributional properties more reliable under $H_0$ than the Wald test, which uses an estimated standard error.\n\nFor a large sample size $n$, the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normally distributed. The score test statistic for the null hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ is given by:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\text{SE}_0} = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis, this statistic $Z$ follows approximately a standard normal distribution, $N(0, 1)$.\n\nA $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $p$ is constructed by \"inverting\" this test. We seek the set of all values of $p_0$ for which the null hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ would *not* be rejected at the significance level $\\alpha$. For a two-sided test, this non-rejection region is defined by $|Z| \\leq z_{\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. For a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nLet's denote $p_0$ as $p$ (since we are solving for it) and $z_{\\alpha/2}$ as $z$. The inequality is:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}} \\right| \\leq z\n$$\nSquaring both sides eliminates the absolute value:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\hat{p} - p)^2}{p(1-p)/n} \\leq z^2\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator (which is non-negative) gives:\n$$\nn(\\hat{p} - p)^2 \\leq z^2 p(1-p)\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\nn(\\hat{p}^2 - 2\\hat{p}p + p^2) \\leq z^2 p - z^2 p^2\n$$\nWe rearrange this inequality to form a quadratic in the variable $p$:\n$$\nn\\hat{p}^2 - 2n\\hat{p}p + np^2 - z^2 p + z^2 p^2 \\leq 0\n$$\n$$\n(n + z^2)p^2 - (2n\\hat{p} + z^2)p + n\\hat{p}^2 \\leq 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality of the form $Ap^2 + Bp + C \\leq 0$, where:\n$A = n + z^2$\n$B = -(2n\\hat{p} + z^2)$\n$C = n\\hat{p}^2$\n\nSince $A = n + z^2 > 0$, the quadratic function $f(p) = Ap^2 + Bp + C$ represents an upward-opening parabola. The inequality $f(p) \\leq 0$ is satisfied for values of $p$ between the two roots of the equation $Ap^2 + Bp + C = 0$. We find these roots using the quadratic formula, $p = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the discriminant, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$:\n$$\n\\Delta = (-(2n\\hat{p} + z^2))^2 - 4(n + z^2)(n\\hat{p}^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = (4n^2\\hat{p}^2 + 4n\\hat{p}z^2 + z^4) - (4n^2\\hat{p}^2 + 4nz^2\\hat{p}^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 4n\\hat{p}z^2 - 4nz^2\\hat{p}^2 + z^4\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = z^2 (4n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + z^2)\n$$\nThe roots are then:\n$$\np = \\frac{2n\\hat{p} + z^2 \\pm \\sqrt{z^2 (4n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + z^2)}}{2(n + z^2)}\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{2n\\hat{p} + z^2 \\pm z\\sqrt{4n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + z^2}}{2(n + z^2)}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ and noting that $n\\hat{p}=k$:\n$$\np = \\frac{n\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\pm z\\sqrt{n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n + z^2} = \\frac{k + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\pm z\\sqrt{k(1-k/n) + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n + z^2}\n$$\nThis formula defines the lower and upper bounds of the Wilson score confidence interval.\n\n**Part 2: Justification for Wilson vs. Wald Interval**\n\nThe commonly taught Wald interval is given by $\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$. Despite its simplicity, it has severe deficiencies, particularly for proportions near the boundaries of $0$ and $1$, or for small sample sizes, which are characteristic of rare disease studies.\n\nThe Wilson score interval is preferred for the following reasons:\n1.  **Boundary Behavior**: In the case of observing $k=0$ cases, $\\hat{p}=0$. The Wald interval standard error term becomes $0$, resulting in a confidence interval of $[0, 0]$. This is logically unsound, as observing zero events in a finite sample does not prove the event is impossible. The Wilson interval, however, remains well-behaved. For $k=0$ ($\\hat{p}=0$), its formula yields the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{z^2}{n+z^2}\\right]$, a non-degenerate interval that correctly reflects the uncertainty. Similarly, for $k=n$ ($\\hat{p}=1$), the Wald interval is $[1, 1]$ while the Wilson interval is $\\left[\\frac{n}{n+z^2}, 1\\right]$.\n2.  **Coverage Probability**: The actual probability that the Wald interval contains the true parameter $p$ can be drastically lower than the nominal level (e.g., $95\\%$), especially when $p$ is close to $0$ or $1$. Its coverage performance is erratic. The Wilson interval exhibits much more stable and reliable coverage probabilities across the entire range of $p$, staying close to the nominal $1-\\alpha$ level even for small $n$. This superior performance makes it a more trustworthy method for sparse data, which is precisely the situation in newborn screening for ultra-rare diseases.\n\n**Part 3: Application to Data**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Sample size: $n = 2500$\n- Observed cases: $k = 2$\n- Confidence level: $95\\%$, which gives $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.95996... \\approx 1.96$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the constants needed for the Wilson interval formula:\n$z = 1.96$\n$z^2 = (1.96)^2 = 3.8416$\n$\\hat{p} = k/n = 2/2500 = 0.0008$\n$n\\hat{p} = 2$\n$n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) = 2(1-0.0008) = 2(0.9992) = 1.9984$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{n\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\pm z\\sqrt{n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n + z^2}\n$$\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{2 + \\frac{3.8416}{2} \\pm 1.96\\sqrt{1.9984 + \\frac{3.8416}{4}}}{2500 + 3.8416}\n$$\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{2 + 1.9208 \\pm 1.96\\sqrt{1.9984 + 0.9604}}{2503.8416}\n$$\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{3.9208 \\pm 1.96\\sqrt{2.9588}}{2503.8416}\n$$\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{3.9208 \\pm 1.96(1.72011627...)}{2503.8416}\n$$\n$$\n(p_L, p_U) = \\frac{3.9208 \\pm 3.37142789...}{2503.8416}\n$$\n\nCalculating the lower limit ($p_L$):\n$$\np_L = \\frac{3.9208 - 3.37142789}{2503.8416} = \\frac{0.54937211}{2503.8416} \\approx 0.00021941\n$$\n\nCalculating the upper limit ($p_U$):\n$$\np_U = \\frac{3.9208 + 3.37142789}{2503.8416} = \\frac{7.29222789}{2503.8416} \\approx 0.0029124\n$$\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures as requested:\n$p_L \\approx 0.0002194$\n$p_U \\approx 0.002912$\n\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true disease prevalence $p$ is approximately $(0.0002194, 0.002912)$.",
