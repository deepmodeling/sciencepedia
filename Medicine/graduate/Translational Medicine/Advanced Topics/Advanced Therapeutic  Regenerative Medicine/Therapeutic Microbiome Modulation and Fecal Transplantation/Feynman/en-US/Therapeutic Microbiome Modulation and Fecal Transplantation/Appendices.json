            "problem": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is strongly associated with recent systemic antibiotic exposure, which disrupts gut microbial ecology and predisposes to overgrowth of toxigenic strains. In a hospital population where translational interventions such as Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) are considered for recurrent CDI, suppose recent antibiotic exposure has a relative risk $RR$ for incident CDI compared with no recent antibiotic exposure, and the exposure prevalence is $p_{e}$ in the population. Using only core epidemiologic definitions, derive a closed-form expression for the population attributable fraction $PAF$ of CDI due to recent antibiotics in terms of $RR$ and $p_{e}$. Then, evaluate this expression for $RR=6$ and $p_{e}=0.2$. Express your final numerical answer as a single decimal or fraction without a percent sign and do not round. After computing the value, briefly explain, from a translational medicine perspective, how the magnitude of $PAF$ informs antibiotic stewardship and the anticipated impact of FMT programs on the CDI burden in this setting.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the population attributable fraction ($PAF$) and its subsequent evaluation and interpretation.\n\nFirst, we define the fundamental epidemiological quantities involved. Let $I_{e}$ be the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in the population exposed to recent antibiotics, and let $I_{u}$ be the incidence in the unexposed population. The prevalence of exposure in the total population is given as $p_{e}$. The total incidence of CDI in the population, $I_{total}$, is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups:\n$$ I_{total} = (p_{e} \\times I_{e}) + ((1 - p_{e}) \\times I_{u}) $$\n\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$ RR = \\frac{I_{e}}{I_{u}} $$\nFrom this definition, we can express $I_{e}$ in terms of $RR$ and $I_{u}$:\n$$ I_{e} = RR \\times I_{u} $$\n\nThe population attributable fraction ($PAF$) is the proportion of the total disease incidence in the population that is attributable to the exposure. It represents the fraction of cases that would be prevented if the exposure were eliminated. The formula for $PAF$ is:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{I_{total} - I_{u}}{I_{total}} $$\n\nTo derive the expression for $PAF$ in terms of $RR$ and $p_{e}$, we substitute the expressions for $I_{total}$ and $I_{e}$ into the $PAF$ formula. First, let's substitute the expression for $I_{total}$:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{[(p_{e} \\times I_{e}) + ((1 - p_{e}) \\times I_{u})] - I_{u}}{(p_{e} \\times I_{e}) + ((1 - p_{e}) \\times I_{u})} $$\n\nNext, we substitute $I_{e} = RR \\times I_{u}$:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{[(p_{e} \\times RR \\times I_{u}) + ((1 - p_{e}) \\times I_{u})] - I_{u}}{(p_{e} \\times RR \\times I_{u}) + ((1 - p_{e}) \\times I_{u})} $$\n\nWe can factor out $I_{u}$ from every term in the numerator and the denominator. Assuming $I_{u} > 0$ (i.e., there is a non-zero baseline risk of CDI even without antibiotic exposure), we can cancel this term:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{I_{u} [p_{e} \\times RR + (1 - p_{e}) - 1]}{I_{u} [p_{e} \\times RR + (1 - p_{e})]} $$\n$$ PAF = \\frac{p_{e} \\times RR + 1 - p_{e} - 1}{p_{e} \\times RR + 1 - p_{e}} $$\n\nSimplifying the numerator gives:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{p_{e} \\times RR - p_{e}}{p_{e} \\times RR - p_{e} + 1} $$\n\nFactoring out $p_{e}$ in the numerator yields the final closed-form expression, commonly known as Levin's formula:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{p_{e}(RR - 1)}{1 + p_{e}(RR - 1)} $$\nThis is the required expression for $PAF$ in terms of $RR$ and $p_{e}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $RR = 6$ and $p_{e} = 0.2$.\n$$ PAF = \\frac{0.2(6 - 1)}{1 + 0.2(6 - 1)} $$\n$$ PAF = \\frac{0.2(5)}{1 + 0.2(5)} $$\n$$ PAF = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} $$\n$$ PAF = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ PAF = 0.5 $$\n\nFinally, we provide the translational medicine interpretation of this result.\nA $PAF$ of $0.5$ means that $50\\%$ of all CDI cases in this hospital population are directly attributable to recent antibiotic exposure. This is a substantial fraction, carrying significant implications for clinical practice and public health strategy.\n\nFrom a translational medicine perspective, this high $PAF$ provides a quantitative justification for prioritizing antibiotic stewardship programs. Such programs aim to optimize antibiotic use by ensuring they are prescribed only when necessary, with the correct agent, dose, and duration. The $PAF$ of $0.5$ implies that, theoretically, up to half of all CDI cases in this population could be prevented by completely eliminating unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic exposure. This highlights antibiotic stewardship not just as good practice, but as a high-impact primary prevention strategy for CDI.\n\nRegarding Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), which is a highly effective therapy for *recurrent* CDI, the $PAF$ value provides crucial context. While FMT addresses the downstream consequences of gut dysbiosis by restoring a healthy microbiome, the high $PAF$ underscores the importance of upstream interventions. A large proportion of the CDI burden, which creates the pool of patients who may eventually suffer from recurrence and require FMT, is preventable. Therefore, a comprehensive CDI control strategy must integrate primary prevention (antibiotic stewardship) to reduce incident cases with effective treatments like FMT for managing recurrent cases. The magnitude of the $PAF$ strongly suggests that focusing on antibiotic stewardship can significantly reduce the overall burden of CDI, thereby decreasing the number of patients who will ultimately need to be considered for FMT.",

            "problem": "A translational medicine team is evaluating therapeutic microbiome modulation via Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. They collect paired stool samples at baseline and at a post-FMT time point and measure both sequencing-based compositions and total microbial load using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) targeted to the $16\\text{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Let $i$ index taxa, let $a_i$ denote the absolute abundance (cells per gram or $16\\text{S}$ copies per gram), let $L$ denote the total microbial load (sum across all taxa), and let $p_i$ denote the relative abundance defined by $p_i = a_i / L$ with the compositional constraint $\\sum_i p_i = 1$. Differential tests commonly operate on $p_i$ or log-transforms thereof.\n\nFor one patient, the team observes the following for a key engrafting taxon $X$:\n- Baseline total load $L_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ copies per gram and baseline absolute abundance $a_{X,1} = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}$ copies per gram.\n- Post-FMT total load $L_2 = 2.2 \\times 10^{10}$ copies per gram and post-FMT absolute abundance $a_{X,2} = 6.0 \\times 10^{8}$ copies per gram.\n\nAssume all measurements are accurate and that library preparation and sequencing yield compositional data (i.e., proportional to $p_i$).

Rarefying read counts to equal sequencing depth per sample removes the compositional constraint $\\sum_i p_i = 1$ and thus prevents spurious negatives when $L$ changes across samples.",
            "solution": "### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between relative abundance ($p_i$), absolute abundance ($a_i$), and total microbial load ($L$). The definition is given as:\n$$ p_i = \\frac{a_i}{L} $$\nWhen comparing two conditions (e.g., baseline $1$ and post-FMT $2$), the change in relative abundance for a taxon $i$ is given by the ratio $p_{i,2}/p_{i,1}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_{i,2}}{p_{i,1}} = \\frac{a_{i,2} / L_2}{a_{i,1} / L_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_{i,2}}{a_{i,1}}\\right) \\bigg/ \\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right) $$\nThis equation demonstrates that the fold change in relative abundance is the fold change in absolute abundance divided by the fold change in total load. Inference on relative abundance ($p_i$) can be misleading about the change in absolute abundance ($a_i$) if the total load ($L$) changes between conditions.\n\nLet us apply this to the provided data for taxon $X$:\n1.  **Change in absolute abundance ($a_X$):**\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}} = \\dfrac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{5.0 \\times 10^{8}} = 1.2$.\n    Since this ratio is greater than $1$, the absolute abundance of taxon $X$ increased by $20\\%$.\n\n2.  **Change in total load ($L$):**\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{L_2}{L_1} = \\dfrac{2.2 \\times 10^{10}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.2$.\n    The total microbial load increased by $120\\%$.\n\n3.  **Change in relative abundance ($p_X$):**\n    First, we calculate the relative abundances at each timepoint:\n    $$ p_{X,1} = \\frac{a_{X,1}}{L_1} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.05 $$\n    $$ p_{X,2} = \\frac{a_{X,2}}{L_2} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{2.2 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{6}{220} = \\frac{3}{110} \\approx 0.02727 $$\n    The fold change is $\\dfrac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}} = \\dfrac{0.02727...}{0.05} \\approx 0.5454...$.\n    Alternatively, using the derived formula:\n    $$ \\frac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}} = \\frac{\\text{fold change in } a_X}{\\text{fold change in } L} = \\frac{1.2}{2.2} = \\frac{12}{22} = \\frac{6}{11} \\approx 0.5454... $$\n    Since this ratio is less than $1$, the relative abundance of taxon $X$ decreased by approximately $45.5\\%$.\n\nThis calculation confirms the core issue: a statistical test on relative abundance data ($p_X$) would likely conclude that taxon $X$ decreased, whereas its absolute abundance ($a_X$) actually increased. This is a classic example of compositional confounding.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In this patient, $a_{X}$ increased but $p_{X}$ decreased because $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}} < \\dfrac{L_2}{L_1}$; therefore, a differential test on $p_{X}$ would produce a spurious negative for the absolute change.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** Our calculations show that $a_X$ increased (fold change $1.2$) while $p_X$ decreased (fold change $\\approx 0.545$). The reason for the decrease in $p_X$ is that the fold change in $L$ ($2.2$) was greater than the fold change in $a_X$ ($1.2$). The condition $\\dfrac{a_{X,2}}{a_{X,1}} < \\dfrac{L_2}{L_1}$ is precisely the condition for $\\dfrac{p_{X,2}}{p_{X,1}} < 1$. In our case, $1.2 < 2.2$, which is true. A differential test on $p_X$ would detect a decrease. This is a \"spurious negative\" because the true change in absolute amount was positive (an increase), meaning the test on relative data gives a misleading result directionally opposite to the absolute change. The statement is entirely correct according to first principles and the data.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Relative and absolute abundance are interchangeable once sequencing depth is normalized; inference on $p_i$ recovers changes in $a_i$ even if $L$ changes.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Normalizing sequencing depth (e.g., by converting read counts to proportions or rarefying) is a technical correction to ensure that the total number of reads is constant across samples. This procedure yields estimates of relative abundance, $p_i$. It does not, and cannot, account for biological changes in the total microbial load, $L$. The very example in the problem, where inference on $p_i$ and $a_i$ give opposite results, directly refutes this claim. Compositionality is an inherent property of the data relative to a biological total, not just a technical artifact of sequencing depth.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Applying the centered log-ratio (CLR) transform to $p_i$ fully recovers absolute fold changes in $a_i$ without any external measurement of $L$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The CLR transform is defined as $\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\log(p_i) - \\text{mean}(\\log(\\mathbf{p}))$. The change between two time points is $\\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\text{clr}(p_{i,2}) - \\text{clr}(p_{i,1})$. Substituting $p_i = a_i/L$, we get $\\log(p_i) = \\log(a_i) - \\log(L)$. The change in CLR is:\n    $$ \\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = [\\log(a_{i,2}) - \\log(L_2)] - [\\log(a_{i,1}) - \\log(L_1)] - [\\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_2)} - \\log(L_2)] + [\\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_1)} - \\log(L_1)] $$\n    $$ \\Delta\\text{clr}(p_i) = \\log\\left(\\frac{a_{i,2}}{a_{i,1}}\\right) - \\left( \\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_2)} - \\overline{\\log(\\mathbf{a}_1)} \\right) $$\n    The change in CLR-transformed data equals the log-fold-change in absolute abundance *minus* the change in the geometric mean of all absolute abundances. It does not equal the log-fold-change in $a_i$ alone, unless the geometric mean of absolute abundances is constant across samples, which is not generally true and is certainly not guaranteed. Thus, CLR does not recover absolute fold changes without external information.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Incorporating an external estimate of $L$ (for example, via internal spike-in DNA standards, flow cytometry, or digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR)) and modeling $a_i$ directly or including $\\log L$ as an offset in a generalized linear model (GLM) mitigates compositional confounding and avoids spurious negatives.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement proposes the correct family of solutions. If an independent measurement of total load $L$ is available for each sample, one can directly calculate estimates of absolute abundances: $a_i = p_i \\times L$. Statistical testing can then be performed on the $a_i$ values, which are not compositional and represent the quantity of interest. Alternatively, in a count-based GLM (e.g., Negative Binomial), the expected count for taxon $i$ in sample $s$, $E[C_{is}]$, can be modeled as a function of absolute abundance $a_{is}$. The relationship is $E[C_{is}] \\propto p_{is} \\propto a_{is}/L_s$. A typical GLM has the form $\\log(E[C_{is}]) = \\text{predictors} + \\text{offset}$. Usually, the offset is $\\log(\\text{sequencing depth})$. By including $\\log(L_s)$ in the model formulation, typically as an additional offset term, the model's coefficients can be interpreted as effects on $\\log(a_{is})$, thereby correctly testing for changes in absolute abundance. This is a standard and valid approach to overcome compositional effects.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Rarefying read counts to equal sequencing depth per sample removes the compositional constraint $\\sum_i p_i = 1$ and thus prevents spurious negatives when $L$ changes across samples.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** Rarefying is a method of subsampling read counts to achieve equal library sizes across samples. It is one way to normalize for technical variation in sequencing depth. However, the resulting data are still fundamentally compositional. After rarefying to a depth of $N$, the new proportions are $p'_i = (\\text{rarefied count for } i) / N$. The sum of these new proportions across all taxa $i$ is still constrained: $\\sum_i p'_i = 1$. Rarefaction does not alter the fact that the measurements are relative proportions of a whole, and it certainly does not provide information about the biological total load $L$. Therefore, it does not solve the problem of compositional confounding arising from changes in $L$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

Assume the following fundamental base: observed sequencing read counts are proportional to the number of input amplicon template molecules in the library under linear sampling, and the proportionality factor (reflecting extraction, library preparation, and sequencing sampling efficiency within a sample) is identical for endogenous amplicons and the spike-in calibrator.
