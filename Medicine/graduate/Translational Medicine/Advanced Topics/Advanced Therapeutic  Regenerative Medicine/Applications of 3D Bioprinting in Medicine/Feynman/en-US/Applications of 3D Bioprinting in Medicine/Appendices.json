The scaffold is built layer by layer, with each layer consisting of parallel filaments of diameter $d$. The layer height is also $d$. Successive layers are rotated by $90^{\\circ}$. The filaments are idealized as prismatic struts of width $d$ and height $d$.\n\nTo analyze the structure's properties, we define a representative unit cell (RUC). This is the smallest repeating volume element that can be used to tile space and reconstruct the entire scaffold. Given the $90^{\\circ}$ rotation between layers, the repeating unit in the vertical direction (let's call it the $z$-axis) must span two layers. Let the filaments in the first layer be oriented along the $x$-axis and the filaments in the second layer be oriented along the $y$-axis. The center-to-center spacing of filaments within any layer is $s$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal repeating unit cell in the $xy$-plane has dimensions $s \\times s$. The height of the RUC must encompass two layers, each of height $d$. So, the total height of the RUC is $2d$. The total volume of this cuboid RUC is:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = (\\text{width}) \\times (\\text{depth}) \\times (\\text{height}) = s \\times s \\times (2d) = 2ds^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of the solid material, $V_{\\text{solid}}$, within this RUC. The RUC contains a segment of one filament from the first layer and a segment of one filament from the second layer.\n\nThe first layer occupies the vertical region $z \\in [0, d]$. Within the RUC, it contains a single filament segment oriented along the $x$-axis. The length of this segment is $s$. The filament is idealized as a prismatic strut with a square cross-section of $d \\times d$. The volume of this filament segment is:\n$$V_{\\text{filament, 1}} = (\\text{cross-sectional area}) \\times (\\text{length}) = (d \\times d) \\times s = d^2s$$\n\nThe second layer occupies the vertical region $z \\in [d, 2d]$.

The volume of this second filament segment is:\n$$V_{\\text{filament, 2}} = (d \\times d) \\times s = d^2s$$\n\nThe problem states that the filaments \"do not interpenetrate between layers.\" This is consistent with our model where the first layer occupies $z \\in [0, d]$ and the second layer occupies $z \\in [d, 2d]$. The two filament segments within the RUC are not overlapping in volume; they are stacked. Therefore, the total solid volume within the RUC is the simple sum of the volumes of the two segments:\n$$V_{\\text{solid}} = V_{\\text{filament, 1}} + V_{\\text{filament, 2}} = d^2s + d^2s = 2d^2s$$\n\nThe solid volume fraction, $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the solid volume to the total volume of the RUC:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{V_{\\text{solid}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{2d^2s}{2ds^2} = \\frac{d}{s}$$\n\nThe porosity, $\\epsilon$, is defined as $\\epsilon = 1 - \\phi$.
