This practice models a common regulatory motif: a gene circuit where the production of a therapeutic protein is repressed by a small-molecule ligand. By setting the rate of protein production, governed by a Hill-type function, equal to the rate of its clearance, you will calculate the steady-state concentration. Mastering this type of analysis  is fundamental for tuning circuit parameters to achieve a desired therapeutic dose in a specific physiological context.",

            "introduction": "While controlling a single circuit is fundamental, real-world therapeutic design must contend with the challenge of specificity and potential off-target effects. This exercise  models a common scenario where a drug ligand has affinity for both an on-target and an off-target receptor. You will apply equilibrium binding principles to perform a constrained optimization, finding the ideal ligand concentration that maximizes specificity without sacrificing necessary on-target efficacy.

            "problem": "A translational gene therapy program deploys two engineered inducible circuits, each using a synthetic receptor to sense the same small-molecule ligand for therapeutic control. Circuit $1$ is the intended on-target system and Circuit $2$ is an off-target system that exhibits partial ligand affinity due to shared scaffold features. Crosstalk risk is quantified by the specificity ratio, defined as the ratio of the fractional occupancies of the two receptors at a chosen ligand concentration. Under the following assumptions: (i) one-to-one ligand–receptor binding, (ii) quasi-steady-state equilibrium, and (iii) ligand in excess relative to receptor such that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the applied ligand concentration, start from the mass-action definition of the dissociation constant, $$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]},$$ and the conservation identity $$[R]_{T} = [R] + [RL],$$ where $[R]$ is the unbound receptor concentration, $[RL]$ is the ligand–receptor complex concentration, and $[R]_{T}$ is the total receptor concentration. Using these foundations, derive an expression for the fractional occupancy $f$ of a receptor as a function of the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$. Then, for two receptors with dissociation constants $K_{d1}$ and $K_{d2}$, define the specificity ratio $$S([L]) = \\frac{f_{1}([L])}{f_{2}([L])}.$$ The clinical constraint for on-target efficacy is that the on-target fractional occupancy satisfies $$f_{1}([L]) \\ge \\theta,$$ where $\\theta$ is a required activation threshold.\n\nGiven $$K_{d1} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM},\\qquad K_{d2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM},\\qquad \\theta = 0.60,$$ choose the ligand concentration $[L]$ to maximize $S([L])$ subject to the constraint $f_{1}([L]) \\ge \\theta$, and compute the resulting maximal specificity ratio.

            "solution": "First, we derive an expression for the fractional occupancy $f$ as a function of ligand concentration $[L]$ and dissociation constant $K_d$. The fractional occupancy is defined as $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{T}}$. The given relations are $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$ and $[R]_{T} = [R] + [RL]$. From the second equation, we express the unbound receptor concentration as $[R] = [R]_{T} - [RL]$. Substituting this into the $K_d$ equation gives:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{([R]_{T} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nSolving for $[RL]$:\n$$K_{d} [RL] = [R]_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$[RL] (K_{d} + [L]) = [R]_{T}[L]$$\n$$[RL] = \\frac{[R]_{T}[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nDividing by $[R]_T$ gives the fractional occupancy:\n$$f([L]) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{T}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nNext, we write the specificity ratio $S([L])$ using the fractional occupancies for the two receptors, $f_1$ and $f_2$:\n$$S([L]) = \\frac{f_{1}([L])}{f_{2}([L])} = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_{d1} + [L]}}{\\frac{[L]}{K_{d2} + [L]}} = \\frac{K_{d2} + [L]}{K_{d1} + [L]}$$\nThe problem is to maximize $S([L])$ subject to the constraint $f_{1}([L]) \\ge \\theta$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a closed-form analytic expression for the expected false positive rate, which is defined as the joint probability $\\Pr(A=1, B=1)$. Let us denote this probability by $p_{11}$. The given information includes the marginal probabilities $f_A = \\Pr(A=1)$ and $f_B = \\Pr(B=1)$, and the odds ratio $\\omega$.\n\nThe joint probability distribution of the two Bernoulli random variables $(A,B)$ is given by the four probabilities $p_{ij} = \\Pr(A=i, B=j)$ for $i, j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.
