            "problem": "A patient is being evaluated for Brief Psychotic Disorder (BPD). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the duration criterion for BPD is that the total duration of psychosis is at least $1$ day and less than $30$ days, with eventual full return to premorbid functioning. Duration is defined as the elapsed time from the onset of the first psychotic symptom (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior) to the time at which no psychotic symptoms are present (remission). Multiple informants provide uncertain time windows for onset and remission.\n\nAll times below refer to the same year and time zone, and all clocks are considered synchronized. Interpret “between” statements as closed intervals. Use the following constraints:\n\nOnset constraints:\n- Patient report: onset occurred between Monday, June $2$ at $18{:}00$ and Tuesday, June $3$ at $06{:}00$.\n- Father’s report: onset occurred between Monday, June $2$ at $19{:}30$ and Tuesday, June $3$ at $07{:}00$.\n- Employer record: onset occurred between Monday, June $2$ at $17{:}00$ and Tuesday, June $3$ at $09{:}30$.\n\nRemission constraints:\n- Clinician progress notes: last clearly documented psychotic symptom at Friday, June $27$ at $12{:}00$; by Friday, June $27$ at $18{:}00$ no psychotic symptoms were present. Interpret as remission occurring between Friday, June $27$ at $12{:}00$ and Friday, June $27$ at $18{:}00$.\n- Mother’s report: psychotic symptoms still present on Friday, June $27$ at $08{:}00$; fully back to baseline by Saturday, June $28$ at $18{:}00$. Interpret as remission between Friday, June $27$ at $08{:}00$ and Saturday, June $28$ at $18{:}00$.\n- Employer observation: last odd behavior noted on Friday, June $27$ at $15{:}00$; performed normally on a team call on Saturday, June $28$ at $10{:}00$. Interpret as remission between Friday, June $27$ at $15{:}00$ and Saturday, June $28$ at $10{:}00$.\n\nAssume the true onset time lies in the intersection of all onset intervals, and the true remission time lies in the intersection of all remission intervals. Define the plausible onset window as the intersection of the three onset intervals, and the plausible remission window as the intersection of the three remission intervals.\n\nLet the minimum plausible duration in days, $D_{\\min}$, be the difference between the earliest time in the plausible remission window and the latest time in the plausible onset window, and the maximum plausible duration, $D_{\\max}$, be the difference between the latest time in the plausible remission window and the earliest time in the plausible onset window. Express durations in days, where one hour equals $1/24$ of a day.\n\nDefine an indicator $I$ for the DSM-5 BPD duration criterion under a conservative standard of evidence:\n- $I = 1$ if $D_{\\min} \\geq 1$ and $D_{\\max} < 30$.\n- $I = 0$ otherwise.\n\nCompute $D_{\\min}$ and $D_{\\max}$ as defined, and then compute $I$. Report only the value of $I$ as your final answer (no units). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of an indicator variable, $I$, which determines if the duration of a psychotic episode meets the DSM-5 criteria for Brief Psychotic Disorder based on a conservative analysis of uncertain time reports. This involves determining the plausible time windows for the onset and remission of psychosis, calculating the minimum and maximum plausible durations, and comparing these durations to the specified criteria.\n\nFirst, the problem must be validated.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- BPD duration criterion: at least $1$ day and less than $30$ days.\n- Onset intervals:\n    - Patient: [Monday, June $2$ at $18{:}00$; Tuesday, June $3$ at $06{:}00$]\n    - Father: [Monday, June $2$ at $19{:}30$; Tuesday, June $3$ at $07{:}00$]\n    - Employer: [Monday, June $2$ at $17{:}00$; Tuesday, June $3$ at $09{:}30$]\n- Remission intervals:\n    - Clinician: [Friday, June $27$ at $12{:}00$; Friday, June $27$ at $18{:}00$]\n    - Mother: [Friday, June $27$ at $08{:}00$; Saturday, June $28$ at $18{:}00$]\n    - Employer: [Friday, June $27$ at $15{:}00$; Saturday, June $28$ at $10{:}00$]\n- Plausible onset window: Intersection of the three onset intervals.\n- Plausible remission window: Intersection of the three remission intervals.\n- Minimum duration, $D_{\\min}$: (Earliest plausible remission time) - (Latest plausible onset time).\n- Maximum duration, $D_{\\max}$: (Latest plausible remission time) - (Earliest plausible onset time).\n- Unit conversion: $1$ hour = $1/24$ of a day.\n- Indicator $I$: $I = 1$ if $D_{\\min} \\geq 1$ and $D_{\\max} < 30$; $I = 0$ otherwise.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using criteria from the DSM-5. It is well-posed, with all terms and calculation methods explicitly defined. The data is self-contained and consistent. The problem is a formalization of uncertainty using interval analysis, a standard mathematical technique. It is objective and does not rely on non-verifiable claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nTo perform the calculations, we establish a consistent time coordinate system. Let $t$ be the time in hours, with $t=0$ corresponding to June $1$ at $00{:}00$. A time on day $d$ of June at hour $H$ and minute $M$ is represented as $t = (d-1) \\times 24 + H + \\frac{M}{60}$.\n\n**1. Convert Onset Intervals to Hours**\nLet the onset intervals from the patient, father, and employer be $O_p$, $O_f$, and $O_e$, respectively.\n- $O_p$: From June $2$ at $18{:}00$ to June $3$ at $06{:}00$.\n$t_{p,start} = (2-1) \\times 24 + 18 = 42$ hours.\n$t_{p,end} = (3-1) \\times 24 + 6 = 54$ hours.\nSo, $O_p = [42, 54]$.\n\n- $O_f$: From June $2$ at $19{:}30$ to June $3$ at $07{:}00$.\n$t_{f,start} = (2-1) \\times 24 + 19.5 = 43.5$ hours.\n$t_{f,end} = (3-1) \\times 24 + 7 = 55$ hours.\nSo, $O_f = [43.5, 55]$.\n\n- $O_e$: From June $2$ at $17{:}00$ to June $3$ at $09{:}30$.\n$t_{e,start} = (2-1) \\times 24 + 17 = 41$ hours.\n$t_{e,end} = (3-1) \\times 24 + 9.5 = 57.5$ hours.\nSo, $O_e = [41, 57.5]$.\n\n**2. Determine the Plausible Onset Window**\nThe plausible onset window, $W_O$, is the intersection of these intervals: $W_O = O_p \\cap O_f \\cap O_e$.\nLet $W_O = [t_{O,early}, t_{O,late}]$.\nThe earliest time in the window, $t_{O,early}$, is the maximum of the start times:\n$$t_{O,early} = \\max(42, 43.5, 41) = 43.5 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe latest time in the window, $t_{O,late}$, is the minimum of the end times:\n$$t_{O,late} = \\min(54, 55, 57.5) = 54 \\text{ hours}$$\nThus, the plausible onset window is $W_O = [43.5, 54]$.\n\n**3. Convert Remission Intervals to Hours**\nLet the remission intervals from the clinician, mother, and employer be $R_c$, $R_m$, and $R_e$, respectively.\n- $R_c$: From June $27$ at $12{:}00$ to June $27$ at $18{:}00$.\n$t_{c,start} = (27-1) \\times 24 + 12 = 624 + 12 = 636$ hours.\n$t_{c,end} = (27-1) \\times 24 + 18 = 624 + 18 = 642$ hours.\nSo, $R_c = [636, 642]$.\n\n- $R_m$: From June $27$ at $08{:}00$ to June $28$ at $18{:}00$.\n$t_{m,start} = (27-1) \\times 24 + 8 = 624 + 8 = 632$ hours.\n$t_{m,end} = (28-1) \\times 24 + 18 = 648 + 18 = 666$ hours.\nSo, $R_m = [632, 666]$.\n\n- $R_e$: From June $27$ at $15{:}00$ to June $28$ at $10{:}00$.\n$t_{e,start} = (27-1) \\times 24 + 15 = 624 + 15 = 639$ hours.\n$t_{e,end} = (28-1) \\times 24 + 10 = 648 + 10 = 658$ hours.\nSo, $R_e = [639, 658]$.\n\n**4. Determine the Plausible Remission Window**\nThe plausible remission window, $W_R$, is the intersection of these intervals: $W_R = R_c \\cap R_m \\cap R_e$.\nLet $W_R = [t_{R,early}, t_{R,late}]$.\nThe earliest time in the window, $t_{R,early}$, is the maximum of the start times:\n$$t_{R,early} = \\max(636, 632, 639) = 639 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe latest time in the window, $t_{R,late}$, is the minimum of the end times:\n$$t_{R,late} = \\min(642, 666, 658) = 642 \\text{ hours}$$\nThus, the plausible remission window is $W_R = [639, 642]$.\n\n**5. Calculate Minimum and Maximum Plausible Durations**\nAccording to the problem's definitions:\n$D_{\\min}$ is the difference between the earliest plausible remission time ($t_{R,early}$) and the latest plausible onset time ($t_{O,late}$).\nIn hours, this duration is $t_{R,early} - t_{O,late} = 639 - 54 = 585$ hours.\nConverting to days (dividing by $24$):\n$$D_{\\min} = \\frac{585}{24} = 24.375 \\text{ days}$$\n\n$D_{\\max}$ is the difference between the latest plausible remission time ($t_{R,late}$) and the earliest plausible onset time ($t_{O,early}$).\nIn hours, this duration is $t_{R,late} - t_{O,early} = 642 - 43.5 = 598.5$ hours.\nConverting to days:\n$$D_{\\max} = \\frac{598.5}{24} = \\frac{1197}{48} = \\frac{399}{16} = 24.9375 \\text{ days}$$\n\n**6. Compute the Indicator $I$**\nThe indicator $I$ is defined as $1$ if $D_{\\min} \\geq 1$ and $D_{\\max} < 30$, and $0$ otherwise.\nWe check the two conditions:\n- Condition 1: $D_{\\min} \\geq 1$. We have $24.375 \\geq 1$, which is true.\n- Condition 2: $D_{\\max} < 30$. We have $24.9375 < 30$, which is also true.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the value of the indicator is $I=1$.",

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a $27$-year-old graduate student over a $30$-day observation period, where $t$ is the day number ($t\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,30\\}$):\n- **Psychiatric History:** None.\n- **Medical Status:** No substance use, no medications, normal labs and head imaging, no medical or neurological cause of symptoms.\n- **Stressor:** An acute psychosocial stressor occurred on day $t=7$.\n- **Measurements:**\n    - Elevated mood rating $M(t)$, scale $0$–$10$.\n    - Depressed mood rating $D(t)$, scale $0$–$10$.\n    - Binary psychosis indicator $P(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$, with $P(t)=1$ indicating presence of persecutory delusions, second-person auditory hallucinations, and disorganized speech.\n- **Time Series Data:**\n    - Baseline ($t=1$–$6$): $M(t)\\in[0,2]$, $D(t)\\in[1,3]$, $P(t)=0$, intact functioning.\n    - Stressor ($t=7$): Stressor occurs. $M(7)=3$, $D(7)=3$, $P(7)=0$.\n    - Psychotic Episode ($t=8$–$16$):\n        - $P(t)=1$ for this entire interval. Total duration is $16-8+1=9$ days.\n        - Impaired role functioning is present during this interval.\n    - Mood Symptoms during Psychosis:\n        - $t=8$–$9$: $M(t)\\ge 6$ with symptoms of elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, decreased need for sleep, and talkativeness. Duration is $2$ days. No hospitalization and no marked impairment beyond that from psychosis.

Duration is $8$ days.\n        - Outside $t=18$–$25$, $D(t)\\le 3$.\n        - Functioning returns to premorbid baseline by $t=20$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is a formal representation of a clinical vignette. It utilizes quantitative and binary variables ($M(t)$, $D(t)$, $P(t)$) to precisely define the onset, duration, and overlap of psychiatric symptoms, which is a methodologically sound way to eliminate ambiguity in a diagnostic problem.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established psychiatric diagnostic criteria, likely from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The symptom clusters, timelines, and differential diagnoses are standard in clinical psychiatry. The formalization, while not typical of a clinical chart, is a valid abstraction for a logical problem.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete and self-consistent dataset for the specified time interval. The question asks for the best-fitting diagnosis, which is a standard task in this field. The detailed timeline allows for a definitive answer by systematically applying diagnostic rules.\n- **Objective:** The use of numerical scales and a binary indicator makes the description highly objective. The qualitative descriptions use standard, non-biased clinical terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-structured, scientifically grounded, and objective diagnostic puzzle. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the diagnostic task is to analyze the duration and temporal relationship of psychotic and mood symptoms against standard diagnostic criteria.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Psychotic Episode:**\n    - Psychosis, defined by $P(t)=1$, is present from $t=8$ to $t=16$.\n    - The total duration of psychosis is $16 - 8 + 1 = 9$ days.\n    - This duration satisfies the condition of being at least $1$ day but less than $1$ month (approximately $30$ days).\n    - The onset of psychosis on $t=8$ is temporally linked to a marked stressor on $t=7$.\n    - There is a full return to premorbid functioning by $t=20$, after the episode resolves on $t=17$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mood Episodes:**\n    - **Manic/Hypomanic Symptoms:** Elevated mood symptoms ($M(t)\\ge 6$ plus descriptive symptoms) are present for $2$ days ($t=8$–$9$). This duration is insufficient for a manic episode (requires $\\ge 1$ week or any duration if hospitalization occurs) or a hypomanic episode (requires $\\ge 4$ consecutive days). Therefore, the patient did not experience a manic or hypomanic episode.\n    - **Major Depressive Symptoms:** A depressive syndrome is present from $t=18$ to $t=25$ (duration of $8$ days). However, the patient endorses only $4$ of $9$ symptoms. A Major Depressive Episode (MDE) requires $\\ge 5$ of $9$ symptoms for a duration of at least $2$ weeks ($14$ days). Therefore, the patient did not experience an MDE.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relationship between Psychosis and Mood:**\n    - The elevated mood symptoms ($t=8$–$9$) occur entirely *within* the psychotic episode ($t=8$–$16$).\n    - The depressive symptoms ($t=18$–$25$) occur entirely *after* the psychotic episode has resolved ($P(t)=0$ for $t \\ge 17$).\n    - Critically, there are days of psychosis without significant mood symptoms. From $t=10$ to $t=16$, $P(t)=1$ while mood is not significantly elevated ($M(t)\\le 3$) or depressed ($D(t)\\in[2,4]$). This means the psychotic symptoms are not confined to a mood episode.\n\nBased on this analysis, the episode is characterized by acute onset of psychosis following a stressor, lasting $9$ days, with full functional recovery, and where the psychosis is not better explained by a primary mood disorder. This clinical picture is the textbook definition of a brief psychotic disorder.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor (acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech lasting at least $1$ day but less than $1$ month, with full return to premorbid functioning; psychosis not confined to a mood episode)**\n- The psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech) are present.\n- The duration of psychosis is $9$ days, which is between $1$ day and $1$ month.\n- There is a full return to premorbid functioning.\n- The psychosis is preceded by a marked stressor.\n- The psychosis is not confined to a nonexistent manic or major depressive episode.\n- This diagnosis and its justification are fully consistent with all data provided.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a major depressive episode lasting at least $2$ weeks with at least $5$ symptoms including depressed mood or anhedonia)**\n- The patient did not experience a major depressive episode. The depressive period lasted only $8$ days and included only $4$ of $9$ required symptoms.\n- The psychotic symptoms ($t=8$–$16$) did not occur during the depressive period ($t=18$–$25$); they were temporally separate.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Bipolar I disorder, current manic episode with psychotic features (a manic episode lasting at least $1$ week or requiring hospitalization, with psychotic symptoms occurring during the manic episode)**\n- The patient did not experience a manic episode. The period of elevated mood lasted only $2$ days, which is less than the required $1$-week duration, and no hospitalization occurred.\n- A diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder requires at least one manic episode.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (a mood episode present for the majority of the total illness duration, plus at least $2$ weeks of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms)**\n- This diagnosis requires that a major mood episode (depressive or manic) occurs. As established, this did not happen.\n- It also requires that a mood episode be present for the majority of the total illness duration. This is not the case.\n- It also requires delusions or hallucinations for at least $2$ weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. The total duration of psychosis was only $9$ days.\n- This diagnosis fails on multiple criteria.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (psychosis temporally related to substance intoxication, withdrawal, or medication exposure, supported by objective evidence)**\n- The problem statement explicitly rules this out: \"no substance use, takes no medications, has normal laboratory testing and head imaging, and there is no evidence of a medical or neurological cause of symptoms.\"\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "A psychiatry service evaluates adults presenting with first-episode psychosis. The target diagnosis is brief psychotic disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). In this service, the pretest probability that a first-episode psychosis case meets criteria for brief psychotic disorder is $p_{0} = 0.15$. Three clinically observable features are assessed and treated as diagnostic tests, each coded as present or absent: (1) abrupt onset (defined as emergence of delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech reaching psychotic threshold within $48$ hours), (2) presence of a marked identifiable acute stressor within the preceding $2$ weeks, and (3) postpartum timing (onset within $4$ weeks after delivery). For each feature, the following operating characteristics are established against the reference diagnosis (brief psychotic disorder versus all other non-brief psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia spectrum, mood disorder with psychotic features, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder), based on prior validation in this setting:\n\n- Abrupt onset: sensitivity $= 0.82$, specificity $= 0.72$.\n- Marked stressor: sensitivity $= 0.58$, specificity $= 0.88$.\n- Postpartum timing: sensitivity $= 0.10$, specificity $= 0.97$.\n\nA new patient presents with all three features present. Assume conditional independence of these features given the true diagnosis. Starting from the foundational definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem in odds form, compute the combined effect of these features on the diagnostic probability.\n\nWhat is the posterior probability that this patient has brief psychotic disorder after integrating all three features? Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the posterior probability of a patient having brief psychotic disorder (BPD), given a set of clinical findings. This is an application of Bayesian inference, a cornerstone of statistical reasoning in science and medicine. We are instructed to proceed from foundational principles, using Bayes' theorem in odds form.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has BPD. The complementary event, $\\neg D$, is that the patient does not have BPD. The problem provides the pretest probability of the disorder, $P(D) = p_0 = 0.15$. The pretest probability of not having the disorder is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\n\nThe odds of an event are the ratio of its probability to the probability of its complement. The pretest odds of having BPD, denoted $O(D)$, are:\n$$O(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$$\n\nThe patient presents with three positive clinical features, which we can consider as three separate diagnostic tests. Let $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ be the events that the features \"abrupt onset,\" \"marked stressor,\" and \"postpartum timing\" are present, respectively. The total evidence is $E = T_1 \\cap T_2 \\cap T_3$.\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form relates the posterior odds, $O(D|E)$, to the pretest odds, $O(D)$, and a term called the likelihood ratio, $LR(E)$:\n$$O(D|E) = O(D) \\times LR(E)$$\nThe likelihood ratio $LR(E)$ quantifies the strength of the evidence $E$. It is defined as the ratio of the probability of observing the evidence $E$ in patients with the disorder to the probability of observing $E$ in patients without the disorder:\n$$LR(E) = \\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|\\neg D)}$$\n\nFor a single positive test result, $T^+$, the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^+$, is calculated from the test's sensitivity ($S_n$) and specificity ($S_p$). Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the disorder is present, $S_n = P(T^+|D)$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the disorder is absent, $S_p = P(T^-|\\neg D)$. It follows that the probability of a positive test in the absence of the disorder is $P(T^+|\\neg D) = 1 - S_p$. The positive likelihood ratio is thus:\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|\\neg D)} = \\frac{S_n}{1 - S_p}$$\n\nThe problem states that the three features are conditionally independent given the diagnosis. This critical assumption allows us to combine their evidential weight by multiplying their individual likelihood ratios. The combined likelihood ratio for all three features being present is:\n$$LR_{comb} = LR(E) = \\frac{P(T_1 \\cap T_2 \\cap T_3 | D)}{P(T_1 \\cap T_2 \\cap T_3 | \\neg D)} = \\frac{P(T_1|D)P(T_2|D)P(T_3|D)}{P(T_1|\\neg D)P(T_2|\\neg D)P(T_3|\\neg D)} = LR_1^+ \\times LR_2^+ \\times LR_3^+$$\n\nWe now calculate the individual positive likelihood ratios for each of the three features using the provided sensitivities and specificities:\n\n1.  Abrupt onset ($T_1$): $S_{n1} = 0.82$, $S_{p1} = 0.72$.\n    $$LR_1^+ = \\frac{S_{n1}}{1 - S_{p1}} = \\frac{0.82}{1 - 0.72} = \\frac{0.82}{0.28} = \\frac{82}{28} = \\frac{41}{14}$$\n\n2.  Marked stressor ($T_2$): $S_{n2} = 0.58$, $S_{p2} = 0.88$.\n    $$LR_2^+ = \\frac{S_{n2}}{1 - S_{p2}} = \\frac{0.58}{1 - 0.88} = \\frac{0.58}{0.12} = \\frac{58}{12} = \\frac{29}{6}$$\n\n3.  Postpartum timing ($T_3$): $S_{n3} = 0.10$, $S_{p3} = 0.97$.\n    $$LR_3^+ = \\frac{S_{n3}}{1 - S_{p3}} = \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.97} = \\frac{0.10}{0.03} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\n\nThe combined likelihood ratio is the product of these individual ratios:\n$$LR_{comb} = LR_1^+ \\times LR_2^+ \\times LR_3^+ = \\frac{41}{14} \\times \\frac{29}{6} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{41 \\times 29 \\times 10}{14 \\times 6 \\times 3} = \\frac{11890}{252} = \\frac{5945}{126}$$\n\nWith the combined likelihood ratio, we can now calculate the posterior odds of BPD:\n$$O(D|E) = O(D) \\times LR_{comb} = \\frac{3}{17} \\times \\frac{5945}{126}$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can reduce the fraction:\n$$O(D|E) = \\frac{1}{17} \\times \\frac{5945}{42} = \\frac{5945}{17 \\times 42} = \\frac{5945}{714}$$\n\nFinally, we must convert these posterior odds back into a probability. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is $P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\n$$P(D|E) = \\frac{O(D|E)}{1 + O(D|E)} = \\frac{\\frac{5945}{714}}{1 + \\frac{5945}{714}} = \\frac{\\frac{5945}{714}}{\\frac{714 + 5945}{714}} = \\frac{5945}{6659}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures as requested:\n$$P(D|E) = \\frac{5945}{6659} \\approx 0.89277669...$$\nRounding gives:\n$$P(D|E) \\approx 0.8928$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the patient has brief psychotic disorder.",
