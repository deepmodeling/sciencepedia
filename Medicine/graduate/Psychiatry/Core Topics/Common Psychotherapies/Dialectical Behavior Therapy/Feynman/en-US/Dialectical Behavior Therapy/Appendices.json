This practice focuses on transforming that raw data into clinical insight by quantitatively testing a core hypothesis of DBT: that the application of learned skills is associated with a reduction in maladaptive urges. By calculating the correlation between these two variables from a hypothetical diary card, you will practice a fundamental skill in data-driven therapy, learning to empirically validate the therapeutic process for an individual patient .",

            "problem": "A clinician using Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for a patient with recurrent non-suicidal self-injury collects a daily diary card for one week. Each day records two quantities: urge intensity for self-harm on a $0$ to $7$ Likert scale, and count of discrete DBT skills used that day. The week’s paired observations are, in order from day $1$ through day $7$, urges $[4, 5, 3, 7, 6, 5, 2]$ and skills used $[1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4]$. Treat the two sequences as realizations of paired variables over $n=7$ days.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of the sample mean, sample covariance, and sample standard deviation as the base, derive and then compute the sample Pearson correlation coefficient between daily urges and daily skills use for this week. In your reasoning, explicitly justify why this coefficient is an appropriate linear association metric for such diary-card data in psychiatric measurement.\n\nReport the final correlation as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard statistical analysis task within a plausible clinical context. All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided.\n\nLet the daily urge intensity be the variable $X$ and the daily count of skills used be the variable $Y$. The paired observations for $n=7$ days are given as:\n$x = [4, 5, 3, 7, 6, 5, 2]$\n$y = [1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4]$\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and computation of the sample Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, starting from the base definitions of sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample covariance.\n\nFirst, we define the sample mean for a variable $z$ with $n$ observations as:\n$$ \\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i $$\nThe sample covariance between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:\n$$ \\text{cov}(X, Y) = s_{xy} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) $$\nThe sample standard deviation for a variable $z$ is the square root of the sample variance, where the sample variance is:\n$$ s_z^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - \\bar{z})^2 $$\nThus, the sample standard deviation is $s_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - \\bar{z})^2}$. The use of the $n-1$ denominator provides an unbiased estimate of the population variance.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, is defined as the sample covariance normalized by the product of the two sample standard deviations:\n$$ r = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} $$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{n-1}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the computational formula based on sums of centered products and squares:\n$$ r = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} $$\nWe now compute the necessary quantities for $n=7$.\n\n1.

Calculate the sum of squared deviations from the mean for $Y$:\nThe deviations $(y_i - \\bar{y})$ are:\n$(1 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(2 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(2 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(0 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(1 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(3 - \\frac{13}{7})$, $(4 - \\frac{13}{7})$\nThis is the vector of deviations: $[\\frac{-6}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{-13}{7}, \\frac{-6}{7}, \\frac{8}{7}, \\frac{15}{7}]$.\nThe sum of squared deviations is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = (\\frac{-6}{7})^2 + (\\frac{1}{7})^2 + (\\frac{1}{7})^2 + (\\frac{-13}{7})^2 + (\\frac{-6}{7})^2 + (\\frac{8}{7})^2 + (\\frac{15}{7})^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = \\frac{36 + 1 + 1 + 169 + 36 + 64 + 225}{49} = \\frac{532}{49} = \\frac{76}{7} $$\n\n4.  Calculate the sum of the products of deviations (the numerator of the covariance term):\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = (\\frac{-4}{7})(\\frac{-6}{7}) + (\\frac{3}{7})(\\frac{1}{7}) + (\\frac{-11}{7})(\\frac{1}{7}) + (\\frac{17}{7})(\\frac{-13}{7}) + (\\frac{10}{7})(\\frac{-6}{7}) + (\\frac{3}{7})(\\frac{8}{7}) + (\\frac{-18}{7})(\\frac{15}{7}) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\frac{24 + 3 - 11 - 221 - 60 + 24 - 270}{49} = \\frac{-511}{49} = \\frac{-73}{7} $$\n\n5.  Substitute these sums into the formula for $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{\\frac{-73}{7}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{124}{7}} \\sqrt{\\frac{76}{7}}} = \\frac{-73/7}{\\sqrt{124 \\times 76}/7} = \\frac{-73}{\\sqrt{9424}} $$\n$$ r = \\frac{-73}{\\sqrt{16 \\times 589}} = \\frac{-73}{4\\sqrt{589}} $$\nTo obtain the decimal value, we compute the denominator:\n$$ \\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.26932219... $$\n$$ 4\\sqrt{589} \\approx 97.0772887... $$\n$$ r \\approx \\frac{-73}{97.0772887...} \\approx -0.751978... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $r = -0.7520$.\n\nThe problem also requires justification for why the Pearson coefficient is an appropriate metric. The core therapeutic model of DBT posits that the use of learned skills should reduce distress and maladaptive urges. This implies a negative correlation between skills use and urge intensity. The Pearson coefficient is a standard measure for quantifying the strength and direction of a *linear* relationship between two variables. As such, it is a primary and direct method for statistically evaluating this core hypothesis. Although one of the variables (urges) is measured on an ordinal Likert scale, it is common and accepted practice in psychological and medical research to treat such scales, particularly those with 7 or more levels, as approximately interval-level data for the purpose of parametric statistical analyses like correlation. The skills-use variable is a ratio-level count. Thus, despite the measurement-level nuance, Pearson's $r$ is an appropriate, widely understood, and informative first-pass metric for assessing the linear association in this context.\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation is requested. The calculated correlation of $r \\approx -0.7520$ is a strong negative correlation. This indicates that for this patient during this specific week, there was a strong tendency for higher levels of DBT skill use to be associated with lower levels of self-harm urges. From a coaching perspective, this powerfully reinforces the DBT model. The priority for the coming week would be to praise the patient's skill use, highlight this observed inverse relationship, and encourage consistent or increased application of skills, especially on days when urges begin to rise. Analyzing the day with the highest urge ($7$) and zero skills use (day $4$) would be a critical coaching target to understand barriers to skill use during peak distress.",

Use only fundamental epidemiological definitions: incidence rate as the ratio of total events to total person-time, and incidence rate ratio as the ratio of two incidence rates.

The fifth digit is $8$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$IRR \\approx 0.4005$$\n\nAs requested, a brief discussion on the magnitude of this effect is warranted. An $IRR$ of $0.4005$ indicates that the rate of NSSI during the DBT program was approximately $40.05\\%$ of the rate prior to treatment. This corresponds to a rate reduction of $1 - 0.4005 = 0.5995$, or $59.95\\%$. This is a large effect size. Seminal and subsequent randomized controlled trials of DBT for individuals with borderline personality disorder and high rates of self-harm have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in parasuicidal behaviors, including NSSI. For instance, effect sizes reported in the literature often correspond to rate reductions in the range of $50\\%$ or more compared to control conditions. Therefore, the calculated $IRR$ of approximately $0.4$ is a potent effect that aligns well with the magnitude of NSSI reduction typically reported in efficacious DBT programs. It represents a clinically meaningful and substantial decrease in self-injurious behavior.",

In a defined DBT patient cohort, the base rate (prior probability) of imminent self-harm within $24$ hours is estimated at $0.1$. An early warning indicator derived from the DBT diary card is recorded as “positive” when the evening urge intensity exceeds a threshold, and its operating characteristics in this cohort are sensitivity $0.8$ and specificity $0.7$.

We will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation:\n$$P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of a positive indicator.
