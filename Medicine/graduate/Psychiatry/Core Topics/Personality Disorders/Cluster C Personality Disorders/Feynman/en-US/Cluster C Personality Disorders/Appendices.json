This exercise  challenges you to distinguish between Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and anorexia nervosa, two conditions that can both involve rigid, rule-based behaviors around food. By working through this case, you will practice moving beyond surface-level symptoms to analyze the underlying motivational content and pervasiveness of traits, a crucial skill for discerning ego-syntonic personality patterns from the specific psychopathology of an eating disorder.",

            "problem": "A clinician is evaluating a patient whose presentation sits at the interface of a personality pattern and an eating-related syndrome. A $28$-year-old research fellow reports strict dietary rules (e.g., weighing portions, logging macronutrients, avoiding foods perceived as “inefficient”), alongside an unwavering drive for flawlessness at work, rigid adherence to protocols, and intolerance of deviations by colleagues. She endorses pride in her discipline and orderliness, and describes these traits as defining her identity and as generally beneficial. She denies an intense fear of weight gain, denies an overvaluation of weight or shape, and does not report body image distortion. Her body mass index (BMI) is $22$, menses are regular, and there is no medical instability. She requests help after receiving feedback that her rigidity is harming collaboration and delaying projects due to excessive refinement.\n\nUsing the following foundational bases in psychiatric nosology and psychopathology, select the single feature that most reliably distinguishes a clinical picture driven by Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) from one driven by anorexia nervosa when rigid dietary patterns are present:\n\n- In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), personality disorders are defined by enduring, inflexible patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural expectations, are pervasive across contexts, stable over time, and lead to distress or impairment; Cluster C personality disorders are characterized by anxious and fearful traits. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) is defined by pervasive preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. These traits are typically ego-syntonic, meaning they are aligned with the person’s self-concept and values and are not experienced as unwanted.\n- In DSM-5-TR, anorexia nervosa is defined by restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, and disturbance in the way one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Core psychopathology is weight/shape-specific. Rigid food-related behaviors may occur in the service of weight/shape goals. Atypical anorexia nervosa (a form within Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder) involves similar weight/shape psychopathology without low body weight.\n\nWhich option best isolates the discriminating feature between an OCPD-driven presentation and an anorexia nervosa-driven presentation in this scenario?\n\nA. Ego-syntonic perfectionism and need for control that are pervasive across domains, with dietary rigidity not motivated by weight/shape concerns, point toward OCPD rather than anorexia nervosa.\n\nB. The mere presence of calorie counting and rigid meal schedules is pathognomonic of anorexia nervosa, regardless of stated motivations or the absence of weight/shape concerns.\n\nC. Experiencing distress when routines are violated indicates ego-dystonia, which is the hallmark of Cluster C personality disorders, confirming OCPD over anorexia nervosa.\n\nD. A normal BMI of $22$ rules out anorexia nervosa and, by itself, excludes any eating disorder, thereby confirming OCPD.",
            "solution": "Begin from core definitions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) defines personality disorders by enduring, pervasive patterns that are inflexible across contexts and stable over time, causing impairment. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), within Cluster C, involves a pervasive preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control. Importantly, such traits are commonly ego-syntonic: the individual experiences them as congruent with personal values, advantageous, and integrally part of the self. In contrast, anorexia nervosa is defined by weight/shape-specific psychopathology: restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, persistent behaviors that interfere with weight gain, and disturbances in the experience or valuation of body weight/shape. Even when low weight is not present (atypical anorexia nervosa under Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder), the central motivational content remains weight/shape-specific. Thus, when rigid dietary behaviors are present, the key discriminant is not the rigidity itself but whether the rigidity serves global perfectionism and control across domains (ego-syntonic and not weight/shape-focused), versus serving weight/shape-specific goals with fear and overvaluation of weight/shape.\n\nApply these principles to the scenario. The patient’s rigidity spans multiple domains (work, interpersonal expectations, diet), is described as identity-defining and beneficial, and is not motivated by fear of fatness or overvaluation of weight/shape. Her BMI is normal, menses are regular, and there is no medical instability. The dietary rigidity appears as one expression of a broader, ego-syntonic perfectionistic style, consistent with OCPD. Eating disorder psychopathology would require weight/shape-specific content (e.g., intense fear of weight gain, overvaluation of thinness), and anorexia nervosa would also require significantly low body weight; atypical anorexia nervosa would retain the weight/shape-specific motivational content but not the low weight. Thus, the distinguishing feature is the content and scope of the psychopathology: ego-syntonic perfectionism across domains without weight/shape motivation favors OCPD; weight/shape-specific psychopathology favors an eating disorder.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Ego-syntonic perfectionism and need for control that are pervasive across domains, with dietary rigidity not motivated by weight/shape concerns, point toward OCPD rather than anorexia nervosa. This directly captures the principled distinction: OCPD’s pervasive, ego-syntonic perfectionism versus anorexia nervosa’s weight/shape-specific psychopathology. Correct.\n\n- Option B: The mere presence of calorie counting and rigid meal schedules is pathognomonic of anorexia nervosa, regardless of stated motivations or the absence of weight/shape concerns. This is a common misconception. Rigid food rules can occur in multiple conditions (OCPD, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, athletes’ performance routines, metabolic conditions) and are not pathognomonic. The motivational content is crucial. Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: Experiencing distress when routines are violated indicates ego-dystonia, which is the hallmark of Cluster C personality disorders, confirming OCPD over anorexia nervosa. This confuses constructs. OCPD is typically ego-syntonic; the distress arises from violation of self-endorsed standards, not from unwanted intrusive symptoms. Ego-dystonia is more characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), not OCPD. Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: A normal BMI of $22$ rules out anorexia nervosa and, by itself, excludes any eating disorder, thereby confirming OCPD. While typical anorexia nervosa requires significantly low body weight, a normal BMI does not, by itself, exclude all eating disorders; atypical anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders can occur at normal weight when weight/shape psychopathology is present. Therefore, BMI alone is not the discriminant. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the single best discriminating feature in this scenario is captured by Option A.",
