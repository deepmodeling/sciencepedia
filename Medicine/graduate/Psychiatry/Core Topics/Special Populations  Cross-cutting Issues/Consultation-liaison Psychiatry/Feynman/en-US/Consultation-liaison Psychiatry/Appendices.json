We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has delirium, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have delirium. Let $T+$ be the event that the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) yields a positive result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The pre-test probability of delirium, which is the prior probability $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = 0.20$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the CAM test. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present, $P(T+ | D)$.\n    $$P(T+ | D) = 0.94$$\n3.  The specificity of the CAM test. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent, $P(T- | D^c)$.\n    $$P(T- | D^c) = 0.89$$\n\nOur objective is to derive an expression for and compute the post-test probability of delirium given a positive test result, which is the posterior probability $P(D | T+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes’ theorem, which states:\n$$P(D | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | D) P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe term $P(T+ | D)$ is the sensitivity, and $P(D)$ is the pre-test probability (prior). Both are given. The denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be found using the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the patient has delirium and tests positive (a true positive), or the patient does not have delirium and tests positive (a false positive).\nWe can express $P(T+)$ as:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D) + P(T+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ | D) P(D) + P(T+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe need the values for $P(D^c)$ and $P(T+ | D^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having delirium, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of the probability of having delirium:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nThe term $P(T+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate).

The prevalence of delirium is the prior probability of a patient having the disease: $P(D) = 0.25$.\n    The probability of a patient not having delirium is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n2.

The specificity of the test is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for and compute the positive predictive value (PPV).

            "problem": "A hospitalized patient under Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry care has comorbid renal and hepatic impairment and requires initiation of sertraline for major depressive disorder and lorazepam for severe anxiety with agitation. The patient’s measured creatinine clearance (Creatinine Clearance, $CrCl$) is $30$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ and the hepatic function is indexed by the Child-Pugh score (Child-Pugh, $CP$) of $10$. Assume the following scientifically grounded and clinically plausible pharmacokinetic base for scaling and decision-making:\n\n- Clearance partitions into hepatic and renal components: total clearance is the sum of a hepatic component and a renal component. Organ impairment scales the corresponding component of clearance proportionally to the degree of function.\n- Renal function scaling is proportional to the ratio $R = CrCl / CrCl_{\\mathrm{norm}}$, where $CrCl_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 100$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ represents a typical normal reference for calculation.\n- Hepatic function scaling uses a hepatic function index $H$ derived from the Child-Pugh score via a linear mapping with a lower bound consistent with severe impairment: $H = 1 - \\alpha (CP - 5)$ with $\\alpha = 0.05$; for the current patient $CP = 10$.\n- For sertraline, the baseline one-compartment pharmacokinetic parameters for a $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ adult are a volume of distribution $V_{S} = 20$ $\\mathrm{L/kg}$, a baseline total clearance $CL_{S,0} = 37$ $\\mathrm{L/h}$, and fractional contributions $f_{S,h} = 0.9$ (hepatic) and $f_{S,r} = 0.1$ (renal).

Lorazepam titration interval, $T_{L}$ [$\\mathrm{h}$]\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing a standard one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with clearance partitioning, which is a fundamental concept in clinical pharmacology. The use of creatinine clearance to scale renal function and a Child-Pugh score-derived index to scale hepatic function are established (though simplified) clinical methodologies. The provided pharmacokinetic parameters for sertraline and lorazepam, as well as the patient's clinical data, are plausible. The fractional clearances for each drug sum to unity ($f_{S,h} + f_{S,r} = 0.9 + 0.1 = 1$; $f_{L,h} + f_{L,r} = 0.85 + 0.15 = 1$), ensuring internal consistency. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided to compute a unique set of answers. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the patient-specific organ function indices. Then, for each drug, the clearance is adjusted based on these indices. The adjusted dose is calculated to maintain the same average steady-state concentration as in a subject with normal organ function. Finally, the titration interval is determined from the drug's adjusted elimination rate constant. All calculations are based on the reference $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ adult body weight, as is standard when a patient's specific weight is not provided.\n\n**1. Calculation of Organ Function Indices**\nThe renal function scaling factor, $R$, is the ratio of the patient's creatinine clearance to a normal reference value.\n$$R = \\frac{CrCl}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{norm}}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ mL/min}}{100 \\text{ mL/min}} = 0.3$$\nThe hepatic function scaling factor, $H$, is derived from the patient's Child-Pugh score.\n$$H = 1 - \\alpha (CP - 5) = 1 - 0.05 (10 - 5) = 1 - 0.05(5) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\n\n**2. Sertraline Calculations**\nFirst, we calculate the adjusted clearance for sertraline ($CL_{S,adj}$). The baseline total clearance ($CL_{S,0}$) is partitioned into baseline hepatic ($CL_{S,h,0}$) and renal ($CL_{S,r,0}$) components.\n$$CL_{S,h,0} = f_{S,h} \\cdot CL_{S,0} = 0.9 \\cdot 37 \\text{ L/h} = 33.3 \\text{ L/h}$$\n$$CL_{S,r,0} = f_{S,r} \\cdot CL_{S,0} = 0.1 \\cdot 37 \\text{ L/h} = 3.7 \\text{ L/h}$$\nThese baseline components are then scaled by the patient's organ function indices, $H$ and $R$, respectively, to find the adjusted clearance.\n$$CL_{S,adj} = H \\cdot CL_{S,h,0} + R \\cdot CL_{S,r,0}$$\n$$CL_{S,adj} = (0.75 \\cdot 33.3 \\text{ L/h}) + (0.3 \\cdot 3.7 \\text{ L/h}) = 24.975 \\text{ L/h} + 1.11 \\text{ L/h} = 26.085 \\text{ L/h}$$\nThe dose adjustment is based on the principle of maintaining the same average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$). Since $C_{ss,avg} \\propto \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{\\text{Clearance}}$, we have $\\frac{D_{S,adj}}{CL_{S,adj}} = \\frac{D_{S,0}}{CL_{S,0}}$. The dosing interval is maintained as once daily.\n$$D_{S} = D_{S,0} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{S,adj}}{CL_{S,0}} = 50 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\frac{26.085 \\text{ L/h}}{37 \\text{ L/h}} = 35.25 \\text{ mg}$$\nSo, the adjusted daily sertraline dose, $D_S$, is $35.25$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sertraline titration interval, $T_S$. This requires the elimination rate constant, $k_{el,S}$. First, we find the volume of distribution for the reference $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ adult.\n$$V_{S,total} = V_S \\cdot 70 \\text{ kg} = 20 \\text{ L/kg} \\cdot 70 \\text{ kg} = 1400 \\text{ L}$$\nThe elimination rate constant is the ratio of the adjusted clearance to the volume of distribution.\n$$k_{el,S} = \\frac{CL_{S,adj}}{V_{S,total}} = \\frac{26.085 \\text{ L/h}}{1400 \\text{ L}} \\approx 0.01863214 \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nThe time $T$ to reach a fraction $F$ of steady state is given by the formula $F = 1 - \\exp(-k_{el} T)$. Solving for $T$:\n$$T = -\\frac{\\ln(1-F)}{k_{el}}$$\nFor sertraline, with $F = 0.95$:\n$$T_S = -\\frac{\\ln(1-0.95)}{k_{el,S}} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{k_{el,S}} \\approx -\\frac{-2.995732}{0.01863214 \\text{ h}^{-1}} \\approx 160.782 \\text{ h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the sertraline titration interval $T_S$ is $160.8$ $\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n**3. Lorazepam Calculations**\nWe follow the same procedure for lorazepam. We calculate the adjusted clearance ($CL_{L,adj}$).\n$$CL_{L,h,0} = f_{L,h} \\cdot CL_{L,0} = 0.85 \\cdot 5.25 \\text{ L/h} = 4.4625 \\text{ L/h}$$\n$$CL_{L,r,0} = f_{L,r} \\cdot CL_{L,0} = 0.15 \\cdot 5.25 \\text{ L/h} = 0.7875 \\text{ L/h}$$\nThe adjusted clearance is:\n$$CL_{L,adj} = H \\cdot CL_{L,h,0} + R \\cdot CL_{L,r,0}$$\n$$CL_{L,adj} = (0.75 \\cdot 4.4625 \\text{ L/h}) + (0.3 \\cdot 0.7875 \\text{ L/h}) = 3.346875 \\text{ L/h} + 0.23625 \\text{ L/h} = 3.583125 \\text{ L/h}$$\nThe adjusted dose per administration, $D_L$, is calculated maintaining the every-$8$-hour schedule.\n$$D_{L} = D_{L,0} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{L,adj}}{CL_{L,0}} = 1 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\frac{3.583125 \\text{ L/h}}{5.25 \\text{ L/h}} = 0.6825 \\text{ mg}$$\nSo, the adjusted per-dose amount for lorazepam, $D_L$, is $0.6825$ $\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the lorazepam titration interval, $T_L$.\n$$V_{L,total} = V_L \\cdot 70 \\text{ kg} = 1.3 \\text{ L/kg} \\cdot 70 \\text{ kg} = 91 \\text{ L}$$\n$$k_{el,L} = \\frac{CL_{L,adj}}{V_{L,total}} = \\frac{3.583125 \\text{ L/h}}{91 \\text{ L}} = 0.039375 \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nUsing the same formula for the titration interval with $F = 0.95$:\n$$T_L = -\\frac{\\ln(1-0.95)}{k_{el,L}} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{k_{el,L}} \\approx -\\frac{-2.995732}{0.039375 \\text{ h}^{-1}} \\approx 76.0820 \\text{ h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the lorazepam titration interval $T_L$ is $76.08$ $\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\nThe four requested values are:\n1.  $D_{S} = 35.25$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$\n2.  $T_{S} = 160.8$ $\\mathrm{h}$\n3.  $D_{L} = 0.6825$ $\\mathrm{mg}$\n4.  $T_{L} = 76.08$ $\\mathrm{h}$\n\nThese values are presented in the requested order $(D_S, T_S, D_L, T_L)$.",
