            "introduction": "A fundamental skill in child and adolescent psychiatry is the interpretation of physical growth data, which is often a critical window into a patient's overall health. This first practice grounds you in a common clinical calculation—the Body Mass Index ($BMI$) and its standardized $z$-score—but more importantly, challenges you to think beyond a single data point. By contrasting a cross-sectional measurement with the principles of longitudinal assessment, you will develop a deeper appreciation for why growth trajectory and velocity are indispensable for accurate diagnosis and risk assessment, particularly in the context of suspected eating disorders .",

            "problem": "A $12$-year-old boy presents for evaluation in the context of suspected restrictive eating. You are provided his current anthropometric measurements: height $H = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $W = 60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Starting from fundamental definitions used in pediatric growth assessment, compute the Body Mass Index (BMI) and then standardize it relative to an age- and sex-specific reference. Specifically, use the definition $BMI = \\frac{W}{H^{2}}$ where $H$ is in $\\mathrm{m}$ and $W$ is in $\\mathrm{kg}$. For standardization, assume an approximate World Health Organization (WHO) reference distribution for $12$-year-old boys in which BMI is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$, and compute the $z$-score $z = \\frac{BMI - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. \n\nRound the BMI to four significant figures and the $z$-score to three significant figures. Express the BMI in $\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$. After completing the calculations, provide a first-principles explanation of why growth trajectory and velocity are critical to interpret risk in pediatric eating assessments, contrasting a single cross-sectional BMI with longitudinal indicators such as centile crossing, height velocity, and weight suppression. Your final numeric answer should include the BMI and the $z$-score.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It presents a standard clinical calculation followed by a request for a conceptual explanation based on fundamental principles of developmental biology and biostatistics.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the calculation of the Body Mass Index (BMI) and its corresponding $z$-score.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Height, $H = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Weight, $W = 60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Mean BMI for the reference population, $\\mu = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$\n- Standard deviation of BMI for the reference population, $\\sigma = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$\n\nThe definition of BMI is given as $BMI = \\frac{W}{H^{2}}$, with $W$ in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) and $H$ in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nFirst, we must convert the height from centimeters to meters.\n$$H = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}{100\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the BMI.\n$$BMI = \\frac{W}{H^{2}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{(1.50\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2}} = \\frac{60}{2.25}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$$\n$$BMI = 26.666... \\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the BMI to four significant figures.\n$$BMI \\approx 26.67\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the $z$-score, which standardizes the individual's BMI against the age- and sex-specific reference population. The formula is given as $z = \\frac{BMI - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. For maximum accuracy, the unrounded BMI value should be used in this calculation.\n$$z = \\frac{26.666... - 20.0}{3.0} = \\frac{6.666...}{3.0}$$\n$$z = 2.222...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the $z$-score to three significant figures.\n$$z \\approx 2.22$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a first-principles explanation of the importance of growth trajectory and velocity in pediatric eating assessments, contrasting a single cross-sectional BMI with longitudinal indicators.\n\nA single, cross-sectional BMI measurement, such as the one calculated above ($26.67\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$), provides a static snapshot of a child's size relative to a reference population at a single point in time. The calculated $z$-score of $+2.22$ indicates that the boy's BMI is $2.22$ standard deviations above the mean for his age and sex, which is a statistically significant deviation. However, this single data point is fundamentally insufficient for a meaningful clinical interpretation, particularly in the context of a suspected eating disorder. Its limitation stems from the fact that growth is an inherently dynamic process, defined by its rate of change over time (velocity).\n\nFrom first principles, an organism's physiological state is a function of time, and its health is often better characterized by the time-derivatives of its state variables (e.g., velocity, acceleration) than by the instantaneous values of those variables. In pediatrics, this principle is paramount.\n\nLongitudinal indicators provide this crucial dynamic context:\n\n1.  **Growth Trajectory and Centile Crossing:** Healthy children tend to follow a consistent growth channel, or centile, on standardized growth charts. This represents a stable growth trajectory. A deviation from this trajectory, known as centile crossing, is a highly sensitive indicator of an underlying physiological disturbance.\n    - If the boy has consistently tracked along the $98^{th}$ centile for BMI (a $z$-score of approximately $+2$), his current measurement may reflect a stable, constitutional pattern of being large.\n    - Conversely, if he was previously at the $50^{th}$ centile ($z=0$) and has rapidly crossed upwards to a $z$-score of $+2.22$, this indicates acute, excessive weight gain, a significant concern for metabolic health.\n    - Most critically in the context of restrictive eating, a child who was previously at a very high centile (e.g., $>99^{th}$) and has crossed *downwards* to the current measurement is showing a significant deceleration in weight gain or even weight loss. A clinician looking only at the \"high\" BMI of $26.67$ might be falsely reassured, whereas the negative velocity is the actual red flag for a developing eating disorder. The single data point lacks the vector information (magnitude and direction of change) that is essential for diagnosis.\n\n2.  **Height Velocity:** The rate of linear growth is a robust indicator of long-term nutritional status and general health. Chronic malnutrition, as seen in restrictive eating disorders, impairs the endocrine axes (e.g., growth hormone/IGF-1) responsible for skeletal growth. A slowing of height velocity is a cardinal sign of chronic energy deficit. Assessing this requires at least two height measurements over time. A single measurement provides no information about velocity.\n\n3.  **Weight Suppression:** This concept refers to the difference between an individual's highest lifetime weight and their current weight. A person can have a statistically \"normal\" or even \"high\" BMI but be in a state of physiological starvation if their current weight is significantly below their body's previously established set point. For instance, if this boy's highest weight was $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and he lost $10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ through restriction, his current BMI of $26.67$ completely masks a state of severe energy deficit to which his body is reacting with compensatory metabolic and psychological changes. Weight suppression is a powerful predictor of the medical and psychological severity of an eating disorder, yet it is completely invisible in a cross-sectional assessment.\n\nIn summary, a single BMI measurement is a scalar quantity providing only magnitude relative to a population. Longitudinal data on growth provides a vector, indicating both magnitude and direction of change over time. In assessing a dynamic biological process like growth, particularly when pathology is suspected, this temporal, high-derivative information is not merely supplementary but fundamental to a correct diagnosis and risk assessment.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability of ADHD given two independent positive test results, starting from a known pre-test probability (base rate). This is a direct application of Bayesian inference. The most efficient method uses the odds-and-likelihood-ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the child has ADHD, and $D^C$ denote the event that the child does not have ADHD.\nLet $T_p^+$ be the event of a positive parent rating scale, and $T_t^+$ be the event of a positive teacher rating scale.\n\nWe are given:\n- The pre-test probability, or prevalence: $P(D) = 10\\% = 0.1$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for the parent scale: $LR_p^+ = 3.0$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for the teacher scale: $LR_t^+ = 2.0$.\n- The tests are conditionally independent given the true ADHD status.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Pre-Test Probability to Pre-Test Odds**\nThe odds of an event are the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n$$\n\\text{Pre-test Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^C)} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given prevalence:\n$$\n\\text{Pre-test Odds} = \\frac{0.1}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Combined Likelihood Ratio for the New Evidence**\nThe likelihood ratio form of Bayes' theorem states that the post-test odds are the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the evidence.\n$$\n\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\text{Pre-test Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}\n$$\nFor multiple pieces of conditionally independent evidence, the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios.
