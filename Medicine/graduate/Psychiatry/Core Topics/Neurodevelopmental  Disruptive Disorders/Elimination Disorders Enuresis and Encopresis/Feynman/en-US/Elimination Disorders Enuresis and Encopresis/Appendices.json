While anorectal manometry is a key test for excluding Hirschsprung disease, its results are not absolute. This exercise  demonstrates how to use Bayesian principles to quantify the impact of a negative test result on your clinical suspicion, a core skill in evidence-based diagnostic reasoning.",

            "problem": "A child with chronic retentive fecal incontinence consistent with encopresis presents for evaluation to exclude Hirschsprung disease, a structural cause that must be ruled out in the assessment of elimination disorders. Anorectal manometry is performed to assess the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR). Define the diagnostic test as follows: a test is considered positive when the RAIR is absent (consistent with Hirschsprung disease) and negative when the RAIR is present (physiologic relaxation).\n\nSuppose the clinician estimates a pretest probability of Hirschsprung disease of $0.05$ for this patient. The anorectal manometry test has sensitivity $Se = 0.95$ and specificity $Sp = 0.90$ for detecting Hirschsprung disease under the above positive/negative convention. The test result in this patient is negative (RAIR present).\n\nCompute the posterior probability of Hirschsprung disease given the negative test result using only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability. Express your final answer as a single simplified fraction (no percentage sign and no units). Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in Bayesian inference applied to medical diagnostics, with all necessary data provided. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the child has Hirschsprung disease, and let $\\text{~}D$ denote the event that the child does not have the disease. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result (rectoanal inhibitory reflex, RAIR, is absent) and $T-$ denote a negative test result (RAIR is present).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability of Hirschsprung disease is $P(D) = 0.05$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is $Se = P(T+ | D) = 0.95$.\nThe specificity of the test is $Sp = P(T- | \\text{~}D) = 0.90$.\n\nThe observed event is a negative test result, $T-$. We are asked to compute the posterior probability of Hirschsprung disease given this negative test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T-)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$P(D | T-) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T-)}{P(T-)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T-)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing negative, and $P(T-)$ is the total probability of testing negative.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(D \\cap T-)$. We can express this joint probability using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T- | D)$:\n$$P(T- | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T-)}{P(D)}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T-) = P(T- | D) \\times P(D)$$\nThe term $P(T- | D)$ is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present. This is the complement of the sensitivity, $P(T+ | D)$.\n$$P(T- | D) = 1 - P(T+ | D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\nNow we can compute the numerator:\n$$P(D \\cap T-) = (0.05) \\times (0.05) = 0.0025$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T-)$. By the law of total probability, the event $T-$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: testing negative with the disease and testing negative without the disease.\n$$P(T-) = P(T- \\cap D) + P(T- \\cap \\text{~}D)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term: $P(T- \\cap D) = 0.0025$.\nThe second term, $P(T- \\cap \\text{~}D)$, can be found using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T- | \\text{~}D)$:\n$$P(T- \\cap \\text{~}D) = P(T- | \\text{~}D) \\times P(\\text{~}D)$$\nWe are given the specificity, $P(T- | \\text{~}D) = Sp = 0.90$.\nThe probability of not having the disease, $P(\\text{~}D)$, is the complement of the pretest probability $P(D)$:\n$$P(\\text{~}D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\nNow we can compute the second term for the denominator:\n$$P(T- \\cap \\text{~}D) = (0.90) \\times (0.95) = 0.855$$\nThe total probability of a negative test is the sum of the two terms:\n$$P(T-) = 0.0025 + 0.855 = 0.8575$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the posterior probability $P(D | T-)$ by substituting the numerator and denominator into our initial formula:\n$$P(D | T-) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T-)}{P(T-)} = \\frac{0.0025}{0.8575}$$\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $10000$ to remove the decimals:\n$$P(D | T-) = \\frac{25}{8575}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by $25$.\n$$25 \\div 25 = 1$$\n$$8575 \\div 25 = 343$$\nNote that $343 = 7^3$. Since the numerator is $1$, the fraction is fully simplified.\nTherefore, the posterior probability of Hirschsprung disease given a negative test result is $\\frac{1}{343}$.",
