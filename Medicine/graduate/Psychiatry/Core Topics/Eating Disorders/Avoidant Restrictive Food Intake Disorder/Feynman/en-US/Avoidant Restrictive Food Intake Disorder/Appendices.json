            "introduction": "Mastering the differential diagnosis of eating disorders is a cornerstone of clinical psychiatry. This first exercise challenges you to apply DSM-5-TR criteria to a complex case where food avoidance co-occurs with self-induced vomiting, a presentation that requires careful distinction between ARFID, bulimia nervosa, and other conditions . Accurately identifying the underlying driver of the behavior—whether it is fear of aversive consequences or body image disturbance—is critical for guiding appropriate and effective treatment.",

            "problem": "A patient assigned female at birth, age $16$, presents with an $8$-month history of postprandial epigastric discomfort and bloating. Over this interval, she has progressively limited her diet to a narrow set of “safe” foods and markedly reduced portion sizes. She reports that she often avoids eating at school or with peers due to fear that eating will precipitate severe abdominal pain and vomiting. On many occasions after meals, she deliberately induces vomiting with her fingers to “empty the stomach” and preempt anticipated pain. She denies episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food accompanied by loss of control, and she denies fear of weight gain, drive for thinness, or body-image dissatisfaction. Body mass index (BMI) is $21.3 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ (approximately $55$th percentile for age), and weight has been stable over the past $6$ months. Laboratory evaluation shows ferritin $9 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$ (low) with hemoglobin $11.2 \\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$ and mean corpuscular volume $78 \\ \\mathrm{fL}$, consistent with mild iron deficiency. Comprehensive metabolic panel, celiac serologies, Helicobacter pylori testing, abdominal ultrasound, and upper endoscopy with biopsies are unremarkable. She reports significant psychosocial interference: she skips family dinners, no longer participates in team lunches, and spends extensive time planning around meals. There is no history of trauma. She is not taking laxatives, diuretics, or stimulants. There is no substance use.\n\nUsing foundational diagnostic definitions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and the Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ criteria for disorders of gut–brain interaction, identify the single best-fitting diagnosis among the following and the deciding features that most critically support it in this case.\n\nA. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aversive-consequence subtype; key features are avoidance and restriction driven by fear of aversive gastrointestinal consequences (pain/vomiting), absence of weight/shape overvaluation, restricted dietary variety with associated nutritional deficiency and marked psychosocial interference despite normal BMI.\n\nB. Rumination disorder; key features are recurrent regurgitation of food with normal gastrointestinal work-up, absence of weight/shape concerns, and postprandial expulsion of ingested material.\n\nC. Functional gastrointestinal disorder (functional dyspepsia); key features are chronic epigastric pain with normal evaluation, with eating behaviors secondary to visceral hypersensitivity, making a primary psychiatric eating diagnosis unwarranted.\n\nD. Bulimia nervosa, purging type; key features are recurrent self-induced vomiting after eating consistent with purging behaviors, irrespective of BMI and stated motives.\n\nE. Specific phobia (vomiting), primary; key features are intense fear of vomiting leading to avoidance of eating, where the phobic process—not an eating or feeding disturbance—is primary, and nutritional compromise does not direct the diagnosis.",
            "solution": "The analysis must be grounded in core definitions from DSM-5-TR for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), rumination disorder, and bulimia nervosa, and from Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ for functional gastrointestinal disorders. The essential, widely accepted foundations are as follows:\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines ARFID as an eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food, or concern about aversive consequences of eating) that is associated with persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs, manifested by at least one of the following: significant weight loss or failure to achieve expected weight gain; significant nutritional deficiency; dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements; or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food, culturally sanctioned practice, and does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced. ARFID can be specified by the maintaining mechanism, including avoidance due to fear of aversive consequences (e.g., choking, vomiting, abdominal pain).\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines rumination disorder as repeated regurgitation of food, which may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out, occurring over a period of at least $1$ month, not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition, not occurring exclusively during anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and if occurring within the context of another mental disorder, severe enough to warrant additional clinical attention. Phenomenologically, the regurgitation is typically effortless, not preceded by nausea or retching, and often occurs within minutes of a meal.\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating, in a discrete period, an amount of food larger than what most would eat under similar circumstances, accompanied by a sense of lack of control) and recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting), occurring on average at least once weekly for $3$ months, with self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight. BMI is often in the normal range, but the core features include overvaluation of shape/weight and binge eating.\n\n- Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ functional gastrointestinal disorders (disorders of gut–brain interaction) such as functional dyspepsia require chronic symptom patterns (e.g., epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness) without structural disease explaining symptoms. These diagnoses are clinical and can coexist with psychiatric conditions; however, when a primary feeding/eating disturbance drives nutritional deficiency or psychosocial impairment independent of structural gastrointestinal pathology, an eating disorder diagnosis may better capture the primary syndrome.\n\nApply these principles to the case. The patient has:\n- Avoidance/restriction of intake with markedly reduced dietary variety and context avoidance (school meals, social eating) driven by fear that eating causes severe pain/vomiting.\n- Absence of weight/shape concerns, no binge eating, no drive for thinness.\n- Measurable consequences of undernutrition: iron deficiency (ferritin $9 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$, microcytosis, mild anemia), and marked psychosocial interference.\n- Normal BMI $21.3 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ and stable weight, which does not exclude ARFID when nutritional deficiency or psychosocial interference criteria are met.\n- Self-induced vomiting is used as a safety behavior to preempt pain rather than as a weight-control method.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aversive-consequence subtype. The decisive features align with DSM-5-TR: the feeding disturbance is driven by fear of aversive consequences of eating (anticipated pain/vomiting), there is no overvaluation of weight/shape, and there are clinically significant consequences in the form of a significant nutritional deficiency (iron deficiency) and marked psychosocial interference. Normal BMI does not negate ARFID, as the criteria can be met via nutritional deficiency or psychosocial impairment even without weight loss. The pattern of self-induced vomiting as a safety behavior to avoid perceived gastrointestinal pain is compatible with the aversive-consequence maintaining mechanism within ARFID. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Rumination disorder. Although there is postprandial expulsion of gastric contents, the phenomenology here is self-induced vomiting using digital stimulation to proactively “empty the stomach,” not effortless regurgitation with re-chewing or re-swallowing. Moreover, DSM-5-TR requires that rumination disorder not be better explained by another eating disorder; in this case, the broader syndrome of avoidance/restriction with nutritional deficiency and psychosocial impairment, driven by fear of aversive consequences, is more parsimoniously explained by ARFID. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Functional gastrointestinal disorder (functional dyspepsia). The patient does meet elements of functional dyspepsia (epigastric pain and normal evaluations), yet the core clinical problem extends beyond symptom perception to a feeding/eating disturbance producing nutritional deficiency and psychosocial impairment, with avoidance maintained by fear of aversive consequences. When a primary feeding disorder explains the behavioral pattern and consequences, DSM-5-TR ARFID is the superior primary diagnosis; functional gastrointestinal pathology may be a comorbidity or antecedent trigger but does not subsume the full syndrome. The deciding features in this option omit the central absence of weight/shape concerns and the diagnostic threshold reached via nutritional deficiency and psychosocial interference. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Bulimia nervosa, purging type. Self-induced vomiting occurs, but there are no binge-eating episodes with loss of control and no overvaluation of weight/shape, both of which are required for bulimia nervosa. The motive for vomiting is to avert pain, not to influence weight/shape. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Specific phobia (vomiting), primary. Fear of vomiting (emetophobia) can drive avoidance; however, DSM-5-TR indicates that when the disturbance is characterized by avoidant/restrictive eating with nutritional and psychosocial consequences, ARFID provides a more accurate primary diagnosis, with a fear of aversive consequences being the maintaining mechanism. The presence of nutritional deficiency and a structured feeding disturbance favors ARFID over a primary specific phobia diagnosis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best-fitting diagnosis and deciding features are captured by option A.",

This exercise will sharpen your ability to determine when selective eating patterns cross the line from a behavioral trait into a clinically significant disorder requiring intervention.",

            "problem": "A $9$-year-old boy with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents for evaluation of selective eating. Since toddlerhood he has demonstrated sensory defensiveness to textures and smells. His current intake consists of approximately $10$ to $12$ commonly available “beige” foods (for example, plain pasta, specific chicken nuggets, crackers, yogurt), and he consistently refuses most fruits and vegetables. He eats with his family, requires some advance planning for acceptable foods, and occasionally gags on new textures but does not vomit. He denies fear of weight gain or body image concerns. There is no history of bingeing, purging, laxative use, or excessive exercise.\n\nGrowth records show that since age $5$ his weight and height have tracked between the $40$th and $55$th percentiles with a stable body mass index percentile near the $50$th percentile. Over the past year, his measured height velocity was $5.5$ cm/year, within expected norms for prepubertal children (typical range approximately $4$ to $6$ cm/year). A $3$-day dietary recall suggests adequate energy intake for age and activity level. A complete blood count and basic micronutrient panel are within laboratory reference intervals. He does not require enteral feeding. He intermittently takes an over-the-counter children’s multivitamin but no prescribed nutritional supplements, and missed doses do not change his appetite or energy. He attends school lunch, birthday parties, and sleepovers, bringing preferred foods when needed, and reports no distress or avoidance of social eating. Parents report the need to shop for specific brands and occasional mealtime negotiations but no school refusal, social withdrawal, or conflict severe enough to limit activities.\n\nAs a foundational base, use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) definition of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID): an eating or feeding disturbance (for example, apparent lack of interest in eating, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food, concern about aversive consequences of eating) associated with persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs, as evidenced by one or more of the following: significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children), significant nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or culturally sanctioned practice, does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced. If the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition (for example, Autism Spectrum Disorder), the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition and warrants additional clinical attention.\n\nBased on this base and the clinical details provided, which option best justifies whether ARFID criteria are met in this case?\n\nA. Criteria for ARFID are met because sensory-based food selectivity alone satisfies the feeding disturbance requirement, even without weight loss, nutritional deficiency, supplement dependence, or psychosocial interference.\n\nB. Criteria for ARFID are not met because, although a feeding disturbance is present, there is no demonstrated failure to meet nutritional and/or energy needs (no faltering growth, no nutritional deficiency, no dependence on enteral feeding or prescribed oral supplements, and no marked psychosocial interference), and the severity does not exceed what can be routinely associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n\nC. Criteria for ARFID are met because parental inconvenience and mealtime negotiations constitute marked psychosocial interference, even though the child’s growth, laboratory values, and social participation are within expected limits.\n\nD. Criteria for ARFID are automatically met in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) when sensory defensiveness drives food selectivity, because the differential diagnosis excludes ASD as an explanatory factor.\n\nE. Criteria for ARFID can never be applied in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) because the eating disturbance is attributable to autism and therefore excluded by definition.",
            "solution": "Begin with the DSM-5-TR framework for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). The core requirement is an eating or feeding disturbance, such as avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food. However, the diagnosis is not made on the presence of selectivity alone; it requires persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs as evidenced by at least one of the following: significant weight loss or faltering growth in children, significant nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. Exclusions include that the disturbance is not explained by lack of food or cultural practice, does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and is not associated with disturbances in body image. When the disturbance occurs in the context of another condition, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the eating disturbance must be more severe than is routinely associated with that condition and must warrant additional clinical attention.\n\nApply these principles to this case:\n\n1. Feeding disturbance: The child clearly exhibits a feeding disturbance characterized by avoidance based on sensory characteristics (limited to approximately $10$ to $12$ foods, refusal of many textures). This satisfies the disturbance component.\n\n2. Associated impairment thresholds:\n   - Significant weight loss or faltering growth: Growth has tracked consistently around mid-percentiles since age $5$, with a height velocity of $5.5$ cm/year in the past year, which lies within the expected prepubertal range of approximately $4$ to $6$ cm/year. There is no evidence of weight loss or faltering growth.\n   - Significant nutritional deficiency: Laboratory studies are within reference intervals, and dietary recall suggests adequate energy; there is no demonstrated nutritional deficiency.\n   - Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements: The child does not require enteral feeds. Intermittent use of a nonprescription multivitamin, without any impact from missed doses, does not constitute clinical dependence on oral nutritional supplements to maintain nutritional adequacy.\n   - Marked interference with psychosocial functioning: The child participates in school lunch, birthdays, and sleepovers without avoidance; bringing preferred foods allows participation without distress. Parental meal planning and occasional negotiations, while burdensome, are not described as causing marked interference in the child’s psychosocial functioning (for example, there is no school refusal, avoidance of social eating, or significant functional limitation).\n\n3. Exclusions and context of ASD: There is no evidence of body image concerns or eating disorder cognitions. In the context of ASD, sensory-based selectivity is common. To diagnose ARFID in ASD, the severity of the eating disturbance must exceed what is routinely associated with ASD and produce one of the impairment thresholds above. Here, those thresholds are not met.\n\nTherefore, although a feeding disturbance exists, the required impairment criteria are not satisfied. The appropriate conclusion is that ARFID criteria are not currently met; this presentation is best conceptualized as sensory-based feeding difficulty in the context of ASD, warranting monitoring and possibly supportive intervention, with reconsideration of ARFID if impairment emerges (for example, nutritional deficiency, growth faltering, dependence on supplements, or marked psychosocial interference).\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- A. This option asserts that sensory selectivity alone is sufficient. This misapplies DSM-5-TR, which requires evidence of failure to meet nutritional and/or energy needs via at least one impairment threshold. In this case, none is met. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- B. This option correctly applies the impairment threshold logic. The child has a feeding disturbance but no faltering growth, no nutritional deficiency, no supplement or enteral dependence, and no marked psychosocial interference. Furthermore, in ASD the disturbance must exceed routine ASD-associated selectivity; it does not here. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- C. This option elevates caregiver inconvenience to “marked psychosocial interference.” DSM-5-TR’s marked interference pertains to the individual’s psychosocial functioning (for example, avoidance of social eating, school impairment), which is explicitly absent. While family burden is relevant clinically, it does not alone meet the threshold as described in the vignette. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- D. This option claims an automatic ARFID diagnosis in ASD with sensory selectivity. DSM-5-TR specifies the opposite: when occurring with another condition, the severity must exceed what is routinely associated and meet an impairment threshold. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- E. This option states ARFID cannot be diagnosed in ASD. That is false; ARFID can be diagnosed in ASD when the eating disturbance is more severe than expected for ASD and meets impairment thresholds. Verdict: Incorrect.",

The solution involves a multi-step calculation using the provided Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) model to relate $z$-scores to BMI, and subsequently to body weight, followed by an application of an energy-to-weight conversion heuristic.\n\nFirst, we establish the given parameters:\n- Baseline $z$-score, $z_0 = -1.8$\n- Target $z$-score, $z_f = -0.5$\n- Time period, $\\Delta t = 12$ weeks\n- Constant height, $H = 1.55 \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n- LMS parameters: $L = -2.0$, $M = 19.2 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, $S = 0.10$\n- Energy conversion factor, $C = 7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$\n\nThe relationship between BMI and the $z$-score is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI}(z) = M(1 + L S z)^{1/L}\n$$\nWe will use this formula to calculate the BMI at baseline ($\\mathrm{BMI}_0$) and at the target ($\\mathrm{BMI}_f$).\n\nThe product $L S$ is calculated as:\n$$\nL S = (-2.0)(0.10) = -0.20\n$$\nThe exponent is $1/L = 1/(-2.0) = -0.5$.\n\nNow, we calculate the baseline BMI, $\\mathrm{BMI}_0$, corresponding to $z_0 = -1.8$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI}_0 = 19.2 \\left(1 + (-0.20)(-1.8)\\right)^{-0.5} = 19.2 \\left(1 + 0.36\\right)^{-0.5} = 19.2 \\left(1.36\\right)^{-0.5}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI}_0 = \\frac{19.2}{\\sqrt{1.36}} \\approx 16.4639 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the target BMI, $\\mathrm{BMI}_f$, corresponding to $z_f = -0.5$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI}_f = 19.2 \\left(1 + (-0.20)(-0.5)\\right)^{-0.5} = 19.2 \\left(1 + 0.10\\right)^{-0.5} = 19.2 \\left(1.10\\right)^{-0.5}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI}_f = \\frac{19.2}{\\sqrt{1.10}} \\approx 18.3065 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2}\n$$\n\nWith the BMI values determined, we can find the corresponding body weights using the formula $\\mathrm{BMI} = \\frac{W}{H^2}$, which we rearrange to $W = \\mathrm{BMI} \\times H^2$. The height squared is $H^2 = (1.55 \\, \\mathrm{m})^2 = 2.4025 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nThe baseline weight, $W_0$, is:\n$$\nW_0 = \\mathrm{BMI}_0 \\times H^2 \\approx 16.4639 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2} \\times 2.4025 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 39.5546 \\, \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\n\nThe target weight, $W_f$, is:\n$$\nW_f = \\mathrm{BMI}_f \\times H^2 \\approx 18.3065 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2} \\times 2.4025 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 43.9800 \\, \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\n\nThe total weight gain required, $\\Delta W$, is the difference between the target and baseline weights:\n$$\n\\Delta W = W_f - W_0 \\approx 43.9800 \\, \\mathrm{kg} - 39.5546 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 4.4254 \\, \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\n\nTo find the total energy surplus, $\\Delta E_{\\text{total}}$, required to achieve this weight gain, we use the given conversion factor $C = 7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta W \\times C \\approx 4.4254 \\, \\mathrm{kg} \\times 7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg} \\approx 34075.6 \\, \\mathrm{kcal}\n$$\n\nThis total energy surplus must be achieved over a period of $\\Delta t = 12$ weeks.

However, in nutritional rehabilitation of an underweight child, the goal is to restore both fat mass and, crucially, fat-free mass (muscle, bone, and organ tissue). Fat-free mass has a much lower energy density (approximately $1800 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$) due to its high water content. Therefore, the actual energy cost per kilogram of healthy weight gain is typically lower than $7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal}$, as the gained weight is a composite of different tissues. Using this heuristic overestimates the required energy surplus for tissue deposition.\n\n2.  **Metabolic Adaptation**: Malnutrition leads to a downregulation of basal metabolic rate (BMR) as an energy-conserving mechanism. During refeeding, as nutritional status improves, the BMR increases. This means a portion of the increased energy intake is expended to fuel this rise in metabolism, rather than being stored as new tissue. The fixed heuristic does not account for this dynamic metabolic cost, which can be substantial during active rehabilitation.\n\n3.  **Energy Cost of Growth**: The patient is a $12$-year-old male, an age typically associated with the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. An energy surplus is required not only for \"catch-up\" weight gain but also to fuel normal linear growth and development. The problem simplifies this by assuming constant height, but in a real-world clinical scenario, the energy demands of growth are an essential component of total energy requirements and are not captured by a simple weight-gain heuristic.\n\nIn summary, while the $7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$ heuristic provides a rudimentary estimate, a precise clinical nutrition plan would require a more sophisticated approach that accounts for the composition of gained weight, metabolic changes, and the energy demands of normal growth.",
