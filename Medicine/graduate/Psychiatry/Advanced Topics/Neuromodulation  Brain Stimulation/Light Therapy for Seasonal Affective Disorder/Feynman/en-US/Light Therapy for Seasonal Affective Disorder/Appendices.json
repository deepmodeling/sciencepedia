            "introduction": "Effective light therapy begins with delivering the correct dose of light, a concept governed by fundamental physics. This first practice applies the inverse-square law, a foundational principle describing how light intensity diminishes with distance, to calculate the proper patient positioning for a desired therapeutic illuminance. Mastering this calculation provides a critical first approximation for clinical setup, while also highlighting the important distinction between a simple physical model and the complexities of real-world extended light sources.",

            "problem": "A clinician is configuring bright light therapy for a patient with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). A rectangular light box with luminous aperture dimensions of $0.20$ m by $0.30$ m is specified by the manufacturer to deliver an illuminance of $10{,}000$ lux at the corneal plane when the patient is positioned at a viewing distance of $30$ cm along the central axis. The clinician wishes to reposition the patient such that the corneal illuminance is $2{,}500$ lux while maintaining the same on-axis alignment and orientation. Assume that, in the far-field limit for a point-like emitter, illuminance diminishes in proportion to the inverse square of distance. Recognizing that the device is an extended source and that near-field behavior can deviate from the point-source model, compute the distance (on-axis) at which the point-source inverse-square approximation predicts an illuminance of $2{,}500$ lux, starting from the given reference point. Express your final answer in centimeters. Your reasoning should start from the fundamental geometric spreading principle for a point source and conclude with the computed distance, while noting qualitatively how the extended-source nature of the light box would be expected to bias this estimate in the near-field. The final numerical answer must be a single value in centimeters.",
            "solution": "The governing principle for this calculation is the inverse-square law for illuminance from a point source. This model is specified in the problem statement as the basis for the calculation. It posits that the illuminance, $E$, at a distance, $d$, from a point source is inversely proportional to the square of that distance. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$E \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nThis relationship can be written as an equation involving a constant of proportionality, $k$, which is determined by the luminous intensity of the source along the measurement axis:\n$$E = \\frac{k}{d^2}$$\nWe are given an initial reference condition (state $1$) and a target condition (state $2$):\nState $1$: Illuminance $E_1 = 10{,}000$ lux at a distance $d_1 = 30$ cm.\nState $2$: Illuminance $E_2 = 2{,}500$ lux at an unknown distance $d_2$.\n\nUsing the model, we can write an equation for each state:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{k}{d_1^2}$$\n$$E_2 = \\frac{k}{d_2^2}$$\nTo find the unknown distance $d_2$, we can form a ratio of the two equations. This procedure eliminates the source-dependent constant $k$:\n$$\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\frac{k/d_2^2}{k/d_1^2} = \\frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2}$$\nSolving for $d_2$:\n$$d_2^2 = d_1^2 \\left( \\frac{E_1}{E_2} \\right)$$\n$$d_2 = d_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{E_1}{E_2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $d_1 = 30$ cm, $E_1 = 10{,}000$ lux, and $E_2 = 2{,}500$ lux.\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\sqrt{\\frac{10{,}000}{2{,}500}}$$\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\sqrt{4}$$\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times 2$$\n$$d_2 = 60 \\, \\text{cm}$$\nAccording to the point-source approximation, the required distance is $60$ cm.\n\nIt is crucial to consider the limitation of this model, as requested. The physical light box is an extended source with dimensions of $0.20 \\, \\text{m}$ by $0.30 \\, \\text{m}$. The inverse-square law is an accurate approximation only in the far-field region, where the distance from the source is much larger than the characteristic dimensions of the source itself. The initial measurement distance, $d_1 = 30 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.30 \\, \\text{m}$, is of the same order of magnitude as the source dimensions. This indicates that the measurement points lie within the near-field or intermediate-field regions.\n\nIn these regions, the illuminance from a planar extended source decreases with distance more slowly than the $d^{-2}$ relationship predicted by the point-source model. To achieve the same factor-of-four reduction in illuminance (from $10{,}000$ lux to $2{,}500$ lux), the patient must be moved to a distance greater than that predicted by the inverse-square law, which models a steeper-than-actual decline in illuminance. Therefore, the calculated value of $60$ cm represents an **underestimate** of the true physical distance required. The actual distance would be greater than $60$ cm.",

            "introduction": "While photopic illuminance, measured in $lux$, describes brightness as perceived by the human eye, it doesn't fully capture a light source's impact on our internal circadian clock. This exercise delves into the neurobiology of light perception, introducing the concept of melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (EDI) to quantify the true circadian stimulus. By calculating EDI, you will learn to assess a light's biological potency, a crucial step in selecting the most effective therapeutic devices beyond their apparent brightness.",

            "problem": "A patient with recurrent winter-onset major depressive episodes consistent with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is prescribed morning bright-light therapy using a clinical light box. The device delivers a corneal photopic illuminance of $10{,}000$ lux while emitting a spectrum tuned for intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) activation via melanopsin, which peaks near $480\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The purpose is to quantify the melanopic stimulus in a manner comparable across spectra, using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system for melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (EDI).\n\nStarting from the following foundational definitions and principles:\n- Photopic illuminance $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$ is obtained by spectral weighting of the corneal spectral irradiance $E_{\\lambda}$ by the photopic luminous efficiency function $V(\\lambda)$ and a scaling constant $K_{\\mathrm{m}}$, acknowledging the linearity of spectral integrations over wavelength.\n- Melanopic stimulus for a given source is computed by weighting $E_{\\lambda}$ with the standardized melanopic sensitivity function $\\bar{m}(\\lambda)$ and an associated constant chosen such that the quantity is comparable across spectra when normalized to the CIE Standard Daylight (D65) reference.\n- Melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ is defined as the photopic illuminance of a D65 daylight that would produce the same melanopic weighted stimulus as the test source.\n- The melanopic-to-photopic ratio $r$ for a test source is defined as the ratio of its melanopic weighted quantity to its photopic illuminance, both computed at the cornea under the same spectral power distribution.\n\nGiven a light box whose melanopic-to-photopic ratio is $r = 0.9$ and whose corneal photopic illuminance is $E_{\\mathrm{v}} = 10{,}000$ lux, derive from the above principles an expression for $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ in terms of $r$ and $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$, and then compute the numerical value for this device.\n\nExpress your final answer in lux, and round to four significant figures. The final reported quantity must be the melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance at the cornea corresponding to this light exposure.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance, denoted as $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$, in terms of the corneal photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$, and the melanopic-to-photopic ratio, $r$. Subsequently, the numerical value for $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ must be calculated based on the provided data.\n\nThe derivation will proceed by formalizing the principles given in the problem statement.\n\nLet the test light source be denoted by the subscript 'source', and the reference CIE Standard Daylight D65 be denoted by 'D65'. The spectral irradiance of a source is given by $E_{\\lambda}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\n**Principle 1: Photopic Illuminance**\nThe photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$, for any source is defined as the spectral irradiance weighted by the photopic luminous efficiency function $V(\\lambda)$ and scaled by a constant $K_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 683 \\, \\mathrm{lm/W}$.\nFor the test source, the given photopic illuminance is $E_{\\mathrm{v}} = 10,000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$.\n\n**Principle 2 & 3: Melanopic Stimulus and Melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance ($E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$)**\nThe melanopic stimulus for a source is calculated by weighting its spectral irradiance $E_{\\lambda}$ with the melanopic sensitivity function $\\bar{m}(\\lambda)$. Let the unscaled melanopic stimulus (melanopic irradiance) be $M_{e} = \\int E_{\\lambda}(\\lambda) \\bar{m}(\\lambda) d\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem states that $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ is the photopic illuminance of a D65 source that produces the same melanopic stimulus as the test source.\nLet $M_{e, \\mathrm{source}}$ be the melanopic irradiance from the test source.\nLet $M_{e, \\mathrm{D65}}(E_{\\mathrm{v,D65}})$ be the melanopic irradiance from a D65 source that has a photopic illuminance of $E_{\\mathrm{v,D65}}$.\n\nBy the definition of $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$, we are looking for a photopic illuminance value, which we call $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$, such that a D65 source with this photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v,D65}} = E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$, produces the same melanopic stimulus as our test source. Mathematically:\n$$M_{e, \\mathrm{source}} = M_{e, \\mathrm{D65}}(E_{\\mathrm{v,D65}} = E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}})$$\n\n**Principle 4: Melanopic-to-photopic ratio ($r$)**\nThe melanopic-to-photopic ratio, $r$, is defined for the test source as the ratio of its \"melanopic weighted quantity\" to its photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$.\n$$r = \\frac{\\text{melanopic weighted quantity}}{E_{\\mathrm{v}}}$$\n\nThe critical step is to correctly interpret the term \"melanopic weighted quantity\". Principle 2 specifies that this quantity is made \"comparable across spectra\" by being \"normalized to the CIE Standard Daylight (D65) reference.\" This process of normalization to a reference light source (D65) to yield a value in units of illuminance (lux) is precisely the definition of Equivalent Daylight Illuminance. Therefore, the \"melanopic weighted quantity\" for the test source is its melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$.\n\nSubstituting this identification into the definition of $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}}{E_{\\mathrm{v}}}$$\nThis equation provides a direct relationship between the three quantities of interest.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression**\nThe problem asks for an expression for $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ in terms of $r$ and $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$. We can obtain this by simple algebraic rearrangement of the equation derived above:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}} = r \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{v}}$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe problem provides the following values for the specific light box:\n- Photopic illuminance: $E_{\\mathrm{v}} = 10,000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$\n- Melanopic-to-photopic ratio: $r = 0.9$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}} = 0.9 \\times 10,000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}} = 9000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $9000$. To express this with an unambiguous precision of four significant figures, it is best written in scientific notation.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}} = 9.000 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{lux}$$\n\nThe melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance at the cornea corresponding to this light exposure is $9000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$.",
