            "problem": "A patient with fluctuating cognition, recurrent well-formed visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism is being evaluated for suspected Lewy body neurocognitive disorder. Dopamine Transporter Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (DaT-SPECT) quantification yields a striatal binding ratio (SBR) in the posterior putamen of $x = 1.2$. From a laboratory reference cohort of cognitively normal controls matched for scanner and protocol, the SBR distribution is approximately Gaussian with reference mean $\\mu = 2.0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.2$. The site’s clinical reporting convention defines the lower bound of normal as $1.8$ based on its internal validation, such that values below this bound are considered abnormal.\n\nUsing only core statistical definitions, compute:\n1) the standardized $z$-score of this patient’s SBR relative to the stated reference distribution, and\n2) an abnormality code $A$ defined by $A = 1$ if $x < 1.8$ and $A = 0$ otherwise.\n\nReport your final answer as a single row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} z & A \\end{pmatrix}$ where the $z$-score is rounded to three significant figures. Do not include any units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe explicit data and definitions provided in the problem statement are:\n- Patient's striatal binding ratio (SBR): $x = 1.2$\n- Reference SBR distribution is approximately Gaussian.\n- Reference mean of the SBR distribution: $\\mu = 2.0$\n- Reference standard deviation of the SBR distribution: $\\sigma = 0.2$\n- Lower bound of normal for clinical reporting: $1.8$\n- Definition of abnormality code $A$: $A = 1$ if $x < 1.8$, and $A = 0$ otherwise.\n- The required output is a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} z & A \\end{pmatrix}$, with the $z$-score rounded to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of neurology and medical statistics. Dopamine Transporter Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (DaT-SPECT) is a standard imaging modality used in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. The quantification of striatal binding ratio (SBR) and its comparison to a reference population using statistical metrics like the $z$-score is a routine and valid clinical practice. The clinical presentation described (fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism) correctly corresponds to core features of Lewy body neurocognitive disorder. The numerical values provided are realistic for such measurements. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem requests the calculation of two distinct quantities, a $z$-score and a binary code $A$. The definitions and all necessary parameters ($x$, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and the threshold for $A$) are explicitly provided. The calculations are straightforward applications of these definitions, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement uses precise, quantitative, and objective language. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two values: the standardized $z$-score and the abnormality code $A$.\n\n**1) Calculation of the Standardized $z$-score**\n\nThe standardized score, or $z$-score, measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution. The formula for the $z$-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $x$ is the individual data point, $\\mu$ is the mean of the reference distribution, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the reference distribution.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- Patient's SBR, $x = 1.2$\n- Reference mean SBR, $\\mu = 2.0$\n- Reference standard deviation, $\\sigma = 0.2$\n\nWe compute:\n$$z = \\frac{1.2 - 2.0}{0.2}$$\n$$z = \\frac{-0.8}{0.2}$$\n$$z = -4.0$$\n\nThe problem requires the $z$-score to be rounded to three significant figures. An exact value of $-4.0$ is expressed as $-4.00$ to indicate this level of precision.\nThus, $z = -4.00$.\n\n**2) Calculation of the Abnormality Code $A$**\n\nThe abnormality code $A$ is defined by a conditional statement based on the patient's SBR $x$ and the clinical site's lower bound of normal, which is $1.8$. The definition is:\n$A = 1$ if $x < 1.8$\n$A = 0$ if $x \\geq 1.8$\n\nThe patient's SBR is given as $x = 1.2$. We test the condition:\nIs $1.2 < 1.8$? This inequality is true.\nAccording to the definition, since the condition $x < 1.8$ is met, the abnormality code is $A = 1$.\n\n**Final Answer Assembly**\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a single row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} z & A \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing the computed values:\n$z = -4.00$\n$A = 1$\n\nThe final matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} -4.00 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "problem": "A patient diagnosed with Lewy body neurocognitive disorder (also termed major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies) presents with lightheadedness on standing. In Lewy body neurocognitive disorder, autonomic nervous system dysfunction impairs baroreflex-mediated vascular responses, predisposing to orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is operationally defined, by widely used consensus criteria, as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least $20$ millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or a decrease in diastolic BP of at least $10$ mmHg measured within $3$ minutes of standing from supine rest.\n\nAfter $5$ minutes supine rest, the patient’s supine systolic BP is $140$ mmHg and supine diastolic BP is $80$ mmHg. At $3$ minutes after standing, the systolic BP is $110$ mmHg and the diastolic BP is $70$ mmHg.\n\nUsing the consensus definition above and taking the orthostatic drops as $\\Delta SBP = SBP_{\\text{supine}} - SBP_{\\text{standing}}$ and $\\Delta DBP = DBP_{\\text{supine}} - DBP_{\\text{standing}}$, compute the indicator function\n$$I = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\Delta SBP \\ge 20 \\text{ or } \\Delta DBP \\ge 10 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\nfor this patient at $3$ minutes.

            "solution": "Lewy body neurocognitive disorder is characterized by central and peripheral autonomic nervous system dysfunction, including impaired baroreflex responses. Normally, upon standing, venous pooling reduces venous return, transiently lowering stroke volume and arterial pressure; intact baroreflexes increase heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to counteract this. In autonomic failure, these compensations are blunted, leading to sustained orthostatic reductions in blood pressure.\n\nThe consensus operational definition of orthostatic hypotension (OH) states that within $3$ minutes of standing, there is OH if either the systolic blood pressure decreases by at least $20$ mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure decreases by at least $10$ mmHg compared to the supine measurement.\n\nWe compute the orthostatic drops from the given values:\n- Supine systolic blood pressure $SBP_{\\text{supine}} = 140$ mmHg; standing systolic blood pressure at $3$ minutes $SBP_{\\text{standing}} = 110$ mmHg. Thus,\n$$\\Delta SBP = SBP_{\\text{supine}} - SBP_{\\text{standing}} = 140 - 110 = 30.$$\n- Supine diastolic blood pressure $DBP_{\\text{supine}} = 80$ mmHg; standing diastolic blood pressure at $3$ minutes $DBP_{\\text{standing}} = 70$ mmHg. Thus,\n$$\\Delta DBP = DBP_{\\text{supine}} - DBP_{\\text{standing}} = 80 - 70 = 10.$$\n\nWe now evaluate the indicator function:\n$$I = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\Delta SBP \\ge 20 \\text{ or } \\Delta DBP \\ge 10 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\endcases}.$$\n\nHere, $\\Delta SBP = 30 \\ge 20$ is true, and $\\Delta DBP = 10 \\ge 10$ is also true.

The context of psychosis in dementia with Lewy bodies and the use of a selective serotonin receptor inverse agonist are scientifically sound and relevant to modern neuropsychiatry.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data for the calculations are provided. The definitions for the quantities to be calculated (Absolute Risk Reduction and Number Needed to Treat) are standard and unambiguous, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is presented using factual, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key metrics from clinical epidemiology: the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT).\n\nLet $P_{\\text{exp}}$ be the probability of the desired clinical outcome (response) in the experimental group (pimavanserin). Let $P_{\\text{ctrl}}$ be the probability of the same outcome in the control group (placebo).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$P_{\\text{exp}} = 55\\% = 0.55$$\n$$P_{\\text{ctrl}} = 35\\% = 0.35$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the experimental group. When the \"event\" is a desirable outcome, as in this case (a clinical response), this quantity is also known as the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI). The formula is:\n$$ARR = P_{\\text{exp}} - P_{\\text{ctrl}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ARR = 0.55 - 0.35 = 0.20$$\nThe problem requests this value as a decimal proportion, which is $0.20$.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the average number of patients who need to be treated with the experimental intervention to prevent one additional bad outcome or, as in this case, to achieve one additional good outcome. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nUsing the calculated value of ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.20}$$\nTo compute the exact integer value, we can express the decimal as a fraction.\n$$0.20 = \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nTherefore, the NNT is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 5$$\nThe NNT is $5$. This means that, on average, $5$ patients with DLB-related psychosis must be treated with pimavanserin for one additional patient to achieve a clinical response who would not have done so on placebo.\n\nThe final values are an absolute risk reduction of $0.20$ and a number needed to treat of $5$.",
