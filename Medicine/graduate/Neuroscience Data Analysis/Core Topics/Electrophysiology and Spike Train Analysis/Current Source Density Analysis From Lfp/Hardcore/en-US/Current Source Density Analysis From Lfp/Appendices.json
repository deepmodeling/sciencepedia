            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The problem describes the standard formulation of Current Source Density (CSD) analysis based on Ohm's law and the continuity equation in a conducting medium, which are fundamental principles of electromagnetism. All necessary definitions, constants, and relationships are provided. The problem is objective and formalizable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is twofold: first, to demonstrate through dimensional analysis that the unit of the Current Source Density (CSD) is identical to the unit of the expression $\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi$; and second, to determine the exponent vector of this unit in terms of the seven SI base units. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$.\n\nFirst, we determine the units of the CSD. The CSD is defined as the negative divergence of the current density vector $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CSD} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nThe negative sign is a dimensionless scalar and does not contribute to the units. The unit of the CSD is therefore the unit of the divergence of $\\mathbf{J}$. The divergence operator, $\\nabla \\cdot$, involves spatial derivatives. As stated in the problem premises, the gradient operator $\\nabla$ contributes a unit of inverse meters ($1/\\mathrm{m}$). Thus, the unit of the divergence operator is $[\\nabla \\cdot] = 1/\\mathrm{m}$. The current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the amount of charge flowing through a unit area per unit time, which has the SI unit of amperes per square meter, so $[\\mathbf{J}] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n\nCombining these, the unit of the CSD is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{CSD}] = [\\nabla \\cdot] [\\mathbf{J}] = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{m}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the units of the expression $\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi$. This requires finding the units of the conductivity $\\sigma$, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^{2}$, and the electric potential $\\phi$.\nThe conductivity $\\sigma$ of the medium is given in units of siemens per meter, so $[\\sigma] = \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}$. The problem states that the siemens unit is defined as $1\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$, which means its unit is $[\\mathrm{S}] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$. Substituting this into the unit for conductivity gives:\n$$\n[\\sigma] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{S}]}{[\\mathrm{m}]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^{2}$, involves second-order spatial derivatives. Consistent with the premise that $\\nabla$ contributes a factor of $1/\\mathrm{m}$, the Laplacian contributes a factor of $(1/\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 1/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. So, $[\\nabla^{2}] = 1/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\nThe Local Field Potential $\\phi$ is an electric potential, measured in volts, so $[\\phi] = \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nNow, we can find the unit of the entire expression $\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi$ by multiplying the units of its components:\n$$\n[\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi] = [\\sigma] [\\nabla^{2}] [\\phi] = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}\\right) (\\mathrm{V})\n$$\nThe unit of volts ($\\mathrm{V}$) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n$$\n[\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi] = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}\n$$\nComparing the results, we have $[\\mathrm{CSD}] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $[\\sigma \\nabla^{2} \\phi] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$. This demonstrates that the two quantities have identical units. This unit, amperes per cubic meter, represents current source strength per unit volume, which is the physical meaning of CSD.\n\nFinally, we express the unit $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ in terms of the seven SI base units, ordered as $(\\mathrm{kg}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{mol}, \\mathrm{cd})$, and determine the corresponding exponent vector. The ampere ($\\mathrm{A}$) and the meter ($\\mathrm{m}$) are base units. The unit $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ can be written as $\\mathrm{A}^{1}\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The other base units—kilogram ($\\mathrm{kg}$), second ($\\mathrm{s}$), kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$), mole ($\\mathrm{mol}$), and candela ($\\mathrm{cd}$)—are not part of this unit, so their exponents are $0$.\n\nThe unit expressed in terms of all seven base units is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{kg}^{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{A}^{1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{cd}^{0}\n$$\nThe ordered exponent vector for $(\\mathrm{kg}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{mol}, \\mathrm{cd})$ is therefore $(0, -3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.",

The Physical Relationship between CSD and LFP**\n\nThe problem states that the medium is ohmic, homogeneous, and isotropic with a constant conductivity $\\sigma$. Under these conditions, the electric current density vector, $\\vec{J}$, is related to the electric field, $\\vec{E}$, by Ohm's law:\n$$ \\vec{J} = \\sigma \\vec{E} $$\nIn the quasi-static approximation, the electric field is the negative gradient of the scalar electric potential, $\\phi$:\n$$ \\vec{E} = -\\nabla \\phi $$\nSubstituting this into Ohm's law gives the relationship between current density and potential:\n$$ \\vec{J} = -\\sigma \\nabla \\phi $$\nThe CSD, $I_m$, is defined as the divergence of the current density. This represents the net current per unit volume flowing out of (or into) a given point in space.\n$$ I_m = \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\vec{J}$:\n$$ I_m = \\nabla \\cdot (-\\sigma \\nabla \\phi) $$\nSince the conductivity $\\sigma$ is assumed to be constant (a homogeneous medium), it can be factored out of the divergence operator:\n$$ I_m = -\\sigma \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\phi) $$\nThe divergence of the gradient is the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$. Thus, the relationship is given by Poisson's equation:\n$$ I_m = -\\sigma \\nabla^2 \\phi $$\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional case where the potential and CSD vary only along the depth axis, $z$. In this case, the Laplacian operator simplifies to the second partial derivative with respect to $z$:\n$$ I_m(z) = -\\sigma \\frac{d^2\\phi(z)}{dz^2} $$\nThis equation is the fundamental physical law linking the continuous CSD, $I_m(z)$, to the continuous LFP, $\\phi(z)$, under the given assumptions. It confirms the problem's premise that the CSD is related to the second spatial derivative of the LFP.\n\n**2. Analysis in the Spatial Frequency Domain**\n\nTo understand the resolution, we analyze the relationship in the spatial frequency domain using the Fourier transform. Let $k$ be the angular spatial frequency (wavenumber) in units of radians per meter. Let $\\hat{I}_m(k)$ and $\\hat{\\phi}(k)$ be the one-dimensional Fourier transforms of $I_m(z)$ and $\\phi(z)$, respectively.\n$$ \\hat{I}_m(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{I_m(z)\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{\\phi}(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\phi(z)\\} $$\nThe Fourier transform of an $n$-th derivative is given by the property $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\frac{d^n f(z)}{dz^n}\\} = (ik)^n \\hat{f}(k)$. Applying this to our governing equation for the second derivative ($n=2$):\n$$ \\hat{I}_m(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{-\\sigma \\frac{d^2\\phi(z)}{dz^2}\\right\\} = -\\sigma (ik)^2 \\hat{\\phi}(k) $$\nExpanding the term $(ik)^2$:\n$$ \\hat{I}_m(k) = -\\sigma (i^2 k^2) \\hat{\\phi}(k) = -\\sigma (-1 \\cdot k^2) \\hat{\\phi}(k) $$\nThis yields the relationship in the spatial frequency domain:\n$$ \\hat{I}_m(k) = \\sigma k^2 \\hat{\\phi}(k) $$\nThis equation shows that the spectrum of the CSD is the spectrum of the LFP multiplied by a factor of $\\sigma k^2$. This means that higher spatial frequencies in the LFP are amplified in the CSD, making the CSD estimation a form of high-pass spatial filtering.\n\n**3. Sampling Theory and the Resolution Limit**\n\nThe LFP, $\\phi(z)$, is not observed continuously but is sampled at discrete points $z_n = n \\Delta z$, where $\\Delta z$ is the inter-contact spacing. This sampling process imposes a fundamental limit on the information that can be recovered from the data.\n\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a continuous signal can be uniquely reconstructed from its samples if and only if it is band-limited, and the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.\n\nIn our spatial context:\n- The sampling interval is $\\Delta z$.\n- The spatial sampling rate (or sampling frequency) is $f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta z}$ (in cycles per meter).\n- The corresponding angular spatial sampling frequency is $k_s = 2\\pi f_s = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Delta z}$ (in radians per meter).\n\nThe Nyquist frequency is half the sampling rate, which represents the highest frequency that can be uniquely resolved.\n- The Nyquist frequency in cycles per meter is $f_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{f_s}{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta z}$.\n- The angular Nyquist frequency in radians per meter is $k_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{k_s}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\Delta z}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z}$.\n\nAny frequency component in the original continuous signal $\\phi(z)$ (and thus in $I_m(z)$) with an angular frequency $|k|  k_{\\text{Nyquist}}$ will be aliased. Aliasing means that upon sampling, this high-frequency component becomes indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component within the range $[-k_{\\text{Nyquist}}, k_{\\text{Nyquist}}]$. For example, a sink/source pattern with a true frequency of $k_{\\text{Nyquist}} + \\delta k$ will appear to have a frequency of $k_{\\text{Nyquist}} - \\delta k$ in the sampled data. This distortion makes it impossible to uniquely determine the true CSD pattern for any components above the Nyquist frequency.\n\nThe CSD is calculated *from* the sampled LFP data. Therefore, the information available to construct the CSD is fundamentally limited by the sampling of the LFP. The highest spatial frequency we can possibly resolve for the CSD pattern is the highest spatial frequency we can resolve from the sampled LFP data. This limit is precisely the angular Nyquist frequency.\n\nTherefore, the maximum resolvable angular spatial frequency for the sinks/sources pattern, $k_{\\max}$, is equal to the angular Nyquist frequency determined by the sampling interval $\\Delta z$.\n\n$$ k_{\\max} = k_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z} $$\nThis result can be interpreted physically: to resolve a sinusoidal pattern of sinks and sources, we need at least two sample points per spatial wavelength, $\\lambda$. The minimum resolvable wavelength is therefore $\\lambda_{\\min} = 2 \\Delta z$. The maximum resolvable angular wavenumber is related to this wavelength by $k_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_{\\min}}$, which gives $k_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\Delta z} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z}$.",
