This first practice problem tackles the core consequence of undersampling: aliasing. By working through a common scenario in electrophysiology—a high-frequency artifact contaminating a recording—you will derive from first principles how a signal's frequency identity is lost and \"folds\" into the baseband, appearing as a completely different oscillation .

            "problem": "In an intracranial electrophysiology experiment, a narrowband artifact at frequency $f_{0} = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ contaminates a Local Field Potential (LFP) recording.

You subsequently analyze the sampled data in the baseband interval $[0, f_{s}/2]$.\n\nUsing first principles relevant to digital sampling and reconstruction in neuroscience data analysis, begin from the continuous-time sinusoid representation and the definition of the sampling operator, together with the well-established fact that sampling produces spectral replication at integer multiples of the sampling rate. From this base, reason through how frequencies become indistinguishable modulo $f_{s}$ in discrete time, and explain how folding into the observable baseband arises.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of an aliased frequency resulting from the undersampling of a continuous-time signal, a common issue in digital data acquisition, including neuroscience. The core of the problem lies in the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which dictates that to perfectly reconstruct a bandlimited signal, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency $f_{max}$ present in the signal, i.e., $f_s > 2f_{max}$. In this problem, a signal component at $f_0 = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is sampled at $f_s = 1\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The Nyquist frequency, which is the highest frequency that can be unambiguously represented, is $f_{Nyquist} = f_s/2 = 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $f_0 > f_{Nyquist}$, the sampling criterion is violated, leading to aliasing. We will derive the observed aliased frequency from first principles.\n\nLet the continuous-time artifact signal be represented by a sinusoid:\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $f_0 = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is the frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase.\n\nUniform sampling is the process of measuring the value of this continuous signal at discrete, equally spaced time intervals. This can be modeled by multiplying the signal $x(t)$ with an infinite train of Dirac delta functions, the sampling function $s(t)$, defined as:\n$$s(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - nT_s)$$\nwhere $T_s = 1/f_s$ is the sampling period. In this case, $T_s = 1/1000\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe sampled signal, $x_s(t)$, is the product $x(t)s(t)$:\n$$x_s(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - nT_s) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(nT_s) \\delta(t - nT_s)$$\nThe result is a train of impulses, where the strength of each impulse is equal to the value of the original signal at the corresponding time instant. The digital system stores these values as a discrete-time sequence, denoted by $x[n]$:\n$$x[n] = x(t)|_{t=nT_s} = A \\cos(2\\pi f_0 nT_s + \\phi)$$\nSubstituting $T_s = 1/f_s$, we have:\n$$x[n] = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_0}{f_s} n + \\phi\\right)$$\nThis equation reveals the fundamental nature of frequency in discrete-time signals. Consider another continuous-time signal $y(t)$ with a frequency $f' = f_0 + k f_s$ for any non-zero integer $k$. Upon sampling at the same rate $f_s$, its discrete-time representation $y[n]$ would be:\n$$y[n] = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_0 + kf_s}{f_s} n + \\phi\\right) = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_0}{f_s} n + 2\\pi k n + \\phi\\right)$$\nSince $k$ and $n$ are integers, $2\\pi k n$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. The cosine function is periodic with period $2\\pi$, so $\\cos(\\theta + 2\\pi m) = \\cos(\\theta)$ for any integer $m$. Therefore,\n$$y[n] = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_0}{f_s} n + \\phi\\right) = x[n]$$\nThis demonstrates that after sampling, the discrete sequence $x[n]$ is identical for a family of continuous-time frequencies $f_0 + k f_s$ for all integers $k$. The sampling process makes these frequencies indistinguishable. All continuous frequencies are mapped to a principal frequency interval, typically chosen as $[-f_s/2, f_s/2)$.\n\nThis indistinguishability can also be understood in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of the sampling function $s(t)$ is another impulse train:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\} = S(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s)$$\nMultiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain. Thus, the spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(f)$, is the convolution of the original signal's spectrum, $X(f)$, with $S(f)$:\n$$X_s(f) = X(f) * S(f) = X(f) * \\left( f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s) \\right) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(f - kf_s)$$\nThis shows that the spectrum of the sampled signal consists of infinitely many copies of the original spectrum $X(f)$, scaled by $f_s$ and shifted to be centered at every integer multiple of the sampling frequency, $kf_s$.\nThe original signal $x(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)$ has spectral components (Dirac deltas) at frequencies $\\pm f_0$. The sampling process creates replicas of these components at $\\pm f_0 + k f_s$ for all integers $k$.\n\nAnalysis of the sampled data is performed in the baseband interval, which for a real-valued signal is conventionally $[0, f_s/2]$. An ideal reconstruction system (or a digital spectrum analyzer like the Fast Fourier Transform) observes only the frequencies within this band. Any spectral energy from the replicas that falls into the principal interval $[-f_s/2, f_s/2)$ will be interpreted as originating from a frequency within that interval.\n\nFor the given parameters, $f_0 = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $f_s = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The Nyquist frequency is $f_{Nyquist} = f_s/2 = 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The analysis interval is $[0, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe original frequency component at $f_0 = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is outside this interval. We must find an integer $k$ such that one of its aliases, $\\pm f_0 + k f_s$, falls into the principal interval $[-500, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nLet's check for the alias of the positive frequency component, $+f_0$:\n- For $k = 0$, the frequency is $900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is outside $[-500, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- For $k = -1$, the frequency is $f_0 - f_s = 900 - 1000 = -100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This falls within $[-500, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nLet's check for the alias of the negative frequency component, $-f_0$:\n- For $k = 1$, the frequency is $-f_0 + f_s = -900 + 1000 = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This also falls within $[-500, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe discrete-time signal thus contains spectral power corresponding to continuous-time frequencies of $\\pm 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. When analyzing the data in the positive frequency baseband $[0, f_s/2]$, which is $[0, 500]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the observed component will be at $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThis process is often visualized as \"folding\" the frequency axis. Frequencies in the band $[f_s/2, f_s]$, i.e., $[500, 1000]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, are folded back into the baseband. A frequency $f$ in this range will appear at an aliased frequency $f_{alias} = f_s - f$.\nOur signal frequency $f_0 = 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ lies within this first alias band. Therefore, its observed frequency is:\n$$f_{alias} = f_s - f_0 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz} - 900\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThis confirms the result from the spectral replication argument. The $900\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ contaminant artifact will be erroneously observed as a $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ signal in the sampled data.",

The digitizer then samples the filtered signal at a rate $f_{s}$.\n\nStarting from the definition that ideal sampling by a real sequence at rate $f_{s}$ produces spectral replicas of the continuous-time spectrum shifted by integer multiples of $f_{s}$, and that the observable discrete-time spectrum is confined to the baseband interval $[0, f_{s}/2]$ by the periodicity and Hermitian symmetry induced by sampling and real-valuedness, derive conditions ensuring that the entire analog passband $[f_{L}, f_{H}]$ is mapped into a single contiguous baseband interval without overlap or splitting across $0$ or $f_{s}/2$.

The mapping depends on the zone's index $m$.\nFor an even-numbered zone $m$, the mapping is based on reflection around the zone's upper boundary, which is a multiple of $f_s$. A simpler perspective is that frequencies in $Z_2$ alias according to the formula $f_a = f_s - f$.\nThis transformation is order-reversing: the lower limit of the original band maps to the upper limit of the aliased band, and vice versa.\n- The lower frequency $f_L = 2\\,\\text{kHz}$ maps to the new upper frequency $f_{a,H}$:\n  $$ f_{a,H} = f_s - f_L = 3.6\\,\\text{kHz} - 2\\,\\text{kHz} = 1.6\\,\\text{kHz} $$\n- The higher frequency $f_H = 3\\,\\text{kHz}$ maps to the new lower frequency $f_{a,L}$:\n  $$ f_{a,L} = f_s - f_H = 3.6\\,\\text{kHz} - 3\\,\\text{kHz} = 0.6\\,\\text{kHz} $$\nThe resulting aliased band in the baseband is $[f_{a,L}, f_{a,H}] = [0.6\\,\\text{kHz}, 1.6\\,\\text{kHz}]$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum number of samples, $N$, needed to resolve two closely spaced sinusoidal components in a local field potential (LFP) recording using a Hann-windowed periodogram. The resolution criterion is explicitly defined: two components are considered resolved if the spectral peak of one component lies at or beyond the first spectral null of the other.\n\nLet the two sinusoidal components have continuous-time frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$, with a separation $\\Delta f = |f_2 - f_1|$. Since the signal is sampled at a frequency $f_s$, the corresponding discrete-time frequencies are $\\omega_1 = 2\\pi f_1 / f_s$ and $\\omega_2 = 2\\pi f_2 / f_s$. The discrete separation is $\\Delta\\omega = |\\omega_2 - \\omega_1| = 2\\pi \\Delta f / f_s$.\n\nThe process of windowing in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain. The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the windowed signal is the convolution of the signal's DTFT with the window's DTFT. For a signal composed of two pure sinusoids, its DTFT consists of two pairs of Dirac delta functions located at $\\pm \\omega_1$ and $\\pm \\omega_2$. The resulting spectrum of the windowed signal is therefore a superposition of two scaled and shifted copies of the window's spectrum, centered at these frequencies.\n\nThe ability to distinguish these two spectral peaks depends on the width of the main lobe of the window's spectrum, denoted $W(\\omega)$. The problem specifies the Rayleigh resolution criterion, which means the frequency separation $\\Delta f$ must be at least the distance from the central peak of the window's spectrum to its first null. Let us denote this minimum resolvable frequency separation as $\\Delta f_{\\text{res}}$.

Each of these is a complex exponential of finite duration, whose DTFT is a shifted Dirichlet kernel. This construction results in a spectral main lobe that is significantly wider than that of a rectangular window of the same length, but with much lower sidelobe levels.\n\nFor a rectangular window of length $N$, the first null of its DTFT occurs at a digital frequency offset of $\\Delta\\omega = 2\\pi/N$ from the main peak. This corresponds to an analog frequency offset of $\\Delta f = f_s/N$.\n\nIt is a standard result in spectral analysis that the main lobe of a Hann window (measured between the first nulls on either side of the peak) is approximately twice the width of the main lobe of a rectangular window of the same length $N$. Consequently, the distance from the central peak to the first null for a Hann window is twice that for a rectangular window.\nTherefore, the minimum resolvable frequency separation for a Hann window is:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\text{res}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{f_s}{N}\\right) = \\frac{2f_s}{N}$$\n\nAccording to the problem's resolution criterion, the desired frequency separation, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{desired}}$, must be greater than or equal to this minimum resolvable separation:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{desired}} \\ge \\frac{2f_s}{N}$$\nWe must find the minimal integer $N$ that satisfies this condition.
