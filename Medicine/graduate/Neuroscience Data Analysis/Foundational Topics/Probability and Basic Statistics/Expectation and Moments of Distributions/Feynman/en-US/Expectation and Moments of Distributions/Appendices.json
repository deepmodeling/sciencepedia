Let the across-trial amplitude be modeled by a real-valued random variable $X$ with finite raw moments up to order four, where the $k$-th raw moment is defined as $m_{k} = E[X^{k}]$, and the mean is $\\mu = E[X] = m_{1}$.

It is based on standard definitions in probability and statistics and represents a common application in neuroscience data analysis. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are solvable through direct mathematical derivation.\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks. The first is to derive expressions for the third and fourth central moments, $\\mu_{3}$ and $\\mu_{4}$, in terms of raw moments $m_{k}$ and the mean $\\mu$. The second is to compute the kurtosis, $\\gamma_{2}$, for a normal distribution.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Central Moments from Raw Moments**\n\nThe definitions provided are:\n- The mean: $\\mu = E[X] = m_{1}$\n- The $k$-th raw moment: $m_{k} = E[X^{k}]$\n- The $k$-th central moment: $\\mu_{k} = E[(X - \\mu)^{k}]$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the third central moment, $\\mu_{3}$. We start from its definition:\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = E[(X - \\mu)^{3}]\n$$\nUsing the binomial expansion for $(a-b)^{3} = a^{3} - 3a^{2}b + 3ab^{2} - b^{3}$, with $a=X$ and $b=\\mu$, we expand the term inside the expectation:\n$$\n(X - \\mu)^{3} = X^{3} - 3X^{2}\\mu + 3X\\mu^{2} - \\mu^{3}\n$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = E[X^{3} - 3X^{2}\\mu + 3X\\mu^{2} - \\mu^{3}] = E[X^{3}] - E[3X^{2}\\mu] + E[3X\\mu^{2}] - E[\\mu^{3}]\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = E[X^{3}] - 3\\mu E[X^{2}] + 3\\mu^{2} E[X] - \\mu^{3}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definitions of the raw moments ($m_{k} = E[X^{k}]$) and the mean ($\\mu = E[X] = m_{1}$):\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = m_{3} - 3\\mu m_{2} + 3\\mu^{2} m_{1} - \\mu^{3}\n$$\nAs the problem states $\\mu=m_{1}$, we can substitute $m_{1}$ with $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = m_{3} - 3\\mu m_{2} + 3\\mu^{2}(\\mu) - \\mu^{3}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final form for $\\mu_{3}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{3} = m_{3} - 3\\mu m_{2} + 2\\mu^{3}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the fourth central moment, $\\mu_{4}$. We again start from its definition:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = E[(X - \\mu)^{4}]\n$$\nUsing the binomial expansion for $(a-b)^{4} = a^{4} - 4a^{3}b + 6a^{2}b^{2} - 4ab^{3} + b^{4}$, with $a=X$ and $b=\\mu$:\n$$\n(X - \\mu)^{4} = X^{4} - 4X^{3}\\mu + 6X^{2}\\mu^{2} - 4X\\mu^{3} + \\mu^{4}\n$$\nApplying the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = E[X^{4}] - 4\\mu E[X^{3}] + 6\\mu^{2} E[X^{2}] - 4\\mu^{3} E[X] + E[\\mu^{4}]\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions for the raw moments and the mean:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = m_{4} - 4\\mu m_{3} + 6\\mu^{2} m_{2} - 4\\mu^{3} m_{1} + \\mu^{4}\n$$\nAgain, we replace $m_{1}$ with $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = m_{4} - 4\\mu m_{3} + 6\\mu^{2} m_{2} - 4\\mu^{3}(\\mu) + \\mu^{4}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final form for $\\mu_{4}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = m_{4} - 4\\mu m_{3} + 6\\mu^{2} m_{2} - 3\\mu^{4}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Kurtosis of a Normal Distribution**\n\nThe kurtosis is defined as $\\gamma_{2} = \\mu_{4} / \\mu_{2}^{2}$. We are given that the random variable $X$ follows a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$.\n\nThe second central moment, $\\mu_{2}$, is the variance of the distribution. For a normal distribution with parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^{2}$, the variance is $\\sigma^{2}$ by definition.\n$$\n\\mu_{2} = E[(X-\\mu)^{2}] = \\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^{2}\n$$\nTo find the fourth central moment, $\\mu_{4}$, for $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$, it is convenient to work with the standard normal variable $Z = (X - \\mu) / \\sigma$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The central moments of $X$ can be expressed in terms of the moments of $Z$:\n$$\n\\mu_{k} = E[(X - \\mu)^{k}] = E[(\\sigma Z)^{k}] = \\sigma^{k} E[Z^{k}]\n$$\nFor $\\mu_{4}$, this gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = \\sigma^{4} E[Z^{4}]\n$$\nWe must now find the fourth moment of the standard normal distribution, $E[Z^{4}]$. A widely accepted property of the standard normal distribution, derivable via integration by parts of its probability density function $\\phi(z) = (1/\\sqrt{2\\pi})\\exp(-z^{2}/2)$, is that its even-order moments are given by $E[Z^{2n}] = (2n-1)!! = (2n-1)(2n-3)\\cdots 1$. For $n=2$, this gives the fourth moment:\n$$\nE[Z^{4}] = (2 \\cdot 2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\mu_{4}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{4} = \\sigma^{4} \\cdot 3 = 3\\sigma^{4}\n$$\nNow we have all the components to calculate the kurtosis $\\gamma_{2}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{4}}{\\mu_{2}^{2}} = \\frac{3\\sigma^{4}}{(\\sigma^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{3\\sigma^{4}}{\\sigma^{4}} = 3\n$$\nThus, the kurtosis of any normal distribution is exactly $3$.\n\nThe final results are the expressions for $\\mu_{3}$ and $\\mu_{4}$, and the numerical value of $\\gamma_{2}$ for the normal distribution.",

Calculation of the First Moment, $E[X]$**\n\nWe compute the first derivative of the given characteristic function, $\\varphi_{X}(t) = \\exp(i \\mu t - \\sigma^{3/2} |t|^{3/2})$.\nUsing the chain rule, for $t \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} = \\varphi_X(t) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( i \\mu t - \\sigma^{3/2} |t|^{3/2} \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the term $|t|^{3/2}$ must be handled carefully. For $t \\neq 0$, its derivative is $\\frac{3}{2}|t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t)$, where $\\text{sgn}(t)$ is the sign function.\nThus, for $t \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} = \\exp(i \\mu t - \\sigma^{3/2} |t|^{3/2}) \\cdot \\left( i \\mu - \\sigma^{3/2} \\frac{3}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the derivative at $t=0$, we must examine the limit of this expression as $t \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\left[ \\exp(i \\mu t - \\sigma^{3/2} |t|^{3/2}) \\cdot \\left( i \\mu - \\sigma^{3/2} \\frac{3}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nAs $t \\to 0$, the first term $\\exp(i \\mu t - \\sigma^{3/2} |t|^{3/2}) \\to \\exp(0) = 1$. The second term's behavior is determined by the term $|t|^{1/2}$, which approaches $0$.\nSo, the limit is:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} = 1 \\cdot (i \\mu - 0) = i \\mu\n$$\nSince the limit exists, the first derivative of $\\varphi_X(t)$ at $t=0$ is well-defined and equals $i\\mu$. Therefore, the first moment exists.\n$$\nE[X] = i^{-1} \\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=0} = i^{-1} (i\\mu) = \\mu\n$$\nThe expectation of the random variable $X$ is equal to the location parameter $\\mu$.\n\n**2. Existence of the Second Moment, $E[X^2]$**\n\nWe must now assess the existence of the second derivative of $\\varphi_X(t)$ at $t=0$. We differentiate the expression for $\\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt}$ using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\varphi_X(t)}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\varphi_X(t) \\cdot \\left( i \\mu - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\varphi_X(t)}{dt^2} = \\frac{d\\varphi_X(t)}{dt} \\left( i \\mu - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right) + \\varphi_X(t) \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( i \\mu - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right)\n$$\nLet's analyze the second term as $t \\to 0$. We need the derivative of $|t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t)$. This function is equivalent to $t^{1/2}$ for $t > 0$ and $-(-t)^{1/2}$ for $t < 0$.\nFor $t > 0$, the derivative is $\\frac{1}{2} t^{-1/2}$.\nFor $t < 0$, the derivative is $-\\frac{1}{2}(-t)^{-1/2}(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-t)^{-1/2}$.\nIn both cases, for $t \\neq 0$, the derivative is $\\frac{1}{2}|t|^{-1/2}$.\nThe derivative of the second part of the product is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( i \\mu - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{2} |t|^{1/2} \\text{sgn}(t) \\right) = - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{2} \\frac{1}{2}|t|^{-1/2} = - \\frac{3\\sigma^{3/2}}{4|t|^{1/2}}\n$$\nAs $t \\to 0$, this term diverges to $-\\infty$. Because one of the terms in the expression for the second derivative diverges at $t=0$, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2\\varphi_X(t)}{dt^2}$ does not exist at $t=0$. Consequently, the second moment $E[X^2]$ does not exist as a finite value.\n\n**3. Justification from Asymptotic Tail Behavior**\n\nThe problem states that $X$ follows a symmetric stable law with tail index $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$. A well-tested fact for such distributions is that the probability density function $p(x)$ has an asymptotic power-law tail:\n$$\np(x) \\sim c|x|^{-(\\alpha+1)} \\quad \\text{as } |x| \\to \\infty,\n$$\nfor some positive constant $c$. Here, with $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $p(x) \\sim c|x|^{-5/2}$.\n\nThe $k$-th absolute moment, $E[|X|^k]$, is finite if and only if the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |x|^k p(x) dx$ converges. Due to symmetry, this is equivalent to the convergence of $2\\int_0^\\infty x^k p(x) dx$.\nFor large $x$, the integrand behaves as $x^k \\cdot c x^{-(\\alpha+1)} = c x^{k-\\alpha-1}$.\nThe integral converges if and only if the exponent is less than $-1$, i.e., $k-\\alpha-1 < -1$, which simplifies to $k < \\alpha$.\n\nLet's apply this condition to our specific case where $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2}$:\n- For the first moment, $k=1$. The condition is $1 < \\frac{3}{2}$, which is true. Therefore, $E[|X|]$ is finite, which implies that $E[X]$ is also finite and well-defined. This confirms our prior result.\n- For the second moment, $k=2$. The condition is $2 < \\frac{3}{2}$, which is false. Since the condition is not met, the integral for $E[|X|^2]$ diverges. This means $E[|X|^2] = \\infty$, and therefore the second moment $E[X^2]$ does not exist (is infinite). This independently confirms the conclusion from the characteristic function analysis.\n\n**4. Implication for Variance-Based Analysis**\n\nThe variance of a random variable is defined as $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. We have established that $E[X] = \\mu$ is finite, but $E[X^2]$ is infinite. Therefore, the variance of the synaptic current fluctuations, under this model, is infinite.\n\nThis has profound implications for data analysis. Many standard statistical methods are fundamentally premised on the existence of a finite second moment (and thus, finite variance). Examples include:\n- **Sample variance and standard deviation:** These statistics will not converge to a stable value as more data is collected. Instead, they will tend to grow with the sample size, and their values will be highly sensitive to extreme events (the \"heavy tails\").\n- **Least-squares optimization:** Methods like linear regression that minimize squared error are optimal under assumptions of finite variance (e.g., the Gauss-Markov theorem). For heavy-tailed data, their estimates can be severely biased by outliers.\n- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This method is based on the covariance matrix, which contains variances on its diagonal. If the variance is infinite, the covariance matrix is undefined, and PCA is not applicable.\n- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** When defined in terms of signal and noise power (variance), this metric becomes ill-defined.\n\nIn conclusion, for synaptic fluctuations accurately described by this heavy-tailed stable model, any analysis pipeline that relies on finite variance is mathematically unsound and will produce unstable, unreliable, and potentially misleading results. Analysis must instead use tools appropriate for heavy-tailed distributions. Dispersion should be characterized by an alternative measure, such as the scale parameter $\\sigma$ of the stable distribution or robust statistics like the interquartile range.",
