This exercise grounds the abstract concept of a $p$-value in a concrete computation for a two-sided $z$-test, a common scenario in analyzing experimental data. By working through this problem , you will directly connect an observed sample mean to the probability of observing such a result, or one more extreme, under the null hypothesis, reinforcing the core logic of hypothesis testing.",

            "problem": "A systems neuroscience lab analyzes the evoked membrane-potential deflection per stimulus presentation in a recurrent cortical microcircuit preparation. The experimenters collect $n = 50$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trial measurements of the evoked response amplitude (in arbitrary units), with an empirically observed sample mean $\\bar{x} = 1.2$. From prior, independent calibration experiments on the same setup and cell type, the measurement noise standard deviation is treated as known and equal to $\\sigma = 1$. The scientific question is whether the mean evoked response differs from zero. Formally, they wish to test the two-sided hypothesis $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$ versus $H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$ with $\\mu_0 = 0$. Assume trials are i.i.d., and that, by either exact normality of the underlying response distribution or by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sampling distribution of the standardized sample mean under $H_0$ is well approximated by a standard normal distribution.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of the sampling distribution of the mean under $H_0$ and the definition of a two-sided $p$-value as the probability, under $H_0$, of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the realized one, compute the two-sided $z$-test $p$-value for this experiment. Express your final answer as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to compute the two-sided $p$-value for a $z$-test. The problem provides the following information:\n- The sample size, $n = 50$.\n- The sample mean, $\\bar{x} = 1.2$.\n- The known population standard deviation, $\\sigma = 1$.\n- The null hypothesis, $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$, where the hypothesized mean is $\\mu_0 = 0$.\n- The alternative hypothesis, $H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$, which specifies a two-sided test.\n\nThe sampling distribution of the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ under the null hypothesis has a mean $\\mu_{\\bar{X}} = \\mu_0 = 0$ and a standard deviation, known as the standard error of the mean (SEM), given by $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$. The SEM is calculated as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, we find the SEM:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the sampling distribution of the standardized sample mean is well-approximated by a standard normal distribution. This allows us to use a $z$-test. The test statistic, denoted as $z_{obs}$, quantifies how many standard errors the observed sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is from the hypothesized population mean $\\mu_0$. The formula for the $z$-statistic is:\n$$\nz_{obs} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$\nz_{obs} = \\frac{1.2 - 0}{1 / \\sqrt{50}} = 1.2 \\times \\sqrt{50}\n$$\nWe can simplify the expression for $z_{obs}$:\n$$\nz_{obs} = 1.2 \\times \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 1.2 \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nNumerically, this value is approximately:\n$$\nz_{obs} \\approx 8.485281\n$$\nThe $p$-value for a two-sided test is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true. \"At least as extreme\" for a two-sided test means the test statistic is either greater than or equal to $|z_{obs}|$ or less than or equal to $-|z_{obs}|$. If $Z$ is a random variable following the standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, the $p$-value is given by:\n$$\np = P(Z \\geq |z_{obs}|) + P(Z \\leq -|z_{obs}|)\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, $P(Z \\geq |z_{obs}|) = P(Z \\leq -|z_{obs}|)$. Therefore, the expression for the $p$-value simplifies to:\n$$\np = 2 \\times P(Z \\geq |z_{obs}|)\n$$\nSubstituting our calculated value of $z_{obs} = 6\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\np = 2 \\times P(Z \\geq 6\\sqrt{2})\n$$\nThe value of $6\\sqrt{2}$ is very large for a standard normal distribution, indicating that the observed sample mean $\\bar{x}=1.2$ is extremely unlikely to have occurred if the true mean were $\\mu=0$. The corresponding probability in the tail of the distribution will be exceedingly small. This probability cannot be found in standard printed tables and must be computed using numerical software.\nUsing a high-precision calculator for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$, the $p$-value is:\n$$\np = 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(6\\sqrt{2})) \\approx 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(8.485281))\n$$\nThis computation yields:\n$$\np \\approx 2.220446 \\times 10^{-17}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. Rounding the computed value gives:\n$$\np \\approx 2.220 \\times 10^{-17}\n$$\nThis extremely small $p$-value would lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis $H_0$ at any conventional significance level (e.g., $\\alpha = 0.05, 0.01, 0.001$), providing very strong evidence that the true mean evoked response differs from zero.",

Let $E_i$ be the event of a Type I error for the $i$-th test. Since all null hypotheses are true, the probability of a Type I error for any single test is $P(E_i) = \\alpha$.\n\nIt is most straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: making *no* Type I errors. The probability of *not* making a Type I error on a single test is $1 - \\alpha$. Because the tests are independent, the probability of making no Type I errors across all $m$ tests is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{no Type I errors}) = (1 - \\alpha)^m\n$$\nThe FWER is $1$ minus this probability:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^m\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the Expected Number of False Positives**\n\nLet $N_{FP}$ be the random variable for the total number of false positives. We can express this as the sum of $m$ indicator variables, $X_i$, where $X_i=1$ if a Type I error occurs for test $i$ and $X_i=0$ otherwise.\n$$\nN_{FP} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} X_i\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $N_{FP}$ is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$\nE[N_{FP}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} E[X_i]\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Here, $E[X_i] = P(\\text{Type I error for test } i) = \\alpha$. Therefore:\n$$\nE[N_{FP}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha = m \\alpha\n$$\nThis result holds even if the tests are not independent.\n\n**Evaluation and Interpretation**\n\nWe evaluate these expressions for $m=20$ and $\\alpha=0.05$:\n\nFWER:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{20} = 1 - (0.95)^{20}\n$$\nExpected number of false positives:\n$$\nE[N_{FP}] = 20 \\times 0.05 = 1\n$$\n**Interpretation:**\nFor an analysis of just 20 independent voxels where no true activation exists, using a conventional $\\alpha=0.05$ threshold without correction results in a Family-Wise Error Rate of $1 - (0.95)^{20} \\approx 0.6415$. This means there is over a 64% chance of finding at least one false positive purely by chance. Furthermore, we expect to find, on average, 1 such false positive voxel. This demonstrates that failing to correct for multiple comparisons, even in a small search space, dramatically inflates the risk of false discoveries, highlighting why such corrections are essential in neuroimaging.\n\nThe expressions in their exact analytic form are $1 - (0.95)^{20}$ for the FWER and $1$ for the expected number of false positives.",

We need to find the number of discoveries (rejected null hypotheses) and the corresponding adjusted $p$-values (also known as $q$-values) for all $20$ tests.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of discoveries. The BH step-up procedure specifies finding the largest integer $k$ (where $1 \\leq k \\leq m$) such that the $k$-th ordered $p$-value, $p_{(k)}$, satisfies the inequality:\n$$p_{(k)} \\leq \\frac{k}{m}q$$\nIf such a $k$ exists, we reject the null hypotheses corresponding to the $p$-values $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \\dots, p_{(k)}$. The number of discoveries is then $k$. If no such $k$ exists, we reject no hypotheses, and the number of discoveries is $0$.\n\nIn this problem, $m=20$ and $q=0.1$. The condition is $p_{(k)} \\leq \\frac{k}{20}(0.1) = \\frac{k}{200}$. We search for the largest $k$ that satisfies this, starting from $k=m=20$ and proceeding downwards.\n\nFor $k=14$, $p_{(14)}=0.072$. The threshold is $\\frac{14}{200} = 0.07$. Since $0.072 > 0.07$, the condition is not met.\nFor $k=13$, $p_{(13)}=0.06$. The threshold is $\\frac{13}{200} = 0.065$. Since $0.06 \\leq 0.065$, the condition is met.\n\nSince $k=13$ is the largest index for which the condition $p_{(k)} \\leq \\frac{k}{m}q$ holds, we reject the $13$ null hypotheses corresponding to $p_{(1)}, \\dots, p_{(13)}$. The number of Benjamini–Hochberg-selected discoveries is $13$.\n\nNext, we compute the BH-adjusted $p$-values, denoted as $q_{(i)}$, for each ordered hypothesis $i=1, \\dots, 20$. The adjusted $p$-value for the $i$-th ordered $p$-value is defined as:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( \\frac{m}{j} p_{(j)} \\right)$$\nThis definition ensures that the sequence of adjusted $p$-values is monotonically non-decreasing, i.e., $q_{(1)} \\leq q_{(2)} \\leq \\dots \\leq q_{(m)}$.\nA practical way to compute these values is to first calculate the intermediate values $p'_{(i)} = \\frac{m}{i}p_{(i)}$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$.
