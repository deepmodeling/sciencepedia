## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the foundational principles and mechanics of Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we now turn our focus to its application. The true power of RSA lies not merely in its mathematical formulation, but in its remarkable versatility as a conceptual and analytical framework. It provides a common language for comparing representations across different measurement modalities, computational models, and even scientific disciplines. This chapter explores how RSA is employed to answer fundamental questions in modern science, moving from its core applications in [systems neuroscience](@entry_id:173923) to its role in bridging computational modeling, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and machine learning. We will demonstrate that by abstracting a representation to its intrinsic geometric structure—the matrix of pairwise dissimilarities—RSA enables a level of comparison and integration that was previously intractable.

### Mapping the Brain's Representational Landscape

A primary goal of neuroscience is to understand how and where the brain encodes information about the world. RSA offers a suite of tools to create detailed maps of this representational landscape, revealing not only what is represented, but also when and how these representations are structured.

#### Localizing Representations with Searchlight RSA

While region-of-interest (ROI) analysis provides a powerful way to test hypotheses about specific brain areas, it requires strong a priori assumptions about [functional localization](@entry_id:907303). To explore representational content across the entire brain without such constraints, RSA can be implemented in a "searchlight" framework. This technique systematically moves a small, local neighborhood (typically a sphere of voxels) through the brain volume. At each location, the multivoxel patterns within the searchlight are used to compute a local neural Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM). This local RDM is then compared to one or more model RDMs, and the resulting similarity score (e.g., a Spearman correlation) is assigned to the central voxel of the searchlight. By repeating this procedure for every voxel in the brain, a continuous, whole-brain map of model fit is generated. These maps reveal the anatomical loci where specific types of information—such as object categories, auditory features, or semantic concepts—are represented, providing a comprehensive, data-driven view of the brain's functional organization .

#### Tracking Representational Dynamics with Time-Resolved RSA

Many neural processes unfold on a timescale of milliseconds, far faster than the temporal resolution of fMRI. For high-temporal-resolution data from methods like magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), RSA can be applied in a time-resolved manner. Instead of a single RDM, a separate neural RDM is constructed at each time point from the multivariate sensor or source-reconstructed activity patterns. This produces a "movie" of RDMs, capturing the moment-by-moment evolution of the brain's representational geometry. By correlating this sequence of neural RDMs with fixed model RDMs, researchers can track the precise time course of information processing. For instance, one can observe the rapid transition from representations of low-level visual features to high-level categorical information in the hundreds of milliseconds following stimulus presentation. A methodologically rigorous implementation of this approach requires careful handling of the noisy, [high-dimensional data](@entry_id:138874), typically involving cross-validated [dissimilarity measures](@entry_id:634100) and noise normalization (whitening) to ensure that the resulting dynamics reflect genuine changes in representational structure .

#### Visualizing Representational Geometry

The RDM itself is a complete, second-order description of a representational space, but its high dimensionality can make it difficult to interpret intuitively. To visualize the structure captured by an RDM, techniques such as classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) are invaluable. MDS takes an RDM as input and computes a low-dimensional arrangement of the stimuli, where the distances between stimuli in the low-dimensional plot approximate their dissimilarities in the RDM. For example, stimuli that are highly dissimilar in the [neural representation](@entry_id:1128614) will be placed far apart in the MDS plot. This provides an intuitive, visual summary of the representational geometry, revealing clusters, dimensions, and other structural properties of the neural code. The mathematical underpinnings of MDS connect directly to RSA, where the eigenvalues derived during the scaling process correspond to the amount of representational variance captured along each principal axis of the geometry .

### Testing Computational Models of Brain Function

Perhaps the most impactful application of RSA is its use as a quantitative bridge between computational theory and empirical neuroscience. By operationalizing theoretical models as RDMs, RSA provides a common framework to test and compare competing hypotheses about how the brain performs computations.

#### From Theory to Model RDMs

The process begins by formalizing a scientific hypothesis as a computational model that predicts the dissimilarity between stimuli. For instance, a model of visual [object recognition](@entry_id:1129025) might be based on a set of hypothesized features, such as shape, texture, or semantic properties. The representation of each stimulus is a vector in this feature space. A model RDM is then constructed by computing the pairwise distances (e.g., Euclidean distance) between these feature vectors. The relative importance of different feature dimensions can be theoretically motivated and implemented by weighting or scaling the feature space before computing distances, a process equivalent to defining a Mahalanobis distance metric tailored to the theory being tested .

#### Adjudicating Between Competing Theories

In many scientific scenarios, multiple theories may offer plausible explanations for a given cognitive function, and their predictions can be confounded. RSA provides a powerful statistical framework for disentangling these competing accounts. A classic example in cognitive neuroscience is distinguishing the representation of high-level semantic categories (e.g., faces vs. tools) from confounding low-level visual features (e.g., [spatial frequency](@entry_id:270500), complexity) that may differ systematically between categories. A simple correlation between a neural RDM and a categorical model RDM is uninterpretable in this case, as the correlation could be driven entirely by the shared influence of low-level features.

To isolate the unique contribution of the categorical model, [multiple regression](@entry_id:144007) RSA or partial correlation is employed. In this approach, the neural RDM is modeled as a linear combination of multiple model RDMs—for instance, a target model (e.g., category) and one or more confound models (e.g., low-level features). The [regression coefficient](@entry_id:635881) or [partial correlation](@entry_id:144470) associated with the target model quantifies its unique explanatory power, after accounting for the [variance explained](@entry_id:634306) by the confounds. This allows researchers to ask precise questions, such as "Does this brain region represent object category over and above what can be explained by simple visual statistics?"  . When dealing with multiple, potentially correlated model RDMs, care must be taken to ensure the [identifiability](@entry_id:194150) of the model weights, as high collinearity between models can make their unique contributions difficult to estimate reliably .

#### Connecting Brains and Machines: Deep Neural Networks as Models

A major contemporary use of RSA is in comparing biological and artificial intelligence. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly deep [convolutional neural networks](@entry_id:178973) (CNNs), have emerged as the leading class of computational models for the primate [ventral visual stream](@entry_id:1133769). RSA provides an elegant method to quantitatively compare the internal representations of these networks to brain activity. For a given set of stimuli, an RDM is computed for each layer of the DNN, based on the pairwise dissimilarity of its activation patterns. These layer-wise RDMs can then be compared to neural RDMs from different stages of the visual hierarchy (e.g., V1, V4, IT cortex). This analysis has consistently revealed a striking correspondence: earlier layers of a CNN tend to have representational geometries similar to earlier areas of the visual cortex, while deeper layers better match higher-order visual areas. This allows researchers to use DNNs as testable, in-silico models of brain computation, examining how architectural features and learning objectives shape representations that mimic those of the brain  .

### Investigating Brain Networks and Inter-Individual Differences

RSA can be extended from characterizing single representational spaces to examining the relationships between them, both within and across individuals.

#### Representational Connectivity: Shared Codes Across Brain Regions

How do different brain regions coordinate their activity? One way to address this is by investigating whether they share a common "neural code." Representational connectivity analysis operationalizes this question by computing an RDM for two or more brain regions using the same set of experimental conditions. The similarity of the representational geometries is then quantified by correlating the RDMs from the different regions. A high correlation suggests that the regions organize information in a similar way, implying a shared coding scheme or direct information transfer between them. To ensure such comparisons are not biased by noise, it is critical to use unbiased dissimilarity estimators, such as cross-validated Mahalanobis distances. This approach allows researchers to map out brain-wide networks not based on raw activity correlation, but on the more abstract and powerful criterion of shared representational content .

#### Aligning Brains: Hyperalignment and Intersubject RSA

A significant challenge in neuroimaging is that the precise anatomical location of functional circuits can vary substantially across individuals. This anatomical variability can obscure commonalities in representational structure when data are simply averaged in a common anatomical space. Hyperalignment is a [functional alignment](@entry_id:1125376) technique that addresses this problem by projecting each subject's data into a common, high-dimensional representational space. It finds subject-specific transformations (typically rotations) that best align the neural response patterns to a shared stimulus (e.g., a movie). This creates a functionally meaningful common space that is not tied to anatomical landmarks. By performing RSA on these hyperaligned data, researchers can achieve dramatically higher inter-subject correlations of RDMs, revealing shared representational geometries that would otherwise be obscured by individual variability .

### Probing Fundamental Questions in Cognition and Evolution

The abstraction offered by RSA makes it an ideal tool for tackling some of the most profound questions in cognitive science and evolutionary biology.

#### The Neural Basis of Consciousness

A central question in science and philosophy is what distinguishes conscious from unconscious information processing in the brain. RSA can be used to formulate and test specific hypotheses about how neural representations are transformed when a stimulus enters conscious awareness. For example, one hypothesis is that while unconscious processing may be limited to low-level features, conscious perception is necessary for the emergence of robust, abstract categorical structure. This can be tested by creating separate neural RDMs for consciously perceived and unconsciously processed stimuli. By comparing how well a categorical model RDM fits the neural data in these two conditions—while rigorously controlling for confounds like signal-to-noise ratio and low-level stimulus features—researchers can obtain quantitative evidence for consciousness-dependent changes in representational geometry .

#### Comparative Neuroscience: Tracing the Evolution of Cognition

Are complex cognitive abilities in different species, such as the ability to estimate number (numerosity) in primates and birds, the result of a shared evolutionary origin (homology) or independent evolution of a similar solution (analogy)? RSA provides a key tool for addressing this question at the level of neural computation. While observing similar behavioral performance or single-neuron tuning curves is insufficient to distinguish homology from analogy, comparing the high-dimensional representational geometry across species offers a much richer and more constrained test. A research program might compare the RDMs from the primate prefrontal cortex and the avian nidopallium caudolaterale across a range of numerosity tasks. A strong, consistent match in the geometry of these representations, especially when integrated with [phylogenetic analysis](@entry_id:172534) of outgroups and developmental data, can provide powerful evidence for a homologous computational mechanism inherited from a common ancestor, going far beyond simple functional similarity  .

### Beyond Neuroscience: RSA in Other Scientific Disciplines

The power of RSA lies in its generality. At its core, it is a method for comparing the geometric structures of high-dimensional [vector spaces](@entry_id:136837). This concept is not unique to neuroscience and finds powerful applications in other fields, particularly in the interpretation of complex machine learning models.

For example, in materials science, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used to predict properties of crystalline structures, such as [formation energy](@entry_id:142642) or ionic [diffusion barriers](@entry_id:1123706). A key challenge in [transfer learning](@entry_id:178540) is to understand which layers of a GNN pre-trained on one task should be frozen or fine-tuned for a new task. RSA can be employed to answer this question. By treating the GNN's layer-wise embeddings of different materials as the representations, one can compute an RDM for each layer. This RDM can then be compared to a "label RDM" constructed from the pairwise differences in the target physical property (e.g., [diffusion barrier](@entry_id:148409)). By assessing how the alignment between the layer's RDM and the label RDM changes after [fine-tuning](@entry_id:159910), one can quantify the benefit of this learning process on a layer-by-layer basis. This application demonstrates that RSA is a domain-general tool for understanding and comparing the internal representational transformations within any complex information processing system, be it biological or artificial .

### Conclusion

As this chapter illustrates, Representational Similarity Analysis is far more than a single statistical technique; it is a flexible and integrative framework for scientific inquiry. It enables researchers to map the brain's functional architecture with unprecedented detail, to rigorously test and refine computational models of cognition, to investigate the structure of brain-wide networks, and to tackle fundamental questions about consciousness and evolution. Moreover, its core logic transcends the boundaries of neuroscience, providing a principled method for [model interpretability](@entry_id:171372) and comparison in machine learning and other data-intensive fields. By focusing on the abstract geometry of representations, RSA provides a unifying language to connect data, models, and theories across diverse scientific domains.
