            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the fixed point of a discrete-time affine dynamical system and the conditions for its existence and uniqueness. The analysis will be based on foundational definitions and principles of linear algebra.\n\nThe discrete-time dynamical system is described by the update equation:\n$$\nx_{t+1} = A x_t + u\n$$\nwhere $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the state vector of the neural population's mean firing rates at time $t$, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is the state transition matrix, and $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a constant input vector.\n\nBy definition, a fixed point, denoted $x^{\\star}$, is a state of the system that does not change over time. If the system is at the fixed point $x_t = x^{\\star}$, then the next state $x_{t+1}$ must also be $x^{\\star}$. Substituting $x^{\\star}$ into the update equation for both $x_t$ and $x_{t+1}$, we get the condition that defines the fixed point:\n$$\nx^{\\star} = A x^{\\star} + u\n$$\nThis equation is a system of linear equations for the unknown vector $x^{\\star}$. To solve for $x^{\\star}$, we can rearrange the terms by bringing all expressions involving $x^{\\star}$ to one side:\n$$\nx^{\\star} - A x^{\\star} = u\n$$\nWe can factor out $x^{\\star}$ by using the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I$:\n$$\nI x^{\\star} - A x^{\\star} = u\n$$\n$$\n(I - A) x^{\\star} = u\n$$\nThis is a standard linear system of the form $M y = b$, where the matrix is $M = (I - A)$, the unknown vector is $y = x^{\\star}$, and the constant vector is $b = u$.\n\nFrom the theory of linear algebra, a system of linear equations $My=b$ has a unique solution for any vector $b$ if and only if the matrix $M$ is invertible (or non-singular). In our case, this means that a unique fixed point $x^{\\star}$ exists if and only if the matrix $(I - A)$ is invertible.\n\nAssuming this condition holds, we can solve for $x^{\\star}$ by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse of $(I - A)$, which is denoted by $(I - A)^{-1}$:\n$$\n(I - A)^{-1} (I - A) x^{\\star} = (I - A)^{-1} u\n$$\nSince the product of a matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix $I$, we have:\n$$\nI x^{\\star} = (I - A)^{-1} u\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\star} = (I - A)^{-1} u\n$$\nThis is the symbolic closed-form expression for the unique fixed point of the system.\n\nNow, we must state the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of this fixed point and interpret it using the spectrum of matrix $A$. The condition, as established, is that the matrix $(I - A)$ must be invertible.\n\nA square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero, i.e., $\\det(I - A) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Therefore, a matrix is invertible if and only if none of its eigenvalues are zero. The condition for the uniqueness of $x^{\\star}$ is that all eigenvalues of the matrix $(I - A)$ must be non-zero.\n\nLet us relate the eigenvalues of $(I - A)$ to the eigenvalues of $A$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$ and $v$ be its corresponding eigenvector, such that $A v = \\lambda v$ and $v \\neq 0$. We now apply the matrix $(I - A)$ to the eigenvector $v$:\n$$\n(I - A) v = I v - A v = v - \\lambda v = (1 - \\lambda) v\n$$\nThis equation shows that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then $(1 - \\lambda)$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $(I - A)$, with the same eigenvector $v$.\n\nFor $(I - A)$ to be invertible, all of its eigenvalues must be non-zero. This means that for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in the spectrum of $A$, denoted $\\sigma(A)$, we must have:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda \\neq 0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition:\n$$\n\\lambda \\neq 1\n$$\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique fixed point $x^{\\star}$ is that the number $1$ is not an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. In other words, $1 \\notin \\sigma(A)$. If any eigenvalue of $A$ is equal to $1$, the matrix $(I - A)$ becomes singular, and the system either has no fixed points or an infinite number of fixed points (forming an affine subspace), depending on the vector $u$.",

This assumption means that the arguments to the functions $\\phi_E$ and $\\phi_I$ are greater than their respective thresholds, causing the $\\max(0, \\cdot)$ operator to be superfluous. Mathematically, the arguments of the nonlinearities are strictly positive.\n\nFor the $E$ population, the argument is its total input $x_E = w_{EE}\\,E - w_{EI}\\,I + b_{E}$. The linear regime assumption implies $g_E(x_E - \\theta_E) > 0$.

The $E$-nullcline is the set of points $(E, I)$ where $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$.

For a system described by ordinary differential equations, this requires that all time derivatives vanish at that point. Thus, a fixed point must satisfy $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$ simultaneously.\nThe $E$-nullcline is, by its own definition, the locus of all points $(E, I)$ for which $\\frac{dE}{dt}=0$. Similarly, the $I$-nullcline is the locus of all points for which $\\frac{dI}{dt}=0$.\nAn intersection of the $E$-nullcline and the $I$-nullcline is a point that, by virtue of being an intersection, lies on both curves. Consequently, any point at an intersection must satisfy both defining conditions, $\\frac{dE}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dI}{dt}=0$, at the same time. This is precisely the definition of a fixed point. Thus, the intersections of the nullclines are the fixed points of the system.\n\nTo find the fixed point(s) in the linear regime, we solve the system of linear equations formed by the two nullclines:\n1. $I = \\frac{1}{2}E + \\frac{2}{5}$\n2. $I = \\frac{3}{5}E + \\frac{3}{20}$\n\nEquating the expressions for $I$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}E + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}E + \\frac{3}{20}\n$$\nTo solve for $E$, we group the terms involving $E$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}E - \\frac{1}{2}E\n$$\nFinding common denominators:\n$$\n\\frac{8}{20} - \\frac{3}{20} = \\left(\\frac{6}{10} - \\frac{5}{10}\\right)E\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{10}E \\implies \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}E\n$$\nSolving for $E^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nE^{\\ast} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this value of $E^{\\ast}$ back into the equation for the $E$-nullcline to find $I^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nI^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}E^{\\ast} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\n$$\nI^{\\ast} = \\frac{25}{20} + \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{33}{20}\n$$\nThe coordinates of the fixed point are $(E^{\\ast}, I^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{33}{20}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that this fixed point is self-consistent with the linear regime assumption. We check the two inequalities:\n1. $w_{EE}E^{\\ast} - w_{EI}I^{\\ast} + b_{E} > \\theta_{E}$\n$$\n\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) - 1\\left(\\frac{33}{20}\\right) + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{15}{4} - \\frac{33}{20} + \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{75}{20} - \\frac{33}{20} + \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{54}{20} = \\frac{27}{10}\n$$\nThe condition is $\\frac{27}{10} > \\theta_{E} = \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10}$, which is true.\n\n2. $w_{IE}E^{\\ast} - w_{II}I^{\\ast} + b_{I} > \\theta_{I}$\n$$\n\\frac{6}{5}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) - 1\\left(\\frac{33}{20}\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} = 3 - \\frac{33}{20} + \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{60}{20} - \\frac{33}{20} + \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{35}{20} = \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\nThe condition is $\\frac{7}{4} > \\theta_{I} = \\frac{1}{10}$. Since $\\frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ and $\\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$, this is also true.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. Additionally, the activities must be non-negative, $E^{\\ast} = \\frac{5}{2} > 0$ and $I^{\\ast} = \\frac{33}{20} > 0$, consistent with the physical interpretation of firing rates. Therefore, the calculated fixed point is the unique fixed point in the assumed linear regime.\n\nThe third task is to report the fixed point as a row matrix.\nThe fixed point is $(E^{\\ast}, I^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{33}{20}\\right)$.",

The inactive set is $A^c = \\{2, 4\\}$.\nThe derivative matrix $D^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$ D^{\\ast} = \\text{diag}(\\phi'(0.5), \\phi'(-0.2), \\phi'(0.3), \\phi'(-0.1)) = \\text{diag}(1, 0, 1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1000 \\\\ 0000 \\\\ 0010 \\\\ 0000 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Jacobian is $J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}) = -I + WD^{\\ast}$:\n$$ J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}) = -\\begin{pmatrix} 1000 \\\\ 0100 \\\\ 0010 \\\\ 0001 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6  0.0  0.2  0.0\\\\ 0.1  0.0  -0.05  0.0\\\\ -0.1  0.0  0.7  0.0\\\\ 0.0  0.0  0.15  0.0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1000 \\\\ 0000 \\\\ 0010 \\\\ 0000 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}) = -I + \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6  0  0.2  0 \\\\ 0.1  0  -0.05  0 \\\\ -0.1  0  0.7  0 \\\\ 0.0  0  0.15  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.4  0  0.2  0 \\\\ 0.1  -1  -0.05  0 \\\\ -0.1  0  -0.3  0 \\\\ 0.0  0  0.15  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stability of the fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ is determined by the eigenvalues of $J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})$. Since the derived block form is block lower triangular, its eigenvalues are the union of the eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks: $(W_{AA} - I_{|A|})$ and $-I_{|A^c|}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $-I_{|A^c|}$, which corresponds to the inactive neurons $2$ and $4$, are simply $-1$ (with multiplicity $|A^c|=2$). These correspond to stable modes.\nThe stability of the fixed point is thus determined by the eigenvalues of the upper-left block, $W_{AA} - I_{|A|}$. The fixed point is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of this block have negative real parts. Let $\\lambda_{W_{AA}}$ be an eigenvalue of $W_{AA}$. An eigenvalue of $W_{AA} - I_{|A|}$ is $\\lambda_{W_{AA}} - 1$. For stability, we require $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{W_{AA}} - 1)  0$, which implies $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{W_{AA}})  1$. So, the stability of the fixed point hinges on whether all eigenvalues of the active sub-network connectivity matrix $W_{AA}$ have real parts less than $1$.\n\nFor our specific case, $A=\\{1,3\\}$, so we extract the corresponding submatrix from $W$:\n$$ W_{AA} = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{11}  W_{13} \\\\ W_{31}  W_{33} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6  0.2 \\\\ -0.1  0.7 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe block of the Jacobian corresponding to the active set is:\n$$ W_{AA} - I_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6-1  0.2 \\\\ -0.1  0.7-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.4  0.2 \\\\ -0.1  -0.3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe find the eigenvalues of this $2 \\times 2$ matrix by solving the characteristic equation $\\det((W_{AA} - I_2) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (-0.4 - \\lambda)(-0.3 - \\lambda) - (0.2)(-0.1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 0.7\\lambda + 0.12 + 0.02 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 0.7\\lambda + 0.14 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-0.7 \\pm \\sqrt{(0.7)^2 - 4(1)(0.14)}}{2} = \\frac{-0.7 \\pm \\sqrt{0.49 - 0.56}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-0.7 \\pm \\sqrt{-0.07}}{2} = \\frac{-0.7 \\pm i\\sqrt{0.07}}{2} = -0.35 \\pm i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.07}}{2} $$\nThe two eigenvalues from the active block are a complex conjugate pair with real part $-0.35$.\nThe other two eigenvalues, from the inactive block, are $-1$ and $-1$.\nThe complete set of eigenvalues for $J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})$ is $\\{-0.35 + i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.07}}{2}, -0.35 - i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.07}}{2}, -1, -1\\}$.\nThe real parts of these eigenvalues are $\\{-0.35, -0.35, -1, -1\\}$.\nThe largest real part among the eigenvalues (the spectral abscissa) is $-0.35$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-0.3500$.",
