He is hemodynamically stable but recovering from a recent intra-abdominal infection, representing a moderate physiologic stress. You are instructed to design a Parenteral Nutrition (PN) plan that meets both protein and energy requirements while accounting for malabsorption of the ongoing enteral regimen. Use the following patient-specific data and assumptions, each of which is consistent with well-tested clinical nutrition principles:\n\n- Baseline energy requirement is $30$ kilocalories per kilogram per day, and a stress multiplier of $1.1$ is appropriate for this patient’s current catabolic state.\n- Target protein density for this degree of stress is $1.4$ grams per kilogram per day.\n- Current enteral intake is $1500$ kilocalories per day and $40$ grams of protein per day.\n- Due to the end-jejunostomy, the fraction of enteral energy absorbed is $0.55$, and the fraction of enteral protein absorbed is $0.60$.\n- Parenterally delivered amino acids are assumed to be fully bioavailable and contribute $4$ kilocalories per gram toward total energy delivery.\n\nCompute the daily non-protein kilocalories that must be delivered via PN to meet the net energy requirement after accounting for both absorbed enteral energy and the energy contribution from parenterally delivered amino acids required to meet the protein target.

Electrolyte and Micronutrient Requirements**\n\nWe now calculate the daily requirements for electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements.\n\nSodium (Na): Replace measured jejunostomy losses plus maintenance.\n$$\\text{Na}_{\\text{loss}} = 2.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} \\times 95 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 266 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day}$$\n$$\\text{Na}_{\\text{maint}} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/kg} \\times 70 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 70 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day}$$\n$$\\text{Na}_{\\text{total}} = 266 + 70 = 336 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day}$$\nThis is provided as $50\\%$ sodium chloride and $50\\%$ sodium acetate.\n$$\\text{Na as NaCl} = 0.5 \\times 336 = 168 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/day}$$\n$$\\text{Na as NaOAc} = 0.5 \\times 336 = 168 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/day}$$\n\nPotassium (K): Replace estimated jejunostomy losses plus maintenance.\n$$\\text{K}_{\\text{loss}} = 2.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} \\times 15 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 42 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day}$$\n$$\\text{K}_{\\text{maint}} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/kg} \\times 70 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 70 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day}$$\n$$\\text{K}_{\\text{total}} = 42 + 70 = 112 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/day} \\, (\\text{or} \\, 112 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/day})$$\n\nPhosphate (P): The requirement is given as $30$ $\\mathrm{mmol/day}$, delivered as potassium phosphate.\n\nMagnesium (Mg): The requirement is $12$ $\\mathrm{mmol/day}$. As a divalent ion, this is $12 \\times 2 = 24$ $\\mathrm{mEq/day}$.\n\nCalcium (Ca): The requirement is $10$ $\\mathrm{mEq/day}$.\n\nTrace Elements  Vitamins:\nStandard trace elements: $1$ $\\mathrm{mL/day}$.\nAdditional Zinc: $12$ $\\mathrm{mg/L} \\times 2.8$ $\\mathrm{L} = 33.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nMultivitamin (MVI): $10$ $\\mathrm{mL/day}$.\nThiamine: $100$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\n**3. Volume Calculations**\n\nWe now convert the mass/molar amounts into volumes using the provided stock concentrations.\n\nAmino Acids ($10\\%$ or $0.10$ $\\mathrm{g/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{AA}} = \\frac{112.5 \\, \\mathrm{g}}{0.10 \\, \\mathrm{g/mL}} = 1125 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nDextrose ($70\\%$ or $0.70$ $\\mathrm{g/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{Dextrose}} = \\frac{320.59 \\, \\mathrm{g}}{0.70 \\, \\mathrm{g/mL}} \\approx 457.98 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nLipids ($20\\%$): Already calculated as $V_{\\text{lipid}} = 280$ $\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nSodium Chloride ($4$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{NaCl}} = \\frac{168 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}}{4 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 42 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nSodium Acetate ($2$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{NaOAc}} = \\frac{168 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}}{2 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 84 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nPotassium Phosphate ($3$ $\\mathrm{mmol/mL}$ P, $4.4$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$ K):\nTo get $30$ $\\mathrm{mmol}$ of Phosphate:\n$$V_{\\text{KPhos}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{mmol \\, P}}{3 \\, \\mathrm{mmol \\, P/mL}} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nThis provides $10 \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\times 4.4$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL} = 44$ $\\mathrm{mEq}$ of K.\n\nPotassium Chloride ($2$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$):\nThe remaining K needed is $112 - 44 = 68$ $\\mathrm{mEq}$.\n$$V_{\\text{KCl}} = \\frac{68 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}}{2 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 34 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nMagnesium Sulfate ($4$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{MgSO4}} = \\frac{24 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}}{4 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 6 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nCalcium Gluconate ($0.465$ $\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{CaGluc}} = \\frac{10 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}}{0.465 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/mL}} \\approx 21.51 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nTrace Elements (standard): $V_{\\text{trace}} = 1$ $\\mathrm{mL}$.\nZinc Chloride ($1$ $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{Zinc}} = \\frac{33.6 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{mg/mL}} = 33.6 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nMultivitamin (MVI): $V_{\\text{MVI}} = 10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$.\nThiamine ($100$ $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{Thiamine}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{mg/mL}} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**4. Final Volume and Infusion Rate**\n\nThe problem states that the final volume of the PN bag is to be $2.3$ $\\mathrm{L}$, which is equal to the net stool loss ($2.8$ $\\mathrm{L}$ output $- 0.5$ $\\mathrm{L}$ intake). Let's sum the component volumes to ensure this is feasible (i.e., the sum is less than $2.3$ $\\mathrm{L}$).\n$$V_{\\text{components}} = 1125 + 457.98 + 280 + 42 + 84 + 10 + 34 + 6 + 21.51 + 1 + 33.6 + 10 + 1 = 2106.09 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nSince $2106.09 \\, \\mathrm{mL}  2300 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$, the instruction to add sterile water to reach a final volume of $2.3$ $\\mathrm{L}$ is consistent.\n\nThe final volume ($V_{\\text{final}}$) and infusion time ($T$) are given:\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = 2.3 \\, \\mathrm{L} = 2300 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$T = 24 \\, \\mathrm{hr}$$\nThe infusion rate is calculated as:\n$$\\text{Rate} = \\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{T} = \\frac{2300 \\, \\mathrm{mL}}{24 \\, \\mathrm{hr}} = 95.8333... \\, \\mathrm{mL/hr}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the rate is $95.83$ $\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.",
