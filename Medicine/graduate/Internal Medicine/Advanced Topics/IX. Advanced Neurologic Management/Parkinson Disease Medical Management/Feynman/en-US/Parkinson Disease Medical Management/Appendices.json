This practice explores the fundamental pharmacokinetic principle of drug exposure, quantified by the Area Under the Curve ($AUC$), and its direct relevance to clinical outcomes.

            "problem": "A patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has motor fluctuations thought to be exacerbated by impaired levodopa absorption due to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. After confirmed eradication of H. pylori, pharmacokinetic profiling is repeated. Assume linear pharmacokinetics for levodopa over the clinically used dose range such that the exposure, quantified as Area Under the Curve (AUC), satisfies the fundamental relationship $AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$, where $F$ is oral bioavailability, $D$ is dose, and $CL$ is clearance, and assume $D$ and $CL$ are unchanged by eradication.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, a quantitative calculation of the change in levodopa exposure, and second, a qualitative justification of the clinical significance of this change. The analysis will be performed based on the provided pharmacokinetic parameters and principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Absolute Increase in AUC**\n\nThe problem is grounded in the fundamental linear pharmacokinetic relationship for Area Under the Curve ($AUC$), which represents total drug exposure over a dosing interval. This relationship is given as:\n$$AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$\nwhere $F$ is the oral bioavailability, $D$ is the administered dose, and $CL$ is the systemic clearance of the drug.\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Baseline (pre-eradication) $AUC$, denoted as $AUC_{\\text{pre}}$, is $100 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$.\n-   Post-eradication, the exposure increases by $20\\,\\%$.\n-   The dose $D$ and clearance $CL$ are assumed to be constant.\n\nThe increase in exposure ($AUC$) must therefore be due to an increase in bioavailability ($F$), which is consistent with the clinical scenario of resolving an absorption issue (impaired absorption due to *H. pylori* infection).\n\nLet $AUC_{\\text{post}}$ be the Area Under the Curve after eradication of *H. pylori*. The problem states that this value is $20\\,\\%$ greater than the baseline value. We can express this mathematically as:\n$$AUC_{\\text{post}} = AUC_{\\text{pre}} + 0.20 \\cdot AUC_{\\text{pre}}$$\n$$AUC_{\\text{post}} = 1.20 \\cdot AUC_{\\text{pre}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $AUC_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$AUC_{\\text{post}} = 1.20 \\cdot (100 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}) = 120 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute increase in $AUC$, which is defined as $\\Delta AUC = AUC_{\\text{post}} - AUC_{\\text{pre}}$.\n$$\\Delta AUC = 120 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L} - 100 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$$\n$$\\Delta AUC = 20 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $20$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $20.0$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of Clinical Meaningfulness**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a justification of whether a $20\\,\\%$ increase in levodopa $AUC$ is likely to be clinically meaningful for a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\n1.  **Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) Relationship in PD**: Levodopa therapy is characterized by a direct relationship between its plasma concentration and its therapeutic effect on motor symptoms. The total exposure, quantified by $AUC$, is a critical determinant of the overall clinical response. An increase in $AUC$ generally leads to improved motor control, such as a reduction in \"off\" time (periods of poor mobility). However, levodopa also has a narrow therapeutic window. Concentrations that are too high can induce or worsen peak-dose dyskinesias (involuntary movements).\n\n2.  **Equivalence to Dose Adjustment**: The fundamental $AUC$ equation, $AUC = (F \\cdot D)/CL$, shows that under the assumption of constant clearance ($CL$), $AUC$ is directly proportional to the product of bioavailability and dose ($F \\cdot D$). An increase in bioavailability ($F$) by a certain factor has the same effect on $AUC$ as increasing the dose ($D$) by the same factor. Therefore, a $20\\,\\%$ increase in $AUC$ resulting from improved bioavailability is pharmacokinetically equivalent to a $20\\,\\%$ increase in the levodopa dose.\n\n3.  **Magnitude of Change in Clinical Context**: In the clinical management of PD, clinicians frequently adjust levodopa dosages to optimize motor control. These adjustments are often in the range of $10-25\\,\\%$ of the total daily dose. Since a $20\\,\\%$ increase in exposure is comparable to a standard dose titration step, it is highly probable that such a change will produce a discernible and clinically meaningful alteration in the patient's symptoms.\n\n4.  **Relevance to Motor Fluctuations**: The patient in question experiences motor fluctuations, a common complication in advanced PD. These fluctuations are often linked to variable gastrointestinal absorption of levodopa and the resulting unstable plasma concentrations. By eradicating *H. pylori*, the underlying cause of impaired absorption is addressed, leading to more reliable and complete absorption. The resulting $20\\,\\%$ increase in $AUC$ reflects not only a higher total exposure but likely a more consistent absorption profile, leading to higher and more stable plasma concentrations throughout the dosing interval. This can directly ameliorate motor fluctuations by extending \"on\" time and reducing the frequency and duration of \"off\" episodes.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Clinical Significance**: A $20\\,\\%$ increase in levodopa $AUC$ is a substantial pharmacokinetic change. It is well within the range that would be expected to produce a clinically significant effect, either beneficial (improved motor control) or adverse (dyskinesias). For a patient with motor fluctuations, this change is particularly relevant and is very likely to translate into improved motor stability. Consequently, the patient would require close clinical monitoring following the change, and a physician might consider a pre-emptive or reactive reduction in the prescribed levodopa dose to accommodate the increased bioavailability and prevent the emergence of peak-dose dyskinesias. The absence of a universal $AUC$-based cutoff does not negate the high likelihood of clinical significance based on these established PK-PD principles.",

This exercise introduces the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) as a vital clinical tool for maintaining therapeutic continuity. You will practice a straightforward but critical calculation: converting a daily oral levodopa dose to an equivalent dose of a transdermal rotigotine patch, ensuring that the patient continues to receive the necessary dopaminergic stimulation to prevent acute motor decline .",

            "problem": "A hospitalized patient with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease is temporarily nil per os (NPO) for a planned procedure. To avoid withdrawal of dopaminergic stimulation, you are instructed to substitute their usual oral levodopa with a transdermal dopamine agonist. The patient’s current total daily levodopa dose is $600$ mg. For this substitution, use the widely applied Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) framework, which assumes that maintaining total daily dopaminergic stimulation prevents acute motor worsening. You are provided with the following well-tested equivalence used in clinical practice: a rotigotine transdermal patch delivering $4$ mg per $24$ h approximates the dopaminergic effect of $200$ mg of levodopa over the same interval. Assume linear proportionality within this dose range, ignore the contribution of carbidopa, and assume no other dopaminergic agents are being taken.\n\nUsing only these assumptions, compute the single rotigotine patch delivery rate in mg per $24$ h that would approximate the patient’s levodopa exposure.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of an equivalent dose of a transdermal rotigotine patch for a patient currently treated with oral levodopa. The basis for this conversion is the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) framework, which is founded on the principle of maintaining a constant level of dopaminergic stimulation. The problem provides all necessary data and assumptions for this calculation.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables involved.\nLet $D_{LD}$ represent the total daily dose of levodopa in units of mg.\nLet $D_{RTG}$ represent the delivery rate of the rotigotine patch in units of mg per $24$ hours.\n\nThe problem states that there is a linear proportionality between the equivalent doses of levodopa and rotigotine. This relationship can be expressed as a constant ratio:\n$$ \\frac{D_{RTG}}{D_{LD}} = \\text{constant} $$\nThis constant can be determined from the provided clinical equivalence data. The problem states that a rotigotine patch delivering $D_{RTG,ref} = 4$ mg per $24$ h provides dopaminergic stimulation equivalent to $D_{LD,ref} = 200$ mg of levodopa.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to find the unknown rotigotine dose for the patient. Let $D_{LD,patient}$ be the patient's current total daily levodopa dose and $D_{RTG,patient}$ be the target equivalent rotigotine patch delivery rate.\nThe patient's current dose is given as:\n$$ D_{LD,patient} = 600 \\text{ mg} $$\nUsing the principle of proportionality, we can write the following equation:\n$$ \\frac{D_{RTG,patient}}{D_{LD,patient}} = \\frac{D_{RTG,ref}}{D_{LD,ref}} $$\nOur goal is to solve for $D_{RTG,patient}$. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n$$ D_{RTG,patient} = D_{LD,patient} \\times \\frac{D_{RTG,ref}}{D_{LD,ref}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$ D_{LD,patient} = 600 \\text{ mg} $$\n$$ D_{RTG,ref} = 4 \\text{ mg per 24 h} $$\n$$ D_{LD,ref} = 200 \\text{ mg} $$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ D_{RTG,patient} = (600 \\text{ mg}) \\times \\frac{4 \\text{ mg per 24 h}}{200 \\text{ mg}} $$\nThe units of mg for the levodopa dose cancel out, leaving the desired units of mg per $24$ h for the rotigotine delivery rate.\n$$ D_{RTG,patient} = 600 \\times \\frac{4}{200} \\text{ mg per 24 h} $$\nSimplifying the numerical part of the expression:\n$$ D_{RTG,patient} = 3 \\times 4 \\text{ mg per 24 h} $$\n$$ D_{RTG,patient} = 12 \\text{ mg per 24 h} $$\nThe question requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

This capstone practice synthesizes the concept of the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) in a realistic, advanced clinical scenario. You will calculate the total dopaminergic load for a patient on polypharmacy and, most importantly, use this quantitative assessment to inform a sophisticated clinical decision, balancing the treatment of \"wearing-off\" phenomena against the risk of inducing peak-dose dyskinesia .",
            "id": "4880853",
            "problem": "A $67$-year-old person with a $10$-year history of Parkinson’s disease presents with daytime “wearing-off” and prominent peak-dose dyskinesia. Current medications are immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa $25/100$ mg, $1.5$ tablets taken $5$ times daily; controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa $50/200$ mg, $1$ tablet at bedtime; entacapone $200$ mg taken with each levodopa dose; pramipexole $0.35$ mg three times daily; and rasagiline $1$ mg once daily. The motor response remains levodopa-responsive but is complicated by dyskinesia. The clinician wishes to use the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) to standardize the dopaminergic exposure across the regimen and to guide the next management step.\n\nAssume the following well-tested potency relationships derived from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations in Parkinson’s disease:\n- Immediate-release levodopa contributes in a $1{:}1$ manner to LEDD (that is, $1$ mg immediate-release levodopa contributes $1$ mg LEDD).\n- Controlled-release levodopa provides reduced bioavailability and clinical potency, contributing approximately $0.75$ mg LEDD per $1$ mg of levodopa content.\n- Dopamine agonists have the following approximate levodopa-equivalent potencies: pramipexole $1$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD; ropinirole $1$ mg $\\approx 20$ mg LEDD; rotigotine $1$ mg $\\approx 30$ mg LEDD.\n- Monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors have the following approximate levodopa-equivalent potencies: rasagiline $1$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD; oral selegiline $10$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n- Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition with entacapone increases levodopa’s effect by approximately $33\\%$ of the associated levodopa dose (that is, add $0.33 \\times$ the levodopa dose taken with entacapone to the LEDD). For tolcapone or opicapone, the increment is often approximated as $50\\%$.\n\nWhich option best defines LEDD, correctly applies the above potency relationships to compute this patient’s LEDD, and most appropriately situates LEDD in the ensuing clinical decision-making?\n\nA. LEDD is the sum of levodopa-equivalent contributions across all dopaminergic agents, using empirically derived potency ratios. For this regimen: immediate-release levodopa = $1.5 \\times 100 \\text{ mg} \\times 5 = 750 \\text{ mg}$; controlled-release levodopa = $200 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.75 = 150 \\text{ mg}$; entacapone increment = $0.33 \\times (750 + 200) \\approx 313.5 \\text{ mg}$; pramipexole = $0.35 \\text{ mg} \\times 3 = 1.05 \\text{ mg} \\Rightarrow 1.05 \\times 100 \\approx 105 \\text{ mg}$; rasagiline = $1 \\times 100 = 100 \\text{ mg}$; total LEDD $\\approx 750 + 150 + 313.5 + 105 + 100 \\approx 1{,}420 \\text{ mg}$. Given disabling peak-dose dyskinesia at a high LEDD, avoid further dopaminergic escalation; reduce per-dose levodopa and/or discontinue entacapone to lower LEDD while smoothing delivery (shorter intervals), and consider amantadine for dyskinesia or device-aided therapy if fluctuations persist.\n\nB. LEDD is simply the total milligrams of levodopa administered per day; adjuncts are not counted. For this regimen, LEDD $\\approx 750$ mg $+$ $200$ mg $= 950$ mg. Because this is below typical thresholds for dyskinesia, the appropriate next step is to increase immediate-release levodopa to at least $1{,}200$ mg LEDD to reduce wearing-off.\n\nC. LEDD sums dopaminergic exposures but pramipexole $1$ mg contributes $20$ mg LEDD and rasagiline $1$ mg contributes $10$ mg LEDD; controlled-release levodopa is equivalent to immediate-release, and entacapone’s effect applies only to immediate-release doses. Thus, LEDD $\\approx 750$ mg (immediate-release) $+ 200$ mg (controlled-release) $+ 0.33 \\times 750 \\approx 247.5$ mg $+ (1.05 \\times 20 \\approx 21)$ mg $+ 10$ mg $\\approx 1{,}230$ mg. Because wearing-off is present, add ropinirole to increase LEDD and smooth motor fluctuations.\n\nD. LEDD is the sum of dopaminergic contributions, and entacapone multiplies the entire regimen’s LEDD by $1.33$. Base levodopa LEDD $= 750$ mg $+ 150$ mg $= 900$ mg; pramipexole $= 105$ mg; rasagiline $= 100$ mg; subtotal $= 1{,}105$ mg; after entacapone, LEDD $\\approx 1{,}105 \\times 1.33 \\approx 1{,}470$ mg. Because the LEDD is excessive, first stop rasagiline to reduce LEDD and then increase levodopa to maintain motor control.",
            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the patient and their medication regimen:\n- Age: $67$ years\n- Disease history: $10$-year history of Parkinson’s disease\n- Clinical presentation: Daytime “wearing-off” and prominent peak-dose dyskinesia.\n- Current medications:\n    - Immediate-release (IR) carbidopa/levodopa $25/100$ mg: $1.5$ tablets, $5$ times daily.\n    - Controlled-release (CR) carbidopa/levodopa $50/200$ mg: $1$ tablet at bedtime.\n    - Entacapone $200$ mg: taken with each levodopa dose.\n    - Pramipexole $0.35$ mg: three times daily.\n    - Rasagiline $1$ mg: once daily.\n\nThe problem also provides a set of explicit assumptions for calculating the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD):\n- IR levodopa contribution to LEDD: $1:1$ ratio ($1$ mg of levodopa equates to $1$ mg LEDD).\n- CR levodopa contribution to LEDD: Multiplier of $0.75$ ($1$ mg of levodopa equates to $0.75$ mg LEDD).\n- Dopamine Agonist Equivalencies:\n    - Pramipexole: $1$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n    - Ropinirole: $1$ mg $\\approx 20$ mg LEDD.\n    - Rotigotine: $1$ mg $\\approx 30$ mg LEDD.\n- Monoamine Oxidase type B (MAO-B) Inhibitor Equivalencies:\n    - Rasagiline: $1$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n    - Oral Selegiline: $10$ mg $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n- Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Inhibitor Effect:\n    - Entacapone: Increases levodopa's effect by approximately $33\\%$ of the associated levodopa dose (add $0.33 \\times$ [levodopa dose taken with entacapone] to the LEDD).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the established clinical pharmacology of Parkinson's disease management. The concept of LEDD is a widely used, albeit not perfectly standardized, tool in clinical practice and research to quantify total dopaminergic medication load. The provided conversion factors are within the range of published values, and the problem makes them explicit assumptions, transforming the task into a well-defined calculation and reasoning problem.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (patient's full medication regimen) and a complete set of rules (potency relationships) to calculate a specific quantity (LEDD). The question is clear, asking for the correct calculation and the most appropriate clinical interpretation. A unique numerical solution for LEDD can be derived from the givens. A minor ambiguity exists in the phrase \"levodopa dose taken with entacapone,\" but one interpretation is strongly supported by the correct option's calculation, and is a common simplification in clinical practice (applying the factor to the total daily levodopa dose for a patient on a COMT inhibitor).\n- **Objective**: The problem is expressed in objective, clinical language. It describes a patient case and provides a set of facts and rules for calculation. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements in the problem setup.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard clinical calculation and reasoning task based on a set of explicit assumptions. The problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to calculate the patient's total Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) based on the provided regimen and conversion factors, and then to evaluate the clinical reasoning presented in each option.\n\n1.  **Contribution from Immediate-Release (IR) Carbidopa/Levodopa:**\n    - Levodopa per tablet: $100$ mg.\n    - Tablets per dose: $1.5$.\n    - Doses per day: $5$.\n    - Total daily IR levodopa = $100$ mg/tablet $\\times 1.5$ tablets/dose $\\times 5$ doses/day = $750$ mg.\n    - The conversion factor is $1:1$.\n    - LEDD from IR levodopa = $750$ mg.\n\n2.  **Contribution from Controlled-Release (CR) Carbidopa/Levodopa:**\n    - Levodopa per tablet: $200$ mg.\n    - Tablets per day: $1$.\n    - Total daily CR levodopa = $200$ mg.\n    - The conversion factor is $0.75$.\n    - LEDD from CR levodopa = $200$ mg $\\times 0.75 = 150$ mg.\n\n3.  **Contribution from Pramipexole (Dopamine Agonist):**\n    - Dose: $0.35$ mg.\n    - Doses per day: $3$.\n    - Total daily pramipexole = $0.35$ mg/dose $\\times 3$ doses/day = $1.05$ mg.\n    - The conversion factor is $1$ mg pramipexole $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n    - LEDD from pramipexole = $1.05$ mg $\\times 100$ mg LEDD/mg = $105$ mg.\n\n4.  **Contribution from Rasagiline (MAO-B Inhibitor):**\n    - Dose: $1$ mg.\n    - Doses per day: $1$.\n    - Total daily rasagiline = $1$ mg.\n    - The conversion factor is $1$ mg rasagiline $\\approx 100$ mg LEDD.\n    - LEDD from rasagiline = $1$ mg $\\times 100$ mg LEDD/mg = $100$ mg.\n\n5.  **Contribution from Entacapone (COMT Inhibitor):**\n    - The rule is: \"add $0.33 \\times$ the levodopa dose taken with entacapone to the LEDD\".\n    - The regimen states entacapone is taken \"with each levodopa dose\". This indicates that the presence of entacapone in the regimen is intended to potentiate the levodopa. The \"associated levodopa dose\" is thus the total daily levodopa administered.\n    - Total daily levodopa = Total IR levodopa + Total CR levodopa = $750$ mg $+ 200$ mg $= 950$ mg.\n    - LEDD increment from entacapone = $0.33 \\times 950$ mg $= 313.5$ mg.\n\n6.  **Total LEDD Calculation:**\n    - Total LEDD is the sum of the contributions from each component.\n    - Total LEDD = (LEDD from IR L-dopa) + (LEDD from CR L-dopa) + (LEDD from pramipexole) + (LEDD from rasagiline) + (LEDD increment from entacapone).\n    - Total LEDD = $750$ mg $+ 150$ mg $+ 105$ mg $+ 100$ mg $+ 313.5$ mg.\n    - Total LEDD = $1418.5$ mg.\n    - This is approximately $1420$ mg.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. LEDD is the sum of levodopa-equivalent contributions across all dopaminergic agents, using empirically derived potency ratios. For this regimen: immediate-release levodopa = $1.5 \\times 100 \\text{ mg} \\times 5 = 750 \\text{ mg}$; controlled-release levodopa = $200 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.75 = 150 \\text{ mg}$; entacapone increment = $0.33 \\times (750 + 200) \\approx 313.5 \\text{ mg}$; pramipexole = $0.35 \\text{ mg} \\times 3 = 1.05 \\text{ mg} \\Rightarrow 1.05 \\times 100 \\approx 105 \\text{ mg}$; rasagiline = $1 \\times 100 = 100 \\text{ mg}$; total LEDD $\\approx 750 + 150 + 313.5 + 105 + 100 \\approx 1,420 \\text{ mg}$. Given disabling peak-dose dyskinesia at a high LEDD, avoid further dopaminergic escalation; reduce per-dose levodopa and/or discontinue entacapone to lower LEDD while smoothing delivery (shorter intervals), and consider amantadine for dyskinesia or device-aided therapy if fluctuations persist.**\n- **Definition and Calculation**: The definition of LEDD is correct. The step-by-step calculation precisely matches the derivation above, arriving at a total LEDD of $\\approx 1420$ mg. It correctly applies all conversion factors given in the problem.\n- **Clinical Reasoning**: The patient has \"prominent peak-dose dyskinesia\" and a calculated high LEDD ($\\approx 1420$ mg). The proposed management is clinically sound: avoid increasing dopaminergic load, reduce peak effects by lowering per-dose levodopa or removing the potentiating agent (entacapone), smooth delivery with smaller, more frequent doses, add an antidyskinetic agent (amantadine), and consider advanced therapies (device-aided) for refractory problems. This is the standard, evidence-based approach.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. LEDD is simply the total milligrams of levodopa administered per day; adjuncts are not counted. For this regimen, LEDD $\\approx 750$ mg $+$ $200$ mg $= 950$ mg. Because this is below typical thresholds for dyskinesia, the appropriate next step is to increase immediate-release levodopa to at least $1{,}200$ mg LEDD to reduce wearing-off.**\n- **Definition and Calculation**: The definition of LEDD is incorrect as it ignores adjunct therapies, contradicting the problem's premise. The calculation, based on this false premise, is arithmetically correct ($750 + 200 = 950$), but does not represent the true LEDD.\n- **Clinical Reasoning**: The reasoning is based on an erroneously low LEDD. The recommendation to increase the levodopa dose would directly worsen the patient's primary complaint of \"prominent peak-dose dyskinesia.\" This is inappropriate and potentially harmful advice.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. LEDD sums dopaminergic exposures but pramipexole $1$ mg contributes $20$ mg LEDD and rasagiline $1$ mg contributes $10$ mg LEDD; controlled-release levodopa is equivalent to immediate-release, and entacapone’s effect applies only to immediate-release doses. Thus, LEDD $\\approx 750$ mg (immediate-release) $+ 200$ mg (controlled-release) $+ 0.33 \\times 750 \\approx 247.5$ mg $+ (1.05 \\times 20 \\approx 21)$ mg $+ 10$ mg $\\approx 1{,}230$ mg. Because wearing-off is present, add ropinirole to increase LEDD and smooth motor fluctuations.**\n- **Calculation**: This option uses several conversion factors that directly contradict the givens in the problem statement. Specifically, it uses incorrect factors for pramipexole, rasagiline, and CR levodopa.\n- **Clinical Reasoning**: The plan to add another dopamine agonist (ropinirole) would increase the LEDD, which is contraindicated in a patient with prominent peak-dose dyskinesia. The primary goal should be to manage the dyskinesia, not simply increase dopaminergic tone.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. LEDD is the sum of dopaminergic contributions, and entacapone multiplies the entire regimen’s LEDD by $1.33$. Base levodopa LEDD $= 750$ mg $+ 150$ mg $= 900$ mg; pramipexole $= 105$ mg; rasagiline $= 100$ mg; subtotal $= 1{,}105$ mg; after entacapone, LEDD $\\approx 1{,}105 \\times 1.33 \\approx 1{,}470$ mg. Because the LEDD is excessive, first stop rasagiline to reduce LEDD and then increase levodopa to maintain motor control.**\n- **Calculation**: The method for applying the entacapone effect is incorrect. The rule is to add an increment based on the *levodopa dose* ($0.33 \\times 950$ mg), not to multiply the *total LEDD* from all drugs by $1.33$. Entacapone does not potentiate dopamine agonists or MAO-B inhibitors.\n- **Clinical Reasoning**: The advice is internally contradictory.
