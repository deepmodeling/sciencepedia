            "problem": "A 32-year-old adult presents with thermal burns involving the entire circumference of the left upper extremity from the deltoid to the fingertips and the entire anterior trunk. A 3-year-old pediatric patient presents later with an identical distribution of burns. In both cases, only burns of at least partial thickness are to be counted toward the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). Using the Wallace Rule of Nines for the adult and the Lund-Browder chart for the pediatric patient, compute the fraction of TBSA burned for each patient.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- The Rule of Nines (adult) assigns the entire anterior trunk a value of $18$ and each entire arm a value of $9$ of the total body surface area.\n- The Lund-Browder chart (pediatric) adjusts body segment proportions by age due to differences in head and leg proportions, but retains the arm and trunk segment proportions equal to adult values by $3$ years of age. For a $3$-year-old, each entire arm is $9$ and the entire anterior trunk is $18$ of total body surface area.\n\nTasks:\n- Compute the adult burned fraction of TBSA from first principles by summing the appropriate segment fractions.\n- Compute the pediatric burned fraction of TBSA using age-appropriate Lund-Browder assignments for the same segments.\n\nExpress both answers as unitless decimal fractions of total body surface area. Provide the adult value first and the pediatric value second as a two-entry row matrix. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The goal is to compute the fraction of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burned for each patient by summing the fractional contributions of the involved anatomical segments. The Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) is defined as the entirety of external body surface, and burn assessment methods partition this surface into segments with empirically derived proportional values. The Wallace Rule of Nines is a well-tested method for adults, and the Lund-Browder chart is a validated age-adjusted method for children that preserves the principle of partitioning while modifying proportions to reflect pediatric anthropometry.\n\nFor the adult:\n- The Rule of Nines assigns the entire anterior trunk a fractional contribution of $18$ out of $100$, and each entire arm a fractional contribution of $9$ out of $100$. Since we must express percentage-type quantities as decimals, these correspond to $0.18$ for the anterior trunk and $0.09$ for one entire arm.\n- The adult has burns affecting the entire left arm and the entire anterior trunk. There is no involvement of other segments.\n\nTherefore, the adult burned fraction of TBSA is\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{adult}} = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27.\n$$\n\nFor the pediatric patient aged $3$ years:\n- The Lund-Browder chart adjusts segment proportions by age, primarily altering the head and legs, because pediatric patients have proportionally larger heads and smaller legs compared to adults. However, well-established charts indicate that by approximately $3$ years of age, the arm and trunk proportions are the same as adult values for purposes of TBSA allocation. Specifically, for a $3$-year-old, the entire anterior trunk is $18$ out of $100$, and each entire arm is $9$ out of $100$, corresponding to decimal fractions $0.18$ and $0.09$, respectively.\n- The pediatric patient has burns affecting the same segments: one entire arm and the entire anterior trunk.\n\nThus, the pediatric burned fraction of TBSA is\n$$\n\\mathrm{TBSA}_{\\text{pediatric}} = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27.\n$$\n\nWe are asked to present the adult value first and the pediatric value second as a row matrix. Both values are unitless decimal fractions of total body surface area, and no rounding is required. Hence, the final two-entry row matrix is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.27 & 0.27\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$",

The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and rules for calculation are explicitly stated, leading to a single, verifiable solution. The language is objective and precise.

A score of $1$ is assigned for each criterion that is met.\n\n1.  **Age > 40 years:** The patient's age is $58$ years. Since $58 > 40$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n2.  **Presence of malignancy:** The patient has a \"known active metastatic solid-organ malignancy\". Thus, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n3.  **Heart rate > 120 beats/minute:** The patient's heart rate is $128$ beats/minute. Since $128 > 120$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n4.  **Initial epidermal detachment > 10%:** The patient's epidermal detachment is $35\\%$. Since $35 > 10$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n5.  **Serum urea > 10 mmol/L:** The patient's serum urea is $12$ mmol/L. Since $12 > 10$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n6.  **Serum glucose > 14 mmol/L:** The patient's serum glucose is $16$ mmol/L. Since $16 > 14$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n7.  **Serum bicarbonate < 20 mmol/L:** The patient's serum bicarbonate is $18$ mmol/L. Since $18 < 20$, this criterion is met. The score for this component is $1$.\n\nThe total SCORTEN is the sum of the scores for each component:\n$$ \\text{SCORTEN} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 $$\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of Predicted Mortality**\nThe calculated SCORTEN of $7$ is used to determine the predicted mortality based on the provided mapping. The relevant mapping rule is for SCORTEN $\\geq 5$.\n\n- SCORTEN $0$–$1 \\mapsto 0.032$\n- SCORTEN $2 \\mapsto 0.121$\n- SCORTEN $3 \\mapsto 0.358$\n- SCORTEN $4 \\mapsto 0.583$\n- SCORTEN $\\geq 5 \\mapsto 0.900$\n\nSince the calculated score is $7$, and $7 \\geq 5$, the predicted mortality corresponds to the last category.\nThe predicted mortality is $0.900$. This value is already expressed to three significant figures as requested.\n\nThe final answer is reported as a row matrix containing the SCORTEN and the predicted mortality.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{SCORTEN}, & \\text{predicted mortality} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7, & 0.900 \\end{pmatrix} $$",

The use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate renal function, and the subsequent dose adjustment of renally-cleared drugs like acyclovir and vancomycin, is a standard and critical practice in medicine. The pharmacokinetic targets ($C_{ss,avg}$ and $AUC_{24}/MIC$) are conventional metrics for assessing drug exposure and efficacy. The clinical scenario is realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary patient data ($Age$, $W$, $SCr$) to calculate the required parameter ($CrCl$). The objectives for dose adjustment are clearly and unambiguously defined for each drug. Sufficient information is provided to establish a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased medical and mathematical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It explicitly states the formula to use (Cockcroft-Gault), the assumptions to make ($CL \\propto CrCl$), and the goals to achieve. There are no internal contradictions. The patient's data are plausible for the described clinical state.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically sound exercise in applied pharmacokinetics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe solution requires a three-step process: first, calculating the patient's estimated creatinine clearance; second, adjusting the acyclovir dosing interval; and third, adjusting the vancomycin per-dose amount.\n\n### 1. Estimation of Creatinine Clearance ($CrCl_{pt}$)\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation for estimating creatinine clearance in adult males is:\n$$CrCl \\ (\\mathrm{mL/min}) = \\frac{(140 - Age) \\times Weight\\ (\\mathrm{kg})}{72 \\times SCr\\ (\\mathrm{mg/dL})}$$\nUsing the patient's data: $Age = 62$ years, $Weight = 78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and $SCr = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n$$CrCl_{pt} = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 78}{72 \\times 2.5} = \\frac{78 \\times 78}{180} = \\frac{6084}{180} = 33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\nThis value represents the patient's estimated renal function, which will be used to scale the drug regimens.\n\n### 2. Acyclovir Dosing Interval Adjustment\nThe goal for acyclovir is to maintain the same steady-state average concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) as a person with normal renal function. The formula for $C_{ss,avg}$ for an intravenously administered drug is:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{D}{CL \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $D$ is the dose, $CL$ is the systemic clearance, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval. We set the patient's average concentration equal to the normal reference concentration:\n$$C_{ss,avg,pt} = C_{ss,avg,norm}$$\n$$\\frac{D_{pt}}{CL_{pt} \\times \\tau_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{norm}}{CL_{norm} \\times \\tau_{norm}}$$\nThe problem states that the per-dose amount is held fixed, so $D_{pt} = D_{norm}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$CL_{pt} \\times \\tau_{pt} = CL_{norm} \\times \\tau_{norm}$$\nSolving for the patient's adjusted dosing interval, $\\tau_{pt}$:\n$$\\tau_{pt} = \\tau_{norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{norm}}{CL_{pt}}$$\nThe problem states that drug clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance ($CL \\propto CrCl$). Therefore, the ratio of clearances is equal to the ratio of creatinine clearances:\n$$\\frac{CL_{norm}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{CrCl_{norm}}{CrCl_{pt}}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\tau_{pt}$:\n$$\\tau_{pt} = \\tau_{norm} \\times \\frac{CrCl_{norm}}{CrCl_{pt}}$$\nUsing the given and calculated values: $\\tau_{norm} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $CrCl_{norm} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$, and $CrCl_{pt} = 33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n$$\\tau_{pt} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 8 \\times \\frac{100}{33.8} \\approx 23.668639\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjusted acyclovir interval is $23.67\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n### 3. Vancomycin Per-Dose Amount Adjustment\nThe goal for vancomycin is to maintain the same $24$-hour AUC/MIC ratio. Since $MIC$ is constant, this is equivalent to maintaining the same $AUC_{24}$. The $AUC$ over a $24$-hour period is given by the total dose administered in $24$ hours divided by the drug's clearance:\n$$AUC_{24} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h}}{CL}$$\nWe set the patient's $AUC_{24}$ equal to the normal reference $AUC_{24}$:\n$$AUC_{24,pt} = AUC_{24,norm}$$\n$$\\frac{D_{total, 24h, pt}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h, norm}}{CL_{norm}}$$\nSolving for the patient's total daily dose:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = D_{total, 24h, norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{pt}}{CL_{norm}}$$\nUsing the proportionality $CL \\propto CrCl$:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = D_{total, 24h, norm} \\times \\frac{CrCl_{pt}}{CrCl_{norm}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the normal total daily dose. The per-dose amount is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, and the interval is $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$D_{norm, per\\_dose} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 78\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 1170\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nSince the interval is $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, there are two doses in $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$D_{total, 24h, norm} = 1170\\,\\mathrm{mg/dose} \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{doses} = 2340\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nNow we can calculate the patient's required total daily dose:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = 2340\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 2340 \\times 0.338 = 790.92\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis total daily dose must be administered over the fixed $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ interval, meaning two doses per day. The adjusted per-dose amount, $D_{pt, per\\_dose}$, is half of the total daily dose:\n$$D_{pt, per\\_dose} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h, pt}}{2} = \\frac{790.92\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 395.46\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjusted vancomycin dose is $395.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n1.  Adjusted Acyclovir Interval: $23.67\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n2.  Adjusted Vancomycin Dose: $395.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",
