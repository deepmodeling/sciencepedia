            "problem": "A 14-year-old recipient with severe aplastic anemia is scheduled for umbilical cord blood transplantation. A selection committee uses the minimum total nucleated cell (TNC) dose per kilogram as the primary quantitative threshold for feasibility. The minimum acceptable dose is $2.5\\times 10^{7}$ TNC per kilogram body weight. The recipient’s weight is $30\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Three umbilical cord blood units are available, each characterized by a pre-cryopreservation TNC count, an expected post-thaw recovery fraction, and a post-thaw viability fraction.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. All conditions for a rigorous quantitative analysis are met.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of umbilical cord blood (UCB) units required to meet a specified minimum total nucleated cell (TNC) dose for a recipient.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Minimum acceptable TNC dose per kilogram, $d_{\\text{min}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{TNC/kg}$.\n- Recipient's body weight, $w = 30\\,\\text{kg}$.\n\nThe data for the three available UCB units are:\n- Unit A: pre-cryopreservation TNC $N_{\\text{pre,A}} = 1.0\\times 10^{9}$, recovery fraction $r_A = 0.90$, viability fraction $v_A = 0.70$.\n- Unit B: pre-cryopreservation TNC $N_{\\text{pre,B}} = 9.0\\times 10^{8}$, recovery fraction $r_B = 0.80$, viability fraction $v_B = 0.75$.\n- Unit C: pre-cryopreservation TNC $N_{\\text{pre,C}} = 8.0\\times 10^{8}$, recovery fraction $r_C = 0.75$, viability fraction $v_C = 0.85$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in sequential steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum absolute effective TNC count required for the recipient. This is the product of the minimum required dose per kilogram and the recipient's weight. Let this required count be $N_{\\text{req}}$.\n$$N_{\\text{req}} = d_{\\text{min}} \\times w$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{\\text{req}} = (2.5 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{TNC/kg}) \\times (30\\,\\text{kg}) = 75 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{TNC} = 7.5 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{TNC}$$\nThis is the target TNC count that must be met or exceeded by the transplant.\n\nSecond, we calculate the effective post-thaw TNC, $N_{\\text{eff}}$, available from each individual unit. The problem defines this as $N_{\\text{eff}} = N_{\\text{pre}} \\times r \\times v$, where $N_{\\text{pre}}$ is the pre-cryopreservation TNC count, $r$ is the post-thaw recovery fraction, and $v$ is the post-thaw viability fraction.\n\nFor Unit A:\n$$N_{\\text{eff,A}} = N_{\\text{pre,A}} \\times r_A \\times v_A = (1.0 \\times 10^{9}) \\times 0.90 \\times 0.70 = 0.63 \\times 10^{9} = 6.3 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\nFor Unit B:\n$$N_{\\text{eff,B}} = N_{\\text{pre,B}} \\times r_B \\times v_B = (9.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.80 \\times 0.75 = (9.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.60 = 5.4 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\nFor Unit C:\n$$N_{\\text{eff,C}} = N_{\\text{pre,C}} \\times r_C \\times v_C = (8.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.75 \\times 0.85 = (8.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.6375 = 5.1 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\nThird, we assess the feasibility of meeting the dose threshold with a single unit. This requires comparing the effective TNC of each unit to the required TNC, $N_{\\text{req}} = 7.5 \\times 10^{8}$.\n\n- For Unit A: $N_{\\text{eff,A}} = 6.3 \\times 10^{8}$. This is less than $N_{\\text{req}}$.\n- For Unit B: $N_{\\text{eff,B}} = 5.4 \\times 10^{8}$. This is less than $N_{\\text{req}}$.\n- For Unit C: $N_{\\text{eff,C}} = 5.1 \\times 10^{8}$. This is less than $N_{\\text{req}}$.\n\nNone of the available units, individually, can provide the required minimum TNC dose. Therefore, a single-unit transplant is not feasible. The minimum number of units must be greater than $1$.\n\nFourth, we assess the feasibility of a double-unit combination. The problem states to assume additivity, so the combined effective TNC is the sum of the individual effective TNCs. To determine if any two-unit combination is sufficient, we can test the combination of the two units with the highest effective TNC counts, which are Unit A and Unit B.\n\nThe combined effective TNC for Units A and B, denoted $N_{\\text{eff,A+B}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{eff,A+B}} = N_{\\text{eff,A}} + N_{\\text{eff,B}} = (6.3 \\times 10^{8}) + (5.4 \\times 10^{8}) = 11.7 \\times 10^{8}$$\nWe compare this combined count to the required count:\n$$N_{\\text{eff,A+B}} = 11.7 \\times 10^{8} > N_{\\text{req}} = 7.5 \\times 10^{8}$$\nThis combination successfully exceeds the minimum dose threshold. Since a double-unit transplant is feasible, and a single-unit transplant is not, the minimum number of units required is $2$.\n\nFor completeness, we can verify the other double-unit combinations:\n- Units A and C: $N_{\\text{eff,A+C}} = N_{\\text{eff,A}} + N_{\\text{eff,C}} = (6.3 \\times 10^{8}) + (5.1 \\times 10^{8}) = 11.4 \\times 10^{8} > N_{\\text{req}}$. This is also sufficient.\n- Units B and C: $N_{\\text{eff,B+C}} = N_{\\text{eff,B}} + N_{\\text{eff,C}} = (5.4 \\times 10^{8}) + (5.1 \\times 10^{8}) = 10.5 \\times 10^{8} > N_{\\text{req}}$. This is also sufficient.\n\nAs at least one double-unit combination is feasible, there is no need to consider a triple-unit transplant. The minimum number of units required is definitively $2$.",

            "introduction": "High-dose conditioning agents like busulfan have a narrow therapeutic index, where under-exposure can lead to graft rejection or relapse, and over-exposure can cause life-threatening toxicities like sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This practice  simulates the real-world application of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), using basic principles of linear pharmacokinetics to adjust a patient's busulfan dose. Mastering this ratiometric calculation is essential for individualizing therapy and optimizing patient outcomes.",

            "problem": "An adult patient undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) receives intravenous busulfan as part of myeloablative conditioning. After a first per-dose administration of $0.8$ mg/kg, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) reports an observed area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) of $16$ mg·h/L for that dose. To balance efficacy and minimize the risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, the transplant team targets a per-dose AUC of $20$ mg·h/L for subsequent doses. Assume linear pharmacokinetics with first-order elimination, constant clearance across doses over the short time frame of adjustment, intravenous administration with complete bioavailability, unchanged body weight, and that the dosing interval and infusion duration do not alter clearance. Using first principles of linear pharmacokinetics and conservation of mass, compute the revised per-dose amount in mg/kg that would be predicted to achieve the target AUC on the next dose. Round your answer to three significant figures. Express the final per-dose amount in mg/kg.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the revised per-dose amount of busulfan in mg/kg required to achieve a target area under the concentration–time curve ($AUC$), given an initial dose and its corresponding observed $AUC$. The solution is predicated on the principles of linear pharmacokinetics, which are explicitly stated as assumptions in the problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- The initial per-dose amount is $D_1 = 0.8 \\text{ mg/kg}$.\n- The observed $AUC$ corresponding to the initial dose is $AUC_1 = 16 \\text{ mg·h/L}$.\n- The target per-dose $AUC$ is $AUC_{target} = 20 \\text{ mg·h/L}$.\n- The revised per-dose amount to be computed is $D_{target}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume linear pharmacokinetics with first-order elimination and constant clearance. For a drug administered intravenously, its total systemic exposure, quantified by the $AUC$, is directly related to the dose administered and the drug's clearance ($CL$). Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The fundamental relationship is given by:\n$$AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{CL}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability of the drug. For intravenous administration, the drug is delivered directly into the systemic circulation, so its bioavailability is complete, meaning $F = 1$. The dose in this context is the total amount of drug administered. Since the problem provides doses in units of mg/kg, we can denote the per-dose amount as $D_{norm}$ (in mg/kg) and the patient's body weight as $W$ (in kg). The total dose is $D_{total} = D_{norm} \\cdot W$. Similarly, clearance can be expressed as a total value $CL_{total}$ (in L/h) or normalized by weight, $CL_{norm}$ (in L/h/kg), where $CL_{total} = CL_{norm} \\cdot W$.\n\nThe equation can then be written in terms of normalized quantities:\n$$AUC = \\frac{1 \\cdot (D_{norm} \\cdot W)}{CL_{norm} \\cdot W}$$\nThe patient's body weight, $W$, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. This shows that the relationship holds for weight-normalized doses and clearance:\n$$AUC = \\frac{D_{norm}}{CL_{norm}}$$\nThe problem assumes that clearance is constant over the short time frame of dose adjustment. This is the crucial assumption that allows for a direct calculation. Let's denote the constant normalized clearance simply as $CL$.\n\nFor the initial dose, we have:\n$$AUC_1 = \\frac{D_1}{CL}$$\nFor the target dose, we will have:\n$$AUC_{target} = \\frac{D_{target}}{CL}$$\nSince $CL$ is constant for both administrations, we can express it from both equations:\n$$CL = \\frac{D_1}{AUC_1}$$\nand\n$$CL = \\frac{D_{target}}{AUC_{target}}$$\nEquating these two expressions for $CL$ gives us a direct proportionality (a ratiometric relationship) between dose and $AUC$:\n$$\\frac{D_1}{AUC_1} = \\frac{D_{target}}{AUC_{target}}$$\nWe can now solve for the unknown target dose, $D_{target}$:\n$$D_{target} = D_1 \\cdot \\frac{AUC_{target}}{AUC_1}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- $D_1 = 0.8 \\text{ mg/kg}$\n- $AUC_1 = 16 \\text{ mg·h/L}$\n- $AUC_{target} = 20 \\text{ mg·h/L}$\n\n$$D_{target} = (0.8 \\text{ mg/kg}) \\cdot \\frac{20 \\text{ mg·h/L}}{16 \\text{ mg·h/L}}$$\nThe units of mg·h/L cancel out, leaving the result in mg/kg, as required.\n$$D_{target} = 0.8 \\cdot \\frac{20}{16} \\text{ mg/kg}$$\n$$D_{target} = 0.8 \\cdot 1.25 \\text{ mg/kg}$$\n$$D_{target} = 1.0 \\text{ mg/kg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1.0$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $1.00$.\n\nThus, the revised per-dose amount predicted to achieve the target $AUC$ is $1.00$ mg/kg. This is consistent with the principle of dose proportionality in linear pharmacokinetics: to increase the $AUC$ by a factor of $\\frac{20}{16} = 1.25$, the dose must also be increased by the same factor.",

Over a period of $4$ weeks, the donor fraction in the CD$33^+$ lineage declined from $0.95$ at week $0$ to $0.80$ at week $4$. Assume the following foundational model of lineage dynamics: donor-derived myeloid cells $D(t)$ and recipient-derived myeloid cells $R(t)$ each follow exponential dynamics with net per-capita rates $r_D$ and $r_R$, respectively, and the donor fraction is $f(t) = \\frac{D(t)}{D(t)+R(t)}$.

The data provided are self-consistent and fall within a plausible range for clinical scenarios. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in the dynamics of the donor fraction $f(t)$. It is convenient to analyze the log-odds of the donor fraction, which is defined as $\\Lambda(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f(t)}{1-f(t)}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we express $\\Lambda(t)$ in terms of the cell populations $D(t)$ and $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{f(t)}{1-f(t)} = \\frac{\\frac{D(t)}{D(t)+R(t)}}{1-\\frac{D(t)}{D(t)+R(t)}} = \\frac{\\frac{D(t)}{D(t)+R(t)}}{\\frac{R(t)}{D(t)+R(t)}} = \\frac{D(t)}{R(t)}\n$$\nGiven the exponential dynamics $D(t) = D_0 \\exp(r_D t)$ and $R(t) = R_0 \\exp(r_R t)$, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{D(t)}{R(t)} = \\frac{D_0 \\exp(r_D t)}{R_0 \\exp(r_R t)} = \\frac{D_0}{R_0} \\exp((r_D - r_R)t)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives the log-odds:\n$$\n\\Lambda(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{D(t)}{R(t)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{D_0}{R_0}\\right) + (r_D - r_R)t = \\Lambda(0) + \\Delta r \\cdot t\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta r = r_D - r_R$ is the net donor-versus-recipient rate difference. This equation shows that the log-odds of the donor fraction changes linearly with time, with a slope equal to $\\Delta r$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the background rate difference, $\\Delta r_{bg}$, from the initial observation period. Let $t'$ denote time in weeks during this period.\nAt $t'=0$, $f_{bg}(0) = 0.95$. The log-odds is $\\Lambda_{bg}(0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.95}{1-0.95}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.95}{0.05}\\right) = \\ln(19)$.\nAt $t'=4$, $f_{bg}(4) = 0.80$. The log-odds is $\\Lambda_{bg}(4) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.80}{1-0.80}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.80}{0.20}\\right) = \\ln(4)$.\n\nThe change in log-odds over $\\Delta t' = 4$ weeks is $\\Lambda_{bg}(4) - \\Lambda_{bg}(0) = \\Delta r_{bg} \\cdot \\Delta t'$.\n$$\n\\ln(4) - \\ln(19) = \\Delta r_{bg} \\times 4\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta r_{bg} = \\frac{\\ln(4) - \\ln(19)}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{19}\\right) \\text{ per week}\n$$\nThis negative rate reflects the observed decline in donor chimerism.\n\nNext, we model the $3$-week DLI intervention.

The effective rate difference for that week is $\\Delta r_{eff,i} = \\Delta r_{bg} + k d_i$.\nThe change in log-odds over week $i$ is:\n$$\n\\Lambda(i) - \\Lambda(i-1) = \\Delta r_{eff,i} \\times (1 \\text{ week}) = \\Delta r_{bg} + k d_i\n$$\nThe total change in log-odds over the $3$ weeks is the sum of the weekly changes:\n$$\n\\Lambda(3) - \\Lambda(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\Lambda(i) - \\Lambda(i-1)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\Delta r_{bg} + k d_i)\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda(3) - \\Lambda(0) = 3\\Delta r_{bg} + k(d_1 + d_2 + d_3)\n$$\nNow, substitute the known values and expressions:\n$$\n\\ln(19) - \\ln(4) = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{19}\\right)\\right) + k(d_1 + d_2 + d_3)\n$$\nUsing $\\ln(4/19) = -\\ln(19/4)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{4}\\right) + k(d_1 + d_2 + d_3)\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{4}\\right) = k(d_1 + d_2 + d_3)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{7}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{4}\\right) = k(d_1 + d_2 + d_3)\n$$\nThe doses form a geometric series: $d_1 = 1.0$, $d_2 = d_1 g$, and $d_3 = d_1 g^2$.
