            "problem": "A patient with refractory angina pectoris who is not an optimal candidate for conventional percutaneous coronary intervention is undergoing optimization with combined anti-ischemic therapy to facilitate consideration of advanced strategies. During standardized submaximal treadmill testing at approximately constant external workload of $5$ metabolic equivalents (METs), his baseline hemodynamics at the point of symptom onset are heart rate $90$ beats per minute (bpm) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) $150$ millimeters of mercury (mmHg). After titration with rate-lowering and vasodilatory therapy, his hemodynamics measured at the same external workload are heart rate $70$ bpm and SBP $130$ mmHg without symptoms.\n\nUse the following foundational assumptions:\n1. Myocardial oxygen demand correlates with the rate-pressure product (RPP), defined as $RPP = HR \\times SBP$, where $HR$ is heart rate and $SBP$ is systolic blood pressure.\n2. For a given fixed coronary stenosis in the submaximal range, the angina threshold corresponds approximately to a constant $RPP$.\n3. Near this range, $RPP$ scales approximately proportionally with external workload.\n\nFirst compute the change in $RPP$ at the same workload produced by therapy, and then infer the multiplicative factor by which the angina threshold workload would be expected to shift (increase) under these assumptions. Report only the multiplicative factor as your final answer. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it as a dimensionless number.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cardiovascular physiology, namely the use of the rate-pressure product as an index of myocardial oxygen demand and its relationship to exertional angina. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient and consistent information to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative.\n\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative factor by which the angina threshold workload is expected to increase after therapeutic intervention. This can be determined using the provided relationships and hemodynamic data.\n\nLet us define the given variables:\n- Baseline heart rate at symptom onset: $HR_{base} = 90$ bpm\n- Baseline systolic blood pressure at symptom onset: $SBP_{base} = 150$ mmHg\n- Post-therapy heart rate at the same workload: $HR_{ther} = 70$ bpm\n- Post-therapy systolic blood pressure at the same workload: $SBP_{ther} = 130$ mmHg\n- The external workload at which these measurements are made: $W_{test} = 5$ METs. This is also the initial angina threshold workload, so $W_{threshold, pre} = 5$ METs.\n\nThe solution is based on three foundational assumptions:\n\n1.  Myocardial oxygen demand is proportional to the Rate-Pressure Product ($RPP$), defined as:\n    $$RPP = HR \\times SBP$$\n\n2.  The angina threshold corresponds to a fixed value of the $RPP$, which we will denote as $RPP_{threshold}$. Based on the baseline data, the patient experiences symptoms when the $RPP$ reaches this threshold.\n    $$RPP_{threshold} = HR_{base} \\times SBP_{base}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$RPP_{threshold} = 90 \\times 150 = 13500 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$$\n\n3.  The $RPP$ scales proportionally with the external workload, $W$. This can be expressed as:\n    $$RPP(W) = k \\cdot W$$\n    The proportionality constant $k$ represents the myocardial oxygen cost for a given external workload and is dependent on the patient's physiological state. Therapy is designed to lower this cost, thus reducing the value of $k$.\n\nLet $k_{pre}$ be the proportionality constant before therapy and $k_{post}$ be the constant after therapy.\n\nBefore therapy, the angina threshold workload $W_{threshold, pre}$ is reached when $RPP(W_{threshold,pre}) = RPP_{threshold}$.\n$$RPP_{threshold} = k_{pre} \\cdot W_{threshold, pre}$$\n\nAfter therapy, the patient has a new, lower proportionality constant, $k_{post}$. The problem provides data at the same workload $W_{test} = W_{threshold, pre}$. The $RPP$ at this workload is:\n$$RPP_{post, test} = HR_{ther} \\times SBP_{ther}$$\n$$RPP_{post, test} = 70 \\times 130 = 9100 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$$\nAccording to the proportionality assumption, this measured value relates to $k_{post}$ as:\n$$RPP_{post, test} = k_{post} \\cdot W_{threshold, pre}$$\n\nThe new angina threshold workload, $W_{threshold, post}$, is the workload at which the patient's $RPP$ will reach the same fixed angina threshold, $RPP_{threshold}$, but under the new post-therapy physiological state governed by $k_{post}$.\n$$RPP_{threshold} = k_{post} \\cdot W_{threshold, post}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative factor $F$ by which the angina threshold workload has shifted. This factor is the ratio of the new threshold workload to the old one.\n$$F = \\frac{W_{threshold, post}}{W_{threshold, pre}}$$\n\nTo find this factor, we can establish a ratio using the equations derived above.\nFrom the equation for the new threshold workload, we can write $W_{threshold, post} = \\frac{RPP_{threshold}}{k_{post}}$.\nFrom the equation for the post-therapy test, we can write $k_{post} = \\frac{RPP_{post, test}}{W_{threshold, pre}}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{post}$ into the equation for $W_{threshold, post}$:\n$$W_{threshold, post} = \\frac{RPP_{threshold}}{\\left( \\frac{RPP_{post, test}}{W_{threshold, pre}} \\right)} = W_{threshold, pre} \\cdot \\frac{RPP_{threshold}}{RPP_{post, test}}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the multiplicative factor $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{W_{threshold, post}}{W_{threshold, pre}} = \\frac{RPP_{threshold}}{RPP_{post, test}}$$\n\nThis result is intuitive: the workload can increase by the same factor that the rate-pressure product (myocardial oxygen demand) at a fixed workload has decreased.\n\nSubstituting the calculated $RPP$ values:\n$$F = \\frac{13500}{9100} = \\frac{135}{91}$$\n$$F \\approx 1.483516...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 1.48$$\n\nThis means that after therapy, the patient is expected to be able to tolerate a workload approximately $1.48$ times greater than their previous limit before experiencing angina.",

            "problem": "A 62-year-old man with refractory angina despite maximally tolerated antianginal therapy undergoes invasive physiologic assessment of the left anterior descending artery. Angiography shows two serial, intermediate coronary stenoses in the mid segment separated by a short, non-diseased segment. During pharmacologically induced maximal hyperemia, the aortic pressure is measured as $P_a$, and a pressure wire placed distal to the second stenosis records distal coronary pressure $P_d$. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is defined as $FFR = P_d / P_a$ under conditions of maximal hyperemia. Empirically and mechanistically, pressure loss across a focal stenosis at flow $Q$ can be represented as a sum of viscous and separation losses, $\\Delta P_i(Q) = \\alpha_i Q + \\beta_i Q^2$, where $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ are lesion-specific coefficients determined by geometry and fluid properties.

The total pressure drop from the aorta to the distal sensor is the sum of the drops across each stenosis, so $P_a - P_d = \\Delta P_1(Q) + \\Delta P_2(Q)$.

            "solution": "## Solution Derivation ##\n\nThe problem asks for the most accurate statement regarding the interaction of two serial stenoses based on the provided first principles. The core of the physics lies in the coupling between pressure and flow.\n\nThe total pressure drop across the two stenoses is the sum of the individual drops:\n$$P_a - P_d = \\Delta P_1(Q) + \\Delta P_2(Q)$$\nThe pressure drop for each stenosis is given by the non-linear relation:\n$$\\Delta P_i(Q) = \\alpha_i Q + \\beta_i Q^2$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$P_a - P_d = (\\alpha_1 Q + \\beta_1 Q^2) + (\\alpha_2 Q + \\beta_2 Q^2)$$\n$$P_a - P_d = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)Q + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)Q^2$$\nThe system is closed by the relationship between the distal pressure $P_d$ and the flow $Q$ through the microvasculature:\n$$Q = \\frac{P_d}{R_m}$$\nThis equation is crucial: it shows that the flow $Q$ through both stenoses is determined by the pressure distal to both of them. This creates a feedback loop or coupling. The pressure drop across the stenoses determines $P_d$, but $P_d$ in turn determines the flow $Q$ that causes the pressure drop.\n\nLet's substitute the expression for $Q$ into the pressure-drop equation:\n$$P_a - P_d = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)\\left(\\frac{P_d}{R_m}\\right) + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)\\left(\\frac{P_d}{R_m}\\right)^2$$\nRearranging for $P_a$:\n$$P_a = P_d + \\frac{\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2}{R_m}P_d + \\frac{\\beta_1 + \\beta_2}{R_m^2}P_d^2$$\nThe system $FFR$ is $FFR_{sys} = P_d/P_a$. From the equation above, it is clear that the relationship between $P_a$ and $P_d$ is non-linear due to the $P_d^2$ term, which arises from the $\\beta_i Q^2$ term in the stenosis pressure loss model.\n\nThis non-linear relationship is the key to understanding the interaction. The presence of the proximal stenosis (lesion $1$) reduces the pressure driving flow through the distal stenosis (lesion $2$). Conversely, the presence of the distal stenosis increases the overall resistance of the system, which reduces the total flow $Q$ passing through the proximal stenosis. This means the pressure drop across stenosis $1$ *in the serial system* is smaller than the pressure drop it would cause if it were the only stenosis present (since the flow $Q$ would be higher in the latter case).\n\nBecause of this complex, non-linear, flow-dependent interaction, one cannot use simple arithmetic (e.g., addition of pressure drops or multiplication of FFR values from hypothetical isolated-lesion scenarios) to relate the overall system $FFR$ to the individual components. To determine the pressure drop attributable to each lesion *within the serial system*, one must measure the intermediate pressure ($P_{int}$) between them. A single measurement of $P_d$ provides only one equation with multiple unknowns (the coefficients $\\alpha_1, \\beta_1, \\alpha_2, \\beta_2$), making it impossible to deconvolve the individual contributions.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis ##\n\n**A. In serial lesions, the system $FFR$ equals the product of the hypothetical per-lesion $FFR$ values that would be measured if the other lesion were removed, because pressure drops multiply along the line.**\nThis is incorrect. First, pressure drops add, they do not multiply. Second, the FFR values do not multiply. This might be a misapplication of an idea from linear circuit theory where transfer functions multiply, but that does not apply here. As shown by the governing equations, the relationship is non-linear. The flow $Q$ through the system is different from the flows $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ that would exist if each lesion were present in isolation. Therefore, $FFR_{sys} \\neq FFR_1 \\times FFR_2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The measured system $FFR$ equals $1$ minus the sum of the individual stenosis pressure ratios, so per-lesion $FFR$ values can be inferred by subtracting contributions proportionally to angiographic severity.**\nThe first part is a tautology: $FFR_{sys} = P_d/P_a = (P_a - \\Delta P_{total})/P_a = 1 - \\Delta P_{total}/P_a$. However, the conclusion is fallacious. The \"individual stenosis pressure ratios\" ($\\Delta P_1/P_a$ and $\\Delta P_2/P_a$) are functions of the global flow $Q$, which is determined by the entire system. One cannot infer these contributions, let alone based on a qualitative and often misleading measure like \"angiographic severity,\" without more information. The non-linear interaction prevents such simple decomposition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because pressure loss across each stenosis depends on $Q$, and $Q$ itself depends on $P_d$ through the microvasculature, two serial stenoses interact nonlinearly; the system $FFR$ reflects the combined pressure losses, and true per-lesion $FFR$ cannot be deduced from a single distal $P_d/P_a$ measurement without altering boundary conditions (for example, hyperemic pressure-wire pullback or staged intervention).**\nThis statement perfectly encapsulates the derived physics. It correctly identifies the flow-dependency of pressure loss ($\\Delta P_i(Q)$), the coupling of flow to distal pressure ($Q(P_d)$), the resulting non-linear interaction, and the methodological consequence: a single distal measurement is insufficient to deconvolve the individual lesion effects. It also correctly mentions the standard techniques (pullback or staged PCI) used to obtain the necessary additional information by altering the measurement conditions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The proximal stenosis always dominates total resistance; therefore, the per-lesion distal $FFR$ equals the system $FFR$, and treating only the distal lesion will not change $FFR$.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. There is no principle that the proximal stenosis \"always dominates.\" A mild proximal stenosis can be followed by a severe distal one. The \"per-lesion distal $FFR$,\" which would be $P_d / P_{int}$ (where $P_{int}$ is the pressure between the stenoses), is fundamentally different from the system $FFR$, $P_d/P_a$, since $P_a > P_{int}$. Finally, treating a hemodynamically significant distal lesion would absolutely change (increase) the overall system $FFR$ by reducing the total pressure drop.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. During hyperemia, microvascular resistance becomes zero, so all pressure loss occurs across the stenoses; thus per-lesion $FFR$ values are simply proportional to stenosis lengths.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. Hyperemia induces a *minimal* and stable resistance ($R_m$), not a zero resistance. If $R_m$ were zero, flow $Q = P_d/R_m$ would be infinite, which is physically impossible. A non-zero resistance is essential for the FFR concept. Furthermore, pressure loss across a stenosis is a complex function of geometry (captured by $\\alpha_i, \\beta_i$) and is not simply proportional to length.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Thus $R_{\\text{MI,CABG}}(5)=1-\\exp(-0.122)\\approx 1-0.885\\approx 0.115$, or approximately $11.5\\%$.\n\nInterpretation: Both the predicted $4$-year all-cause mortality and $5$-year myocardial infarction risks are lower with CABG in this diabetic patient with three-vessel disease and high anatomical complexity, consistent with durable complete revascularization and established trial data (for example, the superiority of CABG over PCI in diabetics with multivessel disease for myocardial infarction and mortality over mid-term follow-up).\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: States CABG is favored, with $4$-year mortality approximately $7$–$8\\%$ versus $11$–$12\\%$ for PCI, and $5$-year myocardial infarction approximately $11$–$12\\%$ versus $21$–$22\\%$ for PCI. These match the computed values ($\\sim 7.5\\%$ vs $\\sim 11.5\\%$ mortality; $\\sim 11.5\\%$ vs $\\sim 21.6\\%$ myocardial infarction). Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: Claims PCI has lower $4$-year mortality (approximately $7\\%$) despite higher myocardial infarction. Our calculations show the opposite: PCI mortality ($\\sim 11.5\\%$) exceeds CABG mortality ($\\sim 7.5\\%$). Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: Claims equivalence with both endpoints around $12\\%$. Calculations demonstrate clear separation favoring CABG for both mortality and myocardial infarction. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: Claims diabetes increases surgery-related myocardial infarction leading to lower $5$-year myocardial infarction with PCI ($\\sim 12\\%$) than CABG ($\\sim 22\\%$), with similar mortality. Our results show PCI myocardial infarction ($\\sim 21.6\\%$) exceeds CABG ($\\sim 11.5\\%$), and mortality is also lower with CABG. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, CABG is the recommended strategy for this patient based on the modeled $4$- to $5$-year outcomes.",
