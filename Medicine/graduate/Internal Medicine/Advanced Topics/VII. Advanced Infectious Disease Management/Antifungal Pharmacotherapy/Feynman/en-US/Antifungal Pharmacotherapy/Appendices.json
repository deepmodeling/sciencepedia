This practice guides you through a common clinical scenario: adjusting the dose of flucytosine, an antifungal agent primarily cleared by the kidneys, for a patient with renal impairment .

            "problem": "A $62$-year-old male weighing $70$ kg with invasive Candida endocarditis is to start oral flucytosine as part of combination therapy. To minimize the risk of bone marrow suppression (cytopenias), the infectious diseases team requests Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) targeting a steady-state pre-dose trough concentration between $25$–$100$ $\\mu$g/mL, aiming for the midpoint target of $50$ $\\mu$g/mL. His serum creatinine is $2.0$ mg/dL. Assume the following are true for flucytosine in this patient:\n- One-compartment disposition with linear, first-order elimination.\n- Oral absorption is fast relative to elimination so that each oral dose can be modeled as an effectively instantaneous input.\n- Oral bioavailability is $F = 0.9$.\n- Volume of distribution is $0.6$ L/kg.\n- Systemic clearance is dominated by renal filtration and equals the creatinine clearance.\n- Creatinine clearance is to be estimated using the Cockcroft–Gault equation for a male patient.\n- Based on renal function, select a dosing interval of $\\tau = 12$ hours.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and starting from first principles of one-compartment, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and creatinine clearance estimation, compute the single per-dose amount of flucytosine (in mg) that should be prescribed every $\\tau = 12$ hours to achieve a steady-state trough concentration of $50$ $\\mu$g/mL. Round your answer to three significant figures and express the final dose in mg.\n\nIn your reasoning, justify how the TDM plan would maintain troughs between $25$–$100$ $\\mu$g/mL while preventing cytopenias, but provide only the calculated per-dose amount as your final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the oral dose ($D_{ose}$) of flucytosine that will achieve a target steady-state trough concentration ($C_{ss,min}$) of $50$ $\\mu$g/mL when administered every $12$ hours.\n\nThis requires a multi-step calculation starting from the patient's physiological parameters to determine the drug's clearance, then using pharmacokinetic principles to relate the dose to the desired concentration.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's creatinine clearance ($CrCL$) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for a male:\n$$CrCL = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times S_{cr}}$$\nThe given values are Age $= 62$ years, Weight $= 70$ kg, and serum creatinine ($S_{cr}$) $= 2.0$ mg/dL.\n$$CrCL = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 70}{72 \\times 2.0} = \\frac{78 \\times 70}{144} = \\frac{5460}{144} = 37.91\\bar{6} \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe problem states that systemic clearance ($CL$) equals $CrCL$. For pharmacokinetic calculations, we must ensure consistent units. We convert $CL$ from mL/min to L/hr to align with the units of volume of distribution (L) and the dosing interval (hr).\n$$CL = 37.91\\bar{6} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ min}}{1 \\text{ hr}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}} = 2.275 \\text{ L/hr}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of distribution ($V_d$).\n$$V_d = 0.6 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 70 \\text{ kg} = 42 \\text{ L}$$\n\nThe elimination rate constant ($k_e$) is determined by the ratio of clearance to the volume of distribution.\n$$k_e = \\frac{CL}{V_d} = \\frac{2.275 \\text{ L/hr}}{42 \\text{ L}} = 0.0541\\bar{6} \\text{ hr}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we use the equation for the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{ss,min}$) for a one-compartment model following multiple oral doses. The model assumes instantaneous absorption, which is a common simplification for drugs with rapid absorption relative to elimination.\nThe concentration just after a dose at steady state ($C_{ss,max}$) is the sum of the trough concentration ($C_{ss,min}$) and the concentration increase from the new dose, $\\frac{F \\cdot D_{ose}}{V_d}$.\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F \\cdot D_{ose}}{V_d}$$\nThe trough concentration is the result of the peak concentration declining over one dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\cdot \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\left(C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F \\cdot D_{ose}}{V_d}\\right) \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $D_{ose}$:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,min} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) + \\frac{F \\cdot D_{ose}}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{ss,min} (1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)) = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{ose}}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$D_{ose} = \\frac{C_{ss,min} \\cdot V_d}{F} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$D_{ose} = \\frac{C_{ss,min} \\cdot V_d}{F} (\\exp(k_e \\tau) - 1)$$\n\nWe now substitute the known and calculated values into this equation. The target concentration $C_{ss,min} = 50$ $\\mu$g/mL must be converted to $50$ mg/L to maintain unit consistency.\n- $C_{ss,min} = 50$ mg/L\n- $V_d = 42$ L\n- $F = 0.9$\n- $k_e = 0.0541\\bar{6}$ hr$^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 12$ hr\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless exponent $k_e \\tau$:\n$$k_e \\tau = 0.0541\\bar{6} \\text{ hr}^{-1} \\times 12 \\text{ hr} = 0.65$$\nNow, substitute all values into the dose equation:\n$$D_{ose} = \\frac{50 \\text{ mg/L} \\times 42 \\text{ L}}{0.9} (\\exp(0.65) - 1)$$\n$$D_{ose} = \\frac{2100}{0.9} (\\exp(0.65) - 1) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{ose} = 2333.\\bar{3} \\times (1.91554075... - 1) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{ose} = 2333.\\bar{3} \\times 0.91554075... \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{ose} = 2136.2617... \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{ose} \\approx 2140 \\text{ mg}$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation to avoid ambiguity about the trailing zero: $2.14 \\times 10^3$ mg.\n\nThis calculated dose aims for the midpoint of the therapeutic range ($25$–$100$ $\\mu$g/mL). Due to the assumption of linear kinetics, the steady-state concentration is directly proportional to the dose. Targeting the midpoint ($50$ $\\mu$g/mL) provides a buffer against inter-individual variability and minor inaccuracies in the model assumptions, thereby increasing the probability that the patient's actual trough concentration will fall within the desired range. This strategy minimizes the risk of toxicity (cytopenias, associated with troughs $> 100$ $\\mu$g/mL) while maintaining therapeutic efficacy (troughs $> 25$ $\\mu$g/mL).",

            "solution": "The rate of drug elimination, $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$, for a substance following Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described by the equation:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the drug concentration in the plasma, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of metabolism, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, which is the concentration at which the rate of metabolism is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nAt pharmacokinetic steady state, the concentration is, by definition, constant over time. This state is achieved when the rate of drug administration, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is exactly balanced by the rate of drug elimination, $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$.
