            "problem": "A patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection presents with clinical deterioration after starting antiretroviral therapy. Use foundational principles about antiretroviral therapy–driven immune restoration and the definition of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome to decide which diagnosis best fits the scenario by explicitly considering temporality, inflammatory paradoxical worsening, and exclusion of alternative causes.\n\nA $36$-year-old man with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection and newly diagnosed drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis presents with recurrent fevers and enlarging lymph nodes. One month ago, he was started on rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for tuberculosis. Two weeks later, he initiated a regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir. He initially improved but now, $3$ weeks after antiretroviral therapy initiation, he reports fevers to $38.7^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, new painful right cervical lymphadenopathy with overlying erythema, and malaise. He denies cough worsening and has no rash, mucosal involvement, eosinophilia, dyspnea, or new neurologic symptoms.\n\nOn examination, he is febrile at $38.5^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, with tender, fluctuant right cervical lymph nodes. Lungs are clear. No hepatosplenomegaly. No cutaneous rash. Laboratory studies show a decrease in plasma human immunodeficiency virus ribonucleic acid from $5.8 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ copies/mL}$ pre–antiretroviral therapy to $2.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ copies/mL}$ at the current visit, and a rise in cluster of differentiation $4$ (CD$4$) count from $32 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$ to $88 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$. Complete blood count is without eosinophilia. Liver enzymes are within reference limits. Chest computed tomography shows increased size and central necrosis of mediastinal lymph nodes compared to imaging $4$ weeks prior. Sputum acid-fast bacilli smears that were initially positive have become negative; a molecular rifampin resistance assay on the diagnostic sputum showed no resistance. He reports perfect adherence, and directly observed therapy records confirm tuberculosis medication ingestion. Bacterial blood cultures are negative. Needle aspiration of a cervical lymph node yields purulent material; bacterial Gram stain and culture are negative, and mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction is pending.\n\nUsing only the following fundamental bases:\n- In human immunodeficiency virus infection, effective antiretroviral therapy reduces plasma viral load and permits recovery of pathogen-specific immune responses, often reflected by a rising CD$4$ count.\n- Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is an inflammatory clinical syndrome that occurs after initiation, re-initiation, or intensification of antiretroviral therapy in which there is paradoxical worsening of a previously diagnosed opportunistic infection or unmasking of a previously subclinical infection, in the setting of virologic and immunologic response to therapy, after exclusion of alternative explanations such as new infections, drug toxicity, or treatment failure.\n\nWhich of the following options best explains this patient’s current presentation when the French criteria for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome are applied?\n\nA. Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following antiretroviral therapy initiation\n\nB. Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis causing treatment failure and progression despite therapy\n\nC. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms due to antiretroviral therapy\n\nD.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Profile:** A $36$-year-old man with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and newly diagnosed drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).\n-   **Treatment History:**\n    -   Started on rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for TB $1$ month prior to presentation. Adherence confirmed by directly observed therapy.\n    -   Initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir $2$ weeks after starting TB therapy (i.e., $2$ weeks prior to presentation). Reports perfect adherence.\n-   **Clinical Course:** Initial improvement after starting ART, followed by clinical deterioration at $3$ weeks post-ART initiation.\n-   **Presenting Symptoms:** Recurrent fevers to $38.7^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, new painful right cervical lymphadenopathy with overlying erythema, and malaise.\n-   **Pertinent Negatives:** Denies cough worsening, rash, mucosal involvement, eosinophilia, dyspnea, or new neurologic symptoms.\n-   **Examination Findings:** Febrile at $38.5^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$; tender, fluctuant right cervical lymph nodes; clear lungs; no hepatosplenomegaly; no cutaneous rash.\n-   **Laboratory Data:**\n    -   Plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA): Decreased from $5.8 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ copies/mL}$ (pre-ART) to $2.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ copies/mL}$ (current).\n    -   Cluster of differentiation $4$ (CD$4$) count: Increased from $32 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$ (pre-ART) to $88 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$ (current).\n    -   Complete blood count: No eosinophilia.\n    -   Liver enzymes: Within reference limits.\n-   **Microbiology and Imaging:**\n    -   Chest computed tomography (CT): Increased size and central necrosis of mediastinal lymph nodes compared to imaging $4$ weeks prior.\n    -   Sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears: Changed from initially positive to currently negative.\n    -   Molecular rifampin resistance assay: No resistance detected.\n    -   Bacterial blood cultures: Negative.\n    -   Lymph node aspirate: Purulent material; negative bacterial Gram stain and culture; mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is pending.\n-   **Fundamental Principles for Evaluation:**\n    1.  Effective ART reduces plasma viral load and permits recovery of pathogen-specific immune responses, often reflected by a rising CD$4$ count.\n    2.  Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an inflammatory clinical syndrome post-ART initiation, involving paradoxical worsening of a known opportunistic infection or unmasking of a subclinical one, occurring with virologic/immunologic response, and after excluding alternatives (new infections, drug toxicity, treatment failure).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The scenario is a classic and medically accurate representation of a common clinical challenge in managing co-infection of HIV and TB. The pathophysiology, treatments, and diagnostic considerations (IRIS, drug resistance, drug toxicity) are all based on established principles of internal medicine and infectious diseases.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a comprehensive clinical case with sufficient temporal, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data to allow for a differential diagnosis. The question asks for the best explanation based on a defined set of principles, which constitutes a well-posed problem in clinical reasoning.\n-   **Objective:** The presentation is factual and quantitative, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. The data are internally consistent (e.g., ART adherence is followed by a virologic and immunologic response) and medically plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the provided fundamental principles to the case data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will proceed by systematically applying the two provided fundamental principles.\n\n**Application of Principle 1: Evaluation of ART Efficacy**\nThe first principle states that effective ART leads to a reduction in HIV viral load and a recovery of immune function (e.g., rising CD$4$ count).\n-   **Virologic Response:** The patient's plasma HIV RNA load decreased from $5.8 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ copies/mL}$ to $2.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ copies/mL}$. This is a reduction of over $2$ orders of magnitude (> 100-fold), which constitutes a robust and rapid virologic response to ART.\n-   **Immunologic Response:** The patient's CD$4$ count increased from a nadir of $32 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$ to $88 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$. This rise confirms the beginning of immune reconstitution.\nConclusion: The patient fulfills the prerequisite of having a demonstrable virologic and immunologic response to ART.\n\n**Application of Principle 2: Evaluation for IRIS**\nThe second principle defines IRIS based on several components, which we evaluate in the context of this patient. The term \"French criteria\" noted in the prompt reinforces this structured approach, focusing on temporality, paradoxical inflammation, and exclusion of other causes.\n\n1.  **Temporality:** IRIS occurs after ART initiation. The patient's clinical deterioration began $3$ weeks after starting ART. This timing is highly characteristic of paradoxical TB-IRIS, which typically manifests within the first few weeks to months of ART.\n\n2.  **Paradoxical Worsening:** IRIS involves a worsening of a pre-existing infection. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary TB. His current presentation includes new fevers and enlarging, necrotic cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes, which represent a clinical worsening of his TB-related manifestations. The \"paradoxical\" nature is key: this worsening occurs despite evidence that the underlying pathogen is being controlled by its specific therapy. In this case, the patient's sputum AFB smears have converted to negative, and adherence to effective anti-tuberculous therapy is confirmed. This combination of clinical/radiographic worsening with microbiological improvement is the *sine qua non* of paradoxical IRIS.\n\n3.  **Inflammatory Nature:** The syndrome is inflammatory. The patient's fever, painful and erythematous lymphadenopathy, and malaise are all signs of a robust inflammatory process. The fluctuance and central necrosis of lymph nodes are also classic features of the intense, caseating granulomatous inflammation seen in TB-IRIS.\n\n4.  **Exclusion of Alternative Explanations:**\n    -   **Treatment Failure (TB):** The problem states the TB was drug-susceptible, and a molecular test confirmed no rifampin resistance. Adherence is confirmed via directly observed therapy. Sputum smear conversion argues against pulmonary treatment failure. While progression of extrapulmonary disease could be from resistance to other drugs, the overall picture makes IRIS far more probable.\n    -   **New Infection:** Bacterial blood cultures are negative. Aspiration of the lymph node showed no bacteria on Gram stain or culture. The presentation is not typical for a new systemic infection.\n    -   **Drug Toxicity:** A key differential is a drug reaction. Specifically, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) can cause fever and lymphadenopathy. However, the problem explicitly states the patient has no rash, no mucosal involvement, and no eosinophilia, and liver enzymes are normal. These findings effectively rule out DRESS.\n    -   **Treatment Failure (HIV):** This is definitively ruled out by the profound drop in HIV RNA, indicating virologic success, not failure.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe patient's presentation aligns perfectly with the diagnosis of paradoxical TB-associated IRIS. He exhibits a documented immunologic and virologic response to ART. His clinical deterioration occurs at a classic time point ($3$ weeks) after ART initiation. The worsening is paradoxical, with new inflammatory manifestations of TB (enlarging necrotic lymph nodes) occurring despite microbiological evidence of response to TB therapy. Finally, plausible alternative diagnoses have been systematically excluded based on the provided clinical and laboratory data.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following antiretroviral therapy initiation**\nThis option posits that the patient's symptoms are due to TB-IRIS. As demonstrated in the detailed derivation above, the patient's clinical course, temporality relative to ART initiation, evidence of both immune recovery and paradoxical inflammatory worsening of TB, and the exclusion of key alternative diagnoses perfectly fit the definition of paradoxical TB-IRIS.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis causing treatment failure and progression despite therapy**\nThis option suggests that the TB is resistant to treatment. This is contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies that the initial diagnosis was \"drug-susceptible\" and that a \"molecular rifampin resistance assay on the diagnostic sputum showed no resistance.\" Furthermore, confirmed adherence via directly observed therapy and sputum smear conversion make treatment failure less likely than an inflammatory syndrome.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) due to antiretroviral therapy**\nThis option suggests a severe drug hypersensitivity reaction. The diagnosis of DRESS syndrome requires a constellation of findings, typically including a prominent rash and eosinophilia. The problem explicitly states the patient has \"no cutaneous rash\" and the complete blood count is \"without eosinophilia.\" The absence of these cardinal features makes a diagnosis of DRESS untenable.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to John Cunningham virus presenting as an unmasked opportunistic infection**\nThis option suggests a central nervous system disease. PML is a demyelinating disease that manifests with progressive neurologic deficits. The problem states the patient has \"no new neurologic symptoms.\" His presentation is dominated by systemic fever and localized lymphadenopathy, which are entirely inconsistent with the clinical picture of PML.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Primary antiretroviral therapy virologic failure with uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus replication driving opportunistic infection progression**\nThis option posits that the ART is not working. This is directly contradicted by the laboratory data, which show a decrease in plasma HIV RNA from $5.8 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ copies/mL}$ to $2.0 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ copies/mL}$. This is a clear and significant virologic response, indicating ART success, not failure.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the absolute risk difference for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) based on data from a randomized clinical trial. The validation process confirms that the problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information using standard epidemiological notation.

As an anti-inflammatory strategy, oral prednisone is initiated. Use the following well-tested clinical dosing facts as the fundamental base: (i) weight-based glucocorticoid dosing is specified in milligrams per kilogram per day, and the daily dose is computed by multiplying the patient’s body weight by the regimen’s milligrams-per-kilogram-per-day rate; (ii) cumulative dose over a course with piecewise-constant daily dosing is computed as the sum over blocks of the product of daily dose and days in each block.\n\nAssume the patient’s body weight is $60$ kg.
