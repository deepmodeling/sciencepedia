            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must be established prior to attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Patient Demographics:** A 24-year-old woman.\n- **Presenting Complaint:** Recurrent headaches for 6 months.\n- **Headache Characteristics:**\n    - Location: Unilateral.\n    - Quality: Throbbing.\n    - Trigger: Intensified by routine physical activity.\n    - Associated Symptoms: Nausea, photophobia, phonophobia.\n    - Onset/Duration: Reaches peak intensity over 30 minutes, lasts between 4 and 72 hours.\n    - Frequency & Pattern: Occurs approximately 2 times per month, with a stable pattern since onset.\n- **Past Medical History:** Reports a similar headache phenotype since age 18.\n- **Absence of \"Red Flags\" (SNOOP10 framework):**\n    - **S**ystemic symptoms or disease: No fever, weight loss, malignancy, or immunosuppression.\n    - **N**eurologic symptoms or signs: Neurological examination is normal.

The clinical description of the headache (unilateral, throbbing, associated with nausea/photophobia/phonophobia, aggravated by activity) and its temporal profile (duration 4–72 hours) corresponds precisely to the diagnostic criteria for migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). The use of the SNOOP10 mnemonic is a standard, evidence-based clinical tool for identifying red flags that would suggest a secondary headache disorder requiring further investigation. The question's framing around risk stratification and pretest probability reflects the core of evidence-based diagnostic reasoning.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent, and relevant clinical data to allow for a differential diagnosis and the formulation of a management plan. The explicit statement that a systematic evaluation for red flags was performed and was negative is a critical piece of information that makes the problem solvable. The question asks for the \"most appropriate next step,\" which is a standard and well-defined task in clinical problem-solving.\n\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective clinical terms. While it includes the subjective patient concern (\"anxiety and requests a scan\"), this is presented as a factual part of the clinical encounter that the clinician must manage, not as the basis for the decision itself. The question correctly directs the solver to use objective frameworks (risk stratification, guidelines) to make the decision.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and realistic. It presents a classic and common clinical dilemma that requires the application of fundamental diagnostic principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe diagnostic process for headache proceeds from first principles in a stepwise fashion.\n\n1.  **Syndromic Classification:** The clinical features presented by the patient are analyzed to determine if they fit a known primary headache syndrome. The criteria for Migraine without Aura (ICHD-3 code 1.1) are:\n    *   A. At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D. The patient has had headaches 2 times per month for 6 months, totaling $\\approx 12$ attacks, which satisfies this criterion.\n    *   B. Attacks lasting 4–72 hours. The patient's attacks last between 4 and 72 hours, satisfying this criterion.\n    *   C. At least two of: unilateral, pulsating, moderate/severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity. The patient's headaches are unilateral, throbbing (pulsating), and aggravated by activity. This criterion is met (3 of 4 features).\n    *   D. At least one of: nausea/vomiting, photophobia/phonophobia. The patient has nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. This criterion is met.\n    *   E. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. This requires excluding secondary causes.\n\n    The patient's presentation is a textbook example of migraine without aura. The history of similar headaches since age 18 further supports a long-standing primary headache disorder.\n\n2.  **Risk Stratification (Assessment for Secondary Causes):** Before confirming a primary headache diagnosis, one must systematically exclude secondary, and potentially life-threatening, causes. This is accomplished by searching for \"red flag\" features. The problem explicitly states that a comprehensive screen using the SNOOP10 framework was conducted and was negative. This finding is central to the diagnostic conclusion. The absence of any red flags signifies that the patient is in a very low-risk category.\n\n3.  **Pretest Probability and the Utility of Diagnostic Testing:** The pretest probability of finding a significant intracranial pathology (e.g., tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation) in a patient with a long-standing, stable headache pattern that meets criteria for migraine, who is young and has a normal neurological examination, is exceedingly low. Evidence from numerous large-scale studies shows that the diagnostic yield of neuroimaging (MRI or CT) in this population is less than 1%, approaching the background rate of finding incidental, clinically irrelevant abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals.\n\n4.  **Application of Clinical Practice Guidelines:** Major neurological and headache-focused societies (e.g., American Academy of Neurology, American Headache Society) and value-based care initiatives (e.g., Choosing Wisely) have established clear guidelines based on this evidence. These guidelines strongly recommend **against** performing routine neuroimaging in patients who present with typical migraine features and have a normal neurological examination.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Most Appropriate Next Step:** Based on the above principles:\n    *   A confident clinical diagnosis of primary migraine without aura can be made.\n    *   Neuroimaging is not indicated and would represent low-value care, exposing the patient to potential iatrogenic harm from incidental findings and unnecessary costs without a reasonable expectation of benefit.\n    *   The patient's anxiety should be addressed through education, reassurance, and the formulation of a clear therapeutic plan, not by ordering a test that is not clinically justified.\n    *   The management plan should include education about the nature of migraine, initiation of appropriate evidence-based acute therapy (e.g., a triptan or NSAID), discussion of lifestyle modifications, and arranging a follow-up appointment to assess treatment efficacy and consider preventive therapy if needed.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Defer neuroimaging; diagnose a primary migraine without aura, initiate evidence-based acute therapy and education, and arrange follow-up while advising that imaging is not indicated in the absence of SNOOP10 features due to very low diagnostic yield.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derived solution. It correctly identifies the diagnosis, correctly determines that imaging is not indicated based on risk stratification (absence of SNOOP10 features) and low diagnostic yield, and outlines the correct initial management steps including education, therapy, and follow-up. This is the standard of care.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast now to rule out secondary causes given the patient’s anxiety, because MRI is sensitive and avoids ionizing radiation.**\nThis option is incorrect. While the patient's anxiety is a real concern, acceding to a request for a test that is not clinically indicated violates the principles of evidence-based medicine and risk stratification. The very low pretest probability of a secondary cause makes imaging an inappropriate step. Acting on anxiety alone, without clinical justification, leads to over-testing, increased costs, and the risk of managing incidental findings. The clinician's role includes educating the patient about why the test is unnecessary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Obtain noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage because the headaches are severe, even though the onset is gradual and the neurological examination is normal.**\nThis option is incorrect. The primary indication for a noncontrast head CT in the evaluation of headache is a suspected acute hemorrhage, which is most strongly suggested by a \"thunderclap\" onset (maximal intensity reached instantaneously or within 1 minute). This patient's headache evolves over 30 minutes, which is inconsistent with a typical presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Migraine headaches are characteristically severe; severity alone, in the context of a typical migraine pattern and normal exam, is not an indication for imaging.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Order erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to screen for giant cell arteritis given the recurrent nature of the headaches, despite the patient’s age and normal examination.**\nThis option is unequivocally incorrect. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a disease of the elderly, with an age of onset almost exclusively over 50 years. It is exceptionally rare in a 24-year-old. Screening for GCA in this demographic is inappropriate and has a pretest probability that is functionally zero. The clinical picture is also inconsistent with GCA. This represents flawed epidemiological and clinical reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

She reports using sumatriptan on approximately 12 days per month and taking ibuprofen nearly every day. Prior to this escalation, her migraines occurred on 3–4 days per month and responded to triptans. She drinks 3–4 cups of coffee daily and has mild essential hypertension. She denies red flag symptoms (no fever, focal neurologic deficits, neck stiffness, weight loss, immunosuppression, or cancer history).

No history of peptic ulcer disease, diabetes mellitus, or steroid-induced psychosis.\n-   **Task:** The core task is to first determine if the clinical presentation is consistent with Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH) based on established definitions, and then to select the most appropriate comprehensive management plan. The plan must be feasible for an outpatient setting and address withdrawal, bridge therapy, preventive treatment initiation, and patient education.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in clinical neurology and headache medicine. It references the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which is the global standard for diagnosing headache disorders. The concept of Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH), the associated pathophysiology of central sensitization, and the principles of its management (withdrawal, bridge therapy, preventive treatment) are all well-established, evidence-based medical concepts. The patient presentation is a classic and common clinical scenario.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient clinical data to apply diagnostic criteria for MOH. It then asks for the evaluation of several management plans against established principles of care. This structure allows for a single, most appropriate answer to be determined through logical application of medical knowledge.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective, presenting clinical facts without subjective or biased language.\n\nBased on the validation checklist:\n-   The problem does not violate scientific principles (Flaw 1).\n-   It is a formalizable clinical problem relevant to the specified topic (Flaw 2).\n-   The setup is complete and internally consistent (Flaw 3).\n-   The scenario is clinically realistic and common (Flaw 4).\n-   The question is clearly structured to have a unique, best answer among the choices (Flaw 5).\n-   The problem is substantive and not trivial (Flaw 6).\n-   The principles involved are verifiable through clinical guidelines and research (Flaw 7).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Diagnosis of Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH)**\n\nThe diagnosis of MOH is based on the criteria from the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). The core criteria are:\n1.  Headache occurring on $\\ge 15$ days per month in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder.\n2.  Regular overuse for $>3$ months of one or more drugs for acute or symptomatic headache treatment.\n    -   The definition of overuse for triptans is intake on $\\ge 10$ days per month.\n    -   The definition of overuse for simple analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen) is intake on $\\ge 15$ days per month.\n3.  The headache is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.\n\nApplying these criteria to the given patient data:\n1.  **Headache Frequency:** The patient reports \"near-daily headaches,\" which satisfies the criterion of $\\ge 15$ headache days per month. She has a pre-existing primary headache disorder (migraine without aura).\n2.  **Medication Overuse:**\n    -   She uses sumatriptan (a triptan) on approximately 12 days per month. This meets the overuse criterion of $\\ge 10$ days per month.\n    -   She uses ibuprofen (a simple analgesic) \"nearly every day.\" This meets the overuse criterion of $\\ge 15$ days per month.\n    -   This pattern of use has persisted for \"4 months,\" which is longer than the required 3-month period.\n3.  **Alternative Diagnosis:** The headache evolution (from episodic to chronic) concurrent with the escalation of acute medication use is the quintessential clinical signature of MOH. The absence of red flag symptoms and the normal neurologic examination make a secondary headache disorder unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the clinical picture is definitively consistent with **Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH)**, superimposed on a background of chronic migraine. The high caffeine intake is also a significant contributing factor to headache chronification and MOH.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Management Plans**\n\nA sound management plan for MOH in this patient must be comprehensive, evidence-based, and feasible in the outpatient setting. Key components include:\n1.  **Withdrawal:** Abrupt cessation of the overused medications (triptans and simple analgesics) is the standard approach.\n2.  **Bridge Therapy:** Providing short-term medication to manage the anticipated withdrawal headache improves patient comfort and adherence.\n3.  **Preventive Therapy:** Initiating an effective preventive medication for the underlying migraine disorder is crucial for long-term success and should ideally be started at the time of withdrawal.\n4.  **Patient Education:** Counseling on the nature of MOH, the rationale for the plan, expectations for withdrawal, and strict limits on future acute medication use (e.g., the \"2-day rule\") is essential. Managing contributing factors like caffeine is also important.\n5.  **Follow-up:** Close monitoring is required to support the patient and adjust the plan.\n\nI will now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n---\n\n**A. Abruptly stop sumatriptan and ibuprofen; provide a bridge with scheduled naproxen and a short oral corticosteroid taper plus antiemetics as needed; initiate a preventive agent (for example, topiramate) at a low dose and titrate; counsel to limit any acute medications to no more than 2 days per week going forward, reduce caffeine, and discuss relapse risk; arrange close follow-up in 2–4 weeks.**\n\n-   **Withdrawal:** \"Abruptly stop sumatriptan and ibuprofen\" is the correct strategy for these drug classes.\n-   **Bridge Therapy:** A bridge of \"scheduled naproxen\" (a long-acting NSAID) and a \"short oral corticosteroid taper\" is a robust, evidence-supported strategy to mitigate withdrawal headache. The inclusion of antiemetics is appropriate. The patient's history (no peptic ulcer disease, no diabetes, only mild hypertension) makes this a reasonable and safe short-term option.\n-   **Preventive Therapy:** \"initiate a preventive agent (for example, topiramate) at a low dose and titrate\" is the correct approach. Starting prevention concurrently with withdrawal improves outcomes. Topiramate is a first-line option for migraine prevention, and its use is acceptable as the patient is not planning pregnancy.\n-   **Patient Education:** Comprehensive counseling is included: limiting future acute medication use to \"no more than 2 days per week,\" reducing caffeine, and discussing relapse risk. This is critical for long-term success.\n-   **Follow-up:** A follow-up interval of \"2–4 weeks\" is appropriate for monitoring the initial, most challenging phase of treatment.\n\nThis plan is comprehensive, consistent with best practices, and tailored to the patient.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n---\n\n**B. Gradually taper sumatriptan over 4 weeks while continuing ibuprofen as needed; start a Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody and prescribe a short course of butalbital-containing analgesics to bridge; defer counseling on triggers and relapse until after headache frequency decreases; follow up in 3 months.**\n\n-   **Withdrawal:** \"Gradually taper sumatriptan over 4 weeks\" is not the standard of care; abrupt cessation is preferred. \"Continuing ibuprofen as needed\" is counter-therapeutic as it is one of the offending agents. This strategy prolongs the overuse.\n-   **Bridge Therapy:** \"prescribe a short course of butalbital-containing analgesics to bridge\" is a grave error. Butalbital has an extremely high risk for causing MOH and physical dependence. Introducing it would be iatrogenic and dangerous.\n-   **Patient Education:** \"defer counseling\" is a major flaw. Patient education is a cornerstone of MOH treatment and must be provided at the outset.\n-   **Follow-up:** A \"3 month\" follow-up is dangerously long and inadequate for a patient undergoing withdrawal.\n\nThis plan contains multiple elements that are contrary to established principles and potentially harmful.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n**C. Abruptly stop all acute medications without any bridge therapy; delay preventive treatment until 4 weeks after withdrawal to avoid confounding; instruct the patient to tolerate rebound symptoms without adjunctive support; no need to counsel on caffeine reduction or limits on future acute use until withdrawal completes.**\n\n-   **Bridge Therapy:** The absence of \"any bridge therapy\" represents a \"cold turkey\" approach. While it can work, it is unnecessarily harsh and leads to a high rate of failure due to severe, untreated withdrawal symptoms. Modern practice favors a supported withdrawal.\n-   **Preventive Therapy:** A \"delay [in] preventive treatment until 4 weeks after withdrawal\" is suboptimal. Evidence supports initiating a preventive at the time of withdrawal to improve long-term outcomes by treating the underlying primary headache disorder.\n-   **Patient Education:** Deferring essential counseling on caffeine and future medication limits is a significant omission.\n-   **Overall Approach:** This plan is punitive and not patient-centered, likely resulting in poor adherence and outcome.\n\nThis plan deviates from the modern, supportive standard of care.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n**D. Admit for inpatient detoxification and control pain with high-dose opioid analgesia for 1 week; after discharge, allow triptan use up to 10 days per month; provide an educational pamphlet and schedule routine follow-up in 6 months without initiating a preventive agent.**\n\n-   **Setting:** \"Admit for inpatient detoxification\" is not indicated. Outpatient management is the standard for MOH from triptans and NSAIDs in a patient without severe comorbidities.\n-   **Bridge Therapy:** Using \"high-dose opioid analgesia\" is highly inappropriate and dangerous. It risks creating a new, more severe dependence and is not a recommended treatment for migraine or MOH withdrawal.\n-   **Preventive Therapy:** Omitting the initiation of a preventive agent is a critical failure of the plan. Without effective prevention, relapse into MOH is highly likely.\n-   **Patient Education:** Advising the patient they can \"allow triptan use up to 10 days per month\" is poor counseling. This is the threshold for overuse, not a safe limit for use. The goal is to stay well below this threshold.\n-   **Follow-up:** A \"6 months\" follow-up is grossly inadequate.\n\nThis plan is inappropriate, unsafe, and omits the most crucial elements of long-term management.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The SNOOP10 framework refers to red flags including systemic symptoms or illness, neurologic symptoms or signs, sudden onset (thunderclap), older age at onset, and an expanded set of positional, precipitated, papilledema, pregnancy/postpartum, painful eye with autonomic features, post-traumatic onset, immunocompromise (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV), and progressive or persistent pattern change features. The algorithm must also honor core internal medicine principles: using pretest probability to decide when imaging or invasive tests cross the test threshold, prioritizing life-threatening causes (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage), and avoiding low-value testing when the probability of serious disease is low.\n\nFive patients present on the same clinic day.

The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe specified algorithm has the following core rules:\n1. A structured red-flag screen using the SNOOP10 framework is the first step.\n2. Patients with positive red flags are routed to emergent imaging and targeted workup for secondary causes, prioritizing life-threatening conditions.\n3. Patients with a negative red-flag screen are classified using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria for primary headache disorders, and low-value, indiscriminate testing is to be avoided.\n\nLet us apply this algorithm to each patient.\n\nPatient 1: A 28-year-old woman with a sudden, severe, “worst-ever” headache (thunderclap onset).\n- **SNOOP10 Screen:** Positive for **O**nset (sudden/thunderclap). This is a critical red flag.\n- **Algorithm Application:** According to rule #2, the presence of a red flag mandates an emergent workup to rule out life-threatening causes. The primary concern with a thunderclap headache is subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The standard first step is an emergent noncontrast head Computed Tomography (CT) scan. However, the sensitivity of a CT scan for SAH decreases with time from headache onset. Given the high pretest probability conferred by the thunderclap onset and neck stiffness, a negative CT scan does not definitively rule out SAH. Therefore, if the noncontrast head CT is negative, further testing is required. This typically involves a lumbar puncture (LP) to look for red blood cells or xanthochromia in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, CT angiography (CTA) is often performed to identify an underlying aneurysm, which is the most common cause of SAH, or other vascular pathologies like reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).\n- **Correct Next Step:** Emergent noncontrast head CT. If negative, proceed with LP and/or CTA.\n\nPatient 2: A 62-year-old man with new-onset headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness.\n- **SNOOP10 Screen:** Positive for **O**lder age at onset (age is greater than 50) and **S**ystemic symptoms (jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and morning stiffness are highly suggestive of a systemic vasculitis).\n- **Algorithm Application:** According to rule #2, these red flags warrant a targeted workup for a secondary cause. The clinical presentation is classic for Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), a medical emergency due to the risk of irreversible vision loss from arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The algorithm prioritizes life-threatening (or, in this case, organ-threatening) conditions. The standard urgent workup for suspected GCA includes measuring inflammatory markers, specifically the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Based on high clinical suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids should be initiated immediately, without waiting for further test results, to prevent blindness. The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by a temporal artery biopsy, which should be arranged promptly but can be performed within 1–2 weeks of starting steroids.\n- **Correct Next Step:** Urgently order ESR and CRP, initiate high-dose corticosteroids, and arrange for a temporal artery biopsy.\n\nPatient 3: A 24-year-old woman with a 1-year history of recurrent, stereotypical headaches without red flags.\n- **SNOOP10 Screen:** Negative, as explicitly stated. The history is chronic and stable, and the examination is normal.\n- **Algorithm Application:** According to rule #3, in the absence of red flags, the next step is to classify the primary headache phenotype using ICHD-3 criteria and avoid low-value testing. The patient's symptoms—recurrent attacks lasting 4 to 24 hours, unilateral and pulsating quality, aggravation by routine activity, and associated nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia—are a textbook fit for **migraine without aura** as defined by ICHD-3. The algorithm explicitly directs to avoid routine imaging in such cases.\n- **Correct Next Step:** Classify the headache as migraine based on ICHD-3 criteria and avoid neuroimaging.\n\nPatient 4: A 38-year-old man with bouts of severe, strictly unilateral orbital pain with autonomic features.\n- **SNOOP10 Screen:** The problem states the screen is \"otherwise negative\" but correctly identifies the **P**ainful eye with autonomic features as a listed SNOOP10 item.\n- **Algorithm Application:** While these features are part of a classic primary headache syndrome, the presence of a \"red flag\" feature necessitates careful consideration of secondary causes, per rule #2. The clinical picture is classic for a Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgia (TAC), specifically **cluster headache**, by ICHD-3 criteria. However, secondary causes, such as pituitary or other parasellar lesions, can mimic TACs. Therefore, the principle of a \"targeted\" workup applies. While not typically an emergency on the level of SAH, standard practice and the logic of the algorithm (using red flags to trigger testing for secondary causes) dictate that neuroimaging should be performed at least once in a patient with a new diagnosis of a TAC. The most sensitive imaging for this purpose is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain, with particular attention to the pituitary/sellar region.\n- **Correct Next Step:** Classify as a TAC (cluster headache) per ICHD-3 and obtain a targeted brain MRI with sellar views to exclude a secondary structural cause.\n\nPatient 5: A 30-year-old woman with headache, visual symptoms, and bilateral papilledema.\n- **SNOOP10 Screen:** Positive for **P**apilledema and **P**rogressive or persistent pattern, both major red flags for increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\n- **Algorithm Application:** According to rule #2, these red flags demand an urgent workup. The presence of papilledema signifies increased ICP, which could be caused by a space-occupying lesion (e.g., tumor), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or hydrocephalus. Performing an LP before ruling out a mass lesion is contraindicated due to the risk of cerebral herniation. Therefore, **neuroimaging must precede LP**. The optimal imaging modality to evaluate for both structural lesions and venous sinus pathology is an **MRI of the brain combined with Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV)**. If this imaging is non-revealing (i.e., rules out a mass, hydrocephalus, and CVST), the next step is to perform an LP to measure the opening pressure and analyze the CSF. An elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition would confirm a diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), which is highly likely given the patient's demographics and clinical features.\n- **Correct Next Step:** Obtain an MRI of the brain with MRV. If negative for a structural cause, proceed with an LP to measure opening pressure.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options against these derived correct steps.\n\n**Option A:**\n- Patient 1: LP immediately. Incorrect. Imaging must come first.\n- Patient 2: Noncontrast head CT only. Incorrect. This is a low-yield test for GCA.\n- Patient 3: Order MRI for all headaches. Incorrect. This violates the algorithm's directive to avoid low-value testing.\n- Patient 4: Treat as sinusitis. Incorrect diagnosis.\n- Patient 5: Perform LP first. Incorrect and dangerous.\nThis option is entirely incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n- Patient 1: Obtain emergent noncontrast head CT; if negative, add CTA and perform LP. Correct. This follows the standard, safe, and thorough protocol for thunderclap headache.\n- Patient 2: Order ESR/CRP, initiate corticosteroids, arrange temporal artery biopsy. Correct. This follows the standard of care for suspected GCA.\n- Patient 3: Classify as migraine per ICHD-3 and avoid routine imaging. Correct. This adheres perfectly to the algorithm for a red-flag-negative primary headache.\n- Patient 4: Classify as a TAC (cluster headache) and obtain targeted MRI with sellar views. Correct. This correctly identifies the syndrome and the need for targeted imaging to rule out secondary mimics.\n- Patient 5: Obtain MRI with MRV, then perform LP if imaging is nonrevealing. Correct. This follows the mandatory \"image before LP\" rule in the setting of papilledema and chooses the optimal imaging and sequence of tests.\nThis option is correct for all five patients.\n\n**Option C:**\n- Patient 1: Observe without imaging. Incorrect and dangerous.\n- Patient 2: Reassure and start NSAIDs. Incorrect. Fails to address the risk of blindness from GCA.\n- Patient 3: Diagnose tension-type headache and order CT. Incorrect diagnosis and incorrect action (unnecessary imaging).\n- Patient 4: Avoid imaging. Incorrect. Imaging is warranted for a new TAC diagnosis.\n- Patient 5: Diagnose migraine. Incorrect diagnosis, ignoring the critical finding of papilledema.\nThis option is entirely incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n- Patient 1: Discharge if CT is negative. Incorrect. A negative CT is insufficient to rule out SAH in this high-risk scenario.\n- Patient 2: Order MRI and delay steroids. Incorrect. This misdirects the workup and dangerously delays sight-saving treatment.\n- Patient 3: Obtain routine MRI. Incorrect. This is unnecessary low-value testing.\n- Patient 4: Start oxygen without imaging. Incorrect. Imaging is a necessary part of the initial workup.\n- Patient 5: Refer to ophthalmology only. Incorrect. This dangerously defers the necessary urgent neuroimaging.\nThis option is entirely incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly applies the specified algorithm to all five patient cases is B.",
