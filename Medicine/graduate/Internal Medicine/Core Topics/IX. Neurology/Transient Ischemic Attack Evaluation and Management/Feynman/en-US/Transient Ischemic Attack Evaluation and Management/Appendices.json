A key challenge is to rapidly identify patients at the highest risk of suffering a completed stroke in the hours and days following the TIA. The ABCD2 score is a widely validated and essential tool for this purpose, allowing clinicians to quantify short-term stroke risk based on simple clinical parameters. This practice will allow you to apply the ABCD2 score to a classic patient presentation, reinforcing the key factors that guide decisions about hospital admission and the urgency of the diagnostic workup.

The task requires the application of a risk stratification tool. The specified components—age, blood pressure, clinical features, symptom duration, and diabetes—are the exact components of the widely used and validated ABCD2 score for predicting short-term stroke risk after a TIA. The scenario is clinically realistic and based on established medical knowledge in the field of internal medicine and neurology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data to calculate the score using the implied ABCD2 rule. The question is unambiguous and asks for a single numerical output, which can be uniquely determined from the givens.\n- **Objective:** The data consist of objective clinical findings (age, blood pressure) and historical facts (symptom characteristics, duration, comorbidities). The language is precise and free of subjective bias.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of a patient's early post-TIA stroke risk score based on a specific set of clinical parameters. The parameters described—Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and presence of Diabetes—uniquely identify the ABCD2 scoring system.\n\nThe ABCD2 score is calculated by summing the points assigned to each of its five components:\n\n1.  **A**ge: $1$ point is assigned if age is $\\ge 60$ years.\n    The patient's age is $72$ years. Since $72 \\geq 60$, this component contributes $1$ point.\n\n2.  **B**lood Pressure: $1$ point is assigned if the initial blood pressure is $\\ge 140/90\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ (i.e., systolic $\\ge 140\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ or diastolic $\\ge 90\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$).\n    The patient's blood pressure is $150/95\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The systolic pressure of $150\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is greater than or equal to $140\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and the diastolic pressure of $95\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is greater than or equal to $90\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. This component contributes $1$ point.\n\n3.  **C**linical Features: Points are assigned based on the type of transient neurologic deficit.\n    - Unilateral weakness: $2$ points.\n    - Speech disturbance without weakness: $1$ point.\n    - Other symptoms (e.g., sensory only, visual only, ataxia): $0$ points.\n    The patient experienced \"left arm weakness\". This qualifies as unilateral weakness. This component contributes $2$ points. The problem states \"denies speech difficulty\", so no additional points are awarded for that feature.\n\n4.  **D**uration of symptoms: Points are assigned based on how long the symptoms lasted.\n    - Duration $\\ge 60$ minutes: $2$ points.\n    - Duration $10-59$ minutes: $1$ point.\n    - Duration $< 10$ minutes: $0$ points.\n    The patient's symptoms lasted for $35$ minutes. This duration falls within the $10-59$ minute range. This component contributes $1$ point.\n\n5.  **D**iabetes: $1$ point is assigned for a history of diabetes mellitus.\n    The patient has a history of type $2$ diabetes mellitus. This component contributes $1$ point.\n\nThe total ABCD2 score is the sum of the points from each component:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Age}) + (\\text{Blood Pressure}) + (\\text{Clinical Features}) + (\\text{Duration}) + (\\text{Diabetes}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 $$\n\nAccording to the standard interpretation of the ABCD2 score, the risk of stroke within $2$ days is stratified as follows:\n- Score $0-3$: Low risk\n- Score $4-5$: Moderate risk\n- Score $6-7$: High risk\n\nThe patient's score of $6$ places him in the high-risk category for a stroke in the subsequent $48$ hours, a finding that would typically warrant hospital admission for expedited evaluation and management.

The patient's SBP is $168\\,\\text{mmHg}$. This criterion is met. This contributes $+1$ point.\n- **A** (Abnormal renal or liver function): This criterion requires either abnormal renal function (defined as presence of chronic dialysis, renal transplantation, or serum creatinine $\\ge 200\\,\\mu\\text{mol/L}$) OR abnormal liver function (chronic hepatic disease or significant derangement in liver function tests). The patient's serum creatinine is $2.4\\,\\text{mg/dL}$.

This criterion is not met. This contributes $+0$ points.\n- **E** (Elderly): Defined as age $> 65$ years. The patient is $78$ years old. This criterion is met. This contributes $+1$ point.\n- **D** (Drugs or alcohol): This requires concomitant use of drugs predisposing to bleeding (e.g., antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs) OR excess alcohol intake ($> 8$ drinks/week). The patient is taking both aspirin (an antiplatelet agent) and ibuprofen (an NSAID). The drug criterion is met. Her alcohol intake of $2$ drinks/week is not excessive. As the drug criterion is met, this contributes $+1$ point.\n\nThe total score $S_{\\text{HAS}}$ is the sum of these points:\n$$S_{\\text{HAS}} = 1(\\text{H}) + 1(\\text{A}) + 1(\\text{S}) + 0(\\text{B}) + 0(\\text{L}) + 1(\\text{E}) + 1(\\text{D})$$\n$$S_{\\text{HAS}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5$$\n\n#### Calculation of the Anticoagulation Decision Composite ($I$)\n\nThe composite index $I$ is defined as the difference between the two scores:\n$$I = S_{\\text{CHA}} - S_{\\text{HAS}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$I = 9 - 5 = 4$$\n\nThe value of the Anticoagulation Decision Composite for this patient is $4$.",

There are no contraindications to anticoagulation, no significant drug-drug interactions, and head imaging has excluded intracranial hemorrhage. The clinical data are:\n- Female, age $72$ years\n- Height $165$ cm, weight $60$ kg (body mass index approximately normal)\n- Serum creatinine $1.6$ mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen $22$ mg/dL\n- Blood pressure $132/78$ mmHg, heart rate $88$ beats per minute (irregularly irregular)\n- No known hepatic dysfunction, platelets $210 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$, international normalized ratio $1.0$\n\nUsing fundamental pharmacokinetic principles that dosing of renally cleared anticoagulants is adjusted to renal function, and that creatinine clearance is estimated for drug dosing with the Cockcroft–Gault equation, determine the recommended apixaban dose per administration (in milligrams) for stroke prevention in this patient with TIA attributed to AF.

Do not include units in your final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the appropriate dose of apixaban for a patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) based on provided clinical data. The solution involves a two-step process: first, an assessment of the patient's renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and second, the application of established, evidence-based dosing guidelines for apixaban that incorporate renal function and other patient characteristics.\n\nFirst, we must estimate the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl), which is a measure of renal function used for drug dosing. The problem specifies the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The formula for creatinine clearance in mL/min is:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{\\text{SCr} \\times 72} $$\nwhere age is in years, weight is the actual body weight in kilograms (kg), and serum creatinine (SCr) is in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For female patients, the result is multiplied by a correction factor of $0.85$.\n\nThe given clinical data for this patient are:\n- Age: $72$ years\n- Weight: $60$ kg\n- Serum Creatinine (SCr): $1.6$ mg/dL\n- Sex: Female\n\nSubstituting these values into the Cockcroft-Gault equation for a female patient:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - 72) \\times 60}{1.6 \\times 72} $$\nWe perform the calculation in steps. First, the numerator:\n$$ (140 - 72) \\times 60 = 68 \\times 60 = 4080 $$\nNext, the denominator:\n$$ 1.6 \\times 72 = 115.2 $$\nNow, we can compute the clearance before applying the sex-based correction factor:\n$$ \\frac{4080}{115.2} \\approx 35.4167 \\, \\text{mL/min} $$\nApplying the correction factor of $0.85$ for a female patient:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 0.85 \\times 35.4167 \\, \\text{mL/min} \\approx 30.104 \\, \\text{mL/min} $$\nThe patient's estimated creatinine clearance is approximately $30.1$ mL/min. This value quantifies the patient's renal function for the purpose of drug dosing.\n\nNext, we apply the standard prescribing principles for apixaban in patients with nonvalvular AF. The standard dose is $5$ mg taken twice daily. However, a reduced dose of $2.5$ mg twice daily is indicated if the patient meets at least **two** of the following three criteria:\n1. Age $\\ge 80$ years\n2. Body weight $\\le 60$ kg\n3. Serum creatinine $\\ge 1.5$ mg/dL\n\nWe must now evaluate the patient against these criteria using the provided data:\n1. **Age**: The patient's age is $72$ years. Since $72 < 80$, this criterion is **not met**.\n2. **Body weight**: The patient's weight is $60$ kg.Since $60 \\le 60$, this criterion is **met**.\n3. **Serum creatinine**: The patient's serum creatinine is $1.6$ mg/dL. Since $1.6 \\ge 1.5$, this criterion is **met**.\n\nThe patient meets two of the three criteria for dose reduction (body weight $\\le 60$ kg and serum creatinine $\\ge 1.5$ mg/dL). Therefore, the standard dose of $5$ mg must be reduced. The recommended dose for this patient is $2.5$ mg per administration (taken twice daily).\n\nIt is also important to note that a dose of $2.5$ mg twice daily is recommended for patients with CrCl between $15$ and $29$ mL/min, irrespective of the other criteria. This patient's calculated CrCl is $30.1$ mL/min, which is just above this range. Thus, the decision correctly relies on the three-point criteria system. The clinical characteristics (specifically, low body weight and elevated serum creatinine) are the deciding factors that alter the dose selection from the standard $5$ mg to the reduced $2.5$ mg.\n\nThe question asks for the dose per administration in milligrams, rounded to three significant figures. The calculated dose is $2.5$ mg. Expressed to three significant figures, this is $2.50$ mg.",
