This practice hones your ability to apply the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria, which is fundamental to modern rheumatologic practice. By working through this case, you will learn to integrate patient history, extra-articular manifestations, and key imaging findings—particularly the distinction between normal radiographs and active inflammation on MRI—to accurately classify a patient with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis .",

            "problem": "A $28$-year-old man presents with chronic low back pain for $18$ months that began at age $26$. He reports pain that worsens with rest, improves within an hour of awakening after morning stiffness, and tends to wake him in the second half of the night. He notes alternating buttock pain and a prior episode of unilateral anterior uveitis $4$ months ago that resolved with topical therapy. He denies psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, urethritis, fever, or weight loss. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provide marked relief. Physical examination shows tenderness over the sacroiliac joints without neurological deficits. C-reactive protein (CRP) is mildly elevated; human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) testing is negative. Pelvic radiographs show no sacroiliac joint erosions or sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints using Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences demonstrates subchondral bone marrow edema in typical periarticular locations on two consecutive slices bilaterally, without definite structural erosions on T1-weighted images.\n\nUsing fundamental principles of classification in axial inflammatory back pain—namely, that classification systems rely on an entry criterion of chronic back pain with onset before age $45$ years and then allocate patients via imaging or clinical arms based on objective evidence of sacroiliitis and spondyloarthritis features—select the single best statement that applies the appropriate imaging and classification rules to establish the most accurate classification for this patient.\n\nA.

MRI lacks sufficient specificity; a radionuclide bone scan is required to confirm sacroiliitis before classification.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical vignette and a question regarding the classification of a patient with suspected axial spondyloarthritis. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a systematic solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Demographics:** $28$-year-old male.\n-   **Symptom Onset and Duration:** Chronic low back pain for $18$ months, with onset at age $26$.\n-   **Symptom Characteristics (Inflammatory Back Pain):** Pain worsens with rest, improves within an hour of awakening after morning stiffness, causes awakening in the second half of the night, alternating buttock pain.\n-   **Extra-articular Manifestations:** Prior episode of unilateral anterior uveitis $4$ months ago, resolved.\n-   **Pertinent Negatives:** Denies psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), urethritis, fever, or weight loss.\n-   **Response to Therapy:** Marked relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n-   **Physical Examination:** Tenderness over the sacroiliac (SI) joints. No neurological deficits.\n-   **Laboratory Findings:** C-reactive protein (CRP) is mildly elevated. Human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) is negative.\n-   **Imaging Findings:**\n    -   **Pelvic Radiographs (X-ray):** No sacroiliac joint erosions or sclerosis.\n    -   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of SI joints:**\n        -   **Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences:** Demonstrates subchondral bone marrow edema in typical periarticular locations on two consecutive slices bilaterally.\n        -   **T1-weighted images:** No definite structural erosions.\n-   **Governing Principle for Classification:** The problem states that classification systems require an entry criterion of chronic back pain with onset before age $45$ years and then utilize imaging or clinical arms based on objective evidence of sacroiliitis and spondyloarthritis (SpA) features.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem statement is scientifically sound. It presents a classic clinical scenario of inflammatory back pain. The patient's history, symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory results are all consistent with the known pathophysiology and epidemiology of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The imaging findings on both X-ray and MRI are described accurately and are pivotal in the modern diagnostic and classification paradigm for this disease. The classification systems mentioned (modified New York and ASAS) are the internationally accepted standards.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to apply the current classification criteria for axSpA. The question asks for the single best statement regarding the patient's classification, which can be determined unambiguously by applying these criteria to the given data.\n-   **Objectivity:** The description is entirely objective, consisting of clinical signs, symptoms, and diagnostic test results. There is no subjective or opinion-based language.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is complete and internally consistent. The finding of negative radiographs but positive MRI for active inflammation is the defining feature of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), and all other clinical features support this. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, scientifically accurate, and solvable clinical reasoning problem. I will now proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to apply the established classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) to the patient's data. The most current and widely used criteria are the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria from $2009$.\n\n**1. ASAS axSpA Entry Criterion:**\nThe patient must have chronic back pain (duration $\\ge 3$ months) with an age of onset $ 45$ years.\n-   The patient's back pain has lasted for $18$ months ($ 3$ months).\n-   The age of onset was $26$ years ($ 45$ years).\n-   **Conclusion:** The patient fulfills the entry criterion.\n\n**2. ASAS axSpA Classification Arms:**\nThe patient must satisfy either the imaging arm OR the clinical arm.\n\n**a. Imaging Arm:**\nThis requires: (Sacroiliitis on imaging) **AND** ($\\ge 1$ SpA feature).\n\n-   **Sacroiliitis on imaging** is defined by the ASAS group as either:\n    1.  Active (acute) inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated with SpA. This is defined as bone marrow edema/osteitis on STIR sequences (or post-contrast T1). The problem states the patient has \"subchondral bone marrow edema in typical periarticular locations on two consecutive slices bilaterally\" on STIR MRI. This precisely meets the ASAS definition of a positive MRI for sacroiliitis.\n    2.  Definitive radiographic sacroiliitis according to the modified New York criteria. The problem states pelvic radiographs show \"no sacroiliac joint erosions or sclerosis\". Therefore, this is not met.\n\n-   Since the patient has a positive MRI for active sacroiliitis, the \"Sacroiliitis on imaging\" criterion is **met**.\n\n-   **SpA features** (patient needs $\\ge 1$):\n    1.  **Inflammatory back pain:** Present.\n    2.  Arthritis: Not mentioned.\n    3.  Enthesitis (heel): Not mentioned.\n    4.  **Uveitis:** Present (history of anterior uveitis).\n    5.  Dactylitis: Not mentioned.\n    6.  Psoriasis: Denied.\n    7.  Crohn’s/Colitis: Denied.\n    8.  **Good response to NSAIDs:** Present (marked relief).\n    9.  Family history of SpA: Not mentioned.\n    10. HLA-B27: Negative.\n    11. **Elevated CRP:** Present.\n\n-   The patient has at least $4$ SpA features. Since only $\\ge 1$ is required, this criterion is **met**.\n\n-   **Conclusion for Imaging Arm:** The patient fulfills the imaging arm of the ASAS axSpA criteria.\n\n**b. Clinical Arm:**\nThis requires: (HLA-B27 positive) **AND** ($\\ge 2$ other SpA features).\n\n-   The patient is stated to be **HLA-B27 negative**.\n-   **Conclusion for Clinical Arm:** The patient does not fulfill the clinical arm of the ASAS axSpA criteria.\n\n**3. Final Classification:**\n-   Since the patient fulfills the ASAS criteria for axSpA (via the imaging arm), they are classified as having axSpA.\n-   The distinction between radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA) and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) is based on the pelvic radiograph.\n    -   r-axSpA requires definitive sacroiliitis on X-ray (fulfilling modified New York criteria).\n    -   nr-axSpA applies to patients who meet ASAS criteria but do not have definitive radiographic sacroiliitis.\n-   This patient's radiographs are negative. Therefore, the correct classification is **non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. He fulfills the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis and should be classified as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.**\n**Analysis:** The modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis are the basis for the diagnosis of radiographic axSpA. A mandatory component of these criteria is radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis (bilateral grade $\\ge 2$ or unilateral grade $\\ge 3$). The problem explicitly states, \"Pelvic radiographs show no sacroiliac joint erosions or sclerosis.\" Thus, the patient does not fulfill these criteria.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. He fulfills the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) axial spondyloarthritis criteria via the imaging arm and should be classified as non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.**\n**Analysis:** As derived above, the patient meets the entry criterion (age of onset $ 45$, chronic pain). He then fulfills the imaging arm by having a positive MRI for sacroiliitis (bone marrow edema on STIR) plus multiple SpA features (inflammatory back pain, uveitis, good NSAID response, elevated CRP). Because his plain radiographs are negative for sacroiliitis, his classification is indeed non-radiographic axSpA. This statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. He does not fulfill ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria because HLA-B27 is negative; HLA-B27 positivity is mandatory for classification.**\n**Analysis:** This statement is false. HLA-B27 positivity is mandatory only for the *clinical arm* of the ASAS criteria. The *imaging arm* does not require HLA-B27 positivity. A patient can be HLA-B27 negative and still be classified with axSpA if they fulfill the imaging arm, as this patient does.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The MRI finding of bone marrow edema is insufficient for classification without structural erosions or fat metaplasia on T1-weighted sequences.**\n**Analysis:** This is incorrect. The ASAS definition of a positive MRI for sacroiliitis is centered on active inflammation, which is best visualized as bone marrow edema (osteitis) on fluid-sensitive sequences like STIR. While structural changes like erosions or fatty metaplasia on T1 sequences can provide confirmatory evidence of chronicity, they are not required to meet the imaging criterion for active sacroiliitis. The presence of characteristic bone marrow edema alone is sufficient for the \"imaging\" part of the imaging arm.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. MRI lacks sufficient specificity; a radionuclide bone scan is required to confirm sacroiliitis before classification.**\n**Analysis:** This statement is factually incorrect and represents an outdated approach. MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting early, active sacroiliitis. It is superior to radionuclide bone scintigraphy, which is non-specific and can be positive in many conditions causing increased bone turnover. The current international classification criteria (ASAS) are based on MRI and radiography, not bone scans.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

He reports the following standardized Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; $0$–$10$ anchors) values collected in clinic: spinal back pain $=7.0$, duration of morning stiffness $=6.0$, patient global assessment of disease activity $=6.5$, and peripheral joint pain/swelling $=2.0$. His C-Reactive Protein (CRP) measured by a validated immunoturbidimetric assay is $12$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.

            "solution": "The goal is to compute the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with C-Reactive Protein (ASDAS-CRP) from standardized inputs. Principle-based reasoning starts from how composite clinical indices are constructed: they combine multiple domains into a single score via a linear combination of standardized patient-reported outcomes and an objective biomarker, with weights derived from regression modeling to maximize discrimination of clinically important change. For skewed biomarkers such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a natural logarithm transformation is used to approximate linearity with clinical outcomes and reduce undue influence of outliers. Adding $1$ inside the logarithm ensures the function is defined when $\\mathrm{CRP}=0$, since $\\ln(0)$ is undefined.\n\nThe validated ASDAS-CRP is an empirically derived linear composite that applies specific weights to four patient-reported domains and a coefficient to the natural logarithm of CRP plus $1$. Using the established, well-tested ASDAS-CRP model, the score is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ASDAS\\!-\\!CRP}\n=\n0.121\\times(\\text{back pain})\n+\n0.058\\times(\\text{morning stiffness duration})\n+\n0.110\\times(\\text{patient global})\n+\n0.073\\times(\\text{peripheral pain/swelling})\n+\n0.579\\times \\ln(\\mathrm{CRP}+1).\n$$\nInsert the patient’s values:\n- Back pain term: $$0.121\\times 7.0 = 0.847.$$\n- Morning stiffness term: $$0.058\\times 6.0 = 0.348.$$\n- Patient global term: $$0.110\\times 6.5 = 0.715.$$\n- Peripheral pain/swelling term: $$0.073\\times 2.0 = 0.146.$$\n- Biomarker term: First compute $$\\ln(\\mathrm{CRP}+1)=\\ln(12+1)=\\ln(13)\\approx 2.564949357,$$ then\n$$0.579\\times 2.564949357 \\approx 1.485105678.$$\n\nSum all contributions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ASDAS\\!-\\!CRP} \\approx 0.847 + 0.348 + 0.715 + 0.146 + 1.485105678 = 3.541105678,\n$$\nwhich rounds to $$3.54.$$\n\nASDAS-CRP categories are defined by validated cutoffs: inactive disease $1.3$, moderate disease activity $1.3$ to $2.1$, high disease activity $\\ge 2.1$ to $\\le 3.5$, and very high disease activity $3.5$. Since $3.543.5$, the category is very high disease activity.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. $3.54$; Very high disease activity. Using the correct natural logarithm transformation $$\\ln(\\mathrm{CRP}+1)$$ and the validated weights yields approximately $3.54$, which is $3.5$ and therefore very high. Verdict — Correct.\n- B. $3.49$; High disease activity. This value is close but corresponds to using $$\\ln(\\mathrm{CRP})$$ (i.e., omitting the $+1$), which gives $$\\ln(12)\\approx 2.48490665,$$ and $$0.579\\times 2.48490665\\approx 1.438761,$$ leading to a total of about $$3.49.$$ While numerically plausible, it is computed with the wrong transformation; moreover, $$3.493.5,$$ placing it in the high (not very high) category. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- C. $2.70$; High disease activity. This matches using the base-$10$ logarithm $$\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{CRP}+1)$$ rather than the natural logarithm, since $$\\log_{10}(13)\\approx 1.113943,$$ and $$0.579\\times 1.113943\\approx 0.645,$$ yielding a total near $$2.70.$$ The transformation is incorrect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- D. $9.00$; Very high disease activity. This corresponds to treating CRP linearly (i.e., $$0.579\\times \\mathrm{CRP}$$), giving $$0.579\\times 12=6.948,$$ and a total near $$9.00.$$ This ignores the required logarithmic transformation, overweights CRP, and grossly inflates the score.

I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient:** $36$-year-old male.\n-   **Diagnosis:** Axial spondyloarthritis.\n-   **Clinical Presentation:** Inflammatory low back pain for $9$ months, worse at night, with morning stiffness.\n-   **Diagnostic Markers:** Human Leukocyte Antigen B27 (HLA-B27) positive; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows active sacroiliitis.\n-   **Co-morbidities/Exclusions:** No psoriasis, uveitis, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n-   **Past Medical History:** Duodenal ulcer $4$ years ago, associated with over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Status of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication is undocumented.\n-   **Social History:** Nonsmoker.\n-   **Vitals  Risk Factors:** Blood pressure $128/78\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol $95\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$; pooled cohort $10$-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk $\\approx 2\\%$.\n-   **Medications:** Not taking anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or systemic corticosteroids.\n-   **Renal Function:** Baseline serum creatinine $0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n-   **Disease Activity Measures:**\n    -   Axial back pain (Numerical Rating Scale, NRS $0$–$10$): $7$.\n    -   Duration of morning stiffness (assumed to be a component for ASDAS): $6$.\n    -   Patient global assessment (NRS $0$–$10$): $8$.\n    -   Peripheral joint pain/swelling (NRS $0$–$10$): $2$.\n-   **Inflammatory Marker:** C-reactive protein (CRP) is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n-   **Mandated First Principles:**\n    1.  Exercise therapy to improve spinal mobility and function.\n    2.  NSAIDs as first-line pharmacotherapy.\n    3.  Evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) risk to inform NSAID and gastroprotection choice.\n    4.  Treat-to-target strategies with escalation guided by Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) categories and objective inflammation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is a realistic clinical case that is scientifically grounded in the principles of modern rheumatology. I will assess its validity.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The case describes a classic presentation of axSpA in a young, HLA-B27 positive male with objective inflammation on MRI (active sacroiliitis) and elevated CRP. The principles provided for management (exercise, NSAIDs, risk assessment, treat-to-target with ASDAS) are the standard of care, consistent with guidelines from major international bodies like the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness  Completeness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient clinical data to assess disease activity and patient-specific risks, which are necessary to formulate a management plan. The question asks for the \"most appropriate initial management plan,\" which can be determined by applying the given principles. A minor ambiguity exists in \"duration of morning stiffness is $6$\". For the ASDAS calculation, this parameter should be in hours. Assuming it is $6$ hours, we can calculate the ASDAS-CRP score using the same formula as the previous problem for consistency:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{ASDAS-CRP} = 0.121 \\times (\\text{Back Pain}) + 0.058 \\times (\\text{Morning Stiffness Duration}) + 0.110 \\times (\\text{Patient Global}) + 0.073 \\times (\\text{Peripheral Pain/Swelling}) + 0.579 \\times \\ln(\\mathrm{CRP} + 1)\n    $$\n    Plugging in the patient's values:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{ASDAS-CRP} = (0.121 \\times 7) + (0.058 \\times 6) + (0.110 \\times 8) + (0.073 \\times 2) + (0.579 \\times \\ln(15 + 1))\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{ASDAS-CRP} = 0.847 + 0.348 + 0.880 + 0.146 + (0.579 \\times \\ln(16))\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{ASDAS-CRP} \\approx 2.221 + (0.579 \\times 2.7726)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{ASDAS-CRP} \\approx 2.221 + 1.6053 \\approx 3.826\n    $$\n    An ASDAS score $\\geq 3.5$ signifies \"very high disease activity\". This calculation, which rounds to $3.83$, confirms that interpreting \"6\" as $6$ hours is consistent with a severe disease presentation and the language used in Option A (\"very high disease activity\").\n-   **Objectivity  Realism:** The data are objective clinical measurements and standard patient-reported outcomes. The patient case is highly realistic.\n-   **Consistency:** There are no internal contradictions. The symptoms, lab values, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of active axSpA.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Management Plan\n\nBased on the provided principles and patient data, the optimal plan involves four key components:\n\n1.  **Exercise Therapy:** For active axSpA, guidelines strongly recommend a structured, supervised physical therapy program over unsupervised general exercise. The program should be tailored to the individual and emphasize spinal mobility, strengthening of core and extensor muscles, posture correction, and exercises to maintain thoracic expansion (deep breathing). A combination of land-based and aquatic therapy is often ideal to reduce joint impact while building strength and mobility. Activity restriction and bed rest are contraindicated.\n\n2.  **NSAID Therapy and Risk Mitigation:**\n    -   **Efficacy:** NSAIDs are first-line. Given the very high disease activity (ASDAS-CRP $\\approx 3.83$), a trial with a maximum recommended dose of an NSAID is warranted.\n    -   **Gastrointestinal (GI) Risk:** The patient is at **high risk** for GI complications due to a prior NSAID-associated duodenal ulcer. Therefore, gastroprotection is mandatory. According to guidelines, for high-GI-risk patients, the preferred strategies are either a non-selective NSAID (e.g., naproxen) combined with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), also combined with a PPI. Use of a COX-2 selective inhibitor alone is not sufficient protection for a patient with a prior ulcer. Additionally, because H. pylori status is unknown, testing and eradication (if positive) are essential to minimize ulcer risk.\n    -   **Cardiovascular (CV) Risk:** The patient has a low $10$-year ASCVD risk ($\\approx 2\\%$). While all NSAIDs carry some CV risk, this patient's low baseline risk makes the choice between naproxen (often preferred for lower CV risk) and a COX-2 inhibitor less critical from a CV standpoint. Celecoxib at a dose of $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily is an appropriate choice.\n\n3.  **Escalation Strategy (Treat-to-Target):**\n    -   The therapeutic goal is to achieve inactive disease (ASDAS $ 1.3$) or at least low disease activity (ASDAS $ 2.1$).\n    -   The patient has very high disease activity (ASDAS $\\approx 3.83$) and objective signs of inflammation (elevated CRP, active sacroiliitis on MRI). These features predict a high likelihood of needing a biologic agent and warrant a rapid treatment strategy.\n    -   The standard approach is to first assess the response to a $2$–$4$ week trial of a full-dose NSAID.\n    -   If, after this trial, there is a non-response, defined as failure to achieve significant improvement (e.g., ASDAS improvement $ 1.1$ units) or ASDAS remaining in the high/very high range (ASDAS $\\geq 2.1$, and especially $\\geq 3.5$), escalation to a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) is indicated. Given the severity, a repeat ASDAS $\\geq 3.5$ would be an unambiguous trigger to escalate.\n    -   First-line bDMARDs for axSpA are typically tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i).\n    -   Sulfasalazine is not effective for axial disease and is not a recommended escalation step for this patient's primary symptoms.\n\n**Synthesized Optimal Plan:** The most appropriate plan is to initiate a supervised, comprehensive exercise program. Pharmacologically, start a full-dose NSAID (e.g., celecoxib $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily) with a concurrent PPI (e.g., omeprazole), and perform H. pylori testing and eradication. Re-assess disease activity with ASDAS in $2$–$4$ weeks. If activity remains very high (ASDAS $\\geq 3.5$), promptly initiate a bDMARD (e.g., a TNFi).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Initiate supervised, structured land-based and aquatic exercise emphasizing spinal mobility, posture, and thoracic expansion; start celecoxib $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily with concurrent omeprazole $20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ daily; test for and eradicate H. pylori; given ASDAS-CRP consistent with very high disease activity and elevated CRP, begin biologic therapy (tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) now or within $2$–$4$ weeks if repeat ASDAS remains $\\geq 3.5$ despite NSAID.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option aligns perfectly with the derived optimal plan. The exercise prescription is best practice. The choice of celecoxib (a COX-2 selective NSAID) at a full therapeutic dose, combined with a PPI (omeprazole) and H. pylori management, is the correct strategy for this high-GI-risk patient. The escalation plan is appropriately aggressive for a patient with very high disease activity and objective inflammation, proposing a short $2$–$4$ week NSAID trial with a clear, evidence-based threshold (ASDAS $\\geq 3.5$) for rapid escalation to a biologic.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Advise activity restriction and bed rest; prescribe indomethacin $75\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily without proton pump inhibitor (PPI) because age $50$ years; defer biologic therapy unless ASDAS is $\\geq 1.3$ after $6$ months.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is incorrect on all counts. (1) Activity restriction is contraindicated. (2) Prescribing a high-risk NSAID like indomethacin without a PPI to a patient with a prior NSAID ulcer is a major error; age does not negate this high-risk feature. (3) Deferring evaluation for $6$ months is far too slow, and the escalation threshold of ASDAS $\\geq 1.3$ is incorrect (it's the threshold for *any* disease activity, not for starting biologics).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Recommend unsupervised general stretching at home; start naproxen $500\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily with omeprazole $20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ daily and H. pylori testing/eradication; re-evaluate in $4$–$12$ weeks and escalate to biologic therapy only if ASDAS remains $\\geq 2.1$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option contains some correct elements but is suboptimal. The NSAID choice (naproxen) with PPI and H. pylori management is valid. However, the exercise recommendation is suboptimal (unsupervised vs. supervised). The re-evaluation timeline of $4$–$12$ weeks is too slow for a patient with very high disease activity. While ASDAS $\\geq 2.1$ is the general threshold for considering biologics, for a patient starting at $\\approx 3.8$, a failure to improve substantially is the key, and a $2$–$4$ week check is standard. This plan is not aggressive enough.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Begin diclofenac $75\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily without PPI given low ASCVD risk; no need for H. pylori testing; escalate to interleukin-17 inhibitor only if radiographic sacroiliitis is present for $2$ years.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is severely flawed. (1) Failing to provide a PPI is incorrect and dangerous given the patient's high GI risk. (2) Ignoring H. pylori testing is also incorrect. (3) The escalation criteria are fabricated and not based on guidelines. Escalation is based on disease activity (ASDAS), not an arbitrary duration of radiographic findings. The patient already has active inflammation on MRI, which is sufficient.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Offer no formal exercise program; prescribe low-dose naproxen $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ once daily without gastroprotection; if ASDAS remains $\\geq 2.1$, add sulfasalazine for axial symptoms before any biologic therapy.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is incorrect in every aspect. (1) No exercise program ignores a core treatment modality. (2) The NSAID dose issubtherapeutic for very high disease activity, and the lack of gastroprotection is unacceptable. (3) Escalating to sulfasalazine for axial disease is an ineffective strategy that would needlessly delay appropriate treatment with a biologic agent.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
