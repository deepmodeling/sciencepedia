            "problem": "A 42-year-old individual with iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome due to chronic dexamethasone therapy is being transitioned to hydrocortisone to restore a more physiologic circadian exposure while avoiding acute hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis withdrawal. You are told to use the well-tested glucocorticoid equivalence relationship that dexamethasone $0.75$ mg is approximately equivalent to hydrocortisone $20$ mg. The current dexamethasone dose is $1$ mg per day. Assume the transition plan aims to match the calculated hydrocortisone-equivalent total daily glucocorticoid exposure initially, and to distribute this total in a physiologic manner with a diurnal split of $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total daily hydrocortisone dose at $08:00$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ at $16:00$. Using these assumptions and only the stated equivalence as your starting fact, determine the morning hydrocortisone dose for this plan. Round your answer to three significant figures. Express your answer in milligrams (mg).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Individual is 42 years old.\n- Condition is iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome due to chronic dexamethasone therapy.\n- Transition goal is to switch to hydrocortisone.\n- Glucocorticoid equivalence relationship: dexamethasone $0.75$ mg is approximately equivalent to hydrocortisone $20$ mg.\n- Current dexamethasone dose: $1$ mg per day.\n- Transition plan: Match the calculated hydrocortisone-equivalent total daily glucocorticoid exposure.\n- Hydrocortisone diurnal split: $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total daily dose at $08:00$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ at $16:00$.\n- Required output: The morning hydrocortisone dose in milligrams (mg), rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity against the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard principles of clinical pharmacology and endocrinology. The concept of glucocorticoid dose equivalence, the management of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, and the simulation of physiologic diurnal cortisol rhythm are all well-established and scientifically sound medical practices. The specific equivalence ratio (dexamethasone $0.75$ mg $\\approx$ hydrocortisone $20$ mg) is a standard conversion used in clinical settings.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with a specific question and provides all necessary quantitative information to arrive at a unique solution. The required calculations are direct and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective medical and pharmacological terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (Scientific Unsoundness, Non-Formalizable, Incomplete Setup, Unrealistic Conditions, Ill-Posed Structure, Pseudo-Profound, or Unverifiable Claims). The inclusion of the patient's age (42 years) is clinically relevant context but is not required for the calculation itself, which does not constitute a flaw.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the total daily hydrocortisone dose that is equivalent to the current dexamethasone dose, and then determining the morning fraction of this total dose.\n\nLet $D_{dexa}$ be the daily dose of dexamethasone, and $D_{hydro, total}$ be the equivalent total daily dose of hydrocortisone. The problem provides the following givens:\n- $D_{dexa} = 1$ mg.\n- The equivalence ratio is $0.75$ mg of dexamethasone to $20$ mg of hydrocortisone.\n\nWe can establish a conversion factor, $C$, from the dexamethasone dose to the hydrocortisone dose using this ratio:\n$$C = \\frac{20 \\text{ mg hydrocortisone}}{0.75 \\text{ mg dexamethasone}}$$\nThe total daily equivalent dose of hydrocortisone, $D_{hydro, total}$, can be calculated as:\n$$D_{hydro, total} = D_{dexa} \\times C$$\nSubstituting the given value for $D_{dexa}$:\n$$D_{hydro, total} = 1 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{20}{0.75}$$\nThe fraction $0.75$ can be written as $\\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore:\n$$D_{hydro, total} = 1 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{20}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 1 \\times \\frac{20 \\times 4}{3} \\text{ mg} = \\frac{80}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem states that the total daily dose is split, with the morning dose, $D_{morning}$, being $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total daily dose.\n$$D_{morning} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times D_{hydro, total}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $D_{hydro, total}$:\n$$D_{morning} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{80}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{morning} = \\frac{160}{9} \\text{ mg}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction and round it to three significant figures as required.\n$$D_{morning} = \\frac{160}{9} \\text{ mg} \\approx 17.777... \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we examine the fourth significant digit. Since the fourth digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, we round up the third significant digit.\n$$D_{morning} \\approx 17.8 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe morning hydrocortisone dose for the transition plan is $17.8$ mg.",

            "problem": "A patient with systemic vasculitis has received chronic exogenous glucocorticoids for more than $12$ months and is currently tapering prednisone to $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ each morning. On a pre-dose morning draw (before the usual daily prednisone), the serum cortisol is $3$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$. You plan to evaluate recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, defined as the integrated response of the hypothalamus secreting corticotropin-releasing hormone, the pituitary corticotrophs releasing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and the adrenal cortex synthesizing cortisol. The cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH $1$-$24$) stimulation test is chosen to directly probe adrenal cortical responsiveness to ACTH independent of hypothalamic and pituitary input.\n\nUsing well-established facts that chronic exogenous glucocorticoids suppress endogenous ACTH via negative feedback, that adrenal cortical responsiveness declines with prolonged ACTH deficiency, and that the standard high-dose cosyntropin test administers $250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ of cosyntropin intramuscularly or intravenously (IV) with serum cortisol measured at $0$, $30$, and $60$ minutes, select the single best plan that both properly prepares and performs the test and correctly interprets the following obtained values to guide further tapering and coverage for physiological stress.\n\nTest details: The evening dose of hydrocortisone-equivalent was held before testing and the morning dose was deferred until after sampling. Serum cortisol results were $3 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $0$ minutes, $16 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $30$ minutes, and $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $60$ minutes.\n\nWhich option best integrates appropriate test administration conditions, interpretation of these results, and the recommended steroid taper strategy?\n\nA. Proceed with the standard $250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ cosyntropin test at $08:00$ after holding potentially assay-interfering glucocorticoids, interpret a peak cortisol $18 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ as inadequate adrenal reserve consistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency from HPA suppression, convert to physiologic hydrocortisone replacement (for example, $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ in the morning and $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ in the afternoon), provide stress-dose coverage for intercurrent illness or procedures, taper slowly, and repeat testing in $4$–$6$ weeks to reassess recovery.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, internally consistent, and free of ambiguity. It describes a classic clinical scenario in endocrinology: assessing for iatrogenic secondary adrenal insufficiency in a patient tapering off long-term glucocorticoids. The provided data are realistic and sufficient to arrive at a definitive clinical management plan. The problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to interpret the results of a standard high-dose ($250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$) cosyntropin stimulation test and formulate an appropriate management plan.\n\n**Analysis of the Patient's State and Test Results:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** A patient on chronic glucocorticoids (prednisone for $12$ months) is at high risk for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. The current dose of $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of prednisone is near physiologic equivalence ($5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ prednisone $\\approx$ $20$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ hydrocortisone, the latter representing typical daily cortisol production), a common point at which underlying adrenal insufficiency becomes clinically apparent.\n\n2.  **Baseline Cortisol:** The pre-dose morning cortisol is $3$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$. In a healthy individual, the morning cortisol level should be at its peak, typically above $10$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$. A value below $5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. This baseline value justifies proceeding with dynamic testing.\n\n3.  **Cosyntropin Stimulation Test Principle:** The test administers a supraphysiologic dose of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) to maximally stimulate the adrenal glands. It directly assesses the functional reserve of the adrenal cortex. In long-standing secondary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands may atrophy due to chronic lack of endogenous ACTH stimulation and thus may not respond adequately.\n\n4.  **Interpretation of Test Results:** The serum cortisol values are $3 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $0$ minutes, $16 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $30$ minutes, and $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ at $60$ minutes. The peak cortisol level achieved is $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$. The universally accepted criterion for a \"pass\" or normal response on a high-dose cosyntropin test is a peak serum cortisol of $\\ge 18 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ (or $\\ge 20 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ in some references, depending on the assay). A peak of $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ constitutes a failed test. This result indicates that the patient's adrenal glands cannot produce a sufficient amount of cortisol in response to a maximal stimulus, meaning they have inadequate adrenal reserve to handle significant physiological stress. This confirms the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n5.  **Derivation of Correct Management:**\n    *   **Diagnosis:** Iatrogenic secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n    *   **Therapy:** The patient cannot safely discontinue steroid therapy. The current prednisone taper must be stopped. The patient should be converted to a physiologic replacement regimen, typically with a shorter-acting glucocorticoid like hydrocortisone, dosed to mimic the natural diurnal rhythm (e.g., two-thirds of the dose in the morning, one-third in the late afternoon).\n    *   **Patient Safety:** The patient must be counseled on the absolute necessity of \"stress-dosing\" glucocorticoids during illness, trauma, or surgical procedures to prevent a life-threatening adrenal crisis.\n    *   **Follow-up:** The HPA axis may recover over months to years. The patient should be managed with physiologic replacement doses and re-evaluated periodically (e.g., every $3$-$6$ months) with a morning cortisol or repeat cosyntropin stimulation test to assess for recovery.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Proceed with the standard $250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ cosyntropin test at $08:00$ after holding potentially assay-interfering glucocorticoids, interpret a peak cortisol $18 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ as inadequate adrenal reserve consistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency from HPA suppression, convert to physiologic hydrocortisone replacement (for example, $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ in the morning and $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ in the afternoon), provide stress-dose coverage for intercurrent illness or procedures, taper slowly, and repeat testing in $4$–$6$ weeks to reassess recovery.**\nThis option correctly identifies the appropriate test ($250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ cosyntropin), the correct interpretation of the result (peak $18 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ is inadequate), the correct diagnosis (secondary adrenal insufficiency), and the correct management plan. This includes converting to physiologic replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ AM, $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ PM), ensuring stress-dose coverage, and planning for future reassessment of HPA axis recovery. This entire plan is consistent with standard, safe medical practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Consider the observed increment in cortisol from $3$ to $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ adequate because it exceeds $10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$, continue rapid taper by reducing prednisone by $1$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ every $3$–$5$ days, and omit stress-dose steroids for procedures or illness.**\nThis option makes two critical errors. First, it relies on the cortisol increment ($\\Delta = 17 - 3 = 14 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$) instead of the absolute peak value. The peak value is the crucial determinant of a safe stress response. A peak of $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$ is inadequate. Second, based on this faulty interpretation, it recommends a dangerous management plan: rapid tapering and omission of stress-dose steroids. This would put the patient at high risk of adrenal crisis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Replace the standard $250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ test with a low-dose $1 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ cosyntropin test because central suppression is better detected with smaller doses, maintain current taper without changes until the low-dose test is completed.**\nThis option is flawed because the problem explicitly provides the results of the standard $250 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}$ test and asks for their interpretation. Suggesting a different test ignores the data at hand. While the low-dose test is used in some centers, its superiority is debated, and the high-dose test has already provided a clear, actionable result (adrenal insufficiency).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Order an overnight dexamethasone suppression test to rule out Cushing’s syndrome because the baseline cortisol is low, then expedite cessation of all steroids if suppression is observed.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The dexamethasone suppression test is for diagnosing cortisol *excess* (Cushing's syndrome). This patient has a low baseline cortisol and is at risk for cortisol *deficiency*. The proposed management, rapid cessation of steroids, would be life-threatening.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Recognizing the insulin tolerance test as the gold standard, schedule hypoglycemic provocation testing and withhold all steroid coverage until definitive results are available to avoid confounding the axis.**\nWhile the insulin tolerance test (ITT) is technically the gold standard for testing the entire HPA axis, it is risky and not a first-line test. More importantly, the recommendation to \"withhold all steroid coverage\" in a patient with proven inadequate adrenal reserve (peak cortisol $17 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$) is extremely dangerous and constitutes malpractice. The patient requires steroids for survival.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a patient presenting with a constellation of signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities highly characteristic of an acute adrenal crisis, also known as an Addisonian crisis. This is a life-threatening endocrine emergency resulting from an absolute or relative deficiency of adrenal corticosteroids. The patient's history of possible autoimmune polyglandular syndrome provides a plausible etiology for primary adrenal insufficiency, where the adrenal glands themselves are destroyed. The recent viral illness acts as a physiological stressor that precipitates the crisis by increasing the demand for cortisol beyond the adrenal glands' production capacity.\n\nThe fundamental pathophysiology involves a deficiency of two main classes of adrenal corticosteroids:\n1.  **Glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol):** Cortisol deficiency leads to:\n    *   Hypoglycemia, due to impaired gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral glucose utilization.\n    *   Hypotension and shock, due to decreased vascular tone and reduced responsiveness of arterioles to catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine, epinephrine).\n    *   Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n    *   Potential for hyponatremia through inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention.\n    *   Fever, as corticosteroids have an antipyretic effect and their absence can unmask or exaggerate febrile responses to infection or inflammation.\n2.  **Mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone):** Aldosterone deficiency (characteristic of primary adrenal insufficiency) leads to:\n    *   Hyponatremia, due to an inability of the renal distal tubules to reabsorb sodium.\n    *   Hypovolemia, as water follows sodium loss, leading to dehydration, hypotension, and pre-renal acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine).\n    *   Hyperkalemia, due to impaired renal excretion of potassium.\n    *   Metabolic acidosis, due to impaired renal excretion of hydrogen ions.\n\nThe patient's presentation directly reflects this pathophysiology:\n*   **Shock:** Blood pressure $78/42 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$, heart rate $122 \\, \\mathrm{beats}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n*   **Hypoglycemia:** Glucose $42 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n*   **Hyponatremia:** Sodium $121 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n*   **Hyperkalemia:** Potassium $6.2 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$ with corresponding ECG changes (peaked T waves), which signals a risk of imminent cardiac arrhythmia or arrest.\n*   **Metabolic Acidosis:** Bicarbonate $16 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n*   **Hypovolemia/Pre-renal Azotemia:** Dry mucous membranes, creatinine $1.7 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n*   **Stressor:** Fever $38.6 \\, {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and recent viral illness.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The clinical scenario is a classic representation of adrenal crisis, and all provided data are consistent with this diagnosis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe immediate emergency management must be derived from these life-threatening pathophysiological derangements and should proceed in order of priority:\n1.  **Circulatory Collapse (Shock):** This is the most immediate threat to life. It must be treated with aggressive volume resuscitation and replacement of the deficient glucocorticoids which are essential for vascular stability.\n    *   Correction of hypovolemia requires intravenous fluids. Isotonic saline ($0.9\\% \\, \\mathrm{NaCl}$) is the fluid of choice as it expands the intravascular volume and helps correct the hyponatremia. Aggressive resuscitation, often $1\\text{–}3 \\, \\mathrm{L}$ in the first few hours, is necessary.\n    *   Parenteral glucocorticoids are mandatory and must not be delayed. Intravenous hydrocortisone is the drug of choice because it has both glucocorticoid and, at high doses (e.g., $100 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$), mineralocorticoid activity, addressing both major deficiencies simultaneously.\n2.  **Life-Threatening Metabolic Disturbances:**\n    *   **Hypoglycemia:** Must be corrected immediately to prevent neurological damage. An intravenous bolus of dextrose (e.g., $50 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$ of $50\\%$ dextrose) followed by a continuous infusion of dextrose-containing fluid is standard.\n    *   **Hyperkalemia:** A level of $6.2 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$ with ECG changes is a medical emergency. Treatment must be initiated to stabilize the cardiac membrane (intravenous calcium), shift potassium into cells (intravenous insulin and glucose, beta-agonists), and promote potassium excretion. The administration of fluids and hydrocortisone will also aid in its correction by improving renal perfusion and providing a mineralocorticoid effect.\n3.  **Diagnostic versus Therapeutic Priority:** In a suspected adrenal crisis, treatment is paramount and must precede or occur concurrently with diagnostic confirmation. Delaying therapy to obtain blood samples or perform stimulation tests is a critical error and can be fatal. Baseline blood for cortisol and ACTH should be drawn, but therapy must be started immediately.\n4.  **Identification and Treatment of Precipitant:** Since infection is a common precipitant and the patient is febrile, obtaining blood cultures and initiating empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is a prudent and often necessary step in the management of a critically ill, undifferentiated patient.\n\nBased on this derived algorithm, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**Option A:** `Draw adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels and delay glucocorticoid therapy pending test completion; start hypotonic saline to correct hyponatremia; administer dexamethasone 4 mg intravenously to avoid assay interference; give potassium chloride prophylactically for arrhythmia risk; reassess in 2 hours.`\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n*   Delaying glucocorticoid therapy is life-threatening and violates a fundamental principle of managing adrenal crisis.\n*   Administering hypotonic saline to a patient in hypovolemic shock would worsen the hypotension. Isotonic saline is required.\n*   Giving potassium chloride to a patient with severe hyperkalemia ($6.2 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$) is lethally incorrect and would likely precipitate cardiac arrest.\n\n**Option B:** `Administer immediate intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg as a bolus; begin isotonic saline resuscitation with 1–3 L over the first few hours while titrating to perfusion targets; treat hypoglycemia with an intravenous dextrose bolus and consider a dextrose-containing maintenance infusion; continuously monitor electrolytes (including Na+ and K+), glucose, and hemodynamics; treat hyperkalemia urgently with membrane stabilization and intracellular shift therapies as indicated; obtain blood cultures and start empiric antibiotics if infection is suspected; add vasopressors only if hypotension persists after adequate fluids and glucocorticoids; do not delay therapy for diagnostic testing.`\nThis option is **Correct**.\n*   It correctly prioritizes immediate IV hydrocortisone and aggressive isotonic saline resuscitation.\n*   It appropriately addresses the life-threatening hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia.\n*   It emphasizes the critical principle of not delaying therapy for diagnostic tests.\n*   It includes appropriate monitoring, consideration of precipitating infection, and correct sequencing of vasopressor use (as an adjunct after fluid and steroid administration). This option represents the standard of care.\n\n**Option C:** `Initiate oral fludrocortisone 0.1 mg and restrict fluids to prevent worsening hyponatremia; avoid hydrocortisone to preserve the accuracy of serum cortisol assays; treat hyperkalemia with insulin alone without dextrose to prevent worsening hyponatremia; schedule endocrine consultation once the patient is hemodynamically stable.`\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n*   The patient is obtunded and vomiting; oral medications are inappropriate. Fludrocortisone is for chronic management, not acute crisis.\n*   Fluid restriction in a patient with hypovolemic shock is lethally incorrect.\n*   Avoiding hydrocortisone is a fatal error.\n*   Administering insulin without dextrose to a severely hypoglycemic patient ($42 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{dL}$) would cause profound, life-threatening hypoglycemia.\n\n**Option D:** `Give immediate vasopressors before fluid resuscitation to counteract catecholamine resistance; administer methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously; use hypertonic saline (3%) to rapidly correct hyponatremia; avoid dextrose due to risk of rebound hypoglycemia; defer electrolyte monitoring until 6 hours post-intervention.`\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n*   The primary treatment for hypovolemic shock is volume resuscitation (\"fluids first\"), not vasopressors.\n*   Methylprednisolone lacks the significant mineralocorticoid activity of hydrocortisone, making it a suboptimal choice.\n*   Rapid correction of hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is dangerous and generally not indicated here; the hyponatremia will improve with isotonic saline and hydrocortisone.\n*   Avoiding dextrose in a severely hypoglycemic patient is illogical and dangerous.\n*   Deferring monitoring for $6$ hours is reckless in a critically ill patient with severe electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n**Option E:** `Administer immediate intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus and begin lactated Ringer’s at 250 mL/h only; avoid treating hyperkalemia unless electrocardiogram shows arrhythmia; correct hyponatremia with free water restriction; prioritize completing a high-dose ACTH stimulation test before additional interventions to establish the diagnosis.`\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n*   Lactated Ringer's solution contains potassium ($4 \\, \\mathrm{mEq}/\\mathrm{L}$) and is relatively contraindicated in severe hyperkalemia. Furthermore, a rate of $250 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{h}$ is likely inadequate for reversing shock.\n*   Waiting for an arrhythmia to treat hyperkalemia when precursor ECG changes (peaked T waves) are already present is dangerous. Treatment should begin immediately.\n*   Free water restriction is contraindicated in hypovolemia.\n*   Prioritizing diagnostic testing over immediate, life-saving intervention is a fatal error.\n\nIn conclusion, Option B provides a comprehensive, physiologically sound, and correct algorithm for the immediate management of this patient's adrenal crisis.",
