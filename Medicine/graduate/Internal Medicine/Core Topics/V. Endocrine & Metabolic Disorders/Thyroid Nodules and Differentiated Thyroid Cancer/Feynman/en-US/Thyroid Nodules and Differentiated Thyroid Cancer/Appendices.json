To standardize risk assessment and guide management, the American College of Radiology developed the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS).

            "problem": "A 46-year-old patient undergoes thyroid ultrasonography for evaluation of a palpable left thyroid nodule. On high-resolution grayscale and Doppler imaging, the nodule is measured at a maximal diameter of $1.8 \\text{ cm}$. It is described as solid (greater than $95\\%$ solid components), hypoechoic relative to normal thyroid parenchyma, wider-than-tall on orthogonal planes, with lobulated margins, and demonstrating punctate echogenic foci without posterior acoustic shadowing or artifact consistent with comet-tail.\n\nUsing the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS), compute the risk category and the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) recommendation for this $1.8 \\text{ cm}$ nodule by deriving the total point score from first principles of the TI-RADS feature-based risk stratification framework. Then, state whether FNA is indicated or not at the observed size based on category-specific size thresholds. Report the total TI-RADS point score as your final answer. No rounding is required, and no units are to be included in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS), a standard clinical tool for risk stratification of thyroid nodules. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary ultrasonographic features to compute a definitive score, and is objectively stated.\n\nThe ACR TI-RADS system assigns points to a thyroid nodule based on its features across five distinct categories. The total point score determines the nodule's risk category (TR level), which in turn dictates the size threshold for recommending a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. We will calculate the total score by assessing each feature provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Composition**: The nodule is described as \"solid (greater than $95\\%$ solid components)\". According to the ACR TI-RADS lexicon, a solid or almost completely solid composition is assigned $2$ points.\n    $$\\text{Points for Composition} = 2$$\n\n2.  **Echogenicity**: The nodule is \"hypoechoic relative to normal thyroid parenchyma\". A hypoechoic appearance, defined as having lower echogenicity than the adjacent thyroid tissue, is assigned $2$ points.\n    $$\\text{Points for Echogenicity} = 2$$\n\n3.  **Shape**: The nodule is \"wider-than-tall on orthogonal planes\". A wider-than-tall shape, assessed on a transverse imaging plane, is a non-suspicious feature and is assigned $0$ points.\n    $$\\text{Points for Shape} = 0$$\n\n4.  **Margin**: The nodule has \"lobulated margins\". Lobulated or irregular margins are considered suspicious features. This characteristic is assigned $2$ points.\n    $$\\text{Points for Margin} = 2$$\n\n5.  **Echogenic Foci**: The nodule demonstrates \"punctate echogenic foci\". These are very small, non-shadowing echogenic foci, which are a highly suspicious feature for papillary thyroid carcinoma. This finding is assigned $3$ points. The absence of comet-tail artifacts confirms these are not colloid-related.\n    $$\\text{Points for Echogenic Foci} = 3$$\n\nThe total TI-RADS point score is the summation of the points from each of the five categories.\n$$\\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Composition}) + (\\text{Echogenicity}) + (\\text{Shape}) + (\\text{Margin}) + (\\text{Echogenic Foci})$$\n$$\\text{Total Score} = 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 9$$\n\nWith a total score of $9$ points, the nodule is classified according to the TI-RADS risk categories:\n- TR1 (Benign): $0$ points\n- TR2 (Not Suspicious): $2$ points\n- TR3 (Mildly Suspicious): $3$ points\n- TR4 (Moderately Suspicious): $4$ to $6$ points\n- TR5 (Highly Suspicious): $\\ge 7$ points\n\nA score of $9$ places this nodule in the **TR5 (Highly Suspicious)** category.\n\nNext, we determine the recommendation for FNA based on the nodule's size and its TR5 category. The ACR TI-RADS size thresholds for FNA are:\n- TR3: FNA if $\\ge 2.5$ cm\n- TR4: FNA if $\\ge 1.5$ cm\n- TR5: FNA if $\\ge 1.0$ cm\n\nThe nodule's maximal diameter is given as $1.8$ cm. For a TR5 nodule, the threshold for recommending FNA is a diameter greater than or equal to $1.0$ cm. Since $1.8 \\text{ cm} \\ge 1.0 \\text{ cm}$, fine-needle aspiration is indicated for this nodule.\n\nThe problem asks for the total TI-RADS point score as the final answer. Based on the systematic application of the scoring rubric, the total score is $9$.",

Your academic endocrine clinic uses a validated next-generation sequencing–based molecular classifier as an ancillary test to refine the risk of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (papillary, follicular, and their variants) in AUS/FLUS nodules. Institutional audit data indicate that, among nodules labeled AUS/FLUS, the pretest prevalence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is $P = 0.30$. From independent validation studies, the test’s sensitivity is $Se = 0.92$ and specificity is $Sp = 0.80$.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes’ theorem, derive expressions for the positive predictive value and negative predictive value in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $P$, and then compute their numerical values for this clinical scenario. Express the positive predictive value and negative predictive value as decimal proportions, and round your final numerical answers to four significant figures. No percentage signs are allowed in the final response.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data for a standard application of Bayesian probability theory in medical diagnostics. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result from the molecular classifier, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into conditional probabilities as follows:\nThe pretest prevalence of the disease is $P(D) = P = 0.30$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $P(T^+|D) = Se = 0.92$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $P(T^-|D^c) = Sp = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\nSimilarly, the false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n\nThe positive predictive value ($PPV$) is defined as the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$. We derive its expression using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability by summing the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive ways a positive test can occur: a true positive ($T^+ \\cap D$) and a false positive ($T^+ \\cap D^c$).\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the given symbols ($Se$, $Sp$, $P$):\n$$ P(T^+) = (Se)(P) + (1-Sp)(1-P) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the equation for $PPV$:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{(Se)(P)}{(Se)(P) + (1-Sp)(1-P)} $$\nThis is the generalized expression for the positive predictive value.\n\nThe negative predictive value ($NPV$) is defined as the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. We derive its expression using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability, we sum the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive ways a negative test can occur: a true negative ($T^- \\cap D^c$) and a false negative ($T^- \\cap D$).\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D) $$\nSubstituting the given symbols ($Se$, $Sp$, $P$):\n$$ P(T^-) = (Sp)(1-P) + (1-Se)(P) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the equation for $NPV$:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{(Sp)(1-P)}{(1-Se)(P) + (Sp)(1-P)} $$\nThis is the generalized expression for the negative predictive value.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the given clinical scenario, where $P=0.30$, $Se=0.92$, and $Sp=0.80$.\nFor the positive predictive value:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.92)(0.30)}{(0.92)(0.30) + (1-0.80)(1-0.30)} = \\frac{0.276}{0.276 + (0.20)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.276}{0.276 + 0.140} = \\frac{0.276}{0.416} $$\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.6634615... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.6635$.\n\nFor the negative predictive value:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.80)(1-0.30)}{(1-0.92)(0.30) + (0.80)(1-0.30)} = \\frac{(0.80)(0.70)}{(0.08)(0.30) + (0.80)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.56}{0.024 + 0.56} = \\frac{0.56}{0.584} $$\n$$ NPV \\approx 0.9589041... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9589$.",

While initial dose estimates are useful, fine-tuning the dose to reach a specific TSH target is a nuanced process that can be guided by the patient's individual response. This practice applies a log-linear model to patient-specific data, providing a quantitative method for predicting the precise dose needed to achieve a therapeutic goal, a core skill in the long-term management of these patients .",

            "problem": "A $45$-year-old woman with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) underwent total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation, leaving her athyreotic. She is clinically stable without interfering medications and is monitored in an internal medicine clinic. Because of her intermediate recurrence risk, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target is suppression toward a low range. She is obese (actual body weight $92$ kilograms; height $165$ centimeters). To avoid overdosing in obesity, use ideal body weight rather than actual body weight for weight-based dosing. After several titrations and $6$-week steady-state intervals, the following dose–TSH pairs were recorded: at levothyroxine $112$ micrograms per day, TSH $3.6$ milli-international units per liter; at levothyroxine $137$ micrograms per day, TSH $1.2$ milli-international units per liter. Assume that, over the operating range for this patient, the steady-state relationship between TSH and daily levothyroxine dose is locally log-linear.\n\nUsing a valid, widely accepted weight-based full replacement dosing factor and ideal body weight for an athyreotic adult, first determine the full replacement dose. Then, using the individual dose–response relation implied by the two observed data points and the local log-linear assumption, compute a single daily levothyroxine dose predicted to achieve a steady-state TSH of $0.2$ milli-international units per liter.\n\nExpress the final recommended daily dose in micrograms per day and round your answer to three significant figures.",

The management of a post-thyroidectomy DTC patient with levothyroxine, TSH suppression goals, dose titration, and the application of a log-linear model for the TSH-dose relationship are all consistent with established medical principles and practices. The physiological negative feedback loop between thyroid hormone and TSH results in a relationship where TSH levels change exponentially in response to linear changes in hormone levels, making the log-linear approximation scientifically valid over a limited range. The provided numerical values for doses and TSH are clinically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests two calculations. The first requires knowledge of standard clinical formulas and constants (\"valid, widely accepted\"), which is appropriate for a problem in an applied science context. The second calculation is fully specified by the provision of two data points and a mathematical model (log-linear), which allows for the unique determination of the two model parameters and subsequent prediction. The objective is clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained, assuming the use of standard medical constants as directed. There are no internal contradictions. The data is sufficient to perform the required calculations.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be generated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Theoretical Full Replacement Dose**\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's ideal body weight (IBW). A widely accepted formula for IBW in adult females is the Devine formula. The height is given as $165$ cm. We convert this to inches:\n$$H_{\\text{in}} = 165 \\, \\text{cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{inch}}{2.54 \\, \\text{cm}} \\approx 64.96 \\, \\text{inches}$$\nThe Devine formula for females is:\n$$\\text{IBW (kg)} = 45.5 \\text{ kg} + 2.3 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{inch}} \\times (H_{\\text{in}} - 60)$$\nSubstituting the patient's height in inches:\n$$\\text{IBW} = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times (64.96 - 60) = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times 4.96 = 45.5 + 11.408 \\approx 56.9 \\, \\text{kg}$$\nNext, we use a standard, widely accepted weight-based dosing factor for full thyroid hormone replacement in an athyreotic adult, which is approximately $1.6$ micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. The problem specifies using IBW.\n$$D_{\\text{full}} = \\text{IBW} \\times 1.6 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 56.9 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.6 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\approx 91.04 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}$$\nThis theoretical dose is a standard starting point, but the definitive dose is determined by titration, as addressed in the second part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Personalized Dose Using the Log-Linear Model**\n\nThe problem states that the relationship between the steady-state TSH level, $T$, and the daily levothyroxine dose, $D$, is locally log-linear. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\\ln(T) = mD + c$$\nwhere $m$ and $c$ are constants that define the linear relationship for this specific patient. We have two data points, $(D_1, T_1) = (112, 3.6)$ and $(D_2, T_2) = (137, 1.2)$. We can use these points to determine the slope $m$ of the line in the $(D, \\ln(T))$ plane.\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta(\\ln(T))}{\\Delta D} = \\frac{\\ln(T_2) - \\ln(T_1)}{D_2 - D_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m = \\frac{\\ln(1.2) - \\ln(3.6)}{137 - 112} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.2}{3.6}\\right)}{25} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{25} = -\\frac{\\ln(3)}{25}$$\nNow, we want to find the dose, $D_{target}$, that will result in a target TSH level of $T_{target} = 0.2$ mIU/L. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, using the first data point $(D_1, \\ln(T_1))$ and the target point $(D_{target}, \\ln(T_{target}))$.\n$$\\ln(T_{target}) - \\ln(T_1) = m (D_{target} - D_1)$$\nSolving for $D_{target}$:\n$$D_{target} = D_1 + \\frac{\\ln(T_{target}) - \\ln(T_1)}{m} = D_1 + \\frac{\\ln(T_{target}/T_1)}{m}$$\nNow, we substitute the known values into this equation:\n$$D_{target} = 112 + \\frac{\\ln(0.2 / 3.6)}{-\\frac{\\ln(3)}{25}}$$\nSimplifying the fraction inside the logarithm: $0.2 / 3.6 = 2 / 36 = 1/18$.\n$$D_{target} = 112 + \\frac{\\ln(1/18)}{-\\frac{\\ln(3)}{25}} = 112 + \\frac{-\\ln(18)}{-\\frac{\\ln(3)}{25}} = 112 + \\frac{25 \\ln(18)}{\\ln(3)}$$\nTo simplify the logarithmic term, we can use the property $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$.\n$$\\ln(18) = \\ln(2 \\times 9) = \\ln(2 \\times 3^2) = \\ln(2) + 2\\ln(3)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $D_{target}$:\n$$D_{target} = 112 + 25 \\frac{\\ln(2) + 2\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3)} = 112 + 25 \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)} + 2 \\right)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\nUsing $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.098612$.\n$$D_{target} \\approx 112 + 25 \\left( \\frac{0.693147}{1.098612} + 2 \\right) \\approx 112 + 25 (0.63093 + 2) = 112 + 25(2.63093)$$\n$$D_{target} \\approx 112 + 65.77325 \\approx 177.77325$$\nThe problem requires the final recommended daily dose to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{target} \\approx 178 \\, \\mu\\text{g/day}$$\nThis result is clinically sensible, as a lower TSH target requires a higher dose of levothyroxine, and $178 \\, \\mu\\text{g/day}$ is a plausible dose for this patient.",
