A full solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation derived from first principles.\n\n### Part 1: Mass Delivery Rate in $\\mathrm{g/hr}$\n\nWe are asked to start from the fundamental definitions of concentration and flow rate.\n\nLet $C$ be the concentration of dextrose in the solution. Concentration is defined as mass ($m$) per unit volume ($V$):\n$$C = \\frac{m}{V}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the D10W solution contains $10\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of dextrose per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution. Therefore, the concentration is:\n$$C = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nLet $Q$ be the volumetric flow rate of the infusion.

We will denote this as $\\dot{m}$.\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{m}{t}$$\nThis rate can be derived by multiplying the concentration by the volumetric flow rate:\n$$\\dot{m} = C \\times Q = \\left(\\frac{m}{V}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{V}{t}\\right) = \\frac{m}{t}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) \\times \\left(100\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{hr}}\\right)$$\nThe units of milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$) cancel out, yielding a result in $\\mathrm{g/hr}$:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{10 \\times 100}{100}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{hr}} = 10\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{hr}}$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\\dot{m} = 10.0\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{hr}}$$\n\n### Part 2: Mass Delivery Rate in $\\mathrm{mg/kg/min}$\n\nNext, we must convert this mass delivery rate into a patient-weight-specific rate with units of $\\mathrm{mg/kg/min}$. This requires dimensional analysis.\n\nThe starting rate is $\\dot{m} = 10\\,\\mathrm{g/hr}$. The patient's weight is $W = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight-normalized rate by dividing the mass rate by the patient's weight:\n$$\\text{Weight-normalized rate} = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{W} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{g/hr}}{70\\,\\mathrm{kg}} = \\frac{10}{70}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{hr}}$$\n\nNow, we apply conversion factors to change the units from $\\mathrm{g/(kg \\cdot hr)}$ to $\\mathrm{mg/(kg \\cdot min)}$.

It is well-posed, with a linear first-order ordinary differential equation, a defined forcing function, and a specific initial condition, which guarantees a unique solution. The parameters and their units are physically consistent. The problem is objective and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. Let us define a rate constant $k$ with units of inverse time:\n$$ k = \\frac{PS}{V_{i}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_{p}(t)$ into the governing differential equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{dG_{i}}{dt} = k \\bigl( (G_{0}-rt) - G_{i}(t) \\bigr) $$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form for a linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dG_{i}}{dt} + k G_{i}(t) = k G_{0} - k r t $$\nTo solve this equation, we use the method of an integrating factor, $I(t)$, which is given by:\n$$ I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\,dt\\right) = \\exp(kt) $$\nMultiplying the differential equation by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\exp(kt)\\frac{dG_{i}}{dt} + k \\exp(kt) G_{i}(t) = (k G_{0} - k r t) \\exp(kt) $$\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $G_{i}(t)\\exp(kt)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigl(G_{i}(t) \\exp(kt)\\bigr) = k G_{0} \\exp(kt) - k r t \\exp(kt) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ G_{i}(t) \\exp(kt) = \\int \\bigl(k G_{0} \\exp(kt) - k r t \\exp(kt)\\bigr) \\,dt $$\n$$ G_{i}(t) \\exp(kt) = G_{0} \\exp(kt) - kr \\int t \\exp(kt) \\,dt $$\nThe remaining integral can be solved using integration by parts, $\\int u \\,dv = uv - \\int v \\,du$.

Although the input parameters are provided with only two significant figures, we adhere to the explicit instruction.\n$$ \\Delta t = 6.00\\,\\text{min} $$\nAs requested, we briefly discuss the clinical implications of this lag. The calculated time lag $\\Delta t = 6.00\\,\\text{min}$ is clinically significant. During a rapid decline in plasma glucose, the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures interstitial glucose $G_{i}(t)$, will report a value that is higher than the true, simultaneous plasma glucose $G_{p}(t)$. Specifically, the CGM reading at time $t$ will approximate the plasma glucose from approximately $6$ minutes prior, i.e., $G_{i}(t) \\approx G_{p}(t-\\Delta t)$. Since glucose is falling ($r>0$), this means $G_{i}(t) > G_{p}(t)$. This discrepancy has critical consequences:\n1.  **Delayed Hypoglycemia Detection**: A CGM may fail to issue a low-glucose alert in a timely manner. The patient's plasma glucose could fall into the hypoglycemic range (e.g., below $70\\,\\text{mg/dL}$) several minutes before the interstitial glucose reading crosses that same threshold. This delay postpones corrective actions, such as consuming carbohydrates, increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.\n2.  **Inaccurate Treatment Decisions**: Clinical decisions based solely on the CGM number during rapid changes can be erroneous. For example, a clinician or an automated insulin delivery system, observing a rapidly falling glucose level that is still in the normal range, might not intervene aggressively enough, underestimating the immediacy of the hypoglycemic threat. Conversely, during a rapid glucose rise, the CGM reading will lag behind and be lower than the plasma value, which could lead to inappropriate insulin dosing. Therefore, during periods of high glucose flux, reliance on trend information (e.g., trend arrows on CGM devices) is more important than the absolute number, and confirmation with a fingerstick blood glucose meter is often advisable.",

Consider a $58$-year-old man with type $2$ diabetes mellitus on a basal-bolus regimen: insulin glargine $24$ units nightly and insulin lispro $8$ units before each meal plus a moderate correction scale. He has uremic symptoms and a baseline glycated hemoglobin of $7.2\\%$. He begins hemodialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday afternoons. The dialysate contains glucose at approximately $100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. On his first dialysis session, his pre-dialysis plasma glucose was $138\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, he did not eat during the session, and he experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia with nadir glucose of $64\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ at hour $2$, requiring oral carbohydrate, followed by another low of $68\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ postdialysis. He reports reduced appetite on dialysis days.\n\nTo construct a dosing plan from first principles, use the following foundations:\n\n- Glucose homeostasis can be described as a mass balance where plasma glucose $G$ changes according to\n$$\\frac{dG}{dt} = R_a - R_d - R_{dial} + R_{exo},$$\nwhere $R_a$ is the rate of endogenous (hepatic) and exogenous (dietary) glucose appearance, $R_d$ is the rate of insulin-mediated tissue disposal, $R_{dial}$ is the rate of removal by dialysis when a transmembrane gradient exists, and $R_{exo}$ is exogenous glucose administration (for example, dextrose or snacks). Hypoglycemia risk increases when $\\frac{dG}{dt} < 0$ and $G$ falls below $70\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\n- In end-stage kidney disease, renal insulin clearance $Cl_{\\mathrm{renal}}$ falls, decreasing total insulin clearance $Cl_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and increasing insulin exposure for a given dose $D$ (conceptually, the area under the insulin concentration-time curve scales as $AUC \\propto \\frac{D}{Cl_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$). Hemodialysis enhances insulin sensitivity acutely and can remove plasma glucose by diffusion if dialysate glucose is lower than plasma glucose.\n\n- Long-acting subcutaneous insulin analogs are not significantly dialyzed once absorbed, but their action is potentiated when $Cl_{\\mathrm{renal}}$ is low. Rapid-acting insulin dosed without concurrent carbohydrate increases $R_d$ disproportionately relative to $R_a$.\n\nWhich of the following insulin dosing adjustment plans best minimizes intradialytic and early postdialysis hypoglycemia while preserving overall glycemic control on dialysis days for this patient?\n\nA. Reduce basal insulin glargine dose by approximately $20$ to $25\\%$ on dialysis days; omit or reduce pre-dialysis prandial insulin if the patient will not consume a meal immediately before or during dialysis; prefer glucose-containing dialysate; perform plasma glucose checks every $30$ to $60$ minutes during dialysis and provide $10$ to $15$ grams of oral carbohydrate if glucose trends downward or is $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ without planned carbohydrate intake; use a gentler correction scale (for example, reduce by $50\\%$) for the first $6$ to $8$ hours postdialysis and pair any rapid-acting insulin with a meal after dialysis.\n\nB. Increase basal insulin dose by approximately $30\\%$ on dialysis days because dialysis removes insulin; maintain full pre-dialysis prandial dosing; use dextrose-free dialysate to avoid intradialytic hyperglycemia; check glucose only at the start and end of dialysis and treat lows reactively.\n\nC. Hold basal insulin entirely on dialysis days to avoid hypoglycemia; administer moderate-to-high dose correction-scale rapid-acting insulin every hour during dialysis to counteract stress hyperglycemia; encourage a low-carbohydrate diet; resume full usual dosing immediately postdialysis.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must be established before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Patient Profile**: A $58$-year-old man with type $2$ diabetes mellitus and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).\n- **Dialysis Regimen**: Initiating thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis (HD) on Monday-Wednesday-Friday afternoons.\n- **Pre-existing Insulin Regimen**: Insulin glargine $24$ units nightly (basal); insulin lispro $8$ units before each meal plus a moderate correction scale (bolus).\n- **Clinical Data**: Uremic symptoms, baseline glycated hemoglobin of $7.2\\%$, reduced appetite on dialysis days.\n- **Dialysis Parameters**: Dialysate contains glucose at approximately $100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n- **Events during First HD Session**:\n    - Pre-dialysis plasma glucose: $138\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    - Intake: Did not eat during the session.\n    - Intradialytic event: Symptomatic hypoglycemia with nadir glucose of $64\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ at hour $2$, required oral carbohydrate.\n    - Postdialysis event: Glucose of $68\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n- **Governing Principles**:\n    1.  **Glucose Dynamics Model**: $\\frac{dG}{dt} = R_a - R_d - R_{dial} + R_{exo}$, where $G$ is plasma glucose, $R_a$ is the rate of glucose appearance, $R_d$ is the rate of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, $R_{dial}$ is the rate of dialytic removal, and $R_{exo}$ is exogenous glucose administration.

HD removes plasma glucose if dialysate glucose is lower than plasma glucose.\n    4.  **Insulin Analog Behavior**: Long-acting subcutaneous analogs are not significantly dialyzed but their action is potentiated by low $Cl_{\\mathrm{renal}}$. Rapid-acting insulin without carbohydrate intake increases $R_d$ disproportionately to $R_a$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of endocrinology and nephrology. The pathophysiology of diabetes in ESKD, the pharmacokinetics of insulin with renal failure, the physiological effects of hemodialysis on glucose metabolism, and the clinical scenario described are all standard and scientifically accurate. The provided mathematical model is a simplified but conceptually correct representation of glucose mass balance.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific clinical scenario and a set of principles, and asks for the best management plan among a set of choices. The goal is clearly defined: minimize hypoglycemia while preserving overall glycemic control. The provided information is sufficient to evaluate the options against these goals.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The patient data are quantitative. The principles are stated as formal relationships. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims in the problem setup.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central challenge is to prevent hypoglycemia, which occurs when the rate of glucose removal from the plasma exceeds the rate of appearance, causing plasma glucose $G$ to drop below $70\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The governing equation is $\\frac{dG}{dt} = R_a - R_d - R_{dial} + R_{exo}$. In this patient's case, several factors conspire to make $\\frac{dG}{dt}$ strongly negative on dialysis days.\n\n1.  **Analysis of $R_d$ (Insulin-mediated Disposal)**:\n    - The patient has ESKD, which reduces $Cl_{\\mathrm{renal}}$ and thus $Cl_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ of insulin. According to the principle $AUC \\propto \\frac{D}{Cl_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$, his usual dose of $24$ units of glargine results in higher-than-usual insulin concentrations and prolonged exposure.\n    - HD acutely increases insulin sensitivity.\n    - Both factors significantly increase $R_d$ for a given insulin dose. The action of his basal insulin (glargine) is potentiated.\n\n2.  **Analysis of $R_a$ (Glucose Appearance)**:\n    - The patient reports reduced appetite and did not eat during the first session. This means the dietary component of $R_a$ is significantly reduced.\n\n3.  **Analysis of $R_{dial}$ (Dialytic Removal)**:\n    - The patient's pre-dialysis glucose was $138\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, while the dialysate glucose was $100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This concentration gradient drives glucose removal from the blood into the dialysate, making $R_{dial}$ a positive value (a net loss from the body).\n\n**Summary of the Pathophysiology**: The patient experienced hypoglycemia because of a confluence of factors: increased baseline insulin effect (higher $R_d$ from low $Cl_{\\mathrm{renal}}$), further enhancement of insulin action (higher $R_d$ from HD-induced sensitivity), reduced glucose input (low $R_a$ from anorexia), and direct glucose removal by dialysis (positive $R_{dial}$). The net result was $\\frac{dG}{dt} = (\\text{low } R_a) - (\\text{high } R_d) - (\\text{positive } R_{dial})  0$, leading to a rapid glucose drop.\n\nA logical management plan must address each of these components to restore balance.\n- To counter the high $R_d$, the insulin dose must be reduced. This applies to both basal insulin (which provides the constant background effect) and bolus insulin (which must be tied to food intake).\n- To counter the low $R_a$, carbohydrate intake must be ensured, or insulin must be withheld if no food is consumed.\n- To minimize $R_{dial}$, using a glucose-containing dialysate is essential.\n- Given the dynamic and high-risk nature, frequent monitoring and a plan for proactive intervention (using $R_{exo}$) are required for safety.\n- The risk persists post-dialysis due to lingering insulin sensitivity and the depot effect of subcutaneous insulin, requiring continued caution.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reduce basal insulin glargine dose by approximately $20$ to $25\\%$ on dialysis days; omit or reduce pre-dialysis prandial insulin if the patient will not consume a meal immediately before or during dialysis; prefer glucose-containing dialysate; perform plasma glucose checks every $30$ to $60$ minutes during dialysis and provide $10$ to $15$ grams of oral carbohydrate if glucose trends downward or is $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ without planned carbohydrate intake; use a gentler correction scale (for example, reduce by $50\\%$) for the first $6$ to $8$ hours postdialysis and pair any rapid-acting insulin with a meal after dialysis.**\n\nThis option comprehensively addresses the identified issues:\n- **Reduces basal insulin**: Correctly adjusts for the lower $Cl_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and increased sensitivity, thereby reducing the baseline $R_d$. A $20-25\\%$ reduction is a standard and prudent initial adjustment.\n- **Adjusts prandial insulin**: Correctly links the bolus insulin to food intake, preventing a dangerous spike in $R_d$ when $R_a$ is low.\n- **Prefers glucose-containing dialysate**: Correctly aims to minimize $R_{dial}$.\n- **Frequent monitoring**: A necessary safety measure in this volatile metabolic state.\n- **Proactive carbohydrate administration ($R_{exo}$)**: A safe and effective strategy to pre-emptively counteract a negative $\\frac{dG}{dt}$ before hypoglycemia occurs. A threshold of $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is a reasonable safety margin.\n- **Cautious post-dialysis management**: Correctly acknowledges the persistent hypoglycemia risk after the dialysis session ends.\n\n**Verdict**: This plan is logically derived from the first principles, addresses all facets of the problem, and represents a safe and effective clinical strategy. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Increase basal insulin dose by approximately $30\\%$ on dialysis days because dialysis removes insulin; maintain full pre-dialysis prandial dosing; use dextrose-free dialysate to avoid intradialytic hyperglycemia; check glucose only at the start and end of dialysis and treat lows reactively.**\n\nThis option is flawed in every aspect:\n- **Increase basal insulin**: This is based on a false premise. The problem states long-acting analogs are *not* significantly dialyzed. The dominant effect is reduced clearance, which *increases* insulin levels. Increasing the dose would be catastrophic.\n- **Maintain prandial dosing**: This ignores the patient's reduced appetite and would cause severe hypoglycemia if a meal is missed.\n- **Use dextrose-free dialysate**: This would maximize $R_{dial}$, dramatically worsening the hypoglycemia risk. The patient's problem is hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.\n- **Infrequent monitoring**: This approach is reactive and unsafe.\n\n**Verdict**: This plan directly contradicts the provided principles and clinical data and would place the patient at extreme risk of severe hypoglycemia. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hold basal insulin entirely on dialysis days to avoid hypoglycemia; administer moderate-to-high dose correction-scale rapid-acting insulin every hour during dialysis to counteract stress hyperglycemia; encourage a low-carbohydrate diet; resume full usual dosing immediately postdialysis.**\n\nThis option proposes extreme and risky measures:\n- **Hold basal insulin**: While reducing the dose is necessary, holding it entirely risks significant hyperglycemia later, compromising the goal of preserving overall glycemic control. The patient's baseline HbA1c of $7.2\\%$ indicates a need for continuous basal insulin.\n- **Frequent rapid-acting insulin**: Administering frequent correction doses during a state of enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose removal is a recipe for iatrogenic hypoglycemia. It creates large, unpredictable fluctuations in $R_d$.\n- **Low-carbohydrate diet**: This is contraindicated. The patient needs carbohydrates to maintain glucose levels, especially with poor appetite.\n- **Resume full dosing postdialysis**: This ignores the lingering post-dialysis hypoglycemia risk.\n\n**Verdict**: This plan is poorly conceived, replacing one risk (hypoglycemia from basal insulin) with others (hyperglycemia from no basal, severe hypoglycemia from frequent corrections). **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Convert to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin twice daily and administer an extra dose at the start of each dialysis session; keep prandial insulin unchanged; target tight intradialytic glucose of $70$ to $110\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and discourage snacks to avoid hyperglycemia.**\n\nThis option introduces an older, less predictable insulin and a dangerous dosing strategy:\n- **Convert to NPH and add extra dose**: NPH insulin has a pronounced peak, which is more likely to cause hypoglycemia than the flatter profile of glargine, especially in ESKD. Adding an extra dose at the start of dialysis would cause peak insulin action to coincide with the period of maximal hypoglycemia risk.\n- **Keep prandial insulin unchanged**: This is incorrect for the same reason as in option B; insulin must match intake.\n- **Tight target of $70-110\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$**: This target is too narrow and risky during HD. It provides no buffer against hypoglycemia in a dynamic environment. A higher, safer target is preferred.\n- **Discourage snacks**: This removes a critical tool for preventing hypoglycemia.\n\n**Verdict**: This plan would increase the risk of hypoglycemia through a less predictable insulin, dangerous timing of doses, an unsafe glycemic target, and by forbidding a key safety behavior. **Incorrect**.",
