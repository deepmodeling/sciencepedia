This practice problem  challenges you to confront a common yet critical pre-analytical error where a patient's platelet count appears dangerously low due to a laboratory artifact.

            "problem": "A patient aged $72$ years is evaluated before a planned lumbar puncture for suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The patient has no spontaneous bleeding, no ecchymoses, and a normal neurological examination. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) drawn into a tube containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) reports a platelet count of $9 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$, with analyzer flags indicating “platelet clumps.” The white blood cell count and hemoglobin are within the reference interval, and prior CBCs in the past $3$ months showed platelet counts between $180$ and $220 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$. A peripheral blood smear is requested but has not yet been reviewed. Thromboelastography (TEG) performed for a separate clinical question shows parameters within institutional reference ranges. The inpatient team is considering transfusing platelets to raise the platelet count above a commonly used procedural threshold.\n\nUsing foundational principles of blood component therapy, including the indication to transfuse platelets only to treat or prevent bleeding due to true thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction; the requirement that treatment decisions rely on accurate measurements; and the recognition that preanalytical factors can artifactually alter cell counts, which of the following strategies best prevents inappropriate platelet transfusion in the setting of suspected EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia and appropriately confirms the true platelet count?\n\nA. Transfuse $1$ apheresis platelet unit immediately to reach a target of at least $50 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$ for lumbar puncture, because the analyzer reports $9 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$.\n\nB. Repeat the platelet count in a sodium citrate anticoagulated tube, request immediate manual peripheral smear review to assess for clumping or satellitism, interpret the result with appropriate dilution correction for the citrate tube, and defer platelet transfusion if the corrected platelet count is adequate for the planned procedure.\n\nC. Add calcium chloride to the original EDTA specimen to reverse chelation and eliminate clumping, then use the original automated count as the basis for transfusion decisions.\n\nD. Rely on Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) and the Immature Platelet Fraction (IPF) indices from the EDTA sample to infer adequate thrombopoiesis and proceed with platelet transfusion to mitigate any residual risk.\n\nE. Repeat the platelet count in a lithium heparin tube and, if the value remains below $50 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$, proceed with platelet transfusion without manual smear correlation to avoid delays before the lumbar puncture.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem is the significant discrepancy between an automated laboratory value and the patient's clinical presentation. The patient has an automated platelet count of $9 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$, which indicates severe thrombocytopenia. However, the patient is clinically well, with no signs of bleeding, and has a recent history of normal platelet counts ($180-220 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$). The crucial clues are the analyzer flag indicating \"platelet clumps\" and the normal Thromboelastography (TEG) result.\n\nThese findings are pathognomonic for pseudothrombocytopenia, a preanalytical laboratory artifact. Most commonly, this is Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia, where antibodies in the patient's plasma cause platelets to agglutinate in the presence of the EDTA anticoagulant. Automated hematology analyzers cannot distinguish these large clumps and thus report a spuriously low platelet count. The fundamental principle is to \"treat the patient, not the number.\" An intervention like platelet transfusion should not be based on a suspected artifact. The primary goal must be to ascertain the *true* platelet count.\n\nA. Transfuse $1$ apheresis platelet unit immediately. This option is incorrect as it acts on a likely spurious lab value, ignoring all contradictory clinical and laboratory evidence. This would be an unnecessary and potentially harmful transfusion.\n\nB. Repeat the platelet count in a sodium citrate anticoagulated tube, request immediate manual peripheral smear review... This strategy is scientifically and logically sound. It directly addresses the suspected artifact by using an alternative anticoagulant (sodium citrate). It includes the mathematically necessary dilution correction for the citrate tube. It also incorporates the gold-standard confirmatory step of manual smear review to visually confirm the presence or absence of clumps. This is the standard of care for resolving suspected pseudothrombocytopenia.\n\nC. Add calcium chloride to the original EDTA specimen... This is incorrect. While adding $Ca^{2+}$ can reverse EDTA's anticoagulant effect, it is not a validated method for disaggregating the antibody-mediated platelet clumps seen in pseudothrombocytopenia.\n\nD. Rely on Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) and the Immature Platelet Fraction (IPF)... This is incorrect. When platelet clumping occurs, all platelet-related parameters derived by the automated analyzer, including MPV and IPF, become unreliable. Using these invalid secondary parameters to justify a transfusion is illogical.\n\nE. Repeat the platelet count in a lithium heparin tube... without manual smear correlation. Using a lithium heparin tube is a valid first step. However, this option critically omits the manual smear review, which is essential to visually confirm the absence of clumping in the new specimen and to verify the platelet count. Skipping this step is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the only complete and correct strategy is B.",

To mitigate transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), you will use a strategy that maintains an hourly non-positive net intravascular fluid balance during transfusion and administer a single preemptive dose of intravenous furosemide prior to starting each unit.
