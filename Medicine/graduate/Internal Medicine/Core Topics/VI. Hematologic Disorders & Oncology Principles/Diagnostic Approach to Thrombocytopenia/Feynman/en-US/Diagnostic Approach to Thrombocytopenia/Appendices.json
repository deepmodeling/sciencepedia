            "introduction": "The diagnostic journey for thrombocytopenia begins with a fundamental step: verifying the accuracy of the platelet count. A common pre-analytical pitfall is pseudothrombocytopenia, where in vitro platelet clumping leads to a falsely low automated reading. This practice  challenges you to move beyond rote memorization of standard correction factors by deriving a dilution correction from first principles for an underfilled citrate tube—a frequent real-world scenario. Mastering this calculation ensures you can confidently interpret platelet counts even when faced with imperfect samples, a critical skill for any clinician.",

            "problem": "A $62$-year-old patient with suspected Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia undergoes repeat platelet counting using a sodium citrate tube to avoid in vitro clumping. The sodium citrate tube contains a fixed anticoagulant volume $V_{c} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ (standard $3.2\\%$ sodium citrate, $0.109\\,\\mathrm{M}$), and on this draw the tube is underfilled with blood to $V_{b} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The hematology analyzer reports the platelet concentration of the diluted blood–citrate mixture based on the sampled mixture volume. The measured platelet count from this citrate tube is $68 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that concentration is the number of particles per unit volume and that the number of platelets in the sample is conserved by dilution (that is, the anticoagulant adds volume without changing the number of platelets), derive the dilution correction factor from first principles and apply it to compute the whole-blood equivalent platelet count that should be used in the diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia. Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express it in the unit $10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of solution dilution, clinically relevant to the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia, and provides a self-contained, well-posed set of conditions for a unique solution.\n\nThe goal is to determine the true platelet concentration in a patient's whole blood, $C_{\\text{true}}$, given the measured concentration in a sample diluted with anticoagulant, $C_{\\text{measured}}$. We begin from the fundamental definition of concentration ($C$) as the number of particles ($N$) per unit volume ($V$):\n$$C = \\frac{N}{V}$$\nFrom this, the total number of platelets, $N_{\\text{plt}}$, in the initial whole blood sample of volume $V_{b}$ is:\n$$N_{\\text{plt}} = C_{\\text{true}} \\cdot V_{b}$$\nThe problem states that the blood sample is drawn into a tube containing a volume $V_{c}$ of sodium citrate anticoagulant. The problem provides the following values:\n- Volume of blood, $V_{b} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Volume of citrate anticoagulant, $V_{c} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n\nA core principle provided is that the number of platelets is conserved upon dilution. The anticoagulant adds volume but does not change the total number of platelets in the tube. The total volume of the mixture in the tube, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the blood and anticoagulant volumes:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = V_{b} + V_{c}$$\nThe hematology analyzer measures the platelet concentration of this diluted mixture, reported as $C_{\\text{measured}} = 68 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$. The total number of platelets in this diluted volume is:\n$$N_{\\text{plt}} = C_{\\text{measured}} \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\nBy the principle of conservation of platelets, we can equate the two expressions for $N_{\\text{plt}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} \\cdot V_{b} = C_{\\text{measured}} \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{total}}$ gives:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} \\cdot V_{b} = C_{\\text{measured}} \\cdot (V_{b} + V_{c})$$\nTo find the true, undiluted blood platelet concentration, we solve for $C_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = C_{\\text{measured}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{b} + V_{c}}{V_{b}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{V_{b} + V_{c}}{V_{b}}$ is the dilution correction factor, $F_{\\text{dilution}}$, which must be applied to the measured concentration. The problem requires deriving this factor from first principles, which we have done. We can also express it as:\n$$F_{\\text{dilution}} = 1 + \\frac{V_{c}}{V_{b}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to calculate the correction factor:\n$$F_{\\text{dilution}} = \\frac{4.0\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{4.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{4.5}{4.0} = 1.125$$\nThis factor is dimensionless. Finally, we calculate the whole-blood equivalent platelet count, $C_{\\text{true}}$, by multiplying the measured count by this factor:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = C_{\\text{measured}} \\cdot F_{\\text{dilution}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = (68 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}) \\cdot 1.125$$\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = 76.5 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $76.5$ already contains three significant figures. Expressed in the required units, the numerical value is $76.5$. This corrected value should be used in the diagnostic assessment of the patient's thrombocytopenia.",
