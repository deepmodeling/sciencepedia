            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The misalignment angle between the head angular velocity vector and the semicircular canal's unit normal axis is $\\theta = 10$ degrees.\n- The instantaneous stimulus is proportional to the component of the head's angular motion along the canal's sensitive axis.\n- This component is modeled as the scalar projection of the angular motion vector onto the canal's unit axis.\n- The fractional reduction in effective canal stimulus is defined as $R \\equiv 1 - \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{S_{\\mathrm{aligned}}}$.\n- $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective stimulus with misalignment.\n- $S_{\\mathrm{aligned}}$ is the stimulus under perfect alignment.\n- The final numerical answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The function of semicircular canals as biological angular gyroscopes whose response depends on the orientation of the rotation axis is a fundamental concept in vestibular physiology. Modeling this orientation-dependence using the scalar projection of the angular velocity vector is a standard and physically correct simplification. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The terminology is objective and precise. The values are physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $\\vec{\\omega}$ be the head's angular velocity vector, and let $\\omega = \\|\\vec{\\omega}\\|$ be its magnitude. Let $\\hat{n}$ be the unit vector representing the sensitive axis of the semicircular canal, which is normal to the plane of the canal. By definition, $\\|\\hat{n}\\| = 1$. The problem states that the stimulus, which we denote as $S$, is proportional to the scalar projection of $\\vec{\\omega}$ onto the axis defined by $\\hat{n}$. The scalar projection of $\\vec{\\omega}$ onto $\\hat{n}$ is given by $\\vec{\\omega} \\cdot \\hat{n}$.\n\nWe can express the stimulus as:\n$$S = k (\\vec{\\omega} \\cdot \\hat{n})$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nUsing the definition of the dot product, we have:\n$$\\vec{\\omega} \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\|\\vec{\\omega}\\| \\|\\hat{n}\\| \\cos(\\phi) = \\omega (1) \\cos(\\phi) = \\omega \\cos(\\phi)$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the angle between the angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$ and the canal's normal axis vector $\\hat{n}$.\nTherefore, the stimulus is given by:\n$$S = k \\omega \\cos(\\phi)$$\n\nWe now consider the two specific cases defined in the problem.\n\nCase 1: Perfect Alignment ($S_{\\mathrm{aligned}}$)\nUnder perfect alignment, the head's angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$ is collinear with the canal's normal axis $\\hat{n}$. In this orientation, the stimulus is maximized. The angle $\\phi$ between the vectors is $0$ degrees.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{aligned}} = k \\omega \\cos(0^\\circ) = k \\omega (1) = k \\omega$$\n\nCase 2: Misalignment ($S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$)\nIn the case of misalignment, the angle between the angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$ and the canal's normal axis $\\hat{n}$ is given as $\\theta = 10^\\circ$. So, we set $\\phi = \\theta$. The effective stimulus is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k \\omega \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the fractional reduction, $R$:\n$$R \\equiv 1 - \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{S_{\\mathrm{aligned}}}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{aligned}}$:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{k \\omega \\cos(\\theta)}{k \\omega}$$\nThe terms $k$ and $\\omega$ cancel, demonstrating that the fractional reduction is independent of the magnitude of the angular velocity and the specific biophysical properties encapsulated by $k$.\n$$R = 1 - \\cos(\\theta)$$\nThis is the general expression for the fractional reduction derived from first principles.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for the given angle $\\theta = 10^\\circ$.\n$$R = 1 - \\cos(10^\\circ)$$\nUsing a calculator set to evaluate trigonometric functions in degrees:\n$$\\cos(10^\\circ) \\approx 0.984807753$$\n$$R \\approx 1 - 0.984807753 = 0.015192247$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is $1$ in the hundredths place. The four significant figures are $1$, $5$, $1$, and $9$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant digit).\n$$R \\approx 0.01519$$",

State whether visual acuity would be preserved in this instant for the stationary target, based on the $4^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ tolerance.\n\nReport the magnitude of the retinal slip. Round your numerical answer to two significant figures and express it in degrees per second. The final answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of rotational kinematics and the physiology of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for retinal slip, compute its value, and assess its impact on visual acuity based on the provided data and principles.\n\nLet $V_h$ denote the angular velocity of the head in space (the inertial laboratory frame) and $V_e$ denote the angular velocity of the eye relative to the head (the eye-in-head frame). Let $V_s$ denote the angular velocity of the eye in space, which corresponds to the rate of change of the direction of gaze. According to the problem's sign convention, rightward rotation is positive.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Head angular velocity: $V_h = +120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$\n- Eye-in-head angular velocity: $V_e = -90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe first fundamental basis provided is the principle of superposition of angular velocities. This principle states that the angular velocity of the eye in space is the sum of the angular velocity of the head in space and the angular velocity of the eye relative to the head. This can be expressed as:\n$$V_s = V_h + V_e$$\n\nThe second fundamental basis defines retinal slip for a stationary visual target. Retinal slip, denoted by $R_s$, is the instantaneous angular velocity of the line of sight relative to the target. Since the target is stationary, its angular velocity in space is $0$. The line of sight's angular velocity in space is $V_s$. Therefore, the retinal slip is:\n$$R_s = V_s - 0 = V_s$$\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we derive the expression for the instantaneous retinal slip in terms of the given variables, $V_h$ and $V_e$:\n$$R_s = V_h + V_e$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the retinal slip using the provided data. We substitute $V_h = 120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ and $V_e = -90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ into the derived expression:\n$$R_s = (120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}) + (-90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}) = 120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s} - 90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s} = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe retinal slip has a value of $30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$. The positive sign indicates that the line of sight is moving to the right in space, failing to fully compensate for the rightward head rotation.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the retinal slip. The magnitude is the absolute value of $R_s$:\n$$|R_s| = |30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}| = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires this numerical answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $30$, which is already expressed with two significant figures.\n\nFinally, we must determine if visual acuity would be preserved. The third fundamental basis provided is the perceptual fact that high foveal visual acuity is preserved when the magnitude of retinal slip is less than approximately $4^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$. We compare our calculated magnitude to this threshold:\n$$|R_s| = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nSince $30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ is significantly greater than the $4^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ tolerance, we conclude that visual acuity for the stationary target would be degraded at this instant. This is indicative of a deficient VOR, as the compensatory eye movement is insufficient to stabilize the gaze on the target. For perfect stabilization, the eye-in-head velocity would need to be $V_e = -V_h = -120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$, which would result in a retinal slip of $R_s = 0^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$.",

            "problem": "In horizontal semicircular canal assessment using video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and Rotary Chair Testing (RCT), the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain is defined as $G=\\left|\\omega_{\\text{eye}}\\right|/\\left|\\omega_{\\text{head}}\\right|$, where $\\omega_{\\text{eye}}$ is the eye angular velocity and $\\omega_{\\text{head}}$ is the head angular velocity, both measured during the same time interval. Consider measured high-frequency horizontal canal gains from vHIT for leftward impulses and rightward impulses denoted $G_{L}$ and $G_{R}$, respectively. You are tasked with constructing a dimensionless lateral asymmetry index $AI=F(G_{L},G_{R})$ that satisfies all of the following properties rooted in the basic definitions and measurement constraints:\n\n- $AI$ is sign-sensitive to lateral imbalance: if $G_{L}>G_{R}$ then $AI>0$, and if $G_{L}<G_{R}$ then $AI<0$.\n- $AI$ is bounded within $(-1,1)$ for all finite positive $G_{L}$ and $G_{R}$.\n- $AI$ is invariant to uniform multiplicative scaling of gains, i.e., for any $k>0$, $F(kG_{L},kG_{R})=F(G_{L},G_{R})$, reflecting robustness to calibration factors and uniform global suppression or enhancement of VOR across both directions.\n- $AI=0$ when $G_{L}=G_{R}$.\n\nStarting from these requirements and the fundamental definition of $G$ above, derive an explicit analytic expression for $AI$ in closed form using only $G_{L}$ and $G_{R}$, and then evaluate it for measured gains $G_{L}=0.92$ and $G_{R}=0.55$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain: $G = |\\omega_{\\text{eye}}| / |\\omega_{\\text{head}}|$.\n- Leftward impulse gain: $G_{L}$.\n- Rightward impulse gain: $G_{R}$.\n- Asymmetry index: a function $AI = F(G_{L}, G_{R})$.\n- The function $F$ must satisfy four properties:\n    1.

Evaluate $AI$ for $G_{L} = 0.92$ and $G_{R} = 0.55$, rounded to four significant figures.\n3. Provide a clinical interpretation of the result.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The concept of VOR gain and asymmetry index is standard in otoneurology. The constraints are mathematically consistent and sufficient to derive a unique and meaningful functional form. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for a patient with unilateral vestibular hypofunction. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the asymmetry index $AI = F(G_L, G_R)$ begins with the property of scale-invariance: $F(kG_{L}, kG_{R}) = F(G_{L}, G_{R})$ for any $k > 0$. This property implies that the function $F$ must depend only on the ratio of its arguments. Let's choose the ratio $x = G_{L}/G_{R}$. Thus, $AI$ can be expressed as a function of this ratio alone, i.e., $AI = f(G_{L}/G_{R})$.\n\nWe now apply the other properties to determine the form of $f(x)$:\n1.  Symmetry: $G_{L} = G_{R}$ implies $x = 1$. The condition $AI=0$ at this point means $f(1) = 0$.\n2.  Sign-sensitivity:\n    - If $G_{L} > G_{R}$, then $x > 1$, and we require $AI > 0$. Thus, $f(x) > 0$ for $x > 1$.\n    - If $G_{L} < G_{R}$, then $0 < x < 1$ (since gains are positive), and we require $AI < 0$. Thus, $f(x) < 0$ for $0 < x < 1$.\n3.  Boundedness: The range of $f(x)$ for $x \\in (0, \\infty)$ must be the interval $(-1, 1)$. This implies that the function must have horizontal asymptotes at $AI = 1$ as $x \\to \\infty$ and at $AI = -1$ as $x \\to 0^{+}$.\n\nA simple functional form that satisfies these properties can be constructed using the most basic algebraic operations that are scale-invariant. Consider the difference $G_L - G_R$ and the sum $G_L + G_R$. Forming their ratio gives a dimensionless, scale-invariant quantity. Let us propose the candidate function:\n$$AI = \\frac{G_{L} - G_{R}}{G_{L} + G_{R}}$$\nWe verify that this expression satisfies all four required properties:\n1.  Sign-sensitivity: Since $G_L, G_R > 0$, the denominator $G_L + G_R$ is always positive. The sign of $AI$ is therefore determined by the sign of the numerator, $G_L - G_R$. If $G_L > G_R$, $AI > 0$. If $G_L < G_R$, $AI < 0$. This condition is met.\n2.  Boundedness: Let's rewrite $AI$ in terms of the ratio $x = G_L/G_R$:\n    $$AI = \\frac{G_R(G_L/G_R - 1)}{G_R(G_L/G_R + 1)} = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1}$$\n    As $G_L \\to \\infty$ for a fixed $G_R$ (or $G_R \\to 0$ for a fixed $G_L$), $x \\to \\infty$, and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{x-1}{x+1} = 1$.\n    As $G_L \\to 0$ for a fixed $G_R$ (or $G_R \\to \\infty$ for a fixed $G_L$), $x \\to 0^{+}$, and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}} \\frac{x-1}{x+1} = -1$.\n    Since the function $f(x) = \\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ is continuous and monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, its range over $x \\in (0, \\infty)$ is $(-1, 1)$. This condition is met.\n3.  Scale-invariance: For any $k > 0$:\n    $$F(kG_{L}, kG_{R}) = \\frac{kG_{L} - kG_{R}}{kG_{L} + kG_{R}} = \\frac{k(G_{L} - G_{R})}{k(G_{L} + G_{R})} = \\frac{G_{L} - G_{R}}{G_{L} + G_{R}} = F(G_{L}, G_{R})$$\n    This condition is met.\n4.  Symmetry: If $G_L = G_R$, then:\n    $$AI = \\frac{G_L - G_L}{G_L + G_L} = \\frac{0}{2G_L} = 0$$\n    (since $G_L > 0$). This condition is met.\n\nThe derived expression for the asymmetry index is $AI = \\frac{G_{L} - G_{R}}{G_{L} + G_{R}}$. This form is commonly known as the Jongkees' formula in the context of caloric testing, adapted here for vHIT gains.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the measured gains $G_{L} = 0.92$ and $G_{R} = 0.55$.\n$$AI = \\frac{0.92 - 0.55}{0.92 + 0.55} = \\frac{0.37}{1.47}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$AI \\approx 0.25170068...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $AI = 0.2517$.\n\nFinally, we provide the clinical interpretation.\nIn horizontal vHIT, a head impulse to the left primarily assesses the function of the left horizontal semicircular canal, and an impulse to the right assesses the right horizontal semicircular canal. Thus, $G_L$ is the gain of the left canal's VOR, and $G_R$ is the gain of the right canal's VOR. A normal gain is close to $1.0$.\n\nThe calculated $AI$ is positive ($AI \\approx +0.2517$), which, by the definition we derived, signifies that $G_{L} > G_{R}$. The measured values confirm this ($0.92 > 0.55$). The left-sided gain, $G_L = 0.92$, is near the normal range, whereas the right-sided gain, $G_R = 0.55$, is substantially reduced. This pattern indicates a deficit in the function of the right horizontal semicircular canal.\n\nTherefore, the clinical interpretation is as follows: The positive sign of the asymmetry index indicates a relative hypofunction of the vestibulo-ocular reflex for head movements toward the right side. The magnitude of the index, $0.2517$ (or $25.17\\%$), quantifies this asymmetry. This is a significant imbalance, well above typical clinical thresholds for abnormality, and is strongly indicative of a unilateral vestibular hypofunction affecting the right horizontal semicircular canal at the high frequencies of motion tested by vHIT.",
