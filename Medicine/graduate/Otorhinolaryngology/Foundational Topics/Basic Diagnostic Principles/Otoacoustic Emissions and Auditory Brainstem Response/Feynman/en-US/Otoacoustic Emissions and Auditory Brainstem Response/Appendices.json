This exercise explores the mathematical foundation of signal averaging, the primary technique used to extract these minute signals. By deriving the relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) and the number of averages ($N$), you will gain a fundamental appreciation for why this technique is indispensable in clinical electrophysiology and how it directly impacts the quality and reliability of your recordings .",

            "problem": "In an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) recording intended to detect wave V, assume each single-trial epoch contains a time-locked signal of amplitude $A_{s}$ superimposed on additive noise that is zero-mean, wide-sense stationary, and independent across trials, with noise variance $\\sigma^{2}$. The recording system computes the simple (unweighted) arithmetic mean of $N$ identically distributed trials. The signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) is defined as $SNR = \\frac{A_{s}}{\\sigma}$, where $\\sigma$ is the noise standard deviation for a single trial. \n\nStarting only from the definition of $SNR$ and the statistical properties of the sample mean under independent, identically distributed noise, derive the relationship between the $SNR$ of the averaged waveform and $N$. Then, given a single-trial $SNR$ of $0.2$ and a wave V detection criterion requiring an averaged $SNR$ of $3$, determine the minimal integer number of averages $N$ needed to meet the detection criterion. Express your final answer as an exact integer without units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) of an averaged waveform and the number of trials, $N$, and then to calculate the minimum number of trials needed to achieve a specific $SNR$.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the model described. For each single trial $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$, the recorded waveform at the time of interest for wave V, denoted as $x_i$, is a superposition of a time-locked, deterministic signal component $s$ and an additive, random noise component $n_i$.\n$$x_i = s + n_i$$\nThe signal amplitude is given as $A_s$, which we can associate with the value of $s$. The noise $n_i$ is a random variable with the following properties:\n1.  Zero-mean: $E[n_i] = 0$.\n2.  Constant variance: $Var(n_i) = E[n_i^2] - (E[n_i])^2 = E[n_i^2] = \\sigma^2$. The standard deviation is $\\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sigma$.\n3.  Independence across trials: $E[n_i n_j] = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe single-trial signal-to-noise ratio, which we will denote as $SNR_{\\text{single}}$, is defined as the ratio of the signal amplitude to the noise standard deviation.\n$$SNR_{\\text{single}} = \\frac{A_s}{\\sigma}$$\n\nThe system computes the arithmetic mean of $N$ such trials. Let $\\bar{x}$ be the resulting averaged waveform value.\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (s + n_i)$$\nWe can separate the signal and noise components in the averaged waveform:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s + \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i$$\nSince the signal $s$ is deterministic and constant across all $N$ trials:\n$$\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s = \\frac{1}{N} (N \\cdot s) = s$$\nThe noise component of the averaged waveform is $\\bar{n} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i$.\nTherefore, the averaged waveform is $\\bar{x} = s + \\bar{n}$.\n\nTo find the $SNR$ of the averaged waveform, $SNR_{\\text{avg}}$, we need to determine its signal amplitude and its noise standard deviation.\nThe signal component of the averaged waveform is $s$, so its amplitude, $A_{s, \\text{avg}}$, is simply the original signal amplitude, $A_s$.\n$$A_{s, \\text{avg}} = A_s$$\n\nNext, we must find the standard deviation of the averaged noise, $\\bar{n}$. First, we calculate its mean and variance.\nThe mean of the averaged noise is:\n$$E[\\bar{n}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[n_i] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 0 = 0$$\nThe variance of the averaged noise, $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}^2$, is:\n$$Var(\\bar{n}) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right)$$\nUsing the property $Var(cZ) = c^2 Var(Z)$ for a constant $c$ and random variable $Z$, we get:\n$$Var(\\bar{n}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2} Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right)$$\nSince the noise in each trial, $n_i$, is independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Var(n_i)$$\nAs the noise is also identically distributed, $Var(n_i) = \\sigma^2$ for all $i$.\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Var(n_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma^2 = N \\sigma^2$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Var(\\bar{n})$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}^2 = Var(\\bar{n}) = \\frac{1}{N^2} (N \\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N}$$\nThe standard deviation of the averaged noise, $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}$, is the square root of its variance:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{N}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\nNow we can express the $SNR$ of the averaged waveform, $SNR_{\\text{avg}}$, as the ratio of its signal amplitude to its noise standard deviation:\n$$SNR_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{A_{s, \\text{avg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}} = \\frac{A_s}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{N}}$$\nBy rearranging this expression, we can see its relationship with the single-trial $SNR$:\n$$SNR_{\\text{avg}} = \\left(\\frac{A_s}{\\sigma}\\right) \\sqrt{N}$$\nSubstituting the definition $SNR_{\\text{single}} = \\frac{A_s}{\\sigma}$, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$SNR_{\\text{avg}} = SNR_{\\text{single}} \\sqrt{N}$$\nThis result demonstrates that the signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged waveform improves proportionally to the square root of the number of trials, $N$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we are given the following values:\n-   Single-trial $SNR$: $SNR_{\\text{single}} = 0.2$\n-   Detection criterion (required averaged $SNR$): $SNR_{\\text{avg}} \\ge 3$\n\nWe need to find the minimal integer $N$ that satisfies this condition. We substitute the given values into our derived formula:\n$$0.2 \\sqrt{N} \\ge 3$$\nTo solve for $N$, we first isolate the term with $\\sqrt{N}$:\n$$\\sqrt{N} \\ge \\frac{3}{0.2}$$\n$$\\sqrt{N} \\ge 15$$\nTo find $N$, we square both sides of the inequality:\n$$(\\sqrt{N})^2 \\ge 15^2$$\n$$N \\ge 225$$\nSince $N$ must be an integer, the minimal number of averages required to meet the detection criterion is $225$.",

            "problem": "A patient with normal cochlear function was previously characterized using both Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) and the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR). Transient-evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) were robust, and ABR wave V absolute latency was measured for rarefaction clicks delivered at two reference earphone levels: at $L_{1}=85\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ nHL}$ the wave V latency was $t_{1}=5.60\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and at $L_{2}=55\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ nHL}$ the wave V latency was $t_{2}=6.20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

Express the final latency shift in milliseconds, and indicate the magnitude of the shift. Round your answer to $3$ significant figures. Express your final answer in milliseconds (ms).",
            "solution": "The problem states that the ABR wave V latency, $t$, is an approximately linear function of the effective cochlear stimulus level, $L$.
