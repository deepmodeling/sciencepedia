            "problem": "An adult presents with a primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the auricle (external ear) measuring $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension. Histopathology demonstrates poor differentiation. There is no clinical or radiologic evidence of perineural invasion of a named nerve, no bone erosion, and no deep invasion beyond subcutaneous fat. Use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Eighth Edition staging system for cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck. The AJCC Eighth Edition considers the following high-risk features: location on the ear or non–hair-bearing lip, poor differentiation, perineural invasion, and deep invasion beyond subcutaneous fat (or thickness $>6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).

It is not ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Determination of the T-Category\n\nThe primary tumor ($T$) category for cSCC of the head and neck in the AJCC 8th Edition is determined by tumor size and specific invasion characteristics. The definitions are as follows:\n- **T1:** Tumor $\\leq 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n- **T2:** Tumor $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ but $\\leq 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n- **T3:** Tumor $> 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension OR minor bone erosion OR perineural invasion (PNI) OR deep invasion. (Deep invasion is defined as invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat or $>6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ thickness).\n- **T4:** Tumor with gross cortical bone/marrow invasion (T4a) or skull base invasion/foramen involvement (T4b).\n\nLet us apply these definitions to the given case:\n1.  **Tumor Size:** The greatest dimension is $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. This measurement satisfies the condition $>2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ but $\\leq 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. This places the tumor in at least the $T2$ category based on size alone.\n2.  **Invasion Status:**\n    - Perineural invasion (of a named nerve): Absent.\n    - Bone erosion: Absent.\n    - Deep invasion (beyond subcutaneous fat): Absent.\n    Since none of the criteria for $T3$ or $T4$ invasion are met, the tumor is not upstaged to a higher category.\n\nFeatures such as ear location and poor differentiation are indeed high-risk prognostic factors that influence the overall prognostic stage group, but they do not alter the definition of the primary T-category itself in the AJCC 8th edition. The T-category is determined strictly by size and the specific invasion patterns listed above.\n\nBased on its size of $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and the absence of $T3/T4$ features, the primary tumor is classified as $T2$.\nThe specified numerical code for $T2$ is $2$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Nodal Metastasis Probability\n\nThe probability of regional nodal metastasis, $p$, is calculated using a multiplicative odds model.\n\n1.  **Convert Baseline Probability to Baseline Odds:**\nThe relationship between probability $p$ and odds is $\\text{Odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\nThe baseline probability is $p_0 = 0.02$. The baseline odds are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.02}{1-0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{2}{98} = \\frac{1}{49}\n$$\n\n2.  **Identify Applicable Risk Factors and Calculate New Odds:**\nWe must check which of the given risk factors apply to this specific tumor:\n- **Ear location:** Yes, the tumor is on the auricle. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{ear}}=2.0$.\n- **Poor differentiation:** Yes, the histopathology confirms this. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{poor}}=2.5$.\n- **Size $>2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:** Yes, the tumor is $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{size}}=1.8$.\n\nThe new odds, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}$, are found by multiplying the baseline odds by the odds ratios for all applicable risk factors:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{Odds}_0 \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{ear}} \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{poor}} \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{size}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{49} \\times 2.0 \\times 2.5 \\times 1.8\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{49} \\times (5.0 \\times 1.8) = \\frac{1}{49} \\times 9.0 = \\frac{9}{49}\n$$\n\n3.  **Convert New Odds to New Probability:**\nThe relationship to convert odds back to probability is $p = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1+\\text{Odds}}$.\nThe estimated probability $p$ of regional nodal metastasis is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}}{1+\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{1+\\frac{9}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{\\frac{49}{49}+\\frac{9}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{\\frac{58}{49}} = \\frac{9}{58}\n$$\n\n4.  **Calculate Numerical Value and Round:**\nFinally, we compute the decimal value and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\np = \\frac{9}{58} \\approx 0.1551724...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $p \\approx 0.155$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n- T-category numerical code: $2$\n- Probability of nodal metastasis, $p$: $0.155$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix.",

You will construct a quantitative risk score for occult cervical nodal metastasis using foundational high-risk pathologic features recognized in head and neck oncology and then use a calibrated multiplicative-odds model to estimate risk and select a nodal management strategy.\n\nFoundational base:\n- High-risk features that increase the risk of occult nodal metastasis for cSCC of the head and neck include large tumor diameter, poor histologic differentiation, clinically significant perineural invasion, and invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat. These features have been widely used in risk stratification systems and are supported by observational evidence.\n- In logistic regression for binary outcomes, odds ratios multiply under the assumption of approximately independent contributions from distinct risk features. If each additional high-risk feature multiplies the baseline odds by a constant factor, the total odds scale multiplicatively with the count of features.\n\nDefine the risk score:\n- Define a binary indicator for each high-risk feature and sum them to obtain the risk score $S$:\n  1. Diameter indicator $I_{D}$ equals $1$ if tumor diameter $\\geq 2.0\\,\\text{cm}$ and $0$ otherwise.\n  2. Differentiation indicator $I_{\\mathrm{PD}}$ equals $1$ if histology is poorly differentiated and $0$ otherwise.\n  3.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated. All givens were extracted and assessed for scientific grounding, consistency, and completeness. The problem is a well-posed application of a statistical model to a clinical scenario in otorhinolaryngology, using established risk factors and a standard decision-making framework. It is free of scientific flaws, ambiguity, and contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four sequential tasks as specified.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the risk score $S$ for the patient.**\n\nThe total risk score $S$ is the sum of four binary indicators: $S = I_{D} + I_{\\mathrm{PD}} + I_{\\mathrm{PNI}} + I_{\\mathrm{BF}}$. We evaluate each indicator based on the patient's tumor details.\n\n1.  **Diameter indicator ($I_{D}$):** The tumor's maximum clinical diameter is $2.1\\,\\text{cm}$. The condition for $I_{D}=1$ is a diameter $\\geq 2.0\\,\\text{cm}$. Since $2.1 \\geq 2.0$, we have $I_{D} = 1$.\n2.  **Differentiation indicator ($I_{\\mathrm{PD}}$):** The histology is moderately differentiated. The condition for $I_{\\mathrm{PD}}=1$ is poor differentiation. Therefore, $I_{\\mathrm{PD}} = 0$.\n3.  **Perineural invasion indicator ($I_{\\mathrm{PNI}}$):** Perineural invasion is present along a nerve with a caliber of $0.15\\,\\text{mm}$. The condition for $I_{\\mathrm{PNI}}=1$ is perineural invasion involving a nerve with caliber $\\geq 0.1\\,\\text{mm}$. Since $0.15 \\geq 0.1$, we have $I_{\\mathrm{PNI}} = 1$.\n4.  **Beyond-fat indicator ($I_{\\mathrm{BF}}$):** The invasion extends beyond the subcutaneous fat into the muscle. The condition for $I_{\\mathrm{BF}}=1$ is invasion extending beyond the subcutaneous fat. Therefore, $I_{\\mathrm{BF}} = 1$.\n\nThe total risk score for this patient is the sum of these indicators:\n$$\nS = I_{D} + I_{\\mathrm{PD}} + I_{\\mathrm{PNI}} + I_{\\mathrm{BF}} = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Derive the probability $p(S)$ of occult nodal metastasis.**\n\nThe problem states a multiplicative-odds model. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds $O$ is given by $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$. The model posits that for a risk score $S$, the odds of metastasis, $O_S$, are given by:\n$$\nO_S = O_0 k^S\n$$\nwhere $O_0$ represents the baseline odds (for $S=0$) and $k$ is the constant multiplicative factor for each additional high-risk feature.\n\nWe are given two anchor points to calibrate the model:\n- For $S=0$, the probability is $p_0 = 0.03$.\n- For $S=2$, the probability is $p_2 = 0.20$.\n\nFirst, we convert these probabilities to odds.\nThe baseline odds for $S=0$ are:\n$$\nO_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.03}{1-0.03} = \\frac{0.03}{0.97} = \\frac{3}{97}\n$$\nThe odds for $S=2$ are:\n$$\nO_2 = \\frac{p_2}{1-p_2} = \\frac{0.20}{1-0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nNow, we use the model equation for $S=2$ to find $k$:\n$$\nO_2 = O_0 k^2\n$$\n$$\nk^2 = \\frac{O_2}{O_0} = \\frac{1/4}{3/97} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{97}{3} = \\frac{97}{12}\n$$\nThe multiplicative factor $k$ is the positive square root of this value:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{97}{12}}\n$$\nThe general formula for the odds for any score $S$ is:\n$$\nO_S = O_0 k^S = \\frac{3}{97} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{97}{12}} \\right)^S = \\frac{3}{97} \\left( \\frac{97}{12} \\right)^{S/2}\n$$\nThe probability $p(S)$ is then found by converting the odds $O_S$ back to probability:\n$$\np(S) = \\frac{O_S}{1+O_S} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{97} \\left( \\frac{97}{12} \\right)^{S/2}}{1 + \\frac{3}{97} \\left( \\frac{97}{12} \\right)^{S/2}}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Evaluate the probability $p$ for the patient's score $S$.**\n\nFrom Task 1, the patient's score is $S=3$. We substitute this into the odds formula:\n$$\nO_3 = O_0 k^3 = \\frac{3}{97} \\left( \\frac{97}{12} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\nO_3 = \\frac{3}{97} \\cdot \\frac{97^{3/2}}{12^{3/2}} = \\frac{3}{97} \\cdot \\frac{97\\sqrt{97}}{12\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{97}}{12\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{4\\sqrt{12}}\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$\nO_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{4(2\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the probability $p_3$ for the patient:\n$$\np_3 = \\frac{O_3}{1+O_3} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3}}}{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{97}}{8\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{97}}\n$$\n\n**Task 4: Determine the nodal management strategy code.**\n\nTo apply the decision algorithm, we must determine the numerical range for $p_3$. We can approximate the values: $\\sqrt{97} \\approx 9.849$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$.\n$$\np_3 \\approx \\frac{9.849}{8(1.732) + 9.849} = \\frac{9.849}{13.856 + 9.849} = \\frac{9.849}{23.705} \\approx 0.4155\n$$\nThe decision algorithm is:\n- Code $0$: $p < 0.05$\n- Code $1$: $0.05 \\leq p < 0.15$\n- Code $2$: $0.15 \\leq p < 0.30$\n- Code $3$: $p \\geq 0.30$\n\nOur calculated probability is $p_3 \\approx 0.4155$. This value satisfies the condition $p \\geq 0.30$. Therefore, the recommended nodal management strategy corresponds to integer code $3$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two fundamental metrics in evidence-based medicine: the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT). These metrics are used to compare the effectiveness of two interventions.\n\nFirst, we identify the relevant quantities from the problem statement. The context is a comparison between two surgical strategies for infiltrative basal cell carcinoma of the nasal ala over a fixed time horizon of $T=5$ years.\n\nThe control group is an idealized cohort of patients undergoing standard excision with conventional margins. The risk or probability of the adverse event (tumor recurrence) in this group is given as $p_{\\mathrm{exc}}$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{control}} = p_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0.12$.\n\nThe treatment or intervention group is a comparable cohort of patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery. The risk of recurrence in this group is given as $p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}}$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{treatment}} = p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}} = 0.07$.\n\nThe absolute risk reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference in the event rates between the control group and the treatment group. It quantifies the reduction in risk attributable to the intervention. The formula for ARR is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = p_{\\mathrm{control}} - p_{\\mathrm{treatment}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = p_{\\mathrm{exc}} - p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}} = 0.12 - 0.07\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = 0.05\n$$\nThis value represents an absolute reduction in recurrence risk of $5$ percentage points when choosing Mohs surgery over standard excision.\n\nNext, we compute the number needed to treat (NNT). The NNT is an interpretive measure defined as the average number of patients who must receive the specific intervention (Mohs surgery) instead of the control intervention (standard excision) for one additional patient to avoid the adverse event (recurrence) over the specified time period. Mathematically, the NNT is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}}\n$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for ARR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.05}\n$$\nTo perform the calculation, we can express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{100}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n$$\nThe result is an integer, as is often the case in NNT calculations, although this is not a requirement. The interpretation is that, on average, for every $20$ patients with infiltrative BCC of the nasal ala treated with Mohs surgery instead of standard excision, one additional recurrence is prevented over a $5$-year period.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk reduction as a decimal proportion and the number needed to treat as a patient count, presented in a single row matrix.\nThe calculated values are $\\mathrm{ARR} = 0.05$ and $\\mathrm{NNT} = 20$.",
