This first practice provides a quantitative lens to examine one such critical event: the E6 oncoprotein-mediated degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor. By applying a fundamental kinetic model, you will calculate the new steady-state level of p53, gaining a tangible understanding of how a specific molecular interaction dysregulates a key cellular guardian .",

            "problem": "In human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma, the HPV E6 oncoprotein recruits the E6-associated protein (E6AP) ubiquitin ligase to promote proteasomal degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Consider an oropharyngeal epithelial cell in which p53 is synthesized constitutively at a constant rate and degraded via first-order kinetics. By the Central Dogma of molecular biology and mass-action kinetics, assume that p53 dynamics can be modeled as a balance between a constant zero-order synthesis term and a first-order degradation term, and that steady state is achieved when synthesis and degradation rates are equal. The cellular p53 half-life before E6 expression is measured to be $30$ minutes, and the cell is at steady state with a p53 level of $4.5 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules per cell. Upon E6 expression, the p53 half-life decreases to $10$ minutes, while the synthesis rate remains unchanged.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the definition of half-life for a first-order process, determine the new steady-state number of p53 molecules per cell after E6 expression. Express your final answer as the number of molecules per cell and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the new steady-state number of p53 molecules in an oropharyngeal epithelial cell after the expression of the HPV E6 oncoprotein. The solution requires applying principles of reaction kinetics to a simplified model of protein synthesis and degradation.\n\nFirst, we formalize the model provided. The change in the number of p53 molecules, $N$, over time, $t$, is given by the balance between a constant zero-order synthesis rate, $k_s$, and a first-order degradation process with rate constant $k_d$. This relationship is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = k_s - k_d N\n$$\nAt steady state, the number of p53 molecules is constant, meaning the rate of change is zero: $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the steady-state condition where the rate of synthesis equals the rate of degradation:\n$$\nk_s = k_d N_{ss}\n$$\nwhere $N_{ss}$ is the steady-state number of molecules. From this, we can express the steady-state level as:\n$$\nN_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nThe problem provides the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, of the protein, which for a first-order degradation process is related to the rate constant $k_d$ by the well-known formula:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_d}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the degradation rate constant in terms of the half-life:\n$$\nk_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_d$ into the equation for $N_{ss}$, we find the relationship between the steady-state level, the synthesis rate, and the half-life:\n$$\nN_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = \\frac{k_s t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant synthesis rate $k_s$, the steady-state number of molecules $N_{ss}$ is directly proportional to the protein's half-life $t_{1/2}$.\n\nWe are given two conditions: State 1 (before E6 expression) and State 2 (after E6 expression). Let us denote the variables for these two states with subscripts $1$ and $2$, respectively.\n\nIn State 1 (before E6):\nThe half-life is $t_{1/2,1} = 30$ minutes.\nThe steady-state number of molecules is $N_{ss,1} = 4.5 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules.\nThe steady-state equation is:\n$$\nN_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_s t_{1/2,1}}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\n\nIn State 2 (after E6):\nThe half-life is $t_{1/2,2} = 10$ minutes.\nThe synthesis rate, $k_s$, is stated to be unchanged from State 1.\nThe new steady-state number of molecules, $N_{ss,2}$, is what we need to find.\nThe steady-state equation for this state is:\n$$\nN_{ss,2} = \\frac{k_s t_{1/2,2}}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nTo find $N_{ss,2}$, we can take the ratio of the steady-state equations for the two states. This is an efficient approach as it cancels the common terms $k_s$ and $\\ln(2)$.\n$$\n\\frac{N_{ss,2}}{N_{ss,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_s t_{1/2,2}}{\\ln(2)}}{\\frac{k_s t_{1/2,1}}{\\ln(2)}} = \\frac{t_{1/2,2}}{t_{1/2,1}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$$\nN_{ss,2} = N_{ss,1} \\left( \\frac{t_{1/2,2}}{t_{1/2,1}} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_{ss,1} = 4.5 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules\n$t_{1/2,1} = 30$ minutes\n$t_{1/2,2} = 10$ minutes\n$$\nN_{ss,2} = (4.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\left( \\frac{10}{30} \\right) = (4.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_{ss,2} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $15000$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it in standard scientific notation.\n$$\nN_{ss,2} = 1.50 \\times 10^{4}\n$$\nThus, after E6 expression, the new steady-state number of p53 molecules per cell is $1.50 \\times 10^{4}$. This result is consistent with the biological role of E6, which is to enhance p53 degradation, thereby lowering its cellular concentration. A threefold decrease in half-life, with a constant synthesis rate, results in a threefold decrease in the steady-state protein level.",

            "problem": "A head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient presents with two anatomically distinct mucosal lesions sampled by core biopsy. Targeted sequencing reveals an identical single-nucleotide variant in Tumor Protein P53 (TP53) across both samples. Assuming Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status does not alter the diploid state at the TP53 locus in these lesions and that there are no copy-number alterations, consider the following measurements: variant allele frequency (VAF) of $0.08$ in biopsy $A$ and $0.28$ in biopsy $B$, with histopathologic epithelial cellularity (serving as tumor purity under the assumption that the mutation is confined to epithelial tumor cells) of $0.50$ in biopsy $A$ and $0.70$ in biopsy $B$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that, in a diploid mixture of normal and tumor cells, each cell contributes $2$ alleles at a locus, and a heterozygous mutant tumor cell contributes exactly $1$ mutant allele, derive an expression that links the VAF, the tumor purity, and the cancer cell fraction carrying the mutation.

Report $E$ as a single real number rounded to four significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem asks for an expression linking Variant Allele Frequency ($VAF$), tumor purity ($P$), and the Cancer Cell Fraction ($CCF$) of cells carrying a specific mutation. We begin from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe $VAF$ is defined as the ratio of the number of sequencing reads for the mutant allele to the total number of reads covering that genomic locus. In a large population of cells, this frequency approximates the true proportion of mutant alleles in the sampled tissue.\n\n$$ VAF = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} $$\n\nLet us consider a sample of tissue containing a mixture of normal (non-cancerous) cells and tumor (cancerous) cells.\n- Let $P$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of cells in the sample that are tumor cells. Thus, the fraction of normal cells is $1 - P$.\n- Let $CCF$ be the cancer cell fraction, which is the fraction of tumor cells that carry the mutation.\n- The problem states the locus is diploid, meaning each cell (normal or tumor) has $2$ alleles at this site.\n- The mutation is a single-nucleotide variant and is assumed to be heterozygous in the mutant cells. This means each mutant tumor cell contains $1$ mutant allele and $1$ wild-type allele. Normal cells contain $2$ wild-type alleles.\n\nIn a representative population of $N$ total cells, we have:\n- Number of tumor cells = $P \\times N$.\n- Number of normal cells = $(1 - P) \\times N$.\n\nThe number of mutant alleles is sourced exclusively from the subset of tumor cells carrying the mutation.\n- Number of mutant tumor cells = $CCF \\times (\\text{Number of tumor cells}) = CCF \\times P \\times N$.\n- Since each mutant tumor cell has $1$ mutant allele, the total number of mutant alleles in the sample is $1 \\times (CCF \\times P \\times N) = CCF \\times P \\times N$.\n\nThe total number of alleles at this locus in the entire sample is the sum of alleles from all cells.\n- Total number of alleles = $2 \\times (\\text{Total number of cells}) = 2 \\times N$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these quantities into the definition of $VAF$:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{CCF \\times P \\times N}{2 \\times N} $$\nThe total number of cells $N$ cancels, yielding the general expression:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{CCF \\times P}{2} $$\nThis expression links $VAF$, tumor purity $P$, and cancer cell fraction $CCF$ under the assumptions of diploidy and heterozygosity.\n\nTo compute the $CCF$ for each biopsy, we rearrange this formula:\n$$ CCF = \\frac{2 \\times VAF}{P} $$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the data from biopsy $A$ and biopsy $B$.\n\nFor biopsy $A$:\n- $VAF_A = 0.08$\n- $P_A = 0.50$\n$$ CCF_A = \\frac{2 \\times VAF_A}{P_A} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.08}{0.50} = \\frac{0.16}{0.50} = 0.32 $$\n\nFor biopsy $B$:\n- $VAF_B = 0.28$\n- $P_B = 0.70$\n$$ CCF_B = \\frac{2 \\times VAF_B}{P_B} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.28}{0.70} = \\frac{0.56}{0.70} = 0.80 $$\nThe calculated $CCF$ values of $0.32$ and $0.80$ are physically meaningful, as they lie between $0$ and $1$. This indicates that in biopsy $A$, $32\\%$ of the cancer cells carry the $TP53$ mutation, while in biopsy $B$, $80\\%$ of the cancer cells carry it.\n\nFinally, we calculate the expansion factor $E$, defined as the ratio of the cancer cell fraction in biopsy $B$ to that in biopsy $A$.\n$$ E = \\frac{CCF_B}{CCF_A} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{0.80}{0.32} = 2.5 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ E = 2.500 $$",
