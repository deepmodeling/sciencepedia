This exercise models one of the primary forms of age-related hearing loss, metabolic presbycusis, which is characterized by atrophy of the stria vascularis.

            "problem": "An older adult with metabolic presbycusis (strial atrophy) shows a reduction in the Endocochlear Potential (EP). In the small-signal regime of cochlear mechanics and hair-cell mechanoelectrical transduction, assume the following foundational facts: (i) the receptor potential amplitude at the inner hair cell is approximately proportional to the product of the driving electrochemical potential and the acoustic stimulus pressure amplitude, (ii) behavioral threshold is reached when the receptor potential attains a fixed criterion amplitude, and (iii) Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in decibels is defined for pressures by $\\mathrm{SPL} = 20 \\log_{10}(P/P_{\\mathrm{ref}})$, where $P$ is the pressure amplitude and $P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the reference pressure. In a metabolically normal cochlea, the EP is $+86$ mV. In this patient, invasive electrocochleographic data estimate the EP to be $+63$ mV. Under the assumptions above and neglecting other sources of cochlear dysfunction, predict the behavioral threshold shift attributable to the EP decrease.

Let $E_{\\mathrm{P}}$ denote the Endocochlear Potential (EP), $P$ denote the acoustic pressure amplitude, and $V_{r}$ denote the receptor potential amplitude at the inner hair cell. The problem states we can model the relationship as:\n$$\nV_{r} \\propto E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\cdot P,\n$$\nwhich means there exists a proportionality constant $k$ such that\n$$\nV_{r} = k \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\cdot P.\n$$\nBehavioral threshold corresponds to the receptor potential attaining a fixed criterion amplitude $V_{c}$. Therefore, the threshold pressure amplitude $P_{\\mathrm{th}}$ satisfies\n$$\nV_{c} = k \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{th}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{V_{c}}{k \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{P}}}.\n$$\nThis shows that the threshold pressure is inversely proportional to the Endocochlear Potential.

The HHIE total score is bounded between $0$ and $100$ points. The final program must compute predicted HHIE totals for a fixed test suite of cases and output them in the specified format.\n\nBegin from the following base and constraints grounded in widely accepted clinical and psychometric facts:\n\n1. Definitions and units.\n   - Pure Tone Average (PTA) is the average hearing threshold across standard frequencies and is measured in decibels hearing level (dB HL). Denote it by $PTA$ in $\\mathrm{dB \\ HL}$.\n   - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) loss is the additional $\\mathrm{dB}$ of signal-to-noise ratio required for intelligibility relative to normal-hearing listeners.

No other text should be printed. Ensure the units used in the calculations match those specified above. Angles are not involved.
