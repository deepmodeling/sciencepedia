            "problem": "A patient is planned for two-stage facial reanimation involving Cross-Facial Nerve Grafting (CFNG) followed by Free Functional Muscle Transfer (FFMT). In Stage I, a sural nerve autograft of length $L = 140$ mm is coapted from a donor zygomatic branch on the healthy side to recipient branches on the paralyzed side. After neurorrhaphy, regenerating motor axons must first initiate sprouting following a latency attributable to neurapraxia and Wallerian degeneration, and then traverse the graft to reach the distal coaptation. Assume the following:\n\n- Once axonal sprouting begins, the distal advancement proceeds at a constant average axonal growth rate of $v = 1.5$ mm/day along the graft.\n- The initiation latency due to neurapraxia is modeled as a continuous random variable $T_{0}$ that is uniformly distributed between $14$ and $28$ days, reflecting clinically observed latency windows for Wallerian degeneration and early sprouting in coaptation sites without ongoing compression.\n\nUsing only the definition of constant-velocity motion and the definition of mathematical expectation for a continuous random variable, derive an expression for the expected time to first arrival of axons at the distal end of the CFNG (i.e., the expected reinnervation time for the graft alone), and compute its numerical value.

The scenario describes a standard surgical procedure for facial reanimation. The provided values for graft length ($L = 140$ mm), axonal regeneration rate ($v = 1.5$ mm/day), and latency period ($14$ to $28$ days) are clinically realistic and consistent with established values in peripheral nerve surgery literature. The modeling of axonal growth as a constant-velocity process and latency as a uniform random variable are common and appropriate simplifications for biophysical modeling. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on elementary principles of kinematics and probability theory. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe total time required for the first regenerating axons to traverse the nerve graft, which we denote as $T_{total}$, is the sum of two distinct periods: the initial latency time, $T_0$, and the time required for the axons to travel the length of the graft, $T_{travel}$. As an additional modeling assumption, we posit that these two time components are independent.\n\n$$T_{total} = T_0 + T_{travel}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected time to first arrival, which is the mathematical expectation of $T_{total}$, denoted $E[T_{total}]$. By the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n\n$$E[T_{total}] = E[T_0 + T_{travel}] = E[T_0] + E[T_{travel}]$$\n\nWe will now derive expressions for each term on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, we consider the travel time, $T_{travel}$. The problem states that axons advance at a constant average rate $v$ over a distance $L$. Using the definition of constant-velocity motion (distance = rate × time), we have:\n\n$$L = v \\cdot T_{travel}$$\n\nSolving for $T_{travel}$ gives:\n\n$$T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nSince $L$ and $v$ are given as constants, $T_{travel}$ is a deterministic value, not a random variable. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself:\n\n$$E[T_{travel}] = T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nNext, we consider the latency time, $T_0$. This is given as a continuous random variable that is uniformly distributed on the interval $[a, b]$, where $a = 14$ days and $b = 28$ days. The probability density function (PDF) for a uniform distribution on $[a, b]$ is:\n\n$$f_{T_0}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a}  \\text{if } a \\le t \\le b \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe expected value (or mean) of a continuous random variable is defined as $E[T_0] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t \\cdot f_{T_0}(t) \\, dt$. Applying this definition to our specific PDF:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\int_{a}^{b} t \\cdot \\frac{1}{b-a} \\, dt$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\frac{1}{b-a}$ and perform the integration:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_{a}^{b} t \\, dt = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\left[ \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_{a}^{b}$$\n\nEvaluating the integral at its limits:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\left( \\frac{b^2}{2} - \\frac{a^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{2(b-a)}$$\n\nFactoring the numerator as a difference of squares, $(b^2 - a^2) = (b-a)(b+a)$:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2(b-a)} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$\n\nNow we combine the derived expressions for $E[T_0]$ and $E[T_{travel}]$ to find the expression for the expected total time:\n\n$$E[T_{total}] = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nThis is the general symbolic expression for the expected reinnervation time under the given model.\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we substitute the given values:\n- Graft length, $L = 140$ mm\n- Growth rate, $v = 1.5$ mm/day\n- Latency interval, $[a, b] = [14, 28]$ days\n\nFirst, calculate the expected latency time, $E[T_0]$:\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{14 + 28}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ days}$$\n\nNext, calculate the travel time, $T_{travel}$:\n$$T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{140 \\text{ mm}}{1.5 \\text{ mm/day}} = \\frac{140}{3/2} = \\frac{280}{3} \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe exact value of the travel time is approximately $93.333...$ days.\n\nFinally, the expected total reinnervation time is the sum of these two values:\n$$E[T_{total}] = 21 + \\frac{280}{3} = \\frac{63}{3} + \\frac{280}{3} = \\frac{343}{3} \\text{ days}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$E[T_{total}] = 114.3333... \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $1$, $4$, and $3$. Therefore, the rounded value is $114.3$.",

All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are explicitly provided, rendering the problem valid and self-contained. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to model the process of motor axons traversing a nerve graft. Each of the $N_{\\text{donor}}$ donor axons can be considered an independent trial. A \"success\" for a trial occurs if the axon's sprout is captured and successfully traverses the graft to reach the Free Functional Muscle Transfer (FFMT). The probability of success for any single axon is given as the capture fraction, $f$. This scenario is a classic series of Bernoulli trials.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each of the $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N_{\\text{donor}}$ axons.\nThe variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if the } i\\text{-th axon successfully reaches the FFMT} \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of success for each trial is $f$. Therefore, the probability distribution for each $X_i$ is:\n$$ P(X_i = 1) = f $$\n$$ P(X_i = 0) = 1-f $$\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is given by:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = (1)(f) + (0)(1-f) = f $$\nThe total number of axons delivered to the FFMT, denoted as $N_{\\text{delivered}}$, is the sum of the outcomes of these $N_{\\text{donor}}$ individual trials:\n$$ N_{\\text{delivered}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{donor}}} X_i $$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of delivered axons, $E[N_{\\text{delivered}}]$. Using the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds even if the variables are not independent, though in this problem they are stated to be.\n$$ E[N_{\\text{delivered}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{donor}}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{donor}}} E[X_i] $$\nSince each $X_i$ is an identically distributed Bernoulli variable with an expectation of $f$, we are summing the constant value $f$ a total of $N_{\\text{donor}}$ times:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{delivered}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{donor}}} f = N_{\\text{donor}} \\cdot f $$\nThis completes the derivation of the expected number of axons delivered to the FFMT.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute this value given the specific parameters:\n- Donor motor axon count, $N_{\\text{donor}} = 4{,}000$\n- Sprout-to-graft capture fraction, $f = 0.5$\n- Minimum required motor axon quota, $N_{\\min} = 1{,}500$\n\nSubstituting the given values into our derived formula:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{delivered}}] = (4{,}000) \\cdot (0.5) = 2{,}000 $$\nSo, the expected number of axons delivered to the FFMT is $2{,}000$.\n\nThe problem also requires us to determine if this expected number meets or exceeds the minimum quota $N_{\\min}$.
