            "introduction": "A foundational understanding of turbinate reduction begins with the physics of airflow. This exercise  challenges you to derive the governing equations for laminar flow from the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations, applying them to a simplified parallel-plate model of the nasal airway. By calculating key aerodynamic parameters like Wall Shear Stress ($ \\tau_w $) and pressure drop ($ \\Delta p $), you will gain direct insight into how surgical alterations to airway geometry produce measurable physical effects, a principle that underpins modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses.",

            "problem": "A patient-specific segment of the inferior meatus is modeled as a steady, incompressible, laminar flow between two parallel plates to approximate the local flow regime and wall interactions for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The goal is to set up boundary conditions representing either volumetric inflow or pressure drop and then compute the resulting local Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and pressure distribution after a specified inferior turbinate volume reduction. The inferior turbinate is represented by a soft-tissue protrusion of thickness that reduces when the volume is reduced, increasing the available channel height. The model assumes no-slip at the walls, a uniform channel width, and an anatomically plausible segment length.\n\nStarting from well-tested physical principles, namely the steady, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ and $\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ under laminar conditions), the parallel-plate approximation is considered as the valid foundational base for deriving the necessary relations. The physical fluid is air with a constant dynamic viscosity. The inferior meatus segment geometry is defined by the channel length, width, and the post-reduction gap height. The reduction fraction is specified as a decimal number. You must not use any pre-given shortcut formulas; derive and implement the necessary relations from the fundamental base.\n\nDefine the geometry as follows: the channel has length $L$ (in meters), width $w$ (in meters), and a post-reduction gap height $h$ (in meters) computed from a baseline bony-to-turbinate distance $h_{\\text{base}}$ (in meters), an initial hypertrophic soft-tissue thickness $t$ (in meters), and a reduction fraction $f$ (unitless decimal). The post-reduction effective height is $h = h_{\\text{base}} - t(1 - f)$, assumed uniform along $L$ and strictly positive. The fluid has dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ (in Pascal-second). Boundary conditions are either flow-driven (specified volumetric flow rate $Q$, in cubic meters per second) with the outlet gauge pressure fixed at $0$ Pascal, or pressure-driven (specified inlet-to-outlet pressure drop $\\Delta p$, in Pascal) with the outlet gauge pressure fixed at $0$ Pascal.\n\nYour program must, for each test case, compute and return:\n- The post-reduction local wall shear stress at the walls, $ \\tau_w $, in Pascals,\n- The inlet-to-outlet pressure drop, $ \\Delta p $, in Pascals,\n- The volumetric flow rate, $ Q $, in cubic meters per second,\n- The pressure distribution sampled at three axial locations $x = 0$, $x = L/2$, and $x = L$, expressed as gauge pressures in Pascals.\n\nAll outputs must be expressed in International System of Units (SI). Angles are not involved. The reduction fraction must be provided and interpreted as a decimal number (not with a percentage sign). The pressure distribution should be consistent with a physically plausible laminar regime in a parallel-plate channel with no-slip boundaries.\n\nTest suite:\n1. Flow-driven, moderate reduction:\n   - Dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}$ Pascal-second,\n   - Width $w = 0.012$ meter,\n   - Length $L = 0.05$ meter,\n   - Baseline height $h_{\\text{base}} = 0.004$ meter,\n   - Hypertrophic thickness $t = 0.0015$ meter,\n   - Reduction fraction $f = 0.3$,\n   - Volumetric flow $Q = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ cubic meter per second.\n2. Flow-driven, severe pre-reduction narrowing (no reduction):\n   - Dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}$ Pascal-second,\n   - Width $w = 0.010$ meter,\n   - Length $L = 0.05$ meter,\n   - Baseline height $h_{\\text{base}} = 0.003$ meter,\n   - Hypertrophic thickness $t = 0.002$ meter,\n   - Reduction fraction $f = 0.0$,\n   - Volumetric flow $Q = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ cubic meter per second.\n3. Pressure-driven, moderate reduction:\n   - Dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}$ Pascal-second,\n   - Width $w = 0.012$ meter,\n   - Length $L = 0.05$ meter,\n   - Baseline height $h_{\\text{base}} = 0.004$ meter,\n   - Hypertrophic thickness $t = 0.0015$ meter,\n   - Reduction fraction $f = 0.3$,\n   - Pressure drop $\\Delta p = 80.0$ Pascal.\n4. Flow-driven, marked reduction from severe narrowing:\n   - Dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}$ Pascal-second,\n   - Width $w = 0.010$ meter,\n   - Length $L = 0.05$ meter,\n   - Baseline height $h_{\\text{base}} = 0.003$ meter,\n   - Hypertrophic thickness $t = 0.0025$ meter,\n   - Reduction fraction $f = 0.6$,\n   - Volumetric flow $Q = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ cubic meter per second.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a list of results for all test cases. Each test case result must be a list in the form $[\\tau_w, \\Delta p, Q, [p(0), p(L/2), p(L)]]$, and the overall output must be a comma-separated list of these per-case lists enclosed in square brackets. For example, a valid output format is\n$[[\\tau_{w1},\\Delta p_1,Q_1,[p_1(0),p_1(L/2),p_1(L)]],[\\tau_{w2},\\Delta p_2,Q_2,[p_2(0),p_2(L/2),p_2(L)]],\\dots]$.",

This is a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics. The application to a simplified nasal airway geometry is a standard and valid approach in biomedical engineering and CFD.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. For a given geometry and fluid, specifying either the flow rate ($Q$) or the pressure drop ($\\Delta p$) is sufficient to determine a unique, stable flow field and all related quantities ($\\tau_w$, pressure distribution).\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All parameters and objectives are clearly defined.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary parameters are provided for each test case. The geometric definition $h = h_{\\text{base}} - t(1 - f)$ is unambiguous. A check confirms that the resulting height $h$ is strictly positive for all test cases, ensuring a physically valid channel. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The physical parameters for air viscosity, nasal passage dimensions, airflow rates, and pressure drops are within anatomically and physiologically plausible ranges. The model is a valid simplification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles as required.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from the steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flow in a channel of length $L$, width $w$, and height $h$. We establish a coordinate system where $x$ is the direction of flow (along $L$), $y$ is the direction of width (from $-w/2$ to $w/2$), and $z$ is the direction of height (from $-h/2$ to $h/2$). The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = (u, v, w_z)$, where we use $w_z$ for the z-component of velocity to avoid confusion with the channel width $w$.\n\nFor fully developed, laminar flow between parallel plates, we make the standard assumptions:\n1.  The flow is unidirectional: $v=0$ and $w_z=0$.\n2.  The velocity profile is independent of the flow direction $x$: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n3.  The channel width is much larger than the height ($w \\gg h$), so we neglect side-wall effects and assume the flow is two-dimensional in the $x-z$ plane: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\nThe continuity equation, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z} = 0$, is satisfied by these assumptions.\n\nThe Navier-Stokes momentum equation, $\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$, simplifies considerably. The advection term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ is zero because $v=w_z=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}=0$. The $y$ and $z$ components of the momentum equation reduce to $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0$ (neglecting gravity), indicating that pressure $p$ is a function of $x$ only, $p=p(x)$.\n\nThe $x$-component of the momentum equation becomes:\n$$0 = -\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$$\nWith our assumptions, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2}$$\nThe left side is a function of $x$ only, and the right side is a function of $z$ only. For this equality to hold, both sides must be equal to a constant. As the flow is driven by a pressure drop, pressure must decrease linearly along $x$. Therefore, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is constant and negative.\nLet the pressure drop over length $L$ be $\\Delta p = p(0) - p(L)$. The constant pressure gradient is $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the momentum equation gives a second-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u(z)$:\n$$\\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$$\nIntegrating with respect to $z$ twice yields:\n$$\\mu \\frac{du}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} z + C_1$$\n$$\\mu u(z) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2$$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions: $u(z) = 0$ at the walls $z = \\pm h/2$.\n1.  At $z = h/2$: $0 = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} (\\frac{h}{2})^2 + C_1 (\\frac{h}{2}) + C_2$\n2.  At $z = -h/2$: $0 = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} (-\\frac{h}{2})^2 + C_1 (-\\frac{h}{2}) + C_2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $0 = C_1 h$, which implies $C_1 = 0$. Substituting $C_1=0$ back into the first equation gives $C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} \\frac{h^2}{4} = \\frac{\\Delta p \\, h^2}{8L}$.\n\nThe velocity profile is therefore:\n$$u(z) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} z^2 + \\frac{\\Delta p \\, h^2}{8L} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - z^2 \\right)$$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic velocity profile of Plane Poiseuille flow.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the channel's cross-sectional area $A = w \\times h$:\n$$Q = \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u(z) \\,dz \\,dy = w \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - z^2 \\right) \\,dz$$\n$$Q = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{h^2}{4}z - \\frac{z^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} - \\frac{h^3}{24} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{\\mu L} \\frac{2h^3}{24}$$\n$$Q = \\frac{w h^3 \\Delta p}{12 \\mu L}$$\nThis equation relates the flow rate $Q$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta p$. We can rearrange it to find $\\Delta p$ if $Q$ is known:\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{12 \\mu L Q}{w h^3}$$\n\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the magnitude of the viscous stress tensor at the wall. For this flow, $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dz}$.\n$$\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - z^2 \\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} (-2z) = -\\frac{\\Delta p \\, z}{\\mu L}$$\nEvaluating at the walls, $z = \\pm h/2$:\n$$\\tau_w = |\\tau_{zx}(z=\\pm h/2)| = \\left| -\\frac{\\Delta p (\\pm h/2)}{\\mu L} \\right| = \\frac{\\Delta p \\, h}{2L}$$\nAlternatively, by substituting the expression for $\\Delta p$ in terms of $Q$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{12 \\mu L Q}{w h^3} \\right) h}{2L} = \\frac{6 \\mu Q}{w h^2}$$\n\nFinally, the pressure distribution $p(x)$ is found by integrating the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$ from $x$ to $L$, using the boundary condition $p(L)=0$:\n$$\\int_{x}^{L} \\frac{dp}{dx'} \\,dx' = p(L) - p(x) = \\int_{x}^{L} -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} \\,dx'$$\n$$-p(x) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} (L-x) \\implies p(x) = \\Delta p \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$$\nWe need to compute the pressure at $x=0$, $x=L/2$, and $x=L$:\n- $p(0) = \\Delta p (1 - 0) = \\Delta p$\n- $p(L/2) = \\Delta p (1 - 1/2) = \\Delta p / 2$\n- $p(L) = \\Delta p (1 - 1) = 0$\nThe pressure distribution vector is $[\\Delta p, \\Delta p/2, 0]$.\n\nThe solution algorithm is as follows for each test case:\n1.  Calculate the post-reduction height $h = h_{\\text{base}} - t(1 - f)$.\n2.  If the case is flow-driven, $Q$ is given. Calculate $\\Delta p = \\frac{12 \\mu L Q}{w h^3}$.\n3.  If the case is pressure-driven, $\\Delta p$ is given. Calculate $Q = \\frac{w h^3 \\Delta p}{12 \\mu L}$.\n4.  With both $Q$ and $\\Delta p$ known, calculate the wall shear stress $\\tau_w = \\frac{\\Delta p \\, h}{2L}$.\n5.  Determine the pressure distribution vector $[p(0), p(L/2), p(L)] = [\\Delta p, \\Delta p/2, 0]$.\n6.  Assemble the results: $[\\tau_w, \\Delta p, Q, [p(0), p(L/2), p(L)]]$.\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case in the provided test suite.",

The provided data are:\n- Trial $1$: $\\theta_1 = 0.33$, $s_1 = 0.15$, $n_1 = 50$.\n- Trial $2$: $\\theta_2 = 0.30$, $s_2 = 0.12$, $n_2 = 80$.\n\nThe sampling variance of the mean for each study, $v_i$, is given by the formula $v_i = \\frac{s_i^2}{n_i}$.\nFor Trial $1$:\n$$ v_1 = \\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} = \\frac{(0.15)^2}{50} = \\frac{0.0225}{50} = 0.00045 $$\nFor Trial $2$:\n$$ v_2 = \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} = \\frac{(0.12)^2}{80} = \\frac{0.0144}{80} = 0.00018 $$\n\nThe weight for each study, $w_i$, is the inverse of its variance: $w_i = \\frac{1}{v_i}$.\n$$ w_1 = \\frac{1}{0.00045} $$\n$$ w_2 = \\frac{1}{0.00018} $$\n\nThe pooled mean proportional change, $\\theta_{\\text{pooled}}$, is the weighted average of the individual study means:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{w_1 \\theta_1 + w_2 \\theta_2}{w_1 + w_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{v_1} \\theta_1 + \\frac{1}{v_2} \\theta_2}{\\frac{1}{v_1} + \\frac{1}{v_2}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{0.00045}(0.33) + \\frac{1}{0.00018}(0.30)}{\\frac{1}{0.00045} + \\frac{1}{0.00018}} $$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can determine the relative contribution of each weight. The ratio of the weights is:\n$$ \\frac{w_1}{w_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{0.00018}{0.00045} = \\frac{18}{45} = \\frac{2}{5} $$\nThis implies that $w_2 = \\frac{5}{2} w_1$. The sum of the weights is $w_1 + w_2 = w_1 + \\frac{5}{2} w_1 = \\frac{7}{2} w_1$.\nThe formula for the pooled mean can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{w_1 \\theta_1 + \\frac{5}{2} w_1 \\theta_2}{\\frac{7}{2} w_1} = \\frac{w_1(\\theta_1 + \\frac{5}{2} \\theta_2)}{\\frac{7}{2} w_1} = \\frac{2}{7}\\theta_1 + \\frac{5}{7}\\theta_2 $$\nSubstituting the mean values for $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{2}{7}(0.33) + \\frac{5}{7}(0.30) = \\frac{2 \\times 0.33 + 5 \\times 0.30}{7} = \\frac{0.66 + 1.50}{7} = \\frac{2.16}{7} $$\n\n**2. Apply the attenuation factor.**\n\nThe patient's perennial allergic rhinitis results in a multiplicative attenuation of the PNIF gain by a factor $\\alpha = 0.85$. The adjusted proportional change for this patient, $\\theta_{\\text{adj}}$, is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{adj}} = \\alpha \\times \\theta_{\\text{pooled}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{2.16}{7} $$\n\n**3. Compute the expected absolute improvement.**\n\nThe expected absolute improvement, $\\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}}$, is the adjusted proportional change applied to the patient's baseline PNIF, $\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{pre}} = 70 \\ \\text{L/min}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}} = \\theta_{\\text{adj}} \\times \\text{PNIF}_{\\text{pre}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}} = \\left( 0.85 \\times \\frac{2.16}{7} \\right) \\times 70 $$\nThe calculation simplifies as follows:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}} = 0.85 \\times 2.16 \\times \\frac{70}{7} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}} = 0.85 \\times 2.16 \\times 10 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\text{PNIF}_{\\text{exp}} = 8.5 \\times 2.16 $$\nPerforming the final multiplication:\n$$ 8.5 \\times 2.16 = 18.36 $$\nThe expected absolute improvement in PNIF is $18.36 \\ \\text{L/min}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $18.36$ already consists of four significant figures.",

This advanced problem  introduces a sophisticated method for quantifying surgical risk by modeling postoperative epistaxis as a non-homogeneous Poisson process. By calculating the absolute probability of an adverse event over time and adjusting for risk multipliers like anticoagulation, you will learn to apply stochastic modeling to inform patient counseling and complex perioperative decision-making.",

            "problem": "A patient with chronic nasal obstruction due to inferior turbinate hypertrophy is scheduled for submucosal radiofrequency inferior turbinate reduction. For non-anticoagulated patients undergoing this technique, clinically significant postoperative epistaxis events in the first $24$ hours can be modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a piecewise-constant baseline instantaneous hazard per hour given by $h_{0}(t) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ for $t \\in [0,1)$ hours, $h_{0}(t) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ for $t \\in [1,6)$ hours, and $h_{0}(t) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ for $t \\in [6,24)$ hours, where $t=0$ marks the end of the procedure. The patient remains on a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC), apixaban, without perioperative interruption. For apixaban exposure, the hemorrhage hazard is multiplicatively increased by a factor of $2.5$ over $[0,1)$ hours, by a factor of $2.0$ over $[1,6)$ hours, and by a factor of $1.6$ over $[6,24)$ hours, relative to the non-anticoagulated baseline.\n\nAssuming the non-homogeneous Poisson process model applies and the multiplicative hazard adjustment accurately reflects drug effect, compute the absolute probability (as a unitless decimal) of at least one clinically significant postoperative epistaxis event in the first $24$ hours after surgery for this apixaban-treated patient.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of stochastic processes, specifically the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), and is mathematically well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens.\n\nThe occurence of clinically significant postoperative epistaxis events is modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Let $N(T)$ be the number of events in the time interval $[0, T]$. The probability of observing $k$ events in this interval is given by the Poisson distribution:\n$$P(N(T)=k) = \\frac{[\\Lambda(T)]^k \\exp(-\\Lambda(T))}{k!}$$\nwhere $\\Lambda(T)$ is the cumulative intensity function, also known as the mean value function of the process. The cumulative intensity is the integral of the instantaneous hazard rate (or intensity function) $\\lambda(t)$ over the interval:\n$$\\Lambda(T) = \\int_0^T \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau$$\nWe are asked to find the probability of at least one event in the first $24$ hours, which is $P(N(24) \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, i.e., zero events, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$P(N(24) \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N(24)=0)$$\nUsing the Poisson probability formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(N(24)=0) = \\frac{[\\Lambda(24)]^0 \\exp(-\\Lambda(24))}{0!} = \\exp(-\\Lambda(24))$$\nThus, the desired probability is:\n$$P(N(24) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(24))$$\nThe next step is to determine the hazard rate $\\lambda(t)$ for the apixaban-treated patient and then compute the cumulative intensity $\\Lambda(24)$.\n\nThe baseline hazard rate for a non-anticoagulated patient, $h_0(t)$, is given as a piecewise-constant function:\n$$\nh_0(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \n5.0 \\times 10^{-3} & \\text{for } t \\in [0, 1) \\\\\n1.2 \\times 10^{-3} & \\text{for } t \\in [1, 6) \\\\\n3.0 \\times 10^{-4} & \\text{for } t \\in [6, 24)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe effect of apixaban is to multiply this baseline hazard by given factors. Therefore, the hazard rate $\\lambda(t)$ for this patient is also a piecewise-constant function:\nFor $t \\in [0, 1)$, the factor is $2.5$.\n$$\\lambda(t) = 2.5 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 12.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2}$$\nFor $t \\in [1, 6)$, the factor is $2.0$.\n$$\\lambda(t) = 2.0 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$$\nFor $t \\in [6, 24)$, the factor is $1.6$.\n$$\\lambda(t) = 1.6 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 4.8 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nNow, we compute the cumulative intensity $\\Lambda(24)$ by integrating $\\lambda(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=24$.\n$$\\Lambda(24) = \\int_0^{24} \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^1 \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau + \\int_1^6 \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau + \\int_6^{24} \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau$$\nSince $\\lambda(t)$ is constant on each subinterval, the integrals are straightforward:\n$$\\Lambda(24) = (1.25 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (1-0) + (2.4 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (6-1) + (4.8 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (24-6)$$\n$$\\Lambda(24) = (1.25 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 1 + (2.4 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 5 + (4.8 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 18$$\n$$\\Lambda(24) = 0.0125 + 0.012 + 0.00864$$\n$$\\Lambda(24) = 0.03314$$\nFinally, we substitute this value into the probability formula:\n$$P(N(24) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(24)) = 1 - \\exp(-0.03314)$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$P(N(24) \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.96740135 = 0.03259865$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $3$. The first four significant figures are $3$, $2$, $5$, $9$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure. This changes $0.03259$ to $0.03260$.
