Before considering the intricate biomechanics of cartilage reshaping, it is paramount to master the fundamentals of safe anesthetic administration.

            "solution": "The problem is a well-posed question in clinical pharmacology and requires a straightforward application of dimensional analysis. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing the solution are the definitions of drug dosage based on patient weight and concentration of a solution.\nLet $D_{max}$ be the maximum allowable dose rate of lidocaine with epinephrine, $W$ be the child's weight, and $C$ be the concentration of the lidocaine solution.\n\nThe given values are:\n1.  Maximum allowable dose rate, $D_{max} = 7\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{kg}$.\n2.  Child's weight, $W = 30\\,\\text{kg}$.\n3.  Lidocaine solution concentration, $C = 1\\%$, which is explicitly defined as $10\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{mL}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total maximum mass of lidocaine, denoted as $M_{total}$, that can be safely administered to the child. This is calculated by multiplying the maximum allowable dose rate by the child's weight:\n$$M_{total} = D_{max} \\times W$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{total} = (7\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}) \\times (30\\,\\text{kg})$$\nThe unit of kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) cancels, yielding the total mass in milligrams ($\\text{mg}$):\n$$M_{total} = 210\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the volume of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution that contains this total mass. The concentration $C$ of the solution is defined as the mass of the solute $M$ per unit volume of the solution $V$:\n$$C = \\frac{M}{V}$$\nTo find the maximum total volume, $V_{max}$, that can be infiltrated, we rearrange this formula to solve for $V$:\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{M_{total}}{C}$$\nSubstituting the calculated total mass and the given concentration:\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{210\\,\\text{mg}}{10\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}}$$\nThe unit of milligrams ($\\text{mg}$) cancels, leaving the volume in milliliters ($\\text{mL}$):\n$$V_{max} = 21\\,\\text{mL}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $21$. To express this value with three significant figures, we must add a trailing zero after the decimal point.\n$$V_{max} = 21.0\\,\\text{mL}$$\nThis is the maximum total volume of the $1\\%$ lidocaine with epinephrine solution that can be safely administered to the $30\\,\\text{kg}$ child.",

Consider one antihelical fold segment of auricular cartilage modeled as a uniform, slender elastic strip consistent with Euler–Bernoulli (EB) beam theory.
