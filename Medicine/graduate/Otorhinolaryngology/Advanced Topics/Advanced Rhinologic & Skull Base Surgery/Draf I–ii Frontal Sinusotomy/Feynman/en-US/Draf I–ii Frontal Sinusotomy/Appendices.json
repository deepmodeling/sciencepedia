            "problem": "A patient is scheduled for a Draf I–II frontal sinusotomy to improve frontal sinus outflow. Assume the frontal recess ostium behaves as a short, approximately cylindrical conduit for a Newtonian fluid under steady laminar flow, with constant dynamic viscosity and fixed effective length preoperatively and postoperatively. Under these conditions, the hydrodynamic resistance $R$ to volumetric flow follows the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, which implies that $R$ scales inversely with the fourth power of the ostium radius $r$. The surgical goal is to reduce the hydrodynamic resistance by $50\\%$ relative to the preoperative state.\n\nLet the preoperative radius be $r_{0}$ and the postoperative radius be $r_{1}$. Determine the required proportional increase in radius, given by $(r_{1} - r_{0})/r_{0}$, that achieves a $50\\%$ reduction in resistance, under the assumptions stated. Express your final answer as a single exact analytic expression. No rounding is required. The quantity is dimensionless; do not include any unit. For clarity, the requested increase should be reported as a decimal fraction (for example, $0.1892$ would represent an $18.92$ percent increase).",
            "solution": "The problem states that the hydrodynamic resistance, $R$, to volumetric flow through the frontal recess ostium is governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille relationship. Under the specified assumptions that the conduit geometry is an approximately cylindrical tube of fixed effective length and the fluid has a constant dynamic viscosity, the resistance $R$ scales inversely with the fourth power of the ostium's radius, $r$. This relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}$$\nThis implies that the product of the resistance and the fourth power of the radius is a constant for the system. Let's denote this constant by $k$:\n$$R \\cdot r^4 = k$$\nLet $r_0$ and $R_0$ denote the preoperative radius and hydrodynamic resistance, respectively. Similarly, let $r_1$ and $R_1$ denote the postoperative radius and resistance. Applying the scaling law to both the preoperative and postoperative states, we have:\n$$R_0 r_0^4 = k$$\n$$R_1 r_1^4 = k$$\nSince the constant $k$ is the same for both states (as only the radius is altered), we can equate these two expressions:\n$$R_1 r_1^4 = R_0 r_0^4$$\nThe surgical objective is to reduce the hydrodynamic resistance by $50\\%$ relative to the preoperative state. This means the postoperative resistance, $R_1$, must be equal to $50\\%$ of the preoperative resistance, $R_0$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$R_1 = (1 - 0.5) R_0 = 0.5 R_0$$\nWe now substitute this condition into our equation relating the two states:\n$$(0.5 R_0) r_1^4 = R_0 r_0^4$$\nSince the preoperative resistance $R_0$ must be a non-zero, finite quantity, we can divide both sides of the equation by $R_0$:\n$$0.5 r_1^4 = r_0^4$$\nOur goal is to determine the proportional increase in radius, $(r_1 - r_0)/r_0$. To do this, we first need to find the ratio of the postoperative radius to the preoperative radius, $\\frac{r_1}{r_0}$. We can rearrange the previous equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{r_1^4}{r_0^4} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4 = 2$$\nTo find the ratio of the radii, we take the fourth root of both sides. Since radius is a physical dimension, it must be positive, so we consider only the positive real root:\n$$\\frac{r_1}{r_0} = 2^{\\frac{1}{4}}$$\nThe proportional increase in radius is the quantity $\\frac{r_1 - r_0}{r_0}$. We can express this in terms of the ratio $\\frac{r_1}{r_0}$:\n$$\\frac{r_1 - r_0}{r_0} = \\frac{r_1}{r_0} - \\frac{r_0}{r_0} = \\frac{r_1}{r_0} - 1$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the ratio $\\frac{r_1}{r_0}$:\n$$\\text{Proportional increase} = 2^{\\frac{1}{4}} - 1$$\nThis is the required exact analytical expression for the proportional increase in radius needed to achieve a $50\\%$ reduction in hydrodynamic resistance.",

The anteroposterior distance from the anterior beak at the floor to the posterior table at the same level is $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The native frontal ostium anteroposterior diameter is $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nAxial plane at the level of the orbital roof:\nb) A laterally and posteriorly pneumatized ethmoid cell tracks over the orbit, lateral to the frontal sinus, with a thin bony partition separating it from the frontal sinus laterally; there is no evidence of an interfrontal sinus septal cell crossing the midline.\n\nCoronal plane at the level of the frontal recess:\nc) The distance from the lamina papyracea laterally to the attachment of the middle turbinate medially measures $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The ethmoid bulla is well pneumatized; the frontal recess appears narrowed by the anterior cell described above. The skull base and posterior table show no dehiscence.\n\nAssume standard definitions: the agger nasi cell lies anterior-inferior to the frontal recess; Kuhn frontal cells types I–IV are defined as anterior ethmoidal (frontoethmoidal) cells extending into the frontal recess/sinus, with type III being a single large cell extending from the frontal recess into the frontal sinus; supraorbital ethmoid cells pneumatize laterally over the orbit posterior to the frontal sinus. The International Frontal Sinus Anatomy Classification (IFAC) terminology recognizes supra-agger frontal and supra-bullar frontal cells as distinct patterns, but the Kuhn type III description above is acceptable shorthand for a single dominant cell extending into the frontal sinus.\n\nThe surgical goal is a unilateral Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy, defined as removal of the frontal sinus floor to create a wide frontal sinusotomy bounded laterally by the lamina papyracea and medially by the attachment of the middle turbinate, without crossing the nasal septum. From first principles of surgical anatomy and CT-based planning, select the option that best identifies the frontal recess cell pattern and predicts the required bone removal (drilling) extent along the frontal beak/floor and additional cell work to achieve a durable Draf IIa, while respecting safe anterior and posterior limits.\n\nA. The dominant anterior cell is a Kuhn type III frontal cell; a separate lateral posteriorly pneumatized supraorbital ethmoid cell is present. The frontal beak/floor thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

The dominant anterior cell is a Kuhn type IV isolated frontal cell; the lateral pneumatization represents an interfrontal sinus septal cell.

            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical scenario and asks for an analysis of the provided computed tomography (CT) findings to determine the correct anatomical pattern and formulate a surgical plan for a Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Data**: A $42$-year-old patient with unilateral chronic frontal sinusitis, refractory to medical therapy.\n-   **Planned Surgery**: Endoscopic frontal sinus surgery, specifically a unilateral Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy.\n-   **Imaging Data**: High-resolution multiplanar CT (axial, coronal, sagittal) with a slice thickness of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   **Sagittal Plane Findings (a)**:\n    -   A single, well-aerated cell is present superior to the agger nasi region.\n    -   This cell extends superiorly into the frontal sinus by approximately $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ above the native frontal ostium.\n    -   Its posterior wall forms part of the anterior boundary of the frontal sinus cavity.\n    -   Anteroinferior beak (frontal sinus floor) thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ at the level of the natural ostium.\n    -   Anteroposterior (AP) distance from the anterior beak to the posterior table at the floor level is $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    -   Native frontal ostium AP diameter is $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   **Axial Plane Findings (b)**:\n    -   A laterally and posteriorly pneumatized ethmoid cell tracks over the orbit, lateral to the frontal sinus.\n    -   A thin bony partition separates this cell from the frontal sinus laterally.\n    -   There is no interfrontal sinus septal cell crossing the midline.\n-   **Coronal Plane Findings (c)**:\n    -   The distance from the lamina papyracea laterally to the attachment of the middle turbinate medially is $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    -   The ethmoid bulla is well pneumatized.\n    -   The frontal recess is narrowed by the anterior cell described in (a).\n    -   The skull base and posterior table show no dehiscence.\n-   **Provided Definitions**:\n    -   Agger nasi cell: Anterior-inferior to the frontal recess.\n    -   Kuhn frontal cells: Anterior ethmoidal cells extending into the frontal recess/sinus.\n    -   Kuhn type III: A single large cell extending from the frontal recess into the frontal sinus.\n    -   Supraorbital ethmoid cell: Pneumatizes laterally over the orbit posterior to the frontal sinus.\n    -   The problem states the Kuhn type III description is an acceptable shorthand for the cell pattern described.\n-   **Surgical Goal**: A unilateral Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy, defined as removal of the frontal sinus floor bounded laterally by the lamina papyracea and medially by the middle turbinate attachment, not crossing the septum.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides a detailed, multiplanar description of paranasal sinus anatomy based on high-resolution CT imaging, which is the standard of care. The anatomical descriptions, terminology (Kuhn cells, Draf classification, agger nasi, lamina papyracea), and measurements are all consistent with established principles in the field of otorhinolaryngology and rhinology. The scenario is scientifically grounded and realistic.\n\nThe information is self-contained and internally consistent. For instance:\n-   The description in (a) of a single cell superior to the agger nasi, extending $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ into the frontal sinus, perfectly matches the provided definition of a Kuhn type III frontal cell.\n-   The description in (b) of a cell pneumatizing laterally over the orbit is a classic supraorbital ethmoid cell, and the statement explicitly rules out an interfrontal sinus septal cell, preventing ambiguity.\n-   The measurements are plausible: a $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ thick beak, a $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ AP dimension at the floor, and a $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ medial-lateral dimension for the planned opening are all within the range of normal human anatomical variation.\n-   The problem is well-posed, asking for a deduction of a surgical plan from the given anatomical data, which is a standard and logical task in this clinical domain.\n\nThere are no scientific or factual unsoundness, contradictions, ambiguities, or other flaws. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task requires two parts: identifying the anatomical pattern and formulating the surgical plan for a Draf IIa procedure.\n\n**1. Anatomical Pattern Identification:**\n-   **Anterior Cell**: The sagittal view (a) describes a single large cell originating superior to the agger nasi region and extending $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ into the frontal sinus. This is the definitive description of a Kuhn type III frontal cell (or a large supra-agger frontal cell, per IFAC).\n-   **Lateral Cell**: The axial view (b) describes a cell pneumatizing laterally and posteriorly over the orbit, lateral to the frontal sinus. This is the definition of a supraorbital ethmoid cell. The problem statement explicitly confirms there is *no* interfrontal sinus septal cell.\n-   **Conclusion on Anatomy**: The patient has a unilateral Kuhn type III frontal cell and a separate supraorbital ethmoid cell.\n\n**2. Surgical Plan Formulation (Draf IIa):**\nA Draf IIa sinusotomy aims to create a wide and durable opening into the frontal sinus by removing the entire floor of the sinus, from the middle turbinate attachment medially to the lamina papyracea laterally.\n\n-   **Anterior Bone Removal**: To enter the frontal sinus, the surgeon must first address the frontal beak (the anterior aspect of the sinus floor). The given thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This thick bone cannot be removed with forceps; it requires drilling. Therefore, the first key step is drilling through approximately $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of bone anteriorly.\n-   **Medial-Lateral Extent**: The goal is to create an opening from the middle turbinate attachment to the lamina papyracea. Coronal finding (c) gives this distance as $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This will be the target width of the final ostium.\n-   **Superior Extent and Cell Removal**: A dominant Kuhn type III cell extends $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ superiorly into the sinus, obstructing the natural drainage pathway. For a successful and durable sinusotomy, this entire cell must be marsupialized into the frontal sinus. This involves removing its floor, medial wall, lateral wall, and, critically, its roof (the superior wall). Leaving the roof of the cell would create a bony shelf, partitioning the sinus and predisposing to mucus recirculation and restenosis. Standard surgical practice is to ensure the opening extends superiorly to fully incorporate the cell's volume into the main sinus cavity. Removing the cell's structure up to its superior extent ($8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ above the native ostium) and ensuring a small margin of clearance above this (e.g., to $10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ total) is a sound strategy to prevent scarring.\n-   **Posterior Limit and Safety**: The total AP dimension at the sinus floor is $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The anterior beak accounts for $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of this. The space posterior to the beak, up to the posterior table, is therefore $12\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 6\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The posterior table is the anterior wall of the cranial fossa. Breaching it is a severe complication. Therefore, all drilling and bone removal must respect this posterior limit. A $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margin of safety posterior to the beak is substantial and allows for a safe procedure.\n\n**Summary of Derived Plan**: The surgeon should plan for a Draf IIa by drilling through the $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ frontal beak, removing the entire Kuhn type III cell superiorly to a height of at least $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, widening the opening to $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (lamina to middle turbinate), and respecting the posterior table, for which there is a comfortable $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ safety margin at the floor level. The supraorbital ethmoid cell is a key landmark to be aware of to avoid inadvertent entry but is not the primary target of the Draf IIa dissection.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. The dominant anterior cell is a Kuhn type III frontal cell; a separate lateral posteriorly pneumatized supraorbital ethmoid cell is present. The frontal beak/floor thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Plan a Draf IIa with drilling through approximately $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of frontal beak/floor to enter the sinus, then remove the type III cell’s superior wall and any residual septations to at least $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ above its superior extent (total superior clearance target $\\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ above the native ostium), widening the ostium from the middle turbinate attachment medially to the lamina papyracea laterally (approximately $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), keeping the posterior limit anterior to the posterior table (leaving at least $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of posterior safety at the floor level).**\n    -   **Evaluation**: This option correctly identifies the Kuhn type III and supraorbital ethmoid cells. It correctly states the beak thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. It correctly prescribes drilling through the $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ beak. It correctly identifies the need to remove the superior aspect of the type III cell to a height of $\\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (cell height of $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ plus $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ clearance) for a durable opening. It correctly states the medial-lateral target width of $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. It correctly calculates and respects the posterior safety margin of $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Every part of this option is consistent with the provided data and sound surgical principles.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. The dominant anterior cell is a Kuhn type IV isolated frontal cell; the lateral pneumatization represents an interfrontal sinus septal cell. Because of frontal sinus involvement above the ostium, a Draf III (modified Lothrop) is required, with drilling across the midline including the intersinus septum and resection of the superior nasal septum; posterior drilling may proceed to within $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of the posterior table to ensure adequate patency.**\n    -   **Evaluation**: This option incorrectly identifies the cell as a Kuhn type IV (it extends from the recess, thus it is not isolated). It incorrectly identifies the lateral cell as an interfrontal septal cell, which is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement. It proposes an inappropriate and overly aggressive Draf III procedure for unilateral disease. The advice to drill within $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of the posterior table is surgically reckless.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. The only relevant anterior cell is an agger nasi cell; the frontal beak/floor thickness is $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. A Draf I with minimal punch removal of $2$–$3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of bone at the beak is sufficient; no superior drilling above the level of the cell roof is needed if balloon dilation is used.**\n    -   **Evaluation**: This option misidentifies the cell as a simple agger nasi cell, ignoring its superior extension into the frontal sinus. It incorrectly states the beak thickness is $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (it is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). It proposes an inadequate Draf I procedure that would fail to address the $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ beak and the large obstructing Kuhn type III cell. Balloon dilation is also ineffective for this anatomy.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The pattern reflects a supra-agger frontal cell and a frontal bullar cell; the beak/floor thickness is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. A Draf IIa can be accomplished by limited drilling of $3$–$4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ through the beak followed by balloon dilation to expand the opening to approximately $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ between the lamina papyracea and middle turbinate; clearance above the superior extent of the anterior cell is not required if the ostium can be dilated sufficiently.**\n    -   **Evaluation**: This option partially misidentifies the anatomy (there is no evidence for a frontal bullar cell). It incorrectly suggests that drilling only $3$–$4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ would be sufficient to penetrate a $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ beak. It incorrectly proposes using a balloon on thick bone and against a large bony cell. Most importantly, it violates a core principle of frontal surgery by stating that clearance of the superior aspect of the cell is not required, a practice that leads to surgical failure.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

The revision anatomy shows osteoneogenesis of the frontal beak, scarring of the frontal recess, and a narrow Frontal Sinus Outflow Tract (FSOT). The surgeon must plan preoperative and intraoperative imaging and Image-Guided Surgery (IGS) navigation to minimize risk to the skull base and orbit while optimizing creation of a durable neo-ostium. Foundational facts and definitions for planning include the following: Computed Tomography (CT) best delineates bony boundaries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) adds soft tissue characterization; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) can provide intraoperative updates; Optical Tracking (OT) with bone or dental fiducials typically yields lower Target Registration Error (TRE) than surface registration; Electromagnetic (EM) tracking can be degraded by nearby ferromagnetic objects; the lamina papyracea and skull base are critical boundaries; and the anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) lies just inferior to the skull base within the frontal recess. The surgeon must respect clearance distances to both the skull base and lamina papyracea. For safety, the combined localization uncertainty of the system and instrument tip, together with the instrument tip radius, must remain below the smallest clearance distance. Separately, to optimize long-term patency, the cross-sectional area of the neo-ostium should meet or exceed a threshold that reduces resistance to flow and restenosis; classical laminar flow considerations such as Hagen–Poiseuille describe resistance scaling strongly with lumen size.\n\nThe revision anatomy provides the following quantitative constraints measured on diagnostic imaging: minimal vertical clearance to the skull base in the planned corridor is $d_{sb} = 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$; minimal lateral clearance to the lamina papyracea is $d_{lp} = 3.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of four distinct surgical plans for a revision Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy. Each plan must be assessed against two mandatory criteria: a safety constraint related to proximity to critical anatomy (skull base and orbit) and a patency constraint for the newly created frontal sinus neo-ostium. A plan is considered viable only if it satisfies both criteria.\n\n### Validation of the Problem Statement\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Procedure:** Revision unilateral Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy.\n- **Anatomy:** Osteoneogenesis of frontal beak, scarred frontal recess, narrow Frontal Sinus Outflow Tract (FSOT).\n- **Objective:** Minimize risk to skull base and lamina papyracea; optimize creation of a durable neo-ostium.\n- **Global Constraints:**\n    - Minimal vertical clearance to skull base, $d_{sb} = 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Minimal lateral clearance to lamina papyracea, $d_{lp} = 3.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Patency target for neo-ostium cross-sectional area, $A \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n- **Governing Rules:**\n    - Safety Constraint: $r_t + (\\text{combined localization uncertainty}) < \\min(d_{sb}, d_{lp})$.\n    - Assumption: The specified error sources (TRE, segmentation, calibration) are independent.\n- **Option-Specific Data:** Each option (A, B, C, D) provides values for imaging modality, Target Registration Error ($\\sigma_{TRE}$), segmentation uncertainty ($\\sigma_{seg}$), instrument calibration error ($\\sigma_{cal}$), instrument tip radius ($r_t$), and planned elliptical window semi-axes ($a, b$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established principles of image-guided surgery (IGS) for rhinology. The concepts of Target Registration Error (TRE), segmentation uncertainty, and instrument calibration are standard components of IGS error analysis. The defined safety and patency criteria are clinically relevant and quantifiable. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data and explicit constraints to perform a complete analysis. The instruction that error sources are \"independent\" provides the standard and necessary physical assumption for combining them in quadrature (root-sum-square), which is a fundamental principle of error propagation, not a mere \"shortcut formula\". The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and its premises are factually sound and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by systematically applying the specified constraints to each of the four options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nWe will formalize the two criteria to be applied to each option.\n\n**1. Safety Criterion**\nThe minimum clearance distance to a critical structure is $d_{min} = \\min(d_{sb}, d_{lp}) = \\min(2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}, 3.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe combined localization uncertainty, $U_c$, arises from independent error sources. Therefore, their variances add, and the total uncertainty (standard deviation) is the root-sum-square (RSS) of the individual uncertainties:\n$$U_c = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{TRE}^2 + \\sigma_{seg}^2 + \\sigma_{cal}^2}$$\nThe safety criterion is that the sum of the instrument radius and the combined uncertainty must be strictly less than the minimum clearance:\n$$r_t + U_c < 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n**2. Patency Criterion**\nThe neo-ostium is a planned elliptical window with semi-axes $a$ and $b$. Its area is $A = \\pi a b$. This area must meet or exceed the patency target:\n$$\\pi a b \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these two criteria.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Evaluation of Option A**\n- Given data: $\\sigma_{TRE} = 0.9 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{seg} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{cal} = 0.4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $r_t = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 2.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b = 4.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Safety Analysis:**\n  $$U_c = \\sqrt{(0.9)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.4)^2} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{0.81 + 0.09 + 0.16} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{1.06} \\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 1.0296 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  $$r_t + U_c = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1.0296 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2.2296 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  The condition is $2.2296 \\,\\mathrm{mm} < 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is **satisfied**.\n- **Patency Analysis:**\n  $$A = \\pi (2.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm})(4.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 10\\pi \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 31.416 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n  The condition is $31.416 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, which is **not satisfied**.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Option A fails to meet the patency criterion.\n\n**B. Evaluation of Option B**\n- Given data: $\\sigma_{TRE} = 2.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{seg} = 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{cal} = 0.4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $r_t = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 2.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Safety Analysis:**\n  $$U_c = \\sqrt{(2.0)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.4)^2} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{4.0 + 0.25 + 0.16} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{4.41} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  $$r_t + U_c = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm} + 2.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.3 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  The condition is $3.3 \\,\\mathrm{mm} < 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is **not satisfied**.\n- **Patency Analysis:**\n  $$A = \\pi (2.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm})(3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 6\\pi \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 18.850 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n  The condition is $18.850 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, which is **not satisfied**.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Option B fails to meet both the safety and patency criteria. The high TRE associated with surface registration renders this plan unsafe.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Option C**\n- Given data: $\\sigma_{TRE} = 1.6 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{seg} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{cal} = 0.6 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $r_t = 1.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 4.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b = 5.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Safety Analysis:**\n  $$U_c = \\sqrt{(1.6)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.6)^2} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{2.56 + 0.09 + 0.36} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{3.01} \\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 1.7349 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  $$r_t + U_c = 1.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1.7349 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.2349 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  The condition is $3.2349 \\,\\mathrm{mm} < 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is **not satisfied**.\n- **Patency Analysis:**\n  $$A = \\pi (4.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm})(5.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 20\\pi \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 62.832 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n  The condition is $62.832 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, which is **satisfied**.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Option C meets the patency criterion but fails to meet the safety criterion. The large total uncertainty, exacerbated by EM tracking interference and a larger instrument tip, makes the plan unacceptably risky.\n\n**D. Evaluation of Option D**\n- Given data: $\\sigma_{TRE} = 0.7 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{seg} = 0.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\sigma_{cal} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $r_t = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b = 5.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Safety Analysis:**\n  $$U_c = \\sqrt{(0.7)^2 + (0.2)^2 + (0.3)^2} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{0.49 + 0.04 + 0.09} \\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{0.62} \\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.7874 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  $$r_t + U_c = 1.2 \\,\\mathrm{mm} + 0.7874 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.9874 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n  The condition is $1.9874 \\,\\mathrm{mm} < 2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is **satisfied**. This plan offers a substantial safety margin of $2.8 \\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1.9874 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.8126 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Patency Analysis:**\n  $$A = \\pi (3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm})(5.0 \\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 15\\pi \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 47.124 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n  The condition is $47.124 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\ge 35 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, which is **satisfied**.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. Option D is the only plan that satisfies both the safety and patency criteria. Qualitatively, this option represents the highest standard of care by combining high-resolution imaging, gold-standard registration with bone fiducials, and intraoperative updates, which collectively minimize localization uncertainty and maximize the safety margin. It simultaneously plans for a large neo-ostium, optimizing for long-term patency.",
