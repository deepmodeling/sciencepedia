The bithermal caloric test is a foundational tool for this purpose, and this exercise guides you through quantifying the asymmetry in vestibular response using the Jongkees formula. Mastering this calculation  is key to interpreting vestibular function tests and identifying a clear surgical target.",

            "problem": "A patient with intractable unilateral vertigo due to suspected Ménière’s disease is being evaluated for candidacy for vestibular neurectomy. As part of the preoperative assessment, bithermal caloric vestibular testing was performed using warm irrigation at $44^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and cold irrigation at $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The maximal Slow Phase Velocity (SPV) values of the induced nystagmus, measured in degrees per second, are as follows: right warm $=$ $38$, right cold $=$ $30$, left warm $=$ $12$, left cold $=$ $10$. Using the standard Jongkees definition of canal paresis as the normalized right–left difference based on the summed bithermal responses, compute the canal paresis. Express the final canal paresis as a unitless decimal fraction (not as a percent) rounded to four significant figures. Then, briefly interpret whether this magnitude of unilateral weakness is consistent with severe unilateral peripheral hypofunction in a patient being considered for vestibular neurectomy. Your interpretation should be based on commonly used clinical thresholds for unilateral caloric weakness severity classifications in otorhinolaryngology.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of otolaryngology and vestibular science, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the canal paresis (CP) using the data from a bithermal caloric test and the standard Jongkees formula. The secondary task is to interpret this finding in a clinical context.\n\nThe Jongkees formula for canal paresis quantifies the asymmetry between the total vestibular responses of the right and left ears. The total response for each ear is the sum of the maximal Slow Phase Velocity (SPV) values from the warm and cold irrigations. The formula is defined as:\n$$\nCP = \\frac{|(\\text{Total Right Response}) - (\\text{Total Left Response})|}{(\\text{Total Right Response}) + (\\text{Total Left Response})}\n$$\nLet us denote the given SPV values as follows:\n- Right warm response, $RW = 38 \\, \\text{deg/s}$\n- Right cold response, $RC = 30 \\, \\text{deg/s}$\n- Left warm response, $LW = 12 \\, \\text{deg/s}$\n- Left cold response, $LC = 10 \\, \\text{deg/s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total response for the right ear, $R_{total}$, and the left ear, $L_{total}$.\n$$\nR_{total} = RW + RC\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = LW + LC\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nR_{total} = 38 + 30 = 68 \\, \\text{deg/s}\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 12 + 10 = 22 \\, \\text{deg/s}\n$$\nThe ear with the smaller total response, in this case the left ear with a response of $22 \\, \\text{deg/s}$ compared to the right ear's $68 \\, \\text{deg/s}$, is the paretic or hypofunctional ear.\n\nNow, we substitute these total responses into the Jongkees formula for canal paresis:\n$$\nCP = \\frac{|R_{total} - L_{total}|}{R_{total} + L_{total}} = \\frac{|68 - 22|}{68 + 22}\n$$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$\nCP = \\frac{46}{90}\n$$\nTo express this as a unitless decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$\nCP = 0.511111...\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nCP \\approx 0.5111\n$$\n\nFor the interpretation, this canal paresis value is typically expressed as a percentage by multiplying by $100$.\n$$\nCP\\% = 0.5111 \\times 100 = 51.11\\%\n$$\nIn clinical vestibular testing, a canal paresis value greater than $20\\%$ to $25\\%$ is generally considered clinically significant, indicating a unilateral vestibular weakness. The calculated value of $51.11\\%$ is substantially above this threshold. While specific classifications may vary, a weakness of this magnitude is typically categorized as moderate to severe unilateral peripheral hypofunction. For a patient suffering from intractable vertigo suspected to be of unilateral origin (as in Ménière's disease), identifying a significant, well-lateralized vestibular deficit is a critical prerequisite for considering ablative surgical procedures like vestibular neurectomy. Such a procedure aims to eliminate the dysfunctional vestibular signals from the affected ear. Therefore, a finding of $51.11\\%$ canal paresis on the left side is highly consistent with the clinical scenario and strongly supports the consideration of a left-sided vestibular neurectomy. It provides objective evidence that the left vestibular apparatus is the primary source of the pathology.",

            "introduction": "Once a significant unilateral vestibular weakness is identified, the next critical decision involves the choice of surgical procedure, which hinges on the patient's residual hearing function.

            "problem": "A patient with unilateral definite Ménière’s disease presents with intractable vertigo despite maximal medical therapy and vestibular rehabilitation.

The recorded word recognition (speech discrimination) score for phonetically balanced monosyllables in quiet on the same ear is $0.64$ as a fraction.

From first principles, use these definitions to compute the PTA and determine whether the hearing is serviceable, thereby informing candidacy for vestibular neurectomy (which aims to preserve cochlear function) versus labyrinthectomy (which ablates the labyrinth and sacrifices hearing).

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation against the specified criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient condition: Unilateral definite Ménière’s disease with intractable vertigo.\n- Audiometric data for the affected ear:\n  - Air-conduction threshold at $0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$ is $55 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.\n  - Air-conduction threshold at $1 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$ is $50 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.\n  - Air-conduction threshold at $2 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$ is $45 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.\n  - Air-conduction threshold at $3 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$ is $40 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.\n- Speech discrimination data for the affected ear:\n  - Word recognition score (WRS) is $0.64$ as a fraction.\n- Definitions provided within the problem statement:\n  - Pure Tone Average (PTA): The arithmetic mean of the four specified thresholds ($0.5$, $1$, $2$, and $3 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$).\n  - \"Serviceable hearing\": Defined as meeting two concurrent criteria:\n    1.

It utilizes standard concepts and measurements from clinical audiology and otology, such as pure-tone audiometry, decibels hearing level ($\\mathrm{dB~HL}$), word recognition scores, and the calculation of a Pure Tone Average. The clinical scenario—choosing between a hearing-preservation surgery (vestibular neurectomy) and a hearing-sacrificing surgery (labyrinthectomy) based on residual hearing function in a patient with Ménière's disease—is a standard and realistic paradigm in neurotology. The definitions for PTA and \"serviceable hearing\" are explicitly provided, making the problem self-contained and objective, even if clinical guidelines can vary in practice (e.g., the specific frequencies used for PTA or the exact thresholds for serviceable hearing).\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous calculational procedure (arithmetic mean) to find a unique solution for the PTA. The criteria for determining serviceable hearing are also explicitly defined, allowing for a unique logical conclusion.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is objective and free of subjective statements. All criteria are quantitative and explicitly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Pure Tone Average (PTA) from a given set of audiometric thresholds and the subsequent application of a defined rule to classify the patient's hearing status.\n\nLet the hearing thresholds at the specified frequencies be denoted as follows:\n- $T_1 = 55 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$ at the frequency $f_1 = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$\n- $T_2 = 50 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$ at the frequency $f_2 = 1 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$\n- $T_3 = 45 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$ at the frequency $f_3 = 2 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$\n- $T_4 = 40 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$ at the frequency $f_4 = 3 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$\n\nAccording to the problem's explicit definition, the PTA is the arithmetic mean of these four thresholds. The formula for the PTA is:\n$$ \\mathrm{PTA} = \\frac{T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4}{4} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{PTA} = \\frac{55 + 50 + 45 + 40}{4} $$\nThe sum of the thresholds is:\n$$ 55 + 50 + 45 + 40 = 190 $$\nTherefore, the PTA is:\n$$ \\mathrm{PTA} = \\frac{190}{4} = 47.5 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL} $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $47.5$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nNext, we must determine if the hearing is \"serviceable\" based on the two criteria provided.\nLet $PTA_{value}$ be the calculated PTA and $WRS$ be the given word recognition score fraction. The criteria for serviceable hearing are:\n1. $PTA_{value} \\le 50 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$\n2. $WRS \\ge 0.50$\n\nWe check both conditions using the calculated and given data.\n1. For the first condition, we compare our calculated PTA to the threshold:\n   $PTA_{value} = 47.5 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.\n   Is $47.5 \\le 50$? Yes, this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. For the second condition, we examine the given speech discrimination score:\n   $WRS = 0.64$.\n   Is $0.64 \\ge 0.50$? Yes, this condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both criteria are met, the patient's hearing in the affected ear is classified as \"serviceable\" according to the definitions provided in the problem. This finding has direct clinical implications. A vestibular neurectomy is a procedure that aims to preserve existing hearing function by selectively severing the vestibular nerve while leaving the cochlear nerve intact. A labyrinthectomy involves the destruction of the entire inner ear labyrinth, resulting in a total loss of both vestibular and cochlear function on that side. Given that the patient has serviceable hearing, a hearing-preservation procedure like vestibular neurectomy would be strongly indicated over a destructive procedure like labyrinthectomy.\n\nThe problem, however, asks only for the numerical value of the PTA.\n\nThe final calculated PTA is $47.5 \\, \\mathrm{dB~HL}$.",

It is well-posed, objective, complete, and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Asymmetry Metric**\n\nWe need to construct a function $A(G_{\\text{contra}}, G_{\\text{ipsi}})$ that satisfies the four given properties. For notational simplicity, let $x = G_{\\text{contra}}$ and $y = G_{\\text{ipsi}}$. VOR gains are non-negative, so $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\n1.  The simplest mathematical expression that captures asymmetry is the difference, $x-y$. This expression is $0$ when $x=y$ and positive when $x>y$, satisfying properties 1 and 2. However, it is not scale-invariant, since $kx - ky = k(x-y)$, nor is it inherently bounded.\n\n2.  To achieve scale-invariance (property 3), the function must be a function of the ratio $x/y$, or more generally, a ratio of two homogeneous functions of $x$ and $y$ of the same degree. To make the difference $x-y$ scale-invariant, we must normalize it by a quantity that also scales linearly with the gains. The simplest symmetric choice for a normalization denominator is the sum, $x+y$.\n\nLet us propose the following metric, known as the normalized difference or asymmetry index:\n$$A(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x + y}$$\nWe must verify if this functional form satisfies all four required properties.\n\n- **Property 1 (Zero for symmetry):** If $x = y$, and assuming $x+y \\neq 0$:\n$$A(x, x) = \\frac{x - x}{x + x} = \\frac{0}{2x} = 0$$\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 2 (Sign convention):** If $x > y$, then $x-y > 0$. Since VOR gains are non-negative, $x+y \\ge 0$. We assume not both gains are zero post-surgery, so $x+y > 0$. Thus, $A(x, y) = \\frac{x-y}{x+y} > 0$.\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 3 (Scale-invariance):** For any positive scalar $k$:\n$$A(kx, ky) = \\frac{kx-ky}{kx+ky} = \\frac{k(x-y)}{k(x+y)} = \\frac{x-y}{x+y} = A(x,y)$$\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 4 (Bounded magnitude):** We must show that $|A(x, y)| \\le 1$.\n$$ |A(x, y)| = \\left| \\frac{x-y}{x+y} \\right| = \\frac{|x-y|}{x+y} $$\nSince $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, by the triangle inequality, $|x-y| \\le |x| + |y| = x+y$.\nTherefore,\n$$ \\frac{|x-y|}{x+y} \\le \\frac{x+y}{x+y} = 1 $$\nThis shows that $|A(x,y)| \\le 1$. The equality $|A|=1$ occurs if one gain is zero (e.g., if $y=0$, $A = x/x = 1$; if $x=0$, $A = -y/y = -1$).\nThis property is satisfied.\n\nThe constructed metric is:\n$$A(G_{\\text{contra}}, G_{\\text{ipsi}}) = \\frac{G_{\\text{contra}} - G_{\\text{ipsi}}}{G_{\\text{contra}} + G_{\\text{ipsi}}}$$\nThis form is analogous to the Jongkees formula used to calculate canal paresis in caloric testing.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the post-operative VOR gains:\n- Contralateral (unaffected) side: $G_{\\text{contra}} = 0.95$\n- Ipsilateral (operated) side: $G_{\\text{ipsi}} = 0.30$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived metric:\n$$A = \\frac{0.95 - 0.30}{0.95 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.65}{1.25}$$\nTo compute the decimal value:\n$$A = \\frac{65}{125} = \\frac{13 \\times 5}{25 \\times 5} = \\frac{13}{25} = \\frac{52}{100} = 0.52$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$A = 0.5200$$\n\n**Part 3: Clinical Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated asymmetry value is $A = 0.5200$. This indicates a substantial asymmetry between the two vestibular systems. A value of $A=0$ represents perfect symmetry, while a value of $|A|=1$ represents complete loss of function on one side with some function remaining on the other. The value of $0.5200$, which can be expressed as a $52\\%$ asymmetry, is a large deviation from symmetry.\n\nIn the context of vestibular neurectomy for unilateral Ménière disease, the goal of the surgery is to ablate the function of the diseased vestibular nerve (deafferentation). A successful procedure is expected to cause a significant drop in VOR gain on the operated (ipsilateral) side, while the contralateral gain remains normal. The pre-operative gains were symmetric at $0.95$, a normal value. Post-operatively, the contralateral gain remains normal ($0.95$), while the ipsilateral gain has dropped to $0.30$. This pattern is the hallmark of a successful unilateral vestibular ablation.\n\nThe resulting large asymmetry index, $A=0.5200$, quantitatively confirms this clinical picture. It reflects a severe unilateral vestibular hypofunction on the ipsilateral side. In clinical practice, such a marked reduction in ipsilateral gain and the corresponding high asymmetry value are considered evidence of an effective unilateral vestibular deafferentation. Therefore, this magnitude is entirely consistent with the expected outcome of the procedure.",
