To verify that a fitting meets its prescriptive targets, we must measure its performance directly in the patient's ear canal. This practice  guides you through the foundational principles of probe-microphone verification, challenging you to derive the relationship between key metrics like Real-Ear Aided Gain ($REAG$) and Real-Ear Unaided Gain ($REUG$). By calculating the Real-Ear Insertion Gain ($REIG$), you will solidify your understanding of how to quantify the true benefit provided by the hearing aid system.",

            "problem": "A patient with sloping sensorineural hearing loss is fitted with a behind-the-ear hearing aid. Probe-microphone verification is performed in the sound field at a test frequency of $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ using a standardized stimulus. The measurement yields a Real-Ear Aided Gain (REAG) of $25~\\mathrm{dB}$ and a Real-Ear Unaided Gain (REUG) of $15~\\mathrm{dB}$ at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$. The clinic’s prescriptive target for Real-Ear Insertion Gain (REIG) at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ (derived from a validated method independent of this measurement) is $10~\\mathrm{dB}$. Starting from the core definitions of sound pressure level in decibels and the meaning of acoustic gain as a difference of levels measured under the same input, derive the expression for REIG in terms of the measured quantities and compute its value at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$. Express your final numerical answer in decibels (dB). Then, based on your computed value, state whether the $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ target insertion gain is met. The final numeric answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of audiology and acoustics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe core task is to derive the relationship between Real-Ear Insertion Gain (REIG), Real-Ear Aided Gain (REAG), and Real-Ear Unaided Gain (REUG) starting from the fundamental definitions of acoustic gain, and then to compute the value of REIG.\n\nThe definition of Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in decibels ($dB$) is given by:\n$$L = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P}{P_{\\text{ref}}} \\right)$$\nwhere $L$ is the SPL in $dB$, $P$ is the root-mean-square sound pressure, and $P_{\\text{ref}}$ is a standard reference sound pressure (typically $20~\\mu\\text{Pa}$ in air). A key property of this logarithmic scale is that a difference in decibel levels corresponds to a ratio of the underlying physical quantities (e.g., pressures). Gain, when expressed in decibels, is the difference between an output level and an input level.\n\nLet us define the relevant sound pressure levels at the test frequency of $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n1.  Let $L_{\\text{in}}$ be the SPL of the standardized stimulus as measured in the free field at the location of the patient's head.\n2.  Let $L_{\\text{unaided}}$ be the SPL measured by the probe microphone near the tympanic membrane when the ear is unaided.\n3.  Let $L_{\\text{aided}}$ be the SPL measured by the probe microphone near the tympanic membrane when the hearing aid is in place and turned on.\n\nFollowing the problem's directive, we define acoustic gain as the difference of levels measured under the same input stimulus.\n\nThe Real-Ear Unaided Gain (REUG) represents the natural amplification provided by the pinna and ear canal. It is the difference between the SPL at the eardrum and the SPL in the free field.\n$$\\text{REUG} = L_{\\text{unaided}} - L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nThe Real-Ear Aided Gain (REAG) represents the total amplification provided by the hearing aid system combined with the ear's natural acoustics. It is the difference between the SPL at the eardrum with the aid on and the SPL in the free field.\n$$\\text{REAG} = L_{\\text{aided}} - L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nThe Real-Ear Insertion Gain (REIG) is defined as the increase in SPL at the eardrum due to the insertion of the hearing aid. It is the difference between the aided SPL and the unaided SPL at the eardrum. It quantifies the net benefit provided by the hearing aid alone.\n$$\\text{REIG} = L_{\\text{aided}} - L_{\\text{unaided}}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for REIG in terms of the measured quantities REAG and REUG, we rearrange the first two equations:\n$$L_{\\text{aided}} = \\text{REAG} + L_{\\text{in}}$$\n$$L_{\\text{unaided}} = \\text{REUG} + L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the definition of REIG:\n$$\\text{REIG} = (\\text{REAG} + L_{\\text{in}}) - (\\text{REUG} + L_{\\text{in}})$$\nThe input level term, $L_{\\text{in}}$, cancels out:\n$$\\text{REIG} = \\text{REAG} - \\text{REUG}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship between the three gain measures. It shows that the insertion gain is precisely the difference between the aided gain and the unaided gain.\n\nThe problem provides the following measured values at the frequency $f = 2~\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$\\text{REAG} = 25~\\mathrm{dB}$$\n$$\\text{REUG} = 15~\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nUsing the derived formula, we can compute the REIG:\n$$\\text{REIG} = 25~\\mathrm{dB} - 15~\\mathrm{dB} = 10~\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nThe computed Real-Ear Insertion Gain at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ is $10~\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nThe final step is to compare this calculated value to the prescriptive target. The problem states that the target REIG at this frequency is:\n$$\\text{REIG}_{\\text{target}} = 10~\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nSince the calculated value ($10~\\mathrm{dB}$) is equal to the target value ($10~\\mathrm{dB}$), the $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ target insertion gain is met. The final numerical answer for the computed REIG is $10$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond achieving target gain, a successful hearing aid fitting must address patient comfort, particularly the perception of occlusion. Earmold venting is a primary tool for managing this, but it introduces significant acoustic trade-offs. This exercise  asks you to model the vent as a key acoustic component to predict the consequences of altering its dimensions. You will explore how a simple change in vent diameter affects low-frequency gain and simultaneously alters the risk of creating audible feedback, illustrating a fundamental clinical compromise.",

            "problem": "An adult patient with moderate sensorineural hearing loss is fit with a behind-the-ear hearing aid (HA) coupled to a custom earmold. The earmold includes a straight vent of length $L$ that is unchanged at $20$ mm, but its diameter is increased from $1$ mm to $2$ mm to reduce the occlusion effect. Consider the effect of this change on the low-frequency Real Ear Insertion Gain (REIG) and on acoustic feedback risk.\n\nModel the vent acoustically as a short duct whose dominant property at low frequency is its acoustic mass (inertance) $M_v$, with vent impedance $Z_v = j \\omega M_v$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $j$ is the imaginary unit. For a duct of cross-sectional area $A$ and length $L$, $M_v$ scales as $M_v \\propto \\rho L / A$, where $\\rho$ is the air density. Model the residual ear canal and middle ear as a compliance $C_e$ in the low-frequency band, with impedance $Z_e = 1/(j \\omega C_e)$.\n\nAssume the receiver behaves as a volume velocity source driving the parallel combination of the vent ($Z_v$) and ear canal ($Z_e$). Using these first principles, reason about how doubling the vent diameter affects the parallel load seen by the source and the resulting pressure at the tympanic membrane, and thus the low-frequency REIG. Also, assess qualitatively how the altered vent size changes the acoustic coupling between receiver output and the microphone, and hence the likelihood of feedback oscillation.\n\nWhich option best describes the expected changes when the vent diameter is increased from $1$ mm to $2$ mm?\n\nA. Low-frequency REIG decreases by approximately $12~\\mathrm{dB}$; feedback risk increases due to higher acoustic coupling through the vent.\n\nB. Low-frequency REIG increases by approximately $12~\\mathrm{dB}$; feedback risk decreases due to better seal.\n\nC. Low-frequency REIG is largely unchanged (less than $2~\\mathrm{dB}$); feedback risk unchanged.\n\nD. Low-frequency REIG decreases by approximately $6~\\mathrm{dB}$; feedback risk decreases because the larger vent interrupts the feedback path.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the effect of doubling a hearing aid vent's diameter on low-frequency gain and feedback risk. We analyze this using the provided acoustic model.\n\n**1. Effect on Low-Frequency Real-Ear Insertion Gain (REIG):**\nAt low frequencies, the vent is modeled as an acoustic mass (inertance) $M_v$ with impedance $Z_v \\propto M_v$, and the ear canal volume is a compliance with high impedance $Z_e$. The receiver drives these two impedances in parallel. The resulting pressure in the ear canal, $P_e$, is determined by the total parallel impedance $Z_{total}$. Since the vent provides a low-impedance path at these frequencies ($|Z_v| \\ll |Z_e|$), it dominates the parallel combination. Thus, the total impedance is approximately equal to the vent impedance: $Z_{total} \\approx Z_v$. The sound pressure delivered is therefore proportional to the vent impedance, $P_e \\propto Z_v$.\n\nThe vent's acoustic mass scales as $M_v \\propto L/A$, where $L$ is length and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. Since length $L$ is constant, $M_v \\propto 1/A$. The area of the circular vent is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2$, so $A \\propto d^2$. Combining these, the vent impedance is inversely proportional to the square of its diameter: $Z_v \\propto 1/d^2$.\n\nWhen the diameter $d$ is doubled ($d_1 \\to d_2 = 2d_1$), the impedance changes by a factor of $(1/d_2^2) / (1/d_1^2) = (d_1/d_2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nThe change in gain in decibels is calculated as:\n$$\\Delta \\text{Gain} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{e2}}{P_{e1}} \\right) \\approx 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = -20 \\log_{10}(4) \\approx -12~\\mathrm{dB}$$\nTherefore, doubling the vent diameter significantly reduces the low-frequency REIG by approximately $12$ dB.\n\n**2. Effect on Acoustic Feedback Risk:**\nAcoustic feedback occurs when amplified sound from the receiver leaks out of the ear canal and is re-captured by the hearing aid's microphone. The vent is the primary pathway for this acoustic leakage. By increasing the vent diameter from $1$ mm to $2$ mm, the vent becomes a much larger, more open pathway. This increased openness reduces the acoustic impedance of the leak path, allowing more sound energy to escape from the ear canal. This results in stronger acoustic coupling between the hearing aid's output and its input. A higher degree of coupling increases the loop gain of the feedback system, making the hearing aid more likely to oscillate (whistle). Therefore, the risk of feedback increases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIncreasing the vent diameter decreases the low-frequency REIG by approximately $12$ dB and increases the risk of acoustic feedback. This matches option A.",

            "introduction": "The risk of acoustic feedback, introduced by venting or imperfect seals, establishes a hard limit on the usable gain a hearing aid can provide. Understanding this limit is crucial for optimizing a fitting and preventing audible whistling. In this final practice , you will model the hearing aid as a feedback control system and apply the fundamental criterion for oscillation. This will allow you to calculate the maximum stable gain and appreciate the necessity of incorporating a stability margin to ensure the device remains stable during dynamic, real-world conditions like jaw movement.",

            "problem": "A behind-the-ear hearing aid is modeled as a linear time-invariant single-loop feedback system at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ with forward-path acoustic pressure gain $G(\\omega)$ and an acoustic feedback path $B(\\omega)$ from the receiver to the microphone. At $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$, the measured magnitude of the feedback path is $|B(2\\pi \\cdot 2000)| = 0.2$, and the net loop phase is approximately $0$ radians due to the short acoustic path length relative to the wavelength. Assume the ear canal geometry can change with jaw movement, which increases the magnitude of the feedback path by up to $6~\\mathrm{dB}$ at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ without substantially altering the loop phase at that frequency. Using the fundamental oscillation criterion for feedback systems and basic decibel definitions, determine the maximum stable forward-path amplitude gain at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ that ensures the system does not oscillate even under the worst-case jaw movement. Express the final gain in decibels (dB) using the amplitude definition $20\\log_{10}(\\cdot)$, and round your answer to four significant figures. Provide a brief justification for the chosen stability margin based on the oscillation criterion and the specified jaw movement effect.

            "solution": "The hearing aid can be represented by a forward path with amplitude gain $G(\\omega)$ and a feedback path $B(\\omega)$. The open-loop transfer function is $L(\\omega) = G(\\omega)B(\\omega)$. For a linear time-invariant feedback system, the classical Barkhausen oscillation criterion states that sustained oscillation occurs when the loop gain satisfies two conditions at some frequency $\\omega_{0}$: the magnitude condition $|L(\\omega_{0})| = 1$ and the phase condition $\\arg(L(\\omega_{0})) = 2\\pi k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In practice, to avoid oscillation, one designs so that $|L(\\omega)| < 1$ at frequencies where the loop phase is near $0$ radians, because this is where the magnitude condition is most easily met.\n\nAt $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$, the measured magnitude of the feedback path is $|B| = 0.2$, and the loop phase is approximately $0$ radians. Let $G$ denote the forward-path amplitude gain at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$. The open-loop magnitude is then $|L| = G|B|$. To avoid oscillation in the nominal condition (no jaw movement), one requires\n$$\nG|B| < 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad G < \\frac{1}{|B|} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5.\n$$\nHowever, jaw movement can increase the feedback magnitude by up to $6~\\mathrm{dB}$. For amplitude ratios, a change of $6~\\mathrm{dB}$ corresponds to a multiplicative factor\n$$\ns = 10^{\\frac{6}{20}} = 10^{0.3}.\n$$\nUnder this worst-case condition, the feedback magnitude becomes $|B|_{\\mathrm{jaw}} = s|B| = 10^{0.3} \\cdot 0.2$.

The specified jaw movement increases the feedback magnitude by $6~\\mathrm{dB}$ (amplitude factor $10^{0.3}$), so ensuring $G \\cdot |B| \\cdot 10^{0.3} < 1$ at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ guarantees that the unity-magnitude condition is not met even under worst-case anatomical changes, thereby avoiding oscillation. Because the loop phase at $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$ is approximately $0$ radians and this phase is not substantially altered by the jaw movement in this scenario, the amplitude margin directly translates to robust non-oscillatory behavior at the target frequency.",
