This practice focuses on this exact scenario, where you will model patient performance using a psychometric function .

            "problem": "A 62-year-old patient with bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss is being evaluated for Cochlear Implant (CI) candidacy. With optimized bilateral hearing aids, sentence recognition in stationary speech-shaped noise was measured across signal-to-noise ratios. The psychometric relationship between Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the proportion of correct responses is assumed to follow the standard logistic form with unknown parameters, mapping an SNR value $S$ (in $\\mathrm{dB}$) to a correctness probability $P(S)$ that increases monotonically from $0$ to $1$ as $S$ increases. The testing protocol indicates negligible lapse and guess rates, and the empirical local slope at $P=0.5$ is $0.06$ correctness fraction per $\\mathrm{dB}$. In repeated measurements, the patient achieved $P=0.8$ at $S=12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nUsing the definitions of the logistic psychometric function and the derivative as the slope of the function, compute the SNR at $50\\%$ correct, denoted $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$, in $\\mathrm{dB}$.

Then, briefly interpret the implications of the computed $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$ relative to an operational benchmark for candidacy in which $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50 > 7.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ with optimized hearing aids is considered supportive of CI candidacy due to poor aided speech-in-noise performance. Express the final $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$ in $\\mathrm{dB}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in psychophysics, mathematically well-posed, and objective. It provides sufficient information to determine the parameters of a standard psychometric function and answer the question. The context is directly relevant to the clinical assessment of cochlear implant candidacy.\n\nThe relationship between the Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($S$, in $\\mathrm{dB}$) and the probability of a correct response ($P(S)$) is described by a standard logistic function. Given that the problem states negligible lapse and guess rates, the function has a lower asymptote of $0$ and an upper asymptote of $1$. The mathematical form of this function is:\n$$P(S) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(S - \\alpha))}$$\nIn this equation, $\\alpha$ represents the stimulus level ($S$) at which the performance is halfway between the floor and ceiling, which for this function is $P(\\alpha) = 0.5$. This parameter $\\alpha$ corresponds directly to the quantity we are asked to find, $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$. The parameter $k$ determines the steepness of the function. Our goal is to find the value of $\\alpha$.\n\nWe are provided with two pieces of information to determine the two unknown parameters, $\\alpha$ and $k$.\n\nFirst, we are given that the empirical local slope at $P=0.5$ is $0.06$ correctness fraction per $\\mathrm{dB}$. The slope of the psychometric function is its first derivative with respect to $S$, which we denote as $P'(S)$. We can find the derivative of $P(S)$ using the chain rule. A more direct method utilizes the property that the derivative of the logistic function is $P'(S) = k \\cdot P(S) \\cdot (1 - P(S))$.\n\nThe point where $P(S) = 0.5$ occurs at $S = \\alpha$, since:\n$$P(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(\\alpha - \\alpha))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = 0.5$$\nWe can now evaluate the slope at this point:\n$$P'(\\alpha) = k \\cdot P(\\alpha) \\cdot (1 - P(\\alpha)) = k \\cdot (0.5) \\cdot (1 - 0.5) = k \\cdot (0.5) \\cdot (0.5) = \\frac{k}{4}$$\nThe problem states that this slope is $0.06\\,\\mathrm{dB}^{-1}$. Therefore, we can solve for $k$:\n$$\\frac{k}{4} = 0.06$$\n$$k = 4 \\times 0.06 = 0.24$$\nThe steepness parameter is $k = 0.24\\,\\mathrm{dB}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, we are given that the patient achieved a performance of $P=0.8$ at an SNR of $S=12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. We can substitute these values, along with the now-known value of $k$, into the logistic function equation:\n$$0.8 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.24(12 - \\alpha))}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$1 + \\exp(-0.24(12 - \\alpha)) = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n$$\\exp(-0.24(12 - \\alpha)) = 1.25 - 1 = 0.25$$\nTo isolate the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-0.24(12 - \\alpha))) = \\ln(0.25)$$\n$$-0.24(12 - \\alpha) = \\ln(0.25)$$\nRecognizing that $\\ln(0.25) = \\ln(1/4) = -\\ln(4)$:\n$$-0.24(12 - \\alpha) = -\\ln(4)$$\n$$0.24(12 - \\alpha) = \\ln(4)$$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$12 - \\alpha = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{0.24}$$\n$$\\alpha = 12 - \\frac{\\ln(4)}{0.24}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(4) \\approx 1.386294$:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 12 - \\frac{1.386294}{0.24} \\approx 12 - 5.776225 \\approx 6.223775$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$\\alpha = \\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50 \\approx 6.22\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nThe problem also asks for a brief interpretation of this result. The computed $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$ for the patient is $6.22\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. The operational benchmark for considering a patient a candidate for a cochlear implant due to poor aided speech-in-noise performance is $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50 > 7.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. Since the patient's measured value of $6.22\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ is less than the benchmark of $7.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, their performance with optimized hearing aids is considered better than the threshold for CI candidacy based on this specific measure. A lower $\\mathrm{SNR}\\text{-}50$ indicates better performance, as the patient can achieve $50\\%$ sentence recognition in a more challenging (lower SNR) noise condition. Therefore, this finding, in isolation, would not support proceeding with cochlear implantation.",
