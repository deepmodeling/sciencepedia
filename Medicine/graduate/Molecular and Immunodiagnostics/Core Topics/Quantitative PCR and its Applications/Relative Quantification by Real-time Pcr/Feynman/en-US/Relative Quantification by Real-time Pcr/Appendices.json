            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is stated objectively. The assumptions of $100\\%$ and equal amplification efficiency are standard for introducing this method of analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle of qPCR is that the amount of DNA amplicon, $N_C$, after $C$ cycles of amplification is related to the initial quantity of template, $N_0$, by the equation:\n$$N_C = N_0 \\times (1 + E)^C$$\nwhere $E$ is the amplification efficiency. The problem states that the efficiency is $100\\%$, which means $E = 1$. The amount of product exactly doubles with each cycle. The amplification factor per cycle is therefore $1+E = 2$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$N_C = N_0 \\times 2^C$$\n\nThe quantification cycle, $C_q$, is the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal, which is proportional to the amount of amplicon, crosses a fixed detection threshold. Let the amount of amplicon corresponding to this threshold be $N_{th}$. Therefore, at $C=C_q$, we have:\n$$N_{th} = N_0 \\times 2^{C_q}$$\n\nTo determine the initial quantity of template, $N_0$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$N_0 = N_{th} \\times 2^{-C_q}$$\nSince the detection threshold is constant for all reactions, $N_{th}$ is a constant. Thus, the initial quantity of a template is inversely proportional to $2$ raised to the power of its $C_q$ value:\n$$N_0 \\propto 2^{-C_q}$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a normalized fold change. The normalization procedure is explicitly defined as dividing the target's inferred initial quantity by that of the reference gene within each condition (sample and calibrator).\n\nFirst, we calculate the normalized abundance for the experimental sample. Let $R_{\\text{sample}}$ be this value.\n$$R_{\\text{sample}} = \\frac{N_{0, \\text{target}}(\\text{sample})}{N_{0, \\text{ref}}(\\text{sample})}$$\nUsing the relationship $N_0 \\propto 2^{-C_q}$, we can write:\n$$R_{\\text{sample}} = \\frac{k \\times 2^{-C_{q,\\text{target}}(\\text{sample})}}{k \\times 2^{-C_{q,\\text{ref}}(\\text{sample})}} = 2^{-(C_{q,\\text{target}}(\\text{sample}) - C_{q,\\text{ref}}(\\text{sample}))}$$\nHere, $k$ is the proportionality constant which cancels out.

Let $R_{\\text{cal}}$ be the normalized abundance for the calibrator.\n$$R_{\\text{cal}} = \\frac{N_{0, \\text{target}}(\\text{cal})}{N_{0, \\text{ref}}(\\text{cal})} = 2^{-(C_{q,\\text{target}}(\\text{cal}) - C_{q,\\text{ref}}(\\text{cal}))}$$\nLet's define the delta-Cq for the calibrator as $\\Delta C_{q,\\text{cal}}$:\n$$\\Delta C_{q,\\text{cal}} = C_{q,\\text{target}}(\\text{cal}) - C_{q,\\text{ref}}(\\text{cal})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta C_{q,\\text{cal}} = 24.0 - 18.5 = 5.5$$\nSo, the normalized abundance for the calibrator is proportional to $2^{-5.5}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the normalized fold change in target abundance of the sample relative to the calibrator.
