The flow cytometer is calibrated to deliver a volumetric flow rate of $50\\,\\mu\\text{L}/\\text{min}$ with a stated relative standard uncertainty of $\\pm 2\\%$. A suspension of mammalian cells stained with a viability dye is acquired for $180\\,\\text{s}$ under steady flow. Standard singlet gating and viability gating are applied to exclude debris, doublets, and non-viable events, yielding a total of $75{,}000$ viable single-cell events recorded during the acquisition. Assume the sample is well-mixed, instrument dead time is negligible, and the acquisition time is exact relative to other uncertainties.\n\nStarting from the definitions of volumetric flow rate $Q$ as $Q = \\frac{dV}{dt}$, concentration $c$ as the ratio of counted cells to the analyzed volume, and the well-tested fact that event counts in flow cytometry satisfy Poisson statistics for independent events with variance equal to the mean, derive the viable cell concentration and the propagated relative uncertainty for $c$ under the assumption that uncertainties in $Q$ and in the count $N$ are independent. Treat the flow calibration uncertainty as a relative standard uncertainty on $Q$ and the counting uncertainty as arising from Poisson statistics. Express the final concentration in $\\text{cells}/\\text{mL}$ and the relative uncertainty as a decimal fraction. Round both results to $3$ significant figures.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of flow cytometry and statistical error analysis, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The parameters given—volumetric flow rate, acquisition time, and cell counts—are realistic for a standard laboratory experiment. The problem is a formalizable exercise in calculating a physical quantity and its associated measurement uncertainty.\n\nThe objective is to determine the viable cell concentration, $c$, and its propagated relative standard uncertainty, $u_r(c)$.\n\nThe concentration $c$ is defined as the number of cells $N$ per unit volume $V$:\n$$c = \\frac{N}{V}$$\nThe volume of the sample analyzed, $V$, is determined by the constant volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and the acquisition time, $t$.

The concentration $c$ is a function of $N$, $Q$, and $t$. Assuming the uncertainties in these variables are independent, the square of the combined relative standard uncertainty, $u_r(c)^2$, is the sum of the squares of the individual relative standard uncertainties, weighted by the exponent of each variable in the formula for $c$.\nFor $c = N^1 Q^{-1} t^{-1}$, the general formula for propagation of relative uncertainty is:\n$$u_r(c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{u(c)}{c}\\right)^2 = (1)^2 \\left(\\frac{u(N)}{N}\\right)^2 + (-1)^2 \\left(\\frac{u(Q)}{Q}\\right)^2 + (-1)^2 \\left(\\frac{u(t)}{t}\\right)^2$$\n$$u_r(c)^2 = u_r(N)^2 + u_r(Q)^2 + u_r(t)^2$$\nWe evaluate each term:\n1.  **Uncertainty in cell count $N$**: The problem states that counts $N$ follow Poisson statistics, for which the variance is equal to the mean. The best estimate of the mean is the count itself, $N$. The standard uncertainty $u(N)$ is the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance: $u(N) = \\sqrt{N}$. Therefore, the relative standard uncertainty in the count is:\n    $$u_r(N) = \\frac{u(N)}{N} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{N} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\n    Substituting $N = 75{,}000$:\n    $$u_r(N)^2 = \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{1}{75{,}000}$$\n2.  **Uncertainty in flow rate $Q$**: The relative standard uncertainty is given as $u_r(Q) = 2\\% = 0.02$.\n3.  **Uncertainty in time $t$**: The problem states to assume the acquisition time is exact, which implies its uncertainty is zero: $u(t) = 0$, and thus $u_r(t) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the propagation formula:\n$$u_r(c)^2 = \\frac{1}{75{,}000} + (0.02)^2 + 0$$\n$$u_r(c)^2 = 0.00001333\\dots + 0.0004 = 0.00041333\\dots$$\nThe relative standard uncertainty $u_r(c)$ is the square root of this value:\n$$u_r(c) = \\sqrt{0.00041333\\dots} \\approx 0.0203306$$\nRounding this result to $3$ significant figures gives $0.0203$.\n\nThe final results are a viable cell concentration of $5.00 \\times 10^5 \\text{cells}/\\text{mL}$ and a combined relative uncertainty of $0.0203$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a realistic scenario in cell biology and bioprocess engineering, providing sufficient and consistent data for a formal analysis based on first principles of fluid mechanics and flow cytometry. The assumptions of laminar, fully developed Newtonian flow are appropriate for the given parameters, as confirmed by a Reynolds number calculation for the worst-case scenario (small-bore, fast dispense), which yields $Re \\ll 2300$.\n\nThe solution requires a three-part analysis: (i) determining the experimental comparison that maximizes shear contrast, (ii) assessing the scientific validity of the proposed flow cytometry analysis plan, and (iii) predicting the correct order of cell damage across conditions based on a first-principles derivation of shear stress.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Shear Stress from First Principles**\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation starting from fundamental definitions. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau$ is defined by the relationship $\\tau = \\mu \\left| \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{du}{dr}$ is the velocity gradient in the radial direction $r$.\n\nFor steady, fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe of radius $R$ (Hagen-Poiseuille flow), the velocity profile is parabolic:\n$$u(r) = u_{max} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right)$$\nwhere $u_{max}$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline ($r=0$).\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is given by the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A = \\pi R^2$. The average velocity $\\bar{u}$ is related to the maximum velocity by $\\bar{u} = \\frac{1}{2} u_{max}$. The flow rate is also defined by the total volume $V$ dispensed over time $t$:\n$$Q = A \\bar{u} = (\\pi R^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} u_{max}\\right) = \\frac{V}{t}$$\nFrom this, we can express the maximum velocity in terms of the experimental parameters:\n$$u_{max} = \\frac{2Q}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{2V}{\\pi R^2 t}$$\nNext, we find the velocity gradient by differentiating the velocity profile $u(r)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ u_{max} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right] = u_{max} \\left( -\\frac{2r}{R^2} \\right)$$\nThe shear stress $\\tau(r)$ at any radial position $r$ is then:\n$$\\tau(r) = \\mu \\left| \\frac{du}{dr} \\right| = \\mu u_{max} \\frac{2r}{R^2}$$\nCell damage is primarily caused by the maximum shear stress, which occurs at the wall of the pipette tip, where $r=R$. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is:\n$$\\tau_w = \\tau(R) = \\mu u_{max} \\frac{2R}{R^2} = \\frac{2 \\mu u_{max}}{R}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $u_{max}$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{2\\mu}{R} \\left( \\frac{2V}{\\pi R^2 t} \\right) = \\frac{4\\mu V}{\\pi R^3 t}$$\nThis final expression shows that the wall shear stress is inversely proportional to the cube of the radius ($R^3$) and inversely proportional to the dispense time ($t$).\n\n**Part 2: Prediction of PI-Positive Fraction Ordering**\nWe assume that the fraction of PI-positive (non-viable) cells increases with the magnitude of the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. We need to rank $\\tau_w$ for the four conditions:\n1.  Small-bore fast ($R_1, t_f$): $\\tau_{w,1f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_f}$\n2.  Small-bore slow ($R_1, t_s$): $\\tau_{w,1s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_s}$\n3.  Large-bore fast ($R_2, t_f$): $\\tau_{w,2f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_2^3 t_f}$\n4.  Large-bore slow ($R_2, t_s$): $\\tau_{w,2s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_2^3 t_s}$\n\nGiven data: $R_1 = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $R_2 = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2R_1$, $t_f = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $t_s = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{s} = 4t_f$.\nLet's find the relative magnitudes. Let the relative shear for the lowest-stress condition ($R_2, t_s$) be $1$.\n- $\\tau_{w,2s} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2R_1)^3 (4t_f)} = \\frac{1}{32 R_1^3 t_f}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,2f} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2R_1)^3 t_f} = \\frac{1}{8 R_1^3 t_f} = 4 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,1s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 (4t_f)} = \\frac{1}{4 R_1^3 t_f} = 8 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,1f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_f} = 32 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n\nThus, the ordering of wall shear stress from highest to lowest is:\n$\\tau_{w,1f} > \\tau_{w,1s} > \\tau_{w,2f} > \\tau_{w,2s}$.\nThe predicted order of PI-positive fractions is therefore: small-bore fast > small-bore slow > large-bore fast > large-bore slow.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\n**Option A**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_f$ versus $R_2, t_f$. This comparison is performed at a fixed residence (dispense) time $t_f$. The contrast in shear stress is the ratio $\\tau_{w,1f}/\\tau_{w,2f} = (R_2/R_1)^3 = 2^3 = 8$. A comparison at fixed radius (e.g., $R_1, t_f$ vs $R_1, t_s$) would yield a contrast of $t_s/t_f = 4$. Therefore, comparing different radii at a fixed time maximizes the shear contrast. This criterion is satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is excellent. It specifies a sufficient number of events ($N=20{,}000$), use of counting beads for normalization, essential gating steps (debris exclusion via FSC/SSC, singlets), and the use of proper live/dead controls to set PI gates. Furthermore, it suggests advanced quantification methods (medians, IQRs, mixture modeling) that are appropriate for analyzing fluorescence distributions. This plan is scientifically rigorous. This criterion is satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted order of PI-positive fractions is $R_1, t_f > R_1, t_s > R_2, t_f > R_2, t_s$. This exactly matches the order derived from first principles. This criterion is satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_f$ versus $R_1, t_s$. As shown above, this yields a shear contrast of $4$, which is not maximal. The maximal contrast is $8$. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is deeply flawed. It suggests assessing viability by mean Forward Scatter (FSC), which is a measure of cell size, not membrane integrity. Dying cells can either shrink or swell, making FSC an unreliable and indirect marker for viability compared to PI. It also advises skipping doublet discrimination, a critical step for accurate flow cytometry analysis. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_2, t_f > R_1, t_f > R_1, t_s > R_2, t_s$. This incorrectly suggests that the large-bore fast condition is more damaging than the small-bore fast condition, contradicting the $\\tau_w \\propto 1/R^3$ relationship. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_s$ against $R_2, t_f$ with the claim of holding shear \"approximately constant\". As calculated from our ratios, $\\tau_{w,1s}$ is twice as large as $\\tau_{w,2f}$ ($8$ vs $4$ relative units). A factor of $2$ is not \"approximately constant\". Furthermore, the goal is to maximize contrast, not hold it constant. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is poor. It omits essential live/dead controls for setting gates and relies on an arbitrary \"manufacturer-recommended threshold\", which ignores instrument variability and cell autofluorescence. This is not a robust method. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_1, t_s > R_2, t_f > R_1, t_f > R_2, t_s$. This is incorrect; for example, it claims the small-bore slow condition is more damaging than the small-bore fast condition, contradicting the $\\tau_w \\propto 1/t$ relationship. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_2, t_f$ versus $R_2, t_s$. This yields a shear contrast of $4$, which is not maximal. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is flawed. It substitutes PI with Calcein-AM, which measures a different aspect of cell health (esterase activity in live cells) and was not the specified assay. It also advises omitting debris gating, which will contaminate the analysis with non-cellular events and lead to incorrect quantification. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_1, t_f > R_2, t_f > R_1, t_s > R_2, t_s$. This incorrectly swaps the order of the small-bore slow ($R_1, t_s$) and large-bore fast ($R_2, t_f$) conditions. As calculated, $\\tau_{w,1s} = 2 \\tau_{w,2f}$, so the small-bore slow condition has higher shear. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, only Option A correctly satisfies all three criteria: it proposes an experimental design that maximizes shear stress contrast, outlines a scientifically rigorous analysis protocol, and correctly predicts the ordering of cell damage based on a first-principles physical model.",
