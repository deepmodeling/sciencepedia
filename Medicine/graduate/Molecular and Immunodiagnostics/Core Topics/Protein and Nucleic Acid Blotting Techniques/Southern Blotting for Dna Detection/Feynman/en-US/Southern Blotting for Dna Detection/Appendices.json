The measured absorbances are $A_{260} = 0.25$ and $A_{280} = 0.12$. Starting from the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon b c$, and the well-established spectroscopic fact that nucleic acid bases absorb maximally near $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ whereas aromatic amino acid residues in proteins absorb maximally near $280~\\mathrm{nm}$, compute the purity index $A_{260}/A_{280}$ and, based on first principles, reason whether protein contamination is likely to impair restriction endonuclease digestion and capillary transfer during Southern blotting of this sample.\n\nReport the numerical value of $A_{260}/A_{280}$ rounded to four significant figures. The purity index is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, and therefore is deemed valid. The solution requires a two-part response: a quantitative calculation of a purity index and a qualitative-reasoning based on established biophysical principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Purity Index**\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the purity index, which is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ to the absorbance at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Absorbance at $260~\\mathrm{nm}$: $A_{260} = 0.25$\n- Absorbance at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$: $A_{280} = 0.12$\n\nThe purity index, denoted here as $R$, is calculated as follows:\n$$ R = \\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the expression:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.25}{0.12} \\approx 2.08333... $$\nThe problem explicitly requests that this value be reported rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 2.083 $$\n\n**Part 2: Reasoning on the Impact of Protein Contamination**\n\nThe evaluation of the sample's suitability for downstream enzymatic and physical processes is based on the interpretation of this purity index, rooted in the principles of spectrophotometry as described by the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon b c$. Here, $A$ is absorbance, $\\varepsilon$ is the molar extinction coefficient, $b$ is the pathlength (given as $1~\\mathrm{cm}$), and $c$ is the concentration of the absorbing species.\n\nFor a mixed sample containing both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein (P), the total absorbance at a given wavelength ($\\lambda$) is the sum of the contributions from each component:\n$$ A_{\\lambda} = A_{\\lambda, \\text{DNA}} + A_{\\lambda, \\text{P}} $$\nUsing the Beer–Lambert law, this can be written as:\n$$ A_{\\lambda} = (\\varepsilon_{\\lambda, \\text{DNA}} c_{\\text{DNA}} + \\varepsilon_{\\lambda, \\text{P}} c_{\\text{P}}) b $$\nThe utility of the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio stems from the differing spectral properties of nucleic acids and proteins:\n1.  Nucleic acids exhibit a strong absorbance maximum around $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ due to the electronic structure of their purine and pyrimidine bases.\n2.  Proteins exhibit an absorbance maximum around $280~\\mathrm{nm}$ due to the presence of aromatic amino acid residues (primarily tryptophan and tyrosine).\n\nBased on these properties, the following benchmark ratios are established:\n- For pure double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the accepted theoretical ratio is $\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} \\approx 1.8$.\n- For pure protein, the ratio is typically in the range of $\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} \\approx 0.57$.\n\nIf a DNA sample is contaminated with protein, the protein's absorbance contribution is greater at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$ than at $260~\\mathrm{nm}$. This disproportionately increases the denominator of the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio, causing the value to decrease below the ideal of $1.8$. Therefore, a ratio significantly less than $1.8$ is a robust indicator of protein contamination.\n\nThe calculated purity index for the sample is $\\approx 2.083$. This value is substantially *higher* than $1.8$. This indicates that there is no significant protein contamination in the sample. A ratio of approximately $2.0$ is characteristic of pure ribonucleic acid (RNA), so the high value may suggest some RNA is present, but it effectively rules out protein as a major contaminant.\n\nGiven this conclusion, we can address the question of whether protein contamination is likely to impair subsequent steps in the Southern blotting protocol:\n\n- **Restriction Endonuclease Digestion:** This is an enzymatic process where restriction enzymes cleave DNA at specific recognition sites. If significant protein contamination were present (which it is not), it could inhibit this process. Potential inhibitory proteins include co-purified nucleases that degrade the DNA sample or other DNA-binding proteins that sterically block the restriction sites, preventing enzyme access. Since the spectrophotometric data indicate high purity from protein, such inhibition is not expected.\n\n- **Capillary Transfer:** This is the physical process of transferring DNA fragments from the electrophoresis gel to a solid support membrane. A high concentration of precipitated protein contaminants could clog the pores of the gel and/or the membrane, leading to inefficient and non-uniform transfer. The high purity index of the sample indicates that this is not a concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the spectrophotometric analysis yields a purity index of $\\approx 2.083$. This value is greater than the benchmark of $1.8$ for pure dsDNA, which signifies that the sample is substantially free from protein contamination. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that protein contamination will impair the critical steps of restriction endonuclease digestion and capillary transfer during the Southern blotting procedure for this sample.",

            "problem": "A $10$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ genomic region is interrogated by Southern blotting after complete digestion with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI. Assume EcoRI recognizes the sequence $5'$-GAATTC-$3'$ and cleaves precisely at its cognate sites throughout the genome, with no partial digestion and no methylation sensitivity in this locus. The region of interest extends from coordinate $0$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ on a one-dimensional map. The nearest invariant flanking EcoRI sites outside this region are located $2$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ upstream of $0$ (i.e., at coordinate $-2$ $\\mathrm{kb}$) and $3$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ downstream of $10$ (i.e., at coordinate $13$ $\\mathrm{kb}$). In the wild-type allele, there is an internal EcoRI site located at coordinate $x=6$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ within the $10$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ region. In the mutant allele, a single-nucleotide variation abolishes this internal EcoRI site, leaving no EcoRI sites within the $10$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ region.\n\nA single-copy deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe of length $1$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ hybridizes uniquely and entirely within the region spanning coordinates $7.5$ to $8.5$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ on this map. After agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and capillary transfer, a Southern blot (SB) is performed with this probe.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of restriction digestion, fragment formation, and hybridization specificity, compute:\n- the exact fragment sizes (in kilobases) generated from this locus for the wild-type allele on the gel,\n- the exact fragment size (in kilobases) generated from this locus for the mutant allele on the gel,\n- the exact fragment sizes (in kilobases) that will hybridize to the probe on the blot for the wild-type and mutant alleles,\n- the number of discrete probe-hybridizing bands on the blot for the homozygous wild-type, homozygous mutant, and heterozygous genotypes, respectively.\n\nExpress all fragment sizes in kilobases.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is free of ambiguities or contradictions.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically analyzing the restriction fragment patterns for the wild-type and mutant alleles and then determining which fragments are detected by the specified probe.\n\nFirst, we define the locations of the EcoRI restriction sites for each allele. The coordinates are given in kilobases ($\\mathrm{kb}$).\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) allele, the problem states there are three relevant EcoRI sites:\n$1$. An invariant flanking site at coordinate $-2$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$2$. An internal site at coordinate $6$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$3$. An invariant flanking site at coordinate $13$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nComplete digestion with EcoRI will cleave the DNA at all these sites, generating distinct fragments. The lengths of these fragments are calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of adjacent restriction sites.\nThe fragment to the left of the internal site spans from coordinate $-2$ to $6$. Its length, $L_{\\text{wt,gel,left}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\text{wt,gel,left}} = 6 - (-2) = 8 \\text{ kb}$$\nThe fragment to the right of the internal site spans from coordinate $6$ to $13$. Its length, $L_{\\text{wt,gel,right}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\text{wt,gel,right}} = 13 - 6 = 7 \\text{ kb}$$\nThese two fragments, of sizes $8$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ and $7$ $\\mathrm{kb}$, are the fragments generated from this locus in the wild-type allele that would be visible on an agarose gel if all DNA were stained.\n\nFor the mutant (MUT) allele, the single-nucleotide variation abolishes the internal EcoRI site at coordinate $6$ $\\mathrm{kb}$. Therefore, the only relevant EcoRI sites are the flanking ones:\n$1$. The site at coordinate $-2$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$2$. The site at coordinate $13$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nComplete digestion will generate a single large fragment spanning between these two sites. Its length, $L_{\\text{mut,gel}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\text{mut,gel}} = 13 - (-2) = 15 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nNext, we determine which of these fragments will be detected by the DNA probe in a Southern blot. The probe is a $1$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ DNA segment that hybridizes to the unique region spanning coordinates $7.5$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ to $8.5$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nFor the wild-type allele, we have two fragments: $[ -2, 6 ]$ and $[ 6, 13 ]$. The probe's hybridization interval, $[ 7.5, 8.5 ]$, falls entirely within the second fragment, which spans from coordinate $6$ to $13$. The length of this fragment is $7$ $\\mathrm{kb}$. Therefore, the fragment size detected on the blot for the wild-type allele, $L_{\\text{wt,blot}}$, is $7$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$$L_{\\text{wt,blot}} = 7 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nFor the mutant allele, there is only one fragment, spanning from coordinate $-2$ to $13$. The probe's hybridization interval, $[ 7.5, 8.5 ]$, is contained within this single large fragment. The length of this fragment is $15$ $\\mathrm{kb}$. Therefore, the fragment size detected on the blot for the mutant allele, $L_{\\text{mut,blot}}$, is $15$ $\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$$L_{\\text{mut,blot}} = 15 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nFinally, we determine the number of bands visible on the Southern blot for different genotypes. A band appears for each unique size of probe-hybridizing fragment.\n\nFor a homozygous wild-type (WT/WT) individual, both chromosomes carry the wild-type allele. Both will produce a $7$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ fragment that hybridizes with the probe. Since both fragments are identical in size, they will migrate to the same position on the gel, resulting in a single band. Thus, the number of bands, $N_{\\text{wt,blot}}$, is $1$.\n$$N_{\\text{wt,blot}} = 1$$\n\nFor a homozygous mutant (MUT/MUT) individual, both chromosomes carry the mutant allele. Both will produce a $15$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ fragment that hybridizes with the probe. This results in a single band on the blot. Thus, the number of bands, $N_{\\text{mut,blot}}$, is $1$.\n$$N_{\\text{mut,blot}} = 1$$\n\nFor a heterozygous (WT/MUT) individual, one chromosome has the wild-type allele and the other has the mutant allele. The wild-type allele contributes a $7$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ hybridizing fragment, and the mutant allele contributes a $15$ $\\mathrm{kb}$ hybridizing fragment. Since these fragments are of different sizes, they will separate during electrophoresis and appear as two distinct bands on the Southern blot. Thus, the number of bands, $N_{\\text{het,blot}}$, is $2$.\n$$N_{\\text{het,blot}} = 2$$\n\nWe can now assemble the final answer in the specified matrix format:\n$(L_{\\text{wt,gel,left}}, L_{\\text{wt,gel,right}}, L_{\\text{mut,gel}}, L_{\\text{wt,blot}}, L_{\\text{mut,blot}}, N_{\\text{wt,blot}}, N_{\\text{mut,blot}}, N_{\\text{het,blot}})$.\nSubstituting the calculated values, we get:\n$(8, 7, 15, 7, 15, 1, 1, 2)$.",
