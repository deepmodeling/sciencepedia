            "problem": "A microplate chemiluminescent immunoassay for a low-abundance glycoprotein is developed in two configurations: direct immunoassay (enzyme-labeled primary antibody binds the analyte) and indirect immunoassay (unlabeled primary antibody binds the analyte and an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody binds the primary antibody). In both configurations, the blank wells are prepared identically (no analyte, same blocking and wash conditions). The blank signal arises from instrument readout noise and non-specific binding and is modeled as a Gaussian-distributed random variable with mean $\\mu_b$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_b$.\n\nBased on first principles, define the Limit of Detection (LOD) as the lowest measured signal that can be statistically distinguished from the blank at a fixed one-sided false-positive risk determined by a threshold measured in standard deviations above the blank mean, and define the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) as the lowest measured signal at which the measurement precision attains an acceptable level characterized by a substantially larger signal-to-noise threshold. Adopt conventional immunoassay practice in which the detection threshold corresponds to three standard deviations above the blank mean and the quantification threshold corresponds to ten standard deviations above the blank mean.\n\nBlank replicate sets are collected for each configuration with the following sample statistics:\n- Direct configuration: $n_d=24$, $\\mu_{b,d}=38.6$ Relative Light Units (RLU), $\\sigma_{b,d}=3.2$ RLU.\n- Indirect configuration: $n_i=24$, $\\mu_{b,i}=41.9$ RLU, $\\sigma_{b,i}=4.5$ RLU.\n\nStarting from the Gaussian noise model and the above definitions, derive expressions for the LOD and LOQ in terms of $\\mu_b$ and $\\sigma_b$ and use them to compute the numerical values for both configurations.

            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded in the principles of analytical chemistry and immunodiagnostics, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe blank signal, denoted as $S_b$, is modeled as a random variable following a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a mean $\\mu_b$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_b$. This is represented as $S_b \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_b, \\sigma_b^2)$.\n\nThe Limit of Detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest measured signal that can be statistically distinguished from the blank signal. The problem specifies that this threshold is set at three standard deviations above the mean of the blank signal. This corresponds to a specific, low probability of a false positive, where a blank sample would yield a signal at or above the LOD. Based on this definition, the analytical expression for the LOD is:\n$$\nLOD = \\mu_b + 3 \\sigma_b\n$$\n\nThe Limit of Quantification (LOQ), sometimes called the Limit of Quantitation, is defined as the lowest signal level at which the analyte can be reliably and precisely quantified. The problem specifies a more stringent criterion for the LOQ, setting the threshold at ten standard deviations above the mean of the blank signal. This ensures a high signal-to-noise ratio for quantitative measurements. The analytical expression for the LOQ is therefore:\n$$\nLOQ = \\mu_b + 10 \\sigma_b\n$$\nThis definition is consistent with requiring the net signal intensity ($LOQ - \\mu_b$) to be $10$ times the noise level ($\\sigma_b$), yielding a signal-to-noise ratio of $10$.\n\nWe are given the sample statistics for two immunoassay configurations: direct and indirect.

            "problem": "An indirect immunoassay is configured on a microplate where antigen is immobilized to the solid phase at an effective surface density, followed by a blocking step that reduces nonspecific adsorption. The assay uses an unlabeled primary antibody that recognizes the antigen and an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody that recognizes the species and isotype of the primary. The readout is proportional to the amount of enzyme-labeled secondary antibody remaining bound after washing and substrate development. Consider the following principles and definitions as the fundamental base for analyzing controls in such a configuration.\n\nFirst, the law of mass action governs both specific and nonspecific binding equilibria. For a single-site binding interaction between a ligand at concentration $[L]$ and a surface site with dissociation constant $K_D$, the fractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$. When multiple classes of sites exist, the total bound ligand is the sum of contributions from each site class. Specific binding refers to interaction between a binding site and its intended cognate (for example, antigen with its primary antibody, or primary antibody with its secondary), characterized by a low dissociation constant $K_D$ compared to solution concentrations used. Nonspecific binding refers to residual interactions between the labeled reagent and the matrix (for example, the polystyrene plate or immobilized antigen layer) or other unintended components, typically weaker and modeled as adsorption to sites with larger $K_D^{\\text{ns}}$.\n\nSecond, in an indirect immunoassay, the measured signal $S$ after substrate development is proportional to the total amount of enzyme-labeled secondary antibody bound, so $S = \\alpha N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound}}$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant determined by enzyme turnover and detection, and $N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound}}$ is the number of bound secondary antibody molecules. Under conditions where the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody with high affinity and stoichiometry $n$ per primary, and nonspecific adsorption is present, one can write\n$$\nS_{\\text{sample}} = \\alpha\\left(N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,spec}} + N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,spec}} \\approx n\\,N_{\\text{Ab}_1,\\text{bound}}$ and $N_{\\text{Ab}_1,\\text{bound}}$ determined by the primary–antigen equilibrium. A control that omits the primary antibody incubation but keeps all other conditions identical would remove the specific bridging pathway for secondary binding, leaving only nonspecific binding and any residual background.\n\nThird, identical reagent concentrations and processing steps across samples and controls are necessary so that differences in signals can be attributed to the presence or absence of a binding pathway. If the concentration of the secondary antibody changes, the nonspecific occupancy of sites changes according to $\\theta_{\\text{ns}} = \\frac{[{\\text{Ab}}_2]}{[{\\text{Ab}}_2] + K_D^{\\text{ns}}}$, which can lead to changes in background signal.\n\nIn this context, define and justify the use of a \"no-primary\" control to estimate secondary antibody nonspecific binding. Which of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. A \"no-primary\" control in an indirect immunoassay is a replicate processed identically to the sample except that the primary antibody incubation is omitted. Under matched secondary antibody concentration $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$, blocking, and washing, the measured signal $S_{\\text{no-prim}}$ estimates the nonspecific binding term $N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}$. Therefore, the specific antigen-dependent contribution to the sample signal can be estimated as\n$$\nS_{\\text{spec}} \\approx S_{\\text{sample}} - S_{\\text{no-prim}},\n$$\nprovided the secondary antibody does not appreciably cross-react with the antigen layer, i.e., its cross-reactive dissociation constant $K_D^{\\text{cross}}$ satisfies $K_D^{\\text{cross}} \\gg [{\\text{Ab}}_2]$.\n\nB. The \"no-primary\" control chiefly quantifies nonspecific binding of the primary antibody, because the secondary antibody only binds the primary antibody. Any signal observed without primary must be due to residual substrate or plate auto-signal; thus a \"no-primary\" control cannot be used to correct secondary antibody nonspecific binding.\n\nC. If blocking is performed rigorously, nonspecific secondary binding is eliminated, i.e., $S_{\\text{no-prim}} = 0$ by design, making the \"no-primary\" control unnecessary in indirect immunoassays.\n\nD. If the secondary antibody concentration is doubled from $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ to $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$, the nonspecific occupancy scales according to the Langmuir form $\\theta_{\\text{ns}} = \\frac{[{\\text{Ab}}_2]}{[{\\text{Ab}}_2] + K_D^{\\text{ns}}}$. Therefore, a \"no-primary\" control measured at $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ cannot be used to correct a sample measured at $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ without bias, and the control must be matched in $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ to the sample to correctly estimate secondary nonspecific binding.\n\nE. In a direct immunoassay, where the primary antibody is enzyme-labeled and no secondary antibody is used, a \"no-primary\" control serves the same purpose as in indirect immunoassays, namely to estimate secondary antibody nonspecific binding, because assay labels are present in both cases.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Assay Configuration**: Indirect immunoassay on a microplate.\n- **Immobilized Component**: Antigen is immobilized on the solid phase.\n- **Blocking**: A blocking step is used to reduce nonspecific adsorption.\n- **Antibodies**: An unlabeled primary antibody (${\\text{Ab}}_1$) recognizes the antigen. An enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (${\\text{Ab}}_2$) recognizes the primary antibody.\n- **Signal**: The measured signal $S$ is proportional to the amount of bound enzyme-labeled secondary antibody, $S = \\alpha N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound}}$.\n- **Binding Model (Principle 1)**: The law of mass action governs binding. For a single site, fractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$. Specific binding has a low $K_D$; nonspecific binding (${\\text{ns}}$) has a larger $K_D^{\\text{ns}}$.\n- **Signal Composition (Principle 2)**: The signal for a sample is $S_{\\text{sample}} = \\alpha\\left(N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,spec}} + N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}\\right)$.

The description of an indirect immunoassay, the roles of primary and secondary antibodies, the concept of nonspecific binding, blocking, and the application of the law of mass action (Langmuir isotherm model) are all standard and accurate representations of the subject matter. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear theoretical framework and definitions (Principles $1$, $2$, and $3$) and asks for an evaluation of statements based on this framework. The question is specific and can be answered logically by applying the provided principles. A unique and stable analysis is possible.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based claims. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or ill-posed. It is a valid problem in molecular diagnostics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed with deriving the answer and evaluating the options.\n\n### Analysis of the \"No-Primary\" Control\n\nThe purpose of a control in an experiment is to isolate the effect of a single variable. In an indirect immunoassay, the total signal, $S_{\\text{sample}}$, arises from two main sources related to the secondary antibody: specific binding to the primary antibody and nonspecific binding to the surface.\n$$\nS_{\\text{sample}} = S_{\\text{spec}} + S_{\\text{ns}} = \\alpha N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,spec}} + \\alpha N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}\n$$\nThe specific binding pathway requires the presence of the primary antibody, which acts as a bridge between the immobilized antigen and the labeled secondary antibody. By omitting the primary antibody incubation step, we remove this bridge. Consequently, for a \"no-primary\" control, the specific binding term should be zero: $N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,spec}} = 0$.\n\nThe signal measured from this control well, $S_{\\text{no-prim}}$, is then:\n$$\nS_{\\text{no-prim}} = \\alpha(0 + N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}) = \\alpha N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}\n$$\nThis signal directly quantifies the contribution from nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody (plus any other constant background signal from the substrate or instrument, which is often considered part of the total nonspecific term).\n\nFor this control to be valid for correcting the sample signal, the nonspecific binding in the control well must be representative of the nonspecific binding in the sample well. This requires that all conditions affecting nonspecific binding are held constant between the sample and the control, as stated in Principle $3$. The most critical of these is the concentration of the secondary antibody, $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$. If conditions are matched, we can estimate the specific signal by subtraction:\n$$\nS_{\\text{spec}} \\approx S_{\\text{sample}} - S_{\\text{no-prim}}\n$$\nThis justification establishes the \"no-primary\" control as a crucial tool for estimating the background signal arising from secondary antibody nonspecific binding.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A \"no-primary\" control in an indirect immunoassay is a replicate processed identically to the sample except that the primary antibody incubation is omitted. Under matched secondary antibody concentration $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$, blocking, and washing, the measured signal $S_{\\text{no-prim}}$ estimates the nonspecific binding term $N_{\\text{Ab}_2,\\text{bound,ns}}$. Therefore, the specific antigen-dependent contribution to the sample signal can be estimated as $S_{\\text{spec}} \\approx S_{\\text{sample}} - S_{\\text{no-prim}}$, provided the secondary antibody does not appreciably cross-react with the antigen layer, i.e., its cross-reactive dissociation constant $K_D^{\\text{cross}}$ satisfies $K_D^{\\text{cross}} \\gg [{\\text{Ab}}_2]$.**\n\nThis statement accurately defines the \"no-primary\" control and its processing. It correctly states that its signal, $S_{\\text{no-prim}}$, estimates the secondary antibody's nonspecific binding under matched conditions. The formula for estimating the specific signal, $S_{\\text{spec}} \\approx S_{\\text{sample}} - S_{\\text{no-prim}}$, directly follows from the principles outlined. The final clause about cross-reactivity is a critical and correct refinement. If the secondary antibody could bind directly to the antigen (cross-reactivity), the \"no-primary\" control signal would include this binding in addition to nonspecific binding. The condition $K_D^{\\text{cross}} \\gg [{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ ensures that this cross-reactive binding is negligible, making the control a valid estimator of purely nonspecific binding. This statement is fully consistent with the provided principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The \"no-primary\" control chiefly quantifies nonspecific binding of the primary antibody, because the secondary antibody only binds the primary antibody. Any signal observed without primary must be due to residual substrate or plate auto-signal; thus a \"no-primary\" control cannot be used to correct secondary antibody nonspecific binding.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The \"no-primary\" control, by definition, has the primary antibody omitted. Therefore, it cannot quantify any property of the primary antibody, including its nonspecific binding. The statement incorrectly dismisses the major source of signal in this control, which is the nonspecific binding of the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody to the blocked solid phase, a phenomenon explicitly described in the problem's principles. The conclusion that the control is useless for its intended purpose is based on these false premises.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If blocking is performed rigorously, nonspecific secondary binding is eliminated, i.e., $S_{\\text{no-prim}} = 0$ by design, making the \"no-primary\" control unnecessary in indirect immunoassays.**\n\nThis statement reflects an idealization that is not achieved in practice. Blocking procedures are designed to *reduce* nonspecific binding, not *eliminate* it. No blocking agent or protocol is perfectly efficient. There will always be some residual surface area or interaction potential that allows for a detectable level of nonspecific binding of the labeled antibody. Therefore, the signal $S_{\\text{no-prim}}$ is expected to be greater than zero. The control is necessary precisely because this non-zero background exists and must be accounted for to accurately determine the specific signal.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the secondary antibody concentration is doubled from $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ to $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$, the nonspecific occupancy scales according to the Langmuir form $\\theta_{\\text{ns}} = \\frac{[{\\text{Ab}}_2]}{[{\\text{Ab}}_2] + K_D^{\\text{ns}}}$. Therefore, a \"no-primary\" control measured at $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ cannot be used to correct a sample measured at $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ without bias, and the control must be matched in $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ to the sample to correctly estimate secondary nonspecific binding.**\n\nThis statement is a direct and correct application of Principles $1$ and $3$. The Langmuir isotherm describes a non-linear relationship between concentration and fractional occupancy. Doubling the concentration from $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ to $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ will increase $\\theta_{\\text{ns}}$ and thus the nonspecific signal, but not necessarily by a factor of $2$. The new occupancy will be $\\theta_{\\text{ns}}' = \\frac{2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]}{2[{\\text{Ab}}_2] + K_D^{\\text{ns}}}$. Since the nonspecific signal is proportional to this occupancy, subtracting a control signal measured at $[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ from a sample signal measured at $2[{\\text{Ab}}_2]$ would be an invalid comparison and lead to a biased (incorrectly corrected) result. This highlights the critical importance of matching all reagent concentrations between the sample and its corresponding control, which is the central point of Principle $3$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In a direct immunoassay, where the primary antibody is enzyme-labeled and no secondary antibody is used, a \"no-primary\" control serves the same purpose as in indirect immunoassays, namely to estimate secondary antibody nonspecific binding, because assay labels are present in both cases.**\n\nThis statement contains a direct contradiction. A direct immunoassay is correctly defined as using a labeled primary antibody and no secondary antibody. Therefore, a control in this format cannot possibly be used to estimate *secondary* antibody nonspecific binding, as no secondary antibody is present. While a control is still needed in a direct immunoassay, its purpose would be to measure the nonspecific binding of the *labeled primary antibody*. The reasoning \"because assay labels are present in both cases\" is superficial and ignores the identity of the labeled molecule, which is what determines the source of the nonspecific signal.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

We begin with the definition of recovery:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{\\widehat{C}(D)}{C_{s}}\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for the back-calculated concentration, $\\widehat{C}(D)$:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{1}{C_{s}} \\left( \\frac{S_{m}(C_{s},D) - S_{b0}}{\\kappa} \\right)\n$$\nNext, substitute the expression for the signal in matrix, $S_{m}(C_{s},D)$:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{1}{C_{s} \\kappa} \\left( \\left[ \\mu(D)\\,S_{b}(C_{s}) + \\nu(D) \\right] - S_{b0} \\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for the signal in buffer, $S_{b}(C_s)$:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{1}{C_{s} \\kappa} \\left( \\mu(D) \\left[ S_{b0} + \\kappa C_{s} \\right] + \\nu(D) - S_{b0} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the terms in the numerator yields:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{1}{C_{s} \\kappa} \\left( \\mu(D) S_{b0} + \\mu(D) \\kappa C_{s} + \\nu(D) - S_{b0} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging and simplifying the expression gives the final form for the recovery function:\n$$\nR(D) = \\frac{\\mu(D) \\kappa C_{s}}{\\kappa C_{s}} + \\frac{S_{b0}(\\mu(D) - 1) + \\nu(D)}{C_{s} \\kappa} = \\mu(D) + \\frac{S_{b0}(\\mu(D) - 1) + \\nu(D)}{C_{s} \\kappa}\n$$\nThis general expression shows that the recovery consists of the quenching factor $\\mu(D)$ plus an error term that depends on quenching, autofluorescence, the buffer blank, and is inversely proportional to the spike concentration $C_s$.\n\n**Analysis of the Recovery Function**\nWe substitute the given functions $\\mu(D) = 1/(1 + 1.5/D) = D/(D+1.5)$ and $\\nu(D) = 60/D$. The term $\\mu(D)-1$ becomes:\n$$\n\\mu(D) - 1 = \\frac{D}{D+1.5} - 1 = \\frac{D - (D+1.5)}{D+1.5} = \\frac{-1.5}{D+1.5}\n$$\nThe composite error term in the numerator of the second part of $R(D)$ is:\n$$\nS_{b0}(\\mu(D) - 1) + \\nu(D) = S_{b0}\\left(\\frac{-1.5}{D+1.5}\\right) + \\frac{\\nu_0}{D}\n$$\nWith $S_{b0} = 200$ and $\\nu_0 = 60$, this becomes:\n$$\n200\\left(\\frac{-1.5}{D+1.5}\\right) + \\frac{60}{D} = \\frac{-300}{D+1.5} + \\frac{60}{D}\n$$\nThis numerator is negative when $\\frac{300}{D+1.5} > \\frac{60}{D}$, which simplifies to $300D > 60(D+1.5)$, or $240D > 90$, or $D > 90/240 = 0.375$. Since physical dilutions require $D \\ge 1$, this numerator is always negative in the domain of interest.\n\nBecause the error term is negative and inversely proportional to $C_s$, the recovery will be lower for smaller spike concentrations. Therefore, the recovery for $C_{s1} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, denoted $R_1(D)$, will be lower than the recovery for $C_{s2} = 5.00\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, denoted $R_2(D)$, for any $D \\ge 1$. This means the condition $R_1(D) \\ge 0.80$ is more stringent than $R_2(D) \\ge 0.80$.\n\nAs $D \\to \\infty$, $\\mu(D) \\to 1$ and $\\nu(D) \\to 0$, causing $R(D) \\to 1$. Both recovery functions approach $1$ from below for large $D$. Thus, the upper acceptance criterion $R(D) \\le 1.20$ will be satisfied for any $D$ large enough to satisfy $R(D) \\ge 0.80$. The problem reduces to finding the minimum $D$ that satisfies $R_1(D) \\ge 0.80$. The value $D_{\\min}$ is the solution to $R_1(D) = 0.80$.\n\n**Calculation of the Minimum Dilution Factor**\nWe now construct the specific equation for $R_1(D)$ using $C_s = C_{s1} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, $\\kappa = 150\\,\\mathrm{AFU}/(\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1})$, and the constants derived above.\nThe product $C_{s1}\\kappa = 0.50 \\times 150 = 75$.\nThe recovery function $R_1(D)$ is:\n$$\nR_1(D) = \\mu(D) + \\frac{1}{C_{s1}\\kappa}\\left( \\frac{-300}{D+1.5} + \\frac{60}{D} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR_1(D) = \\frac{D}{D+1.5} + \\frac{1}{75}\\left( \\frac{-300}{D+1.5} + \\frac{60}{D} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR_1(D) = \\frac{D}{D+1.5} - \\frac{4}{D+1.5} + \\frac{0.8}{D} = \\frac{D-4}{D+1.5} + \\frac{0.8}{D}\n$$\nWe set $R_1(D)$ equal to the lower acceptance limit of $0.80$:\n$$\n\\frac{D-4}{D+1.5} + \\frac{0.8}{D} = 0.8\n$$\nTo solve for $D$, we first isolate one of the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{D-4}{D+1.5} = 0.8 - \\frac{0.8}{D} = \\frac{0.8D - 0.8}{D}\n$$\nNow, cross-multiply, assuming $D \\neq 0$ and $D \\neq -1.5$, which is true for a dilution factor:\n$$\nD(D-4) = (0.8D - 0.8)(D+1.5)\n$$\n$$\nD^2 - 4D = 0.8D^2 + (0.8 \\times 1.5)D - 0.8D - (0.8 \\times 1.5)\n$$\n$$\nD^2 - 4D = 0.8D^2 + 1.2D - 0.8D - 1.2\n$$\n$$\nD^2 - 4D = 0.8D^2 + 0.4D - 1.2\n$$\nCollect all terms on one side to form a standard quadratic equation $aD^2 + bD + c = 0$:\n$$\n0.2D^2 - 4.4D + 1.2 = 0\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $5$ to clear the decimals gives:\n$$\nD^2 - 22D + 6 = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $D$ using the quadratic formula, $D = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{-(-22) \\pm \\sqrt{(-22)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 24}}{2} = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{460}}{2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nD = 11 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{460}{4}} = 11 \\pm \\sqrt{115}\n$$\nThe two possible solutions are $D_1 = 11 + \\sqrt{115}$ and $D_2 = 11 - \\sqrt{115}$.\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{115} \\approx 10.724$.\n$D_1 \\approx 11 + 10.724 = 21.724$.\n$D_2 \\approx 11 - 10.724 = 0.276$.\nThe solution must correspond to a dilution, so $D \\ge 1$. The only physically meaningful solution is the larger root. Therefore, the minimum dilution factor is $D_{\\min} = 11 + \\sqrt{115}$.\n\nThe final step is to provide the numerical value rounded to three significant figures.\n$D_{\\min} = 11 + \\sqrt{115} \\approx 21.7238...$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $21.7$.",
