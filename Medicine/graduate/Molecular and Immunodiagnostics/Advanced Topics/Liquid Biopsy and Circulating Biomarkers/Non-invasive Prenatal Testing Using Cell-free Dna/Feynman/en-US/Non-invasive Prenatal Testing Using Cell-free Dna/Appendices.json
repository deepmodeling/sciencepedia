By treating the proportion of DNA from each chromosome as a measurable quantity, we can use a z-score to determine if an observed proportion is statistically unusual compared to a reference population of euploid pregnancies. This exercise will walk you through the core calculation that translates raw sequencing data into a statistical signal for a potential aneuploidy like trisomy 21 .",

            "problem": "In shallow whole-genome sequencing for Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) of cell-free DNA, aneuploidy detection for chromosome $21$ can be formulated by comparing the observed chromosome-specific read fraction to a reference distribution derived from a set of euploid pregnancies after bias correction (e.g., guanine–cytosine content and mappability normalization). Consider a sample with a total of $30{,}000{,}000$ uniquely mapped autosomal reads, of which $1{,}050{,}000$ map to chromosome $21$. The euploid reference cohort yields a mean fraction for chromosome $21$ of $0.015$ and a between-sample standard deviation of $0.0005$ for the same normalization and counting scheme.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statistical notion of standardization—viewing the observed fraction as a realization from a distribution characterized by a reference mean and standard deviation under the null hypothesis of euploidy—and assuming that, due to the large number of reads, the standardized deviate is approximately standard normal, compute the standardized deviate (z-score) for chromosome $21$ in this sample.\n\nThen, interpret whether the result is consistent with overrepresentation of chromosome $21$ that would be used to flag a potential trisomy $21$ call in a research setting that uses a two-sided normal cutoff of $|z| \\ge 3$.\n\nReport only the z-score as a pure number, rounded to three significant figures, in your final numeric answer. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a standardized deviate, or z-score, for the fraction of sequencing reads corresponding to chromosome $21$ in a non-invasive prenatal test. This score is used to assess whether the observed fraction is statistically deviant from a reference population of euploid samples, which would suggest a chromosomal aneuploidy like trisomy $21$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$ in the given sample. Let $N_{total}$ be the total number of uniquely mapped autosomal reads and $N_{21}$ be the number of those reads that map to chromosome $21$.\n\nThe given values are:\nTotal autosomal reads, $N_{total} = 30{,}000{,}000$.\nChromosome $21$ reads, $N_{21} = 1{,}050{,}000$.\n\nThe observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$, denoted as $f_{obs}$, is the ratio of $N_{21}$ to $N_{total}$:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{N_{21}}{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{1{,}050{,}000}{30{,}000{,}000} = \\frac{1.05}{30} = 0.035$$\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean of a reference distribution. The problem specifies that the reference distribution is derived from a euploid cohort and provides its mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet $\\mu_{ref}$ be the mean fraction for chromosome $21$ in the reference euploid cohort, and let $\\sigma_{ref}$ be the between-sample standard deviation for this fraction. The problem provides:\nMean reference fraction, $\\mu_{ref} = 0.015$.\nStandard deviation of the reference fraction, $\\sigma_{ref} = 0.0005$.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{f_{obs} - \\mu_{ref}}{\\sigma_{ref}}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated $f_{obs}$ and the given reference parameters:\n$$z = \\frac{0.035 - 0.015}{0.0005}$$\n$$z = \\frac{0.020}{0.0005}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express the numerator and denominator in scientific notation or as a ratio of integers:\n$$z = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10^{-2 - (-4)} = 0.4 \\times 10^{2} = 40$$\n\nThe calculated z-score for chromosome $21$ in this sample is exactly $40$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this result in a research context where a potential trisomy $21$ is flagged if the absolute value of the z-score, $|z|$, is greater than or equal to $3$.\nIn our case, $|z| = |40| = 40$.\nSince $40 \\ge 3$, the observed fraction of chromosome $21$ reads is $40$ standard deviations above the mean of the euploid reference population. This is a very strong statistical signal indicating a significant overrepresentation of chromosome $21$. Such a result is highly consistent with the presence of an extra copy of chromosome $21$ in the fetal genome, and would be flagged as high-risk for trisomy $21$.\n\nThe final answer requires the z-score as a pure number rounded to three significant figures. The exact value is $40$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $40.0$.",

The laboratory reports a test sensitivity of $0.99$ and a test specificity of $0.999$ for trisomy 21.\n\nStarting from the definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities and from Bayes' theorem, derive the analytic expression for the posterior probability of trisomy 21 given a positive NIPT result. Then evaluate this expression using the values provided. Treat the maternal age–related prevalence as the pre-test probability. Express the final posterior probability as a decimal between $0$ and $1$, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that a fetus has trisomy 21, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the fetus does not have trisomy 21. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test probability, or prevalence, of trisomy 21 is $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = \\frac{1}{500} = 0.002$$\n    The probability of not having trisomy 21 is therefore:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the condition is present.\n    $$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+|D) = 0.99$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the condition is absent.\n    $$\\text{Specificity} = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.999$$\n\nThe problem asks for the posterior probability of having trisomy 21 given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(D|T^+)$. This quantity is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the test.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability $P(D|T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: a true positive (the fetus has trisomy 21 and the test is positive) and a false positive (the fetus does not have trisomy 21 but the test is positive).\n\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+|D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the condition is absent. this is the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity, as $P(T^+|D^c) + P(T^-|D^c) = 1$.\nTherefore:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}$$\nNumerically, this is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001$.\n\nSubstituting the expanded form for $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem, we obtain the required analytic expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence ($P_{prev}$):\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(\\text{Sensitivity}) (P_{prev})}{(\\text{Sensitivity}) (P_{prev}) + (1 - \\text{Specificity}) (1 - P_{prev})}$$\n\nThis is the general analytic expression for the posterior probability given a positive result.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the numerical values provided:\n-   $P_{prev} = P(D) = 0.002$\n-   $\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+|D) = 0.99$\n-   $\\text{Specificity} = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.999$, so $1 - \\text{Specificity} = 0.001$\n-   $1 - P_{prev} = P(D^c) = 0.998$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$P(T^+|D) P(D) = (0.99) \\times (0.002) = 0.00198$$\nThis is the probability of a true positive result.\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n-   The first term is the same as the numerator: $0.00198$.\n-   The second term is the probability of a false positive result:\n    $$P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c) = (1 - 0.999) \\times (1 - 0.002) = (0.001) \\times (0.998) = 0.000998$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.00198 + 0.000998 = 0.002978$$\n\nFinally, the posterior probability is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{0.00198}{0.002978} \\approx 0.6648757558764268$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $6$, $4$, $8$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.6649$$\nThis result signifies that even with a highly sensitive and specific test, a positive result for a condition with low prevalence does not guarantee the presence of the condition. In this case, the probability is approximately $66.5\\%$.",

            "solution": "The problem will be addressed in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the X-chromosome shift $\\Delta_{X}$ for a fetus with monosomy X; second, the evaluation of this shift for a given fetal fraction; and third, a qualitative and symbolic explanation of the confounding effect of maternal X-chromosome mosaicism.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $\\Delta_{X}$**\n\nThe core principle is that the effective copy number of a chromosome in the maternal plasma cfDNA mixture is the weighted average of the copy numbers from the maternal and fetal tissue sources. The weights are the maternal fraction ($1-f$) and the fetal fraction ($f$), respectively.\n\nLet $CN_{A,m}$ and $CN_{A,f}$ be the autosomal copy numbers for the mother and fetus, respectively.\nLet $CN_{X,m}$ and $CN_{X,f}$ be the X-chromosome copy numbers for the mother and fetus, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- Mother ($46,\\mathrm{XX}$): $CN_{A,m} = 2$, $CN_{X,m} = 2$.\n- Fetus ($45,\\mathrm{X}$): $CN_{A,f} = 2$, $CN_{X,f} = 1$.\n\nThe effective autosomal copy number in the mixture, $CN_{A, \\text{eff}}$, is:\n$$CN_{A, \\text{eff}} = (1 - f) \\cdot CN_{A,m} + f \\cdot CN_{A,f}$$\n$$CN_{A, \\text{eff}} = (1 - f) \\cdot 2 + f \\cdot 2 = 2 - 2f + 2f = 2$$\n\nThe effective X-chromosome copy number in the mixture, $CN_{X, \\text{eff}}$, for the case of a monosomy X fetus is:\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff}} = (1 - f) \\cdot CN_{X,m} + f \\cdot CN_{X,f}$$\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff}} = (1 - f) \\cdot 2 + f \\cdot 1 = 2 - 2f + f = 2 - f$$\n\nThe normalized X-chromosome dosage, $D_{X}$, is the ratio of these effective copy numbers:\n$$D_{X} = \\frac{CN_{X, \\text{eff}}}{CN_{A, \\text{eff}}} = \\frac{2 - f}{2} = 1 - \\frac{f}{2}$$\n\nThe X-chromosome shift, $\\Delta_{X}$, is defined as the deviation from the euploid female reference dosage of $1$:\n$$\\Delta_{X} = D_{X} - 1$$\n$$\\Delta_{X} = \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right) - 1 = -\\frac{f}{2}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $\\Delta_{X}$ in terms of $f$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of $\\Delta_{X}$**\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate this expression for a fetal fraction of $f = 0.1$:\n$$\\Delta_{X} = -\\frac{0.1}{2} = -0.05$$\n\n**Part 3: Confounding Effect of Maternal Mosaicism**\n\nNow we consider the scenario where the mother has X-chromosome mosaicism, with a fraction $m$ of her cells being $45,\\mathrm{X}$ and the remaining fraction ($1-m$) being $46,\\mathrm{XX}$. We assume the fetus is the subject of testing for monosomy X as before.\n\nThe presence of maternal mosaicism alters the average copy number of the X chromosome contributed by the mother to the cfDNA pool. The maternal autosomal copy number remains $2$. The average maternal X-chromosome copy number, $CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}}$, becomes:\n$$CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}} = m \\cdot (1) + (1-m) \\cdot (2) = m + 2 - 2m = 2 - m$$\n\nLet us re-calculate the effective X-chromosome copy number, $CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}}$, in the plasma mixture, still assuming a $45,\\mathrm{X}$ fetus ($CN_{X,f} = 1$):\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = (1 - f) \\cdot CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}} + f \\cdot CN_{X,f}$$\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = (1 - f)(2 - m) + f(1)$$\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = 2 - m - 2f + mf + f = 2 - f - m(1-f)$$\n\nThe effective autosomal copy number is still $2$. The new normalized X-chromosome dosage, $D_{X, \\text{mosaic}}$, is:\n$$D_{X, \\text{mosaic}} = \\frac{CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}}}{CN_{A, \\text{eff}}} = \\frac{2 - f - m(1-f)}{2} = 1 - \\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$$\n\nThe observed chromosome shift, $\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}}$, in this confounded scenario is:\n$$\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}} = D_{X, \\text{mosaic}} - 1 = -\\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$$\n\nQualitatively, the observed shift now has two components:\n1.  A term from the fetal monosomy X: $-\\frac{f}{2}$.\n2.  A term from the maternal mosaicism: $-\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$.\n\n**Explanation of Confounding:**\n\nThe NIPT model assumes the mother is constitutionally euploid ($46,\\mathrm{XX}$), so any deviation from the baseline is attributed to the fetus. Maternal mosaicism violates this assumption and confounds the interpretation in a critical way.\n\nThe maternal mosaicism introduces a negative bias in the X-chromosome measurement that is independent of the fetal status. From the expression $\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}} = -\\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$, we can see that the observed negative shift is of a greater magnitude than would be expected from the fetal aneuploidy alone.\n\nThe primary confounding effect is the risk of a **false positive** result. Let's consider a scenario where the fetus is actually euploid (e.g., $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ or $46,\\mathrm{XY}$), but the mother has undetected $45,\\mathrm{X}$ mosaicism.\nIf the fetus is a euploid female ($46,\\mathrm{XX}$), then $CN_{X,f} = 2$. The observed shift would be:\n$$\\Delta_{X, \\text{euploid-fetus}} = \\frac{(1 - f)(2-m) + f(2)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{2 - m - 2f + mf + 2f}{2} - 1$$\n$$= \\frac{2 - m + mf}{2} - 1 = 1 - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$$\nIf the fetus is a euploid male ($46,\\mathrm{XY}$), then $CN_{X,f} = 1$, and the observed shift would be identical to the expression derived for the $45,\\mathrm{X}$ fetus with a mosaic mother, $\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}} = -\\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$.\n\nIn both euploid fetal cases, the maternal mosaicism induces a negative shift in $\\Delta_X$. A testing algorithm, unaware of the maternal condition, would interpret this negative shift ($-\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$) as evidence for fetal monosomy X. For instance, if $m=0.1$ and $f=0.1$, the shift would be $-\\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{2} = -0.045$. This value is nearly identical to the $-0.05$ shift expected for a true fetal monosomy X at the same fetal fraction. Thus, the test would very likely produce a false positive result, incorrectly flagging a healthy fetus for a chromosomal abnormality that is actually present in the mother. This demonstrates that maternal sex chromosome aneuploidy is a significant biological confounder for fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy screening via NIPT.",
