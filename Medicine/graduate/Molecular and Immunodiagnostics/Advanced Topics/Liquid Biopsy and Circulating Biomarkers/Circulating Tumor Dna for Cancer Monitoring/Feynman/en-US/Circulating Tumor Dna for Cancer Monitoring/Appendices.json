Consider a plasma sample of volume $10$ mL with a measured cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) concentration of $20$ ng/mL. Assume that the typical cfDNA fragment length is approximately $166$ base pairs, but for the purpose of counting locus copies, use the standard conversion that $3.3$ pg of deoxyribonucleic acid corresponds to one human haploid genome equivalent. Assume a single-copy locus per haploid genome, that recovery and assay sampling are unbiased with respect to allele identity, and that ploidy alterations can be neglected so that AF reflects the fraction of haploid genome equivalents carrying the mutant allele at that locus. The plasma variant allele fraction is $AF = 0.002$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of AF as a fraction of locus copies and the mass-to-copy conversion based on the haploid genome mass, derive an expression for the expected number of mutant molecules in the entire $10$ mL plasma volume and evaluate it numerically.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures and report it in molecules (use “molecules” as the unit in your reasoning; the final numeric answer should be unitless).",

The concepts used (genome equivalents, recovery efficiency, sampling statistics) and the numerical values provided are realistic. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe first step is to determine the total number of haploid genome equivalents (GE) that are successfully captured and available for sequencing. The input mass $M$ is given in nanograms (ng), while the mass per diploid genome, $m_g$, is given in picograms (pg). We must harmonize these units. Since $1$ ng = $10^3$ pg, the input mass in picograms is $10^3 M$.\n\nThe number of diploid genome equivalents in the initial sample is the total mass divided by the mass per diploid genome:\n$$N_{\\text{initial, diploid}} = \\frac{10^3 M}{m_g}$$\nwhere $M$ is in nanograms and $m_g$ is in picograms.\n\nEach diploid genome consists of two haploid genomes. The fraction $p$ typically refers to the variant allele frequency, which is a haploid concept. Therefore, it is more precise to work with the number of haploid genome equivalents. The total number of haploid GEs in the initial sample is:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{initial, diploid}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^3 M}{m_g}$$\nHowever, the problem defines $m_g$ as mass *per genome equivalent* and $p$ as a fraction *of genome equivalents*. The standard in the field is to use haploid genome equivalents for these calculations, where the mass of a haploid GE is $m_g / 2$. If we use $m_g = 6.6$ pg as the mass of a diploid genome, then the mass of a haploid genome is $3.3$ pg. Let's define the mass of a single (haploid) genome equivalent as $m_{GE} = m_g / 2 = 3.3$ pg. The total number of haploid genome equivalents in the starting sample is:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{10^3 M \\text{ [pg]}}{m_{GE} \\text{ [pg/GE]}} = \\frac{10^3 M}{m_g/2} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^3 M}{m_g}$$\nThis number is more consistent with how allele frequencies are treated.\n\nThe combined molecular recovery fraction, $\\rho$, represents the efficiency of all steps leading to the final sequencing library. The number of haploid genome equivalents successfully captured in the library, $N$, is:\n$$N = \\rho N_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M}{m_g}$$\nThis value $N$ represents the total number of independent trials in our sampling experiment.\n\nWe are interested in the number of mutant molecules, $X$, captured in the library. Each of the $N$ captured molecules has a probability $p$ of being a mutant. This is a classic Bernoulli trial scheme. The number of captured mutants, $X$, follows a Binomial distribution:\n$$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=N, p_s=p)$$\nwhere $n=N$ is the number of trials and $p_s=p$ is the success probability per trial.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the Poisson limit, which is appropriate when $N$ is large and $p$ is small, such that their product $\\lambda = Np$ is finite. In molecular diagnostics, $N$ is typically on the order of thousands to millions, and $p$ can be very small ($< 10^{-3}$), validating this approximation. The parameter $\\lambda$ of the Poisson distribution is the expected number of mutant molecules:\n$$\\lambda = Np = \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M}{m_g} \\right) p$$\n\nThe probability of observing exactly $k$ mutant molecules under the Poisson model is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\nWe need to find the probability of capturing *at least one* mutant molecule, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is simpler to calculate the complement event, the probability of capturing zero mutant molecules, $P(X=0)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nUsing the Poisson formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda}}{1} = e^{-\\lambda}$$\nTherefore, the probability of capturing at least one mutant molecule is:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$, we obtain the desired general expression:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp\\left( -\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\right)$$\n*Note: A common simplification in the field is to use diploid genome equivalents throughout, where the number of molecules is $N = \\rho (10^3 M / m_g)$ and the expected number of mutant copies is $\\lambda = Np$. This effectively omits the factor of 2. However, for allele fractions, the haploid genome count is more rigorous. The problem statement is slightly ambiguous as to whether \"genome equivalent\" is haploid or diploid. Let's re-evaluate based on the provided parameters. If we treat $m_g=6.6$ pg as the mass per sampleable DNA fragment (which is what a \"genome equivalent\" represents in cfDNA, and is on average ~167 bp, not a full genome), the calculation would change. However, sticking to the formal definitions given, \"genome mass\" implies the mass of the full chromosomal content. The most conservative and standard interpretation, balancing rigor and convention, is that $p$ relates to the haploid genome and $m_g$ is the diploid mass. Let's proceed with the derived formula.*\n\nWe are tasked with finding the minimal mass $M$ required to achieve a capture probability of at least $0.95$:\n$$1 - \\exp\\left( -\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\right) \\ge 0.95$$\nRearranging the inequality:\n$$\\exp\\left( -\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\right) \\le 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nTo isolate $M$, we multiply by $-1$ (which reverses the inequality sign):\n$$\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\ge -\\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$:\n$$\\frac{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g} \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right) = \\ln(20)$$\nNow, we solve for $M$:\n$$M \\ge \\frac{m_g \\ln(20)}{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho p}$$\nThe minimal mass $M$ is given by the equality:\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{m_g \\ln(20)}{2 \\times 10^3 \\rho p}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $m_g = 6.6$ pg\n-   $\\rho = 0.40$\n-   $p = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n-   $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.99573$\n\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{2 \\times 10^3 \\times 0.40 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})}$$\nLet's compute the denominator:\n$$2 \\times 1000 \\times 0.40 \\times 0.0005 = 2000 \\times 0.40 \\times 0.0005 = 800 \\times 0.0005 = 0.4$$\nSo, the expression for $M_{\\text{min}}$ becomes:\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{0.4}$$\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = 16.5 \\times \\ln(20)$$\n$$M_{\\text{min}} \\approx 16.5 \\times 2.99573227 \\approx 49.4295825$$\nThe unit of $M$ in this formula is nanograms, as required.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $49.4$.\n\nLet's re-run the calculation assuming the simpler (and common, though less rigorous) interpretation where the number of genome equivalents is just $N = \\rho (10^3 M / m_g)$ without the factor of $2$.\nIn this case, $\\lambda = (\\frac{10^3 \\rho M}{m_g})p$.\nThe derivation for $M$ would be $M \\ge \\frac{m_g \\ln(20)}{10^3 \\rho p}$.\n$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{10^3 \\times 0.40 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{0.2} = 33 \\times \\ln(20) \\approx 98.859$.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $98.9$.\nGiven the ambiguity of \"genome equivalent\" in the context of cfDNA (which are fragments) versus a \"diploid genome mass\", the second interpretation is more standard in practice for back-of-the-envelope calculations in genomics papers. It implicitly assumes that one \"genome equivalent\" by mass contains, on average, one copy of any given locus. The problem phrasing \"fraction p of genome equivalents\" suggests this simpler model is intended. We will proceed with this more standard interpretation.\n\nFinal model chosen:\nExpected number of mutant molecules $\\lambda = \\frac{10^3 \\rho M p}{m_g}$.\nCondition: $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) \\ge 0.95$.\nMinimal mass: $M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{m_g \\ln(20)}{10^3 \\rho p}$.\nCalculation:\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{1000 \\times 0.40 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})}$$\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6.6 \\times \\ln(20)}{0.2} = 33 \\times \\ln(20) \\approx 98.859165$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $98.9$.\n\nFinal check of all steps and logic. The derivation follows directly from the Poisson approximation of Binomial sampling. The algebraic manipulation is correct. The numerical substitution is correct. The interpretation of \"genome equivalent\" is a subtle but key point; the chosen interpretation aligns with common practice in the field for this type of problem. The final result is in the correct units and rounded as requested.",
