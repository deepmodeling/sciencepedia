The assumptions (non-overlapping footprints, monolayer, void-free tiling) are standard idealizations for calculating a theoretical maximum. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary definitions, constants, and values to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Derivation of the Maximum Molar Surface Density, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$\nLet $\\sigma$ be the surface number density, defined as the number of molecules, $N$, adsorbed on a surface of area $S$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{N}{S}\n$$\nThe units of $\\sigma$ are molecules per unit area (e.g., $\\mathrm{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$).\n\nThe problem states that at maximum packing, the entire surface is tiled by the footprints of the immobilized ligands. This implies that the total surface area $S$ is equal to the sum of the areas of all the individual molecular footprints. If there are $N$ molecules, each with a footprint area $A_f$, then the total area they occupy is:\n$$\nS = N \\times A_f\n$$\nThe maximum surface number density, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, is therefore achieved under this condition. By substituting the expression for $S$ into the definition of $\\sigma$, we find:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{N}{N \\times A_f} = \\frac{1}{A_f}\n$$\nNext, we relate the surface number density ($\\sigma$) to the molar surface density ($\\Gamma$). The molar surface density is defined as the number of moles, $n$, per unit area $S$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{n}{S}\n$$\nThe number of molecules $N$ is related to the number of moles $n$ through Avogadro's number, $N_A$, by the relation $N = n \\times N_A$. We can rearrange this to express $n$ as $n = \\frac{N}{N_A}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{N/N_A}{S} = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\left( \\frac{N}{S} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma}{N_A}\n$$\nThe maximum molar surface density, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$, corresponds to the maximum surface number density, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. We can therefore write:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{1/A_f}{N_A} = \\frac{1}{A_f N_A}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the maximum molar surface density as a function of the molecular footprint area $A_f$ and Avogadro's number $N_A$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation of $\\Gamma_{\\max}$\nWe are asked to evaluate $\\Gamma_{\\max}$ for $A_f = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and express the result in units of $\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.\n\nFirst, we must perform unit conversions to ensure consistency. The final answer requires units involving $\\mathrm{cm}^2$, so we convert $A_f$ from $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\nThe conversion between nanometers and centimeters is $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nTherefore, the conversion for area is:\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 = (10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 = 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\n$$\nThe given footprint area is:\n$$\nA_f = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 = 25 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\n$$\nThe value of Avogadro's number is $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\Gamma_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{(2.5 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}\n$$\nCalculating the denominator:\n$$\n(2.5 \\times 10^{-13}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}) = 1.50553519 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$ in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{1.50553519 \\times 10^{11}} \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\approx 6.64215 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nFinally, we convert this result to the required units of $\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.

According to Fick's first law, the flux $J(x,t)$ is given by $J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial x}$. The current for an $n$-electron oxidation is:\n$$\nI_f(t) = nFAJ_{\\text{surface}}(t) = nFAD\\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the electrode area and $F$ is the Faraday constant. To find the gradient at the surface, we first differentiate $\\bar{C}(x,s)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{C}(x,s)}{dx} = \\frac{C^*}{s}\\left( - \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{D}}\\right)\\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{D}}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{Ds}}\\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating at the surface $x=0$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\bar{C}}{dx}\\right)_{x=0} = \\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{Ds}} = \\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{D}}s^{-1/2}\n$$\nTo find the gradient in the time domain, we take the inverse Laplace transform, using the standard pair $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{s^{-1/2}\\} = (\\pi t)^{-1/2}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x=0} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{D}}s^{-1/2}\\right\\} = \\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{D}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}} = \\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the current yields the Cottrell equation, which describes the time dependence of the faradaic current:\n$$\nI_f(t) = nFAD\\left(\\frac{C^*}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}}\\right) = \\frac{nFAC^*\\sqrt{D}}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the faradaic current under semi-infinite linear diffusion control decays as $t^{-1/2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Current**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n$n = 1$\n$F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$A = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n$D = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$C^{*} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the concentration $C^*$ to units consistent with the other parameters ($\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$):\n$$\nC^* = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived Cottrell equation to evaluate the current at $t=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nI_f(1\\,\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{(1)(96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})(0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})\\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}}{\\sqrt{\\pi (1\\,\\mathrm{s})}}\n$$\n$$\nI_f(1\\,\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{9.6485 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\times \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}}\n$$\n$$\nI_f(1\\,\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{9.6485 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 3.16228 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.77245}\\,\\mathrm{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_f(1\\,\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{3.0508 \\times 10^{-11}}{1.77245}\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 1.72126 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanoamperes ($1\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}$):\n$$\nI_f(1\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 17.2126 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 17.2126\\,\\mathrm{nA}\n$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the current is $17.2\\,\\mathrm{nA}$.\n\n**Part 3: Role of Electric Double Layer (EDL) Charging Current**\n\nIn a real chronoamperometry experiment, the total measured current $I_{\\text{total}}(t)$ is the sum of the faradaic current $I_f(t)$ and a non-faradaic charging current $I_c(t)$ required to charge the electric double layer at the electrode-solution interface.\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}}(t) = I_f(t) + I_c(t)\n$$\nThe EDL behaves like a capacitor with capacitance $C_{dl}$. When the potential is stepped by $\\Delta E$, this capacitance is charged through the uncompensated solution resistance $R_u$. In the simplest model (an RC circuit), the charging current decays exponentially with time:\n$$\nI_c(t) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{R_u} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_u C_{dl}}\\right)\n$$\nThe time dependence of the charging current ($I_c \\propto \\exp(-t/\\tau)$) is fundamentally different from that of the faradaic current ($I_f \\propto t^{-1/2}$). The exponential decay of $I_c$ is much more rapid than the power-law decay of $I_f$.\nAt very short times (typically microseconds to a few milliseconds), immediately after the potential step, the charging current is very high and dominates the total measured current. This initial spike of current obscures the faradaic signal. However, because $I_c$ decays exponentially, it becomes negligible after a few time constants ($t \\gg R_u C_{dl}$). The faradaic current, which decays more slowly, persists and becomes the dominant component of the total current at longer times.\nTherefore, in practice, chronoamperometric data is analyzed at times sufficiently long for the charging current to have decayed, allowing the measurement to accurately reflect the diffusion-limited faradaic process described by the Cottrell equation.",
