This exercise demonstrates the direct, linear relationship between the change in the local refractive index, $\\Delta n$, caused by protein binding and the resulting shift in the resonance angle, $\\Delta \\theta$. Mastering this simple calculation  is the first step toward interpreting the raw output of any SPR instrument and understanding the physical origin of the ubiquitous Response Unit (RU).",

            "problem": "A prism-coupled metal film supporting a surface plasmon mode is interrogated by a monochromatic beam in a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) instrument. The instrument reports a dimensionless sensor response, denoted by Response Units (RU), which is proportional to the shift in the resonance condition caused by changes in the dielectric properties at the metal–dielectric interface. Under small perturbations, the measured response is well approximated by a linear relation to the local refractive index near the surface. Consider an injection of an analyte in a sample buffer whose bulk refractive index differs from that of the running buffer. This bulk refractive index mismatch gives rise to an apparent change in the measured response even in the absence of binding.\n\nStarting from the dependence of the SPR resonance condition on the dielectric properties at the interface and the definition of a sensitivity coefficient as a partial derivative of the response with respect to the local refractive index, derive the linearized expression connecting the bulk refractive index change to the observed response change in terms of a sensitivity coefficient. Then, use this result to correct the signal of an active channel by referencing to a neighboring ligand-free channel.\n\nAssume the following experimentally determined quantities at a fixed time point within the steady-state of the injection:\n- The bulk refractive index change relative to the running buffer is $\\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}}=1.10 \\times 10^{-3}$ Refractive Index Unit (RIU).\n- The response-to-refractive-index sensitivity of the active channel is $S_{\\text{act}}=1.75 \\times 10^{4}$ RU/RIU.\n- The response-to-refractive-index sensitivity of the reference (ligand-free) channel is $S_{\\text{ref}}=1.60 \\times 10^{4}$ RU/RIU.\n- The raw observed response in the active channel at the selected time point is $R_{\\text{act,obs}}=215.8$ RU.\n- The raw observed response in the reference channel at the same time point is $R_{\\text{ref,obs}}=17.6$ RU.\n\nUsing the derived linearized relation and appropriate referencing to remove the bulk contribution, compute the corrected binding response in the active channel at the selected time point. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in Response Units (RU).",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in understanding how the measured SPR signal, denoted by Response Units ($RU$), is related to changes in the refractive index at the sensor surface. The problem states that for small perturbations, the response, $R$, is a linear function of the local refractive index, $n$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between response and refractive index. The sensitivity of the sensor, $S$, is defined as the partial derivative of the response with respect to the refractive index:\n$$S = \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial n}$$\nFor a small change in refractive index, $\\Delta n$, the corresponding change in response, $\\Delta R$, can be approximated by the first-order term of a Taylor expansion:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial n} \\right) \\Delta n$$\nSubstituting the definition of sensitivity $S$, we arrive at the required linearized expression:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx S \\cdot \\Delta n$$\nIn an SPR binding experiment, the total change in refractive index at the sensor surface of an active channel (where a ligand is immobilized) is a superposition of two effects: the change due to the binding of analyte molecules to the ligand, $\\Delta n_{\\text{bind}}$, and the change due to the difference in the bulk refractive index between the sample buffer and the running buffer, $\\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}}$.\nThus, the total observed response in the active channel, $R_{\\text{act,obs}}$, is the sum of the response due to binding, $R_{\\text{act,bind}}$, and the response due to the bulk effect, $R_{\\text{act,bulk}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{act,obs}} = R_{\\text{act,bind}} + R_{\\text{act,bulk}}$$\nUsing the linearized model, these components can be written as:\n$$R_{\\text{act,bind}} = S_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\Delta n_{\\text{bind}}$$\n$$R_{\\text{act,bulk}} = S_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}}$$\nwhere $S_{\\text{act}}$ is the sensitivity of the active channel.\n\nThe objective is to determine the true binding response, designated as the corrected response $R_{\\text{corrected}}$, which corresponds to $R_{\\text{act,bind}}$. To do this, we must subtract the bulk contribution from the total observed signal:\n$$R_{\\text{corrected}} = R_{\\text{act,bind}} = R_{\\text{act,obs}} - R_{\\text{act,bulk}}$$\nTo estimate $R_{\\text{act,bulk}}$, we use a reference channel. This channel is identical to the active channel but lacks the immobilized ligand. Consequently, no specific binding occurs, and any observed response, $R_{\\text{ref,obs}}$, is due solely to the bulk refractive index change:\n$$R_{\\text{ref,obs}} = S_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}}$$\nwhere $S_{\\text{ref}}$ is the sensitivity of the reference channel.\n\nFrom the reference channel measurement, we can express the bulk refractive index change as:\n$$\\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{ref,obs}}}{S_{\\text{ref}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the bulk response in the active channel gives:\n$$R_{\\text{act,bulk}} = S_{\\text{act}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{ref,obs}}}{S_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) = \\frac{S_{\\text{act}}}{S_{\\text{ref}}} R_{\\text{ref,obs}}$$\nThis equation provides a way to calculate the bulk effect in the active channel by scaling the response measured in the reference channel by the ratio of the channels' sensitivities.\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the equation for the corrected response:\n$$R_{\\text{corrected}} = R_{\\text{act,obs}} - \\left( \\frac{S_{\\text{act}}}{S_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) R_{\\text{ref,obs}}$$\nThis is the general formula for reference-corrected binding response under the given assumptions.\n\nNow, we apply the provided experimental data:\n- Raw observed response in the active channel: $R_{\\text{act,obs}} = 215.8$ RU\n- Raw observed response in the reference channel: $R_{\\text{ref,obs}} = 17.6$ RU\n- Sensitivity of the active channel: $S_{\\text{act}} = 1.75 \\times 10^{4}$ RU/RIU\n- Sensitivity of the reference channel: $S_{\\text{ref}} = 1.60 \\times 10^{4}$ RU/RIU\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$R_{\\text{corrected}} = 215.8 - \\left( \\frac{1.75 \\times 10^{4}}{1.60 \\times 10^{4}} \\right) \\times 17.6$$\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the sensitivities:\n$$\\frac{S_{\\text{act}}}{S_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{1.75}{1.60} = 1.09375$$\nNext, we calculate the estimated bulk contribution in the active channel:\n$$R_{\\text{act,bulk}} = 1.09375 \\times 17.6 = 19.25$$\nFinally, we compute the corrected binding response by subtraction:\n$$R_{\\text{corrected}} = 215.8 - 19.25 = 196.55$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $196.55$ when rounded to four significant figures becomes $196.6$.\nThe provided value for the bulk refractive index change, $\\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}} = 1.10 \\times 10^{-3}$ RIU, is consistent with the reference channel data, as $S_{\\text{ref}} \\times \\Delta n_{\\text{bulk}} = (1.60 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (1.10 \\times 10^{-3}) = 17.6$ RU, which matches $R_{\\text{ref,obs}}$. This confirms the internal consistency of the problem statement, but the referencing procedure correctly relies on the measured $R_{\\text{ref,obs}}$.",

The one-site model without drift will generally produce time-correlated residuals; we anticipate misspecification: true.\n\nAlgorithmic steps in the program:\n$1.$ Generate time vectors, association cutoff $t_a$, and concentration lists per case.\n$2.$ Simulate noisy sensorgrams with the specified true kinetic models:\n- Single-site: use $R_{\\text{assoc}}(t)$ and $R_{\\text{diss}}(t)$.\n- Two-site: sum of two single-site responses with site-specific parameters.\n- Drift: add $d\\,t$ where $d$ is the drift slope to the simulated signal.\nAdd Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma$ to all points.\n$3.$ Fit global parameters $\\{k_a,k_d,R_{\\max}\\}$ by minimizing $\\text{RSS}$ over all points across concentrations for the case via bounded least squares.\n$4.$ Compute standardized residuals per concentration and diagnostics:\n- Durbin–Watson $D_j$ per concentration and $\\bar{D}$.\n- Pearson correlation $r$ and $p$ between stacked standardized residuals and fitted signals.\n$5.$ Apply the decision rule with $D_{\\text{lower}} = 1.6$, $\\alpha=0.01$, $r_{\\min}=0.2$ to produce a boolean per case.\n$6.$ Print the results in the required single-line format: a list of booleans in square brackets.\n\nThis approach integrates the fundamental kinetic laws, closed-form solutions of the ODE under step inputs, and statistical diagnostics to detect model–data mismatch in an SPR experiment framework at advanced graduate level.",
