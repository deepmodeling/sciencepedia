Consider the following fundamental bases and observations, all of which are to be treated as given facts for this scenario:\n\n- In random sequencing, the per-base coverage arises from independent sampling of fragments across the targeted region, and the expected coverage is proportional to total sequencing depth. If $D$ denotes the mean raw per-base depth across all sequenced reads, and $p_{\\text{on}}$ denotes the fraction of bases that map to the intended target (on-target fraction), then the expected on-target per-base depth is $p_{\\text{on}} D$.\n\n- Deduplication removes reads that originate from the same captured molecule.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities based on a given model for target enrichment sequencing: a multiplicative reduction factor and a minimum required sequencing depth. The solution will proceed in two parts, addressing each requirement sequentially.\n\nFirst, we address the quantification of the multiplicative reduction in effective unique coverage due to the duplication rate. The problem defines the expected on-target per-base depth as $p_{\\text{on}} D$, where $p_{\\text{on}}$ is the on-target fraction and $D$ is the mean raw per-base depth. It further states that the expected unique (deduplicated) per-base coverage is given by $(1 - d) p_{\\text{on}} D$, where $d$ is the duplication rate. The duplication rate represents the fraction of on-target reads that are identified as PCR duplicates and are thus removed. The factor $(1 - d)$ represents the fraction of on-target reads that are unique and remain after deduplication.\n\nTo find the multiplicative reduction, we compare the unique coverage to the on-target coverage before deduplication. The ratio of the unique coverage to the on-target coverage gives the factor by which the on-target read count is scaled down to yield the unique read count. This factor is the \"multiplicative reduction factor\".\n\nLet $C_{\\text{on-target}} = p_{\\text{on}} D$ be the on-target coverage and $C_{\\text{unique}} = (1 - d) p_{\\text{on}} D$ be the unique coverage. The multiplicative factor is the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\text{unique}}}{C_{\\text{on-target}}} = \\frac{(1 - d) p_{\\text{on}} D}{p_{\\text{on}} D} = 1 - d $$\nThe problem provides a duplication rate of $d = 0.30$. Substituting this value, we find the multiplicative reduction factor:\n$$ 1 - d = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 $$\nThis means that due to a duplication rate of $0.30$, the number of effective unique molecules is reduced to $0.70$ times the total number of on-target molecules.\n\nSecond, we compute the adjusted raw per-base depth $D$ required to meet the diagnostic threshold. The problem provides the inequality that defines this threshold:\n$$ f_{\\min} \\,(1 - d)\\, p_{\\text{on}}\\, D \\ge r $$\nHere, $f_{\\min}$ is the minimum reportable variant allele fraction, and $r$ is the minimum required number of unique variant-supporting molecules. To find the minimum depth $D$ that satisfies this condition, we solve the corresponding equality:\n$$ f_{\\min} \\,(1 - d)\\, p_{\\text{on}}\\, D = r $$\nWe can algebraically isolate $D$ by dividing both sides by the other factors:\n$$ D = \\frac{r}{f_{\\min} (1 - d) p_{\\text{on}}} $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Minimum variant-supporting molecules, $r = 20$\n- Minimum variant allele fraction, $f_{\\min} = 0.05$\n- Duplication rate, $d = 0.30$\n- On-target fraction, $p_{\\text{on}} = 0.75$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{20}{0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 0.75} $$\nFirst, we calculate the denominator:\n$$ 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 0.75 = 0.05 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.75 $$\n$$ 0.05 \\times 0.70 = 0.035 $$\n$$ 0.035 \\times 0.75 = 0.02625 $$\nNow, we can compute $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{20}{0.02625} \\approx 761.90476... $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $6$, $1$, and $9$. The fifth significant digit is $0$, so we round down, which means the fourth digit remains unchanged.\n$$ D \\approx 761.9 $$\nThis is the minimum raw per-base depth required to meet the laboratory's diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe final answer consists of two parts: the multiplicative reduction factor ($0.70$) and the adjusted depth ($761.9$).
