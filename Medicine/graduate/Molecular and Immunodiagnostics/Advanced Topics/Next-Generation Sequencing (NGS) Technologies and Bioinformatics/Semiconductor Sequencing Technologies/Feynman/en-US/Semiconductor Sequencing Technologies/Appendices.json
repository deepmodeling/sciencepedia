This is a fundamental and rigorously established theorem in probability theory, often called the Law of Rare Events. Its application to model bead loading in semiconductor sequencing platforms (like Ion Torrent) is a standard and scientifically accepted simplification. The premises are sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the derivation of a specific quantity (the expected fraction of singly-occupied wells) from a clearly defined set of initial assumptions (a Bernoulli counting scheme and its limit).

It is not ambiguous.\n7.  **Pseudo-Profound or Trivial**: The problem requires a standard but non-trivial derivation from first principles, testing fundamental knowledge of probability theory. It is not tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the expected fraction of wells containing exactly one bead. This is a two-part process: first, deriving the probability distribution for the number of beads in a single well, and second, relating this single-well probability to the multiwell fraction.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Single-Well Bead Count Distribution**\n\nLet `$X_n$` be the random variable representing the number of beads that have arrived in a single well after `$n$` discrete time subintervals. According to the problem statement, each subinterval is an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of `$p_n$` (where success is defined as a bead arrival). The total number of arrivals in `$n$` trials, `$X_n$`, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nX_n \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_n)\n$$\nThe probability mass function for `$X_n$` is given by:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nwhere `$k$` is the number of bead arrivals, `$k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$`.\n\nThe problem states that the continuous-time process is modeled by taking the limit as `$n \\to \\infty$`. We are given the condition that `$n p_n \\to \\mu$` in this limit. Let `$X$` be the random variable for the number of bead arrivals over the total duration `$T$` in this limiting case. We find the probability mass function of `$X$` by evaluating the limit of `$P(X_n = k)$` as `$n \\to \\infty$`.\n\n$$\nP(X = k) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P(X_n = k) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\binom{n}{k} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nWe analyze the components of this expression. First, expand the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}\n$$\nThe expression for the probability becomes:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this by associating factors of `$n$` with `$p_n$`:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdots \\frac{n-k+1}{n} \\right] (np_n)^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nNow, we take the limit as `$n \\to \\infty$`. We evaluate the limit of each term separately:\n1.  The term in square brackets is a product of `$k$` factors:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdots \\frac{n-k+1}{n} \\right] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ 1 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{n}\\right) \\right]\n    $$\n    Since `$k$` is a fixed integer, as `$n \\to \\infty$`, each term in the product approaches `$1$`. Thus, the limit of the entire product is `$1$`.\n\n2.  The `$(np_n)^k$` term, based on the given condition, approaches:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (np_n)^k = \\mu^k\n    $$\n\n3.  The term `$(1-p_n)^{n-k}$` is handled by substituting `$p_n = \\frac{np_n}{n}$`. In the limit, we can substitute `$\\mu$` for `$np_n$`:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1-p_n)^{n-k} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{np_n}{n}\\right)^{n-k} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{n-k}\n    $$\n    We can split this into two parts:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^n \\cdot \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{-k}\n    $$\n    The first part is a standard definition of the exponential function, `$\\exp(-\\mu)$`:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^n = \\exp(-\\mu)\n    $$\n    For the second part, since `$k$` is fixed, as `$n \\to \\infty$`, `$\\frac{\\mu}{n} \\to 0$`, and thus `$(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}) \\to 1$`. Therefore:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{-k} = 1^{-k} = 1\n    $$\n    So, the limit of the third term is `$\\exp(-\\mu)$`.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the probability mass function for `$X$`:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\cdot (1) \\cdot (\\mu^k) \\cdot (\\exp(-\\mu)) = \\frac{\\mu^k \\exp(-\\mu)}{k!}\n$$\nThis is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution with parameter `$\\mu$`. The problem asks for the probability that a well contains *exactly one* bead, which corresponds to `$k=1$`.\n$$\nP(X=1) = \\frac{\\mu^1 \\exp(-\\mu)}{1!} = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Justification for the Multiwell Fraction**\n\nThe quantity `$p = P(X=1) = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$` is the probability that a *single, specific* well contains exactly one bead. The problem asks for the *expected fraction* of all `$W$` wells that contain exactly one bead.\n\nLet `$Y_i$` be an indicator random variable for the `$i$`-th well, where `$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, W\\}$`. We define `$Y_i$` as:\n$$\nY_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if well } i \\text{ contains exactly one bead} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe bead loading process is independent for each well, so the random variables `$Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_W$` are independent and identically distributed. The probability of success for each is `$p = P(Y_i=1) = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$`.\n\nThe total number of wells with exactly one bead is the sum of these indicator variables: `$N_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$`.\nThe fraction of wells with one bead is `$F_1 = \\frac{N_1}{W} = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$`.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* fraction. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[F_1] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} E[Y_i]\n$$\nThe expected value of an indicator random variable is the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$\nE[Y_i] = 1 \\cdot P(Y_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(Y_i=0) = P(Y_i=1) = p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)\n$$\nSince this is true for all `$i$`, the sum becomes:\n$$\nE[F_1] = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} p = \\frac{1}{W} (Wp) = p\n$$\nTherefore, the expected fraction of wells containing exactly one bead is `$p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$`.\n\nThe problem also requires justification using a law of large numbers. For a large number of wells `$W$` (as is typical for a CMOS semiconductor sequencing chip), the (Weak) Law of Large Numbers states that the sample average `$F_1 = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$` converges in probability to the true expectation `$E[Y_i] = p$`. This means that for a large `$W$`, the observed fraction of singly-occupied wells will be very close to its expected value, `$p$`. Thus, `$p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$` is the theoretically predicted and experimentally expected fraction.\n\nThe final analytical expression for the expected fraction is solely a function of `$\\mu$`.",

Multi-occupied wells (two or more particles) can in some cases be algorithmically salvaged but at substantial loss of accuracy and downstream utility, while empty wells produce no useful reads and waste sequencing capacity. To model the trade-off between maximizing single occupancy and maximizing total productive wells, define an expected per-well utility function $U(\\mu)$ by weighting occupancy classes as follows:\n- Assign an expected utility of $u_{1}$ to singleton wells (exactly one particle), reflecting the expected yield and accuracy of single-occupancy signals.\n- Assign an expected utility of $u_{\\ge 2}$ to multi-occupied wells (two or more particles), capturing any net benefit from salvage minus penalties for cross-talk and miscalls. This quantity may be negative.\n- Assign a positive cost $u_{0}$ to empty wells (zero particles), reflecting wasted capacity, so that this enters $U(\\mu)$ with a negative sign.\n\nAssume independence across wells and that the per-well utility is additive in expectation.

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the mean occupancy, $\\mu$, that maximizes a given utility function, $U(\\mu)$, for a semiconductor sequencing platform where particle loading into microwells follows a Poisson distribution.\n\nFirst, we must construct the expected per-well utility function, $U(\\mu)$, based on the provided framework. The number of particles, $k$, in a given well is a Poisson random variable with mean $\\mu$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ particles is given by $P_{k}(\\mu) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu)\\mu^{k}}{k!}$.\n\nThe utility function is an expectation over the discrete random variable $k$. The possible outcomes for $k$ are partitioned into three classes, each with a specific utility or cost:\n1.  Empty well ($k=0$): Probability $P_{0}(\\mu)$, with an associated cost $u_{0}$.

In flows that produce homopolymers of length $n$, polymerase catalyzes $n$ incorporations in a single nucleotide injection, releasing $n$ protons. However, the measured voltage response is known to be nonlinear with $n$ due to physical and biochemical limits: finite buffer capacity (Henderson–Hasselbalch acid–base equilibrium), diffusion-limited transport of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ to the sensing oxide (Fick’s law), finite readout integration time and first-order dynamics of the sensing interface, and saturation of enzymatic throughput at high instantaneous substrate levels (Michaelis–Menten kinetics).\n\nConsider the following scenario.

It accurately describes the fundamental principles of ISFET-based DNA sequencing, including proton release upon nucleotide incorporation, the Nernstian sensor response, and the well-documented physical and biochemical sources of signal saturation (buffering, diffusion, enzyme kinetics). These are established concepts in the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a specific mathematical model and a dataset, asking for an evaluation of several statements. This is a well-defined task in data modeling and analysis. A unique set of correct/incorrect statements can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, scientific language. It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided data is sufficient to test the model and evaluate the statements. There are no internal contradictions. The data shows a clear saturating trend ($V(2)-V(1) = 0.10$, $V(4)-V(2) = 0.13$, $V(8)-V(4) = 0.13$, wait, let me recheck the subtractions: $V(1)=0.12$, $V(2)=0.22$, $V(4)=0.35$, $V(8)=0.48$. $V(2)-V(1)=0.10$. The increase for the next two bases from $n=2$ to $n=4$ is $V(4)-V(2)=0.13$. The increase for the next four bases from $n=4$ to $n=8$ is $V(8)-V(4)=0.13$. The incremental voltage per base is decreasing: $0.12/1=0.12$, $0.10/1=0.10$ for the 2nd base, $0.13/2=0.065$ for 3rd and 4th, $0.13/4=0.0325$ for 5th-8th. The data shows clear saturation, consistent with the problem description.\n- **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Model and Underlying Principles\n\nThe problem asks to assess the origin of nonlinearity and the plausibility of the model $V(n) = a(1 - e^{-bn})$. The sources of nonlinearity are all saturation effects. A simple conceptual model for such effects is that the incremental change in signal is proportional to the remaining capacity. Let $V(n)$ be the voltage signal for a homopolymer of length $n$. Let $a$ be the maximum possible voltage signal (asymptotic saturation). The \"remaining capacity\" is $a - V(n)$. If the voltage increase for the $(n+1)$-th incorporation is proportional to this remaining capacity, we can write a difference equation:\n$$ V(n+1) - V(n) = k(a - V(n)) $$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant. This is a linear first-order difference equation, $V(n+1) = (1-k)V(n) + ka$. With the initial condition $V(0)=0$, the solution is:\n$$ V(n) = a(1 - (1-k)^n) $$\nBy defining $e^{-b} = 1-k$, where $b = -\\ln(1-k)$, the model becomes:\n$$ V(n) = a(1 - (e^{-b})^n) = a(1 - e^{-bn}) $$\nThis demonstrates that the proposed exponential saturation model is a direct and plausible consequence of a first-order saturation hypothesis, which serves as a reasonable abstraction for the combined effects of finite buffering, transport limitations, and other saturation phenomena described.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The nonlinearity in $V(n)$ arises from first-order saturation effects spanning buffering, transport, and ISFET interface dynamics; modeling the incremental captured proton signal per incorporation as a constant fraction of the remaining capacity leads to a discrete first-order difference equation with solution of the form $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$, in which $a$ is the asymptotic maximum voltage and $b$ aggregates effective sensitivity and capacity.**\n\nAs derived above, the model $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$ is precisely the solution to a first-order difference equation describing a process where the incremental gain is proportional to the remaining capacity. This is a classic model for saturation phenomena. The parameter $a$ represents the limit of $V(n)$ as $n \\to \\infty$, so it is the asymptotic maximum voltage. The parameter $b$ is related to the constant of proportionality $k$, which dictates how quickly the signal approaches saturation; it acts as an effective parameter lumping together all the complex underlying rate-limiting and capacity-limiting factors. This statement is a correct and insightful description of the model's origin and interpretation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because proton release increases linearly with $n$, the output must remain linear for large $n$; the appropriate calibration near $n\\to\\infty$ is $V(n)=c\\,n$ with constant $c$, and any saturation model such as $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$ will under-correct high-$n$ measurements.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While it is true that the number of protons released is linear with $n$, the problem statement explicitly details multiple physical reasons (finite buffer capacity, diffusion limits, enzyme saturation) why the *measured voltage signal* is *not* linear with $n$. These effects cause the system to saturate. Claiming that the output \"must remain linear for large $n$\" directly contradicts the provided physical description and the observed data, which clearly show diminishing returns. A saturation model is required to accurately model the response, whereas a linear model $V(n)=c n$ would fail catastrophically for large $n$ by predicting unbounded voltage.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Linearizing the model by plotting $-\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V(n)}{a}\\right)$ against $n$ yields a line of slope $b$. With the dataset $V(1)=0.12$, $V(2)=0.22$, $V(4)=0.35$, $V(8)=0.48$, a consistent fit is obtained for approximately $a\\approx 0.55$ volts and $b\\approx 0.25$ per base.**\n\nFirst, we verify the linearization. Rearranging the model $V = a(1 - e^{-bn})$ gives $\\frac{V}{a} = 1 - e^{-bn}$, then $1 - \\frac{V}{a} = e^{-bn}$, and taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V}{a}\\right) = -bn$. Finally, multiplying by $-1$ gives $-\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right) = bn$. This confirms that a plot of $Y = -\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right)$ versus $X = n$ should be a straight line through the origin with slope $b$.\n\nNext, we test the proposed parameter values $a = 0.55$ and $b = 0.25$ with the given data. We calculate the value of $b$ for each data point using $b = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - V(n)/a)}{n}$.\n- For $n=1, V(1)=0.12$: $b_1 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.12/0.55)}{1} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.2182)}{1} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.7818)}{1} \\approx 0.246$.\n- For $n=2, V(2)=0.22$: $b_2 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.22/0.55)}{2} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.4)}{2} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.6)}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.5108}{2} \\approx 0.255$.\n- For $n=4, V(4)=0.35$: $b_4 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.35/0.55)}{4} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.6364)}{4} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.3636)}{4} \\approx \\frac{1.0116}{4} \\approx 0.253$.\n- For $n=8, V(8)=0.48$: $b_8 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.48/0.55)}{8} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.8727)}{8} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.1273)}{8} \\approx \\frac{2.0614}{8} \\approx 0.258$.\n\nThe calculated values for $b$ are $\\{0.246, 0.255, 0.253, 0.258\\}$, all of which are very close to the proposed value of $b \\approx 0.25$. This shows a consistent fit of the model with the given parameters to the experimental data.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For the model $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$, the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dn}=ab\\,e^{-bn}$ is constant with respect to $n$, implying a linear response; therefore this model cannot capture saturation in homopolymer detection.**\n\nThe derivative calculation is correct:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left( a - ae^{-bn} \\right) = -a(-b)e^{-bn} = ab\\,e^{-bn} $$\nHowever, the statement asserts that this derivative is \"constant with respect to $n$\". This is false. The derivative contains the term $e^{-bn}$, which is a function of $n$. Since $b > 0$, as $n$ increases, the exponential term $e^{-bn}$ decreases towards $0$. This means the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dn}$ (the local sensitivity or slope) decreases as $n$ increases. A decreasing slope is the mathematical definition of saturation or diminishing returns. A linear response would have a constant derivative. Therefore, the model is not only capable of capturing saturation but is specifically designed to do so. The conclusion of the statement is based on a false premise.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. To correct the nonlinearity, the inverse mapping $n(V)=-\\frac{1}{b}\\,\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right)$ is used to estimate $n$ from a measured voltage. With $a=0.55$ volts and $b=0.25$ per base, a measured voltage of $V=0.35$ volts corresponds to $n\\approx 4.0$.**\n\nFirst, we check the derivation of the inverse mapping. Starting from $V = a(1-e^{-bn})$, we solve for $n$. As shown in the analysis for option C, this leads to $bn = -\\ln(1 - V/a)$. Dividing by $b$ gives the inverse function:\n$$ n(V) = -\\frac{1}{b} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V}{a}\\right) $$\nThe formula is correct. Now we apply it to the given values: $V = 0.35$ V, $a = 0.55$ V, and $b = 0.25$ per base.\n$$ n(0.35) = -\\frac{1}{0.25} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{0.35}{0.55}\\right) $$\n$$ n(0.35) = -4 \\times \\ln\\left(1 - 0.63636...\\right) $$\n$$ n(0.35) = -4 \\times \\ln(0.36363...) $$\nUsing a calculator, $\\ln(0.36363...) \\approx -1.0116$.\n$$ n(0.35) \\approx -4 \\times (-1.0116) \\approx 4.0464 $$\nThe calculated value $n \\approx 4.0464$ is indeed approximately $4.0$. This is expected, as the input data point was $V(4) = 0.35$. The calculation confirms the validity of the inverse function and the parameters.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
