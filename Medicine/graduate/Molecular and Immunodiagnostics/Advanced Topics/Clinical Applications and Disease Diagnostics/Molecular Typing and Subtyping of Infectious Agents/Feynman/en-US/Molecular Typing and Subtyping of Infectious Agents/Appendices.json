The Hunter–Gaston discriminatory index (HGI), denoted by $D$, is defined as the probability that two isolates chosen uniformly at random without replacement from the population will be assigned to different sequence types under the typing scheme. Consider an MLST dataset comprising $N=60$ isolates partitioned into $k=10$ sequence types with counts given by $[12, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$.

Express your final answer as an exact fraction.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the Hunter–Gaston discriminatory index, denoted by $D$, for a given dataset of isolates. The dataset consists of a total of $N=60$ isolates, which are partitioned into $k=10$ distinct sequence types. The number of isolates in each sequence type, denoted by $n_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, k$, is given by the list $[12, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$. We verify that the sum of these counts equals the total number of isolates:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} n_i = 12 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 60 = N $$\nThe data is self-consistent and sufficient for the calculation.\n\nThe problem defines the Hunter–Gaston index $D$ as the probability that two isolates chosen uniformly at random without replacement from the population will be assigned to different sequence types. It is further specified that $D$ should be computed as the complement of the probability that two randomly selected isolates belong to the *same* sequence type.\n\nLet $P(\\text{same})$ be the probability that two isolates selected uniformly at random and without replacement belong to the same sequence type. The discriminatory index $D$ is then given by:\n$$ D = 1 - P(\\text{same}) $$\n\nTo calculate $P(\\text{same})$, we first determine the total number of ways to choose two distinct isolates from the population of $N$ isolates. This is a combination problem, and the total number of pairs is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$.\nWith $N=60$, the total number of possible pairs is:\n$$ \\binom{N}{2} = \\binom{60}{2} = \\frac{60 \\times (60-1)}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{60 \\times 59}{2} = 30 \\times 59 = 1770 $$\n\nNext, we determine the number of pairs of isolates that belong to the same sequence type. This is found by summing the number of ways to choose two isolates from within each sequence type. For a sequence type $i$ with $n_i$ isolates, the number of ways to choose two isolates is $\\binom{n_i}{2}$. The total number of same-type pairs is the sum over all $k$ types:\n$$ \\text{Number of same-type pairs} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{n_i}{2} $$\nThe given counts are $n_1=12$, $n_2=10$, $n_3=9$, $n_4=8$, $n_5=6$, $n_6=5$, $n_7=4$, $n_8=3$, $n_9=2$, and $n_{10}=1$.

First, we cancel a factor of $10$:\n$$ P(\\text{same}) = \\frac{21}{177} $$\nTo simplify further, we test for common divisors.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the Wallace coefficient from typing scheme $A$ to typing scheme $B$, denoted as $W_{A\\to B}$. The probabilistic definition provided is that $W_{A\\to B}$ is the probability that two isolates that are assigned to the same type under scheme $A$ are also assigned to the same type under scheme $B$. This can be formally expressed using combinatorics as the ratio of the number of pairs of isolates that are co-classified in the same type by both schemes to the total number of pairs co-classified by scheme $A$.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of isolates, which is given as $N=50$.

The total count of such pairs is the sum of pairs from each cell:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = \\sum_{i,j} \\binom{n_{ij}}{2}\n$$\nThe denominator is the total number of pairs of isolates that are concordant in scheme $A$. This is found by considering the total number of isolates in each type of scheme $A$, which are given by the row sums $R_i = \\sum_{j} n_{ij}$. The total number of pairs concordant in scheme $A$ is the sum of pairs from each row:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sum_{i} \\binom{R_i}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the formula for the Wallace coefficient is:\n$$\nW_{A\\to B} = \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} \\binom{n_{ij}}{2}}{\\sum_{i} \\binom{R_i}{2}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerator.

Dividing by $7$: $287 \\div 7 = 41$. Since $41$ is a prime number, the prime factorization of $287$ is $7 \\times 41$.\n$$\nW_{A\\to B} = \\frac{7 \\times 41}{2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7} = \\frac{41}{2 \\times 25} = \\frac{41}{50}\n$$\n\nRegarding the conceptual explanation, the directionality of $W_{A\\to B}$ is crucial. It measures the concordance from a \"base\" partitioning ($A$) to a \"compared\" partitioning ($B$). It answers the question: \"Given that two isolates are considered the same by scheme $A$, what is the probability that they are also considered the same by scheme $B$?\" A high value of $W_{A\\to B}$ (close to $1$) implies that the clusters defined by scheme $A$ are largely preserved (or are subsets of clusters) in scheme $B$. In epidemiological terms, it indicates that scheme $B$ has a discriminatory power that is at least as high as scheme $A$. If scheme $B$ further subdivides the clusters of scheme $A$, $W_{A\\to B}$ will be less than $1$. If scheme $B$ lumps together distinct clusters from scheme $A$, $W_{A\\to B}$ will also be less than $1$.\n\nThe reason $W_{A\\to B}$ need not equal $W_{B\\to A}$ is that the coefficients are directional and their denominators are different. While both coefficients share the same numerator (the number of pairs concordant in both schemes, $\\sum_{i,j} \\binom{n_{ij}}{2}$), their denominators are conditioned on the pairs being concordant in one scheme or the other. Specifically, the denominator of $W_{A\\to B}$ is the number of pairs concordant in scheme $A$ ($\\sum_i \\binom{R_i}{2}$), whereas the denominator of $W_{B\\to A}$ is the number of pairs concordant in scheme $B$ ($\\sum_j \\binom{C_j}{2}$, where $C_j$ are the column sums). Unless the total number of pairs within clusters in scheme $A$ is identical to the total number of pairs within clusters in scheme $B$, the two Wallace coefficients will be different. This asymmetry correctly captures the directional nature of concordance; for instance, a high-resolution typing scheme ($B$) might be perfectly predictive of a low-resolution scheme's ($A$) results (so $W_{B\\to A}=1$, as all isolates in a B-cluster are in the same A-cluster), but the reverse would not be true ($W_{A\\to B}<1$, as an A-cluster may be split into multiple B-clusters).",

The maximum is $9$.\n        -   Maximum distance involving $X$: $d(X,A_3)=5$ and $d(X,B_3)=5$.\n    -   The global maximum among all pairwise distances is $9$. Since all isolates are in the same cluster, the maximum pairwise distance within this cluster is $9$. Note that even though $d(A_1, B_1)=9 > T$, these two isolates are still in the same cluster due to the path of connections $(A_1, A_2)$, $(A_2, X)$, $(X, B_2)$, $(B_2, B_1)$, where each edge corresponds to a distance $\\le T$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A.

At $T=3$, single-linkage yields $2$ clusters, $\\{A_1,A_2,A_3\\}$ and $\\{B_1,B_2,B_3,X\\}$, because at least one cross-outbreak pair has $d(i,j)>3$; the maximum pairwise SNP distance within any cluster is $3$.**\n    -   This is incorrect. It fails to recognize the link $(X, A_2)$ since $d(X,A_2)=3 \\le T$. This link merges the $A$ group with $X$, which in turn is linked to the $B$ group. Thus, there is only $1$ cluster, not $2$. Furthermore, the claim that the max pairwise distance is $3$ is false; for example, within its proposed $\\{B_1,B_2,B_3,X\\}$ cluster, $d(X,B_1)=4$.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. At $T=3$, single-linkage yields $1$ cluster containing all $7$ isolates, but the maximum pairwise SNP distance within that cluster is $3$ because single-linkage enforces a pairwise threshold for all co-clustered members.**\n    -   The first part, stating $1$ cluster, is correct. However, the reasoning for the maximum pairwise distance is fundamentally wrong. It incorrectly describes complete-linkage clustering, where all members of a cluster must be within distance $T$ of all other members. The problem statement itself clarifies that single-linkage \"depends only on the existence of paths of edges... not on pairwise constraints between all members\". The maximum pairwise distance is $9$, not $3$.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. At $T=3$, single-linkage yields $3$ clusters because $d(X,A_1)=4$ and $d(X,B_1)=4$ prevent $X$ from connecting both outbreaks; the maximum pairwise SNP distance within each cluster is $\\le 3$.**\n    -   This is incorrect. It wrongly concludes that $X$ fails to connect the outbreaks by focusing only on the non-linking pairs $(X, A_1)$ and $(X, B_1)$. It ignores the crucial linking pairs $(X, A_2)$ and $(X, B_2)$, which have a distance of $3$ and thus form edges that merge the clusters. The conclusion of $3$ clusters (presumably $\\{A_1,A_2,A_3\\}$, $\\{B_1,B_2,B_3\\}$, and $\\{X\\})$ is false.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
