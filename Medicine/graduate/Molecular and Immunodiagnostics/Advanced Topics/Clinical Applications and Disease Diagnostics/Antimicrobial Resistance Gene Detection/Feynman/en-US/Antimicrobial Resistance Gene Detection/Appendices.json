            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n\n**Assay and Targets:**\n- A multiplex real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay.\n- Targets: $mecA$, $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$, $vanA$.\n- An Internal Amplification Control (IAC) is included in every well.\n\n**Controls:**\n- No Template Control (NTC)\n- Negative Extraction Control (NEC)\n- Positive Control (PC) containing all three AMR targets at $10^4$ copies per reaction.\n- A five-point, $10$-fold dilution standard curve for $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$.\n\n**SOP Acceptance Criteria:**\n- **NTC criterion:** No AMR target amplification permitted. Failure is defined as any exponential amplification with a quantification cycle ($C_q$) value $C_q \\le 40$ for any AMR target. The IAC must amplify with $C_q$ between $26$ and $32$.\n- **NEC criterion:** No AMR target amplification permitted. Failure is defined as any exponential amplification with $C_q \\le 40$ for any AMR target. The IAC must amplify with $C_q$ between $26$ and $32$.\n- **PC criterion (at $10^4$ copies/reaction):**\n    - $mecA$: expected $C_q$ window is $22.0 \\pm 1.0$ (i.e., $[21.0, 23.0]$).\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$: expected $C_q$ window is $24.0 \\pm 1.0$ (i.e., $[23.0, 25.0]$).\n    - $vanA$: expected $C_q$ window is $23.0 \\pm 1.0$ (i.e., $[22.0, 24.0]$).\n    - Duplicate wells must have $\\Delta C_q \\le 0.5$.\n    - IAC may be delayed or suppressed.\n- **Standard curve ($bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$) criterion:**\n    - Slope between $-3.1$ and $-3.6$.\n    - Coefficient of determination ($R^2$) $\\ge 0.99$.\n    - $y$-intercept within $36 \\pm 2$ (i.e., $[34, 38]$).\n    - Duplicate wells at each dilution must have $\\Delta C_q \\le 0.5$.\n- **IAC in non-target wells criterion:** In wells without AMR target amplification, IAC $C_q$ must be between $26$ and $32$.\n- **Run-level acceptance criterion:** All relevant controls for all targets must meet their criteria. Any control failure for any AMR target requires rejection of the entire run.\n\n**Obtained Control Outcomes:**\n- **NTC (duplicates):**\n    - $mecA$: undetermined/undetermined\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$: $C_q = 39.8/39.9$\n    - $vanA$: undetermined/undetermined\n    - IAC: $C_q = 28.7/28.9$\n- **NEC (duplicates):**\n    - $mecA$: undetermined/undetermined\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$: undetermined/undetermined\n    - $vanA$: undetermined/undetermined\n    - IAC: $C_q = 29.3/29.0$\n- **PC ($10^4$ copies/reaction, duplicates):**\n    - $mecA$: $C_q = 22.3/22.6$\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$: $C_q = 24.5/24.7$\n    - $vanA$: $C_q = 23.2/23.3$\n    - IAC: $C_q = 35.2/35.5$\n- **$bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ standard curve summary:**\n    - Slope: $-3.55$\n    - $R^2$: $0.995$\n    - $y$-intercept: $37.9$\n    - Maximum duplicate $\\Delta C_q$: $0.3$\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard quality control scenario for a molecular diagnostic assay, a routine and critical process in clinical laboratories.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The principles of qPCR, including the use of $C_q$ values, standard curves, controls (NTC, NEC, PC, IAC), and acceptance criteria (slope, $R^2$, $C_q$ ranges) are fundamental to the field of molecular diagnostics. The target genes ($mecA$, $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$, $vanA$) are well-established and clinically significant antimicrobial resistance markers.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of SOP criteria and a complete set of experimental results. The question asks for a definitive decision (accept/reject) based on a direct comparison of the results to the criteria. A unique, logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is neutral and devoid of subjective or opinion-based statements. The acceptance criteria are defined with precise numerical values, and the results are given as quantitative data.\n\nThe problem setup is complete, coherent, and internally consistent. It does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and presents a realistic scenario.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by systematically evaluating the provided control outcomes against the SOP criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe run-level decision must be made by comparing each control's outcome to the predefined SOP criteria.\n\n**1. No Template Control (NTC) Evaluation:**\n- **SOP Criterion:** No AMR target amplification with $C_q \\le 40$. IAC $C_q$ must be between $26$ and $32$.\n- **Observed Outcome:**\n    - $mecA$ and $vanA$ are \"undetermined,\" which means no amplification was detected. This passes the criterion.\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ shows amplification with $C_q$ values of $39.8$ and $39.9$. The criterion for failure is \"any exponential amplification with quantification cycle ($C_q$) value $C_q \\le 40$\". Since both $39.8 \\le 40$ and $39.9 \\le 40$, this constitutes a **failure** for the $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ target. This result indicates probable low-level contamination.\n    - IAC $C_q$ values are $28.7$ and $28.9$. Both are within the required range of $[26, 32]$. The IAC passes its criterion.\n- **NTC Verdict:** **FAIL**. The amplification of $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ violates the NTC acceptance criterion.\n\n**2. Negative Extraction Control (NEC) Evaluation:**\n- **SOP Criterion:** No AMR target amplification with $C_q \\le 40$. IAC $C_q$ must be between $26$ and $32$.\n- **Observed Outcome:** All AMR targets are \"undetermined.\" The IAC $C_q$ values are $29.3$ and $29.0$. Both are within the required range of $[26, 32]$.\n- **NEC Verdict:** **PASS**. All criteria are met. This suggests the contamination seen in the NTC is not from the extraction reagents.\n\n**3. Positive Control (PC) Evaluation:**\n- **SOP Criterion:** $mecA$ $C_q \\in [21.0, 23.0]$, $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ $C_q \\in [23.0, 25.0]$, $vanA$ $C_q \\in [22.0, 24.0]$. For all targets, duplicate $\\Delta C_q \\le 0.5$. IAC amplification is not evaluated.\n- **Observed Outcome:**\n    - $mecA$: $C_q$s are $22.3$ and $22.6$. Both are within $[21.0, 23.0]$. $\\Delta C_q = |22.6 - 22.3| = 0.3$, which is $\\le 0.5$. This passes.\n    - $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$: $C_q$s are $24.5$ and $24.7$. Both are within $[23.0, 25.0]$. $\\Delta C_q = |24.7 - 24.5| = 0.2$, which is $\\le 0.5$. This passes.\n    - $vanA$: $C_q$s are $23.2$ and $23.3$. Both are within $[22.0, 24.0]$. $\\Delta C_q = |23.3 - 23.2| = 0.1$, which is $\\le 0.5$. This passes.\n- **PC Verdict:** **PASS**. All criteria are met.\n\n**4. $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ Standard Curve Evaluation:**\n- **SOP Criterion:** Slope $\\in [-3.6, -3.1]$, $R^2 \\ge 0.99$, $y$-intercept $\\in [34, 38]$, and maximum duplicate $\\Delta C_q \\le 0.5$.\n- **Observed Outcome:**\n    - Slope = $-3.55$. This is within the accepted range.\n    - $R^2 = 0.995$. This is $\\ge 0.99$.\n    - $y$-intercept = $37.9$. This is within the accepted range of $[34, 38]$.\n    - Maximum duplicate $\\Delta C_q = 0.3$. This is $\\le 0.5$.\n- **Standard Curve Verdict:** **PASS**. All criteria are met.\n\n**5. Run-Level Decision:**\n- **SOP Criterion:** \"All relevant controls for all targets must meet their acceptance criteria; any control failure for any AMR target requires rejection of the entire run.\"\n- **Conclusion:** The NTC failed due to amplification of the $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ target. According to the explicitly stated run-level acceptance rule, this single failure mandates the rejection of the entire run.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Accept the run; all control criteria are satisfied.**\n**Incorrect.** This is false. The No Template Control (NTC) failed for the $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ target, as it showed amplification with $C_q$ values ($C_q=39.8/39.9$) that are less than or equal to the failure cutoff of $C_q=40$.\n\n**B. Reject the run due to nonconforming standard curve efficiency.**\n**Incorrect.** The standard curve parameters are all within the SOP--defined acceptable ranges. The slope of $-3.55$ is between $-3.1$ and $-3.6$. The $R^2$ of $0.995$ is $\\ge 0.99$. The $y$-intercept of $37.9$ is within $36 \\pm 2$. The amplification efficiency, calculated as $E = 10^{-1/\\text{slope}} - 1 = 10^{-1/(-3.55)} - 1 \\approx 0.913$ or $91.3\\%$, falls within the high-quality range generally accepted for qPCR (typically $90\\%-110\\%$), which is consistent with the accepted slope range. Therefore, the standard curve is conforming, not nonconforming.\n\n**C. Reject the run due to contamination indicated by blaCTX-M amplification in the No Template Control; repeat the entire run.**\n**Correct.** This option accurately identifies the specific failure: the late but definite amplification of $bla_{\\text{CTX-M}}$ in the NTC. Per the SOP, any amplification with $C_q \\le 40$ in a negative control is a failure. This failure is interpreted as evidence of contamination. The run-level acceptance criterion is strict: \"any control failure ... requires rejection of the entire run.\" Therefore, rejecting the entire run is the correct course of action.\n\n**D. Accept results for mecA and vanA, but reject only blaCTX-M results; no need to repeat the entire run.**\n**Incorrect.** This action contradicts the explicit run-level acceptance criterion in the SOP, which states that \"any control failure for any AMR target requires rejection of the entire run.\" In a clinical diagnostic setting, a contamination event for one target casts doubt on the integrity of the entire plate setup and all results obtained from it. It is not permissible to selectively accept results from a failed run.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), internally consistent, and well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the calculation of the extraction recovery fraction, and second, the calculation of the recovery-corrected antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene concentration.\n\nThe relationship between the quantification cycle ($C_q$) and the number of template copies per reaction ($N$) is given by the linear model:\n$$C_{q} = \\alpha - \\beta \\log_{10}(N)$$\nwhere the parameters are given as $\\alpha = 38.0$ and $\\beta = 3.32$. This equation can be rearranged to solve for the number of copies, $N$:\n$$\\log_{10}(N) = \\frac{\\alpha - C_q}{\\beta}$$\n$$N = 10^{\\frac{\\alpha - C_q}{\\beta}}$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Extraction Recovery Fraction ($f_{\\text{rec}}$)**\n\nThe extraction recovery fraction, $f_{\\text{rec}}$, is defined as the ratio of the total number of spike-in control copies recovered in the final eluate ($S_{\\text{out}}$) to the total number of copies initially added to the sample ($S_{\\text{in}}$).\n$$f_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{out}}}{S_{\\text{in}}}$$\nFirst, we determine the number of spike-in copies per qPCR reaction, $N_{\\text{spike}}$, using the measured mean quantification cycle, $\\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}} = 25.00$.\n$$N_{\\text{spike}} = 10^{\\frac{\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}}}{\\beta}} = 10^{\\frac{38.0 - 25.00}{3.32}} = 10^{\\frac{13.00}{3.32}}$$\nThis value, $N_{\\text{spike}}$, is the number of copies present in the volume of eluate used for a single reaction, $V_{\\text{rxn}} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. To find the total number of spike-in copies recovered in the entire eluate volume, $V_{\\text{elute}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$, we scale $N_{\\text{spike}}$ by the ratio of the volumes.\n$$S_{\\text{out}} = N_{\\text{spike}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}}$$\nThe initial number of spike-in copies added to the sample is given as $S_{\\text{in}} = 2.00 \\times 10^7$. We can now formulate the expression for $f_{\\text{rec}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{out}}}{S_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\text{in}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}} \\right) N_{\\text{spike}} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\text{in}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}} \\right) 10^{\\frac{\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}}}{\\beta}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$f_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{1}{2.00 \\times 10^7} \\left( \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\right) 10^{\\frac{13.00}{3.32}} = \\frac{50}{2.00 \\times 10^7} \\cdot 10^{3.91566...}$$\n$$f_{\\text{rec}} = (2.5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (8234.2...) \\approx 0.0205855$$\nThe extraction recovery is approximately $2.06\\%$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Recovery-Corrected AMR Gene Concentration**\n\nThe final goal is to determine the concentration of the AMR gene in the original wastewater sample, $C_{\\text{AMR}}$, in units of copies per milliliter.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of AMR gene copies per qPCR reaction, $N_{\\text{AMR}}$, using its measured mean quantification cycle, $\\overline{C_{q,\\text{AMR}}} = 30.00$.\n$$N_{\\text{AMR}} = 10^{\\frac{\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{AMR}}}}{\\beta}} = 10^{\\frac{38.0 - 30.00}{3.32}} = 10^{\\frac{8.00}{3.32}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of AMR gene copies present in the eluate, $A_{\\text{elute}}$, by scaling $N_{\\text{AMR}}$ by the volume ratio.\n$$A_{\\text{elute}} = N_{\\text{AMR}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}}$$\n\nThis value, $A_{\\text{elute}}$, represents the number of copies recovered after extraction. Based on the assumption that the AMR target and the spike-in control have the same extraction recovery, we can find the original number of AMR copies in the sample, $A_{\\text{sample}}$, by dividing the recovered amount by the recovery fraction $f_{\\text{rec}}$.\n$$A_{\\text{sample}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{elute}}}{f_{\\text{rec}}}$$\n\nThe concentration, $C_{\\text{AMR}}$, is the total number of copies in the original sample, $A_{\\text{sample}}$, divided by the original sample volume, $V_{\\text{sample}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{sample}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{sample}}} \\frac{A_{\\text{elute}}}{f_{\\text{rec}}}$$\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $A_{\\text{elute}}$ and $f_{\\text{rec}}$ to obtain a comprehensive formula:\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{sample}}} \\frac{N_{\\text{AMR}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{S_{\\text{in}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}} \\right) N_{\\text{spike}}}$$\nThe dilution factor $\\frac{V_{\\text{elute}}}{V_{\\text{rxn}}}$ cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly. This cancellation is expected, as the ratio of target to spike-in copies is constant throughout the post-extraction dilutions.\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{sample}}} \\frac{N_{\\text{AMR}} \\cdot S_{\\text{in}}}{N_{\\text{spike}}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} \\frac{N_{\\text{AMR}}}{N_{\\text{spike}}}$$\nNow, substituting the exponential forms of $N_{\\text{AMR}}$ and $N_{\\text{spike}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} \\frac{10^{(\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{AMR}}})/\\beta}}{10^{(\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}})/\\beta}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} 10^{\\frac{(\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{AMR}}}) - (\\alpha - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}})}{\\beta}}$$\nThe intercept $\\alpha$ also cancels, yielding the final, elegant relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} 10^{\\frac{\\overline{C_{q,\\text{spike}}} - \\overline{C_{q,\\text{AMR}}}}{\\beta}}$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the target concentration can be determined from the spike-in concentration, the sample volume, and the difference in quantification cycles ($\\Delta C_q$) between the spike-in and the target.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{copies}}{200\\,\\mathrm{mL}} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{25.00 - 30.00}{3.32}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = (1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{copies/mL}) \\cdot 10^{\\frac{-5.00}{3.32}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} = (1.00 \\times 10^5) \\cdot 10^{-1.506024...} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^5) \\cdot 0.0311863$$\n$$C_{\\text{AMR}} \\approx 3118.63\\,\\text{copies/mL}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $3120\\,\\text{copies/mL}$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard procedure for determining the analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection, LOD) and functional sensitivity (Limit of Quantification, LOQ) of a quantitative molecular assay. The use of probit analysis for LOD and coefficient of variation (CV) for LOQ are established conventions in diagnostics. The provided data and models are realistic and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be determined.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{LOQ}}}{N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}}$. This requires the separate calculation of the Limit of Detection, $N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$, and the Limit of Quantification, $N_{\\mathrm{LOQ}}$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Limit of Detection ($N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$)**\n\nThe LOD is determined using probit analysis based on the provided detection data. The model is an unweighted simple linear fit of the form:\n$$ \\Phi^{-1}(P) = a + b\\,\\log_{10}(N) $$\nwhere $P=k/n$ is the observed probability of detection, $N$ is the number of target copies, $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (the probit function), and $a$ and $b$ are the regression coefficients.\n\nLet $x = \\log_{10}(N)$ and $y = \\Phi^{-1}(P)$. We first transform the given data:\n- For $N_1=0.25$, $n_1=40$, $k_1=1$:\n  $x_1 = \\log_{10}(0.25) \\approx -0.60206$\n  $P_1 = 1/40 = 0.025$\n  $y_1 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.025) \\approx -1.95996$\n- For $N_2=0.50$, $n_2=40$, $k_2=6$:\n  $x_2 = \\log_{10}(0.50) \\approx -0.30103$\n  $P_2 = 6/40 = 0.15$\n  $y_2 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.15) \\approx -1.03643$\n- For $N_3=1.00$, $n_3=40$, $k_3=20$:\n  $x_3 = \\log_{10}(1.00) = 0.0$\n  $P_3 = 20/40 = 0.50$\n  $y_3 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.50) = 0.0$\n- For $N_4=2.00$, $n_4=40$, $k_4=34$:\n  $x_4 = \\log_{10}(2.00) \\approx 0.30103$\n  $P_4 = 34/40 = 0.85$\n  $y_4 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.85) \\approx 1.03643$\n- For $N_5=4.00$, $n_5=40$, $k_5=39$:\n  $x_5 = \\log_{10}(4.00) \\approx 0.60206$\n  $P_5 = 39/40 = 0.975$\n  $y_5 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.975) \\approx 1.95996$\n\nWe perform a simple linear regression for $y=a+bx$. The number of data points is $m=5$. The means are $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i = 0$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i = 0$.\nThe intercept is $a = \\bar{y} - b\\bar{x} = 0$.\nThe slope $b$ is given by:\n$$ b = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i}{\\sum x_i^2} $$\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i^2 \\approx (-0.60206)^2 + (-0.30103)^2 + 0^2 + (0.30103)^2 + (0.60206)^2 \\approx 0.90619 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i y_i \\approx (-0.60206)(-1.95996) + (-0.30103)(-1.03643) + (0)(0) + (0.30103)(1.03643) + (0.60206)(1.95996) \\approx 2.98402 $$\nThe slope is:\n$$ b \\approx \\frac{2.98402}{0.90619} \\approx 3.2928 $$\nThe resulting probit regression model is $\\Phi^{-1}(P) = 3.2928 \\log_{10}(N)$.\n\nThe LOD is defined as the concentration $N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$ at which the detection probability $P$ is $0.95$. We find the corresponding probit value:\n$$ y_{\\mathrm{LOD}} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.95) \\approx 1.64485 $$\nUsing the regression model, we solve for $\\log_{10}(N_{\\mathrm{LOD}})$:\n$$ 1.64485 = 3.2928 \\log_{10}(N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}) = \\frac{1.64485}{3.2928} \\approx 0.49953 $$\nThus, the LOD is:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{LOD}} = 10^{0.49953} \\approx 3.1588 \\text{ copies/reaction} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Limit of Quantification ($N_{\\mathrm{LOQ}}$)**\n\nThe LOQ is defined as the smallest concentration $N$ for which the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated copy number, $\\hat{N}$, is less than or equal to $0.25$.\nThe relationship between the measured cycle threshold $C_q$ and copy number $N$ is given by the standard curve:\n$$ C_q = \\alpha - \\beta \\log_{10}(N) $$\nThe estimator for $\\log_{10}(N)$ is $\\log_{10}(\\hat{N}) = \\frac{\\alpha - C_q}{\\beta}$.\nLet $Y = \\log_{10}(\\hat{N})$. The uncertainty in $C_q$, denoted $\\sigma_{C_q}$, propagates to an uncertainty in $Y$, denoted $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$ \\sigma_Y = \\frac{\\sigma_{C_q}}{\\beta} $$\nThe problem states that $\\hat{N}$ is approximately lognormal, and the variance of its natural logarithm is $\\sigma_{\\ln(\\hat{N})}^2 = (\\ln 10)^2 \\sigma_Y^2$. The CV of a lognormal variable with $\\ln$-variance $\\sigma^2$ is $\\sqrt{\\exp(\\sigma^2)-1}$. Therefore, the CV of $\\hat{N}$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{\\hat{N}} = \\sqrt{\\exp\\left(\\sigma_{\\ln(\\hat{N})}^2\\right)-1} = \\sqrt{\\exp\\left((\\ln 10)^2 \\sigma_Y^2\\right)-1} = \\sqrt{\\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_q}^2\\right)-1} $$\nThe LOQ condition is $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\hat{N}} \\leq 0.25$. We can solve for the corresponding maximum allowable $\\sigma_{C_q}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_q}^2\\right)-1} \\leq 0.25 $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_q}^2\\right)-1 \\leq 0.25^2 = 0.0625 $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_q}^2\\right) \\leq 1.0625 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_q}^2 \\leq \\ln(1.0625) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{C_q} \\leq \\frac{\\beta}{\\ln 10} \\sqrt{\\ln(1.0625)} $$\nUsing the given value $\\beta = 3.32$ and $\\ln 10 \\approx 2.30259$:\n$$ \\sigma_{C_q} \\leq \\frac{3.32}{2.30259} \\sqrt{\\ln(1.0625)} \\approx 1.44186 \\sqrt{0.060624} \\approx 1.44186 \\times 0.24622 \\approx 0.35501 $$\nWe now check the provided data for the smallest $N$ where $\\sigma_{C_q} \\leq 0.35501$:\n- $N=0.50$: $\\sigma_{C_{q}}=0.90$ ($> 0.35501$, does not meet criteria)\n- $N=1.00$: $\\sigma_{C_{q}}=0.70$ ($> 0.35501$, does not meet criteria)\n- $N=2.00$: $\\sigma_{C_{q}}=0.45$ ($> 0.35501$, does not meet criteria)\n- $N=3.162$: $\\sigma_{C_{q}}=0.35$ ($\\leq 0.35501$, meets criteria)\n- $N=4.00$: $\\sigma_{C_{q}}=0.32$ ($\\leq 0.35501$, meets criteria)\n\nThe smallest value of $N$ from the provided list that satisfies the condition is $N=3.162$. Therefore, the LOQ is:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{LOQ}} = 3.162 \\text{ copies/reaction} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{LOQ}}}{N_{\\mathrm{LOD}}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{3.162}{3.1588} \\approx 1.00101 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ R \\approx 1.001 $$",
