This exercise demonstrates the fundamental calculation used to determine an allele's integer repeat count from its amplicon length, a critical first step in generating an STR profile . Understanding this relationship is essential, as the entire system of nomenclature and subsequent statistical analysis is built upon these designated allele numbers.",

            "problem": "A Short Tandem Repeat (STR) locus is genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis, yielding two observed amplicon lengths of $254$ base pairs (bp) and $262$ base pairs (bp). The repeat motif at this locus is $4$ base pairs (bp) long and the nonrepetitive flanking sequence collectively contributes a constant $150$ base pairs (bp) to all alleles at this locus. Using only fundamental definitions of STR structure in which the amplicon length equals the constant flanking sequence length plus an integer number of tandem repeats each equal to the motif length, determine the integer repeat counts for the two alleles and explain, based on standard repeat-count nomenclature, how these alleles would be named and how non-integer microvariants would be denoted in general. As your final reported result, compute the sum $S$ of the two integer repeat counts. State $S$ as an integer with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, specifically Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, formalizable definition to arrive at a unique solution. The data provided are consistent and realistic.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the length of a PCR amplicon for an STR locus is given as:\n$$L = L_f + n \\cdot L_m$$\nwhere $L$ is the total length of the amplicon in base pairs (bp), $L_f$ is the constant length of the non-repetitive flanking sequences, $n$ is the integer number of tandem repeats, and $L_m$ is the length of the repeat motif.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe lengths of the two observed amplicons are $L_1 = 254$ bp and $L_2 = 262$ bp.\nThe length of the repeat motif is $L_m = 4$ bp.\nThe length of the constant flanking sequence is $L_f = 150$ bp.\n\nOur objective is to determine the integer repeat counts, $n_1$ and $n_2$, for the two respective alleles. We can rearrange the fundamental equation to solve for $n$:\n$$n \\cdot L_m = L - L_f$$\n$$n = \\frac{L - L_f}{L_m}$$\n\nFor the first allele with amplicon length $L_1 = 254$ bp, the number of repeats, $n_1$, is:\n$$n_1 = \\frac{L_1 - L_f}{L_m} = \\frac{254 - 150}{4}$$\n$$n_1 = \\frac{104}{4} = 26$$\nSince $n_1=26$ is an integer, this is a valid repeat count.\n\nFor the second allele with amplicon length $L_2 = 262$ bp, the number of repeats, $n_2$, is:\n$$n_2 = \\frac{L_2 - L_f}{L_m} = \\frac{262 - 150}{4}$$\n$$n_2 = \\frac{112}{4} = 28$$\nSince $n_2=28$ is an integer, this is also a valid repeat count.\n\nThe integer repeat counts for the two alleles are $26$ and $28$.\n\nAccording to standard STR nomenclature, alleles are named by their integer number of repeat units. Therefore, the allele with $26$ repeats is designated as allele \"$26$\", and the allele with $28$ repeats is designated as allele \"$28$\". A heterozygous individual with these two alleles would have the genotype $(26, 28)$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an explanation of how non-integer microvariants are denoted. Microvariants are alleles that contain incomplete repeat units. Their nomenclature uses a decimal point. The integer part of the designation represents the number of full repeats, and the number after the decimal point indicates the number of base pairs in the partial repeat. For example, if an allele at this locus (with a $4$-bp motif) consisted of $25$ full repeats and an additional partial repeat of $2$ bp, its total length would be $L_f + 25 \\cdot L_m + 2 = 150 + 25 \\cdot 4 + 2 = 150 + 100 + 2 = 252$ bp. This allele would be designated as allele \"$25.2$\". The number \"$2$\" after the decimal signifies the $2$ bp of the incomplete repeat, not a fractional part of the repeat unit itself (e.g., not $0.2 \\cdot 4$).\n\nFinally, the problem requires the computation of the sum $S$ of the two integer repeat counts determined for the observed alleles.\n$$S = n_1 + n_2$$\n$$S = 26 + 28 = 54$$\nThe sum of the two integer repeat counts is $54$.",

The premises are scientifically sound, based on established principles of population genetics, Mendelian inheritance, and forensic statistics. The data provided (allele frequencies, observed genotypes) are consistent and sufficient to specify a unique, meaningful solution. The allele frequencies ($f_{10} = 0.10$, $f_{11} = 0.22$, $f_{12} = 0.31$, $f_{13} = 0.37$) correctly sum to $1$. The observed genotypes are consistent with the inheritance pattern being investigated.\n\nThe solution will be presented in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the conditional probability mass function (PMF) for the biological father's genotype, and second, the derivation and calculation of the Paternity Index (PI).\n\nThe foundational principles are:\n1.  **Mendelian Segregation**: For an autosomal locus, a parent transmits one of their two alleles to an offspring, with each allele having an equal probability of $1/2$ of being transmitted.\n2.  **Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)**: In a large, randomly mating population free from other evolutionary influences, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remain constant from generation to generation. For an allele $i$ with frequency $f_i$, the frequency of genotype $(i,i)$ is $f_i^2$, and for a heterozygous genotype $(i,j)$, the frequency is $2f_if_j$.\n3.  **Paternity Index as a Likelihood Ratio**: The PI is a likelihood ratio that compares the probability of observing the genetic evidence ($E$) given two mutually exclusive hypotheses: $H_1$, that the alleged father is the true biological father, and $H_2$, that the alleged father is an unrelated random individual and the true father is a random man from the same population. $PI = \\frac{P(E|H_1)}{P(E|H_2)}$.\n\nLet the genotypes of the mother, child, and alleged father be denoted by $G_M$, $G_C$, and $G_A$, respectively. The observed genotypes are:\n- Mother: $G_M = (11, 12)$\n- Child: $G_C = (12, 13)$\n- Alleged Father: $G_A = (13, 13)$\n\nThe allele frequencies are $f_{10} = 0.10$, $f_{11} = 0.22$, $f_{12} = 0.31$, and $f_{13} = 0.37$.\n\n**Part 1: Conditional PMF of the Father's Genotype**\n\nThe first task is to determine the conditional probability mass function of the biological father's genotype, let's call it $G_F$, given the observed mother and child genotypes, under the hypothesis $H_1$ that the alleged father is the biological father (i.e., $G_A = G_F$).\n\nBased on Mendelian segregation, the child inherits one allele from the mother and one from the biological father. The mother's genotype is $G_M = (11, 12)$ and the child's is $G_C = (12, 13)$. Since the mother does not carry allele $13$, the child must have inherited allele $12$ from the mother. Consequently, the child must have inherited allele $13$ from the biological father. This allele that the biological father must have passed to the child is known as the **obligate paternal allele**. In this case, the obligate paternal allele is $13$.\n\nThis implies that the biological father must possess at least one copy of allele $13$. We wish to find the PMF, $P(G_F = g | G_M, G_C)$. The information from $G_M$ and $G_C$ is entirely captured by the deduction of the obligate paternal allele. Thus, we seek the probability distribution of genotypes for a man from the population, given that he has transmitted allele $13$ to his child.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability of the father having a specific genotype $g$ is:\n$$P(G_F = g | \\text{paternal allele} = 13) = \\frac{P(\\text{paternal allele} = 13 | G_F = g) P(G_F = g)}{P(\\text{paternal allele} = 13)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(\\text{paternal allele} = 13)$, is the probability that a randomly selected male gamete from the population carries allele $13$. Under HWE, this is equal to the allele's frequency, $f_{13}$.\n\nLet's calculate the conditional probability for each possible paternal genotype containing allele $13$.\n1.  For a heterozygous genotype $G_F = (i, 13)$ where $i \\neq 13$:\n    The population frequency is $P(G_F = (i, 13)) = 2f_i f_{13}$.\n    The probability of transmitting allele $13$ is $P(\\text{paternal allele} = 13 | G_F = (i, 13)) = 1/2$.\n    The conditional probability is:\n    $$P(G_F = (i, 13) | \\text{paternal allele} = 13) = \\frac{(1/2) \\times (2f_i f_{13})}{f_{13}} = f_i$$\n\n2.  For the homozygous genotype $G_F = (13, 13)$:\n    The population frequency is $P(G_F = (13, 13)) = f_{13}^2$.\n    The probability of transmitting allele $13$ is $P(\\text{paternal allele} = 13 | G_F = (13, 13)) = 1$.\n    The conditional probability is:\n    $$P(G_F = (13, 13) | \\text{paternal allele} = 13) = \\frac{1 \\times f_{13}^2}{f_{13}} = f_{13}$$\n\nApplying these results, the conditional PMF for the biological father's genotype $G_F$ is:\n- $P(G_F = (10, 13) | G_M, G_C) = f_{10} = 0.10$\n- $P(G_F = (11, 13) | G_M, G_C) = f_{11} = 0.22$\n- $P(G_F = (12, 13) | G_M, G_C) = f_{12} = 0.31$\n- $P(G_F = (13, 13) | G_M, G_C) = f_{13} = 0.37$\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $f_{10} + f_{11} + f_{12} + f_{13} = 0.10 + 0.22 + 0.31 + 0.37 = 1.00$, as expected for a valid PMF.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of the Paternity Index (PI)**\n\nThe PI is the likelihood ratio $LR = \\frac{P(E|H_1)}{P(E|H_2)}$, where the evidence $E$ is the full set of observed genotypes: $E = \\{G_M = (11,12), G_C = (12,13), G_A = (13,13)\\}$.\n\n**Numerator: $P(E|H_1)$**\nUnder hypothesis $H_1$, the alleged father is the biological father ($A=F$). The probability of observing the trio is the product of the parents' genotype probabilities (assuming they are random, unrelated individuals) and the conditional probability of the child's genotype given the parents' genotypes.\n$$P(E|H_1) = P(G_M, G_C, G_A | H_1) = P(G_M) P(G_A) P(G_C | G_M, G_A)$$\n- The probability of the mother's genotype is $P(G_M = (11,12)) = 2f_{11}f_{12}$.\n- The probability of the alleged father's genotype is $P(G_A = (13,13)) = f_{13}^2$.\n- The conditional probability of the child's genotype $G_C=(12,13)$ given the mother's $G_M=(11,12)$ and father's $G_A=(13,13)$ is determined by Mendelian segregation. The mother must pass allele $12$ (probability $1/2$) and the father must pass allele $13$ (probability $1$). Thus, $P(G_C | G_M, G_A) = 1/2$.\nCombining these terms:\n$$P(E|H_1) = (2f_{11}f_{12}) \\times (f_{13}^2) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = f_{11}f_{12}f_{13}^2$$\n\n**Denominator: $P(E|H_2)$**\nUnder hypothesis $H_2$, the alleged father is an unrelated random man, and the biological father is another, unspecified random man from the population. The genotypes of the mother and alleged father are independent events.\n$$P(E|H_2) = P(G_M, G_C, G_A | H_2) = P(G_M) P(G_A) P(G_C | G_M, H_2)$$\n- The probabilities $P(G_M)$ and $P(G_A)$ are the same as above.\n- The conditional probability $P(G_C | G_M, H_2)$ is the probability that a mother with genotype $G_M=(11,12)$ has a child with genotype $G_C=(12,13)$ with a random father. The mother must pass allele $12$ (probability $1/2$). The random father must pass allele $13$. The probability that a random paternal gamete carries allele $13$ is its frequency, $f_{13}$. Thus, $P(G_C | G_M, H_2) = (1/2) f_{13}$.\nCombining these terms:\n$$P(E|H_2) = (2f_{11}f_{12}) \\times (f_{13}^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}f_{13}\\right) = f_{11}f_{12}f_{13}^3$$\n\n**Paternity Index (PI)**\nThe PI is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$PI = \\frac{P(E|H_1)}{P(E|H_2)} = \\frac{f_{11}f_{12}f_{13}^2}{f_{11}f_{12}f_{13}^3} = \\frac{1}{f_{13}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that the PI for this specific configuration of genotypes (where the alleged father is homozygous for the obligate paternal allele) is the reciprocal of the obligate paternal allele's frequency.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $f_{13} = 0.37$.\n$$PI = \\frac{1}{0.37} \\approx 2.7027027...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the Paternity Index is $2.703$.",

In an ideal heterozygote at a locus, two alleles amplify with comparable efficiency, and their true template abundances are equal. However, at low template or under stochastic sampling, pre-PCR molecule counts for the two alleles fluctuate due to random partitioning, which can be modeled by Poisson sampling, and, conditional on the total sampled molecules, by a binomial allocation. Measured peak heights are approximately proportional to the number of successfully amplified molecules, modulated by amplification efficiency and within-run variation, and artifact peaks such as stutter are present at a typical fraction of the parent allele peak. To evaluate heterozygote balance and to distinguish genuine imbalance due to stochastic sampling from dropout or preferential amplification, a laboratory must define a heterozygote balance metric and criteria that account for analytical detection thresholds, baseline noise, and stutter artifact.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts and operating conditions:\n- Pre-PCR sampling of template molecules for each allele can be approximated by a Poisson process with mean $\\lambda$, and conditional on the total count $n$ sampled across both alleles, the allocation to alleles is binomial with parameter $p = 0.5$ in a true heterozygote.\n- Electropherogram peak heights $H_A$ and $H_B$ are approximately proportional to the effective amplified molecule counts of alleles $A$ and $B$ and are subject to log-normal amplification variability and baseline noise, but ratios are dominated by the binomial allocation when $n$ is small.\n- The laboratory’s analytical threshold is $T_a = 50$ RFU, the baseline noise standard deviation is $\\sigma_n = 5$ RFU, and the stutter proportion for this locus is $s = 0.10$, so a typical stutter peak height is approximately $s \\, H_{\\mathrm{parent}}$.\n- The laboratory uses a calibration that maps RFU to an estimated pre-PCR molecule count via $n \\approx \\alpha \\, (H_A + H_B)$, with $\\alpha = 0.05$ molecules per RFU, reflecting an empirically validated linear regime.\n\nWhich of the following sets of metric definitions and flagging criteria is most consistent with these principles and appropriately differentiates low-template stochastic imbalance from preferential amplification and potential dropout?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid description of a central challenge in forensic genetics: the interpretation of short tandem repeat (STR) profiles, especially from low-template DNA samples. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The process is STR profiling via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis, yielding peak heights ($H_A$, $H_B$) in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).\n- Pre-PCR allele sampling is modeled as a Poisson process for overall molecule capture and a binomial allocation for a true heterozygote (total count $n$, probability $p = 0.5$).\n- Stochastic effects (random partitioning) dominate peak height ratios when $n$ is small.\n- The laboratory's analytical threshold is $T_a = 50$ RFU.\n- The baseline noise standard deviation is $\\sigma_n = 5$ RFU.\n- The stutter proportion is $s = 0.10$, meaning a stutter artifact peak has a height of approximately $s \\, H_{\\mathrm{parent}}$.\n- An empirical calibration relates total peak height to pre-PCR molecule count: $n \\approx \\alpha \\, (H_A + H_B)$, with $\\alpha = 0.05$ molecules per RFU.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem statement is firmly based on established principles of molecular biology and statistics as applied to forensic genetics. The concepts of PCR, STRs, heterozygote balance, stochastic amplification (allelic drop-in/drop-out), stutter artifacts, and analytical thresholds are all standard in the field. The use of Poisson and binomial distributions to model low-copy-number effects is a well-accepted statistical approach.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for an evaluation of different interpretation strategies (the options) against a set of established scientific principles and parameters. A unique \"most consistent\" option can be determined by logical deduction.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is expressed in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. All parameters are defined, and the underlying physical and statistical models are specified.\n\n**Conclusion of Validation**: The problem statement is valid. It accurately frames a complex but realistic scenario in forensic diagnostics, providing sufficient and consistent information to evaluate the proposed solutions.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nA robust set of criteria for interpreting heterozygote balance must account for three key phenomena described in the problem:\n1.  **Stochastic Imbalance**: The inherent randomness of PCR amplification from a small number of template molecules ($n$) predicts greater peak height imbalance for low-signal profiles. Therefore, any threshold for imbalance should be dynamic, becoming more tolerant (e.g., allowing a lower Peak Height Ratio) as the total signal ($H_A + H_B$), and thus $n$, decreases.\n2.  **Stutter Artifacts**: A true minor allele peak must be reliably distinguished from the stutter artifact of the major allele. This requires that the minor allele's peak height ($H_{\\min}$) be significantly greater than the expected stutter peak height ($s \\, H_{\\max}$).\n3.  **Analytical Threshold**: Any reported peak must exceed the laboratory's analytical threshold ($T_a$), which is set to distinguish signal from background instrument noise. Allelic dropout is the failure of an allele to produce a peak that meets these criteria for detection.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n**Option A Analysis:** This option defines heterozygote balance as $HB = \\dfrac{H_A - H_B}{H_A + H_B}$ and uses a fixed threshold $\\lvert HB \\rvert \\leq 0.2$. A fixed threshold is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle that stochastic imbalance is dependent on the total number of template molecules ($n$). This rule would be overly stringent for low-template samples and potentially too lenient for high-template samples. Furthermore, it states to \"not incorporate stutter in the decision because baseline noise already covers artifacts.\" This is a critical scientific error. Baseline noise and stutter are distinct phenomena; noise is generally signal-independent, while stutter is signal-dependent. Ignoring stutter is a major flaw in STR profile interpretation. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the provided principles.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option B Analysis:** This option defines the Peak Height Ratio (PHR) as $\\mathrm{PHR} = \\dfrac{\\min(H_A, H_B)}{\\max(H_A, H_B)}$. It correctly proposes using a **dynamic imbalance threshold**, $r_{95}(n)$, which is derived from the binomial sampling model and is dependent on the estimated molecule count $n$. This directly and correctly addresses the issue of stochastic imbalance. It proposes to flag preferential amplification if the PHR falls below this dynamic threshold, but only if the minor peak is unambiguously a true allele. The criteria for an unambiguous minor allele are $H_{\\min} \\geq T_a$ (above analytical threshold) and $H_{\\min} \\geq s \\, H_{\\max} + 3 \\, \\sigma_n$. This second condition is a statistically robust method for ensuring the minor peak is not a stutter artifact, as it must exceed the expected stutter height by a margin of $3$ standard deviations of the noise. Finally, it flags potential dropout if the minor peak fails to meet a composite threshold, $H_{\\min} < \\max\\!\\big(T_a, s \\, H_{\\max}\\big) + 3 \\, \\sigma_n$, which correctly combines the requirements of clearing both the analytical threshold and the stutter-plus-noise threshold. This entire framework is internally consistent and correctly formalizes all the key principles laid out in the problem statement. The qualitative summary accurately reflects this sophisticated approach.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Option C Analysis:** This option uses the standard PHR metric but applies a **fixed cutoff** of $\\mathrm{PHR} \\geq 0.8$. Like option A, this fails to account for the signal-dependent nature of stochastic imbalance. It also contains internally inconsistent logic for flagging dropout: the rule applies only when $(H_A + H_B) > 500$ RFU, ignoring the low-signal regime where dropout is most probable. The claim that \"stutter need not be considered separately because the $2:1$ rule is conservative\" is false. For a major peak of $H_{\\max} = 1000$ RFU, the stutter would be around $100$ RFU. A minor allele at $H_{\\min} = 120$ RFU would be a real peak distinguishable from stutter, but the profile would be flagged as dropout under a simple $2:1$ rule ($\\mathrm{PHR} = 0.12 < 0.5$) when it is not. This option's rules are simplistic and scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D Analysis:** This option introduces a non-standard metric, $\\mathrm{SCB} = \\dfrac{H_{\\min} - s \\, H_{\\max}}{H_{\\max}}$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{PHR} - s$. It then requires $\\mathrm{SCB} \\geq 0.8$, which, with $s=0.10$, is equivalent to $\\mathrm{PHR} \\geq 0.9$. This is an extremely stringent, **fixed threshold** that is inappropriate for the reasons already discussed. While its rule for distinguishing an allele from stutter ($H_{\\min} < 2 \\, s \\, H_{\\max}$) is a plausible heuristic, the overall framework is built upon an flawed metric and a fixed balance criterion that ignores the fundamental role of stochastic variation at different template levels.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",
