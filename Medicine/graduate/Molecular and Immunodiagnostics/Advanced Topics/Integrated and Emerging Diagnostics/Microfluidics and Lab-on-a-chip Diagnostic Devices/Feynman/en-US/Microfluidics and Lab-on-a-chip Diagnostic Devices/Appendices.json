The appropriate fundamental description is the stationary Stokes limit of the Navier–Stokes equations. Let the axial direction be $z$, and transverse coordinates be $x \\in [0,w]$ and $y \\in [0,h]$. For fully developed flow, the axial velocity $u(x,y)$ depends only on $x$ and $y$, and the axial pressure gradient is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}, \\quad u = u(x,y), \\quad v = 0, \\quad w = 0.\n$$\nThe governing equation reduces to\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial y^{2}}\\right) = 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{L}.\n$$\nWith the no-slip boundary conditions $u(0,y)=u(w,y)=u(x,0)=u(x,h)=0$, the solution can be obtained by separation of variables in a Fourier sine series.

            "problem": "A Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) immunodiagnostic device distributes a Newtonian assay buffer through two parallel rectangular microchannels that lead from a common inlet manifold to a common outlet. The fluid is incompressible, the flow is steady, and the Reynolds number is sufficiently small that inertial effects are negligible. Assume no-slip at all channel walls, fully developed flow, and negligible entrance, exit, and manifold losses relative to the losses within the microchannels. Each channel has identical height $h$ and length $L$, but different widths $w_1$ and $w_2$.

The physical parameters and assumptions (creeping flow, channel geometry) are consistent and realistic for a microfluidic device. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total volumetric flow rate that passes through the narrower of two parallel rectangular microchannels. The two channels are subject to the same pressure drop, $\\Delta P$. This configuration is analogous to a parallel electrical circuit where the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is analogous to voltage, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is analogous to current, and the hydraulic resistance $R_H$ is analogous to electrical resistance.\n\nThe definition of hydraulic resistance is given as $R_H = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$. For two channels in parallel, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across each is identical. Let the flow rates in the two channels be $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and their hydraulic resistances be $R_{H,1}$ and $R_{H,2}$.\n$$ Q_1 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{H,1}}, \\quad Q_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{H,2}} $$\nThe total flow rate is the sum of the individual flow rates:\n$$ Q_{tot} = Q_1 + Q_2 = \\Delta P \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{H,1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{H,2}}\\right) $$\nThe problem identifies the channels by their widths $w_1$ and $w_2$.

For steady, fully developed, incompressible, pressure-driven flow in a long rectangular duct (creeping flow), the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is given by the exact solution to the Stokes equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P w h^3}{12 \\mu L} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{192 h}{\\pi^5 w} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^5} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi w}{2h}\\right) \\right] $$\nwhere $h$ is the channel height, $w$ is the width, $L$ is the length, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and we assume $h \\le w$.

Note that the height $h$, length $L$, and viscosity $\\mu$ are the same for both channels.\nSubstituting these into the expression for the flow fraction $f_1$:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{\\frac{12 \\mu L}{w_2 h^3 F(\\alpha_2)}}{\\frac{12 \\mu L}{w_1 h^3 F(\\alpha_1)} + \\frac{12 \\mu L}{w_2 h^3 F(\\alpha_2)}} $$\nThe common factor $\\frac{12 \\mu L}{h^3}$ cancels out:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{w_2 F(\\alpha_2)}}{\\frac{1}{w_1 F(\\alpha_1)} + \\frac{1}{w_2 F(\\alpha_2)}} $$\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by $w_1 F(\\alpha_1) w_2 F(\\alpha_2)$ yields the analytical expression for the flow fraction:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{w_1 F(\\alpha_1)}{w_1 F(\\alpha_1) + w_2 F(\\alpha_2)} $$\nThis expression shows that the flow fraction depends only on the channel geometries, not on the fluid viscosity, channel length, or the applied pressure drop.\n\nNow, we evaluate this fraction using the given parameters:\n$h = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $w_1 = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $w_2 = 240\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nFirst, calculate the aspect ratios:\n$$ \\alpha_1 = \\frac{h}{w_1} = \\frac{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.25 $$\n$$ \\alpha_2 = \\frac{h}{w_2} = \\frac{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{240\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.125 $$\nNext, we calculate the correction factors $F(\\alpha_1)$ and $F(\\alpha_2)$.\nFor $\\alpha_1 = 0.25$, the argument of the hyperbolic tangent function is $\\frac{n\\pi}{2\\alpha_1} = \\frac{n\\pi}{2(0.25)} = 2n\\pi$.\nFor $\\alpha_2 = 0.125$, the argument is $\\frac{n\\pi}{2\\alpha_2} = \\frac{n\\pi}{2(0.125)} = 4n\\pi$.\nFor any integer $n \\geq 1$, the values $2n\\pi$ and $4n\\pi$ are large enough that $\\tanh(2n\\pi) \\approx 1$ and $\\tanh(4n\\pi) \\approx 1$.

Solving for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{obs}} + C \\exp(-k_{obs}t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} + C \\exp(-(k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}})t) $$\nWe apply the initial condition $\\theta(0)=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = -\\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} - \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} \\exp(-(k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}})t) $$\nFactoring out the common term gives the final analytical solution for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}})t)\\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $k_{\\text{on}} = 10^6\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{\\text{off}} = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $c = 100\\,\\text{pM}$\n-   $t = 300\\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units. The concentration $c$ must be converted from picomolar ($\\text{pM}$) to molar ($\\text{M}$):\n$$ c = 100\\,\\text{pM} = 100 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{M} = 1 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{M} $$\nNext, we calculate the terms in the solution for $\\theta(t)$.\nThe association term $k_{\\text{on}} c$:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} c = (10^6\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-10}\\,\\text{M}) = 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe observed rate constant $k_{obs} = k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$ k_{obs} = 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} + 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the solution for $\\theta(t)$ at $t=300\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$ \\theta(300) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c}{k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\text{on}} c + k_{\\text{off}}) \\times 300)\\right) $$\n$$ \\theta(300) = \\frac{10^{-4}}{1.1 \\times 10^{-3}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-(1.1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 300)\\right) $$\nLet's evaluate the components separately.\nThe equilibrium fraction $\\theta_{eq}$:\n$$ \\theta_{eq} = \\frac{10^{-4}}{1.1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\nThe exponential argument:\n$$ -(1.1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 300 = -0.33 $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta(300)$:\n$$ \\theta(300) = \\frac{1}{11} (1 - \\exp(-0.33)) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-0.33) \\approx 0.7189151 $$\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-0.33) \\approx 1 - 0.7189151 = 0.2810849 $$\n$$ \\theta(300) \\approx \\frac{0.2810849}{11} \\approx 0.02555317 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\theta(300) \\approx 0.02555 $$\nThe expected fraction of occupied sites after $300$ seconds is $0.02555$.",
