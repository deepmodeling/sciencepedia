It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Model**\nLet $N(t)$ be the number of amplicon copies at time $t$. The problem states that the rate of formation of new amplicons, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is proportional to the current number of amplicons, $N(t)$. This is expressed as the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k N(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the proportionality constant representing the growth rate of the amplification process. This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = k dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial condition $(t=0, N=N_0)$ to a later time $(t, N(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_0^t k dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(N')]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = [kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = kt\n$$\nSolving for $N(t)$ by exponentiating both sides gives the expression for the time-dependent amplicon copy number:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the threshold time, $T$. This is the time at which the amplicon copy number reaches a fixed threshold value, $N_T$. By definition, at $t=T$, $N(T) = N_T$. Substituting this into the growth equation:\n$$\nN_T = N_0 \\exp(kT)\n$$\nTo solve for $T$, we first divide by $N_0$ and then take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_T}{N_0}\\right) = kT\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the threshold time:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_T}{N_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_0))\n$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\n**Calculation of the Unknown Copy Number**\nThe problem states that all runs are performed under identical conditions, which implies that the growth parameter $k$ and the threshold copy number $N_T$ are constants. We can write the threshold time equation for the two calibrators, A and B:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{1}{k} (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,A})) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nT_B = \\frac{1}{k} (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,B})) \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo find the value of $k$, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n$$\nT_A - T_B = \\frac{1}{k} [(\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,A})) - (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,B}))]\n$$\n$$\nT_A - T_B = \\frac{1}{k} [\\ln(N_{0,B}) - \\ln(N_{0,A})] = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{0,B}}{N_{0,A}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(N_{0,B}/N_{0,A})}{T_A - T_B}\n$$\nNow, we write the equation for the blinded sample, S:\n$$\nT_S = \\frac{1}{k} (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,S})) \\quad (3)\n$$\nTo find $N_{0,S}$, we can relate it to a known calibrator, for example, calibrator A. By subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):\n$$\nT_A - T_S = \\frac{1}{k} [(\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,A})) - (\\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_{0,S}))]\n$$\n$$\nT_A - T_S = \\frac{1}{k} [\\ln(N_{0,S}) - \\ln(N_{0,A})]\n$$\nSolving for $\\ln(N_{0,S})$:\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln(N_{0,A}) + k(T_A - T_S)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $k$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln(N_{0,A}) + \\left(\\frac{\\ln(N_{0,B}/N_{0,A})}{T_A - T_B}\\right) (T_A - T_S)\n$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values: $N_{0,A} = 200$, $N_{0,B} = 2000$, $T_A = 9.50$, $T_B = 7.30$, and $T_S = 8.10$.\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln(200) + \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2000/200)}{9.50 - 7.30}\\right) (9.50 - 8.10)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln(200) + \\left(\\frac{\\ln(10)}{2.20}\\right) (1.40)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$:\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln(200) + \\ln\\left(10^{\\frac{1.40}{2.20}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$:\n$$\n\\ln(N_{0,S}) = \\ln\\left(200 \\times 10^{\\frac{1.40}{2.20}}\\right)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields $N_{0,S}$:\n$$\nN_{0,S} = 200 \\times 10^{\\frac{1.4}{2.2}} = 200 \\times 10^{7/11}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nN_{0,S} \\approx 200 \\times 10^{0.636363...} \\approx 200 \\times 4.32876... \\approx 865.752...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $866$.",

Express the final free magnesium concentration in millimolar and round your answer to $3$ significant figures. Do not include any units in your final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The premises are consistent with the principles of chemical equilibrium and their application in molecular biology assays like Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). The provided concentrations and assumptions are physically and biochemically realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the principle of mass conservation to the chemical species involved in the reaction mixture. We are given the total concentrations of magnesium, $C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}}$, and the chelating agent EDTA, $C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$.\n\nLet us define the concentrations of the relevant species at equilibrium:\n- $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$: The concentration of free, uncomplexed magnesium ions. This is the quantity we aim to find.\n- $[\\mathrm{E}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$: The concentration of free, uncomplexed EDTA. Note that EDTA can exist in several protonation states, but for the purpose of chelation, we consider 'E' to represent the form(s) available to bind $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.\n- $[\\mathrm{MgE}]$: The concentration of the magnesium-EDTA complex.\n\nBased on the law of conservation of mass, the total concentration of magnesium is the sum of its free and complexed forms.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}} = [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + [\\mathrm{MgE}] \\quad (1)$$\n\nSimilarly, the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of its free and complexed forms.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}} = [\\mathrm{E}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + [\\mathrm{MgE}] \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe problem provides a crucial simplifying assumption: \"the conditional formation constant is sufficiently large at the working pH that EDTA is effectively fully complexed until magnesium is in excess\". This is a statement that the chelation reaction,\n$$\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} + \\mathrm{E} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{MgE}$$\nproceeds essentially to completion, limited only by the reactant present in the lower amount (the limiting reagent).\n\nWe are given the initial total concentrations:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\n\nSince $C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}} > C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$, magnesium is in stoichiometric excess relative to EDTA. According to the assumption, the limiting reagent, EDTA, will be almost completely consumed to form the complex $\\mathrm{MgE}$. This implies that the concentration of free EDTA, $[\\mathrm{E}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, will be negligible.\n$$[\\mathrm{E}]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx 0$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the mass balance equation for EDTA (Equation 2), we find:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}} \\approx 0 + [\\mathrm{MgE}]$$\n$$[\\mathrm{MgE}] \\approx C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$$\n\nThis result states that the concentration of the magnesium-EDTA complex is effectively equal to the total initial concentration of EDTA. This is a direct consequence of EDTA being the limiting reagent in a reaction that goes to completion.\n\nNow, we derive the general expression for the free magnesium concentration. We substitute the expression $[\\mathrm{MgE}] = C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$ into the mass balance equation for magnesium (Equation 1):\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}} = [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$$\n\nSolving for $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = C_{\\mathrm{Mg,tot}} - C_{\\mathrm{E,tot}}$$\n\nThis equation quantitatively shows that the role of a strong, stoichiometric chelator like EDTA (when it is the limiting reagent) is to sequester an amount of metal ion equal to its own total concentration, thereby reducing the free metal ion concentration from the total.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value using the given concentrations:\n$$[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mM} - 2\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 12\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in millimolar and rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $12\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. To express this with $3$ significant figures, we write it as $12.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nFinally, we address the mechanistic implications for polymerase performance in RPA. The free magnesium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, not the total magnesium concentration, is the biologically active quantity. The strand-displacing DNA polymerase used in RPA, like most DNA polymerases, requires $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ as an essential cofactor. These ions are critical for multiple functions:\n1.  They coordinate with the triphosphate moiety of incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), orienting them correctly in the enzyme's active site.\n2.  They participate directly in the catalytic mechanism of phosphodiester bond formation, typically involving two metal ions in the active site that activate the attacking $3'$-hydroxyl group and stabilize the leaving pyrophosphate group.\n3.  They help to stabilize the enzyme's structure.\n\nThe activity, processivity, and fidelity of the polymerase are highly sensitive to $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$. If the concentration is too low, the enzyme's catalytic rate drops precipitously, stalling amplification. If it is too high, it can decrease polymerase fidelity (increase misincorporation rate) and promote non-specific primer binding, leading to spurious amplification products. Therefore, establishing an optimal $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is paramount for a successful RPA reaction. By including a specific amount of EDTA, researchers can precisely titrate the free magnesium to a target concentration (here, $12.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) that is known to be optimal for the specific polymerase and other reaction components, making the assay more robust and reproducible.",

Let $K(t)$ be the number of initiation events that have occurred by time $t$.\n\n1.  **Single Template, No Inhibitor**: For a single template, the initiation events occur with rate $\\lambda$. The number of events in an interval of length $T$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda T$. The probability of zero initiations on this single template is $P(\\text{0 events}) = e^{-\\lambda T}$.\n\n2.  **N Templates, No Inhibitor**: We have $N$ independent templates. A false-negative result is defined as zero initiations on *any* of the $N$ templates. This means there must be zero initiations on template 1, AND zero on template 2, ..., AND zero on template $N$. Due to independence, the probability is the product of individual probabilities:\n    $P_{\\mathrm{FN}} = (e^{-\\lambda T}) \\times (e^{-\\lambda T}) \\times \\dots \\times (e^{-\\lambda T}) = (e^{-\\lambda T})^{N} = e^{-N\\lambda T}$.\n    Alternatively, the total rate of initiation events across all $N$ templates is the sum of the individual rates, $\\Lambda_{\\text{total}} = N\\lambda$. The number of total events in time $T$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $N\\lambda T$. The probability of zero total events is $P(k=0) = \\frac{e^{-N\\lambda T}(N\\lambda T)^0}{0!} = e^{-N\\lambda T}$.\n\n3.  **N Templates, With Inhibitor**: In the presence of an inhibitor, the rate per template is reduced to $\\eta\\lambda$. Following the same logic as above, the total rate is $\\eta N\\lambda$, and the false-negative probability in the presence of inhibitor, $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$, is:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{FN}}' = e^{-\\eta N \\lambda T}$$\n\n4.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    Using the given values: $N=4$, $\\lambda=0.02$ min$^{-1}$, $T=20$ min, $\\eta=0.5$.\n    -   **Baseline (no inhibitor, $\\eta=1$)**:\n        The exponent is $-N\\lambda T = -4 \\times 0.02 \\times 20 = -1.6$.\n        $P_{\\mathrm{FN}} = e^{-1.6} \\approx 0.2018965... \\approx 0.202$.\n    -   **Inhibited case**:\n        The exponent is $-\\eta N\\lambda T = -0.5 \\times 4 \\times 0.02 \\times 20 = -0.8$.\n        $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}' = e^{-0.8} \\approx 0.4493289... \\approx 0.449$.\n\n**Part (ii): IAC Strategy and Quantification of $\\eta$**\n\n1.  **IAC Model**: The IAC consists of $M$ templates, each subject to initiation with an inhibited rate of $\\eta\\lambda$. The waiting time for an initiation on a single IAC template, $W_i$, follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\eta\\lambda$; $W_i \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\eta\\lambda)$.\n\n2.  **Waiting Time to First Initiation**: The time to the *first* initiation among all $M$ IAC templates is the minimum of the individual waiting times: $W_{\\text{first}} = \\min(W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_M)$. A fundamental property of exponential distributions is that the minimum of $M$ independent and identically distributed random variables with rate $\\eta\\lambda$ is itself an exponential random variable with a rate equal to the sum of the individual rates, which is $M\\eta\\lambda$.\n    Thus, $W_{\\text{first}} \\sim \\text{Exp}(M\\eta\\lambda)$.\n\n3.  **Expected Waiting Time**: The expected value (mean) of this waiting time is the reciprocal of the rate:\n    $$E[W_{\\text{first}}] = \\frac{1}{M\\eta\\lambda}$$\n\n4.  **Estimation of $\\eta$**: The problem states that the measured time to threshold, $t_{\\mathrm{IAC}}$, is the sum of this waiting time and a constant amplification time $\\tau$:\n    $t_{\\mathrm{IAC}} = W_{\\text{first}} + \\tau$.\n    To estimate the parameters from a single measurement, we can equate the observed waiting time ($t_{\\mathrm{IAC}} - \\tau$) with its expected value:\n    $t_{\\mathrm{IAC}} - \\tau \\approx E[W_{\\text{first}}] = \\frac{1}{M\\eta\\lambda}$.\n    Solving for the inhibition factor $\\eta$:\n    $$\\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{M\\lambda(t_{\\mathrm{IAC}} - \\tau)}$$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    Using the given values: $M=50$, $\\lambda=0.02$ min$^{-1}$, $t_{\\mathrm{IAC}}=6$ min, $\\tau=3$ min.\n    $$\\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{50 \\times 0.02 \\times (6 - 3)} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n    $\\eta \\approx 0.333...$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}$ in the presence of inhibition is $e^{-\\eta \\lambda T N}$, yielding baseline $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}=e^{-\\lambda T N}=e^{-1.6}\\approx 0.202$ and inhibited $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'=e^{-0.8}\\approx 0.449$. The IAC uses a noncompetitive, matched-kinetics primer–probe set in a distinct fluorescence channel at $M=50$ copies; since the waiting time to the first initiation among $M$ independent templates is exponential with rate $M \\eta \\lambda$, estimate $\\eta$ by $\\eta \\approx \\dfrac{1}{M \\lambda \\left(t_{\\mathrm{IAC}}-\\tau\\right)}=\\dfrac{1}{50\\cdot 0.02\\cdot (6-3)}=\\dfrac{1}{3}\\approx 0.333$.**\n- The formula for the false-negative probability, $e^{-\\eta N \\lambda T}$, is correct as derived from first principles.\n- The numerical evaluations for both baseline ($e^{-1.6} \\approx 0.202$) and inhibited ($e^{-0.8} \\approx 0.449$) cases are correct.\n- The description of the IAC is scientifically sound for the purpose of quantifying inhibition (noncompetitive, matched kinetics, distinct channel).\n- The derivation of the waiting time for the first initiation being exponential with rate $M\\eta\\lambda$ is correct.\n- The formula for estimating $\\eta$, $\\eta \\approx \\dfrac{1}{M \\lambda(t_{\\mathrm{IAC}}-\\tau)}$, is correctly derived from the expected waiting time.\n- The numerical calculation for $\\eta$, $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$, is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$ is $(1-\\eta \\lambda T)^{N}$, giving baseline $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}=(1-\\lambda T)^{N}=(1-0.4)^{4}=0.1296$ and inhibited $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'=(1-0.2)^{4}=0.4096$. The IAC shares the same primers as the target and is added at $M=10^{6}$ copies to maximize signal; inhibition is quantified from endpoint fluorescence intensity ratios between channels.**\n- The formula for $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$, $(1-\\eta \\lambda T)^{N}$, is incorrect. It corresponds to a discrete-time Bernoulli trial model, which contradicts the problem's premise of a continuous-time Poisson process.\n- The IAC design is flawed. Using shared primers introduces competition, which violates the principle of an independent control. A very high IAC copy number ($M=10^6$) would drastically inhibit the low-copy target amplification.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$ is $1-e^{-\\eta \\lambda T N}$, giving baseline $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}=1-e^{-1.6}\\approx 0.799$ and inhibited $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'=1-e^{-0.8}\\approx 0.551$. The IAC is an extraction control added prior to nucleic acid purification and quantified via endpoint fluorescence; $\\eta$ is inferred from the ratio of endpoint signals.**\n- The formula $1 - e^{-\\eta \\lambda T N}$ represents the probability of at least one initiation event, which is the probability of a true-positive result, not a false-negative. This is fundamentally incorrect.\n- The IAC is described as an extraction control. This type of control monitors a different process (sample preparation efficiency) and is not designed to quantify a kinetic parameter like $\\eta$ for the amplification step itself.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$ is $e^{-(\\eta \\lambda T)/N}$, giving baseline $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}=e^{-(\\lambda T)/N}=e^{-0.1}\\approx 0.905$ and inhibited $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'=e^{-0.05}\\approx 0.951$. The IAC is implemented by multiplexing the target and IAC in a single fluorescence channel and estimating $\\eta$ from the ratio of their endpoint amplicon concentrations.**\n- The formula for $P_{\\mathrm{FN}}'$, $e^{-(\\eta \\lambda T)/N}$, is incorrect. The total rate is proportional to $N$, not inversely proportional. This formula incorrectly implies that the false-negative probability increases as the number of target copies $N$ increases, which is nonsensical.\n- Multiplexing in a single channel without a way to distinguish signals (like FRET probes or melt analysis, which are not mentioned) makes it impossible to determine the individual time-to-threshold for the IAC. Using endpoint ratios is a less accurate way to determine kinetic parameters.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
