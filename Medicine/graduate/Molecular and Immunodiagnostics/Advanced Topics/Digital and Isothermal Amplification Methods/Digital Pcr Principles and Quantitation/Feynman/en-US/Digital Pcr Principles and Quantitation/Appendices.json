This is the foundational principle of digital PCR (dPCR) quantitation. The assumptions are standard for an idealized model of dPCR.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data ($N$ and $k$) to determine the unknown quantity (total copies per reaction).

It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Estimator and Absolute Copy Number**\n\nThe foundational model for digital PCR assumes that target molecules are distributed randomly and independently among the $N$ partitions. When the total number of molecules is large and the number of partitions is also large, the number of molecules, $X$, in any given droplet follows a Poisson distribution. Let $\\lambda$ be the average number of molecules per droplet (the mean occupancy). The probability of a droplet containing exactly $j$ molecules is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(X=j) = \\frac{\\lambda^j \\exp(-\\lambda)}{j!}$$\nwhere $j$ is a non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a droplet is classified as \"negative\" if and only if it contains zero molecules. The probability of a randomly selected droplet being negative corresponds to the case where $j=0$:\n$$P(\\text{negative}) = P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nConversely, a droplet is \"positive\" if it contains one or more molecules ($j \\ge 1$). The probability of a droplet being positive is:\n$$P(\\text{positive}) = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nFrom the experimental data, we have a total of $N$ droplets, of which $k$ are observed to be positive. The number of negative droplets is therefore $N-k$. The observed fraction of negative droplets, $f_{neg}$, serves as the empirical estimate for the theoretical probability $P(\\text{negative})$:\n$$f_{neg} = \\frac{\\text{Number of negative droplets}}{\\text{Total number of droplets}} = \\frac{N-k}{N}$$\nBy equating the theoretical probability to this empirical fraction, we can establish an equation to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{N-k}{N}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$-\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N-k}{N}\\right)$$\nThis equation can be solved for $\\lambda$, which is the estimator for the mean occupancy per droplet:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{N-k}{N}\\right)$$\nThis can also be expressed as:\n$$\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{N-k}{N}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{N-k}\\right)$$\nThis formula provides the mean number of target molecules per droplet, derived entirely from the total number of droplets and the number of observed negative droplets.\n\nThe absolute number of target copies per reaction, which we denote as $M$, is the total number of molecules that were originally present in the sample volume before partitioning. Since $\\lambda$ is the *average* number of molecules per droplet, the total number of molecules is simply this average multiplied by the total number of droplets, $N$:\n$$M = \\lambda \\times N$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$M = N \\left[-\\ln\\left(\\frac{N-k}{N}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n-   $N = 20{,}000$\n-   $k = 5{,}400$\n\nFirst, calculate the number of negative droplets:\n$$N-k = 20{,}000 - 5{,}400 = 14{,}600$$\nNext, calculate the fraction of negative droplets:\n$$\\frac{N-k}{N} = \\frac{14{,}600}{20{,}000} = 0.73$$\nNow, compute $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(0.73)$$\nFinally, compute the total number of copies, $M$:\n$$M = 20{,}000 \\times [-\\ln(0.73)]$$\nUsing the value for the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln(0.73) \\approx -0.314710757$$\nTherefore:\n$$M \\approx 20{,}000 \\times [-(-0.314710757)] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.314710757 \\approx 6294.21514$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$M \\approx 6294$$\n\n**Explanation of Absolute Quantitation**\nThe quantitation provided by dPCR is considered \"absolute\" because it relies on a physical count of partitions and a fundamental statistical principle, rather than on an indirect, analog signal that must be calibrated. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Digital Signal**: PCR is used not to measure the rate of amplification, but simply to generate a binary, yes/no signal. Each droplet is classified as either positive (amplification occurred) or negative (no amplification occurred). This endpoint detection only requires that the reaction chemistry is sufficient to amplify a single molecule to a detectable level, distinguishing it from an empty droplet.\n\n2.  **No Dependence on Reaction Efficiency**: Unlike quantitative PCR (qPCR), where the quantitation is inferred from the amplification rate (e.g., the cycle threshold, $C_t$), dPCR is insensitive to variations in PCR efficiency from droplet to droplet, as long as the efficiency is above the threshold for detection. The final fluorescence intensity of positive droplets is not used in the calculation, removing a major source of variability and the need for calibration.\n\n3.  **First-Principles Calculation**: The calculation for $\\lambda$ and subsequently $M$ depends only on the ratio of negative to total partitions. This is a counting exercise. The formula $\\lambda = -\\ln(f_{neg})$ is derived directly from the Poisson model of random distribution. It does not contain any parameters related to the kinetics or thermodynamics of PCR, nor any instrument-specific fluorescence parameters.\n\n4.  **No External Calibrators**: Because the measurement is based on counting and a statistical model, dPCR does not require a standard curve generated from samples of known concentration to interpret the result for the target of interest. This makes the measurement \"absolute\" in the sense that it is not relative to a separately prepared reference material for that specific assay.\n\nThe droplet volume $v = 0.85\\,\\text{nL}$ was provided but not used to calculate the absolute copy number *per reaction*, $M$. This further highlights that the result is an absolute count. The volume $v$ is, however, essential if one wishes to calculate the concentration of the target molecules in the original sample, which would be $C = \\frac{M}{N \\times v}$.",

            "problem": "A laboratory is planning a digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) assay that partitions a sample into $N=20{,}000$ independent reactions. Assume the standard partitioning model: molecules are independently distributed among partitions according to a Poisson process, and a partition is scored positive if it contains at least one target molecule, with perfect analytical specificity and sensitivity. Let $p$ denote the expected fraction of positive partitions in a single dPCR well, and let $\\lambda$ denote the mean number of target molecules per partition (mean occupancy), which scales linearly with input concentration. The laboratory currently observes $p=0.99$ with its undiluted sample and wishes to modify the pre-partition concentration by a fold-dilution factor $D$ (defined so that $\\lambda \\mapsto \\lambda/D$) to achieve a target $p=0.50$ in a single well using the same $N$. Using only first principles of Poisson occupancy and independent partition scoring, derive the relationship connecting $p$ and $\\lambda$, use it to determine the required $D$, and then explain, in terms of the sampling distribution across $N$ partitions and an appropriate transformation argument, how this change from $p=0.99$ to $p=0.50$ affects the precision of estimating the underlying target concentration. Report only the required fold-dilution factor $D$ as your final numerical answer, and round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Express $D$ as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental Poisson model for digital PCR (dPCR) quantitation, provides all necessary information, and is free of ambiguity. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, deriving the relationship between the fraction of positive partitions ($p$) and the mean number of molecules per partition ($\\lambda$); second, calculating the required dilution factor ($D$); and third, explaining the change in measurement precision.\n\n**1. Relationship between $p$ and $\\lambda$**\n\nThe problem states that the distribution of target molecules into the $N$ partitions follows a Poisson process. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of molecules in a single, randomly selected partition. The probability that a partition contains exactly $k$ molecules is given by the Poisson probability mass function with mean $\\lambda$:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nA partition is scored as negative if and only if it contains zero molecules ($k=0$). The probability of a partition being negative is:\n$$ P(\\text{negative}) = P(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nA partition is scored as positive if it contains at least one molecule ($k \\geq 1$). The probability of a partition being positive is the complement of it being negative:\n$$ P(\\text{positive}) = 1 - P(K=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThe problem defines $p$ as the expected fraction of positive partitions. For a large number of partitions $N$, the observed fraction will converge to this probability. Thus, we establish the core relationship:\n$$ p = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThis equation can be inverted to express $\\lambda$ as a function of $p$:\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - p $$\n$$ \\lambda = -\\ln(1 - p) $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Fold-Dilution Factor $D$**\n\nLet $\\lambda_1$ be the mean occupancy corresponding to the initial observed fraction of positive partitions, $p_1 = 0.99$. Using the derived formula:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -\\ln(1 - p_1) = -\\ln(1 - 0.99) = -\\ln(0.01) $$\nLet $\\lambda_2$ be the target mean occupancy corresponding to the desired fraction of positive partitions, $p_2 = 0.50$:\n$$ \\lambda_2 = -\\ln(1 - p_2) = -\\ln(1 - 0.50) = -\\ln(0.50) $$\nThe fold-dilution factor $D$ is defined such that the new concentration is reduced, leading to a new mean occupancy of $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1 / D$. Therefore, $D$ can be calculated as the ratio of the two mean occupancies:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$:\n$$ D = \\frac{-\\ln(0.01)}{-\\ln(0.50)} = \\frac{\\ln(100)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nWe can now calculate the numerical value:\n$$ D \\approx \\frac{4.605170186}{0.6931471806} \\approx 6.643856190 $$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ D \\approx 6.644 $$\n\n**3. Explanation of the Change in Precision**\n\nThe precision of the dPCR assay refers to the statistical uncertainty in the estimate of the concentration, which is proportional to $\\lambda$. The estimate of $\\lambda$, denoted $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is derived from the observed fraction of positive partitions, $\\hat{p}$.\n\nThe number of positive partitions, $k_{pos}$, among the total of $N$ partitions is a binomially distributed random variable, $k_{pos} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$. The estimator for the true fraction $p$ is $\\hat{p} = k_{pos}/N$, which has a variance of $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$.\n\nThe concentration estimator is obtained via the transformation $\\hat{\\lambda} = -\\ln(1-\\hat{p})$. The \"transformation argument\" required by the problem involves using error propagation (the delta method) to find the variance of $\\hat{\\lambda}$ from the variance of $\\hat{p}$. The variance of a transformed variable $g(\\hat{p})$ is given by $\\text{Var}(g(\\hat{p})) \\approx (g'(p))^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p})$. Here, $g(p) = -\\ln(1-p)$, so the derivative is $g'(p) = \\frac{1}{1-p}$.\n\nThe variance of our estimator $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{N} = \\frac{p}{N(1-p)} $$\nMeasurement precision is inversely related to this variance. To increase precision, we must minimize $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda})$. This variance depends critically on the factor $\\frac{p}{1-p}$.\n\n- At the initial condition $p_1 = 0.99$: The system is highly saturated. The variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_1) \\approx \\frac{0.99}{N(1-0.99)} = \\frac{99}{N}$. In this regime, the number of negative partitions is very small. The random sampling error in this small count is amplified by the non-linear transformation $\\hat{\\lambda} = -\\ln(1-\\hat{p})$, which becomes extremely steep as $\\hat{p} \\to 1$. This leads to a very large variance and poor precision.\n\n- At the target condition $p_2 = 0.50$: The variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_2) \\approx \\frac{0.50}{N(1-0.50)} = \\frac{1}{N}$.\n\nComparing the two, we see that $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_1) = 99 \\times \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_2)$. By diluting the sample from $p=0.99$ to $p=0.50$, the variance of the concentration estimate is reduced by a factor of $99$. This dramatic reduction in uncertainty means the precision of the measurement is substantially improved. The change moves the experiment out of a high-variance saturation regime into a much more statistically stable region where the counts of both positive and negative partitions are substantial, leading to a more robust estimate of the underlying concentration.",
