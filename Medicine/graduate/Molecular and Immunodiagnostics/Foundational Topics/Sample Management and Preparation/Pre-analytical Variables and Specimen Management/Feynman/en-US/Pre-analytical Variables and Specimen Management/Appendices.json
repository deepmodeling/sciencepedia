            "problem": "An immunodiagnostics laboratory measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in plasma by immunonephelometry. A patient’s baseline sample is drawn after being supine for $20$ minutes; the baseline plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is $10.0$ g/L. At a follow-up visit, pre-analytical handling differs: the patient stands quietly for $20$ minutes prior to phlebotomy and then a tourniquet is applied for $2$ minutes immediately before sample collection. On this time scale, posture-induced increases in venous hydrostatic pressure drive plasma water into the interstitial space, reducing plasma volume while leaving the intravascular mass of large proteins essentially unchanged. Assume that, relative to the supine baseline, quiet standing causes a fractional decrease in plasma volume of $\\Delta_{1} = 0.12$, and tourniquet stasis adds an additional fractional decrease of $\\Delta_{2} = 0.05$ relative to the plasma volume immediately before the tourniquet is applied. Assume no net transport of immunoglobulin G (IgG) across the endothelium during these intervals, constant red blood cell (RBC) mass, and that the measured concentration reflects the plasma compartment only.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass for the analyte and without invoking any prefabricated concentration-change formulas, derive the expression for the concentration after two sequential fractional reductions in plasma volume and compute the expected measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration for the follow-up sample.

This practice problem moves beyond simply setting a centrifuge's revolutions per minute (RPM) to a deeper understanding of the physical forces at play, deriving the relationship between RPM and the standardized Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF).

            "solution": "The solution involves deriving the relationship between Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) and Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) from first principles, and then using this relationship to calculate the required RPM for the given parameters.\n\n### Derivation and Relationship\nFirst, we start with the formula for centripetal acceleration, $a_c$:\n$$a_c = \\omega^2 r$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second.\n\nRPM needs to be converted to angular velocity $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega \\, (\\text{rad/s}) = \\text{RPM} \\, (\\text{rev/min}) \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{RPM}}{60} $$\nSubstituting this into the acceleration equation:\n$$ a_c = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{RPM}}{60}\\right)^2 r = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\text{RPM})^2 r}{900} $$\nRCF is the ratio of this acceleration to the standard gravitational acceleration, $g$. The numeric value of the RCF (e.g., 1800) is given by RCF = $a_c/g$.\n$$ \\text{RCF} = \\frac{a_c}{g} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\text{RPM})^2 r}{900 g} $$\nTo find the required RPM for a given RCF and radius, we rearrange this formula:\n$$ (\\text{RPM})^2 = \\frac{900 g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{\\pi^2 r} \\implies \\text{RPM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900 g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{r}} $$\nThis equation shows that for a constant RCF, the required RPM is inversely proportional to the square root of the rotor radius ($ \\text{RPM} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r} $). This means centrifuges with larger rotors can achieve the same RCF at lower speeds.\n\n### Justification of Effective Radius\nSince the sample in a tube occupies a column of liquid, particles at the top ($r_{\\text{min}}$) and bottom ($r_{\\text{max}}$) experience different centrifugal forces. The \"effective radius\" is typically taken as the radius to the midpoint of the liquid column, $r_{\\text{eff}} = (r_{\\text{min}} + r_{\\text{max}})/2$. This provides a representative average RCF for the entire sample volume.\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given:\n- RCF = $1800$ (dimensionless value, representing $1800 \\times g$)\n- Radius, $r = 14.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.142\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Standard gravity, $g \\approx 9.80665\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n\nWe use the derived formula for RPM, substituting the numeric value for RCF:\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{r}} $$\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{(9.80665 \\, \\text{m/s}^2) \\cdot 1800}{0.142 \\, \\text{m}}} $$\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{17651.97}{0.142}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{124309.6479} $$\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} (352.5757) \\approx 3366.8688 $$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$ \\text{RPM} \\approx 3367 $$\nTo achieve an RCF of $1800 \\times g$ with this rotor, the centrifuge must be set to approximately $3367$ RPM.",
