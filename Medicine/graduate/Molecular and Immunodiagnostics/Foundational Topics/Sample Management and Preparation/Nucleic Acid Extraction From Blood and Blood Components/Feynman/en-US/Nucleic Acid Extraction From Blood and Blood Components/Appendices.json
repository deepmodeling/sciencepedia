            "problem": "A silica membrane–based nucleic acid extraction workflow from anticoagulated whole blood relies on chaotropic disruption by guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC) to promote binding of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to silica under high-salt conditions. Consider a sample preparation step in which $500~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of whole blood is mixed with $1.5~\\mathrm{mL}$ of lysis buffer containing $6.0~\\mathrm{M}$ GITC. Assume volumes are additive, the blood itself contributes negligible GITC, and the amount of GITC is conserved upon mixing. Starting from the definition of molarity and conservation of solute, derive the final molar concentration of GITC in the mixture. Then, using the widely cited empirical fact that efficient silica binding in chaotropic conditions typically requires at least $3.0~\\mathrm{M}$ GITC in the binding environment, reason whether the derived concentration meets or exceeds this threshold.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Initial volume of whole blood: $V_{blood} = 500~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n- Initial volume of lysis buffer: $V_{buffer} = 1.5~\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Initial concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC) in lysis buffer: $C_{buffer} = 6.0~\\mathrm{M}$\n- Assumption: Volumes are additive.\n- Assumption: The blood contributes negligible GITC.\n- Assumption: The amount of GITC is conserved upon mixing.\n- Empirical threshold for efficient silica binding: GITC concentration $\\geq 3.0~\\mathrm{M}$\n- Required output: Final molar concentration of GITC, rounded to four significant figures, and a conclusion on whether it meets the threshold.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in the principles of solution chemistry and standard laboratory procedures for nucleic acid extraction. Guanidinium thiocyanate is a widely used chaotropic agent, silica membranes are a standard solid phase, and the concentrations and volumes are realistic for such a protocol. The principle of solute conservation is a fundamental law. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and assumptions (initial volumes, initial concentration, additive volumes, negligible solute contribution from blood) to calculate a unique final concentration. The question is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of the amount of solute (GITC) before and after mixing. The amount of a solute in moles, $n$, in a solution is given by the product of its molar concentration, $C$, and the volume of the solution, $V$.\n$$n = C \\times V$$\n\nFirst, we establish the total amount of GITC, $n_{GITC, total}$, in moles before mixing. This is the sum of the GITC from the lysis buffer and the GITC from the blood.\n$$n_{GITC, total} = n_{GITC, buffer} + n_{GITC, blood}$$\nThe amount of GITC in the lysis buffer is:\n$$n_{GITC, buffer} = C_{buffer} \\times V_{buffer}$$\nThe problem states that the blood contributes a negligible amount of GITC, so we can set $n_{GITC, blood} \\approx 0$. Therefore, the total amount of GITC in the system is effectively equal to the amount in the lysis buffer.\n$$n_{GITC, total} \\approx C_{buffer} \\times V_{buffer}$$\n\nNext, we determine the final volume of the mixture, $V_{final}$. The problem specifies that volumes are additive.\n$$V_{final} = V_{blood} + V_{buffer}$$\n\nThe final concentration of GITC, $C_{final}$, is the total amount of GITC divided by the final volume.\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{n_{GITC, total}}{V_{final}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_{GITC, total}$ and $V_{final}$, we derive the formula for the final concentration:\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{C_{buffer} V_{buffer}}{V_{blood} + V_{buffer}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula. It is critical to ensure that the volume units are consistent. We will convert all volumes to milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$).\nGiven:\n$V_{blood} = 500~\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{buffer} = 1.5~\\mathrm{mL}$\n$C_{buffer} = 6.0~\\mathrm{M} = 6.0~\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe final volume is:\n$$V_{final} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mL} + 1.5~\\mathrm{mL} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe final concentration is:\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{(6.0~\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}) \\times (1.5~\\mathrm{mL})}{(0.5~\\mathrm{mL}) + (1.5~\\mathrm{mL})}$$\nNote that in the ratio of volumes, the units ($\\mathrm{mL}$) cancel, leaving the final concentration in units of $\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$ ($\\mathrm{M}$).\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{6.0~\\mathrm{M} \\times 1.5}{2.0}$$\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{9.0}{2.0}~\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$C_{final} = 4.5~\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{final} = 4.500~\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nFinally, we must reason whether this concentration meets or exceeds the typical threshold for efficient silica binding, which is given as $\\geq 3.0~\\mathrm{M}$ GITC.\nWe compare the calculated final concentration, $C_{final} = 4.500~\\mathrm{M}$, to the threshold concentration, $C_{threshold} = 3.0~\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$4.500~\\mathrm{M} > 3.0~\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe calculated final concentration of GITC in the mixture exceeds the required minimum threshold. Therefore, the conditions are sufficient for efficient binding of DNA to the silica membrane. The final numerical answer requested is the concentration.",

            "problem": "A solid-phase extraction workflow is applied to a blood plasma sample to isolate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA). The workflow consists of three sequential steps that transform the cfDNA mass: capture onto a silica surface, washing to remove contaminants, and elution into a final buffer. The initial input cfDNA mass is $m_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ng}$. In this context, capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of $m_{0}$ that binds to the solid phase under the binding conditions; wash loss is defined as the fraction of the captured cfDNA that is lost during washing; and elution recovery is defined as the fraction of the post-wash bound cfDNA that is recovered into the eluate.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass conservation as applied to a standard biochemical workflow (solid-phase extraction), well-posed with all necessary data and definitions provided, and objective in its language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the mass of cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) through a three-step extraction process. We will apply the principle of mass conservation at each step, using the provided definitions for efficiency and loss.\n\nLet $m_{0}$ be the initial mass of cfDNA, given as $m_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\nLet $C_{E}$ be the capture efficiency, given as $C_{E} = 0.80$.\nLet $W_{L}$ be the wash loss, given as $W_{L} = 0.10$.\nLet $E_{R}$ be the elution recovery, given as $E_{R} = 0.85$.\nLet $m_{f}$ be the final mass of cfDNA recovered.\n\nThe process unfolds sequentially. We will track the mass of cfDNA at the end of each step.\n\nStep 1: Capture\nThe capture efficiency, $C_{E}$, is defined as the fraction of the initial mass $m_{0}$ that binds to the solid phase. Let $m_{1}$ be the mass of cfDNA bound to the solid phase after the capture step. According to the definition:\n$$m_{1} = m_{0} \\cdot C_{E}$$\n\nStep 2: Washing\nThe wash loss, $W_{L}$, is defined as the fraction of the *captured* cfDNA that is lost during the wash step. The captured mass is $m_{1}$. Therefore, the mass lost during washing is $m_{1} \\cdot W_{L}$. The mass remaining on the solid phase after washing, which we denote as $m_{2}$, is the captured mass minus the mass lost.\n$$m_{2} = m_{1} - (m_{1} \\cdot W_{L})$$\nThis can be factored to represent the fraction of mass retained:\n$$m_{2} = m_{1} (1 - W_{L})$$\nThe term $(1 - W_{L})$ represents the wash retention efficiency.\n\nStep 3: Elution\nThe elution recovery, $E_{R}$, is defined as the fraction of the *post-wash bound* cfDNA that is recovered into the final eluate. The post-wash-bound mass is $m_{2}$. The final recovered mass, $m_{f}$, is therefore:\n$$m_{f} = m_{2} \\cdot E_{R}$$\n\nTo derive the expression relating the final mass $m_{f}$ to the initial mass $m_{0}$, we substitute the expressions for $m_{2}$ and $m_{1}$ into the final equation:\n$$m_{f} = (m_{1} (1 - W_{L})) \\cdot E_{R}$$\nSubstituting $m_{1} = m_{0} \\cdot C_{E}$:\n$$m_{f} = (m_{0} \\cdot C_{E} \\cdot (1 - W_{L})) \\cdot E_{R}$$\nThis is the general expression for the final mass as a function of the initial mass and the step-by-step process efficiencies.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $m_{f}$ using the provided values:\n$m_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ng}$\n$C_{E} = 0.80$\n$W_{L} = 0.10$\n$E_{R} = 0.85$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$m_{f} = 20 \\cdot (0.80) \\cdot (1 - 0.10) \\cdot (0.85)$$\nFirst, calculate the term for wash retention:\n$$1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n$$m_{f} = 20 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 0.90 \\cdot 0.85$$\nWe perform the multiplication sequentially:\nMass after capture ($m_{1}$):\n$$m_{1} = 20 \\cdot 0.80 = 16\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\nMass after washing ($m_{2}$):\n$$m_{2} = 16 \\cdot 0.90 = 14.4\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\nFinal mass after elution ($m_{f}$):\n$$m_{f} = 14.4 \\cdot 0.85 = 12.24\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $12.24$ already has four significant figures ($1$, $2$, $2$, and $4$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary. The final mass is $12.24\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.",
