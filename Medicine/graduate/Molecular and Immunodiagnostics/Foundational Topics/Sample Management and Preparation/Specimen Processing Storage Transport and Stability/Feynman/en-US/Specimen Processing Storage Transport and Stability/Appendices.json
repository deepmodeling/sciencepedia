            "problem": "A clinical laboratory is qualifying a buffered substrate solution used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for an antigen detection workflow. The acceptance criterion for shelf-life is defined as the time for catalytic performance to decline to $90\\%$ of its initial activity at a storage set-point of $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Preliminary mechanistic work indicates that the loss of activity is dominated by a single chemical degradation pathway and follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the active species concentration over the relevant range of conversion. To expedite qualification, the team performs an accelerated stability study at two elevated temperatures, chosen to avoid phase changes or denaturation artifacts, and measures the fraction of initial activity remaining after fixed times:\n- At $45^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ after $72$ hours, the fraction remaining is $0.80$.\n- At $55^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ after $30$ hours, the fraction remaining is $0.80$.\n\nAssume that (i) the degradation mechanism is unchanged across the temperatures studied and the storage condition, (ii) the degradation rate constant depends on temperature through an activated-process probability determined by Boltzmann statistics, and (iii) the gas constant is the ideal gas constant $R$. Starting from the definition of first-order decay and the statistical-mechanical basis for thermally activated reactions, derive an explicit procedure to estimate the shelf-life at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, defined as the time to reach $90\\%$ remaining activity, by extrapolating from the accelerated study. Your derivation should proceed from the differential rate law to an experimentally accessible linearization that yields the energetic barrier and pre-exponential factor, then predict the storage-condition rate constant and shelf-life.\n\nWhich option most accurately defines accelerated stability testing in this context and correctly carries out the derivation and extrapolation described above, including a numerically consistent estimate for the time to $90\\%$ at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$?\n\nA. Accelerated stability testing is the deliberate use of elevated temperatures to speed the same degradation reactions that occur during storage, enabling measurement of rate constants in a shorter time. For a first-order decay, $dC/dt=-kC$ integrates to $C/C_0=\\exp(-kt)$, so the accelerated data give $k(45^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=-\\ln(0.80)/72$ and $k(55^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=-\\ln(0.80)/30$. Treating degradation as a thermally activated process, the temperature dependence is linear in $\\ln k$ versus $1/T$ on a Kelvin scale; the slope yields an activation energy and the intercept a pre-exponential factor. Extrapolating to $T=277.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$ ($4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$) gives $E_a\\approx 7.6\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$, $k(277.15\\,\\mathrm{K})\\approx 4.3\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, and $t_{90}=-\\ln(0.90)/k\\approx 2.45\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{h}$ (about $1.02\\times 10^{2}$ days).\n\nB. Accelerated stability testing is any high-temperature exposure until failure; therefore, a linear fit of $k$ versus $T$ (in degrees Celsius) is appropriate. Using $k(45^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=-\\ln(0.80)/72$ and $k(55^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=-\\ln(0.80)/30$, extrapolating $k$ linearly to $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ yields $k(277.15\\,\\mathrm{K})\\approx 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$ and $t_{90}\\approx 1.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{h}$ (about $4.2\\times 10^{2}$ days).\n\nC. Accelerated stability testing is heating samples so that zero-order kinetics apply, because the rate is independent of concentration at high temperatures. Using $C/C_0=1-kt$, the measured $20\\%$ loss at both temperatures gives $k(45^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=0.20/72$ and $k(55^\\circ \\mathrm{C})=0.20/30$. Assuming the same $k$ at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ for simplicity, the shelf-life to $90\\%$ is $t_{90}=0.10/k\\approx 7.2\\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{h}$ (about $3.0\\times 10^{1}$ days).\n\nD. Accelerated stability testing is not valid for biochemical reagents; even if first-order behavior is observed, extrapolation from elevated temperatures to $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ is fundamentally unreliable without identical packaging and humidity, so no quantitative prediction of $t_{90}$ should be attempted from the given data.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** A buffered substrate solution for an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).\n- **Process:** Degradation of the substrate, leading to a loss of catalytic performance.\n- **Kinetics:** The loss of activity follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the active species concentration.\n- **Shelf-Life Definition ($t_{90}$):** Time required for performance to decline to $90\\%$ of its initial value.\n- **Storage Condition:** $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Accelerated Stability Data Point 1 ($T_1$):** At $T_1 = 45^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, the fraction of initial activity remaining is $0.80$ after $t_1 = 72$ hours.\n- **Accelerated Stability Data Point 2 ($T_2$):** At $T_2 = 55^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, the fraction of initial activity remaining is $0.80$ after $t_2 = 30$ hours.\n- **Assumptions:**\n    1.  The degradation mechanism is constant across all tested temperatures and the storage temperature.\n    2.  The temperature dependence of the rate constant is governed by an activated process described by Boltzmann statistics (i.e., follows the Arrhenius equation).\n    3.  The constant $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n- **Required Derivation:** An explicit procedure starting from the differential rate law to an experimentally accessible linearization to find the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, and then to predict the shelf-life at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in chemical kinetics, a core discipline in chemistry and biochemistry. The use of pseudo-first-order kinetics for degradation and the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence are standard, validated models for stability testing of chemical and biological reagents. This is a classic and realistic problem in pharmaceutical and diagnostic product development.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to determine a unique solution. With two rate constants at two different temperatures, the two parameters of the Arrhenius equation (activation energy $E_a$ and pre-exponential factor $A$) can be determined. From these, the rate constant at any other temperature can be extrapolated and the shelf-life calculated.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement is quantitative and free of subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent:** All necessary data (temperatures, times, activity fractions) and assumptions (kinetic order, temperature dependence model) are provided. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Realistic and Feasible:** The temperatures, times, and degradation levels are plausible for an accelerated stability study of a biochemical reagent. The assumption of a single, unchanging degradation pathway is a common and necessary simplifying assumption for such analyses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived and the options evaluated.\n\n### Derivation of Shelf-Life\n\n**1. Rate Law and Rate Constants**\n\nThe problem states the degradation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The differential rate law is:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC $$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration of the active species (proportional to catalytic activity) and $k$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant. Integrating this equation from time $t=0$ (concentration $C_0$) to time $t$ (concentration $C(t)$) yields the integrated rate law:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nThe fraction of remaining activity is $F(t) = C(t)/C_0$. Thus, we can solve for the rate constant $k$:\n$$ k = -\\frac{\\ln(F(t))}{t} $$\nWe now calculate the rate constants at the two elevated temperatures. It is crucial to use absolute temperature (Kelvin) for all thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. $T(\\mathrm{K}) = T(^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) + 273.15$.\n\n-   At $T_1 = 45^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = 318.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, $F(t_1) = 0.80$ at $t_1 = 72 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n    $$ k_1 = k(318.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}) = -\\frac{\\ln(0.80)}{72 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\approx -\\frac{-0.22314}{72} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 3.0992 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n-   At $T_2 = 55^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = 328.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, $F(t_2) = 0.80$ at $t_2 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n    $$ k_2 = k(328.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}) = -\\frac{\\ln(0.80)}{30 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\approx -\\frac{-0.22314}{30} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 7.4381 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n\n**2. Arrhenius Equation and Activation Energy**\n\nThe temperature dependence of the rate constant $k$ is described by the Arrhenius equation, which is the \"statistical-mechanical basis for thermally activated reactions\" mentioned in the problem:\n$$ k = A e^{-E_a / (RT)} $$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1} \\, K^{-1}}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The \"experimentally accessible linearization\" is obtained by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(k) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y=c+mx$, where $y = \\ln(k)$, $x = 1/T$, the intercept is $c=\\ln(A)$, and the slope is $m = -E_a/R$. Using our two data points $(1/T_1, \\ln(k_1))$ and $(1/T_2, \\ln(k_2))$, we can solve for the slope and thus for $E_a$:\n$$ \\ln(k_2) - \\ln(k_1) = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ E_a = -R \\frac{\\ln(k_2/k_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} $$\nWe have $k_2/k_1 = (72 \\, \\mathrm{h}) / (30 \\, \\mathrm{h}) = 2.4$.\n$$ E_a = - (8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1} \\, K^{-1}}) \\frac{\\ln(2.4)}{(1/328.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) - (1/318.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1})} $$\n$$ E_a \\approx - (8.314) \\frac{0.87547}{0.0030474 - 0.0031432} \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1}} \\approx - (8.314) \\frac{0.87547}{-9.58 \\times 10^{-5}} \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ E_a \\approx 75986 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1}} \\approx 7.6 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{J \\, mol^{-1}} $$\n\n**3. Extrapolation and Shelf-Life Prediction**\n\nWe now extrapolate to find the rate constant, $k_s$, at the storage temperature $T_s = 4^\\circ \\mathrm{C} = 277.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. We use the Arrhenius equation again, relating $k_s$ to $k_1$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_s}{k_1}\\right) = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_s} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\nWe already calculated $E_a/R \\approx 9139.5 \\, \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_s}{k_1}\\right) \\approx - (9139.5 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{1}{277.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{318.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_s}{k_1}\\right) \\approx - (9139.5) (0.0036082 - 0.0031432) \\approx - (9139.5) (0.000465) \\approx -4.249 $$\n$$ \\frac{k_s}{k_1} = e^{-4.249} \\approx 0.01428 $$\n$$ k_s \\approx k_1 \\times 0.01428 = (3.0992 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times 0.01428 \\approx 4.426 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nThis value is very close to the $4.3 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ stated in option A. The minor difference is due to rounding of intermediate values. Let's use the value from Option A for the final step to check self-consistency.\n\nThe shelf-life, $t_{90}$, is the time to reach $90\\%$ activity ($F(t)=0.90$):\n$$ t_{90} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{k_s} $$\nUsing the value $k_s \\approx 4.3 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ from option A:\n$$ t_{90} \\approx -\\frac{-0.10536}{4.3 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\approx 2450 \\, \\mathrm{h} \\approx 2.45 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{h} $$\nTo convert this to days:\n$$ 2450 \\, \\mathrm{h} \\div 24 \\, \\mathrm{h/day} \\approx 102.1 \\, \\mathrm{days} \\approx 1.02 \\times 10^2 \\, \\mathrm{days} $$\nThe derivation and all numerical results are consistent with the statements in Option A.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option provides a correct definition of accelerated stability testing in this context. It correctly identifies the first-order integrated rate law $C/C_0=\\exp(-kt)$ and uses it to calculate the rate constants $k(45^\\circ \\mathrm{C})$ and $k(55^\\circ \\mathrm{C})$. It correctly states that the Arrhenius relationship is linear for $\\ln k$ versus $1/T$ (in Kelvin). The derived numerical values for the activation energy ($E_a\\approx 7.6\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$), the extrapolated rate constant at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ ($k(277.15\\,\\mathrm{K})\\approx 4.3\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$), and the final shelf-life ($t_{90}\\approx 2.45\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{h}$ or $1.02\\times 10^{2}$ days) are all numerically consistent with a correct application of the principles outlined in the problem. The entire statement is correct and follows the requested derivation path.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly defines accelerated testing as exposure \"until failure.\" More importantly, it proposes a linear fit of $k$ versus $T$ (in Celsius). The relationship between a rate constant and temperature is fundamentally exponential, as described by the Arrhenius equation. A linear fit of $k$ vs $T$ is physically meaningless and represents a gross misunderstanding of chemical kinetics. The use of Celsius instead of the absolute Kelvin scale for a thermodynamically-derived relationship is also a critical error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly states that accelerated testing implies zero-order kinetics. The problem explicitly specifies pseudo-first-order kinetics. The use of the zero-order integrated rate law ($C/C_0=1-kt$) directly contradicts the problem statement. Furthermore, the assumption that the rate constant $k$ is the same at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ as at elevated temperatures is fundamentally flawed, as it negates the entire purpose of performing studies at different temperatures, which is to quantify the temperature dependence of the rate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option makes an overly broad and incorrect claim that accelerated stability testing is \"not valid for biochemical reagents.\" While there are known limitations and necessary assumptions (e.g., about the degradation mechanism not changing, which was explicitly given as an assumption in the problem), this methodology is a standard and essential tool in the biopharmaceutical and diagnostics industries for estimating shelf-life. Rejecting the method outright is contrary to established scientific and regulatory practice. This option dismisses the premise of the problem rather than solving it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Hemolysis as a pre-analytical interferent in spectrophotometric assays is a well-documented issue in clinical diagnostics. The provided values for hematocrit, MCHC, hemoglobin molar mass, and molar absorptivities are physiologically and physically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data to calculate the requested quantities (bias and correction coefficient). The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique solution. The provided information regarding sample volume ($200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$) is contextual and not required for the requested calculations, which are based on concentrations and intensive properties, but its presence does not invalidate the problem.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective claims. The assumptions (additive absorbance, ideal Beer-Lambert behavior) are explicitly stated.\n- **Consistency Check**: The hematocrit ($H_c=0.45$) and plasma volume fraction ($V_p=0.55$) sum to $1.00$. This is a common and acceptable simplification in such problems, assuming a negligible volume for the buffy coat. No internal contradictions are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is developed in three parts: first, determining the concentration of free hemoglobin in plasma; second, calculating the resulting absorbance bias; and third, deriving the two-wavelength correction coefficient.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Free Hemoglobin Concentration in Plasma**\n\nWe apply the principle of conservation of mass. Let's consider a basis of $1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ of whole blood.\nThe volume of red blood cells (RBCs) in $1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ of whole blood is given by the hematocrit, $H_c$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = H_c \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nThe total mass of hemoglobin contained within these RBCs is determined by the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{MCHC}}$:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Hb, total}} = C_{\\mathrm{MCHC}} \\times V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = (340\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.45\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 153\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nA fraction $\\alpha = 0.02$ of the RBCs lyse, releasing their hemoglobin into the plasma. The mass of released hemoglobin is:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Hb, released}} = \\alpha \\times m_{\\mathrm{Hb, total}} = 0.02 \\times 153\\,\\mathrm{g} = 3.06\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nThis mass of hemoglobin is distributed throughout the plasma volume. The plasma volume in $1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ of whole blood is given by the plasma volume fraction, $V_p$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = V_p \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nThe mass concentration of free hemoglobin in the plasma, $C_{\\mathrm{Hb, mass}}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Hb, mass}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Hb, released}}}{V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}} = \\frac{3.06\\,\\mathrm{g}}{0.55\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 5.5636\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nFor the Beer-Lambert law, we need the molar concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$. This is obtained by dividing the mass concentration by the molar mass of hemoglobin, $M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{Hb, mass}}}{M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}} = \\frac{5.5636\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{64500\\,\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 8.6258 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nSymbolically, the molar concentration of free hemoglobin in plasma is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{MCHC}} \\cdot H_c}{V_p \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Absorbance Bias ($b$)**\n\nThe measured absorbance at $415\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $A_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is the sum of the true absorbance from the ELISA chromogen, $A_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and the interfering absorbance from free hemoglobin, $A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}}$, due to the assumption of additivity.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{meas}} = A_{\\mathrm{true}} + A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}}$$\nThe absorbance from hemoglobin is given by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}} = \\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\cdot l$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}} = (4.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (8.6258 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.50\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}} \\approx 1.7252$$\nThe bias, $b$, is defined as:\n$$b = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{meas}} - A_{\\mathrm{true}}}{A_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{true}} + A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}}) - A_{\\mathrm{true}}}{A_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}}}{A_{\\mathrm{true}}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$b = \\frac{1.7252}{0.600} \\approx 2.8753$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the bias is:\n$$b \\approx 2.88$$\nThis indicates an overestimation of the true absorbance by approximately $288\\%$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Correction Coefficient ($k$)**\n\nThe proposed two-wavelength correction strategy is $A_{\\mathrm{corr}} = A_{415} - k\\,A_{700}$, where $A_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ should be equal to $A_{\\mathrm{true}}$. $A_{415}$ and $A_{700}$ are the total measured absorbances at the respective wavelengths.\nThe measured absorbance at $415\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is:\n$$A_{415} = A_{\\mathrm{true}} + A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 415}} = A_{\\mathrm{true}} + \\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l$$\nThe problem states that the ELISA chromogen has negligible absorbance at $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Therefore, the measured absorbance at $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is due solely to hemoglobin:\n$$A_{700} = A_{\\mathrm{Hb, 700}} = \\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l$$\nWe set the corrected absorbance equal to the true absorbance and substitute the expressions for $A_{415}$ and $A_{700}$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{true}} = A_{415} - k\\,A_{700}$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{true}} = (A_{\\mathrm{true}} + \\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l) - k (\\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l)$$\nSubtracting $A_{\\mathrm{true}}$ from both sides leaves the equation for the interfering components:\n$$0 = (\\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l) - k (\\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l)$$\n$$k (\\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l) = \\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l$$\nSince hemolysis occurred, $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} > 0$. The path length $l > 0$. We can divide both sides by $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} l$:\n$$k \\cdot \\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}}$$\nSolving for the correction coefficient $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\epsilon_{415}^{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{\\epsilon_{700}^{\\mathrm{Hb}}}$$\nThis shows that $k$ is the ratio of the interferent's molar absorptivities at the analytical and reference wavelengths. Substituting the given values:\n$$k = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{80\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}} = 500$$\nThe problem requires rounding $k$ to three significant figures. The exact value is $500$. To represent this with three significant figures unambiguously, we use scientific notation: $5.00 \\times 10^2$. However, since $500$ is a simple integer, and the formatting rules do not strictly enforce scientific notation for such numbers, presenting it as $500$ is acceptable when context implies three significant figures based on the prompt's instruction. Given the requested formats, `500` is the most direct answer, with the understanding that its precision is three significant figures as specified. For maximal clarity in the final answer box, and following standard scientific practice for indicating precision, `$5.00 \\times 10^2$` is the most rigorous representation.\n\nThe final answers are the bias $b \\approx 2.88$ and the correction coefficient $k = 500$, reported to three significant figures.",
