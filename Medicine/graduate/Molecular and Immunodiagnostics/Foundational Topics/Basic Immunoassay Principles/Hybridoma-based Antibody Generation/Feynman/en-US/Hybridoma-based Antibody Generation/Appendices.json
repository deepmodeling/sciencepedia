This practice invites you to model this process by applying principles of bimolecular reaction kinetics, a concept borrowed from physical chemistry. By deriving the relationship between fusion efficiency, cell ratios, and other experimental parameters, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how to optimize the initial yield of viable hybridoma cells, bridging the gap between benchtop procedure and fundamental rate laws .",

            "problem": "A murine hybridoma generation protocol mixes antibody-producing spleen lymphocytes and Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient myeloma cells in a well-stirred suspension of volume $V$, and briefly exposes the mixture to Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of concentration $c$ for a duration $t$, enabling membrane fusion to occur. In the encounter-limited, low-conversion regime in which the number of formed hybrids is much smaller than the number of input cells, the instantaneous rate of heterotypic encounters between spleen cells and myeloma cells can be modeled by the law of mass action for bimolecular collisions, and the probability that a given heterotypic encounter results in a successful membrane fusion is a monotone function of $c$ denoted $p(c)$.\n\nLet $N_s$ and $N_m$ be the initial numbers of spleen and myeloma cells, respectively, and $n_s = N_s/V$, $n_m = N_m/V$ their number densities. Define the cell ratio $r = N_s/N_m$. Define the overall fusion efficiency $\\eta$ as the fraction of the total input cells that end up as fused hybrids after the PEG exposure, i.e., $\\eta = N_h/(N_s + N_m)$ where $N_h$ is the number of hybrids formed.\n\nStarting from first principles (well-mixed collision kinetics and the mass action dependence of heterotypic encounters), derive the functional dependence of $\\eta$ on $r$ and $c$ under the assumptions stated, keeping any kinetic constants symbolic. Then, using your derived framework and taking an overall fusion efficiency of $0.005$, calculate the expected number of hybrids formed when $N_s = 2 \\times 10^{7}$ and $N_m = 5 \\times 10^{6}$. Express the final expected number of hybrids as a plain number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The premises are based on standard principles of bimolecular reaction kinetics applied to cell populations, a valid modeling approach in quantitative biology. All necessary definitions and simplifying assumptions are provided, and no contradictions are present. The problem is divided into two parts: a theoretical derivation and a numerical calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the functional dependence of the overall fusion efficiency, $\\eta$, on the cell ratio, $r$, and the PEG concentration, $c$.\n\nLet $S$ denote a spleen lymphocyte and $M$ denote a myeloma cell. The formation of a hybrid cell, $H$, can be represented as a bimolecular reaction: $S + M \\rightarrow H$. The problem states that the rate of heterotypic encounters follows the law of mass action. The rate of hybrid formation per unit volume is proportional to the product of the number densities of the reacting cells, $n_s(t)$ and $n_m(t)$, the bimolecular rate constant for encounters, $k$, and the probability of successful fusion upon encounter, $p(c)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the number density of hybrids, $n_h = N_h/V$, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_h}{dt} = k \\cdot p(c) \\cdot n_s(t) \\cdot n_m(t)\n$$\nwhere $t$ is time. Since the volume $V$ is constant, we can write the rate of change of the number of hybrids, $N_h$, as:\n$$\n\\frac{d(N_h/V)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dN_h}{dt} = k \\cdot p(c) \\cdot \\frac{N_s(t)}{V} \\cdot \\frac{N_m(t)}{V}\n$$\nMultiplying by $V$ gives the rate of change for the total number of hybrids:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_h}{dt} = \\frac{k \\cdot p(c)}{V} \\cdot N_s(t) \\cdot N_m(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a \"low-conversion regime in which the number of formed hybrids is much smaller than the number of input cells\". This is a critical simplifying assumption. It implies that the consumption of spleen and myeloma cells to form hybrids is negligible over the duration of the experiment, $t$. Therefore, we can approximate their numbers as constant and equal to their initial values:\n$$\nN_s(t) \\approx N_s \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_m(t) \\approx N_m\n$$\nUnder this approximation, the rate of hybrid formation becomes constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_h}{dt} \\approx \\frac{k \\cdot p(c)}{V} \\cdot N_s \\cdot N_m\n$$\nTo find the total number of hybrids, $N_h$, formed after the PEG exposure duration $t$, we integrate this constant rate from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$\nN_h = \\int_0^t \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot p(c)}{V} \\cdot N_s \\cdot N_m\\right) dt' = \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot p(c) \\cdot t}{V}\\right) N_s N_m\n$$\nThe overall fusion efficiency, $\\eta$, is defined as $\\eta = N_h / (N_s + N_m)$. Substituting our expression for $N_h$:\n$$\n\\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{N_s + N_m} \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot t \\cdot p(c)}{V} \\cdot N_s N_m\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the dependence on the cell ratio $r = N_s/N_m$. Let $N_{tot} = N_s + N_m$ be the total number of initial cells. We can express $N_s$ and $N_m$ in terms of $N_{tot}$ and $r$:\nFrom $N_s = r N_m$, we have $N_{tot} = r N_m + N_m = (r+1)N_m$, which gives $N_m = \\frac{N_{tot}}{r+1}$.\nConsequently, $N_s = r N_m = \\frac{r N_{tot}}{r+1}$.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for $N_s$ and $N_m$ back into the equation for $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{N_{tot}} \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot t \\cdot p(c)}{V} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{r N_{tot}}{r+1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{N_{tot}}{r+1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta \\approx \\frac{k \\cdot t \\cdot p(c)}{V N_{tot}} \\cdot \\frac{r N_{tot}^2}{(r+1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot t \\cdot N_{tot}}{V}\\right) p(c) \\frac{r}{(r+1)^2}\n$$\nThis expression shows the functional dependence of $\\eta$ on $r$ and $c$ (via the function $p(c)$). The term in parentheses, $K = \\frac{k \\cdot t \\cdot N_{tot}}{V}$, is a dimensionless constant that depends on the specific experimental conditions (rate constant, time, total cell number, and volume) but not on the cell ratio $r$ or PEG concentration $c$. Thus, the functional dependence is:\n$$\n\\eta(r,c) \\propto p(c) \\frac{r}{(r+1)^2}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to calculate the expected number of hybrids, $N_h$, for a specific case. The problem provides the following values:\nOverall fusion efficiency, $\\eta = 0.005$.\nInitial number of spleen cells, $N_s = 2 \\times 10^{7}$.\nInitial number of myeloma cells, $N_m = 5 \\times 10^{6}$.\n\nThe relationship between these quantities is given by the definition of $\\eta$ in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{N_h}{N_s + N_m}\n$$\nThis calculation does not require the derived functional form of $\\eta$, but relies on the definitions established within the problem's framework. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $N_h$:\n$$\nN_h = \\eta \\cdot (N_s + N_m)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the total number of input cells, $N_s + N_m$:\n$$\nN_s + N_m = (2 \\times 10^{7}) + (5 \\times 10^{6}) = (20 \\times 10^{6}) + (5 \\times 10^{6}) = 25 \\times 10^{6} = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values of $\\eta$ and $(N_s + N_m)$ to find $N_h$:\n$$\nN_h = 0.005 \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{7})\n$$\n$$\nN_h = (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{7})\n$$\n$$\nN_h = 12.5 \\times 10^{(-3+7)} = 12.5 \\times 10^{4}\n$$\nExpressing this in standard numerical form:\n$$\nN_h = 125000\n$$\nThis is the expected number of hybrids formed.",

This exercise explores the statistical foundation of limiting dilution, the standard technique used to achieve this monoclonality.

The fusion product is plated across a microtiter plate using a Poisson dispensing process such that the number of total cells arriving in any well is modeled as a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda$. After plating, each individual plated cell independently has probability $p$ of being a viable, outgrowing, antibody-secreting hybridoma clone.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the conditional probability that a well is monoclonal, given that it is positive, and its subsequent evaluation for a specific set of parameters. We begin by formalizing the provided model.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the total number of cells dispensed into a single well. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function (PMF) of $N$ is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}, \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\n\nLet $C$ be the random variable representing the number of viable, outgrowing, antibody-secreting hybridoma clones in the same well. Each of the $N$ cells plated has an independent probability $p$ of becoming such a clone. Therefore, conditional on a specific number of cells $k$ being plated (i.e., $N=k$), the number of viable clones $C$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$C | (N=k) \\sim \\text{Binomial}(k, p)$$\nThe conditional PMF is:\n$$P(C=j | N=k) = \\binom{k}{j} p^j (1-p)^{k-j}, \\quad \\text{for } j = 0, 1, \\dots, k$$\n\nTo find the unconditional distribution of $C$, we apply the law of total probability, summing over all possible values of $k$:\n$$P(C=j) = \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} P(C=j | N=k) P(N=k)$$\nThe sum starts from $k=j$ because the number of viable clones $j$ cannot exceed the total number of cells $k$.\nSubstituting the PMFs for the binomial and Poisson distributions:\n$$P(C=j) = \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{k!}{j!(k-j)!} p^j (1-p)^{k-j} \\right] \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\right]$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling $k!$:\n$$P(C=j) = \\frac{p^j e^{-\\lambda}}{j!} \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\frac{(1-p)^{k-j} \\lambda^k}{(k-j)!}$$\nTo further simplify, we factor out $\\lambda^j$ from $\\lambda^k = \\lambda^j \\lambda^{k-j}$:\n$$P(C=j) = \\frac{(\\lambda p)^j e^{-\\lambda}}{j!} \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-p))^{k-j}}{(k-j)!}$$\nLet the index of summation be changed to $m = k-j$.

Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(M|A) = \\frac{P(M \\cap A)}{P(A)}$$\nThe event $M \\cap A$ is the event that a well has exactly one viable clone ($C=1$) AND at least one viable clone ($C \\ge 1$). This intersection is simply the event $M$ itself, as having exactly one clone implies having at least one. Thus, $M \\cap A = M$.\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$$P(M|A) = \\frac{P(M)}{P(A)}$$\nWe can now calculate $P(M)$ and $P(A)$ using the PMF for $C \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda p)$.\nThe probability of a well being monoclonal is:\n$$P(M) = P(C=1) = \\frac{(\\lambda p)^1 e^{-\\lambda p}}{1!} = \\lambda p e^{-\\lambda p}$$\nThe probability of a well being positive is the complement of it having zero viable clones:\n$$P(A) = P(C \\ge 1) = 1 - P(C=0)$$\n$$P(C=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda p)^0 e^{-\\lambda p}}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda p}$$\nTherefore,\n$$P(A) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda p}$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for the conditional probability:\n$$P(M|A) = \\frac{\\lambda p e^{-\\lambda p}}{1 - e^{-\\lambda p}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the probability that a positive well is monoclonal.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $\\lambda=0.5$ and $p=0.30$.\nFirst, we compute the mean of the distribution of viable clones, $\\lambda p$:\n$$\\lambda p = 0.5 \\times 0.30 = 0.15$$\nSubstituting this value into the derived formula:\n$$P(M|A) = \\frac{0.15 \\exp(-0.15)}{1 - \\exp(-0.15)}$$\nWe calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-0.15) \\approx 0.860707976$$\nNumerator: $0.15 \\times 0.860707976 \\approx 0.129106196$\nDenominator: $1 - 0.860707976 \\approx 0.139292024$\n$$P(M|A) \\approx \\frac{0.129106196}{0.139292024} \\approx 0.926872506$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
