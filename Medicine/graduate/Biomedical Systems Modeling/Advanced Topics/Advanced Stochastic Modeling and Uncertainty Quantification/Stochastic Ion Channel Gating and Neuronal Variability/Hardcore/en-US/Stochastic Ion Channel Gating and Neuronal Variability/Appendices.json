This first practice focuses on the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), a cornerstone method for generating exact numerical realizations of continuous-time Markov processes. By deriving the waiting time distribution and event selection rule from first principles, you will gain a deep understanding of how microscopic transition probabilities translate into the dynamic, random behavior of a channel population .",

            "problem": "Consider a population of $N$ identical, independent, two-state ion channels, each in either a closed state $C$ or an open state $O$. Under voltage-clamp conditions, the membrane potential $V$ is held constant between channel gating events. A channel in state $C$ transitions to state $O$ with voltage-dependent rate $k_{CO}(V)$, and a channel in state $O$ transitions to state $C$ with voltage-dependent rate $k_{OC}(V)$. At time $t$, denote the number of closed channels by $n_C(t)$ and the number of open channels by $n_O(t)$, with $n_C(t) + n_O(t) = N$. Assume $k_{CO}(V)$ and $k_{OC}(V)$ are finite and positive for the clamped $V$, and that channels gate independently.\n\nStarting from the definitions of a continuous-time Markov process with memoryless transitions and the independence of channels, derive the distribution of the waiting time to the next gating event and the rule for selecting the identity and type of the next event. Use these derivations to characterize how the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) would be executed for this system under the stated voltage-clamp assumption.\n\nWhich option best and completely describes the event-time distribution and event-selection procedure used by the Gillespie SSA for this system?\n\nA. Under voltage clamp, treat $k_{CO}(V)$ and $k_{OC}(V)$ as constants within each inter-event interval. The waiting time $\\tau$ to the next event is exponentially distributed with rate $a_0 = n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V) + n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)$. The next event is a $C \\to O$ opening with probability $n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V)/a_0$ and an $O \\to C$ closing with probability $n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)/a_0$; the specific channel is chosen uniformly at random within the corresponding state class. The SSA steps are: compute $a_0$, draw $\\tau$ from $\\mathrm{Exponential}(a_0)$, draw the event type by proportionally sampling the propensities, update $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$ and the time $t \\leftarrow t + \\tau$, and repeat.\n\nB. Because there are $N$ channels, the waiting time $\\tau$ is gamma distributed with shape parameter $N$ and rate parameter $k_{CO}(V) + k_{OC}(V)$; the identity of the next event is chosen with equal probability between opening and closing, and then the specific channel is chosen uniformly at random over all channels.\n\nC. The waiting time $\\tau$ is exponentially distributed with rate $\\max\\{k_{CO}(V),\\,k_{OC}(V)\\}$, independent of $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$; the type of event is determined by whichever rate is larger, and the specific channel is the one with the fastest rate.\n\nD. Because $k_{CO}(V)$ and $k_{OC}(V)$ depend on membrane voltage, the waiting time density is $f(\\tau) = a_0(V(t+\\tau))\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-\\int_0^\\tau a_0(V(t+s))\\,ds\\big)$ with $a_0(V) = n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V) + n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)$, and the event type is selected by normalizing $n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V(t+\\tau))$ and $n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V(t+\\tau))$ at the realized $\\tau$.\n\nE. The waiting time $\\tau$ is exponentially distributed with rate $a_0 = n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V) + n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)$, but the next event is an opening with probability $k_{CO}(V)/(k_{CO}(V) + k_{OC}(V))$ and a closing with probability $k_{OC}(V)/(k_{CO}(V) + k_{OC}(V))$, independent of $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$.",
            "solution": "We begin from the principle that the gating of each channel is described by a continuous-time Markov process with memoryless transitions. Under voltage-clamp, the membrane potential $V$ is held constant between events, so the rates $k_{CO}(V)$ and $k_{OC}(V)$ are constant over any inter-event interval. Independence of channels implies that, at time $t$, there are $n_C(t)$ independent exponential clocks each with rate $k_{CO}(V)$ for potential openings, and $n_O(t)$ independent exponential clocks each with rate $k_{OC}(V)$ for potential closings.\n\nFor the waiting time distribution, we use the survival probability approach. Let $\\tau$ denote the waiting time to the next event. The probability that no $C \\to O$ transition occurs in the interval $[t, t+\\tau)$ is, by independence and exponential survival, $\\exp\\!\\big(-n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V)\\,\\tau\\big)$. Similarly, the probability that no $O \\to C$ transition occurs in $[t, t+\\tau)$ is $\\exp\\!\\big(-n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)\\,\\tau\\big)$. The probability that no event of either type occurs is the product\n$$\nP(\\text{no event in }[t,t+\\tau)) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\big(-n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V)\\,\\tau\\big)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)\\,\\tau\\big)\n\\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\big(-a_0\\,\\tau\\big),\n$$\nwhere\n$$\na_0 \\;=\\; n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V) \\;+\\; n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V).\n$$\nThus, the waiting time $\\tau$ has an exponential distribution with rate $a_0$. The corresponding density is\n$$\nf(\\tau) \\;=\\; a_0\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-a_0\\,\\tau\\big), \\quad \\tau \\ge 0.\n$$\nNext, we derive the event-selection probabilities. The probability that the minimum among all $n_C(t)+n_O(t)$ independent exponential clocks comes from the set of $C \\to O$ clocks equals the total rate contributed by that set divided by the overall rate $a_0$, a standard property of competing exponentials. More formally, for independent exponential clocks with rates $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^m$, the probability that the earliest event is due to clock $j$ is $\\lambda_j / \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i$. Grouping by reaction class, the probability the next event is an opening is\n$$\nP(\\text{next is }C\\to O) \\;=\\; \\frac{n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V)}{a_0},\n$$\nand the probability the next event is a closing is\n$$\nP(\\text{next is }O\\to C) \\;=\\; \\frac{n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)}{a_0}.\n$$\nConditional on the event type, the identity of the specific channel is uniformly distributed among the channels in the corresponding state class, because all channels within a class have identical rates under voltage clamp.\n\nThese results lead directly to the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) for this system under voltage clamp:\n- Compute the propensities for each reaction class: $a_{CO} = n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V)$ and $a_{OC} = n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)$, and their sum $a_0 = a_{CO} + a_{OC}$.\n- Draw the waiting time $\\tau$ from the exponential distribution with rate $a_0$, for example $\\tau = -\\frac{1}{a_0}\\ln(u_1)$ with $u_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$.\n- Draw the event type using $u_2 \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$: if $u_2  a_{CO}/a_0$, select a $C \\to O$ opening; otherwise select an $O \\to C$ closing.\n- Choose a specific channel uniformly at random from the corresponding state class, update its state, and update counts $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$ and the time $t \\leftarrow t + \\tau$.\n- Under voltage clamp, $V$ remains constant; repeat the steps.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: This matches the derivation exactly under the stated voltage-clamp assumption. It correctly gives $\\tau \\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(a_0)$ with $a_0 = n_C(t)\\,k_{CO}(V) + n_O(t)\\,k_{OC}(V)$, the correct event-selection probabilities, and the standard SSA steps. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option B: This asserts a gamma (Erlang) waiting time with shape $N$, which is a common misconception. The time to the first event among $N$ independent exponential clocks is exponential with the summed rate, not gamma with shape $N$. It also incorrectly assigns equal probability to opening versus closing, ignoring $n_C(t)$, $n_O(t)$, and the rates. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option C: This uses $\\max\\{k_{CO}(V), k_{OC}(V)\\}$ as the rate, which ignores the number of channels and the additive nature of independent hazards. The next event can come from either class, and the total hazard is the sum, not the maximum. It also incorrectly ties the event type to the larger rate deterministically and the identity to the “fastest” channel, which is not how competing exponentials work. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option D: This describes an inhomogeneous Poisson process with time-dependent hazard $a_0(V(t+\\tau))$ and selection based on $V(t+\\tau)$. Under voltage clamp, $V$ is constant between events, so the rates are constant and the hazard is not time-dependent. While such a form can be relevant when $V$ evolves continuously between events, it contradicts the stated voltage-clamp assumption in the problem. Verdict: Incorrect in the present setting.\n- Option E: This gets the exponential waiting time with rate $a_0$ correct but then assigns event-selection probabilities that ignore the channel counts $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$, using only the single-channel rates. The correct probabilities must include the multiplicity factors $n_C(t)$ and $n_O(t)$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct and complete description under the problem’s assumptions.",

Under stationary conditions at fixed voltage and temperature, assume that each open period ends with an $O \\to C$ transition that is conditionally memoryless given the start of the open period.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two derivations related to the parameter estimation of an exponential process: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the rate parameter and the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the variance of any unbiased estimator of this parameter.\n\nFirst, we establish the probability density function (PDF) for a single open dwell time, $\\tau$. The problem states that the transition from the open state $O$ to the closed state $C$ occurs with a constant rate $k_{OC}$. This implies that the duration an ion channel spends in the open state before transitioning to the closed state is a random variable following an exponential distribution. The PDF for $\\tau$, parameterized by the rate $k_{OC}$, is:\n$$p(\\tau | k_{OC}) = k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} \\tau), \\quad \\text{for } \\tau \\ge 0$$\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator ($\\hat{k}_{OC}$)\n\nWe are given a sample of $N$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) open dwell times, $\\{\\tau_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$. The likelihood function, $L(k_{OC})$, is the joint probability of observing this particular sample. Due to the independence of the observations, the likelihood is the product of the individual PDFs:\n$$L(k_{OC} | \\{\\tau_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{N} p(\\tau_k | k_{OC}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{N} \\left( k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} \\tau_k) \\right)$$\n$$L(k_{OC}) = k_{OC}^{N} \\exp\\left(-k_{OC} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k\\right)$$\n\nTo find the value of $k_{OC}$ that maximizes this function, it is standard practice to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, known as the log-likelihood, $\\mathcal{L}(k_{OC})$. This simplifies the mathematics by converting the product into a sum.\n$$\\mathcal{L}(k_{OC}) = \\ln(L(k_{OC})) = \\ln\\left(k_{OC}^{N} \\exp\\left(-k_{OC} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\mathcal{L}(k_{OC}) = \\ln(k_{OC}^{N}) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-k_{OC} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\mathcal{L}(k_{OC}) = N \\ln(k_{OC}) - k_{OC} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k$$\n\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $k_{OC}$ and set it to zero. The resulting value, $\\hat{k}_{OC}$, will be the maximum likelihood estimate.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(k_{OC})}{\\partial k_{OC}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{OC}} \\left( N \\ln(k_{OC}) - k_{OC} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k \\right) = \\frac{N}{k_{OC}} - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{N}{\\hat{k}_{OC}} - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k = 0$$\nSolving for $\\hat{k}_{OC}$:\n$$\\frac{N}{\\hat{k}_{OC}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k$$\n$$\\hat{k}_{OC} = \\frac{N}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k}$$\nThis is the maximum likelihood estimator for the rate parameter $k_{OC}$. It is the reciprocal of the sample mean of the observed dwell times.\n\nTo verify that this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}(k_{OC})}{\\partial k_{OC}^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{OC}} \\left( \\frac{N}{k_{OC}} - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_k \\right) = -\\frac{N}{k_{OC}^2}$$\nSince $N > 0$ and $k_{OC}^2 > 0$, the second derivative is always negative, confirming that the log-likelihood function is concave and our solution is indeed a maximum.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)\n\nThe CRLB sets a lower limit on the variance of any unbiased estimator. It is defined as the reciprocal of the Fisher information, $I(k_{OC})$.
