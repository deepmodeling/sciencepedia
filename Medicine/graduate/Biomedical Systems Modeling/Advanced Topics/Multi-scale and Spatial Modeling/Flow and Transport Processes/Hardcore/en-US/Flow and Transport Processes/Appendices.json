            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless transport equation for a therapeutic molecule in a microvessel and the subsequent identification and interpretation of the governing dimensionless groups.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimensional governing equation starting from the principle of conservation of mass for the solute concentration, $c(x,t)$, within a one-dimensional differential control volume of length $\\Delta x$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The conservation statement is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = (\\text{Flux In}) - (\\text{Flux Out}) + (\\text{Rate of Generation})\n$$\nThe rate of accumulation of the solute within the volume $A\\Delta x$ is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (A \\Delta x c) = A \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe total flux, $J_{\\text{total}}$, has two components: an advective flux, $J_{\\text{adv}} = U c$, due to the bulk flow, and a diffusive flux, $J_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, described by Fick's first law. The net rate of transport into the control volume is the flux in at position $x$ minus the flux out at $x+\\Delta x$:\n$$\nA J_{\\text{total}}(x,t) - A J_{\\text{total}}(x+\\Delta x,t) = A \\left[ \\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x} - \\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x+\\Delta x} \\right]\n$$\nThe rate of generation within the volume is due to a first-order volumetric clearance reaction, which represents a negative generation (consumption). The rate is given by $(-k c)$, so for the volume $A\\Delta x$, the total rate is $-k c (A \\Delta x)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass balance is:\n$$\nA \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = A \\left[ \\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x} - \\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x+\\Delta x} \\right] - k c A \\Delta x\n$$\nDividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$ and rearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x+\\Delta x} - \\left(Uc - D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\\bigg|_{x}}{ \\Delta x } - k c\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the fraction becomes the definition of the spatial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( Uc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) - k c\n$$\nSince the flow speed $U$ and diffusivity $D$ are constants, this expands to the one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation using the provided mappings: $x = L\\xi$, $t = T\\tau$, and $c = C_{\\mathrm{in}}\\tilde{c}$.

Multiplying the entire equation by the inverse of this scale, $L^2/D$, gives:\n$$\n\\frac{L^2}{TD} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi^2} - \\frac{UL}{D} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi} - \\frac{kL^2}{D} \\tilde{c}\n$$\nWe are instructed to choose the timescale $T$ such that the coefficient of the dimensionless time derivative becomes unity. Thus, we set:\n$$\n\\frac{L^2}{TD} = 1 \\implies T = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis choice of $T$ represents the characteristic timescale for diffusion over the length $L$ of the vessel. With this timescale, the dimensionless governing equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi^2} - \\left(\\frac{UL}{D}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi} - \\left(\\frac{kL^2}{D}\\right) \\tilde{c}\n$$\nThis equation reveals two dimensionless groups.\n\nThe Peclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, is the coefficient of the advection term:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nPhysically, $\\mathrm{Pe}$ is the ratio of the timescale of diffusive transport, $t_{\\text{diff}} = L^2/D$, to the timescale of advective transport, $t_{\\text{adv}} = L/U$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{L^2/D}{L/U} = \\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{adv}}}\n$$\nIt quantifies the relative dominance of advection over diffusion.

If $\\mathrm{Pe} \\ll 1$, transport is diffusion-dominated.\n\nThe reaction–diffusion number, $\\hat{k}$, is the coefficient of the reaction term under diffusive scaling:\n$$\n\\hat{k} = \\frac{kL^2}{D}\n$$\nPhysically, $\\hat{k}$ is the ratio of the timescale of diffusive transport, $t_{\\text{diff}} = L^2/D$, to the timescale of reaction, $t_{\\text{reac}} = 1/k$.\n$$\n\\hat{k} = \\frac{L^2/D}{1/k} = \\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{reac}}}\n$$\nIt quantifies how fast the reaction occurs relative to the time it takes for the solute to diffuse across the system. This group is also known as the square of the Thiele modulus.\n\nTo identify the Damköhler number, $\\mathrm{Da}$, we consider advective scaling. We return to the unscaled dimensionless equation and normalize by the advective transport scale, $U/L$. This means choosing the characteristic time as the advective timescale, $T = t_{\\text{adv}} = L/U$. The dimensionless equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tau'} = \\left(\\frac{D}{LU}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi^2} - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\xi} - \\left(\\frac{kL}{U}\\right) \\tilde{c}\n$$\nHere, $\\tau' = t/(L/U)$ is the advectively scaled time. The coefficient of the reaction term is the Damköhler number, $\\mathrm{Da}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{U}\n$$\nPhysically, $\\mathrm{Da}$ is the ratio of the timescale of advective transport, $t_{\\text{adv}} = L/U$, to the timescale of reaction, $t_{\\text{reac}} = 1/k$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{L/U}{1/k} = \\frac{t_{\\text{adv}}}{t_{\\text{reac}}}\n$$\nIt quantifies how fast the reaction occurs relative to the fluid's residence time in the vessel.\n\nFinally, we are asked to express $\\hat{k}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Pe}$ and $\\mathrm{Da}$. We have the definitions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{U}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{k} = \\frac{kL^2}{D}\n$$\nBy multiplying $\\mathrm{Pe}$ and $\\mathrm{Da}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} \\cdot \\mathrm{Da} = \\left(\\frac{UL}{D}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{kL}{U}\\right) = \\frac{U L k L}{D U} = \\frac{kL^2}{D}\n$$\nThe result is precisely the definition of $\\hat{k}$. Therefore, the relationship is:\n$$\n\\hat{k} = \\mathrm{Pe} \\cdot \\mathrm{Da}\n$$\nThis relationship is physically consistent with the timescale interpretations:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{reac}}} = \\left(\\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{adv}}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{t_{\\text{adv}}}{t_{\\text{reac}}}\\right)\n$$",

Nitric oxide (NO) diffuses within this layer with a constant molecular diffusion coefficient $D$ and is consumed by first-order kinetics with rate constant $k$.

Validation:**\nThe problem constitutes a standard, one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction problem, a canonical model in transport phenomena and biomedical engineering. The governing physics are based on conservation of mass and Fick's law, and the first-order reaction kinetics is a common and valid approximation for solute consumption in biological tissues. The boundary conditions consist of a prescribed concentration at one end and an integral constraint over the domain. For a second-order ordinary differential equation, these two conditions are sufficient to determine a unique solution. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution follows.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nThe conservation of mass for a species with concentration $C$ in a one-dimensional system is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} + R $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux and $R$ is the net rate of volumetric production.\nThe problem states the system is at steady state, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$.\nTransport is by diffusion only (no convection), so the flux is given by Fick's first law. Since diffusion is isotropic, $D$ is a scalar constant:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nThere is no volumetric production, and consumption follows first-order kinetics. Thus, the net production rate is $R = -kC$.\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation yields the steady-state diffusion-reaction equation:\n$$ 0 = - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\right) - kC $$\nAs $D$ is constant, this simplifies to a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - kC = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0 $$\n\n**Solution of the ODE**\nTo solve this ODE, we define a characteristic length scale, $\\lambda^{-1}$, where $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 C = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation can be expressed using hyperbolic functions:\n$$ C(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined from the boundary and integral conditions.\n\nAn equivalent and often more convenient form of the general solution, especially when a boundary condition is at a non-zero position, is:\n$$ C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) + C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nWe apply the boundary condition at $x=L$, which is $C(L)=0$:\n$$ C(L) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-L)) + C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-L)) = C_1 \\sinh(0) + C_2 \\cosh(0) = C_1(0) + C_2(1) = C_2 $$\nSince $C(L)=0$, we must have $C_2=0$. The solution form thus simplifies to:\n$$ C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nThis form elegantly incorporates the boundary condition at $x=L$. The remaining constant, $C_1$, must be determined using the integral constraint.\n\n**Application of the Integral Constraint**\nThe problem requires that the average concentration across the slab thickness $L$ equals a target concentration $C^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C(x) \\,dx = C^{\\star} $$\nSubstituting the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\,dx = C^{\\star} $$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\,dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda(L-L)) - \\cosh(\\lambda(L-0)) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(0) - \\cosh(\\lambda L) \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( 1 - \\cosh(\\lambda L) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1 \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the constraint equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1}{\\lambda} \\right) = C^{\\star} $$\nSolving for the constant $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} $$\nWith $C_1$ determined, the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ is fully specified.\n\n**Calculation of the Transwall Gradient**\nThe final step is to compute the quantity $-\\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0}$. First, we differentiate the concentration profile $C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x))$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\right] = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\cdot (-\\lambda) = -C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nThe quantity of interest is the negative of this gradient:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx} = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nWe evaluate this expression at the endothelial interface, $x=0$:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-0)) = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) $$\nNow, we substitute the previously found expression for $C_1$:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\left( \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} \\right) \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda^2 \\cosh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} $$\nFinally, we substitute back the definition $\\lambda^2 = k/D$ to express the result in terms of the original problem parameters:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\left(\\frac{k}{D}\\right) \\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) - 1} $$\nThis expression represents the required magnitude of the concentration gradient at the endothelial wall to maintain the desired average NO concentration $C^{\\star}$ within the tissue slab. The units of this quantity are concentration per length (e.g., $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot m^{-4}}$ if $C$ is in $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot m^{-3}}$ and $x$ is in $\\mathrm{m}$), which is dimensionally consistent.",

This leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1. Temporal ODE: $T'(t) + (k + \\lambda_s) T(t) = 0$\n2. Spatial ODE: $D X''(x) + \\lambda_s X(x) = 0$, or $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda_s}{D}X(x) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions on $C(x,t)$ translate to conditions on $X(x)$:\n$$\nX'(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X'(L) = 0\n$$\nLet's define the spatial eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\lambda_s/D$. The spatial problem is a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nX''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad X'(0)=0, \\, X'(L)=0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying $X'(0)=0$: $X'(x) = -A\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. At $x=0$, this gives $B\\sqrt{\\lambda}=0$. For non-trivial solutions ($\\lambda \\ne 0$), we must have $B=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying $X'(L)=0$: $-A\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$. For non-trivial solutions ($A \\ne 0$), we require $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$.\nThis condition is satisfied if $\\sqrt{\\lambda}L = n\\pi$ for integer $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions (the Neumann eigenmodes) are $X_n(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nThe separation constants are $\\lambda_{s,n} = D\\lambda_n = D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\nThe solution to the temporal ODE for each mode $n$ is $T_n(t) \\propto \\exp(-(k+\\lambda_{s,n})t)$.\nThe total decay rate for the $n$-th mode is thus:\n$$\n\\beta_n = k + \\lambda_{s,n} = k + D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem states that the experimentally measured decay rates for the $n=1$ and $n=2$ modes are $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$. We can set up a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $D$ and $k$:\n$$\n\\beta_1 = k + D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_2 = k + D\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = k + D\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo find $D$, we subtract equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$\n\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 = \\left(k + D\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right) - \\left(k + D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 = D\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right) = D\\frac{3\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\nSolving for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nTo find $k$, we can substitute this expression for $D$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$\nk = \\beta_1 - D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} = \\beta_1 - \\left(\\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2}\\right)\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\beta_1 - \\frac{\\beta_2 - \\beta_1}{3} = \\frac{3\\beta_1 - (\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3} = \\frac{3\\beta_1 - \\beta_2 + \\beta_1}{3}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{4\\beta_1 - \\beta_2}{3}\n$$\nThe final closed-form expressions for the parameters are:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = \\frac{4\\beta_1 - \\beta_2}{3}\n$$\nThe results are expressed as a single row matrix as requested.",
