This analysis informs the choice of coupling strategy, determining whether processes must be simulated simultaneously (concurrent coupling) or can be treated sequentially. This practice guides you through the fundamental derivation of characteristic times for diffusion at the cellular scale and perfusion at the organ scale, culminating in a quantitative decision about the appropriate modeling approach .",

            "problem": "Consider a two-scale biomedical transport model that couples intracellular diffusion of a signaling macromolecule within a typical parenchymal cell to organ-level blood perfusion through a well-mixed vascular compartment. At the cellular scale, transport is governed by Fickian diffusion over a characteristic intracellular length $L$. At the organ scale, blood delivers and removes the macromolecule through a single well-mixed compartment with volume $V$ and volumetric flow rate $Q$. Starting only from the following fundamental bases:\n- Fickian diffusion with mean-square displacement scaling and Fick’s second law, which implies that the time required for diffusion to traverse a characteristic length scale grows with the square of the length and inversely with the diffusion coefficient $D$.\n- Conservation of mass in a well-mixed compartment, which implies that the characteristic residence time is inversely proportional to the turnover rate and proportional to the volume.\n\nDerive appropriate characteristic times at each scale and then compute the ratio of the cellular diffusion timescale to the organ-level perfusion timescale.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires the derivation of two characteristic timescales, one for intracellular diffusion and one for organ-level perfusion, followed by the calculation of their ratio.\n\n**1. Characteristic Diffusion Time ($t_d$)**\n\nThe problem states that the characteristic time for diffusion, $t_d$, scales with the square of the characteristic length, $L$, and inversely with the diffusion coefficient, $D$. This relationship arises from a dimensional analysis of Fick's second law of diffusion, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 C$, where $C$ is concentration and $t$ is time. Comparing the dimensions of the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{[T]} \\sim [D] \\frac{[C]}{[L]^2}\n$$\nwhere $[T]$ and $[L]$ are characteristic time and length scales. Solving for the characteristic time yields:\n$$\n[T] \\sim \\frac{[L]^2}{[D]}\n$$\nThus, the characteristic diffusion time $t_d$ is defined as:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\n\n**2. Characteristic Perfusion Time ($t_p$)**\n\nThe problem describes the organ as a well-mixed compartment of volume $V$ with a volumetric flow rate $Q$. The mass balance for a species in such a compartment is given by:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = Q(C_{in} - C_{out})\n$$\nwhere $C_{in}$ is the inlet concentration and $C_{out}$ is the outlet concentration. For a well-mixed compartment, the outlet concentration is equal to the concentration within the compartment, $C_{out} = C$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = -Q C + Q C_{in}\n$$\nRearranging this first-order linear ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\left(\\frac{Q}{V}\\right) C = \\frac{Q}{V} C_{in}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{Q}{V}$ has dimensions of inverse time ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and represents the rate of turnover of the compartment's contents. The characteristic time of this first-order process, known as the residence time or perfusion time $t_p$, is the reciprocal of this rate constant.\n$$\nt_p = \\frac{V}{Q}\n$$\nThis is consistent with the problem's qualitative description that the residence time is proportional to the volume and inversely proportional to the turnover rate (represented by $Q$).\n\n**3. Non-dimensional Ratio ($R$)**\n\nThe non-dimensional ratio $R$ is defined as the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic perfusion time:\n$$\nR = \\frac{t_d}{t_p} = \\frac{L^2/D}{V/Q}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L^2 Q}{D V}\n$$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nSubstituting the given values into the expression for $R$:\n- $L = 25 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $D = 1.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $V = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}$\n- $Q = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{(25 \\times 10^{-6})^2 (1.8 \\times 10^{-5})}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-11}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-4})}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{(625 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.8 \\times 10^{-5})}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-11}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-4})}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{625 \\times 1.8}{1.5 \\times 1.2} \\times \\frac{10^{-12} \\times 10^{-5}}{10^{-11} \\times 10^{-4}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{1125}{1.8} \\times \\frac{10^{-17}}{10^{-15}}\n$$\n$$\nR = 625 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\n$$\nR = 6.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to three significant figures. The calculated value $R = 6.25$ is exact and already has three significant figures.\n\n**5. Qualitative Assessment**\n\nThe problem provides criteria for assessing the need for concurrent coupling: if $R$ is between $0.1$ and $10$, the timescales are considered comparable, and concurrent coupling is advisable. Our calculated value is $R=6.25$. Since $0.1 \\le 6.25 \\le 10$, the cellular diffusion timescale ($t_d \\approx 41.7\\ \\mathrm{s}$) and the organ perfusion timescale ($t_p \\approx 6.67\\ \\mathrm{s}$) are of the same order of magnitude. This indicates that processes at the two scales evolve on similar temporal tracks, necessitating a concurrent (or \"fully-coupled\") multi-scale modeling approach where the models at both scales are solved simultaneously. A non-concurrent approach, where one scale is assumed to be at a quasi-steady state relative to the other, would be inappropriate.",

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum side length $L_{\\min}$ of a cubic Representative Elementary Volume (REV) such that the coefficient of variation of the volume-averaged elastic modulus $\\overline{E}_{V}$ is below a certain tolerance $\\varepsilon_c$.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the variance of the volume-averaged modulus, $\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}]$. The volume-averaged modulus is defined as:\n$$ \\overline{E}_{V} = \\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} $$\nThe expectation of $\\overline{E}_{V}$ is found by linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$ E[\\overline{E}_{V}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\right] = \\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} E[E(\\mathbf{x})] \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} $$\nSince the random field $E(\\mathbf{x})$ is stationary, its mean $E[E(\\mathbf{x})] = \\mu_{E}$ is constant for all $\\mathbf{x}$.\n$$ E[\\overline{E}_{V}] = \\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} \\mu_{E} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{V}\\mu_{E}V = \\mu_{E} $$\nThe variance of $\\overline{E}_{V}$ is given by $\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}] = E[\\overline{E}_{V}^2] - (E[\\overline{E}_{V}])^2$. We first compute $E[\\overline{E}_{V}^2]$:\n$$ \\overline{E}_{V}^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{V}\\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{y}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} \\right) = \\frac{1}{V^2} \\int_{V}\\int_{V} E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} $$\nTaking the expectation:\n$$ E[\\overline{E}_{V}^2] = \\frac{1}{V^2} \\int_{V}\\int_{V} E[E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y})] \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} $$\nThe term $E[E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y})]$ is related to the autocovariance function, $\\mathrm{Cov}(E(\\mathbf{x}), E(\\mathbf{y})) = E[E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y})] - E[E(\\mathbf{x})]E[E(\\mathbf{y})]$. For a stationary field, this is $E[E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y})] - \\mu_{E}^2$. The problem defines the autocorrelation function $C(r)$, where $r=|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|$. Given $C(0) = \\sigma_E^2$, it is evident that $C(r)$ represents the autocovariance function, i.e., $C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) = \\mathrm{Cov}(E(\\mathbf{x}), E(\\mathbf{y}))$.\nThus, $E[E(\\mathbf{x})E(\\mathbf{y})] = C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) + \\mu_{E}^2$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$ E[\\overline{E}_{V}^2] = \\frac{1}{V^2} \\int_{V}\\int_{V} \\left( C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) + \\mu_{E}^2 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} = \\frac{1}{V^2} \\int_{V}\\int_{V} C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} + \\frac{\\mu_{E}^2}{V^2}\\int_{V}\\int_{V} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} $$\nThe second term evaluates to $\\frac{\\mu_{E}^2}{V^2}V^2 = \\mu_{E}^2$. Therefore, the variance is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}] = E[\\overline{E}_{V}^2] - \\mu_{E}^2 = \\frac{1}{V^2} \\int_{V}\\int_{V} C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} $$\nThis expression shows the scaling of the variance with the volume and the autocorrelation. To proceed, we use the approximation valid for a large volume $V$ compared to the scale of correlation, i.e., $L \\gg \\ell_c$. In this limit, the six-dimensional integral can be approximated as:\n$$ \\int_{V}\\int_{V} C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y} \\approx V \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} C(|\\mathbf{r}|) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}$. This approximation neglects boundary effects, assuming that for most points $\\mathbf{x}$ in $V$, the integral of $C(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|)$ over $\\mathbf{y} \\in V$ is nearly identical to the integral over all space.\nThe variance then simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}] \\approx \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} C(r) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} $$\nThis demonstrates that the variance of the averaged property scales inversely with the averaging volume $V$. Next, we evaluate the integral of the given autocorrelation function $C(r) = \\sigma_{E}^{2}\\exp(-r/\\ell_{c})$ over all space. Using spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the volume element is $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} = r^2\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$.\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\sigma_{E}^{2}\\exp(-r/\\ell_{c}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} = \\sigma_{E}^{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\exp(-r/\\ell_{c}) r^2\\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi $$\nThe angular integration yields a factor of $4\\pi$.\n$$ = 4\\pi\\sigma_{E}^{2} \\int_0^{\\infty} r^2\\exp(-r/\\ell_{c}) \\,\\mathrm{d}r $$\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing it as related to the Gamma function. Let $u = r/\\ell_c$, so $r = u\\ell_c$ and $\\mathrm{d}r = \\ell_c \\mathrm{d}u$.\n$$ \\int_0^{\\infty} r^2\\exp(-r/\\ell_{c}) \\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\int_0^{\\infty} (u\\ell_c)^2 \\exp(-u) (\\ell_c \\mathrm{d}u) = \\ell_c^3 \\int_0^{\\infty} u^2\\exp(-u) \\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\ell_c^3 \\Gamma(3) = 2\\ell_c^3 $$\nSo, the full integral is $4\\pi\\sigma_{E}^{2}(2\\ell_c^3) = 8\\pi\\sigma_{E}^{2}\\ell_c^3$.\nThe approximate variance is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}] \\approx \\frac{8\\pi\\sigma_{E}^{2}\\ell_c^3}{V} $$\nNow, we apply the continuum admissibility criterion:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}]}}{\\mu_{E}} \\leq \\varepsilon_{c} \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}]}{\\mu_{E}^2} \\leq \\varepsilon_{c}^2 $$\nSubstituting our expression for the variance and using $V = L^3$ for a cubic REV:\n$$ \\frac{8\\pi\\sigma_{E}^{2}\\ell_c^3}{L^3\\mu_{E}^2} \\leq \\varepsilon_{c}^2 $$\nTo find the minimum side length $L_{\\min}$, we solve for $L$ at the equality:\n$$ L_{\\min}^3 = \\frac{8\\pi\\ell_c^3}{\\varepsilon_{c}^2} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{E}}{\\mu_{E}}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ L_{\\min} = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{\\varepsilon_{c}^2} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{E}}{\\mu_{E}}\\right)^2 \\right)^{1/3} \\ell_c $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\mu_{E} = 1.2$ GPa, $\\sigma_{E} = 0.4$ GPa, $\\ell_{c} = 0.25$ mm, $\\varepsilon_{c} = 0.05$.\nThe ratio of standard deviation to mean is $\\frac{\\sigma_{E}}{\\mu_{E}} = \\frac{0.4}{1.2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$$ L_{\\min} = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{(0.05)^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\right)^{1/3} (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) $$\n$$ L_{\\min} = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{0.0025 \\times 9} \\right)^{1/3} (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{0.0225} \\right)^{1/3} (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) $$\n$$ L_{\\min} \\approx \\left( \\frac{25.1327}{0.0225} \\right)^{1/3} (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) \\approx (1117.009)^{1/3} (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) $$\n$$ L_{\\min} \\approx (10.3758) \\times (0.25 \\, \\text{mm}) \\approx 2.59395 \\, \\text{mm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $L_{\\min} = 2.594$ mm.\n\n**Justification of the Continuum Assumption**\nThe continuum assumption in homogenization theory is valid when there is a clear separation of scales between the microstructural length scale and the macrostructural (or continuum) length scale. In this problem, the microstructural length scale is characterized by the correlation length $\\ell_c$, while the continuum length scale is the size of the REV, $L$.\nThe ratio of these scales for the minimum acceptable REV size is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\min}}{\\ell_c} = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{\\varepsilon_c^2} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_E}{\\mu_E}\\right)^2 \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 10.38 $$\nThis result, $L_{\\min} \\approx 10.4 \\, \\ell_c$, signifies that the REV must be at least an order of magnitude larger than the characteristic size of the material heterogeneities. This scale separation is the fundamental reason why the continuum assumption becomes reasonable.\nBy averaging the stochastic microscale modulus $E(\\mathbf{x})$ over a volume $V = L^3$ that is significantly larger than the \"correlation volume\" (on the order of $\\ell_c^3$), the random fluctuations are effectively smoothed out. The derived relationship $\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}] \\propto 1/V$ shows quantitatively how this smoothing process suppresses sampling variability. The admissibility criterion $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[\\overline{E}_{V}]}}{\\mu_{E}} \\leq \\varepsilon_{c}$ provides a quantitative threshold for this suppression. By ensuring the coefficient of variation of the effective modulus is below a small tolerance (here, $5\\%$), we guarantee that any two REVs of size $L \\ge L_{\\min}$ sampled from the material will have nearly the same effective modulus. This statistical stability allows the highly variable microscale field to be replaced by a single, deterministic effective parameter at the macroscale, legitimizing the cross-scale coupling and the use of a deterministic continuum model.",

Use the following parameterization:\n- $v_{r}>0$ is the effective release conductance (units: $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$).\n- $x_{\\mathrm{ER}}>0$ is the endoplasmic reticulum calcium concentration (units: $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), treated as constant over the time window of interest.\n- $J_{0}>0$ is a constant net leak/influx into the cytosol (units: $\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$).\n- $\\lambda>0$ is the effective pump removal rate constant (units: $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$).\n- $k_{0}>0$ is the opening rate coefficient (units: $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$).\n- $\\kappa>0$ is the closing rate constant (units: $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$).\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from conservation of flow and mass-action channel gating, write explicit expressions for $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$, yielding a model in the form $dx/dt=f(x,y)$ and $\\epsilon\\,dy/dt=g(x,y)$ with the parameters above. Do not introduce any unlisted parameters.\n2. Identify the dimensionless time-scale separation parameter $\\epsilon$ in terms of characteristic time scales derived from the given rates. Express $\\epsilon$ using the pump removal timescale and the aggregate gating timescale evaluated at a reference cytosolic calcium level $x_{\\mathrm{ref}}>0$ (units: $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$).\n3. Determine the limiting behavior of the fast gating variable as $\\epsilon\\to 0$ and give the explicit closed-form expression for the quasi-steady open fraction $y^{\\ast}(x)$ as a function of $x$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $y^{\\ast}(x)$. No rounding is required. Since $y^{\\ast}(x)$ is dimensionless, no units are required in the final answer.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Task 1: Determination of $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$**\n\nFirst, we construct the differential equation for the cytosolic calcium concentration, $x(t)$. According to the principle of conservation of flow, the rate of change $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the sum of all fluxes into and out of the cytosol.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\text{Flux}_{\\text{release}} + \\text{Flux}_{\\text{leak/influx}} - \\text{Flux}_{\\text{pump}}\n$$\n- The ER release flux, $\\text{Flux}_{\\text{release}}$, is proportional to the fraction of open channels, $y$, and the concentration difference, $(x_{\\mathrm{ER}} - x)$. The proportionality constant is the release conductance, $v_r$. Thus, $\\text{Flux}_{\\text{release}} = v_r y (x_{\\mathrm{ER}} - x)$.\n- The net leak/influx flux, $\\text{Flux}_{\\text{leak/influx}}$, is given as a constant, $J_0$.\n- The pump removal flux, $\\text{Flux}_{\\text{pump}}$, is proportional to the cytosolic concentration, $x$, with the rate constant $\\lambda$. Thus, $\\text{Flux}_{\\text{pump}} = \\lambda x$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the equation for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_r y (x_{\\mathrm{ER}} - x) + J_0 - \\lambda x\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the function $f(x,y)$:\n$$\nf(x,y) = v_r y (x_{\\mathrm{ER}} - x) + J_0 - \\lambda x\n$$\nNext, we construct the differential equation for the fraction of open channels, $y(t)$. The dynamics are modeled by the transition between a closed state (fraction $1-y$) and an open state (fraction $y$). According to the mass-action-like kinetics principle:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = (\\text{opening rate}) \\cdot (1-y) - (\\text{closing rate}) \\cdot y\n$$\n- The opening rate is given as being linear in $x$, with coefficient $k_0$. So, the opening rate is $k_0 x$.\n- The closing rate is given as a constant, $\\kappa$.\n\nSubstituting these rates into the balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y\n$$\nThis is the governing equation for the fast variable $y$. The problem requires the system to be expressed in the form $\\epsilon \\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x,y)$. To do this, we must first identify $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Task 2: Identification of the time-scale separation parameter $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe parameter $\\epsilon$ represents the ratio of the characteristic timescale of the fast process (channel gating) to that of the slow process (calcium concentration change).\n- The slow timescale, $T_{\\text{slow}}$, is determined from the dynamics of $x$. The problem specifies using the pump removal timescale. The pump term is $-\\lambda x$, which corresponds to a characteristic time of $T_{\\text{slow}} = 1/\\lambda$.\n- The fast timescale, $T_{\\text{fast}}$, is the relaxation time for the gating variable $y$. We can rewrite the equation for $y$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_0 x - (k_0 x + \\kappa)y\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation in $y$. The term multiplying $y$, which is $-(k_0 x + \\kappa)$, defines the relaxation rate. The relaxation timescale is the reciprocal of this rate's magnitude: $\\tau_y(x) = \\frac{1}{k_0 x + \\kappa}$. The problem asks to evaluate this at a reference calcium level $x_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Thus, the characteristic fast timescale is $T_{\\text{fast}} = \\frac{1}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa}$.\n\nThe dimensionless time-scale separation parameter $\\epsilon$ is the ratio:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{T_{\\text{fast}}}{T_{\\text{slow}}} = \\frac{1 / (k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa)}{1 / \\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa}\n$$\nNow we can finalize the expression for $g(x,y)$. We start with the equation for $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ and multiply by $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\epsilon \\left( k_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\lambda}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa} \\left( k_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y \\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the function $g(x,y)$ is:\n$$\ng(x,y) = \\frac{\\lambda}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa} \\left( k_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y \\right)\n$$\nThis completes the formulation of the system in the required form.\n\n**Task 3: Determination of the quasi-steady state open fraction $y^*(x)$**\n\nThe quasi-steady state (QSS) approximation for the fast variable $y$ is obtained by taking the singular limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$. In the equation $\\epsilon \\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x,y)$, this limit implies that $g(x,y) = 0$, assuming $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ remains bounded.\n$$\ng(x,y) = \\frac{\\lambda}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa} \\left( k_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the parameters $\\lambda$, $k_0$, $\\kappa$, and $x_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are all positive, the pre-factor $\\frac{\\lambda}{k_0 x_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\kappa}$ is a non-zero constant. Thus, the term in the parentheses must be zero:\n$$\nk_0 x (1-y) - \\kappa y = 0\n$$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $y$ to find the quasi-steady state fraction, which we denote as $y^*(x)$.\n$$\nk_0 x - k_0 x y^*(x) - \\kappa y^*(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_0 x = y^*(x) (k_0 x + \\kappa)\n$$\n$$\ny^*(x) = \\frac{k_0 x}{k_0 x + \\kappa}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the quasi-steady open fraction as a function of the cytosolic calcium concentration $x$. It describes a monotonic, saturating relationship, where the fraction of open channels increases with calcium concentration, approaching $1$ for large $x$.",
