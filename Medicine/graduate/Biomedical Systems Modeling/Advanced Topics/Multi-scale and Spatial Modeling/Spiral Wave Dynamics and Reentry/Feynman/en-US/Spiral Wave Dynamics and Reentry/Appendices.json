A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\nThe problem requires finding the minimal path length $L_{\\min}$ for sustained reentry on a one-dimensional ring of cardiac tissue. The analysis is based on the self-consistency of a circulating wavefront.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationships. The cycle length ($CL$) of the reentry is the sum of the Action Potential Duration ($APD$) and the Diastolic Interval ($DI$):\n$$ CL = APD + DI $$\nFor a single, stable wave to circulate on a ring of length $L$, the time taken to travel the circumference must equal the cycle length. The travel time is given by the length divided by the conduction velocity ($CV$). Therefore, the self-consistency condition is:\n$$ CL = \\frac{L}{CV} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $CL$ gives the relationship between the path length $L$ and the state of the tissue, which is characterized by the diastolic interval $DI$:\n$$ \\frac{L}{CV} = APD + DI $$\nThe $APD$ and $CV$ themselves depend on the preceding $DI$. This relationship is described by the given restitution functions. We can express the path length $L$ as a function of $DI$:\n$$ L(DI) = CV(DI) \\times (APD(DI) + DI) $$\nTo find the minimal path length $L_{\\min}$ that allows for sustained reentry, we must find the minimum value of the function $L(DI)$ for the permissible range of $DI$, which is $DI \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's substitute the given restitution functions into the expression for $L(DI)$:\n$$ L(DI) = \\left[ CV_{\\min} + \\Delta CV \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{C}}\\right)\\right) \\right] \\times \\left[ APD_{\\min} + \\Delta APD \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{A}}\\right)\\right) + DI \\right] $$\nTo find the minimum of $L(DI)$ for $DI \\geq 0$, we analyze its derivative with respect to $DI$, denoted as $L'(DI) = \\frac{dL}{d(DI)}$. Let's define two functions for clarity:\n$$ f(DI) = CV(DI) = CV_{\\min} + \\Delta CV \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{C}}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ g(DI) = APD(DI) + DI = APD_{\\min} + \\Delta APD \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{A}}\\right)\\right) + DI $$\nThen, $L(DI) = f(DI) \\times g(DI)$. Using the product rule for differentiation, we have:\n$$ L'(DI) = f'(DI) g(DI) + f(DI) g'(DI) $$\nLet's compute the derivatives $f'(DI)$ and $g'(DI)$:\n$$ f'(DI) = \\frac{d}{d(DI)} \\left[ CV_{\\min} + \\Delta CV \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{C}}\\right)\\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta CV}{\\tau_{C}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{C}}\\right) $$\n$$ g'(DI) = \\frac{d}{d(DI)} \\left[ APD_{\\min} + \\Delta APD \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{A}}\\right)\\right) + DI \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta APD}{\\tau_{A}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{A}}\\right) + 1 $$\nNow we examine the sign of each term in the expression for $L'(DI)$ for $DI \\geq 0$. All given parameters ($CV_{\\min}$, $\\Delta CV$, $\\tau_{C}$, $APD_{\\min}$, $\\Delta APD$, $\\tau_{A}$) are positive constants.\n- For $DI \\geq 0$, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{C}}\\right)$ is always positive. Therefore, $f'(DI) > 0$.\n- For $DI \\geq 0$, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI}{\\tau_{A}}\\right)$ is always positive. Therefore, $g'(DI) > 0$.\n- The function $f(DI) = CV(DI)$ represents conduction velocity, which must be positive for propagation. Given $CV_{\\min} = 0.30\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $\\Delta CV = 0.30\\,\\text{m/s}$, $CV(DI) \\geq CV_{\\min} > 0$. Thus, $f(DI) > 0$.\n- The function $g(DI) = APD(DI) + DI$. Given $APD_{\\min} = 0.160\\,\\text{s}$ and $\\Delta APD = 0.040\\,\\text{s}$, $APD(DI) \\geq APD_{\\min} > 0$. For $DI \\geq 0$, it follows that $g(DI) = APD(DI) + DI > 0$.\n\nSince $f(DI)$, $g(DI)$, $f'(DI)$, and $g'(DI)$ are all strictly positive for $DI \\geq 0$, their products and sum must also be strictly positive:\n$$ L'(DI) = \\underbrace{f'(DI)}_{>0} \\underbrace{g(DI)}_{>0} + \\underbrace{f(DI)}_{>0} \\underbrace{g'(DI)}_{>0} > 0 $$\nA strictly positive derivative means that the function $L(DI)$ is monotonically increasing for all $DI \\geq 0$. For a monotonically increasing function defined on the interval $[0, \\infty)$, the minimum value must occur at the lower boundary of the interval, i.e., at $DI = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal path length $L_{\\min}$ is obtained by evaluating $L(DI)$ at $DI = 0$:\n$$ L_{\\min} = L(0) = CV(0) \\times (APD(0) + 0) = CV(0) \\times APD(0) $$\nWe evaluate $APD(0)$ and $CV(0)$ using their definitions:\n$$ APD(0) = APD_{\\min} + \\Delta APD \\left(1 - \\exp(0)\\right) = APD_{\\min} + \\Delta APD (1 - 1) = APD_{\\min} $$\n$$ CV(0) = CV_{\\min} + \\Delta CV \\left(1 - \\exp(0)\\right) = CV_{\\min} + \\Delta CV (1 - 1) = CV_{\\min} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $L_{\\min}$ gives a simple result:\n$$ L_{\\min} = CV_{\\min} \\times APD_{\\min} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values for the parameters:\n$$ L_{\\min} = (0.30\\,\\text{m/s}) \\times (0.160\\,\\text{s}) = 0.048\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in centimeters and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ L_{\\min} = 0.048\\,\\text{m} \\times \\frac{100\\,\\text{cm}}{1\\,\\text{m}} = 4.8\\,\\text{cm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $4.800\\,\\text{cm}$.\n\nFinally, we assess the consistency of this result with the experimental observation $L_{\\text{exp}} = 5.2\\,\\text{cm}$. For sustained reentry to be possible, the actual path length must be greater than or equal to the theoretical minimum path length.\nThe condition is $L \\geq L_{\\min}$.\nIn this case, we have $L_{\\text{exp}} = 5.2\\,\\text{cm}$ and we calculated $L_{\\min} = 4.800\\,\\text{cm}$. Since $5.2 > 4.800$, the condition $L_{\\text{exp}} \\geq L_{\\min}$ is satisfied. This means the experimental observation of a $5.2\\,\\text{cm}$ reentry loop is consistent with the theoretical model, as such a loop is long enough to support sustained reentry. The minimal path length itself is the value calculated.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part derivation and calculation concerning a rigidly rotating spiral wave in an excitable medium. We will address each part systematically, ensuring adherence to the provided physical model and assumptions.\n\nPart $1$: Derivation of the core radius, $r_c$.\nThe propagation of the activation wavefront is governed by the given eikonal窶田urvature relation:\n$$v_{n} = v_{0} - D\\,\\kappa$$\nwhere $v_{n}$ is the local normal velocity of the wavefront, $v_{0}$ is the planar wave speed in the absence of curvature, $D$ is the positive curvature-sensitivity coefficient, and $\\kappa$ is the local curvature of the wavefront.\n\nThe problem defines the core of the spiral wave as a circular boundary of radius $r_{c}$. At this specific boundary, two critical conditions hold:\n$1$. The wavefront is said to stall. This physically means that its inward normal velocity becomes zero, so we have $v_{n} = 0$.\n$2$. For a circular boundary of radius $r_{c}$, the curvature is geometrically defined as the reciprocal of the radius, $\\kappa = 1/r_{c}$. The curvature is taken as a positive quantity for a front that is convex in the direction of propagation (i.e., a wave attempting to propagate inward into a circle).\n\nSubstituting these two conditions, $v_{n} = 0$ and $\\kappa = 1/r_{c}$, into the eikonal窶田urvature relation yields:\n$$0 = v_{0} - D \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{c}}\\right)$$\nTo find the expression for $r_{c}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$D \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{c}}\\right) = v_{0}$$\nSolving for $r_{c}$ gives:\n$$r_{c} = \\frac{D}{v_{0}}$$\nThis expression provides the radius of the spiral wave's non-excitable core as a function of the medium's intrinsic properties, $D$ and $v_{0}$.\n\nPart $2$: Derivation of the rotor period, $T$.\nThe problem posits that the spiral wave undergoes rigid rotation. This is a key assumption which implies that every point in the wave pattern rotates about a fixed center (the center of the core) with the same constant angular velocity, which we shall denote as $\\omega$.\n\nThe period of rotation, $T$, is defined as the time taken for one complete revolution ($2\\pi$ radians). It is related to the angular velocity $\\omega$ by the fundamental relation:\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$$\nThe problem states that at the core boundary, a circular path of radius $r_{c}$, the phase advances tangentially with a local speed $v$. In a rigid rotation model, this tangential speed $v$ is related to the angular velocity $\\omega$ and the radius $r_{c}$ by the standard kinematic formula for circular motion:\n$$v = \\omega r_{c}$$\nWe can express the angular velocity $\\omega$ from this relationship as:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{v}{r_{c}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\omega$ into the equation for the period $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{(v/r_{c})}$$\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi r_{c}}{v}$$\nThis is the required approximate expression for the rotor period $T$ in terms of the core radius $r_{c}$ and the tangential phase speed $v$.

This means the potential at the boundary is clamped, $V(0,t) = V^{*}$, which for the perturbation implies $u(0,t) = 0$ and thus $\\hat{u}(0) = 0$.\n\nWe apply this condition directly to the general solution for $\\hat{u}(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(0) = A_{i}\\,\\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) + A_{r}\\,\\exp(+\\lambda \\cdot 0) = A_{i} + A_{r}\n$$\nSetting this to zero gives:\n$$\nA_{i} + A_{r} = 0\n$$\nThis directly yields the relationship between the amplitudes:\n$$\nA_{r} = -A_{i}\n$$\nThe reflection coefficient for the Dirichlet boundary is therefore:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{A_{r}}{A_{i}} = -1\n$$\n\n**Physical Interpretation and Implications**\nThe derived reflection coefficients, $R_{\\mathrm{N}}=1$ and $R_{\\mathrm{D}}=-1$, have profound implications for how wavefronts interact with tissue boundaries, which in turn influences the dynamics of spiral waves.\n\n- **Neumann Boundary ($R_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1$):** A reflection coefficient of $1$ signifies perfect, in-phase reflection. The incident wave and the reflected wave have the same amplitude and phase at the boundary. The total potential perturbation at the boundary is $\\hat{u}(0) = A_i + A_r = A_i + A_i = 2A_i$. This constructive interference leads to a doubling of the wave amplitude at the insulating boundary. For a full nonlinear wavefront (like the leading edge of an action potential or a spiral wave arm) approaching an insulating boundary, this effect prevents the wave from extinguishing. The current cannot exit the tissue, so it effectively \"piles up\" and reflects, initiating a new wave that propagates away from the boundary. This mechanism can cause a spiral wave rotor that drifts towards an insulating boundary to become \"anchored\" to it, creating a stable, reentrant circuit with the boundary acting as part of the functional obstacle.\n\n- **Dirichlet Boundary ($R_{\\mathrm{D}} = -1$):** A reflection coefficient of $-1$ signifies perfect reflection with a phase inversion of $\\pi$ radians ($180^{\\circ}$). The reflected wave has the same magnitude as the incident wave but opposite sign. The total potential perturbation at the boundary is, by definition of the boundary condition, $\\hat{u}(0) = A_i + A_r = A_i - A_i = 0$. This perfect destructive interference ensures the potential remains at its resting value. Physically, the perfectly conducting bath acts as an infinite sink for the depolarizing current. When a wavefront reaches this boundary, its electrotonic current flows into the bath instead of depolarizing the tissue ahead. This effectively quenches the wave. For a spiral wave, if its core drifts into a region with a Dirichlet-like boundary condition (e.g., a large blood vessel or fibrotic scar tissue that is sufficiently conductive), the wave cannot sustain itself and will be terminated. This boundary condition is therefore considered \"absorbing\" in the context of cardiac wave activity.\n\nIn summary, insulating boundaries promote the reflection and anchoring of spiral waves, contributing to the persistence of arrhythmias, whereas perfectly conducting boundaries promote the absorption and termination of such waves.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of the two coefficients $(R_{\\mathrm{N}}, R_{\\mathrm{D}})$.\n$$\n(R_{\\mathrm{N}}, R_{\\mathrm{D}}) = (1, -1)\n$$",
