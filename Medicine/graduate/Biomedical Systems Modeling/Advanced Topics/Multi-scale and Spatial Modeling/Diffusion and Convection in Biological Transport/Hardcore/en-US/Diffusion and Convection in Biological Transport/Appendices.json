            "problem": "A solute diffuses at steady state through a planar two-region tissue slab in one dimension ($1$D), with the spatial coordinate $x$ increasing from left to right. Region $1$ occupies $0 \\le x \\le L_1$ and has diffusivity $D_1$, and Region $2$ occupies $L_1 \\le x \\le L_1+L_2$ and has diffusivity $D_2$. There are no volumetric sources or sinks in either region, and the interface at $x=L_1$ has no storage, no reaction, and no partitioning barrier for the solute. The left boundary $x=0$ is maintained at concentration $c(0)=C_L$ by a well-stirred blood supply, and the right boundary $x=L_1+L_2$ is maintained at concentration $c(L_1+L_2)=C_R$ by a well-stirred sink.\n\n- Starting only from fundamental statements of diffusive transport (definitions of diffusive flux and steady mass conservation) and from conservation across an interface, formulate the appropriate interface conditions at $x=L_1$ in terms of the continuity of concentration and the continuity of the normal component of the diffusive flux $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}$.\n- Then, solve the steady one-dimensional boundary-value problem to obtain a closed-form expression for the interfacial concentration $c_i := c(L_1)$ in terms of $D_1$, $D_2$, $L_1$, $L_2$, $C_L$, and $C_R$.\n\nExpress your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $c_i$.

            "solution": "We begin from first principles of diffusion and mass conservation. The diffusive flux in one dimension is defined by Fick’s first law, which states that the flux $J(x)$ is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient, with proportionality constant given by the diffusivity. In each homogeneous region with diffusivity $D$, this is\n$$\nJ(x) \\;=\\; -\\,D\\,\\frac{d c}{d x}.\n$$\nAt steady state with no volumetric sources or sinks, local mass conservation requires that the divergence of the flux vanishes. In one dimension, this implies\n$$\n\\frac{d J}{d x} \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nso the flux $J$ is spatially constant within each region. Combining these two statements in each homogeneous region implies that the concentration profile in each region is linear in $x$.\n\nNext, we formulate the interface conditions at $x=L_1$ using conservation across an infinitesimal pillbox that straddles the interface. Let $\\mathbf{n}$ denote the unit normal vector pointing from Region $1$ into Region $2$. Consider an infinitesimally thin control volume enclosing the interface at $x=L_1$. Steady-state conservation with no interfacial storage and no interfacial reaction requires that the net flux entering the interface from Region $1$ equals the net flux leaving into Region $2$. Hence, the normal component of the flux is continuous:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_1 \\;=\\; \\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_2.\n$$\nIn one dimension with the positive $x$-direction pointing from Region $1$ to Region $2$, this reduces to\n$$\nJ_1(L_1^{-}) \\;=\\; J_2(L_1^{+}).\n$$\nAdditionally, in the absence of any partitioning barrier at the interface for the same solute and medium continuity, the chemical potential is continuous across the interface.

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Governing PDE\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of conservation of mass to a one-dimensional differential control volume of the conduit, from position $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$, with a uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The total solute flux, $J(x,t)$, is the sum of the advective flux, $J_{\\mathrm{adv}} = v c(x,t)$, and the diffusive flux, which is given by Fick's first law, $J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$.\n$$J(x,t) = v c(x,t) - D \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial x}$$\nThe rate of change of solute mass within the volume $A \\Delta x$ must equal the net rate of solute entering the volume minus the rate of solute lost to metabolic consumption. The mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = (\\text{Rate In}) - (\\text{Rate Out}) - (\\text{Rate of Consumption})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (A \\Delta x c) = A J(x,t) - A J(x+\\Delta x, t) - (k c) (A \\Delta x)\n$$\nDividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$ and rearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{J(x+\\Delta x, t) - J(x,t)}{\\Delta x} - k c\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the first term on the right-hand side becomes the negative partial derivative of the flux with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} - k c\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the total flux $J$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(v c - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c\n$$\nSince $v$ and $D$ are constants, we can expand the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}}_{\\text{Accumulation}} + \\underbrace{v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}}_{\\text{Advection}} = \\underbrace{D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}}_{\\text{Diffusion}} - \\underbrace{k c}_{\\text{Reaction}}\n$$\n\n### Steady-State Solution\n\nAt steady state, the concentration does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE reduces to a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dc}{dx} - k c = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we assume a solution of the form $c(x) = e^{rx}$ and substitute it into the equation, which yields the characteristic equation:\n$$\nD r^2 - v r - k = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-(-v) \\pm \\sqrt{(-v)^2 - 4(D)(-k)}}{2D} = \\frac{v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nLet the two distinct real roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_2 = \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nSince $v0$, $D0$, and $k0$, the term $\\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}$ is real and greater than $v$. Consequently, $r_1  0$ and $r_2  0$.\nThe general solution to the ODE is a linear combination of the two exponential solutions:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n### Application of Boundary Conditions\n\n1.  **Boundary condition at $x \\to \\infty$**: The problem states that the concentration must remain finite as $x \\to \\infty$. Since $r_1  0$, the term $e^{r_1 x}$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To keep the concentration finite, the coefficient $C_1$ must be zero. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n    $$\n    c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}\n    $$\n2.  **Boundary condition at $x=0$**: The condition at the inlet is a flux balance, often called a Danckwerts boundary condition. The flux entering the conduit from the purely advective upstream reservoir is $v c_{\\mathrm{in}}$. This must equal the total advective and diffusive flux just inside the conduit at $x=0^+$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Flux at } x=0^- = \\text{Flux at } x=0^+\n    $$\n    $$\n    v c_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\left. \\left( v c(x) - D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) \\right|_{x=0}\n    $$\n    We have $c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}$, so $c(0) = C_2$. The derivative is $\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_2 r_2 e^{r_2 x}$, so $\\left. \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = C_2 r_2$. Substituting these into the boundary condition gives:\n    $$\n    v c_{\\mathrm{in}} = v C_2 - D (C_2 r_2) = C_2 (v - D r_2)\n    $$\n    Now we solve for the constant $C_2$:\n    $$\n    C_2 = \\frac{v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v - D r_2}\n    $$\n    Let's substitute the expression for $r_2$:\n    $$\n    v - D r_2 = v - D \\left( \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\right) = v - \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    v - D r_2 = \\frac{2v - (v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk})}{2} = \\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}\n    $$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $C_2$:\n    $$\n    C_2 = \\frac{v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}} = \\frac{2v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}\n    $$\n    \n### Final Expression for the Concentration Profile\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $C_2$ and $r_2$ back into the solution $c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}$ to obtain the explicit steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = \\left( \\frac{2v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}} \\right) \\exp\\left( \\left( \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\right) x \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state concentration $c(x)$ for $x \\geq 0$.",

The onset of oscillations in the FTCS scheme is dictated by the condition $\\mathrm{Pe}_\\Delta  2$, as shown in the analysis of statement A. If one holds $\\mathrm{Pe}_\\Delta$ fixed at a value greater than $2$, the stencil coefficient $(\\lambda - \\mu/2)$ remains negative, and the scheme will produce oscillations regardless of the value of $\\Delta x$. Decreasing $\\Delta x$ will refine the grid and change the wavelength of the oscillations, but it will not eliminate the fundamental violation of the maximum principle. The property causing oscillations is inherent to the ratio of advection to diffusion at the grid cell level, not the absolute size of the grid cell itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For very high $\\mathrm{Pe}_\\Delta$, adding an upwind bias that is equivalent to an artificial diffusion of magnitude $D_{\\text{num}} \\sim u\\,\\Delta x/2$ suppresses oscillations but broadens physical layers; a high-resolution flux-limiter scheme (for example, the monotonized central limiter) attains second-order accuracy in smooth regions while preserving monotonicity and the maximum principle near steep gradients.**\n\nLet's analyze the first part. The first-order upwind scheme can be seen as a centered scheme plus an extra term:\n$\\frac{c_i - c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{c_{i+1} - c_{i-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x} - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\left( \\frac{c_{i+1} - 2c_i + c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)$.\nSubstituting this into the PDE, the upwind advection term $u\\frac{c_i-c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}$ is equivalent to a centered advection term plus an artificial numerical diffusion term $-u\\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$. The effective diffusion becomes $D + u \\Delta x/2$. This numerical diffusion, with $D_{\\text{num}} = u \\Delta x/2$, is what damps oscillations (suppresses them) at the cost of smearing sharp fronts (broadening physical layers). This perfectly describes the behavior of FOU schemes.\nThe second part describes high-resolution schemes. These schemes are designed to be nonlinear, adapting their behavior based on the local solution. In smooth regions, they use a high-order (e.g., second-order) stencil to achieve high accuracy. Near steep gradients or discontinuities, they blend in a robust, first-order monotonic scheme to prevent oscillations and preserve the maximum principle. Flux limiters, such as the monotonized central (MC) limiter, are precisely the mechanism for this blending. This statement accurately summarizes the state-of-the-art approach for such problems.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. There exist linear, second-order centered explicit schemes for the scalar advection equation $\\partial c/\\partial t + u\\,\\partial c/\\partial x = 0$ with $u0$ that are unconditionally monotone and satisfy the discrete maximum principle for all Courant numbers $\\mu$.**\n\nThis statement has two major flaws.\n1. Godunov's order barrier theorem (1959) states that any linear numerical scheme for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (like the advection equation) that is monotonicity-preserving can be at most first-order accurate. The statement proposes a scheme that is both linear and second-order while also being monotone, which is a direct contradiction of this fundamental theorem.\n2. The statement claims the scheme works \"for all Courant numbers $\\mu$\". Explicit schemes for the advection equation are subject to the CFL stability condition, which typically requires $\\mu \\le 1$. No explicit linear scheme is unconditionally stable.\nTherefore, such a scheme cannot exist.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
