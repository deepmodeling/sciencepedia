The lumen pressure is uniform and equal to $p_{i}$, and the external tissue pressure is $p_{o}=0$ (gauge). The wall is homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic, and experiences small strains; axial end effects are neglected so the state is axisymmetric and quasi-static. Let the inner radius be $R_{i}$ and the outer radius be $R_{o}$. The thickness ratio is defined as $\\lambda = R_{o}/R_{i}$.\n\nStarting from fundamental mechanical balance and admissible stress functions, derive the Lame stress distribution $(\\sigma_{r}(r), \\sigma_{\\theta}(r))$ for the pressurized thick-walled cylinder in terms of $p_{i}$, $p_{o}$, $R_{i}$, and $R_{o}$, and then evaluate the exact circumferential (hoop) stress at the inner wall, $\\sigma_{\\theta}(R_{i})$. Next, consider the classical thin-wall membrane approximation with circumferential stress taken as uniform through the thickness, computed from force balance using the mean radius $R_{m} = (R_{i}+R_{o})/2$ and thickness $t = R_{o}-R_{i}$, namely $\\sigma_{\\theta}^{\\text{thin}} = p_{i} R_{m}/t$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically biofluid mechanics concerning blood flow in arteries. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. The provided values for blood density, viscosity, flow rate, artery radius, and curvature are physiologically realistic. The terminology is objective and precise.\n\nThe task is to compute the Dean number, $De$, for the specified carotid artery segment and to assess the influence of secondary flows on wall shear stress.\n\nThe Dean number is the standard dimensionless group that characterizes the strength of secondary flows in a curved pipe. It is defined as the product of the Reynolds number, $Re$, and the square root of the curvature ratio, $\\delta$.\n$$\nDe = Re \\sqrt{\\delta}\n$$\n\nFirst, we define the Reynolds number, $Re$, for flow in a pipe of hydraulic diameter $D$.\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $V$ is the average flow velocity, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For a circular tube of internal radius $a$, the hydraulic diameter is $D = 2a$. The Reynolds number is therefore:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho V (2a)}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nThe average velocity $V$ is related to the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the cross-sectional area of the tube $A = \\pi a^2$ by the fundamental kinematic definition:\n$$\nV = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\pi a^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $V$ into the Reynolds number equation gives:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\frac{Q}{\\pi a^2}\\right) (2a)}{\\mu} = \\frac{2\\rho Q}{\\pi a \\mu}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the curvature ratio, $\\delta$. This is the ratio of the pipe's internal radius $a$ to its centerline radius of curvature $R_c$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{a}{R_c}\n$$\nThe problem provides the centerline curvature $\\kappa$, which is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature, $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R_c}$. Therefore, we can express the curvature ratio as:\n$$\n\\delta = a\\kappa\n$$\n\nNow we assemble the complete expression for the Dean number by substituting the expressions for $Re$ and $\\delta$:\n$$\nDe = \\left( \\frac{2\\rho Q}{\\pi a \\mu} \\right) \\sqrt{a\\kappa}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the Dean number based on the given parameters.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Internal radius: $a = 3 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Centerline curvature: $\\kappa = 50 \\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$\n- Volumetric flow rate: $Q = 4 \\,\\mathrm{mL\\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- Blood density: $\\rho = 1060 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^{-3}}$\n- Blood dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 3.5 \\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$\n\nBefore calculation, all values must be converted to a consistent system of units, the SI system (meters, kilograms, seconds).\n- $a = 3 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\kappa = 50 \\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$ (already in SI units)\n- $Q = 4 \\,\\mathrm{mL\\cdot s^{-1}} = 4 \\,\\mathrm{cm^3 \\cdot s^{-1}} = 4 \\times (10^{-2})^3 \\,\\mathrm{m^3 \\cdot s^{-1}} = 4 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m^3 \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- $\\rho = 1060 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^{-3}}$ (already in SI units)\n- $\\mu = 3.5 \\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n\nWe can now substitute these numerical values into the symbolic expression for $De$:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{2(1060)(4 \\times 10^{-6})}{\\pi (3 \\times 10^{-3})(3.5 \\times 10^{-3})} \\sqrt{(3 \\times 10^{-3})(50)}\n$$\nLet's simplify the terms:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{8480 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi (10.5 \\times 10^{-6})} \\sqrt{0.15}\n$$\nThe factor of $10^{-6}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n$$\nDe = \\frac{8480}{10.5\\pi} \\sqrt{0.15}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nDe \\approx \\frac{8480}{32.9867} \\times 0.387298\n$$\n$$\nDe \\approx 257.073 \\times 0.387298\n$$\n$$\nDe \\approx 99.554\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we get $De = 99.6$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess whether secondary flows are likely to influence wall shear stress (WSS). The Dean number quantifies the strength of these secondary motions (Dean vortices) relative to the primary axial flow. A common empirical threshold is that for $De > 40$, secondary flows become significant and substantially alter the flow field from the simple parabolic profile of Poiseuille flow in a straight pipe.\n\nOur calculated value is $De \\approx 99.6$, which is well above this threshold of $40$. Therefore, secondary flows are certainly strong enough to have a major influence on the distribution of wall shear stress. In a curved pipe, secondary flows transport high-momentum fluid from the center of the pipe towards the outer wall of the bend. This skews the axial velocity profile, shifting the point of maximum velocity from the centerline towards the outer wall. As WSS is proportional to the velocity gradient at the wall ($\\tau_w = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}|_{wall}$), this redistribution of momentum results in a non-uniform WSS distribution around the circumference of the artery. Specifically, the WSS will be significantly higher on the outer wall of the curve and lower on the inner wall compared to the values that would be found in a straight pipe with the same flow rate. This phenomenon is of great clinical interest, as low and oscillating WSS on the inner wall of arterial curvatures is often implicated in the development of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\nIn conclusion, secondary flows are very likely to influence the wall shear stress in this carotid artery model, leading to its significant spatial variation.",

Implementation Plan**\n\nThe program will be structured as follows:\n1.  Define all physical and simulation constants (e.g., $T, t_s, \\text{SV}, \\Delta t$, conversion factor). All calculations will be performed in SI units (Pa, m$^3$, s).\n2.  Create a time vector `t_vec` from $0$ to $2T$ with step $\\Delta t$.\n3.  Pre-calculate the inflow waveform `Q_in_vec` for all time steps to avoid repeated calculations inside the simulation loop. The periodic nature of the flow will be handled using the modulo operator on time.\n4.  Loop through each test case in the test suite.\n5.  For each case, run two separate simulations:\n    a.  **R-only model:** Initialize a pressure array `P_r_only` with the initial condition $P(0)$. Iterate through the time steps, applying the Forward Euler update rule for the R-only model.\n    b.  **RCR model:** Initialize two pressure arrays, `P_rcr` and `Pd_rcr`, with their initial conditions. Iterate through the time steps, applying the coupled Forward Euler update rules for the RCR model.\n6.  After each simulation, find the maximum value in the resulting pressure array. This is the peak pressure.\n7.  Convert the peak pressures from Pascals (Pa) to millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n8.  Calculate the difference between the RCR peak and the R-only peak.\n9.  Format the three resulting metrics (peak R-only, peak RCR, difference) to two decimal places and store them.\n10. After iterating through all test cases, assemble the final results into the specified list-of-lists string format for output.",
