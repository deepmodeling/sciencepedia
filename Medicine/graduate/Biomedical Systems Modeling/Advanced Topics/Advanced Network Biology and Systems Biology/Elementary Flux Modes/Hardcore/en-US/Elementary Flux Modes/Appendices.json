            "problem": "In systems biology, Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) represent fundamental, minimal pathways through a metabolic network that can operate at a steady state. Consider a hypothetical metabolic network involving two internal metabolites, X and Y. The network consists of three irreversible enzymatic reactions, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. The dynamics of the internal metabolites are described by the stoichiometric matrix $S$, where the rows correspond to metabolites (in the order X, Y) and the columns correspond to reactions (in the order $R_1, R_2, R_3$):\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  -1 \\\\ -1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA flux vector $v = [v_1, v_2, v_3]^T$ describes the rates of these three reactions. For a vector to be an EFM, it must satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Steady-State:** The net production of each internal metabolite must be zero, which is mathematically stated as $S \\cdot v = 0$.\n2.  **Irreversibility:** Since all reactions are irreversible, all fluxes must be non-negative, i.e., $v_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$.\n3.  **Elemental Minimality:** The set of active reactions (those with non-zero flux) must be minimal. This means there is no other non-zero, steady-state flux vector $v'$ (satisfying conditions 1 and 2) whose set of active reactions is a proper subset of the set of active reactions for $v$.\n\nTwo valid steady-state flux vectors for this network are given as $f_1 = [1, 1, 0]^T$ and $f_2 = [1, 0, 1]^T$. Now, consider a new flux vector, $f_3$, which is the sum of the first two: $f_3 = f_1 + f_2$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses whether $f_3$ is an Elementary Flux Mode?\n\nA. Yes, because it is the sum of two valid steady-state flux vectors.\n\nB. Yes, because it satisfies the steady-state condition ($S \\cdot f_3 = 0$) and all its component fluxes are positive.\n\nC. No, because its set of active reactions is not minimal.\n\nD. No, because the sum of two different EFMs can never be an EFM.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine without more information about the external metabolites.",
            "solution": "The steady-state condition for flux vector $v = [v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}]^{T}$ is given by $S \\cdot v = 0$. With\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  -1 \\\\ -1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nthe steady-state equations are\n$$\nv_{1} - v_{2} - v_{3} = 0, \\quad -v_{1} + v_{2} + v_{3} = 0,\n$$\nwhich are equivalent and reduce to\n$$\nv_{1} = v_{2} + v_{3},\n$$\nwith irreversibility constraints $v_{i} \\geq 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe given steady-state flux vectors are $f_{1} = [1, 1, 0]^{T}$ and $f_{2} = [1, 0, 1]^{T}$, both satisfying $v_{1} = v_{2} + v_{3}$ and $v_{i} \\geq 0$.

Hence $f_{3}$ meets the steady-state and irreversibility conditions.\n\nTo test elemental minimality, note that the active set of $f_{3}$ is $\\{R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}\\}$. However, there exist nonzero steady-state flux vectors with proper subsets of this active set:\n- Setting $v_{3} = 0$ and $v_{2}  0$ yields $v_{1} = v_{2}$, exemplified by $f_{1} = [1, 1, 0]^{T}$ with active set $\\{R_{1}, R_{2}\\}$.\n- Setting $v_{2} = 0$ and $v_{3}  0$ yields $v_{1} = v_{3}$, exemplified by $f_{2} = [1, 0, 1]^{T}$ with active set $\\{R_{1}, R_{3}\\}$.\n\nSince such steady-state, nonnegative flux vectors exist whose active reaction sets are proper subsets of that of $f_{3}$, $f_{3}$ fails the elemental minimality condition and is therefore not an EFM.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that $f_{3}$ is not an EFM because its set of active reactions is not minimal. This corresponds to option C. Options A and B ignore minimality; D is too strong (in general, sums of EFMs can coincide with an EFM in degenerate cases), and E is irrelevant because internal steady-state and irreversibility suffice here.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the number of elementary flux modes (EFMs) for a given metabolic network. The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific and mathematical soundness, completeness, and objectivity. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nAn elementary flux mode is a non-zero, feasible, steady-state flux vector $v$ with minimal support. Feasibility is defined by two conditions:\n1.  **Steady State**: The concentrations of internal metabolites do not change over time. This is expressed by the linear system $S v = 0$, where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $v$ is the vector of reaction fluxes.\n2.  **Irreversibility**: All reactions are irreversible, meaning all fluxes must be non-negative. This is expressed as $v \\ge 0$ (component-wise), i.e., $v_i \\ge 0$ for each reaction $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}$.\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ is given as:\n$$\nS \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\;\\;1  -1  -1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  -1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0\\\\\n\\;\\;0  \\;\\;1  \\;\\;0  -1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0\\\\\n\\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;1  \\;\\;0  -1  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0\\\\\n\\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;0  \\;\\;1  \\;\\;1  \\;\\;1  -1  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows correspond to the internal metabolites $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ respectively. The columns correspond to the reaction fluxes $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$. The system of linear equations $S v = 0$ can be written out explicitly:\n1.  Metabolite $A$: $v_1 - v_2 - v_3 - v_6 = 0$\n2.  Metabolite $B$: $v_2 - v_4 = 0$\n3.  Metabolite $C$: $v_3 - v_5 = 0$\n4.  Metabolite $D$: $v_4 + v_5 + v_6 - v_7 - v_8 = 0$\n\nFrom equations (2) and (3), we deduce direct dependencies between fluxes:\n- $v_2 = v_4$\n- $v_3 = v_5$\nSince all fluxes must be non-negative ($v_i \\ge 0$), this implies that reaction $R_2$ is active if and only if $R_4$ is active. They form a coupled pathway $A \\to B \\to D$. Similarly, $R_3$ is active if and only if $R_5$ is active, forming the pathway $A \\to C \\to D$.\n\nSubstituting $v_2=v_4$ and $v_3=v_5$ into equation (1) gives:\n$v_1 - v_4 - v_5 - v_6 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_4 + v_5 + v_6$\n\nFrom equation (4), we have:\n$v_4 + v_5 + v_6 = v_7 + v_8$\n\nCombining these two derived relations yields a global conservation law:\n$v_1 = v_7 + v_8$\nThis means the total influx into the network ($v_1$) must equal the total outflux ($v_7 + v_8$) at steady state, which is expected.\n\nAn EFM corresponds to a minimal set of reactions that can operate at steady state. Since $R_1$ is the sole input reaction, any non-zero feasible flux must have $v_1  0$. The flux must then proceed from metabolite $A$ to metabolite $D$ via one of three possible routes, and finally exit the system via one of the two sink reactions, $R_7$ or $R_8$. The three routes from $A$ to $D$ are:\n- Route 1: $A \\to B \\to D$, involving reactions $R_2$ and $R_4$.\n- Route 2: $A \\to C \\to D$, involving reactions $R_3$ and $R_5$.\n- Route 3: $A \\to D$ directly, involving reaction $R_6$.\n\nWe can systematically enumerate all minimal pathways by combining the single input, one of the three intermediate routes, and one of the two outputs. This gives $1 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 6$ possible combinations.\n\n1.  **Pathway 1**: $R_1 \\to$ Route 1 $\\to R_7$. Active reactions are $\\{R_1, R_2, R_4, R_7\\}$.\n    Let $v_1=k$ for some $k  0$. The equations $v_1=v_2$, $v_2=v_4$, $v_4=v_7$ imply $v_1=v_2=v_4=v_7=k$. All other fluxes are $0$.\n    The corresponding flux vector is $e_1 = k(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0)^T$. The support is $\\{1, 2, 4, 7\\}$. This is a minimal set, as removing any reaction would violate the steady-state condition.\n\n2.  **Pathway 2**: $R_1 \\to$ Route 1 $\\to R_8$.

Active reactions are $\\{R_1, R_3, R_5, R_7\\}$.\n    The equations imply $v_1=v_3=v_5=v_7=k$.\n    The flux vector is $e_3 = k(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)^T$. The support is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. This is minimal.\n\n4.  **Pathway 4**: $R_1 \\to$ Route 2 $\\to R_8$. Active reactions are $\\{R_1, R_3, R_5, R_8\\}$.\n    The equations imply $v_1=v_3=v_5=v_8=k$.\n    The flux vector is $e_4 = k(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)^T$. The support is $\\{1, 3, 5, 8\\}$. This is minimal.\n\n5.  **Pathway 5**: $R_1 \\to$ Route 3 $\\to R_7$. Active reactions are $\\{R_1, R_6, R_7\\}$.\n    The equations imply $v_1=v_6=v_7=k$.\n    The flux vector is $e_5 = k(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)^T$. The support is $\\{1, 6, 7\\}$. This is minimal.\n\n6.  **Pathway 6**: $R_1 \\to$ Route 3 $\\to R_8$. Active reactions are $\\{R_1, R_6, R_8\\}$.\n    The equations imply $v_1=v_6=v_8=k$.\n    The flux vector is $e_6 = k(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1)^T$. The support is $\\{1, 6, 8\\}$. This is minimal.\n\nEach of these $6$ vectors corresponds to an elementary flux mode. They are distinct, and their supports are minimal. Any other feasible flux vector would be a non-negative linear combination of these EFMs (a conical combination). For instance, a flux vector $w = e_1 + e_2 = k(2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1)^T$ is a valid steady-state flux. However, its support, $\\operatorname{supp}(w)=\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 8\\}$, properly contains the support of both $e_1$ and $e_2$. Therefore, by the definition of an EFM, $w$ is not elementary. This logic applies to any combination of the $6$ identified modes.\n\nThe network structure does not permit any other combination of reactions to form a minimal, feasible flux. Thus, there are exactly $6$ distinct elementary flux modes.",

It presents a standard task in metabolic pathway analysis using established definitions and concepts like stoichiometric matrices, steady-state flux cones, and EFMs. The provided data is complete and consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the EFMs\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the extreme rays of the convex polyhedral cone defined by the system of linear equations and inequalities:\n1. $S v = 0$\n2. $v \\geq 0$ (component-wise)\n\nFirst, we find a basis for the nullspace of $S$. The condition $S v = 0$ corresponds to the following system of linear equations, where $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5)^T$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1 - v_2 - v_5 = 0 \\\\\nv_2 - v_3 = 0 \\\\\nv_3 - v_4 + v_5 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe rank of the matrix $S$ is $3$. The dimension of the nullspace is $n - \\text{rank}(S) = 5 - 3 = 2$. We choose $v_4$ and $v_5$ as free variables. Let's express the other variables in terms of them.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $v_2 = v_3$.\nFrom the third equation, we have $v_3 = v_4 - v_5$.\nTherefore, $v_2 = v_4 - v_5$.\nSubstituting these into the first equation:\n$v_1 - (v_4 - v_5) - v_5 = 0 \\implies v_1 - v_4 + v_5 - v_5 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_4$.\n\nLet the free variables be parameterized by $t_1$ and $t_2$:\n$v_4 = t_1$\n$v_5 = t_2$\n\nThen the dependent variables are:\n$v_1 = t_1$\n$v_2 = t_1 - t_2$\n$v_3 = t_1 - t_2$\n\nThe general solution for a vector $v$ in the nullspace of $S$ can be written as:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\\\ v_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t_1 \\\\ t_1 - t_2 \\\\ t_1 - t_2 \\\\ t_1 \\\\ t_2 \\end{pmatrix} = t_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + t_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $t_1, t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, we apply the irreversibility constraints $v_i \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$:\n1. $v_1 = t_1 \\ge 0$\n2. $v_2 = t_1 - t_2 \\ge 0 \\implies t_1 \\ge t_2$\n3. $v_3 = t_1 - t_2 \\ge 0$ (redundant with the previous)\n4. $v_4 = t_1 \\ge 0$ (redundant with the first and second constraints)\n5. $v_5 = t_2 \\ge 0$\n\nCombining these inequalities on the parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$, we find the feasible region defining the flux cone: $t_1 \\ge t_2 \\ge 0$. This is a cone in the $(t_1, t_2)$ parameter space, bounded by the rays $t_2 = 0$ (where $t_1  0$) and $t_1 = t_2$ (where $t_1, t_2  0$).\n\nThe extreme rays of the steady-state flux cone correspond to the boundaries of this feasible region in the parameter space. We find a generator for each boundary ray:\n1. For the boundary $t_2 = 0$: we can choose a point such as $(t_1, t_2) = (1, 0)$. This gives the first extreme ray, $e_1$:\n$$\ne_1 = 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n2. For the boundary $t_1 = t_2$: we can choose a point such as $(t_1, t_2) = (1, 1)$. This gives the second extreme ray, $e_2$:\n$$\ne_2 = 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) of the network. They have minimal support, as the support of $e_1$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and the support of $e_2$ is $\\{1, 4, 5\\}$, and neither is a subset of the other.\n\n### Step 3: Normalization and Final Calculation\n\nThe problem requires normalizing each EFM so that the uptake flux $v_1$ equals $1$. The reaction $R_1$ is the sole uptake reaction as it is the only one producing an internal metabolite from the exterior (its column in $S$ has a positive entry for metabolite $A$ and zeros otherwise).\nFor $EFM_1 = e_1$, the first component is $v_1 = 1$. The EFM is already normalized.\nFor $EFM_2 = e_2$, the first component is $v_1 = 1$. This EFM is also already normalized.\n\nLet the normalized EFMs be $e'_1$ and $e'_2$.\n$e'_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$e'_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFinally, we compute the sum of the $L_1$ norms of these normalized EFMs. The $L_1$ norm of a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is $\\|x\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i|$. Since all flux values are non-negative, the absolute value is redundant.\n\nThe $L_1$ norm of $e'_1$ is:\n$$\n\\|e'_1\\|_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4\n$$\nThe $L_1$ norm of $e'_2$ is:\n$$\n\\|e'_2\\|_1 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nThe sum of the $L_1$ norms is:\n$$\n\\text{Sum} = \\|e'_1\\|_1 + \\|e'_2\\|_1 = 4 + 3 = 7\n$$\nThe final answer is an exact integer.",
