This exercise demonstrates the core technique for identifying a saddle-node bifurcation: finding the critical parameter value where two fixed points merge and annihilate by simultaneously solving for the equilibrium and zero-slope conditions . This approach is fundamental for locating tipping points in a wide array of systems.",

            "problem": "A simplified model for the population dynamics of a certain microbe species is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = r \\ln(x) - x $$\nHere, $x(t)$ represents the population density, which must be positive ($x > 0$). The parameter $r$ is a positive, dimensionless external control constant related to nutrient availability.\n\nThe number of stable, non-changing population densities, known as equilibrium states, is dependent on the value of $r$. Below a certain critical value of this parameter, $r_c$, no equilibrium states are possible, leading to the population's extinction. At the critical value $r_c$, exactly one equilibrium state exists. Above this value, two distinct equilibrium states appear.\n\nDetermine the exact analytical expression for this critical parameter value, $r_c$.",
            "solution": "An equilibrium state, or fixed point, of the system is a value of the population density $x$ for which the population does not change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\n\nLet the function describing the rate of change be $f(x, r) = r \\ln(x) - x$. Setting this function to zero gives the equation for the equilibrium points:\n$$r \\ln(x) - x = 0$$\n\nWe are looking for the critical value of the parameter, $r_c$, at which the number of solutions for $x$ in this equation changes. This transition point occurs when the system has exactly one solution for $x$. In general, for a system $\\dot{x} = f(x, r)$, a bifurcation where fixed points merge occurs when the conditions $f(x, r) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ are satisfied simultaneously for the same critical values of $x_c$ and $r_c$. This is because at the merging point, the curve of $f(x, r)$ for a fixed $r_c$ becomes tangent to the $x$-axis, implying a root with zero slope.\n\nSo, we must solve the following system of two equations for the critical values $x_c$ and $r_c$:\n1. $f(x_c, r_c) = r_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(x_c, r_c)} = 0$\n\nLet's first compute the partial derivative of $f(x, r)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (r \\ln(x) - x) = \\frac{r}{x} - 1 $$\nNow we set this derivative to zero to satisfy the second condition:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{x_c} - 1 = 0 $$\nSolving for $r_c$ in terms of $x_c$, we find:\n$$ r_c = x_c $$\nThis relationship tells us that at the bifurcation point, the parameter value is equal to the equilibrium population density.\n\nNext, we substitute this relationship, $r_c = x_c$, into the first equation, $r_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0$:\n$$ x_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $x_c$:\n$$ x_c (\\ln(x_c) - 1) = 0 $$\nThe problem statement specifies that the population density must be positive, so $x_c > 0$. This allows us to divide both sides by $x_c$, which yields:\n$$ \\ln(x_c) - 1 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\ln(x_c)$:\n$$ \\ln(x_c) = 1 $$\nTo find $x_c$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ x_c = e^{1} = e $$\nThis is the population density at the critical point.\n\nFinally, to find the critical parameter value $r_c$, we use the relationship we found earlier, $r_c = x_c$.\nSubstituting the value of $x_c = e$, we get:\n$$ r_c = e $$\nThus, the critical value of the parameter $r$ is $e$. For $r > e$, there are two equilibrium solutions; for $r = e$, there is one; and for $0  r  e$, there are no real solutions for the equilibrium state, leading to population collapse.",

Fixed points satisfy\n$$\nF(x,r) = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad x^{3} + x = r.\n$$\nLet $h(x) = x^{3} + x$. Then $h'(x) = 3x^{2} + 1 > 0$ for all real $x$. Therefore $h$ is strictly increasing on the entire real line. Moreover,\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = -\\infty, \\qquad \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\infty,\n$$\nso $h$ is a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.

Hence, for every $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the system has exactly one fixed point.\n\nNext, we assess stability and possible bifurcations. In one-dimensional flows, a fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ is hyperbolic if $\\partial F/\\partial x$ at $x^{\\ast}$ is nonzero. Compute\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x,r) = -3x^{2} - 1  0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n$$\nThus, at the unique fixed point for any $r$, $\\partial F/\\partial x \\neq 0$, so the fixed point is hyperbolic and in fact stable (since the derivative is negative). Because there is no parameter value at which $\\partial F/\\partial x = 0$, no saddle-node, transcritical, or pitchfork bifurcation can occur. Furthermore, since the number of fixed points is always one for all $r$, there is no parameter interval with three fixed points.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the system exhibits no bifurcations and possesses exactly one fixed point for every $r$.",

Starting from the foundational definitions of equilibrium ($\\dot{x} = 0$), linear stability determined by the Jacobian in a scalar ODE ($\\dfrac{d\\dot{x}}{dx}$), and the definition that a saddle-node bifurcation occurs when two equilibria coalesce with zero eigenvalue and nonzero second derivative, derive parameter regime conditions under which the system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation as $\\mu$ varies. Express the fold (saddle-node) points in terms of the state $x$ and the parameter value $\\mu$ at which the equilibrium pair is created or annihilated.\n\nYour derivation must begin from first principles of equilibrium and stability for one-dimensional autonomous systems and proceed by characterizing the extrema of the function $\\dfrac{d\\dot{x}}{dx}$ over $x \\geq 0$ to determine whether there exist values of $x$ at which the equilibrium condition and zero-slope condition are simultaneously satisfied.
