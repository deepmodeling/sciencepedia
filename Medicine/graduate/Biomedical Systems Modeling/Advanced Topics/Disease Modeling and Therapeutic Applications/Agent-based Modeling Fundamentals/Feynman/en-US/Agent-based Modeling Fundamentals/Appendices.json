It describes a standard discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a type of one-dimensional cellular automaton on a ring, for which all necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided to compute the subsequent state.

Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the state vector $x(1)$ at time $t=1$, given the initial state vector $x(0)$ at time $t=0$. The system consists of $n=10$ agents on a ring. The state of each agent $i$ is binary, $x_i(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the canonical choice distribution $\\pi_i(a)$ is a constrained optimization problem. We must maximize the Shannon entropy $H(\\pi_i)$ subject to the normalization and expected utility constraints. This is optimally handled using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\pi_i, \\lambda_0, \\beta) = H(\\pi_i) - \\lambda_0 \\left( \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi_i(a) - 1 \\right) - \\beta \\left( \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi_i(a) U_i(a) - \\langle U \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda_0$ and $\\beta$ are the Lagrange multipliers for the normalization and expected utility constraints, respectively.

For $U(t)$ agents, the total rate of deaths from this process is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{apoptosis}} = \\delta U(t)\n$$\n\n(iii) **Contact-Mediated Death:** The problem states that any ordered pair of distinct occupied sites, say agent $i$ and agent $j$ ($i \\ne j$), contributes to a kill at a rate of $\\frac{\\gamma}{N}$. The total number of such ordered pairs is $U(t)(U(t)-1)$. Thus, the total rate of contact-mediated deaths is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{contact-death}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{N} U(t) (U(t)-1)\n$$\nThe $\\frac{1}{N}$ scaling factor is crucial for obtaining a sensible mean-field limit.\n\nCombining these rates, the total rate of change for $U(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{birth}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{apoptosis}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{contact-death}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\beta U(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{U(t)}{N}\\right) - \\delta U(t) - \\frac{\\gamma}{N} U(t)(U(t)-1)\n$$\n\nTo obtain the ODE for the density $u(t)$, we use the relationship $U(t) = N u(t)$, which implies $\\frac{dU}{dt} = N \\frac{du}{dt}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\nN \\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta (N u(t)) (1 - u(t)) - \\delta (N u(t)) - \\frac{\\gamma}{N} (N u(t)) (N u(t) - 1)\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $N$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta u(t) (1 - u(t)) - \\delta u(t) - \\frac{\\gamma}{N^2} (N u(t)) (N u(t) - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta u(t) (1 - u(t)) - \\delta u(t) - \\gamma u(t) \\left(\\frac{N u(t) - 1}{N}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta u(t) (1 - u(t)) - \\delta u(t) - \\gamma u(t) \\left(u(t) - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we take the large-population limit, $N \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $\\frac{1}{N}$ vanishes. This constitutes the mean-field approximation.\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\beta u(t)(1 - u(t)) - \\delta u(t) - \\gamma u(t)\\left(u(t) - \\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta u(t)(1 - u(t)) - \\delta u(t) - \\gamma (u(t))^2\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation by expanding the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\beta u(t) - \\beta (u(t))^2 - \\delta u(t) - \\gamma (u(t))^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = (\\beta - \\delta) u(t) - (\\beta + \\gamma) (u(t))^2\n$$\nThis is the required deterministic mean-field ODE for the population density $u(t)$. It is a form of the logistic equation.\n\n**Part 2: Solution of the ODE for Specific Parameters**\n\nWe are given the parameters $\\beta = 1$, $\\delta = \\frac{1}{4}$, $\\gamma = \\frac{3}{4}$, and the initial condition $u(0) = \\frac{1}{14}$. All rates are in units of day$^{-1}$ and $t$ is in days.\n\nFirst, we substitute the parameter values into the derived ODE:\n$$\n\\beta - \\delta = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta + \\gamma = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\nThe ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{3}{4} u - \\frac{7}{4} u^2\n$$\nThis is a separable Bernoulli equation. We can factor out $\\frac{7}{4}u$ to get it into a standard logistic form:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{7}{4} u \\left(\\frac{3}{7} - u\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the carrying capacity is $K = \\frac{3}{7}$. We can solve this by separating variables. For $u \\ne 0$ and $u \\ne \\frac{3}{7}$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u(\\frac{3}{7} - u)} = \\frac{7}{4} dt\n$$\nWe use partial fraction decomposition for the left-hand side. Let:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{u(\\frac{3}{7} - u)} = \\frac{A}{u} + \\frac{B}{\\frac{3}{7} - u}\n$$\nMultiplying by the denominator gives $1 = A(\\frac{3}{7} - u) + B u$.\nSetting $u = 0$, we get $1 = A(\\frac{3}{7})$, so $A = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nSetting $u = \\frac{3}{7}$, we get $1 = B(\\frac{3}{7})$, so $B = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nThus, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int \\left( \\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{u} + \\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} \\right) du = \\int \\frac{7}{4} dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{7}{3} \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} \\right) du = \\frac{7}{4} t + C_1\n$$\nIntegrating term by term:\n$$\n\\frac{7}{3} \\left( \\ln|u| - \\ln\\left|\\frac{3}{7} - u\\right| \\right) = \\frac{7}{4} t + C_1\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left| \\frac{u}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} \\right| = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{7}{4} t + C_1 \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} t + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2 = \\frac{3}{7} C_1$. Exponentiating both sides:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{u}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} \\right| = \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t + C_2\\right) = C_3 \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_3 = \\exp(C_2)$. Since $u(t)$ is a density, $0 \\le u(t) \\le 1$. The initial condition $u(0) = \\frac{1}{14}$ is less than the carrying capacity $K = \\frac{3}{7}$, so $u(t)$ will remain in the interval $(0, \\frac{3}{7})$, and the argument of the absolute value will be positive. We can drop the absolute value signs and absorb the sign into a constant $C$.\n$$\n\\frac{u}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $u(0) = \\frac{1}{14}$ to find $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{14}}{\\frac{3}{7} - \\frac{1}{14}} = C \\exp(0) \\implies C = \\frac{\\frac{1}{14}}{\\frac{6}{14} - \\frac{1}{14}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{14}}{\\frac{5}{14}} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nSo, the implicit solution is:\n$$\n\\frac{u}{\\frac{3}{7} - u} = \\frac{1}{5} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\nNow we solve for $u(t)$:\n$$\n5u = \\left(\\frac{3}{7} - u\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\n$$\n5u = \\frac{3}{7} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right) - u \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu \\left(5 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\\right) = \\frac{3}{7} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu(t) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{7} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)}{5 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression and write it in a standard logistic function form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)$:\n$$\nu(t) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{7}}{5 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{4} t\\right) + 1}\n$$\nAlternatively, to eliminate the compound fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $7$:\n$$\nu(t) = \\frac{3}{7\\left(1 + 5 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{3}{7 + 35 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{4} t\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for $u(t)$.\nLet's verify the initial condition:\n$$\nu(0) = \\frac{3}{7 + 35 \\exp(0)} = \\frac{3}{7 + 35} = \\frac{3}{42} = \\frac{1}{14}\n$$\nThe initial condition is satisfied.\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{4} t\\right) \\to 0$, so $u(t) \\to \\frac{3}{7 + 0} = \\frac{3}{7}$, which is the carrying capacity, as expected.",
