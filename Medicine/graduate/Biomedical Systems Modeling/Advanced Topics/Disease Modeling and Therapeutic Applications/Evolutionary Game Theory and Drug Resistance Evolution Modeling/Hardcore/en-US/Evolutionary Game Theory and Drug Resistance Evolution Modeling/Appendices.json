It is a standard exercise in applying evolutionary game theory to a biological system. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivations\n\n#### 1. Derivation of the Replicator Equation\n\nLet $x$ be the frequency of the sensitive type ($S$) and $1-x$ be the frequency of the resistant type ($R$). Due to random mixing, the expected fitness (per-capita growth rate) for each type is a linear function of the frequencies of the types in the population.\n\nThe expected fitness of a sensitive cell, $f_S(x)$, is given by the payoff of interacting with an $S$ cell (payoff $a$) weighted by the probability of meeting an $S$ cell ($x$), plus the payoff of interacting with an $R$ cell (payoff $b$) weighted by the probability of meeting an $R$ cell ($1-x$):\n$$\nf_S(x) = a \\cdot x + b \\cdot (1-x)\n$$\nSimilarly, the expected fitness of a resistant cell, $f_R(x)$, is:\n$$\nf_R(x) = c \\cdot x + d \\cdot (1-x)\n$$\nThe average fitness of the entire population, $\\bar{f}(x)$, is the weighted average of the fitnesses of the two types:\n$$\n\\bar{f}(x) = x \\cdot f_S(x) + (1-x) \\cdot f_R(x)\n$$\nThe continuous-time replicator equation describes the rate of change of the frequency $x$ as being proportional to the difference between the fitness of type $S$ and the average fitness of the population:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\dot{x} = x (f_S(x) - \\bar{f}(x))\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{f}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = x (f_S(x) - [x f_S(x) + (1-x) f_R(x)])\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x} = x [ (1-x)f_S(x) - (1-x)f_R(x) ]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x} = x(1-x) [f_S(x) - f_R(x)]\n$$\nThis is the general form of the replicator equation for a two-strategy system. Now, we substitute the specific expressions for $f_S(x)$ and $f_R(x)$:\n$$\nf_S(x) - f_R(x) = [ax + b(1-x)] - [cx + d(1-x)]\n$$\n$$\nf_S(x) - f_R(x) = ax + b - bx - cx - d + dx\n$$\n$$\nf_S(x) - f_R(x) = (a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the replicator equation gives the final one-dimensional form:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = x(1-x) [(a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)]\n$$\n\n#### 2. Interior Mixed Fixed Point\n\nAn interior fixed point, $x^{\\ast}$, where $0  x^{\\ast}  1$, is a state of equilibrium where the frequencies do not change ($\\dot{x} = 0$). From the replicator equation, this occurs when $x=0$, $x=1$, or the term in the square brackets is zero. For an interior point, we must have:\n$$\n(a - b - c + d)x^{\\ast} + (b - d) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to setting the fitness of the two types equal, $f_S(x^{\\ast}) = f_R(x^{\\ast})$. Solving for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n(a - b - c + d)x^{\\ast} = d - b\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{d-b}{a-b-c+d} = \\frac{d-b}{(a-c)+(d-b)}\n$$\nTo check if such a fixed point exists in the interval $(0, 1)$, we substitute the given values: $a=0.88$, $b=0.70$, $c=0.93$, and $d=0.50$.\n$$\nd-b = 0.50 - 0.70 = -0.20\n$$\n$$\na-c = 0.88 - 0.93 = -0.05\n$$\n$$\na-b-c+d = (a-c) + (d-b) = -0.05 + (-0.20) = -0.25\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{-0.20}{-0.25} = \\frac{20}{25} = 0.8\n$$\nSince $0  0.8  1$, a unique interior fixed point exists at $x^{\\ast} = 0.8$.\n\n#### 3. Stability Analysis and ESS Test\n\nTo determine the stability of the fixed point $x^{\\ast}$, we perform a local stability analysis. We analyze the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side of the replicator equation, which we denote as $g(x) = \\dot{x}$, evaluated at $x^{\\ast}$. A negative derivative, $g'(x^{\\ast})  0$, implies local stability, while a positive derivative implies instability.\nLet $g(x) = x(1-x) [(a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)]$.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [ (x-x^2) ] \\cdot [(a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)] + (x-x^2) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} [(a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)]\n$$\n$$\ng'(x) = (1-2x)[(a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)] + (x-x^2)(a - b - c + d)\n$$\nBy definition of the interior fixed point $x^{\\ast}$, the term $[(a - b - c + d)x^{\\ast} + (b - d)]$ is equal to $0$. Therefore, the first term vanishes when we evaluate the derivative at $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\ng'(x^{\\ast}) = (1-2x^{\\ast}) \\cdot [0] + (x^{\\ast}-(x^{\\ast})^2)(a - b - c + d)\n$$\n$$\ng'(x^{\\ast}) = x^{\\ast}(1-x^{\\ast})(a - b - c + d)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $x^{\\ast}$ and the parameters:\n$$\ng'(x^{\\ast}) = (0.8)(1-0.8)(-0.25)\n$$\n$$\ng'(x^{\\ast}) = (0.8)(0.2)(-0.25) = (0.16)(-0.25) = -0.04\n$$\nThe Jacobian (derivative) at the interior fixed point is $g'(x^{\\ast}) = -0.04$.\nSince $g'(x^{\\ast})  0$, the interior fixed point is locally asymptotically stable.\nFor a symmetric $2 \\times 2$ game, a stable interior fixed point of the replicator dynamics is an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). The conditions for this game type (often called Hawk-Dove or coexistence) are $c  a$ (here, $0.93  0.88$) and $b  d$ (here, $0.70  0.50$), which are met. This means neither pure strategy is stable, and the population converges to the mixed equilibrium. Thus, the mixed strategy corresponding to the population state $x^{\\ast}$ is an ESS.\n\n#### 4. Biological Implications\n\n- **When the interior point is an ESS (Stable Coexistence):** As found in this problem ($g'(x^{\\ast})  0$), the system exhibits negative frequency-dependence that drives the population towards a stable coexistence of both sensitive ($S$) and resistant ($R$) cells. The proportion of sensitive cells will stabilize at $x^{\\ast} = 0.8$ ($80\\%$) and resistant cells at $1-x^{\\ast} = 0.2$ ($20\\%$). This represents a strategy of 'resistance containment'. The low-dose therapy does not eliminate the cancer, nor does it lead to complete treatment failure via fixation of resistance. Instead, it maintains a dynamic equilibrium where the cost of resistance (low fitness of $R$ vs $R$, $d=0.50$) balances its benefit (high fitness of $R$ vs $S$, $c=0.93$). Any deviation from this equilibrium is corrected by selection, preventing either cell type from taking over.\n\n- **When the interior point is not an ESS (Disruptive Selection):** If the payoff structure had been different such that $g'(x^{\\ast})  0$ (which occurs if $a  c$ and $d  b$), the interior point would be unstable. This scenario corresponds to disruptive selection. The fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ would act as a threshold. If the initial frequency of sensitive cells were above $x^{\\ast}$, the population would evolve towards complete sensitivity ($x=1$), and the treatment would be successful. If the frequency were below $x^{\\ast}$, the population would inevitably evolve towards complete resistance ($x=0$), leading to treatment failure. In this case, resistance containment is impossible, and the outcome is bistable, depending entirely on the initial composition of the tumor.\n\nThe final requested value is the numerical value of the Jacobian $g^{\\prime}(x^{\\ast})$ rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is exactly $-0.04$. To express this with four significant figures, it is written as $-0.04000$.",

This is the equal-payoff condition for an interior equilibrium:\n$$\n(A x^{\\ast})_1 = (A x^{\\ast})_2 = (A x^{\\ast})_3\n$$\nLet's write this out explicitly using the given matrix $A$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-2x_1 - x_2 - x_3 = (A x)_1 \\\\\n-x_1 - 2x_2 - x_3 = (A x)_2 \\\\\n-x_1 - x_2 - 2x_3 = (A x)_3\n\\end{align*}\nEquating $(A x)_1 = (A x)_2$:\n$$\n-2x_1 - x_2 - x_3 = -x_1 - 2x_2 - x_3\n$$\n$$\n-x_1 = -2x_2 \\implies x_1 = x_2\n$$\nEquating $(A x)_2 = (A x)_3$:\n$$\n-x_1 - 2x_2 - x_3 = -x_1 - x_2 - 2x_3\n$$\n$$\n-2x_2 = -x_2 - x_3 \\implies -x_2 = -x_3 \\implies x_2 = x_3\n$$\nThus, we must have $x_1 = x_2 = x_3$. Since the frequencies must sum to one, $\\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i = 1$, we have:\n$$\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 3x_1 = 1 \\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe unique interior fixed point is therefore:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation and Evaluation of the Jacobian Matrix $J(x^{\\ast})$**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(x)$ of the system has entries $J_{ij}(x) = \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Let $f_i(x) = (Ax)_i$ and $\\bar{f}(x) = x^{\\top}Ax$. Then $\\dot{x}_i = x_i(f_i(x) - \\bar{f}(x))$. Using the product rule:\n$$\nJ_{ij}(x) = \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\delta_{ij}(f_i(x) - \\bar{f}(x)) + x_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial f_i(x)}{\\partial x_j} - \\frac{\\partial \\bar{f}(x)}{\\partial x_j} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. At the interior fixed point $x^{\\ast}$, we know $f_i(x^{\\ast}) - \\bar{f}(x^{\\ast}) = 0$, so the first term vanishes. The Jacobian at $x^{\\ast}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nJ_{ij}(x^{\\ast}) = x_i^{\\ast} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}} - \\frac{\\partial \\bar{f}}{\\partial x_j}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}} \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the required partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\sum_k a_{ik} x_k = a_{ij}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{f}}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\sum_{k,l} x_k a_{kl} x_l = \\sum_l a_{jl} x_l + \\sum_k x_k a_{kj} = (Ax)_j + (x^{\\top}A)_j\n$$\nSince $A$ is symmetric ($A=A^{\\top}$), $(x^{\\top}A)_j = (Ax)_j$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{f}}{\\partial x_j} = 2(Ax)_j$.\nSubstituting these into the simplified Jacobian formula:\n$$\nJ_{ij}(x^{\\ast}) = x_i^{\\ast} \\left( a_{ij} - 2(A x^{\\ast})_j \\right)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the vector $A x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nA x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  -1  -1 \\\\ -1  -2  -1 \\\\ -1  -1  -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -2-1-1 \\\\ -1-2-1 \\\\ -1-1-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -4 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4/3 \\\\ -4/3 \\\\ -4/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $(A x^{\\ast})_j = -4/3$ for all $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Also, $x_i^{\\ast} = 1/3$ for all $i$. The Jacobian entries are:\n$$\nJ_{ij}(x^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( a_{ij} - 2(-\\frac{4}{3}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( a_{ij} + \\frac{8}{3} \\right)\n$$\nLet's compute the components of the matrix $J(x^{\\ast})$:\n$J_{11} = \\frac{1}{3}(-2 + \\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$\n$J_{12} = J_{13} = J_{21} = J_{31} = J_{23} = J_{32} = \\frac{1}{3}(-1 + \\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{5}{3}) = \\frac{5}{9}$\n$J_{22} = J_{33} = \\frac{1}{3}(-2 + \\frac{8}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$\nSo, the Jacobian matrix at the fixed point is:\n$$\nJ(x^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2/9  5/9  5/9 \\\\ 5/9  2/9  5/9 \\\\ 5/9  5/9  2/9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{9} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  5  5 \\\\ 5  2  5 \\\\ 5  5  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3. Eigenvalue Computation and Stability Analysis**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $J(x^{\\ast})$, we can analyze the structure of the matrix $M = 9 J(x^{\\ast})$.\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  5  5 \\\\ 5  2  5 \\\\ 5  5  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix can be written as $M = 5E - 3I$, where $E$ is the $3 \\times 3$ matrix of all ones and $I$ is the identity matrix.\nThe matrix $E$ has rank $1$, so it has two eigenvalues equal to $0$. The third eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector $(1,1,1)^{\\top}$, and is equal to the dimension of the matrix, $3$. So, the eigenvalues of $E$ are $\\lambda_E \\in \\{3, 0, 0\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $M = 5E - 3I$ are given by $5\\lambda_E - 3$.\nFor $\\lambda_E=3$, the eigenvalue of $M$ is $5(3) - 3 = 12$.\nFor $\\lambda_E=0$, the eigenvalue of $M$ is $5(0) - 3 = -3$. This eigenvalue has a multiplicity of $2$.\nThe eigenvalues of $M$ are therefore $\\{12, -3, -3\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $J(x^{\\ast}) = M/9$ are the eigenvalues of $M$ divided by $9$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\frac{-3}{9} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe three eigenvalues of $J(x^{\\ast})$ are $\\{ \\frac{4}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3} \\}$.\n\nFor stability analysis *on the simplex*, we consider perturbations within the tangent space of the simplex at $x^{\\ast}$. This tangent space is the set of vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^3 v_i = 0$.\nThe eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 4/3$ is $(1,1,1)^{\\top}$, which is orthogonal to the tangent space. This eigenvalue governs perturbations off the simplex and is not relevant for stability within it.\nThe eigenspace corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1/3$ is defined by $(M - (-3)I)v = (M+3I)v = 5Ev = 0$. This gives the equation $v_1+v_2+v_3 = 0$, which is precisely the definition of the tangent space.\nTherefore, the eigenvalues relevant for the stability of $x^{\\ast}$ restricted to the simplex are $\\{ -1/3, -1/3 \\}$. Since the real parts of these eigenvalues are all negative, the fixed point $x^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable on the unit simplex.\n\nThe problem requires the ordered triple of the three eigenvalues of $J(x^{\\ast})$ in increasing order.\nThe eigenvalues are $-\\frac{1}{3}$, $-\\frac{1}{3}$, and $\\frac{4}{3}$. Ordering them gives:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{3} \\right)\n$$\nThis result is presented as a row matrix.",
