In one dimension and with no body forces, the Cauchy momentum equation simplifies to the divergence of the stress tensor being zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the total stress $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(x)$ must be spatially uniform, i.e., equal to a constant, which we will denote as $C$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(x) = C\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the total stress, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{e}}(x) + \\sigma_{a}(x) = C\n$$\nUsing the linear elastic constitutive law $\\sigma_{\\text{e}}(x) = E \\varepsilon(x)$ and the small-strain definition $\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}$, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for the displacement $u(x)$:\n$$\nE \\frac{du}{dx} + \\sigma_{a}(x) = C\n$$\nRearranging for the displacement gradient (strain):\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( C - \\sigma_{a}(x) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the displacement field $u(x)$, we integrate this expression from $0$ to $x$.\n$$\nu(x) - u(0) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{1}{E} \\left( C - \\sigma_{a}(s) \\right) ds\n$$\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0) = 0$, we get:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{1}{E} \\int_{0}^{x} \\left( C - \\sigma_{a}(s) \\right) ds = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( C x - \\int_{0}^{x} \\sigma_{a}(s) ds \\right)\n$$\nTo determine the constant $C$, we apply the second boundary condition, $u(L) = 0$:\n$$\nu(L) = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( C L - \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma_{a}(s) ds \\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC L = \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma_{a}(s) ds \\implies C = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma_{a}(s) ds\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is the average total stress, which must be equal to the average active stress over the domain, as the net strain over the fixed domain must be zero.

We use the plane-wave ansatz for the perturbations, which means we can make the substitutions $\\partial_t \\to \\omega$, $\\partial_x \\to ik$, and $\\partial_{xx} \\to (ik)^2 = -k^2$.\n\n1.  **Linearize the Mechanical Equations:**\n    We start with the momentum balance in the overdamped limit ($\\rho=0$):\n    $$0 = \\partial_x \\sigma - \\xi v$$\n    Substituting the perturbed variables and subtracting the steady-state equation ($0 = \\partial_x \\sigma_0 - \\xi v_0$):\n    $$0 = \\partial_x(\\delta \\sigma) - \\xi (\\delta v)$$\n    The velocity perturbation is $\\delta v = \\partial_t (\\delta u)$, which becomes $\\delta v = \\omega (\\delta u)$.\n    $$ik (\\delta \\sigma) = \\xi \\omega (\\delta u)$$\n    Now, we express the stress perturbation $\\delta \\sigma$ in terms of $\\delta u$ and $\\delta c$.\n    The total stress is $\\sigma = E \\partial_x u - \\chi c$. The perturbation is:\n    $$\\delta \\sigma = E \\partial_x (\\delta u) - \\chi (\\delta c)$$\n    Applying the plane-wave substitution:\n    $$\\delta \\sigma = E (ik) (\\delta u) - \\chi (\\delta c)$$\n    Substitute this expression for $\\delta \\sigma$ into the linearized momentum balance:\n    $$ik (E(ik)(\\delta u) - \\chi(\\delta c)) = \\xi \\omega (\\delta u)$$\n    $$-E k^2 (\\delta u) - ik\\chi (\\delta c) = \\xi \\omega (\\delta u)$$\n    This equation algebraically couples the mechanical displacement perturbation $\\delta u$ to the concentration perturbation $\\delta c$. We rearrange to solve for $\\delta u$:\n    $$(\\xi \\omega + E k^2) (\\delta u) = - ik\\chi (\\delta c)$$\n    $$\\delta u = -\\frac{ik\\chi}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} (\\delta c)$$\n\n2.  **Linearize the Reaction-Diffusion Equation:**\n    The governing equation for the concentration is:\n    $$\\partial_t c = D \\partial_{xx} c + R(c, \\sigma)$$\n    We perform a first-order Taylor expansion of $R(c, \\sigma)$ around the steady state $(c_0, \\sigma_0)$:\n    $$R(c, \\sigma) \\approx R(c_0, \\sigma_0) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial c}\\right|_0 (c-c_0) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right|_0 (\\sigma-\\sigma_0)$$\n    $$R(c, \\sigma) \\approx R_0 + r(\\delta c) + s(\\delta \\sigma)$$\n    Since $R_0 = 0$, the linearized reaction-diffusion equation for the perturbations is:\n    $$\\partial_t (\\delta c) = D \\partial_{xx} (\\delta c) + r (\\delta c) + s (\\delta \\sigma)$$\n    Applying the plane-wave substitutions:\n    $$\\omega (\\delta c) = D(-k^2) (\\delta c) + r (\\delta c) + s (\\delta \\sigma)$$\n    Dividing by $\\delta c$ (which is non-trivial for a mode to exist):\n    $$\\omega = r - Dk^2 + s \\frac{\\delta \\sigma}{\\delta c}$$\n\n3.  **Eliminate Mechanical Variables to Find the Dispersion Relation:**\n    We need to find an expression for $\\delta \\sigma / \\delta c$. We use the expressions derived in step 1:\n    $$\\delta \\sigma = ikE (\\delta u) - \\chi (\\delta c)$$\n    $$\\delta u = -\\frac{ik\\chi}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} (\\delta c)$$\n    Substitute $\\delta u$ into the expression for $\\delta \\sigma$:\n    $$\\delta \\sigma = ikE \\left( -\\frac{ik\\chi}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} \\right) (\\delta c) - \\chi (\\delta c)$$\n    $$\\delta \\sigma = \\left( \\frac{-i^2 k^2 E \\chi}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} - \\chi \\right) (\\delta c) = \\left( \\frac{k^2 E \\chi}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} - \\chi \\right) (\\delta c)$$\n    $$\\frac{\\delta \\sigma}{\\delta c} = \\chi \\left( \\frac{E k^2}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} - 1 \\right) = \\chi \\left( \\frac{E k^2 - (\\xi \\omega + E k^2)}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2} \\right) = - \\frac{\\chi \\xi \\omega}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2}$$\n    Now, substitute this result into the equation for $\\omega$:\n    $$\\omega = r - Dk^2 - s \\frac{\\chi \\xi \\omega}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2}$$\n    This is the implicit dispersion relation. We must solve for $\\omega$.\n    $$\\omega - (r - Dk^2) = - \\frac{s \\chi \\xi \\omega}{\\xi \\omega + E k^2}$$\n    $$(\\omega - (r - Dk^2))(\\xi \\omega + E k^2) = -s \\chi \\xi \\omega$$\n    Expanding and rearranging this into a quadratic equation of the form $A\\omega^2 + B\\omega + C = 0$:\n    $$\\xi \\omega^2 + E k^2 \\omega - \\xi(r - Dk^2)\\omega - E k^2(r - Dk^2) = -s \\chi \\xi \\omega$$\n    $$\\xi \\omega^2 + [E k^2 - \\xi r + \\xi Dk^2 + s \\chi \\xi] \\omega - E k^2(r - Dk^2) = 0$$\n    Grouping coefficients for $k^2$ in the $B$ term:\n    $$A = \\xi$$\n    $$B = (\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)$$\n    $$C = E k^2(Dk^2 - r)$$\n    The quadratic equation for $\\omega$ is:\n    $$\\xi \\omega^2 + [(\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)] \\omega + E k^2(Dk^2 - r) = 0$$\n\n4.  **Solve the Quadratic Equation for $\\omega(k)$:**\n    Using the quadratic formula $\\omega = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$:\n    $$\\omega = \\frac{-[(\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)] \\pm \\sqrt{[(\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)]^2 - 4\\xi E k^2(Dk^2-r)}}{2\\xi}$$\n    The problem asks for the branch with the largest real part. For two real roots $\\omega_1, \\omega_2$, the larger root is given by the '+' sign. For complex conjugate roots, the real parts are identical. Therefore, we select the branch with the '+' sign to satisfy the condition.\n    The final expression for this branch is:\n    $$\\omega(k) = \\frac{-[(\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)] + \\sqrt{[(\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r)]^2 - 4\\xi E k^2(Dk^2-r)}}{2\\xi}$$",
            "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{ - \\left[ (\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r) \\right] + \\sqrt{ \\left[ (\\xi D + E)k^2 + \\xi(s\\chi - r) \\right]^2 - 4 \\xi E k^2 (D k^2 - r) } }{2\\xi} } $$"
