It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with all necessary species, reactions, and parameters defined. The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is structured into the four tasks requested.\n\n### 1. Construction of the Stoichiometric Matrix $\\mathbf{S}$\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ connects reaction rates to species dynamics. Its entry $\\mathbf{S}_{ij}$ represents the net change in the number of molecules of species $i$ due to a single occurrence of reaction $j$. The matrix will have $9$ rows, corresponding to the species $\\mathbf{x} = (E, E_{p}, E_{pp}, K, P, C_{1}, C_{2}, D_{1}, D_{2})^T$, and $12$ columns, corresponding to the ordered reactions in $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\nThe reactions are:\n$v_1: K + E \\xrightarrow{k_{1f}} C_{1}$\n$v_2: C_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{1r}} K + E$\n$v_3: C_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{1c}} K + E_{p}$\n$v_4: K + E_{p} \\xrightarrow{k_{2f}} C_{2}$\n$v_5: C_{2} \\xrightarrow{k_{2r}} K + E_{p}$\n$v_6: C_{2} \\xrightarrow{k_{2c}} K + E_{pp}$\n$v_7: P + E_{pp} \\xrightarrow{k_{3f}} D_{1}$\n$v_8: D_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{3r}} P + E_{pp}$\n$v_9: D_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{3c}} P + E_{p}$\n$v_{10}: P + E_{p} \\xrightarrow{k_{4f}} D_{2}$\n$v_{11}: D_{2} \\xrightarrow{k_{4r}} P + E_{p}$\n$v_{12}: D_{2} \\xrightarrow{k_{4c}} P + E$\n\nConstructing the matrix column by column based on the net change of each species:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n### 2. Mass-Action Reaction Rates $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$\n\nUnder the law of mass action, the rate of an elementary reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. The components of the reaction rate vector $\\mathbf{v}$ are:\n$v_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{1f} [K] [E] = k_{1f} x_{4} x_{1}$\n$v_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{1r} [C_{1}] = k_{1r} x_{6}$\n$v_{3}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{1c} [C_{1}] = k_{1c} x_{6}$\n$v_{4}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{2f} [K] [E_{p}] = k_{2f} x_{4} x_{2}$\n$v_{5}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{2r} [C_{2}] = k_{2r} x_{7}$\n$v_{6}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{2c} [C_{2}] = k_{2c} x_{7}$\n$v_{7}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{3f} [P] [E_{pp}] = k_{3f} x_{5} x_{3}$\n$v_{8}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{3r} [D_{1}] = k_{3r} x_{8}$\n$v_{9}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{3c} [D_{1}] = k_{3c} x_{8}$\n$v_{10}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{4f} [P] [E_{p}] = k_{4f} x_{5} x_{2}$\n$v_{11}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{4r} [D_{2}] = k_{4r} x_{9}$\n$v_{12}(\\mathbf{x}) = k_{4c} [D_{2}] = k_{4c} x_{9}$\n\n### 3. Ordinary Differential Equation System\n\nThe time evolution of the species concentration vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is given by the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{S}\\,\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$. Each component $\\dot{x}_{i}$ is the sum of the rates of reactions that produce species $i$ minus the sum of the rates of reactions that consume species $i$. Explicitly, this is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{S}$ with the vector $\\mathbf{v}$:\n\n$\\dot{x}_{1} = \\frac{d[E]}{dt} = -v_{1} + v_{2} + v_{12}$\n$\\dot{x}_{2} = \\frac{d[E_{p}]}{dt} = v_{3} - v_{4} + v_{5} + v_{9} - v_{10} + v_{11}$\n$\\dot{x}_{3} = \\frac{d[E_{pp}]}{dt} = v_{6} - v_{7} + v_{8}$\n$\\dot{x}_{4} = \\frac{d[K]}{dt} = -v_{1} + v_{2} + v_{3} - v_{4} + v_{5} + v_{6}$\n$\\dot{x}_{5} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -v_{7} + v_{8} + v_{9} - v_{10} + v_{11} + v_{12}$\n$\\dot{x}_{6} = \\frac{d[C_{1}]}{dt} = v_{1} - v_{2} - v_{3}$\n$\\dot{x}_{7} = \\frac{d[C_{2}]}{dt} = v_{4} - v_{5} - v_{6}$\n$\\dot{x}_{8} = \\frac{d[D_{1}]}{dt} = v_{7} - v_{8} - v_{9}$\n$\\dot{x}_{9} = \\frac{d[D_{2}]}{dt} = v_{10} - v_{11} - v_{12}$\n\n### 4. Rank of the Stoichiometric Matrix $\\mathbf{S}$\n\nThe rank of the stoichiometric matrix, $\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{S})$, determines the number of linearly independent dynamic variables in the system. It can be found by determining the number of linearly independent rows or columns. The number of linearly independent rows is $m - \\text{dim}(\\text{N}(\\mathbf{S}^T))$, where $m=9$ is the number of species and $\\text{N}(\\mathbf{S}^T)$ is the left null space, corresponding to conservation laws.\n\n**Analysis of Row Dependencies (Conservation Laws):**\nThe rows of $\\mathbf{S}$ are not linearly independent because of moiety conservation laws. A linear combination of rows that sums to the zero vector indicates a conserved quantity.\nLet $\\mathbf{r}_i$ be the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{S}$.\n\n1.  **Total ERK conservation**: The total amount of substrate ERK, in all its forms, is conserved.\n    $[E]_{\\text{tot}} = [E] + [E_p] + [E_{pp}] + [C_1] + [C_2] + [D_1] + [D_2] = x_1+x_2+x_3+x_6+x_7+x_8+x_9$.\n    The time derivative of this sum is zero: $\\sum_{i \\in \\{1,2,3,6,7,8,9\\}} \\dot{x}_i = 0$.\n    This implies a linear dependency among the rows: $\\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{r}_2 + \\mathbf{r}_3 + \\mathbf{r}_6 + \\mathbf{r}_7 + \\mathbf{r}_8 + \\mathbf{r}_9 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n2.  **Total kinase conservation**: The total amount of kinase MEK is conserved.\n    $[K]_{\\text{tot}} = [K] + [C_1] + [C_2] = x_4+x_6+x_7$.\n    The time derivative is zero: $\\dot{x}_4 + \\dot{x}_6 + \\dot{x}_7 = 0$.\n    This implies a second row dependency: $\\mathbf{r}_4 + \\mathbf{r}_6 + \\mathbf{r}_7 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n3.  **Total phosphatase conservation**: The total amount of phosphatase is conserved.\n    $[P]_{\\text{tot}} = [P] + [D_1] + [D_2] = x_5+x_8+x_9$.\n    The time derivative is zero: $\\dot{x}_5 + \\dot{x}_8 + \\dot{x}_9 = 0$.\n    This implies a third row dependency: $\\mathbf{r}_5 + \\mathbf{r}_8 + \\mathbf{r}_9 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThese three conservation laws give rise to three linearly independent vectors in the left null space of $\\mathbf{S}$. The existence of at least $3$ linear dependencies among the $9$ rows implies that the rank of $\\mathbf{S}$ is at most $9 - 3 = 6$. A more detailed analysis confirms there are no further dependencies, so we can conclude that the rank is exactly $6$. This means the dynamics of the $9$ species can be described by a system of $6$ independent differential equations, with the remaining $3$ species concentrations determined by the conservation laws.",

Steady State and Linear Noise Approximation (LNA)\n\nThe deterministic rate equation for the mean number of molecules, $n$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\nu_{1}(n) - \\nu_{2}(n) = k_f (N_{\\text{tot}} - n) - \\beta n\n$$\nThe steady-state molecule number, $n^{\\ast}$, is found by setting $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\nk_f (N_{\\text{tot}} - n^{\\ast}) = \\beta n^{\\ast} \\implies n^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + \\beta} N_{\\text{tot}}\n$$\nThe Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) describes the dynamics of the fluctuation $\\eta(t) = n(t) - n^{\\ast}$ with a linear Langevin equation of the form $\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = J \\eta + \\sqrt{D} \\Gamma(t)$, where $\\Gamma(t)$ is Gaussian white noise.\n\nThe Jacobian term $J$ is the derivative of the net rate evaluated at the steady state:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left[ k_f(N_{\\text{tot}} - n) - \\beta n \\right]_{n=n^{\\ast}} = -k_f - \\beta\n$$\nThe diffusion term $D$ is the sum of the propensities at steady state:\n$$\nD = \\nu_{1}(n^{\\ast}) + \\nu_{2}(n^{\\ast}) = 2 \\nu_{1}(n^{\\ast}) = 2k_f (N_{\\text{tot}} - n^{\\ast}) = 2k_f \\left(N_{\\text{tot}} - \\frac{k_f N_{\\text{tot}}}{k_f + \\beta}\\right) = \\frac{2 k_f \\beta}{k_f + \\beta} N_{\\text{tot}}\n$$\nSo, the LNA for $\\eta(t)$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = -(k_f + \\beta)\\eta(t) + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_f \\beta N_{\\text{tot}}}{k_f + \\beta}} \\Gamma(t)\n$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Power Spectral Density (PSD)\n\nThe two-sided PSD, $S_n(\\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of the stationary autocovariance function $C_{\\eta}(\\tau)$. For an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with decay rate $a = -(J) = k_f + \\beta$ and noise strength $D$, the PSD is given by the Lorentzian function:\n$$\nS_n(\\omega) = \\frac{D}{a^2 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{D}{(k_f + \\beta)^2 + \\omega^2}\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $D$ and $a$:\n$$\nS_{n}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_f \\beta N_{\\text{tot}} / (k_f + \\beta)}{(k_f + \\beta)^2 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{2 k_f \\beta N_{\\text{tot}}}{(k_f + \\beta) \\left( \\omega^2 + (k_f + \\beta)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nThis is the PSD for the fluctuations in molecule number.\n\n### 3. Conversion to Concentration Units and Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe problem asks for the PSD of concentration fluctuations, $S_x(\\omega)$. A concentration fluctuation $x(t)$ in nM is related to a molecule number fluctuation $\\eta(t)$ via the conversion factor $N_{\\text{nM}}$, the number of molecules per nanomolar: $x(t) = \\eta(t) / N_{\\text{nM}}$. The PSD scales quadratically with this conversion:\n$$\nS_x(\\omega) = \\frac{S_{n}(\\omega)}{N_{\\text{nM}}^2}\n$$\nWe also express the total molecule number $N_{\\text{tot}}$ in terms of the total concentration $E_{\\text{tot}}$ (in nM): $N_{\\text{tot}} = E_{\\text{tot}} \\times N_{\\text{nM}}$. Substituting these into the expression for $S_x(\\omega)$:\n$$\nS_x(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{nM}}^2} \\frac{2 k_f \\beta (E_{\\text{tot}} N_{\\text{nM}})}{(k_f + \\beta) \\left( \\omega^2 + (k_f + \\beta)^2 \\right)} = \\frac{2 k_f \\beta E_{\\text{tot}}}{N_{\\text{nM}} (k_f + \\beta) \\left( \\omega^2 + (k_f + \\beta)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values:\n- $k_f = 0.05\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\beta = 0.03\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $E_{\\text{tot}} = 100\\,\\text{nM}$\n- $\\omega_0 = 0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $N_{\\text{nM}} = N_{A} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{mol/L} \\times V = (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-9}\\,\\text{mol/L}) \\times (10^{-12}\\,\\text{L}) = 602.2$\n\nLet's compute the terms in the formula:\n- $k_f + \\beta = 0.05 + 0.03 = 0.08\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\omega_0^2 + (k_f + \\beta)^2 = (0.2)^2 + (0.08)^2 = 0.04 + 0.0064 = 0.0464\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $S_{x}(\\omega_{0})$:\n$$\nS_x(\\omega_0) = \\frac{2 \\times (0.05) \\times (0.03) \\times 100}{602.2 \\times (0.08) \\times (0.0464)}\n$$\n$$\nS_x(\\omega_0) = \\frac{0.3}{602.2 \\times 0.003712} = \\frac{0.3}{2.2354624} \\approx 0.1342052\\,\\text{nM}^2\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1342$.",
