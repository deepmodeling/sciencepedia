The use of the grand canonical ensemble, statistical weights (Boltzmann factors), and partition functions is standard practice in this field.

The steps are logical and lead to a unique, meaningful answer.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires us to apply the principles of statistical mechanics to a simple model of gene regulation. The probability of the system being in a particular microstate $i$ is given by the ratio of its statistical weight $w_i$ to the partition function $Z$, which is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates.\n$$P_i = \\frac{w_i}{Z}$$\n\nFirst, we consider the system in the presence of the repressor. The possible microstates are empty, RNAP-bound, and repressor-bound. The statistical weights are given as $1$, $p$, and $r$, respectively. The partition function, $Z_{with\\_R}$, is the sum of these weights:\n$$Z_{with\\_R} = 1 + p + r$$\nThe probability that RNAP is bound to the promoter, which we denote as $P(RNAP | with\\_R)$, is the weight of the RNAP-bound state divided by this partition function:\n$$P(RNAP | with\\_R) = \\frac{p}{1 + p + r}$$\n\nNext, we consider the system in the absence of the repressor. The absence of the repressor corresponds to its concentration being zero, $[R]=0$. This implies that the dimensionless parameter $r \\equiv [R]/K_R$ is also zero: $r=0$. In this case, the repressor-bound state is not accessible. The possible microstates are only empty and RNAP-bound. The partition function, $Z_{without\\_R}$, is:\n$$Z_{without\\_R} = 1 + p$$\nAlternatively, one can obtain this by setting $r=0$ in the general partition function $Z_{with\\_R}$. The probability that RNAP is bound in the absence of the repressor, $P(RNAP | without\\_R)$, is then:\n$$P(RNAP | without\\_R) = \\frac{p}{1 + p}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fold-change, $f$, using its definition as the ratio of these two probabilities:\n$$f = \\frac{P(RNAP | with\\_R)}{P(RNAP | without\\_R)} = \\frac{\\frac{p}{1 + p + r}}{\\frac{p}{1 + p}}$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling the common factor $p$ and inverting the denominator gives:\n$$f = \\frac{1 + p}{1 + p + r}$$\nThis is the expression for the fold-change as a function of $p$ and $r$.\n\nThe final step is to enforce the half-maximal repression condition, which is stated as $f = 0.5$, or $f = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set our derived expression for $f$ equal to this value and solve for $r$.\n$$\\frac{1 + p}{1 + p + r} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo solve for $r$, we can cross-multiply:\n$$2(1 + p) = 1(1 + p + r)$$\n$$2 + 2p = 1 + p + r$$\nNow, we isolate $r$ by subtracting $(1+p)$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$r = (2 + 2p) - (1 + p)$$\n$$r = 2 - 1 + 2p - p$$\n$$r = 1 + p$$\nThus, for the fold-change to be exactly $0.5$, the dimensionless concentration of the repressor, $r$, must be equal to $1 + p$.",

To find $f(R)$, we first need $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}(0)$, which is the probability of RNAP binding in the absence of repressors ($R=0$). When $R=0$, the repressor statistical weight $w_R$ is $0$. Therefore:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}}(0) = \\frac{w_P}{1 + w_P + 0} = \\frac{w_P}{1 + w_P}$$\n\nNow, we can express the fold-change $f(R)$:\n$$f(R) = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{bound}}(R)}{p_{\\mathrm{bound}}(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{w_P}{1 + w_P + w_R}}{\\frac{w_P}{1 + w_P}} = \\frac{1 + w_P}{1 + w_P + w_R}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to work in the weak promoter limit, which is defined by the condition $w_P \\ll 1$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a three-part derivation concerning a simple repression model of gene regulation. First, we must derive the theoretical fold-change in gene expression. Second, we must formulate the likelihood function for the model parameters given experimental data. Third, we must derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the unknown parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Theoretical Fold-Change\n\nThe system consists of a single specific binding site for a repressor (the operator) and $N_{\\mathrm{NS}}$ nonspecific binding sites on the DNA. There are $R$ repressor molecules in the cell. The binding energy of a repressor to the specific site, relative to a nonspecific site, is $\\epsilon_{R}$. The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature $T_j$, corresponding to an inverse temperature parameter $\\beta_j = 1/(k_B T_j)$.\n\nThe fold-change, $f_j$, is the ratio of the mean gene expression in the presence of the repressor to the mean expression in its absence. Gene expression is assumed to be proportional to the probability that the promoter (and its associated operator site) is not occupied by a repressor, thus allowing RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. In the absence of the repressor, the promoter is always free, so the expression is at its maximum. Therefore, the fold-change is equal to the probability that the operator site is unoccupied, $p_{\\text{free}}$.\n\n$$f_j = p_{\\text{free}}$$\n\nTo find $p_{\\text{free}}$, we use the principles of statistical mechanics. We consider the statistical weights of the two possible states of the operator: bound by a repressor or free. The probability of the site being in a particular state is proportional to the Boltzmann weight of that state.\n\nLet's determine the ratio of the probability of the operator being bound, $p_{\\text{bound}}$, to the probability of it being free, $p_{\\text{free}}$.\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}}{p_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{bound}}}{W_{\\text{free}}} $$\nwhere $W_{\\text{bound}}$ and $W_{\\text{free}}$ are the statistical weights of the bound and free states of the operator, respectively.\n\nWe can set the weight of the free state as our reference: $W_{\\text{free}} = 1$.\n\nThe weight of the bound state, $W_{\\text{bound}}$, is the product of the number of repressors available to bind and the Boltzmann factor associated with the binding energy. A standard simplification in this model is to assume that all $R$ repressors are distributed somewhere on the DNA, either at the single specific site or among the $N_{\\mathrm{NS}}$ nonspecific sites. The effective concentration of repressors available to bind to the specific site is determined by the number of repressors per nonspecific site, which is $\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}$. The Boltzmann factor for a repressor moving from a nonspecific site to the specific site is $\\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})$, since $\\epsilon_{R}$ is the energy difference.\n\nThus, the statistical weight of the bound state is:\n$$ W_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nThe ratio of probabilities is then:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}}{p_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nSince $p_{\\text{bound}} + p_{\\text{free}} = 1$, we can write $p_{\\text{bound}} = 1 - p_{\\text{free}}$.

The transformed variable $y_j = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_j}{x_j}\\right)$ is a normally distributed random variable with a known variance $s^2$ and a mean $\\mu_j$ that depends on the theoretical fold-change $f_j$.\n\nThe mean $\\mu_j$ is given by the logarithm of the theoretically corresponding quantity, $\\frac{1-f_j}{f_j}$. Let's calculate this theoretical quantity from our derived expression for $f_j$.\n$$ \\frac{1 - f_j}{f_j} = \\frac{1}{f_j} - 1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})\\right) - 1 = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nThe mean of $y_j$ is thus:\n$$ \\mu_j = E[y_j] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-f_j}{f_j}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) - \\beta_j \\epsilon_{R} $$\n\nThe model for the observed data points $y_j$ is:\n$$ y_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_j, s^2) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mu_j = \\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) - \\epsilon_{R}\\beta_j $$\nEach $y_j$ is drawn independently.

This is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood function, $\\ell = \\ln L$:\n$$ \\ell(\\epsilon_R, R) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(2\\pi s^2) - \\frac{1}{2s^2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_j}{x_j}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) + \\beta_j \\epsilon_R \\right)^2 $$\n\nMaximizing $\\ell$ is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(\\epsilon_R, R)$:\n$$ S(\\epsilon_R, R) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_j}{x_j}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) + \\beta_j \\epsilon_R \\right)^2 $$\n\nLet us define $y_j = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)$. The model for the mean of $y_j$ is linear in $\\beta_j$:\n$$ y_j = (\\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})) - \\epsilon_R \\beta_j + \\text{error}_j $$\nThis is a standard linear regression problem of the form $y_j = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\beta_j$, with parameters:\n$$ \\theta_0 = \\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) $$\n$$ \\theta_1 = -\\epsilon_R $$\n\nThe least squares estimates for $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ minimize $S = \\sum_{j=1}^n (y_j - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 \\beta_j)^2$. The solution is given by the normal equations of linear regression. Let $\\hat{\\theta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_1$ be the estimators.\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j - (\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\bar{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j - \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right) $$\nA more direct expression for $\\hat{\\theta}_0$ from the matrix solution of the normal equations is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2) - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\n\nNow, we solve for the estimators $\\hat{\\epsilon}_R$ and $\\hat{R}$.\nFrom $\\hat{\\theta}_1 = -\\hat{\\epsilon}_R$, we get the estimator for $\\epsilon_R$:\n$$ \\hat{\\epsilon}_R = -\\hat{\\theta}_1 = -\\frac{n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j - (\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} = \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j) - n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\nSubstituting back $y_j = \\ln(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j})$:\n$$ \\hat{\\epsilon}_R = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k\\right) - n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)^2} $$\n\nFrom $\\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\ln(\\hat{R}) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})$, we get the estimator for $R$:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{R}) = \\hat{\\theta}_0 + \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) $$\n$$ \\hat{R} = \\exp(\\hat{\\theta}_0 + \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})) = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp(\\hat{\\theta}_0) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{\\theta}_0$:\n$$ \\hat{R} = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp\\left( \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2) - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} \\right) $$\nSubstituting back $y_j = \\ln(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j})$:\n$$ \\hat{R} = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_k}{x_k}\\right)\\right)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)^2} \\right) $$\nThese are the final closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimators.
