To understand the core mechanism of these relaxation oscillations, we can use the tools of fast-slow dynamical systems. This first practice invites you to deconstruct a minimal model of calcium dynamics to reveal its fundamental geometric structure, the critical manifold, and to locate the special fold points that trigger the dramatic jumps between low and high calcium states .",

            "problem": "Consider a dimensionless fast–slow model for cytosolic calcium concentration in a cell, where the fast variable is the scaled cytosolic calcium concentration $c$ and the slow variable is the scaled endoplasmic reticulum store content $s$. The governing equations are\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = f(c,s) = \\theta s - \\sigma c + \\rho c^{3},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\varepsilon\\, g(c,s) = \\varepsilon\\left(\\eta - \\xi c - \\zeta s\\right),\n$$\nwith parameters $\\theta0$, $\\sigma0$, $\\rho0$, $\\eta0$, $\\xi0$, $\\zeta0$, and a timescale separation parameter $0\\varepsilon\\ll 1$. The cubic nonlinearity in the fast flux $f(c,s)$ approximates calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), and the slow flux $g(c,s)$ accounts for store refilling and leak. These equations are based on conservation of mass and the standard assumption that cytosolic calcium equilibrates rapidly relative to store dynamics in calcium signaling models.\n\nUsing the fast–slow structure and a quasi-steady-state approximation for the fast variable $c$, determine the slow flow on the critical manifold defined by $f(c,s)=0$ by expressing the reduced slow evolution of $c$ in terms of $c$ alone. Then, locate the fold points at which the sensitivity of the fast dynamics with respect to $c$ vanishes, that is, where $\\partial f/\\partial c = 0$. Briefly explain the role of these fold points in triggering jumps in relaxation oscillations, grounding your argument in the fast–slow decomposition and loss of normal hyperbolicity.\n\nReport the positive fold location $c_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ as your final answer. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is necessary. Since the variables and parameters are dimensionless by construction, no physical unit specification is required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The provided problem describes a fast-slow dynamical system, a common structure in models of excitable biological systems like neural firing or calcium oscillations. The system is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = f(c,s) = \\theta s - \\sigma c + \\rho c^{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\varepsilon g(c,s) = \\varepsilon\\left(\\eta - \\xi c - \\zeta s\\right) $$\nThe parameter $\\varepsilon$ is small, $0  \\varepsilon \\ll 1$, which establishes a separation of timescales. The variable $c$ is the fast variable, while $s$ is the slow variable. The analysis proceeds by exploiting this timescale separation.\n\nFirst, we identify the critical manifold, which is the set of points in the phase space where the fast dynamics are at equilibrium. This is found by setting the fast equation to zero, $\\frac{dc}{dt} = f(c,s) = 0$. This manifold, denoted $C_0$, is the nullcline of the fast variable $c$.\n$$ f(c,s) = \\theta s - \\sigma c + \\rho c^{3} = 0 $$\nSolving for the slow variable $s$ gives the equation of the critical manifold as a function of $c$:\n$$ s = s(c) = \\frac{\\sigma c - \\rho c^3}{\\theta} $$\nThis is a cubic curve in the $(c, s)$ phase plane. Because $\\varepsilon$ is small, trajectories of the system away from this manifold move rapidly, almost horizontally (since $\\frac{ds}{dt}$ is of order $\\varepsilon$), towards $C_0$. Once near $C_0$, the trajectory evolves slowly along it.\n\nTo determine the slow flow on the critical manifold, we derive a single differential equation describing the evolution of $c$ (or $s$) constrained to $C_0$. The problem asks for the evolution of $c$. We differentiate the manifold equation $s=s(c)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma c - \\rho c^3}{\\theta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma - 3\\rho c^2}{\\theta}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dt} $$\nWe can now substitute the expression for $\\frac{ds}{dt}$ from the original slow dynamics equation:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\varepsilon \\left(\\eta - \\xi c - \\zeta s\\right) $$\nTo express this entirely in terms of $c$, we substitute $s = s(c)$ into the right-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\varepsilon \\left(\\eta - \\xi c - \\zeta \\left(\\frac{\\sigma c - \\rho c^3}{\\theta}\\right)\\right) $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{ds}{dt}$ yields:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma - 3\\rho c^2}{\\theta}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dt} = \\varepsilon \\left(\\eta - \\xi c - \\frac{\\zeta\\sigma}{\\theta}c + \\frac{\\zeta\\rho}{\\theta}c^3\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\frac{dc}{dt}$ gives the reduced equation for the slow flow on the manifold, projected onto the $c$-axis:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = \\varepsilon \\frac{\\theta\\eta - (\\theta\\xi + \\zeta\\sigma) c + \\zeta\\rho c^3}{\\sigma - 3\\rho c^2} $$\nThis equation governs the slow drift of the system along the critical manifold.\n\nThe fold points of the critical manifold are locations where the manifold becomes vertical with respect to the $s$-axis, or equivalently, horizontal with respect to the $c$-axis. These are points where the stability of the manifold with respect to the fast dynamics changes. The stability is determined by the sign of the partial derivative of the fast flux $f(c,s)$ with respect to the fast variable $c$. The manifold is locally attracting (stable) where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}  0$ and repelling (unstable) where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}  0$. At the fold points, this derivative is zero, indicating a loss of normal hyperbolicity.\nWe compute this partial derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} (\\theta s - \\sigma c + \\rho c^{3}) = 3\\rho c^2 - \\sigma $$\nSetting this to zero to find the fold points:\n$$ 3\\rho c^2 - \\sigma = 0 $$\n$$ 3\\rho c^2 = \\sigma $$\n$$ c^2 = \\frac{\\sigma}{3\\rho} $$\nThis gives two solutions for $c$:\n$$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{3\\rho}} $$\nThese are the $c$-coordinates of the fold points. The problem requests the positive fold location, which we denote $c_{\\mathrm{fold}}$.\n$$ c_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{3\\rho}} $$\nThe existence of this real, positive value is guaranteed as the parameters $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$ are given as positive.\n\nThe role of these fold points is central to the generation of relaxation oscillations. The critical manifold $C_0$ has an S-shape, with two outer branches where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}  0$ (stable) and a middle branch where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}  0$ (unstable). The fold points are the \"knees\" of the S-curve, connecting the stable and unstable branches. A trajectory starting on a stable branch evolves slowly according to the reduced slow flow. When it reaches a fold point, the stable manifold along which it was traveling ceases to exist. The system can no longer remain in the quasi-steady state. The denominator of the reduced equation for $\\frac{dc}{dt}$, which is proportional to $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}$, goes to zero, signaling a breakdown of the slow flow approximation. The fast dynamics, $\\frac{dc}{dt} = f(c,s)$, take over and cause a rapid jump in the value of $c$ (at nearly constant $s$) until the trajectory reaches the other stable branch of the critical manifold. The slow evolution then resumes, but in the opposite direction, until the other fold point is reached, triggering another jump back. This cyclic process of slow drift followed by fast jumps constitutes a relaxation oscillation, and the fold points serve as the triggers for the rapid transitions.",

We linearize the reaction system by computing its Jacobian matrix, $J_R$, evaluated at the steady state $(c^\\ast, b^\\ast)$. The free buffer concentration at steady state is $f^\\ast = B_T - b^\\ast$.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial c} = -k_{\\mathrm{on}}(B_T - b) = -k_{\\mathrm{on}}f\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial b} = -k_{\\mathrm{on}}c(-1) + k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nSince $R_b = -R_c$, we have $\\frac{\\partial R_b}{\\partial c} = -\\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial c} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}f$ and $\\frac{\\partial R_b}{\\partial b} = -\\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial b} = -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}})$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J_R$ is:\n$$\nJ_R = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial c}  \\frac{\\partial R_c}{\\partial b} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial R_b}{\\partial c}  \\frac{\\partial R_b}{\\partial b} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_{\\mathrm{on}}f  k_{\\mathrm{on}}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{on}}f  -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating at the steady state $(c^\\ast, b^\\ast)$ where $f=f^\\ast$:\n$$\nJ_R^\\ast = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast  k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast  -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J_R^\\ast$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(J_R^\\ast - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast - \\lambda  k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast  -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast - \\lambda)(- (k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) - \\lambda) - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast)(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0\n$$\nExpanding this gives:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + \\lambda(k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) + k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) - k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + \\lambda(k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\lambda + (k_{\\mathrm{on}}(c^\\ast + f^\\ast) + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}(c^\\ast + f^\\ast) + k_{\\mathrm{off}})$. The zero eigenvalue reflects the conservation of total substance in the reaction subsystem (for every mole of free calcium that binds, one mole of bound buffer is created). The other eigenvalue is negative, representing the exponential relaxation to equilibrium.\n\nThe problem defines $k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ as the magnitude of the most negative eigenvalue. Thus:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{fast}} = |\\lambda_2| = k_{\\mathrm{on}}(c^\\ast + f^\\ast) + k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Stability Constraint $\\Delta t_{\\max}$**\n\nWe analyze the stability of the Forward Euler scheme applied to the linearized system. Let $\\delta c = c - c^\\ast$ and $\\delta b = b - b^\\ast$. The linearized PDE system is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta c \\\\ \\delta b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} D_c \\nabla^2  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta c \\\\ \\delta b \\end{pmatrix} + J_R^\\ast \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta c \\\\ \\delta b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe perform a von Neumann stability analysis by considering a single Fourier mode $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k}(t) e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}}$. For this mode, the continuous Laplacian $\\nabla^2$ acts as multiplication by $-|\\mathbf{k}|^2$. The second-order central-difference discrete Laplacian, $\\nabla_h^2$, acts on this mode as multiplication by its eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{2 \\cos(k_j \\Delta x_j) - 2}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} = -\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{4}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_j \\Delta x_j}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe ODE system for the amplitude $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k}$ of the mode with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k} = M_{\\mathbf{k},h} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k}\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\mathbf{k},h}$ is the matrix for the semi-discretized system:\n$$\nM_{\\mathbf{k},h} = \\begin{pmatrix} D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k}  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + J_R^\\ast = \\begin{pmatrix} D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} - k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast  k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast  -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Forward Euler update for this mode is $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k}^{n+1} = (I + \\Delta t M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_\\mathbf{k}^n$. For linear stability, the spectral radius of the amplification matrix $G_\\mathbf{k} = I + \\Delta t M_{\\mathbf{k},h}$ must be less than or equal to $1$ for all wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$.\nIf $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $M_{\\mathbf{k},h}$, then $1 + \\Delta t \\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $G_\\mathbf{k}$. The stability condition is $|1 + \\Delta t \\mu| \\le 1$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. A sufficient condition for stability can be found by bounding the spectral radius $\\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h})$. If all eigenvalues of $M_{\\mathbf{k},h}$ are real and non-positive (which we can prove but is not strictly necessary for this argument), the condition simplifies to $\\Delta t \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le 2$. A more general approach uses matrix norms. For any induced matrix norm, $\\rho(A) \\le \\|A\\|$. We need to satisfy $\\Delta t \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le 2$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$. A sufficient condition is obtained by bounding the maximum spectral radius over all $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\left( \\max_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\right) \\le 2 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\max_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h})}\n$$\nWe can bound the spectral radius using the infinity norm, $\\|A\\|_\\infty$, which is the maximum absolute row sum.\n$$\n\\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) = \\rho(M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le \\|M_{\\mathbf{k},h}\\|_\\infty\n$$\nLet's compute the absolute row sums of $M_{\\mathbf{k},h}$. All parameters ($D_c, k_{\\mathrm{on}}, k_{\\mathrm{off}}, c^\\ast, f^\\ast$) are non-negative, and $\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} \\le 0$.\nRow 1 sum:\n$$\nS_1 = |D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} - k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast| + |k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}| = (-D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast) + (k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) = -D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}(c^\\ast + f^\\ast) + k_{\\mathrm{off}} = -D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}\n$$\nRow 2 sum:\n$$\nS_2 = |k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast| + |-(k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}})| = k_{\\mathrm{on}}f^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}c^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{fast}}\n$$\nThe infinity norm is the maximum of these two sums:\n$$\n\\|M_{\\mathbf{k},h}\\|_\\infty = \\max(S_1, S_2) = \\max(-D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}, k_{\\mathrm{fast}})\n$$\nSince $-D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} \\ge 0$, the maximum is always $-D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$.\nSo, $\\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le -D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$.\n\nTo get a stability constraint valid for all modes, we must take the maximum value of this bound over all $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$\n\\max_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le \\max_{\\mathbf{k}}(-D_c \\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}) = D_c (\\max_{\\mathbf{k}}(-\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k})) + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}\n$$\nWe need to find the maximum value of $-\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k}$.\n$$\n-\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{4}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_j \\Delta x_j}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\cdot)$ is $1$. This maximum is attained for high-frequency modes (e.g., $k_j = \\pi/\\Delta x_j$). Therefore, the maximum value of $-\\Lambda_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is:\n$$\n\\max_{\\mathbf{k}}(-\\Lambda_\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{4}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} = 4 \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x_j)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our bound for the spectral radius gives:\n$$\n\\max_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h}) \\le 4 D_c \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}}\n$$\nA sufficient condition for stability is therefore obtained by replacing $\\max_\\mathbf{k} \\rho(-M_{\\mathbf{k},h})$ with its upper bound in the stability inequality:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\left( 4 D_c \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x_j)^2} + k_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\right) \\le 2\n$$\nThe largest allowable time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ under this sufficient constraint is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{k_{\\mathrm{fast}} + 4 D_c \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x_j)^2}}\n$$\nThis expression provides a sufficient condition for stability by ensuring that the time step is small enough to resolve the fastest dynamics in the system, which are determined by both the chemical reactions (governed by $k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$) and diffusion across the smallest grid spacing (governed by $D_c / (\\min(\\Delta x_j))^2$).",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{k_{\\mathrm{fast}} + 4 D_c \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x_j)^2}}}$$"
