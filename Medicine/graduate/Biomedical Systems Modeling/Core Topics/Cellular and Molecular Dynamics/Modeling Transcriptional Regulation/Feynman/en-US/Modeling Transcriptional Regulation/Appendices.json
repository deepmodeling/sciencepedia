This exercise  guides you through building such a function from the first principles of statistical thermodynamics, accounting for key molecular events like activator binding and cooperative recruitment of RNA polymerase. By recasting the final expression in a dimensionless form, you will practice a powerful technique that reveals the essential parameter combinations governing the system's behavior, independent of specific units.",

            "problem": "A promoter is regulated by a single transcriptional activator whose binding increases the probability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) loading. Assume the following quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic model for promoter states, which is widely used in modeling transcriptional regulation:\n\n- The promoter has $4$ mutually exclusive states: empty, activator-bound only, RNAP-bound only, and activator-RNAP co-bound.\n- The activator binds as an oligomer of size $n$ to a single site with dissociation constant $K_d$, so that the thermodynamic weight for activator occupancy is proportional to $(c/K_d)^{n}$, where $c$ is the free activator concentration.\n- RNAP binds with an effective dimensionless weight $p$, which combines the RNAP concentration and its dissociation constant for the promoter.\n- When the activator and RNAP are simultaneously bound, there is a stabilizing interaction parameterized by a dimensionless cooperativity factor $\\omega$, which multiplies the weight of the co-bound state.\n- Transcription occurs only when RNAP is bound, with initiation rate $r$. Messenger RNA is degraded/diluted with first-order rate $\\gamma$, yielding a steady-state activity $f(c) = \\alpha \\, P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(c)$, where $\\alpha = r/\\gamma$ and $P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(c)$ is the probability that RNAP is bound.\n\nLet $f_{\\max} \\equiv \\lim_{c \\to \\infty} f(c)$ denote the asymptotic maximal activity at saturating activator. Define the dimensionless input $x = c/K_d$ and the dimensionless output $y = f(c)/f_{\\max}$.\n\nStarting from the quasi-equilibrium statistical occupancy framework and mass-action binding for the activator, derive a closed-form expression for the dimensionless input-output function $y(x)$ expressed only in terms of $x$, $n$, $p$, and $\\omega$. Identify in your derivation the key independent dimensionless groups that determine the shape of $y(x)$, and show explicitly how dimensional parameters cancel in $y(x)$.\n\nExpress your final answer as the single closed-form expression for $y(x)$, in terms of $x$, $n$, $p$, and $\\omega$.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation and is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation begins from the principles of statistical mechanics applied to the quasi-equilibrium binding of an activator and RNA polymerase (RNAP) to a promoter. The system has four mutually exclusive states, and the probability of the promoter being in any particular state is proportional to the state's thermodynamic weight.\n\nLet's define the statistical weight, $W$, for each of the four promoter states relative to the empty state, which is assigned a weight of $1$. The dimensionless concentration of the activator is $x = c/K_d$.\n\n1.  **Empty state (promoter only):** No molecules are bound.\n    $$W_0 = 1$$\n2.  **Activator-bound state:** The activator oligomer is bound, but RNAP is not. The weight is given as proportional to $(c/K_d)^n$.\n    $$W_A = x^n$$\n3.  **RNAP-bound state:** RNAP is bound, but the activator is not. The weight is given by the dimensionless parameter $p$.\n    $$W_P = p$$\n4.  **Activator-RNAP co-bound state:** Both the activator and RNAP are bound simultaneously. The weight is the product of the individual binding weights, multiplied by the dimensionless cooperativity factor $\\omega$.\n    $$W_{AP} = W_A \\cdot W_P \\cdot \\omega = x^n \\cdot p \\cdot \\omega$$\n\nThe partition function, $Z(x)$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states. It serves as the normalization constant for calculating probabilities.\n$$Z(x) = W_0 + W_A + W_P + W_{AP}$$\n$$Z(x) = 1 + x^n + p + p\\omega x^n$$\nWe can collect terms in powers of $x$:\n$$Z(x) = (1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n$$\n\nAccording to the problem, transcription occurs only when RNAP is bound. This corresponds to the RNAP-bound state and the co-bound state. The probability of RNAP being bound, $P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(x)$, is the sum of the weights of these two states divided by the partition function.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(x) = \\frac{W_P + W_{AP}}{Z(x)} = \\frac{p + p\\omega x^n}{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n}$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(x) = \\frac{p(1 + \\omega x^n)}{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n}$$\n\nThe steady-state transcriptional activity is given by $f(c) = \\alpha \\, P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(c)$, where $\\alpha = r/\\gamma$. In terms of the dimensionless input $x$, this is $f(x) = \\alpha \\, P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(x)$.\n\nNext, we must find the asymptotic maximal activity, $f_{\\max}$, which is defined as the limit of $f(c)$ as $c \\to \\infty$. This is equivalent to the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n$$f_{\\max} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{p(1 + \\omega x^n)}{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n} \\right)$$\nTo evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $x$, which is $x^n$.\n$$f_{\\max} = \\alpha \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{p(\\frac{1}{x^n} + \\omega)}{(\\frac{1+p}{x^n}) + (1+p\\omega)}$$\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, terms with $x^n$ in the denominator go to $0$.\n$$f_{\\max} = \\alpha \\frac{p(0 + \\omega)}{0 + (1+p\\omega)} = \\alpha \\frac{p\\omega}{1+p\\omega}$$\nIt is important to note that if $\\omega=0$ or $p=0$, then $f_{\\max}=0$. The problem is physically meaningful for $\\omega > 0$ and $p>0$.\n\nThe final step is to derive the dimensionless input-output function, $y(x) = f(x)/f_{\\max}$.\n$$y(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{f_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\, P_{\\mathrm{RNAP}}(x)}{\\alpha \\frac{p\\omega}{1+p\\omega}}$$\nThe dimensional constant $\\alpha=r/\\gamma$ cancels out, demonstrating that the normalized output is independent of the absolute rates of transcription and degradation.\n$$y(x) = \\frac{\\frac{p(1 + \\omega x^n)}{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n}}{\\frac{p\\omega}{1+p\\omega}}$$\nAssuming $p > 0$, the factor of $p$ also cancels:\n$$y(x) = \\frac{1 + \\omega x^n}{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n} \\cdot \\frac{1+p\\omega}{\\omega}$$\nThis expression gives $y(x)$ in terms of $x$, $n$, $p$, and $\\omega$. The dimensional parameters $c$ and $K_d$ are contained within the dimensionless input $x$, and all other dimensional parameters ($r, \\gamma$) have cancelled. The shape of the input-output curve is thus determined solely by the dimensionless groups $n$, $p$, and $\\omega$.\n\nFor a more elegant and insightful form, we can simplify this expression. Let's manipulate the fraction by multiplying the numerator by $(1+p\\omega)$ and the denominator by $\\omega$.\n$$y(x) = \\frac{(1 + \\omega x^n)(1+p\\omega)}{\\omega((1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n)}$$\nNow, divide both the numerator and the denominator of this larger fraction by the term $\\omega(1+p\\omega)$.\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\\frac{(1 + \\omega x^n)(1+p\\omega)}{\\omega(1+p\\omega)} = \\frac{1 + \\omega x^n}{\\omega} = x^n + \\frac{1}{\\omega}$$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\omega((1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n)}{\\omega(1+p\\omega)} = \\frac{(1+p) + (1+p\\omega)x^n}{1+p\\omega} = \\frac{1+p}{1+p\\omega} + \\frac{(1+p\\omega)x^n}{1+p\\omega} = x^n + \\frac{1+p}{1+p\\omega}$$\nCombining these results gives the final closed-form expression for $y(x)$:\n$$y(x) = \\frac{x^n + \\frac{1}{\\omega}}{x^n + \\frac{1+p}{1+p\\omega}}$$\nThis expression is the required input-output function, written solely in terms of the dimensionless input $x$ and the dimensionless parameters $n$, $p$, and $\\omega$.",

Let $\\epsilon_{i}$ denote the standard binding free energy for site $i$ such that $K_{i}$ and $\\epsilon_{i}$ are related by the ideal solution convention.

            "solution": "The system has four microstates that differ by which sites are occupied. We assign each state a free energy and compute its Boltzmann weight. We use the grand canonical perspective with chemical potential $\\mu$ to account for the exchange of TF molecules between solution and the promoter.

Weak cooperativity corresponds to small $|\\epsilon_{12}|$ (i.e., $\\omega$ deviating slightly from $1$). Positive cooperativity means $\\epsilon_{12} < 0$ and thus $\\omega > 1$, which increases the probability of the doubly bound state and consequently increases $N_{\\text{occ}}$ compared to the independent case, especially at intermediate to high $c$. Negative cooperativity means $\\epsilon_{12} > 0$ and thus $\\omega < 1$, reducing the doubly bound weight and decreasing $N_{\\text{occ}}$. In the low-concentration limit $c \\ll \\min(K_{1}, K_{2})$, $N_{\\text{occ}} \\approx \\frac{c}{K_{1}} + \\frac{c}{K_{2}}$, independent of $\\omega$ to leading order, reflecting that double occupancy is rare.

Consequently, all second partial derivatives of the model with respect to the parameters are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial \\theta_j \\partial \\theta_k} = 0 \\quad \\forall j,k \\in \\{0,1\\} $$\nTherefore, the Hessian matrix simplifies to:\n$$ H_{jk} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial y(x_i;\\vec{\\theta})}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{\\partial y(x_i;\\vec{\\theta})}{\\partial \\theta_k} $$\nNotice that this expression is independent of the measured data $y_i$ and the specific best-fit parameters $\\vec{\\theta}^{\\ast}$.\n\nThis can be expressed using the sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{S}$, whose elements are $S_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial y(x_i)}{\\partial \\theta_j}$. The Hessian is then $\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivatives of the model function with respect to the parameters:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta_0} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta_1} = h(x) = \\frac{x}{K+x} $$\nNext, we evaluate the function $h(x)$ for the three given concentrations $x_1=1$, $x_2=10$, $x_3=100$, with $K=10$:\n$$ h(x_1) = h(1) = \\frac{1}{10+1} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\n$$ h(x_2) = h(10) = \\frac{10}{10+10} = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ h(x_3) = h(100) = \\frac{100}{10+100} = \\frac{100}{110} = \\frac{10}{11} $$\nThe sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ for the data points $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is a $3 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial y(x_1)}{\\partial \\theta_0} & \\frac{\\partial y(x_1)}{\\partial \\theta_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y(x_2)}{\\partial \\theta_0} & \\frac{\\partial y(x_2)}{\\partial \\theta_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y(x_3)}{\\partial \\theta_0} & \\frac{\\partial y(x_3)}{\\partial \\theta_1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{1}{11} \\\\ 1 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we can compute the matrix $\\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{11} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{1}{11} \\\\ 1 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe elements of the resulting $2 \\times 2$ matrix are:\n$$ (\\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S})_{11} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 3 $$\n$$ (\\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S})_{12} = (\\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S})_{21} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{11} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{10}{11} = \\frac{1+10}{11} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\n$$ (\\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S})_{22} = \\left(\\frac{1}{11}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{121} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{100}{121} = \\frac{101}{121} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{404 + 121}{484} = \\frac{525}{484} $$\nGiven $\\sigma = 1$, the Hessian matrix is $\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{1}{1^2} \\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{S}^T \\mathbf{S}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & \\frac{3}{2} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{525}{484} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is the required $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix. To find its eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \\lambda & \\frac{3}{2} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{525}{484} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (3 - \\lambda)\\left(\\frac{525}{484} - \\lambda\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\left(3 + \\frac{525}{484}\\right)\\lambda + \\left(3 \\cdot \\frac{525}{484} - \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda_{1,2}$ for a general $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix}$ are given by $\\lambda = \\frac{(a+d) \\pm \\sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4b^2}}{2}$.\nHere, $a=3$, $b=3/2$, and $d=525/484$.\nThe trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{H}) = a+d = 3 + \\frac{525}{484} = \\frac{1452+525}{484} = \\frac{1977}{484}$.\nLet's compute the term under the square root:\n$$ (a-d)^2 + 4b^2 = \\left(3 - \\frac{525}{484}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1452 - 525}{484}\\right)^2 + 9 $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{927}{484}\\right)^2 + 9 = \\frac{859329}{234256} + \\frac{9 \\cdot 234256}{234256} = \\frac{859329 + 2108304}{234256} = \\frac{2967633}{234256} $$\nThe eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\frac{1977}{484} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2967633}{234256}}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1977}{484} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2967633}}{484}}{2} = \\frac{1977 \\pm \\sqrt{2967633}}{968} $$\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1977 + \\sqrt{2967633}}{968}$ and the smallest is $\\lambda_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1977 - \\sqrt{2967633}}{968}$.\nThe ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue is:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1977 + \\sqrt{2967633}}{968}}{\\frac{1977 - \\sqrt{2967633}}{968}} = \\frac{1977 + \\sqrt{2967633}}{1977 - \\sqrt{2967633}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{2967633} \\approx 1722.682033 $$\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{1977 + 1722.682033}{1977 - 1722.682033} = \\frac{3699.682033}{254.317967} \\approx 14.5473708 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $14.55$.",
