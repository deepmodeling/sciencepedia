            "problem": "A membrane receptor $R$ mediates a physiological effect when bound by an agonist $G$. The receptor obeys the law of mass action for reversible binding with a single binding site and no cooperativity, and there is no receptor reserve such that the normalized effect is proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist. Let the equilibrium dissociation constant of the agonist be $K_{G}$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant of a competitive antagonist $A$ be $K_{A}$. The antagonist binds to the same site as the agonist and cannot bind simultaneously with the agonist, and both ligands are present at fixed extracellular concentrations. Assume equilibrium is reached rapidly compared to downstream signaling.\n\nDefine the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the agonist in the absence of antagonist, denoted $EC_{50}^{(0)}$, as the agonist concentration $[G]$ that produces half the maximal effect when $A$ is absent. Now introduce the antagonist at a fixed concentration $A$ and define $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$ analogously as the agonist concentration that produces half the maximal effect in the presence of $A$.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action and the definition of receptor occupancy, derive an explicit expression for $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$ in terms of $EC_{50}^{(0)}$, $K_{A}$, and $A$. Your derivation should make clear why the Cheng–Prusoff relation applies in this competitive setting without invoking any pre-stated shortcut formulas. Provide the final $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$ as a single closed-form symbolic expression. If you were to evaluate it numerically, express concentrations in molar (M). No rounding is required for the symbolic answer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the half-maximal effective concentration of an agonist in the presence of a competitive antagonist, $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$, based on first principles of mass-action kinetics.\n\nFirst, we establish the relevant chemical equilibria for the system. A receptor $R$ can reversibly bind an agonist $G$ to form a complex $RG$, or a competitive antagonist $A$ to form a complex $RA$. The reactions are:\n$$R + G \\rightleftharpoons RG$$\n$$R + A \\rightleftharpoons RA$$\n\nThe law of mass action at equilibrium provides the definitions for the dissociation constants, $K_G$ for the agonist and $K_A$ for the antagonist:\n$$K_G = \\frac{[R][G]}{[RG]}$$\n$$K_A = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[G]$, $[A]$, $[RG]$, and $[RA]$ represent the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free agonist, free antagonist, agonist-receptor complex, and antagonist-receptor complex, respectively. The problem states the antagonist is at a fixed concentration, which we denote by $A$.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{tot}$, is the sum of the concentrations of all receptor states: free, agonist-bound, and antagonist-bound.\n$$[R]_{tot} = [R] + [RG] + [RA]$$\n\nThe problem states that the normalized physiological effect, $E$, is proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist. This fractional occupancy, $\\theta_G$, is defined as:\n$$\\theta_G = \\frac{[RG]}{[R]_{tot}}$$\nGiven the absence of receptor reserve, the maximal effect corresponds to full occupancy ($\\theta_G = 1$), so we can equate the normalized effect directly with the fractional occupancy: $E = \\theta_G$.\n\nOur goal is to express $\\theta_G$ as a function of the agonist concentration $[G]$ and the antagonist concentration $A$. To do this, we express $[R]$ and $[RA]$ in terms of $[RG]$ using the equilibrium constant definitions:\nFrom the definition of $K_G$, we have $[R] = \\frac{K_G [RG]}{[G]}$.\nFrom the definition of $K_A$, we have $[RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_A}$. Substituting the expression for $[R]$ into this equation gives:\n$$[RA] = \\left(\\frac{K_G [RG]}{[G]}\\right) \\frac{A}{K_A} = [RG] \\frac{K_G A}{[G] K_A}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[R]$ and $[RA]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$[R]_{tot} = \\frac{K_G [RG]}{[G]} + [RG] + [RG] \\frac{K_G A}{[G] K_A}$$\nFactoring out $[RG]$ yields:\n$$[R]_{tot} = [RG] \\left(1 + \\frac{K_G}{[G]} + \\frac{K_G A}{[G] K_A}\\right)$$\n\nWe can now find the expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta_G$:\n$$\\theta_G = \\frac{[RG]}{[R]_{tot}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_G}{[G]} + \\frac{K_G A}{[G] K_A}}$$\nTo clarify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $[G]$:\n$$\\theta_G = \\frac{[G]}{[G] + K_G + \\frac{K_G A}{K_A}}$$\nGrouping the terms in the denominator gives the final form for the fractional occupancy:\n$$\\theta_G = \\frac{[G]}{[G] + K_G \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)}$$\nThis equation describes the agonist-induced receptor occupancy in the presence of a competitive antagonist. It has the same hyperbolic form as the occupancy equation without antagonist, but with an apparent dissociation constant for the agonist, $K_{G,app} = K_G \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)$, that is increased by a factor of $\\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we use the definitions of $EC_{50}$ to find the desired relationship. First, in the absence of the antagonist ($A=0$), the fractional occupancy equation simplifies to:\n$$\\theta_G = \\frac{[G]}{[G] + K_G}$$\nThe half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}^{(0)}$, is the agonist concentration $[G]$ at which the effect is half-maximal. Since $E=\\theta_G$, this corresponds to $\\theta_G = 1/2$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{(0)}}{EC_{50}^{(0)} + K_G}$$\nSolving for $EC_{50}^{(0)}$ gives $EC_{50}^{(0)} + K_G = 2 \\cdot EC_{50}^{(0)}$, which simplifies to:\n$$EC_{50}^{(0)} = K_G$$\nThis result is expected for a simple system with no receptor reserve, establishing that the agonist's EC50 is identical to its dissociation constant.\n\nNow, we consider the case in the presence of the antagonist at concentration $A$. The half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$, is the agonist concentration $[G]$ that yields an effect of $1/2$ (i.e., $\\theta_G = 1/2$) under these conditions. Using the full occupancy equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{(+A)}}{EC_{50}^{(+A)} + K_G \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)}$$\nSolving for $EC_{50}^{(+A)}$:\n$$EC_{50}^{(+A)} + K_G \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right) = 2 \\cdot EC_{50}^{(+A)}$$\n$$EC_{50}^{(+A)} = K_G \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute $K_G = EC_{50}^{(0)}$ into this expression to obtain the relationship between the EC50 values:\n$$EC_{50}^{(+A)} = EC_{50}^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_A}\\right)$$\n\nThis derivation from the law of mass action shows how the presence of a competitive antagonist increases the apparent dissociation constant of the agonist, thereby shifting the dose-response curve to the right and increasing the EC50. The relationship derived, often associated with the Gaddum or Schild equations, is a direct consequence of the competitive binding equilibrium.\n\nThe Cheng-Prusoff relation applies in this setting because it is derived from the exact same model of competitive binding. While the Cheng-Prusoff equation, typically written as $K_A = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + [G]/K_G}$, is framed to determine the antagonist's affinity ($K_A$) from an experiment measuring the antagonist's IC50 at a fixed agonist concentration $[G]$, it is mathematically equivalent to the relationship we derived. Both equations are simply different algebraic arrangements describing the same underlying three-component equilibrium ($R$, $G$, $A$). Our derivation from first principles confirms the validity of this entire theoretical framework without invoking any pre-stated formulas, thus demonstrating why relations like Cheng-Prusoff are applicable.",

            "problem": "Consider a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptor modeled by mass-action kinetics and receptor-state conservation. The receptor can occupy three lumped states: inactive free receptor $R$, active ligand-bound receptor $R^{*}$ that can signal via G protein activation, and a phosphorylated receptor $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ that is signaling-incompetent. Phosphorylation of $R^{*}$ is mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and dephosphorylation returns $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ to $R$. Ligand $L$ drives activation via binding.

It is scientifically grounded in standard models of receptor kinetics, well-posed as a system of ordinary differential equations, and presented in an objective, formal manner.

We can therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of the behavior of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) system under two conditions: a wild-type (WT) scenario where phosphorylation-mediated desensitization occurs ($k_{\\mathrm{phos}}>0$), and a mutant scenario where phosphorylation is abolished ($k_{\\mathrm{phos}}=0$). We analyze both the transient dynamics (desensitization/adaptation) and the long-time steady-state response under a constant stimulus $L(t)=L_{0}$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Wild-Type (WT) System ($k_{\\mathrm{phos}} > 0$)**\n\nThe system is described by the given set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} \\;=\\; -k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R \\;+\\; k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*} \\;+\\; k_{\\mathrm{deph}}\\,R_{\\mathrm{p}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR^{*}}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R \\;-\\; (k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\;+\\; k_{\\mathrm{phos}})\\,R^{*}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{phos}}\\,R^{*} \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{deph}}\\,R_{\\mathrm{p}}\n$$\nwith the conservation law $R_{T} = R + R^{*} + R_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentrations (denoted with a subscript 'ss'), we set the time derivatives to zero:\nFrom $\\frac{dR_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} = 0$, we have $k_{\\mathrm{phos}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{deph}}\\,R_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}$, which yields:\n$R_{\\mathrm{p,ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dR^{*}}{dt} = 0$, we have $k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}})\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, which yields:\n$R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the conservation law $R_{T} = R_{\\mathrm{ss}} + R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} + R_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}$:\n$R_{T} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}\\right)\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} + R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}}\\right)\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$\n$R_{T} = R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}} \\right)$\n\nSolving for the steady-state active receptor concentration, $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}}$:\n$R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}} = \\frac{R_{T}}{1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}}$.\n\nDynamically, upon stimulus application, $R^{*}$ will rapidly rise and then, due to the $R^{*} \\to R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ conversion, will decay from its peak towards the steady-state value $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}}$. This decay in activity during a sustained stimulus is termed **desensitization** or **adaptation**. The system does not exhibit perfect adaptation, as the steady-state response $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}}$ remains dependent on the ligand concentration $L_{0}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Phosphorylation-Site-Null Mutant System ($k_{\\mathrm{phos}} = 0$)**\n\nFor the mutant, we set $k_{\\mathrm{phos}}=0$ in the governing equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} \\;=\\; -k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R \\;+\\; k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*} \\;+\\; k_{\\mathrm{deph}}\\,R_{\\mathrm{p}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR^{*}}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} \\;=\\; -k_{\\mathrm{deph}}\\,R_{\\mathrm{p}}\n$$\nThe equation for $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ becomes uncoupled. If we assume the system starts from a state with no phosphorylated receptors ($R_{\\mathrm{p}}(0)=0$), then $R_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)=0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The state $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is never populated. The conservation law effectively reduces to $R_{T} = R + R^{*}$. The system simplifies to a two-state reversible binding model:\n$L_0 + R \\rightleftharpoons R^{*}$\n$$\n\\frac{dR^{*}}{dt} \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*}\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dR^{*}}{dt} = 0$, so $k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\nUsing the reduced conservation law, $R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = R_{T} - R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, we substitute and solve for $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,(R_{T} - R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R_{T} - k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R_{T} = (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0})\\,R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$\n$R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}\\,R_{T}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}$\n\nIn this mutant system, the concentration of active receptors $R^{*}$ rises monotonically from $0$ to its steady-state value $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$. The phosphorylation cycle that caused the post-peak decline in the WT system is absent. Therefore, **desensitization is abolished**. The system reaches a new, high steady state and remains there, meaning it does not adapt back towards the pre-stimulus baseline.\n\n**3. Comparison and Evaluation of Options**\n\nBy comparing the denominators of the steady-state expressions for WT and mutant, we can compare their magnitudes.\nDenominator(WT): $1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}$\nDenominator(mutant): $1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}$\n\nSince all rate constants ($k_{...}$) and $L_0$ are positive, the terms $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{deph}}}$ and $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{phos}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L_{0}}$ are positive. Thus, Denominator(WT) $>$ Denominator(mutant). This implies that $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}} < R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$. The mutation **increases** the long-time steady-state level of active receptors.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Eliminating phosphorylation sites abolishes desensitization; the long-time active fraction increases to $R^{*} = \\dfrac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L\\,R_{T}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L}$, and the system does not adapt the output back to its pre-stimulus baseline under sustained stimulus.**\n- \"abolishes desensitization\": Correct. The phosphorylation cycle, which is the mechanism for desensitization in this model, is removed.\n- \"long-time active fraction increases to $R^{*} = \\dfrac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L\\,R_{T}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,L}$\": Correct. We derived this exact expression for the mutant steady state, $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$. This value is an increase from the WT steady state, $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}}$. (The use of $L$ is equivalent to $L_0$ in this context).\n- \"system does not adapt... back to its pre-stimulus baseline\": Correct. The mutant response rises to and holds a new, ligand-dependent steady state, which is not the pre-stimulus baseline of zero.\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Eliminating phosphorylation sites accelerates adaptation by removing a sequestration bottleneck, yielding a shorter decay time constant and a reduced steady-state response.**\n- \"accelerates adaptation\": Incorrect. It eliminates adaptation (desensitization), it does not make it faster.\n- \"shorter decay time constant\": Incorrect. There is no decay in the response of the mutant system.\n- \"reduced steady-state response\": Incorrect. The steady-state response is increased, not reduced ($R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}} > R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, WT}}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Eliminating phosphorylation sites produces perfect adaptation by relieving saturation, making the steady-state output independent of ligand concentration $L$.**\n- \"produces perfect adaptation\": Incorrect. Perfect adaptation implies the steady-state response returns to the baseline, independent of the stimulus. Our derived $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$ is non-zero and explicitly depends on $L_0$.\n- \"making the steady-state output independent of ligand concentration $L$\": Incorrect. The formula for $R^{*}_{\\mathrm{ss, mut}}$ clearly shows a dependence on $L_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Eliminating phosphorylation sites has no effect on desensitization because arrestin recruitment and receptor inactivation are independent of phosphorylation in GPCRs.**\n- \"has no effect on desensitization\": Incorrect. Our analysis shows it abolishes desensitization within the framework of the provided model.\n- \"because arrestin recruitment... are independent of phosphorylation in GPCRs\": This is factually incorrect from a biological standpoint. GRK-mediated phosphorylation is the canonical signal for arrestin binding and subsequent desensitization. Furthermore, it contradicts the model's structure, where phosphorylation ($R^* \\to R_p$) is the explicit mechanism of inactivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The linearized activity equation is:\n$$\\delta a(t) = S_{c} \\, \\delta c(t) + S_{m} \\, \\delta m(t)$$\n\nThe dynamic equation for the modification level becomes:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(m_{0} + \\delta m(t)) = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\delta a(t)) - a_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\tau}$$\nSince $m_{0}$ is a constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d(\\delta m(t))}{dt} = \\frac{\\delta a(t)}{\\tau}$$\n\nWe now analyze the system's response to a sinusoidal input $\\delta c(t) = \\delta c \\cos(\\omega t)$. We use complex phasors for frequency-domain analysis. Let $\\delta c(t) = \\text{Re}(\\tilde{\\delta c} e^{i\\omega t})$, $\\delta a(t) = \\text{Re}(\\tilde{\\delta a} e^{i\\omega t})$, and $\\delta m(t) = \\text{Re}(\\tilde{\\delta m} e^{i\\omega t})$, where $\\tilde{\\delta c}$, $\\tilde{\\delta a}$, and $\\tilde{\\delta m}$ are the complex amplitudes. The time derivative becomes multiplication by $i\\omega$. The linearized system in the frequency domain is:\n1. $\\tilde{\\delta a} = S_{c} \\tilde{\\delta c} + S_{m} \\tilde{\\delta m}$\n2. $i\\omega \\tilde{\\delta m} = \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\delta a}}{\\tau}$\n\nCase 1: Adaptation is inhibited ($\\tau \\to \\infty$).\nIn this case, $\\frac{d(\\delta m)}{dt} = 0$, which implies $\\delta m(t) = 0$ for all time.\nThe first equation becomes $\\tilde{\\delta a} = S_{c} \\tilde{\\delta c}$.\nThe frequency response (transfer function) is $H_{0}(\\omega) = \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\delta a}}{\\tilde{\\delta c}} = S_{c}$.\nThe amplitude of the activity oscillation is $A_{0} = |H_{0}(\\omega)| |\\tilde{\\delta c}| = |S_{c}| \\delta c$.\n\nCase 2: Adaptation is intact (finite $\\tau$).\nWe solve the system of two algebraic equations for $\\tilde{\\delta a}$ and $\\tilde{\\delta m}$. From the second equation, we have $\\tilde{\\delta m} = \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\delta a}}{i\\omega\\tau}$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$\\tilde{\\delta a} = S_{c} \\tilde{\\delta c} + S_{m} \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta a}}{i\\omega\\tau}\\right)$$\nWe solve for $\\tilde{\\delta a}$:\n$$\\tilde{\\delta a} \\left(1 - \\frac{S_{m}}{i\\omega\\tau}\\right) = S_{c} \\tilde{\\delta c}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\delta a} \\left(\\frac{i\\omega\\tau - S_{m}}{i\\omega\\tau}\\right) = S_{c} \\tilde{\\delta c}$$\nThe transfer function with adaptation is:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\delta a}}{\\tilde{\\delta c}} = S_{c} \\left(\\frac{i\\omega\\tau}{i\\omega\\tau - S_{m}}\\right)$$\nThe amplitude of the activity oscillation in this case is $A = |H(\\omega)| \\delta c$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R(\\omega) = \\dfrac{A}{A_{0}}$.\n$$R(\\omega) = \\frac{A}{A_{0}} = \\frac{|H(\\omega)| \\delta c}{|S_{c}| \\delta c} = \\frac{|H(\\omega)|}{|S_{c}|}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $H(\\omega)$ and $H_{0}(\\omega)=S_c$:\n$$R(\\omega) = \\left| \\frac{S_{c} \\left(\\frac{i\\omega\\tau}{i\\omega\\tau - S_{m}}\\right)}{S_{c}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{i\\omega\\tau}{i\\omega\\tau - S_{m}} \\right|$$\nThe magnitude of this complex number is the ratio of the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$R(\\omega) = \\frac{|i\\omega\\tau|}{|-S_{m} + i\\omega\\tau|} = \\frac{\\omega\\tau}{\\sqrt{(-S_{m})^{2} + (\\omega\\tau)^{2}}} = \\frac{\\omega\\tau}{\\sqrt{S_{m}^{2} + (\\omega\\tau)^{2}}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the ratio $R(\\omega)$ in terms of $\\omega$, $\\tau$, and $S_{m}$.\n\nNow, we use the provided experimental values to calculate $\\tau$.\nThe ratio of measured amplitudes is $R(\\omega) = \\dfrac{A}{A_{0}} = \\dfrac{0.030}{0.050} = 0.6$.\nThe other given values are $S_{m} = 0.200$ (dimensionless activity change per unit $m$) and $\\omega = 0.010 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $R(\\omega)$:\n$$0.6 = \\frac{(0.010)\\tau}{\\sqrt{(0.200)^{2} + ((0.010)\\tau)^{2}}}$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$(0.6)^{2} = \\frac{((0.010)\\tau)^{2}}{(0.200)^{2} + ((0.010)\\tau)^{2}}$$\n$$0.36 = \\frac{(0.010)^{2}\\tau^{2}}{(0.0400) + (0.010)^{2}\\tau^{2}}$$\nLet $X = ((0.010)\\tau)^{2}$:\n$$0.36 = \\frac{X}{0.0400 + X}$$\n$$0.36(0.0400 + X) = X$$\n$$0.0144 + 0.36X = X$$\n$$0.0144 = X - 0.36X$$\n$$0.0144 = 0.64X$$\n$$X = \\frac{0.0144}{0.64} = 0.0225$$\nNow we substitute back $X = ((0.010)\\tau)^{2}$:\n$$((0.010)\\tau)^{2} = 0.0225$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and knowing $\\tau > 0$):\n$$(0.010)\\tau = \\sqrt{0.0225} = 0.15$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{0.15}{0.010} = 15$$\nThe units of $\\omega$ are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and the final expression for $R(\\omega)$ is dimensionally consistent if $\\tau$ is in seconds, so the result is $\\tau = 15 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$\\tau = 15.0 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.",
