            "solution": "The problem requires deriving the relationship between chloride concentrations across a capillary wall at Donnan equilibrium and then calculating the numerical value of this concentration ratio. The derivation starts from the first principle that at equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of any freely diffusible ion must be equal in all accessible compartments.\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\bar{\\mu}_j$, of an ionic species $j$ is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_j) + z_j F \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_j$ is the activity of the ion, $z_j$ is the valence (charge number) of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the local electrical potential.\n\nFor the chloride ion ($\\mathrm{Cl}^-$) in the plasma ($P$) and interstitial fluid ($I$) compartments, we can write the respective electrochemical potentials:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, P}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Cl, P}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{P}}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, I}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Cl, I}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{I}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0$, is the same in both compartments.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of chloride ions, so their electrochemical potentials must be equal:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, P}} = \\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, I}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the electrochemical potentials gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Cl, P}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{P}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Cl, I}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{I}}\n$$\nThe $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0$ terms cancel.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by addressing each task sequentially.\n\nFirst, we define the concepts of structural and practical identifiability.\nStructural identifiability is an idealized, theoretical property of a model structure, its inputs, and its outputs. A parameter $\\theta$ in a model is structurally globally identifiable if its value can be uniquely determined from perfect (noise-free), continuous measurements of the inputs and outputs over an infinite time horizon. If different values of the parameter can produce the exact same input-output behavior, the parameter is structurally unidentifiable. It is a prerequisite for any meaningful parameter estimation.\nPractical identifiability, in contrast, concerns the feasibility of estimating parameter values from real-world data, which is finite in duration and corrupted by noise. A parameter may be structurally identifiable but practically unidentifiable if its value is highly sensitive to measurement noise, or if an impractically large or rich dataset is required to estimate it with acceptable precision. Practical identifiability is typically assessed using tools like sensitivity analysis or the Fisher Information Matrix to quantify the confidence in parameter estimates.\n\nSecond, we demonstrate that the plasma water volume, $x_{p}(t)$, is algebraically observable from the hematocrit, $H(t)$, and the red blood cell volume, $V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$. Observability, in this context, means that the state variable can be determined from the output measurements. The measurement equation for hematocrit, $y_{2}(t)$, is given as:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}}{x_{p}(t)+V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}}\n$$\nGiven that $H(t)$ is a measured output and $V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$ is a known constant, we can algebraically solve this equation for the state variable $x_{p}(t)$.\n$$\nH(t) \\left(x_{p}(t)+V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\right) = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\n$$\n$$\nH(t)x_{p}(t) + H(t)V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\n$$\n$$\nH(t)x_{p}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} - H(t)V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\left(1-H(t)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx_{p}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)}\n$$\nSince $x_{p}(t)$ can be expressed as a direct algebraic function of the measurement $H(t)$ and the known parameter $V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$, it is algebraically observable.\n\nThird, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the lumped osmotic transport parameter $\\theta = L_{p}\\,R\\,T\\,n_{A}$. The derivation begins with the state equation for the plasma water volume:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t}=J_{w}(t)+u(t)\n$$\nThe transcapillary water flux $J_{w}(t)$ is given by $J_{w}(t) = L_{p}\\,\\left(\\pi_{p}(t)-\\pi_{i}(t)\\right)$, and the osmotic pressure difference is $\\pi_{p}(t)-\\pi_{i}(t)=R\\,T\\,n_{A}/x_{p}(t)$. Substituting these into the dynamic equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} = L_{p} \\frac{R\\,T\\,n_{A}}{x_{p}(t)} + u(t)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the lumped parameter $\\theta=L_{p}\\,R\\,T\\,n_{A}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} = \\frac{\\theta}{x_{p}(t)} + u(t)\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of the measurement $H(t)$ and its derivative, we must substitute the expression for $x_{p}(t)$ and its time derivative into this equation. We have already found $x_{p}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)}$. We now compute its derivative with respect to time $t$, using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)} \\right) = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\frac{\\left(-\\frac{dH}{dt}\\right)H(t) - (1-H(t))\\left(\\frac{dH}{dt}\\right)}{H(t)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\frac{-H(t)\\frac{dH}{dt} - \\frac{dH}{dt} + H(t)\\frac{dH}{dt}}{H(t)^2} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\frac{-\\frac{dH}{dt}}{H(t)^2} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}}{H(t)^2}\\frac{dH}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the dynamic equation to solve for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{x_{p}(t)} = \\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} - u(t) \\implies \\theta = x_{p}(t) \\left( \\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} - u(t) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $x_{p}(t)$ and $\\frac{d x_{p}}{d t}$ in terms of $H(t)$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\left( V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}}{H(t)^2}\\frac{dH}{dt} - u(t) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives the desired result for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = -V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}^2 \\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)^3}\\frac{dH}{dt} - V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}\\frac{1-H(t)}{H(t)}u(t)\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in a factored form.\n\nFourth, we analyze the structural identifiability of the total extracellular sodium amount, $n_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.\nStructural identifiability requires that we can uniquely determine $n_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ from the available inputs and outputs, assuming a perfect model and noise-free data. The key dynamics and measurements for this analysis are:\n1.  The total extracellular water volume $V_{ECW}(t) = x_{p}(t) + x_{i}(t)$. Its dynamics are found by summing the state equations:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d V_{ECW}}{d t} = \\frac{d x_{p}}{d t} + \\frac{d x_{i}}{d t} = (J_{w}(t)+u(t)) + (-J_{w}(t)) = u(t)\n    $$\n2.  Integrating this simple differential equation gives the total volume over time:\n    $$\n    V_{ECW}(t) = V_{ECW}(0) + \\int_{0}^{t} u(\\tau)d\\tau\n    $$\n    where $V_{ECW}(0) = x_{p}(0) + x_{i}(0)$ is the initial total extracellular volume. The problem states that $x_{i}(0)$ is unknown, making $V_{ECW}(0)$ an unknown constant.\n3.  The serum sodium measurement $y_{1}(t)$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    y_{1}(t) = c_{\\mathrm{Na}}(t) = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{x_{p}(t)+x_{i}(t)} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{V_{ECW}(t)}\n    $$\n    Here, $n_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is the unknown parameter we wish to identify.\n\nFrom the measurement equation, we can write $n_{\\mathrm{Na}} = y_{1}(t) V_{ECW}(t)$. Substituting the expression for $V_{ECW}(t)$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = y_{1}(t) \\left( V_{ECW}(0) + \\int_{0}^{t} u(\\tau)d\\tau \\right)\n$$\nThis equation contains two unknowns: the parameter $n_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and the initial condition $V_{ECW}(0)$. However, this relationship must hold for all $t \\geq 0$. We can evaluate this equation at two distinct time points, $t_1$ and $t_2$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = y_{1}(t_1) \\left( V_{ECW}(0) + \\int_{0}^{t_1} u(\\tau)d\\tau \\right) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = y_{1}(t_2) \\left( V_{ECW}(0) + \\int_{0}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau \\right) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2})\n$$\nWe can solve for $V_{ECW}(0)$ from Eq. 1: $V_{ECW}(0) = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{y_{1}(t_1)} - \\int_{0}^{t_1} u(\\tau)d\\tau$. Substituting this into Eq. 2:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = y_{1}(t_2) \\left( \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{y_{1}(t_1)} - \\int_{0}^{t_1} u(\\tau)d\\tau\\right) + \\int_{0}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau \\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{y_{1}(t_2)}{y_{1}(t_1)}n_{\\mathrm{Na}} + y_{1}(t_2) \\left( \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau \\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\left(1 - \\frac{y_{1}(t_2)}{y_{1}(t_1)}\\right) = y_{1}(t_2) \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\left(\\frac{y_{1}(t_1) - y_{1}(t_2)}{y_{1}(t_1)}\\right) = y_{1}(t_2) \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{y_{1}(t_1) y_{1}(t_2)}{y_{1}(t_1) - y_{1}(t_2)} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} u(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\nThis provides a unique solution for $n_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, provided the input $u(t)$ is sufficiently \"exciting\" (i.e., not identically zero) to cause a change in the output $y_{1}(t)$ (i.e., $y_1(t_1) \\neq y_1(t_2)$).
