            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) based on a simplified model of renal filtration governed by Starling forces.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing principles. The problem states that the volumetric flux across the glomerular filtration barrier is proportional to the net driving pressure. For the entire kidney, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f \\times P_{UF}\n$$\nwhere GFR is the Glomerular Filtration Rate, $K_f$ is the whole-kidney ultrafiltration coefficient, and $P_{UF}$ is the net ultrafiltration pressure.\n\nNext, we must derive an expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure, $P_{UF}$. The problem specifies that this pressure is the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures acting across the barrier between the glomerular capillary ($GC$) and Bowman's space ($BS$). These are known as Starling forces. The general form of the Starling equation for fluid flux is:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (\\text{Forces favoring filtration}) - (\\text{Forces opposing filtration})\n$$\nFiltration is the movement of fluid from the glomerular capillary into Bowman's space.\nThe forces favoring filtration are:\n$1$. The hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary, $P_{GC}$.\n$2$. The oncotic pressure within Bowman's space, $\\pi_{BS}$. This force arises from proteins in the filtrate, which would pull water into Bowman's space.\n\nThe forces opposing filtration are:\n$1$. The hydrostatic pressure within Bowman's space, $P_{BS}$. This pressure exerts a back-pressure against the capillary wall.\n$2$. The oncotic pressure within the glomerular capillary, $\\pi_{GC}$. This force, generated by plasma proteins like albumin that are not readily filtered, tends to retain water within the capillary.\n\nCombining these forces gives the expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (P_{GC} + \\pi_{BS}) - (P_{BS} + \\pi_{GC})\n$$\nThe problem statement provides several key conditions and assumptions. One assumption is that the protein concentration in Bowman's space is negligible. This implies that the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space is zero.\n$$\n\\pi_{BS} = 0 \\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nAnother crucial assumption is that of \"negligible filtration disequilibrium,\" which means the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{GC}$, can be treated as constant along the entire length of the capillary. This simplifies the model by allowing us to use a single average value for $\\pi_{GC}$ rather than integrating over a changing pressure profile.\n\nSubstituting $\\pi_{BS} = 0$ into the equation for $P_{UF}$, we obtain the specific expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure applicable to this problem:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (P_{GC} + 0) - (P_{BS} + \\pi_{GC})\n$$\n$$\nP_{UF} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $P_{UF}$ back into the primary equation for GFR. This yields the derived expression for GFR based on the given first principles:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f \\times (P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC})\n$$\nWith the derived expression, we proceed to compute the numerical value of GFR using the provided data:\n- Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure: $P_{GC} = 50\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure: $P_{BS} = 12\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure: $\\pi_{GC} = 20\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Whole-kidney ultrafiltration coefficient: $K_{f} = 12\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net ultrafiltration pressure, $P_{UF}$:\n$$\nP_{UF} = 50\\ \\text{mmHg} - 12\\ \\text{mmHg} - 20\\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\n$$\nP_{UF} = 18\\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nNext, we use this value to calculate the GFR:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = (12\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (18\\ \\text{mmHg})\n$$\nThe units of mmHg cancel, leaving the result in $\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}$ as required.\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = 12 \\times 18 \\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = 216\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $216$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.",

Derivation of the Governing Equation and Closed-Form Solution**\n\nThe model is based on the principle of conservation of mass for creatinine in a single, well-mixed compartment representing the plasma volume. The rate of change of the total mass of creatinine, $M(t)$, in the compartment is given by the difference between the generation rate, $R_{in}$, and the elimination rate, $R_{out}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = R_{in} - R_{out}\n$$\nThe concentration of creatinine, $C(t)$, is defined as the mass divided by the constant volume of distribution, $V_d$.\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{M(t)}{V_d} \\implies M(t) = V_d C(t)\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to time, and noting that $V_d$ is constant, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe rate of elimination, $R_{out}$, is defined by the renal clearance, $CL(t)$, and the instantaneous concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$\nR_{out}(t) = CL(t) C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation gives the general differential equation for creatinine concentration:\n$$\nV_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_{in} - CL(t) C(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that prior to the GFR reduction (for $t  0$), the system is in a steady state with a baseline clearance $CL_0$ and a baseline concentration $C_0$. In steady state, the concentration does not change, so $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. This allows us to determine the constant generation rate $R_{in}$.\n$$\n0 = R_{in} - CL_0 C_0 \\implies R_{in} = CL_0 C_0\n$$\nThis constant generation rate persists for $t \\ge 0$. At $t = 0^+$, an acute reduction in GFR occurs, such that the clearance changes to a new constant value $CL_1 = f \\cdot CL_0$ for all $t \\ge 0$, where $f \\in (0,1]$ is the reduction factor.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{in}$ and $CL_1$ into the general differential equation, we obtain the governing equation for $C(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nV_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = CL_0 C_0 - (f \\cdot CL_0) C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = q(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d} C(t) = \\frac{CL_0 C_0}{V_d}\n$$\nThe initial condition is that the concentration at the moment of the change is the baseline concentration, so $C(0) = C_0$.\n\nThe solution to this type of differential equation, $y' + ay = b$, is of the form $y(t) = \\frac{b}{a} + K e^{-at}$, where $K$ is a constant determined by the initial condition.\nHere, $a = \\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d}$ and $b = \\frac{CL_0 C_0}{V_d}$.\nThe new steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,1}$, is given by $\\frac{b}{a}$:\n$$\nC_{ss,1} = \\frac{CL_0 C_0 / V_d}{f \\cdot CL_0 / V_d} = \\frac{C_0}{f}\n$$\nSo the general solution is:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{C_0}{f} + K e^{-\\left(\\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d}\\right)t}\n$$\nWe apply the initial condition $C(0) = C_0$ to find $K$:\n$$\nC(0) = C_0 = \\frac{C_0}{f} + K e^{0} \\implies K = C_0 - \\frac{C_0}{f} = C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{f}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $K$ back into the general solution gives the final closed-form solution for $C(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{C_0}{f} + C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{f}\\right) e^{-\\left(\\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d}\\right)t}\n$$\n\n**2. The Time Constant $\\tau$**\n\nThe exponential term in the solution, $e^{-\\left(\\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d}\\right)t}$, can be written as $e^{-t/\\tau}$. The time constant, $\\tau$, characterizes the time scale for the system to approach the new steady state. By comparing the exponents, we can identify $\\tau$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{f \\cdot CL_0}{V_d} \\implies \\tau = \\frac{V_d}{f \\cdot CL_0}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the time constant.

The final values for $\\tau$ (in minutes) and $C(1440)$ (in $\\text{mg/L}$) are rounded to three decimal places.\n\nAs an example, for Test A: $V_d = 42\\,\\text{L}$, $CL_0 = 120\\,\\text{mL/min} = 0.12\\,\\text{L/min}$, $C_0 = 10\\,\\text{mg/L}$, $f = 0.5$, $t = 1440\\,\\text{min}$.\n- $\\tau_A = \\frac{42}{0.5 \\times 0.12} = 700\\,\\text{min}$.\n- $C_A(1440) = \\frac{10}{0.5} + \\left(10 - \\frac{10}{0.5}\\right) e^{-1440/700} = 20 + (-10) e^{-2.05714...} \\approx 20 - 1.27813 \\approx 18.72187\\,\\text{mg/L}$.\nRounding to three decimal places gives $\\tau_A = 700.000\\,\\text{min}$ and $C_A(1440) = 18.722\\,\\text{mg/L}$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all test cases.\n- Test B: A larger $V_d$ increases the time constant, slowing the approach to the new steady state.\n- Test C: With $f=1.0$, there is no change in clearance. The term $(C_0 - C_0/f)$ becomes $0$, so $C(t) = C_0$ for all $t$. The system remains in its initial steady state.\n- Test D: A severe reduction in clearance ($f=0.01$) results in a very large time constant and a very high new steady-state concentration. After $24\\,\\text{h}$, the concentration will have risen significantly but will still be far from its new equilibrium.",
