Dividing the entire equation by $\\exp(i\\theta)$ yields:\n$$\n\\dot{r} + ir\\dot{\\theta} = (\\lambda+i\\omega)r - \\beta r^3 + f\\exp(i(\\Omega t - \\theta))\n$$\nWe expand the complex terms and separate the equation into its real and imaginary parts.\n$$\n\\dot{r} + ir\\dot{\\theta} = \\lambda r + i\\omega r - \\beta r^3 + f(\\cos(\\Omega t - \\theta) + i\\sin(\\Omega t - \\theta))\n$$\nEquating the real parts:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = \\lambda r - \\beta r^3 + f\\cos(\\Omega t - \\theta)\n$$\nEquating the imaginary parts:\n$$\nr\\dot{\\theta} = \\omega r + f\\sin(\\Omega t - \\theta)\n$$\nDividing the second equation by $r$ (assuming $r>0$ away from the trivial fixed point) and using the properties of sine and cosine, we obtain the coupled ordinary differential equations for amplitude $r(t)$ and phase $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = r(\\lambda - \\beta r^2) + f\\cos(\\theta - \\Omega t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\omega - \\frac{f}{r}\\sin(\\theta - \\Omega t)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Reduction to a Single Equation for Phase Difference $\\psi(t)$\nFirst, we determine the steady amplitude $r^{\\ast}$ of the unforced oscillator. For the unforced case ($f=0$), the amplitude equation is $\\dot{r} = r(\\lambda - \\beta r^2)$. The steady state ($\\dot{r} = 0$) has a non-trivial solution when $\\lambda - \\beta r^2 = 0$. Since $\\lambda > 0$, this gives a stable limit cycle amplitude:\n$$\nr^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\beta}}\n$$\nIn the weak-forcing regime ($f \\ll 1$), the amplitude $r(t)$ remains close to $r^{\\ast}$. This approximation is justified by the fact that the amplitude relaxation to the limit cycle is typically much faster than the evolution of the phase difference, allowing for an averaging procedure. We substitute $r(t) \\approx r^{\\ast}$ into the phase equation.\n\nNext, we define the phase difference $\\psi(t) = \\theta(t) - \\Omega t$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = \\dot{\\theta} - \\Omega\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{\\theta}$ from Part 1:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = \\left(\\omega - \\frac{f}{r}\\sin(\\theta - \\Omega t)\\right) - \\Omega\n$$\nUsing the definition of $\\psi$ and the approximation $r \\approx r^{\\ast}$, we get the reduced scalar equation for $\\psi(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = (\\omega - \\Omega) - \\frac{f}{r^{\\ast}}\\sin(\\psi)\n$$\nThis is a form of the Adler equation. The condition for $1{:}1$ entrainment, or phase-locking, is the existence of a stable fixed point $\\psi^{\\ast}$ for this equation, where $\\dot{\\psi}=0$. The fixed-point condition is thus:\n$$\n0 = (\\omega - \\Omega) - \\frac{f}{r^{\\ast}}\\sin(\\psi^{\\ast})\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\sin(\\psi^{\\ast}) = \\frac{r^{\\ast}(\\omega - \\Omega)}{f}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Minimal Light Coupling Strength $f_c$\nFor a real solution $\\psi^{\\ast}$ to exist, the value of $\\sin(\\psi^{\\ast})$ must lie in the interval $[-1, 1]$. This imposes the following condition:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{r^{\\ast}(\\omega - \\Omega)}{f} \\right| \\le 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r^{\\ast}|\\omega - \\Omega|}{f} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality can be solved for the forcing strength $f$:\n$$\nf \\ge r^{\\ast}|\\omega - \\Omega|\n$$\nThe minimal light coupling strength, $f_c$, is the threshold at which entrainment becomes possible. This corresponds to the equality in the condition above.\n$$\nf_c = r^{\\ast}|\\omega - \\Omega|\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the unforced amplitude $r^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\lambda/\\beta}$:\n$$\nf_c = |\\omega - \\Omega| \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\beta}}\n$$\nFor $f  f_c$, no fixed point exists, and the system exhibits phase slipping (quasi-periodicity). For $f > f_c$, two fixed points appear via a saddle-node bifurcation, one of which is stable, corresponding to a stable entrained state.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation\nThe derived equations from Part 1, $\\dot{r} = r(\\lambda - \\beta r^2) + f\\cos(\\psi)$ and $\\dot{\\theta} = \\omega - \\frac{f}{r}\\sin(\\psi)$, clearly show how the light-driven term modifies the oscillator's dynamics. The forcing $f$ has two distinct effects based on its projection onto the amplitude and phase directions in the complex plane.\n\n1.  **Phase Modulation**: The term $-\\frac{f}{r}\\sin(\\psi)$ in the $\\dot{\\theta}$ equation directly modifies the oscillator's instantaneous frequency. The frequency \"pulling\" effect of the external drive is maximized when $\\psi = \\pm\\pi/2$. Entrainment occurs when this phase-modifying term is, on average, strong enough to compensate for the intrinsic frequency detuning, $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega - \\Omega$, by establishing a stable phase lag $\\psi^{\\ast}$. This is the essence of phase locking.\n\n2.  **Amplitude Modulation**: The term $f\\cos(\\psi)$ in the $\\dot{r}$ equation directly affects the amplitude dynamics. This means the forcing can either enhance ($\\cos(\\psi) > 0$) or suppress ($\\cos(\\psi)  0$) the amplitude. In the standard averaging argument for weak forcing, this effect is often considered secondary because the intrinsic amplitude dynamics, governed by $r(\\lambda - \\beta r^2)$, are assumed to be \"stiff,\" meaning the amplitude relaxes quickly to its steady-state value $r^{\\ast}$. The phase, being a neutrally stable direction for the unforced oscillator, evolves much more slowly. Thus, the dynamics are assumed to collapse onto the limit cycle, and the primary effect of forcing is to govern the slow evolution of the phase difference $\\psi$ as captured by the Adler equation. The critical strength $f_c$ represents the boundary of the Arnold tongue, defining the region in the parameter space of forcing strength ($f$) versus frequency detuning ($|\\omega - \\Omega|$) where entrainment is possible. It highlights the trade-off: a larger frequency mismatch requires a stronger light stimulus to achieve synchronization. The dependence on $\\sqrt{\\lambda/\\beta}$ shows that oscillators with larger intrinsic amplitudes are more robust and require stronger forcing to be entrained.",
