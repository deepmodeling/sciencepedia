Express $T_{1/2}$ symbolically in terms of $p_{1}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it uses the well-established Bergman minimal model, a cornerstone of quantitative endocrinology. The experimental setup, a euglycemic clamp with an initial glucose bolus, is physiologically plausible and mathematically well-defined. The problem is well-posed, providing a system of first-order ordinary differential equations with sufficient initial conditions and specified forcing functions, guaranteeing a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters are constrained to be positive, which is consistent with their physiological meaning. The problem is self-contained, and no contradictions are present. The task is a standard exercise in solving a system of ODEs and is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe system of equations describes the dynamics of the insulin action $X(t)$ and plasma glucose concentration $G(t)$. We will solve these sequentially.\n\nFirst, we solve for the insulin action $X(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt}=-p_{2}X+p_{3}\\big(I(t)-I_{b}\\big) $$\nThe problem states that a euglycemic basal insulin clamp is applied, which means the plasma insulin concentration is held constant at its basal level, $I(t)=I_{b}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. Substituting this condition into the equation for $X(t)$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt}=-p_{2}X+p_{3}\\big(I_{b}-I_{b}\\big) $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt}=-p_{2}X $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is of the form $X(t) = C \\exp(-p_{2}t)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. We determine $C$ using the initial condition $X(0)=0$:\n$$ X(0) = C \\exp(-p_{2} \\cdot 0) = C \\cdot 1 = C $$\nGiven $X(0)=0$, we have $C=0$. Therefore, the solution for the insulin action is:\n$$ X(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0 $$\nThis result indicates that because the insulin level does not deviate from its basal value, there is no stimulus for the accumulation of insulin action in the remote compartment.\n\nNext, we solve for the plasma glucose concentration $G(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt}=-\\big(p_{1}+X(t)\\big)\\big(G(t)-G_{b}\\big)+u_{G}(t) $$\nFor $t > 0$, we substitute the known functions $X(t)=0$ and $u_{G}(t)=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt}=-\\big(p_{1}+0\\big)\\big(G(t)-G_{b}\\big)+0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt}=-p_{1}\\big(G(t)-G_{b}\\big) $$\nTo simplify the solution process, we define a new variable, $g(t)$, representing the deviation of glucose from its basal level:\n$$ g(t) = G(t) - G_{b} $$\nThe derivative of $g(t)$ with respect to time is $\\frac{dg}{dt} = \\frac{dG}{dt}$, since $G_b$ is a constant. Substituting $g(t)$ and its derivative into the equation for $G(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{dg}{dt} = -p_{1} g(t) $$\nThis is another first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is $g(t) = A \\exp(-p_{1}t)$, where $A$ is the constant of integration. We determine $A$ using the initial condition for glucose. At $t=0$:\n$$ g(0) = G(0) - G_{b} $$\nThe problem states $G(0)=G_{b}+\\Delta G$, so:\n$$ g(0) = (G_{b}+\\Delta G) - G_b = \\Delta G $$\nUsing this initial condition for $g(t)$:\n$$ g(0) = A \\exp(-p_{1} \\cdot 0) = A \\cdot 1 = A $$\nThus, $A = \\Delta G$. The solution for the glucose deviation is:\n$$ g(t) = \\Delta G \\exp(-p_{1}t) $$\nFinally, we substitute back to find the closed-form solution for $G(t)$:\n$$ G(t) = g(t) + G_{b} = G_{b} + \\Delta G \\exp(-p_{1}t) $$\nThis is the complete solution for $G(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe final task is to determine the half-life $T_{1/2}$ of the glucose decay. The half-life is defined by the condition $G(T_{1/2})-G_{b}=\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta G$. Using our variable $g(t)=G(t)-G_b$, this condition becomes:\n$$ g(T_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta G $$\nWe substitute our derived expression for $g(t)$:\n$$ \\Delta G \\exp(-p_{1}T_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta G $$\nAssuming the initial perturbation is non-zero, $\\Delta G \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\Delta G$:\n$$ \\exp(-p_{1}T_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTo solve for $T_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\big(\\exp(-p_{1}T_{1/2})\\big) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ -p_{1}T_{1/2} = -\\ln(2) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and dividing by $p_{1}$ (which is strictly positive), we obtain the expression for the half-life:\n$$ T_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{p_{1}} $$\nIn the Bergman minimal model, the parameter $p_{1}$ has units of inverse time (e.g., $\\text{min}^{-1}$), so the expression for $T_{1/2}$ correctly yields units of time (e.g., minutes), as requested. This half-life is determined solely by the glucose effectiveness parameter $p_1$ because the experimental clamp conditions have neutralized any dynamic insulin action.\n\nThe two required analytic expressions are the solution for $G(t)$ and the formula for $T_{1/2}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a two-state subsystem of the minimal model of glucose-insulin regulation. The analysis involves transforming the state variables, finding the equilibrium point of the transformed system, computing the Jacobian matrix at this equilibrium, and discussing its eigenvalues and the implications for system stability.\n\nThe given system dynamics are:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt} = -\\left(p_{1} + X\\right)G + p_{1} G_{b} $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = -p_{2} X + p_{3}\\left(I - I_{b}\\right) $$\nwhere $G(t)$ is plasma glucose concentration, $X(t)$ is insulin action, $I(t)$ is plasma insulin concentration, and $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, G_{b}, I_{b}$ are positive constants.\n\nFirst, we derive the dynamics for the state vector $(\\tilde{G}, X)$, where $\\tilde{G}(t)$ is the glucose deviation from basal, defined as $\\tilde{G}(t) \\equiv G(t) - G_{b}$. From this definition, we have $G(t) = \\tilde{G}(t) + G_{b}$. Since $G_{b}$ is a constant, the time derivative of $\\tilde{G}(t)$ is $\\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = \\frac{dG}{dt}$.\n\nWe substitute $G(t) = \\tilde{G}(t) + G_{b}$ into the first differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = -\\left(p_{1} + X\\right)\\left(\\tilde{G} + G_{b}\\right) + p_{1} G_{b} $$\nExpanding the terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = -p_{1}\\tilde{G} - p_{1}G_{b} - X\\tilde{G} - XG_{b} + p_{1} G_{b} $$\nThe terms $-p_{1}G_{b}$ and $+p_{1}G_{b}$ cancel out, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = -p_{1}\\tilde{G} - X\\tilde{G} - XG_{b} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = -(p_{1} + X)\\tilde{G} - G_{b}X $$\nThis is the first equation for our transformed system.\n\nFor the second equation, we consider the system at basal equilibrium, where the insulin concentration is at its basal level, $I(t) = I_{b}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\frac{dX}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = -p_{2} X + p_{3}\\left(I_{b} - I_{b}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = -p_{2} X $$\nThis is the second equation for our transformed system.\n\nThe autonomous system of differential equations for the state vector $(\\tilde{G}, X)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = f_1(\\tilde{G}, X) = -(p_{1} + X)\\tilde{G} - G_{b}X $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = f_2(\\tilde{G}, X) = -p_{2} X $$\n\nNext, we identify the basal equilibrium point $(\\tilde{G}_{eq}, X_{eq})$ by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{G}}{dt} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = 0 $$\nFrom the second equation, $0 = -p_{2} X_{eq}$. Since the parameter $p_{2}$ is positive, this implies $X_{eq} = 0$.\nSubstituting $X_{eq} = 0$ into the first equation:\n$$ 0 = -(p_{1} + 0)\\tilde{G}_{eq} - G_{b}(0) $$\n$$ 0 = -p_{1}\\tilde{G}_{eq} $$\nSince the parameter $p_{1}$ is positive, this implies $\\tilde{G}_{eq} = 0$.\nThus, the basal equilibrium point for the $(\\tilde{G}, X)$ dynamics is $(0, 0)$. This corresponds to the state where glucose is at its basal level ($G = G_b$) and insulin action is at its basal level ($X=0$).\n\nNow, we compute the Jacobian matrix, $J$, of the system, which is defined as:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\tilde{G}} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial X} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial \\tilde{G}} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial X} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives from $f_1(\\tilde{G}, X) = -p_{1}\\tilde{G} - X\\tilde{G} - G_{b}X$ and $f_2(\\tilde{G}, X) = -p_{2}X$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\tilde{G}} = -p_{1} - X $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial X} = -\\tilde{G} - G_{b} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial \\tilde{G}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial X} = -p_{2} $$\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(\\tilde{G}, X) = \\begin{pmatrix} -p_{1} - X & -\\tilde{G} - G_{b} \\\\ 0 & -p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe final step is to evaluate this Jacobian at the basal equilibrium point $(\\tilde{G}_{eq}, X_{eq}) = (0, 0)$:\n$$ J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -p_{1} - 0 & -0 - G_{b} \\\\ 0 & -p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p_{1} & -G_{b} \\\\ 0 & -p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is the Jacobian matrix of the linearized system at the basal equilibrium.\n\nFinally, we discuss the eigenvalues of this Jacobian and the implications for local stability. The Jacobian matrix is an upper triangular matrix. The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries. Therefore, the eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -p_{1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = -p_{2} $$\nThe problem statement specifies that the parameters $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are positive. Consequently, both eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are strictly negative real numbers.\nAccording to linear stability analysis, if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium point have negative real parts, the equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Since both $\\lambda_1 < 0$ and $\\lambda_2 < 0$, the basal equilibrium point $(0, 0)$ is a stable node. This implies that for any small perturbation away from this equilibrium, the system will naturally return to the basal state over time. This mathematical result is consistent with the physiological principle of homeostasis.",

Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor yields\n$$\ne^{p_2 t}\\frac{dX(t)}{dt} + p_2 e^{p_2 t} X(t) = p_3\\left(I_k - I_b\\right) e^{p_2 t}.\n$$\nRecognizing the left-hand side as the derivative of $e^{p_2 t} X(t)$, we write\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{p_2 t} X(t)\\right) = p_3\\left(I_k - I_b\\right) e^{p_2 t}.\n$$\nIntegrating from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta_k$ and denoting $X_k = X(t_k)$ and $X_{k+1} = X(t_{k+1})$, we obtain\n$$\ne^{p_2 t_{k+1}} X_{k+1} - e^{p_2 t_k} X_k = p_3\\left(I_k - I_b\\right) \\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} e^{p_2 s}\\,ds.\n$$\nCompute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} e^{p_2 s}\\,ds = \\frac{1}{p_2}\\left(e^{p_2 t_{k+1}} - e^{p_2 t_k}\\right).\n$$\nSubstitute:\n$$\ne^{p_2 t_{k+1}} X_{k+1} - e^{p_2 t_k} X_k = \\frac{p_3}{p_2}\\left(I_k - I_b\\right)\\left(e^{p_2 t_{k+1}} - e^{p_2 t_k}\\right).\n$$\nDivide both sides by $e^{p_2 t_{k+1}}$:\n$$\nX_{k+1} - e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k} X_k = \\frac{p_3}{p_2}\\left(I_k - I_b\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k}\\right).\n$$\nTherefore, the exact discrete-time mapping is\n$$\nX_{k+1} = \\alpha_k\\,X_k + \\beta_k\\,\\left(I_k - I_b\\right),\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\alpha_k = e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k}, \\qquad \\beta_k = \\frac{p_3}{p_2}\\left(1 - e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k}\\right).\n$$\nThis mapping is exact at the grid points for each interval with constant $I_k$.\n\nFor the forward Euler method, we apply the explicit time-stepping formula on each interval:\n$$\nX_{k+1}^{\\text{Euler}} = X_k + \\Delta_k \\left(-p_2\\,X_k + p_3\\left(I_k - I_b\\right)\\right) = \\left(1 - p_2 \\Delta_k\\right) X_k + \\Delta_k p_3 \\left(I_k - I_b\\right).\n$$\nEuler's method is a first-order accurate scheme, and for the scalar linear decay term $-p_2 X$, its stability with respect to the homogeneous part requires $\\left|1 - p_2 \\Delta_k\\right| < 1$, that is, $0 < p_2 \\Delta_k < 2$. When $p_2 \\Delta_k$ is large, Euler may produce oscillatory or diverging behavior, whereas the exact discretization remains stable because $e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k}$ is always bounded in magnitude by $1$ for $p_2 > 0$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Given $(p_2, p_3, I_b, X_0)$, a grid of lengths $\\{\\Delta_k\\}$, and insulin values $\\{I_k\\}$, compute the exact sequence $\\{X_k\\}$ using $X_{k+1} = e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k} X_k + \\frac{p_3}{p_2}\\left(1 - e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k}\\right)\\left(I_k - I_b\\right)$.\n- Independently compute the forward Euler sequence $\\{X_{k+1}^{\\text{Euler}}\\}$ using $X_{k+1}^{\\text{Euler}} = \\left(1 - p_2 \\Delta_k\\right) X_k + \\Delta_k p_3 \\left(I_k - I_b\\right)$.\n- Compute the Root Mean Square (RMS) absolute error over all steps:\n$$\n\\text{RMS error} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\\left(X_{k+1}^{\\text{Euler}} - X_{k+1}\\right)^2}.\n$$\nThis error is in units of $1/\\text{min}$.\n\nEdge-case behavior in the test suite:\n- Case A uses moderate $p_2$ and interval length, so Euler error is moderate and exact discretization provides a clear improvement.\n- Case B uses very small $\\Delta_k$, so Euler error should be small; exact discretization yields machine-precision agreement at grid points.\n- Case C uses a large $p_2$ and coarse $\\Delta_k$, making $p_2 \\Delta_k \\gg 2$, so Euler can be unstable, leading to large error, whereas the exact discretization remains well-behaved.\n- Case D uses basal insulin throughout, so the forcing term vanishes. The exact solution reduces to pure exponential decay $X_{k+1} = e^{-p_2 \\Delta_k} X_k$, while Euler provides a linearized decay; their difference quantifies discretization error without input.\n\nThe final program implements these computations precisely and prints a single line in the required format with four floating-point RMS error values for cases A, B, C, and D, each in $1/\\text{min}$ units.",
