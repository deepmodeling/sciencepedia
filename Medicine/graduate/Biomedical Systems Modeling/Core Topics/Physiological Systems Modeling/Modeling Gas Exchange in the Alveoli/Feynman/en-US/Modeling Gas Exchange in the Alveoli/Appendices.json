            "solution": "The solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Alveolar Gas Equation and Calculation of $P_{AO_2}$**\n\nThe alveolar gas equation describes the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli ($P_{AO_2}$) and the key determinants of gas exchange. We begin by considering the mass balance for oxygen and carbon dioxide in a single-compartment alveolar model at steady state.\n\nLet $\\dot{V}_A$ be the alveolar ventilation rate, $\\dot{V}_{O_2}$ be the rate of oxygen uptake by the blood, and $\\dot{V}_{CO_2}$ be the rate of carbon dioxide excretion into the alveoli. The fraction of a gas in the alveolar space, $F_{AX}$, is related to its partial pressure, $P_{AX}$, by $P_{AX} = F_{AX} (P_B - P_{H_2O})$, where $(P_B - P_{H_2O})$ is the total pressure of dry gases.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance for oxygen is:\n$$\n\\text{O}_2\\ \\text{in} - \\text{O}_2\\ \\text{out} = \\text{O}_2\\ \\text{uptake} \\\\\n\\dot{V}_A F_{IO_2} - \\dot{V}_A F_{AO_2} = \\dot{V}_{O_2}\n$$\nwhere $F_{IO_2}$ is the fraction of inspired oxygen and $F_{AO_2}$ is the fraction of alveolar oxygen. This assumes the inspired and expired alveolar volumes are equal, a simplification valid when $R=1$ but commonly used for the derivation of the clinical alveolar gas equation.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance for carbon dioxide, assuming the inspired fraction of $CO_2$ is negligible ($F_{I CO_2} \\approx 0$), is:\n$$\n\\text{CO}_2\\ \\text{excreted} = \\text{CO}_2\\ \\text{out} \\\\\n\\dot{V}_{CO_2} = \\dot{V}_A F_{A CO_2}\n$$\nFrom this, we express alveolar ventilation as $\\dot{V}_A = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{F_{A CO_2}}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\dot{V}_A$ into the oxygen balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{F_{A CO_2}} F_{IO_2} - \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{F_{A CO_2}} F_{AO_2} = \\dot{V}_{O_2}\n$$\nMultiplying through by $F_{A CO_2}$ and dividing by $\\dot{V}_{CO_2}$ gives:\n$$\nF_{IO_2} - F_{AO_2} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{O_2}}{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}} F_{A CO_2}\n$$\nThe respiratory quotient $R$ is defined as $R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\\dot{V}_{O_2}}$, so $\\frac{\\dot{V}_{O_2}}{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}} = \\frac{1}{R}$.\n$$\nF_{IO_2} - F_{AO_2} = \\frac{F_{A CO_2}}{R}\n$$\nTo convert from fractions to partial pressures, we multiply the entire equation by $(P_B - P_{H_2O})$:\n$$\nF_{IO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O}) - F_{AO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O}) = \\frac{F_{A CO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O})}{R}\n$$\nRecognizing that $P_{IO_2} = F_{IO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O})$, $P_{AO_2} = F_{AO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O})$, and $P_{A CO_2} = F_{A CO_2}(P_B - P_{H_2O})$, we arrive at the alveolar gas equation:\n$$\nP_{IO_2} - P_{AO_2} = \\frac{P_{A CO_2}}{R}\n$$\nRearranging for $P_{AO_2}$:\n$$\nP_{AO_2} = P_{IO_2} - \\frac{P_{A CO_2}}{R}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. Now, we compute the value of $P_{AO_2}$ using the given data. First, we calculate the partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $P_{IO_2}$:\n$$\nP_{IO_2} = F_{IO_2} (P_B - P_{H_2O}) = 0.21 \\times (760 - 47)\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 0.21 \\times 713\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 149.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the alveolar gas equation:\n$$\nP_{AO_2} = 149.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - \\frac{40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}}{0.8} = 149.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 50\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 99.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation for the Alveolar-Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($P_{AO_2} - P_{aO_2}  0$)**\n\nThe alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, often denoted $\\Delta_{A-a}O_2$ or A-a gradient, is the difference between the oxygen partial pressure in the alveoli and in the arterial blood. In an idealized lung, this gradient would be zero. However, in reality, it is always positive due to physiological imperfections, principally diffusion limitation and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.\n\n1.  **Diffusion Limitation**: This phenomenon is directly described by the model provided. For oxygen to move from the alveolar gas to the capillary blood, it must diffuse across the alveolar-capillary membrane. This process is not instantaneous. The provided differential equation, $\\frac{d P_{cO_2}}{dt} = k (P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2})$, models this explicitly. The rate of rise of capillary oxygen partial pressure ($P_{cO_2}$) is proportional to the driving pressure difference $(P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2})$. Blood enters the capillary with $P_{cO_2}(0) = P_{vO_2}$ and spends a finite time, the transit time $t_c$, traversing the capillary. As $P_{cO_2}$ increases, the driving pressure difference decreases, slowing the rate of equilibration. Consequently, $P_{cO_2}(t)$ approaches $P_{AO_2}$ asymptotically. Because $t_c$ is finite, equilibration will be incomplete, meaning that at the end of the capillary, $P_{cO_2}(t_c)$ will be less than $P_{AO_2}$. Since $P_{aO_2} = P_{cO_2}(t_c)$ in this no-shunt model, it follows directly that $P_{AO_2} - P_{aO_2}  0$. This gradient becomes larger if the transit time $t_c$ is shortened (e.g., during exercise) or if the diffusion capacity (related to $k$) is reduced (e.g., in diseases like pulmonary fibrosis).\n\n2.  **Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Mismatch**: Although the provided model is a single compartment (and thus has a single V/Q ratio), a real lung consists of millions of lung units, each with its own V/Q ratio.\n    -   Units with low V/Q ratios (poor ventilation relative to perfusion) have alveolar gas composition that approaches mixed venous blood (low $P_{AO_2}$, high $P_{ACO_2}$). Blood leaving these units is poorly oxygenated.\n    -   Units with high V/Q ratios (high ventilation relative to perfusion) have alveolar gas composition that approaches inspired air (high $P_{AO_2}$, low $P_{ACO_2}$). Blood leaving these units is well-oxygenated.\n    Arterial blood is the mixture of blood from all these units. The key is the non-linear, sigmoidal shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which relates $P_{O_2}$ to oxygen content. Because of the curve's shape, the high $P_{O_2}$ of blood from high-V/Q units cannot compensate for the low oxygen content of blood from low-V/Q units (as hemoglobin is already nearly saturated at high $P_{O_2}$). When the blood from all units mixes, the resulting total oxygen content corresponds to an arterial $P_{aO_2}$ that is lower than the mean alveolar $P_{AO_2}$ of the lung, creating an A-a gradient.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Alveolar-Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($\\Delta_{A-a}O_2$)**\n\nWe must solve the given first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $P_{cO_2}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_{cO_2}}{dt} = k (P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2})\n$$\nwith the initial condition $P_{cO_2}(0) = P_{vO_2}$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_{cO_2}}{dt} + k P_{cO_2} = k P_{AO_2}\n$$\nThis is a standard form whose solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Alternatively, we can use separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_{cO_2}}{P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2}} = k dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to a general time $t$, and from $P_{cO_2}(0)=P_{vO_2}$ to $P_{cO_2}(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{P_{vO_2}}^{P_{cO_2}(t)} \\frac{dP'_{cO_2}}{P_{AO_2} - P'_{cO_2}} = \\int_0^t k dt'\n$$\n$$\n[-\\ln(P_{AO_2} - P'_{cO_2})]_{P_{vO_2}}^{P_{cO_2}(t)} = [kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2}(t)) + \\ln(P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) = kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}}{P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2}(t)}\\right) = kt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}}{P_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2}(t)} = \\exp(kt)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $P_{cO_2}(t)$:\n$$\nP_{AO_2} - P_{cO_2}(t) = (P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nP_{cO_2}(t) = P_{AO_2} - (P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe arterial oxygen partial pressure, $P_{aO_2}$, is the value of $P_{cO_2}$ at the end of the capillary transit time, $t_c$.\n$$\nP_{aO_2} = P_{cO_2}(t_c) = P_{AO_2} - (P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) \\exp(-k t_c)\n$$\nThe alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta_{A\\!-\\!a} O_2 = P_{AO_2} - P_{aO_2} = P_{AO_2} - \\left[ P_{AO_2} - (P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) \\exp(-k t_c) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{A\\!-\\!a} O_2 = (P_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2}) \\exp(-k t_c)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n- $P_{AO_2} = 99.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{vO_2} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $k = 5.545\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $t_c = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe initial pressure difference is:\n$$\nP_{AO_2} - P_{vO_2} = 99.73 - 40 = 59.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nThe exponential term is:\n$$\n-k t_c = -5.545\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 0.25\\ \\mathrm{s} = -1.38625\n$$\nSo, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{A\\!-\\!a} O_2 = (59.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}) \\exp(-1.38625)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{A\\!-\\!a} O_2 \\approx (59.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}) \\times 0.25001403 = 14.933306...\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the final result is $14.93\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.",

Then the two measurement conditions yield the linear system\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{L,1}} = X + \\frac{1}{\\theta_1}\\,Y,\\qquad \\frac{1}{D_{L,2}} = X + \\frac{1}{\\theta_2}\\,Y.\n$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second eliminates $X$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{L,2}} - \\frac{1}{D_{L,1}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta_2} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_1}\\right) Y,\n$$\nwhich gives\n$$\nY = \\frac{\\frac{1}{D_{L,2}} - \\frac{1}{D_{L,1}}}{\\frac{1}{\\theta_2} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_1}}.\n$$\nCompute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{L,1}} = \\frac{1}{42.0} \\approx 0.0238095238\\ \\mathrm{min}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot\\mathrm{mL}^{-1},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{L,2}} = \\frac{1}{15.7} \\approx 0.0636942675\\ \\mathrm{min}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot\\mathrm{mL}^{-1},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\theta_2} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_1} = 4.16 - 1.16 = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{min}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nY = \\frac{0.0636942675 - 0.0238095238}{3.00} \\approx \\frac{0.0398847437}{3.00} \\approx 0.0132949146\\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}.\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\nV_c = \\frac{1}{Y} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0132949146} \\approx 75.2\\ \\mathrm{mL}.\n$$\n\nNext, solve for $X$ from the first equation:\n$$\nX = \\frac{1}{D_{L,1}} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_1}\\,Y = 0.0238095238 - 1.16\\times 0.0132949146 \\approx 0.0238095238 - 0.015422101 \\approx 0.0083874228\\ \\mathrm{min}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nD_M = \\frac{1}{X} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0083874228} \\approx 119\\ \\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}.\n$$\n\nRounded to three significant figures:\n- $D_M \\approx 119\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$,\n- $V_c \\approx 75.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nThese estimates are physiologically plausible and consistent with the measured $D_{L,CO}$ values and the oxygen-tension dependence of $\\theta$.",
