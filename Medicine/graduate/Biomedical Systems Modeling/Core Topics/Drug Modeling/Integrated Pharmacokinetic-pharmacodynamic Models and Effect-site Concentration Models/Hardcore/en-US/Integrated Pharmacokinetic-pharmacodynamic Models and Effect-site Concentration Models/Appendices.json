It provides a standard problem in pharmacokinetics based on fundamental principles of mass balance and linear system dynamics. All necessary parameters are provided, and the questions are unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in formulating and solving a mass balance equation for the amount of drug in the body. Let $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the central compartment (in mg) at time $t$ (in hours, h), and let $C(t)$ be the corresponding concentration (in mg/L).\n\nThe model is a one-compartment model with a single intravenous bolus dose at $t=0$ and linear elimination. The fundamental principle of mass balance states that the rate of change of the amount of drug in the compartment is equal to the rate of input minus the rate of output.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out}\n$$\nFor a single bolus at $t=0$, the rate of input is zero for all $t  0$.

First, the governing system of equations is formally stated. Second, a detailed numerical algorithm is designed to compute the specified hysteresis index, $A$.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Coupled System of Differential Equations\n\nThe problem describes a system with three time-varying state variables: the plasma drug concentration $C_{p}(t)$, the effect-site drug concentration $C_{e}(t)$, and the time-dependent half-maximal effective concentration $EC_{50}(t)$. The dynamics of these states are governed by the fundamental principles of mass balance and effect modeling provided.\n\nLet the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [y_1(t), y_2(t), y_3(t)]^T = [C_{p}(t), C_{e}(t), EC_{50}(t)]^T$. The coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations is given by:\n\n1.  **Plasma Concentration ($C_{p}(t)$):** The rate of change of plasma concentration is determined by the zero-order drug infusion and first-order elimination. The elimination rate constant is $k_{el} = CL/V$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dC_{p}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{R}{V}\\,u(t;0,T_{\\text{inf}}) - \\frac{CL}{V}\\,C_{p}(t)\n    $$\n    Here, $u(t;0,T_{\\text{inf}})$ is a step function that is $1$ during the infusion period $0 \\le t \\le T_{\\text{inf}}$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\n2.  **Effect-Site Concentration ($C_{e}(t)$):** The rate of change of the effect-site concentration is modeled as a first-order process, driven by the difference between plasma and effect-site concentrations. The rate constant is $k_{e0}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dC_{e}(t)}{dt} = k_{e0}\\left(C_{p}(t) - C_{e}(t)\\right)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Dynamic Half-Maximal Effective Concentration ($EC_{50}(t)$):** Acute tolerance is modeled by an increase in $EC_{50}(t)$ proportional to the effect-site concentration $C_{e}(t)$, with a gain constant $\\kappa$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\,EC_{50}(t)}{dt} = \\kappa\\,C_{e}(t)\n    $$\n\nThe system is fully defined with the initial conditions at time $t=0$:\n$$\nC_{p}(0) = 0, \\quad C_{e}(0) = 0, \\quad EC_{50}(0) = EC_{50,0}\n$$\nThis forms a non-homogeneous linear system of ODEs for the states $[C_p, C_e, EC_{50}]$, which must be solved to find the system's trajectory over time.

A non-zero index arises from a temporal dissociation between $C_p$ and $E$, caused by either the delay in effect-site equilibration (governed by $k_{e0}$) or the development of acute tolerance (governed by $\\kappa$). The following algorithm details the numerical procedure to compute $A$.\n\n1.  **Numerical Solution of the ODE System:**\n    The system of three coupled ODEs is solved numerically over the time interval $[0, T_{\\text{end}}]$. A robust adaptive step-size solver, such as a Runge-Kutta method (e.g., `RK45`), is employed. The solver is configured to output the solution at a fine-grained set of time points, $t_i$, ensuring that the infusion end time, $T_{\\text{inf}}$, is included as one of these points. This yields discrete time series for the state variables: $C_{p}(t_i)$, $C_{e}(t_i)$, and $EC_{50}(t_i)$.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Pharmacodynamic Effect:**\n    Using the solved trajectories for $C_{e}(t_i)$ and $EC_{50}(t_i)$, the corresponding effect $E(t_i)$ is calculated at each time point $t_i$ using the Hill equation. This produces a time series $E(t_i)$.\n\n3.  **Identification of Ascending and Descending Branches:**\n    The plasma concentration $C_p(t)$ increases during the infusion phase and decreases during the elimination phase. The time of peak plasma concentration, $t_{peak}$, is at $t = T_{\\text{inf}}$ for this one-compartment model under constant infusion. The solution is thus partitioned into two branches:\n    -   **Ascending Branch:** The set of pairs $(C_{p}(t_i), E(t_i))$ for all $t_i \\le T_{\\text{inf}}$.\n    -   **Descending Branch:** The set of pairs $(C_{p}(t_i), E(t_i))$ for all $t_i \\ge T_{\\text{inf}}$.\n\n4.  **Interpolation and Integration Grid:**\n    To compute the integral for $A$, the effect functions $E_{\\uparrow}(c)$ and $E_{\\downarrow}(c)$ must be evaluated over a common domain of concentration values, $c$.\n    -   **Determine Integration Range:** The overlapping range of $C_p$ values is $[C_{p, \\text{lower}}, C_{p, \\text{upper}}]$. For this model, $C_{p, \\text{upper}}$ is the peak concentration $C_p(T_{\\text{inf}})$, and $C_{p, \\text{lower}}$ is the concentration at the end of the simulation, $C_p(T_{\\text{end}})$.\n    -   **Create Grid:** A uniform grid of concentration values, $c_j$, is created spanning this range: $c_j \\in [C_{p, \\text{lower}}, C_{p, \\text{upper}}]$. The density of this grid (e.g., $1000$ points) determines the precision of the subsequent integration.\n    -   **Interpolate Effect:** Linear interpolation is used to find the effect values on each branch corresponding to the grid points $c_j$.\n        -   $E_{\\uparrow}(c_j)$ is found by interpolating the ascending branch data $(C_{p, \\text{asc}}, E_{\\text{asc}})$.\n        -   $E_{\\downarrow}(c_j)$ is found by interpolating the descending branch data $(C_{p, \\text{desc}}, E_{\\text{desc}})$. Note that the $C_p$ values on the descending branch are decreasing, so the data arrays must be reversed to satisfy the monotonicity requirement of standard interpolation functions.\n\n5.  **Numerical Integration:**\n    The hysteresis index $A$ is the definite integral of the difference between the descending and ascending effect functions over the common concentration range.\n    $$\n    A = \\int_{C_{p, \\text{lower}}}^{C_{p, \\text{upper}}} \\left[E_{\\downarrow}(c) - E_{\\uparrow}(c)\\right]\\,dc\n    $$\n    This integral is computed numerically using the trapezoidal rule on the constructed grid:\n    $$\n    A \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \\frac{\\left(E_{\\downarrow}(c_{j+1}) - E_{\\uparrow}(c_{j+1})\\right) + \\left(E_{\\downarrow}(c_{j}) - E_{\\uparrow}(c_{j})\\right)}{2} (c_{j+1} - c_{j})\n    $$\n    where $N$ is the number of points in the concentration grid.\n\nThis algorithm provides a robust and accurate method to compute the hysteresis index for the given PK/PD model and parameter sets. The implementation will use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for the ODE solution and `numpy.interp` and `numpy.trapz` for interpolation and integration, respectively.",
