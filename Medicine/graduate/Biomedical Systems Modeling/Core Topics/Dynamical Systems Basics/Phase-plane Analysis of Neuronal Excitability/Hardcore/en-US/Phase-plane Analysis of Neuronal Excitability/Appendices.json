Geometrically, fixed points are the intersection points of the $V$-nullcline and the $w$-nullcline.

The problem states that a relaxation oscillation exists, which implies this fixed point is unstable.\n\nThe core of the phase-plane analysis in the singular limit involves constructing the limit cycle by concatenating segments of slow and fast motion.\n1.  **Slow Motion**: The trajectory evolves slowly, constrained to the stable branches of the $v$-nullcline, $w = v - \\frac{v^3}{3}$. This occurs because for $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ is very small, while $\\frac{dv}{dt}$ is large unless the state is very close to the $v$-nullcline.\n2.  **Fast Motion**: When the trajectory reaches a point where the $v$-nullcline loses stability, it undergoes a rapid transition. These points are the local extrema, or \"knees,\" of the cubic nullcline. During this fast jump, $\\frac{dw}{dt} \\approx 0$, so $w$ remains approximately constant. The trajectory moves horizontally in the $(v, w)$-plane.\n\nLet's find the knees of the cubic $v$-nullcline, which we denote as $f(v) = v - \\frac{v^3}{3}$.

At this point, the slow manifold becomes unstable, and a fast jump occurs. The jump proceeds horizontally at a constant $w$-value of $w = \\frac{2}{3}$. The jump terminates when the trajectory intersects a stable branch of the $v$-nullcline. To find the landing point, we solve for $v$ using the nullcline equation with $w = \\frac{2}{3}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} = v - \\frac{v^3}{3}\n$$\nMultiplying by $3$ and rearranging gives a cubic equation for $v$:\n$$\n2 = 3v - v^3 \\implies v^3 - 3v + 2 = 0\n$$\nSince the jump originates from a knee, the starting $v$-coordinate, $v=1$, must be a double root of this polynomial. We can factor out $(v-1)^2$:\n$$\n(v-1)^2(v+2) = (v^2 - 2v + 1)(v+2) = v^3 + 2v^2 - 2v^2 - 4v + v + 2 = v^3 - 3v + 2\n$$\nThe roots are $v=1$ (double root) and $v=-2$. The fast jump is from $v=1$ to $v=-2$. The landing point on the left stable branch of the nullcline is $(-2, \\frac{2}{3})$.\n\n**Segment 2: Slow motion on the left branch.**\nFrom the landing point $(-2, \\frac{2}{3})$, the system evolves slowly along the cubic $v$-nullcline towards the left knee at $(-1, -\\frac{2}{3})$.\n\n**Segment 3: Fast jump from the left knee.**\nUpon reaching the left knee at $(-1, -\\frac{2}{3})$, another fast jump occurs at a constant $w$-value of $w = -\\frac{2}{3}$. To find the landing point on the right stable branch, we solve for $v$:\n$$\n-\\frac{2}{3} = v - \\frac{v^3}{3}\n$$\n$$\n-2 = 3v - v^3 \\implies v^3 - 3v - 2 = 0\n$$\nThe starting coordinate $v=-1$ must be a double root. Factoring out $(v+1)^2$:\n$$\n(v+1)^2(v-2) = (v^2 + 2v + 1)(v-2) = v^3 - 2v^2 + 2v^2 - 4v + v - 2 = v^3 - 3v - 2\n$$\nThe roots are $v=-1$ (double root) and $v=2$. The fast jump is from $v=-1$ to $v=2$. The landing point is $(2, -\\frac{2}{3})$.\n\n**Segment 4: Slow motion on the right branch.**\nFrom $(2, -\\frac{2}{3})$, the system evolves slowly along the right branch of the cubic nullcline back towards the right knee at $(1, \\frac{2}{3})$, completing the limit cycle.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation in the $v$-variable is defined as $v_{\\max} - v_{\\min}$. By tracing the path of the limit cycle, we can identify the extremal values of $v$:\n- The trajectory includes the fast jump from $v=-1$ to $v=2$. The maximum value of $v$ reached is at the end of this jump, so $v_{\\max} = 2$.\n- The trajectory includes the fast jump from $v=1$ to $v=-2$. The minimum value of $v$ reached is at the end of this jump, so $v_{\\min} = -2$.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Amplitude} = v_{\\max} - v_{\\min} = 2 - (-2) = 4\n$$",
