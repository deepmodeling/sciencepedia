The system is described by the matrix differential equation $\\dot{x}=A x$, with the matrix $A$ provided.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem must be ascertained.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The system is an LTI model: $\\dot{x}=A x$.\n- The state vector $x=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ represents deviations from steady-state concentrations of mRNA ($x_{1}$) and protein ($x_{2}$).\n- The system matrix is $A=\\begin{bmatrix} -1  0\\\\ 3  -2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- The rate constants have units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- The definition of the dominant decay rate, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$, is the positive scalar such that the slowest decaying mode behaves asymptotically as $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard approach in systems biology: modeling biochemical reaction networks near a steady state using a linearized system of ordinary differential equations. The matrix $A$ represents a simple cascade where a species (mRNA) is produced and degrades, and in turn produces a second species (protein) which also degrades. The matrix entries have a clear physical interpretation: the diagonal elements ($-1$, $-2$) are first-order decay rates, and the off-diagonal element ($3$) is a production rate.

The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution involves three main steps as requested by the problem statement: deriving the eigenvalues, assessing stability, and determining the dominant decay rate.\n\n**Derivation of Eigenvalues**\nThe eigenvalues, denoted by $\\lambda$, of the matrix $A$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nThe matrix $A - \\lambda I$ is:\n$$\nA - \\lambda I = \\begin{bmatrix} -1  0\\\\ 3  -2 \\end{bmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0\\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1-\\lambda  0\\\\ 3  -2-\\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (-1-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda) - (3)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (1+\\lambda)(2+\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 2\n$$\nSetting the characteristic polynomial to zero yields the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a simple quadratic equation which can be factored:\n$$\n(\\lambda + 1)(\\lambda + 2) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are the eigenvalues of $A$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = -2\n$$\n\n**Stability Classification**\nThe stability of the equilibrium point (the origin, $x=0$) is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues.\nThe eigenvalues are both real numbers.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -1  0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -2  0\n$$\nSince all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts, the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. This means that any small perturbation from the steady state will decay back to the steady state over time.\n\n**Inference of the Dominant Decay Rate, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$**\nThe general solution of the system is a linear combination of the modal components, $x(t) = c_1 v_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) + c_2 v_2 \\exp(\\lambda_2 t)$, where $v_1, v_2$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$, and $c_1, c_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe two temporal modes are $\\exp(\\lambda_1 t) = \\exp(-t)$ and $\\exp(\\lambda_2 t) = \\exp(-2t)$.\nThe decay rate of a mode $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ is given by $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)$.\nFor the first mode, the decay rate is $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -(-1) = 1$.\nFor the second mode, the decay rate is $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nThe \"slowest decaying mode\" is the one with the smallest decay rate. In this case, the smallest decay rate is $1$. This corresponds to the eigenvalue with the real part closest to zero, which is $\\lambda_1 = -1$. This is the dominant eigenvalue, as its corresponding mode, $\\exp(-t)$, will persist the longest as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem defines $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ as the positive scalar such that the slowest decaying mode behaves asymptotically like $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)$.\nThe slowest decaying mode is $\\exp(-t)$.\nBy direct comparison:\n$$\n\\exp(-t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)\n$$\nThis implies that $k_{\\mathrm{dom}} = 1$. The units of $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ are inherited from the eigenvalues, which are $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem requires the value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{dom}} = 1.00\n$$",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of the system $\\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt} = A\\vec{x}$ begins with the determination of the eigenstructure of the matrix $A$.\n\n**1. Eigenstructure of A**\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}0  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}-\\lambda  1 \\\\ 0  -1-\\lambda\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial is $(-\\lambda)(-1-\\lambda) - (1)(0) = \\lambda(\\lambda+1) = 0$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\n\n**2. Stability Classification**\nFor a linear time-invariant system, the stability of the equilibrium at the origin is determined by the real parts of the eigenvalues of $A$.\n- The origin is **asymptotically stable** if and only if all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)  0$).\n- The origin is **Lyapunov stable** if and only if all eigenvalues have non-positive real parts ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i) \\leq 0$), and for any eigenvalue with zero real part, its algebraic multiplicity equals its geometric multiplicity (i.e., it is semisimple).\n- The origin is **unstable** otherwise.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\nThe real parts are $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 0$ and $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -1$.\nSince one eigenvalue has a real part of zero, the system is not asymptotically stable.\nWe must check the condition for Lyapunov stability. All eigenvalues have non-positive real parts. Now we examine the eigenvalue on the imaginary axis, $\\lambda_1=0$.\nThe algebraic multiplicity of $\\lambda_1 = 0$ is $1$.\nThe geometric multiplicity of $\\lambda_1 = 0$ is the dimension of the null space of $(A - 0I)$, which is $\\text{Null}(A)$. We find the vectors $\\vec{v}$ such that $A\\vec{v} = \\vec{0}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}0  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} \\implies v_2 = 0\n$$\nThe null space is spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$, so its dimension is $1$.\nThe geometric multiplicity of $\\lambda_1 = 0$ is $1$, which equals its algebraic multiplicity. Therefore, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=0$ is semisimple.\nThe conditions for Lyapunov stability are met.\nThus, the equilibrium at the origin is **Lyapunov stable** but not asymptotically stable.\n\n**3. Invariant Subspaces and Qualitative Dynamics**\nThe invariant subspaces are the eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues.\n- **Eigenspace for $\\lambda_1 = 0$ (Center Subspace):**\nThe eigenvector $\\vec{v}_1$ corresponding to $\\lambda_1=0$ is a basis for the null space of $A$. We can choose $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$. The invariant subspace is the span of $\\vec{v}_1$, which is the $x_1$-axis. This is the center subspace, $E_0 = \\text{span}\\{\\vec{v}_1\\}$.\nAny trajectory starting in this subspace, $\\vec{x}(0) = c_1 \\vec{v}_1$, evolves as $\\vec{x}(t) = \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) c_1 \\vec{v}_1 = \\exp(0) c_1 \\vec{v}_1 = c_1 \\vec{v}_1$. This means that any point on the $x_1$-axis is an equilibrium point. The system possesses a line of equilibria.\n\n- **Eigenspace for $\\lambda_2 = -1$ (Stable Subspace):**\nThe eigenvector $\\vec{v}_2$ for $\\lambda_2=-1$ is found by solving $(A - (-1)I)\\vec{v}_2 = \\vec{0}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} \\implies v_1 + v_2 = 0\n$$\nWe can choose $\\vec{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix}$. The invariant subspace is the stable subspace, $E_{-1} = \\text{span}\\{\\vec{v}_2\\}$, which is the line $x_2 = -x_1$.\nAny trajectory starting in this subspace, $\\vec{x}(0) = c_2 \\vec{v}_2$, evolves as $\\vec{x}(t) = \\exp(\\lambda_2 t) c_2 \\vec{v}_2 = \\exp(-t) c_2 \\vec{v}_2$. Trajectories starting on this line decay exponentially to the origin.\n\n- **Asymptotic Behavior for General Initial Conditions:**\nAny initial state $\\vec{x}(0)$ can be decomposed as $\\vec{x}(0) = c_1\\vec{v}_1 + c_2\\vec{v}_2$. The solution is then $\\vec{x}(t) = c_1\\exp(0t)\\vec{v}_1 + c_2\\exp(-t)\\vec{v}_2 = c_1\\vec{v}_1 + c_2\\exp(-t)\\vec{v}_2$.\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-t) \\to 0$, so $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\vec{x}(t) = c_1\\vec{v}_1$. This means every trajectory asymptotically approaches a point on the line of equilibria (the $x_1$-axis). The component in the stable direction decays to zero, while the component in the center direction remains constant.\n\n**4. Derivation of the State Transition Matrix $\\Phi(t)$**\nThe state transition matrix $\\Phi(t) = \\exp(At)$ can be computed using the eigen-decomposition $A = PDP^{-1}$, where $P$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $D$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then $\\Phi(t) = P\\exp(Dt)P^{-1}$.\nFrom our previous analysis, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0, \\lambda_2 = -1$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\vec{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrices $D$ and $P$ are:\n$$\nD = \\begin{pmatrix}0  0 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad P = \\begin{pmatrix}\\vec{v}_1  \\vec{v}_2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we find the inverse of $P$:\n$$\nP^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(1)(-1) - (1)(0)}\\begin{pmatrix}-1  -1 \\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix} = -1\\begin{pmatrix}-1  -1 \\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix exponential of $D$ is:\n$$\n\\exp(Dt) = \\begin{pmatrix}\\exp(0t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\Phi(t) = P\\exp(Dt)P^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, multiply the last two matrices:\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1  1 \\\\ 0  -\\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, perform the remaining multiplication:\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) + (1)(0)  (1)(1) + (1)(-\\exp(-t)) \\\\ (0)(1) + (-1)(0)  (0)(1) + (-1)(-\\exp(-t)) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  1-\\exp(-t) \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the state transition matrix $\\Phi(t)$.",
