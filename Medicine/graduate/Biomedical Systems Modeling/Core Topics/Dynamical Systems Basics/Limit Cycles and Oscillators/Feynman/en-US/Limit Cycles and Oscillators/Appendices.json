Biological rhythms, from heartbeats to circadian clocks, must be stable and robust against inevitable environmental noise and parameter fluctuations. This conceptual exercise challenges you to compare a structurally stable limit cycle—an isolated periodic orbit that attracts nearby trajectories—with a fragile linear center, clarifying why the limit cycle is the fundamental archetype for modeling real-world biological oscillators.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents two well-defined, classical models of planar oscillators from the theory of ordinary differential equations and asks for an analysis based on fundamental, well-established concepts such as periodic orbits, limit cycles, and stability. The models are scientifically and mathematically sound, and the problem is self-contained and unambiguous.\n\nWe will analyze each model first, then evaluate the given options.\n\n**Analysis of Model L**\n\nThe system is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ as:\n$$\n\\dot r = r\\left(\\alpha - r^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot \\theta = \\omega\n$$\nwith constants $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\omega > 0$.\n\nThe radial dynamics equation, $\\dot r = r(\\alpha - r^2)$, can be analyzed as a one-dimensional system for $r \\ge 0$. The fixed points are found by setting $\\dot r = 0$, which gives $r=0$ or $\\alpha - r^2 = 0$. Since $r \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, the fixed points are $r=0$ and $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe stability of these fixed points for the radial dynamics is determined by the sign of $\\dot r$:\n- For $0 < r < \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $r^2 < \\alpha$, so $\\dot r = r(\\alpha - r^2) > 0$. The radius $r$ increases.\n- For $r > \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $r^2 > \\alpha$, so $\\dot r = r(\\alpha - r^2) < 0$. The radius $r$ decreases.\n\nThis shows that $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ is a stable fixed point for the radial dynamics, while $r=0$ is an unstable fixed point.\nIn the full 2D system:\n- When $r(t) = \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $\\dot r = 0$. The angular dynamics are $\\dot \\theta = \\omega$, which integrates to $\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 + \\omega t$. This describes a circular trajectory with radius $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ and period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$. This is a periodic orbit.\n- Since all trajectories with initial radius $r_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $r_0 \\neq \\sqrt{\\alpha}$ converge to the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ as $t \\to \\infty$, this periodic orbit is asymptotically stable.\n- A limit cycle is an isolated periodic orbit. In this system, the only periodic orbit (besides the trivial fixed point at the origin) is the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Therefore, it is an isolated periodic orbit and, by definition, a limit cycle.\n- A limit cycle is hyperbolic if its Floquet multipliers are not on the unit circle (except for the one multiplier that is always $1$). The stability of the limit cycle in the direction transverse to the orbit is governed by the linearization of the radial dynamics around $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Let $f(r) = r(\\alpha-r^2)$. Then $f'(r) = \\alpha - 3r^2$. At the limit cycle, $f'(\\sqrt{\\alpha}) = \\alpha - 3\\alpha = -2\\alpha$. Since $-2\\alpha < 0$, the cycle is strongly attracting. This corresponds to a Floquet multiplier $e^{-2\\alpha T} \\in (0,1)$, which is not on the unit circle. Thus, the limit cycle is hyperbolic.\n- Hyperbolic limit cycles are structurally stable. They persist under small, smooth perturbations of the vector field.\n\n**Analysis of Model C**\n\nThe system is given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ as:\n$$\n\\dot x = -\\omega y\n$$\n$$\n\\dot y = \\omega x\n$$\nwith $\\omega > 0$. This is a linear system. To analyze its trajectories, we can convert to polar coordinates using $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. From this, we have $r^2 = x^2+y^2$. Differentiating with respect to time:\n$$\n2r\\dot r = 2x\\dot x + 2y\\dot y \\implies r\\dot r = x(-\\omega y) + y(\\omega x) = 0\n$$\nFor $r\\neq 0$, this implies $\\dot r = 0$. The radius is constant for any trajectory.\nDifferentiating $\\tan\\theta = y/x$ with respect to time:\n$$\n(\\sec^2\\theta)\\dot\\theta = \\frac{x\\dot y - y\\dot x}{x^2} = \\frac{x(\\omega x) - y(-\\omega y)}{x^2} = \\frac{\\omega(x^2+y^2)}{x^2} = \\frac{\\omega r^2}{r^2\\cos^2\\theta} = \\omega \\sec^2\\theta\n$$\nThis implies $\\dot\\theta = \\omega$.\nSo, in polar coordinates, Model C is $\\dot r=0$, $\\dot\\theta=\\omega$.\n- For any initial condition $(x_0, y_0) \\neq (0,0)$ with initial radius $r_0 = \\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}$, the trajectory is a circle of radius $r_0$ traversed with constant angular velocity $\\omega$.\n- This means there is a continuous family of periodic orbits, one for every radius $r_0 > 0$.\n- These periodic orbits are not isolated, so they are not limit cycles.\n- The orbits are neutrally stable (or Lyapunov stable): a small perturbation moves the system to a nearby orbit, and it stays there.\n- Such systems, called centers, are not structurally stable. A generic small perturbation will destroy the entire family of periodic orbits.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In Model L, there exists a unique periodic orbit at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ that is an isolated, asymptotically stable limit cycle (hyperbolic), and it persists under sufficiently small smooth perturbations of the vector field.**\nOur analysis of Model L confirms every part of this statement. There is a single, non-trivial periodic orbit at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. It is isolated because it is the only one. It is asymptotically stable because all nearby trajectories converge to it. It is hyperbolic because the transverse eigenvalue is non-zero (it is $-2\\alpha$). As a hyperbolic limit cycle, it is structurally stable and persists under small smooth perturbations.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In Model C, closed trajectories exist for every $r>0$, but they are not isolated; generically, an arbitrarily small dissipative perturbation of the vector field destroys all nontrivial periodic orbits by converting the center into a focus, so oscillations are not robust.**\nOur analysis of Model C showed that there is a periodic orbit (a circle) for every initial radius $r_0 > 0$. This is a continuum of orbits, so they are not isolated. A dissipative perturbation, such as linear damping $\\dot{x} = -\\omega y - \\epsilon x, \\dot{y} = \\omega x - \\epsilon y$ for small $\\epsilon > 0$, changes the radial dynamics. We calculate $r\\dot{r} = x\\dot{x} + y\\dot{y} = x(-\\omega y - \\epsilon x) + y(\\omega x - \\epsilon y) = -\\epsilon(x^2+y^2) = -\\epsilon r^2$, which implies $\\dot{r} = -\\epsilon r$. For any $r_0 > 0$, the radius decays exponentially, $r(t) = r_0 e^{-\\epsilon t}$. All trajectories spiral into the origin, which becomes a stable focus. No non-trivial periodic orbits remain. This demonstrates the fragility (lack of robustness) of the oscillations in a center.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In Model C, adding weak linear damping, $\\dot x = -\\omega y - \\epsilon x,\\qquad \\dot y = \\omega x - \\epsilon y,\\qquad \\epsilon>0$, yields a family of closed trajectories with slowly decaying amplitude; hence periodic orbits persist but are weakly stable.**\nThis statement is contradictory. A trajectory with decaying amplitude cannot be a closed trajectory (a periodic orbit), which by definition must return to its starting state. As shown in the analysis for option B, this perturbation leads to $\\dot r = -\\epsilon r$. For any solution starting with $r(0) > 0$, the radius is strictly decreasing. Therefore, no periodic orbits exist for $r>0$. The statement that \"periodic orbits persist\" is false. The system's trajectories are spirals, not closed orbits.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In Model L, if one perturbs only the angular dynamics to $\\dot r = r\\left(\\alpha - r^2\\right),\\qquad \\dot \\theta = \\omega + \\epsilon h(r,\\theta)$, with sufficiently small $\\epsilon$ and smooth $h$, then the asymptotic orbital stability of the $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ periodic orbit is destroyed even though the radial equation is unchanged.**\nThe asymptotic orbital stability of the limit cycle at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ is determined by the behavior of trajectories near this circle. The radial dynamics, $\\dot r = r(\\alpha-r^2)$, are exclusively responsible for the attraction to the circle. Since this equation is unchanged, any trajectory starting at a radius $r_0 \\neq \\sqrt{\\alpha}$ will still have its radius converge to $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. The perturbation in $\\dot\\theta$ only changes the speed of travel along trajectories, but does not affect their tendency to approach the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Therefore, the asymptotic orbital stability is preserved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. In Model C, the function $H(x,y)=\\tfrac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ is conserved; within the restricted class of small Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve a nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian at the origin, a one-parameter family of nearby closed orbits persists as level sets of the perturbed Hamiltonian, so oscillations are robust within that conservative class even though they are not robust generically.**\nFor Model C, we can check the time derivative of $H(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$: $\\frac{dH}{dt} = x\\dot x + y\\dot y = x(-\\omega y) + y(\\omega x) = 0$. So $H$ is a conserved quantity. The system is Hamiltonian with Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}(x,y) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ since $\\dot x = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y}$ and $\\dot y = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x}$ is not quite right. A correct Hamiltonian is $\\mathcal{H}(x,y) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}(x^2+y^2)$, leading to $\\dot x = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y} = \\omega y$, $\\dot y = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x} = -\\omega x$. This is a center with opposite rotation. Let's use the given vector field. For $\\dot x = -\\omega y, \\dot y = \\omega x$, a Hamiltonian is $\\mathcal{H}(x,y) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}(x^2+y^2)$, but with the non-canonical structure matrix $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. More simply, the system is Hamiltonian in the standard sense if we let $\\mathcal{H}(x,y) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}(x^2+y^2)$, then $\\dot x = -\\omega y = -\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y}$ and $\\dot y = \\omega x = \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x}$, which corresponds to Poisson bracket mechanics. However, the essential point is that it is a conservative system whose trajectories are level sets of an energy function $H(x,y) = \\text{const}$. The function $H(x,y)=\\tfrac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ has a nondegenerate minimum at the origin. A small perturbation that keeps the system Hamiltonian, i.e., of the form $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = J\\nabla \\mathcal{H}_{pert}$ for a perturbed Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{pert}$, will still have its trajectories confined to level sets of $\\mathcal{H}_{pert}$. If $\\mathcal{H}_{pert}$ retains a nondegenerate minimum at the origin, its level sets near the origin will be a family of closed curves. These are the persistent periodic orbits. Therefore, oscillations are indeed robust within the class of Hamiltonian perturbations, which is a key distinction from generic, non-Hamiltonian perturbations.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

You will learn to estimate the features of a limit cycle by assuming a simple periodic form for the solution and ensuring the fundamental frequency components of the governing equation are satisfied.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the amplitude $A$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ of the approximate periodic solution to the Van der Pol equation using the method of first-harmonic balance.\n\nThe governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} - \\mu \\left(1 - x^{2}\\right)\\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mu > 0$ is a small parameter.\n\nThe problem states to assume an approximate solution of the form:\n$$\nx(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nwhere $A > 0$ and $\\omega > 0$ are the unknown amplitude and angular frequency, respectively.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary derivatives of the assumed solution $x(t)$:\nThe first derivative with respect to time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe second derivative with respect to time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} = -A \\omega^{2} \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute $x(t)$ and its derivatives into the Van der Pol equation. This will produce a residual term, $R(t)$, which is not identically zero because our assumed solution is an approximation.\n$$\nR(t) = \\left(-A \\omega^{2} \\cos(\\omega t)\\right) - \\mu \\left(1 - \\left(A \\cos(\\omega t)\\right)^{2}\\right)\\left(-A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t)\\right) + \\left(A \\cos(\\omega t)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying and rearranging the expression for $R(t)$:\n$$\nR(t) = (A - A \\omega^{2}) \\cos(\\omega t) + \\mu A \\omega \\left(1 - A^{2} \\cos^{2}(\\omega t)\\right) \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\n$$\nR(t) = (A - A \\omega^{2}) \\cos(\\omega t) + \\mu A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) - \\mu A^{3} \\omega \\cos^{2}(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\n\nThe core of the harmonic balance method is to analyze the frequency content of the residual. The nonlinear term $\\cos^{2}(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t)$ generates higher harmonics. We use trigonometric identities to express this term as a sum of sinusoids.\nWe can use the identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\n\\cos^{2}(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\omega t)) \\sin(\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\omega t)\\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nNext, we use the product-to-sum identity $\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(\\alpha+\\beta) - \\sin(\\alpha-\\beta))$ with $\\alpha = 2\\omega t$ and $\\beta = \\omega t$:\n$$\n\\cos(2\\omega t)\\sin(\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(2\\omega t + \\omega t) - \\sin(2\\omega t - \\omega t)) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(3\\omega t) - \\sin(\\omega t))\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\cos^{2}(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(3\\omega t) - \\sin(\\omega t))\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(3\\omega t) - \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\n$$\n\\cos^{2}(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(3\\omega t)\n$$\nThis expansion shows that the nonlinear damping term generates a component at the fundamental frequency ($\\omega$) and a component at the third harmonic ($3\\omega$).\n\nNow, substitute this expansion back into the expression for the residual $R(t)$:\n$$\nR(t) = (A - A \\omega^{2}) \\cos(\\omega t) + \\mu A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) - \\mu A^{3} \\omega \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(3\\omega t)\\right)\n$$\nGroup the terms corresponding to the fundamental frequency components, which are $\\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\sin(\\omega t)$:\n$$\nR(t) = \\underbrace{(A - A \\omega^{2}) \\cos(\\omega t)}_{\\text{Fundamental (cosine)}} + \\underbrace{\\left(\\mu A \\omega - \\frac{\\mu A^{3} \\omega}{4}\\right) \\sin(\\omega t)}_{\\text{Fundamental (sine)}} - \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu A^{3} \\omega}{4}\\sin(3\\omega t)}_{\\text{Third Harmonic}}\n$$\n\nThe principle of harmonic balance states that for the approximate solution to be accurate, the residual should be small. This is achieved by setting the coefficients of the fundamental harmonics in the residual to zero. The functions $\\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\sin(\\omega t)$ are orthogonal over one period, so their coefficients must be independently set to zero. We neglect the higher harmonic terms (in this case, the term with $\\sin(3\\omega t)$) as per the problem description.\n\nEquating the coefficient of $\\cos(\\omega t)$ to zero:\n$$\nA - A \\omega^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA(1 - \\omega^{2}) = 0\n$$\nSince the amplitude $A$ must be positive ($A > 0$), we must have:\n$$\n1 - \\omega^{2} = 0 \\implies \\omega^{2} = 1\n$$\nAs the angular frequency $\\omega$ must also be positive ($\\omega > 0$), we find:\n$$\n\\omega = 1\n$$\n\nEquating the coefficient of $\\sin(\\omega t)$ to zero:\n$$\n\\mu A \\omega - \\frac{\\mu A^{3} \\omega}{4} = 0\n$$\nFactor out the common term $\\mu A \\omega$:\n$$\n\\mu A \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{A^{2}}{4}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\mu > 0$ and $A > 0$. We have also found that $\\omega = 1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, for the product to be zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{A^{2}}{4} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{A^{2}}{4} = 1 \\implies A^{2} = 4\n$$\nSince the amplitude $A$ must be positive ($A > 0$), we take the positive square root:\n$$\nA = 2\n$$\n\nThus, the method of first-harmonic balance yields an amplitude of $A=2$ and an angular frequency of $\\omega=1$. The resulting approximate solution for the limit cycle of the Van der Pol oscillator is $x(t) \\approx 2\\cos(t)$. The amplitude is dimensionless and the angular frequency is in radians per second. The final answer is to be provided as a two-entry row matrix.",
