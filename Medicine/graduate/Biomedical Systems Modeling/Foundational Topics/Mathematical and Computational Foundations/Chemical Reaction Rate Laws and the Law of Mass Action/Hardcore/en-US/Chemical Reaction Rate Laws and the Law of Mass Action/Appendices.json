            "problem": "Consider a well-mixed intracellular reaction in a fixed volume $V$ where two distinct species $A$ and $B$ react bimolecularly to form products. Under the law of mass action, the volumetric reaction rate $v$ for consumption of $A$ is defined by $v = -\\frac{d[A]}{dt}$, where $[A]$ denotes a concentration field. Assume the kinetics follow a bimolecular rate law of the form $v = k [A][B]$, where $k$ is a rate constant. Two measurement formulations are used in biomedical systems modeling:\n- A molar formulation, in which concentrations are measured as molar concentration $[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}$ in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and the rate $v_{\\mathrm{mol}} = -\\frac{d[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}}{dt}$ has units $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{time}^{-1}$ in the International System of Units (SI).\n- A copy-number formulation, in which concentrations are measured as number concentration $[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}$ in $\\mathrm{count}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ (molecular copies per unit volume) and the rate $v_{\\mathrm{num}} = -\\frac{d[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}}{dt}$ has units $\\mathrm{count}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{time}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of reaction rate as a time derivative of concentration and the law of mass action, perform a dimensional analysis to determine the units of the bimolecular rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{mol}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{num}}$ in terms of concentration and time.

            "solution": "The problem requires a dimensional analysis of the bimolecular rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{mol}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{num}}$ based on the provided rate laws. The principle of dimensional homogeneity dictates that for any valid physical equation, the dimensions of the left-hand side must be identical to the dimensions of the right-hand side. We will apply this principle to each formulation separately.\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the dimension of a physical quantity $X$. The base dimensions provided are concentration ($[\\mathrm{conc}]$) and time ($[\\mathrm{time}]$).\n\nFirst, we analyze the molar formulation.\nThe rate law is given as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{mol}} = k_{\\mathrm{mol}} [A]_{\\mathrm{mol}} [B]_{\\mathrm{mol}}$$\nThe reaction rate, $v_{\\mathrm{mol}}$, is defined as the negative time derivative of concentration, $v_{\\mathrm{mol}} = -\\frac{d[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}}{dt}$. From this definition, we can determine the dimensions of the rate. The dimension of a derivative $\\frac{dX}{dY}$ is $[X]/[Y]$. Therefore, the dimension of the rate is:\n$$[v_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = \\frac{[[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}]}{[t]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]}$$\nThis can be written using exponential notation as $[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^1 [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we apply the principle of dimensional homogeneity to the rate law. The dimensions of each side of the equation must be equal:\n$$[v_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] \\cdot [[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}] \\cdot [[B]_{\\mathrm{mol}}]$$\nThe dimensions of the concentrations of species $A$ and $B$ are both the base dimension for molar concentration:\n$$[[A]_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]$$\n$$[[B]_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]$$\nSubstituting the known dimensions into the equation:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]} = [k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]$$\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]} = [k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^{2}$$\nTo find the dimensions of the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{mol}}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $[k_{\\mathrm{mol}}]$:\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^{2}}$$\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^{1-2} [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$$\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^{-1} [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in the expression $[k_{\\mathrm{mol}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{mol}}]^{\\alpha}[\\mathrm{time}]^{\\beta}$. By comparing our derived dimensions to this form, we find:\n$$\\alpha = -1$$\n$$\\beta = -1$$\n\nSecond, we perform an analogous analysis for the copy-number formulation.\nThe rate law is given as:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{num}} = k_{\\mathrm{num}} [A]_{\\mathrm{num}} [B]_{\\mathrm{num}}$$\nThe rate, $v_{\\mathrm{num}}$, is defined as $v_{\\mathrm{num}} = -\\frac{d[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}}{dt}$. Its dimensions are:\n$$[v_{\\mathrm{num}}] = \\frac{[[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}]}{[t]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]}$$\nThis can be written as $[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^1 [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$.\n\nApplying dimensional homogeneity to the copy-number rate law:\n$$[v_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [k_{\\mathrm{num}}] \\cdot [[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}] \\cdot [[B]_{\\mathrm{num}}]$$\nThe dimensions of the concentrations are given by the base dimension for number concentration:\n$$[[A]_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]$$\n$$[[B]_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]$$\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]} = [k_{\\mathrm{num}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]$$\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}]} = [k_{\\mathrm{num}}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^{2}$$\nWe solve for the dimensions of the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{num}}$:\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{num}}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]}{[\\mathrm{time}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^{2}}$$\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^{1-2} [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$$\n$$[k_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^{-1} [\\mathrm{time}]^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ in the expression $[k_{\\mathrm{num}}] = [\\mathrm{conc}_{\\mathrm{num}}]^{\\gamma}[\\mathrm{time}]^{\\delta}$. By comparing, we find:\n$$\\gamma = -1$$\n$$\\delta = -1$$\n\nIn summary, the exponents are $\\alpha = -1$, $\\beta = -1$, $\\gamma = -1$, and $\\delta = -1$. The structure of the bimolecular rate law is what determines the dimensional dependence, which is identical for both molar and copy-number concentration units.

            "problem": "Consider a well-mixed intracellular compartment of volume $V = 1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ representing hepatocyte cytosol in which a prodrug $A$ is reversibly converted to its active metabolite $B$ via the elementary reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$. The system is open: there is a constant inflow of $A$ from the extracellular space and a first-order export of $B$ through a membrane transporter. Assume the following scientifically standard bases hold: conservation of mass, the Law of Mass Action for elementary reactions, and linear transport kinetics for first-order membrane export.\n\nLet the forward isomerization rate constant be $k_{f}$ with units $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, the reverse rate constant be $k_{r}$ with units $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and the export rate constant for $B$ be $k_{e}$ with units $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Let the molar inflow rate of $A$ be $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ with units $\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,min^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed, permitting a direct and unambiguous solution. We begin by formulating the governing differential equations based on the principle of mass balance.\n\nThe concentration of species $A$, denoted by $a(t)$, changes due to a constant inflow, a forward reaction that consumes it, and a reverse reaction that produces it. The mass-balance equation for $a(t)$ is given by the sum of these rates of change:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = \\text{rate of inflow} - \\text{rate of forward reaction} + \\text{rate of reverse reaction} $$\nSubstituting the given rate laws, we obtain the first ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V} - k_{f} a(t) + k_{r} b(t) $$\n\nSimilarly, the concentration of species $B$, denoted by $b(t)$, changes due to its production from $A$, its conversion back to $A$, and its export from the compartment. The mass-balance equation for $b(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = \\text{rate of forward reaction} - \\text{rate of reverse reaction} - \\text{rate of export} $$\nSubstituting the given rate laws, we obtain the second ODE:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = k_{f} a(t) - k_{r} b(t) - k_{e} b(t) = k_{f} a(t) - (k_{r} + k_{e}) b(t) $$\n\nNext, we address the conceptual distinction between thermodynamic equilibrium and a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) in the context of this system.\n\nA **thermodynamic equilibrium** state is characteristic of a **closed system**, which does not exchange matter with its surroundings. For the present model, this would imply setting the external fluxes to zero, i.e., $J_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0$ and $k_{e} = 0$. In such a state, the principle of detailed balance dictates that the net rate of every microscopic process is zero. For the isomerization reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$, this means the forward reaction rate must exactly equal the reverse reaction rate:\n$$ v_{f} = v_{r} \\implies k_{f} a_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_{r} b_{\\mathrm{eq}} $$\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of matter through the reaction ($J = v_{f} - v_{r} = 0$), and the ratio of concentrations is fixed by the equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_{f}/k_{r}$.\n\nA **nonequilibrium steady state (NESS)**, in contrast, occurs in an **open system** sustained by continuous fluxes of matter and/or energy across its boundaries. The system described in the problem is open due to the inflow of $A$ ($J_{\\mathrm{in}}  0$) and export of $B$ ($k_{e}  0$). A steady state is defined by the condition that all concentrations are constant in time, i.e., $\\frac{da}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{db}{dt} = 0$. Setting the ODEs to zero gives the steady-state conditions:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V} - k_{f} a^{\\ast} + k_{r} b^{\\ast} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ 0 = k_{f} a^{\\ast} - (k_{r} + k_{e}) b^{\\ast} \\quad (2) $$\nwhere $a^{\\ast}$ and $b^{\\ast}$ are the steady-state concentrations. A crucial feature of NESS is that the net flux through internal processes is generally non-zero. From equation ($2$), we find $k_{f} a^{\\ast} = (k_{r} + k_{e}) b^{\\ast}$. The net reaction flux at steady state, $J^{\\ast} = v_{f}(a^{\\ast}) - v_{r}(b^{\\ast}) = k_{f} a^{\\ast} - k_{r} b^{\\ast}$, is therefore:\n$$ J^{\\ast} = (k_{r} + k_{e}) b^{\\ast} - k_{r} b^{\\ast} = k_{e} b^{\\ast} $$\nThis result shows that a persistent net conversion of $A$ to $B$ occurs, with the rate of this net reaction exactly balancing the rate of export of $B$. The system is in a dynamic state, continuously processing matter, which distinguishes it fundamentally from the static condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nTo compute the steady-state concentrations, we solve the system of algebraic equations ($1$) and ($2$). We can add the two equations, which simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = \\left(\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V} - k_{f} a^{\\ast} + k_{r} b^{\\ast}\\right) + \\left(k_{f} a^{\\ast} - (k_{r} + k_{e}) b^{\\ast}\\right) = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V} - k_{e} b^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for $b^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$ b^{\\ast} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V k_{e}} $$\nNext, we rearrange equation ($2$) to solve for $a^{\\ast}$ in terms of $b^{\\ast}$:\n$$ a^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{r} + k_{e}}{k_{f}} b^{\\ast} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $b^{\\ast}$, we find the steady-state concentration of $A$:\n$$ a^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{r} + k_{e}}{k_{f}} \\left( \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V k_{e}} \\right) = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{in}}(k_{r} + k_{e})}{V k_{f} k_{e}} $$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $k_{f} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, $k_{r} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, $k_{e} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, $J_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,min^{-1}}$, and $V = 1\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\nFirst, we calculate the steady-state concentration $b^{\\ast}$:\n$$ b^{\\ast} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,min^{-1}}}{(1\\,\\mathrm{L})(0.10\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}})} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M\\,min^{-1}}}{0.10\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} $$\nNext, we calculate the steady-state concentration $a^{\\ast}$:\n$$ a^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.05\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}} \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}) = \\frac{0.15}{0.2} \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 0.75 \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 37.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} $$\nFinally, we compute the net reaction flux at steady state, $J^{\\ast}$:\n$$ J^{\\ast} = k_{e} b^{\\ast} = (0.10\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}) (50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}) = 5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M\\,min^{-1}} $$\n\nRounding these results to four significant figures as requested, we have:\n$a^{\\ast} = 37.50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$b^{\\ast} = 50.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$J^{\\ast} = 5.000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M\\,min^{-1}}$\nThese values represent the steady-state concentration of the prodrug, the steady-state concentration of the active metabolite, and the net rate at which the prodrug is converted to the metabolite within the system.",

For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this is $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(J)\\lambda + \\det(J) = 0$.\n- Trace: $\\text{tr}(J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})) = -\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3} + 0 = -\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3}$\n- Determinant: $\\det(J(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})) = \\left(-\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3}\\right)(0) - (-k_3)\\left(\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3}\\right) = k_1 k_0$\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\left(-\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3}\\right)\\lambda + k_1 k_0 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 + \\left(\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3}\\right)\\lambda + k_1 k_0 = 0\n$$\nWe now substitute the given parameter values:\n- $k_1 = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $k_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $k_3 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nThe coefficients of the characteristic equation are:\n- $\\frac{k_1 k_0}{k_3} = \\frac{0.01 \\times 5}{0.5} = \\frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $k_1 k_0 = 0.01 \\times 5 = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + 0.1\\lambda + 0.05 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-0.1 \\pm \\sqrt{(0.1)^2 - 4(1)(0.05)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-0.1 \\pm \\sqrt{0.01 - 0.2}}{2} = \\frac{-0.1 \\pm \\sqrt{-0.19}}{2} = \\frac{-0.1 \\pm i\\sqrt{0.19}}{2}\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -0.05 + i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.19}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = -0.05 - i\\frac{\\sqrt{0.19}}{2}\n$$\nThe units of the eigenvalues are $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe local stability of the steady state is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues. Here, the real part of both eigenvalues is $\\mathfrak{Re}(\\lambda_{1,2}) = -0.05$. Since $\\mathfrak{Re}(\\lambda)  0$, the steady state $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable. The non-zero imaginary part indicates that trajectories near the steady state will spiral towards it.\n\nThe spectral abscissa $\\alpha$ is defined as the maximum of the real parts of the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\max(\\mathfrak{Re}(\\lambda_1), \\mathfrak{Re}(\\lambda_2)) = -0.05\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\alpha = -0.05000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$",
