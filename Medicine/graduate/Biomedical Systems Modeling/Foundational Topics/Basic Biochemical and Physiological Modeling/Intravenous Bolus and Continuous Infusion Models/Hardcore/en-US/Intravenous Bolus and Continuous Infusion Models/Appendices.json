            "problem": "Consider a linear one-compartment pharmacokinetic model appropriate for intravenous (IV) administration and continuous infusion. Let $A(t)$ denote the drug amount in the body at time $t$, and let $C(t)$ denote the corresponding well-mixed concentration in the compartment. The volume of distribution $V$ is defined by the constitutive relation $A(t) = V\\,C(t)$ with $V$ constant in time. For linear elimination, the clearance $CL$ is defined as the proportionality between the instantaneous elimination rate and concentration, so that the elimination flux equals $CL\\,C(t)$.

The definitions of volume of distribution ($V$) and clearance ($CL$) are standard. The mass balance equation is a correct application of the principle of conservation of mass. The problem is well-posed; it describes an initial value problem for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which has a unique and stable solution. The language is precise and objective. The setup is complete and self-consistent, providing all necessary information to proceed with the derivation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Solution of the ODE for C(t)**\nThe analysis begins with the two fundamental equations provided:\n1. The mass balance equation: $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -CL\\,C(t)$\n2. The constitutive relation: $A(t) = V\\,C(t)$\n\nSince the volume of distribution $V$ is a constant, we can differentiate the constitutive relation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(V\\,C(t)) = V\\,\\frac{dC}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $\\frac{dA}{dt}$:\n$$\nV\\,\\frac{dC}{dt} = -CL\\,C(t)\n$$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the concentration $C(t)$. To solve it, we can rearrange it into a standard form for a first-order separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,C(t)\n$$\nFor $C(t)  0$, we can separate variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C(t)}\\,dC = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The left side is integrated from the initial concentration $C(0) = C_{0}$ to the concentration at a later time $t$, $C(t)$. The right side is integrated from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_{0}}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'}\\,dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C_{0}}^{C(t)} = \\left[-\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t'\\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration must be non-negative, we can drop the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_{0}) = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t - 0\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms on the left:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_{0}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t\\right)\n$$\nFinally, multiplying by $C_{0}$ gives the solution for $C(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nC(t) = C_{0}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Half-Life, $t_{1/2}$**\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the concentration drops to half of its initial value. Using the given definition, we set $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C_{0}$ in our solution for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}C_{0} = C_{0}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t_{1/2}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $C_{0}  0$, we can divide both sides by $C_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t_{1/2}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, this becomes:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{CL}{V}\\,t_{1/2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and rearranging to solve for $t_{1/2}$ yields the expression for half-life solely in terms of $V$ and $CL$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Computation of Parameter Sensitivities**\nThe local parameter sensitivities are the partial derivatives of $t_{1/2}$ with respect to the parameters $V$ and $CL$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sensitivity with respect to the volume of distribution, $\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial V}$. We treat $CL$ and $\\ln(2)$ as constants:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}\\left(\\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL}\\right) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}(V) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL} \\cdot 1\n$$\nSo, the sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL}\n$$\nNext, we compute the sensitivity with respect to the clearance, $\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial CL}$. We treat $V$ and $\\ln(2)$ as constants and can write $t_{1/2}$ as $t_{1/2} = (V\\,\\ln(2)) \\cdot (CL)^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial CL} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial CL}\\left((V\\,\\ln(2)) \\cdot (CL)^{-1}\\right) = V\\,\\ln(2) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial CL}\\left((CL)^{-1}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial CL} = V\\,\\ln(2) \\cdot (-1)(CL)^{-2} = -\\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL^2}\n$$\nSo, the sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial CL} = -\\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL^2}\n$$\nThe three required expressions are $t_{1/2} = \\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL}$, $\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL}$, and $\\frac{\\partial t_{1/2}}{\\partial CL} = -\\frac{V\\,\\ln(2)}{CL^2}$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n#### Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation\nWe begin with the principle of conservation of mass for the drug amount $A(t)$ in the single compartment. Since there is no infusion after the initial bolus at $t=0$, the rate of change of the amount of drug in the compartment is equal to the negative of the elimination rate.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -v_{\\text{elim}}(C(t))\n$$\nThe problem provides the Michaelis-Menten relation for the elimination rate:\n$$\nv_{\\text{elim}}(C) = V_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C}{K_m + C}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -V_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}\n$$\nThe relationship between the amount $A(t)$ and concentration $C(t)$ is given by $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$, where the volume of distribution $V$ is a constant. Differentiating this relationship with respect to time $t$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$, we obtain the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -V_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}\n$$\nRearranging for $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$, we arrive at the final form of the governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V}\\,\\dfrac{C}{K_m + C}\n$$\n\n#### Derivation of the Integral Expression for Half-Life\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}(C_0)$, is the time it takes for the concentration to fall from its initial value $C_0$ to half of that value, $C_0/2$. To find an expression for $t_{1/2}$, we must solve the ODE. The equation is a separable ODE. We can separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{K_m + C}{C} dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt\n$$\nSimplifying the left-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt\n$$\nTo find the half-life, we integrate both sides over the corresponding intervals. Time $t$ goes from $0$ to $t_{1/2}$, while concentration $C$ goes from $C(0) = C_0$ to $C(t_{1/2}) = C_0/2$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C_0/2} \\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC = \\int_0^{t_{1/2}} -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt\n$$\nThe right-hand side integrates to:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_{1/2}} -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} [t]_0^{t_{1/2}} = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} t_{1/2}\n$$\nTo find an integral expression for $t_{1/2}$, we first rearrange the separated differential equation to solve for $dt$:\n$$\ndt = -\\frac{V}{V_{\\max}}\\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC\n$$\nNow, we integrate $dt$ from $t=0$ to $t=t_{1/2}$, which corresponds to integrating with respect to $C$ from $C_0$ to $C_0/2$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\int_0^{t_{1/2}} dt = \\int_{C_0}^{C_0/2} -\\frac{V}{V_{\\max}}\\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC\n$$\nTo obtain a positive integrand, we can reverse the limits of integration:\n$$\nt_{1/2}(C_0) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\int_{C_0/2}^{C_0} \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right) dC\n$$\nThis is the integral expression for the half-life $t_{1/2}$ as a function of the initial concentration $C_0$.\n\n#### Proof of Monotonicity\nTo prove that $t_{1/2}(C_0)$ strictly increases as a function of $C_0$, we must show that its derivative with respect to $C_0$ is strictly positive for $C_0  0$. We can first evaluate the integral analytically to obtain a closed-form expression for $t_{1/2}(C_0)$.\n$$\n\\int \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right) dC = C + K_m \\ln|C|\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0/2}^{C_0} \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right) dC = \\left[C + K_m \\ln C\\right]_{C_0/2}^{C_0}\n$$\n$$\n= (C_0 + K_m \\ln C_0) - \\left(\\frac{C_0}{2} + K_m \\ln\\frac{C_0}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= C_0 - \\frac{C_0}{2} + K_m (\\ln C_0 - \\ln(C_0/2))\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{C_0}{2} + K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_0/2}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{2} + K_m \\ln 2\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $t_{1/2}(C_0)$:\n$$\nt_{1/2}(C_0) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left(K_m \\ln 2 + \\frac{C_0}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical solution for the half-life. The problem asks for a proof \"without invoking any shortcut formulas.\" Since this formula was derived from first principles starting from the governing equation, its use is part of the proof, not a shortcut.\n\nNow, we differentiate $t_{1/2}(C_0)$ with respect to $C_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d t_{1/2}}{d C_0} = \\frac{d}{dC_0} \\left[ \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left(K_m \\ln 2 + \\frac{C_0}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $V$, $V_{\\max}$, and $K_m$ are constants, the term $\\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} K_m \\ln 2$ is a constant, and its derivative is $0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d t_{1/2}}{d C_0} = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\frac{d}{dC_0} \\left(\\frac{C_0}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{V}{2V_{\\max}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $V$ and $V_{\\max}$ are positive constants. Therefore, the derivative $\\frac{d t_{1/2}}{d C_0}$ is a positive constant:\n$$\n\\frac{d t_{1/2}}{d C_0} = \\frac{V}{2V_{\\max}}  0\n$$\nSince the derivative of $t_{1/2}(C_0)$ with respect to $C_0$ is strictly positive, the function $t_{1/2}(C_0)$ is strictly increasing for all $C_0  0$. This completes the proof.\n\n#### Numerical Implementation\nThe problem requires a numerical algorithm to evaluate $t_{1/2}(C_0)$ by computing the time integral derived earlier:\n$$\nt_{1/2}(C_0) = \\int_{C_0/2}^{C_0} \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right) dC\n$$\nThis can be implemented using a numerical quadrature routine. The `scipy.integrate.quad` function from the SciPy library is a suitable tool for this purpose. It provides a robust and accurate method for computing definite integrals.\n\nFor each test case, we define the integrand function $f(C) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left(1 + \\frac{K_m}{C}\\right)$ using the given parameters $(V_{\\max}, K_m, V)$. The integral is then computed over the interval $[C_0/2, C_0]$. The resulting floating-point value is rounded to six decimal places as required.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard pharmacokinetic modeling principles, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to address the question of structural identifiability.\n\nThe governing equation for the drug concentration $C(t)$ in the central compartment is derived from the mass balance. Given that the amount of drug is $A(t) = V C(t)$ and the volume of distribution $V$ is a known constant, the differential equation is:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{in}(t) - V_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}\n$$\nThe goal is to determine which of the proposed experimental designs allow for the unique determination of the parameter pair $(V_{max}, K_m)$ from noise-free measurements of $C(t)$, given known $V$ and input $R_{in}(t)$. This is the definition of structural identifiability.\n\nWe will analyze each option systematically.\n\n**A. A single IV bolus dose $D$ is chosen sufficiently small that $C(t) \\ll K_m$ throughout the observation window; $C(t)$ is densely sampled and fitted to the MM model.**\n\nUnder the condition $C(t) \\ll K_m$, the Michaelis-Menten term can be approximated:\n$$\nV_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} \\approx V_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m} = \\left(\\frac{V_{max}}{K_m}\\right) C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order elimination process. For a single IV bolus at $t=0$, the input $R_{in}(t) = 0$ for $t  0$. The governing equation simplifies to a linear differential equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\left(\\frac{V_{max}}{K_m}\\right) C(t)\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay: $C(t) = C(0) e^{-kt}$, where $C(0) = D/V$ and the apparent first-order rate constant is $k = \\frac{V_{max}}{V K_m}$.\nFrom the concentration data $C(t)$, one can uniquely determine the rate constant $k$. Since $V$ is known, the value of the product $V k = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_m}$ can be determined. However, this provides only a single constraint on the two unknown parameters $V_{max}$ and $K_m$. Any pair of parameters $(V'_{max}, K'_m)$ such that $V'_{max}/K'_m = V_{max}/K_m$ would produce the same concentration profile. Therefore, $V_{max}$ and $K_m$ cannot be individually and uniquely determined. The parameters are structurally unidentifiable.\n\nThe verdict for this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. A single IV bolus dose $D$ is chosen sufficiently large that $C(t) \\gg K_m$ throughout the observation window (the entire profile remains saturated); $C(t)$ is densely sampled and fitted to the MM model.**\n\nUnder the condition $C(t) \\gg K_m$, the Michaelis-Menten term can be approximated:\n$$\nV_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} \\approx V_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{C(t)} = V_{max}\n$$\nThis is a zero-order elimination process, where the rate of elimination is constant. For an IV bolus ($R_{in}(t) = 0$ for $t0$), the governing equation simplifies to:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = -V_{max}\n$$\nThe solution is a linear decay in concentration: $C(t) = C(0) - \\left(\\frac{V_{max}}{V}\\right)t$.\nBy observing the linear decrease in $C(t)$, one can determine the slope, which equals $-V_{max}/V$. Since $V$ is known, $V_{max}$ can be uniquely determined. However, the parameter $K_m$ has disappeared from the model equation under this simplifying assumption. The observed data contain no information about $K_m$. Thus, the pair $(V_{max}, K_m)$ cannot be uniquely identified.\n\nThe verdict for this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A constant-rate IV infusion is run at rate $R_1$ until steady state concentration $C_1$ is reached and measured; then, the infusion rate is switched to $R_2$ and the new steady state concentration $C_2$ is reached and measured. Both $R_1$ and $R_2$ are known, and $C_1$ and $C_2$ are measured at steady state.**\n\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$, which implies $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. The governing equation for a constant infusion rate $R$ becomes:\n$$\n0 = R - V_{max}\\,\\frac{C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}} \\implies R = V_{max}\\,\\frac{C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ss}$ is the steady-state concentration. The experiment provides two pairs of known values $(R_1, C_1)$ and $(R_2, C_2)$, which yields a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $V_{max}$ and $K_m$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nR_1 = V_{max}\\,\\frac{C_1}{K_m + C_1} \\\\\nR_2 = V_{max}\\,\\frac{C_2}{K_m + C_2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nProvided $R_1 \\neq R_2$ (which is a premise of the experiment) and consequently $C_1 \\neq C_2$, this system can be solved uniquely for $V_{max}$ and $K_m$. To demonstrate, we can rearrange both equations:\n$R_1(K_m + C_1) = V_{max} C_1$ and $R_2(K_m + C_2) = V_{max} C_2$.\nDividing the first by the second gives $\\frac{R_1(K_m + C_1)}{R_2(K_m + C_2)} = \\frac{C_1}{C_2}$, which can be solved for $K_m$:\n$R_1 C_2 (K_m + C_1) = R_2 C_1 (K_m + C_2)$\n$K_m (R_1 C_2 - R_2 C_1) = R_2 C_1 C_2 - R_1 C_1 C_2 = C_1 C_2(R_2 - R_1)$\n$$\nK_m = \\frac{C_1 C_2 (R_2 - R_1)}{R_1 C_2 - R_2 C_1}\n$$\nSince $R_1 \\neq R_2$, a unique value for $K_m$ can be determined (barring the edge case where the denominator is zero, which would imply $R_1/C_1 = R_2/C_2$, a condition that is not generally met for this nonlinear system). Once $K_m$ is found, it can be substituted back into either equation to uniquely determine $V_{max}$. For example:\n$$\nV_{max} = R_1 \\frac{K_m + C_1}{C_1}\n$$\nTherefore, this experimental design allows for the structural identification of both $V_{max}$ and $K_m$.\n\nThe verdict for this option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. A single IV bolus dose $D$ is chosen large enough that the concentration trajectory begins with $C(t) \\gg K_m$ and, over time, passes through $C(t) \\approx K_m$ and then $C(t) \\ll K_m$; $C(t)$ is densely sampled across the entire decline, and the known $V$ is used in model fitting to the full dynamic trajectory.**\n\nThis experiment observes the full nonlinear dynamics of the system, without relying on simplifying approximations. The governing equation is $V \\frac{dC}{dt} = -V_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}$. To test for structural identifiability, we assume two different parameter sets, $(V_{max}, K_m)$ and $(V'_{max}, K'_m)$, produce the same concentration profile $C(t)$ from the same initial condition $C(0) = D/V$. If so, their predicted rates of change must be identical for all $t  0$:\n$$\n- V_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} = - V'_{max}\\,\\frac{C(t)}{K'_m + C(t)}\n$$\nAssuming drug is present ($C(t)  0$), we can divide by $-C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{max}}{K_m + C(t)} = \\frac{V'_{max}}{K'_m + C(t)}\n$$\nCross-multiplying gives:\n$V_{max}(K'_m + C(t)) = V'_{max}(K_m + C(t))$\n$V_{max}K'_m + V_{max}C(t) = V'_{max}K_m + V'_{max}C(t)$\nRearranging terms:\n$$\n(V_{max} - V'_{max})C(t) = V'_{max}K_m - V_{max}K'_m\n$$\nThe right-hand side is a constant, while the left-hand side depends on $C(t)$. The experimental design ensures that $C(t)$ is not constant but varies over a wide range. For this equality to hold for a continuum of $C(t)$ values, both sides must be zero.\n$1.$ $V_{max} - V'_{max} = 0 \\implies V_{max} = V'_{max}$\n$2.$ $V'_{max}K_m - V_{max}K'_m = 0$\nSubstituting $V'_{max} = V_{max}$ into the second equation yields $V_{max}K_m - V_{max}K'_m = 0$, or $V_{max}(K_m - K'_m) = 0$. Since elimination exists, $V_{max}  0$, which implies $K_m - K'_m = 0$, or $K_m = K'_m$.\nSince $(V_{max}, K_m) = (V'_{max}, K'_m)$, the parameters are uniquely determined. This experimental design sufficiently excites the nonlinearity of the system to allow for structural identification.\n\nThe verdict for this option is **Correct**.\n\n**E. A target-controlled infusion protocol steps the constant-rate infusion through at least two distinct setpoints to produce steady states with one concentration below the Michaelis constant ($C_1 \\lesssim K_m$) and one above ($C_2 \\gtrsim K_m$), measuring the corresponding steady-state concentrations and using the known infusion rates to fit the MM elimination model.**\n\nThis experimental design is a specific implementation of the design described in Option C. It involves establishing at least two distinct steady states by using at least two different constant infusion rates ($R_1, R_2$). At each steady state, the relation $R_i = V_{max} \\frac{C_i}{K_m + C_i}$ holds. As demonstrated in the analysis for Option C, having two such pairs $(R_1, C_1)$ and $(R_2, C_2)$ is sufficient to form a system of two equations that can be solved uniquely for the two unknowns $V_{max}$ and $K_m$. The additional specification that the concentrations are chosen to bracket $K_m$ is an excellent strategy for ensuring good *practical* identifiability (i.e., making the parameter estimates robust to measurement noise), as it guarantees the two data points probe different regions of the nonlinear Michaelis-Menten curve. For *structural* identifiability, however, any two distinct steady-state pairs are sufficient. Since this experiment provides at least two such pairs, it meets the requirement for structural identifiability.\n\nThe verdict for this option is **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, the experimental designs that fail are those that linearize the system by operating in a regime where concentration is always much greater or much less than $K_m$. The designs that succeed are those that either sample the full nonlinear dynamic range or sample at least two distinct points on the nonlinear steady-state characteristic curve.",
