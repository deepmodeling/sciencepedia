This first practice challenges you to build the one-compartment oral absorption model from the ground up, starting from fundamental mass-balance statements.

A single oral dose is administered at time $t=0$ with systemic bioavailability $F$ and dose $D$. Let $A_{g}(t)$ denote the amount of drug in the gastrointestinal tract and $A_{c}(t)$ the amount of drug in the central compartment. The absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to the central compartment is first-order with absorption rate constant $k_{a}$, and elimination from the central compartment is first-order with elimination rate constant $k_{e}$. The central compartment has volume of distribution $V$. \n\nStarting from mass-balance statements and the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) implied by these assumptions, derive the expression for the concentration-time profile $C(t)$ in the central compartment following the single oral dose (this expression is widely known as the Bateman function). Then, using $F=0.9$, $D=100$ mg, $V=30$ L, $k_{a}=1.2$ $\\text{h}^{-1}$, $k_{e}=0.2$ $\\text{h}^{-1}$, and evaluating at $t=1$ $\\text{h}$, compute $C(1)$.
