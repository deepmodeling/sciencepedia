            "problem": "A single, well-mixed compartment represents blood plasma of volume $V$ held constant by matching volumetric inflow and outflow. A solute is infused into the compartment with an inflow volumetric rate $F_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and inflow concentration $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The outflow volumetric rate is $F_{\\mathrm{out}}$, and the outflow concentration equals the compartment concentration $C(t)$ due to perfect mixing. Within the compartment, the solute undergoes irreversible first-order metabolic consumption with rate constant $k$ (units $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$), proportional to the amount $A(t)$, where $A(t) = V\\,C(t)$. The compartment volume is held constant by setting $F_{\\mathrm{in}} = F_{\\mathrm{out}} = F$. Consider the initial condition $C(0) = 0$ and the parameter values $V = 3\\,\\mathrm{L}$, $F = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$, $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$, and $k = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nFour candidate material-balance formulations for the amount $A(t)$ are proposed:\n\nA. $\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F\\,C(t) - k\\,A(t)$\n\nB. $\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = -F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} + F\\,C(t) + k\\,A(t)$\n\nC. $\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} + F\\,C(t) - k\\,A(t)$\n\nD. $\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F\\,C(t) + k\\,A(t)$\n\nWhich option correctly enforces a physically consistent sign convention for inflow, outflow, and reaction consumption in the general material balance for this compartment, and consequently yields a nonnegative initial accumulation in $C(t)$ at $t = 0$ under the stated parameters?",
            "solution": "The problem asks to identify the correct material balance equation for the amount of solute, $A(t)$, in a single, well-mixed compartment. The correct formulation must be physically consistent and result in a nonnegative initial rate of change of concentration, $\\dfrac{dC}{dt}|_{t=0}$, given the initial condition $C(0) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the material balance equation from first principles. The general principle states:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow} + \\text{Rate of Generation} - \\text{Rate of Consumption}\n$$\nWe apply this principle to the amount of solute, $A(t)$, in the compartment volume $V$.\n\n1.  **Rate of Accumulation**: This is the rate of change of the amount of solute in the compartment, mathematically expressed as $\\dfrac{dA}{dt}$.\n\n2.  **Rate of Inflow**: Solute enters the compartment via infusion. The volumetric inflow rate is $F_{\\mathrm{in}}$, which is given as $F$, and the inflow concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The rate at which the mass of solute enters the compartment is the product of the volumetric flow rate and the concentration. This is a positive contribution to the accumulation.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of Inflow} = F_{\\mathrmin} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{in}} = F \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{in}}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Rate of Outflow**: Solute leaves the compartment. The volumetric outflow rate is $F_{\\mathrm{out}}$, which is given as $F$. Since the compartment is well-mixed, the concentration of the exiting fluid is the same as the uniform concentration within the compartment, $C(t)$. The rate at which the mass of solute leaves the compartment is a loss term and thus carries a negative sign.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of Outflow} = F_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot C(t) = F \\cdot C(t)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Rate of Generation**: The problem describes consumption, not generation. Therefore, the rate of generation is $0$.\n\n5.  **Rate of Consumption**: The solute undergoes irreversible first-order metabolic consumption. The rate is given as being proportional to the amount of solute, $A(t)$, with a rate constant $k$. This is a loss term and must have a negative sign.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of Consumption} = k \\cdot A(t)\n    $$\n\nCombining these terms according to the material balance principle yields the governing differential equation for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of Outflow}) - (\\text{Rate of Consumption})\n$$\n$$\n\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F\\,C(t) - k\\,A(t)\n$$\nThis equation represents the correct physical model for the described system.\n\nNext, we verify the second condition: the formulation must yield a \"nonnegative initial accumulation in $C(t)$ at $t = 0$\". This refers to the value of $\\dfrac{dC}{dt}$ at $t=0$.\nThe relationship between amount $A(t)$ and concentration $C(t)$ is given as $A(t) = V\\,C(t)$. Since the volume $V$ is constant, we can differentiate this relationship with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = V\\,\\dfrac{dC}{dt}\n$$\nThus, the sign of $\\dfrac{dC}{dt}$ is the same as the sign of $\\dfrac{dA}{dt}$, because $V > 0$. We need to check if $\\dfrac{dA}{dt}|_{t=0} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe initial condition is $C(0) = 0$. This implies that the initial amount of solute is also zero: $A(0) = V \\cdot C(0) = V \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nSubstituting $t=0$, $C(0)=0$, and $A(0)=0$ into our derived equation:\n$$\n\\left. \\dfrac{dA}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F\\,C(0) - k\\,A(0) = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F(0) - k(0) = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nUsing the given parameter values, $F = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$:\n$$\n\\left. \\dfrac{dA}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} = (0.3\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}) \\cdot (2\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}) = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nSince $0.6 > 0$, the initial rate of accumulation is positive, and thus nonnegative. The corresponding rate of change in concentration is:\n$$\n\\left. \\dfrac{dC}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left. \\dfrac{dA}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{1}{3\\,\\mathrm{L}} (0.6\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{min}) = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1} \\cdot min^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is also positive and therefore nonnegative. The derived model is both physically consistent and satisfies the initial accumulation condition.\n\nReviewing the options, only Option A, $\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = F\\,C_{\\mathrm{in}} - F\\,C(t) - k\\,A(t)$, matches our derivation and correctly models the physical system with a consistent sign convention for all contributing processes. It also satisfies the condition of having a nonnegative initial accumulation.",
