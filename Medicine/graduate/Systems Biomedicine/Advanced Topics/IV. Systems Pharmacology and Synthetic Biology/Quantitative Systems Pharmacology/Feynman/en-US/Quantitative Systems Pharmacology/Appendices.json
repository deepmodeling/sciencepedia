It presents a standard, foundational derivation in quantitative systems pharmacology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Coupled ODEs**\n\nThe reversible reaction is given by the stoichiometry $R + D \\rightleftharpoons RD$. The forward reaction (association) is $R+D \\rightarrow RD$ and the reverse reaction (dissociation) is $RD \\rightarrow R+D$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $v_f$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$v_f = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\nThe rate of the reverse reaction, $v_r$, is proportional to the concentration of its reactant:\n$$v_r = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species is the sum of the rates of the reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of the reactions that consume it.\n\nFor the receptor-drug complex, $RD(t)$, it is formed by the forward reaction and consumed by the reverse reaction. Thus, its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = v_f - v_r = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t) - k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nFor the free receptor, $R(t)$, it is consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the free drug, $D(t)$, it is also consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dD}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nThese three ODEs describe the dynamics of the system. Note that $\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = -\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{dD}{dt}$, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction and the provided conservation laws. Differentiating $R(t) + RD(t) = R_{\\text{tot}}$ with respect to time $t$ yields $\\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$, which is satisfied by our derived ODEs.\n\n**2. Determination of the Equilibrium Solution**\n\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of all concentrations is zero. We denote the equilibrium concentrations of free receptor, free drug, and complex as $R$, $D$, and $RD$, respectively, dropping the explicit time dependence. The problem statement itself uses $D$ to denote the equilibrium free drug concentration.\n\nSetting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$$\nThis implies:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D - k_{\\text{off}} RD = 0$$\nRearranging the terms, we find the balance between association and dissociation at equilibrium:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D = k_{\\text{off}} RD$$\n\nThe problem defines the equilibrium dissociation constant as $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$. We can divide the equilibrium balance equation by $k_{\\text{on}}$ to introduce $K_D$:\n$$R D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} RD$$\n$$R D = K_D RD$$\n\nThe problem requests the equilibrium concentration of the complex, $RD$, in terms of the total receptor concentration $R_{\\text{tot}}$, the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$, and $K_D$. To achieve this, we use the conservation law for receptors, which also holds at equilibrium:\n$$R + RD = R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nFrom this, we express the equilibrium free receptor concentration $R$ in terms of $R_{\\text{tot}}$ and $RD$:\n$$R = R_{\\text{tot}} - RD$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into our equilibrium condition $R D = K_D RD$:\n$$(R_{\\text{tot}} - RD) D = K_D RD$$\nAn important assumption, as implied by the problem's framing, is that the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$ is treated as a known independent variable. This is a common scenario in pharmacology experiments where $D$ is either directly measured or is assumed to be approximately equal to the total drug concentration, $D_{\\text{tot}}$, under the condition $D_{\\text{tot}} \\gg R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nWe now solve the equation for $RD$:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D - RD \\cdot D = K_D RD$$\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD \\cdot D + K_D RD$$\nFactor out $RD$ on the right-hand side:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD (D + K_D)$$\nFinally, isolating $RD$ gives the desired equilibrium solution:\n$$RD = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D}$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Fractional Occupancy**\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the drug.\n$$f = \\frac{RD}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nUsing the expression for the equilibrium concentration of $RD$ derived in the previous step, we substitute it into the definition of $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D} \\right)$$\nThe $R_{\\text{tot}}$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$f = \\frac{D}{D + K_D}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation. It is a dimensionless quantity, as $D$ and $K_D$ both have units of concentration. The expression gives the fractional occupancy as a hyperbolic function of the free drug concentration $D$.",

This practice focuses on pharmacokinetics, the study of 'what the body does to the drug' .

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and solution of a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, starting from the fundamental law of mass balance. The process will be carried out in three main steps as requested: derivation of the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs), determination of the steady-state concentration during infusion, and finally, solving for the concentration profile after the infusion is stopped.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Governing ODEs**\n\nThe law of mass balance for the amount of drug, $A(t)$, in the compartment at time $t$ is stated as:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of drug input} - \\text{Rate of drug elimination}\n$$\n\nThe rate of drug elimination is stated to be a first-order process. This means the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of drug present, $A(t)$. We can write this as $\\text{Rate of elimination} = k_e A(t)$, where $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe problem provides the parameter systemic clearance, $CL$. Clearance is defined as the volume of physiological fluid cleared of drug per unit time. Therefore, the rate of elimination can also be expressed as the product of clearance and the drug concentration, $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nBy definition, the concentration is the amount of drug per unit volume of distribution, $V$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V} \\implies A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the rate of elimination gives a relationship between $k_e$, $CL$, and $V$:\n$$\nk_e A(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$:\n$$\nk_e (V \\cdot C(t)) = CL \\cdot C(t) \\implies k_e = \\frac{CL}{V}\n$$\nWe will use this established relationship. The rate of elimination is thus $\\frac{CL}{V} A(t)$.\n\nNow, we can write the ODE for the amount of drug, $A(t)$, for the two phases:\n\n1.  **During constant-rate infusion:** The rate of drug input is a constant, $R_0$. The mass balance equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_0 - \\frac{CL}{V} A(t)\n    $$\n2.  **After the infusion stops:** The rate of drug input is $0$. The mass balance equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{CL}{V} A(t)\n    $$\n\nNext, we convert these ODEs for the amount $A(t)$ into ODEs for the concentration $C(t)$. Since $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$ and $V$ is a constant, we have $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$.\n\n1.  **During infusion:** Substituting into the first ODE:\n    $$\n    V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_0 - \\frac{CL}{V} (V \\cdot C(t))\n    $$\n    $$\n    V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_0 - CL \\cdot C(t)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $V$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{R_0}{V} - \\frac{CL}{V} C(t)\n    $$\n2.  **After infusion stops:** Substituting into the second ODE:\n    $$\n    V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{CL}{V} (V \\cdot C(t))\n    $$\n    $$\n    V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = - CL \\cdot C(t)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $V$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{CL}{V} C(t)\n    $$\n\n**Step 2: Determination of the Steady-State Concentration**\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$, we analyze the system during the infusion phase. Steady state is achieved when the concentration no longer changes with time, i.e., $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. Setting the derivative in the infusion ODE to zero:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{R_0}{V} - \\frac{CL}{V} C_{ss}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{ss}$:\n$$\n\\frac{CL}{V} C_{ss} = \\frac{R_0}{V} \\implies C_{ss} = \\frac{R_0}{CL}\n$$\nAlternatively, one could solve the ODE for the infusion phase, $\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{CL}{V} C = \\frac{R_0}{V}$, with the initial condition $C(0) = 0$. The solution to this first-order linear ODE is $C(t) = \\frac{R_0}{CL} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}t\\right)\\right)$. Taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$ gives the steady-state concentration:\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{R_0}{CL} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V}t\\right)\\right) \\right] = \\frac{R_0}{CL}(1 - 0) = \\frac{R_0}{CL}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result for the steady-state concentration.\n\n**Step 3: Solution for Concentration After Infusion Stop**\n\nThe problem states that at time $t=0$, the infusion is stopped, and the system is at steady state. This defines the initial condition for the post-infusion phase. The concentration at $t=0$ is the steady-state concentration derived in the previous step:\n$$\nC(0) = C_{ss} = \\frac{R_0}{CL}\n$$\nThe governing ODE for $t \\ge 0$ is the one for the post-infusion phase:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{CL}{V} C(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We can write it as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -\\frac{CL}{V} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial concentration $C(0)$ to $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{CL}{V} dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = -\\frac{CL}{V} [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t\n$$\nSince concentration must be non-negative, the absolute value is not needed.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $C(0) = \\frac{R_0}{CL}$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{R_0}{CL} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the drug concentration $C(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ after the infusion has stopped, expressed in terms of the given parameters $R_0$, $V$, $CL$, and time $t$.",

The protein is continuously synthesized at a constant rate $k_{syn}$ and degraded via a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{deg}$. The activity of the downstream pathway is directly proportional to the concentration of free, unbound target protein, $T$. In the absence of any inhibitor, the system is at a steady state with a total target concentration of $T_0$.\n\nTwo different competitive inhibitors, Inhibitor A and Inhibitor B, are developed to block the function of this target. Both inhibitors exhibit the same equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. However, they possess different binding kinetics. Inhibitor A is a slow-dissociating inhibitor with a dissociation rate constant $k_s$, while Inhibitor B is a fast-dissociating inhibitor with a dissociation rate constant $k_f$, where $k_f > k_s$. The corresponding association rate constants are $k_{on,A}$ and $k_{on,B}$. The inhibitor-target complex, $C$, consists of one inhibitor molecule and one target protein molecule, and is also subject to degradation with the same rate constant $k_{deg}$.\n\nTo compare the overall efficacy of these inhibitors in a dynamic cellular context, a washout experiment is performed. First, the cell population is incubated with a saturating concentration of either Inhibitor A or Inhibitor B until a new steady state is reached. At time $t=0$, the free inhibitor is instantaneously and completely removed from the system, and the concentration of free target, $T(t)$, is monitored as it recovers back to its original drug-free steady-state level, $T_0$.\n\nA key metric in Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) to quantify the total impact of the inhibitor during the recovery phase is the integrated recovery deficit, $\\mathcal{J}$.
