To predict cellular fate, we must understand the long-term stable states, or attractors, of the corresponding network model. This exercise demonstrates how to manually trace the dynamics of a Boolean network under an asynchronous update scheme, which often more realistically models the stochastic timing of biological processes. By constructing the state transition graph, you will directly observe how local update rules give rise to global dynamic behaviors, such as the emergence of a cyclic attractor . This foundational practice builds crucial intuition for the connection between network structure and its dynamic capabilities.",

            "problem": "Consider a logic-based model of a signaling pathway represented as a Boolean network with three nodes $A$, $B$, and $C$, taking values in $\\{0,1\\}$. The network is defined by the update functions $f_A(A,B,C) := \\neg B$, $f_B(A,B,C) := C$, and $f_C(A,B,C) := A$, where $\\neg$ denotes Boolean negation. Under the asynchronous update scheme, at each discrete time step exactly one node that is not at its prescribed update value is selected and updated to that value, while the other nodes remain unchanged. In this setting, an attractor is defined as a terminal strongly connected component (SCC) of the asynchronous state-transition graph, that is, a nonempty set of states that is closed under asynchronous transitions and from which no transitions lead to states outside the set.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of Boolean networks, asynchronous updating, and attractors as terminal SCCs, perform the following:\n\n- Enumerate all states $(A,B,C) \\in \\{0,1\\}^3$ and, for each state, determine all possible asynchronous successors by identifying the nodes whose current values differ from their update values and updating exactly one such node.\n- Construct the asynchronous state-transition graph and identify all attractors.\n- To comply with the answer specification, encode each state $(A,B,C)$ by the integer $4A + 2B + C$ and list the integers corresponding to the attractor states in the order induced by the cycle starting from the state $(0,0,0)$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single row matrix of these integers using the $\\mathrm{pmatrix}$ environment. No rounding is required. No units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It is a standard exercise in the analysis of Boolean networks, a valid topic in systems biomedicine. All necessary definitions, functions, and constraints are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe Boolean network consists of three nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, whose states belong to the set $\\{0,1\\}$. The total number of states in the system is $2^3=8$. The state of the network is given by the vector $(A,B,C)$. The update functions are provided as $f_A(A,B,C) = \\neg B$, $f_B(A,B,C) = C$, and $f_C(A,B,C) = A$. We can represent the target update vector for any state $(A,B,C)$ as $F = (f_A, f_B, f_C) = (\\neg B, C, A)$.\n\nUnder the asynchronous update scheme, a transition is possible from a state $S$ to a new state $S'$ if $S'$ is obtained by updating the value of exactly one node $X \\in \\{A,B,C\\}$ for which the current value $X$ is not equal to its target value $f_X$.\n\nWe will systematically enumerate all $8$ states, calculate their corresponding update vectors, and determine all possible successor states.\n\n1.

State $S_6 = (1,1,0)$:\n    The update vector is $F_6 = (\\neg 1, 0, 1) = (0,0,1)$.\n    All three nodes are unstable ($A=1 \\neq f_A=0$, $B=1 \\neq f_B=0$, $C=0 \\neq f_C=1$).\n    There are three possible successors:\n    - Updating $A$: $(0,1,0)$\n    - Updating $B$: $(1,0,0)$\n    - Updating $C$: $(1,1,1)$\n\n8.  State $S_7 = (1,1,1)$:\n    The update vector is $F_7 = (\\neg 1, 1, 1) = (0,1,1)$.\n    Only node $A$ is unstable ($A=1$, $f_A=0$).\n    The only possible successor is by updating $A$: $(0,1,1)$.\n\nA fixed point (or steady state) is a state $S$ such that $S=F$. This would require $(A,B,C) = (\\neg B, C, A)$, which implies $A = \\neg B$, $B=C$, and $C=A$. From the last two, $A=B=C$. But $A=\\neg B$ implies $A \\neq B$. This is a contradiction, so no fixed points exist. The attractors must be cyclic.\n\nNow we construct the state-transition graph. Let's trace a path starting from state $(0,0,0)$:\n$(0,0,0) \\to (1,0,0) \\to (1,0,1) \\to (1,1,1) \\to (0,1,1) \\to (0,1,0) \\to (0,0,0)$.\nThis sequence forms a cycle of length $6$. This set of $6$ states, let us call it $\\mathcal{A}$, is strongly connected. To be an attractor (a terminal SCC), no state in $\\mathcal{A}$ can have a transition to a state outside of $\\mathcal{A}$. We have already determined all successors for each state. A review of the transitions for the states in the cycle shows this is true:\n- $(0,0,0)$ transitions to $(1,0,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,0,0)$ transitions to $(1,0,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,0,1)$ transitions to $(1,1,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(1,1,1)$ transitions to $(0,1,1) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(0,1,1)$ transitions to $(0,1,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n- $(0,1,0)$ transitions to $(0,0,0) \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nThus, the set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,1), (0,1,1), (0,1,0)\\}$ is a terminal SCC and therefore an attractor.\n\nThe two states not in this cycle are $(0,0,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$. Let's examine their transitions:\n- From $(0,0,1)$, transitions lead to $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, and $(0,0,0)$. All three successor states are in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n- From $(1,1,0)$, transitions lead to $(0,1,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, and $(1,1,1)$. All three successor states are in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nSo, any state not in the attractor will eventually transition into it. This confirms that $\\mathcal{A}$ is the only attractor in the network.\n\nThe final step is to encode the states in $\\mathcal{A}$ as integers and list them in the order of the cycle starting from $(0,0,0)$. The encoding is given by the integer $I = 4A + 2B + C$.\nThe ordered states in the cycle are:\n1.  $(0,0,0) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(0) + 0 = 0$\n2.  $(1,0,0) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(0) + 0 = 4$\n3.  $(1,0,1) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(0) + 1 = 5$\n4.  $(1,1,1) \\implies I = 4(1) + 2(1) + 1 = 7$\n5.  $(0,1,1) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(1) + 1 = 3$\n6.  $(0,1,0) \\implies I = 4(0) + 2(1) + 0 = 2$\n\nThe ordered sequence of integers representing the attractor states is $(0, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2)$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established field of systems biology, specifically the analysis of Boolean networks. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary definitions and functions provided. It is objective and free from ambiguity. The task is to find the number of fixed points in a given synchronous Boolean network, a standard exercise in this domain.\n\nA fixed point, or steady state, of the network is a state vector $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ where each component's value remains unchanged after one update step. This is mathematically expressed by the set of equations $x_i = f_i(x)$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where the states $x_i$ take values in $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n### Task 1: Fixed-Point Conditions as Biconditionals\n\nThe fixed-point conditions can be written as a system of four propositional logic equivalences (biconditionals), where $x_i=1$ is treated as the proposition $x_i$ being true, and $x_i=0$ as false. The state $x$ is a fixed point if and only if it satisfies the following four conditions simultaneously:\n1.  $C_1: x_1 \\leftrightarrow \\big( (x_2 \\lor x_4) \\land \\neg x_3 \\big)$\n2.  $C_2: x_2 \\leftrightarrow (x_1 \\land \\neg x_3)$\n3.  $C_3: x_3 \\leftrightarrow \\neg x_2$\n4.  $C_4: x_4 \\leftrightarrow x_2$\n\n### Task 2: Conversion to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)\n\nTo convert these biconditionals into CNF suitable for a SAT solver, we apply standard logical transformations. For complex expressions, the Tseitin transformation is used, which introduces auxiliary variables to represent subformulas, ensuring the overall formula size does not grow exponentially.\n\nA general biconditional $A \\leftrightarrow B$ is equivalent to $(A \\rightarrow B) \\land (B \\rightarrow A)$, which in CNF is $(\\neg A \\lor B) \\land (\\neg B \\lor A)$.\n\nFor $C_1$, which is $x_1 \\leftrightarrow \\big( (x_2 \\lor x_4) \\land \\neg x_3 \\big)$, we introduce an auxiliary variable $a_1$ for the subformula $(x_2 \\lor x_4)$, as suggested.\nThe constraint $a_1 \\leftrightarrow (x_2 \\lor x_4)$ is converted to CNF as:\n$(\\neg a_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor x_4) \\land (a_1 \\lor \\neg x_2) \\land (a_1 \\lor \\neg x_4)$.\n\nWith this, $C_1$ becomes $x_1 \\leftrightarrow (a_1 \\land \\neg x_3)$. This is converted to CNF as:\n$(x_1 \\rightarrow (a_1 \\land \\neg x_3)) \\land ((a_1 \\land \\neg x_3) \\rightarrow x_1)$\n$\\equiv (\\neg x_1 \\lor (a_1 \\land \\neg x_3)) \\land (\\neg(a_1 \\land \\neg x_3) \\lor x_1)$\n$\\equiv (\\neg x_1 \\lor a_1) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_3) \\land (\\neg a_1 \\lor x_3 \\lor x_1)$.\n\nThe simpler conditions are converted directly:\n- For $C_2: x_2 \\leftrightarrow (x_1 \\land \\neg x_3)$, the CNF is $(\\neg x_2 \\lor x_1) \\land (\\neg x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor x_3 \\lor x_2)$.\n- For $C_3: x_3 \\leftrightarrow \\neg x_2$, the CNF is $(\\neg x_3 \\lor \\neg x_2) \\land (x_3 \\lor x_2)$. This represents an XNOR condition.\n- For $C_4: x_4 \\leftrightarrow x_2$, the CNF is $(\\neg x_4 \\lor x_2) \\land (x_4 \\lor \\neg x_2)$.\n\nThe full set of constraints in CNF is the conjunction of all these clauses. A satisfying assignment for this global CNF formula corresponds to a fixed point of the network.\n\n### Task 3: Determining the Number of Satisfying Assignments\n\nTo find the number of fixed points, we need to find the number of assignments to $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ that satisfy all four original biconditional equations. This can be achieved by logical deduction, which is equivalent to applying resolution or other SAT-solving algorithms to the CNF representation.\n\nWe start with the simplest constraints:\nFrom $C_3: x_3 \\leftrightarrow \\neg x_2$, we know that $x_2$ and $x_3$ must have opposite logical values.\nFrom $C_4: x_4 \\leftrightarrow x_2$, we know that $x_2$ and $x_4$ must have the same logical value.\n\nWe can substitute these relationships into the more complex conditions, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nSubstitute into $C_1$:\n$x_1 \\leftrightarrow \\big( (x_2 \\lor x_4) \\land \\neg x_3 \\big)$\nSince $x_4=x_2$ and $\\neg x_3=x_2$, this becomes:\n$x_1 \\leftrightarrow \\big( (x_2 \\lor x_2) \\land x_2 \\big)$\n$x_1 \\leftrightarrow (x_2 \\land x_2)$\n$x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2$\n\nSo, the first, third, and fourth conditions together imply that $x_1$, $x_4$, and $x_2$ must all have the same value, and $x_3$ must have the opposite value.\n\nNow, we must ensure this is consistent with the remaining condition, $C_2$:\n$C_2: x_2 \\leftrightarrow (x_1 \\land \\neg x_3)$\nSubstitute the derived relationships $x_1=x_2$ and $\\neg x_3=x_2$:\n$x_2 \\leftrightarrow (x_2 \\land x_2)$\n$x_2 \\leftrightarrow x_2$\nThis is a tautology, meaning it is always true. It places no additional constraints on the variables. Therefore, any state that satisfies the simplified relationships $x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2$, $x_3 \\leftrightarrow \\neg x_2$, and $x_4 \\leftrightarrow x_2$ will be a fixed point.\n\nThe entire state of the network is determined by the value of a single variable, $x_2$. Since $x_2$ must be in $\\{0, 1\\}$, there are two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: $x_2 = 0$.\nThe relationships $x_1=x_2$, $x_3=\\neg x_2$, and $x_4=x_2$ imply:\n- $x_1 = 0$\n- $x_3 = \\neg 0 = 1$\n- $x_4 = 0$\nThis gives the fixed point state $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (0, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x_2 = 1$.\nThe same relationships imply:\n- $x_1 = 1$\n- $x_3 = \\neg 1 = 0$\n- $x_4 = 1$\nThis gives the fixed point state $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nThere are no other possibilities. The logical deductions have shown that there are exactly two states that satisfy all four fixed-point conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of fixed points of the network is $2$.",

            "solution": "We begin from the core definitions applicable in logic-based modeling of signaling pathways. A Boolean network consists of nodes with binary states and update functions mapping current node states to future states. Under asynchronous dynamics, at each step a subset of nodes may update according to their functions, and attractors include fixed points (states that remain invariant under all possible asynchronous updates). A stable motif is defined as a minimal set of node-state assignments that is self-sustaining under the update functions: if all nodes in the motif are set to their motif-assigned values, then the update logic guarantees those values persist, independent of the states of nodes outside the motif.

The pair has the logic:\n$$\nT_A^{t+1} \\;=\\; T_B^{t},\\qquad T_B^{t+1} \\;=\\; T_A^{t}.\n$$\nThis is a positive feedback loop. A stable motif for such a loop is any consistent assignment that reproduces itself under the update logic. The assignments $T_A=1, T_B=1$ and $T_A=0, T_B=0$ are self-consistent:\n- If $T_A=1$ and $T_B=1$, then $T_A^{t+1}=T_B^{t}=1$ and $T_B^{t+1}=T_A^{t}=1$, so both remain $1$.\n- If $T_A=0$ and $T_B=0$, then $T_A^{t+1}=T_B^{t}=0$ and $T_B^{t+1}=T_A^{t}=0$, so both remain $0$.\nAssignments with $T_A \\neq T_B$ are not self-sustaining, because they swap values under updates and do not form invariant fixed points (under asynchronous dynamics they would evolve toward agreement and do not define a stable motif). Therefore, the two minimal stable motifs for the transcription factor pair are:\n$$\n\\{T_A=1,\\,T_B=1\\}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\{T_A=0,\\,T_B=0\\}.\n$$\n\nNext, consider $G$:\n$$\nG^{t+1} \\;=\\; \\left(T_A^{t} \\land T_B^{t}\\right) \\lor G^{t}.\n$$\nThis rule has a positive self-loop term $G^{t}$, indicating that once $G$ is $1$, it is self-sustaining regardless of other nodes:\n- If $G=1$, then $G^{t+1} = (T_A^{t} \\land T_B^{t}) \\lor 1 = 1$, so $G=1$ is a stable motif by itself:\n$$\n\\{G=1\\}.\n$$\nFor $G=0$, we have $G^{t+1} = T_A^{t} \\land T_B^{t}$.

However, $I=0$ is not a minimal stable motif by itself because its self-loop does not support $0$; it is only self-sustaining in the presence of $G=1$. Thus the minimal motif capturing $I=0$ is composite:\n$$\n\\{G=1,\\,I=0\\}.\n$$\n\nWe now assemble the admissible long-term states (fixed-point attractors) implied by these motifs and check consistency across all nodes.\n\nCase 1: The transcription factor motif $\\{T_A=1,\\,T_B=1\\}$.\n- For $G$: With $T_A=1$ and $T_B=1$, $G^{t+1} = 1 \\lor G^{t} = 1$, so $G=1$ is forced in any fixed point.\n- For $I$: With $G=1$, $I^{t+1} = 0 \\lor I^{t} = I^{t}$. Therefore, both $I=0$ and $I=1$ are consistent fixed-point assignments.\nThus, there are two fixed points in this case:\n$$\n(T_A,T_B,G,I) = (1,1,1,0)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(1,1,1,1).\n$$\n\nCase 2: The transcription factor motif $\\{T_A=0,\\,T_B=0\\}$.\n- For $G$: With $T_A=0$ and $T_B=0$, $G^{t+1} = 0 \\lor G^{t} = G^{t}$.

This yields one fixed point:\n  $$\n  (T_A,T_B,G,I) = (0,0,0,1).\n  $$\n  - Subcase 2b: $G=1$. Then $I^{t+1} = 0 \\lor I^{t} = I^{t}$, so both $I=0$ and $I=1$ are consistent fixed-point assignments. This yields two fixed points:\n  $$\n  (T_A,T_B,G,I) = (0,0,1,0)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(0,0,1,1).\n  $$\n\nCollecting all fixed-point attractors, we have the following distinct long-term states:\n$$\n(1,1,1,0),\\quad(1,1,1,1),\\quad(0,0,0,1),\\quad(0,0,1,0),\\quad(0,0,1,1).\n$$\nThere are no oscillatory attractors under these rules, because all feedback cycles are either positive and admit fixed assignments (the $T_A$–$T_B$ loop), or include positive self-loops that stabilize specific values ($G$ and $I$), and there is no negative feedback loop that would force alternation. In asynchronous Boolean networks with this structure, the identified fixed points exhaust the admissible long-term states.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of admissible long-term states (fixed-point attractors) is $5$.",
