Consider an integrated phenotype network formed by fusing two modality-specific undirected weighted graphs on the same phenotype set $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, where $P_i$ denotes phenotype $i$. The two layers are:\n- Genomic similarity layer with nonzero edge weights: $w^{(g)}(P_1,P_2)=1$, $w^{(g)}(P_2,P_3)=2$, $w^{(g)}(P_3,P_4)=1$.\n- Clinical similarity layer with nonzero edge weights: $w^{(c)}(P_1,P_2)=2$, $w^{(c)}(P_2,P_3)=1$, $w^{(c)}(P_3,P_4)=2$.\n\nAssume both layers have already been scaled to comparable weight ranges by preprocessing. The integrated graph is constructed by convex fusion of the two adjacency functions: for each pair $(i,j)$, $w^{(\\mathrm{fuse})}(P_i,P_j)=\\alpha\\,w^{(g)}(P_i,P_j)+(1-\\alpha)\\,w^{(c)}(P_i,P_j)$ with $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$. Let $A$ denote the fused adjacency and $D$ the diagonal degree matrix with entries $D_{ii}=\\sum_j A_{ij}$. Consider the simple random walk on the fused graph, which is the time-homogeneous Markov chain whose one-step transition probabilities are given by $P=D^{-1}A$.\n\nDefine the hitting time $H(P_i\\to P_j)$ as the expected number of steps for the random walk started at node $P_i$ to visit node $P_j$ for the first time. Define the commute time between two nodes as $C(P_i,P_j)=H(P_i\\to P_j)+H(P_j\\to P_i)$. Use the first-step analysis principle of Markov chains (that the expectation of a stopping time can be written in terms of expectations from the next-step states weighted by one-step transition probabilities, together with the boundary condition that the hitting time of the target is $0$) to derive and solve the necessary linear systems on the fused graph.\n\nCompute the commute time $C(P_1,P_4)$ on the fused graph.

Thus, the fused graph is a simple path on $4$ nodes with equal edge weights $\\tfrac{3}{2}$ between adjacent nodes and no other edges.\n\nThe degree of each node is the sum of incident fused weights. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\deg(P_1)=\\tfrac{3}{2},\\quad \\deg(P_2)=\\tfrac{3}{2}+\\tfrac{3}{2}=3,\\quad \\deg(P_3)=3,\\quad \\deg(P_4)=\\tfrac{3}{2}.\n$$\n\nThe simple random walk transition probabilities are given by $P=D^{-1}A$, so that for each node, the probability of moving to a neighbor is the incident edge weight divided by the node degree. Because each node has at most two neighbors and the incident weights are equal where there are two neighbors, we have\n\n$$\nP(P_1\\to P_2)=1,\\quad P(P_2\\to P_1)=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad P(P_2\\to P_3)=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad P(P_3\\to P_2)=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad P(P_3\\to P_4)=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad P(P_4\\to P_3)=1.\n$$\n\n\nWe now compute hitting times by first-step analysis. For a fixed target node, say $P_4$, define $h_i=H(P_i\\to P_4)$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. By definition, $h_4=0$. For $i\\neq 4$, the first-step analysis yields\n\n$$\nh_i=1+\\sum_{j} P(P_i\\to P_j)\\,h_j,\n$$\n\nbecause one step is taken and then the expected remaining time is the average over next states weighted by transition probabilities. Writing the equations explicitly:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_1=1+h_2 \\quad \\text{(since }P(P_1\\to P_2)=1\\text{)},\\\\\nh_2=1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_3,\\\\\nh_3=1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_2+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_4=1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_2,\\\\\nh_4=0.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe solve this linear system. Substituting $h_3=1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_2$ into the equation for $h_2$ gives:\n$h_2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}h_1 + \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{2}h_2) \\implies h_2 = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}h_1 + \\frac{1}{4}h_2$.\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4}h_2 = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}h_1$, or $3h_2 = 6+2h_1$.\nUsing $h_1=1+h_2$, we substitute to get $3h_2=6+2(h_2+1) \\implies 3h_2=8+2h_2 \\implies h_2=8$.\nFrom this, we find $h_1=1+h_2=9$ and $h_3=1+\\tfrac{1}{2}h_2=1+4=5$. Therefore,\n$$\nH(P_1\\to P_4)=h_1=9.\n$$\n\n\nBy the symmetry of the path graph's structure and weights, the random walk from $P_4$ to $P_1$ mirrors the walk from $P_1$ to $P_4$. More formally, for a time-reversible random walk on an undirected graph, $H(P_i \\to P_j)$ is not generally equal to $H(P_j \\to P_i)$. However, in this specific case, the transition probability graph is symmetric with respect to reversing the node indices $(1,2,3,4) \\to (4,3,2,1)$, so we can deduce that $H(P_4 \\to P_1) = H(P_1 \\to P_4) = 9$. An explicit calculation confirms this. Let $g_i=H(P_i\\to P_1)$ with $g_1=0$. The system of equations is symmetric to the first, yielding $g_2=5, g_3=8, g_4=9$. Therefore,\n$$\nH(P_4\\to P_1)=g_4=9.\n$$\n\nThe commute time is defined by $C(P_1,P_4)=H(P_1\\to P_4)+H(P_4\\to P_1)$. Hence,\n$$\nC(P_1,P_4)=9+9=18.\n$$\n\nHitting times and commute times serve as robust distance measures for phenotype similarity in integrated networks. A random walk on the fused graph explores paths weighted by the aggregated multi-modal evidence. The hitting time $H(P_i\\to P_j)$ integrates over all possible paths from $P_i$ to $P_j$, weighted by their probabilities. A small hitting time implies the existence of many short, high-probability paths, indicating strong integrated similarity that may not be apparent from direct connections alone. The commute time $C(P_i,P_j)$ symmetrizes this metric, providing a distance-like measure that is sensitive to the global network topology. In network fusion, such walk-based distances are robust to noise in any single modality because they average over the entire ensemble of paths supported by the fused multi-modal structure, thus capturing a holistic view of node relatedness.",

Precision is defined as $TP/(TP+FP)$, so it is highly dependent on $FP$. Furthermore, in settings where $N \\gg P$, the False Positive Rate ($FPR=FP/N$) increases very *slowly* with additional false positives, which is why ROC can be misleadingly optimistic, not conservative. **Statement C is incorrect.**\n\n**Statement E: Precision-Recall curves are invariant to class prevalence $P/(P+N)$ and therefore have the same baseline regardless of sparsity; this invariance is the primary reason PR is preferred for biomedical networks.**\nThis statement is incorrect. ROC curves, not PR curves, are invariant to class prevalence. The baseline for a random classifier on a PR curve is a horizontal line at the class prevalence, $P/(P+N)$. Therefore, the baseline explicitly depends on sparsity. The shape and area under the PR curve are highly sensitive to prevalence, which is precisely why it is preferred for imbalanced data—it reflects the challenge of finding rare positives. **Statement E is incorrect.**\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, B, and D.",
