The specified conservation laws for adenine and nicotinamide nucleotide pools are common assumptions in metabolic modeling. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided to answer the questions. The language is objective and formal. To ensure the problem is not contradictory, the given steady state $x^{\\ast}$ must satisfy the conservation law $C x^{\\ast} = c$.\nLet's verify this:\n$$\nc = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{T} \\\\ N_{T} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n$$\nC x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first component of the resulting vector is $(1)(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) + (1)(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + (1)(0.3 \\times 10^{-3}) = (1.2 + 1.5 + 0.3) \\times 10^{-3} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$. This matches $A_{T}$.\nThe second component is $(1)(0.7 \\times 10^{-3}) + (1)(0.3 \\times 10^{-3}) = (0.7 + 0.3) \\times 10^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$. This matches $N_{T}$.\nSince $C x^{\\ast} = c$, the given values are consistent. There are no scientific, logical, or factual flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: The Reachable State Space $\\mathcal{A}$**\nThe set of reachable states is defined as $\\mathcal{A} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5} \\mid C x = c \\}$. This is the solution set of a system of linear equations. By definition in linear algebra, the solution set of a consistent non-homogeneous system of linear equations $Ax = b$ is an affine subspace. An affine subspace can be expressed as the sum of a particular solution $x_p$ to the system and the solution set of the corresponding homogeneous system $Ax = 0$.\nIn this problem, the system is $C x = c$. The problem states that a steady state $x^{\\ast}$ exists, which means $x^{\\ast}$ is a particular solution, and thus the system is consistent. Any other state $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$ can be written as $x = x^{\\ast} + y$ for some vector $y$. Substituting this into the equation gives $C(x^{\\ast} + y) = c$. By linearity, $C x^{\\ast} + C y = c$. Since $C x^{\\ast} = c$, it follows that $C y = 0$. The set of all such vectors $y$ is the null space of $C$, denoted $\\text{Null}(C)$, which is a vector subspace. Therefore, the reachable state space is $\\mathcal{A} = x^{\\ast} + \\text{Null}(C)$, which is an affine subspace formed by translating the vector subspace $\\text{Null}(C)$ by the vector $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe verification that $x^{\\ast} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ was performed during the validation step. We compute the product $C x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nC x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 0.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1.2 + 1.5 + 0.3) \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ (0.7 + 0.3) \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix} = c.\n$$\nSince $C x^{\\ast} = c$, the steady state $x^{\\ast}$ is indeed an element of the reachable state space $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n**Part 2: The Perturbation Subspace $\\mathcal{S}$**\nA perturbation is defined as $y = x - x^{\\ast}$, where $x$ is any state in $\\mathcal{A}$ and $x^{\\ast}$ is the specific steady state. We need to show that any such perturbation $y$ belongs to the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5} \\mid C y = 0 \\}$. Since both $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $x^{\\ast} \\in \\mathcal{A}$, they must satisfy the conservation equations: $C x = c$ and $C x^{\\ast} = c$.\nWe examine the effect of the matrix $C$ on the perturbation vector $y$:\n$$\nC y = C (x - x^{\\ast})\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of matrix multiplication:\n$$\nC y = C x - C x^{\\ast}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values for $Cx$ and $Cx^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nC y = c - c = 0\n$$\nThis shows that any perturbation vector $y$ must satisfy the equation $C y = 0$. Therefore, the perturbations are confined to the set $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{S}$ is a true vector subspace because it is the null space of the matrix $C$. The null space of a linear transformation is always a vector subspace. To formally demonstrate this, we verify the three axioms of a vector subspace:\n1.  **Presence of the zero vector**: The zero vector $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5}$ is in $\\mathcal{S}$ because $C(0) = 0$.\n2.  **Closure under addition**: Let $y_1, y_2 \\in \\mathcal{S}$. This means $C y_1 = 0$ and $C y_2 = 0$. Then $C(y_1 + y_2) = C y_1 + C y_2 = 0 + 0 = 0$. Thus, $y_1 + y_2 \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\n3.  **Closure under scalar multiplication**: Let $y \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and let $k$ be any scalar. This means $C y = 0$. Then $C(k y) = k(C y) = k(0) = 0$. Thus, $k y \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, $\\mathcal{S}$ is a vector subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{5}$.\n\n**Part 3: Dimension of the Perturbation Subspace $\\mathcal{S}$**\nThe dimension of the subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the null space of $C$, which is known as the nullity of $C$, denoted $\\text{nullity}(C)$. The Rank-Nullity Theorem for a matrix with $n$ columns states that $\\text{rank}(C) + \\text{nullity}(C) = n$.\nThe matrix $C$ is a $2 \\times 5$ matrix, mapping vectors from $\\mathbb{R}^{5}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Thus, the number of columns is $n=5$.\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (or column space), which is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). The two rows of $C$ are $r_1 = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$ and $r_2 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1)$. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other and are therefore linearly independent. For instance, the first three components of $r_2$ are zero while they are non-zero for $r_1$, and the last two components of $r_1$ are zero while they are non-zero for $r_2$.\nThus, the rank of $C$ is $\\text{rank}(C) = 2$.\nApplying the Rank-Nullity Theorem:\n$$\n\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{S}) = \\text{nullity}(C) = n - \\text{rank}(C) = 5 - 2 = 3.\n$$\nAlternatively, the dimension of the null space is equal to the number of free variables in the solution to the homogeneous system $C y = 0$. The system is:\n$$\ny_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} = 0\n$$\n$$\ny_{4} + y_{5} = 0\n$$\nThe matrix $C$ is already in row echelon form. The leading $1$'s correspond to the pivot variables $y_{1}$ and $y_{4}$. The remaining variables, $y_{2}$, $y_{3}$, and $y_{5}$, are free variables. There are $3$ free variables. The dimension of the null space is precisely the number of free variables.\nTherefore, the dimension of the perturbation subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ is $3$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the relationship between conservation laws and the stoichiometric matrix $S$. A vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ represents a conservation law if and only if $c^{\\top}S = 0$. This equation states that the vector $c$ lies in the left null space of the matrix $S$. The space of all such conservation-law vectors is therefore the left null space of $S$, which is equivalent to the null space of the transpose of $S$, denoted $\\ker(S^{\\top})$. The dimension of this space is what we need to determine for each of the three cases.\n\nWe are instructed to use the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that for any linear map $L$, $\\dim(\\ker(L)) + \\operatorname{rank}(L) = \\dim(\\text{domain of }L)$. We apply this theorem to the linear map represented by the matrix $S^{\\top}$. The map is $L: \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ given by $L(c) = S^{\\top}c$. The domain of this map is $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$, so its dimension is $m$. The theorem for $S^{\\top}$ is:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) + \\operatorname{rank}(S^{\\top}) = m $$\nA fundamental property of matrices is that the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose, i.e., $\\operatorname{rank}(S^{\\top}) = \\operatorname{rank}(S)$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) + \\operatorname{rank}(S) = m $$\nThe quantity we seek is the dimension of the space of conservation laws, which is $\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top}))$. Rearranging the equation gives the formula we will use:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(S) $$\nIn this problem, the number of species is constant, $m=5$. The task thus reduces to finding the rank of the stoichiometric matrix for each of the three specified network configurations.\n\n**Case 1: Baseline Network**\nThe stoichiometric matrix is $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 5}$.\n$$\nS = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  1  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  -1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  -1 \\\\\n-1  1  1  0  0 \\\\\n1  -1  -1  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find $\\operatorname{rank}(S)$, we determine the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let the rows be $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$.\nBy inspection, we can see relationships between the rows.\nThe sum of the first three rows is $r_1+r_2+r_3 = (-1, 1, 0, 0, 0) + (0, 0, 1, -1, 1) + (0, 0, 0, 1, -1) = (-1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$, which is exactly $r_4$. So, $r_4 = r_1+r_2+r_3$.\nAlso, we observe that $r_5 = -r_4 = (1, -1, -1, 0, 0)$.\nSince $r_4$ and $r_5$ are linear combinations of $r_1, r_2, r_3$, the rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent vectors among $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$. These three vectors are indeed linearly independent, as can be confirmed by setting their linear combination to zero: $c_1 r_1 + c_2 r_2 + c_3 r_3 = 0$ implies $c_1=c_2=c_3=0$.\nTherefore, the rank of the baseline matrix is $\\operatorname{rank}(S) = 3$.\nThe dimension of the conservation law space is $\\dim(\\ker(S^{\\top})) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(S) = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\n**Case 2: After Alteration $\\mathcal{A}$**\nAlteration $\\mathcal{A}$ adds a reaction $R_6\\!: A \\to \\varnothing$, which corresponds to adding the column vector $s_6 = (-1, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$ to the matrix $S$. The new stoichiometric matrix, $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$, is a $5 \\times 6$ matrix given by $S_{\\mathcal{A}} = [S | s_6]$.\nThe rank of $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is the dimension of the space spanned by the columns of $S$ and the new column $s_6$. The rank increases by one if $s_6$ is linearly independent of the columns of $S$. Otherwise, the rank remains the same.\nWe need to check if $s_6$ is in the column space of $S$, $\\operatorname{col}(S)$. The column space of $S$ has dimension $\\operatorname{rank}(S)=3$. Let the columns of $S$ be $c_1, \\dots, c_5$. We check if there exist scalars $\\alpha_i$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\alpha_i c_i = s_6$. Since $c_2 = -c_1$ and $c_5 = -c_4$, $\\operatorname{col}(S)$ is spanned by $\\{c_1, c_3, c_4\\}$. We test if $s_6$ is a linear combination of these three vectors:\n$$ \\alpha_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\alpha_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\alpha_4 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis vector equation yields a system of linear equations:\n1. $-\\alpha_1 = -1 \\implies \\alpha_1 = 1$\n2. $\\alpha_3 - \\alpha_4 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_3 = \\alpha_4$\n3. $\\alpha_4 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_4 = 0$, so $\\alpha_3 = 0$.\n4. $-\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_3 = 0 \\implies -1 + 0 = 0$, which is a contradiction.\nSince there is no solution, $s_6$ is not in the column space of $S$. The set of column vectors of $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is therefore of a higher dimension.\nHence, $\\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{A}}) = \\operatorname{rank}(S) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nThe dimension of the conservation law space for this altered network is $\\dim(\\ker(S_{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\top})) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{A}}) = 5 - 4 = 1$.\nThe addition of a sink for species $A$ has broken one of the conservation laws, reducing the dimension of their space from $2$ to $1$.\n\n**Case 3: After Alterations $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$**\nAlteration $\\mathcal{B}$ adds another reaction $R_7\\!: \\varnothing \\to C$, corresponding to the column $s_7 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. The new matrix, $S_{\\mathcal{AB}}$, is a $5 \\times 7$ matrix given by $S_{\\mathcal{AB}} = [S_{\\mathcal{A}} | s_7] = [S | s_6 | s_7]$.\nTo find $\\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{AB}})$, we check if $s_7$ is in the column space of $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$. From Case 2, we know that $\\operatorname{col}(S_{\\mathcal{A}})$ is spanned by the set $\\{c_1, c_3, c_4, s_6\\}$. We test if $s_7$ is a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n$$ \\alpha_1 c_1 + \\alpha_3 c_3 + \\alpha_4 c_4 + \\beta s_6 = s_7 $$\n$$ \\alpha_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\alpha_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\alpha_4 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1. $-\\alpha_1 - \\beta = 0 \\implies \\beta = -\\alpha_1$\n2. $\\alpha_3 - \\alpha_4 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_3 = \\alpha_4$\n3. $\\alpha_4 = 1 \\implies \\alpha_4=1$, so $\\alpha_3=1$.\n4. $-\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_3 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_1 = \\alpha_3 = 1$.\n5. $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_3 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_1 = \\alpha_3$, which is consistent.\nFrom (1), $\\beta = -1$.\nA solution exists: $\\alpha_1=1, \\alpha_3=1, \\alpha_4=1, \\beta=-1$. Thus, $s_7 = c_1 + c_3 + c_4 - s_6$.\nSince $s_7$ is in the column space of $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$, adding it does not increase the rank.\n$\\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{AB}}) = \\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{A}}) = 4$.\nThe dimension of the conservation law space for this final network is $\\dim(\\ker(S_{\\mathcal{AB}}^{\\top})) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(S_{\\mathcal{AB}}) = 5 - 4 = 1$.\nThis alteration does not break the remaining conservation law.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the linear space of conservation-law vectors for the three networks are $2$, $1$, and $1$, respectively. The first alteration increases the rank of the stoichiometric matrix by $1$, thus decreasing the dimension of the conservation law space by $1$. The second alteration involves a reaction vector that is linearly dependent on the existing reaction vectors (columns of $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$), so it does not change the rank, and the dimension of the conservation law space remains unchanged.\nThe results are to be provided as a row matrix with three integers.",
