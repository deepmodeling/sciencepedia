Derivation and Solution for Sensitivity with respect to $k$**\n\nLet $S_{x,k}(t) = \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial k}$. To find the ODE governing $S_{x,k}(t)$, we differentiate the state ODE with respect to $k$. We can interchange the order of differentiation with respect to $t$ and $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} S_{x,k}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial k}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)\n$$\nApplying this to the right-hand side of the state ODE, using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(-k\\,x) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial k} \\cdot x + k \\cdot \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial k}\\right) = -(1 \\cdot x + k \\cdot S_{x,k})\n$$\nEquating the results gives the sensitivity ODE for $S_{x,k}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d S_{x,k}}{dt} = -x - k S_{x,k}\n$$\nSubstituting the solution for $x(t) = x_{0} \\exp(-kt)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d S_{x,k}}{dt} + k S_{x,k} = -x_{0} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe initial condition for $S_{x,k}(t)$ is found by differentiating the state initial condition $x(0) = x_{0}$ with respect to $k$. Since $x_{0}$ is treated as an independent parameter from $k$:\n$$\nS_{x,k}(0) = \\frac{\\partial x(0)}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial x_{0}}{\\partial k} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(kt)$. Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(kt)\\frac{d S_{x,k}}{dt} + k\\exp(kt) S_{x,k} = -x_{0} \\exp(-kt) \\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe left side simplifies to the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S_{x,k}(t) \\exp(kt)\\right) = -x_{0}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$\nS_{x,k}(t) \\exp(kt) = \\int -x_{0} \\, dt = -x_{0}t + C_{1}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is the integration constant. Solving for $S_{x,k}(t)$:\n$$\nS_{x,k}(t) = (-x_{0}t + C_{1}) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nApplying the initial condition $S_{x,k}(0) = 0$:\n$$\n0 = (-x_{0} \\cdot 0 + C_{1}) \\exp(0) \\implies C_{1} = 0\n$$\nThus, the solution for the sensitivity with respect to $k$ is:\n$$\nS_{x,k}(t) = -x_{0} t \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\n**2.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the unscaled local parametric sensitivity of the state variable $x(t)$ with respect to the parameter $V_{\\max}$.

The parameters $V_{\\max}$ and $K_{m}$ are positive constants. The measured output is $y(t) = x(t)$. We are asked to find the sensitivity $S_{y,V_{\\max}}(t)$, defined as:\n$$\nS_{y,V_{\\max}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial y(t)}{\\partial V_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial V_{\\max}}\n$$\nWe will refer to this quantity as $S(t)$ for notational simplicity.

Thus, we do not need the absolute value within the logarithm.\n$$\n\\left( K_{m} \\ln(x(t)) + x(t) \\right) - \\left( K_{m} \\ln(x_{0}) + x_{0} \\right) = -V_{\\max} t\n$$\nThis equation provides an implicit solution for $x(t)$.\n\nNext, we find the sensitivity $S(t) = \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial V_{\\max}}$ by differentiating this implicit solution with respect to $V_{\\max}$. We treat $x(t)$ as a function of $V_{\\max}$ (and $t$), and apply the chain rule where appropriate. The terms involving only $x_{0}$ and $K_{m}$ have zero derivatives with respect to $V_{\\max}$, as per the problem statement ($\\frac{\\partial x_{0}}{\\partial V_{\\max}} = 0$) and the fact that $K_{m}$ is a parameter not dependent on $V_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{m} \\ln(x(t)) + x(t) - K_{m} \\ln(x_{0}) - x_{0} \\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} \\left[ -V_{\\max} t \\right]\n$$\nDifferentiating the left-hand side term by term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} (K_{m} \\ln(x(t))) = K_{m} \\frac{1}{x(t)} \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial V_{\\max}} = \\frac{K_{m}}{x(t)} S(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} (x(t)) = \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial V_{\\max}} = S(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} (- K_{m} \\ln(x_{0}) - x_{0}) = 0\n$$\nSo the derivative of the left-hand side is:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{m}}{x(t)} S(t) + S(t) = \\left( \\frac{K_{m}}{x(t)} + 1 \\right) S(t) = \\left( \\frac{K_{m} + x(t)}{x(t)} \\right) S(t)\n$$\nDifferentiating the right-hand side with respect to $V_{\\max}$ (treating $t$ as a constant in this context) gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\max}} (-V_{\\max} t) = -t\n$$\nEquating the derivatives of both sides, we obtain an algebraic equation for $S(t)$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{K_{m} + x(t)}{x(t)} \\right) S(t) = -t\n$$\nSolving for $S(t)$ yields the final expression for the sensitivity:\n$$\nS(t) = -t \\left( \\frac{x(t)}{K_{m} + x(t)} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the explicit analytic expression for the unscaled local sensitivity $S_{y,V_{\\max}}(t)$ as requested, expressed in terms of $x(t)$, $K_{m}$, and $t$.\n\nFinally, we analyze how $S_{y,V_{\\max}}(t)$ varies.\nFor $t > 0$, the time $t$ is positive. Since $x(t) > 0$ and $K_{m} > 0$, the fraction $\\frac{x(t)}{K_{m} + x(t)}$ is always positive. Due to the leading negative sign, the sensitivity $S_{y,V_{\\max}}(t)$ is always negative for $t > 0$. At $t=0$, $S(0)=0$. This negative sign is physically consistent: an increase in the maximum elimination rate $V_{\\max}$ will cause the concentration $x(t)$ to be lower at any subsequent time, hence the partial derivative must be negative.\n\nThe magnitude of the sensitivity is $|S(t)| = t \\frac{x(t)}{K_{m} + x(t)}$. This magnitude is a product of two terms: time $t$, which increases monotonically, and the term $\\frac{x(t)}{K_{m} + x(t)}$. Since $x(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of time, and the function $f(z) = \\frac{z}{K_{m}+z}$ is monotonically increasing for $z>0$, the term $\\frac{x(t)}{K_{m} + x(t)}$ is also a monotonically decreasing function of time.\nAt $t \\to 0$, $|S(t)| \\to 0$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $x(t) \\to 0$. In the regime where $x(t) \\ll K_{m}$, the state dynamics are approximately $\\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}x(t)$, leading to an exponential decay $x(t) \\sim \\exp(-\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}t)$. The magnitude of the sensitivity then behaves as $|S(t)| \\approx t \\frac{x(t)}{K_{m}} \\sim t \\exp(-\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}t)$, which approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$ because the exponential decay dominates the linear growth of $t$.\nSince the magnitude of the sensitivity starts at $0$ at $t=0$ and returns to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, it must achieve a maximum value at some intermediate time $t > 0$. This implies that the system's output $x(t)$ is most sensitive to changes in $V_{\\max}$ at an intermediate point along the decay curve, not at the beginning or far into the elimination process.",

The expectation of $Y$ is $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j} p_{j}\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j} \\mathbb{E}[p_{j}] = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThe variance of $Y$ is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[Y^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[Y^2] = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j} p_{j}\\right) $$\nDue to the independence of the parameters $p_{j}$, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\operatorname{Var}(a_{j} p_{j}) $$\nUsing the property $\\operatorname{Var}(cX) = c^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X)$, where $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j}^{2} \\operatorname{Var}(p_{j}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j}^{2} \\sigma_{j}^{2} $$\nSince all $\\sigma_{j}^{2} > 0$ and we can assume at least one $a_j \\neq 0$ for a non-trivial model, the total variance $\\operatorname{Var}(Y) > 0$.\n\nNext, we derive the first-order sensitivity index, $S_{i}$. By definition, $S_{i}$ measures the fraction of the total output variance that can be explained by the variance of parameter $p_{i}$ alone. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n$$ S_{i} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}_{p_{i}}(\\mathbb{E}_{p_{\\sim i}}[Y | p_{i}])}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)} $$\nwhere $p_{\\sim i}$ denotes the set of all parameters except $p_{i}$.\nFirst, we compute the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}_{p_{\\sim i}}[Y | p_{i}]$.

This is a direct consequence of the model's structure. The model is a linear combination of independent input parameters. In such 'additive' models, there are no interaction terms between parameters. The total-effect index $S_{T_{i}}$ accounts for the main effect of $p_{i}$ plus all interaction effects involving $p_{i}$. Since all interaction variances are zero, $S_{T_{i}}$ reduces to the first-order index $S_{i}$. The sum of the first-order indices is $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} S_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{a_{i}^{2}\\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j}^{2}\\sigma_{j}^{2}} = 1$, which confirms that the model variance is fully explained by the sum of the first-order effects, as expected for an additive model.",
