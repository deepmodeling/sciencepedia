            "problem": "In a canonical two-gene genetic toggle switch, each gene represses the other via transcription factor binding to an operator site, reducing the rate of transcription when bound. Under quasi-equilibrium binding governed by the law of mass action, the fraction of time that the operator is unbound can be modeled by a Hill-type repression function. Consider a repressor with concentration $x$ acting on a promoter whose normalized activity is given by the Hill repression function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^{n}}$, where $K$ is the dissociation constant (the concentration at which the promoter is half active), and $n$ is the effective Hill coefficient reflecting cooperativity or multi-site binding.\n\nAssume $K = 50\\ \\text{nM}$ and $n = 2$.

This value is the final answer.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the canonical model of a genetic toggle switch using Hill kinetics, a foundational concept in systems biology and synthetic biology. The use of log-sensitivity is a standard method for analyzing the responsiveness of biological circuits. All concepts are well-established.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-posed. The function $f(x)$ is clearly defined, as is the sensitivity $S(x)$. The given constants are sufficient to perform all requested calculations. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Conclusion:** The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem within the field of systems biomedicine.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for a multi-step analysis of a Hill-type repression function commonly found in models of genetic circuits.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Log-Sensitivity $S(x)$**\n\nThe local log-sensitivity $S(x)$ is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the output $f(x)$ with respect to the input $x$:\n$$S(x) = \\frac{d \\ln f(x)}{d \\ln x}$$\nUsing the chain rule for derivatives, this can be expressed as:\n$$S(x) = \\frac{d \\ln f(x)/dx}{d \\ln x/dx} = \\frac{f'(x)/f(x)}{1/x} = \\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}$$\nFirst, we find the natural logarithm of $f(x)$:\n$$\\ln f(x) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^n}\\right) = - \\ln\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)$$\nNow, we differentiate $\\ln f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln f(x) = - \\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^n} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln f(x) = - \\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n x^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right)$$\nWe can now compute $S(x)$ by multiplying this result by $x$:\n$$S(x) = x \\cdot \\frac{d \\ln f(x)}{dx} = x \\left[ - \\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n x^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$S(x) = - \\frac{n x^n / K^n}{1 + (x/K)^n}$$\nThis simplifies to the closed-form expression for the log-sensitivity:\n$$S(x) = - \\frac{n (x/K)^n}{1 + (x/K)^n}$$\n\n**2. Calculation and Interpretation of Promoter Activity**\n\nWe are given $K = 50\\ \\text{nM}$ and $n = 2$. The promoter activity function is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + (x/50)^2}$.\n\nAt $x = 25\\ \\text{nM}$ (i.e., $x = K/2$):\n$$f(25) = \\frac{1}{1 + (25/50)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + (1/2)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/4} = \\frac{1}{5/4} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nAt $x = 50\\ \\text{nM}$ (i.e., $x = K$):\n$$f(50) = \\frac{1}{1 + (50/50)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis confirms the definition of $K$ as the concentration yielding half-maximal repression (or half-activity).\n\nAt $x = 100\\ \\text{nM}$ (i.e., $x = 2K$):\n$$f(100) = \\frac{1}{1 + (100/50)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nInterpretation: The calculations show that as the repressor concentration $x$ doubles from $25\\ \\text{nM}$ to $50\\ \\text{nM}$, the promoter activity drops from $80\\%$ ($4/5$) to $50\\%$ ($1/2$). As the concentration doubles again to $100\\ \\text{nM}$, the activity drops further to $20\\%$ ($1/5$). This sharp change in promoter activity over a relatively narrow range of repressor concentrations is known as an ultrasensitive or switch-like response. The Hill coefficient $n > 1$ (here, $n=2$) is what generates this steepness. In a genetic toggle switch, this ultrasensitivity is a critical requirement for achieving bistability, where the system can stably exist in two distinct states (one gene 'on' and the other 'off', and vice versa). The steep response curves allow the nullclines of the two repressors to intersect at three points, with the two outer points representing the stable steady states of the switch.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Sensitivity at $x = K$**\n\nThe final task is to evaluate the log-sensitivity $S(x)$ at the specific point $x = K$ for the given Hill coefficient $n = 2$. We use the expression for $S(x)$ derived in the first part:\n$$S(x) = - \\frac{n (x/K)^n}{1 + (x/K)^n}$$\nSubstituting $x=K$ into the expression:\n$$S(K) = - \\frac{n (K/K)^n}{1 + (K/K)^n} = - \\frac{n \\cdot 1^n}{1 + 1^n} = - \\frac{n}{2}$$\nFor the given value $n=2$:\n$$S(K) = - \\frac{2}{2} = -1$$\nThis value, $S(K) = -1$, represents the maximal local sensitivity of the Hill function for $n=2$. It indicates that at the half-repression point, a small fractional change in the input concentration $x$ results in an equal but opposite fractional change in the output activity $f(x)$. For example, a $1\\%$ increase in $x$ around $K$ leads to approximately a $1\\%$ decrease in $f(x)$.",

Jacobian Matrix and Eigenvalues**\n\nTo analyze the linear stability of the fixed point, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, which is defined as:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe calculate the four partial derivatives from the functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\beta(1+y^n)^{-1}\\right) = \\beta(-1)(1+y^n)^{-2}(ny^{n-1}) = -\\frac{\\beta n y^{n-1}}{(1+y^n)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\beta(1+x^n)^{-1}\\right) = \\beta(-1)(1+x^n)^{-2}(nx^{n-1}) = -\\frac{\\beta n x^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this Jacobian matrix at the symmetric fixed point $(s, s)$:\n$$\nJ(s, s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\beta n s^{n-1}}{(1+s^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\beta n s^{n-1}}{(1+s^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can simplify the off-diagonal terms using the fixed-point relation $\\beta = s(1+s^n)$.

To find other potential real roots, we perform polynomial division of $8s^3+8s-5$ by $(s - \\frac{1}{2})$ or, more easily, by $(2s-1)$:\n$$\n(2s-1)(4s^2 + 2s + 5) = 8s^3 + 4s^2 + 10s - 4s^2 - 2s - 5 = 8s^3 + 8s - 5\n$$\nThe quadratic factor is $4s^2 + 2s + 5$. Its discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4(4)(5) = 4 - 80 = -76$. Since $\\Delta < 0$, the quadratic factor has no real roots.

The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial G_x}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial G_x}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G_y}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial G_y}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $n=2$, the partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_x}{\\partial x} = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\beta \\cdot 2y}{(1 + y^2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_y}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\beta \\cdot 2x}{(1 + x^2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_y}{\\partial y} = -1\n$$\nThus, the Jacobian matrix at a point $(x,y)$ is:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{2\\beta y}{(1 + y^2)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{2\\beta x}{(1 + x^2)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor each numerically found fixed point $(x^\\ast, y^\\ast)$, we will substitute these coordinates into the Jacobian matrix $J(x^\\ast, y^\\ast)$ and compute its eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. According to linear stability theory, the fixed point is locally asymptotically stable if and only if the real parts of all eigenvalues are strictly negative: $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i) < 0$ for all $i$. Otherwise, the fixed point is classified as unstable.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Procedure**\nThe overall algorithm for each value of $\\beta$ will be:\n1. Define the system of equations to be solved.\n2. Generate a set of initial guesses to robustly search the solution space.\n3. Use `scipy.optimize.root` to find the fixed points from these guesses.\n4. Collect and de-duplicate the valid solutions found within the domain $[0, \\beta] \\times [0, \\beta]$.\n5. Sort the unique fixed points by their $x$-coordinate in ascending order.\n6. For each sorted fixed point:\n    a. Construct the numerical Jacobian matrix.\n    b. Compute its eigenvalues using `numpy.linalg.eigvals`.\n    c. Classify stability based on the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues.\n7. Collate the results (number of points and their stabilities) into the specified list format.\nThis procedure will be repeated for each value of $\\beta$ in the test suite.",
