It presents a standard scenario in receptor pharmacology and requests derivations and calculations based on fundamental, well-established principles. All provided information is self-consistent and sufficient to solve the problem as stated.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Ligand Concentration $[L]$**\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the required ligand concentration $[L]$ to achieve a target fractional occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of the dissociation constant $K_D$ and $\\theta$. We start from the two provided fundamental bases:\n\n1.  Equilibrium dissociation constant: $K_D = \\dfrac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2.  Receptor conservation: $R_T = [R] + [RL]$\n\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = \\dfrac{[RL]}{R_T}$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the receptor conservation equation into the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nWe rearrange this equation to find an expression for the ratio of bound to free receptor, $\\dfrac{[RL]}{[R]}$:\n$$ \\theta ([R] + [RL]) = [RL] $$\n$$ \\theta[R] + \\theta[RL] = [RL] $$\n$$ \\theta[R] = [RL] - \\theta[RL] $$\n$$ \\theta[R] = [RL](1 - \\theta) $$\nThus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{[RL]}{[R]} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} $$\nNext, we rearrange the definition of the dissociation constant $K_D$ to solve for $[L]$:\n$$ [L] = K_D \\frac{[RL]}{[R]} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dfrac{[RL]}{[R]}$ into this equation yields the desired relationship between $[L]$, $K_D$, and $\\theta$:\n$$ [L] = K_D \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} $$\nThis expression allows calculation of the ligand concentration needed to achieve any target occupancy $\\theta$ if $K_D$ is known.\n\nNow, we compute the required concentration for the given values: $K_D = 5.0$ nM and $\\theta = 90\\% = 0.9$.\n$$ [L] = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9} = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\frac{0.9}{0.1} = (5.0 \\text{ nM}) \\times 9 = 45 \\text{ nM} $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures as requested, the required ligand concentration is $45.0$ nM.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Logarithmic Sensitivity $S$**\n\nThe task is to compute the logarithmic sensitivity $S$ of the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ with respect to the dissociation constant $K_D$, at a fixed ligand concentration $[L]$. The sensitivity is defined as:\n$$ S = \\frac{d \\ln \\theta}{d \\ln K_D} $$\nThis can be expanded using the chain rule for derivatives as $S = \\dfrac{K_D}{\\theta} \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dK_D}$. To proceed, we first need an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $K_D$ and a fixed $[L]$. We can rearrange the result from Part 1, $[L] = K_D \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta}$, to solve for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{[L]}{K_D} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} $$\n$$ \\frac{[L]}{K_D}(1 - \\theta) = \\theta $$\n$$ \\frac{[L]}{K_D} - \\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\theta = \\theta $$\n$$ \\frac{[L]}{K_D} = \\theta \\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_D}\\right) = \\theta \\left(\\frac{K_D + [L]}{K_D}\\right) $$\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]} $$\nThis is the standard form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a non-cooperative system.\n\nNow we compute the logarithmic sensitivity $S$. A direct approach using logarithmic differentiation is most efficient.\n$$ \\ln \\theta = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\\right) = \\ln[L] - \\ln(K_D + [L]) $$\nDifferentiating $\\ln \\theta$ with respect to $\\ln K_D$ (recalling that $[L]$ is held constant):\n$$ S = \\frac{d(\\ln \\theta)}{d(\\ln K_D)} = \\frac{d(\\ln[L] - \\ln(K_D + [L]))}{d(\\ln K_D)} $$\nSince $\\ln[L]$ is a constant with respect to $K_D$, its derivative is zero.\n$$ S = - \\frac{d(\\ln(K_D + [L]))}{d(\\ln K_D)} $$\nUsing the chain rule, $du = u \\cdot d(\\ln u)$, we have $d(\\ln(K_D + [L])) = \\dfrac{d(K_D+ [L])}{K_D+[L]} = \\dfrac{dK_D}{K_D+[L]}$ and $d(\\ln K_D) = \\dfrac{dK_D}{K_D}$.\n$$ S = - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{dK_D}{K_D + [L]} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{dK_D}{K_D} \\right)} = - \\frac{K_D}{K_D + [L]} $$\nWe can further simplify this expression. From the equation $\\theta = \\dfrac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$, we can write $1 - \\theta$:\n$$ 1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]} = \\frac{(K_D + [L]) - [L]}{K_D + [L]} = \\frac{K_D}{K_D + [L]} $$\nTherefore, the sensitivity is simply:\n$$ S = -(1 - \\theta) $$\nThis elegant result shows that the relative sensitivity of occupancy to changes in $K_D$ is equal to the negative of the fraction of unoccupied receptors.\n\nThe sensitivity is to be evaluated at the conditions determined in Part 1, which correspond to a target occupancy of $\\theta = 0.9$.\n$$ S = -(1 - 0.9) = -0.1 $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures as requested, the sensitivity is $-0.100$.\n\nThe final answers are the ligand concentration $[L] = 45.0$ nM and the sensitivity $S = -0.100$.",

The maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$, is the response at a saturating concentration of the agonist ($[A] \\to \\infty$):\n$$E_{\\max} = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} \\frac{E_m \\tau [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]} = \\frac{E_m \\tau}{1+\\tau}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the efficacy, $\\tau$:\n$$E_{\\max}(1+\\tau) = E_m \\tau$$\n$$E_{\\max} + E_{\\max}\\tau = E_m \\tau$$\n$$E_{\\max} = \\tau(E_m - E_{\\max})$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_m - E_{\\max}}$$\nThe half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$, is the concentration $[A]$ at which the response $E$ is half of the observed maximum, $E_{\\max}/2$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{E_m \\tau}{1+\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{E_m \\tau (EC_{50})}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}}$$\nDividing by $E_m \\tau$ (assuming $\\tau \\neq 0$ and $E_m \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2(1+\\tau)} = \\frac{EC_{50}}{K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50}}$$\n$$K_A + (1+\\tau)EC_{50} = 2(1+\\tau)EC_{50}$$\n$$K_A = (1+\\tau)EC_{50}$$\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\tau/K_A$, which is central to the transduction coefficient:\n$$\\frac{\\tau}{K_A} = \\frac{\\tau}{(1+\\tau)EC_{50}}$$\nWe substitute the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$1+\\tau = 1 + \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_m - E_{\\max}} = \\frac{E_m - E_{\\max} + E_{\\max}}{E_m - E_{\\max}} = \\frac{E_m}{E_m - E_{\\max}}$$\nBy substituting $1+\\tau$ and $\\tau$ into the expression for $\\tau/K_A$:\n$$\\frac{\\tau}{K_A} = \\frac{E_{\\max}/(E_m - E_{\\max})}{(E_m/(E_m - E_{\\max})) \\cdot EC_{50}} = \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_m \\cdot EC_{50}}$$\nThis provides a simple formula to calculate the ratio $\\tau/K_A$ from the experimental data. The transduction coefficient is then:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_m \\cdot EC_{50}}\\right)$$\n\nWe now apply this formula to the data provided for each ligand in each assay. The units of $EC_{50}$ are consistently in $\\text{nM}$, so the ratios required for the bias calculation will be dimensionless, and no unit conversion is necessary.\n\n**Assay 1: GPCR–cAMP**\n$E_{m,1} = 100$.\n\nFor ligand $X$: $E_{\\max,1}^{X} = 60$, $EC_{50,1}^{X} = 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{X,1} = \\frac{60}{100 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{60}{1000} = 0.06$$\nFor ligand $R$: $E_{\\max,1}^{R} = 90$, $EC_{50,1}^{R} = 3\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{R,1} = \\frac{90}{100 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{90}{300} = 0.3$$\n\nThe difference in transduction coefficients for Assay 1 is:\n$$\\Delta\\log_{1} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{X,1} - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{R,1} = \\log_{10}(0.06) - \\log_{10}(0.3) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.06}{0.3}\\right) = \\log_{10}(0.2)$$\n\n**Assay 2: RTK–ERK**\n$E_{m,2} = 1.0$.\n\nFor ligand $X$: $E_{\\max,2}^{X} = 0.8$, $EC_{50,2}^{X} = 25\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{X,2} = \\frac{0.8}{1.0 \\cdot 25} = \\frac{0.8}{25} = 0.032$$\nFor ligand $R$: $E_{\\max,2}^{R} = 0.5$, $EC_{50,2}^{R} = 30\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{R,2} = \\frac{0.5}{1.0 \\cdot 30} = \\frac{1}{60}$$\n\nThe difference in transduction coefficients for Assay 2 is:\n$$\\Delta\\log_{2} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{X,2} - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right)_{R,2} = \\log_{10}(0.032) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{60}\\right) = \\log_{10}(0.032 \\cdot 60) = \\log_{10}(1.92)$$\n\n**Bias Calculation**\nThe final pathway bias is calculated as the difference of these differences:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right) = \\Delta\\log_{1} - \\Delta\\log_{2} = \\log_{10}(0.2) - \\log_{10}(1.92)$$\n$$\\Delta\\Delta\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_A}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.2}{1.92}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{20}{192}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{5}{48}\\right)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{5}{48}\\right) \\approx \\log_{10}(0.1041666...)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{5}{48}\\right) \\approx -0.982273...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $-0.982$.\nThe negative sign indicates that ligand $X$, relative to reference ligand $R$, is biased towards Assay $2$ (RTK–ERK pathway) over Assay $1$ (GPCR–cAMP pathway).",
