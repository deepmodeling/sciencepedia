This first exercise provides practice with the core quantitative principle governing this interaction: the law of mass action at equilibrium. By calculating the fraction of occupied receptor sites based on the ligand concentration and the dissociation constant ($K_d$), you will solidify your understanding of how binding affinity dictates the initial response in a signaling cascade .

The cytosolic adaptor is present at a uniform total concentration of $5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the total number of receptor sites is sufficiently low that binding does not appreciably deplete the free adaptor concentration. Assume one-to-one binding stoichiometry between a receptor site and an adaptor molecule, that the reaction is not diffusion-limited, so equilibrium thermodynamics applies, and that the interaction can be treated within a thin reactive cytosolic layer adjacent to the membrane so that the quoted $K_d$ applies without additional geometric corrections.\n\nUsing the definition of the dissociation constant for the reaction $R + A \\rightleftharpoons RA$, where $R$ denotes a free receptor site, $A$ denotes free adaptor, and $RA$ denotes the bound complex, compute the equilibrium fraction of phosphorylated receptor sites on the membrane that are occupied by adaptor.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium and biomolecular interactions, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language.\n\nThe problem describes a reversible binding interaction between a phosphorylated receptor site, denoted by $R$, and a cytosolic adaptor protein, denoted by $A$. This interaction forms a receptor-adaptor complex, $RA$. The chemical reaction can be written as:\n$$R + A \\rightleftharpoons RA$$\nThe equilibrium state of this reaction is characterized by the thermodynamic dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the bound complex at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\nHere, $[R]$ represents the equilibrium concentration of free (unoccupied) receptor sites, $[A]$ is the equilibrium concentration of free adaptor protein, and $[RA]$ is the equilibrium concentration of the receptor-adaptor complex (occupied sites).\n\nThe goal is to compute the equilibrium fraction of phosphorylated receptor sites that are occupied by the adaptor. Let us denote this fraction by $\\theta$. This fraction is defined as the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptor sites to the total concentration of receptor sites. The total concentration of receptor sites, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free and occupied sites:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RA]$$\nThus, the fraction of occupied sites is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RA]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R] + [RA]}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of the known quantities, we can rearrange the definition of the dissociation constant to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = K_d \\frac{[RA]}{[A]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RA]}{\\left(K_d \\frac{[RA]}{[A]}\\right) + [RA]}$$\nAssuming that $[RA] > 0$ (i.e., some binding occurs), we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[RA]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[A]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[A]$ gives the final form of the binding isotherm, which is analogous to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm or the Michaelis-Menten equation form:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_d + [A]}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe dissociation constant is $K_d = 1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe total concentration of the cytosolic adaptor is $[A]_{\\text{total}} = 5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nA critical piece of information is the assumption that \"the total number of receptor sites is sufficiently low that binding does not appreciably deplete the free adaptor concentration.\" This implies that the amount of adaptor protein bound to receptors, $[RA]$, is negligible compared to the total amount of adaptor protein, $[A]_{\\text{total}}$. Therefore, the concentration of free adaptor protein, $[A]$, can be approximated as being equal to the total adaptor concentration:\n$$[A] \\approx [A]_{\\text{total}} = 5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nWe can now substitute the given values for $K_d$ and $[A]$ into the derived expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1~\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless fraction:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{5}{1 + 5} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nThus, the equilibrium fraction of phosphorylated receptor sites occupied by the adaptor is $\\frac{5}{6}$.

It describes a canonical model of competitive ligand binding to a single-site receptor, which is a fundamental concept in pharmacology and systems biology. The provided parameters and objectives are clear, consistent, and sufficient for a unique, meaningful solution. The problem requires the derivation of a standard equation and a subsequent calculation, both of which are based on the law of mass action and the principle of conservation of mass. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe system involves two reversible binding reactions at thermodynamic equilibrium:\n$1$. The binding of an agonist $A$ to a receptor $R$: $A + R \\rightleftharpoons AR$.\n$2$. The binding of a competitive antagonist (inhibitor) $I$ to the same receptor $R$: $I + R \\rightleftharpoons IR$.\n\nThe dissociation constant for the agonist, $K_{d}$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$\nSimilarly, the dissociation constant for the inhibitor, $K_{i}$, is:\n$$K_{i} = \\frac{[I][R]}{[IR]}$$\nHere, $[A]$, $[I]$, $[R]$, $[AR]$, and $[IR]$ represent the molar concentrations of the free agonist, free inhibitor, free receptor, agonist-receptor complex, and inhibitor-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $R_{T}$, is conserved.

To do this, we will express all terms in the receptor conservation equation in terms of $[AR]$, which is the numerator of the expression for $\\theta$.\n\nFrom the definitions of $K_{d}$ and $K_{i}$, we can express $[R]$ and $[IR]$ in terms of other species.\nFirst, we rearrange the expression for $K_{d}$ to solve for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d}[AR]}{[A]}$$\nNext, we rearrange the expression for $K_{i}$ to solve for the inhibitor-receptor complex concentration, $[IR]$:\n$$[IR] = \\frac{[I][R]}{K_{i}}$$\nWe can now substitute our expression for $[R]$ into this equation for $[IR]$:\n$$[IR] = \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}} \\left( \\frac{K_{d}[AR]}{[A]} \\right) = \\frac{[I]K_{d}[AR]}{K_{i}[A]}$$\nNow we have expressions for both $[R]$ and $[IR]$ in terms of $[AR]$, $[A]$, $[I]$, $K_{d}$, and $K_{i}$.
