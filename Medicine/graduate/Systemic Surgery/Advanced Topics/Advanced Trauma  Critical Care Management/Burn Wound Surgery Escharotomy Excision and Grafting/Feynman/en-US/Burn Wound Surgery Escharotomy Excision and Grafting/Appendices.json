            "problem": "A patient requires urgent surgical decision-making regarding escharotomy and staged excision and grafting following thermal injury. For initial operative planning and resuscitation, Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burned must be estimated from first principles using age-appropriate methods. Use the following definitions and facts as the foundational base:\n- Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) is the fraction of the total skin surface that is burned; it is commonly estimated in adults by the Rule of Nines, which allocates fixed regional fractions, and in children by the Lund–Browder chart, which adjusts regional fractions for age-related anthropometry.\n- In the Rule of Nines for adults, the anterior trunk contributes $0.18$ of TBSA, and each lower extremity contributes $0.18$ of TBSA.\n- In the Lund–Browder chart for a $5$-year-old child, use the following age-adjusted regional fractions: the anterior trunk contributes $0.18$ of TBSA, and each lower extremity contributes $0.165$ of TBSA.\n- A “circumferential burn” of a limb implies complete involvement of both anterior and posterior surfaces of that extremity.\n\nAn adult has circumferential burns of both lower extremities and the anterior trunk. A separate case involves a $5$-year-old child with the identical burn pattern. Starting from the definitions above, first estimate the adult’s burned TBSA using the Rule of Nines, then estimate the child’s burned TBSA using the provided Lund–Browder fractions. Finally, compute the absolute difference between the adult estimate and the child estimate, expressed as a unitless decimal fraction.\n\nRound your final answer to two significant figures and express it as a decimal fraction (do not use a percentage sign).",

It is scientifically grounded in established clinical methods for burn assessment, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) for an adult and a child with a specific burn pattern, and then find the absolute difference between these two estimates. The burn pattern consists of circumferential burns of both lower extremities and a burn of the anterior trunk.\n\nLet $TBSA_{\\text{adult}}$ denote the TBSA fraction for the adult, calculated using the Rule of Nines. The components are:\n1.  Burn of the anterior trunk: The problem states this contributes $T_{\\text{trunk, adult}} = 0.18$ to the TBSA.\n2.  Circumferential burns of both lower extremities: The rule allocates $0.18$ for each entire lower extremity. As both are circumferentially burned, their total contribution is $T_{\\text{legs, adult}} = 2 \\times 0.18 = 0.36$.\n\nThe total TBSA for the adult is the sum of these fractional areas:\n$$TBSA_{\\text{adult}} = T_{\\text{trunk, adult}} + T_{\\text{legs, adult}} = 0.18 + 0.36 = 0.54$$\n\nNext, let $TBSA_{\\text{child}}$ denote the TBSA fraction for the $5$-year-old child, calculated using the provided Lund-Browder fractions. The components are:\n1.  Burn of the anterior trunk: The problem provides an age-adjusted value of $T_{\\text{trunk, child}} = 0.18$.\n2.  Circumferential burns of both lower extremities: For a $5$-year-old, the Lund-Browder chart allocates $0.165$ for each lower extremity. The total contribution from both legs is $T_{\\text{legs, child}} = 2 \\times 0.165 = 0.33$.\n\nThe total TBSA for the child is the sum of these fractional areas:\n$$TBSA_{\\text{child}} = T_{\\text{trunk, child}} + T_{\\text{legs, child}} = 0.18 + 0.33 = 0.51$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the absolute difference, $\\Delta_{TBSA}$, between the adult and child estimates.\n$$\\Delta_{TBSA} = |TBSA_{\\text{adult}} - TBSA_{\\text{child}}|$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta_{TBSA} = |0.54 - 0.51| = 0.03$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value $0.03$ has one significant figure (the digit $3$). To express it with two significant figures, we add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context. The result is $0.030$.",

The relationship between blood flow, pressure, and resistance ($Q = \\Delta P / R$) is a fundamental principle of hemodynamics. The values for MAP ($70\\,\\text{mmHg}$) and compartment pressure ($35\\,\\text{mmHg}$) are clinically realistic for a patient developing compartment syndrome. The premise that external pressure raises venous outflow pressure due to the collapse of compliant veins is a cornerstone of compartment syndrome pathophysiology.

The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, unbiased clinical and physical terms. It is free from subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem that can be solved using the provided information and fundamental principles of physiology and physics. Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\n**1. Derive an expression for Perfusion Pressure (PP).**\n\nThe problem states that volumetric blood flow, $Q$, through the vascular bed is proportional to the pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, across it. This relationship is a form of Ohm's law for fluids:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\nwhere $R$ is the vascular resistance, assumed to be constant. For flow to occur ($Q > 0$), there must be a positive pressure gradient ($\\Delta P > 0$). This gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the effective Perfusion Pressure (PP) that drives blood through the tissue.\n\nThe pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ is the difference between the pressure at the inflow point of the vascular bed, $P_{\\text{in}}$, and the pressure at the outflow point, $P_{\\text{out}}$.\n$$\\text{PP} = \\Delta P = P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$$\n\nAccording to the problem's explicit assumptions:\n- The arterial inflow pressure, $P_{\\text{in}}$, is approximated by the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).\n$$P_{\\text{in}} \\approx \\text{MAP}$$\n- The venous outflow pressure, $P_{\\text{out}}$, is determined by the external pressure exerted by the swollen tissue within the fascial compartment. Veins are low-pressure, collapsible vessels. When the external compartment pressure, $P_{\\text{comp}}$, exceeds the normal low pressure within the veins, the veins collapse. For blood to flow out of the compartment, the pressure inside the veins must rise to at least match the external pressure to keep the vessels patent. Therefore, the effective outflow pressure that the arterial inflow must overcome is the compartment pressure itself.\n$$P_{\\text{out}} \\approx P_{\\text{comp}}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $P_{\\text{in}}$ and $P_{\\text{out}}$ into the equation for Perfusion Pressure, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\\text{PP} = \\text{MAP} - P_{\\text{comp}}$$\n\n**2. Compute the numerical value of the Perfusion Pressure.**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $\\text{MAP} = 70\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{comp}} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\\text{PP} = 70\\,\\text{mmHg} - 35\\,\\text{mmHg} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\n**3. Evaluate the adequacy of limb perfusion.**\n\nThe calculated Perfusion Pressure is $\\text{PP} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$. The problem states that the critical minimum perfusion gradient required for skeletal muscle survival is $30\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n\nWe compare the calculated value to this critical threshold:\n$$35\\,\\text{mmHg} > 30\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nBased on this static measurement, the calculated Perfusion Pressure is currently above the minimum threshold for tissue viability. However, the clinical context of \"progressive\" symptoms indicates a dynamic and deteriorating situation where the compartment pressure is likely still rising. A value so close to the critical threshold, in conjunction with neurological symptoms, signals impending irreversible ischemic injury and is a strong indication for emergent surgical decompression (escharotomy and/or fasciotomy). The calculation provides a quantitative justification for the clinical urgency.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the Perfusion Pressure.",

This relationship is defined by the mesh ratio.\n\nLet $E$ be the expansion factor.
