Since direct measurement of cardiac size is often impractical, clinicians rely on anthropometric surrogates like Body Surface Area ($BSA$). This exercise will guide you through a fundamental calculation to assess donor-recipient size compatibility using a standard formula, reinforcing the quantitative skills essential for preoperative planning.

            "problem": "In thoracic organ transplantation, the preoperative assessment of donor-recipient heart size compatibility commonly uses the Body Surface Area (BSA) as an anthropometric surrogate for cardiac size. From first principles appropriate to systemic surgery, use a clinically validated BSA model consistent with contemporary transplant practice to derive the donor-to-recipient BSA ratio and apply a mismatch criterion grounded in undersizing risk. Consider a donor with height $170\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and a recipient with height $180\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $85\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Compute the donor-to-recipient BSA ratio and determine whether the heart size mismatch exceeds an undersizing threshold of $0.20$. Report only the ratio $r$ as a unitless decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the donor-to-recipient Body Surface Area (BSA) ratio to assess heart size compatibility for a thoracic organ transplant. The solution involves selecting an appropriate BSA model, calculating the BSA for both the donor and the recipient, computing their ratio, and comparing the mismatch to a specified undersizing threshold.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted from the problem statement:\n- Donor height: $H_d = 170\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Donor weight: $W_d = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Recipient height: $H_r = 180\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Recipient weight: $W_r = 85\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Undersizing mismatch threshold: $0.20$\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the established clinical practice of using BSA as a surrogate for cardiac size in transplantation. All necessary data are provided. The instruction to use a \"clinically validated BSA model consistent with contemporary transplant practice\" allows for the selection of a standard, widely accepted formula. The Mosteller formula is one such model, known for its simplicity and accuracy, and is appropriate for this context. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe Mosteller formula for Body Surface Area (BSA), with area in square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$), height ($\\mathrm{cm}$), and weight ($\\mathrm{kg}$), is given by:\n$$\nBSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{H \\times W}{3600}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the BSA for the donor ($BSA_d$) using their height $H_d = 170\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $W_d = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$\nBSA_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{H_d \\times W_d}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{170 \\times 70}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{11900}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{119}{36}}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the BSA for the recipient ($BSA_r$) using their height $H_r = 180\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $W_r = 85\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$\nBSA_r = \\sqrt{\\frac{H_r \\times W_r}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{180 \\times 85}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{15300}{3600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{153}{36}}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the donor-to-recipient BSA ratio, denoted by $r$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{BSA_d}{BSA_r} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{119}{36}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{153}{36}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{119/36}{153/36}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{119}{153}}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction under the square root, we find the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator.\n$119 = 7 \\times 17$\n$153 = 9 \\times 17 = 3^2 \\times 17$\nSubstituting these factors into the expression for $r$:\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{\\frac{7 \\times 17}{3^2 \\times 17}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical value for the ratio $r$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3} \\approx \\frac{2.6457513}{3} \\approx 0.8819171\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nr \\approx 0.8819\n$$\nThe problem also asks to determine if the heart size mismatch exceeds an undersizing threshold of $0.20$. For a donor-to-recipient ratio $r  1$, the undersizing mismatch can be quantified as $1-r$. The condition for exceeding the threshold is $1-r > 0.20$.\nLet's calculate the mismatch:\n$$\n1-r = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3} \\approx 1 - 0.8819171 = 0.1180829\n$$\nWe compare this mismatch value to the threshold of $0.20$:\n$$\n0.1180829  0.20\n$$\nTherefore, the undersizing mismatch does not exceed the specified threshold.
