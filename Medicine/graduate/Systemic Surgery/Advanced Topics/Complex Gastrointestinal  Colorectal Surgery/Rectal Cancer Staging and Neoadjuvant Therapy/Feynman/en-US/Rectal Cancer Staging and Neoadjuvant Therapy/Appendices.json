This initial practice hones a fundamental skill: interpreting high-resolution MRI to identify features that predict surgical outcomes.

There is no internal sphincter involvement and no clear extramural venous invasion signal reported. The surgical intent is total mesorectal excision. Based on core oncological surgical principles, including the concept that the circumferential resection margin (CRM) corresponds anatomically to the total mesorectal excision (TME) plane at the mesorectal fascia, and widely accepted MRI risk thresholds used preoperatively to predict CRM status, determine whether the CRM is radiologically threatened and classify the patient’s risk category in terms of need for neoadjuvant therapy intensification.

            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical scenario and requested an evaluation based on established oncological and surgical principles. The task requires validating the problem statement, deriving a solution from first principles, and analyzing each provided option.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient age: $58$ years\n- Diagnosis: mid-rectal adenocarcinoma\n- Location: $7$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ from the anal verge\n- Imaging: High-resolution pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a phased-array coil\n- Key MRI finding: Minimal tumor-to-mesorectal fascia distance is $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ on the axial T2-weighted sequence\n- Additional findings: No internal sphincter involvement; no clear extramural venous invasion (EMVI) signal reported\n- Intended surgery: Total mesorectal excision (TME)\n- Stated Principle 1: The circumferential resection margin (CRM) corresponds anatomically to the TME plane at the mesorectal fascia.\n- Stated Principle 2: Widely accepted MRI risk thresholds are used preoperatively to predict CRM status.\n- Question: Determine if the CRM is radiologically threatened and classify the patient’s risk category for neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of rectal cancer staging and treatment planning, a core topic in surgical oncology. The use of high-resolution MRI to predict the circumferential resection margin (CRM) is the standard of care. The data provided (e.g., tumor location, distance to mesorectal fascia) are clinically realistic and sufficient to answer the question posed. The language is precise and free of subjective claims. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central issue is the interpretation of the preoperative MRI finding of a minimal tumor-to-mesorectal fascia distance of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This distance is used to predict the status of the circumferential resection margin (CRM) after total mesorectal excision (TME).\n\n1.  **Defining the Circumferential Resection Margin (CRM)**: The CRM is the tissue margin perpendicular to the long axis of the rectum. In a TME, this margin is the surgically created surface of the specimen, which corresponds to the mesorectal fascia. A histopathologically positive CRM, defined as the presence of tumor cells at or within $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of the resection margin, is one of the most powerful predictors of local recurrence and decreased survival in rectal cancer.\n\n2.  **Role of Preoperative MRI**: High-resolution MRI is the primary modality for local staging of rectal cancer. It allows for precise measurement of the distance from the outermost edge of the tumor to the mesorectal fascia. This measurement serves as a radiological surrogate to predict the likelihood of achieving a negative CRM at surgery.\n\n3.  **The Critical Threshold**: There is a broad international consensus, supported by extensive clinical evidence, on the MRI-based threshold for predicting CRM involvement. A tumor-to-mesorectal fascia distance of $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ or less ($\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) on preoperative MRI is defined as a \"threatened\" or \"at-risk\" CRM. This finding places the patient in a high-risk category for local recurrence if they proceed directly to surgery.\n\n4.  **Applying the Principle to the Case**: The given minimal distance is $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the CRM is, by definition, radiologically threatened. This is a high-risk feature, irrespective of the reported absence of clear EMVI.\n\n5.  **Implications for Neoadjuvant Therapy**: A threatened CRM is a primary indication for neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of neoadjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both) is to downstage and downsize the tumor, thereby increasing the distance between the tumor and the mesorectal fascia. This significantly improves the probability of achieving a clear CRM (an R0 resection) during surgery. For patients with high-risk features like a threatened CRM, treatment intensification is often recommended. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which involves delivering the full course of systemic chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy *before* surgery, has emerged as a standard and often preferred strategy for such cases. TNT aims to improve patient compliance with systemic therapy and address micrometastatic disease earlier.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The CRM is radiologically clear; this is a low-risk case, and the patient should proceed directly to surgery without neoadjuvant therapy.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. A distance of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is less than the $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ threshold, meaning the CRM is threatened, not clear. This defines the case as high-risk, not low-risk. Proceeding directly to surgery would carry a very high probability of a positive surgical margin, which is contrary to all oncological principles. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The CRM is radiologically threatened because the tumor-to-mesorectal fascia distance is less than $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; this constitutes a high-risk feature for local failure, and total neoadjuvant therapy (systemic chemotherapy plus pelvic chemoradiation before surgery) is recommended.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. It accurately identifies that a distance less than $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ($0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in this case) defines a threatened CRM. It correctly classifies this as a high-risk feature for local failure. Finally, it proposes an appropriate, modern, and evidence-based treatment strategy (total neoadjuvant therapy) for such a high-risk patient. **Correct**.\n\n**C. The CRM is only considered involved when the tumor touches the mesorectal fascia; a distance of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is intermediate risk, and short-course radiotherapy alone is appropriate without chemotherapy.**\nThe premise that the CRM is only threatened when the tumor touches the fascia (distance = $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is incorrect. The established radiological threshold is a distance of $\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Therefore, $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ signifies a high-risk, not intermediate-risk, situation. While short-course radiotherapy is an option for some rectal cancers, a more intensive regimen is generally favored for high-risk cases to maximize tumor regression. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The CRM status is equivocal at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; the risk is indeterminate, and watchful waiting with repeat MRI in $6$ months is recommended before any neoadjuvant therapy decision.**\nThe CRM status is not equivocal or indeterminate; it is clearly defined as threatened based on established criteria. Recommending \"watchful waiting\" for $6$ months for a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma with high-risk features is extremely dangerous and constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care. It would allow for tumor progression and potential metastasis, likely precluding a curative outcome. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The CRM is pathologically positive preoperatively at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, mandating abdominoperineal resection and no neoadjuvant therapy.**\nThis statement contains multiple fundamental errors. \"Pathologically positive\" is a term determined by a pathologist examining a surgical specimen; it cannot be determined preoperatively. MRI provides a radiological prediction, not a pathological fact. The decision for an abdominoperineal resection versus a sphincter-sparing procedure is based on tumor height and sphincter invasion, not solely on CRM status. Most importantly, recommending no neoadjuvant therapy for a high-risk threatened CRM is the opposite of the correct management. **Incorrect**.",

            "introduction": "Once the need for neoadjuvant therapy is established, it's crucial to understand the tools at our disposal. This exercise moves from anatomical assessment to the principles of radiobiology, using the Linear-Quadratic model to quantify the potency of different radiotherapy regimens. By calculating and comparing the Biologically Effective Dose (BED) for long-course and short-course radiotherapy, you will gain a deeper, quantitative understanding of why one approach may be favored over another to achieve significant tumor downsizing .",

            "problem": "A patient with clinically staged locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, planned for neoadjuvant therapy prior to total mesorectal excision, is considered for Long-Course Radiotherapy (LCRT) with concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Using the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model as the radiobiologic foundation, where the surviving fraction after a dose $D$ is $S(D)=\\exp(-\\alpha D-\\beta D^{2})$ for tumor tissue, define the Biologically Effective Dose (BED) for $n$ equal fractions of size $d$ as the dose that produces the same logarithmic cell kill if only the linear component were present. Compute the tumor BED for LCRT delivering a total physical dose of $50.4$ Gray (Gy) in $28$ fractions, assuming $\\alpha/\\beta=10$ Gy for tumor tissue. Express your final answer in Gray-equivalent for $\\alpha/\\beta=10$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{Gy}_{10}$) and round to four significant figures. Then, briefly interpret the clinical relevance of this BED compared to canonical Short-Course Radiotherapy (SC-RT) delivering $25$ Gy in $5$ fractions for tumor tissue in terms of potential tumor control within a neoadjuvant framework.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Biologically Effective Dose (BED) for a specific Long-Course Radiotherapy (LCRT) regimen for rectal cancer, based on the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model. Subsequently, a brief clinical interpretation is required by comparing this value to that of a standard Short-Course Radiotherapy (SC-RT) regimen.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the LQ model, which describes the surviving fraction, $S$, of a cell population after being exposed to a dose of ionizing radiation. For a single dose $D$, the surviving fraction is given by:\n$$S(D) = \\exp(-\\alpha D - \\beta D^2)$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are tissue-specific parameters representing the linear (lethal, single-hit) and quadratic (sublethal, multi-hit) components of cell killing, respectively. The total biological effect, often quantified as the logarithm of cell kill, for a single fraction of dose $d$ is $E_d = -\\ln(S(d)) = \\alpha d + \\beta d^2$.\n\nFor a fractionated radiotherapy course consisting of $n$ equal fractions of size $d$, the total effect $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of the effects of each fraction, assuming no cell repair or repopulation between fractions for simplicity in this model. Thus, the total log cell kill is:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = n \\times E_d = n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)$$\nThe total physical dose delivered is $D_{\\text{total}} = nd$.\n\nThe problem defines the Biologically Effective Dose (BED) as \"the dose that produces the same logarithmic cell kill if only the linear component were present\". Let this dose be denoted as $\\text{BED}$. The effect produced by this hypothetical dose would be purely linear, given by $\\alpha \\times \\text{BED}$. By equating the total effect of the fractionated course to the effect of the BED, we establish the relationship:\n$$\\alpha \\times \\text{BED} = n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)$$\nTo solve for $\\text{BED}$, we divide the entire equation by $\\alpha$:\n$$\\text{BED} = n \\left(d + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} d^2\\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form by factoring out $nd$ and using the given $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio:\n$$\\text{BED} = nd \\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$$\nGiven that the total physical dose is $D_{\\text{total}} = nd$, the formula becomes:\n$$\\text{BED} = D_{\\text{total}} \\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specified LCRT regimen.\nThe given parameters are:\nTotal physical dose, $D_{\\text{total}} = 50.4$ Gy.\nNumber of fractions, $n = 28$.\nThe $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio for the tumor tissue is given as $10$ Gy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the dose per fraction, $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{D_{\\text{total}}}{n} = \\frac{50.4 \\text{ Gy}}{28} = 1.8 \\text{ Gy}$$\nNext, we substitute these values into the BED formula:\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} = 50.4 \\text{ Gy} \\left(1 + \\frac{1.8 \\text{ Gy}}{10 \\text{ Gy}}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} = 50.4 \\left(1 + 0.18\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} = 50.4 \\times 1.18$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} = 59.472 \\text{ Gy}_{10}$$\nThe notation $\\text{Gy}_{10}$ signifies that this is a biologically effective dose calculated with an $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio of $10$ Gy. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} \\approx 59.47 \\text{ Gy}_{10}$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must interpret the clinical relevance of this BED in terms of potential tumor control by comparing it to a canonical SC-RT regimen. The SC-RT regimen is given as $25$ Gy in $5$ fractions.\nWe calculate the BED for this SC-RT regimen for the tumor, using the same $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio of $10$ Gy.\nTotal physical dose, $D_{\\text{total}} = 25$ Gy.\nNumber of fractions, $n = 5$.\nDose per fraction, $d = \\frac{25 \\text{ Gy}}{5} = 5 \\text{ Gy}$.\n\nUsing the BED formula for the SC-RT regimen:\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{SC-RT}} = 25 \\text{ Gy} \\left(1 + \\frac{5 \\text{ Gy}}{10 \\text{ Gy}}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{SC-RT}} = 25 \\left(1 + 0.5\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{SC-RT}} = 25 \\times 1.5$$\n$$\\text{BED}_{\\text{SC-RT}} = 37.5 \\text{ Gy}_{10}$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe Biologically Effective Dose (BED) quantifies the total biological damage inflicted on a tissue by a particular radiotherapy schedule. A higher BED value corresponds to a greater predicted degree of cell kill.\n\nComparing the two regimens for tumor tissue ($\\alpha/\\beta=10$ Gy):\n- LCRT: $\\text{BED}_{\\text{LCRT}} \\approx 59.47 \\text{ Gy}_{10}$\n- SC-RT: $\\text{BED}_{\\text{SC-RT}} = 37.5 \\text{ Gy}_{10}$\n\nThe LCRT regimen delivers a substantially higher BED to the tumor than the SC-RT regimen. This radiobiological calculation predicts that the LCRT schedule will achieve a greater degree of tumor cell destruction and is therefore more likely to result in significant tumor shrinkage (downstaging) and an increased probability of a pathologic complete response (pCR). In the context of neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer, where the primary objective is often to downsize the tumor to facilitate a successful surgical resection with clear margins (R0 resection), the higher tumor BED of LCRT is of paramount clinical relevance. The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to LCRT further potentiates this effect, making this approach a standard of care when maximal cytoreduction is the clinical goal.",

            "problem": "A surgical oncology unit adopts a risk-adapted neoadjuvant strategy for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma based on preoperative pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features that predict local and distant failure. The strategy considers four MRI-derived risk factors: extramural depth (EMD) of tumor invasion beyond the muscularis propria (measured in $\\mathrm{mm}$), circumferential resection margin (CRM) clearance (minimum distance from tumor, tumor deposit, or malignant node to the mesorectal fascia, measured in $\\mathrm{mm}$), extramural venous invasion (EMVI), and nodal status (clinical $\\mathrm{N}$-category). Three neoadjuvant approaches are available: long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT; conventionally fractionated pelvic radiotherapy with concurrent fluoropyrimidine), short-course radiotherapy with delayed surgery (SC-RT with delay; hypofractionated pelvic radiotherapy followed by an interval to surgery), and total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT; delivery of the full systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy components before surgery).\n\nUse the following core definitions and well-tested clinical facts as the fundamental base for reasoning:\n- Threatened CRM signifies an increased risk of positive margins and local recurrence and is conventionally defined when the tumor, tumor deposit, or malignant node lies within $\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of the mesorectal fascia on MRI.\n- Larger EMD corresponds to higher $\\mathrm{T3}$ subdivisions (for example, $\\mathrm{T3a}$ if $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\mathrm{T3b}$ if $1$–$5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\mathrm{T3c}$ if $>5$–$15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $\\mathrm{T3d}$ if $>15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).\n- EMVI positivity and higher nodal burden (for example, $\\mathrm{cN2}$) correlate strongly with distant metastasis risk.\n- Long-course chemoradiotherapy generally yields greater local tumor regression and margin downsizing than short-course radiotherapy alone; short-course radiotherapy with an interval can still achieve modest downstaging; and delivering full-dose systemic chemotherapy as part of total neoadjuvant therapy is associated with improved systemic control in high-risk populations.\n\nThree patients with mid-to-low rectal tumors are staged by high-resolution MRI:\n\n- Case $1$: Mid-rectal tumor at $8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ from the anal verge.

The risk factors, staging criteria (e.g., EMD for T3 sub-staging, CRM definition), and treatment modalities (LCRT, SC-RT, TNT) are standard in clinical oncology. The provided clinical facts accurately reflect evidence from major clinical trials and are consistent with guidelines from bodies like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). The description of $\\mathrm{cT4a}$ in Case $3$ is slightly imprecise, as its definition is \"transmural extension beyond the muscularis propria\", which is the definition for a $\\mathrm{T3}$ tumor. The standard definition of $\\mathrm{T4a}$ is perforation of the visceral peritoneum.

This minor imperfection does not invalidate the problem's core logic.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides three distinct clinical cases and a set of rules (clinical facts) to map these cases to a set of available treatments. The goal is clear and a logical, unique solution can be derived.\n*   **Objective:** The problem is objective. It uses quantitative data and established clinical definitions.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a systematic risk assessment for each case, followed by matching the risk profile to the most appropriate therapy based on the provided principles.\n\n**Principles of Therapy Selection:**\n*   **High Local Recurrence Risk (e.g., threatened CRM):** The primary goal is maximal tumor downsizing to achieve a clear surgical margin. The problem states LCRT provides greater local tumor regression than SC-RT. Therefore, **LCRT** is the preferred modality for this scenario.\n*   **High Systemic Recurrence Risk (e.g., EMVI+, cN2):** The primary goal is to control micrometastatic disease. The problem states TNT improves systemic control in high-risk populations by delivering full-dose systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, **TNT** is the preferred modality for this scenario.\n*   **Intermediate Risk (e.g., cT3 with clear CRM, no high-risk features):** The goal is to reduce local recurrence risk without the full intensity of chemoradiation if not necessary. The problem states SC-RT with delay can achieve modest downstaging. For a \"good-risk\" locally advanced tumor, **SC-RT with delay** is an effective and often preferred option due to a more favorable toxicity profile and shorter radiation course compared to LCRT, and avoiding the unnecessary systemic chemotherapy of TNT.\n\n**Analysis of Cases:**\n\n*   **Case $1$:**\n    *   Risk Factors: $\\mathrm{cT3b}$ (EMD $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), CRM clear ($3.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), EMVI negative, $\\mathrm{cN0}$.\n    *   Risk Assessment: This is a standard or intermediate-risk locally advanced rectal cancer. The local risk is moderate ($\\mathrm{cT3b}$), but crucially, the CRM is clear, meaning there is no immediate threat of a positive margin. The systemic risk is low (EMVI negative, $\\mathrm{cN0}$).\n    *   Therapy Match: The primary need is for neoadjuvant radiotherapy to reduce local recurrence risk, but maximal downsizing is not critical. There is no indication for aggressive systemic chemotherapy. **SC-RT with delay** is an ideal fit, providing effective local therapy while avoiding the higher toxicity and longer duration of LCRT, and avoiding the unnecessary systemic chemotherapy of TNT.\n\n*   **Case $2$:**\n    *   Risk Factors: $\\mathrm{cT3c}$ (EMD $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), CRM threatened ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), EMVI negative, $\\mathrm{cN1}$.\n    *   Risk Assessment: This case is dominated by a high risk of local failure. The CRM is threatened ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), and the tumor is bulky ($\\mathrm{cT3c}$, EMD $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and low in the rectum. Achieving a negative resection margin (R0) is paramount. The systemic risk is moderate ($\\mathrm{cN1}$), but the immediate challenge is local control.\n    *   Therapy Match: The defining feature is the threatened CRM. The principle states that LCRT provides superior tumor regression and margin downsizing. Therefore, **LCRT** is the indicated therapy to maximize the chance of converting the threatened margin to a clear margin at surgery.\n\n*   **Case $3$:**\n    *   Risk Factors: $\\mathrm{cT4a}$, CRM clear ($4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), EMVI positive, $\\mathrm{cN2}$.\n    *   Risk Assessment: This case is defined by a very high risk of systemic failure (distant metastasis). The presence of both EMVI positivity and a high nodal burden ($\\mathrm{cN2}$) are explicitly stated as strong correlates with distant metastasis. While the T-stage is also advanced, the CRM is clear, making the systemic risk the most urgent therapeutic target.\n    *   Therapy Match: To address the high risk of distant disease, early and effective systemic chemotherapy is required. The principle states that TNT, which integrates full-dose systemic chemotherapy, improves systemic control in such high-risk populations. Therefore, **TNT** is the most appropriate strategy.\n\n**Summary of Assignments:**\n*   Case $1$ (intermediate risk, clear CRM) $\\rightarrow$ SC-RT with delay\n*   Case $2$ (high local risk, threatened CRM) $\\rightarrow$ LCRT\n*   Case $3$ (high systemic risk, EMVI+, cN2) $\\rightarrow$ TNT\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Case $1$: SC-RT with delay; Case $2$: LCRT; Case $3$: TNT**\n    *   This assignment perfectly matches the derived optimal strategy for all three cases based on the provided principles of risk stratification.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Case $1$: LCRT; Case $2$: SC-RT with delay; Case $3$: TNT**\n    *   The assignment for Case $2$ is incorrect. SC-RT with delay offers less tumor downsizing than LCRT and is therefore inappropriate for a patient with a threatened CRM. The assignment for Case $1$ is plausible but less optimal than SC-RT in a risk-stratified model.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Case $1$: SC-RT with delay; Case $2$: TNT; Case $3$: LCRT**\n    *   The assignment for Case $3$ is incorrect. This patient has a very high risk for distant metastasis and would be significantly undertreated with LCRT alone, which does not incorporate the full systemic chemotherapy component of TNT. The assignment for Case $2$ (TNT) is debatable but less precise than LCRT, as the primary problem is local. The swap between Case $2$ and Case $3$ therapies is a critical error.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Case $1$: SC-RT with delay; Case $2$: LCRT; Case $3$: SC-RT with delay**\n    *   The assignment for Case $3$ is incorrect. SC-RT with delay provides neither the required local response for a $\\mathrm{cT4a}$ tumor nor the necessary systemic therapy to address the EMVI+ and $\\mathrm{cN2}$ status. This represents significant undertreatment.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
