            "problem": "A cervical mediastinoscopy is planned in an average adult, with the goal of advancing the mediastinoscope safely from the suprasternal (sternal) notch to the carina by maintaining a trajectory parallel to the tracheal axis. For safe technique, the instrument should remain in the pretracheal plane without violating adjacent vascular structures. Assume the following widely observed morphometric relationships, based on Computed Tomography (CT) in the sagittal plane, for an average adult in slight neck extension: the anterior surface of the trachea at the level of the suprasternal notch lies approximately $2.5$ cm posterior to the skin at the notch; the carina is located approximately $6.0$ cm inferior to the notch and $5.0$ cm posterior to the notch’s vertical projection. Model the tracheal axis locally as a straight line in the sagittal plane. Using only first principles of Euclidean geometry and the standard trigonometric definitions, derive the instrument’s trajectory angle relative to the cranio-caudal vertical and, under the assumption that the instrument is first advanced posteriorly to reach the pretracheal plane at the notch level and then advanced along the tracheal axis to the carina, compute the expected total insertion depth from the skin at the suprasternal notch to the carina. Express the angle in degrees during your derivation, but report only the final total insertion depth in centimeters. Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express it in cm.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the total insertion depth of a mediastinoscope following a specific two-stage trajectory. To solve this, we will model the procedure in a two-dimensional sagittal plane using Euclidean geometry.\n\nFirst, we establish a Cartesian coordinate system. Let the point of insertion on the skin at the suprasternal notch be the origin, $O=(0, 0)$. We define the positive horizontal axis (x-axis) as the posterior direction and the positive vertical axis (y-axis) as the inferior (caudal) direction. Therefore, the cranio-caudal vertical line corresponds to the y-axis.\n\nNext, we identify the coordinates of the key anatomical landmarks based on the provided data.\n1.  The skin entry point at the suprasternal notch is the origin, $O=(0, 0)$.\n2.  The anterior surface of the trachea at the level of the suprasternal notch is stated to be $2.5$ cm posterior to the skin. This point, which we will label $N$, represents the starting point for the angled part of the insertion. Its coordinates are $N=(2.5, 0)$.\n3.  The carina is located $6.0$ cm inferior to the notch and $5.0$ cm posterior to the notch's vertical projection. This target point, which we label $C$, has coordinates $C=(5.0, 6.0)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the instrument's path as a two-segment trajectory:\n1.  The first segment is a straight posterior advancement from the skin at the origin $O$ to the pretracheal plane at point $N$.\n2.  The second segment is an angled advancement from point $N$ to the carina at point $C$. This path is described as being parallel to the tracheal axis, which is modeled as a straight line.\n\nThe total insertion depth, $D$, is the sum of the lengths of these two segments. Let $d_1$ be the length of the segment from $O$ to $N$, and $d_2$ be the length of the segment from $N$ to $C$. Thus, $D = d_1 + d_2$.\n\nFirst, we derive the trajectory angle of the second segment, as requested for the derivation. This trajectory is defined by the vector $\\vec{NC}$.\nThe vector components are found by subtracting the coordinates of the initial point $N$ from the final point $C$:\n$$ \\vec{NC} = (C_x - N_x, C_y - N_y) = (5.0 - 2.5, 6.0 - 0) = (2.5, 6.0) $$\nThe horizontal (posterior) component of the displacement is $\\Delta x = 2.5$ cm, and the vertical (inferior) component is $\\Delta y = 6.0$ cm.\nThe trajectory angle, $\\theta$, relative to the cranio-caudal vertical (the y-axis) can be determined using trigonometry. In the right-angled triangle formed by the displacement components, $\\theta$ is the angle between the hypotenuse (the trajectory path) and the vertical side ($\\Delta y$). The tangent of this angle is the ratio of the opposite side ($\\Delta x$) to the adjacent side ($\\Delta y$):\n$$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{2.5}{6.0} = \\frac{5}{12} $$\nThe angle is therefore $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right)$. Converting to degrees, this is approximately $\\theta \\approx 22.62^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we compute the lengths of the two path segments to find the total insertion depth.\nThe length of the first segment, $d_1$, is the distance from $O=(0,0)$ to $N=(2.5,0)$. This is a purely horizontal displacement.\n$$ d_1 = \\sqrt{(2.5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{2.5^2} = 2.5 \\text{ cm} $$\n\nThe length of the second segment, $d_2$, is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{NC}$, which is the Euclidean distance between points $N$ and $C$. We use the Pythagorean theorem with the components $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ calculated earlier.\n$$ d_2 = |\\vec{NC}| = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2} = \\sqrt{(2.5)^2 + (6.0)^2} $$\n$$ d_2 = \\sqrt{6.25 + 36.0} = \\sqrt{42.25} $$\nThe square root of $42.25$ is exactly $6.5$.\n$$ d_2 = 6.5 \\text{ cm} $$\n\nThe total insertion depth, $D$, is the sum of $d_1$ and $d_2$.\n$$ D = d_1 + d_2 = 2.5 \\text{ cm} + 6.5 \\text{ cm} = 9.0 \\text{ cm} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $9.0$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $9.00$. The unit is cm.",

As part of systemic surgical staging, a trans-cervical video-assisted mediastinoscopy is performed with systematic sampling of stations $2\\mathrm{R}$, $2\\mathrm{L}$, $4\\mathrm{R}$, and $4\\mathrm{L}$. In this clinical context, the indication for mediastinoscopy is to confirm or exclude N2 disease because the presence of N2 disease alters the choice of resection and the role of induction therapy.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian probability as applied to medical diagnostics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a general expression for the posterior probability $P(N2 \\mid T^{-})$ and its subsequent numerical calculation. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, which we will derive from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $N2$ be the event that the patient has N2 disease, and let $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test result. We are asked to find $P(N2 \\mid T^{-})$, the probability of having N2 disease given a negative test.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$\nP(N2 \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{P(N2 \\cap T^{-})}{P(T^{-})}\n$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(N2 \\cap T^{-})$, is the joint probability of having N2 disease and receiving a negative test result. It can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability as:\n$$\nP(N2 \\cap T^{-}) = P(T^{-} \\mid N2) P(N2)\n$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. The sample space of patients can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets: those with N2 disease ($N2$) and those without ($\\neg N2$). By the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^{-})$ by summing over these partitions:\n$$\nP(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} \\cap N2) + P(T^{-} \\cap \\neg N2)\n$$\n\nApplying the definition of conditional probability to each term in the sum gives:\n$$\nP(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} \\mid N2) P(N2) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg N2) P(\\neg N2)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into our original equation for $P(N2 \\mid T^{-})$ yields the general formula, which is Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$\nP(N2 \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} \\mid N2) P(N2)}{P(T^{-} \\mid N2) P(N2) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg N2) P(\\neg N2)}\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the posterior probability $P(N2 \\mid T^{-})$.\n\nNext, we will compute the numerical value using the provided parameters. The givens are:\n- The prior probability of N2 disease: $P(N2) = 0.40$.\n- The test sensitivity: $\\mathrm{Se} = P(T^{+} \\mid N2) = 0.80$.\n- The test specificity: $\\mathrm{Sp} = P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg N2) = 0.99$.\n\nFrom these, we derive the probabilities needed for our formula:\n1.  The probability of not having N2 disease is the complement of having it:\n    $$\n    P(\\neg N2) = 1 - P(N2) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n    $$\n2.  The probability of a negative test given the disease is present, $P(T^{-} \\mid N2)$, is the false negative rate. This is the complement of the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} \\mid N2)$, because for a patient with N2 disease, the test can only be positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$).\n    $$\n    P(T^{-} \\mid N2) = 1 - P(T^{+} \\mid N2) = 1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\n    $$\n3.  The probability of a negative test given the disease is not present, $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg N2)$, is the specificity, which is given directly:\n    $$\n    P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg N2) = \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.99\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived Bayesian formula:\n$$\nP(N2 \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{(0.20)(0.40)}{(0.20)(0.40) + (0.99)(0.60)}\n$$\n\nWe calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $0.20 \\times 0.40 = 0.08$.\n- Denominator, first term: $0.20 \\times 0.40 = 0.08$.\n- Denominator, second term: $0.99 \\times 0.60 = 0.594$.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$\nP(N2 \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.594} = \\frac{0.08}{0.674}\n$$\n\nFinally, we perform the division and round the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nP(N2 \\mid T^{-}) \\approx 0.118694362...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1187$. This represents the negative predictive value of the test in this specific patient context, which is the probability that the patient actually has N2 disease even though the mediastinoscopy was negative.",
