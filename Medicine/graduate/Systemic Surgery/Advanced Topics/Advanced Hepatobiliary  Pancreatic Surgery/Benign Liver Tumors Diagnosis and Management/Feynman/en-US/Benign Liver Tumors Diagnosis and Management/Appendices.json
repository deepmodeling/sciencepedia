            "problem": "A $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ patient is being evaluated for benign liver tumors using dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Two contrast-enhanced protocols are under consideration:\n\n- Gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA), a hepatocyte-specific agent, dosed at $0.025$ $\\mathrm{mmol/kg}$ with a supplied concentration of $0.25$ $\\mathrm{mmol/mL}$.\n- A standard extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), dosed at $0.1$ $\\mathrm{mmol/kg}$ with a supplied concentration of $0.5$ $\\mathrm{mmol/mL}$.\n\nBoth agents are to be administered using a power injector at a constant volumetric rate of $2.0$ $\\mathrm{mL/s}$. Assume the injection is an ideal top-hat bolus with negligible dispersion prior to the arterial circulation and neglect any saline chaser for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that (i) total molar amount equals dose per unit mass multiplied by body mass, (ii) injected volume equals molar amount divided by supplied concentration, and (iii) injection duration equals injected volume divided by volumetric flow rate, compute the difference in the mid-bolus times (defined as one-half of the injection duration from the start of injection) between the two protocols. Interpret the sign as the mid-bolus time of the extracellular protocol minus that of the gadoxetate protocol.\n\nBriefly explain, based on first principles of bolus timing and dynamic imaging of benign liver tumors, how this difference would influence arterial phase acquisition timing and the risk of mistiming hypervascular lesion characterization.\n\nExpress the final answer as a single real number in seconds, rounding to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical physics and pharmacology, specifically relating to contrast agent dynamics in MRI. All necessary data and definitions are provided, forming a well-posed problem that is objective and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the difference in mid-bolus times between two contrast agent protocols and an interpretation of this difference in the context of dynamic liver imaging. Let us denote the parameters for the gadoxetate disodium protocol with subscript $1$ and for the standard extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) protocol with subscript $2$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Patient body mass, $m = 70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Injection flow rate, $Q = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{mL/s}$.\n\nFor Protocol $1$ (Gadoxetate disodium):\n- Dose per unit mass, $D_1 = 0.025$ $\\mathrm{mmol/kg}$.\n- Supplied concentration, $C_1 = 0.25$ $\\mathrm{mmol/mL}$.\n\nFor Protocol $2$ (Standard extracellular GBCA):\n- Dose per unit mass, $D_2 = 0.1$ $\\mathrm{mmol/kg}$.\n- Supplied concentration, $C_2 = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{mmol/mL}$.\n\nThe problem provides a sequence of definitions to calculate the mid-bolus time, $T_{mid}$. Let us first derive a general symbolic expression for $T_{mid}$.\n\nFirst, the total molar amount of contrast agent, $N$, is the product of the dose per unit mass, $D$, and the patient's body mass, $m$:\n$$N = D \\cdot m$$\n\nSecond, the total volume of contrast agent to be injected, $V$, is the total molar amount, $N$, divided by the supplied concentration, $C$:\n$$V = \\frac{N}{C} = \\frac{D \\cdot m}{C}$$\n\nThird, the duration of the injection, $T_{inj}$, is the total injected volume, $V$, divided by the constant volumetric flow rate, $Q$:\n$$T_{inj} = \\frac{V}{Q} = \\frac{D \\cdot m}{C \\cdot Q}$$\n\nFinally, the mid-bolus time, $T_{mid}$, is defined as one-half of the injection duration:\n$$T_{mid} = \\frac{T_{inj}}{2} = \\frac{D \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot C \\cdot Q}$$\n\nUsing this general formula, we can compute the mid-bolus time for each protocol.\n\nFor Protocol $1$:\n$$T_{mid, 1} = \\frac{D_1 \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot C_1 \\cdot Q}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{mid, 1} = \\frac{(0.025 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/kg}) \\cdot (70 \\, \\mathrm{kg})}{2 \\cdot (0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/mL}) \\cdot (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL/s})} = \\frac{1.75}{1.0} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1.75 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFor Protocol $2$:\n$$T_{mid, 2} = \\frac{D_2 \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot C_2 \\cdot Q}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{mid, 2} = \\frac{(0.1 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/kg}) \\cdot (70 \\, \\mathrm{kg})}{2 \\cdot (0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/mL}) \\cdot (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL/s})} = \\frac{7.0}{2.0} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 3.5 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the difference in the mid-bolus times, $\\Delta T_{mid}$, defined as $T_{mid, 2} - T_{mid, 1}$.\n$$\\Delta T_{mid} = T_{mid, 2} - T_{mid, 1} = 3.5 \\, \\mathrm{s} - 1.75 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1.75 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $1.75$ already has three significant figures.\n\n**Interpretation of the Result:**\n\nThe positive value of $\\Delta T_{mid} = 1.75$ s indicates that the temporal center of the contrast bolus for the standard extracellular protocol occurs $1.75$ seconds later than for the gadoxetate protocol. This difference arises because, despite the higher concentration of the standard agent ($C_2 > C_1$), the required dose is four times larger ($D_2 = 4 D_1$), resulting in a total injected volume that is twice as large ($V_2 = 14.0$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ vs. $V_1 = 7.0$ $\\mathrm{mL}$) and thus an injection duration that is twice as long ($T_{inj, 2} = 7.0$ $\\mathrm{s}$ vs. $T_{inj, 1} = 3.5$ $\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nThis difference has a direct and critical impact on the timing of the arterial phase acquisition in dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. The characterization of hypervascular benign liver tumors, such as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), depends on capturing their intense and uniform enhancement during the late arterial phase. This phase is a narrow temporal window, typically lasting only a few seconds.\n\nThe mid-bolus time, $T_{mid}$, serves as a reference for the central tendency of the contrast input function. The peak enhancement in the target artery and subsequently in the tumor occurs at a delay relative to the start of injection, a delay that is influenced by the injection duration. A longer injection spreads the bolus over a greater time, which can lead to a delayed and potentially broader peak.\n\nThe calculated difference of $\\Delta T_{mid} = 1.75$ $\\mathrm{s}$ is significant in this context. If an imaging protocol is optimized for one agent (e.g., by using a fixed delay after injection starts), applying it unchanged to the other agent will result in mistiming. For instance, using a timing protocol optimized for the shorter gadoxetate injection for the standard GBCA injection would mean the arterial phase images are acquired $1.75$ $\\mathrm{s}$ earlier relative to the bolus's center of mass. This increases the risk of scanning before the lesion reaches its peak enhancement, potentially leading to an underestimation of its vascularity and an incorrect or indeterminate diagnosis. Conversely, applying a timing protocol designed for the longer standard GBCA injection to the gadoxetate injection would result in scanning $1.75$ $\\mathrm{s}$ late relative to the bolus center, risking that the acquisition occurs after the arterial peak, as contrast begins to enter the portal venous system. This could obscure the characteristic hyperarterial features of the lesion, reducing diagnostic confidence. Therefore, adjusting the scan delay to account for the injection duration is crucial for accurate characterization of hypervascular liver lesions.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in probability theory and clinical medicine, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability of a hepatocellular adenoma being beta-catenin-activated given a positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) result. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the adenoma is beta-catenin-activated.\nLet $A^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the IHC test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the IHC test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability of the adenoma being beta-catenin-activated is the prior probability, $P(A) = 0.10$.\nThe sensitivity of the IHC test is the probability of a positive test given that the adenoma is beta-catenin-activated: $P(T^+|A) = 0.90$.\nThe specificity of the IHC test is the probability of a negative test given that the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated: $P(T^-|A^c) = 0.95$.\n\nWe need to compute the post-test probability, which is the conditional probability $P(A|T^+)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities of the complementary events. The prior probability of the adenoma not being beta-catenin-activated is:\n$$ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\nThe specificity gives $P(T^-|A^c)$. The probability of a positive test given that the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated (the false positive rate) is:\n$$ P(T^+|A^c) = 1 - P(T^-|A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|A) P(A) + P(T^+|A^c) P(A^c) $$\nSubstituting the given and derived values into this equation:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.10) + (0.05)(0.90) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.090 + 0.045 = 0.135 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for $P(T^+|A)$, $P(A)$, and $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.10)}{0.135} $$\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{0.090}{0.135} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{90}{135} = \\frac{2 \\times 45}{3 \\times 45} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe problem asks for the probability to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ P(A|T^+) \\approx 0.6667 $$\n\nFor the interpretation of this result in a clinical context:\nHepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors, but they are not uniform in their biological behavior. Contemporary management is guided by a molecular classification that stratifies the risk of complications, most importantly malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The beta-catenin-activated HCA subtype (b-HCA) is of particular concern because it carries the highest risk of malignant transformation, estimated at $5$-$10\\%$.\n\nThe pretest probability of $0.10$ (or $10\\%$) represents the baseline suspicion for b-HCA based on clinical and imaging findings, which is consistent with the general prevalence of this subtype. After a positive IHC test for nuclear beta-catenin, the probability has increased dramatically to approximately $0.67$ (or $67\\%$). This is a significant revision of risk. A post-test probability of this magnitude would strongly influence clinical management. For a surgically resectable patient, a low probability might favor a strategy of surveillance with serial imaging, particularly for smaller lesions (e.g., $< 5$ cm). However, a high probability ($67\\%$) of having a lesion with a known malignant potential would typically shift the recommendation decisively towards surgical resection, regardless of tumor size. This is to remove the lesion definitively and thereby eliminate the risk of future malignant transformation. The IHC test, by increasing the certainty of the diagnosis from $10\\%$ to $67\\%$, provides crucial information that justifies a more aggressive management approach (surgery) over a more conservative one (observation). This case exemplifies the core principle of risk stratification in modern surgical oncology, where diagnostic tools are used to tailor treatment to the specific biology of a patient's disease.",

            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and definitions explicitly provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n- Total Liver Volume ($TLV$): $1500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Tumor volume: $200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Planned Future Liver Remnant ($FLR$) volume: $450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Principle: Postoperative liver function capacity is proportional to the volume of viable, perfused parenchyma.\n- Definition: Non-parenchymal or nonfunctional lesion volume (e.g., tumor) is excluded from the functional denominator.\n- Task 1: Compute the FLR proportion as the ratio of the planned remnant volume to the functional total liver volume.\n- Task 2: Decide if the planned operation is feasible for a patient with normal liver parenchyma, based on well-tested clinical facts.\n- Constraint: The FLR proportion must be reported as a unitless decimal or fraction.\n- Constraint: No rounding is required.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the established principles of hepatobiliary surgery and preoperative planning for hepatectomy. The concepts of Total Liver Volume ($TLV$), Future Liver Remnant ($FLR$), and the calculation of a functional liver volume by excluding tumor mass are standard and critical practices to prevent post-hepatectomy liver failure. The provided volumes are clinically realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to perform the required calculation. The definition of \"FLR proportion\" is explicitly stated, leading to a unique numerical solution. The second part of the task, making a clinical judgment, relies on \"well-tested clinical facts.\" In the context of surgery for a patient with normal liver parenchyma, the minimum required FLR is a standard, widely accepted value (typically $>20\\%-25\\%$), making the problem decidable.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and clinical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will now be formulated.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: first, the calculation of the Future Liver Remnant (FLR) proportion, and second, a decision on the feasibility of the surgery based on this proportion.\n\nLet $V_{TLV}$ be the Total Liver Volume, $V_{Tumor}$ be the tumor volume, and $V_{FLR}$ be the planned Future Liver Remnant volume.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$V_{TLV} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$V_{Tumor} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$V_{FLR} = 450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem defines the denominator for the FLR proportion as the \"functional total liver volume,\" which excludes the tumor volume. Let us denote this as $V_{FuncTLV}$.\nThis is calculated by subtracting the tumor volume from the total liver volume:\n$$V_{FuncTLV} = V_{TLV} - V_{Tumor}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{FuncTLV} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mL} - 200\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1300\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNext, the FLR proportion, which we will denote as $P_{FLR}$, is defined as the ratio of the planned remnant volume to this functional total liver volume.\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{V_{FLR}}{V_{FuncTLV}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $V_{FLR}$ and the calculated $V_{FuncTLV}$:\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{1300\\,\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nAs this is a ratio of volumes, the result is a unitless quantity. We can simplify the fraction:\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{450}{1300} = \\frac{45}{130} = \\frac{9 \\times 5}{26 \\times 5} = \\frac{9}{26}$$\nAs a decimal, this value is approximately $0.34615$. Since the problem does not require rounding, the exact fractional form $\\frac{9}{26}$ is a complete answer for the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part of the task is to decide whether the planned operation is feasible. This decision relies on \"well-tested clinical facts.\" For a patient with otherwise normal liver parenchyma (i.e., no underlying cirrhosis, steatosis, or cholestasis), a major hepatectomy is generally considered safe if the planned Future Liver Remnant proportion is greater than $20\\%$. Some centers use a more conservative threshold of $25\\%$. We will use the commonly accepted minimum threshold of $20\\%$.\nThe minimum required FLR proportion, $P_{min}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{min} = 20\\% = 0.20 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nWe must compare the calculated $P_{FLR}$ to this threshold:\nIs $P_{FLR} > P_{min}$?\nIs $\\frac{9}{26} > \\frac{1}{5}$?\nTo compare the fractions, we can find a common denominator or use cross-multiplication. Using cross-multiplication:\n$$9 \\times 5 \\quad ? \\quad 26 \\times 1$$\n$$45 > 26$$\nThe inequality holds true. The calculated FLR proportion of $\\frac{9}{26}$ (approximately $34.6\\%$) is significantly greater than the minimum safety threshold of $20\\%$.\nTherefore, based on the volumetric analysis and standard clinical guidelines, the planned anatomic hepatectomy is considered feasible for this patient with normal liver parenchyma.
