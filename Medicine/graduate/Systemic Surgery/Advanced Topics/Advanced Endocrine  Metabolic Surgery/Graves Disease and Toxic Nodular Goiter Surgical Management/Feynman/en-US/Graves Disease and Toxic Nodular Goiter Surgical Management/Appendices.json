            "problem": "A patient with overt hyperthyroidism due to a solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodule is being evaluated for operative versus non-operative management. Before radionuclide scintigraphy, the malignancy prevalence among such hyperthyroid nodules in this practice is assessed as a pretest probability of $0.02$. A planar radionuclide scintigraphy shows the nodule is “hot” (increased tracer uptake relative to background thyroid). From prior studies, the probability that a thyroid cancer presents as a “hot” nodule on scintigraphy is $0.03$, and the probability that a benign hyperfunctioning nodule appears “hot” is $0.95$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of conditional probability, compute the updated probability of malignancy given a “hot” scintigraphy result. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the updated probability of malignancy given a \"hot\" scintigraphy result, which is the posterior probability $P(M|H)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(M|H) = \\frac{P(H|M)P(M)}{P(H)}$$\nHere, $P(M)$ is the prior probability of malignancy, $P(H|M)$ is the conditional probability of a hot nodule given malignancy, and $P(H)$ is the total probability of observing a hot nodule.\n\nThe givens are:\n-   The prior probability of malignancy: $P(M) = 0.02$.\n-   The conditional probability of a hot scan given malignancy: $P(H|M) = 0.03$.\n-   The conditional probability of a hot scan given a benign nodule: $P(H|B) = 0.95$.\n\nA thyroid nodule is either malignant ($M$) or benign ($B$). These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Therefore, the probability of a nodule being benign is the complement of it being malignant:\n$$P(B) = 1 - P(M)$$\nSubstituting the given value for $P(M)$:\n$$P(B) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$$\n\nThe denominator in Bayes' theorem, $P(H)$, is the total probability of a nodule being hot. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, marginalizing over the status of the nodule (malignant or benign):\n$$P(H) = P(H|M)P(M) + P(H|B)P(B)$$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$P(H) = (0.03)(0.02) + (0.95)(0.98)$$\nWe calculate the two terms separately:\n$$(0.03)(0.02) = 0.0006$$\n$$(0.95)(0.98) = 0.931$$\nNow, we sum these terms to find $P(H)$:\n$$P(H) = 0.0006 + 0.931 = 0.9316$$\n\nNow we have all the components to apply Bayes' theorem to find $P(M|H)$:\n$$P(M|H) = \\frac{P(H|M)P(M)}{P(H)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P(M|H) = \\frac{(0.03)(0.02)}{0.9316} = \\frac{0.0006}{0.9316}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(M|H) \\approx 0.000644053241...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

To make an informed decision and counsel patients effectively, we must quantify the comparative effectiveness of treatments like total thyroidectomy versus radioiodine.

            "problem": "A multidisciplinary thyroid team is comparing definitive therapies for smokers with Graves’ disease, focusing on preventing progression of Graves’ ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease) within $6$ months after treatment. Two commonly used modalities are total thyroidectomy and Radioiodine (RAI). For smokers in their catchment area, the baseline distribution of ophthalmopathy severity at the time of therapy is as follows: mild activity in a proportion $0.70$ and moderate-to-severe activity in a proportion $0.30$. A recent synthesis of high-quality cohort data reports the following stratum-specific $6$-month probabilities of ophthalmopathy progression conditional on initial therapy:\n\n- If treated with RAI: risk $0.18$ for mild activity and risk $0.35$ for moderate-to-severe activity.\n- If treated with total thyroidectomy: risk $0.04$ for mild activity and risk $0.08$ for moderate-to-severe activity.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of probability and expected value over a stratified population, compute the population-level absolute risk reduction achieved by choosing total thyroidectomy instead of RAI for these smokers, and from that derive the number needed to treat (defined as the number of patients in this smoker population who would need to receive total thyroidectomy in place of RAI to prevent one additional case of ophthalmopathy progression within $6$ months).

This is the marginal probability of progression, conditioned on treatment. We use the law of total probability, summing over the strata of baseline severity ($M$ and $S$). The baseline distribution of severity is independent of the treatment chosen, so we can state that $P(M|T) = P(M)$ and $P(S|T) = P(S)$ for any treatment $T$.\n\nThe overall risk of progression with RAI, denoted as $R_{RAI}$, is:\n$$ R_{RAI} = P(E|T_{RAI}) = P(E | M \\cap T_{RAI})P(M) + P(E | S \\cap T_{RAI})P(S) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ R_{RAI} = (0.18)(0.70) + (0.35)(0.30) $$\n$$ R_{RAI} = 0.126 + 0.105 = 0.231 $$\n\nThe overall risk of progression with total thyroidectomy, denoted as $R_{TT}$, is:\n$$ R_{TT} = P(E|T_{TT}) = P(E | M \\cap T_{TT})P(M) + P(E | S \\cap T_{TT})P(S) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ R_{TT} = (0.04)(0.70) + (0.08)(0.30) $$\n$$ R_{TT} = 0.028 + 0.024 = 0.052 $$\n\nNext, we compute the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference between the risk in the control group (RAI) and the risk in the treatment group (total thyroidectomy).\n$$ ARR = R_{RAI} - R_{TT} $$\n$$ ARR = 0.231 - 0.052 = 0.179 $$\nThis value, $0.179$, represents the proportion of the population for whom progression is prevented by choosing total thyroidectomy over RAI.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT). The NNT is defined as the number of patients who need to be treated with the experimental therapy (total thyroidectomy) instead of the control therapy (RAI) to prevent one additional adverse outcome (ophthalmopathy progression). It is the reciprocal of the ARR.\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{0.179} \\approx 5.586592... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.
