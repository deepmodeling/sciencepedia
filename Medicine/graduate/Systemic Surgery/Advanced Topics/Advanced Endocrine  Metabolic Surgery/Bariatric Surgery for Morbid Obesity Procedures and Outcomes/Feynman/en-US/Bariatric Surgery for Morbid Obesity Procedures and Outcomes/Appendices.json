The percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and excess weight loss (%EWL) are the foundational metrics used globally to standardize the evaluation of surgical efficacy.

            "problem": "A patient underwent a bariatric procedure for morbid obesity. In outcomes reporting for bariatric surgery, two standard normalization metrics are derived from first principles of proportional change: percentage total weight loss (TWL) and percentage excess weight loss (EWL). Percentage total weight loss is defined conceptually as the proportion of the baseline body mass that has been lost, and percentage excess weight loss is defined conceptually as the proportion of baseline excess weight (baseline weight above an ideal reference weight) that has been lost. Let the baseline weight be $W_{0}$, the ideal weight be $W_{\\mathrm{i}}$ (used to define excess weight), and the current weight at one year be $W_{1}$. Use these conceptual definitions to derive the expressions for the decimal TWL and decimal EWL from $W_{0}$, $W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, and $W_{1}$.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible data: $W_{0} = 160~\\mathrm{kg}$, $W_{\\mathrm{i}} = 70~\\mathrm{kg}$, and $W_{1} = 105~\\mathrm{kg}$. In line with widely cited one-year benchmarks across established bariatric procedures (for example, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux–en–Y gastric bypass), consider outcomes as meeting expected benchmarks at one year if and only if both the decimal TWL is at least $0.20$ and the decimal EWL is at least $0.50$.\n\nCompute the decimal TWL and decimal EWL at one year, and determine whether both benchmarks are met. Report your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\mathrm{TWL} & \\mathrm{EWL} & I\\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\mathrm{TWL}$ and $\\mathrm{EWL}$ are the decimal values rounded to four significant figures, and $I$ is an indicator equal to $1$ if both benchmarks are met and $0$ otherwise. Express $\\mathrm{TWL}$ and $\\mathrm{EWL}$ as decimals (not with a percent sign). No physical units are required in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to attempting a solution.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n-   **Variables**: Baseline weight $W_{0}$, ideal weight $W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, and current weight at one year $W_{1}$.\n-   **Conceptual Definitions**:\n    -   Percentage total weight loss (TWL): \"the proportion of the baseline body mass that has been lost\".\n    -   Percentage excess weight loss (EWL): \"the proportion of baseline excess weight ... that has been lost\".\n    -   Excess weight: \"baseline weight above an ideal reference weight\".\n-   **Data**: $W_{0} = 160~\\mathrm{kg}$, $W_{\\mathrm{i}} = 70~\\mathrm{kg}$, and $W_{1} = 105~\\mathrm{kg}$.\n-   **Benchmark Conditions**: Outcomes meet benchmarks if and only if both the decimal TWL is at least $0.20$ and the decimal EWL is at least $0.50$.\n-   **Required Output**: A row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\mathrm{TWL} & \\mathrm{EWL} & I\\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\mathrm{TWL}$ and $\\mathrm{EWL}$ are decimal values rounded to four significant figures, and $I$ is an indicator variable ($1$ if both benchmarks are met, $0$ otherwise).\n\nThe problem is subjected to validation:\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The metrics of percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) are standard, universally accepted measures for reporting outcomes in bariatric surgery. The conceptual definitions are accurate. The provided patient data ($W_0$, $W_i$, $W_1$) are physiologically plausible for a morbidly obese individual undergoing this type of surgery. The benchmarks for success ($\\mathrm{TWL} \\ge 0.20$, $\\mathrm{EWL} \\ge 0.50$) are consistent with established clinical guidelines and large-scale study findings for procedures like sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The conceptual definitions can be unambiguously translated into mathematical formulae. The given data are sufficient and consistent, leading to a unique solution for the requested quantities.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated objectively, using precise terminology from the relevant medical field. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to formalize the conceptual definitions of total weight loss (TWL) and excess weight loss (EWL) into mathematical expressions.\n\nThe total amount of weight lost by the patient at one year is the difference between the baseline weight, $W_{0}$, and the current weight at one year, $W_{1}$.\n$$\n\\text{Weight Lost} = W_{0} - W_{1}\n$$\nThe decimal total weight loss, $\\mathrm{TWL}$, is defined as the proportion of the baseline body mass that has been lost. This is the ratio of the weight lost to the baseline weight.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TWL} = \\frac{W_{0} - W_{1}}{W_{0}}\n$$\nNext, we formalize the expression for excess weight loss. The baseline excess weight is the patient's weight above an ideal reference weight, $W_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Baseline Excess Weight} = W_{0} - W_{\\mathrm{i}}\n$$\nThe decimal excess weight loss, $\\mathrm{EWL}$, is defined as the proportion of this baseline excess weight that has been lost. The amount of weight lost is still $W_{0} - W_{1}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{EWL}$ is the ratio of the weight lost to the baseline excess weight.\n$$\n\\mathrm{EWL} = \\frac{W_{0} - W_{1}}{W_{0} - W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical data into these expressions.\nGiven: $W_{0} = 160~\\mathrm{kg}$, $W_{\\mathrm{i}} = 70~\\mathrm{kg}$, and $W_{1} = 105~\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the decimal TWL:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TWL} = \\frac{160 - 105}{160} = \\frac{55}{160} = \\frac{11}{32} = 0.34375\n$$\nNext, we calculate the decimal EWL:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EWL} = \\frac{160 - 105}{160 - 70} = \\frac{55}{90} = \\frac{11}{18} \\approx 0.61111...\n$$\nThe problem requires these values to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TWL} \\approx 0.3438\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{EWL} \\approx 0.6111\n$$\nThe next step is to determine if the one-year clinical benchmarks are met. The conditions are:\n1.  $\\mathrm{TWL} \\ge 0.20$\n2.  $\\mathrm{EWL} \\ge 0.50$\n\nWe check these conditions using the unrounded values for precision.\nFor TWL:\n$$\n0.34375 \\ge 0.20\n$$\nThis inequality is true.\n\nFor EWL:\n$$\n0.61111... \\ge 0.50\n$$\nThis inequality is also true.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the surgical outcome meets the specified benchmarks. The indicator variable, $I$, is therefore equal to $1$. If either or both of the conditions were not met, $I$ would be $0$.\n\nFinally, we construct the required row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\mathrm{TWL} & \\mathrm{EWL} & I\\end{pmatrix}$ using the rounded values for $\\mathrm{TWL}$ and $\\mathrm{EWL}$, and the calculated value for $I$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3438 & 0.6111 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation and computation as required by the problem statement.",

            "introduction": "Choosing the correct bariatric procedure requires a sophisticated integration of a patient's unique physiological and pathological profile. The era of \"one-size-fits-all\" surgery is over; modern practice demands tailoring the operation to address not only obesity but also complex comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This practice problem  challenges you to act as the primary surgeon and construct a decision-making algorithm for a patient with multiple competing concerns, forcing a choice based on a deep understanding of surgical mechanics and endocrine effects.",
            "id": "5086574",
            "problem": "A patient aged $45$ years presents to a multidisciplinary bariatric clinic with Body Mass Index (BMI) $= \\dfrac{m}{h^2}$ calculated at $52\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, Type $2$ Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) refractory to maximal medical therapy (Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) $= 9.2\\%$ despite basal-bolus insulin and a glucagon-like peptide-$1$ (GLP-$1$) receptor agonist), and severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Los Angeles grade $C$ esophagitis and a $3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ sliding hiatal hernia. Twenty-four hour pH-impedance testing demonstrates acid exposure time $= 12\\%$, with normal esophageal manometry. There is no history of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, prior foregut surgery, or nicotine dependence. The task is to choose the most appropriate decision algorithm to prioritize the type of bariatric operation, grounding the choice in fundamental surgical and physiological principles. Use the following base facts and definitions as starting points: BMI is defined by $ \\mathrm{BMI} = \\dfrac{m}{h^2}$; GERD is driven by a failure of the antireflux barrier (lower esophageal sphincter tone, crural diaphragm support) and increased gastroesophageal pressure gradients; gastric compliance $C$ satisfies $C = \\dfrac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$; foregut exclusion alters nutrient flow and enteroendocrine signaling (including incretin responses such as GLP-$1$); and durable metabolic surgery outcomes are determined by restriction, malabsorption, and hormonal effects. Select the option that best constructs a decision algorithm which prioritizes the appropriate surgery for this patient and correctly explains the logic by which a bypass procedure is preferred over a sleeve-based procedure.\n\nA. A stepwise algorithm that first stratifies reflux severity and mechanism (endoscopy, pH-impedance, manometry), screens for contraindications to foregut exclusion, and, for patients with $\\mathrm{BMI} \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, prioritizes Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) with concomitant hiatal hernia repair, using extended limb lengths (biliopancreatic limb $150$–$200\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, alimentary limb $100$–$150\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) to augment total weight loss and T2DM remission, while avoiding sleeve-based procedures in the presence of severe GERD. The rationale is that RYGB creates a low-pressure, small gastric pouch that reduces acid and bile exposure to the esophagus, restores the pressure gradient by lowering intragastric pressure (increasing effective compliance), and achieves superior glycemic effects via foregut exclusion and hindgut stimulation (enhanced GLP-$1$), at the cost of manageable nutritional risks.\n\nB. An algorithm that favors Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) with concurrent hiatal hernia repair for all patients with $\\mathrm{BMI} \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, reserving RYGB only if GERD persists postoperatively. The rationale is that SG offers lower perioperative risk, adequate restriction, and reflux is expected to improve with weight loss; any residual GERD can be treated with proton pump inhibitors and lifestyle measures.\n\nC. An algorithm that recommends Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (LAGB) due to its reversibility and minimal invasiveness, deferring reflux management to band adjustments and proton pump inhibitors, with future conversion planned only if glycemic control remains poor.\n\nD. An algorithm that prioritizes Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) for maximal metabolic impact at $\\mathrm{BMI} \\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, reasoning that superior malabsorption drives glycemic improvement, while reflux can be addressed medically after surgery; hiatal hernia repair is optional.\n\nE. An algorithm that selects One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) with a $200\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ biliary limb to maximize malabsorption for T2DM, with the expectation that bile reflux will be limited by pouch configuration; any GERD symptoms can be managed with bile acid sequestrants postoperatively.\n\nChoose the single best option.",
            "solution": "First, we analyze the patient's clinical profile, which has three critical components that must be addressed by the chosen surgical procedure:\n1.  **Super Obesity:** A BMI of $52\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ requires a procedure known for high efficacy and durable weight loss.\n2.  **Refractory Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM):** An HbA1c of $9.2\\%$ on maximal medical therapy indicates severe metabolic disease. The ideal procedure will have potent effects on glycemic control, typically through mechanisms that enhance GLP-1 secretion, such as foregut exclusion.\n3.  **Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Objectively confirmed by LA grade C esophagitis and high acid exposure time. This is a determining factor, as some bariatric procedures can significantly worsen GERD.\n\nNext, we evaluate the proposed surgical options based on these needs and established physiological principles:\n*   **Option B (Sleeve Gastrectomy - SG):** SG converts the stomach into a high-pressure tube, which is known to worsen or induce GERD. It is therefore strongly contraindicated in a patient with pre-existing severe reflux. This option is incorrect and potentially harmful.\n*   **Option C (Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding - LAGB):** LAGB offers inferior weight loss and minimal metabolic effects compared to other procedures. It is an inadequate solution for this patient's severe obesity and T2DM. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D (Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch - BPD-DS):** While this operation offers the most potent metabolic effects, it includes a sleeve gastrectomy component. The resulting high-pressure gastric tube makes it a poor choice for a patient with severe GERD. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option E (One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass - OAGB):** While a powerful metabolic procedure, the loop gastrojejunostomy creates a risk of chronic bile reflux into the esophagus. This is highly undesirable in a patient who already has severe esophagitis. This makes it a riskier choice than RYGB. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option A (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass - RYGB):** This procedure is considered the gold standard for patients with both morbid obesity and severe GERD. It effectively addresses all three of the patient's problems:\n    *   **GERD Treatment:** It creates a small, low-pressure gastric pouch and diverts bile and pancreatic enzymes far downstream, eliminating the primary drivers of reflux. Concomitant hiatal hernia repair is standard and further restores the anti-reflux barrier.\n    *   **T2DM Remission:** The exclusion of the proximal intestine leads to a profound incretin (GLP-1) surge, providing superior glycemic control.\n    *   **Weight Loss:** It provides excellent and durable weight loss. The suggestion to use extended limb lengths for a patient with a BMI $\\ge 50\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ is a valid and evidence-based strategy to augment outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A presents the most clinically sound and evidence-based decision algorithm. It correctly identifies severe GERD as a key deciding factor, appropriately selects RYGB as the procedure of choice, and accurately describes the physiological rationale for its effectiveness.",

            "introduction": "Effective long-term management is as crucial as the index operation itself, and nutritional deficiencies are among the most common challenges following malabsorptive procedures like the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This exercise  provides a hands-on opportunity to apply physiological principles to a frequent clinical problem: iron deficiency anemia. You will learn to perform a quantitative assessment of a patient's total iron deficit and calculate a precise oral supplementation regimen that accounts for both the altered gastrointestinal anatomy and ongoing physiological needs.",

            "problem": "A $34$-year-old person, six months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), presents with fatigue and pica. Laboratory studies show microcytic anemia with hemoglobin $H_b^{\\text{actual}} = 10.0 \\ \\text{g/dL}$, mean corpuscular volume $72 \\ \\text{fL}$, ferritin $7 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$, transferrin saturation $0.09$, and C-reactive protein within normal limits. The preoperative weight was $125 \\ \\text{kg}$; current weight is $85 \\ \\text{kg}$. There is no overt gastrointestinal bleeding. The goal is to correct the anemia and replete iron stores to a ferritin that reflects adequate depot iron while considering RYGB-induced malabsorption.\n\nUse the following well-tested physiological facts and approximations:\n- Whole blood volume is approximately $70 \\ \\text{mL/kg}$.\n- Each $\\text{g}$ of hemoglobin contains approximately $3.4 \\ \\text{mg}$ of iron.\n- To restore iron stores to a clinically adequate depot, add $500 \\ \\text{mg}$ of iron beyond what is needed to correct the circulating hemoglobin deficit (this target corresponds to a ferritin near $50 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ in iron-replete states).\n- Basal daily iron losses in menstruating individuals are approximately $1.4 \\ \\text{mg/day}$ (including $1.0 \\ \\text{mg/day}$ obligatory losses and $0.4 \\ \\text{mg/day}$ average menstrual loss).\n- After RYGB, fractional absorption of non-heme elemental iron from oral ferrous salts is reduced; assume a mean fractional absorption $f = 0.08$.\n- Target hemoglobin for recovery is $H_b^{\\text{target}} = 13.0 \\ \\text{g/dL}$.\n\nDesign the supplementation route (oral versus intravenous) based on physiological reasoning. Then, assuming the entire deficit must be delivered via oral elemental iron over $8$ weeks, and accounting for ongoing daily iron losses during repletion, calculate the required daily elemental iron intake to achieve the hemoglobin target and restore depot stores under the stated absorption constraint. Round your answer to three significant figures and express the final dose in $\\text{mg/day}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The provided physiological parameters and clinical scenario are consistent with established medical principles concerning post-bariatric surgery care.\n\nThe problem requires two parts: first, a reasoned decision on the optimal route of iron supplementation, and second, a calculation of the required daily oral elemental iron dose to correct the diagnosed iron deficiency anemia over a specified period.\n\n**Part 1: Design of Supplementation Route (Oral vs. Intravenous)**\n\nThe choice between oral and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation depends on the severity of the anemia, the magnitude of the iron deficit, the underlying cause of the deficiency (particularly the degree of malabsorption), patient tolerance, and the desired speed of correction.\n\nIn this case, the patient has undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a procedure known to cause significant malabsorption of iron. The duodenum and proximal jejunum, the primary sites of iron absorption, are bypassed. The problem states the fractional absorption, $f$, of oral elemental iron is reduced to $f=0.08$. This is a severe impairment, as normal fractional absorption in iron-deficient individuals can be $0.20$ or higher.\n\nThe patient presents with symptomatic anemia ($H_b^{\\text{actual}} = 10.0 \\ \\text{g/dL}$) and severely depleted iron stores (ferritin $7 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$). To correct this using oral therapy would require a very high daily intake of elemental iron to overcome the poor absorption. Such high doses are often associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., constipation, nausea, abdominal pain), which can lead to poor adherence.\n\nLet's estimate the total iron deficit to be absorbed, which will be calculated precisely in Part 2. As a rough estimate, a deficit of over $1000 \\ \\text{mg}$ is typical in such cases. To absorb $1000 \\ \\text{mg}$ with a fractional absorption of $f = 0.08$ requires a total ingestion of $\\frac{1000}{0.08} = 12500 \\ \\text{mg}$ of elemental iron. Administering this over $8$ weeks ($56$ days) would necessitate a daily intake of approximately $\\frac{12500}{56} \\approx 223 \\ \\text{mg/day}$, which is a large dose with a high likelihood of side effects and non-compliance.\n\nIntravenous iron administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract entirely, delivering iron directly into the circulation for utilization by the bone marrow and for storage. This ensures $100\\%$ bioavailability, guarantees repletion, achieves a more rapid correction of hemoglobin and stores, and avoids the gastrointestinal side effects of high-dose oral iron. Given the significant malabsorption post-RYGB and the magnitude of the deficit, intravenous iron is the physiologically superior and clinically preferred route for repletion in this patient.\n\nDespite this clinical reasoning, the problem mandates the calculation be performed under the assumption of oral repletion. We proceed with this calculation as instructed.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Required Daily Oral Iron Intake**\n\nThe total amount of iron that must be absorbed, $Fe_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of three components:\n1.  The iron required to correct the hemoglobin deficit, $Fe_{\\text{Hb}}$.\n2.  The iron required to replete body stores, $Fe_{\\text{stores}}$.\n3.  The iron required to balance ongoing daily losses during the repletion period, $Fe_{\\text{losses}}$.\n\n$$Fe_{\\text{total}} = Fe_{\\text{Hb}} + Fe_{\\text{stores}} + Fe_{\\text{losses}}$$\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Hemoglobin-Related Iron Deficit ($Fe_{\\text{Hb}}$)**\n\nFirst, calculate the patient's total blood volume, $V_{\\text{blood}}$, based on their current weight, $W_{\\text{current}} = 85 \\ \\text{kg}$.\n$$V_{\\text{blood}} = W_{\\text{current}} \\times 70 \\ \\text{mL/kg} = 85 \\ \\text{kg} \\times 70 \\ \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 5950 \\ \\text{mL}$$\nSince hemoglobin is measured in g/dL, we convert the volume to deciliters ($1 \\ \\text{dL} = 100 \\ \\text{mL}$):\n$$V_{\\text{blood}} = 5950 \\ \\text{mL} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\text{dL}}{100 \\ \\text{mL}} = 59.5 \\ \\text{dL}$$\n\nNext, calculate the hemoglobin deficit, $\\Delta H_b$, per deciliter of blood.\n$$\\Delta H_b = H_b^{\\text{target}} - H_b^{\\text{actual}} = 13.0 \\ \\text{g/dL} - 10.0 \\ \\text{g/dL} = 3.0 \\ \\text{g/dL}$$\n\nThe total mass of hemoglobin needed, $H_{b, \\text{deficit}}$, is the deficit per unit volume multiplied by the total blood volume.\n$$H_{b, \\text{deficit}} = \\Delta H_b \\times V_{\\text{blood}} = 3.0 \\ \\text{g/dL} \\times 59.5 \\ \\text{dL} = 178.5 \\ \\text{g}$$\n\nThe iron deficit associated with hemoglobin, $Fe_{\\text{Hb}}$, is calculated using the given iron content of hemoglobin ($3.4 \\ \\text{mg Fe / g Hb}$).\n$$Fe_{\\text{Hb}} = H_{b, \\text{deficit}} \\times 3.4 \\ \\text{mg/g} = 178.5 \\ \\text{g} \\times 3.4 \\ \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{g}} = 606.9 \\ \\text{mg}$$\n\n**Step B: Identify the Stores-Related Iron Deficit ($Fe_{\\text{stores}}$)**\n\nThis value is given directly in the problem statement.\n$$Fe_{\\text{stores}} = 500 \\ \\text{mg}$$\n\n**Step C: Calculate Iron for Ongoing Losses ($Fe_{\\text{losses}}$)**\n\nThe repletion period is $T = 8$ weeks. We convert this to days.\n$$T = 8 \\ \\text{weeks} \\times 7 \\ \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} = 56 \\ \\text{days}$$\nThe daily iron loss is given as $L_{\\text{daily}} = 1.4 \\ \\text{mg/day}$. The total loss over the repletion period is:\n$$Fe_{\\text{losses}} = L_{\\text{daily}} \\times T = 1.4 \\ \\text{mg/day} \\times 56 \\ \\text{days} = 78.4 \\ \\text{mg}$$\n\n**Step D: Calculate the Total Required Absorbed Iron ($Fe_{\\text{total}}$)**\n\nSumming the three components:\n$$Fe_{\\text{total}} = Fe_{\\text{Hb}} + Fe_{\\text{stores}} + Fe_{\\text{losses}} = 606.9 \\ \\text{mg} + 500 \\ \\text{mg} + 78.4 \\ \\text{mg} = 1185.3 \\ \\text{mg}$$\n\n**Step E: Calculate the Required Daily Oral Intake ($D_{\\text{daily}}$)**\n\nThe total amount of iron that must be *absorbed* is $Fe_{\\text{total}} = 1185.3 \\ \\text{mg}$. The amount of iron that must be *ingested*, $Fe_{\\text{ingested}}$, depends on the fractional absorption, $f = 0.08$.\n$$Fe_{\\text{ingested}} = \\frac{Fe_{\\text{total}}}{f} = \\frac{1185.3 \\ \\text{mg}}{0.08} = 14816.25 \\ \\text{mg}$$\nThis total ingested dose must be delivered over the $T = 56$-day period. The required daily intake, $D_{\\text{daily}}$, is therefore:\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = \\frac{Fe_{\\text{ingested}}}{T} = \\frac{14816.25 \\ \\text{mg}}{56 \\ \\text{days}} \\approx 264.57589 \\ \\text{mg/day}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} \\approx 265 \\ \\text{mg/day}$$",
