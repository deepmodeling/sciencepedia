            "problem": "A $48$-year-old patient presents with a biopsy-proven conventional chondrosarcoma centered in the sacrum. Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrate a dominant lesion occupying $S2$–$S4$ with posterior cortical breach and a posterior soft-tissue mass. The prior percutaneous biopsy was performed at an outside facility using a posterior approach; the biopsy tract is identifiable on imaging as a linear path extending from skin to the posterior sacrum approximately $3 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ off the midline on the right. There is a separate, noncontiguous intramedullary focus of tumor signal consistent with a skip lesion in the posterior body of $S1$. The $L5$–$S1$ disc appears uninvolved and intact on MRI. The right sacroiliac (SI) joint articular cartilage is abutted by tumor but shows no joint space violation, subchondral cortical breach, or marrow replacement in the ilium; the left SI joint and both iliac wings are free of tumor. There is no evidence of visceral pelvic invasion. Staging shows no distant metastases.\n\nUsing core oncologic principles as the fundamental base—namely Enneking’s classification of surgical margins for musculoskeletal sarcoma, the barrier concept (in which intact anatomic barriers such as cortical bone, joint cartilage, and dense fascia can substitute for a circumferential centimeter margin, but once violated or contaminated no longer confer protection), mandatory en bloc resection of biopsy tracts due to contamination, and management of skip lesions by extending resection to the next intact anatomic barrier—select the most appropriate margin strategy for definitive resection.\n\nWhich of the following operative plans best achieves an oncologically sound en bloc resection in this scenario?\n\nA. Posterior-only intralesional debulking of the soft-tissue mass with high-speed burring of exposed bone, adjuvant cautery and phenolization, preservation of all sacral nerve roots, and retention of the prior biopsy tract to minimize soft-tissue loss.\n\nB. En bloc partial sacrectomy below $S2$ to preserve $S2$ roots for continence, accepting a close posterior margin given the cortical breach, leaving the $S1$ skip lesion to be treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, and avoiding resection of the biopsy tract to prevent wound morbidity.\n\nC. En bloc sacrectomy extending proximally to and through the $L5$–$S1$ disc to encompass the $S1$ skip lesion, with bilateral transarticular disarticulation through both SI joints using the articular cartilage as a natural barrier where intact, inclusion of a wide posterior soft-tissue cuff beyond the breached posterior cortex, and en bloc resection of the entire prior biopsy tract and overlying skin ellipse with the specimen; intraoperative frozen sections limited to remote soft-tissue edges and not across the contaminated posterior plane.\n\nD. En bloc internal hemipelvectomy including the right iliac wing because the tumor abuts the right SI joint, plus sacrectomy to $S1$, while preserving the prior biopsy tract separately to avoid enlarging the soft-tissue defect.\n\nE. En bloc total sacrectomy with a transosseous osteotomy through the $S1$ body, maintaining a $5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ bony margin because cortical bone constitutes a thick barrier even when the posterior cortex is breached, and leaving the biopsy tract in situ since it is extra-compartmental to the bone.",

The task is to first validate the problem statement and then, if it is valid, to derive the correct surgical strategy and evaluate the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient:** A $48$-year-old.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Biopsy-proven conventional chondrosarcoma.\n*   **Tumor Location & Extent:**\n    *   Dominant lesion centered in the sacrum, occupying vertebral levels $S2$–$S4$.\n    *   Posterior cortical breach with a posterior soft-tissue mass.\n    *   A separate, noncontiguous intramedullary skip lesion in the posterior body of $S1$.\n*   **Adjacent Structures:**\n    *   The $L5$–$S1$ disc is uninvolved and intact.\n    *   The right sacroiliac (SI) joint articular cartilage is abutted by tumor, but the joint space is not violated, the subchondral cortex is intact, and there is no iliac marrow replacement.\n    *   The left SI joint and both iliac wings are free of tumor.\n    *   No evidence of visceral pelvic invasion.\n*   **Biopsy History:**\n    *   Prior percutaneous biopsy via a posterior approach.\n    *   The biopsy tract is identifiable on the right, approximately $3 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ off the midline.\n*   **Staging:** No distant metastases.\n*   **Guiding Oncologic Principles:**\n    1.  Adherence to Enneking’s classification of surgical margins (implying a goal of wide resection for sarcoma).\n    2.  The \"barrier concept\": Intact anatomic barriers (e.g., cortical bone, joint cartilage, dense fascia) can provide a sufficient margin. Once violated, they no longer confer protection and a wider soft-tissue margin is required.\n    3.  Mandatory en bloc resection of contaminated biopsy tracts.\n    4.  Management of skip lesions by extending the resection to encompass the lesion and proceed to the next intact anatomic barrier.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of musculoskeletal surgical oncology. The scenario describes a sacral chondrosarcoma with common features (posterior breach, skip metastasis) and references standard-of-care concepts like Enneking margins, the barrier concept, and biopsy tract resection. These are not speculative; they are core tenets of the field.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, detailed anatomical and pathological information to allow for the logical application of the given principles. A unique, optimal surgical plan can be reasoned out from the provided data and rules.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description of the pathology and anatomy is based on objective findings from MRI and CT imaging. The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws:\n1.  It is scientifically sound.\n2.  It is directly relevant to the stated topic and formalizable.\n3.  The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n4.  The scenario is clinically realistic.\n5.  It is well-structured and leads to a unique solution.\n6.  It is a complex problem requiring multi-step reasoning, not a trivial or tautological question.\n7.  The reasoning is verifiable based on established medical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Surgical Plan\n\nThe optimal surgical plan must address each of the oncologic challenges presented in the case, adhering strictly to the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Proximal Margin (to address the Skip Lesion):** The problem states there is a skip lesion in the posterior body of $S1$. The governing principle is to extend the resection to the next intact anatomic barrier. The main tumor is in $S2$–$S4$. To remove the $S1$ lesion, the resection must be proximal to $S1$. Cutting through the body of $S1$ would be a transection of an involved bone, resulting in a positive margin. The next intact barrier superior to the $S1$ vertebral body is the $L5$–$S1$ intervertebral disc, which is explicitly stated to be uninvolved and intact. Therefore, the correct proximal margin is a disarticulation through the $L5$–$S1$ disc space, necessitating a total sacrectomy.\n\n2.  **Posterior Margin (to address Cortical Breach):** The tumor has breached the posterior cortex of the sacrum and formed a soft-tissue mass. According to the barrier concept, the posterior cortex can no longer be relied upon as a margin. To achieve a wide margin, the resection must include a substantial cuff of uninvolved soft tissue posterior to the tumor's extraosseous component. This includes the overlying muscle and fascia.\n\n3.  **Management of the Biopsy Tract:** The problem states there is an identifiable biopsy tract on the right posterior side. The governing principle is the mandatory en bloc resection of such tracts due to tumor cell contamination. The surgical plan must therefore include the excision of the entire tract, from the skin down to the tumor, as a single, contiguous piece with the main specimen. This typically requires excising an ellipse of skin over the entry point.\n\n4.  **Lateral Margins (to address SI Joint Abutment):**\n    *   **Right Side:** The tumor abuts the articular cartilage of the right SI joint, but the cartilage and subchondral bone are intact, and the ilium is uninvolved. The barrier concept allows for the use of intact joint cartilage as a margin. Therefore, the correct lateral margin on the right is a transarticular disarticulation through the SI joint. Resecting the ilium (internal hemipelvectomy) would be unnecessarily morbid, as the ilium is protected by the intact cartilage barrier.\n    *   **Left Side:** The left SI joint and iliac wing are free of tumor. The lateral margin on the left is also a transarticular disarticulation through the left SI joint.\n\n**Synthesized Plan:** The definitive oncologic resection requires an en bloc total sacrectomy. The proximal margin will be the $L5$–$S1$ disc space. The lateral margins will be the sacroiliac joints, bilaterally. The posterior margin must include a wide cuff of soft tissue and the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue incorporating the entire biopsy tract.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Posterior-only intralesional debulking of the soft-tissue mass with high-speed burring of exposed bone, adjuvant cautery and phenolization, preservation of all sacral nerve roots, and retention of the prior biopsy tract to minimize soft-tissue loss.**\n*   **Evaluation:** This plan proposes an intralesional resection, which is a gross violation of oncologic principles for a curative-intent surgery on sarcoma. It explicitly retains the contaminated biopsy tract and fails to address the main tumor mass or the $S1$ skip lesion properly.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. En bloc partial sacrectomy below $S2$ to preserve $S2$ roots for continence, accepting a close posterior margin given the cortical breach, leaving the $S1$ skip lesion to be treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, and avoiding resection of the biopsy tract to prevent wound morbidity.**\n*   **Evaluation:** This plan fails on multiple counts. The resection level below $S2$ leaves the $S1$ skip lesion in situ. Relying on radiotherapy for gross residual chondrosarcoma is ineffective. It also proposes avoiding resection of the biopsy tract, which is oncologically unacceptable.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. En bloc sacrectomy extending proximally to and through the $L5$–$S1$ disc to encompass the $S1$ skip lesion, with bilateral transarticular disarticulation through both SI joints using the articular cartilage as a natural barrier where intact, inclusion of a wide posterior soft-tissue cuff beyond the breached posterior cortex, and en bloc resection of the entire prior biopsy tract and overlying skin ellipse with the specimen; intraoperative frozen sections limited to remote soft-tissue edges and not across the contaminated posterior plane.**\n*   **Evaluation:** This plan perfectly aligns with the derived optimal strategy.\n    *   It correctly sets the proximal margin at the $L5$–$S1$ disc to clear the $S1$ skip lesion.\n    *   It correctly uses the SI joint cartilage as the lateral barrier for a transarticular resection.\n    *   It correctly mandates a wide posterior soft-tissue margin due to the cortical breach.\n    *   It correctly resects the biopsy tract en bloc.\n    *   The detail about frozen section use is also clinically and oncologically sound.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. En bloc internal hemipelvectomy including the right iliac wing because the tumor abuts the right SI joint, plus sacrectomy to $S1$, while preserving the prior biopsy tract separately to avoid enlarging the soft-tissue defect.**\n*   **Evaluation:** This plan is flawed in two major ways. First, it proposes an internal hemipelvectomy, which is excessive given the intact articular cartilage barrier at the right SI joint. Second, it explicitly proposes preserving the biopsy tract, violating a cardinal rule of sarcoma surgery.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. En bloc total sacrectomy with a transosseous osteotomy through the $S1$ body, maintaining a $5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ bony margin because cortical bone constitutes a thick barrier even when the posterior cortex is breached, and leaving the biopsy tract in situ since it is extra-compartmental to the bone.**\n*   **Evaluation:** This plan is fundamentally flawed. A transosseous osteotomy through the $S1$ body means cutting through bone known to contain a skip lesion, which would result in a positive margin. The reasoning about the cortical barrier is a misapplication of the principle, and leaving the biopsy tract in situ is a grave error.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "problem": "A patient with a primary sacral chordoma requires a unilateral hemisacrectomy at the first sacral level (S1) that removes a lateral wedge of the S1 ala. For biomechanical planning, approximate the transverse cross-section at S1 as follows: the central sacral body is a rectangle of width $30 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and height $20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and each S1 ala is a trapezoid of height $20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ with parallel bases $15 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $25 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The resection removes, from the ipsilateral ala only, a right-triangular wedge whose base is $10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ along the lateral border and whose height spans the full $20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Assume the sacrum–pelvis system can be idealized as two parallel axial load paths through the left and right Sacroiliac joint (SI joint), each behaving as a linear elastic spring with axial stiffness proportional to the corresponding bone cross-sectional area at the S1 ala; take equal length and material properties for the two paths. Use the axial stiffness relation from linear elasticity and treat the vertical compressive load as shared between the two SI joints according to their axial stiffnesses.\n\nFirst, determine the fraction of total S1 cross-sectional area removed by the wedge (express this fraction as a decimal, not with a percentage sign). Then, based on the stiffness-proportional load sharing, compute the postresection ipsilateral SI joint load fraction $f_{i}$, defined as $f_{i} = F_{i}/F$ where $F_{i}$ is the load carried through the ipsilateral SI joint and $F$ is the total vertical compressive load. Round your final answer for $f_{i}$ to $4$ significant figures and express it as a decimal fraction with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in principles of geometry and linear elastic mechanics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: first, the determination of various cross-sectional areas and the fraction of total area removed by the surgical resection; second, a biomechanical analysis of load distribution based on a parallel spring model where stiffness is proportional to the remaining cross-sectional area of the sacroiliac (SI) joint load paths.\n\nFirst, we calculate the relevant cross-sectional areas based on the provided geometric model.\n\nLet $A_b$ be the area of the central sacral body, which is modeled as a rectangle.\nGiven width $w_b = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and height $h = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$A_b = w_b \\times h = (30 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) \\times (20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) = 600 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nLet $A_{ala}$ be the area of a single, intact S$1$ ala, which is modeled as a trapezoid.\nGiven height $h = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and parallel bases $b_1 = 15 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $b_2 = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$A_{ala} = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h = \\frac{1}{2}(15 \\ \\mathrm{mm} + 25 \\ \\mathrm{mm})(20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) = \\frac{1}{2}(40 \\ \\mathrm{mm})(20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) = 400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nThe total initial cross-sectional area of the S$1$ level, $A_{total}$, consists of the central body and two alae.\n$$A_{total} = A_b + 2 \\times A_{ala} = 600 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 + 2 \\times (400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2) = 1400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nThe resected wedge is a right triangle. Let its area be $A_w$.\nGiven base $b_w = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and height $h_w = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$A_w = \\frac{1}{2} b_w h_w = \\frac{1}{2}(10 \\ \\mathrm{mm})(20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the fraction of the total S$1$ cross-sectional area removed by the wedge.\n$$\\text{Fraction removed} = \\frac{A_w}{A_{total}} = \\frac{100 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2}{1400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2} = \\frac{1}{14}$$\nAs a decimal, this fraction is approximately $0.071428...$.\n\nNext, we analyze the load distribution. The system is modeled as two springs in parallel, representing the load paths through the left and right SI joints. For springs in parallel, the displacement, $\\delta$, under a total axial load $F$ is the same for both. The load is distributed between the springs according to their stiffness. Let $F_i$ and $F_c$ be the loads on the ipsilateral (resected) and contralateral (intact) sides, and let $k_i$ and $k_c$ be their respective axial stiffnesses.\n\nThe total load is $F = F_i + F_c$.\nThe force on each spring is given by Hooke's Law: $F_i = k_i \\delta$ and $F_c = k_c \\delta$.\nThe ipsilateral load fraction, $f_i$, is defined as $f_i = F_i / F$.\nWe can express $F$ in terms of $F_i$:\n$F = F_i + F_c = F_i + (k_c/k_i)F_i = F_i \\left(1 + \\frac{k_c}{k_i}\\right) = F_i \\left(\\frac{k_i + k_c}{k_i}\\right)$.\nTherefore, the load fraction is:\n$$f_i = \\frac{F_i}{F} = \\frac{k_i}{k_i + k_c}$$\n\nThe problem states that axial stiffness is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the corresponding S$1$ ala, which forms the load path. Let the proportionality constant be $C$.\n$$k = C \\times A_{\\text{ala-path}}$$\nThe contralateral ala is intact, so its area, $A_c$, is the full area of an ala.\n$$A_c = A_{ala} = 400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nThe ipsilateral ala has been partially resected, so its remaining area, $A_i$, is the original area minus the area of the wedge.\n$$A_i = A_{ala} - A_w = 400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 - 100 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 = 300 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n\nNow we can write the stiffnesses in terms of these areas:\n$k_c = C \\cdot A_c$\n$k_i = C \\cdot A_i$\n\nSubstituting these into the load fraction equation:\n$$f_i = \\frac{C \\cdot A_i}{C \\cdot A_i + C \\cdot A_c} = \\frac{A_i}{A_i + A_c}$$\nThe proportionality constant $C$ cancels, showing that the load distribution depends only on the ratio of the cross-sectional areas.\n\nSubstituting the calculated area values:\n$$f_i = \\frac{300 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2}{300 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 + 400 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2} = \\frac{300}{700} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer for $f_i$ to be expressed as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$f_i = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4285714...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.4286$.",

            "problem": "A multidisciplinary team performs an en bloc partial sacrectomy with a right posterolateral spinopelvic soft-tissue resection for a primary sacral chordoma. The specimen is oriented and inked, and the pathologist provides a margin map that includes both measured linear distances from the ink to the nearest viable tumor cells and the histologic characterization of the intervening tissue. The team must decide, under Enneking’s oncologic surgical margin conventions for musculoskeletal tumors, which margins meet the criteria for a wide margin versus a marginal margin.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning:\n- Enneking margin definitions: a marginal margin passes through the reactive zone and along the tumor pseudocapsule; a wide margin passes through normal tissue outside the reactive zone. Intact anatomic barriers (for example, fascia, joint capsule, cortical bone) are considered effective barriers that place the margin outside the reactive zone when they lie entirely between the tumor and the inked edge, even if the linear distance is small. An intralesional margin violates the tumor itself and is not considered here because no margin has tumor at ink.\n- Pathology maps provide measured distances and whether the interposed tissue is normal tissue versus reactive zone and whether an intact barrier lies entirely between the tumor and the ink.\n\nSpecimen margins and pathology map details:\n- Anterior presacral margin: distance from ink to tumor is $2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The presacral fascia is intact and lies entirely between the tumor and the ink. Histology shows a reactive zone of $1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ near the tumor, with no tumor infiltration of the presacral fascia.\n- Left iliosacral osteotomy margin: an osteotomy through the ilium places the cut surface $15 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ from the nearest tumor.

Histology shows a reactive zone thickness of $5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in this sector.\n- Posterior dorsal midline soft-tissue margin: distance from ink to tumor is $10 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

This case is explicitly excluded from consideration.\n\n**Specimen-Specific Pathology Data:**\n\n1.  **Anterior presacral margin:**\n    *   Distance (ink to tumor): $2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Barrier: Intact presacral fascia is present between the tumor and the ink.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n2.  **Left iliosacral osteotomy margin:**\n    *   Distance: $15 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Barrier: Intact sacroiliac joint capsule is present between the tumor and the ink.\n    *   Histology: Cancellous bone beyond the capsule is free of reactive changes.\n\n3.  **Right posterolateral soft-tissue margin:**\n    *   Distance: $4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Barrier: No intact fascial barrier.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n4.  **Posterior dorsal midline soft-tissue margin:**\n    *   Distance: $10 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Barrier: Intact thoracolumbar fascia is present between the tumor and the ink.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n5.  **Inferior coccygeal bone cut margin:**\n    *   Distance: $0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Barrier: No intervening cortical plate.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Question:**\nClassify these five margins as wide or marginal based on the provided Enneking conventions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the well-established Enneking classification system, a fundamental concept in musculoskeletal surgical oncology. The scenario of a sacral chordoma resection and the associated pathological details (reactive zones, fascial barriers, measured distances) are clinically and scientifically realistic. The definitions provided are accurate representations of the principles.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of rules and a complete dataset for each of the five margins. The task is to apply these rules to the data, which leads to a unique and stable classification for each margin and, consequently, a single correct answer.\n*   **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity.

The classification is based on accepted medical standards.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe classification of each margin will be determined by applying the given Enneking principles. A margin is **wide** if the resection is through normal tissue or if an intact anatomic barrier separates the tumor from the resection plane. A margin is **marginal** if the resection passes through the reactive zone without an intervening barrier.\n\n1.  **Anterior presacral margin:**\n    *   The pathology report confirms an \"intact presacral fascia\" lies entirely between the tumor and the ink.\n    *   According to the provided definition, an intact anatomic barrier automatically confers the status of a wide margin.\n    *   Additionally, the distance to the tumor ($2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is greater than the thickness of the reactive zone ($1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$), which independently satisfies the condition for a resection through normal tissue.\n    *   **Classification: Wide.**\n\n2.  **Left iliosacral osteotomy margin:**\n    *   The pathology report confirms an \"intact sacroiliac joint capsule\" lies between the tumor and the inked osteotomy. The joint capsule is an anatomic barrier.\n    *   Therefore, this margin is wide based on the barrier rule.\n    *   The large distance of $15 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the absence of reactive changes in the tissue beyond the capsule further confirm this classification.\n    *   **Classification: Wide.**\n\n3.  **Right posterolateral soft-tissue margin:**\n    *   The report states there is \"no intact fascial barrier.\"\n    *   Classification therefore depends on the comparison between the resection distance and the reactive zone thickness.\n    *   Distance to tumor: $4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Since the distance ($4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is less than the reactive zone thickness ($5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the resection plane passes *through* the reactive zone.\n    *   **Classification: Marginal.**\n\n4.  **Posterior dorsal midline soft-tissue margin:**\n    *   The report confirms an \"intact thoracolumbar fascia\" lies between the tumor and the ink.\n    *   This intact anatomic barrier classifies the margin as wide.\n    *   Additionally, the distance ($10 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is greater than the reactive zone thickness ($2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$), reinforcing this conclusion.\n    *   **Classification: Wide.**\n\n5.  **Inferior coccygeal bone cut margin:**\n    *   The report states there is \"no intervening cortical plate,\" meaning no effective anatomic barrier is present within the cancellous bone.\n    *   Classification depends on the distance versus the reactive zone thickness.\n    *   Distance to tumor: $0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Reactive zone thickness: $1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   Since the distance ($0.5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is less than the reactive zone thickness ($1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the resection has occurred within the reactive zone.\n    *   **Classification: Marginal.**\n\n**Summary of Classifications:**\n*   Anterior margin: **Wide**\n*   Left iliosacral margin: **Wide**\n*   Right posterolateral margin: **Marginal**\n*   Posterior margin: **Wide**\n*   Inferior coccygeal margin: **Marginal**\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the derived classifications, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. Anterior, left iliosacral osteotomy, and posterior margins meet wide criteria; right posterolateral and inferior coccygeal margins are marginal.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the analysis. The three margins with intact barriers or sufficient distance (anterior, left iliosacral, posterior) are correctly identified as wide. The two margins that pass through the reactive zone without a barrier (right posterolateral, inferior coccygeal) are correctly identified as marginal.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. All margins meet wide criteria because all measured distances are positive (greater than 0 mm).**\nThis statement misinterprets the definitions. A positive distance only confirms the margin is not intralesional (i.e., tumor is not at the inked edge). It does not distinguish between a marginal and wide margin. The right posterolateral and inferior coccygeal margins are marginal, contradicting the claim that all are wide.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Only margins with distances at least 10 mm are wide; the rest are marginal.**\nThis creates an arbitrary rule based on a fixed distance ($10 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$) that is not part of the provided Enneking principles. It incorrectly ignores the critical role of anatomical barriers. For instance, the anterior margin, with a distance of $2 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$, is wide due to the intact fascia, but this option would classify it as marginal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The anterior margin is marginal because the measured distance is less than 5 mm despite an intact presacral fascia; the right posterolateral margin is wide because it has a 4 mm muscle cuff.**\nThis statement contains two fundamental errors. First, it incorrectly states the anterior margin is marginal; the presence of the intact fascia makes it wide by definition. Second, it incorrectly classifies the right posterolateral margin as wide. A \"muscle cuff\" is not an anatomical barrier like fascia, and since the $4 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ cuff is within the $5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$ reactive zone, the margin is marginal, not wide.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
