            "problem": "A patient has a primary gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) measuring $5$ cm in maximum diameter. Pathology reports a mitotic index of $6$ mitoses per $5 \\, \\text{mm}^2$, which by conventional equivalence corresponds to the standard $50$ high-power fields (HPF) count. Use the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) risk stratification for gastric GIST to determine the applicable risk category and then estimate the $5$-year cumulative probability of recurrence (progressive disease) under the following assumptions.\n\nAssumptions and foundational facts:\n- A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract typically driven by mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway; risk of recurrence is stratified by tumor site, size, and mitotic rate.\n- The AFIP classification for gastric GIST reports the long-term risk of progressive disease (metastasis or tumor-related death) by size and mitotic rate categories. For gastric tumors, use these category values:\n  1. Size $\\leq 2$ cm, mitotic rate $\\leq 5$ per $5 \\, \\text{mm}^2$: $0$\n  2.

The provided values are consistent with clinical literature.\n    - The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data, a clear mathematical model, and explicit instructions (e.g., handling of the boundary value for size) to determine a unique solution.\n    - The problem is objective, using precise, quantitative language.\n    - No flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity are present.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps: (1) identification of the correct risk category, (2) calibration of the model parameter $\\lambda$, and (3) calculation of the $5$-year cumulative probability of recurrence, $F(5)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the AFIP Risk Category**\nThe patient's tumor is characterized by two parameters: size and mitotic rate.\n- Tumor size is specified as $5$ cm. The problem explicitly directs that this boundary value falls into the category defined as `size >2 to <= 5 cm`.\n- The mitotic rate is given as $6$ mitoses per $5 \\, \\text{mm}^2$. This value is greater than the threshold of $5$ mitoses per $5 \\, \\text{mm}^2$, placing it in the `mitotic rate >5 per 5 mm²` category.\n\nCombining these two classifications, the tumor corresponds to the AFIP category: **Size $>2$ to $\\leq 5$ cm, mitotic rate $>5$ per $5 \\, \\text{mm}^2$**. From the provided list, this is category 6.\n\n**Step 2: Calibrate the Hazard Rate $\\lambda$**\nFor this category, the problem provides a risk value of $0.16$. This is defined as the $10$-year cumulative incidence of progressive disease, $F(10)$.\n$$F(10) = 0.16$$\nThe recurrence is modeled by the cumulative incidence function $F(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $t$ is time in years and $\\lambda$ is the constant hazard rate. We use the given data point to find $\\lambda$.\n$$F(10) = 1 - \\exp(-10\\lambda) = 0.16$$\nWe solve this equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\exp(-10\\lambda) = 1 - 0.16$$\n$$\\exp(-10\\lambda) = 0.84$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$-10\\lambda = \\ln(0.84)$$\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.84)}{10}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 5-Year Recurrence Probability $F(5)$**\nThe goal is to find the $5$-year cumulative probability of recurrence, $F(5)$. We use the same model, now with the calibrated value of $\\lambda$.\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\exp(-5\\lambda)$$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\lambda$ derived in the previous step:\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-5 \\left(-\\frac{\\ln(0.84)}{10}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{5}{10} \\ln(0.84)\\right)$$\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(0.84)\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $a \\ln(x) = \\ln(x^a)$, the expression simplifies:\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(0.84^{1/2}\\right)\\right)$$\nSince the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse functions, $\\exp(\\ln(y)) = y$:\n$$F(5) = 1 - 0.84^{1/2}$$\n$$F(5) = 1 - \\sqrt{0.84}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.84} \\approx 0.916515139$$\n$$F(5) \\approx 1 - 0.916515139 = 0.083484861$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.083484861$ are $8$, $3$, $4$, and $8$. The next digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last significant digit.\n$$F(5) \\approx 0.08348$$\nThis is the estimated $5$-year cumulative probability of recurrence for this patient.",

The patient's presentation (melena, anemia), imaging findings ($9$ cm gastric mass with pancreatic abutment), and pathology (spindle cells positive for CD117 and DOG1) are a classic and coherent representation of a large, high-risk GIST. The provided principles are the established cornerstones of modern GIST management.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific, detailed clinical case and asks for the selection of the best management strategy from a list of options by applying a given set of explicit principles. A unique, optimal solution can be logically derived.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and uses precise, standard medical terminology. It is free from subjective or biased language.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to make an informed decision. The given facts (large tumor size, potential pancreatic invasion, KIT-positivity, patient stability) are internally consistent and set up a clear decision-making challenge.\n*   **Realism:** The scenario is highly realistic and represents a complex but common problem in surgical oncology. All data points are plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe patient presents with a large ($9$ cm) GIST. Tumors of this size carry a high risk of malignancy and are often friable, increasing the risk of intraoperative rupture. The key finding on CT is the \"loss of fat plane\" between the tumor and the pancreas, which is highly suggestive of tumor adherence or frank invasion. The patient is hemodynamically stable, meaning there is no emergency requiring immediate surgery, which allows for a considered, multidisciplinary approach. The tumor is confirmed to be KIT-positive, making it a candidate for TKI therapy.\n\nLet's apply the given principles to this scenario:\n\n*   **Principle (i) and (ii):** The surgical goal is an $R0$ resection. Given the potential pancreatic involvement, an upfront surgery would necessitate an *en bloc* resection of the stomach and the involved part of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy) to satisfy these principles. This is a major operation with significant morbidity.\n*   **Principle (v):** A minimally invasive (laparoscopic) approach for a $9$ cm tumor, especially one that is exophytic and abutting the pancreas, carries an unacceptably high risk of tumor rupture. Tumor rupture leads to peritoneal dissemination and dramatically worsens prognosis. Therefore, an upfront laparoscopic approach is contraindicated by this principle.\n*   **Principle (iii):** Regardless of the surgical approach, a formal lymphadenectomy is not indicated, as GISTs rarely involve lymph nodes.\n*   **Principle (iv):** This principle is central to the decision. Since the tumor is KIT-positive and the patient is stable, there is an opportunity to use neoadjuvant TKI therapy (imatinib is the standard first-line agent). The goals of neoadjuvant therapy are twofold: first, to decrease the tumor size and friability, thereby reducing the risk of intraoperative rupture; and second, to potentially shrink the tumor away from the pancreas, which could convert a required multivisceral resection into a less morbid simple gastrectomy. This ability to de-escalate major surgery without compromising oncologic safety is a key advantage.\n\nBased on this synthesis, the optimal strategy is to leverage neoadjuvant therapy to improve the conditions for a safe and effective surgical resection.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on this reasoning.\n\n**A. Proceed with immediate laparoscopic wedge gastrectomy, minimizing manipulation with atraumatic graspers to avoid capsular rupture.**\nThis option is deeply flawed. A laparoscopic approach for a $9$ cm GIST is oncologically hazardous due to the high risk of rupture (violates principle v). Furthermore, a simple wedge gastrectomy completely ignores the high suspicion of pancreatic involvement, making an $R0$ resection highly unlikely (violates principles i and ii). Minimal manipulation cannot sufficiently mitigate the risk for a tumor of this size and location.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Proceed with immediate open partial gastrectomy en bloc with distal pancreatectomy (and splenectomy if required) to achieve $R0$ resection given suspected pancreatic invasion; no lymphadenectomy.**\nThis option describes an oncologically sound surgical procedure if immediate surgery were the only choice. It correctly identifies the need for an open approach and an *en bloc* resection to address the pancreatic involvement (honoring principles i, ii, and v) and correctly omits lymphadenectomy (honoring principle iii). However, it fails to consider the significant benefit of neoadjuvant therapy outlined in principle (iv). In a stable patient with a KIT-positive tumor, forgoing the chance to potentially avoid a major pancreatic resection is not the *best* management strategy. It is a valid but suboptimal approach.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Obtain tissue confirmation (already available), initiate neoadjuvant imatinib for approximately $8$–$12$ weeks, restage to assess separation from the pancreas, and plan an open resection if multivisceral resection remains likely; consider a laparoscopic approach only if post-therapy imaging and intraoperative assessment indicate clear separation and low risk of rupture.**\nThis option represents the most sophisticated and appropriate management plan, correctly integrating all provided principles. It leverages the tumor's KIT-positivity to employ neoadjuvant therapy (principle iv) with the explicit goal of downsizing the tumor and de-escalating the required surgery. It correctly establishes a plan to restage after therapy to guide the surgical decision. It defaults to an open resection, the safest approach for a large or adherent tumor (honoring principles i, ii, v), while prudently leaving open the possibility of a minimally invasive approach only if specific, strict criteria for safety are met post-therapy. This strategy maximizes the chances of an $R0$ resection while minimizing surgical morbidity. The duration of $8–12$ weeks is shorter than the typical $6–12$ months, but it reflects a reasonable timeframe to assess initial response before committing to a longer course or proceeding to surgery.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Schedule endoscopic submucosal dissection to avoid major surgery, given the submucosal origin and well-circumscribed nature of GISTs.**\nThis option is wholly inappropriate. Endoscopic resection techniques are reserved for very small ($< 2$ cm), endoluminal GISTs. A $9$ cm exophytic tumor that likely penetrates the full thickness of the gastric wall and involves an adjacent organ is an absolute contraindication for endoscopic removal. An attempt would guarantee incomplete resection and tumor spillage (violates principles i, ii, v).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
