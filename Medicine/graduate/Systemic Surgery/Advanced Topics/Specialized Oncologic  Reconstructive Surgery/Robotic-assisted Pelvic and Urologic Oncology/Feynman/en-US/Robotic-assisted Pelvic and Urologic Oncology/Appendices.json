The entry surface of the tissue is the plane $z=0$, and the exit surface is the plane $z=t$.\n\nThe intended entry point is at the origin of our coordinate system, $P_{entry} = (0, 0)$. The intended exit point, or target, lies on the z-axis at the exit surface, so its coordinates are $P_{target} = (0, t)$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the surgeon aligns the needle with the camera's optical axis.
