            "problem": "A surgical oncology team resects an invasive breast carcinoma via segmental mastectomy. The pathology report describes three separate invasive foci confined to one quadrant with measured greatest dimensions of $8\\,\\text{mm}$, $12\\,\\text{mm}$, and $4\\,\\text{mm}$, accompanied by extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). There is no clinical or pathologic evidence of invasion into the skin or chest wall, and the specimen shows no features of inflammatory carcinoma. For multifocal invasive breast carcinoma, the pathologic tumor category is determined by the greatest dimension of the largest invasive focus. Extensive DCIS does not change the pathologic tumor category for invasive disease in the absence of skin or chest wall involvement.\n\nDefine a numeric encoding function $E$ for the pathologic T category such that $E(\\mathrm{Tis}) = 0$, $E(\\mathrm{T1a}) = 1$, $E(\\mathrm{T1b}) = 2$, $E(\\mathrm{T1c}) = 3$, $E(\\mathrm{T2}) = 4$, $E(\\mathrm{T3}) = 5$, and $E(\\mathrm{T4}) = 6$. Compute $E$ for this specimen. Express your final answer as a pure number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a numeric value representing the pathologic T category of a resected breast carcinoma specimen. The computation involves applying staging rules to the given pathological findings and then using a provided encoding function.\n\nFirst, we must determine the effective tumor size for staging purposes. The pathology report describes three distinct invasive foci with greatest dimensions $d_1 = 8\\,\\text{mm}$, $d_2 = 12\\,\\text{mm}$, and $d_3 = 4\\,\\text{mm}$. The problem provides a crucial rule for such multifocal disease: \"For multifocal invasive breast carcinoma, the pathologic tumor category is determined by the greatest dimension of the largest invasive focus.\"\n\nLet $D_{\\text{max}}$ be the dimension used for staging. According to the rule, $D_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum value among the dimensions of the individual foci.\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = \\max(d_1, d_2, d_3)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{max}} = \\max(8\\,\\text{mm}, 12\\,\\text{mm}, 4\\,\\text{mm}) = 12\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe report notes the presence of \"extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\". However, the problem specifies that \"Extensive DCIS does not change the pathologic tumor category for invasive disease in the absence of skin or chest wall involvement.\" As the problem also states there is no such involvement, the presence of DCIS is not a factor in determining the T category of the invasive component. Furthermore, the absence of skin or chest wall invasion and features of inflammatory carcinoma confirms that the category is not $\\mathrm{T4}$.\n\nNext, we map the determined dimension $D_{\\text{max}} = 12\\,\\text{mm}$ to the appropriate pathologic T category. The standard definitions for T categories (based on the AJCC staging system) are as follows:\n- $\\mathrm{Tis}$: Carcinoma in situ.\n- $\\mathrm{T1}$: Tumor with greatest dimension $\\le 20\\,\\text{mm}$.\n  - $\\mathrm{T1a}$: Tumor $> 1\\,\\text{mm}$ and $\\le 5\\,\\text{mm}$.\n  - $\\mathrm{T1b}$: Tumor $> 5\\,\\text{mm}$ and $\\le 10\\,\\text{mm}$.\n  - $\\mathrm{T1c}$: Tumor $> 10\\,\\text{mm}$ and $\\le 20\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- $\\mathrm{T2}$: Tumor $> 20\\,\\text{mm}$ and $\\le 50\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- $\\mathrm{T3}$: Tumor $> 50\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- $\\mathrm{T4}$: Tumor of any size with direct extension to chest wall or skin, or inflammatory carcinoma.\n\nOur staging dimension is $D_{\\text{max}} = 12\\,\\text{mm}$. We evaluate this dimension against the criteria for the T categories. The value $12\\,\\text{mm}$ satisfies the inequality $10\\,\\text{mm}  12\\,\\text{mm} \\le 20\\,\\text{mm}$. Therefore, the pathologic T category for this specimen is $\\mathrm{T1c}$.\n\nFinally, we apply the given numeric encoding function, $E$, to the determined T category. The function is defined as:\n$E(\\mathrm{Tis}) = 0$\n$E(\\mathrm{T1a}) = 1$\n$E(\\mathrm{T1b}) = 2$\n$E(\\mathrm{T1c}) = 3$\n$E(\\mathrm{T2}) = 4$\n$E(\\mathrm{T3}) = 5$\n$E(\\mathrm{T4}) = 6$\n\nFor the category $\\mathrm{T1c}$, the function yields the value:\n$$E(\\mathrm{T1c}) = 3$$\nThis is the required numerical result.",

            "problem": "A patient with invasive breast cancer undergoes sentinel lymph node biopsy, yielding two axillary sentinel lymph nodes. The pathology report identifies a cluster measuring $0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in one node and a contiguous metastatic deposit measuring $2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in the other, with no extranodal extension.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a nodal index, $N$, based on the pathologic findings in two sentinel lymph nodes from a patient with invasive breast carcinoma. The solution involves a systematic application of the provided definitions from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Eighth Edition.\n\nFirst, we must classify the metastatic deposit in each of the two lymph nodes. Let $d_1$ be the size of the deposit in the first node and $d_2$ be the size of the deposit in the second node.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Size of deposit in the first node: $d_1 = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Size of deposit in the second node: $d_2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe AJCC definitions for the size of metastatic deposits are:\n- Isolated tumor cells (ITC): deposit size $\\le 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Micrometastases: deposit size $> 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $\\le 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Macrometastases: deposit size $> 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nLet us classify the first node. The deposit size is $d_1 = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since $0.15 \\le 0.2$, this finding is classified as isolated tumor cells (ITC). According to the problem statement, a finding of only ITCs is designated as $pN0(\\mathrm{i}+)$, which is a subcategory of $pN0$.\n\nNext, let us classify the second node. The deposit size is $d_2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since $2.5 > 2.0$, this finding is classified as a macrometastasis.\n\nThe overall pathologic regional lymph node category, $pN$, is determined by the most advanced finding across all evaluated lymph nodes. The presence of a macrometastasis in one node supersedes the finding of ITCs in another. Therefore, the overall staging is based on the presence of the macrometastasis.\n\nThe presence of any metastasis larger than ITCs means the stage must be at least $pN1$. The problem provides qualitative descriptions for the $pN$ categories and mentions specific subcategories like $pN1\\mathrm{mi}$ and $pN1\\mathrm{a}$. The standard AJCC Eighth Edition definition for the $pN1\\mathrm{a}$ category is metastases in $1$ to $3$ axillary lymph nodes, with at least one metastasis being a macrometastasis (i.e., $> 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).\n\nIn this case, the patient has exactly one lymph node containing a macrometastasis ($d_2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and one node containing only ITCs. The number of nodes with metastases greater than ITCs is one. This situation fits the criteria for $pN1\\mathrm{a}$ (metastasis in $1$ to $3$ nodes, with at least one macrometastasis). Therefore, the patient's pathologic regional lymph node category is $pN1\\mathrm{a}$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the integer nodal index $N$ using the provided mapping. The mapping is defined as:\n- $pN0 \\mapsto N=0$\n- any $pN1$ subcategory (including $pN1\\mathrm{mi}$ and $pN1\\mathrm{a}$) $\\mapsto N=1$\n- any $pN2$ subcategory $\\mapsto N=2$\n- any $pN3$ subcategory $\\mapsto N=3$\n\nSince the determined stage is $pN1\\mathrm{a}$, which is a subcategory of $pN1$, the corresponding nodal index is $N=1$.",
