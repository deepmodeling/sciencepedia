            "introduction": "Effective nodal basin management begins with the accurate interpretation of diagnostic information. The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a cornerstone of modern surgical oncology, but its results are not absolute. This exercise  demonstrates how to apply Bayes’ theorem to update our assessment of a patient's risk, moving from a general pretest probability of disease to a more precise posttest probability after receiving a test result. Mastering this calculation is fundamental to risk-stratifying patients and making informed decisions about further treatment, such as completion lymphadenectomy.",

            "problem": "In the context of gastric cancer surgery, adequate lymphadenectomy and nodal basin management are required to accurately stage disease and guide adjuvant therapy. Consider a patient with pathologic tumor category T3 (pT3) gastric adenocarcinoma according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Assume the following fundamental base consistent with surgical oncology practice and probabilistic modeling:\n\n- Each lymph node in the dissected nodal basin, when submitted for pathologic evaluation, has an identical and independent probability of true tumor involvement equal to $p$.\n- Pathologic assessment perfectly classifies nodes as positive or negative when tumor is present or absent, respectively.\n- Accurate nodal staging for the purpose of identifying node-positive disease is achieved if at least one truly positive node is detected among the examined nodes.\n\nSuppose the true nodal involvement rate is $p = 0.20$ across the nodal basin of interest, and you require a probability of at least $0.95$ to detect at least one positive node among the examined nodes.

No rounding beyond integer selection is required, and no physical units are needed in your answer. Express any intermediate probabilities as decimals or fractions.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of lymph nodes, $n$, that must be examined to ensure the probability of detecting at least one positive node is at least $0.95$, given that the true probability of any single node being positive is $p = 0.20$. The examinations are considered independent events.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial corresponds to the pathologic examination of a single lymph node.\n\nLet $E_i$ be the event that the $i$-th lymph node examined is positive for tumor involvement.\nThe problem provides the probability of this event for any node:\n$P(E_i) = p = 0.20$.\n\nThe event that the $i$-th lymph node is negative is the complement of $E_i$, denoted $E_i^c$. The probability is:\n$P(E_i^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nWe are interested in the event $A$, defined as \"at least one positive node is detected among the $n$ examined nodes\". The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that \"all $n$ examined nodes are negative\".\n\nUsing the complement rule, the probability of event $A$ is given by:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\n\nSince the pathologic evaluations of the nodes are independent events, the probability that all $n$ nodes are negative is the product of the individual probabilities of each node being negative:\n$$P(A^c) = P(E_1^c \\cap E_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap E_n^c) = P(E_1^c) \\times P(E_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(E_n^c)$$\n$$P(A^c) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times \\dots \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $P(A)$, we get:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\n\nThe problem requires that this probability be at least $0.95$. This gives us the following inequality to solve for $n$:\n$$1 - (1-p)^n \\ge 0.95$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given value of $p = 0.20$:\n$$1 - (1 - 0.20)^n \\ge 0.95$$\n$$1 - (0.80)^n \\ge 0.95$$\n\nTo solve for $n$, we first isolate the term containing $n$:\n$$-(0.80)^n \\ge 0.95 - 1$$\n$$-(0.80)^n \\ge -0.05$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$(0.80)^n \\le 0.05$$\n\nTo solve for the exponent $n$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln((0.80)^n) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we have:\n$$n \\ln(0.80) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n\nTo isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.80)$. It is critical to note a key property of the logarithm: for any number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$, its logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is negative. Since $0 < 0.80 < 1$, $\\ln(0.80)$ is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality's direction once more.\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.80)}$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.80)} \\approx \\frac{-2.99573227}{-0.22314355} \\approx 13.4251$$\n\nThe number of lymph nodes examined, $n$, must be an integer. The inequality states that $n$ must be greater than or equal to approximately $13.4251$. The smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $14$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum nodal yield required is $n=14$.\n\nWe can verify this result:\n- If $n = 13$, the probability of detection is $1 - (0.80)^{13} \\approx 1 - 0.05497558 \\approx 0.9450$, which is less than the required $0.95$.\n- If $n = 14$, the probability of detection is $1 - (0.80)^{14} \\approx 1 - 0.04398046 \\approx 0.9560$, which is greater than or equal to the required $0.95$.\n\nThus, the minimum integer value for $n$ is indeed $14$.",
