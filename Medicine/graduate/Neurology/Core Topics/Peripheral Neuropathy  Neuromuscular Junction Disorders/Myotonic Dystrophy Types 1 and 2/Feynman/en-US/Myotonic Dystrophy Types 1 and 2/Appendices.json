            "problem": "A muscle fiber from a patient with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) or Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2 (DM2) exhibits clinical myotonia. In these disorders, mis-splicing of the Chloride Channel 1 (ClC-1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) reduces sarcolemmal chloride conductance. Suppose cell-attached patch-clamp recordings at a holding potential near rest report a $60\\%$ reduction in ClC-1 current density compared to baseline, and assume ohmic behavior in this voltage range with unchanged reversal potentials.\n\nModel the fiber membrane near rest as a passive parallel combination of a leak chloride conductance and a leak potassium conductance in parallel with a specific membrane capacitance. Take the baseline specific conductances and capacitance per unit area as:\n- Baseline chloride conductance $g_{\\mathrm{Cl},0} = 1.6~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$,\n- Baseline potassium leak conductance $g_{\\mathrm{K},0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$,\n- Specific membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n\nAssume the $60\\%$ reduction in ClC-1 current density translates directly to a $60\\%$ reduction in $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, with $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$ unchanged.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two biophysical parameters for a muscle fiber membrane model relevant to myotonic dystrophy: the new membrane time constant and a threshold conductance for instability, following a reduction in chloride conductance. The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. We will proceed with a step-by-step solution based on first principles of membrane biophysics.\n\nThe membrane is modeled as a passive parallel circuit consisting of a chloride conductance $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, a potassium leak conductance $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$, and a specific membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$. The dynamics of the membrane potential, $V$, are described by the equation:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{m}} \\frac{dV}{dt} + I_{\\text{ion}}(V) = 0$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{ion}}(V)$ is the total ionic current density flowing across the membrane. In the passive state, this current is the sum of the chloride and potassium currents:\n$$I_{\\text{ion}}(V) = I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V)$$\nAssuming ohmic behavior near the resting potential, these currents are given by:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{K}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ are the respective Nernst potentials.\n\nThe total passive membrane conductance per unit area, $g_{\\mathrm{m}}$, is the sum of the individual conductances:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{m}} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} + g_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nFor small deviations from the resting potential, the membrane equation can be linearized. This reveals that the membrane potential returns to rest following a perturbation with a characteristic time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, defined as:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{m}}}{g_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the new membrane time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$**\n\nFirst, we must determine the new total membrane conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$, after the pathological change. The baseline values are given as $g_{\\mathrm{Cl},0} = 1.6~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{K},0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$.\n\nThe problem states a $60\\%$ reduction in the ClC-1 current density, which is assumed to translate directly to a $60\\%$ reduction in the chloride conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. The new chloride conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}}$, is therefore $40\\%$ of its baseline value:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} = (1 - 0.60) \\times g_{\\mathrm{Cl},0} = 0.40 \\times 1.6~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} = 0.64~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nThe potassium leak conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$, remains unchanged, so $g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{K},0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$.\n\nThe new total membrane conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$, is the sum of the new component conductances:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = 0.64~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} + 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} = 0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the new membrane time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$, using the given specific membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{m}}}{g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values and ensuring consistent units (where $1~\\mathrm{mS} = 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{S}$ and $1~\\mathrm{F} = 1~\\mathrm{S/V \\cdot s}$ should be $1~\\mathrm{F} = 1~\\mathrm{A \\cdot s / V}$ and $1~\\mathrm{S} = 1~\\mathrm{A/V}$):\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{F/cm^2}}{0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{S \\cdot s/cm^2}}{0.84 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{S/cm^2}}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1.0}{0.84} \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.190476... \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in milliseconds ($1~\\mathrm{s} = 1000~\\mathrm{ms}$):\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} \\approx 1.190476...~\\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = 1.19~\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThis prolongation of the time constant (the baseline time constant would be $\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.56~\\mathrm{ms}$) is a direct consequence of the reduced membrane conductance.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the threshold inward conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}}$**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the threshold value of a persistent inward conductance that would destabilize the resting potential, leading to repetitive firing (myotonia). This is a question of linear stability analysis.\n\nThe total ionic current now includes the persistent inward \"window\" current, $I_{\\mathrm{p}}(V)$:\n$$I_{\\text{ion,total}}(V) = I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{p}}(V)$$\nThe stability of the resting fixed point is determined by the total slope conductance of the membrane at rest, $G'_{\\text{total}}$. The system is stable if this slope conductance is positive (producing a net outward current in response to a small depolarization) and becomes unstable at the point where it becomes zero.\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{dI_{\\text{ion,total}}}{dV}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$$\nDifferentiating the total current with respect to voltage gives:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{K}}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$$\nThe sum $g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$ is the stabilizing outward leak slope conductance. The term $\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}$ is the slope conductance of the inward current. In the \"window\" region, this current exhibits negative differential resistance, meaning its slope $\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}$ is negative, representing a destabilizing influence.\n\nThe problem defines $g_{\\mathrm{p}}$ as the \"inward slope conductance\". This is best interpreted as the magnitude of the negative slope of the inward current, i.e., $g_{\\mathrm{p}} = -\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}\\big|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$. With this definition, the total slope conductance is:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} - g_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\nThe threshold for instability (the bifurcation point) occurs when the total slope conductance is zero:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = 0 \\implies g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} - g_{\\mathrm{p}} = 0$$\nTherefore, the threshold value of the inward slope conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}}$, required for destabilization must exactly balance the total outward leak slope conductance:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$$\nUsing the value for $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$ calculated in Part 1:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = 0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we express this as:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = 0.840~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nThis result signifies that myotonia is precipitated when an additional inward (destabilizing) conductance slope becomes equal in magnitude to the remaining outward (stabilizing) leak conductance slope. The reduction in the dominant chloride conductance in myotonic dystrophy lowers this threshold, making the muscle fiber more susceptible to hyperexcitability.",

Select all that apply.\n\nA. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, uninterrupted CTG tracts promote both somatic and germline expansion with a maternal transmission bias toward larger expansions, explaining clustering of congenital cases in maternal lineages; introducing interruptions (for example, CCG or CTC) reduces hairpin formation, lowers somatic instability, and shifts transmissions toward stability or contraction, delaying onset.\n\nB.

Interruptions within the CTG tract in myotonic dystrophy type 1 are expected to reduce the effective uninterrupted CUG run length per transcript, thereby diminishing Muscleblind-like protein sequestration and producing milder spliceopathy; consequently, for a given PCR-measured repeat count, interrupted alleles tend to have later onset and fewer congenital presentations.\n\nD. In myotonic dystrophy type 2, intergenerational instability is modest relative to age-dependent somatic mosaicism regardless of very large expansion sizes; interruptions in the complex repeat array stabilize the locus and correlate with later onset and milder multisystem involvement across families.\n\nE.

The concepts presented—trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat expansions, RNA toxicity, protein sequestration by repeat RNA, parent-of-origin effects, hairpin formation, somatic and germline instability, and the stabilizing effect of repeat interruptions—are all core, validated principles in the field of human genetics and neurogenetics. The numerical data provided for repeat sizes, transmission statistics, and ages of onset are realistic and consistent with clinical and research literature.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of empirical observations (the four pedigrees) and a theoretical framework (the foundational base) and asks for the best interpretation that connects them. The information is sufficient to permit a rigorous scientific analysis and evaluation of the given options.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective scientific language, free from subjectivity, ambiguity, or bias.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the provided data and principles.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe analysis requires synthesizing the provided pedigree data with the foundational genetic principles.\n\n**DM1 Analysis (Pedigree A vs. B):**\n- Pedigree A demonstrates the properties of a pure, uninterrupted $CTG$ repeat in DM1. It is highly unstable, especially upon maternal transmission (mean change of $+\\;230$ repeats), which leads to very large expansions (e.g., $400 \\to 950$) and is the sole context for congenital DM1 in this dataset. Paternal transmissions are far more stable (mean change of $+\\;10$). This exemplifies the principles of repeat instability driven by uninterrupted runs and a strong parent-of-origin bias in the germline.\n- Pedigree B shows the effect of introducing interruptions ($CCG$/$CTC$) into the $CTG$ tract. The allele is remarkably stable across transmissions (mean change of $-\\;5$ repeats), with no congenital cases and a much later age of onset. This directly supports the foundational principle that interruptions reduce secondary structure stability and slippage, leading to greater genetic stability and, consequently, a milder clinical phenotype.\n\n**DM2 Analysis (Pedigree C vs. D):**\n- Pedigree C shows a \"largely uninterrupted\" $CCTG$ repeat in DM2. Key features are: very large repeat size ($\\approx 4500$), marked somatic instability (\"marked age-related somatic mosaicism\"), but relatively modest germline instability (mean change near $0$). Crucially, there is no parent-of-origin effect and no congenital cases, distinguishing it from DM1.\n- Pedigree D shows a \"complex interrupted\" $CCTG$ repeat. Compared to Pedigree C, the allele is smaller ($\\approx 2000$ repeats vs. $\\approx 4500$), yet the phenotype is milder (onset age $55$ vs. $35$). The germline stability is even higher than in Pedigree C (changes limited to $\\pm 20$ repeats). This confirms that, as in DM1, interruptions stabilize the repeat locus and are associated with a milder phenotype.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, uninterrupted $CTG$ tracts promote both somatic and germline expansion with a maternal transmission bias toward larger expansions, explaining clustering of congenital cases in maternal lineages; introducing interruptions (for example, $CCG$ or $CTC$) reduces hairpin formation, lowers somatic instability, and shifts transmissions toward stability or contraction, delaying onset.**\n- The first clause accurately describes the findings in Pedigree A: high germline instability with a maternal expansion bias (mean change $+\\;230$) leading to congenital cases. Somatic instability is also noted.\n- The second clause correctly contrasts this with the effect of interruptions, as seen in Pedigree B. Interruptions are expected to reduce hairpin stability (a foundational principle), which manifests as increased transmission stability (mean change $-\\;5$) and a delayed, milder phenotype (no congenital cases, later onset). The term \"lowers somatic instability\" is a reasonable and expected consequence of the same molecular mechanism.\n- This statement provides a comprehensive and accurate synthesis of the DM1 data.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In myotonic dystrophy type 2, parent-of-origin effects mirror those in myotonic dystrophy type 1, with maternal expansions predominating and congenital cases arising when uninterrupted CCTG tracts exceed a threshold length.**\n- This statement is directly contradicted by the evidence from Pedigree C. Pedigree C, which represents DM2, explicitly states \"no parent-of-origin effect is detected\" and \"no congenital cases occur.\"\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Interruptions within the $CTG$ tract in myotonic dystrophy type 1 are expected to reduce the effective uninterrupted $CUG$ run length per transcript, thereby diminishing Muscleblind-like protein sequestration and producing milder spliceopathy; consequently, for a given $PCR$-measured repeat count, interrupted alleles tend to have later onset and fewer congenital presentations.**\n- This option provides a precise molecular explanation for the observed clinical differences. Interruptions in the DNA ($CTG$ tract) will be transcribed into the RNA, breaking up the pure $CUG$ repeat sequence. According to the foundational base, $MBNL$ protein sequestration is driven by the $CUG$ repeat RNA. A shorter or broken run of $CUG$ repeats is less effective at sequestering $MBNL$ proteins, thus mitigating the downstream spliceopathy.\n- The conclusion that this leads to a milder phenotype (later onset, fewer congenital cases) for a given total repeat size is the logical consequence and is consistent with the milder phenotype in Pedigree B compared to A.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In myotonic dystrophy type 2, intergenerational instability is modest relative to age-dependent somatic mosaicism regardless of very large expansion sizes; interruptions in the complex repeat array stabilize the locus and correlate with later onset and milder multisystem involvement across families.**\n- The first clause correctly summarizes the observations from Pedigree C: despite a huge expansion size ($\\approx 4500$ repeats), intergenerational (germline) change is modest, while somatic mosaicism is \"marked.\"\n- The second clause correctly compares Pedigree D (interrupted) with Pedigree C (uninterrupted). The interrupted allele in Pedigree D is highly stable (\"stable within $+\\;/-\\;20$ repeats\") and associated with a later onset and milder disease. This demonstrates that interruptions have a stabilizing and clinically moderating effect in DM2 as well.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The presence of interruptions in myotonic dystrophy type 1 inevitably converts the mutational pattern from expansion-dominated to contraction-dominated, independent of parental sex.**\n- The term \"inevitably\" is an absolute claim that is too strong. The data from Pedigree B shows a mean change of $-\\;5$ repeats with a standard deviation of $25$. While the mean is negative, the large standard deviation implies that both contractions and some expansions occur, which is a shift toward stability or slight contraction bias, not a deterministic conversion to being \"contraction-dominated.\"\n- The statement of independence from parental sex cannot be verified from the data in Pedigree B, which involved \"mixed parental sex\". The primary flaw, however, is the use of \"inevitably\" and \"contraction-dominated,\" which overstates the case. The data shows increased stability, not a guaranteed switch to contractions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Consider the following foundational facts and constraints:\n\n- Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence variants can alter ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein abundance, interactions, and toxicity. In nucleotide repeat expansion diseases, expanded repeats can elicit a toxic gain-of-function at the RNA level, with downstream spliceopathy in multiple tissues.\n- Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expanded cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat in the $3^{\\prime}$ untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by an expanded cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) repeat in intron 1 of the cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP; also known as zinc finger protein 9) gene. Larger germline repeats in DM1 are associated, on average, with earlier onset and greater severity; in DM2, the correlation between measured repeat length and clinical severity is weak or absent across typical clinical cohorts.\n- Somatic mosaicism: repeat lengths are unstable in mitotically active tissues and tend to expand with age; consequently, blood-derived measurements often show a broad distribution rather than a single allele size. Distribution summaries that might be reported include a modal size (most frequent), a mean size (average across the observed smear), and an upper-bound size (longest reliably detected molecules). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, including triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR), preferentially amplify shorter templates; Southern blotting can reveal a smeared distribution extending to higher sizes but is limited by DNA integrity and detection thresholds.\n- Clinical decisions include diagnostic confirmation, prognostic counseling, and reproductive risk counseling (for example, the risk of congenital DM1, which occurs predominantly with maternal transmission and very large inherited expansions).\n\nA $45$-year-old woman with DM1 has a peripheral blood Southern blot showing a broad smear consistent with a CTG expansion, with a visible modal signal near approximately mid-smear, a mean shifted toward the long tail, and an upper-bound extending to very large sizes. A $48$-year-old man with DM2 has a CCTG expansion with an extensive smear typical of DM2 and no clear single dominant peak.\n\nFrom first principles and the constraints above, choose the single reporting policy that maximizes clinical utility and minimizes misinterpretation across DM1 and DM2 when substantial somatic mosaicism is present in blood:\n\nA.

Report the presence of an expansion as the principal result in both DM1 and DM2; for DM1, add an upper-bound estimate only when reproductive or neonatal risk counseling is specifically required, coupled to explicit caveats about somatic mosaicism and maternal transmission; for DM2, avoid quantitative size reporting and provide a standardized comment that repeat size does not predict severity.\n\nD. Report the mean repeat size from the blood distribution for both DM1 and DM2, because it averages tissue burden, reduces sampling noise, and therefore most accurately predicts multisystemic complications such as cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure.\n\nSelect the best option.",

The correlation between measured repeat length and clinical severity is weak or absent.\n4.  **Somatic Mosaicism**: Repeat lengths are unstable in dividing tissues like blood, leading to a size distribution (smear) rather than a single allele size. This distribution tends to expand with age.\n5.  **Reporting Metrics**: Potential metrics from a distribution include modal size, mean size, and upper-bound size.\n6.  **Assay Biases**: PCR-based methods preferentially amplify shorter alleles. Southern blotting reveals a smear but has its own detection limitations.\n7.  **Clinical Utility**: The genetic test results are used for diagnosis, prognosis, and reproductive risk counseling. The risk of congenital DM1 is notably high with maternal transmission of very large expansions.\n8.  **Patient Examples**: A DM1 patient shows a broad smear with a modal peak, a mean shifted towards the long end, and a very large upper-bound. A DM2 patient shows an extensive smear with no clear modal peak.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The premises are scientifically sound. They accurately describe the molecular genetics of DM1 and DM2, the phenomenon of somatic mosaicism, the limitations of standard molecular diagnostic techniques, and the clinical applications of testing. All information aligns with established knowledge in medical genetics and neurology.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear objective (maximize utility, minimize misinterpretation) and a set of constraints (the differing biology of DM1 vs. DM2, and measurement inaccuracies). A unique, best logical choice can be determined by evaluating the proposed policies against these facts.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated objectively, using precise scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a realistic and solvable challenge in clinical laboratory practice. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Optimal Reporting Policy\n\nThe central task is to devise a unified policy for two different diseases where the prognostic value of the primary molecular measure (repeat size) differs dramatically.\n\n1.  **Diagnostic Utility**: For both DM1 and DM2, the presence of an expansion in the pathogenic range is sufficient for diagnosis. A policy should, at a minimum, clearly state this qualitative result.\n\n2.  **Prognostic and Counseling Utility for DM1**:\n    - The problem states that larger *germline* repeats correlate with severity. However, we measure from blood, which exhibits *somatic* expansion. The measured size is not the germline size.\n    - For reproductive counseling, the risk of congenital DM1 is linked to \"very large inherited expansions.\" This suggests that the upper range of the allele distribution is clinically significant, as it may reflect the potential for inheriting a large, disease-causing allele. Therefore, an estimate of the upper-bound size is useful in this specific context.\n    - Any quantitative report for DM1 must be accompanied by a caveat explaining somatic mosaicism to prevent the clinician from misinterpreting a blood-derived number as a precise predictor of disease course or as the definitive germline allele size.\n\n3.  **Prognostic and Counseling Utility for DM2**:\n    - The problem explicitly states that \"the correlation between measured repeat length and clinical severity is weak or absent.\"\n    - This is a critical distinction from DM1. Reporting any specific quantitative size (modal, mean, or upper-bound) for DM2 would be highly misleading, as it would imply a prognostic value that does not exist. This would directly violate the goal of minimizing misinterpretation.\n    - The DM2 patient example highlights that a modal peak may not even be identifiable, making such a metric impractical.\n    - The most responsible action for DM2 is to confirm the presence of the expansion for diagnosis and explicitly state that the size does not correlate with severity.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing a Unified Policy**:\n    - A policy that treats both diseases identically with respect to quantitative reporting (as in options A, B, and D) is inherently flawed because it ignores the fundamental biological difference in their size-severity correlation.\n    - The optimal policy must therefore be conditional. It should have a common basis—reporting the presence of an expansion—but then diverge in its quantitative reporting to reflect the specific clinical utility and potential for misinterpretation for each disease.\n    - **For DM1**: Provide a quantitative estimate (specifically the upper-bound, which is relevant for congenital risk) when clinically indicated, but always with caveats about mosaicism.\n    - **For DM2**: Avoid quantitative reporting and instead provide an explanatory comment about the lack of correlation.\n\nThis synthesized approach maximizes utility by providing relevant data where it matters (DM1) and minimizes harm by preventing misinterpretation where the data is misleading (DM2).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. Report the modal repeat size as the primary quantitative result for both DM1 and DM2, because it best approximates the germline progenitor allele and correlates with clinical severity in both disorders.**\n- This statement is factually incorrect according to the problem givens. It claims a size-severity correlation for DM2, which the problem explicitly states is \"weak or absent\". Furthermore, the DM2 case example indicates a modal peak may not be present, making the policy impractical. Therefore, this option would lead to significant misinterpretation for DM2.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Report the upper-bound repeat size for both DM1 and DM2, because the longest detected molecules reflect the maximum toxic load and therefore best stratify risk and prognosis.**\n- Similar to option A, this policy incorrectly presumes that a quantitative measure (the upper-bound size) can stratify risk and prognosis in DM2. The provided information states the size-severity correlation is weak or absent for DM2, making this policy misleading. While the upper-bound has utility in DM1 for assessing congenital risk, applying the same logic to DM2 is not supported by the givens.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Report the presence of an expansion as the principal result in both DM1 and DM2; for DM1, add an upper-bound estimate only when reproductive or neonatal risk counseling is specifically required, coupled to explicit caveats about somatic mosaicism and maternal transmission; for DM2, avoid quantitative size reporting and provide a standardized comment that repeat size does not predict severity.**\n- This option perfectly aligns with the derived optimal policy.\n- It correctly identifies the primary diagnostic utility for both diseases: the presence of an expansion.\n- It appropriately tailors the secondary reporting for each disease. For DM1, it includes the most relevant quantitative data (upper-bound) for the most critical application (reproductive risk) and mandates necessary caveats. For DM2, it proactively prevents misinterpretation by avoiding misleading numbers and providing a clarifying statement. This policy maximizes utility and minimizes misinterpretation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Report the mean repeat size from the blood distribution for both DM1 and DM2, because it averages tissue burden, reduces sampling noise, and therefore most accurately predicts multisystemic complications such as cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure.**\n- This option contains unsubstantiated claims. The problem does not state that the mean size from blood \"most accurately predicts\" complications. For DM2, any size correlation is noted to be weak or absent. The assertion that a blood-derived mean \"averages tissue burden\" across multiple different tissues is a significant and unproven biological assumption. This policy applies a uniform, and likely misleading, quantitative rule to both diseases.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
