            "introduction": "A cornerstone of evidence-based neurology is the ability to translate findings from large clinical trials into meaningful predictions for an individual patient. This exercise challenges you to move beyond the commonly reported \"relative risk reduction\" to calculate the \"absolute risk reduction,\" a more direct measure of a therapy's impact. Mastering this conversion is essential for communicating treatment benefits and making informed decisions with patients considering anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .",

            "problem": "A patient with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) is being switched from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulation for prevention of embolic ischemic stroke. Assume the following scientifically grounded quantities and conditions: the baseline annual embolic stroke risk under antiplatelet therapy is $0.06$ per patient-year, clinical trials establish a constant relative risk reduction of $0.64$ for embolic stroke when anticoagulation is used compared to antiplatelet therapy in NVAF, and anticoagulation does not alter the incidence of non-embolic stroke mechanisms. Starting from the fundamental definitions that incidence risk is the probability of event occurrence over a specified interval, that relative risk is the ratio of risks between exposed and unexposed groups, and that relative risk reduction is the complement of the relative risk, derive the absolute reduction in embolic event risk attributable to the therapy switch. Express your final numerical answer as a decimal risk per patient-year, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the absolute risk reduction in embolic events when switching a patient with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulation. The solution must be derived from fundamental definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant quantities using symbolic notation, based on the givens:\n- Let $R_{AP}$ be the baseline annual incidence risk of embolic stroke under antiplatelet therapy. From the problem, $R_{AP} = 0.06$ per patient-year.\n- Let $R_{AC}$ be the annual incidence risk of embolic stroke under anticoagulation. This value is unknown and must be calculated.\n- Let $RRR$ be the relative risk reduction for embolic stroke with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet therapy. From the problem, $RRR = 0.64$.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk reduction, which we denote as $ARR$. The absolute risk reduction is the simple difference between the risk in the control group (antiplatelet therapy) and the risk in the treated group (anticoagulation).\n$$\nARR = R_{AP} - R_{AC}\n$$\nTo calculate $ARR$, we must first determine the value of $R_{AC}$. The problem provides definitions that link $R_{AC}$ to the known quantities.\n\nThe relative risk reduction ($RRR$) is defined as the complement of the relative risk ($RR$):\n$$\nRRR = 1 - RR\n$$\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed (treated) group to the risk in the unexposed (control) group:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{R_{AC}}{R_{AP}}\n$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $RR$ into the equation for $RRR$:\n$$\nRRR = 1 - \\frac{R_{AC}}{R_{AP}}\n$$\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown risk, $R_{AC}$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{AC}}{R_{AP}} = 1 - RRR\n$$\n$$\nR_{AC} = R_{AP} \\times (1 - RRR)\n$$\nWith this expression for $R_{AC}$, we can now substitute it back into the equation for the absolute risk reduction, $ARR$:\n$$\nARR = R_{AP} - R_{AC} = R_{AP} - \\left[ R_{AP} \\times (1 - RRR) \\right]\n$$\nDistributing the terms, we get:\n$$\nARR = R_{AP} - R_{AP} + R_{AP} \\times RRR\n$$\nThis simplifies to a direct relationship between $ARR$, $R_{AP}$, and $RRR$:\n$$\nARR = R_{AP} \\times RRR\n$$\nThis derived relationship shows that the absolute risk reduction is the baseline risk multiplied by the relative risk reduction. The provided information that anticoagulation does not alter non-embolic stroke incidence is extraneous to the calculation, as the question specifically concerns the reduction in embolic event risk.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into our derived formula:\n- $R_{AP} = 0.06$\n- $RRR = 0.64$\n$$\nARR = 0.06 \\times 0.64\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\nARR = 0.0384\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal risk per patient-year, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.0384$ has three significant figures (the digits $3$, $8$, and $4$). To express this result with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$\nARR = 0.03840\n$$\nThis is the absolute reduction in embolic event risk attributable to the therapy switch, expressed per patient-year.",

            "introduction": "The most challenging clinical decisions often involve balancing the benefits of a treatment against its potential harms. This advanced problem simulates the intricate process of weighing stroke prevention against bleeding risk for a patient with multiple comorbidities. You will apply the HAS-BLED score, partition stroke risk by etiology, and use the concept of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) to perform a formal decision analysis, providing a quantitative justification for a therapeutic choice .",

            "problem": "A $78$-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presents after a lacunar infarct consistent with small-vessel disease. He has long-standing hypertension with systolic blood pressure $168$ mm Hg, Type $2$ diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease stage $3b$ with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) $42$ mL/min, and stable coronary artery disease. He denies prior major bleeding. He is not on warfarin and has no International Normalized Ratio (INR) data. He currently takes an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for osteoarthritis and low-dose aspirin, which his neurologist will discontinue if anticoagulation is initiated. He does not consume alcohol.\n\nYou are asked to apply the Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), Elderly, Drugs or alcohol (HAS-BLED) score to estimate his bleeding risk and to balance this against his stroke risk by etiologic category to justify anticoagulation. Use the following assumptions derived from a validated institutional cohort:\n\n1. HAS-BLED scoring follows standard definitions: Hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than $160$ mm Hg) $=1$ point; Abnormal renal or liver function $=1$ point each (maximum $2$); prior Stroke $=1$; Bleeding history or predisposition $=1$; Labile INR $=1$; Elderly (age greater than $65$ years) $=1$; Drugs predisposing to bleeding (antiplatelets or NSAIDs) or alcohol use $=1$ point each (maximum $2$). Compute the patient’s HAS-BLED score $h$.\n\n2. The annual major bleeding risk without anticoagulation predicted by HAS-BLED is given by\n$$\nr_{\\text{bleed}}(h) \\;=\\; 0.005 \\;+\\; 0.005\\,h \\;+\\; 0.002\\,h^{2},\n$$\nexpressed as events per patient-year.\n\n3. The patient’s total annual ischemic stroke risk without anticoagulation is $r_{\\text{stroke,tot}}=0.096$ events per patient-year. Of this risk, $65\\%$ is cardioembolic (embolus from atrial fibrillation), $25\\%$ is small-vessel disease, and $10\\%$ is large-artery thrombotic disease.\n\n4. A Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) reduces the cardioembolic stroke component by $66\\%$ and leaves small-vessel and large-artery thrombotic stroke risks unchanged.\n\n5. Initiation of a DOAC multiplies the patient’s major bleeding risk (relative to no anticoagulation) by $1.30$.\n\n6. For decision-analytic balancing, use quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss weights: each cardioembolic ischemic stroke incurs an average QALY loss of $w_{\\text{emb}}=3.2$, and each major bleed incurs an average QALY loss of $w_{\\text{bleed}}=0.9$.\n\nUsing first principles of expected value, compute the net change in expected QALYs per year with DOAC therapy relative to no anticoagulation, defined as the expected QALYs gained from prevented cardioembolic strokes minus the expected QALYs lost from additional major bleeds attributable to the DOAC. Express the final net change in QALYs per year as a single real number and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not include any unit symbols in your final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in medical decision analysis principles, and provides a well-posed quantitative task with all necessary data and unambiguous definitions.\n\nThe objective is to compute the net change in expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per year when initiating Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy. This is calculated as the expected QALYs gained from preventing ischemic strokes minus the expected QALYs lost from causing additional major bleeds.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the patient's HAS-BLED score, denoted as $h$. According to the provided scoring rules:\n- **H**ypertension (systolic blood pressure $> 160$ mm Hg): The patient's SBP is $168$ mm Hg, which is greater than $160$ mm Hg. This contributes $1$ point.\n- **A**bnormal renal or liver function: The patient has chronic kidney disease stage $3b$ with an eGFR of $42$ mL/min, which constitutes abnormal renal function. This contributes $1$ point. There is no information on liver function.\n- **S**troke: The patient has a history of a lacunar infarct. This contributes $1$ point.\n- **B**leeding history or predisposition: The patient denies prior major bleeding, and no other inherent predisposition is mentioned. This contributes $0$ points.\n- **L**abile INR: The patient is not on warfarin and has no INR data. This contributes $0$ points.\n- **E**lderly (age $> 65$ years): The patient's age is $78$ years, which is greater than $65$ years. This contributes $1$ point.\n- **D**rugs or alcohol: The patient takes an oral NSAID and aspirin. The rule states \"$1$ point each (maximum $2$)\" for \"Drugs predisposing to bleeding (antiplatelets or NSAIDs) or alcohol use\". The use of an antiplatelet (aspirin) and an NSAID falls into the drug category, contributing $1$ point. The patient does not consume alcohol, contributing $0$ points. Thus, this criterion adds a total of $1$ point.\n\nSumming these points gives the total HAS-BLED score:\n$$\nh = 1 (\\text{H}) + 1 (\\text{A}) + 1 (\\text{S}) + 0 (\\text{B}) + 0 (\\text{L}) + 1 (\\text{E}) + 1 (\\text{D}) = 5\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the patient's annual major bleeding risk without anticoagulation, $r_{\\text{bleed}}(h)$, using the provided formula and $h=5$:\n$$\nr_{\\text{bleed}}(h) = 0.005 + 0.005h + 0.002h^{2}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\text{bleed}}(5) = 0.005 + 0.005(5) + 0.002(5)^{2} = 0.005 + 0.025 + 0.002(25) = 0.030 + 0.050 = 0.080 \\text{ events/year}\n$$\nInitiating a DOAC multiplies this risk by a factor of $1.30$. The new bleeding risk is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{bleed, DOAC}} = 1.30 \\times r_{\\text{bleed}}(5) = 1.30 \\times 0.080 = 0.104 \\text{ events/year}\n$$\nThe increase in the annual rate of major bleeding attributable to the DOAC, $\\Delta r_{\\text{bleed}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta r_{\\text{bleed}} = r_{\\text{bleed, DOAC}} - r_{\\text{bleed}}(5) = 0.104 - 0.080 = 0.024 \\text{ events/year}\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the reduction in ischemic stroke risk. The total annual risk without anticoagulation is $r_{\\text{stroke,tot}} = 0.096$. Of this, $65\\%$ is cardioembolic. The baseline annual rate of cardioembolic stroke is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{emb, noAC}} = 0.65 \\times r_{\\text{stroke,tot}} = 0.65 \\times 0.096 = 0.0624 \\text{ events/year}\n$$\nDOAC therapy reduces this cardioembolic component by $66\\%$. The reduction in the annual rate of cardioembolic strokes, $\\Delta r_{\\text{emb}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta r_{\\text{emb}} = 0.66 \\times r_{\\text{emb, noAC}} = 0.66 \\times 0.0624 = 0.041184 \\text{ events/year}\n$$\nThe risks of small-vessel and large-artery stroke are unchanged.\n\nFinally, we compute the net change in expected QALYs per year. The QALY loss for a cardioembolic stroke is $w_{\\text{emb}} = 3.2$, and for a major bleed is $w_{\\text{bleed}} = 0.9$.\n\nThe expected QALYs gained per year is the product of the reduction in cardioembolic stroke rate and the QALY loss per stroke:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{gain}} = \\Delta r_{\\text{emb}} \\times w_{\\text{emb}} = 0.041184 \\times 3.2 = 0.1317888 \\text{ QALYs/year}\n$$\nThe expected QALYs lost per year is the product of the increase in major bleeding rate and the QALY loss per bleed:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{loss}} = \\Delta r_{\\text{bleed}} \\times w_{\\text{bleed}} = 0.024 \\times 0.9 = 0.0216 \\text{ QALYs/year}\n$$\nThe net change in expected QALYs per year, $\\Delta Q_{\\text{net}}$, is the difference between the QALYs gained and the QALYs lost:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta Q_{\\text{gain}} - \\Delta Q_{\\text{loss}} = 0.1317888 - 0.0216 = 0.1101888 \\text{ QALYs/year}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{net}} \\approx 0.1102\n$$\nThis positive value indicates a net benefit from DOAC therapy in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy for this patient.",
