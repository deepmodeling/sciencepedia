The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   A neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel variant is associated with familial epilepsy.\n-   The mutation reduces the single-channel sodium permeability by a factor of $0.60$.\n-   The mutation does not alter ion selectivity or the valence of the charge carrier.\n-   The channel is assumed to be perfectly selective for sodium ions.\n-   Extracellular sodium concentration: $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} = 145$ mM.\n-   Intracellular sodium concentration: $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} = 12$ mM.\n-   Physiological temperature: $T = 310$ K.\n-   The mutation does not alter ionic concentrations.\n-   The charge valence of sodium is $z = +1$.\n-   Principle to use: At reversal potential, the electrochemical potential for sodium is equal across the membrane.\n-   The task is to derive the expression for the sodium reversal potential from first principles and determine the change in this potential compared to wild type.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, drawing upon the fundamental principles of electrochemistry and neurophysiology, specifically the Nernst potential. The provided values for temperature and ionic concentrations are physiologically realistic. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information to determine the reversal potential and asks for a specific, calculable quantity. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe central point of the problem revolves around the distinction between ionic permeability, a kinetic property, and the reversal potential, a thermodynamic property. The problem states that permeability is altered, while the factors determining the thermodynamic equilibrium (concentrations, temperature, charge) are not. This setup is self-consistent and tests a crucial concept in biophysics. The problem is not flawed; it is a valid and well-formulated scientific question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires deriving the expression for the sodium reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, from the first principle that at equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of an ion is equal on both sides of the membrane.\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$, for an ionic species $S$ is given by the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S}^{0} + RT \\ln(a_S) + zFV\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{S}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_S$ is the chemical activity of the species (approximated by its concentration $[S]$), $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential of the compartment.\n\nAt the reversal potential, the net flow of sodium ions is zero. This occurs when the electrochemical potential for sodium inside the cell, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, i}$, is equal to the electrochemical potential for sodium outside the cell, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, o}$.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, o}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential for both compartments:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) + zFV_{i} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) + zFV_{o}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential term, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0}$, is identical on both sides and cancels out. The valence for sodium is $z=+1$.\n$$\nRT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) + FV_{i} = RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) + FV_{o}\n$$\nWe are interested in the potential difference across the membrane, which is defined as the membrane potential, $V_m = V_i - V_o$. The reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is the specific membrane potential at which this equilibrium occurs. Rearranging the equation to solve for $V_i - V_o$:\n$$\nF(V_i - V_o) = RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) - RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i})\n$$\n$$\nF E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = RT \\left( \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) - \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n$$\nF E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ (which for sodium is denoted $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), we obtain the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}} \\right)\n$$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must determine the change in this reversal potential due to the mutation. The Nernst equation shows that the reversal potential is a function of the temperature $T$, ion concentrations $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}$ and $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}$, and the ion's valence $z$. $R$ and $F$ are fundamental physical constants.\n\nThe problem states that the mutation:\n1.  Reduces sodium permeability by a factor of $0.60$.\n2.  Does **not** alter ion selectivity.\n3.  Does **not** alter the valence of the charge carrier ($z=+1$).\n4.  Does **not** alter the ionic concentrations ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} = 145$ mM, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} = 12$ mM).\n5.  The temperature remains constant ($T = 310$ K).\n\nIonic permeability, denoted $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is a kinetic parameter that quantifies the rate at which ions can pass through the channel. It is a factor in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) *current* equation, which describes the magnitude of the ionic current as a function of membrane voltage. However, permeability does not appear in the Nernst equation. The Nernst potential is a thermodynamic quantity representing the equilibrium state, which is independent of the rate at which that equilibrium is reached.\n\nSince the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ depends only on $T$, $z$, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}$, and $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}$, and none of these parameters are affected by the mutation, the reversal potential of the mutant channel, $E_{\\mathrm{mutant}}$, is identical to that of the wild-type channel, $E_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{145}{12} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{mutant}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{145}{12} \\right)\n$$\nThe change in the reversal potential, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = E_{\\mathrm{mutant}} - E_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0\n$$\nThe reduction in permeability will decrease the magnitude of the sodium current for any given driving force ($V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), but it will not shift the voltage at which the net current becomes zero. Therefore, the expected change in the channel's reversal potential is $0$ mV.",

Consider a sodium channelopathy relevant to epilepsy and migraine that selectively increases the sodium inactivation time constant $\\tau_h(V)$ by a factor $\\alpha > 1$ in the depolarized voltage range traversed during the action potential (AP) upstroke and plateau, but leaves $m_{\\infty}(V), h_{\\infty}(V), \\tau_m(V)$, and all potassium and leak channel properties unchanged. Assume the activation variable $m$ is fast compared to $h$ during the AP plateau (i.e., $\\tau_m(V) \\ll \\tau_h(V)$ for depolarized $V$), so that $m(t) \\approx m_{\\infty}(V(t))$ on these timescales. During the AP plateau, suppose the voltage is approximately quasi-stationary at $V \\approx V_p$ for a short interval while $h$ relaxes toward $h_{\\infty}(V_p)$.\n\nUsing only the above HH definitions and standard fast–slow reasoning, address the following. First, derive the time course of $h(t)$ during the AP plateau at $V \\approx V_p$ and use it to express the time at which repolarization begins in terms of a critical inactivation level $h_c$ defined implicitly by the balance condition $\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\, m_{\\infty}^3(V_p)\\, h_c\\, (V_p - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) = I_{\\mathrm{out}}(V_p)$, where $I_{\\mathrm{out}}(V_p) := \\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\, n_{\\infty}^4(V_p)\\, (V_p - E_{\\mathrm{K}}) + \\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\, (V_p - E_{\\mathrm{L}})$ collects outward currents that are approximately stationary at $V_p$. Then, reason about how increasing $\\tau_h(V_p)$ by $\\alpha$ modifies the AP duration and the likelihood of burst firing under constant injected current $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ through the creation of a slow variable that modulates excitability over multiple spikes.\n\nWhich statement is most consistent with this derivation?\n\nA. Increasing $\\tau_h$ at depolarized voltages prolongs the time required for $h$ to reach $h_c$, making AP duration scale approximately linearly with $\\tau_h$, and can promote burst firing by establishing a slow inactivation variable that sustains multiple spikes before repolarization terminates the active phase.\n\nB. Increasing $\\tau_h$ reduces sodium availability during the AP upstroke, thereby decreasing AP amplitude and shortening AP duration, which suppresses bursting.\n\nC. Increasing $\\tau_h$ shifts $h_{\\infty}(V)$ to larger values, increasing the steady-state sodium window current at rest and favoring tonic spiking rather than bursting, with negligible effect on AP duration.\n\nD. Increasing $\\tau_h$ accelerates repolarization by enhancing delayed rectifier potassium activation through the voltage dependence of $n_{\\infty}(V)$, thereby reducing AP duration and suppressing burst firing.\n\nE.

The scenario of a channelopathy affecting ion channel kinetics is a standard and clinically relevant topic. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient equations, assumptions, and definitions to proceed with a derivation. The language is objective and technical.\n\nHowever, there is a significant sign error in the supplied implicit definition of $h_c$. The left-hand side, representing the sodium current $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is negative because during the action potential plateau, $V_p  E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. The right-hand side, representing the sum of potassium and leak outward currents $I_{\\mathrm{out}}$, is positive because $V_p > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and typically $V_p > E_{\\mathrm{L}}$. A negative number cannot equal a positive number.\n\nThe biophysically correct balance condition at the plateau (where $dV/dt \\approx 0$) is that the total inward current balances the total outward current. From the primary equation, $C \\frac{dV}{dt} = 0 \\approx (-I_{\\mathrm{Na}}) - (I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}) + I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. The critical point for repolarization is where the intrinsic membrane currents are at a threshold balance, which is properly expressed as $-I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (ignoring $I_{ext}$ as implied by the definition of $I_{out}$). This corresponds to the condition:\n$-\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\, m_{\\infty}^3(V_p)\\, h_c\\, (V_p - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) = I_{\\mathrm{out}}(V_p)$.\n\nThis error is a typo in a definitional equation that does not undermine the conceptual structure or the solvability of the problem. The essential point is that a critical value $h_c$ exists and is determined by parameters that are independent of $\\tau_h$. Therefore, I will proceed by adopting the physically correct version of the balance condition. The problem is deemed valid, with this noted correction.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n**Derivation of AP Plateau Duration**\n\nThe problem asks for the time course of the sodium inactivation variable, $h(t)$, during the action potential (AP) plateau. The governing equation is:\n$$\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty}(V) - h}{\\tau_h(V)}$$\nUnder the assumption that the voltage is quasi-stationary at $V \\approx V_p$ during the plateau, this becomes a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty}(V_p) - h}{\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\nWe solve this equation with an initial condition $h(0) = h_0$, where $t=0$ is the beginning of the plateau phase and $h_0$ is the value of the inactivation gate at that time. The solution is a relaxation to the steady-state value $h_{\\infty}(V_p)$:\n$$h(t) = h_{\\infty}(V_p) + (h_0 - h_{\\infty}(V_p)) e^{-t/\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\nFor a depolarized plateau voltage $V_p$, the steady-state inactivation $h_{\\infty}(V_p)$ is typically very close to $0$. Thus, we can approximate the time course as a simple exponential decay:\n$$h(t) \\approx h_0 \\, e^{-t/\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\nRepolarization begins at a time $t_{rep}$ when $h(t)$ falls to a critical value $h_c$. We set $h(t_{rep}) = h_c$:\n$$h_c \\approx h_0 \\, e^{-t_{rep}/\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\nSolving for $t_{rep}$, which represents the duration of the AP plateau, we get:\n$$\\frac{h_c}{h_0} \\approx e^{-t_{rep}/\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{h_c}{h_0}\\right) \\approx -\\frac{t_{rep}}{\\tau_h(V_p)}$$\n$$t_{rep} \\approx -\\tau_h(V_p) \\ln\\left(\\frac{h_c}{h_0}\\right) = \\tau_h(V_p) \\ln\\left(\\frac{h_0}{h_c}\\right)$$\nSince inactivation progresses during the plateau, $h_0 > h_c$, ensuring $t_{rep} > 0$.\n\n**Effect of the Channelopathy**\n\nThe channelopathy increases $\\tau_h(V_p)$ by a factor $\\alpha > 1$. Let the new time constant be $\\tau_h'(V_p) = \\alpha \\, \\tau_h(V_p)$. According to the problem statement, all other parameters determining $h_0$ and $h_c$ (specifically $m_{\\infty}(V)$, $n_{\\infty}(V)$, conductances, and reversal potentials) are unchanged. Therefore, the new plateau duration $t_{rep}'$ is:\n$$t_{rep}' \\approx \\tau_h'(V_p) \\ln\\left(\\frac{h_0}{h_c}\\right) = \\alpha \\left[ \\tau_h(V_p) \\ln\\left(\\frac{h_0}{h_c}\\right) \\right] = \\alpha \\, t_{rep}$$\nThis shows that increasing the inactivation time constant $\\tau_h$ at depolarized voltages leads to a proportional, approximately linear, increase in the duration of the action potential.\n\n**Effect on Burst Firing**\n\nBurst firing is characterized by a group of spikes occurring on top of a prolonged depolarizing envelope, followed by a period of quiescence. The dynamics of such patterns are often governed by a slow process that modulates the faster spiking activity.\nIn this modified HH model, the inactivation gate $h$ becomes a very slow variable due to the increased $\\tau_h$. Its slow decay during depolarization determines the duration of the active, spiking phase (the burst). As $h$ slowly decreases, the available sodium current for sustaining spikes diminishes. Once $h$ drops below a certain level, spiking can no longer be supported, the plateau terminates, and the neuron repolarizes, entering the quiescent phase. During this silence, $h$ slowly recovers (de-inactivates), priming the neuron for the next burst.\nBy making $h$ a slow variable, the mutation promotes the separation of timescales necessary for this type of bursting. The prolonged AP duration becomes the depolarizing envelope upon which multiple spikes can potentially be generated.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Increasing $\\tau_h$ at depolarized voltages prolongs the time required for $h$ to reach $h_c$, making AP duration scale approximately linearly with $\\tau_h$, and can promote burst firing by establishing a slow inactivation variable that sustains multiple spikes before repolarization terminates the active phase.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The time to reach $h_c$ is $t_{rep}$, which we found to be approximately proportional to $\\tau_h$. This prolongs the AP duration. The slowing of the $h$ variable establishes the slow timescale required for burst modulation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Increasing $\\tau_h$ reduces sodium availability during the AP upstroke, thereby decreasing AP amplitude and shortening AP duration, which suppresses bursting.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Increasing $\\tau_h$ signifies *slower* inactivation. During the finite time of the AP upstroke, less inactivation will occur, meaning $h$ will be larger at any given time compared to the normal case. This *increases* sodium current availability, which would tend to prolong, not shorten, the AP.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increasing $\\tau_h$ shifts $h_{\\infty}(V)$ to larger values, increasing the steady-state sodium window current at rest and favoring tonic spiking rather than bursting, with negligible effect on AP duration.**\n    This statement contradicts the problem's explicit condition that $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is unchanged. The mutation only affects the time constant $\\tau_h(V)$. Furthermore, our derivation shows a significant, not negligible, effect on AP duration.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Increasing $\\tau_h$ accelerates repolarization by enhancing delayed rectifier potassium activation through the voltage dependence of $n_{\\infty}(V)$, thereby reducing AP duration and suppressing burst firing.**\n    This statement misrepresents the primary effect. The direct effect of increasing $\\tau_h$ is on $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and it *delays* repolarization by sustaining inward current. Any secondary effect on $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ activation is a consequence of the prolonged depolarization, not a cause of accelerated repolarization. The conclusion that AP duration is reduced is the opposite of what occurs.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Increasing $\\tau_h$ affects only the refractory period between spikes and does not significantly impact the AP waveform or spiking pattern under constant current injection.**\n    This statement is incorrect. As shown by the derivation $t_{rep} \\propto \\tau_h$, the AP duration, a key feature of the waveform, is significantly impacted. This profound change in AP shape is very likely to alter the spiking pattern, for instance, by promoting bursting. The effect is not confined to the refractory period.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

For $n$ such synapses, the total event frequency is:\n$$F = n \\cdot r \\cdot u$$\n\nThe total expected synaptic current, $I$, is then the product of the total event frequency, $F$, and the mean amplitude of a single postsynaptic current, $A$:\n$$I = F \\cdot A = n \\cdot r \\cdot u \\cdot A$$\n\nThe Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) ratio is defined as the ratio of the total expected excitatory current ($I_E$) to the total expected inhibitory current ($I_I$):\n$$\\text{E/I Ratio} = \\frac{I_E}{I_I} = \\frac{n_E \\cdot r_E \\cdot u_E \\cdot A_E}{n_I \\cdot r_I \\cdot u_I \\cdot A_I}$$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected excitatory and inhibitory currents using the baseline parameters.\nThe given baseline parameters are:\nFor excitation:\n$n_E = 50$\n$r_E = 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$u_E = 0.2$\n$A_E = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\nFor inhibition:\n$n_I = 20$\n$r_I = 20\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$u_I = 0.5$\n$A_I = 50\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\nThe total expected excitatory current, $I_E$, is:\n$$I_E = n_E \\cdot r_E \\cdot u_E \\cdot A_E = 50 \\cdot (4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot (20\\,\\mathrm{pA}) = 800\\,\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem states that a SCN1A loss-of-function mutation halves the firing rate of the fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, which provide the inhibition. All other parameters remain unchanged.\nThe new inhibitory firing rate, $r'_I$, is:\n$$r'_I = \\frac{1}{2} r_I = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (20\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two quantities: the new IPSC event frequency and the new E/I ratio.\n\nFirst, we compute the new total Inhibitory Postsynaptic Current (IPSC) event frequency, $F'_I$. This is calculated using the new inhibitory firing rate $r'_I$:\n$$F'_I = n_I \\cdot r'_I \\cdot u_I = 20 \\cdot (10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot 0.5 = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nNext, we compute the new E/I ratio. To do this, we need the new total expected inhibitory current, $I'_I$, and the total expected excitatory current, $I'_E$.\nThe new inhibitory current is:\n$$I'_I = n_I \\cdot r'_I \\cdot u_I \\cdot A_I = 20 \\cdot (10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (50\\,\\mathrm{pA}) = 5000\\,\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe excitatory parameters are unchanged, so the total expected excitatory current remains the same as the baseline value:\n$$I'_E = I_E = 800\\,\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe new E/I ratio is the ratio of the new excitatory current to the new inhibitory current:\n$$\\text{E/I Ratio}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{I'_E}{I'_I} = \\frac{800\\,\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5000\\,\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}$$\nThe units cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless ratio.\n$$\\text{E/I Ratio}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{800}{5000} = \\frac{8}{50} = \\frac{4}{25} = 0.16$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.16$ expressed with four significant figures is $0.1600$.\nThe SCN1A loss-of-function mutation, by reducing the FS interneuron firing rate, leads to a state of disinhibition where the E/I ratio doubles from its baseline value of $\\frac{800}{10000} = 0.08$ to $0.1600$, consistent with a hyperexcitable state that can underlie epileptogenesis.",
