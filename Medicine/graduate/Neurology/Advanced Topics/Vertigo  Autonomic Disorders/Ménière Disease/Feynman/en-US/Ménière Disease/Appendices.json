            "introduction": "A cornerstone of vestibular function is the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), which stabilizes gaze during head movements. In Ménière's disease, labyrinthine damage can impair this reflex, leading to vertigo and oscillopsia. This exercise () challenges you to derive the expression for VOR gain from the first principle of gaze stabilization and then calculate its value from clinical data, providing a direct link between fundamental neurophysiology and a critical diagnostic measurement obtained from the video head impulse test (vHIT).",

            "problem": "A patient with a confirmed diagnosis of Ménière's disease undergoes quantitative assessment of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) using a video head impulse test (vHIT). During a rightward head impulse, the recorded peak head angular velocity is $60\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ and the simultaneously recorded peak compensatory eye angular velocity is $40\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ in the opposite direction. Assume that the peaks are temporally aligned, saccades are absent, and that the goal of the VOR is to minimize retinal slip so that the net image motion on the retina is zero at the moment of peak response.\n\nStarting from the fundamental objective of gaze stabilization (zero retinal slip), derive an expression that defines the VOR gain in terms of eye and head angular velocities, and then compute its value for the measured traces. Report the VOR gain as a unitless ratio rounded to three significant figures. After computing the value, provide a principled interpretation of whether this value is consistent with normal vestibular function or with peripheral vestibular hypofunction typically observed in Ménière's disease.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is based on established principles of vestibular neuroscience and clinical diagnostics. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe process to solve this problem involves three steps:\n1.  Derive the expression for the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) gain from the fundamental principle of gaze stabilization.\n2.  Calculate the numerical value of the VOR gain using the provided data.\n3.  Interpret the calculated gain in the clinical context of normal function versus vestibular hypofunction associated with Ménière's disease.\n\n**1. Derivation of the VOR Gain Expression**\n\nThe primary objective of the VOR is to stabilize the image of the external world on the retina during head movements. This is achieved by generating an eye movement that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the head movement. When gaze is stable, the net angular velocity of the eye with respect to a stationary, inertial frame of reference (i.e., the world) is zero.\n\nLet us define the relevant angular velocities:\n- $\\omega_{head}$: The angular velocity of the head with respect to the stationary world.\n- $\\omega_{eye}$: The angular velocity of the eye with respect to the head. This is the compensatory movement generated by the VOR.\n- $\\omega_{gaze}$: The angular velocity of the eye with respect to the stationary world, also known as gaze velocity.\n\nThe relationship between these quantities is given by the vector addition of angular velocities:\n$$ \\omega_{gaze} = \\omega_{head} + \\omega_{eye} $$\n\nThe condition for perfect gaze stabilization is that the gaze velocity is zero, which corresponds to zero retinal slip for a stationary target.\n$$ \\omega_{gaze} = 0 $$\n\nSubstituting this ideal condition into the first equation yields:\n$$ 0 = \\omega_{head} + \\omega_{eye} $$\nThis implies that for perfect stabilization, the compensatory eye movement must be:\n$$ \\omega_{eye} = -\\omega_{head} $$\nThe VOR gain, denoted by $g_{VOR}$, is a dimensionless measure that quantifies the effectiveness of the reflex. It is defined as the ratio of the output (compensatory eye velocity) to the input (head velocity). To ensure the gain is a positive number for a normal compensatory response (where eye and head velocities have opposite signs), it is conventionally defined with a negative sign:\n$$ g_{VOR} = -\\frac{\\omega_{eye}}{\\omega_{head}} $$\nIn a clinical setting, such as with a video head impulse test (vHIT), the gain is calculated using the peak velocities measured during the head impulse. If we denote the peak eye angular velocity as $\\omega_{eye, peak}$ and the peak head angular velocity as $\\omega_{head, peak}$, the expression for the gain is:\n$$ g_{VOR} = -\\frac{\\omega_{eye, peak}}{\\omega_{head, peak}} $$\nFor a perfect VOR, where $\\omega_{eye, peak} = -\\omega_{head, peak}$, the gain $g_{VOR}$ would be exactly $1$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the VOR Gain**\n\nThe problem provides the following data from the vHIT:\n- Peak head angular velocity: $60\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ during a rightward impulse.\n- Peak compensatory eye angular velocity: $40\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ in the opposite direction.\n\nLet us establish a sign convention. We define the rightward direction as positive. Therefore:\n- The peak head angular velocity is $\\omega_{head, peak} = +60\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\n- The peak eye angular velocity, being in the opposite (leftward) direction, is $\\omega_{eye, peak} = -40\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\n\nUsing the derived expression for the VOR gain:\n$$ g_{VOR} = -\\frac{\\omega_{eye, peak}}{\\omega_{head, peak}} = -\\frac{-40\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}}{+60\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{deg/s}$ cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio:\n$$ g_{VOR} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe problem requires the value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ g_{VOR} \\approx 0.6666... $$\n$$ g_{VOR} \\approx 0.667 $$\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Result**\n\nA VOR gain of $1.0$ represents a perfect compensatory response, where eye velocity perfectly matches head velocity, resulting in complete gaze stability. In healthy individuals, the VOR gain measured by vHIT is typically very close to $1.0$, with a normal range often cited as being between approximately $0.8$ and $1.2$.\n\nThe calculated VOR gain for this patient is $0.667$. This value is substantially less than $1.0$ and falls well below the normal range. A gain of this magnitude indicates that the compensatory eye movement is too slow for the head movement; the eye velocity is only about $67\\%$ of what is required to maintain stable gaze. This deficiency is termed vestibular hypofunction.\n\nMénière's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that damages the vestibular labyrinth, which is responsible for sensing head motion. This damage leads to a reduced ability of the affected ear to signal head velocity to the brainstem, resulting in peripheral vestibular hypofunction. A vHIT impulse directed toward the side of the lesion (in this case, a rightward impulse testing the right horizontal semicircular canal) will reveal a low VOR gain.\n\nTherefore, the calculated VOR gain of $0.667$ is not consistent with normal vestibular function. Instead, it is a clear quantitative sign of right-sided peripheral vestibular hypofunction, a finding that is highly consistent with the patient's confirmed diagnosis of Ménière's disease affecting the right ear.",

            "introduction": "While Ménière's disease is defined by its clinical syndrome, ancillary tests can provide objective support for its presumed pathophysiology—endolymphatic hydrops. Electrocochleography (ECochG) directly measures the electrical potentials generated by the cochlea and auditory nerve.

A dimensionless quantity can be formed from two quantities that share the same physical dimensions by taking their ratio. The problem describes an index used for hydrops screening, constructed by \"comparing the magnitude of the sustained component to the magnitude of the onset component\".\n\nLet $A_{SP}$ denote the amplitude of the summating potential, which is the sustained hair-cell-related component.\nLet $A_{AP}$ denote the amplitude of the compound action potential, which is the onset neural response component.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the amplitudes are given as:\n$A_{SP} = 0.6 \\text{ mV}$\n$A_{AP} = 1.2 \\text{ mV}$\n\nThe dimensionless index, let us call it $I$, is formed by the comparison of $A_{SP}$ to $A_{AP}$. In the context of signal analysis and clinical diagnostics, this comparison is conventionally a ratio. This specific ratio, $A_{SP} / A_{AP}$, is the standard metric used in ECochG for diagnosing endolymphatic hydrops.\n\nTherefore, the index $I$ is defined as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{A_{SP}}{A_{AP}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$\nI = \\frac{0.6}{1.2}\n$$\n\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\nI = 0.5\n$$\n\nThe problem requires a discussion of this result in the context of a given clinical threshold. The decision threshold, $T$, is provided as $T = 0.4$. An elevated index is indicative of endolymphatic hydrops. The condition for a positive screening is $I > T$. In this case, our computed value is $I = 0.5$, which satisfies the condition:\n$$\n0.5 > 0.4\n$$\nTherefore, the calculated index supports the presence of endolymphatic hydrops.\n\nThe final step is to prepare the answer according to the specified formatting. The problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value of the index is $0.5$.
