The doses and routes of administration are consistent with high-dose regimens used in clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined, providing all necessary numerical values (dose, frequency, time duration) and explicit definitions (TID means three times daily, BID means twice daily) required for a unique and stable solution. Assumptions are clearly stated to remove ambiguity.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It requests a calculation based on the provided data and principles, without involving subjective interpretation.\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total cumulative dose for two thiamine administration protocols, A and B, over a $72$-hour period and then find the ratio of these total doses.\n\nLet $D_A$ and $D_B$ represent the total cumulative doses for Protocol A and Protocol B, respectively.\nLet $d_A$ and $d_B$ be the dose per administration for each protocol.\nLet $f_A$ and $f_B$ be the administration frequencies (administrations per day) for each protocol.\nLet $T$ be the total time window, which is given as $72$ hours.\n\nThe total number of administrations, $N$, over the time window is the product of the daily frequency and the duration of the window in days. The number of days is calculated by dividing the total hours by the number of hours in a day ($24$).\n$$ \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{T}{24 \\text{ hours/day}} = \\frac{72 \\text{ hours}}{24 \\text{ hours/day}} = 3 \\text{ days} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of administrations for each protocol.\nFor Protocol A, the dose per administration is $d_A = 500$ mg, and the frequency is ter in die (TID), so $f_A = 3$ administrations per day.\nThe total number of administrations for Protocol A, $N_A$, is:\n$$ N_A = f_A \\times (\\text{Number of days}) = 3 \\text{ day}^{-1} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 $$\n\nFor Protocol B, the dose per administration is $d_B = 200$ mg, and the frequency is bis in die (BID), so $f_B = 2$ administrations per day.\nThe total number of administrations for Protocol B, $N_B$, is:\n$$ N_B = f_B \\times (\\text{Number of days}) = 2 \\text{ day}^{-1} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 6 $$\n\nNext, we apply the given principle to calculate the total cumulative dose for each protocol.\nThe total dose is the product of the dose per administration and the total number of administrations.\n\nTotal dose for Protocol A:\n$$ D_A = d_A \\times N_A = 500 \\text{ mg} \\times 9 = 4500 \\text{ mg} $$\n\nTotal dose for Protocol B:\n$$ D_B = d_B \\times N_B = 200 \\text{ mg} \\times 6 = 1200 \\text{ mg} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required unitless ratio, $R$, of Protocol A's total dose to Protocol B's total dose.\n$$ R = \\frac{D_A}{D_B} = \\frac{4500 \\text{ mg}}{1200 \\text{ mg}} $$\nThe units (mg) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity as required.\n$$ R = \\frac{4500}{1200} = \\frac{45}{12} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$.\n$$ R = \\frac{45 \\div 3}{12 \\div 3} = \\frac{15}{4} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal value gives:\n$$ R = 3.75 $$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $3.75$ has three significant figures. To express this value with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$ R = 3.750 $$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of thiamine in a patient based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, and then to calculate its numerical value given specific parameters. The process begins by establishing the governing differential equation for the amount of thiamine in the body, $A(t)$.\n\nThe model assumes linear, first-order elimination. For the purpose of calculating the half-life, we consider the system after drug administration has ceased, so the rate of change of the amount of thiamine in the body, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is solely due to elimination.\nThe rate of change is thus the negative of the rate of elimination:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - (\\text{rate of elimination})\n$$\nThe problem provides the definition of clearance, $\\mathrm{Cl}$, as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cl} = \\frac{\\text{rate of elimination}}{C(t)}\n$$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the plasma concentration. This definition can be rearranged to express the rate of elimination:\n$$\n\\text{rate of elimination} = \\mathrm{Cl} \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThe problem also defines the relationship between the amount of substance $A(t)$, the concentration $C(t)$, and the volume of distribution, $V_d$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V_d}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C(t)$ into the equation for the rate of elimination yields:\n$$\n\\text{rate of elimination} = \\mathrm{Cl} \\cdot \\frac{A(t)}{V_d}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the initial differential equation describing the change in $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Cl}}{V_d} \\right) A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The term $\\frac{\\mathrm{Cl}}{V_d}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, which we will denote as $k_e$.\n$$\nk_e = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cl}}{V_d}\n$$\nThe differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_e A(t)\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{A} = -k_e dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides, with the initial condition $A(t=0) = A_0$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} dA' = \\int_0^t -k_e dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(A')]_{A_0}^{A(t)} = [-k_e t']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A_0) = -k_e t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A_0}\\right) = -k_e t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $A(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of substance to decrease to one-half of its initial value. That is, $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the solution:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $A_0$ (assuming $A_0 > 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the elimination rate constant, $k_e = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cl}}{V_d}$, back into the equation for the half-life. This provides the desired analytical expression for $t_{1/2}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Cl}$ and $V_d$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mathrm{Cl} / V_d} = \\frac{V_d \\ln(2)}{\\mathrm{Cl}}\n$$\nWith the analytical expression derived, we now compute the numerical value.

Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the post-test probability of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) given a positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) finding. This is a problem in conditional probability that can be solved using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events based on the problem statement:\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Wernicke encephalopathy.\nLet $T$ be the event that the MRI test is positive, showing the characteristic hyperintensities.\nThe complementary events are $D^c$ (the patient does not have WE) and $T^c$ (the MRI test is negative).\n\nNext, we formalize the given information using probabilistic notation:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prior probability, of the patient having WE is given as $P(D) = 0.25$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the MRI test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is written as $P(T|D) = 0.53$.\n3.  The specificity of the MRI test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is written as $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.93$.\n\nThe quantity to be computed is the post-test probability of WE given a positive MRI finding. This is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for this specific clinical context.\n\nBayes' theorem provides the mathematical framework for this calculation. It states:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(T|D) P(D)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. The denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result, regardless of the patient's true disease status.\n\nTo calculate $P(T)$, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive).\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe have the values for $P(T|D)$ and $P(D)$. We need to determine $P(D^c)$ and $P(T|D^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having WE is the complement of having WE:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\n\nThe probability of a positive test given the absence of WE, $P(T|D^c)$, is known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^c|D^c)$:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$$\n\nNow we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = (P(T|D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T|D^c) \\times P(D^c))$$\n$$P(T) = (0.53 \\times 0.25) + (0.07 \\times 0.75)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.1325 + 0.0525$$\n$$P(T) = 0.1850$$\n\nWith all components calculated, we can now find the post-test probability $P(D|T)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.1325}{0.1850}$$\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.716216216...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.7162$$\nThus, the probability of the patient having Wernicke encephalopathy given the positive MRI finding is approximately $0.7162$.",
