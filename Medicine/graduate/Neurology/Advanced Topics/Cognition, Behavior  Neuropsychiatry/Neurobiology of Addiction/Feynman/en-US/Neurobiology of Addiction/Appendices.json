This first exercise builds a quantitative bridge from pharmacology to subjective experience using a simplified model of opioid action. By applying principles of receptor theory and pharmacokinetics, you will calculate the plasma concentration of two hypothetical drugs required to achieve a \"euphoria threshold,\" providing a hands-on understanding of how a drug's affinity ($K_D$) and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier determine its potency and abuse liability .",

The occupancy function $\\theta([L]) = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}}$ is strictly increasing in $[L]$ for $[L] \\geq 0$ and fixed $K_{D}  0$.
