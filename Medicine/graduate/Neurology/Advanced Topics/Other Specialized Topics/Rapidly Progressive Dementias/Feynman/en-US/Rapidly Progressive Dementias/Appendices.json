The pretest probability of the disease, which is the clinician's initial assessment of the likelihood of the disease before testing. This is the prior probability, $P(D) = 0.20$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is a conditional probability, $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.92$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. Let $-$ denote a negative test result.

This exercise  builds upon foundational Bayesian reasoning by introducing likelihood ratios, an elegant and powerful tool for sequentially updating diagnostic certainty.

            "problem": "A patient with rapidly progressive dementia is being evaluated for prion disease. In a tertiary referral population with rapidly progressive dementia, the pretest probability of prion disease is $0.20$. Two diagnostic modalities are obtained: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) evaluating cortical ribboning, and Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) performed on cerebrospinal fluid. For MRI DWI cortical ribboning, the sensitivity is $0.80$ and the specificity is $0.90$. For RT-QuIC, the sensitivity is $0.92$ and the specificity is $0.99$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian statistics and medical diagnostics, is well-posed with all necessary data and a clear objective, and is free from any subjective or contradictory elements. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has prion disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $M_+$ denote a positive result on the MRI DWI test, and $Q_+$ denote a positive result on the RT-QuIC test. The problem provides the following probabilities:\n\nThe pre-test probability of prion disease:\n$P(D) = 0.20$\nThe pre-test probability of not having the disease is therefore:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n\nFor the MRI test:\nSensitivity: $P(M_+ | D) = 0.80$\nSpecificity: $P(M_- | D^c) = 0.90$\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive MRI in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate):\n$P(M_+ | D^c) = 1 - P(M_- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$\n\nFor the RT-QuIC test:\nSensitivity: $P(Q_+ | D) = 0.92$\nSpecificity: $P(Q_- | D^c) = 0.99$\nFrom this specificity, the false positive rate for RT-QuIC is:\n$P(Q_+ | D^c) = 1 - P(Q_- | D^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of disease given that both tests are positive, which is denoted by $P(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$ P(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+) = \\frac{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D) P(D)}{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(M_+ \\cap Q_+)$, is the total probability of observing two positive tests, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(M_+ \\cap Q_+) = P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D) P(D) + P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' formula gives:\n$$ P(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+) = \\frac{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D) P(D)}{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D) P(D) + P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nThe problem states that the tests are conditionally independent given the disease status. This means the probability of joint events can be calculated as the product of their individual probabilities, conditioned on the same state:\n$P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D) = P(M_+ | D) \\times P(Q_+ | D)$\n$P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D^c) = P(M_+ | D^c) \\times P(Q_+ | D^c)$\n\nWhile we could substitute all values directly into this formula, the prompt requires us to use the concept of likelihood ratios. The odds form of Bayes' theorem provides the most direct way to incorporate likelihood ratios.\n\nThe pre-test odds of disease are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} $$\nThe post-test odds are similarly defined:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D | E) = \\frac{P(D | E)}{P(D^c | E)} $$\nwhere $E$ represents the evidence from the test results. Using the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{P(D | E)}{P(D^c | E)} = \\frac{P(E | D) P(D) / P(E)}{P(E | D^c) P(D^c) / P(E)} = \\left(\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)}$ is the likelihood ratio ($LR$) of the evidence $E$. Thus, we arrive at the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{Post-test Odds} = \\text{Likelihood Ratio} \\times \\text{Pre-test Odds} $$\nFor a positive test result ($T_+$), the likelihood ratio, $LR_+$, is defined as the ratio of sensitivity to the false positive rate:\n$$ LR_+ = \\frac{P(T_+|D)}{P(T_+|D^c)} = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{specificity}} $$\nLet's calculate the likelihood ratios for a positive result for each test.\nFor the MRI:\n$$ LR_{M_+} = \\frac{P(M_+|D)}{P(M_+|D^c)} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10} = 8 $$\nFor the RT-QuIC:\n$$ LR_{Q_+} = \\frac{P(Q_+|D)}{P(Q_+|D^c)} = \\frac{0.92}{0.01} = 92 $$\nThe justification for combining results from two conditionally independent tests is that the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios. Let the combined evidence be $E = M_+ \\cap Q_+$. The combined likelihood ratio is:\n$$ LR_{comb} = \\frac{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D)}{P(M_+ \\cap Q_+ | D^c)} $$\nUsing the conditional independence assumption:\n$$ LR_{comb} = \\frac{P(M_+|D) P(Q_+|D)}{P(M_+|D^c) P(Q_+|D^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(M_+|D)}{P(M_+|D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(Q_+|D)}{P(Q_+|D^c)}\\right) = LR_{M_+} \\times LR_{Q_+} $$\nNow we can compute the post-test probability. First, we calculate the pre-test odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25 $$\nNext, we calculate the combined likelihood ratio for two positive tests:\n$$ LR_{comb} = LR_{M_+} \\times LR_{Q_+} = 8 \\times 92 = 736 $$\nNow, we find the post-test odds using the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR_{comb} = 0.25 \\times 736 = 184 $$\nFinally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds is $\\text{Odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$, which can be rearranged to solve for $p$: $p = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}$.\n$$ P(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(D | M_+ \\cap Q_+)} = \\frac{184}{1 + 184} = \\frac{184}{185} $$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ \\frac{184}{185} \\approx 0.99459459... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.9946$.",

For each rule, we must calculate two metrics:\n1.  **Sensitivity for sCJD ($\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}}$):** The probability that the rule classifies a patient as having sCJD, given that the patient truly has sCJD. $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = P(\\text{Rule positive} | \\mathrm{sCJD})$.\n2.  **False Attribution Probability ($\\mathrm{FAP}$):** The probability that the rule classifies a patient as having sCJD, given that the patient has a non-prion disease. This is the false positive rate.\n    $\\mathrm{FAP} = P(\\text{Rule positive} | \\text{non-sCJD})$.\n    This can be calculated by applying the law of total probability over the non-sCJD population:\n    $$ \\mathrm{FAP} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{stroke, enceph, tumor, other}\\}} P(\\text{Rule positive} | D_i) \\times p_i}{\\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{stroke, enceph, tumor, other}\\}} p_i} $$\n    The denominator is $p_{\\mathrm{non-sCJD}} = 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.30 = 0.75$.\n\nAn acceptable rule must have $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} \\ge 0.80$ and $\\mathrm{FAP} < 0.05$.\n\n#### Evaluation of Rule A\n**Rule A:** Diagnose sCJD if CSF 14-3-3 is positive ($T_{1433}$) OR CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ ($T_{\\mathrm{tau}}$).\nThe rule is $R_A = T_{1433} \\lor T_{\\mathrm{tau}}$.\nThe probability is $P(R_A|D) = P(T_{1433}|D) + P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D) - P(T_{1433} \\cap T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D)$.\nAssuming conditional independence, $P(R_A|D) = P(T_{1433}|D) + P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D) - P(T_{1433}|D)P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D)$.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity for Rule A:**\n    $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = P(R_A | \\mathrm{sCJD}) = 0.90 + 0.85 - (0.90 \\times 0.85) = 1.75 - 0.765 = 0.985$.\n    This satisfies the sensitivity criterion ($0.985 \\ge 0.80$).\n\n2.  **False Attribution Probability for Rule A:**\n    First, we calculate $P(R_A|D)$ for each non-sCJD category:\n    - $P(R_A|\\text{stroke}) = 0.60 + 0.25 - (0.60 \\times 0.25) = 0.85 - 0.15 = 0.70$.\n    - $P(R_A|\\text{enceph}) = 0.50 + 0.15 - (0.50 \\times 0.15) = 0.65 - 0.075 = 0.575$.\n    - $P(R_A|\\text{tumor}) = 0.30 + 0.10 - (0.30 \\times 0.10) = 0.40 - 0.03 = 0.37$.\n    - $P(R_A|\\text{other}) = 0.20 + 0.05 - (0.20 \\times 0.05) = 0.25 - 0.01 = 0.24$.\n    \n    Next, we compute the weighted average:\n    Numerator for FAP = $(0.70 \\times 0.20) + (0.575 \\times 0.15) + (0.37 \\times 0.10) + (0.24 \\times 0.30)$\n    $= 0.14 + 0.08625 + 0.037 + 0.072 = 0.33525$.\n    $\\mathrm{FAP} = \\frac{0.33525}{0.75} = 0.447$.\n    This does not satisfy the FAP criterion ($0.447 \\not< 0.05$).\n\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect.** The false attribution probability is too high.\n\n#### Evaluation of Rule B\n**Rule B:** Diagnose sCJD only if CSF 14-3-3 is positive ($T_{1433}$) AND CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ ($T_{\\mathrm{tau}}$) AND CSF pleocytosis is absent ($T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}}$).\nThe rule is $R_B = T_{1433} \\land T_{\\mathrm{tau}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}}$.\nDue to conditional independence, $P(R_B|D) = P(T_{1433}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}}|D)$.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity for Rule B:**\n    $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = P(R_B|\\mathrm{sCJD}) = 0.90 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.90 = 0.6885$.\n    This does not satisfy the sensitivity criterion ($0.6885 \\not\\ge 0.80$).\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.** The sensitivity is too low. We do not need to calculate the FAP.\n\n#### Evaluation of Rule C\n**Rule C:** Diagnose sCJD only if CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ ($T_{\\mathrm{tau}}$) AND dynamic tau decline $<30\\%$ ($T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}}$) AND CSF RBC contamination is absent ($T_{\\mathrm{RBC-abs}}$).\nThe rule is $R_C = T_{\\mathrm{tau}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{RBC-abs}}$.\nDue to conditional independence, $P(R_C|D) = P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{RBC-abs}}|D)$.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity for Rule C:**\n    $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = P(R_C|\\mathrm{sCJD}) = 0.85 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.95 = 0.72675$.\n    This does not satisfy the sensitivity criterion ($0.72675 \\not\\ge 0.80$).\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.** The sensitivity is too low. We do not need to calculate the FAP.\n\n#### Evaluation of Rule D\n**Rule D:** Diagnose sCJD if RT-QuIC is positive ($T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}$); if RT-QuIC is negative, diagnose sCJD only if ($T_{1433} \\land T_{\\mathrm{tau}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{DWI}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}}$).\nLet $R_{D2} = T_{1433} \\land T_{\\mathrm{tau}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{DWI}} \\land T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}}$.\nThe full rule is $R_D = T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}} \\lor (\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}} \\land R_{D2})$.\nSince $T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}$ and $\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}$ are mutually exclusive, $P(R_D|D) = P(T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|D) + P(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}} \\land R_{D2}|D)$.\nBy conditional independence, $P(R_D|D) = P(T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|D) + P(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|D)P(R_{D2}|D)$.\n$P(R_{D2}|D) = P(T_{1433}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{tau}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{pleo-abs}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{DWI}}|D) \\times P(T_{\\mathrm{decline-abs}}|D)$.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity for Rule D:**\n    First, calculate $P(R_{D2}|\\mathrm{sCJD})$:\n    $P(R_{D2}|\\mathrm{sCJD}) = 0.90 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.90 = 0.49572$.\n    Then, calculate $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = P(R_D|\\mathrm{sCJD})$:\n    $P(T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|\\mathrm{sCJD}) = 0.92$, so $P(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|\\mathrm{sCJD}) = 1-0.92 = 0.08$.\n    $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} = 0.92 + (0.08 \\times 0.49572) = 0.92 + 0.0396576 = 0.9596576$.\n    This satisfies the sensitivity criterion ($0.9596576 \\ge 0.80$).\n\n2.  **False Attribution Probability for Rule D:**\n    For all non-prion diseases $D_i$, $P(T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|D_i) = 0.01$, so $P(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RTQ}}|D_i) = 0.99$.\n    The general form for $P(R_D|D_i)$ is $0.01 + 0.99 \\times P(R_{D2}|D_i)$.\n    \n    - For **stroke**:\n      $P(R_{D2}|\\text{stroke}) = 0.60 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.30 = 0.0063$.\n      $P(R_D|\\text{stroke}) = 0.01 + (0.99 \\times 0.0063) = 0.01 + 0.006237 = 0.016237$.\n    - For **encephalitis**:\n      $P(R_{D2}|\\text{enceph}) = 0.50 \\times 0.15 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.50 = 0.0015$.\n      $P(R_D|\\text{enceph}) = 0.01 + (0.99 \\times 0.0015) = 0.01 + 0.001485 = 0.011485$.\n    - For **tumor**:\n      $P(R_{D2}|\\text{tumor}) = 0.30 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.60 = 0.0009$.\n      $P(R_D|\\text{tumor}) = 0.01 + (0.99 \\times 0.0009) = 0.01 + 0.000891 = 0.010891$.\n    - For **other**:\n      $P(R_{D2}|\\text{other}) = 0.20 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.70 = 0.00056$.\n      $P(R_D|\\text{other}) = 0.01 + (0.99 \\times 0.00056) = 0.01 + 0.0005544 = 0.0105544$.\n\n    Now, compute the FAP:\n    Numerator = $(0.016237 \\times 0.20) + (0.011485 \\times 0.15) + (0.010891 \\times 0.10) + (0.0105544 \\times 0.30)$\n    $= 0.0032474 + 0.00172275 + 0.0010891 + 0.00316632 = 0.00922557$.\n    $\\mathrm{FAP} = \\frac{0.00922557}{0.75} \\approx 0.0123$.\n    This satisfies the FAP criterion ($0.0123 < 0.05$).\n\n**Verdict for D: Correct.** The rule simultaneously achieves a sensitivity of approximately $0.96$ and a false attribution probability of approximately $0.0123$, meeting both required constraints.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Diagnose sCJD if CSF 14-3-3 is positive or CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.**\n    This rule has a high sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} \\approx 0.985$), which meets the criterion. However, its false attribution probability among non-prion cases is very high ($\\mathrm{FAP} \\approx 0.447$), failing to meet the criterion of being $<0.05$.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Diagnose sCJD only if CSF 14-3-3 is positive and CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ and CSF pleocytosis is absent.**\n    This rule has a sensitivity of $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} \\approx 0.689$. This value is below the required threshold of $0.80$.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Diagnose sCJD only if CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ and dynamic tau decline over $7\\,\\mathrm{days}$ is $<30\\%$ and CSF RBC contamination is absent.**\n    This rule has a sensitivity of $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} \\approx 0.727$. This value is below the required threshold of $0.80$.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Diagnose sCJD if RT-QuIC is positive; if RT-QuIC is negative, diagnose sCJD only if CSF 14-3-3 is positive and CSF total tau $>1200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ and CSF pleocytosis is absent and DWI is typical of prion disease, and dynamic tau decline over $7\\,\\mathrm{days}$ is $<30\\%$.**\n    This complex rule achieves a high sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{sCJD}} \\approx 0.96$), which is $\\ge 0.80$. It also achieves a very low false attribution probability ($\\mathrm{FAP} \\approx 0.0123$), which is $<0.05$. This rule satisfies both constraints.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.",
