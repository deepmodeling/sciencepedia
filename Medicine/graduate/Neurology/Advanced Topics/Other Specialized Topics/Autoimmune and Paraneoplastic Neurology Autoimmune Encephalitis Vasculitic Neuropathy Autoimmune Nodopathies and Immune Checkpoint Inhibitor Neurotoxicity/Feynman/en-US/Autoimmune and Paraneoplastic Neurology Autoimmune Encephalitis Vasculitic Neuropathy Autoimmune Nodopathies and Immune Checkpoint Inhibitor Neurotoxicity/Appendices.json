The dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}][\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the free receptor concentration, $[\\mathrm{R}]$, in terms of $[\\mathrm{RL}]$, $[\\mathrm{L}]$, and $K_{d}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}] = \\frac{K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$ back into our equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]}\\right) + [\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\n\nThe term $[\\mathrm{RL}]$ is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator.

We substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$f = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}$$\nThe units of nanomolar ($\\mathrm{nM}$) cancel out, yielding a dimensionless fraction:\n$$f = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives $f \\approx 0.66666...$.

A fractional occupancy of $f \\approx 0.67$ indicates that approximately two-thirds of the total NMDA receptors on the neuronal surface are bound by the pathogenic autoantibodies. In anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, the binding of these antibodies, which are typically bivalent IgG molecules, allows them to cross-link adjacent NMDA receptors. This cross-linking is a potent signal for the cell to remove the receptors from the synapse via endocytosis. Consequently, a high level of receptor occupancy leads to a substantial, antibody-mediated internalization and subsequent degradation of NMDA receptors. This causes a dramatic reduction in the density of functional NMDA receptors at the synaptic cleft. Since NMDA receptors are crucial for excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission and are fundamental to synaptic plasticity, memory, and higher cognitive functions, their depletion leads to a profound synaptic hypofunction. This impairment of NMDA receptor-mediated signaling is the direct molecular basis for the severe psychiatric and neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease.",

Then compute its value given the numbers above.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single fraction in simplest terms. Do not include any units or a percent sign. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded application of Bayesian probability to clinical diagnostics, providing all necessary information without contradiction.\n\nLet us define the relevant events for this analysis:\n$D$: The event that the patient has an underlying breast or ovarian carcinoma (the \"disease\").\n$D^c$: The event that the patient does not have an underlying breast or ovarian carcinoma.\n$T$: The event that the patient's anti-Yo antibody test result is positive.\n$T^c$: The event that the patient's anti-Yo antibody test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into the language of probability as follows:\nThe pretest probability, or prevalence, of the disease is given as $P(D) = 0.10$.\nFrom this, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is given as $P(T|D) = 0.70$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is given as $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) and compute its value. The PPV is defined as the probability that the patient has the disease given that the test result is positive, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe begin the derivation from fundamental principles, as requested. Bayes' rule provides the formal relationship between $P(D|T)$ and $P(T|D)$:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$, we can express the numerator as:\n$$ P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D) \\times P(D) $$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result, regardless of the patient's actual disease status. We can expand this term using the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: ($1$) the patient has the disease and tests positive, or ($2$) the patient does not have the disease and tests positive. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nThe first term, $P(T|D)P(D)$, is the probability of a true positive. The second term, $P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$, is the probability of a false positive.\n\nWe have an expression for $P(T|D^c)$? No, but we have the specificity, $P(T^c|D^c)$. The event of a positive test in a disease-free individual, $P(T|D^c)$, and the event of a negative test in a disease-free individual, $P(T^c|D^c)$, are complementary. Therefore:\n$$ P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) $$\nThis quantity, $P(T|D^c)$, is also known as the false positive rate.\n\nSubstituting all these components back into the expression for $P(D|T)$ yields the complete form of Bayes' rule for this problem:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the positive predictive value. We can also express this in terms of sensitivity ($S_e = P(T|D)$), specificity ($S_p = P(T^c|D^c)$), and prevalence ($p = P(D)$):\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{S_e \\times p}{S_e \\times p + (1 - S_p) \\times (1 - p)} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n$p = P(D) = 0.10$\n$S_e = P(T|D) = 0.70$\n$S_p = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.98$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required probabilities:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for PPV:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.10}{(0.70 \\times 0.10) + (0.02 \\times 0.90)} $$\nLet's calculate the numerator and the two terms in the denominator:\nNumerator (probability of true positives):\n$$ P(T|D)P(D) = 0.70 \\times 0.10 = 0.07 $$\nDenominator term $1$ (probability of true positives):\n$$ 0.07 $$\nDenominator term $2$ (probability of false positives):\n$$ P(T|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.02 \\times 0.90 = 0.018 $$\nTotal probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(T) = 0.07 + 0.018 = 0.088 $$\nThe positive predictive value is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.07}{0.088} $$\nTo express this as a fraction in simplest terms, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{0.07}{0.088} = \\frac{70}{88} $$\nThe greatest common divisor of $70$ and $88$ is $2$. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{70 \\div 2}{88 \\div 2} = \\frac{35}{44} $$\nThe prime factors of $35$ are $5$ and $7$. The prime factors of $44$ are $2^2$ and $11$. There are no common prime factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\nThus, the positive predictive value of the anti-Yo test in this patient is $\\frac{35}{44}$.",

Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV_{++}$)**\n\nThe positive predictive value of the sequential algorithm for a patient who tests positive on both assays is defined as the probability that the patient has the disease given two positive test results, $PPV_{++} = P(D \\mid T_1+, T_2+)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can write this as:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T_1+, T_2+)}$$\n\nThe numerator represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive on both assays. Using the conditional independence assumption:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D) P(D) = P(T_1+ \\mid D) P(T_2+ \\mid D) P(D) = Se_1 Se_2 p$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T_1+, T_2+)$, is the total probability of obtaining two positive tests. We can expand this using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease state $D$:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+) = P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\n\nThe first term is the numerator we just found. The second term represents the joint probability of not having the disease and testing positive on both assays (a false positive result for the sequence). Applying the conditional independence assumption again:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D) = P(T_1+ \\mid \\neg D)P(T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$$\n\nCombining these terms, the denominator becomes:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+) = Se_1 Se_2 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the formula for $PPV_{++}$, we arrive at the final derived expression:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{Se_1 Se_2 p}{Se_1 Se_2 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)}$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**2. Justification for Reduced False Discovery and Numerical Calculation**\n\nA false discovery in this context is a false-positive result. The sequential algorithm reduces false discoveries by significantly lowering the probability of a false-positive outcome compared to the screening test alone.\n\nLet us compare the PPV of the screening test alone, $PPV_1 = P(D \\mid T_1+)$, with $PPV_{++}$. The formula for $PPV_1$ is:\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{P(T_1+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T_1+)} = \\frac{Se_1 p}{Se_1 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-p)}$$\n\nThe probability of a true-positive result for the single test is $P(\\text{TP}_1) = Se_1 p$. For the sequential test, this probability is $P(\\text{TP}_{++}) = Se_1 Se_2 p$. The number of true positives is reduced by a factor of $Se_2 = 0.88$.\n\nThe probability of a false-positive result for the single test is $P(\\text{FP}_1) = (1-Sp_1)(1-p)$. For the sequential test, this probability is $P(\\text{FP}_{++}) = (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$. The number of false positives is reduced by a factor of $(1-Sp_2) = 0.01$.\n\nThe key to reducing false discovery is that the probability of a false-positive result is reduced far more dramatically than the probability of a true-positive result. The ratio of the scaling factors is $\\frac{1-Sp_2}{Se_2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.88} \\approx 0.011$. This indicates that the false-positive component of the total positive results is diminished by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to the true-positive component. The requirement for a second positive test acts as a highly effective filter, removing a large majority ($99\\%$) of the false positives generated by the initial, less specific screen, while retaining a large fraction ($88\\%$) of the true positives. This disproportionate reduction of false positives leads to a substantial increase in the post-test probability of disease (PPV) and thus a reduction in the false discovery rate ($1 - PPV$).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $PPV_{++}$ using the provided parameters: $p=0.04$, $Se_1=0.92$, $Sp_1=0.95$, $Se_2=0.88$, and $Sp_2=0.99$.\n\nNumerator:\n$$Se_1 Se_2 p = (0.92)(0.88)(0.04) = 0.8096 \\times 0.04 = 0.032384$$\n\nDenominator (false positive term):\n$$(1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p) = (1-0.95)(1-0.99)(1-0.04) = (0.05)(0.01)(0.96) = 0.00048$$\n\nTotal Denominator:\n$$0.032384 + 0.00048 = 0.032864$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $PPV_{++}$:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{0.032384}{0.032864} \\approx 0.98539435...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the positive predictive value for a patient testing positive on both assays is $0.9854$.\nFor comparison, the PPV of the screening test alone would be:\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{(0.92)(0.04)}{(0.92)(0.04) + (0.05)(0.96)} = \\frac{0.0368}{0.0368 + 0.048} = \\frac{0.0368}{0.0848} \\approx 0.4340$$\nThe sequential testing algorithm increases the PPV from approximately $43.4\\%$ to $98.5\\%$, a clear demonstration of the reduction in false discoveries.",
