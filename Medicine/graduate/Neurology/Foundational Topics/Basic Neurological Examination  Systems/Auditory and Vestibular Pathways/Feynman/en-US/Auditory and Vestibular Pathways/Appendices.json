            "problem": "Consider an inner hair cell (IHC) transduction pathway modeled as follows. The stereocilia deflection is driven by a basilar membrane displacement that is an amplitude-modulated sinusoid,\n$$\nx(t) = X_{0}\\bigl(1 + m \\cos(2\\pi f_{m} t)\\bigr)\\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t),\n$$\nwhere $X_{0} > 0$ is the carrier displacement amplitude, $0 \\le m \\le 1$ is the modulation index, $f_{c} > 0$ is the carrier frequency, and $f_{m} > 0$ is the modulation (envelope) frequency with $f_{m} \\ll f_{c}$.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard biophysical modeling, is well-posed with a unique solution, and is stated in objective, formal language. The model is a simplified but conceptually sound representation of inner hair cell signal transduction.\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv \\frac{V_{m}}{V_{c}}$, where $V_{m}$ and $V_{c}$ are the voltage component magnitudes at the modulation- (or envelope-) frequency $f_{m}$ and the carrier frequency $f_{c}$, respectively. The derivation proceeds in three main steps:\n1. Determine the sinusoidal components of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) current, $i_{\\mathrm{MET}}(t)$, at frequencies $f_{m}$ and $f_{c}$.\n2. Convert these current components into voltage components using the given membrane impedance, $Z_{m}(j\\omega)$.\n3. Compute the ratio of the resulting voltage magnitudes.\n\nStep 1: Analysis of the MET Current, $i_{\\mathrm{MET}}(t)$\n\nThe MET current is given by the weakly nonlinear function of displacement $x(t)$:\n$$i_{\\mathrm{MET}}(t) = k\\,x(t) + \\beta\\,x^{2}(t)$$\nThe displacement $x(t)$ is an amplitude-modulated sinusoid:\n$$x(t) = X_{0}\\bigl(1 + m \\cos(2\\pi f_{m} t)\\bigr)\\cos(2\\pi f_{c} t)$$\nWe must find the amplitudes of the sinusoidal components of $i_{\\mathrm{MET}}(t)$ at frequencies $f_{m}$ and $f_{c}$. Let $\\omega_{m} = 2\\pi f_{m}$ and $\\omega_{c} = 2\\pi f_{c}$.\n\nFirst, consider the linear term, $k\\,x(t)$:\n$$k\\,x(t) = k X_{0}\\cos(\\omega_{c} t) + k m X_{0} \\cos(\\omega_{m} t)\\cos(\\omega_{c} t)$$\nUsing the product-to-sum trigonometric identity, $\\cos(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B)]$, the second term becomes:\n$$k m X_{0} \\cos(\\omega_{m} t)\\cos(\\omega_{c} t) = \\frac{k m X_{0}}{2} \\left[ \\cos((\\omega_{c}-\\omega_{m})t) + \\cos((\\omega_{c}+\\omega_{m})t) \\right]$$\nSo, the linear term is:\n$$k\\,x(t) = k X_{0}\\cos(\\omega_{c} t) + \\frac{k m X_{0}}{2} \\cos((\\omega_{c}-\\omega_{m})t) + \\frac{k m X_{0}}{2} \\cos((\\omega_{c}+\\omega_{m})t)$$\nThis term contains a component at the carrier frequency $f_{c}$ with amplitude $k X_{0}$. It does not contain any component at the envelope frequency $f_{m}$, since $f_{m} \\ll f_{c}$ implies $f_m \\neq f_c$ and $f_m \\neq f_c \\pm f_m$.\n\nNext, consider the quadratic term, $\\beta\\,x^{2}(t)$:\n$$x^{2}(t) = \\left[X_{0}\\bigl(1 + m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t)\\bigr)\\cos(\\omega_{c} t)\\right]^2 = X_{0}^2 \\bigl(1 + m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t)\\bigr)^2 \\cos^2(\\omega_{c} t)$$\nWe expand the two factors. For the envelope term:\n$$\\bigl(1 + m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t)\\bigr)^2 = 1 + 2m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) + m^2 \\cos^2(\\omega_{m} t)$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(A) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2A))$, this becomes:\n$$1 + 2m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) + \\frac{m^2}{2}\\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\omega_{m} t)\\bigr) = \\left(1 + \\frac{m^2}{2}\\right) + 2m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) + \\frac{m^2}{2} \\cos(2\\omega_{m} t)$$\nFor the carrier term:\n$$\\cos^2(\\omega_{c} t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\omega_{c} t)\\bigr)$$\nNow, we multiply these expanded factors to get $x^2(t)$:\n$$x^2(t) = \\frac{X_0^2}{2} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{m^2}{2}\\right) + 2m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) + \\frac{m^2}{2} \\cos(2\\omega_{m} t) \\right] \\left[ 1 + \\cos(2\\omega_{c} t) \\right]$$\nThis product generates two sets of frequency components. The first set, which is at low frequencies, arises from the multiplication by $1$ in the second bracket:\n$$\\frac{X_0^2}{2} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{m^2}{2}\\right) + 2m \\cos(\\omega_{m} t) + \\frac{m^2}{2} \\cos(2\\omega_{m} t) \\right]$$\nThis term contains a DC component, a component at frequency $f_{m}$, and a component at $2f_{m}$. The component of $x^2(t)$ at frequency $f_{m}$ is $\\frac{X_0^2}{2} (2m \\cos(\\omega_m t)) = m X_0^2 \\cos(\\omega_m t)$.\nThe second set of frequencies arises from multiplication by $\\cos(2\\omega_c t)$ and are clustered around $2f_c$. These are high-frequency intermodulation products ($2f_c$, $2f_c \\pm f_m$, $2f_c \\pm 2f_m$).\n\nCrucially, the quadratic term $\\beta\\,x^{2}(t)$ does not produce any component at the carrier frequency $f_{c}$.\n\nSynthesizing these findings, we can write the amplitudes of the current components at $f_m$ and $f_c$:\nThe current component at $f_m$ arises solely from the $\\beta\\,x^{2}(t)$ term:\n$$i_{m}(t) = \\beta (m X_0^2 \\cos(\\omega_m t))$$\nThe amplitude of this current component is $I_{m} = \\beta m X_{0}^{2}$.\n\nThe current component at $f_c$ arises solely from the $k\\,x(t)$ term:\n$$i_{c}(t) = k X_{0} \\cos(\\omega_{c} t)$$\nThe amplitude of this current component is $I_{c} = k X_{0}$.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of Voltage Components\n\nThe IHC membrane is a linear system, so we can analyze the response to each frequency component of the current independently. The voltage response to a sinusoidal current $i(t) = I \\cos(\\omega t)$ is $v(t) = |Z_{m}(j\\omega)| I \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, where $|Z_{m}(j\\omega)|$ is the magnitude of the impedance and $\\phi$ is its phase. The magnitude of the voltage is $V = |Z_{m}(j\\omega)| I$.\n\nThe magnitude of the given membrane impedance is:\n$$|Z_{m}(j\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{R_{m}}{1 + j \\omega \\tau_{m}} \\right| = \\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega \\tau_{m})^2}} = \\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f \\tau_{m})^2}}$$\nNow, we calculate the voltage magnitudes $V_{m}$ and $V_{c}$.\n\nFor the component at $f_{m}$:\n$$V_{m} = |Z_{m}(j\\omega_m)| I_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{m} \\tau_{m})^2}} (\\beta m X_{0}^{2})$$\n\nFor the component at $f_{c}$:\n$$V_{c} = |Z_{m}(j\\omega_c)| I_{c} = \\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{c} \\tau_{m})^2}} (k X_{0})$$\n\nStep 3: Computation of the Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = V_{m} / V_{c}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{V_{m}}{V_{c}} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{m} \\tau_{m})^2}} \\beta m X_{0}^{2}}{\\frac{R_{m}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{c} \\tau_{m})^2}} k X_{0}}$$\nCanceling the common factors $R_{m}$ and one factor of $X_{0}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\beta m X_{0}}{k} \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{c} \\tau_{m})^2}}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_{m} \\tau_{m})^2}}$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\beta m X_{0}}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + (2\\pi f_{c} \\tau_{m})^2}{1 + (2\\pi f_{m} \\tau_{m})^2}}$$\nThis is the final exact expression for the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$.",

We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe goal is to find the steady-state expected coincidence output rate of a Medial Superior Olive (MSO) neuron. This rate depends on the arrival of phase-locked spikes from the left and right cochlear nuclei.\n\nFirst, we must determine the instantaneous firing rates of the inputs as they arrive at the MSO neuron. The problem specifies axonal propagation delays $\\Delta_{L}$ for the left input and $\\Delta_{R}$ for the right input. A spike generated at time $t$ at a cochlear nucleus arrives at the MSO at a later time $t'$. Therefore, to find the rate of spikes arriving at the MSO at time $t'$, we must evaluate the generation rate at the corresponding earlier time.\n\nFor the left input, a spike arriving at the MSO at time $t'$ must have been generated at the left cochlear nucleus at time $t = t' - \\Delta_{L}$.

For $s \\to 0$, $x$ is small.\n$$\\dot{\\Theta}(s) = \\tau \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (s(\\tau + \\tau_s) + s^2\\tau\\tau_s)} \\right)$$\n$$\\dot{\\Theta}(s) \\approx \\tau \\left( 1 - (s(\\tau + \\tau_s) + s^2\\tau\\tau_s) + \\dots \\right)$$\nKeeping terms up to first order in $s$:\n$$\\dot{\\Theta}(s) \\approx \\tau (1 - s(\\tau + \\tau_s)) = \\tau - s\\tau(\\tau + \\tau_s)$$\nNow, we expand the first-order approximate response $\\dot{\\Theta}_{approx}(s)$ around $s=0$:\n$$\\dot{\\Theta}_{approx}(s) = \\frac{K}{1 + sT_v} \\approx K(1 - sT_v) = K - sKT_v$$\nTo match the two expansions, we equate the coefficients of the powers of $s$:\n-   Matching the $s^0$ (constant) term: $K = \\tau$.\n-   Matching the $s^1$ term: $-KT_v = -\\tau(\\tau + \\tau_s)$.\n\nSubstituting $K = \\tau$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$-\\tau T_v = -\\tau(\\tau + \\tau_s)$$\nDividing by $-\\tau$ (since $\\tau$ is a non-zero time constant) yields the expression for the effective decay time constant $T_v$:\n$$T_v = \\tau + \\tau_s$$\nThis result is the sum of the canal time constant and the velocity storage time constant. It represents the time constant of a first-order system whose step response behavior at $t \\to \\infty$ (which corresponds to $s \\to 0$) matches that of the original second-order system.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $T_v$ using the given parameters: $\\tau = 5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_s = 15\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$T_v = 5\\,\\mathrm{s} + 15\\,\\mathrm{s} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe computed effective decay time constant is $T_v = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to assess the consistency of this result with clinical observations. The typical range for nystagmus decay time constants in humans is given as $15$ to $25\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nOur calculated value of $T_v = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}$ falls squarely within this range $[15\\,\\mathrm{s}, 25\\,\\mathrm{s}]$. Therefore, the value computed from the model and its specified approximation is consistent with typical clinical observations.",
