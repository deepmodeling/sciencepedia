This exercise explores the direct consequence of one such property—conduction velocity—on the perception of pain. By modeling the total time from stimulus to response, you will quantify how the difference in speed between thinly myelinated A-delta fibers and unmyelinated C fibers translates into a measurable difference in reaction time . This calculation provides a tangible understanding of the neurophysiological basis for the distinct sensations of sharp, \"first pain\" versus dull, \"second pain.\"",

            "problem": "A clinician is performing a sensory examination that differentiates primary modalities (mediated by distinct peripheral afferents) from higher-order cortical modalities. In a simple detection paradigm, a nociceptive stimulus is applied at the distal foot to preferentially activate either thinly myelinated A-delta (\\textit{fast pain, pinprick}) fibers or unmyelinated C (\\textit{slow pain, burning}) fibers. Assume the following scientifically grounded model for detection Reaction Time (RT), defined as the sum of serial delays from stimulus onset to a finger-press response:\n\n1. The afferent peripheral conduction distance from the stimulus site to the first central synapse is $L_{\\text{aff}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{m}$.\n2.

The specified conduction velocities for A-delta ($15 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) and C fibers ($1 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) are archetypal values within their established biological ranges (A-delta: $5-30 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$; C: $0.5-2 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). All other parameters are also physiologically realistic. The formulation of reaction time as a sum of serial delays is a foundational concept in chronometric studies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data and relationships. The objective is stated unambiguously, ensuring that a unique and stable solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is articulated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased scientific language, free from subjective or speculative content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe total Reaction Time ($T$) is the linear summation of all sequential time delays from stimulus to response. The general formula for $T$ is:\n$$\nT = (\\text{total conduction time}) + (\\text{total synaptic delay}) + (\\text{electromechanical delay})\n$$\nThe total conduction time is the sum of the times for the afferent, central, and efferent segments. The time $t$ for any segment of length $L$ and conduction velocity $v$ is $t = L/v$. The total synaptic delay is the product of the number of synapses $N$ and the per-synapse delay $d_{\\text{syn}}$.\nTherefore, the full expression for reaction time is:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_{\\text{aff}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N \\cdot d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}}\n$$\nThe two conditions described in the problem differ only in the afferent conduction velocity, $v_{\\text{aff}}$.\n\nFor A-delta fiber–mediated detection ($T_{A\\delta}$), the afferent velocity is $v_{\\text{aff}} = v_{A\\delta}$. The reaction time is:\n$$\nT_{A\\delta} = \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_{A\\delta}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N \\cdot d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}}\n$$\nFor C-fiber–mediated detection ($T_C$), the afferent velocity is $v_{\\text{aff}} = v_C$. The reaction time is:\n$$\nT_C = \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_C} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N \\cdot d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}}\n$$\nThe desired quantity is the difference $\\Delta T = T_C - T_{A\\delta}$. Subtracting the expression for $T_{A\\delta}$ from that for $T_C$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_C} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_{A\\delta}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}} \\right)\n$$\nAll terms common to both pathways (central conduction, efferent conduction, synaptic delay, and electromechanical delay) cancel out. This leaves only the difference in the afferent conduction times:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_C} - \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_{A\\delta}}\n$$\nFactoring out the common distance $L_{\\text{aff}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\Delta T = L_{\\text{aff}} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_C} - \\frac{1}{v_{A\\delta}} \\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $L_{\\text{aff}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{m}$, $v_C = 1 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $v_{A\\delta} = 15 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T = 1.0 \\, \\text{m} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{15 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} \\right)\n$$\nThe units of meters ($\\text{m}$) cancel, and the resulting unit is seconds ($\\text{s}$).\n$$\n\\Delta T = 1.0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{15} \\right) \\, \\text{s} = 1.0 \\left( \\frac{15}{15} - \\frac{1}{15} \\right) \\, \\text{s} = \\frac{14}{15} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nTo express the answer in milliseconds ($\\text{ms}$), we use the conversion $1 \\, \\text{s} = 1000 \\, \\text{ms}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{14}{15} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{ms} = \\frac{14000}{15} \\, \\text{ms} \\approx 933.333... \\, \\text{ms}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 933.3 \\, \\text{ms}\n$$",

            "solution": "Barognosis is a higher-order (cortical) sensory modality that depends on intact primary modalities (light touch, vibration, and proprioception) conveyed by the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway and integrated within the posterior parietal cortex. To test barognosis without confounds from non-weight cues, the assessment must control for geometry, texture, temperature, and visual input, ensuring that the only salient stimulus dimension is mass. The Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) paradigm reduces criterion effects by requiring a choice between two stimuli per trial and allows construction of a psychometric function mapping stimulus difference to performance.\n\nIn psychophysics, the just noticeable difference (JND), denoted $\\Delta m$, is the smallest change in stimulus magnitude that produces a reliably detectable difference at a predefined performance criterion on the psychometric function (commonly $75\\%$ correct for 2AFC).

This requires the application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nBayes' theorem states that for a hypothesis $H$ and evidence $E$, the posterior probability $P(H \\mid E)$ is given by:\n$$ P(H \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} $$\nIn the context of this problem, the hypothesis $H$ is $\\mathrm{B12}$, and the evidence $E$ is the set of clinical \"findings\". Therefore, the formula is:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{B12}) P(\\mathrm{B12})}{P(\\mathrm{findings})} $$\nThe terms in the numerator are provided: the likelihood $P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{B12}) = 0.8$ and the prior probability $P(\\mathrm{B12}) = 0.30$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(\\mathrm{findings})$, is the marginal probability of observing the findings, regardless of the underlying cause. This term is also known as the total probability or the evidence. It must be computed by marginalizing over all possible hypotheses.\n\nA necessary assumption for this computation is that the set of hypotheses $\\{\\mathrm{B12}, \\mathrm{tumor}, \\mathrm{neuropathy}\\}$ is both mutually exclusive (a patient cannot have two of these simultaneously as the primary cause) and collectively exhaustive (these are the only three possible causes under consideration). The problem statement explicitly provides this as a given condition.\n\nUnder this assumption, the law of total probability can be applied:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{findings}) = \\sum_{i} P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid H_i) P(H_i) $$\nwhere $H_i$ represents each hypothesis in the set. Expanding this for the three given etiologies:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{findings}) = P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{B12}) P(\\mathrm{B12}) + P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{tumor}) P(\\mathrm{tumor}) + P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{neuropathy}) P(\\mathrm{neuropathy}) $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{findings}) = (0.8)(0.30) + (0.7)(0.10) + (0.5)(0.60) $$\n$$ P(\\mathrm{findings}) = 0.24 + 0.07 + 0.30 $$\n$$ P(\\mathrm{findings}) = 0.61 $$\nNow we can substitute this value for the total evidence back into the Bayes' theorem equation to find the posterior probability of Vitamin B12 deficiency:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{findings} \\mid \\mathrm{B12}) P(\\mathrm{B12})}{P(\\mathrm{findings})} $$\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) = \\frac{(0.8)(0.30)}{0.61} $$\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) = \\frac{0.24}{0.61} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) \\approx 0.39344262... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(\\mathrm{B12} \\mid \\mathrm{findings}) \\approx 0.3934 $$\nThis result represents the updated probability of the patient having Vitamin B12 deficiency after considering the clinical findings. The initial probability (prior) was $0.30$, and the evidence increased it to approximately $0.3934$.",
