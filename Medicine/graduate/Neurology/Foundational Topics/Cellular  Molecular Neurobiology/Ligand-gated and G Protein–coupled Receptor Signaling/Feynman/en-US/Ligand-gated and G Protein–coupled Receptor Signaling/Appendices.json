This first practice focuses on the canonical inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and its type A receptor. By calculating the instantaneous current and exploring its consequences, you will grasp the crucial distinction between hyperpolarizing inhibition, which pushes the membrane potential away from the firing threshold, and shunting inhibition, which reduces the impact of excitatory inputs by decreasing membrane resistance.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neurophysiology and biophysics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated using objective, unambiguous terminology. The provided values for conductance, membrane potential, and reversal potential are physiologically plausible.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested: first, the calculation of the instantaneous postsynaptic current, and second, a principled explanation of shunting versus hyperpolarizing inhibition.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the Inhibitory Postsynaptic Current (IPSC)\n\nThe problem states that the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptor channel exhibits an approximately ohmic current–voltage relationship. For an ionic channel, this relationship is a form of Ohm's law, which states that the current ($I$) flowing through the channel is the product of the channel's conductance ($g$) and the electrochemical driving force.\n\nThe driving force on an ion is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the ion's reversal potential ($E_{rev}$). The expression for the current is therefore:\n$$I = g (V_m - E_{rev})$$\nIn this specific problem, we are calculating the current through GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels, so we use the specific conductance $g_{GABA}$ and reversal potential $E_{GABA}$.\n$$I_{GABA} = g_{GABA} (V_m - E_{GABA})$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Conductance, $g_{GABA} = 10 \\text{ nS} = 10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}$\n- Membrane potential, $V_m = -50 \\text{ mV} = -50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$\n- Reversal potential, $E_{rev} = E_{GABA} = -70 \\text{ mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the equation. It is crucial to maintain consistent units (Volts, Siemens, Amperes).\n$$I_{GABA} = (10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}) \\times [(-50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) - (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})]$$\nFirst, calculate the driving force, $(V_m - E_{GABA})$:\n$$V_m - E_{GABA} = -50 \\text{ mV} - (-70 \\text{ mV}) = -50 \\text{ mV} + 70 \\text{ mV} = +20 \\text{ mV} = +20 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\nNow, multiply the conductance by the driving force:\n$$I_{GABA} = (10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})$$\n$$I_{GABA} = 200 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$$\nThe question asks for the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1 \\text{ pA} = 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$.\n$$I_{GABA} = 200 \\text{ pA}$$\nThe sign of the current is positive. The problem defines a positive current as the outward movement of positive charge. The GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channel is a chloride ($Cl^−$) channel. A positive driving force ($+20$ mV) will drive the negatively charged $Cl^−$ ions into the cell. This influx of negative charge is electrically equivalent to an efflux (outward movement) of positive charge. Therefore, the calculated positive sign is consistent with the established sign convention and the underlying biophysics.\n\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $200$. To express this unambiguously with three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation.\n$$I_{GABA} = 2.00 \\times 10^2 \\text{ pA}$$\n\nPart 2: Explanation of Shunting vs. Hyperpolarizing Inhibition\n\nThe distinction between hyperpolarizing and shunting inhibition arises from the dual effects of opening ion channels: the generation of an ionic current and the increase in membrane conductance. We deduce the conditions for each from first principles.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles**:\n    The current through an ohmic synaptic channel is $I_{syn} = g_{syn}(V_m - E_{rev})$, where $g_{syn}$ is the synaptic conductance, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential. The reversal potential is defined as the membrane potential at which there is no net current through the open channel ($I_{syn}=0$), which occurs when $V_m = E_{rev}$. For the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptor, $E_{rev}$ is typically the Nernst potential for chloride, $E_{Cl}$, which we denote as $E_{GABA}$.\n    The total input resistance of a neuron, $R_{in}$, is the reciprocal of its total input conductance, $G_{in}$. $R_{in} = 1/G_{in}$. $G_{in}$ is the sum of all conductances of the channels open in the membrane.\n\n2.  **Hyperpolarizing Inhibition**:\n    By definition, hyperpolarization is the process of making the membrane potential more negative. For inhibition to be hyperpolarizing, the opening of GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels must cause a current that drives $V_m$ to a more negative value.\n    The GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ current, $I_{GABA} = g_{GABA}(V_m - E_{GABA})$, will drive $V_m$ toward $E_{GABA}$. Therefore, a hyperpolarizing effect occurs if the membrane potential is initially more positive (depolarized) than the GABA reversal potential.\n    This condition is expressed as:\n    $$V_m > E_{GABA}$$\n    When this is true, the driving force $(V_m - E_{GABA})$ is positive. This results in a positive (outward) current, $I_{GABA} > 0$. For a channel permeable to a negative ion like $Cl^-$, this outward positive current corresponds to an inward flow (influx) of $Cl^-$. The influx of negative charge makes the inside of the cell more negative, thus hyperpolarizing the membrane.\n    In summary, hyperpolarizing inhibition occurs when GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels are activated while the membrane potential is above the GABA reversal potential.\n\n3.  **Shunting Inhibition**:\n    Shunting inhibition is a mechanism that reduces the efficacy of other synaptic inputs, regardless of whether it causes hyperpolarization. This effect is a direct consequence of the change in the neuron's input resistance.\n    When GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels open, they introduce an additional conductance, $g_{GABA}$, into the neuron's membrane. The new total membrane conductance, $G_{in, new}$, is the sum of the resting conductance, $G_{rest}$, and the GABAergic conductance, $g_{GABA}$:\n    $$G_{in, new} = G_{rest} + g_{GABA}$$\n    Consequently, the neuron's input resistance decreases:\n    $$R_{in, new} = \\frac{1}{G_{rest} + g_{GABA}} < \\frac{1}{G_{rest}} = R_{in, rest}$$\n    According to Ohm's law applied to the entire neuron, the change in membrane potential ($\\Delta V_m$) caused by another synaptic current (e.g., an excitatory current, $I_{EPSP}$) is given by $\\Delta V_m = I_{EPSP} \\times R_{in}$.\n    In the presence of the active GABAergic synapse, the same excitatory current $I_{EPSP}$ will produce a smaller depolarization:\n    $$\\Delta V_{EPSP, shunted} = I_{EPSP} \\times R_{in, new} < I_{EPSP} \\times R_{in, rest}$$\n    This reduction in the voltage response is the \"shunt\". The excitatory current is effectively diverted, or shunted, through the low-resistance pathway created by the open GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels, making it more difficult for the excitatory input to depolarize the neuron to its action potential threshold. This shunting mechanism is always active whenever $g_{GABA}$ increases, i.e., whenever the channels open.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Distinction**:\n    The key distinction lies in the role of the membrane potential relative to the reversal potential.\n    - If $V_m > E_{GABA}$, both mechanisms are at play: an influx of $Cl^-$ causes **hyperpolarization**, and the increased conductance causes a **shunt**. The term \"hyperpolarizing inhibition\" is typically used in this scenario.\n    - If $V_m = E_{GABA}$, the driving force is zero, so $I_{GABA}=0$. There is no current and therefore no direct change in membrane potential (no hyperpolarization or depolarization). However, the conductance $g_{GABA}$ is still added to the membrane, causing a decrease in $R_{in}$ and shunting any other currents. This is the case of \"pure\" **shunting inhibition**, where the inhibitory effect is solely due to the reduction of input resistance. The opening of the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels \"clamps\" the membrane potential at $E_{GABA}$ and reduces the impact of excitatory currents.\n    Therefore, GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ activation produces primarily shunting inhibition when the membrane potential is at or very near the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ reversal potential ($V_m \\approx E_{GABA}$). It produces hyperpolarizing inhibition when the membrane potential is significantly more depolarized than the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ reversal potential ($V_m > E_{GABA}$).",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Voltage Dependence of $K_D$**\nThe total free energy of binding, $\\Delta G(V_m)$, at a membrane potential $V_m$ is the sum of the chemical free energy component (measured at $V_m=0$) and the electrical work performed to move the ion to its binding site.\n$$\n\\Delta G(V_m) = \\Delta G(0) + \\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the electrical work contribution is $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} = z \\delta F V_m$. Therefore, the total free energy of binding is:\n$$\n\\Delta G(V_m) = \\Delta G(0) + z \\delta F V_m\n$$\nThe relationship between the dissociation constant $K_D$ and the binding free energy $\\Delta G$ is given as $K_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$. We can write this as $K_D = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$ for some constant of proportionality $C$.\n\nAt zero membrane potential ($V_m=0$), the dissociation constant is $K_D(0)$:\n$$\nK_D(0) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(0)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nAt a non-zero membrane potential $V_m$, the dissociation constant is $K_D(V_m)$:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V_m)}{RT}\\right) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(0) + z \\delta F V_m}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nWe can separate the exponential term:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(0)}{RT}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_D(0)$, we obtain the Woodhull equation for the voltage-dependent dissociation constant:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = K_D(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Fraction of Unblocked Receptors**\nThe problem assumes a simple one-to-one binding equilibrium between the receptor's blocking site ($S$) and the magnesium ion ($\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$):\n$$\nS + \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons S \\cdot \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\n$$\nHere, $S$ represents an unblocked receptor and $S \\cdot \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ represents a blocked receptor. The equilibrium dissociation constant $K_D$ for this reaction is given by the law of mass action:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = \\frac{[S][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{[S \\cdot \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}\n$$\nThe fraction of unblocked receptors, $f_{\\text{unblocked}}$, is the concentration of unblocked sites divided by the total concentration of sites (unblocked plus blocked):\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + [S \\cdot \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}\n$$\nFrom the definition of $K_D(V_m)$, we can express the concentration of blocked receptors as:\n$$\n[S \\cdot \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = \\frac{[S][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_{\\text{unblocked}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + \\frac{[S][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[S]$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we must calculate the value of the exponent in the Woodhull equation. It is critical to ensure all units are in the SI system for consistency. The membrane potential is given as $V_m = -65$ mV, which is $-65 \\times 10^{-3}$ V.\nThe exponent is $\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT}$. We are given the values:\n$z\\delta = 1$ (dimensionless)\n$F = 96485$ C·mol$^{-1}$\n$V_m = -0.065$ V\n$R = 8.314$ J·mol$^{-1}$·K$^{-1}$\n$T = 310$ K\n\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$\n\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT} = \\frac{(1)(96485 \\, \\text{C·mol}^{-1})(-0.065 \\, \\text{V})}{(8.314 \\, \\text{J·mol}^{-1}·\\text{K}^{-1})(310 \\, \\text{K})} = \\frac{-6271.525}{2577.34} \\approx -2.43315\n$$\nNote that the units cancel, as $1$ J $= 1$ C·V.\n\nNext, we calculate the voltage-dependent dissociation constant, $K_D(V_m)$, using $K_D(0) = 3$ mM:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = (3 \\, \\text{mM}) \\exp(-2.43315) \\approx (3 \\, \\text{mM})(0.08776) \\approx 0.26328 \\, \\text{mM}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of unblocked receptors using $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 1$ mM:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mM}}{0.26328 \\, \\text{mM}}}\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3.79819} = \\frac{1}{4.79819} \\approx 0.2084115\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.2084$.",
