            "problem": "In a mature cortical neuron at metabolic steady state, an acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) molecule enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondrial matrix and is fully oxidized. From well-established biochemistry, each turn of the TCA cycle per acetyl-CoA yields reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($\\mathrm{FADH}_2$), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) via substrate-level phosphorylation. In neuronal mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) couples the reoxidation of these reduced electron carriers to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, characterized by an ATP-per-oxygen-atom-reduced stoichiometry (P/O ratio). Assume the following are valid under the stated neuronal conditions:\n- Each acetyl-CoA oxidized by the TCA cycle yields $3$ molecules of NADH, $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$, and $1$ molecule of GTP.\n- The P/O ratio for NADH is $2.5$, meaning the reoxidation of one NADH via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase produces $2.5$ molecules of ATP.\n- The P/O ratio for $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$ is $1.5$.\n- Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced in the TCA cycle is rapidly and efficiently converted to ATP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase with no net energetic cost, so count each GTP as one ATP equivalent.\n- Ignore all other energetic costs (for example, ion pumping unrelated to ATP synthesis, proton leak beyond that incorporated into the assumed P/O ratios, and transport overhead).\n\nUsing only these assumptions and starting from the foundational stoichiometry of the TCA cycle and the coupling of electron carrier reoxidation to ATP synthesis, compute the total number of ATP equivalents produced per acetyl-CoA oxidized.

The P/O ratio for NADH is given as $2.5$, meaning each molecule of NADH that is reoxidized by the electron transport chain results in the synthesis of $2.5$ molecules of ATP.\n    The ATP yield from NADH is:\n    $$ \\text{ATP from NADH} = (\\text{molecules of NADH}) \\times (\\text{P/O ratio for NADH}) $$\n    $$ \\text{ATP from NADH} = 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\; \\text{ATP} $$\n\n2.  **ATP from $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$:**\n    The TCA cycle yields $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$ per acetyl-CoA. The P/O ratio for $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$ is given as $1.5$.\n    The ATP yield from $\\mathrm{FADH}_2$ is:\n    $$ \\text{ATP from } \\mathrm{FADH}_2 = (\\text{molecules of } \\mathrm{FADH}_2) \\times (\\text{P/O ratio for } \\mathrm{FADH}_2) $$\n    $$ \\text{ATP from } \\mathrm{FADH}_2 = 1 \\times 1.5 = 1.5 \\; \\text{ATP} $$\n\n3.  **ATP from GTP:**\n    The TCA cycle produces $1$ molecule of GTP via substrate-level phosphorylation. The problem specifies that GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP on a one-to-one basis.\n    The ATP yield from GTP is:\n    $$ \\text{ATP from GTP} = (\\text{molecules of GTP}) \\times (\\text{ATP equivalence factor}) $$\n    $$ \\text{ATP from GTP} = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\; \\text{ATP} $$\n\n4.  **Total ATP Yield:**\n    The total number of ATP equivalents is the sum of the ATP generated from all three sources.\n    $$ \\text{Total ATP} = (\\text{ATP from NADH}) + (\\text{ATP from } \\mathrm{FADH}_2) + (\\text{ATP from GTP}) $$\n    $$ \\text{Total ATP} = 7.5 + 1.5 + 1 $$\n    $$ \\text{Total ATP} = 9.0 + 1 $$\n    $$ \\text{Total ATP} = 10 $$\n\nTherefore, the complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA under the specified conditions yields a total of $10$ ATP equivalents.",

Consider a straight cylindrical axon segment of length $L$ and diameter $d$. The membrane capacitance per unit area is $c_{m}$, and the action potential causes a transmembrane voltage excursion of magnitude $\\Delta V$ from baseline to peak. Assume monovalent Sodium (Na$^{+}$) ions carry charge $+e$, and that overlap between Sodium (Na$^{+}$) influx and Potassium (K$^{+}$) efflux during the spike increases the Sodium load above the minimal capacitive requirement by a dimensionless factor $\\alpha$.

The units are consistent after proper conversion, as will be demonstrated in the solution. The problem requires the synthesis of concepts from physics and biology, making it a non-trivial exercise in biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for $N_{ATP}$, the total number of ATP molecules consumed per action potential in the specified axon segment.\n\n1.  **Membrane Surface Area ($A$)**: The axon segment is a cylinder of length $L$ and diameter $d$. The surface area of the membrane is given by the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder.\n    $$ A = \\pi d L $$\n\n2.  **Total Membrane Capacitance ($C$)**: The total capacitance of the segment is the product of the specific membrane capacitance ($c_m$, capacitance per unit area) and the total membrane area ($A$).\n    $$ C = c_m A = c_m \\pi d L $$\n\n3.  **Minimum Charge Transfer ($Q_{cap}$)**: An action potential involves a change in the transmembrane voltage by $\\Delta V$. According to the fundamental capacitance relation, the minimum amount of charge that must move across the membrane to effect this voltage change is:\n    $$ Q_{cap} = C \\Delta V = c_m \\pi d L \\Delta V $$\n    This represents the charge required to change the voltage across the membrane as if it were a simple capacitor.\n\n4.  **Total Sodium Ion Influx ($N_{Na, total}$)**: The charge influx is carried by monovalent sodium ions (Na$^{+}$), each carrying a charge $+e$. The problem states that due to the temporal overlap of Na$^{+}$ influx and K$^{+}$ efflux currents during an action potential, the actual sodium load is a factor $\\alpha$ greater than the minimum capacitive requirement. First, we find the number of ions corresponding to $Q_{cap}$, let's call it $N_{Na, cap}$:\n    $$ N_{Na, cap} = \\frac{Q_{cap}}{e} = \\frac{c_m \\pi d L \\Delta V}{e} $$\n    The total number of sodium ions that actually enter the axon, $N_{Na, total}$, is then:\n    $$ N_{Na, total} = \\alpha N_{Na, cap} = \\frac{\\alpha c_m \\pi d L \\Delta V}{e} $$\n\n5.  **ATP Molecules Consumed ($N_{ATP}$)**: The increased intracellular sodium concentration is restored to its baseline level by the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ ATPase pump. The stoichiometry given is that $3$ Na$^{+}$ ions are extruded for every $1$ molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. Therefore, the number of ATP molecules required, $N_{ATP}$, is one-third of the total number of sodium ions that entered.\n    $$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{1}{3} N_{Na, total} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $N_{Na, total}$ from the previous step yields the final symbolic expression for the ATP cost:\n    $$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{\\alpha c_m \\pi d L \\Delta V}{3e} $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe now evaluate this expression using the provided parameters. First, we must ensure all units are in the SI system. The specific capacitance $c_m$ is given in mixed units and requires conversion.\n$$ c_{m} = 1.0 \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} = 1.0 \\frac{10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{F}}{(10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{m})^{2}} = 1.0 \\frac{10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{F}}{10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}} $$\n\nThe other parameters are:\n-   $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $d = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\Delta V = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $\\alpha = 4.0$ (dimensionless)\n-   $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $N_{ATP}$:\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{(4.0) (1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}) \\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{V})}{3 (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C})} $$\nThe units in the numerator are $(\\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{C}$, which cancels with the units of Coulombs in the denominator, resulting in a dimensionless number (a count of molecules), as expected.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{4.0 \\times \\pi \\times 5.0 \\times (10^{-2} \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{-1})}{3 \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}} $$\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{20.0 \\pi \\times 10^{-13}}{4.806529902 \\times 10^{-19}} $$\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{2.0 \\pi \\times 10^{-12}}{4.806529902 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx \\frac{6.2831853}{4.8065299} \\times 10^{7} $$\n$$ N_{ATP} \\approx 1.30721 \\times 10^{7} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ N_{ATP} \\approx 1.31 \\times 10^{7} $$\nThis is the total number of ATP molecules consumed to restore the sodium gradient after a single action potential in the specified axon segment.",

This is given by the expression $\\Delta \\mathrm{ATP} = \\mathrm{ATP}_{\\mathrm{MAS}} - \\mathrm{ATP}_{\\mathrm{G3P}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish a general formula for the number of ATP molecules synthesized per reducing equivalent. The total number of protons, $P_{total}$, required to synthesize one molecule of ATP must be determined. This cost has two components: the protons required to drive the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}\\mathrm{F}_{\\mathrm{o}}$-ATP synthase motor and the protons consumed for the symport of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) into the mitochondrial matrix.\nThe problem states that the ATP synthase has a $c$-ring of $c=8$ subunits, and a full rotation of this ring, driven by the translocation of $8$ protons, results in the synthesis of $3$ ATP molecules.

Let $P_{pumped}$ be the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the electron transport chain (ETC) for a given reducing equivalent. A fraction $f=0.15$ of these protons is lost to leak. The number of protons available for work (ATP synthesis and other transport) is therefore $P_{pumped} \\times (1-f)$.
