The model uses first-order kinetics, a standard and appropriate simplification for a rate-limiting step. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters, definitions, and relationships to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters are within biophysically plausible ranges for a fast central synapse. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Fusion Probability\nThe problem describes the completion of the rate-limiting step as a first-order kinetic process. The governing differential equation for the survival probability $S(t)$ is given as:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -k S(t) $$\nwith the initial condition $S(0)=1$. This is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating:\n$$ \\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)) = -kt $$\nGiven $S(0)=1$, we have $\\ln(S(t)) = -kt$. Exponentiating both sides yields the survival function:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-kt) $$\nThis expression gives the probability that the vesicle has *not* fused by time $t$. The probability that fusion *has* occurred by time $t$, which we can denote $P(t)$, is therefore:\n$$ P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe problem states that fusion is triggered only if the rate-limiting step completes within the fusion-competent window of duration $\\tau$, which starts at $t=0$ (the onset of the action potential's effect). The probability of a vesicle fusing during a single action potential, $P_{\\text{fuse}}$, is the probability that the step completes in the interval $[0, \\tau]$. This is given by:\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}} = P(\\tau) - P(0) = (1 - S(\\tau)) - (1 - S(0)) $$\nSince $S(0) = \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}} = 1 - S(\\tau) = 1 - \\exp(-k\\tau) $$\nThis is the general expression for the fusion probability for a given rate constant $k$.\n\n### Incorporating the Effect of the Neurotoxin\nThe problem states that the rate constant $k$ depends on the exposure time $T$ to the neurotoxin. The relationship is given by $k(T) = f(T)k_0$, where $k_0$ is the baseline rate constant and $f(T)$ is the fraction of functional SNAP-25 remaining. The expression for $f(T)$ is provided as $f(T) = \\exp(-\\lambda T)$.\nSubstituting these expressions into our equation for fusion probability, we obtain the probability of fusion as a function of exposure time $T$:\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}}(T) = 1 - \\exp(-k(T)\\tau) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-(f(T)k_0)\\tau\\right) $$\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}}(T) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-k_0 \\tau \\exp(-\\lambda T)\\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the fusion probability.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the following values:\n- $k_0 = 180 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 1.10 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln 2}{40} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- $T = 120 \\ \\mathrm{min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless product $\\lambda T$:\n$$ \\lambda T = \\left(\\frac{\\ln 2}{40} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\right) \\times (120 \\ \\mathrm{min}) = \\frac{120}{40} \\ln 2 = 3 \\ln 2 $$\nThis can also be written as $\\ln(2^3) = \\ln 8$.\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of remaining functional SNAP-25, $f(T) = \\exp(-\\lambda T)$:\n$$ f(T) = \\exp(-3 \\ln 2) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-3})) = 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\nNow, we can find the toxin-affected rate constant, $k(T)$:\n$$ k(T) = f(T) k_0 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 180 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 22.5 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless product $k(T)\\tau$:\n$$ k(T)\\tau = (22.5 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.10 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.02475 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this value into the expression for $P_{\\text{fuse}}(T)$:\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}}(T) = 1 - \\exp(-k(T)\\tau) = 1 - \\exp(-0.02475) $$\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}}(T) \\approx 1 - 0.97555135 = 0.02444865 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $2$, followed by $4$, $4$, $4$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ P_{\\text{fuse}}(T) \\approx 0.02445 $$",
