This practice explores the critical process of deduplication, where only the 'first isolate' per patient is typically included to prevent over-representation of resistant organisms from chronically colonized or infected patients. By working through a hypothetical scenario with different deduplication windows , you will gain a practical understanding of how this methodological choice directly influences the final reported susceptibility percentages.",

            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory is preparing a cumulative antibiogram for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from adult patients with chronic airway disease and frequent relapse over a 1-year period. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M39 guidance (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)), repeat isolates of the same species from the same patient within a specified deduplication window are excluded to avoid biasing the overall susceptibility estimate. Percent susceptible is defined as the proportion of included isolates classified as susceptible ($S$) among all included isolates tested for a specific antimicrobial agent. For this problem, treat intermediate ($I$) and resistant ($R$) classifications as nonsusceptible and include all three categories ($S$, $I$, $R$) in the denominator.\n\nDefine the inclusion rule as follows: for a given deduplication window $w$ (in days), within each patient, include the earliest isolate that is eligible; thereafter, exclude any subsequent isolate that occurs at a time separation less than or equal to $w$ days from the last included isolate; include a subsequent isolate only if it occurs strictly more than $w$ days after the last included isolate. Apply this rule independently for each patient across the entire 1-year period.\n\nThe antimicrobial of interest is ciprofloxacin. The day-of-year for each isolate and its categorical ciprofloxacin result are listed for $8$ distinct patients (A through H):\n\n- Patient A: day $5$ ($S$), day $25$ ($R$), day $55$ ($S$), day $70$ ($R$), day $90$ ($S$).\n- Patient B: day $10$ ($R$), day $16$ ($R$), day $45$ ($S$), day $80$ ($S$).\n- Patient C: day $1$ ($S$), day $20$ ($S$), day $35$ ($S$), day $50$ ($R$), day $85$ ($R$).\n- Patient D: day $14$ ($I$), day $29$ ($S$), day $44$ ($S$), day $59$ ($I$).\n- Patient E: day $5$ ($R$), day $19$ ($R$), day $40$ ($R$), day $75$ ($S$).\n- Patient F: day $2$ ($S$), day $17$ ($S$), day $18$ ($R$), day $60$ ($S$), day $120$ ($R$), day $151$ ($S$).\n- Patient G: day $30$ ($S$), day $39$ ($R$), day $50$ ($S$), day $64$ ($S$), day $79$ ($R$).\n- Patient H: day $12$ ($R$), day $30$ ($R$), day $43$ ($R$), day $58$ ($R$), day $74$ ($R$), day $95$ ($S$).\n\nStarting from the above definitions and data, compute the percent susceptible to ciprofloxacin for two deduplication windows: $w=30$ days and $w=14$ days. Let $p_{30}$ denote the decimal fraction susceptible when $w=30$, and let $p_{14}$ denote the decimal fraction susceptible when $w=14$. Then compute the change in percent susceptible defined by the difference $\\Delta = p_{14} - p_{30}$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $\\Delta$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the percent susceptible to ciprofloxacin for a collection of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates from $8$ distinct patients. This calculation must be performed for two different deduplication time windows, $w=30$ days and $w=14$ days. The percent susceptible, denoted as a decimal fraction $p$, is the ratio of the number of susceptible ($S$) isolates to the total number of included isolates. Isolates classified as intermediate ($I$) or resistant ($R$) are considered nonsusceptible and contribute only to the denominator.\n\nThe inclusion rule is applied sequentially for each patient:\n1. The first isolate is always included.\n2. For each subsequent isolate, calculate the time separation in days from the *most recent previously included* isolate.\n3. If this time separation is strictly greater than the deduplication window $w$, the current isolate is included. Otherwise, it is excluded.\n\nLet $S_w$ be the total count of included susceptible isolates and $N_w$ be the total count of all included isolates for a given window $w$. Then, the decimal fraction susceptible is $p_w = S_w / N_w$.

The dataset below lists, for a single antimicrobial agent, the number of unique-patient, first isolates per organism and the number of isolates interpreted as susceptible using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CLSI breakpoints. All isolates have been deduplicated as the first isolate per patient per organism across the analysis period, and mixed sources are combined in accordance with CLSI M39.

All data and conditions necessary for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The context, involving a cumulative antibiogram analysis according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M39 guidance, is a standard and realistic application of biostatistics in clinical microbiology. The prescribed statistical methods—the binomial sampling model and the Wilson score confidence interval—are appropriate for this type of data. The problem is therefore valid, and we may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the sum of the widths of the $95\\%$ Wilson confidence intervals for the proportion of susceptible isolates for all organisms that meet the CLSI M39 reporting threshold.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Organisms Meeting the Reporting Threshold**\n\nThe problem states that the minimum isolate threshold for reporting is $n \\ge 30$. We examine each organism:\n- *Escherichia coli*: Total isolates $n=180$. Since $180 \\ge 30$, this organism is included.\n- *Klebsiella pneumoniae*: Total isolates $n=52$. Since $52 \\ge 30$, this organism is included.\n- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: Total isolates $n=28$. Since $28 < 30$, this organism is excluded.\n- *Staphylococcus aureus*: Total isolates $n=34$. Since $34 \\ge 30$, this organism is included.\n- *Proteus mirabilis*: Total isolates $n=31$. Since $31 \\ge 30$, this organism is included.\n\nThus, calculations will be performed for four organisms: *E. coli*, *K. pneumoniae*, *S. aureus*, and *P. mirabilis*.\n\n**Step 2: The Wilson Score Confidence Interval and its Width**\n\nThe Wilson score confidence interval for a binomial proportion $p$ is derived by inverting the score test. The endpoints of the interval are the values of $p$ that satisfy the equation:\n$$ \\frac{|\\hat{p} - p|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = z $$\nwhere $n$ is the total number of trials (isolates), $x$ is the number of successes (susceptible isolates), $\\hat{p} = x/n$ is the sample proportion, and $z$ is the standard normal quantile for the desired confidence level. For a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval, we use $z = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.05/2) \\approx 1.96$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$ (\\hat{p} - p)^2 = z^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} $$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation in the variable $p$:\n$$ n(\\hat{p}^2 - 2\\hat{p}p + p^2) = z^2(p - p^2) $$\n$$ (n+z^2)p^2 - (2n\\hat{p} + z^2)p + n\\hat{p}^2 = 0 $$\nThe two solutions for $p$, which are the lower ($p_L$) and upper ($p_U$) bounds of the confidence interval, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ p_{L,U} = \\frac{(2n\\hat{p} + z^2) \\mp \\sqrt{(2n\\hat{p} + z^2)^2 - 4(n+z^2)(n\\hat{p}^2)}}{2(n+z^2)} $$\nAfter algebraic simplification of the term under the square root, the endpoints become:\n$$ p_{L,U} = \\frac{n\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\mp z\\sqrt{n\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n+z^2} $$\nSubstituting $\\hat{p} = x/n$, we have:\n$$ p_{L,U} = \\frac{x + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\mp z\\sqrt{\\frac{x(n-x)}{n} + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n+z^2} $$\nThe width of the confidence interval, $W$, is the difference between the upper and lower bounds, $W = p_U - p_L$:\n$$ W = p_U - p_L = \\frac{2z\\sqrt{\\frac{x(n-x)}{n} + \\frac{z^2}{4}}}{n+z^2} $$\nWe will use this formula to calculate the width for each qualifying organism, with the given value $z=1.96$.

The goal is to quantify the effect of combining blood and urine isolates on the empiric regimen choice and the expected coverage probability in the target urosepsis population, using quantitative susceptibility differences.\n\nUse the following scientifically grounded bases and definitions:\n- An antibiogram susceptibility proportion for a species–drug pair is the fraction of tested isolates categorized as susceptible under Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints; it is estimated by the number of susceptible isolates divided by the total number tested.\n- The expected coverage probability of an empiric regimen against a syndrome with a species distribution is the prevalence-weighted sum of species-specific susceptibility probabilities.\n- When different specimen types (urine and blood) are available, a combined antibiogram pools data across specimen types by weighting susceptibility counts by their specimen-specific isolate counts.\n- For urosepsis, a fraction of patients have bloodstream infection at presentation; the achieved coverage probability of a regimen in the patient population can be modeled as a mixture of blood and urine susceptibility-weighted coverage according to the probability of bacteremia.\n\nConsider two candidate empiric agents, drug $\\mathrm{A}$ and drug $\\mathrm{B}$, for Enterobacterales urosepsis.

It is self-contained, consistent, and requires a quantitative analysis of antibiogram data to inform empiric therapy choices. All provided data and definitions are clear and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the absolute change in the true achieved coverage probability, $\\Delta$, that results from using a combined (pooled) antibiogram for decision-making instead of a separate urine-only antibiogram. This is defined as $\\Delta = C_{d^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pool}}}^{(\\mathrm{true})} - C_{d^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{urine}}}^{(\\mathrm{true})}$, where $d^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pool}}$ and $d^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{urine}}$ are the drugs selected based on the pooled and urine-only reporting methods, respectively.\n\nThe solution involves a sequence of calculations:\n1.

The calculated value $0.0502$ is exact. To express it with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero: $0.05020$.",
