A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst-order decay kinetics state that the rate of decrease of the concentration of a substance is directly proportional to its current concentration. For the viable virus concentration $C(t)$, this is expressed by the following linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive decay constant.\n\nTo find the expression for $C(t)$, we solve this differential equation. This is a separable equation, which we can write as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The concentration goes from its initial value $C(0)$ at time $t=0$ to a value $C(t)$ at a later time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} \\, dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration cannot be negative, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the general solution for first-order decay.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time at which the concentration has fallen to half of its initial value. Mathematically, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$.\n\nWe substitute this definition into the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nAssuming the initial concentration $C(0)$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $C(0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/2}))\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$ and $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the half-life of a first-order decay process.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for $t_{1/2}$ using the given decay constant $k = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe value of the natural logarithm of $2$ is approximately $0.693147...$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.10} \\ \\mathrm{h} = 6.93147 \\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 6.93 \\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\nThe calculated half-life of $6.93$ hours indicates that the quantity of viable Ebola virus on the contaminated surface decreases by $50\\%$ approximately every $7$ hours. This represents a significant environmental persistence. To interpret this in the context of fomite transmission risk, we consider the provided scenario.\n\nThe dose $D(t)$ of virus transferred to a person's mucous membrane via a single touch at time $t$ is given by $D(t) = C(t) \\times A \\times f$.\nAt time $t=0$, the initial dose is:\n$$\nD(0) = C(0) A f = (1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (10 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 100 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}\n$$\nThe probability of infection from this dose, $P_{\\text{inf}}(0)$, using the exponential model $P_{\\text{inf}}(D) = 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha D)$, is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}}(0) = 1 - \\exp(-(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}) \\times (100 \\ \\mathrm{PFU})) = 1 - \\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.095\n$$\nSo, an immediate touch carries approximately a $9.5\\%$ risk of infection.\n\nAfter one half-life, at $t = t_{1/2} \\approx 6.93 \\ \\mathrm{h}$, the concentration is $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. The dose transferred is halved:\n$$\nD(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(0) = 50 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}\n$$\nThe risk of infection after one half-life is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}}(t_{1/2}) = 1 - \\exp(-(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}) \\times (50 \\ \\mathrm{PFU})) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.049\n$$\nAfter approximately $7$ hours, the risk from a single touch is still substantial, at nearly $5\\%$.\n\nAfter two half-lives ($t \\approx 13.9 \\ \\mathrm{h}$), the concentration is $\\frac{1}{4}C(0)$, the dose is $25 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}$, and the infection risk is $1 - \\exp(-0.025) \\approx 0.025$, or $2.5\\%$.\n\nThe half-life of nearly $7$ hours implies that a contaminated surface remains a potent source of infection for an extended period. Even after a time equivalent to a typical work shift (e.g., $8$ hours), the viral load has not quite halved, and the risk of transmission via a single touch remains significant. This slow decay rate underscores the critical importance of immediate and thorough decontamination protocols for any surfaces potentially contaminated with Ebola virus in a clinical or laboratory setting to mitigate the high risk of fomite-mediated transmission. The persistence poses a continuous threat for many hours, well beyond the initial spill event.",

The intervention-modified matrix, $C^{(\\alpha)}(t)$, has elements:\n$$\nc^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t) = c_{ij}(t) \\quad \\text{if } i=G, j=G\n$$\n$$\nc^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t) = c_{ij}(t)(1-\\alpha) \\quad \\text{if } i=H \\text{ or } j=H\n$$\nThe next-generation operator maps the distribution of incident cases in one generation to the distribution of incident cases in the subsequent generation. The discrete analogue of this operator is the next-generation matrix, denoted $K$. The element $K_{ij}$ of this matrix represents the total expected number of secondary infections in group $i$ produced by a single infected individual in group $j$ throughout their entire infectious period.\n\nTo find $K_{ij}$, we integrate the rate of new infections over the full duration of infectiousness (all infection ages $\\tau$ from $0$ to $\\infty$):\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A_{ij}(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\beta\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t)\\, s_i(t)\\, w(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\n$$\nSince $\\beta$, $c^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t)$, and $s_i(t)$ are constant with respect to $\\tau$ in this formulation, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\beta\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t)\\, s_i(t) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\n$$\nBy definition, the generation-interval density is normalized, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = 1$. This simplifies the expression for the elements of the next-generation matrix to:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\beta\\, s_i(t)\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(t)\n$$\nThe next-generation matrix $K$ is therefore a $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose entries are:\n$$\nK = \\begin{pmatrix}\nK_{GG} & K_{GH} \\\\\nK_{HG} & K_{HH}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\beta\\, s_G(t)\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{GG}(t) & \\beta\\, s_G(t)\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{GH}(t) \\\\\n\\beta\\, s_H(t)\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{HG}(t) & \\beta\\, s_H(t)\\, c^{(\\alpha)}_{HH}(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be expressed compactly using matrix multiplication. Let $S(t) = \\text{diag}(s_G(t), s_H(t))$ be the diagonal matrix of susceptible fractions. Then:\n$$\nK = \\beta \\cdot S(t) \\cdot C^{(\\alpha)}(t)\n$$\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_t$, is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix $K$. The spectral radius, $\\rho(K)$, is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of $K$.\n$$\nR_t = \\rho(K) = \\rho\\left(\\beta \\cdot \\text{diag}(s_G(t), s_H(t)) \\cdot C^{(\\alpha)}(t)\\right)\n$$\nFor the computation, we are given the constant baseline parameters $\\beta = 1.1$ and the baseline contact matrix $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 1.8 \\end{pmatrix}$. For each test case, we are provided values for $s_G$, $s_H$, and $\\alpha$ at the time of evaluation. The algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Construct the intervention-modified contact matrix $C^{(\\alpha)}$ based on the given $\\alpha$ and the baseline $C$.\n    $$\n    C^{(\\alpha)} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{GG} & c_{GH}(1-\\alpha) \\\\ c_{HG}(1-\\alpha) & c_{HH}(1-\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n2.  Construct the next-generation matrix $K$ using the formula $K_{ij} = \\beta \\cdot s_i \\cdot c^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}$.\n    $$\n    K = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\beta s_G c_{GG} & \\beta s_G c_{GH}(1-\\alpha) \\\\\n    \\beta s_H c_{HG}(1-\\alpha) & \\beta s_H c_{HH}(1-\\alpha)\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n3.  Compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $K$. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, these are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(K)\\lambda + \\det(K) = 0$.\n4.  The largest absolute eigenvalue is $R_t$. Since $K$ is a non-negative matrix, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, its spectral radius is a real, non-negative eigenvalue.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case to find the corresponding value of $R_t$.",
