This exercise provides hands-on practice in a critical, real-world scenario: calculating the dose and preparation of Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) for a patient with multiple high-risk wounds.

            "problem": "An adult patient weighing $87.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ presents within $6\\,\\mathrm{hours}$ of multiple dog bites from a dog confirmed rabid on direct fluorescent antibody testing. The patient has received no prior rabies vaccination. Passive immunization with Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) is indicated at a weight-based dose of $20\\,\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{kg}$. The only HRIG product available at your facility is supplied at a concentration of $300\\,\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{mL}$. Infiltration of HRIG into and around all wounds is prioritized, limited by what is anatomically feasible; any remaining dose (if infiltration capacity is insufficient) would be administered intramuscularly at a site distant from any vaccine administration. HRIG may be diluted with $0.9\\%$ sodium chloride (normal saline) to increase the infiltration volume without changing the delivered international units.\n\nThe patient has the following wounds, with clinically judged maximal anatomically feasible infiltration volumes:\n- A $9\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ scalp laceration: up to $12\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ can be infiltrated along wound edges and into the track.\n- A $6 \\times 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ anterolateral thigh avulsion: up to $15\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ can be infiltrated into the wound bed and margins.\n- Four puncture wounds on the volar aspect of the right hand: up to $0.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ can be infiltrated into each puncture ($4$ punctures total).\n- A $3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ superficial forearm laceration: up to $3\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ can be infiltrated.\n\nAssume negligible dead space and no wastage. Plan to dilute the calculated HRIG dose with normal saline so that the final total volume exactly equals the sum of the anatomically feasible infiltration volumes across all wounds, thereby allowing complete wound infiltration and leaving no remainder for intramuscular administration.\n\nWhat volume of normal saline should be added to the calculated HRIG dose to achieve this target final infiltration volume? Express your answer in $\\mathrm{mL}$ and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires calculating the volume of normal saline needed to dilute a calculated dose of Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) to a specific total volume for infiltration into wounds. The solution is derived in four steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total required dose of HRIG.**\nThe patient's weight is given as $W = 87.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The prescribed dose rate for HRIG is $D_{rate} = 20\\,\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{kg}$. The total dose, $D_{total}$, is the product of the patient's weight and the dose rate.\n$$D_{total} = W \\times D_{rate}$$\n$$D_{total} = 87.5\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 20\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{IU}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 1750\\,\\mathrm{IU}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of the stock HRIG solution.**\nThe available HRIG product has a concentration of $C_{HRIG} = 300\\,\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{mL}$. The volume of the stock HRIG solution, $V_{HRIG}$, required to deliver the total dose is calculated by dividing the total dose by the concentration.\n$$V_{HRIG} = \\frac{D_{total}}{C_{HRIG}}$$\n$$V_{HRIG} = \\frac{1750\\,\\mathrm{IU}}{300\\,\\mathrm{IU}/\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{175}{30}\\,\\mathrm{mL} = \\frac{35}{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total anatomically feasible infiltration volume.**\nThe problem specifies the maximum infiltration volumes for all wounds. The total infiltration volume, $V_{infil,total}$, is the sum of these individual volumes.\n- Scalp laceration: $V_1 = 12\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Thigh avulsion: $V_2 = 15\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Hand puncture wounds: $4$ wounds at $0.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ each, for a total of $V_3 = 4 \\times 0.7\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 2.8\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Forearm laceration: $V_4 = 3\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n\nThe sum is:\n$$V_{infil,total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + V_4$$\n$$V_{infil,total} = 12\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 15\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 2.8\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 32.8\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of normal saline to be added.**\nThe problem states that the final prepared volume, $V_{final}$, must exactly equal the total anatomically feasible infiltration volume, $V_{infil,total}$.\n$$V_{final} = V_{infil,total} = 32.8\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThis final volume is the sum of the volume of the stock HRIG solution, $V_{HRIG}$, and the volume of the added normal saline diluent, $V_{NS}$.\n$$V_{final} = V_{HRIG} + V_{NS}$$\nTherefore, the volume of normal saline to be added is:\n$$V_{NS} = V_{final} - V_{HRIG}$$\nSubstituting the previously calculated values:\n$$V_{NS} = 32.8\\,\\mathrm{mL} - \\frac{35}{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we can work with decimals or fractions. Using fractions for precision:\n$$32.8 = \\frac{328}{10} = \\frac{164}{5}$$\n$$V_{NS} = \\frac{164}{5} - \\frac{35}{6} = \\frac{164 \\times 6}{30} - \\frac{35 \\times 5}{30} = \\frac{984 - 175}{30} = \\frac{809}{30}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal value:\n$$V_{NS} = \\frac{809}{30} \\approx 26.9666... \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $6$, $9$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$V_{NS} \\approx 26.97\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThus, $26.97\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of normal saline must be added to the calculated volume of HRIG to achieve the target final volume for complete wound infiltration.",
