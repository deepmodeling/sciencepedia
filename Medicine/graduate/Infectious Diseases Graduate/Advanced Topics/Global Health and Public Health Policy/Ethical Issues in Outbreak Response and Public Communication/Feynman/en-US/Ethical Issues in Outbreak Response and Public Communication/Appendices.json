            "problem": "A public health authority aims to communicate the ethically relevant utility of isolation in a transparent and proportional manner during an outbreak. Consider a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. The basic reproduction number $R_0$ is defined as the expected number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in the absence of interventions. The infectious period $T$ is the total duration over which the individual can transmit infection. Assume that, in the absence of intervention, the expected transmission potential per day is constant across the infectious period. Let isolation effectiveness $e$ be the proportionate reduction in transmission achievable on days the individual is isolated (for example, $e=0.7$ means transmission is reduced by $70\\%$ on those days). Define the ethically interpretable metric “secondary cases averted per isolation day” as the expected reduction in secondary cases attributable to isolating the person for one day during their infectious period, relative to no isolation.\n\nStarting from the core definitions above and the constant daily transmission potential assumption, derive an expression for the expected number of secondary cases averted per isolation day in terms of $R_0$, $T$, and $e$, and then compute its value for $R_0=2.5$, $T=7$ days, and $e=0.7$. Express your final answer as a decimal number with no units. If you choose to report an approximation, round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the \"secondary cases averted per isolation day\" and its subsequent calculation for a specific set of parameters.\n\nLet the given quantities be represented as follows:\n- $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, the total expected number of secondary infections from a single case in a susceptible population without interventions.\n- $T$ is the total duration of the infectious period, in days.\n- $e$ is the isolation effectiveness, defined as the proportionate reduction in transmission on days of isolation.\n\nThe problem states a key assumption: the expected transmission potential per day is constant throughout the infectious period $T$. Let us denote this constant daily transmission potential (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated per day) by the symbol $\\beta$.\n\nAccording to its definition, $R_0$ is the sum of transmissions over the entire infectious period. With a constant daily rate $\\beta$ over a period of $T$ days, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$R_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{T} \\beta = \\beta \\cdot T$$\nFrom this equation, we can solve for the daily transmission potential $\\beta$ in terms of the fundamental parameters $R_0$ and $T$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{R_0}{T}$$\nThis expression gives the expected number of new infections generated on any single day during the infectious period, assuming no control measures are in place.\n\nNext, we model the impact of isolation. The effectiveness $e$ represents the proportionate reduction in transmission. Thus, if a person is isolated on a given day, the number of new cases they generate on that day is reduced by a fraction $e$. The transmission that occurs on an isolated day is $\\beta \\cdot (1-e)$.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the \"expected number of secondary cases averted per isolation day.\" This is defined as the reduction in the expected number of secondary cases on a single day due to the implementation of isolation, compared to the baseline of no isolation. This can be calculated as the difference between the expected cases without isolation and the expected cases with isolation for a single day.\n\nLet $A$ represent the expected number of cases averted per day of isolation.\n$$A = (\\text{Expected cases on a day without isolation}) - (\\text{Expected cases on a day with isolation})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for daily transmission:\n$$A = \\beta - \\beta(1-e)$$\nWe can factor out $\\beta$ to simplify the expression:\n$$A = \\beta (1 - (1-e)) = \\beta (1 - 1 + e) = \\beta e$$\nThis shows that the number of cases averted per day is the daily transmission potential multiplied by the effectiveness of isolation.\n\nTo express $A$ in terms of the initial problem parameters ($R_0$, $T$, and $e$), we substitute the expression we derived for $\\beta$:\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{R_0}{T}\\right)e = \\frac{R_0 e}{T}$$\nThis is the general derived expression for the expected number of secondary cases averted per isolation day.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the value of this metric for the specific case where $R_0 = 2.5$, $T = 7$ days, and $e = 0.7$. We substitute these numerical values into our derived formula:\n$$A = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.7}{7}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the product in the numerator:\n$$2.5 \\times 0.7 = 1.75$$\nThen, we perform the division by $T$:\n$$A = \\frac{1.75}{7} = 0.25$$\nThe result is an exact decimal value. Thus, for the given parameters, the expected number of secondary cases averted per day of isolation is precisely $0.25$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology and probability theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe first step is to formally define the events and probabilities based on the problem statement. Let $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease (is infected), and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in probabilistic terms:\n- Prevalence, the prior probability of having the disease, is $p = P(D) = 0.05$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- Sensitivity ($\\text{Se}$) is the conditional probability of a positive test given that the disease is present: $\\text{Se} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.8$.\n- Specificity ($\\text{Sp}$) is the conditional probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent: $\\text{Sp} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.97$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the conditional probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\text{Sp} = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$$\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value ($\\text{PPV}$), which is defined as the conditional probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by summing over the mutually exclusive scenarios of being diseased or not diseased:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence into this expression:\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Se})(p) + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - p)$$\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for $\\text{PPV}$ yields the desired general formula:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} = \\frac{(\\text{Se})(p)}{(\\text{Se})(p) + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - p)}$$\nThis expression for $\\text{PPV}$ is derived solely from the core definitions and fundamental theorems as required.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the $\\text{PPV}$ using the provided data: $\\text{Se} = 0.8$, $\\text{Sp} = 0.97$, and $p = 0.05$.\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.8)(0.05)}{(0.8)(0.05) + (1 - 0.97)(1 - 0.05)}$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = (0.8)(0.05) = 0.04$$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$\\text{Denominator} = (0.8)(0.05) + (0.03)(0.95) = 0.04 + 0.0285 = 0.0685$$\nFinally, compute the $\\text{PPV}$:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.04}{0.0685} \\approx 0.5839416...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as specified, we get:\n$$\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.5839$$\n\nTo translate this into natural frequencies for public communication, we consider a hypothetical cohort of $10,000$ individuals being tested.\n- Number of infected individuals: $10,000 \\times p = 10,000 \\times 0.05 = 500$.\n- Number of uninfected individuals: $10,000 \\times (1 - p) = 10,000 \\times 0.95 = 9,500$.\n\nAmong the $500$ infected individuals, the number of true positive results is:\n$$\\text{True Positives} = 500 \\times \\text{Se} = 500 \\times 0.8 = 400$$\nAmong the $9,500$ uninfected individuals, the number of false positive results is:\n$$\\text{False Positives} = 9,500 \\times (1 - \\text{Sp}) = 9,500 \\times 0.03 = 285$$\n\nThe total number of positive test results is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$\\text{Total Positives} = 400 + 285 = 685$$\nThis analysis shows that out of $685$ people who test positive, only $400$ are actually infected. The remaining $285$ are false positives. The fraction of true positives among all positives, $\\frac{400}{685}$, correctly confirms our $\\text{PPV}$ calculation. The significant number of false positives ($285$ out of $685$, or approximately $41.6\\%$) highlights a critical communication challenge.\n\nBased on these natural frequencies, a single-sentence statement can be crafted to convey the risk transparently and responsibly. The goal is to manage expectations and direct behavior without causing undue alarm or complacency.\n\nCrafted statement: Given the characteristics of this screening test, a positive result indicates a need for further verification, as a notable number of positive findings are expected to be false positives, and only a follow-up confirmatory test can determine a true infection status.",

            "problem": "An outbreak of a novel respiratory pathogen produces severe hypoxemia in a subset of patients, for whom mechanical ventilation markedly increases survival probability. A regional health authority must allocate a limited stock of ventilators in real time and has publicly announced two candidate triage rules. Two patient subpopulations are relevant due to different baseline risks and social vulnerabilities: Group $A$ comprises patients from a historically marginalized community with high exposure risk and cumulative disadvantage; Group $B$ comprises patients from the remainder of the population. Let $N_{A} = 150$ and $N_{B} = 100$ denote the numbers of patients who need ventilation. The number of available ventilators is $V = 120$.\n\nClinical survival probabilities are as follows, conditional on a patient’s group and whether a ventilator is allocated:\n- For Group $A$, survival probability without a ventilator is $p_{0A} = 0.55$ and with a ventilator is $p_{1A} = 0.85$.\n- For Group $B$, survival probability without a ventilator is $p_{0B} = 0.35$ and with a ventilator is $p_{1B} = 0.95$.\n\nAssume each patient’s survival can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with the group- and treatment-specific survival probability described above, and assume that the expected number of survivors is the sum of individual survival probabilities. Define the expected lives saved by an allocation as the expected number of survivors under that allocation minus the expected number of survivors if no ventilators were used at all.\n\nConsider two triage rules:\n1. Rule $U$ (utilitarian maximization): allocate ventilators to maximize the expected lives saved, subject only to the resource constraint $V$.\n2. Rule $F$ (fairness with trust-preserving constraint): to honor a publicly communicated commitment aimed at maintaining community trust and perceived legitimacy, allocate at least a fraction $q = 0.40$ of the ventilators to Group $A$, and then allocate the remainder to maximize expected lives saved subject to this constraint.\n\nCompute the expected lives saved under Rule $U$ and under Rule $F$, and then compute the difference $\\Delta = (\\text{expected lives saved under Rule } U) - (\\text{expected lives saved under Rule } F)$.

            "solution": "Let $v_A$ and $v_B$ be the number of ventilators allocated to Group A and Group B, respectively. The constraints on any allocation are:\n$v_A + v_B \\le V$\n$0 \\le v_A \\le N_A$\n$0 \\le v_B \\le N_B$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$v_A + v_B \\le 120$\n$0 \\le v_A \\le 150$\n$0 \\le v_B \\le 100$\n\nThe objective is to maximize the \"expected lives saved\". First, we formalize this quantity. The total expected number of survivors for an allocation $(v_A, v_B)$ is given by:\n$$E(v_A, v_B) = [v_A p_{1A} + (N_A - v_A) p_{0A}] + [v_B p_{1B} + (N_B - v_B) p_{0B}]$$\nThe expected number of survivors if no ventilators are used ($v_A=0, v_B=0$) is the baseline, $E_0$:\n$$E_0 = N_A p_{0A} + N_B p_{0B}$$\nThe expected lives saved, $L(v_A, v_B)$, is the difference:\n$$L(v_A, v_B) = E(v_A, v_B) - E_0$$\n$$L(v_A, v_B) = [v_A p_{1A} + N_A p_{0A} - v_A p_{0A}] + [v_B p_{1B} + N_B p_{0B} - v_B p_{0B}] - (N_A p_{0A} + N_B p_{0B})$$\n$$L(v_A, v_B) = v_A (p_{1A} - p_{0A}) + v_B (p_{1B} - p_{0B})$$\nThis shows that maximizing expected lives saved is equivalent to maximizing the weighted sum of allocated ventilators, where the weights are the marginal survival benefits of a ventilator for each group. Let's calculate these marginal benefits, denoted $\\Delta p_A$ and $\\Delta p_B$.\n\nMarginal survival benefit for Group A:\n$$\\Delta p_A = p_{1A} - p_{0A} = 0.85 - 0.55 = 0.30$$\nMarginal survival benefit for Group B:\n$$\\Delta p_B = p_{1B} - p_{0B} = 0.95 - 0.35 = 0.60$$\nThe objective function is thus to maximize $L(v_A, v_B) = 0.30 v_A + 0.60 v_B$. Since we are maximizing a positive quantity, we will use all available ventilators, so $v_A + v_B = 120$.\n\n**Analysis of Rule $U$ (Utilitarian Maximization)**\nTo maximize $L(v_A, v_B) = 0.30 v_A + 0.60 v_B$, we should prioritize allocating ventilators to the group with the higher marginal survival benefit. Since $\\Delta p_B = 0.60 > \\Delta p_A = 0.30$, we should allocate as many ventilators as possible to Group B.\nGroup B has $N_B = 100$ patients needing ventilators.\nWe allocate $v_B^U = \\min(V, N_B) = \\min(120, 100) = 100$ ventilators to Group B.\nThe remaining ventilators are $V - v_B^U = 120 - 100 = 20$.\nThese are allocated to Group A. So, $v_A^U = 20$. This is a valid allocation as $v_A^U = 20 \\le N_A = 150$.\nThe allocation under Rule $U$ is $(v_A^U, v_B^U) = (20, 100)$.\n\nThe expected lives saved under Rule $U$ is:\n$$L_U = 0.30 v_A^U + 0.60 v_B^U = (0.30)(20) + (0.60)(100) = 6.0 + 60.0 = 66.0$$\n\n**Analysis of Rule $F$ (Fairness with Trust-Preserving Constraint)**\nRule $F$ imposes an additional constraint: at least a fraction $q=0.40$ of the ventilators must be allocated to Group A.\nMinimum ventilators for Group A: $v_A \\ge q \\times V = 0.40 \\times 120 = 48$.\nThe optimization problem for Rule $F$ is to maximize $L(v_A, v_B) = 0.30 v_A + 0.60 v_B$ subject to:\n1. $v_A + v_B = 120$\n2. $v_A \\ge 48$\n3. $0 \\le v_A \\le 150$\n4. $0 \\le v_B \\le 100$\n\nTo maximize the objective function, we still wish to make $v_B$ as large as possible, as its coefficient is larger. The constraint $v_A \\ge 48$ sets an upper bound on $v_B$:\n$v_B = 120 - v_A \\le 120 - 48 = 72$.\nSince $v_B = 72$ is less than the total need of Group B ($N_B=100$), this is a feasible value for $v_B$.\nTherefore, the optimal allocation under Rule $F$ is to set $v_A$ to its minimum required value to free up the maximum number of ventilators for the more \"efficient\" Group B.\nThe allocation is $v_A^F = 48$ and $v_B^F = 72$.\nThe allocation under Rule $F$ is $(v_A^F, v_B^F) = (48, 72)$.\n\nThe expected lives saved under Rule $F$ is:\n$$L_F = 0.30 v_A^F + 0.60 v_B^F = (0.30)(48) + (0.60)(72) = 14.4 + 43.2 = 57.6$$\n\n**Calculation of the Difference $\\Delta$**\nThe difference in expected lives saved is:\n$$\\Delta = L_U - L_F = 66.0 - 57.6 = 8.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta = 8.400$$\n\n**Ethical Trade-offs**\nThe two rules represent a fundamental conflict in public health ethics between utilitarianism and principles of justice or equity.\n\nRule $U$ is purely utilitarian. Its sole objective is to maximize the aggregate health outcome, in this case, the number of lives saved. This approach is often defended on grounds of efficiency and impartiality, as it treats every potential life saved as having equal value, regardless of the person's group identity. However, by focusing only on the marginal benefit ($\\Delta p$), it directs resources to the group for whom they are most effective. In this scenario, it heavily favors Group B ($100$ ventilators) over Group A ($20$ ventilators), despite Group A having a larger number of patients in need ($150$). If Group A is also a historically marginalized population, this outcome could be seen as perpetuating systemic disadvantage and would likely be perceived as unjust.\n\nRule $F$ represents a form of constrained utilitarianism or equity-weighted consequentialism. It begins with a non-utilitarian fairness constraint—that the disadvantaged Group A must receive at least a certain proportion of the resource ($40\\%$)—before optimizing for lives saved. This rule explicitly trades some amount of overall efficiency for a more equitable distribution. The cost of this trade-off is precisely the quantity $\\Delta = 8.4$, which can be interpreted as the number of expected lives \"lost\" to achieve the fairness goal. The rationale for Rule $F$ lies in principles of social justice, which may demand that allocation systems not exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, and in the pragmatic need to maintain public trust. An allocation perceived as fair, even if less than maximally efficient, may be critical for the legitimacy of the health authority and for securing public cooperation, which itself has significant health benefits. The conflict between Rule $U$ and Rule $F$ is thus a trade-off between maximizing total lives saved and ensuring a distribution of life-saving resources that is defensible on grounds of justice and maintains the trust of all communities.",
