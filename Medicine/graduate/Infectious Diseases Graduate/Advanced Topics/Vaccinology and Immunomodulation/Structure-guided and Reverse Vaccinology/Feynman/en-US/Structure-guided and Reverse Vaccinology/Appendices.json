Formalization of Scoring Functions**\n\nA. **Per-Residue Conservation Score ($C_j$)**:\nConstraint $2$ requires a dimensionless quantity $C_j \\in [0, 1]$ that is $1$ for perfect conservation ($H_j = 0$) and $0$ for maximal diversity ($H_j = H_{\\max}$). A linear mapping is the simplest function that satisfies these conditions:\n$$C_j = 1 - \\frac{H_j}{H_{\\max}}$$\nwhere $H_j = -\\sum_{a} p_{j,a} \\ln(p_{j,a})$ and $H_{\\max} = \\ln(20)$. This function is strictly decreasing as $H_j$ increases from $0$ to $H_{\\max}$.\n\nB. **Per-Residue Fitness-Cost Score ($f_j$)**:\nConstraint $3$ requires a dimensionless function $f_j$ of $\\Delta\\Delta G_j$ that is $0$ at $\\Delta\\Delta G_j=0$, approaches $1$ as $\\Delta\\Delta G_j \\to \\infty$, is strictly increasing, and is consistent with the Boltzmann factor's small-change linearization. The Boltzmann factor implies that the probability of a state is related to $\\exp(-E/k_B T)$. A function modeling a probability-like score derived from an energy barrier $\\Delta\\Delta G_j$ is naturally of the form $1 - \\exp(-\\Delta\\Delta G_j / \\text{energy scale})$. The required energy scale is given by $RT$. Thus, we define:\n$$f_j = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_j}{RT}\\right)$$\nThis function satisfies all constraints:\n- $f_j(\\Delta\\Delta G_j=0) = 1 - \\exp(0) = 0$.\n- As $\\Delta\\Delta G_j \\to \\infty$, the exponential term goes to $0$, so $f_j \\to 1$.\n- The derivative $\\frac{df_j}{d(\\Delta\\Delta G_j)} = \\frac{1}{RT}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_j}{RT}\\right)$ is always positive, so $f_j$ is strictly increasing.\n- For small $\\Delta\\Delta G_j/RT$, using the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$, we have $f_j \\approx 1 - (1 - \\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_j}{RT}) = \\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_j}{RT}$, which is a linear function of $\\Delta\\Delta G_j$.\nThe product $RT$ is calculated as $RT = (0.001987\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 0.61597\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nC. **Epitope-Level and Composite Scores**:\nPer constraint $4$, the epitope-level scores for conservation ($C_E$) and fitness cost ($F_E$) are the arithmetic means of the per-residue scores for an epitope $E$ of length $L$:\n$$C_E = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} C_j \\quad , \\quad F_E = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} f_j$$\nPer constraint $5$, the composite score $S_E$ is a symmetric, multiplicative aggregation. The simplest such function is the product of the two epitope-level scores:\n$$S_E = C_E \\cdot F_E$$\nThis function maps $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ and is strictly increasing with either factor for non-zero values of the other.\n\n**2. Calculation of Epitope Scores**\n\nWe now apply this framework to the data for each epitope. We use $H_{\\max} = \\ln(20) \\approx 2.9957$ and $RT = 0.61597\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\n**Epitope 1 ($L_1 = 3$)**\n- Residue $1.1$: $H_{1,1} = -(0.85\\ln(0.85) + 0.1\\ln(0.1) + 0.05\\ln(0.05)) \\approx 0.5183$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{1,1} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{1,1} = 1 - 0.5183/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.8270$.\n  $f_{1,1} = 1 - \\exp(-3.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.9923$.\n- Residue $1.2$: $H_{1,2} = -(0.5\\ln(0.5) + 0.5\\ln(0.5)) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{1,2} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{1,2} = 1 - \\ln(2)/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.7686$.\n  $f_{1,2} = 1 - \\exp(-1.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.8028$.\n- Residue $1.3$: $H_{1,3} = -(0.95\\ln(0.95) + 0.05\\ln(0.05)) \\approx 0.1985$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{1,3} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{1,3} = 1 - 0.1985/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.9337$.\n  $f_{1,3} = 1 - \\exp(-5.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.9997$.\n- Epitope-level scores:\n  $C_{E1} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.8270 + 0.7686 + 0.9337) \\approx 0.8431$.\n  $F_{E1} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.9923 + 0.8028 + 0.9997) \\approx 0.9316$.\n- Composite score:\n  $S_{E1} = C_{E1} \\cdot F_{E1} \\approx 0.8431 \\times 0.9316 \\approx 0.7853$.\n\n**Epitope 2 ($L_2 = 2$)**\n- Residue $2.1$: $H_{2,1} = -(0.6\\ln(0.6) + 0.2\\ln(0.2) + 0.2\\ln(0.2)) \\approx 0.9503$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{2,1} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{2,1} = 1 - 0.9503/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.6828$.\n  $f_{2,1} = 1 - \\exp(-2.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.9611$.\n- Residue $2.2$: $H_{2,2} = -(0.4\\ln(0.4) + 0.3\\ln(0.3) + 0.2\\ln(0.2) + 0.1\\ln(0.1)) \\approx 1.2799$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{2,2} = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{2,2} = 1 - 1.2799/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.5727$.\n  $f_{2,2} = 1 - \\exp(-6.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.9999$.\n- Epitope-level scores:\n  $C_{E2} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.6828 + 0.5727) \\approx 0.6278$.\n  $F_{E2} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.9611 + 0.9999) \\approx 0.9805$.\n- Composite score:\n  $S_{E2} = C_{E2} \\cdot F_{E2} \\approx 0.6278 \\times 0.9805 \\approx 0.6156$.\n\n**Epitope 3 ($L_3 = 4$)**\n- Residue $3.1$: $H_{3,1} = -\\sum_{i=1}^5 0.2\\ln(0.2) = \\ln(5) \\approx 1.6094$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{3,1} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{3,1} = 1 - \\ln(5)/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.4628$.\n  $f_{3,1} = 1 - \\exp(-4.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.9985$.\n- Residue $3.2$: $H_{3,2} = -(0.99\\ln(0.99) + 0.01\\ln(0.01)) \\approx 0.0560$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{3,2} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{3,2} = 1 - 0.0560/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.9813$.\n  $f_{3,2} = 1 - \\exp(-1.0/0.61597) \\approx 0.8028$.\n- Residue $3.3$: $H_{3,3} = -(0.7\\ln(0.7) + 0.3\\ln(0.3)) \\approx 0.6109$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{3,3} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{3,3} = 1 - 0.6109/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.7961$.\n  $f_{3,3} = 1 - \\exp(-1.5/0.61597) \\approx 0.9124$.\n- Residue $3.4$: $H_{3,4} = -(0.9\\ln(0.9) + 0.05\\ln(0.05) + 0.05\\ln(0.05)) \\approx 0.3944$. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{3,4} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n  $C_{3,4} = 1 - 0.3944/\\ln(20) \\approx 0.8683$.\n  $f_{3,4} = 1 - \\exp(-3.5/0.61597) \\approx 0.9966$.\n- Epitope-level scores:\n  $C_{E3} = \\frac{1}{4}(0.4628 + 0.9813 + 0.7961 + 0.8683) \\approx 0.7771$.\n  $F_{E3} = \\frac{1}{4}(0.9985 + 0.8028 + 0.9124 + 0.9966) \\approx 0.9276$.\n- Composite score:\n  $S_{E3} = C_{E3} \\cdot F_{E3} \\approx 0.7771 \\times 0.9276 \\approx 0.7209$.\n\n**3.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive and calculate the requested quantity. The concepts of solvent-accessible surface area, buried surface area, and the biophysical principles of protein-protein interactions are standard in structural biology and biochemistry. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for the described system. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main outputs: first, a derivation and calculation of the buried surface area (BSA) at the antibody-antigen interface, and second, an interpretation of the nature of this interface.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Buried Surface Area**\n\nThe solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), denoted $S$, of a molecule is defined as the locus of the center of a probe sphere (typically modeling a water molecule, here with a radius of $1.4\\ \\text{\\AA}$) as it rolls over the van der Waals surface of the molecule. It represents the surface area of a biomolecule that is accessible to the solvent.\n\nLet the isolated antibody be component $A$ and the isolated antigen be component $B$. Their respective solvent-accessible surface areas are given as:\n$S_{A} = 18{,}250\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$\n$S_{B} = 24{,}670\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$\n\nWhen the two molecules are separate in solution, the total solvent-accessible surface area of the system is simply the sum of their individual areas:\n$$S_{\\text{total, unbound}} = S_{A} + S_{B}$$\n\nWhen the antibody $A$ and antigen $B$ associate to form the complex $AB$, the surfaces that come into contact are no longer accessible to the solvent. This reduction in solvent-accessible surface area is termed the buried surface area (BSA), sometimes denoted as $\\Delta S_{\\text{ASA}}$. The SASA of the resulting complex, $S_{AB}$, is thus less than the sum of the individual areas. The given SASA for the complex is:\n$S_{AB} = 41{,}320\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$\n\nFrom first principles, the buried surface area is the difference between the total SASA of the unbound components and the SASA of the bound complex. This is because the BSA represents the exact amount of surface area that was shielded from the solvent upon formation of the interface.\nThe derivation is as follows:\n$$BSA = S_{\\text{total, unbound}} - S_{\\text{complex}}$$\n$$BSA = (S_{A} + S_{B}) - S_{AB}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values to calculate the BSA for this specific antibody-antigen interaction.\n$$S_{A} + S_{B} = 18{,}250\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2} + 24{,}670\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2} = 42{,}920\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$$\n$$BSA = 42{,}920\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2} - S_{AB} = 42{,}920\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2} - 41{,}320\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$$\n$$BSA = 1{,}600\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $1{,}600$. To express this with four significant figures, it is written in scientific notation as $1.600 \\times 10^{3}$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of the Interaction**\n\nThe problem asks whether the interaction is more likely dominated by shape complementarity or by specific chemistry. We can assess this by analyzing the calculated BSA and the provided chemical details of the interface.\n\n1.  **Shape Complementarity**: This refers to the geometric match between the surfaces of the two interacting proteins. High shape complementarity leads to a large contact area and efficient packing, which maximizes favorable van der Waals interactions and buries a significant amount of surface area. The burial of nonpolar (hydrophobic) surface patches away from water is a major thermodynamic driving force for protein association, known as the hydrophobic effect. A large BSA is a hallmark of high shape complementarity. The calculated BSA of $1{,}600\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$ is a substantial value for a protein-protein interface and is typical for high-affinity antibody-antigen interactions, which are known to have excellent shape complementarity. This large buried surface, along with the explicit mention of $50$ hydrophobic contacts, suggests a strong contribution from the hydrophobic effect, which is a direct consequence of geometric fit.\n\n2.  **Specific Chemistry**: This refers to directional, short-range, and highly-specific interactions, primarily hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (charged-charged hydrogen bonds). These interactions are enthalpically favorable and are critical for determining binding specificity—that is, ensuring the antibody binds to its correct target antigen and not to other molecules. The interface is described as having $10$ hydrogen bonds and $3$ salt bridges, for a total of $13$ specific polar interactions.\n\nTo contextualize this number, we can calculate the density of these specific interactions per unit of buried surface area.\n$$\\text{Area per specific interaction} = \\frac{BSA}{\\text{Number of H-bonds} + \\text{Number of Salt Bridges}}$$\n$$\\text{Area per specific interaction} = \\frac{1{,}600\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}}{10 + 3} = \\frac{1{,}600\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}}{13} \\approx 123\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$$\nThis means there is, on average, one specific polar interaction for every $123\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$ of buried surface. Studies of protein-protein interfaces have shown that this density is quite typical. For example, a commonly cited average is one hydrogen bond for every $170 \\pm 70\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$ of buried surface. The observed value of $123\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$ per interaction falls within this expected range. The density of specific chemical contacts is therefore not anomalously high.\n\n**Conclusion of Interpretation**:\nBoth shape complementarity and specific chemistry are indispensable for effective antibody-antigen recognition. However, the question asks which is more *dominant*. The BSA of $1{,}600\\ \\text{\\AA}^{2}$ is large, indicating a very well-matched interface, which powerfully drives the association through the hydrophobic effect. The number of specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, while critical for specificity, is standard for an interface of this size. Therefore, the dominant feature of this interaction is arguably the extensive surface burial, which is a manifestation of exceptional shape complementarity. The specific chemical interactions act to \"lock in\" the correct orientation and confer the exquisite specificity, but the overall energetic driving force is arguably led by the large-scale geometric fit.",

A key goal of structure-guided design is to introduce modifications, such as disulfide bonds, to lock the antigen in its desired conformation. This practice  allows you to step into the role of a protein designer, using an empirical energy function to calculate the net stabilizing effect ($\\Delta\\Delta G$) of such an engineering choice and assess its impact on structural integrity.",

            "problem": "A structure-guided immunogen design effort in reverse vaccinology identifies a conformational epitope on a viral fusion glycoprotein that is metastable in the prefusion state. To lock the epitope in its prefusion conformation, a disulfide bond is engineered between two side chains. In coarse-grained empirical models of protein stabilization, the Gibbs free energy change upon mutation, denoted by $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is approximated as the sum of physically motivated contributions: a baseline enthalpic benefit for forming the disulfide, harmonic penalties for deviations from ideal bond geometry, a periodic penalty for dihedral misalignment, a linear solvation term proportional to the change in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), a quadratic penalty for deformation of the epitope quantified by backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and a steric clash penalty proportional to the number of atom-atom overlaps.\n\nStarting from the definitions of Gibbs free energy and the widely used quadratic (for small deviations) and periodic (for dihedral torsions) approximations in molecular mechanics, derive an expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$ as an additive combination of the stated contributions, with the following weights and measured quantities for the engineered disulfide:\n- Baseline disulfide enthalpy: $E_{\\mathrm{SS}} = -2.0$ kcal mol$^{-1}$.\n- Distance mismatch: optimal span $d_0 = 3.9$ \\AA, measured span $d = 4.2$ \\AA, weight $k_d = 1.2$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$.\n- Angular mismatch: optimal angle $\\theta_0 = 2.0$ radians, measured angle $\\theta = 2.1$ radians, weight $k_{\\theta} = 0.8$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ rad$^{-2}$.\n- Dihedral mismatch: optimal dihedral $\\phi_0 = \\pi$ radians, measured dihedral $\\phi = \\pi + 0.3$ radians, weight $k_{\\phi} = 0.6$ kcal mol$^{-1}$.\n- Solvation: SASA reduction upon disulfide introduction $\\Delta \\mathrm{SASA} = 150$ \\AA$^{2}$ (defined as positive when area is buried), solvation coefficient $k_s = -0.004$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$.\n- Epitope deformation: backbone heavy-atom epitope RMSD $\\mathrm{RMSD} = 0.65$ \\AA, weight $k_r = 3.0$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$.\n- Steric clashes: $n_{\\mathrm{clash}} = 0$, penalty $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 1.5$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ per clash.\n\nAssume that the harmonic penalties are quadratic in deviations from the ideal geometry and that the dihedral penalty is proportional to $1 - \\cos(\\Delta \\phi)$, where $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi - \\phi_0$. For the purposes of structural integrity, consider the conformational epitope to be preserved if the backbone heavy-atom epitope RMSD satisfies $\\mathrm{RMSD} \\leq 1.0$ \\AA.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive, from the stated physical bases and approximations, an additive expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$ in terms of the given variables and weights.\n2.

            "solution": "The problem provides a set of parameters and functional forms to construct an empirical model for the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, upon introducing a stabilizing disulfide bond into a protein immunogen. The task is to first derive the functional form of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ based on the described physical contributions and then to calculate its numerical value.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is required.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The use of a simplified, additive energy function with terms for bond geometry, dihedral torsions, solvation, structural deformation (RMSD), and steric clashes is a standard and well-established methodology in computational structural biology and protein design. The functional forms—quadratic penalties for small deviations (harmonic approximation) and a cosine-based periodic potential for dihedral angles—are directly derived from molecular mechanics force fields. The parameter values are within physically plausible ranges for such a coarse-grained model.\nThe problem is well-posed, providing all necessary variables, constants, and functional relationships required to compute a unique numerical answer. The language is objective and the definitions are clear, for example, specifying that a positive $\\Delta \\mathrm{SASA}$ represents a reduction in solvent-accessible surface area. There are no internal contradictions, missing data, or ambiguities. The problem is a straightforward application of a defined biophysical model and is therefore valid.\n\nThe total change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is given as the sum of seven distinct contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{SS}} + \\Delta G_{d} + \\Delta G_{\\theta} + \\Delta G_{\\phi} + \\Delta G_{s} + \\Delta G_{r} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nEach term is derived from the problem description as follows:\n\n1.  **Baseline Disulfide Enthalpy ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{SS}}$)**: This is a constant enthalpic benefit for forming the disulfide bond.\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{SS}} = E_{\\mathrm{SS}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Distance Mismatch Penalty ($\\Delta G_{d}$)**: This is a harmonic penalty, quadratic in the deviation of the measured bond span ($d$) from the ideal span ($d_0$).\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{d} = k_d (d - d_0)^2\n    $$\n\n3.  **Angular Mismatch Penalty ($\\Delta G_{\\theta}$)**: This is also a harmonic penalty, quadratic in the deviation of the measured angle ($\\theta$) from the ideal angle ($\\theta_0$).\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\theta} = k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2\n    $$\n\n4.  **Dihedral Mismatch Penalty ($\\Delta G_{\\phi}$)**: This is a periodic potential given by the form $1 - \\cos(\\Delta \\phi)$, where $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi - \\phi_0$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\phi} = k_{\\phi} (1 - \\cos(\\phi - \\phi_0))\n    $$\n\n5.  **Solvation Energy ($\\Delta G_{s}$)**: This term is linear with respect to the change in solvent-accessible surface area ($\\Delta \\mathrm{SASA}$).\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{s} = k_s \\Delta \\mathrm{SASA}\n    $$\n    A negative $k_s$ and positive $\\Delta \\mathrm{SASA}$ (for burial) correctly yield a negative (favorable) energy change.\n\n6.  **Epitope Deformation Penalty ($\\Delta G_{r}$)**: This is a quadratic penalty based on the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the epitope.\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{r} = k_r (\\mathrm{RMSD})^2\n    $$\n\n7.  **Steric Clash Penalty ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cl}}$)**: This term is proportional to the number of steric clashes ($n_{\\mathrm{clash}}$).\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cl}} = k_{\\mathrm{cl}} n_{\\mathrm{clash}}\n    $$\n\nCombining these terms gives the full expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = E_{\\mathrm{SS}} + k_d (d - d_0)^2 + k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 + k_{\\phi} (1 - \\cos(\\phi - \\phi_0)) + k_s \\Delta \\mathrm{SASA} + k_r (\\mathrm{RMSD})^2 + k_{\\mathrm{cl}} n_{\\mathrm{clash}}\n$$\nThis completes the first task of deriving the additive expression.\n\nFor the second task, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- $E_{\\mathrm{SS}} = -2.0$ kcal mol$^{-1}$\n- $k_d = 1.2$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$, $d = 4.2$ \\AA, $d_0 = 3.9$ \\AA\n- $k_{\\theta} = 0.8$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ rad$^{-2}$, $\\theta = 2.1$ rad, $\\theta_0 = 2.0$ rad\n- $k_{\\phi} = 0.6$ kcal mol$^{-1}$, $\\phi = \\pi + 0.3$ rad, $\\phi_0 = \\pi$ rad\n- $k_s = -0.004$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$, $\\Delta \\mathrm{SASA} = 150$ \\AA$^{2}$\n- $k_r = 3.0$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-2}$, $\\mathrm{RMSD} = 0.65$ \\AA\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 1.5$ kcal mol$^{-1}$, $n_{\\mathrm{clash}} = 0$\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{SS}} = -2.0 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{d} = (1.2) \\cdot (4.2 - 3.9)^2 = 1.2 \\cdot (0.3)^2 = 1.2 \\cdot 0.09 = 0.108 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\theta} = (0.8) \\cdot (2.1 - 2.0)^2 = 0.8 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.8 \\cdot 0.01 = 0.008 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\phi} = (0.6) \\cdot (1 - \\cos((\\pi + 0.3) - \\pi)) = 0.6 \\cdot (1 - \\cos(0.3)) \\approx 0.6 \\cdot (1 - 0.955336) = 0.6 \\cdot 0.044664 = 0.0267984 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{s} = (-0.004) \\cdot (150) = -0.6 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{r} = (3.0) \\cdot (0.65)^2 = 3.0 \\cdot 0.4225 = 1.2675 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cl}} = (1.5) \\cdot 0 = 0 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\nSumming these contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = -2.0 + 0.108 + 0.008 + 0.0267984 - 0.6 + 1.2675 + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = (-2.0 - 0.6) + (0.108 + 0.008 + 0.0267984 + 1.2675)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = -2.6 + 1.4102984\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = -1.1897016 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx -1.190 \\, \\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe negative value of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ indicates that the engineered disulfide bond is predicted to be stabilizing under this model.\n\nFinally, we assess whether the epitope conformation is preserved. The criterion for preservation is $\\mathrm{RMSD} \\leq 1.0$ \\AA. The measured value is $\\mathrm{RMSD} = 0.65$ \\AA. Since $0.65 \\leq 1.0$, the epitope conformation is considered to be preserved.
