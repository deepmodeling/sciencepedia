The terms MIC, hemolysis ($HC_{10}$), and Selectivity Index (SI) are fundamental and well-defined metrics used to evaluate preclinical candidates. The provided numerical values for molecular mass, MIC, and $HC_{10}$ are physically and biologically plausible for a peptide-peptoid hybrid.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, complete, and verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Selectivity Index ($\\mathrm{SI}$) is defined as the ratio of the concentration of a compound that induces a specific level of host cell toxicity to the concentration that produces the desired antimicrobial effect. A higher $\\mathrm{SI}$ is desirable, as it indicates a larger therapeutic window. Based on the problem's definition, the $\\mathrm{SI}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{\\text{Toxicity Concentration}}{\\text{Efficacy Concentration}} = \\frac{HC_{10}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} $$\nFor this ratio to be a dimensionless quantity, both concentrations must be expressed in the same units. The given values are $\\mathrm{MIC} = 4.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (a molar concentration) and $HC_{10} = 0.240\\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$ (a mass concentration). We must convert one to match the units of the other. We will convert the $HC_{10}$ value from mass concentration to molar concentration.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Molecular Mass, $M = 2.80 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}$\n- Toxicity Concentration, $HC_{10} = 0.240\\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Efficacy Concentration, $\\mathrm{MIC} = 4.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we convert the mass concentration $HC_{10}$ into units of $\\mathrm{mol/L}$. We begin by converting $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$ to $\\mathrm{g/L}$. Noting that $1\\ \\mathrm{mg} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{L}$:\n$$ HC_{10} = 0.240\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.240\\ \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}}{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{L}} = 0.240\\ \\mathrm{g/L} $$\nNext, we convert this mass concentration ($\\mathrm{g/L}$) to molar concentration ($\\mathrm{mol/L}$) using the molecular mass $M$. The relationship is:\n$$ \\text{Molar Concentration (mol/L)} = \\frac{\\text{Mass Concentration (g/L)}}{\\text{Molecular Mass (g/mol)}} $$\nApplying this to $HC_{10}$:\n$$ HC_{10} \\text{ (in mol/L)} = \\frac{0.240\\ \\mathrm{g/L}}{2.80 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}} $$\nThe efficacy concentration, MIC, is given in micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). To maintain consistency, we will convert the molar concentration of $HC_{10}$ to $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The conversion factor is $1\\ \\mathrm{mol/L} = 10^{6}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$ HC_{10} \\text{ (in } \\mu\\mathrm{M)} = \\left( \\frac{0.240}{2.80 \\times 10^{3}} \\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{10^{6}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mol/L}} $$\n$$ HC_{10} \\text{ (in } \\mu\\mathrm{M)} = \\frac{0.240 \\times 10^{6}}{2.80 \\times 10^{3}}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\nNow, we can calculate the dimensionless Selectivity Index using the common unit of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{HC_{10}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.240 \\times 10^{6}}{2.80 \\times 10^{3}}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{4.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{0.240 \\times 10^{6}}{(4.0) \\times (2.80 \\times 10^{3})} = \\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{5}}{11.2 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{240}{11.2} $$\nLet's express the calculation in fractional form to maintain precision:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{240}{11.2} = \\frac{2400}{112} $$\nDividing both numerator and denominator by common factors:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{2400 \\div 8}{112 \\div 8} = \\frac{300}{14} = \\frac{150}{7} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{150}{7} \\approx 21.42857... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} \\approx 21.43 $$\nThe advancement threshold is given as $\\mathrm{SI}_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20$.

We use the relationship $A(t) = V_d C(t)$. Since the volume of distribution $V_d$ is a constant, we can differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(V_d C(t)) \\implies \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\nV_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
