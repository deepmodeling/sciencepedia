It moves beyond a test's intrinsic properties, like sensitivity and specificity, to calculate the probabilities that truly matter at the bedside: the Positive and Negative Predictive Values ($PPV$ and $NPV$). By applying Bayes' theorem to the classic \"halo sign\" on CT scans, you will learn how pre-test probability shapes the meaning of a test result .",

            "problem": "A cohort of immunocompromised adults with prolonged neutropenia in a hematologic malignancy ward is undergoing chest Computed Tomography (CT) to assess for invasive aspergillosis (IA). The CT halo sign is treated as a binary diagnostic test for IA. In this population, assume the following are well-established from prior studies: sensitivity $Se = 0.80$, specificity $Sp = 0.60$, and the point prevalence of IA (the prior probability of disease) $p = P(D) = 0.25$, where $D$ denotes the event that a patient truly has IA. Let $T+$ and $T-$ denote a positive and negative CT halo sign, respectively. Using the foundational definitions of sensitivity and specificity, the law of total probability, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the expressions for the positive predictive value $PPV = P(D \\mid T+)$ and the negative predictive value $NPV = P(\\overline{D} \\mid T-)$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$, and then evaluate these expressions numerically for the given values. Express both $PPV$ and $NPV$ as decimals (do not use the percentage symbol), and round your final numerical answers to four significant figures. Report your final numerical answers in the order $PPV$, $NPV$.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Sensitivity of the CT halo sign: $Se = P(T+ \\mid D) = 0.80$\n- Specificity of the CT halo sign: $Sp = P(T- \\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.60$\n- Prevalence (prior probability) of invasive aspergillosis (IA): $p = P(D) = 0.25$\n- Event $D$: A patient has IA.\n- Event $\\overline{D}$: A patient does not have IA.\n- Event $T+$: A positive test result (CT halo sign is present).\n- Event $T-$: A negative test result (CT halo sign is absent).\n- Required quantities:\n  1.  Positive Predictive Value, $PPV = P(D \\mid T+)$\n  2.  Negative Predictive Value, $NPV = P(\\overline{D} \\mid T-)$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of Bayesian probability theory to medical diagnostics, a common practice in epidemiology and clinical medicine. The terms (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, PPV, NPV) are standard and well-defined. The provided values are plausible for a diagnostic test in a high-risk population. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to derive the required expressions and compute the numerical values. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific or mathematical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)\nThe positive predictive value, $PPV$, is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, which is expressed as the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability (which is a rearrangement of the definition of joint probability), we have:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nThis is the core of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of sensitivity, $Se = P(T+ \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(D)}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+ \\mid D) \\times P(D) = Se \\times p$$\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We can expand this using the law of total probability, by conditioning on the disease status (either the patient has the disease, $D$, or does not, $\\overline{D}$):\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(T+ \\mid \\overline{D})P(\\overline{D})$$\nWe identify the terms:\n- $P(T+ \\mid D) = Se$ (Sensitivity)\n- $P(D) = p$ (Prevalence)\n- $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T+ \\mid \\overline{D})$ is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate). It is related to specificity, $Sp = P(T- \\mid \\overline{D})$, which is the probability of a negative test in a patient without the disease. Since a test is either positive or negative, $P(T+ \\mid \\overline{D}) + P(T- \\mid \\overline{D}) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T+ \\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = (Se \\times p) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - p))$$\nCombining the numerator and denominator, we derive the expression for $PPV$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\times p}{(Se \\times p) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - p))}$$\n\n### Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)\nThe negative predictive value, $NPV$, is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, or $P(\\overline{D} \\mid T-)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$NPV = P(\\overline{D} \\mid T-) = \\frac{P(\\overline{D} \\cap T-)}{P(T-)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(\\overline{D} \\cap T-)$, is the joint probability of not having the disease and testing negative. It can be expressed using the definition of specificity, $Sp = P(T- \\mid \\overline{D}) = \\frac{P(\\overline{D} \\cap T-)}{P(\\overline{D})}$. Rearranging gives:\n$$P(\\overline{D} \\cap T-) = P(T- \\mid \\overline{D}) \\times P(\\overline{D}) = Sp \\times (1 - p)$$\nThe denominator, $P(T-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T-) = P(T- \\mid D)P(D) + P(T- \\mid \\overline{D})P(\\overline{D})$$\nWe identify the terms:\n- $P(D) = p$\n- $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T- \\mid \\overline{D}) = Sp$ (Specificity)\n- $P(T- \\mid D)$ is the probability of a negative test in a patient with the disease (the false negative rate). It is related to sensitivity, $Se = P(T+ \\mid D)$. Since $P(T+ \\mid D) + P(T- \\mid D) = 1$, we have $P(T- \\mid D) = 1 - Se$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T-)$:\n$$P(T-) = ((1 - Se) \\times p) + (Sp \\times (1 - p))$$\nCombining the numerator and denominator, we derive the expression for $NPV$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\times (1 - p)}{(Sp \\times (1 - p)) + ((1 - Se) \\times p)}$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the values $Se = 0.80$, $Sp = 0.60$, and $p = 0.25$.\nFirst, we calculate the complementary probabilities:\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n- $1 - Se = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n- $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\nFor $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.25}{(0.80 \\times 0.25) + (0.40 \\times 0.75)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.20 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.20}{0.50} = 0.40$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4000$.\n\nFor $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.60 \\times 0.75}{(0.60 \\times 0.75) + (0.20 \\times 0.25)} = \\frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.45}{0.50} = 0.90$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.9000$.\n\nThe positive predictive value is $0.4000$, and the negative predictive value is $0.9000$.",

A sputum culture is performed, whose behavior is as follows: if invasive aspergillosis is present, the culture is positive with probability $0.90$; if only colonization is present, the culture is positive with probability $0.70$; and if neither condition is present, the culture is positive due to test specificity limitations with probability equal to $1 - \\text{specificity}$, where the test specificity is $0.95$. Using only standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and conditional probability, derive from first principles an analytic expression for the probability that a positive sputum culture is a false positive with respect to invasive aspergillosis (that is, the probability that the patient does not have invasive aspergillosis given a positive sputum culture). Then, evaluate this expression numerically for the parameters provided. Express the final probability as a decimal number and round your answer to four significant figures.",

It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and medical diagnostics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and presented objectively. No flaws corresponding to the invalidity-check criteria are present.\n\nLet us define the mutually exclusive patient states as follows:\n- $IA$: The patient has invasive aspergillosis.\n- $C$: The patient has airway colonization by Aspergillus without tissue invasion.\n- $N$: The patient has neither colonization nor invasive aspergillosis.\n\nLet $T+$ denote the event that the sputum culture is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following prevalences and conditional probabilities:\n- The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis: $P(IA) = 0.05$.\n- The prevalence of airway colonization: $P(C) = 0.30$.\n- The conditional probability of a positive culture given invasive aspergillosis (sensitivity): $P(T+ | IA) = 0.90$.\n- The conditional probability of a positive culture given only colonization: $P(T+ | C) = 0.70$.\n- The specificity of the test with respect to the 'neither' state is given as $0.95$. Specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease. In this context, it is $P(T- | N)$. Therefore, the probability of a positive culture given the 'neither' state is $P(T+ | N) = 1 - P(T- | N) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe three states $IA$, $C$, and $N$ are mutually exclusive and form a partition of the patient population. Therefore, their probabilities must sum to $1$.\n$$P(IA) + P(C) + P(N) = 1$$\nWe can calculate the prevalence of the 'neither' state:\n$$P(N) = 1 - P(IA) - P(C) = 1 - 0.05 - 0.30 = 0.65$$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a positive sputum culture is a false positive with respect to invasive aspergillosis. This is the probability that the patient does not have invasive aspergillosis, given that the culture is positive. Let $\\neg IA$ denote the event \"not having invasive aspergillosis\". The quantity to be derived is $P(\\neg IA | T+)$.\n\nThe event $\\neg IA$ is the union of the two mutually exclusive events $C$ and $N$. Thus, $\\neg IA = C \\cup N$.\nThe probability $P(\\neg IA | T+)$ can be calculated as $1 - P(IA | T+)$. To find $P(IA | T+)$, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(IA | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | IA) P(IA)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the partition $\\{IA, C, N\\}$:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(IA | T+)$ gives:\n$$P(IA | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | IA)P(IA)}{P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)}$$\nThe desired probability is then:\n$$P(\\neg IA | T+) = 1 - P(IA | T+) = 1 - \\frac{P(T+ | IA)P(IA)}{P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)}$$\nBy finding a common denominator, we can simplify this to derive the required analytic expression:\n$$P(\\neg IA | T+) = \\frac{\\left(P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)\\right) - P(T+ | IA)P(IA)}{P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)}$$\n$$P(\\neg IA | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)}{P(T+ | IA)P(IA) + P(T+ | C)P(C) + P(T+ | N)P(N)}$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the probability that a positive culture is a false positive with respect to invasive aspergillosis.
