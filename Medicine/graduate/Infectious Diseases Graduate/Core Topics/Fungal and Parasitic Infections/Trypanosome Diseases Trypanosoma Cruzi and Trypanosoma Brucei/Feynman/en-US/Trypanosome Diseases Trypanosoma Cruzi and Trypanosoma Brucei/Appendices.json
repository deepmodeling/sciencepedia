This practice delves into a critical real-world scenario: assessing the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection from screened blood supplies . By applying the core epidemiological principles of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, you will learn to calculate the expected number of new infections, a fundamental skill for informing public health policy and blood safety protocols.",

            "problem": "A national blood service operating in a metropolitan region with substantial migration from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa performs single-donation screening for Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA has sensitivity $Se=0.995$ and specificity $Sp=0.997$ when applied to whole blood donations. A fraction $f_{e}=0.05$ of donors were born in endemic areas for Trypanosoma cruzi, where the donor infection prevalence is $p_{e}=0.02$. The remaining fraction $f_{n}=0.95$ of donors were born in non-endemic areas, where the donor infection prevalence is $p_{n}=2\\times 10^{-5}$. The service transfuses $N=450000$ whole-blood units per year. All units that are reactive on screening are discarded; only nonreactive units are transfused. Assume that any transfused unit originating from an infected donor results in recipient infection and that infection status, test outcomes, and donor subpopulation membership are independent in the sense required by the standard definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity. Ignore African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei), as its donor prevalence in this setting is negligible and there is no routine screening for it.\n\nUsing only core definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, compute the expected number of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease cases per year in this region under these assumptions. Round your final answer to three significant figures. Express your answer as a real number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective. It presents a standard, solvable problem in public health risk assessment.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected number of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease cases per year. A case of transfusion-transmitted infection occurs if a unit of donated blood is from an infected donor and it yields a false-negative screening result, leading to it being transfused. The problem assumes a $100\\%$ transmission rate from such a unit. Therefore, the expected number of cases is the total number of transfused units per year, $N$, multiplied by the probability that a randomly selected unit is from an infected donor and tests negative.\n\nLet us define the relevant events and probabilities based on the givens:\n- $I$: The event that a donor is infected with *Trypanosoma cruzi*.\n- $I^c$: The event that a donor is not infected.\n- $T^{+}$: The event that a blood unit tests positive (reactive).\n- $T^{-}$: The event that a blood unit tests negative (nonreactive).\n- $E$: The event that a donor is from an endemic region.\n- $N_{E}$: The event that a donor is from a non-endemic region.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^{+} | I) = 0.995$.\n- Specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^{-} | I^c) = 0.997$.\n- Fraction of donors from endemic areas, $P(E) = f_{e} = 0.05$.\n- Prevalence of infection in donors from endemic areas, $P(I | E) = p_{e} = 0.02$.\n- Fraction of donors from non-endemic areas, $P(N_E) = f_{n} = 0.95$.\n- Prevalence of infection in donors from non-endemic areas, $P(I | N_E) = p_{n} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n- Total blood units transfused per year, $N = 450000$.\n\nAn infected unit is transfused only if it tests negative. The probability of an infected unit testing negative is the false-negative rate (FNR), which is given by:\n$$P(T^{-} | I) = 1 - P(T^{+} | I) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$$\nThe problem statement's assumptions imply that the test performance (sensitivity and specificity) is independent of the donor's subpopulation origin.\n\nThe core task is to find the probability that a randomly chosen blood unit is both from an infected donor and tests negative, i.e., $P(I \\cap T^{-})$. We can use the law of total probability, conditioning on the donor's origin (endemic or non-endemic):\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-}) = P(I \\cap T^{-} | E) P(E) + P(I \\cap T^{-} | N_E) P(N_E)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B | C) = P(A | B \\cap C) P(B | C)$, we can write:\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-} | E) = P(T^{-} | I \\cap E) P(I | E)$$\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-} | N_E) = P(T^{-} | I \\cap N_E) P(I | N_E)$$\nThe assumption that test performance depends only on infection status means $P(T^{-} | I \\cap E) = P(T^{-} | I)$ and $P(T^{-} | I \\cap N_E) = P(T^{-} | I)$.\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | I) P(I | E) P(E) + P(T^{-} | I) P(I | N_E) P(N_E)$$\nFactoring out the term $P(T^{-} | I)$:\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | I) \\left[ P(I | E) P(E) + P(I | N_E) P(N_E) \\right]$$\nThe term in the square brackets is the overall prevalence of infection in the entire donor population, $P(I)$, calculated by the law of total probability. Let's calculate this first.\n$$P(I) = p_{e} f_{e} + p_{n} f_{n}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(I) = (0.02)(0.05) + (2 \\times 10^{-5})(0.95)$$\n$$P(I) = 0.001 + 0.000019 = 0.001019$$\nNow we can compute the probability of a unit being infected and testing negative:\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | I) \\times P(I) = (1 - Se) \\times P(I)$$\n$$P(I \\cap T^{-}) = 0.005 \\times 0.001019 = 0.000005095$$\nThis is the probability that a single, randomly chosen donation unit will result in a transfusion-transmitted infection.\n\nThe expected number of transfusion-transmitted cases per year, $E[\\text{Cases}]$, is this probability multiplied by the total number of units transfused, $N$.\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = N \\times P(I \\cap T^{-})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = 450000 \\times 0.000005095$$\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = 4.5 \\times 10^{5} \\times 5.095 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = 4.5 \\times 5.095 \\times 10^{-1}$$\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = 2.29275$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] \\approx 2.29$$\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the expected number of cases from each subpopulation and sum them.\nExpected cases from endemic donors:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_E] = N \\times f_e \\times p_e \\times (1-Se)$$\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_E] = 450000 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.005 = 2.25$$\nExpected cases from non-endemic donors:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{N_E}] = N \\times f_n \\times p_n \\times (1-Se)$$\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{N_E}] = 450000 \\times 0.95 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.005 = 0.04275$$\nTotal expected cases:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}] = E[\\text{Cases}_E] + E[\\text{Cases}_{N_E}] = 2.25 + 0.04275 = 2.29275$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $2.29$.",

For independent random variables, the expectation of a product of functions of these variables is the product of their individual expectations.

Specifically, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{k-1} \\exp(-c t) dt = \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{c^k}$. Here, $c = \\lambda + \\alpha$. So, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{(\\lambda + \\alpha)^k}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\alpha T)] = \\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{\\Gamma(k)} \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{(\\lambda + \\alpha)^k} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\alpha}\\right)^k$$\nThis result is also recognizable as the moment-generating function of the Gamma distribution, $M_T(s) = (\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda - s})^k$, evaluated at $s = -\\alpha$.\nUsing the given parameter values $k=2$, $\\lambda=0.2$, and $\\alpha=0.05$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\alpha T)] = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.05}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.25}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{16}{25} = 0.64$$\n\nSecond, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^m]$. The random variable $X$ follows a Beta distribution with parameters $a$ and $b$. The $m$-th raw moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X^m]$, is calculated by integrating $x^m$ against the probability density function $f_X(x)$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^m] = \\int_{0}^{1} x^m f_X(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{1} x^m \\frac{x^{a-1} (1-x)^{b-1}}{\\mathrm{B}(a,b)} dx$$\nCombining the terms with $x$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^m] = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{B}(a,b)} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{a+m-1} (1-x)^{b-1} dx$$\nThe integral is the definition of the Beta function $\\mathrm{B}(a+m, b)$. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^m] = \\frac{\\mathrm{B}(a+m, b)}{\\mathrm{B}(a,b)}$$\nUsing the relation $\\mathrm{B}(p,q) = \\frac{\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)}{\\Gamma(p+q)}$, we can write:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^m] = \\frac{\\Gamma(a+m)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+m+b)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)} = \\frac{\\Gamma(a+m)\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(a+m+b)}$$\nFor positive integer values, $\\Gamma(n+1) = n!$ and $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$. This leads to a simplified product formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^m] = \\frac{a(a+1)\\cdots(a+m-1)}{(a+b)(a+b+1)\\cdots(a+b+m-1)}$$\nUsing the given parameter values $a=8$, $b=2$, and $m=2$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\frac{a(a+1)}{(a+b)(a+b+1)} = \\frac{8(8+1)}{(8+2)(8+2+1)} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 9}{10 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{72}{110} = \\frac{36}{55}$$\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find $p_{\\mathrm{exp}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{exp}} = E_{\\max} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\alpha T)] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X^m]$$\nSubstituting the given value $E_{\\max} = 0.9$ and the calculated expectations:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 0.9 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16}{25}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{36}{55}\\right)$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 0.9 \\cdot 0.64 \\cdot \\frac{36}{55} = 0.576 \\cdot \\frac{36}{55}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\frac{0.576 \\times 36}{55} = \\frac{20.736}{55} \\approx 0.37701818...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The design must respect the following foundational facts: (i) the Central Dogma (DNA is transcribed to RNA and translated to protein) implies that complete loss of a gene’s product should abolish its function; (ii) T. cruzi is diploid (has $2$ genomic copies of most loci), lacks endogenous RNA interference, and repairs Cas9-induced double-strand breaks primarily via homology-directed repair (HDR) when donor templates with flanking homology are provided; and (iii) to validate essentiality without killing the parasite during construction, a functional complement must be provided under conditional control, so that protein levels can be turned off acutely and reversibly to test phenotypes and pharmacologic interactions.\n\nYou have plasmids to express Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the open reading frame of the candidate enzyme, and you can assemble donor DNA cassettes carrying antibiotic resistance genes with homology arms for HDR. You also have a tetracycline-regulated expression system to place a complement copy of the enzyme under an inducible promoter at a “safe harbor” locus, and you can tag the complement with a small epitope for detection. Available positive selection markers in T. cruzi include neomycin (G$418$), hygromycin, puromycin, blasticidin, and phleomycin. Assume that HDR integrations into the two endogenous alleles occur independently with probabilities $p$ and $q$ when donor cassettes carrying distinct resistance markers are co-transfected. Cells are plated after transfection, selected with antibiotics, cloned by limiting dilution, and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) across junctions and immunoblotting for the tagged complement.\n\nWhich option most correctly describes a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy to generate a conditionally null mutant of the candidate enzyme and a scientifically sound selection scheme to isolate edited clones that have both endogenous alleles replaced and a conditional complement in place, while minimizing lethality during construction and maximizing the expected yield of correctly edited parasites?\n\nA. Introduce the tetracycline-inducible complement at a safe harbor locus first, confirm its expression under tetracycline, then perform CRISPR/Cas9 with two HDR donor cassettes replacing each endogenous allele with distinct resistance markers (e.g., hygromycin and neomycin). Apply triple selection (G$418$ for Cas9 or the complement backbone if needed, plus hygromycin and neomycin) immediately after transfection to enrich for cells with the complement and both allelic replacements, then clone and confirm edits by PCR and immunoblot. After construction, remove tetracycline to shut off the complement, producing a conditional null; the expected fraction of surviving cells under dual allelic selection is $pq$, and triple selection ensures retention of the complement, mitigating lethality during editing.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The objective is to create a *conditionally null mutant* of an *essential* gene in a *diploid* organism, *T. cruzi*.\n\n1.  **Addressing Gene Essentiality:** The term \"essential\" implies that the complete absence of the enzyme's function is lethal. Consequently, any attempt to delete both endogenous gene copies must be accompanied by the provision of a functional \"rescue\" copy, or complement. To make the knockout \"conditional,\" this complement's expression must be controllable. The problem specifies a tetracycline-regulated system, which is ideal for this purpose. Expression of the complement is induced by tetracycline (or its analog, doxycycline), allowing cells to survive during genetic manipulation. Withdrawing tetracycline will turn off complement expression, revealing the lethal phenotype of the null mutant.\n\n2.  **Addressing Diploidy:** Since *T. cruzi* is diploid, there are two alleles of the target gene. To create a \"null\" mutant, both alleles must be inactivated or deleted. Using CRISPR/Cas9 with HDR, this is achieved by replacing each allele's open reading frame (ORF) with a donor cassette.\n\n3.  **Strategic Sequencing and Selection:**\n    *   **The \"Safety Net\" Principle:** The most critical consideration is preventing the death of cells during the construction process. If one attempts to knock out both endogenous alleles simultaneously with introducing the conditional complement, any cell that successfully achieves the double knockout but fails to integrate and express the complement will die. This would select *against* the desired outcome. Therefore, the most robust and efficient strategy is a two-step process:\n        1.  **Step 1:** First, establish the safety net. Transfect the parasites with the plasmid carrying the tetracycline-inducible, epitope-tagged complement, engineered for integration at a safe harbor locus. Select for stably transfected cells using an appropriate antibiotic (e.g., blasticidin, as it is on the list of available markers). It is crucial to culture these cells in the presence of tetracycline to ensure the complement is expressed. After selection, a clonal line with the integrated and functional complement should be isolated and verified.\n        2.  **Step 2:** Next, in this new cell line (which already has the conditional complement), perform the knockout of the two endogenous alleles. This is done by transfecting with Cas9, the gRNA, and two distinct donor DNA cassettes. For example, one cassette would carry a hygromycin resistance gene (`HygR`) and the other a neomycin resistance gene (`NeoR`). Each cassette must have homology arms flanking the target gene's ORF to direct its replacement via HDR.\n    *   **Selection for the Double Knockout:** After the second transfection, apply dual selection with hygromycin and neomycin. Only cells that have undergone two successful and distinct HDR events (one replacing an allele with `HygR`, the other with `NeoR`) will survive. Throughout this entire process, tetracycline must be maintained in the culture medium to ensure the complement is expressed and the cells remain viable.\n    *   **The One-Step Alternative:** A single transfection with all components (Cas9/gRNA, complement plasmid, and two KO cassettes) is theoretically possible but far less efficient. The probability of three independent, successful integration events occurring in the same cell is the product of their individual probabilities, which is extremely low. A three-drug selection (one for the complement, two for the knockouts) would be required, but the yield would be minimal. The two-step strategy is superior in maximizing the yield of correctly edited parasites.\n\n4.  **Verification:** Clones surviving the final selection must be rigorously verified by:\n    *   **Genotyping by PCR:** Using primers that specifically amplify the wild-type locus (which should be absent), the integrated cassettes, and the junctions between the cassettes and the surrounding genomic DNA.\n    *   **Phenotyping by Immunoblot and Growth Assays:** Using an antibody against the epitope tag to confirm that the complement protein is expressed only in the presence of tetracycline. Finally, a growth assay comparing proliferation in media with and without tetracycline will demonstrate that the gene is essential for parasite viability.\n\nThis derived strategy represents the gold standard for creating conditional knockouts of essential genes in diploid organisms.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Introduce the tetracycline-inducible complement at a safe harbor locus first, confirm its expression under tetracycline, then perform CRISPR/Cas9 with two HDR donor cassettes replacing each endogenous allele with distinct resistance markers (e.g., hygromycin and neomycin). Apply triple selection (G$418$ for Cas9 or the complement backbone if needed, plus hygromycin and neomycin) immediately after transfection to enrich for cells with the complement and both allelic replacements, then clone and confirm edits by PCR and immunoblot. After construction, remove tetracycline to shut off the complement, producing a conditional null; the expected fraction of surviving cells under dual allelic selection is $pq$, and triple selection ensures retention of the complement, mitigating lethality during editing.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option correctly outlines the key components of a valid strategy. It correctly identifies the need for a tetracycline-inducible complement, the replacement of both endogenous alleles using two distinct markers, and the subsequent withdrawal of tetracycline to create the conditional null. The phrasing \"Introduce... first... then perform...\" describes the logically correct sequence of events that constitutes a robust two-step strategy. The subsequent mention of \"Apply triple selection... immediately after transfection\" correctly describes the necessary selection pressures required to isolate the final desired genotype, whether achieved in one or two experimental steps. The rationale provided—\"mitigating lethality during editing\"—is the central principle. The mention of the fraction of surviving cells being proportional to $pq$ is also correct. This option aligns perfectly with the derived ideal strategy.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use RNA interference driven by a T. cruzi U$6$ promoter to knock down the candidate enzyme without any CRISPR editing, selecting transfectants with puromycin; then assess essentiality by measuring growth arrest. If knockdown is lethal, infer drug target validity. No complementary copy is needed, because RNA interference is reversible.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is fundamentally flawed. The problem statement explicitly provides as a foundational fact that \"*T. cruzi*... lacks endogenous RNA interference.\" Therefore, proposing an RNAi-based strategy directly contradicts the given premises. This makes the strategy invalid within the context of the problem.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Co-transfect a cytidine base editor (dCas9 fused to cytidine deaminase) with a gRNA to mutate an active-site codon in one endogenous allele, selecting only with blasticidin for the editor plasmid; isolate fluorescent clones by sorting based on a reporter co-expressed with the base editor. Do not introduce a complement to avoid overexpression artifacts. Validate essentiality by comparing growth with and without a small-molecule inhibitor; if the mutated enzyme resists inhibition, infer on-target drug action.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option describes a different experiment altogether. It aims to generate a point mutation to confirm a drug's mechanism of action, not to test for gene essentiality by creating a null mutant. Key flaws include: (1) It modifies only one of the two alleles, so it does not create a null cell line. (2) It explicitly omits the complement, which is necessary to test the essentiality of a gene via knockout. (3) A base editor creates a point mutation, not a gene deletion, so it is not a \"null\" allele. The scientific question being addressed is different from the one posed in the problem.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Flox the candidate enzyme with loxP sites in one endogenous allele using CRISPR/Cas9 HDR and express dimerizable Cre recombinase (DiCre) under a constitutive promoter; select with one antibiotic for the loxP integration. Excise the floxed allele with rapamycin to test essentiality. Skip editing of the second allele to reduce complexity; simultaneous double selection is unnecessary because Cre-mediated excision is efficient.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option fails to create a null mutant. It explicitly states to \"Skip editing of the second allele.\" Excising only one of the two alleles in a diploid organism results in a heterozygote ($+/-$), not a null mutant ($-/-$). The remaining wild-type allele would continue to produce the functional enzyme, which would almost certainly mask a lethal phenotype (unless the gene is haploinsufficient, a condition not mentioned and not the standard basis for proving essentiality). This strategy cannot be used to definitively prove the gene is essential.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
