            "introduction": "A core principle in infectious disease pathology is understanding the relationship between parasite burden and host morbidity. For hookworm infection, a primary cause of anemia in endemic areas, this relationship can be quantified directly. This exercise provides a practical application of fundamental principles to calculate the daily iron loss based on the number of worms a host carries, linking the micro-scale action of a single parasite to a macro-scale clinical outcome . By working through this calculation, you will develop a tangible understanding of the physiological cost of infection and the importance of worm burden in determining disease severity.",

            "problem": "A population of hookworms feeds on host intestinal blood and thereby causes iron loss. Consider the species Necator americanus. Assume the host’s whole-blood iron concentration is approximately $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,Fe/mL}$, a value grounded in the mean hemoglobin content and iron per heme group for adult human blood. Suppose each Necator americanus worm removes a daily blood volume of $\\ell = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}$ from the host via ingestion and blood leakage at the feeding site, and that there is negligible intraluminal recovery of iron from red blood cells (RBCs)) destroyed at the bite site. Starting from the definition of concentration $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}/V$ and conservation of mass applied to a daily volumetric blood loss, derive an analytic expression for the daily iron loss $I$ as a function of the worm burden $n$, the per-worm daily blood loss $\\ell$, and the blood iron concentration $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$. Then evaluate this expression for $n = 200$, $\\ell = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}$, and $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. Express the final iron loss in $\\mathrm{mg\\,Fe/day}$ and round your numerical answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the daily iron loss, $I$, from a host infected with hookworms, followed by a numerical evaluation of this expression. The derivation will be based on the provided definition of concentration and the principle of mass conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between mass, volume, and concentration. The concentration of iron in the blood, $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$, is given as the mass of iron, $m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$, per unit volume of blood, $V$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{V}$$\nThis equation can be algebraically rearranged to find the mass of iron contained in a specific volume of blood:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\cdot V$$\nThe principle of mass conservation dictates that the mass of iron lost per day must equal the mass of iron contained in the total volume of blood lost per day, given the assumption of negligible iron recovery.\n\nThe total daily blood loss is a function of the number of worms (worm burden), $n$, and the average volume of blood lost per worm per day, $\\ell$. If there are $n$ worms and each is responsible for a blood loss of $\\ell$, the total volume of blood lost per day, which we shall denote $V_{\\text{daily}}$, is the product of these two quantities:\n$$V_{\\text{daily}} = n \\cdot \\ell$$\nThe daily iron loss, $I$, is the mass of iron contained in this volume $V_{\\text{daily}}$. Using the rearranged concentration formula, we can express $I$ as:\n$$I = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\cdot V_{\\text{daily}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{daily}}$ into this equation, we arrive at the final analytic expression for daily iron loss as a function of the given parameters:\n$$I = n \\cdot \\ell \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression. We can verify the dimensional consistency of this formula. The units for $n$ are dimensionless (worms), for $\\ell$ are $\\mathrm{mL/day}$, and for $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ are $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. The product of the units is:\n$$(\\text{dimensionless}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{day}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThis result has the correct units for a daily mass loss, confirming the validity of the derived expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\nWorm burden, $n = 200$.\nPer-worm daily blood loss, $\\ell = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}$.\nBlood iron concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for $I$:\n$$I = (200) \\cdot (0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}) \\cdot (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL})$$\nWe can now perform the arithmetic calculation:\n$$I = (200 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 0.5) \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n$$I = (6 \\cdot 0.5) \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n$$I = 3 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $3$. To represent this value with the specified precision, we write it as $3.00$. Thus, the daily iron loss is $3.00\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,Fe/day}$.",

            "introduction": "Effective public health interventions against soil-transmitted helminths rely on accurate epidemiological data, which in turn depends on the sensitivity of diagnostic tests. In settings where control programs have reduced infection intensity, detecting the remaining low-level infections becomes a significant challenge. This practice explores the probabilistic nature of the Kato-Katz diagnostic technique, a workhorse of STH epidemiology, using the Poisson distribution as a model for rare events . You will derive how diagnostic sensitivity changes with infection intensity and analytically demonstrate the value of examining multiple samples, a critical consideration for surveillance and verifying transmission interruption.",

            "problem": "Consider soil-transmitted helminths (STH), specifically Ascaris, Trichuris, and hookworms, whose macroparasite life cycle can be summarized as follows: adult worms in the human host produce eggs or larvae that enter and accumulate in the environment; these environmental infective stages are subsequently acquired by hosts, establishing new adult worms. Let the state variables be the mean host worm burden $W$ (worms per host) and the environmental infective-stage density $E$ (infective stages per unit exposure).\n\nUse the following fundamental base, grounded in infectious disease dynamics:\n\n- Adult worms die at a per-capita rate $\\mu$ (time$^{-1}$).\n- Environmental infective stages are lost at a per-capita rate $\\delta$ (time$^{-1}$) due to decay, removal, or inactivation.\n- Hosts acquire new worms at a rate proportional to the environmental infective-stage density, with proportionality constant $\\beta$ (worms per host per unit infective-stage density per unit time), representing exposure-contact, per-contact establishment probability, and maturation into adult worms.\n- Per-worm fecundity exhibits negative density dependence due to crowding and mating limitations; model this by an exponential reduction in per-worm egg output with the mean worm burden, so the per-worm fecundity is $\\phi_{0}\\exp(-\\gamma W)$, where $\\phi_{0}$ (infective stages per worm per unit time) is the maximum fecundity and $\\gamma$ (per worm) quantifies the strength of crowding.\n\nTasks:\n\n1.
