This exercise explores the crucial concept of Positive Predictive Value (PPV), demonstrating how the prevalence of a disease within a population can dramatically alter the interpretation of a positive test result, a critical consideration for programs operating in low-prevalence, post-intervention settings.

It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- All other validation criteria are met. The problem is free of scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradictions, or other flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value, $\\text{PPV} = \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+})$, and then evaluate it. The derivation will use Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability.\n\nBy definition, Bayes' theorem states:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly in the problem statement:\n- $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n- $\\mathbb{P}(D)$ is the prevalence, $\\pi$.\n\nSo, the numerator is the product $Se \\cdot \\pi$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. This can be expanded using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease status ($D$ or $D^{c}$):\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D^{c})\\mathbb{P}(D^{c})\n$$\nWe need to express the terms on the right-hand side using the given parameters $Se$, $Sp$, and $\\pi$.\n- The first term, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D)$, is simply $Se \\cdot \\pi$.\n- For the second term, we identify its components:\n  - $\\mathbb{P}(D^{c})$ is the probability of not having the disease. Since the events $D$ and $D^{c}$ are complementary, $\\mathbb{P}(D^{c}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n  - $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D^{c})$ is the probability of a positive test in an individual without the disease (the false positive rate). We are given the specificity, $Sp = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid D^{c})$. For a given disease status $D^{c}$, a test result is either positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$). Therefore, the probabilities of these two outcomes must sum to $1$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D^{c}) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid D^{c}) = 1\n    $$\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D^{c}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid D^{c}) = 1 - Sp\n    $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the law of total probability gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = (Se \\cdot \\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this complete expression for $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{(Se \\cdot \\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the Positive Predictive Value.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values: $Se = 0.99$, $Sp = 0.95$, and $\\pi = 0.02$.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\nSe \\cdot \\pi = 0.99 \\times 0.02 = 0.0198\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n(Se \\cdot \\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi) = (0.99 \\times 0.02) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.02)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.0198 + (0.05)(0.98)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.0198 + 0.049\n$$\n$$\n= 0.0688\n$$\nThe PPV is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.0198}{0.0688} \\approx 0.28779069767...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet the random variable $X_i$ represent the outcome of the antigen test for the $i$-th child, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The problem states that each test is a Bernoulli outcome. We can define the outcome as $X_i = 1$ if the child is antigen-positive and $X_i = 0$ if the child is antigen-negative.\n\nThe probability of a positive outcome (a \"success\" in the Bernoulli trial) is given as the true antigen prevalence, $\\pi$.\n$$P(X_i = 1) = \\pi = 0.01$$\nThe probability of a negative outcome (a \"failure\") is therefore:\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\nThe total number of antigen-positive children in the sample of size $N$ is the sum of these individual Bernoulli random variables:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of antigen-positive children, which is the expected value of the random variable $S_N$, denoted $E[S_N]$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$E[S_N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ with probability of success $\\pi$ is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i=0) = (1)(\\pi) + (0)(1-\\pi) = \\pi$$\nSince each child's test is an identical Bernoulli trial, the expected value for each child is the same: $E[X_i] = \\pi = 0.01$.\n\nSubstituting this into the sum, we find the expected total number of positive children:\n$$E[S_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi = N \\pi$$\nThis is the well-known formula for the mean of a binomial distribution, as $S_N$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $\\pi$, i.e., $S_N \\sim \\text{Bin}(N, \\pi)$.\n\nUsing the given values $N = 1500$ and $\\pi = 0.01$:\n$$E[S_N] = 1500 \\times 0.01 = 15$$\nThe expected number of antigen-positive children is $15$. Per the problem's instruction, this is a whole number.\n\nRegarding the implication for programmatic decision-making, the expected value of $15$ represents the long-run average number of positive cases that would be observed if this exact survey were repeated many times in a population where the true prevalence is precisely $1\\%$. The critical cutoff $c$ is a predetermined decision threshold, not an average. The purpose of $c$ is to control for statistical error. Specifically, $c$ is set to a value greater than the expected value ($15$) to account for random sampling variation. For a survey to \"pass\" (i.e., conclude that transmission is below the target threshold), the number of observed positives must be less than or equal to $c$. The value of $c$ is chosen to ensure that the probability of observing more than $c$ cases, purely by chance when the true prevalence is at the acceptable threshold (e.g., $\\pi=0.01$), is very low (e.g., less than $5\\%$). This minimizes the probability of a Type I error (falsely concluding that the program has failed). Thus, the expected value serves as a central point of the distribution, while the cutoff $c$ is a point in the upper tail of that distribution used for making a formal statistical inference.",
