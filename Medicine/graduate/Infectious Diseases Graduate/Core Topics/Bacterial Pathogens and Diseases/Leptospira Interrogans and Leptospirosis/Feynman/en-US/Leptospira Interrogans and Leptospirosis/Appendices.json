            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory is quantifying pathogenic Leptospira interrogans in a patient's urine using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). The assay targets a conserved pathogenic gene assumed to be single-copy per bacterium. Quantification cycle (Cq) values were calibrated using a standard curve that empirically relates the initial template copy number to the Cq as a linear function under constant amplification efficiency. The calibration yields the relationship $C_q = -3.3\\log_{10}(N) + 40$, where $N$ denotes the initial template copy number present in the reaction volume at the start of amplification and $C_q$ denotes the quantification cycle.\n\nFrom the patient sample, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from $200~\\mu\\text{L}$ of urine into a final elution volume of $50~\\mu\\text{L}$. The qPCR reaction volume was $20~\\mu\\text{L}$, of which $5~\\mu\\text{L}$ was the DNA template. The patient's sample produced a $C_q$ of $30$. Using the provided calibration relationship and the volumes described, compute the initial template copy number $N$ in the qPCR reaction and then estimate the bacterial load in the original urine in copies per $\\text{mL}$. Round your final bacterial load to three significant figures and express the final result in copies per $\\text{mL}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages. First, we determine the number of initial template copies, $N$, present in the qPCR reaction volume using the provided calibration equation. Second, we use this number along with the specified volumes from the DNA extraction and reaction setup to calculate the concentration of bacteria in the original urine sample.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Template Copy Number in the qPCR Reaction**\n\nThe relationship between the quantification cycle, $C_q$, and the initial template copy number, $N$, is given by the linear equation:\n$$C_q = -3.3\\log_{10}(N) + 40$$\nThe patient's sample yielded a $C_q$ value of $30$. We substitute this value into the equation:\n$$30 = -3.3\\log_{10}(N) + 40$$\nOur objective is to solve for $N$. We begin by isolating the logarithmic term:\n$$30 - 40 = -3.3\\log_{10}(N)$$\n$$-10 = -3.3\\log_{10}(N)$$\nNext, we solve for $\\log_{10}(N)$:\n$$\\log_{10}(N) = \\frac{-10}{-3.3} = \\frac{10}{3.3} = \\frac{100}{33}$$\nTo find $N$, we take the antilogarithm (base $10$) of both sides:\n$$N = 10^{\\left(\\frac{100}{33}\\right)}$$\nThis value, $N$, represents the number of DNA template copies present in the volume of the DNA template added to the qPCR reaction, which is specified as $V_{template} = 5~\\mu\\text{L}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Bacterial Load in the Original Urine Sample**\n\nThe number of copies $N$ calculated above is contained within the $V_{template} = 5~\\mu\\text{L}$ of DNA eluate that was added to the qPCR reaction. First, we determine the concentration of DNA copies in the entire DNA eluate.\nLet $C_{eluate}$ be the concentration of copies per microliter in the DNA eluate.\n$$C_{eluate} = \\frac{N}{V_{template}} = \\frac{10^{\\left(\\frac{100}{33}\\right)}}{5~\\mu\\text{L}}$$\nThe total volume of the DNA eluate is $V_{elution} = 50~\\mu\\text{L}$. The total number of copies in the entire eluate, $N_{eluate}$, is the product of its concentration and total volume:\n$$N_{eluate} = C_{eluate} \\times V_{elution} = \\left(\\frac{10^{\\left(\\frac{100}{33}\\right)}}{5~\\mu\\text{L}}\\right) \\times 50~\\mu\\text{L}$$\n$$N_{eluate} = 10 \\times 10^{\\left(\\frac{100}{33}\\right)} = 10^1 \\times 10^{\\left(\\frac{100}{33}\\right)} = 10^{\\left(1 + \\frac{100}{33}\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{33+100}{33}\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{133}{33}\\right)}$$\nThis total number of copies, $N_{eluate}$, was extracted from an initial urine volume of $V_{urine} = 200~\\mu\\text{L}$. Assuming perfect extraction efficiency, this is the number of bacterial gene copies present in $200~\\mu\\text{L}$ of urine.\n\nThe problem asks for the bacterial load in units of copies per milliliter ($\\text{mL}$). Let $L_{urine}$ be this concentration. First, we find the concentration in copies per microliter:\n$$L_{urine, \\mu L} = \\frac{N_{eluate}}{V_{urine}} = \\frac{10^{\\left(\\frac{133}{33}\\right)}}{200}~\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\mu\\text{L}}$$\nTo convert this concentration to copies per $\\text{mL}$, we use the conversion factor $1~\\text{mL} = 1000~\\mu\\text{L}$:\n$$L_{urine} = L_{urine, \\mu L} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mu\\text{L}}{1~\\text{mL}} = \\frac{10^{\\left(\\frac{133}{33}\\right)}}{200} \\times 1000~\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n$$L_{urine} = 5 \\times 10^{\\left(\\frac{133}{33}\\right)}~\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The exponent is approximately $\\frac{133}{33} \\approx 4.030303...$\n$$L_{urine} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{4.030303...}$$\n$$L_{urine} \\approx 5 \\times 10724.11$$\n$$L_{urine} \\approx 53620.55~\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $5$, $3$, and $6$. The fourth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$L_{urine} \\approx 53600~\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nExpressed in standard scientific notation, this is $5.36 \\times 10^4$ copies/mL. Since the problem assumes a single-copy gene per bacterium, this value represents the bacterial load.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacology and biophysical chemistry, describing the derivation and application of a standard dose-response model (the Hill equation). The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and all provided data and assumptions are consistent and sufficient to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to first derive a closed-form saturable effect model, $E(C)$, and then use it to calculate a specific value.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Model $E(C)$**\n\nThe model describes the fractional kill effect, $E$, as a function of the antimicrobial concentration, $C$. The maximal effect is normalized to $1$, so $E$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the given assumptions. The standard model that incorporates a sigmoidal response curve with cooperativity is the Hill equation. Assumption (iii) points directly to this model, which establishes a power-law relationship between the response ratio and the concentration. The response ratio is the ratio of the achieved effect to the remaining possible effect. With $E_{max}=1$, this ratio is $\\frac{E}{1-E}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{1-E} = \\left(\\frac{C}{K}\\right)^{\\gamma}\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the dimensionless slope parameter (or Hill coefficient) that quantifies cooperativity, and $K$ is a constant with units of concentration.\n\nTo find the closed-form expression for $E(C)$, we solve this equation for $E$:\n$$\nE = (1-E) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{C}{K}\\right)^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nE = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}} - E \\cdot \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}}\n$$\n$$\nE \\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}}\\right) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}}\n$$\n$$\nE \\left(\\frac{K^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}}\\right) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma}}\n$$\n$$\nE(C) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis equation represents the saturable effect model, which is consistent with assumptions (i), (ii), and (iii). As $C \\to \\infty$, $E \\to 1$, and as $C \\to 0$, $E \\to 0$.\n\nNext, we use assumption (iv) to determine the constant $K$. This assumption states that the concentration producing a half-maximal effect is the $\\text{EC}_{50}$. Since the maximal effect is $1$, the half-maximal effect is $E = 0.5$. This occurs when $C = \\text{EC}_{50}$. We substitute these values into our derived model:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{(\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}}{K^{\\gamma} + (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator gives:\n$$\n0.5 \\left(K^{\\gamma} + (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}\\right) = (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K^{\\gamma} + 0.5 (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma} = (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K^{\\gamma} = 0.5 (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nK^{\\gamma} = (\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince $K$ and $\\text{EC}_{50}$ are real, positive concentrations, we can conclude that $K = \\text{EC}_{50}$.\n\nSubstituting $K = \\text{EC}_{50}$ back into the model for $E(C)$, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nE(C) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{(\\text{EC}_{50})^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis is the required saturable effect model, commonly known as the sigmoid Emax model or the Hill equation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Fractional Kill**\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the fractional kill $E$ using the derived model and the following given parameter values:\n- Concentration: $C=4\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n- Half maximal effective concentration: $\\text{EC}_{50}=1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n- Slope parameter: $\\gamma=2$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula.
