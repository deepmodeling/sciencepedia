            "problem": "An environmental potable water sample from a hospital cooling system is tested for Legionella pneumophila using two complementary methods: culture-based enumeration and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA–qPCR). Culture-based enumeration reports a concentration of $50$ colony-forming units per liter ($\\text{CFU L}^{-1}$). PMA–qPCR targeting a single-copy chromosomal gene (for example, the macrophage infectivity potentiator gene) reports $5000$ genome copies per liter ($\\text{genome copies L}^{-1}$). Assume that the PMA treatment excludes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from non-viable cells, the gene target is present in $c_{g} = 1$ copy per genome, and that viable Legionella pneumophila cells in this environmental matrix carry on average $n_{g} = 2$ genome equivalents per cell due to polyploidy and growth-phase effects. Using the following foundational definitions:\n\n- A colony-forming unit (CFU) approximates the number of viable cells capable of forming a colony under the given culture conditions.\n- A genome copy measurement targeting a single-copy chromosomal locus quantifies the number of genomes present.\n- The viable cell-equivalent concentration can be inferred by dividing the genome copy concentration by the product of the target gene copies per genome and the average genome equivalents per viable cell.\n- The order-of-magnitude discrepancy between two concentrations can be quantified by the base-$10$ logarithm of their ratio.\n\nDerive from these definitions and compute the base-$10$ order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the PMA–qPCR-inferred viable cell-equivalent concentration and the culture-based CFU concentration for this sample.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the discrepancy, $D$, defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the ratio of the PMA–qPCR-inferred viable cell-equivalent concentration to the culture-based concentration.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{CFU}}$ represent the concentration from culture-based enumeration, which is given as:\n$$C_{\\text{CFU}} = 50 \\text{ L}^{-1}$$\n\nLet $C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}$ represent the PMA–qPCR-inferred viable cell-equivalent concentration. According to the problem's definition, this is calculated from the measured genome copy concentration, $C_{\\text{GC}}$, the number of gene copies per genome, $c_g$, and the average number of genome equivalents per cell, $n_g$. The formula is:\n$$C_{\\text{PMA-cell}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{GC}}}{c_g \\cdot n_g}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $C_{\\text{GC}} = 5000 \\text{ L}^{-1}$\n- $c_g = 1$\n- $n_g = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{PMA-cell}} = \\frac{5000}{1 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5000}{2} = 2500 \\text{ L}^{-1}$$\nThis value represents the concentration of viable cells as estimated by the molecular method.\n\nThe order-of-magnitude discrepancy, $D$, is defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the ratio of $C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}$ to $C_{\\text{CFU}}$.\n$$D = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}}{C_{\\text{CFU}}}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for the concentrations:\n$$D = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2500}{50}\\right)$$\n\nFirst, we simplify the ratio inside the logarithm:\n$$\\frac{2500}{50} = \\frac{250}{5} = 50$$\n\nSo, the discrepancy $D$ is:\n$$D = \\log_{10}(50)$$\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n$$D = \\log_{10}(5 \\times 10) = \\log_{10}(5) + \\log_{10}(10) = \\log_{10}(5) + 1$$\nUsing a standard calculator, the value of $\\log_{10}(50)$ is approximately $1.698970004...$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $1.698970004...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $6$, $9$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we must round up the fourth significant figure.

All necessary data are provided, and the scenario is realistic for a clinical investigation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has Legionnaires' disease and $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result and $T-$ denote a negative test result. The problem provides the following information:\n\n1.  Prevalence: $\\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.10$. This is the prior probability of a patient having the disease.\n2.  Sensitivity: $\\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D) = 0.80$. This is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease.\n3.  Specificity: $\\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n-   The probability of a false negative is $\\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n-   The probability of a false positive is $\\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe task is to calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T+)$, and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), $\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D \\mid T-)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the PPV using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T+)} $$\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We find it using the law of total probability:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T+) = \\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) + \\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid \\neg D)\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T+) = (0.80)(0.10) + (0.05)(0.90) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T+) = 0.08 + 0.045 = 0.125 $$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.08}{0.125} = 0.64 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.6400$.\n\nNext, we calculate the NPV using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\mathbb{P}(\\neg D \\mid T-) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid \\neg D) \\mathbb{P}(\\neg D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T-)} $$\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. We find it using the law of total probability:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T-) = \\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid \\neg D)\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D) + \\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T-) = (0.95)(0.90) + (0.20)(0.10) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T-) = 0.855 + 0.02 = 0.875 $$\nAlternatively, $\\mathbb{P}(T-) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T+) = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875$.\nNow we can compute the NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.855}{0.875} \\approx 0.9771428... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the NPV is $0.9771$.\n\nInterpretation of the results:\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of $0.6400$ is the posterior probability that a patient has Legionnaires' disease given a positive test result. In this specific cohort, if a patient tests positive, there is a $64.00\\%$ chance they actually have the disease. This illustrates that even with good sensitivity and specificity, a positive test result is not definitive, as $100\\% - 64.00\\% = 36.00\\%$ of positive results in this population are false positives. The test significantly increases the probability of disease from the baseline prevalence of $10\\%$ to a posterior probability of $64\\%$, but clinical judgment and potentially confirmatory testing are still required.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of $0.9771$ is the posterior probability that a patient does not have Legionnaires' disease given a negative test result. If a patient tests negative, there is a $97.71\\%$ chance they are indeed free of the disease. The probability of having the disease despite a negative test is very low ($1 - 0.9771 = 0.0229$, or $2.29\\%$). A high NPV makes the test very useful for ruling out the disease. In a clinical setting, a negative result provides strong evidence to direct the diagnostic search toward other causes.",

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the $30$-day case fatality quantity, which we denote as $p$. This quantity is the probability that a randomly selected case from this population dies within the $30$-day follow-up period.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Point Estimator**\n\nWe model the outcome for each of the $n=60$ cases as an independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variable. Let $X_i$ be the random variable for the outcome of case $i$, for $i = 1, \\dots, n$. We define $X_i = 1$ if case $i$ dies within $30$ days and $X_i = 0$ if case $i$ survives. The probability of death for any given case is $P(X_i = 1) = p$, and the probability of survival is $P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe total number of observed deaths is $d = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, where $x_i$ is the observed outcome for case $i$. Given that the trials are independent, the probability of observing exactly $d$ deaths in $n$ cases follows the Binomial distribution. The likelihood function $L(p)$, which is the probability of observing the data (specifically, $d$ deaths) given the parameter $p$, is:\n$$L(p | d, n) = \\binom{n}{d} p^d (1-p)^{n-d}$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $p$, denoted $\\hat{p}$, we must find the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$. It is mathematically more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood function $\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p))$:\n$$\\ell(p) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{d}\\right) + d \\ln(p) + (n-d) \\ln(1-p)$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the first derivative of $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{d}{p} - \\frac{n-d}{1-p}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero yields the score equation:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{p} = \\frac{n-d}{1-p}$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$d(1-p) = p(n-d)$$\n$$d - dp = np - dp$$\n$$d = np$$\n$$p = \\frac{d}{n}$$\nThus, the point estimator for $p$ is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{d}{n}$. To confirm this is a maximum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = -\\frac{d}{p^2} - \\frac{n-d}{(1-p)^2}$$\nFor $n > d > 0$, both terms are negative. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} < 0$, which confirms that the log-likelihood function is concave and the critical point corresponds to a maximum. The MLE for the case fatality quantity is the sample proportion of deaths.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for the Outbreak**\n\nGiven the data from the outbreak:\n- Number of cases: $n = 60$\n- Number of deaths: $d = 9$\n\nThe point estimate of the $30$-day case fatality quantity is:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{d}{n} = \\frac{9}{60} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $0.15$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a trailing zero: $0.150$.\n\n**Part 3: Formalization of Heterogeneity**\n\nThe problem asks to formalize how the overall case fatality quantity is modified by heterogeneity in age ($A$) and comorbidity burden ($C$). The overall case fatality is an average over the entire case population, which may be composed of subpopulations (strata) with different underlying risks.\n\nLet $A$ and $C$ be random variables representing the age group and comorbidity status of a case, respectively. We define a stratum by the specific combination of levels $(a, c)$, where $a$ belongs to the set of age strata $\\mathcal{A}$ and $c$ belongs to the set of comorbidity strata $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe **stratum-specific case fatality quantity**, $p_{ac}$, is the probability of death for a case within the specific stratum $(A=a, C=c)$:\n$$p_{ac} = P(\\text{death} | A=a, C=c)$$\nThe **case-mix** of a population describes the distribution of cases across these strata. We can represent this with a set of weights, $w_{ac}$, where each weight is the proportion of the total case population that falls into stratum $(a,c)$:\n$$w_{ac} = P(A=a, C=c)$$\nThese weights must sum to unity: $\\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} w_{ac} = 1$.\n\nThe **overall case fatality quantity**, $p_{overall}$, for the entire population can be expressed using the law of total probability. It is the weighted average of the stratum-specific case fatality quantities, where the weights are the proportions of cases in each stratum:\n$$p_{overall} = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} P(\\text{death} | A=a, C=c) P(A=a, C=c)$$\nSubstituting our notation, this becomes:\n$$p_{overall} = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} p_{ac} w_{ac}$$\n\n**Part 4: Effect of Shifts in Case-Mix**\n\nThis formalization allows us to understand how the overall case fatality can differ between two populations, or change over time, even if the underlying stratum-specific risks ($p_{ac}$) remain constant.\n\nSuppose we compare two different populations, Population 1 and Population 2, with different case-mix distributions, represented by weights $w_{ac}^{(1)}$ and $w_{ac}^{(2)}$ respectively. If we assume the stratum-specific risks $p_{ac}$ (which depend on biological factors and quality of care) are the same in both populations, their overall case fatality quantities will be:\n$$p_{overall}^{(1)} = \\sum_{a,c} p_{ac} w_{ac}^{(1)}$$\n$$p_{overall}^{(2)} = \\sum_{a,c} p_{ac} w_{ac}^{(2)}$$\nThe difference in overall case fatality is:\n$$\\Delta p_{overall} = p_{overall}^{(2)} - p_{overall}^{(1)} = \\sum_{a,c} p_{ac} \\left( w_{ac}^{(2)} - w_{ac}^{(1)} \\right)$$\nThis equation shows that a shift in the distribution of cases from lower-risk strata to higher-risk strata (i.e., $w^{(2)}$ places more weight on strata $(a,c)$ with high $p_{ac}$ values compared to $w^{(1)}$) will lead to an increase in the overall observed case fatality ($p_{overall}^{(2)} > p_{overall}^{(1)}$). Conversely, a shift in the case-mix towards younger, healthier individuals (strata with lower $p_{ac}$) would decrease the overall case fatality. This illustrates how the raw, unadjusted case fatality of a population is a function of both the intrinsic virulence of the pathogen (reflected in $p_{ac}$) and the demographic/health profile of the affected population (reflected in $w_{ac}$).",
