The binding of HBV to the NTCP receptor is a well-established biological fact. The physical model (non-cooperative, one-to-one binding) is a standard and appropriate simplification for many biological systems. The given values for $K_d$ and ligand concentration are physiologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions, constants, and assumptions to derive a unique expression for fractional occupancy and to calculate its value. The quantity to be calculated, $\\theta$, is clearly defined. The inclusion of the number of NTCP molecules per cell ($50{,}000$) is extraneous to the calculation of fractional occupancy but does not create a contradiction; it serves to test the understanding that $\\theta$ is an intensive property independent of total receptor concentration under the given assumptions.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard problem in biophysical chemistry and cell biology that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand (HBV) at equilibrium. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of bound receptors}}{\\text{Total concentration of receptors}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental equations describing the system at equilibrium:\n1. The definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\n2. The conservation of mass for the receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{tot}} = [R] + [RL]\n$$\n\nOur objective is to express $\\theta$ in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. To do this, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from the expression for $\\theta$ using the given equations.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the mass balance equation (2) to solve for the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = [R]_{\\text{tot}} - [RL]\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant (1):\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([R]_{\\text{tot}} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}\n$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}}$, which is our definition of $\\theta$. We can start by multiplying both sides by $[RL]$:\n$$\nK_d [RL] = ([R]_{\\text{tot}} - [RL])[L]\n$$\n\nDistribute $[L]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nK_d [RL] = [R]_{\\text{tot}}[L] - [RL][L]\n$$\n\nGroup all terms containing $[RL]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nK_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R]_{\\text{tot}}[L]\n$$\n\nFactor out $[RL]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$\n[RL](K_d + [L]) = [R]_{\\text{tot}}[L]\n$$\n\nFinally, to obtain the expression for fractional occupancy, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}}$, we divide both sides by $[R]_{\\text{tot}}$ and by $(K_d + [L])$:\n$$\n\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\n\nThus, the derived expression for the equilibrium fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}\n$$\nThis equation is a form of the Langmuir isotherm, which describes non-cooperative binding to a single class of sites.\n\nNow we can compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the given data. The problem states that receptor-mediated depletion of the ligand is negligible, so we can set the free HBV concentration $[L]$ equal to the total extracellular HBV concentration.\n- Free ligand concentration: $[L] = 5\\,\\text{nM}$\n- Dissociation constant: $K_d = 0.8\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nThe number of NTCP molecules per hepatocyte ($50{,}000$) is not required for this calculation, as fractional occupancy is an intensive property that depends on concentrations and binding affinity, not on the total number of receptors.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the derived expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{5\\,\\text{nM}}{5\\,\\text{nM} + 0.8\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{5}{5.8}\n$$\n\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 0.8620689655...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 0.8621\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as required.",

            "problem": "A central step in the life cycle of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the assembly of the icosahedral capsid from core protein dimers. Consider a minimal, well-mixed, isothermal kinetic model for HBV capsid assembly in which free core protein dimers at concentration $c(t)$ assemble via a nucleation step followed by elongation. The nucleation step is modeled as the formation of a critical nucleus of size $m \\geq 3$ dimers, with mass-action nucleation rate density $r_{\\mathrm{nuc}}(t) = k_{n} \\, c(t)^{m}$, where $k_{n}$ is an $m^{\\mathrm{th}}$-order rate constant. After nucleation, elongation proceeds by sequential addition of single dimers to the growing intermediate until reaching the final capsid size $N$ dimers, with the per-intermediate elongation step rate $k_{e} \\, c(t)$, where $k_{e}$ is a second-order rate constant. Assume for this problem that each growing intermediate has a single effective growth front, and that during the early-time regime relevant for the onset of misassembly the free dimer concentration remains approximately constant at $c(t) \\approx c$.\n\nDefine the mean elongation time from a newly formed nucleus to a complete capsid as the time to add the remaining $N - m$ dimers under the early-time approximation. Assume further that the instantaneous number density of concurrently growing intermediates (i.e., nucleated but not yet completed) can be approximated by a quasi-steady value given by the product of the nucleation rate density and the mean elongation time. Define the onset of kinetic misassembly as the condition under which the quasi-steady number density of concurrently growing intermediates equals the maximum number density of intermediates that could be fully completed by the available free dimers if all were allocated optimally, namely $c/(N - m)$, because each growing intermediate requires $N - m$ dimers to finish.\n\nStarting only from the foregoing definitions and the laws of mass-action kinetics, and without introducing any additional heuristic formulas, derive an explicit algebraic expression for the critical free dimer concentration $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$ at which misassembly onsets, expressed in terms of $k_{n}$, $k_{e}$, $m$, and $N$. Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression. Do not substitute numerical values. Do not include units in your final expression.

All definitions and conditions are provided explicitly, allowing for a direct derivation of the requested quantity. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the critical free dimer concentration, denoted as $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$, at which the onset of kinetic misassembly occurs. The derivation will proceed by first establishing expressions for the intermediate quantities defined in the problem statement and then solving the final condition for $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$.\n\nThe problem defines the onset of misassembly as the condition where the quasi-steady number density of concurrently growing intermediates, $I_{qs}$, equals the maximum number density of intermediates that could be completed by the available free dimers. This condition is stated as:\n$$\nI_{qs} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{mis}}}{N - m}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the final capsid size in dimers, $m$ is the critical nucleus size in dimers, and the concentration $c$ has been set to the critical concentration $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$.\n\nWe must now construct the expression for $I_{qs}$. The problem states that $I_{qs}$ can be approximated as the product of the nucleation rate density, $r_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$, and the mean elongation time, $\\tau_{e}$.\n$$\nI_{qs} = r_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\cdot \\tau_{e}\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine the expression for the nucleation rate density, $r_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$. The problem provides this from mass-action kinetics as $r_{\\mathrm{nuc}}(t) = k_{n} \\, c(t)^{m}$, where $k_{n}$ is the $m^{\\mathrm{th}}$-order rate constant. Under the early-time approximation where the free dimer concentration is constant, $c(t) \\approx c$, this becomes:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{nuc}} = k_{n} \\, c^{m}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the mean elongation time, $\\tau_{e}$. This is defined as the time required to add the remaining $N - m$ dimers to a newly formed nucleus. The rate of a single elongation step (the addition of one dimer to a growing intermediate) is given as $k_{e} \\, c(t)$. Under the same constant concentration approximation, this rate is $k_{e} \\, c$. This rate has units of time$^{-1}$. The mean time for a single step, which is a Poisson process, is the reciprocal of its rate.\n$$\n\\text{Mean time per elongation step} = \\frac{1}{k_{e} \\, c}\n$$\nSince elongation is a sequence of $N - m$ such steps, and each intermediate is assumed to have a single growth front, the total mean elongation time is the sum of the mean times for each individual step. Assuming each step is independent and has the same rate, we have:\n$$\n\\tau_{e} = (N - m) \\times (\\text{Mean time per elongation step}) = (N - m) \\frac{1}{k_{e} \\, c} = \\frac{N - m}{k_{e} \\, c}\n$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the quasi-steady intermediate density, $I_{qs}$, by substituting the expressions for $r_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ and $\\tau_{e}$:\n$$\nI_{qs} = r_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\cdot \\tau_{e} = (k_{n} \\, c^{m}) \\left( \\frac{N - m}{k_{e} \\, c} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$\nI_{qs} = \\frac{k_{n} (N - m)}{k_{e}} c^{m - 1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we apply the condition for the onset of misassembly by equating our expression for $I_{qs}$ with the stoichiometric limit $\\frac{c}{N-m}$.

We can divide both sides by $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$, assuming $c_{\\mathrm{mis}} \\neq 0$, which is physically required.\n$$\n\\frac{k_{n} (N - m)}{k_{e}} \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{mis}})^{m - 1}}{c_{\\mathrm{mis}}} = \\frac{1}{N - m}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k_{n} (N - m)}{k_{e}} (c_{\\mathrm{mis}})^{m - 2} = \\frac{1}{N - m}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $(c_{\\mathrm{mis}})^{m - 2}$:\n$$\n(c_{\\mathrm{mis}})^{m - 2} = \\frac{1}{N - m} \\cdot \\frac{k_{e}}{k_{n} (N - m)} = \\frac{k_{e}}{k_{n} (N - m)^{2}}\n$$\nTo obtain $c_{\\mathrm{mis}}$, we raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{m - 2}$.
