            "problem": "A clinical virology laboratory quantifies Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proviral burden in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). The assay targets a single-copy HTLV-1 proviral gene and, in the same DNA aliquot, an autosomal single-copy human reference gene (the $\\beta$-globin locus) to estimate the number of diploid genomes present. The notion of a “cell equivalent” is defined as the count of diploid genomes in the assayed DNA, grounded in the biological facts that PBMC are diploid and autosomal single-copy loci occur in two copies per diploid cell.\n\nFrom first principles, start with the following well-tested facts: HTLV-1 infection is measured as integrated proviral DNA within host genomes; PBMC are diploid; an autosomal single-copy locus is present in two copies per diploid cell; and ddPCR provides absolute template counts in the reaction volume for each target. Define “cell equivalents” in terms of the measured autosomal single-copy locus and derive an expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ PBMC as a function of the measured HTLV-1 copies and the measured autosomal single-copy locus copies in the same reaction. Then, apply your derived expression to the following measurements obtained from the same ddPCR reaction:\n\n- Measured HTLV-1 target copies: $1{,}780$.\n- Measured $\\beta$-globin copies: $42{,}500$.\n\nExpress the final HTLV-1 proviral load in “copies per $100$ PBMC.” Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard and valid method for quantifying viral load in a clinical setting. We may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is twofold: first, to derive from first principles an expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and second, to apply this expression to a given set of data.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the quantities measured by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR):\n- Let $N_{HTLV}$ be the absolute number of HTLV-1 proviral gene copies detected.\n- Let $N_{REF}$ be the absolute number of reference gene copies (in this case, $\\beta$-globin) detected.\n\nThe first task is to define \"cell equivalents\" in terms of the measured reference gene copies. The problem states that PBMC are diploid and that the reference gene is an autosomal single-copy locus. By definition, a diploid cell contains two full sets of autosomes. Therefore, a single diploid cell contains exactly $2$ copies of any single-copy autosomal gene.\n\nLet $N_{CE}$ denote the number of cell equivalents in the sample. A cell equivalent is defined as the count of diploid genomes. Since each diploid genome, and thus each cell, contains $2$ copies of the reference gene, the total number of measured reference gene copies, $N_{REF}$, is related to the number of cell equivalents by the equation:\n$$N_{REF} = 2 \\times N_{CE}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the number of cell equivalents as a function of the measured reference gene copies:\n$$N_{CE} = \\frac{N_{REF}}{2}$$\nThis equation provides the formal definition of cell equivalents based on the ddPCR measurement of the reference gene.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ PBMC. The proviral load is a measure of the average number of viral copies per cell. We can first calculate the load per single cell, which we denote as $L_{cell}$. This is the ratio of the total number of viral copies to the total number of cell equivalents:\n$$L_{cell} = \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{CE}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{CE}$ that we derived above:\n$$L_{cell} = \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{\\frac{N_{REF}}{2}} = 2 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}}$$\nThis expression gives the average number of HTLV-1 proviral copies per single cell. Clinical reporting standards often require this value to be expressed per $100$ cells. Let us denote the proviral load per $100$ PBMC as $L_{100}$. This is simply $100$ times the load per cell:\n$$L_{100} = 100 \\times L_{cell}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{cell}$:\n$$L_{100} = 100 \\times \\left( 2 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}} \\right) = 200 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}}$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ PBMC as a function of the measured copies of the HTLV-1 target and the autosomal reference gene.\n\nNow, we apply this expression to the provided data:\n- Measured HTLV-1 target copies, $N_{HTLV} = 1,780$.\n- Measured $\\beta$-globin copies, $N_{REF} = 42,500$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $L_{100}$:\n$$L_{100} = 200 \\times \\frac{1,780}{42,500}$$\nWe can simplify the expression before performing the division:\n$$L_{100} = \\frac{200 \\times 1,780}{42,500} = \\frac{2 \\times 17,800}{4,250} = \\frac{2 \\times 1,780}{425}$$\n$$L_{100} = \\frac{3,560}{425}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$L_{100} \\approx 8.376470588...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $3$, $7$, and $6$. The fifth significant digit is $4$. Since $4  5$, we round down by truncating the number after the fourth significant figure.\n$$L_{100} \\approx 8.376$$\nThus, the HTLV-1 proviral load is $8.376$ copies per $100$ PBMC.",

For patients with Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL), survival can vary dramatically by subtype.

            "problem": "A cohort of patients infected with Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was followed prospectively to study survival differences among subtypes of Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Let the time-to-event variable be measured in months, denoted by $t$, and assume non-informative right censoring. Consider the Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) model with an unspecified baseline hazard $h_{0}(t)$ and a categorical covariate indicating ATL subtype with levels acute, lymphoma, and smoldering. Encode the subtype with two indicator variables: $x_{\\text{acute}} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, taking smoldering as the reference so that $x_{\\text{acute}}=1$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=0$ for acute, $x_{\\text{acute}}=0$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=1$ for lymphoma, and $x_{\\text{acute}}=0$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=0$ for smoldering. The fitted model has the linear predictor $\\eta=\\beta_{\\text{acute}} x_{\\text{acute}}+\\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}} x_{\\text{lymphoma}}$ and hazard $h(t \\mid x)=h_{0}(t)\\exp(\\eta)$.\n\nA Cox PH model was fitted to $n=180$ patients, yielding the following maximum partial-likelihood estimates and robust standard errors for the subtype indicators: $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{acute}}=1.10$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{acute}})=0.25$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{lymphoma}}=0.65$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{lymphoma}})=0.20$. Scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each coefficient were regressed on follow-up time $t$ (in months) to assess the proportional hazards assumption (zero slope under the null). The estimated slopes and their standard errors were: for the acute indicator, $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}}=0.009$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}})=0.003$; for the lymphoma indicator, $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}}=-0.001$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}})=0.003$. Use a two-sided test at $\\alpha=0.05$ for each slope.\n\nStarting from the definition of the hazard function and the proportional hazards structure, derive the hazard ratios comparing acute to smoldering and lymphoma to smoldering, and justify whether the proportional hazards assumption holds for each indicator using the provided Schoenfeld residual slopes. Then, report the hazard ratio for acute versus smoldering as a dimensionless decimal, rounding your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will be addressed by first deriving the general form of the hazard ratio (HR) from the structure of the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model. Second, the proportional hazards assumption will be tested for each covariate using the provided statistics from the scaled Schoenfeld residuals analysis. Finally, the specific hazard ratio requested will be calculated.\n\nThe Cox proportional hazards model describes the hazard for an individual with a set of covariates $x$ at time $t$ as:\n$$h(t \\mid x) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\eta)$$\nwhere $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard function, an arbitrary non-negative function of time, and $\\eta$ is the linear predictor. In this problem, the covariates are indicator variables for the ATL subtype, and the linear predictor is given as $\\eta = \\beta_{\\text{acute}} x_{\\text{acute}} + \\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}} x_{\\text{lymphoma}}$. \n\nLet's define the hazard functions for the three ATL subtypes:\n1.  For the smoldering subtype (reference group), $x_{\\text{acute}}=0$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=0$. The hazard is:\n    $$h_{\\text{smoldering}}(t) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}} \\cdot 0 + \\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}} \\cdot 0) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(0) = h_{0}(t)$$\n2.  For the acute subtype, $x_{\\text{acute}}=1$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=0$. The hazard is:\n    $$h_{\\text{acute}}(t) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}} \\cdot 1 + \\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}} \\cdot 0) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}})$$\n3.  For the lymphoma subtype, $x_{\\text{acute}}=0$ and $x_{\\text{lymphoma}}=1$. The hazard is:\n    $$h_{\\text{lymphoma}}(t) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}} \\cdot 0 + \\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}} \\cdot 1) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}})$$\n\nThe hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard functions for two groups. The \"proportional hazards\" property stems from the fact that this ratio is constant over time.\n\nThe hazard ratio comparing the acute subtype to the smoldering subtype is:\n$$HR_{\\text{acute vs smoldering}} = \\frac{h_{\\text{acute}}(t)}{h_{\\text{smoldering}}(t)} = \\frac{h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}})}{h_{0}(t)} = \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{acute}})$$\nSimilarly, the hazard ratio comparing the lymphoma subtype to the smoldering subtype is:\n$$HR_{\\text{lymphoma vs smoldering}} = \\frac{h_{\\text{lymphoma}}(t)}{h_{\\text{smoldering}}(t)} = \\frac{h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}})}{h_{0}(t)} = \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{lymphoma}})$$\nThe estimated coefficients, $\\hat{\\beta}$, provided are the maximum partial-likelihood estimates for the true parameters $\\beta$.\n\nNext, we must assess the validity of the proportional hazards assumption for each covariate. This assumption implies that the hazard ratios derived above are constant over time. The problem provides results from a formal test of this assumption based on scaled Schoenfeld residuals. For each covariate, the scaled residuals are regressed against time $t$. The slope of this regression, $\\gamma$, is tested against the null hypothesis $H_0: \\gamma = 0$. If $H_0$ is rejected, there is evidence that the effect of the covariate (the log-hazard ratio) varies with time, violating the PH assumption. We use a two-sided Wald test with a test statistic $Z = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma})}$, which follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis. The significance level is given as $\\alpha=0.05$, for which the critical values are $Z_{\\alpha/2} = \\pm 1.96$.\n\nFor the acute subtype indicator ($x_{\\text{acute}}$):\nThe estimated slope is $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}} = 0.009$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}}) = 0.003$.\nThe test statistic is:\n$$Z_{\\text{acute}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}})} = \\frac{0.009}{0.003} = 3.00$$\nSince $|Z_{\\text{acute}}| = 3.00 > 1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level that the proportional hazards assumption is violated for the acute subtype indicator. The positive slope $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{acute}}  0$ suggests that the hazard ratio for the acute subtype (relative to smoldering) increases over time.\n\nFor the lymphoma subtype indicator ($x_{\\text{lymphoma}}$):\nThe estimated slope is $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}} = -0.001$ with $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}}) = 0.003$.\nThe test statistic is:\n$$Z_{\\text{lymphoma}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\text{lymphoma}})} = \\frac{-0.001}{0.003} \\approx -0.333$$\nSince $|Z_{\\text{lymphoma}}| \\approx 0.333  1.96$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the proportional hazards assumption is violated for the lymphoma subtype indicator.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to report the hazard ratio for acute versus smoldering. Although the PH assumption for this covariate is violated, the value $\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{acute}})$ represents the time-averaged hazard ratio from the fitted model. The question is a directive to report this specific quantity.\nUsing the provided estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{acute}} = 1.10$:\n$$\\widehat{HR}_{\\text{acute vs smoldering}} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{acute}}) = \\exp(1.10)$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\\exp(1.10) \\approx 3.00416602...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $3.004$.\nThis value should be interpreted with caution, as it is an average effect, and the test for the PH assumption indicates that the true hazard ratio is not constant over the follow-up period.",

Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a fixed horizon combine survival probabilities and health-state utilities; for a fixed $T$-year horizon with constant utility $q$ and constant survival probability $p$ for that horizon, the expected QALY contribution is $T \\times p \\times q$. Using these foundations, consider the following scientifically realistic decision question for initiating zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha (IFN) versus chemotherapy in HTLV-1–associated ATL.\n\nA cohort of newly diagnosed ATL patients is characterized by subtype, tumor burden, and comorbidity. Subtype distribution is: acute leukemia ($0.5$), lymphoma ($0.3$), chronic/smoldering ($0.2$).
