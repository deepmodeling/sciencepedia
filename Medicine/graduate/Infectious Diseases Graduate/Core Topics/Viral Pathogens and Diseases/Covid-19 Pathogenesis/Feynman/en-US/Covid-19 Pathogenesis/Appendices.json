Assume the following biologically grounded mechanisms, each reflecting a widely used foundational modeling principle in infectious disease dynamics: (i) infection events follow mass-action kinetics in which encounters between free virions and target cells lead to infection at a rate proportional to the product $V(t)T(t)$; (ii) infected cells die with a constant per-capita hazard independent of time, consistent with memoryless exponential loss; (iii) each infected cell produces free virions at a constant per-capita rate; and (iv) free virions are removed (by physical clearance, loss of infectivity, or nonspecific innate processes) with a constant per-capita hazard.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem statement describing a standard within-host viral dynamics model and asks for the correct system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and parameter interpretations.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement according to the specified criteria.\n\n**Extracted Givens:**\n- The system involves three time-dependent populations: $T(t)$ (uninfected target cells), $I(t)$ (infected cells), and $V(t)$ (free virions).\n- The model is a \"well-mixed, single-compartment description.\"\n- The governing mechanisms are:\n    - (i) Infection events follow mass-action kinetics, with the rate of new infections proportional to the product $V(t)T(t)$.\n    - (ii) Infected cells die with a constant per-capita hazard (memoryless exponential loss).\n    - (iii) Each infected cell produces free virions at a constant per-capita rate.\n    - (iv) Free virions are removed with a constant per-capita hazard.\n- Additional assumptions include:\n    - A target-cell limited regime.\n    - No explicit replenishment of target cells.\n    - No spatial structure.\n    - No saturation effects.\n    - No adaptive immune effector terms during the time window of interest.\n- The parameters whose interpretations are to be verified are $\\beta$, $\\delta$, $p$, and $c$.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The model described is the canonical \"target cell limited\" model of viral dynamics, a foundational and widely accepted framework in mathematical biology and virology. Its principles (mass action, first-order kinetics for production and decay) are standard and scientifically sound approximations. **(Valid)**\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem describes a system of first-order nonlinear ODEs. Given a set of non-negative initial conditions for $T(0)$, $I(0)$, and $V(0)$, the system is well-posed and admits a unique, stable solution for $t \\ge 0$. **(Valid)**\n- **Objectivity:** The language used is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. **(Valid)**\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary assumptions to derive a unique system of ODEs.

It is a well-defined and standard problem in quantitative biology. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the ODE System\n\nI will construct the differential equation for each population based on the provided mechanisms.\n\n**1. Equation for Target Cells, $T(t)$:**\nThe population of target cells, $T$, changes only through infection.\n- **Loss due to infection (Mechanism i):** Infection occurs at a rate proportional to encounters between virions $V$ and target cells $T$. Based on mass-action kinetics, this rate is $\\beta V T$, where $\\beta$ is the infection rate constant. This term represents the rate at which target cells are lost to the infected class.\n- **Source term:** The problem states \"no explicit replenishment of target cells,\" meaning there is no positive source term for $T$.\nTherefore, the rate of change of $T(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\beta V T $$\n\n**2. Equation for Infected Cells, $I(t)$:**\nThe population of infected cells, $I$, changes through the creation of new infected cells and the death of existing ones.\n- **Gain from infection (Mechanism i):** The rate at which target cells are infected, $\\beta V T$, is precisely the rate at which new infected cells are created. This is a source term for $I$.\n- **Loss due to cell death (Mechanism ii):** Infected cells are lost due to a \"constant per-capita hazard.\" This translates to a first-order decay process. The rate of loss is proportional to the number of infected cells, $I$. Let the proportionality constant be $\\delta$, the per-capita death rate of infected cells. The loss term is $\\delta I$.\nTherefore, the net rate of change of $I(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta V T - \\delta I $$\n\n**3. Equation for Free Virions, $V(t)$:**\nThe population of free virions, $V$, changes through production by infected cells and clearance from the system.\n- **Gain from production (Mechanism iii):** Infected cells produce virions at a \"constant per-capita rate.\" Let this rate be $p$. With a population of $I$ infected cells, the total production rate is $p I$.\n- **Loss due to clearance (Mechanism iv):** Virions are removed by a \"constant per-capita hazard.\" This is a first-order decay process. The rate of removal is proportional to the number of virions, $V$. Let the proportionality constant be $c$, the per-capita viral clearance rate. The loss term is $c V$.\nTherefore, the net rate of change of $V(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = p I - c V $$\n\n**Assembled System:**\nThe complete system of ODEs is:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\beta V T $$\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta V T - \\delta I $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = p I - c V $$\n\n**Parameter Interpretations:**\n- $\\beta$: Infection rate constant, quantifying the rate of successful infection events per unit of virion and target cell concentration.\n- $\\delta$: Per-capita death rate of productively infected cells.\n- $p$: Per-capita virion production rate by an infected cell.\n- $c$: Per-capita clearance rate of free virions.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option against the derived system and parameter interpretations.\n\n**A.**\n- **Equations:** $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta V T,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta V T-\\delta I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p I-c V.$$\n- **Analysis:** These equations\nperfectly match the system I derived.\n- **Interpretations:**\n    - $\\beta$: infection rate constant (mass-action) - Correct.\n    - $\\delta$: per-capita death rate of infected cells - Correct.\n    - $p$: per-infected-cell virion production rate - Correct.\n    - $c$: per-capita clearance rate of free virions - Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** The description of the model is also fully consistent with the problem statement.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B.**\n- **Equations:** $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta V T,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta V T-c I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p I-\\delta V.$$\n- **Analysis:** In the equation for $dI/dt$, the loss term is $-c I$, whereas it should be $-\\delta I$. In the equation for $dV/dt$, the loss term is $-\\delta V$, whereas it should be $-c V$. The parameters $\\delta$ and $c$ have been swapped in the equations. The interpretations provided also reflect this incorrect swap.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.**\n- **Equations:** $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta V T,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta V T-\\delta I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=c I-p V.$$\n- **Analysis:** In the equation for $dV/dt$, the production term is $c I$ (should be $p I$) and the clearance term is $-p V$ (should be $-c V$). The parameters $p$ and $c$ have been swapped in the equation. The interpretations provided also reflect this incorrect swap.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.**\n- **Equations:** $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta V T+s,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta V T-\\delta I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p I-c V.$$\n- **Analysis:** The equation for $dT/dt$ includes a term $+s$, representing a constant source of target cells. This explicitly violates the problem statement's assumption of \"no explicit replenishment of target cells.\"\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.**\n- **Equations:** $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta V T,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta V T-\\delta I-k I V,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p I-c V.$$\n- **Analysis:** The equation for $dI/dt$ includes an extra loss term, $-k I V$. The option correctly interprets this as modeling immune effector-mediated killing. However, this violates the problem statement's assumption of \"no adaptive immune effector terms.\"\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation from first principles and the subsequent analysis, only option A accurately represents the model described in the problem statement.",

            "problem": "In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of airway epithelial cells, viral proteins such as Open Reading Frame 8 (ORF8) can reduce the surface density of classical Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules (Human Leukocyte Antigen A, B, and C), thereby lowering peptide presentation to Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Natural Killer (NK) cells, in contrast, implement missing-self recognition: they generate cytotoxicity when inhibitory signals from classical MHC-I are diminished, modulated by ligation of stress-induced activating receptors such as natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D), and by inhibitory input via non-classical Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) engaging CD94/NKG2A.\n\nConsider a simple decision model for a single infected epithelial cell that can tune its normalized classical MHC-I level $m \\in [0,1]$. Let the instantaneous CTL-mediated killing hazard be proportional to the amount of classical MHC-I, $h_{\\mathrm{CTL}}(m) = a\\,m$, where $a > 0$ captures effector CD8 T cell abundance and avidity. Let the instantaneous NK-mediated killing hazard be proportional to an activating ligand scale $g > 0$ and to missing-self $(1 - m)$, and inversely proportional to the strength of HLA-E–NKG2A inhibitory signaling, modeled as $(1 + \\gamma e)$ with $\\gamma > 0$ and $e \\ge 0$ denoting normalized HLA-E expression; that is, $h_{\\mathrm{NK}}(m,e) = \\dfrac{b\\,g\\,(1 - m)}{1 + \\gamma e}$ with $b > 0$ reflecting maximal NK cytotoxic potential.

The model, though simplified, captures the essential trade-off: high MHC-I increases CTL killing, while low MHC-I increases NK killing. This is a standard concept in immunovirology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is to minimize a function $h(m)$ over a compact set $[0,1]$. The function is well-defined and continuous. The question asks for the value of $m$ that minimizes this function. A solution is guaranteed to exist by the Extreme Value Theorem. The problem is mathematically unambiguous.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. All variables and parameters are defined. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements in the problem setup.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary equations and constraints to find the optimal $m$. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective optimization problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal MHC-I Level\n\nThe objective is to find $m^{\\ast} \\in [0,1]$ that minimizes the total clearance hazard, $h(m)$.\nThe total hazard function is:\n$$\nh(m) = h_{\\mathrm{CTL}}(m) + h_{\\mathrm{NK}}(m,e) = a\\,m + \\frac{b\\,g\\,(1 - m)}{1 + \\gamma e}\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite $h(m)$ to isolate the terms dependent on $m$:\n$$\nh(m) = a\\,m + \\frac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e} - \\frac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e} m\n$$\nCombining the terms with $m$, we get:\n$$\nh(m) = \\left(a - \\frac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}\\right) m + \\frac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}\n$$\nThis is a linear function of $m$ of the form $h(m) = S \\cdot m + C$, where the slope $S$ is given by:\n$$\nS = a - \\frac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}\n$$\nand the constant (y-intercept) is $C = \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$.\n\nThe minimum value of a linear function on a closed interval, such as $[0,1]$, must occur at one of the boundaries. The specific boundary depends on the sign of the slope $S$.\n\n1.  **Case 1: The slope $S$ is positive ($S > 0$).**\n    This occurs when $a - \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e} > 0$, which is equivalent to $a > \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$.\n    If the slope is positive, the function $h(m)$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, the minimum value is achieved at the smallest possible value of $m$, which is $m^{\\ast} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Case 2: The slope $S$ is negative ($S < 0$).**\n    This occurs when $a - \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e} < 0$, which is equivalent to $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$.\n    If the slope is negative, the function $h(m)$ is strictly decreasing. Therefore, the minimum value is achieved at the largest possible value of $m$, which is $m^{\\ast} = 1$.\n\n3.  **Case 3: The slope $S$ is zero ($S = 0$).**\n    This occurs when $a - \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e} = 0$, which is equivalent to $a = \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$.\n    If the slope is zero, the function $h(m)$ is constant for all $m \\in [0,1]$. In this case, any value of $m$ in the interval $[0,1]$ results in the same minimum hazard.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. The minimizing choice $m^{\\ast}$ is $m^{\\ast} = 0$ if $a > \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$, $m^{\\ast} = 1$ if $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$, and when $a = \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$ the hazard is flat in $m$ so any $m \\in [0,1]$ yields the same clearance risk.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our three derived cases.\n-   $m^{\\ast} = 0$ when $a > \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$ (matches Case 1).\n-   $m^{\\ast} = 1$ when $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$ (matches Case 2).\n-   any $m \\in [0,1]$ is optimal when $a = \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$ (matches Case 3).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The minimizing choice $m^{\\ast}$ is $m^{\\ast} = 0$ if $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$, and $m^{\\ast} = 1$ otherwise.**\nThis option states that $m^{\\ast}=0$ when $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$. Our analysis shows that in this case, the slope is negative and the minimum is at $m^{\\ast}=1$. This option reverses the conditions derived from the model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The minimizing choice is always $m^{\\ast} = 0$ in respiratory epithelial cells because missing-self recognition by NK cells invariably dominates CD8 T cell surveillance.**\nThis is an absolute statement (\"always $m^{\\ast} = 0$\") that is contradicted by our analysis. The model shows that if the CTL response is weak enough (i.e., $a$ is sufficiently small such that $a < \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$), the optimal strategy for the infected cell is to set $m^{\\ast}=1$. The model is specifically designed to explore the trade-off, not to assume one arm of the immune system always dominates.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The minimizing choice is always $m^{\\ast} = 1$ because non-classical HLA-E fully inhibits NK cells independent of its expression level and activating ligands.**\nThis is another absolute statement (\"always $m^{\\ast} = 1$\") that is contradicted by our analysis. If the CTL response is strong enough ($a > \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$), the optimal strategy is $m^{\\ast}=0$. Furthermore, the reasoning provided is inconsistent with the model's equations. The NK hazard $h_{\\mathrm{NK}}$ is inversely proportional to $(1 + \\gamma e)$, so inhibition *does* depend on the HLA-E expression level $e$. It also depends on the activating ligand scale $g$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. There is an interior minimizer $m^{\\ast} = 1 - \\dfrac{a\\,(1 + \\gamma e)}{b\\,g}$ whenever $0 < \\dfrac{a\\,(1 + \\gamma e)}{b\\,g} < 1$; otherwise boundary values apply.**\nThe function $h(m)$ is linear in $m$. A linear function on a closed interval cannot have a unique interior minimum. Its minimum must lie on the boundary, unless the function is constant (slope is zero), in which case all points are minima. The derivative of $h(m)$ with respect to $m$ is the constant slope $S = a - \\dfrac{b\\,g}{1 + \\gamma e}$. Setting this to zero does not yield a solution for $m$, but rather a condition on the parameters. The second derivative is $\\dfrac{d^2h}{dm^2} = 0$, which does not satisfy the condition for a strict local minimum ($\\dfrac{d^2h}{dm^2} > 0$). Therefore, a unique interior minimizer does not exist.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

The classification should be returned as a boolean for each test case.\n\nDerivation constraints and numerical procedures:\n- The finite-difference derivative at an interior time $t_k$ for $k \\in \\{1,\\ldots,N-2\\}$ must use the central difference $$\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_k} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{k+1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{k-1})}{t_{k+1} - t_{k-1}}.$$ For endpoints, use the forward difference at $t_0$: $$\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_0} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{0})}{t_{1} - t_{0}},$$ and the backward difference at $t_{N-1}$: $$\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_{N-1}} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{N-1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{N-2})}{t_{N-1} - t_{N-2}}.$$\n- Fit $\\mathbf{K}$ row-wise: for each cytokine $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{IL6}, \\mathrm{IL1\\beta}, \\mathrm{TNF}\\}$, regress the derivative component $y_i(t_k)$ onto the predictors $[C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_k), C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_k), C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_k), 1]$ to estimate the coefficients $[K_{i1}, K_{i2}, K_{i3}, p_i]$ via ordinary least squares.\n\nTest suite (times in hours, concentrations in $\\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{mL}$):\n- Case $1$ (anticipated coupled, potentially oscillatory): times $\\{\\,0,\\,2,\\,4,\\,6,\\,8,\\,10\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,40,\\,62,\\,48,\\,46,\\,55,\\,60\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,30,\\,14,\\,26,\\,32,\\,24,\\,18\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,15,\\,16.5,\\,16.8,\\,16.9,\\,17.0,\\,17.05\\,\\}$.\n- Case $2$ (anticipated monotonic approach toward higher levels): times $\\{\\,0,\\,2,\\,4,\\,6,\\,8,\\,10\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,30,\\,40,\\,47,\\,51,\\,53,\\,54\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,12,\\,16,\\,19,\\,21,\\,22.2,\\,22.8\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,8,\\,10,\\,12,\\,13,\\,13.5,\\,13.8\\,\\}$.\n- Case $3$ (edge case with near-constant, weakly drifting signals): times $\\{\\,0,\\,2,\\,4,\\,6,\\,8,\\,10\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,50,\\,50.4,\\,50.8,\\,51.0,\\,51.1,\\,51.15\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,18,\\,18.05,\\,18.1,\\,18.15,\\,18.2,\\,18.25\\,\\}$; $C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_k)$ values $\\{\\,12,\\,12.02,\\,12.03,\\,12.035,\\,12.04,\\,12.045\\,\\}$.\n\nYour program must implement the described estimation and classification procedure for each case and produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, `[result1,result2,result3]`), where each result is a boolean indicating whether the dynamics are oscillatory ($\\mathrm{True}$) or monotonic ($\\mathrm{False}$).

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine whether the short-time dynamics of a tripartite cytokine network, consisting of Interleukin-6 ($C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}$), Interleukin-1 beta ($C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}$), and Tumor Necrosis Factor ($C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}$), are oscillatory or monotonic. The dynamics are modeled by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{K}\\,\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}(t) = [C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t), C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t), C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t)]^\\top$ is the state vector of cytokine concentrations, $\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$ is the Jacobian matrix representing interactions and clearance rates, and $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a constant vector of baseline production rates.\n\nThe nature of the dynamics (oscillatory vs. monotonic) is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$. Complex-conjugate eigenvalues correspond to oscillatory modes, while purely real eigenvalues correspond to monotonic modes of growth or decay. Our task is to estimate $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{p}$ from discrete time-series data and then classify the dynamics based on the eigenvalues of the estimated $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}$. The procedure involves three primary steps: numerical differentiation, parameter estimation via ordinary least squares (OLS), and eigenvalue analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Estimation of Derivatives**\n\nGiven time series data for each cytokine concentration $C_i(t_k)$ at $N$ discrete time points $t_0, t_1, \\ldots, t_{N-1}$, we must first estimate the time derivative $\\frac{d\\mathbf{C}}{dt}$ at each point. The problem specifies the use of finite-difference formulas.\n\nFor the first time point, $t_0$, a first-order forward difference is used:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_0} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{0})}{t_{1} - t_{0}}\n$$\n\nFor all interior time points, $t_k$ with $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, N-2\\}$, a second-order central difference is used for improved accuracy:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_k} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{k+1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{k-1})}{t_{k+1} - t_{k-1}}\n$$\n\nFor the last time point, $t_{N-1}$, a first-order backward difference is used:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{C}}{dt}\\Big|_{t_{N-1}} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{C}(t_{N-1}) - \\mathbf{C}(t_{N-2})}{t_{N-1} - t_{N-2}}\n$$\n\nApplying these formulas to the given data for each of the three cytokines yields a numerical estimate of the derivative vector $\\frac{d\\mathbf{C}}{dt}$ at each of the $N$ time points. Let us denote the matrix of estimated derivatives as $\\dot{\\mathbf{C}}_{\\text{est}}$, an $N \\times 3$ matrix where each column corresponds to a cytokine.\n\n**Step 2: System Identification via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**\n\nThe LTI model can be written for each cytokine $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{IL6}, \\mathrm{IL1\\beta}, \\mathrm{TNF}\\}$ at each time point $t_k$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i}{dt}\\Big|_{t_k} = K_{i1} C_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_k) + K_{i2} C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_k) + K_{i3} C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_k) + p_i\n$$\nHere, the terms $[K_{i1}, K_{i2}, K_{i3}]$ form the $i$-th row of the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$, and $p_i$ is the $i$-th component of the vector $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis is a multiple linear regression problem. We can solve for the unknown parameters for each cytokine independently. For a single cytokine $i$, we construct a system over all $N$ time points:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\dot{C}_{i,\\text{est}}(t_0) \\\\\n\\dot{C}_{i,\\text{est}}(t_1) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\dot{C}_{i,\\text{est}}(t_{N-1})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_0) & C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_0) & C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_0) & 1 \\\\\nC_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_1) & C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_1) & C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_1) & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nC_{\\mathrm{IL6}}(t_{N-1}) & C_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}(t_{N-1}) & C_{\\mathrm{TNF}}(t_{N-1}) & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nK_{i1} \\\\\nK_{i2} \\\\\nK_{i3} \\\\\np_i\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_0 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be expressed in compact matrix form as $\\mathbf{y}_i = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}_i + \\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i$. The design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $N \\times 4$ matrix whose first three columns are the concentration time series and whose last column is a vector of ones to account for the intercept term $p_i$. The vector $\\mathbf{y}_i$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of estimated derivatives for cytokine $i$. The vector $\\mathbf{\\beta}_i = [K_{i1}, K_{i2}, K_{i3}, p_i]^\\top$ contains the parameters to be estimated.\n\nThe OLS solution $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_i$ minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $\\|\\mathbf{y}_i - \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}_i\\|^2$, and is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_i = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}_i\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each of the three cytokines ($i = 1, 2, 3$) to obtain the estimates for all elements of $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{p}$. The resulting estimated Jacobian matrix is $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$.\n\n**Step 3: Eigenvalue Analysis and Classification**\n\nOnce the matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}$ has been estimated, its eigenvalues, $\\lambda_j$ for $j=1, 2, 3$, are computed. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\hat{\\mathbf{K}} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$. These eigenvalues can be real or complex.\n\nThe classification rule is as follows:\n-   If any eigenvalue $\\lambda_j$ has a non-zero imaginary part, the system exhibits oscillatory behavior. To account for numerical precision, we classify the dynamics as **oscillatory** if there exists at least one eigenvalue $\\lambda_j$ such that $|\\text{Im}(\\lambda_j)| > \\epsilon$, where the tolerance is given as $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$.\n-   If the imaginary parts of all eigenvalues are within this tolerance, i.e., $|\\text{Im}(\\lambda_j)| \\leq \\epsilon$ for all $j=1, 2, 3$, the dynamics are classified as **monotonic**.\n\nThis complete procedure is applied to each of the three test cases provided to determine the nature of the cytokine network dynamics under the given conditions.",
