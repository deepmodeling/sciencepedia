This process generates a vast, genetically diverse population of viral variants, known as a quasispecies, within a single infected host. This practice exercise  illustrates this fundamental concept by asking you to estimate the number of new mutants arising at a single genetic site in one replication cycle. Mastering this calculation helps build an intuition for why resistance-associated substitutions can pre-exist in a patient and how selective pressure from direct-acting antivirals can quickly lead to treatment failure.",

HCV is an RNA virus known for its high genetic variability, driven by a high mutation rate of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The given mutation rate, $\\mu = 10^{-5}$ per base per replication, and the viral population size, $N = 10^{9}$ genomes, are biologically plausible orders of magnitude for an *in vivo* HCV infection. The mechanism of DAA resistance arising from single-nucleotide polymorphisms is a well-established clinical and virological reality. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the expected value of a random variable (the number of mutants), providing all necessary parameters ($N$ and $\\mu$) and a clear set of assumptions (independence, one replication event per genome). A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It defines terms clearly and presents a quantitative question without any subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Flaw Check:**\n  - 1. Scientific/Factual Unsoundness: None.\n  - 2. Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant: None. The problem is a direct and formalizable application of probability theory to virology.\n  - 3. Incomplete/Contradictory Setup: None.

It is not trivial or tautological.\n  - 7. Outside Scientific Verifiability: None. The result is mathematically derivable and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks for the expected number of viral genomes that acquire a single-nucleotide mutation at a specific site during one round of replication.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of replicating genomes, where $N = 10^{9}$.\nLet $\\mu$ be the per-base mutation rate, which is the probability that a mutation occurs at the specific site for a single genome during its one replication event. Here, $\\mu = 10^{-5}$.\n\nWe can model the mutation event for each genome as a Bernoulli trial. Let us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each genome $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$.\nThe variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th genome acquires a mutation at the specific site.\n$X_i = 0$ if the $i$-th genome does not acquire a mutation at the specific site.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition of the per-base mutation rate, the probability of a mutation for a single genome is $P(X_i = 1) = \\mu$.\nConsequently, the probability of no mutation is $P(X_i = 0) = 1 - \\mu$.\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is given by:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot \\mu + 0 \\cdot (1 - \\mu) = \\mu$$\n\nThe total number of mutants in the population, let's call this random variable $M$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $N$ individual genomes:\n$$M = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of mutants, which is the expected value of $M$, denoted as $E[M]$.\nA fundamental property of expectation is the linearity of expectation, which states that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$E[M] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nSince each genome has the same probability of mutation $\\mu$, the expected value $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$.\n$$E[X_i] = \\mu \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$E[M] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu = N \\mu$$\nThis derivation uses only the definition of the mutation rate as a probability and the fundamental properties of expectation, satisfying the problem's constraint. The assumption of independence would be required to determine the full probability distribution of $M$ (which would be a binomial distribution, $M \\sim B(N, \\mu)$), but is not strictly necessary to find the expected value, due to the linearity of expectation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$N = 10^{9}$\n$\\mu = 10^{-5}$\n\nThe expected number of mutants is:\n$$E[M] = N \\mu = (10^{9}) \\times (10^{-5}) = 10^{9-5} = 10^{4}$$\nTherefore, the expected number of single-nucleotide mutants generated in one replication round is $10000$.",
