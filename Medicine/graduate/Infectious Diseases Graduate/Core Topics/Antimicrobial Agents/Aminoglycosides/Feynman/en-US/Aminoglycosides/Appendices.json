This model is a standard and widely used simplification for calculating loading doses for drugs like aminoglycosides, which primarily distribute into the extracellular fluid. The provided values for volume of distribution ($0.25$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$) and target concentration ($8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$) for gentamicin are clinically realistic. The problem is free of pseudoscience and is grounded in established pharmacological theory.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($W$, $C_{\\max}$, $V_{d}$) and definitions required to derive the formula and compute a unique numerical answer. The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language common to pharmacology and medicine. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the loading dose, $D_{L}$, that achieves a target peak concentration, $C_{\\max}$, immediately following IV administration and distribution.\n\n1.  The volume of distribution, $V_{d}$, is given as a specific volume per unit of body weight. The total volume of distribution for the patient, which we will denote as $V_{d, \\text{total}}$, is calculated by multiplying the specific volume by the patient's weight $W$.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n2.  The problem provides the definition of the volume of distribution as the ratio of the amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the concentration in the plasma, $C$, at distribution equilibrium.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = \\frac{A}{C}$$\n\n3.  The clinical goal is to achieve a peak concentration $C_{\\max}$ at distribution equilibrium. At this specific point in time, the concentration $C$ is equal to $C_{\\max}$, and the amount of drug in the body is $A$. The relationship is:\n    $$C_{\\max} = \\frac{A}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n4.  The problem states that for an IV dose, we can assume that the amount of drug in the body, $A$, immediately after administration and distribution is approximately equal to the administered loading dose, $D_{L}$. This is a key assumption based on the idea that distribution is rapid and elimination is negligible over this short period.\n    $$A \\approx D_{L}$$\n\n5.  By substituting $D_{L}$ for $A$ in the concentration equation, we can relate the loading dose directly to the target peak concentration.\n    $$C_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{D_{L}}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n6.  To find the expression for the loading dose, we rearrange the equation:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d, \\text{total}}$$\n\n7.  Finally, substituting the expression for $V_{d, \\text{total}}$ from step 1 gives the complete derived expression for the loading dose:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n### Statement of Assumptions\nAs required by the problem, the derivation relies on the following key pharmacokinetic assumptions:\n1.  **Single-Compartment Model**: The drug is assumed to distribute instantaneously and uniformly throughout a single, well-mixed volume (the volume of distribution). This implies that the drug concentration is the same throughout this conceptual compartment once distribution is complete.\n2.  **Negligible Elimination During Distribution**: It is assumed that no significant amount of the drug is eliminated (by metabolism or excretion) from the body during the administration and immediate post-administration distribution phase. This allows the amount of drug in the body at peak concentration to be equated to the total dose administered. This assumption is most valid for a rapid IV bolus injection.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe derived expression is now used to compute the numerical value of the loading dose using the given parameters.\n\n-   $C_{\\max} = 8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$\n-   $V_{d} = 0.25$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$\n-   $W = 70$ $\\text{kg}$\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\text{ mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.25 \\text{ L}/\\text{kg}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg})$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\text{mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (\\text{L}/\\text{kg}) \\times \\text{kg} = \\text{mg}$.\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\times 0.25 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = (2 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = 140 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact calculated value is $140$. To express this value unambiguously with three significant figures, it is written in scientific notation as $1.40 \\times 10^2$.",

Adjusted Body Weight ($AdjBW$) Calculation**\n\nThe problem states that the dosing weight should account for a fraction $f=0.4$ of the excess body weight. The excess body weight ($EBW$) is the difference between the Total Body Weight ($TBW$) and the Ideal Body Weight ($IBW$).\n$$EBW = TBW - IBW$$\nThe Adjusted Body Weight ($AdjBW$) is formulated as the Ideal Body Weight plus the contributing portion of the excess weight:\n$$AdjBW = IBW + f \\times (TBW - IBW)$$\nGiven $TBW = 110$ kg and $f = 0.4$, we substitute the values:\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 0.4 \\times (110 - 65.93700...)$$\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 0.4 \\times (44.06299...)$$\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 17.62519...$$\n$$AdjBW = 83.56220... \\text{ kg}$$\n\n**3.

The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and relationships are provided to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Half-Life Expression\n\nWe begin with the governing differential equation for first-order elimination:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -k\\,A(t) $$\nThis is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating:\n$$ \\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} \\frac{dA}{A} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k\\,dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A(0)) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $A(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = A(0) \\exp(-kt) $$\nBy definition, the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time it takes for the amount of drug to be reduced to half of its initial value, $A(0)$. We set $t = t_{1/2}$ and $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A(0)}{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{A(0)}{2} = A(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nDividing by $A(0)$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$, we obtain the standard expression for first-order half-life:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\nThe problem provides the pharmacokinetic identity $CL = k\\,V_{d}$. We can rearrange this to express the elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of clearance $CL$ and volume of distribution $V_{d}$:\n$$ k = \\frac{CL}{V_{d}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into our equation for $t_{1/2}$ yields the desired expression in terms of the clinically relevant parameters $CL$ and $V_{d}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL/V_{d}} = \\frac{V_{d} \\ln(2)}{CL} $$\n\n### Numerical Computation for the Patient\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $t_{1/2}$ for the given patient.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's total volume of distribution, $V_{d, \\text{total}}$. The problem states the volume of distribution per unit mass is $0.25$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}$ and the patient's mass is $60$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ V_{d, \\text{total}} = (0.25 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (60 \\, \\mathrm{kg}) = 15 \\, \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the patient's gentamicin systemic clearance, $CL$, using the clinical approximation $CL \\approx f \\cdot CL_{\\text{Cr}}$. The given values are $f = 0.8$ and $CL_{\\text{Cr}} = 40$ $\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n$$ CL = f \\cdot CL_{\\text{Cr}} = 0.8 \\times 40 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min} = 32 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min} $$\n\nThe final answer for $t_{1/2}$ is required in hours. We must ensure consistent units before performing the final calculation. The volume of distribution is in liters ($L$), and the clearance is in milliliters per minute ($\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min}$). We will convert the clearance to liters per hour ($\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}$).\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mL} $$\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{hr} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{min} $$\nSo, we convert $CL$:\n$$ CL = 32 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{L}}{1000 \\, \\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{min}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{32 \\times 60}{1000} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{hr}} = 1.92 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{hr}} $$\n\nNow we have $V_{d, \\text{total}} = 15$ $\\mathrm{L}$ and $CL = 1.92$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}$. We can substitute these values into our derived expression for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{V_{d, \\text{total}} \\ln(2)}{CL} = \\frac{15 \\, \\mathrm{L} \\times \\ln(2)}{1.92 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}} $$\nThe units $\\mathrm{L}$ cancel, leaving hours, as required. Using the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{15 \\times 0.693147...}{1.92} \\, \\mathrm{hr} \\approx \\frac{10.3972...}{1.92} \\, \\mathrm{hr} \\approx 5.41521... \\, \\mathrm{hr} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t_{1/2} \\approx 5.415 \\, \\mathrm{hr} $$",
