The provided numerical values for the substrate concentration $[S]$, the Michaelis constant $K_m$, and the $IC_{50}$ are physically realistic for a potent enzyme inhibitor system, such as a neuraminidase inhibitor. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and asks for a standard derivation and calculation based on fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation of the inhibition constant, $K_i$, begins with the definition of $IC_{50}$. The $IC_{50}$ is the inhibitor concentration, $[I]$, that reduces the initial reaction velocity, $v$, to $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$, at a fixed substrate concentration, $[S]$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ v = \\frac{1}{2} v_{0} \\quad \\text{when} \\quad [I] = IC_{50} $$\nThe problem provides the expressions for the inhibited and uninhibited velocities:\n$$ v = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} $$\n$$ v_{0} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]} $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $IC_{50}$ (with $[I]$ set to $IC_{50}$):\n$$ \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]} \\right) $$\nThe term $V_{\\max}[S]$ is present in the numerator on both sides and can be canceled, as it is non-$0$:\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} = \\dfrac{1}{2(K_{m} + [S])} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation yields:\n$$ K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S] = 2(K_{m} + [S]) $$\nWe can now expand and rearrange the equation to solve for $K_i$.\n$$ K_{m} + K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S] = 2K_{m} + 2[S] $$\nIsolating the term containing $K_i$:\n$$ K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) = (2K_{m} - K_{m}) + (2[S] - [S]) $$\n$$ K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) = K_{m} + [S] $$\nTo solve for $K_i$, we first isolate the fraction $\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}} = \\dfrac{K_{m} + [S]}{K_{m}} = 1 + \\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}} $$\nFinally, we solve for $K_i$:\n$$ K_{i} = \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}}} $$\nThis expression, known as the Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibitors, gives the inhibition constant $K_i$ in terms of the experimentally determined $IC_{50}$, the substrate concentration $[S]$, and the Michaelis constant $K_m$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $K_i$ using the provided numerical values:\nSubstrate concentration: $[S] = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\nMichaelis constant: $K_{m} = 25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\nInhibitory concentration $IC_{50}$: $IC_{50} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we note that the units for $[S]$ and $K_m$ are identical ($\\mathrm{\\mu M}$), so their ratio will be a dimensionless quantity, as required.
