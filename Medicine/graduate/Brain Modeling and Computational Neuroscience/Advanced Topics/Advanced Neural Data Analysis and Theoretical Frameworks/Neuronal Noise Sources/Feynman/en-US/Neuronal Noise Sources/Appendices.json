In a neuron, the conductive pathways through the membrane are no exception, giving rise to an irreducible level of noise known as Johnson-Nyquist noise. This first exercise  provides a foundational starting point by asking you to calculate the expected voltage noise across a simple passive membrane patch. By applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and linear circuit theory, you will see how the membrane's own resistance $R$ and capacitance $C$ not only set the stage for thermal noise but also shape its spectral content through low-pass filtering.",

            "problem": "A small isopotential patch of neuronal membrane at thermal equilibrium can be modeled as a linear passive element consisting of a membrane resistance $R$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C$. Assume the only intrinsic noise source is the thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) agitation of the membrane conductance and that there are no other biological noise sources (such as channel-state fluctuations) present. The membrane potential is recorded by an ideal, noise-free, infinite-impedance voltage amplifier whose front-end imposes an ideal brick-wall low-pass with a single-sided measurement bandwidth from $f=0$ to $f=B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the root-mean-square (RMS) membrane voltage noise for a passive neuronal membrane patch modeled as a parallel resistor-capacitor ($RC$) circuit, subject to thermal noise. The derivation must proceed from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and linear circuit theory.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe membrane patch is modeled as a leakage resistance $R$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C$. The only noise source is the thermal agitation of charge carriers within the conductor, which gives rise to Johnson–Nyquist noise. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a conductor with resistance $R$ at an absolute temperature $T$ produces thermal noise that can be represented by a noise current source $I_n$ in parallel with a noiseless resistor. The single-sided power spectral density (PSD) of this noise current, denoted $S_{I_n}(f)$ for frequencies $f \\ge 0$, is white (i.e., independent of frequency) and is given by:\n$$S_{I_n}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T}{R}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe circuit consists of this noise current source $I_n$ in parallel with the resistance $R$ and the capacitance $C$. The resulting noise voltage $V_n$ appears across this parallel combination. To find the PSD of the voltage, we first calculate the total complex impedance $Z(f)$ of the parallel $RC$ circuit. The admittance $Y(f)$ is the sum of the individual admittances:\n$$Y(f) = \\frac{1}{Z(f)} = \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{Z_C(f)}$$\nThe impedance of the capacitor is $Z_C(f) = \\frac{1}{j 2 \\pi f C}$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$. Thus, the total admittance is:\n$$Y(f) = \\frac{1}{R} + j 2 \\pi f C = \\frac{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C}{R}$$\nThe total impedance is the reciprocal of the admittance:\n$$Z(f) = \\frac{R}{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C}$$\nThe relationship between the power spectral densities of the input current and the output voltage is given by $S_{V_n}(f) = S_{I_n}(f) |Z(f)|^2$. The squared magnitude of the impedance is:\n$$|Z(f)|^2 = Z(f) Z^*(f) = \\left( \\frac{R}{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R}{1 - j 2 \\pi f R C} \\right) = \\frac{R^2}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_{I_n}(f)$ and $|Z(f)|^2$, we obtain the single-sided PSD of the membrane voltage noise:\n$$S_{V_n}(f) = \\left( \\frac{4 k_B T}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R^2}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2} \\right) = \\frac{4 k_B T R}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2}$$\nThis spectrum is not white; it is a Lorentzian function characteristic of an $RC$ low-pass filter.\n\nThe problem states that the voltage is measured by an ideal amplifier with a brick-wall low-pass filter of bandwidth $B$. This means we measure all noise power from frequency $f=0$ to $f=B$, and none for $f>B$.

Consequently, the time derivative of the voltage is zero: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. The measured output signal is the injected current, $I_{\\text{inj}}(t)$, required to maintain this constant potential.\n\nSubstituting $V=V_0$ into the current balance equation gives:\n$$ 0 = -[g_{L} (V_{0} - E_{L}) + g_{c}(t) (V_{0} - E_{c})] + I_{\\text{syn}}(t) + I_{\\text{inj}}(t) $$\nSolving for the clamp current $I_{\\text{inj}}(t)$:\n$$ I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = g_{L} (V_{0} - E_{L}) + g_{c}(t) (V_{0} - E_{c}) - I_{\\text{syn}}(t) $$\nWe substitute the detailed expressions for $g_{c}(t)$ and $I_{\\text{syn}}(t)$:\n$$ I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = g_{L} (V_{0} - E_{L}) + (g_{c0} + \\delta g(t)) (V_{0} - E_{c}) - \\delta I_{s}(t) $$\nWe can separate this into a mean current $\\langle I_{\\text{inj}} \\rangle$ and a fluctuating part $\\delta I_{\\text{inj}}(t)$:\n$$ I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = \\underbrace{[g_{L} (V_{0} - E_{L}) + g_{c0} (V_{0} - E_{c})]}_{\\langle I_{\\text{inj}} \\rangle} + \\underbrace{[(V_{0} - E_{c}) \\delta g(t) - \\delta I_{s}(t)]}_{\\delta I_{\\text{inj}}(t)} $$\nThe problem asks for the contribution of conductance noise, $\\delta g(t)$, to the observed output noise.

The ideal voltage clamp circuit directly reports the current flowing through the fluctuating conductance without any filtering by the membrane's passive properties ($C$ and $g_L$), as the voltage is fixed.\n\n**2. Analysis under Ideal Current Clamp (CC)**\n\nIn an ideal current clamp, the injected current is held constant at $I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_0$. The observed output signal is the membrane potential fluctuation, $\\delta V(t)$. We linearize the system around a steady-state operating point $(V_0, g_{c0})$. The steady-state is found by setting all time derivatives and fluctuations to zero in the current balance equation:\n$$ 0 = -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)] + I_0 $$\nThis requires setting $I_0 = g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)$.\n\nNow, we introduce small fluctuations around this steady state: $V(t) = V_0 + \\delta V(t)$, $g_c(t) = g_{c0} + \\delta g(t)$, $I_{\\text{syn}}(t) = \\delta I_s(t)$, with $I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_0$. Substituting these into the full current balance equation:\n$$ C \\frac{d}{dt}(V_0 + \\delta V) = -[g_L(V_0 + \\delta V - E_L) + (g_{c0} + \\delta g)(V_0 + \\delta V - E_c)] + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nExpanding and keeping only first-order terms in the small fluctuating quantities ($\\delta V$, $\\delta g$, $\\delta I_s$):\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} \\approx -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_L \\delta V + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c) + g_{c0}\\delta V + (V_0 - E_c)\\delta g] + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nThe second-order term $\\delta g \\delta V$ has been neglected. Rearranging the terms:\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)] - (g_L + g_{c0})\\delta V - (V_0 - E_c)\\delta g + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nUsing the steady-state condition $I_0 = g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)$ and the definition $g_T = g_L + g_{c0}$, the equation for the fluctuations simplifies to:\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} + g_T \\delta V(t) = -(V_0 - E_c)\\delta g(t) + \\delta I_s(t) $$\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation. To analyze its frequency response, we take the Fourier transform (with $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ and angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$):\n$$ C(j2\\pi f)\\tilde{V}(f) + g_T \\tilde{V}(f) = -(V_0 - E_c)\\tilde{g}(f) + \\tilde{I}_s(f) $$\nwhere $\\tilde{V}(f)$, $\\tilde{g}(f)$, and $\\tilde{I}_s(f)$ are the Fourier transforms of $\\delta V(t)$, $\\delta g(t)$, and $\\delta I_s(t)$ respectively.\nSolving for $\\tilde{V}(f)$:\n$$ \\tilde{V}(f) = \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)\\tilde{g}(f) + \\tilde{I}_s(f)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} $$\nThe contribution to the voltage fluctuation from the conductance noise $\\delta g(t)$ is:\n$$ \\tilde{V}_g(f) = \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} \\tilde{g}(f) $$\nThe PSD of this voltage fluctuation component is:\n$$ S_{V,g}(f) = \\left| \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} \\right|^2 S_g(f) = \\frac{(V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f) $$\nThe problem defines the \"equivalent output current under current clamp\" as the observed voltage fluctuation multiplied by the total conductance $g_T$. The PSD of the conductance-noise contribution to this equivalent current, which we denote $S_{\\text{CC},g}(f)$, is therefore $g_T^2$ times $S_{V,g}(f)$:\n$$ S_{\\text{CC},g}(f) = g_T^2 S_{V,g}(f) = \\frac{g_T^2 (V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f) $$\nThis expression is the denominator for the ratio $R(f)$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Ratio $R(f)$**\n\nThe ratio $R(f)$ is defined as the voltage-clamp contribution divided by the current-clamp contribution:\n$$ R(f) = \\frac{S_{\\text{VC},g}(f)}{S_{\\text{CC},g}(f)} = \\frac{(V_0 - E_c)^2 S_g(f)}{\\frac{g_T^2 (V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f)} $$\nThe terms $(V_0 - E_c)^2$ and $S_g(f)$ cancel, as long as $V_0 \\neq E_c$ and $S_g(f) \\neq 0$.\n$$ R(f) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{g_T^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2}} = \\frac{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2}{g_T^2} $$\nSimplifying, we obtain the final analytical expression for the ratio:\n$$ R(f) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi f C}{g_T}\\right)^2 $$\n\n**Justification of Suppression/Amplification:**\nThe form of $R(f)$ reveals the underlying physics. In current-clamp mode, the cell membrane acts as a passive low-pass RC filter. The noise current generated by conductance fluctuations, $-(V_0 - E_c)\\delta g(t)$, is filtered by the membrane impedance $Z_m(f) = \\frac{1}{g_T + j2\\pi f C}$. At higher frequencies, the capacitive term in the impedance shunts the current, thus attenuating the resulting voltage fluctuation $\\delta V(t)$. This is low-pass filtering. In contrast, an ideal voltage clamp has infinite gain and speed, effectively eliminating the membrane impedance from the measurement. It directly measures the current $(V_0-E_c)\\delta g(t)$ without any filtering. The ratio $R(f)$ quantifies this effect: it is unity at $f=0$ (where the capacitor acts as an open circuit) and grows as $f^2$ at high frequencies, reflecting the increasing attenuation of the signal in current clamp relative to the unfiltered signal in voltage clamp.\n\n**4.

Your final answer must be this expression, with no numerical substitution and no units attached. Do not simplify $\\delta$ into an inequality; report the exact expression only.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard theoretical comparison between two linearized models of subthreshold neuronal dynamics, a common topic in computational neuroscience. All necessary parameters and relationships are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises. I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the fractional deviation $\\delta \\equiv \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{current-noise}}[V]}{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{conductance-linearized}}[V]} - 1$. The voltage fluctuation is $v(t) = V(t) - \\bar{V}$, which implies $\\operatorname{Var}[V] = \\operatorname{Var}[v]$. We will calculate $\\operatorname{Var}[v]$ for each model.\n\nBoth models are driven by the same synaptic current fluctuation term, $\\delta I(t)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\delta I(t) = \\delta g_{e}(t)\\,(E_{e} - \\bar{V}) + \\delta g_{i}(t)\\,(E_{i} - \\bar{V})\n$$\nSince the conductance fluctuations $\\delta g_{e}(t)$ and $\\delta g_{i}(t)$ are independent, the power spectral density (PSD) of the total input current, $S_{I}(\\omega)$, is the sum of the PSDs of its constituent parts. The PSD of a variable scaled by a constant $c$ is $c^{2}$ times the original PSD. The conductance fluctuations $\\delta g_{e,i}(t)$ are given as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes with stationary variance $\\sigma_{e,i}^{2}$ and correlation time $\\tau_{s}$. The PSD of such a process is provided as $S_{\\text{OU}}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 \\sigma^{2} \\tau_{s}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2}}$.\n\nThe PSD of the input current is therefore:\n$$\nS_{I}(\\omega) = (E_{e} - \\bar{V})^{2} S_{\\delta g_{e}}(\\omega) + (E_{i} - \\bar{V})^{2} S_{\\delta g_{i}}(\\omega)\n$$\n$$\nS_{I}(\\omega) = (E_{e} - \\bar{V})^{2} \\frac{2 \\sigma_{e}^{2} \\tau_{s}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2}} + (E_{i} - \\bar{V})^{2} \\frac{2 \\sigma_{i}^{2} \\tau_{s}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nUsing the provided definition for the total synaptic fluctuation weight, $A \\equiv (E_{e} - \\bar{V})^{2} \\sigma_{e}^{2} + (E_{i} - \\bar{V})^{2} \\sigma_{i}^{2}$, the expression for the input PSD simplifies to:\n$$\nS_{I}(\\omega) = A \\frac{2 \\tau_{s}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the common input spectrum for both models.\n\n**1. Conductance-Linearized Model**\n\nThe dynamics of the voltage fluctuation $v_{1}(t)$ in this model are given by:\n$$\nC \\dot{v}_{1}(t) + g_{T} v_{1}(t) = \\delta I(t)\n$$\nThis is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. To find its transfer function, $H_{1}(\\omega)$, we apply the Fourier transform (with convention $f(t) \\to \\tilde{f}(\\omega)$ and $\\frac{d}{dt} \\to i\\omega$):\n$$\nC (i\\omega) \\tilde{v}_{1}(\\omega) + g_{T} \\tilde{v}_{1}(\\omega) = \\tilde{\\delta I}(\\omega)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{v}_{1}(\\omega) (g_{T} + i\\omega C) = \\tilde{\\delta I}(\\omega)\n$$\nThe transfer function is $H_{1}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{v}_{1}(\\omega)}{\\tilde{\\delta I}(\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{g_{T} + i\\omega C}$. The squared magnitude is:\n$$\n|H_{1}(\\omega)|^{2} = \\frac{1}{g_{T} + i\\omega C} \\frac{1}{g_{T} - i\\omega C} = \\frac{1}{g_{T}^{2} + \\omega^{2} C^{2}}\n$$\nWe define the effective membrane time constant for this model as $\\tau_{m,1} = C/g_{T}$. Then:\n$$\n|H_{1}(\\omega)|^{2} = \\frac{1}{g_{T}^{2} (1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{m,1}^{2})}\n$$\nThe output voltage variance, $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{conductance-linearized}}[V] = \\operatorname{Var}[v_{1}]$, is found by integrating the output PSD over all frequencies:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[v_{1}] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |H_{1}(\\omega)|^{2} S_{I}(\\omega) \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{g_{T}^{2} (1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{m,1}^{2})} A \\frac{2 \\tau_{s}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2}} \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[v_{1}] = \\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{\\pi g_{T}^{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{m,1}^{2})(1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2})} d\\omega\n$$\nThe integral can be solved using partial fraction decomposition. Letting $x=\\omega^2$, we have $\\frac{1}{(1+x\\tau_{m,1}^2)(1+x\\tau_s^2)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_s^2-\\tau_{m,1}^2} \\left( \\frac{\\tau_s^2}{1+x\\tau_s^2} - \\frac{\\tau_{m,1}^2}{1+x\\tau_{m,1}^2} \\right)$. Using the standard integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\omega}{1+a^2\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$, the integral becomes $\\frac{\\pi}{\\tau_s+\\tau_{m,1}}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{m,1}^{2})(1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{s}^{2})}d\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{\\tau_{m,1}+\\tau_s}\n$$\nSo, the variance is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[v_{1}] = \\frac{2 A \\tau_{s}}{2\\pi g_{T}^{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\tau_{m,1} + \\tau_{s}} \\right) = \\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{T}^{2} (\\tau_{m,1} + \\tau_{s})}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tau_{m,1} = C/g_{T}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{conductance-linearized}}[V] = \\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{T}^{2} (C/g_{T} + \\tau_{s})} = \\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{T}(C + g_{T}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\n\n**2. Current-Noise Leak-Only Model**\n\nThe dynamics of the voltage fluctuation $v_{2}(t)$ in this model are:\n$$\nC \\dot{v}_{2}(t) + g_{L} v_{2}(t) = \\delta I(t)\n$$\nThis equation is structurally identical to the previous one, with the total conductance $g_{T}$ replaced by the leak conductance $g_{L}$. We can therefore obtain the variance $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{current-noise}}[V] = \\operatorname{Var}[v_{2}]$ directly by substituting $g_{L}$ for $g_{T}$ in the previous result:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{current-noise}}[V] = \\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\n\n**3. Fractional Deviation $\\delta$**\n\nNow we compute the fractional deviation $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{current-noise}}[V]}{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{conductance-linearized}}[V]} - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}}{\\frac{A \\tau_{s}}{g_{T}(C + g_{T}\\tau_{s})}} - 1\n$$\nThe term $A \\tau_{s}$ cancels:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{g_{T}(C + g_{T}\\tau_{s})}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})} - 1\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{g_{T}(C + g_{T}\\tau_{s}) - g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{g_{T}C + g_{T}^{2}\\tau_{s} - g_{L}C - g_{L}^{2}\\tau_{s}}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\nGroup terms by $C$ and $\\tau_{s}$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{(g_{T} - g_{L})C + (g_{T}^{2} - g_{L}^{2})\\tau_{s}}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\nFactor the difference of squares term $g_{T}^{2} - g_{L}^{2} = (g_{T} - g_{L})(g_{T} + g_{L})$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{(g_{T} - g_{L})C + (g_{T} - g_{L})(g_{T} + g_{L})\\tau_{s}}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\nFinally, factor out the common term $(g_{T} - g_{L})$ in the numerator to arrive at the final expression:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{(g_{T} - g_{L})[C + (g_{T} + g_{L})\\tau_{s}]}{g_{L}(C + g_{L}\\tau_{s})}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of the required variables $g_{L}$, $g_{T}$, $C$, and $\\tau_{s}$.",
