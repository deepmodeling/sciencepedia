            "problem": "A small isopotential patch of neuronal membrane at thermal equilibrium can be modeled as a linear passive element consisting of a membrane resistance $R$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C$. Assume the only intrinsic noise source is the thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) agitation of the membrane conductance and that there are no other biological noise sources (such as channel-state fluctuations) present. The membrane potential is recorded by an ideal, noise-free, infinite-impedance voltage amplifier whose front-end imposes an ideal brick-wall low-pass with a single-sided measurement bandwidth from $f=0$ to $f=B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the root-mean-square (RMS) membrane voltage noise for a passive neuronal membrane patch modeled as a parallel resistor-capacitor ($RC$) circuit, subject to thermal noise. The derivation must proceed from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and linear circuit theory.\n\nThe membrane patch is modeled as a leakage resistance $R$ in parallel with a membrane capacitance $C$. The only noise source is the thermal agitation of charge carriers within the conductor, which gives rise to Johnson–Nyquist noise. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a conductor with resistance $R$ at an absolute temperature $T$ produces thermal noise that can be represented by a noise current source $I_n$ in parallel with a noiseless resistor. The single-sided power spectral density (PSD) of this noise current, denoted $S_{I_n}(f)$ for frequencies $f \\ge 0$, is white (i.e., independent of frequency) and is given by:\n$$S_{I_n}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T}{R}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe circuit consists of this noise current source $I_n$ in parallel with the resistance $R$ and the capacitance $C$. The resulting noise voltage $V_n$ appears across this parallel combination. To find the PSD of the voltage, we first calculate the total complex impedance $Z(f)$ of the parallel $RC$ circuit. The admittance $Y(f)$ is the sum of the individual admittances:\n$$Y(f) = \\frac{1}{Z(f)} = \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{Z_C(f)}$$\nThe impedance of the capacitor is $Z_C(f) = \\frac{1}{j 2 \\pi f C}$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$. Thus, the total admittance is:\n$$Y(f) = \\frac{1}{R} + j 2 \\pi f C = \\frac{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C}{R}$$\nThe total impedance is the reciprocal of the admittance:\n$$Z(f) = \\frac{R}{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C}$$\nThe relationship between the power spectral densities of the input current and the output voltage is given by $S_{V_n}(f) = S_{I_n}(f) |Z(f)|^2$. The squared magnitude of the impedance is:\n$$|Z(f)|^2 = Z(f) Z^*(f) = \\left( \\frac{R}{1 + j 2 \\pi f R C} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R}{1 - j 2 \\pi f R C} \\right) = \\frac{R^2}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_{I_n}(f)$ and $|Z(f)|^2$, we obtain the single-sided PSD of the membrane voltage noise:\n$$S_{V_n}(f) = \\left( \\frac{4 k_B T}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R^2}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2} \\right) = \\frac{4 k_B T R}{1 + (2 \\pi f R C)^2}$$\nThis spectrum is not white; it is a Lorentzian function characteristic of an $RC$ low-pass filter.\n\nThe problem states that the voltage is measured by an ideal amplifier with a brick-wall low-pass filter of bandwidth $B$. This means we measure all noise power from frequency $f=0$ to $f=B$, and none for $f>B$.

The Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\alpha^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\alpha \\partial \\beta} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\alpha} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\beta^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{N_{CO}}{\\alpha^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{N_{OC}}{\\beta^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $N_{CO} \\ge 0$, $N_{OC} \\ge 0$, $\\alpha^2 > 0$, and $\\beta^2 > 0$, the diagonal elements are non-positive. For a non-trivial path where transitions are observed ($N_{CO} > 0$ and $N_{OC} > 0$), the diagonal elements are strictly negative. The Hessian is negative definite, which confirms that the identified critical point is a local maximum. As the log-likelihood function is globally concave, this is the unique global maximum.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimators for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are therefore:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{N_{CO}}{T_C} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{N_{OC}}{T_O} $$",

The steady-state is found by setting all time derivatives and fluctuations to zero in the current balance equation:\n$$ 0 = -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)] + I_0 $$\nThis requires setting $I_0 = g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)$.\n\nNow, we introduce small fluctuations around this steady state: $V(t) = V_0 + \\delta V(t)$, $g_c(t) = g_{c0} + \\delta g(t)$, $I_{\\text{syn}}(t) = \\delta I_s(t)$, with $I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_0$. Substituting these into the full current balance equation:\n$$ C \\frac{d}{dt}(V_0 + \\delta V) = -[g_L(V_0 + \\delta V - E_L) + (g_{c0} + \\delta g)(V_0 + \\delta V - E_c)] + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nExpanding and keeping only first-order terms in the small fluctuating quantities ($\\delta V$, $\\delta g$, $\\delta I_s$):\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} \\approx -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_L \\delta V + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c) + g_{c0}\\delta V + (V_0 - E_c)\\delta g] + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nThe second-order term $\\delta g \\delta V$ has been neglected. Rearranging the terms:\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -[g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)] - (g_L + g_{c0})\\delta V - (V_0 - E_c)\\delta g + \\delta I_s + I_0 $$\nUsing the steady-state condition $I_0 = g_L(V_0 - E_L) + g_{c0}(V_0 - E_c)$ and the definition $g_T = g_L + g_{c0}$, the equation for the fluctuations simplifies to:\n$$ C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} + g_T \\delta V(t) = -(V_0 - E_c)\\delta g(t) + \\delta I_s(t) $$\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation. To analyze its frequency response, we take the Fourier transform (with $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ and angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$):\n$$ C(j2\\pi f)\\tilde{V}(f) + g_T \\tilde{V}(f) = -(V_0 - E_c)\\tilde{g}(f) + \\tilde{I}_s(f) $$\nwhere $\\tilde{V}(f)$, $\\tilde{g}(f)$, and $\\tilde{I}_s(f)$ are the Fourier transforms of $\\delta V(t)$, $\\delta g(t)$, and $\\delta I_s(t)$ respectively.\nSolving for $\\tilde{V}(f)$:\n$$ \\tilde{V}(f) = \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)\\tilde{g}(f) + \\tilde{I}_s(f)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} $$\nThe contribution to the voltage fluctuation from the conductance noise $\\delta g(t)$ is:\n$$ \\tilde{V}_g(f) = \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} \\tilde{g}(f) $$\nThe PSD of this voltage fluctuation component is:\n$$ S_{V,g}(f) = \\left| \\frac{-(V_0 - E_c)}{g_T + j2\\pi f C} \\right|^2 S_g(f) = \\frac{(V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f) $$\nThe problem defines the \"equivalent output current under current clamp\" as the observed voltage fluctuation multiplied by the total conductance $g_T$. The PSD of the conductance-noise contribution to this equivalent current, which we denote $S_{\\text{CC},g}(f)$, is therefore $g_T^2$ times $S_{V,g}(f)$:\n$$ S_{\\text{CC},g}(f) = g_T^2 S_{V,g}(f) = \\frac{g_T^2 (V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f) $$\nThis expression is the denominator for the ratio $R(f)$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Ratio $R(f)$**\n\nThe ratio $R(f)$ is defined as the voltage-clamp contribution divided by the current-clamp contribution:\n$$ R(f) = \\frac{S_{\\text{VC},g}(f)}{S_{\\text{CC},g}(f)} = \\frac{(V_0 - E_c)^2 S_g(f)}{\\frac{g_T^2 (V_0 - E_c)^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2} S_g(f)} $$\nThe terms $(V_0 - E_c)^2$ and $S_g(f)$ cancel, as long as $V_0 \\neq E_c$ and $S_g(f) \\neq 0$.\n$$ R(f) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{g_T^2}{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2}} = \\frac{g_T^2 + (2\\pi f C)^2}{g_T^2} $$\nSimplifying, we obtain the final analytical expression for the ratio:\n$$ R(f) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi f C}{g_T}\\right)^2 $$\n\n**Justification of Suppression/Amplification:**\nThe form of $R(f)$ reveals the underlying physics. In current-clamp mode, the cell membrane acts as a passive low-pass RC filter. The noise current generated by conductance fluctuations, $-(V_0 - E_c)\\delta g(t)$, is filtered by the membrane impedance $Z_m(f) = \\frac{1}{g_T + j2\\pi f C}$. At higher frequencies, the capacitive term in the impedance shunts the current, thus attenuating the resulting voltage fluctuation $\\delta V(t)$. This is low-pass filtering. In contrast, an ideal voltage clamp has infinite gain and speed, effectively eliminating the membrane impedance from the measurement. It directly measures the current $(V_0-E_c)\\delta g(t)$ without any filtering. The ratio $R(f)$ quantifies this effect: it is unity at $f=0$ (where the capacitor acts as an open circuit) and grows as $f^2$ at high frequencies, reflecting the increasing attenuation of the signal in current clamp relative to the unfiltered signal in voltage clamp.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe need to evaluate $R(f)$ at $f = 500 \\, \\text{Hz}$ using the given parameters:\n$C = 200 \\, \\text{pF} = 200 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F}$\n$g_L = 60 \\, \\text{nS} = 60 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{S}$\n$g_{c0} = 40 \\, \\text{nS} = 40 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{S}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total mean conductance $g_T$:\n$$ g_T = g_L + g_{c0} = (60 + 40) \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{S} = 100 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{S} = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{S} $$\nNext, calculate the term inside the parenthesis in the expression for $R(f)$:\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi f C}{g_T} = \\frac{2\\pi (500 \\, \\text{Hz})(200 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F})}{1 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{S}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi f C}{g_T} = \\frac{2\\pi (5 \\times 10^2)(2 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-12})}{1 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{2\\pi (10 \\times 10^4 \\times 10^{-12})}{1 \\times 10^{-7}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi f C}{g_T} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 10^5 \\times 10^{-12}}{10^{-7}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 10^{-7}}{10^{-7}} = 2\\pi $$\nFinally, substitute this back into the expression for $R(f)$:\n$$ R(500 \\, \\text{Hz}) = 1 + (2\\pi)^2 = 1 + 4\\pi^2 $$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$ R(500 \\, \\text{Hz}) \\approx 1 + 4 \\times (3.14159265...)^2 \\approx 1 + 4 \\times 9.8696044... \\approx 1 + 39.4784176... $$\n$$ R(500 \\, \\text{Hz}) \\approx 40.4784176... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $40.48$.",
