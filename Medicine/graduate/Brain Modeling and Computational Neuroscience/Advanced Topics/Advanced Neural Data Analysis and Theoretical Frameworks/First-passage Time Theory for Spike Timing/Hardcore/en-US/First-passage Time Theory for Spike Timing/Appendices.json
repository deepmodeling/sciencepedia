It is a valid problem that can be solved using standard methods from the theory of stochastic processes. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of First-Passage Time Moments\nTo simplify the analysis, we shift the coordinate system. Let $x_t = V_t - V_{\\mathrm{r}}$ represent the membrane potential relative to the reset value. The process starts at $x_0 = x(0) = V_0 - V_{\\mathrm{r}} = 0$. The neuron spikes when $x_t$ first reaches the threshold $H = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The SDE for $x_t$ remains unchanged since $V_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is a constant:\n$$\ndx_t = \\mu\\, dt + \\sigma\\, dW_t\n$$\nThe problem is to find the moments of the first-passage time $T = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : x_t \\ge H\\}$, starting from $x_0 = 0$. We can derive these moments by solving the backward Kolmogorov equation. Let $M_n(x) = \\mathbb{E}[T^n | x_0=x]$ be the $n$-th moment of the first-passage time to $H$, starting from $x  H$. The moments satisfy the recursive system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} M_n(x) = -n M_{n-1}(x), \\quad n \\ge 1\n$$\nwhere $M_0(x) = 1$, and $\\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the diffusion process:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mu \\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are determined by the nature of the problem. At the threshold $x=H$, the particle is absorbed, so the time to reach it is $0$. Thus, $M_n(H) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The problem does not specify a boundary at $x  0$. This implies the domain is $(-\\infty, H]$. For a physically meaningful solution where the moments are finite, we must impose a regularity condition as $x \\to -\\infty$. Since the drift $\\mu  0$, the process is guaranteed to eventually reach $H$.\n\n**Derivation of the Mean First-Passage Time, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$**\nFor $n=1$, we seek $M_1(x) = \\mathbb{E}[T | x_0=x]$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{dM_1}{dx} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\frac{d^2M_1}{dx^2} = -1\n$$\nLetting $u(x) = dM_1/dx$, we have a first-order linear ODE: $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} u' + \\mu u = -1$. The general solution is $u(x) = C_1 \\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x) - \\frac{1}{\\mu}$. Integrating $u(x)$ gives:\n$$\nM_1(x) = -\\frac{C_1\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x\\right) - \\frac{x}{\\mu} + C_2\n$$\nAs $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x)$ diverges since $\\mu  0$. For $M_1(x)$ to remain physically plausible (i.e., not diverge exponentially), we must set the coefficient of this term to zero, which implies $C_1 = 0$.\nThis simplifies the solution to $M_1(x) = -x/\\mu + C_2$. Applying the absorbing boundary condition $M_1(H) = 0$:\n$0 = -H/\\mu + C_2 \\implies C_2 = H/\\mu$.\nThus, the mean first-passage time from an arbitrary start position $x$ is $M_1(x) = (H-x)/\\mu$. For our problem, the neuron starts at $x=0$, so:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = M_1(0) = \\frac{H}{\\mu}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the Variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(T)$**\nTo find the variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2$, we must first find the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[T^2] = M_2(0)$. For $n=2$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{dM_2}{dx} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\frac{d^2M_2}{dx^2} = -2 M_1(x) = -2\\frac{H-x}{\\mu}\n$$\nLetting $v(x) = dM_2/dx$, we have $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} v' + \\mu v = \\frac{2x}{\\mu} - \\frac{2H}{\\mu}$. The general solution is $v(x) = v_h(x) + v_p(x)$, where the homogeneous part is $v_h(x) = A \\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x)$. A particular solution of the form $v_p(x) = ax+b$ yields $a=2/\\mu^2$ and $b = -2H/\\mu^2 - \\sigma^2/\\mu^3$.\n$$\nv(x) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x\\right) + \\frac{2(x-H)}{\\mu^2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}\n$$\nIntegrating $v(x)$ gives $M_2(x)$. Again, to prevent exponential divergence as $x \\to -\\infty$, we must set $A=0$.\n$$\nM_2(x) = \\int \\left( \\frac{2(x-H)}{\\mu^2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3} \\right) dx = \\frac{(x-H)^2}{\\mu^2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2 x}{\\mu^3} + B\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition $M_2(H) = 0$:\n$0 = \\frac{(H-H)^2}{\\mu^2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2 H}{\\mu^3} + B \\implies B = \\frac{\\sigma^2 H}{\\mu^3}$.\nThe full solution for the second moment is $M_2(x) = \\frac{(x-H)^2}{\\mu^2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2(H-x)}{\\mu^3}$.\nEvaluating at the starting position $x=0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T^2] = M_2(0) = \\frac{H^2}{\\mu^2} + \\frac{H\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}\n$$\nThe variance is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2 = \\left(\\frac{H^2}{\\mu^2} + \\frac{H\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{H}{\\mu}\\right)^2 = \\frac{H\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe given parameters are $H = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} = 20 \\;\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\mu = 5 \\;\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\sigma = 2 \\;\\mathrm{mV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ms}}$.\n\n**Firing Rate, $r$**\nThe mean interspike interval is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{H}{\\mu} = \\frac{20 \\;\\mathrm{mV}}{5 \\;\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{ms}} = 4 \\;\\mathrm{ms} = 4 \\times 10^{-3} \\;\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe firing rate is the reciprocal of the mean ISI:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} = \\frac{1}{4 \\times 10^{-3} \\;\\mathrm{s}} = 250 \\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 250 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $r = 250.0 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n**Coefficient of Variation, $\\mathrm{CV}$**\nThe variance of the interspike interval is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(T) = \\frac{H\\sigma^2}{\\mu^3} = \\frac{(20 \\;\\mathrm{mV})(2 \\;\\mathrm{mV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ms}})^2}{(5 \\;\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{ms})^3} = \\frac{20 \\times 4}{125} \\;\\mathrm{ms}^2 = 0.64 \\;\\mathrm{ms}^2\n$$\nThe coefficient of variation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(T)}}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.64 \\;\\mathrm{ms}^2}}{4 \\;\\mathrm{ms}} = \\frac{0.8 \\;\\mathrm{ms}}{4 \\;\\mathrm{ms}} = 0.2\n$$\nAs a unitless quantity rounded to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{CV} = 0.2000$.\n\n### Interpretation of the Role of Noise\nThe derived expressions for the firing rate and coefficient of variation allow for a clear interpretation of the effect of noise amplitude $\\sigma$.\n\n**Effect on Firing Rate ($r$)**\nThe firing rate is $r = 1/\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\mu/H$. This expression is independent of the noise amplitude $\\sigma$. Therefore, for this specific model, increasing $\\sigma$ (while keeping $\\mu$ and $H$ constant) does not alter the average firing rate. The noise introduces variability, causing some interspike intervals to be shorter and others longer than the deterministic time $H/\\mu$, but these fluctuations average out perfectly to leave the mean unchanged. This is a specific property of the perfect integrator model without leaks or other nonlinearities.\n\n**Effect on Spike-Time Regularity (CV)**\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(T)}/\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Using our derived expressions:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{H\\sigma^2/\\mu^3}}{H/\\mu} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{H}/\\mu^{3/2}}{H/\\mu} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{H\\mu}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that $\\mathrm{CV}$ is directly proportional to $\\sigma$. Since the $\\mathrm{CV}$ measures the normalized variability of the interspike intervals, a larger $\\mathrm{CV}$ implies less regular spiking. Therefore, increasing the noise amplitude $\\sigma$ increases the variability of the spike timing, making the neuron's firing pattern more irregular. In the limit $\\sigma \\to 0$, $\\mathrm{CV} \\to 0$, corresponding to perfectly periodic firing with interval $H/\\mu$.",

The task has two parts: determining the dynamics of the recentered process $X(t)$ and deriving the boundary value problem for its mean first-passage time $u(x)$.\n\n**Part 1: Dynamics of the Recentered Process $X(t)$**\n\nThe transformation is given by $X(t) = V(t) - \\mu$. To find the SDE for $X(t)$, we can differentiate this expression. Since $\\mu$ is a constant, its differential is zero, $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = 0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X(t) = \\mathrm{d}(V(t) - \\mu) = \\mathrm{d}V(t) - \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\mathrm{d}V(t)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given SDE for $\\mathrm{d}V(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X(t) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\big(V(t)-\\mu\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nBy the definition of the transformation, we have $X(t) = V(t) - \\mu$. Substituting this into the drift term yields the SDE for $X(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X(t) = -\\frac{X(t)}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThe initial condition for $X(t)$ is $X(0) = V(0) - \\mu = v_0 - \\mu = x_0$. This is a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process centered at $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Boundary Value Problem for the Mean First-Passage Time $u(x)$**\n\nFor a general time-homogeneous Itô diffusion in one dimension,\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = a(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t,\n$$\nthe mean first-passage time $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}[T \\,|\\, X(0)=x]$ to a boundary (in this case, an upper boundary at $b$) satisfies the following ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is a direct consequence of Dynkin's formula or can be derived using the backward Kolmogorov equation framework:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion process, defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = a(x)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\frac{1}{2}b(x)^2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nFor our recentered process $X(t)$, we identify the drift and diffusion coefficients from its SDE:\n- Drift coefficient: $a(x) = -\\frac{x}{\\tau}$\n- Diffusion coefficient: $b(x) = \\sigma$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the generator $\\mathcal{L}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{x}{\\tau}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nApplying this generator to $u(x)$ and setting the result to $-1$ gives the governing ODE for the MFPT:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,u''(x) - \\frac{x}{\\tau}\\,u'(x) = -1\n$$\nThis equation is valid for all starting positions $x$ from which the process has not yet reached the boundary, i.e., for $x  b$.\n\n**Part 3: Boundary Conditions**\n\nWe need two boundary conditions to uniquely solve this second-order ODE.\n1.  **Absorbing boundary at $b$:** The stopping time $T$ is defined as the first time the process hits or exceeds the threshold. If the process starts exactly at the threshold, $X(0)=b$, the time taken is $T=0$. Thus, the mean time is also zero. This gives the boundary condition:\n    $$\n    u(b) = 0\n    $$\n2.  **Boundary at $x \\to -\\infty$:** The drift term $-x/\\tau$ is restoring; for $x0$, the drift is positive, pushing the process towards $0$. This means the process cannot escape to $-\\infty$. A particle starting far in the negative domain will first drift towards the vicinity of $0$ and then fluctuate until it eventually hits $b$. The time taken for this is expected to be large but finite. Thus, we require that the mean first-passage time does not diverge as the starting point goes to negative infinity. The appropriate boundary condition is:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x) \\text{ is finite.}\n    $$\n\n**Summary of the Correct Characterization**\n- The recentered process is $\\mathrm{d}X(t) = -\\frac{X(t)}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\n- The MFPT $u(x)$ solves the boundary value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,u''(x) - \\frac{x}{\\tau}\\,u'(x) = -1, \\quad \\text{for } x  b,\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $u(b)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x)$ is finite.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The recentered process obeys $\\mathrm{d}X(t)= -\\frac{X(t)}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $X(0)=x_0$, and $u(x)$ solves $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,u''(x) - \\frac{x}{\\tau}\\,u'(x) = -1, \\quad \\text{for } xb,\\quad \\text{with}\\quad u(b)=0\\ \\text{and}\\ \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x) \\ \\text{finite}.$**\nThis option correctly states the SDE for the recentered process $X(t)$. It also correctly states the differential equation for the MFPT, $\\mathcal{L}u(x)=-1$. The domain $xb$ is correct. The absorbing boundary condition $u(b)=0$ is correct. The condition on the behavior at negative infinity, that $u(x)$ remains finite, is also correct for this stable process. This option perfectly matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The recentered process obeys $\\mathrm{d}X(t)= -\\frac{X(t)-\\mu}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $X(0)=x_0$, and $u(x)$ solves $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,u''(x) - \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\tau}\\,u'(x) = -1, \\quad \\text{for } x\\theta,\\quad \\text{with}\\quad u(\\theta)=0\\ \\text{and}\\ \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x)=0.$**\nThis option presents an incorrect SDE for the recentered process; the transformation $X(t) = V(t) - \\mu$ eliminates $\\mu$ from the drift term, which this option fails to do. Consequently, the ODE for $u(x)$ is also incorrect. Furthermore, the domain is specified as $x\\theta$ and the boundary condition as $u(\\theta)=0$; these should be in terms of the transformed variable $b = \\theta - \\mu$. Finally, the condition $\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x)=0$ is incorrect; the MFPT from far away will be large and positive, not zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The recentered process obeys $\\mathrm{d}X(t)= -\\frac{X(t)}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $X(0)=x_0$, and the hitting problem reduces to a standard OU first-passage to the shifted threshold $b=\\theta+\\mu$, with $u(x)$ solving $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,u''(x) - \\frac{x}{\\tau}\\,u'(x) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } xb,\\quad \\text{with}\\quad u(b)=1\\ \\text{and}\\ \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} u(x) \\ \\text{finite}.$**\nThe SDE is correct, but the definition of the shifted threshold is wrong; it should be $b = \\theta - \\mu$. The ODE is $\\mathcal{L}u(x) = 0$, which is the equation for the hitting probability, not the mean first-passage time. The boundary condition $u(b)=1$ is also characteristic of a hitting probability problem, not an MFPT problem (which requires $u(b)=0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The recentered process obeys $\\mathrm{d}X(t)= -\\frac{X(t)}{\\tau}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $X(0)=x_0$, and $u(x)$ solves the forward Kolmogorov equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}(x,t) + \\frac{x}{\\tau}\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x,t), ...$**\nThe SDE is stated correctly. However, the rest of the option is fundamentally flawed. The mean first-passage time $u(x)$ is a function of the starting position $x$ only, not time $t$. The equation provided is a partial differential equation for a function $u(x,t)$, which typically represents a probability density or survival probability. The MFPT is derived from the *backward* Kolmogorov equation, not the *forward* one. Moreover, the presented PDE has the wrong sign for the drift term; it is not the correct forward Kolmogorov (Fokker-Planck) equation for the process.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the difference between the Mean First-Passage Times (MFPTs) for a stochastic process under the Itô and Stratonovich interpretations. The process describes the membrane potential $V(t)$ of a neuron model.\n\nA fundamental tool for computing the MFPT, denoted $T(x)$, for a one-dimensional time-homogeneous Itô diffusion process $dX_t = a(X_t) dt + b(X_t) dW_t$ is the backward Kolmogorov equation. Let the process start at $X_0 = x$, and let the first-passage time to a threshold $\\theta$ be $\\tau = \\inf\\{t0 : X_t = \\theta\\}$. Then, the MFPT $T(x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\tau | X_0=x]$ satisfies the following second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ a(x) \\frac{dT}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}b^2(x) \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -1 $$\nThe boundary conditions depend on the nature of the boundaries. In this problem, a spike is triggered when $V(t)$ reaches the threshold $\\theta$, which acts as an absorbing boundary. Therefore, the time to reach the boundary, starting from the boundary itself, is zero. This gives the boundary condition $T(\\theta)=0$. The problem states that the lower boundary at $V=0$ is natural, which means it is inaccessible in finite time. This condition will be used to select the physically appropriate solution from the general solution of the ODE.\n\nFirst, we analyze the Itô case, and then the Stratonovich case by converting its SDE to the equivalent Itô form.\n\n**1. Mean First-Passage Time for the Itô Interpretation**\n\nThe SDE is given by:\n$$ dV_{t}=\\lambda V_{t}\\,dt+\\gamma V_{t}\\,dW_{t} $$\nThis is in the standard Itô form with drift $a(V) = \\lambda V$ and diffusion $b(V) = \\gamma V$. The backward Kolmogorov equation for the MFPT, which we denote $T_{\\text{It\\^o}}(V)$, is:\n$$ \\lambda V \\frac{dT_{\\text{It\\^o}}}{dV} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma V)^2 \\frac{d^2T_{\\text{It\\^o}}}{dV^2} = -1 $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V^2 \\frac{d^2T_{\\text{It\\^o}}}{dV^2} + \\lambda V \\frac{dT_{\\text{It\\^o}}}{dV} = -1 $$\n\n**2. Mean First-Passage Time for the Stratonovich Interpretation**\n\nThe SDE is given by:\n$$ dV_{t}=\\lambda V_{t}\\,dt+\\gamma V_{t}\\circ dW_{t} $$\nTo use the backward Kolmogorov equation, which is formulated for Itô processes, we must first convert this Stratonovich SDE into its Itô equivalent. A Stratonovich SDE $dX_t = f(X_t)dt + g(X_t)\\circ dW_t$ is equivalent to an Itô SDE $dX_t = a(X_t)dt + b(X_t)dW_t$ where the diffusion coefficient is the same, $b(x) = g(x)$, and the drift coefficient is modified by a correction term:\n$$ a(x) = f(x) + \\frac{1}{2}g'(x)g(x) $$\nIn our problem, $f(V) = \\lambda V$ and $g(V) = \\gamma V$. The derivative of $g(V)$ with respect to $V$ is $g'(V) = \\gamma$. The correction term is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma)(\\gamma V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V$.\nThe effective Itô drift for the Stratonovich process is:\n$$ a_{\\text{eff}}(V) = \\lambda V + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V = \\left(\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2\\right)V $$\nThe diffusion term remains $b(V) = \\gamma V$.\nThe backward Kolmogorov equation for the MFPT under the Stratonovich interpretation, $T_{\\text{Strat}}(V)$, is thus:\n$$ \\left(\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2\\right)V \\frac{dT_{\\text{Strat}}}{dV} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma V)^2 \\frac{d^2T_{\\text{Strat}}}{dV^2} = -1 $$\n\n**3. Solving the General ODE**\n\nBoth ODEs for $T_{\\text{It\\^o}}(V)$ and $T_{\\text{Strat}}(V)$ are of the form of a general Euler-Cauchy equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V^2 \\frac{d^2T}{dV^2} + A V \\frac{dT}{dV} = -1 $$\nwhere $A = \\lambda$ for the Itô case and $A = \\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2$ for the Stratonovich case.\n\nTo solve this ODE, we first find the solution to the homogeneous equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V^2 \\frac{d^2T}{dV^2} + A V \\frac{dT}{dV} = 0 $$\nAssuming a solution of the form $T(V) = V^k$, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 k(k-1) + A k = 0 \\implies k \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2(k-1) + A \\right) = 0 $$\nThe roots are $k_1 = 0$ and $k_2 = 1 - \\frac{2A}{\\gamma^2}$.\nThe homogeneous solution is $T_h(V) = C_1 V^0 + C_2 V^{1-2A/\\gamma^2} = C_1 + C_2 V^{1-2A/\\gamma^2}$.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution, $T_p(V)$. By inspection, a logarithmic function is a good candidate. Let's try $T_p(V) = K \\ln V$. Then $\\frac{dT_p}{dV} = \\frac{K}{V}$ and $\\frac{d^2T_p}{dV^2} = -\\frac{K}{V^2}$. Substituting into the non-homogeneous ODE:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V^2 \\left(-\\frac{K}{V^2}\\right) + A V \\left(\\frac{K}{V}\\right) = -1 $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 K + A K = -1 \\implies K\\left(A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2\\right) = -1 \\implies K = -\\frac{1}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\nThe particular solution is $T_p(V) = -\\frac{\\ln V}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2}$.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$ T(V) = C_1 + C_2 V^{1-\\frac{2A}{\\gamma^2}} - \\frac{\\ln V}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions.\nThe first condition is absorption at the threshold: $T(\\theta) = 0$.\nThe second condition relates to the natural boundary at $V=0$. The exponent $1-\\frac{2A}{\\gamma^2}$ is negative for both cases. For Itô, $A=\\lambda$, and the problem states $\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2  0$, so $\\lambda  \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2$, which implies $\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\gamma^2}  1$ and $1-\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\gamma^2}  0$. For Stratonovich, $A=\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2$, so the exponent is $1 - \\frac{2(\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2)}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\gamma^2} - 1 = -\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\gamma^2}  0$.\nSince the exponent is negative, the term $V^{1-\\frac{2A}{\\gamma^2}}$ diverges as $V \\to 0$. The logarithmic term also diverges as $V \\to 0$. For the MFPT to be physically meaningful for $V0$, we must eliminate the possibility of a non-physical divergence. The natural boundary condition implies that we must choose the solution that is well-behaved, which in this context means setting the coefficient of the more singular term to zero. Since $V^{k}$ with $k0$ diverges faster than $\\ln V$, we set $C_2 = 0$.\n\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$ T(V) = C_1 - \\frac{\\ln V}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\nApplying the condition $T(\\theta) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = C_1 - \\frac{\\ln \\theta}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} \\implies C_1 = \\frac{\\ln \\theta}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\nThus, the specific solution for the MFPT is:\n$$ T(V) = \\frac{\\ln \\theta}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} - \\frac{\\ln V}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V)}{A - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\n\n**4. Calculating the Difference in MFPTs**\n\nWe now substitute the specific values of $A$ for each interpretation, starting from $V(0)=V_r$.\n\nFor the Itô case, $A = \\lambda$:\n$$ T_{\\text{It\\^o}}(V_r) = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V_r)}{\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} $$\nThe denominator is positive by the problem's explicit condition $\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2  0$.\n\nFor the Stratonovich case, $A = \\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2$:\n$$ T_{\\text{Strat}}(V_r) = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V_r)}{(\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2) - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V_r)}{\\lambda} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{It\\^o}}(V_{r})-T_{\\text{Strat}}(V_{r})$:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V_r)}{\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} - \\frac{\\ln(\\theta/V_r)}{\\lambda} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{V_r}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{V_r}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda - (\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2)}{\\lambda(\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2)} \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{V_r}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2}{\\lambda(\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2)} \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{V_r}\\right)}{\\lambda\\left(\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2\\right)} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the difference in Mean First-Passage Times.\nSince $\\theta  V_r$, $\\ln(\\theta/V_r)0$. All parameters $\\lambda, \\gamma$ are positive, and $\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2  0$. Therefore, $\\Delta T0$, implying that the MFPT is longer under the Itô interpretation. This is because the Stratonovich interpretation includes a noise-induced positive drift term $\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^2 V$, which helps the potential reach the threshold $\\theta$ faster on average.",
