            "problem": "In the Bayesian brain hypothesis, cortical computation is often modeled as probabilistic inference that combines internally generated predictions (priors) with incoming sensory evidence (likelihoods), with the relative influence modulated by precision (inverse variance).

Starting only from Bayes' rule $p(s\\mid x)\\propto p(x\\mid s)\\,p(s)$ and the definition of precision as the inverse of variance, derive the posterior distribution $p(s\\mid x)$ by explicitly completing the square in the exponent of the product of Gaussians. Then, compute the posterior mean and posterior variance of $s$ given $x$, and interpret the posterior mean as a precision-weighted average of the prior mean and the observed value. \n\nExpress your final answer as a single row matrix containing the posterior mean and posterior variance, in exact symbolic form as functions of $x$. No rounding is required. No physical units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the posterior distribution $p(s \\mid x)$ for a latent variable $s$ given an observation $x$, based on a specified prior $p(s)$ and likelihood $p(x \\mid s)$. The derivation must proceed from Bayes' rule by completing the square in the exponent of the product of Gaussian densities. Subsequently, the posterior mean and variance are to be computed and interpreted.\n\nThe provided distributions are:\n1.  Prior distribution for $s$: $p(s) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{prior}, \\sigma_{prior}^2)$, where the mean is $\\mu_{prior} = 0$ and the variance is $\\sigma_{prior}^2 = 1$.\n2.  Likelihood of observation $x$ given $s$: $p(x \\mid s) = \\mathcal{N}(s, \\sigma_{like}^2)$, where the variance is $\\sigma_{like}^2 = 0.25$. Note that the mean of this distribution is the latent variable $s$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for a general Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by $f(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nThus, the specific PDFs for the prior and likelihood are:\n$p(s) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(1)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-0)^2}{2(1)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right)$\n$p(x \\mid s) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(0.25)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-s)^2}{2(0.25)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.5\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-s)^2}{0.5}\\right)$\n\nAccording to Bayes' rule, the posterior distribution $p(s \\mid x)$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$p(s \\mid x) \\propto p(x \\mid s) p(s)$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the PDFs, we get:\n$p(s \\mid x) \\propto \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.5\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-s)^2}{0.5}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right) \\right]$\n\nSince we are working with proportionality, the constant normalization factors can be ignored. The posterior is proportional to the exponential part:\n$p(s \\mid x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-s)^2}{0.5}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-s)^2}{0.5} - \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right)$\n\nLet's analyze the exponent, which we denote as $\\Phi(s)$:\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(\\frac{(s-x)^2}{0.5} + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right) = -\\left(2(s-x)^2 + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right)$\n\nTo identify the form of the posterior distribution, we expand the terms in the exponent and collect powers of $s$. A posterior of Gaussian form $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{post}, \\sigma_{post}^2)$ will have an exponent of the form $-\\frac{(s-\\mu_{post})^2}{2\\sigma_{post}^2} + C$, where $C$ is a constant with respect to $s$.\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(2(s^2 - 2sx + x^2) + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right)$\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(2s^2 - 4sx + 2x^2 + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right)$\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)s^2 - 4sx + 2x^2\\right)$\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(\\frac{5}{2}s^2 - 4sx + 2x^2\\right)$\n\nNow, we complete the square for the terms involving $s$. The general form is $As^2+Bs+C$. We factor out $A$ from the terms involving $s$: $A(s^2 + \\frac{B}{A}s) + C = A\\left(s+\\frac{B}{2A}\\right)^2 + C - \\frac{B^2}{4A}$.\nIn our expression, the term in the parenthesis is $\\frac{5}{2}s^2 - 4sx + 2x^2$. Here, $A = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $B = -4x$.\n$\\frac{5}{2}s^2 - 4sx + 2x^2 = \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s^2 - \\frac{2}{5}(4x)s\\right) + 2x^2$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s^2 - \\frac{8x}{5}s\\right) + 2x^2$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left[\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2\\right] + 2x^2$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{5}{2}\\left(\\frac{16x^2}{25}\\right) + 2x^2$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{8x^2}{5} + 2x^2$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{8x^2}{5} + \\frac{10x^2}{5}$\n$= \\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 + \\frac{2x^2}{5}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Phi(s)$:\n$\\Phi(s) = -\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 + \\frac{2x^2}{5}\\right) = -\\frac{5}{2}\\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{2x^2}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the posterior distribution is:\n$p(s \\mid x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\left(s - \\frac{4x}{5}\\right)^2\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2x^2}{5}\\right)$\n\nThe term $\\exp(-2x^2/5)$ is constant with respect to $s$ and can be absorbed into the normalization constant. The remaining expression has the form of a Gaussian PDF for $s$:\n$p(s \\mid x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s - \\mu_{post})^2}{2\\sigma_{post}^2}\\right)$\n\nBy comparing the derived exponent with the general form, we can identify the posterior mean $\\mu_{post}$ and posterior variance $\\sigma_{post}^2$:\n$\\mu_{post} = \\frac{4x}{5}$\n$\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{post}^2} = \\frac{5}{2} \\implies \\sigma_{post}^2 = \\frac{1}{5}$\n\nSo, the posterior distribution is a Gaussian: $p(s \\mid x) = \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\frac{4x}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$.\nThe posterior mean is $\\mu_{post} = \\frac{4x}{5}$.\nThe posterior variance is $\\sigma_{post}^2 = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTo interpret the posterior mean as a precision-weighted average, we first define precisions. Precision $\\lambda$ is the inverse of variance, $\\lambda = 1/\\sigma^2$.\nPrior precision: $\\lambda_{prior} = 1/\\sigma_{prior}^2 = 1/1 = 1$.\nLikelihood precision: $\\lambda_{like} = 1/\\sigma_{like}^2 = 1/0.25 = 4$.\n\nThe general formula for the posterior mean $\\mu_{post}$ in the case of a Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood is a precision-weighted average of the prior mean $\\mu_{prior}$ and the data $x$ (which is the mean of the likelihood function evaluated at $s=x$):\n$\\mu_{post} = \\frac{\\lambda_{prior}\\mu_{prior} + \\lambda_{like}x}{\\lambda_{prior} + \\lambda_{like}}$\nThe posterior precision is the sum of the prior and likelihood precisions:\n$\\lambda_{post} = \\lambda_{prior} + \\lambda_{like}$\nAnd the posterior variance is the inverse of the posterior precision:\n$\\sigma_{post}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{post}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{prior} + \\lambda_{like}}$\n\nLet's verify our results using these general formulas with the given values:\n$\\mu_{prior} = 0$, $\\lambda_{prior} = 1$, $\\lambda_{like} = 4$.\n$\\mu_{post} = \\frac{(1)(0) + (4)x}{1 + 4} = \\frac{4x}{5}$\n$\\sigma_{post}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + 4} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n\nThe results match perfectly. The interpretation is that the posterior mean $\\mu_{post}$ is a weighted average of the prior's belief about the mean ($\\mu_{prior}=0$) and the sensory evidence ($x$). The weights are the respective precisions. The data has a precision of $4$ while the prior has a precision of $1$, so the sensory data has four times the influence on the final estimate as the prior belief. This can be seen by writing the posterior mean as:\n$\\mu_{post} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{prior}}{\\lambda_{prior}+\\lambda_{like}}\\right)\\mu_{prior} + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{like}}{\\lambda_{prior}+\\lambda_{like}}\\right)x = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)x = \\frac{4x}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer requires the posterior mean and posterior variance in a single row matrix.\nPosterior mean: $\\frac{4x}{5}$\nPosterior variance: $\\frac{1}{5}$",

The posterior precision ($1/\\sigma_{\\text{post}}^2$) is the sum of the prior and likelihood precisions:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\text{post}}^2} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nThe posterior mean, $\\mu_{\\text{post}}$, is a precision-weighted average of the prior mean $\\mu_p$ and the sensory measurement $x$:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{post}} = \\sigma_{\\text{post}}^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2} + \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p + \\tau_p^2 x}{\\sigma^2 + \\tau_p^2}\n$$\n\nThe observer makes a \"right\" decision if the posterior evidence favors the \"right\" category. With a symmetric loss function, this corresponds to deciding \"right\" if the posterior mean of the stimulus is greater than $0$:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{post}} > 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_{\\text{post}}$ and solving for $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p + \\tau_p^2 x}{\\sigma^2 + \\tau_p^2} > 0 \\implies \\tau_p^2 x > -\\sigma^2 \\mu_p \\implies x > -\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2}\n$$\nThis defines a decision threshold, $T = -\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2}$, on the sensory measurement $x$. The observer chooses \"right\" if and only if $x > T$.\n\nThe probability of choosing \"right\" for a given stimulus $s$, denoted $p_{\\text{bayes\\_right}}(s)$, is the probability that the random measurement $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(s, \\sigma^2)$ exceeds this threshold $T$:\n\n$$\np_{\\text{bayes\\_right}}(s) = P(x > T \\mid s)\n$$\n\nThis probability can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$ where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n\n$$\np_{\\text{bayes\\_right}}(s) = P\\left(\\frac{x-s}{\\sigma} > \\frac{T-s}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{T-s}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{T-s}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{s-T}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $T$:\n\n$$\np_{\\text{bayes\\_right}}(s) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{s - (-\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2})}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{s + \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we incorporate the lapse rate $\\lambda$, which is the probability of making a random choice regardless of the stimulus. With probability $1-\\lambda$, the observer follows the Bayesian decision rule, and with probability $\\lambda$, the observer guesses, choosing \"right\" with probability $0.5$. The full psychometric function $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s)$ is therefore a mixture model:\n\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{right}}(s) = (1 - \\lambda) p_{\\text{bayes\\_right}}(s) + 0.5 \\lambda\n$$\n\n### Model Definitions and Specialization\n\nWe consider two distinct models of suboptimality:\n\n1.  **Incorrect-Prior Model:** Suboptimality arises from a biased or incorrectly calibrated prior. Here, the sensory noise $\\sigma$ is assumed to be known and fixed at a baseline value $\\sigma_0$. The free parameters to be fitted are the prior mean $\\mu_p$, the prior standard deviation $\\tau_p$, and the lapse rate $\\lambda$. The psychometric function is:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s; \\mu_p, \\tau_p, \\lambda | \\sigma_0) = (1-\\lambda) \\Phi\\left( \\frac{s + \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2}}{\\sigma_0} \\right) + 0.5 \\lambda\n    $$\n\n2.  **Incorrect-Noise Model:** Suboptimality arises from elevated sensory noise. Here, the prior is assumed to be \"flat\" or uninformative, which corresponds to setting $\\mu_p=0$ and letting $\\tau_p \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the decision threshold $T = -\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\mu_p}{\\tau_p^2}$ approaches $0$. The decision rule simplifies to $x > 0$. The free parameters are the sensory noise standard deviation $\\sigma$ and the lapse rate $\\lambda$. The psychometric function becomes:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s; \\sigma, \\lambda) = (1-\\lambda) \\Phi\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sigma}\\right) + 0.5 \\lambda\n    $$\n\n### Model Fitting and Comparison\n\nTo fit these models to data, we use maximum likelihood estimation. The data consist of pairs $(k_i, n_i)$ for each stimulus level $s_i$, where $k_i$ is the number of \"right\" choices out of $n_i$ total trials. The likelihood of observing $k_i$ for a given $s_i$ follows a binomial distribution:\n\n$$\nL_i(\\theta) = P(k_i \\mid n_i, s_i; \\theta) = \\binom{n_i}{k_i} p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s_i; \\theta)^{k_i} (1 - p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s_i; \\theta))^{n_i - k_i}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ represents the set of free parameters for a given model. The total log-likelihood is the sum over all stimulus levels: $\\ln \\hat{L}(\\theta) = \\sum_i \\ln L_i(\\theta)$. We seek the parameters $\\hat{\\theta}$ that maximize this function, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL).\n\nFor model comparison, we use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):\n$$\n\\mathrm{BIC} = k \\ln N - 2 \\ln \\hat{L}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of free parameters in the model ($k=3$ for the prior model, $k=2$ for the noise model), $N = \\sum_i n_i$ is the total number of trials, and $\\hat{L}$ is the maximized likelihood value. The model with the lower BIC is preferred, as it provides a better trade-off between goodness of fit and model complexity.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by first generating the synthetic count data $k_i = \\text{round}(n_i p_{\\mathrm{right}}(s_i))$ using the true generative parameters for each test case. Then, for each dataset, we will minimize the NLL for both the incorrect-prior and incorrect-noise models using numerical optimization, subject to parameter constraints ($\\tau_p > 0$, $\\sigma > 0$, $0 \\le \\lambda < 1$). Finally, we will compute the BIC for each model, select the one with the lower BIC, and check if this matches the ground-truth generating mechanism.",
