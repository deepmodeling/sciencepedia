A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of three quantities related to a single neural avalanche: its size, duration, and average rate. We are given the necessary parameters to compute these values based on their definitions.\n\nLet $N_{bins}$ be the number of consecutive active time bins in the avalanche, and let $N_{events\\_per\\_bin}$ be the number of active neuron events in each bin. Let $\\Delta t$ be the width of a single time bin.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   Number of active bins, $N_{bins} = 8$.\n-   Number of events per bin, $N_{events\\_per\\_bin} = 50$.\n-   Time bin width, $\\Delta t = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the **avalanche size**, denoted by $S$.

So, $S = 400$.\n\nSecond, we compute the **avalanche duration**, denoted by $D$. The duration is defined as the total time spanned by the avalanche's consecutive active bins. This is the product of the number of active bins and the width of each time bin.\n$$D = N_{bins} \\times \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D = 8 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 16\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe problem asks for the duration in milliseconds, so $D = 16\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThird, we compute the **average avalanche rate**, denoted by $R$.

The process starts with a single individual, has a mean offspring of $\\mathbb{E}[K]=m=1$ (criticality), and a finite, non-zero offspring variance $\\mathrm{Var}(K)=\\sigma^2$.\n\nFirst, we establish the functional relationship between the probability generating function (PGF) of the avalanche size, $T(z) = \\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(S=s) z^{s}$, and the PGF of the offspring distribution, $f(u) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(K=k) u^{k}$. The total avalanche size $S$ is the sum of the initial ancestor (size $1$) and the sizes of the sub-avalanches initiated by its $K$ offspring. Let the number of offspring of the initial ancestor be $K$. Each of these $K$ offspring starts a new, independent branching process, and the size of each sub-avalanche, denoted $S_i$ for $i=1, \\ldots, K$, has the same distribution as $S$. Thus, the total size is $S=1+\\sum_{i=1}^{K} S_i$.\n\nWe can write the PGF for $S$ using the law of total expectation:\n$$T(z) = \\mathbb{E}[z^S] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[z^{1+\\sum_{i=1}^{K} S_i}\\right] = z \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[z^{\\sum_{i=1}^{K} S_i} \\Big| K\\right]\\right]$$\nSince the $S_i$ are independent and identically distributed, given $K=k$, the PGF of their sum is the product of their individual PGFs: $\\mathbb{E}\\left[z^{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} S_i}\\right] = \\left(\\mathbb{E}[z^S]\\right)^k = (T(z))^k$.\nTaking the expectation over $K$, we get $\\mathbb{E}[(T(z))^K] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(K=k) (T(z))^k$, which is by definition the PGF of $K$ evaluated at $u=T(z)$. Therefore, we have:\n$$T(z) = z \\cdot f(T(z))$$\nThis is the fundamental functional equation for the PGF of the total progeny.\n\nNext, we analyze this equation in the neighborhood of $z=1$. For a critical process, the probability of eventual extinction is $1$, meaning $\\mathbb{P}(S  \\infty)=1$. Thus, as $z \\to 1^{-}$, $T(z) = \\sum \\mathbb{P}(S=s)z^s \\to \\sum \\mathbb{P}(S=s) = 1$. Let $u=T(z)$. We perform a Taylor expansion of $f(u)$ around $u=1$. The derivatives of $f(u)$ at $u=1$ relate to the moments of $K$:\n$f(1) = \\sum \\mathbb{P}(K=k) = 1$.\n$f'(1) = \\sum k \\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\mathbb{E}[K] = m = 1$ (by the criticality condition).\n$f''(1) = \\sum k(k-1) \\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\mathbb{E}[K(K-1)] = \\mathbb{E}[K^2] - \\mathbb{E}[K]$.\nWe know $\\mathrm{Var}(K) = \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[K^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[K])^2$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[K]=1$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[K^2] = \\sigma^2 + 1$.\nSo, $f''(1) = (\\sigma^2+1) - 1 = \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe Taylor series for $f(u)$ around $u=1$ is:\n$$f(u) = f(1) + f'(1)(u-1) + \\frac{f''(1)}{2!}(u-1)^2 + O((u-1)^3)$$\n$$f(u) = 1 + 1 \\cdot (u-1) + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}(u-1)^2 + O((u-1)^3) = u + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}(u-1)^2 + O((u-1)^3)$$\nSubstituting this back into the functional equation $T(z) = z f(T(z))$, with $u=T(z)$:\n$$u = z \\left( u + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}(u-1)^2 + O((u-1)^3) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$u(1-z) = z \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}(u-1)^2 + z O((u-1)^3)$$\nAs $z \\to 1^-$, we have $u=T(z) \\to 1^-$. We can analyze the leading order behavior by setting $z \\approx 1$ and $u \\approx 1$ in the less sensitive parts of the equation:\n$$1 \\cdot (1-z) \\approx 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}(u-1)^2$$\n$$(u-1)^2 \\approx \\frac{2(1-z)}{\\sigma^2}$$\nSince $u=T(z)1$ for $z1$, we have $u-10$, so we must take the negative square root:\n$$u-1 \\approx -\\sqrt{\\frac{2(1-z)}{\\sigma^2}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{1-z}$$\nThus, the asymptotic behavior of $T(z)$ near its singularity at $z=1$ is:\n$$T(z) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{1-z} = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma}(1-z)^{1/2}$$\nThis square-root singularity governs the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients $\\mathbb{P}(S=s)$.\n\nTo find the asymptotic form of $\\mathbb{P}(S=s)$, we use a transfer theorem from analytic combinatorics. It is often more convenient to apply the theorem to a function with a singularity of the form $(1-z)^{-\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha  0$. We can achieve this by differentiating $T(z)$:\n$$T'(z) = \\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} s \\, \\mathbb{P}(S=s) z^{s-1}$$\nDifferentiating the asymptotic expression for $T(z)$:\n$$T'(z) \\approx \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma}(1-z)^{1/2}\\right) = - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(1-z)^{-1/2} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sigma}(1-z)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}(1-z)^{-1/2}$$\nThe standard transfer theorem states that if a generating function $A(z) = \\sum a_n z^n$ behaves as $A(z) \\sim K(1-z)^{-\\alpha}$ for $z \\to 1$ (with $\\alpha \\notin \\{0, -1, -2, \\ldots\\}$), then its coefficients have the asymptotic form $a_n \\sim K \\frac{n^{\\alpha-1}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}$.\n\nLet's apply this to $T'(z)$. Here we have $K = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\alpha = 1/2$. The coefficients of $T'(z)$ are given by $[z^s]T'(z) = (s+1)\\mathbb{P}(S=s+1)$.

A full derivation and evaluation of the options will now be performed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\n1.  **Probability of a Silent Bin**\n    Under the assumption of a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\Lambda$, the number of spikes $k$ occurring in a time interval of duration $\\Delta t$ follows a Poisson distribution:\n    $$P(k) = \\frac{(\\Lambda \\Delta t)^k e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}}{k!}$$\n    A bin is defined as \"silent\" if it contains $k=0$ spikes. The probability of a silent bin, which we denote as $p_0$, is therefore:\n    $$p_0 = P(k=0) = \\frac{(\\Lambda \\Delta t)^0 e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}}{0!} = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$$\n    Since the average inter-spike interval is given as $\\langle \\tau \\rangle = 1/\\Lambda$, we can also write this as:\n    $$p_0 = e^{-\\Delta t / \\langle \\tau \\rangle}$$\n    The probability of a bin being \"active\" (containing one or more spikes) is $p_A = 1 - p_0 = 1 - e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$.\n\n2.  **Avalanche Duration Distribution and Mean**\n    An avalanche is a sequence of consecutive active bins bounded by silent bins. The Poisson process is memoryless, which implies that the state of each time bin (active or silent) is an independent Bernoulli trial.\n    The duration $D$ of an avalanche is the number of consecutive active bins until a silent bin occurs. Given that an avalanche is initiated (i.e., we are in an active bin that was preceded by a silent one), its duration is determined by the number of subsequent active bins before the first silent one.\n    This is a classic scenario described by a geometric distribution. An avalanche has duration $D=d$ (where $d$ is an integer $d \\ge 1$) if there is a sequence of $d-1$ continuations (active bin) followed by one termination (silent bin). The probability of this is:\n    $$P(D=d) = (p_A)^{d-1} p_0 = (1 - p_0)^{d-1} p_0$$\n    The support for this distribution is $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The mean (expected value) of this geometric distribution is:\n    $$\\langle D \\rangle = \\frac{1}{p_0} = \\frac{1}{e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}} = e^{\\Lambda \\Delta t} = e^{\\Delta t / \\langle \\tau \\rangle}$$\n\n3.  **Analysis of Regimes**\n    - **Regime 1: $\\Delta t \\ll \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ (Small bin width)**\n        - Here, $\\Lambda \\Delta t \\ll 1$.\n        - The probability of a silent bin is $p_0 = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t} \\approx 1 - \\Lambda \\Delta t$. This is very close to $1$.\n        - The mean duration is $\\langle D \\rangle = e^{\\Lambda \\Delta t} \\approx 1 + \\Lambda \\Delta t$. This is very close to $1$ bin.\n        - **Interpretation**: Since most bins are empty, any genuine sequence of correlated spikes is likely to be broken up by intervening silent bins. This leads to the **fragmentation** of activity into many short avalanches, primarily of duration $D=1$. The analysis thus **underestimates** event sizes and durations.\n\n    - **Regime 2: $\\Delta t \\approx \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ (Intermediate bin width)**\n        - Here, $\\Lambda \\Delta t \\approx 1$.\n        - The probability of a silent bin is $p_0 = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$.\n        - The mean duration is $\\langle D \\rangle = e^{1} \\approx 2.718$ bins.\n        - This regime is often considered a reference point, aiming to balance the opposing biases of the other two regimes.\n\n    - **Regime 3: $\\Delta t \\gg \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ (Large bin width)**\n        - Here, $\\Lambda \\Delta t \\gg 1$.\n        - The probability of a silent bin is $p_0 = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$, which is very close to $0$.\n        - The mean duration is $\\langle D \\rangle = e^{\\Lambda \\Delta t}$, which becomes very large.\n        - **Interpretation**: Since almost every bin contains at least one spike, finding a silent bin to terminate an avalanche becomes extremely rare. This leads to the **merging** of many causally independent spikes into single, artifactually long avalanches. The analysis thus **inflates** or **overestimates** sizes and durations. The resulting geometric distribution has a very small $p_0$, leading to a very heavy tail, which can be described as a \"flattened\" distribution.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

This statement is correct.\n    - \"At $\\Delta t \\approx \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, the expected avalanche duration... is approximately $(1 - e^{-1})/e^{-1} \\approx 1.7$\": At $\\Delta t = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, we have $\\Lambda \\Delta t = 1$, so $p_0=e^{-1}$. Our derived mean duration is $\\langle D \\rangle = 1/p_0 = e \\approx 2.718$. The option calculates $(1-p_0)/p_0 = 1/p_0 - 1 = \\langle D \\rangle - 1 \\approx 1.718$. This value represents the expected number of *additional* active bins after the first one, i.e., $\\langle D-1 \\rangle$. Given that the duration $D$ is the total number of active bins (a value $\\ge 1$), this quantitative statement is off by exactly $1$.\n- **Verdict**: Despite the quantitative error in the final part, all qualitative descriptions of the behavior across the three regimes are perfectly accurate. Compared to the other options, this one provides the most comprehensive and fundamentally correct picture of the system's behavior. The error is a common one related to the definition of the geometric distribution mean. Therefore, this option is the best description. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The probability of an empty bin is independent of $\\Delta t$ under a homogeneous Poisson model, so changing $\\Delta t$ does not affect avalanche statistics, only the temporal labeling of events.**\n\n- **Analysis**: Our derivation $p_0 = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$ shows a clear dependence on $\\Delta t$. Therefore, the premise of this option is fundamentally false. As a consequence, avalanche statistics are strongly dependent on $\\Delta t$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Setting $\\Delta t = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ maximizes the probability of empty bins, making most avalanches single-bin with probability approximately $0.9$.**\n\n- **Analysis**: The probability of empty bins, $p_0 = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$, is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\Delta t$. It is maximized (approaching $1$) as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, not at $\\Delta t = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$. Furthermore, the probability of a single-bin avalanche ($D=1$) is $P(D=1)=p_0$. At $\\Delta t = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, $p_0 = e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$, which is not approximately $0.9$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For homogeneous Poisson spikes, the probability of empty bins increases monotonically with $\\Delta t$, so larger $\\Delta t$ fragments avalanches and reduces their sizes and durations.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement claims the exact opposite of the derived behavior. The probability of empty bins $p_0 = e^{-\\Lambda \\Delta t}$ *decreases* with $\\Delta t$. Consequently, larger $\\Delta t$ causes *merging*, not fragmentation, and *increases* sizes and durations.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. When $\\Delta t \\ll \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, the avalanche duration distribution is geometric with mean approximately $1 / (\\Lambda \\Delta t)$, so smaller bins overestimate durations; increasing $\\Delta t$ reduces the mean duration proportionally.**\n\n- **Analysis**: The mean duration is $\\langle D \\rangle = e^{\\Lambda \\Delta t}$. For small $\\Lambda \\Delta t$, this is $\\langle D \\rangle \\approx 1 + \\Lambda \\Delta t$. The option claims the mean is approximately $1 / (\\Lambda \\Delta t)$, which would be a very large number for a very small $\\Lambda \\Delta t$, contradicting the derived result that the mean duration approaches $1$. The claim that smaller bins *overestimate* durations is also the opposite of the truth (they cause fragmentation and underestimation). Finally, the mean duration *increases* with $\\Delta t$, it does not decrease.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
