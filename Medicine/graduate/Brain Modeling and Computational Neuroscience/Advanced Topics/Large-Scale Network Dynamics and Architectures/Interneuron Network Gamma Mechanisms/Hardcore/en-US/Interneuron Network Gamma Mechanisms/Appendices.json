For $\\tau  0$, this means anti-phase is stable for ranges like $\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\omega\\tau  \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, and so on.\n\nThe stability of the in-phase and anti-phase solutions switches at the points where $F'(\\phi^*)=0$. This occurs when $\\cos(\\omega\\tau) = 0$. These are the bifurcation points that define the boundaries between stability regimes. The critical delay threshold $\\tau_c$ is the smallest positive value of $\\tau$ for which such a transition occurs.\nThe condition $\\cos(\\omega\\tau) = 0$ is first met for positive $\\tau$ when:\n$$ \\omega\\tau = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nFor $0 \\le \\tau  \\tau_c$, we have $0 \\le \\omega\\tau  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos(\\omega\\tau)0$, and the in-phase solution is stable.\nFor $\\tau  \\tau_c$ (in the range $\\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}  \\tau  \\frac{3\\pi}{2\\omega}$), we have $\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\omega\\tau  \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos(\\omega\\tau)0$, and the anti-phase solution is stable.\nThus, $\\tau_c$ is the critical delay that separates the stability of the in-phase solution from the anti-phase solution.\n\nSolving for $\\tau_c$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega} $$\nThe units of $\\omega$ are radians/second, and $\\pi$ is in radians, so the unit of $\\tau_c$ is seconds, as required.",
