The presynaptic spike trains from each source are modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes.\n\nFor a single source firing as a Poisson process with mean rate $\\nu$, the expected number of spikes in a small time interval $dt$ is $\\nu dt$. If each spike causes a postsynaptic potential change of amplitude $A$, the expected change in membrane potential from this single source over the interval $dt$ is $A(\\nu dt)$. The mean input per unit time from this source is therefore $A\\nu$.\n\nDue to the assumption of independent spike trains, the total mean input per unit time, which we denote as $\\mu_{net}$, is the linear superposition of the mean inputs from all presynaptic partners.\n\n1.  **Mean input from the excitatory population ($\\mu_E$)**: There are $K_E$ excitatory presynaptic partners, each firing at an average rate of $\\nu_E$. Each excitatory spike causes a potential jump of amplitude $J$. The total mean input per unit time from this population is the sum of contributions from all $K_E$ neurons:\n    $$ \\mu_E = K_E \\nu_E J $$\n\n2.  **Mean input from the inhibitory population ($\\mu_I$)**: There are $K_I$ inhibitory presynaptic partners, each firing at an average rate of $\\nu_I$. Each inhibitory spike causes a potential jump of amplitude $-gJ$. The total mean input per unit time from this population is:\n    $$ \\mu_I = K_I \\nu_I (-gJ) = -g K_I \\nu_I J $$\n\n3.  **Mean input from the external population ($\\mu_{ext}$)**: There are $K_{ext}$ external inputs, each firing at an average rate of $\\nu_{ext}$. Each external spike causes a potential jump of amplitude $J_{ext}$. The total mean input per unit time from this population is:\n    $$ \\mu_{ext} = K_{ext} \\nu_{ext} J_{ext} $$\n\nThe net mean input per unit time, $\\mu_{net}$, is the sum of these three components:\n$$ \\mu_{net} = \\mu_E + \\mu_I + \\mu_{ext} = K_E \\nu_E J - g K_I \\nu_I J + K_{ext} \\nu_{ext} J_{ext} $$\nThis expression represents the net mean input per unit time to the neuron.\n\nThe mean balance condition requires that this net mean input is zero. We denote the specific value of $g$ that satisfies this condition as $g^{\\ast}$.\n$$ \\mu_{net} = K_E \\nu_E J - g^{\\ast} K_I \\nu_I J + K_{ext} \\nu_{ext} J_{ext} = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this equation for $g^{\\ast}$:\n$$ g^{\\ast} K_I \\nu_I J = K_E \\nu_E J + K_{ext} \\nu_{ext} J_{ext} $$\n$$ g^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_E \\nu_E J + K_{ext} \\nu_{ext} J_{ext}}{K_I \\nu_I J} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- $J = 0.1$\n- $J_{ext} = 0.08$\n- $K_E = 800$\n- $K_I = 200$\n- $K_{ext} = 800$\n- $\\nu_E = 4$\n- $\\nu_I = 6$\n- $\\nu_{ext} = 4$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $g^{\\ast}$:\n$$ g^{\\ast} = \\frac{(800)(4)(0.1) + (800)(4)(0.08)}{(200)(6)(0.1)} $$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (3200)(0.1) + (3200)(0.08) = 320 + 256 = 576 $$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (1200)(0.1) = 120 $$\n\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$ g^{\\ast} = \\frac{576}{120} = 4.8 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The exact value $4.8$ is written as $4.800$ to meet this requirement.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a valid and well-posed task from the field of computational neuroscience. It requires the numerical computation of the stationary state (the Asynchronous Irregular fixed-point) of a Brunel network model. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and provides all necessary parameters and methodological constraints to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a pair of firing rates, $(r_E, r_I)$, for the excitatory and inhibitory populations, respectively, that are self-consistent. This means that if the network populations fire at these rates, the resulting synaptic input to any given neuron must, in turn, produce an output firing rate equal to the one assumed. This self-consistency condition defines a fixed-point problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main stages:\n1.  **Modeling Synaptic Input**: The total synaptic input to a neuron is approximated as a Gaussian white noise process. This is the \"diffusion approximation,\" justified by the Central Limit Theorem for a neuron receiving a large number of independent spike trains. The input is fully characterized by its mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$).\n2.  **Neuron Transfer Function**: The response of a single Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron to this statistical input is captured by a transfer function, $\\Phi(\\mu, \\sigma)$, which gives the neuron's stationary output firing rate. This function is derived from the mean first-passage time of the neuron's membrane potential to cross the firing threshold.\n3.  **Fixed-Point Iteration**: The fixed-point rates $(r_E, r_I)$ are found by iteratively applying the transfer function. Starting with an initial guess, one computes the input statistics $(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ generated by the current rates, then uses the transfer function to find the updated rates, and repeats this process until the rates converge.\n\nLet us formalize the steps.\n\n**1. Input Statistics $(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$**\n\nA neuron in either population (E or I) receives inputs from $K_E = p_E N_E$ excitatory neurons firing at rate $r_E$, $K_I = p_I N_I$ inhibitory neurons firing at rate $r_I$, and $K_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ external neurons firing at rate $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\nThe synaptic efficacies are $J$ (excitatory), $-gJ$ (inhibitory), and $J$ (external). The dynamics are described with instantaneous synapses.\nUnder the diffusion approximation, the mean input potential $\\mu_V$ and its variance $\\sigma_V^2$ are:\n$$\n\\mu_V(r_E, r_I) = \\tau_m \\left( (p_E N_E) J r_E - (p_I N_I) g J r_I + K_{\\mathrm{ext}} J \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_V^2(r_E, r_I) = \\tau_m \\left( (p_E N_E) J^2 r_E + (p_I N_I) (-gJ)^2 r_I + K_{\\mathrm{ext}} J^2 \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\right)\n$$\nSince the problem specifies that the connection probabilities ($p_E, p_I$) depend only on the source population and not the target, and all other parameters ($J, g, K_{\\mathrm{ext}}, \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}}$) are also global, the input statistics are identical for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Let's denote them $\\mu(r_E, r_I)$ and $\\sigma^2(r_E, r_I)$.\n$$\n\\mu(r_E, r_I) = \\tau_m J (p_E N_E r_E - g p_I N_I r_I + K_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^2(r_E, r_I) = \\tau_m J^2 (p_E N_E r_E + g^2 p_I N_I r_I + K_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}})\n$$\n\n**2. LIF Transfer Function $\\Phi(\\mu, \\sigma)$**\n\nThe stationary firing rate $\\nu$ for an LIF neuron is the reciprocal of the sum of the mean first-passage time and the absolute refractory period $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The mean first-passage time $\\langle T \\rangle$ is given by the Siegert formula:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\tau_m \\sqrt{\\pi} \\int_{\\frac{V_r - \\mu}{\\sigma}}^{\\frac{\\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma}} e^{x^2} (1 + \\mathrm{erf}(x)) dx\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the threshold, $V_r$ is the reset potential, and $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the error function. The firing rate is then:\n$$\n\\nu = \\Phi(\\mu, \\sigma) = \\left( \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\langle T \\rangle \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis integral must be computed numerically. Care must be taken as the term $e^{x^2}$ can lead to overflow if the upper integration limit, $(\\theta - \\mu)/\\sigma$, is large and positive. This corresponds to the mean input $\\mu$ being far below the threshold $\\theta$, in which case the firing rate is practically zero. A check is implemented to handle this case by returning a rate of $0$. A special case for zero noise ($\\sigma \\to 0$) is also handled.\n\n**3. Fixed-Point Iteration**\n\nWe seek the rates $(r_E, r_I)$ that satisfy the self-consistency equations:\n$$\nr_E = \\Phi(\\mu(r_E, r_I), \\sigma(r_E, r_I))\n$$\n$$\nr_I = \\Phi(\\mu(r_E, r_I), \\sigma(r_E, r_I))\n$$\nAs established, the input statistics and thus the transfer function's output are identical for both populations. If we start the iteration with $r_E^{(0)} = r_I^{(0)}$ (as specified by the problem, with $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}}$), all subsequent iterates will also have $r_E^{(k)} = r_I^{(k)}$. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding a single fixed-point rate $r = r_E = r_I$.\n\nThe iteration scheme is:\n1.  Initialize $r^{(0)} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n2.  For $k=0, 1, 2, ...$:\n    a. Compute $\\mu_k = \\mu(r^{(k)}, r^{(k)})$ and $\\sigma_k = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2(r^{(k)}, r^{(k)})}$.\n    b. Compute the candidate new rate $r'_{new} = \\Phi(\\mu_k, \\sigma_k)$.\n    c. Update the rate using relaxation to improve stability: $r^{(k+1)} = (1-\\alpha) r^{(k)} + \\alpha r'_{new}$, where $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is the relaxation coefficient (chosen as $0.5$).\n3.  The iteration stops when $|r^{(k+1)} - r^{(k)}|  10^{-9}$ or after $200$ iterations.\n\nThe final converged rate $r$ gives the solution $[r_E, r_I] = [r, r]$. This procedure is applied for each parameter set provided in the test suite.",

For a non-zero complex number $z = |z|e^{i\\arg(z)}$, its logarithm is a multi-valued function given by $\\ln(z) = \\ln|z| + i(\\arg(z) + 2\\pi k)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Applying this to our equation gives:\n$$\n\\lambda D = \\ln(g\\,\\mu_j) = \\ln|g\\,\\mu_j| + i(\\arg(g\\,\\mu_j) + 2\\pi k)\n$$\nThis yields an infinite set of solutions for $\\lambda$, indexed by $j$ and $k$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{j,k} = \\frac{\\ln|g\\,\\mu_j|}{D} + i \\frac{\\arg(g\\,\\mu_j) + 2\\pi k}{D}\n$$\nThe real part $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)$ and imaginary part $\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda)$ of each root are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_{j,k}) = \\frac{\\ln|g\\,\\mu_j|}{D}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda_{j,k}) = \\frac{\\arg(g\\,\\mu_j) + 2\\pi k}{D}\n$$\nA crucial observation is that for a given eigenvalue $\\mu_j$ of $W$, the real part of every corresponding root $\\lambda_{j,k}$ is constant, independent of the branch index $k$. Stability is determined by the sign of this real part. The system is stable if and only if $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_{j,k})  0$ for all $j$ and $k$. This is equivalent to requiring $\\ln|g\\,\\mu_j|/D  0$ for all $j$, which simplifies to $|g\\,\\mu_j|  1$ for all eigenvalues $\\mu_j$ of $W$.\n\nThe problem requires us to find all roots within a specified frequency window $|\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda)| \\leq \\Omega_{\\max}$. For each eigenvalue $\\mu_j$, we must find all integers $k$ that satisfy this condition:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\arg(g\\,\\mu_j) + 2\\pi k}{D} \\right| \\leq \\Omega_{\\max}\n$$\nThis inequality can be solved for $k$:\n$$\n-D\\Omega_{\\max} \\leq \\arg(g\\,\\mu_j) + 2\\pi k \\leq D\\Omega_{\\max}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{-D\\Omega_{\\max} - \\arg(g\\,\\mu_j)}{2\\pi} \\leq k \\leq \\frac{D\\Omega_{\\max} - \\arg(g\\,\\mu_j)}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe range of valid integers for $k$ is found by taking the ceiling of the lower bound and the floor of the upper bound.\n\nThe computational algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the parameters $W$, $g$, $D$, and $\\Omega_{\\max}$.\n2.  Compute the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\mu_j\\}$ of the matrix $W$.\n3.  Initialize an empty list to store the computed characteristic roots $\\lambda$.\n4.  For each eigenvalue $\\mu_j$:\n    a. If $|\\mu_j|$ is close to $0$, this branch contributes no roots, so we skip it.\n    b. Calculate the complex value $c_j = g\\,\\mu_j$.\n    c. Calculate the real part for this family of roots: $\\alpha_j = \\ln|c_j|/D$.\n    d. Determine the integer range $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$ for the index $k$ using the bounds derived from $\\Omega_{\\max}$.\n    e. For each integer $k$ from $k_{\\min}$ to $k_{\\max}$, compute the imaginary part $\\omega_{j,k} = (\\arg(c_j) + 2\\pi k)/D$.\n    f. Construct the root $\\lambda_{j,k} = \\alpha_j + i \\omega_{j,k}$ and add it to the list of roots.\n5.  After iterating through all $\\mu_j$, find the maximum real part among all computed roots in the list.\n6.  If the list of roots is empty, the stability condition is vacuously satisfied, and the system is deemed stable. This can happen if all $\\mu_j=0$.\n7.  If the maximum real part is strictly less than $0$, the system is stable. Otherwise, it is unstable. The result is recorded as a boolean value.\n\nThis procedure correctly identifies all characteristic roots within the specified frequency window and determines the system's stability based on the specified criterion.",
