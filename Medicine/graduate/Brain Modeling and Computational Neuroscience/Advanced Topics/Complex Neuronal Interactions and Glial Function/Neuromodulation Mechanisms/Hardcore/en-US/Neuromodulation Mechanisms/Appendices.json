            "introduction": "Neuromodulators often operate via volume transmission, diffusing through the extracellular space to influence targets far from their release site. This process can be modeled using a diffusion-reaction equation, which describes the balance between the spatial spread of molecules and their removal by uptake mechanisms. This exercise  provides a hands-on derivation of the steady-state concentration profile, building a foundational understanding of how the spatial range of a neuromodulator is shaped by physical parameters like its release rate $Q$, diffusion coefficient $D$, and uptake rate $k$.",

            "problem": "In volume transmission of neuromodulators, consider a single varicosity that continuously releases a neuromodulator into an infinite, homogeneous, isotropic extracellular space. The release can be modeled as a point source at the origin with constant rate $Q$ (molecules per unit time). The extracellular medium has effective diffusion coefficient $D$ (length squared per unit time), and neuromodulator is removed by first-order uptake with rate constant $k$ (per unit time).

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and well-posedness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Source**: A continuous point source at the origin, with constant release rate $Q$ (molecules per unit time).\n- **Medium**: Infinite, homogeneous, and isotropic extracellular space.\n- **Transport**: Diffusion with an effective diffusion coefficient $D$ (length squared per unit time). Bulk flow is ignored.\n- **Uptake**: First-order removal process with a rate constant $k$ (per unit time).\n- **State**: The system is assumed to have reached a stationary (steady-state) condition.\n- **Concentration**: The concentration of the neuromodulator is denoted by $c(r)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the source.\n- **Downstream Receptor**: A receptor with an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{D}$ (molecules per unit volume).\n- **Threshold Radius**: $r_{*}$ is defined as the smallest $r>0$ such that $c(r_{*})=K_{D}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a canonical model in computational neuroscience for neuromodulator diffusion. The governing equation is a diffusion-reaction equation (specifically, a steady-state screened Poisson equation), which is a fundamental and well-established model for such phenomena. The concepts of diffusion ($D$), first-order uptake ($k$), and a point source ($Q$) are standard in this field. This model is a valid and widely used simplification of a complex biological process. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is to solve a second-order ordinary differential equation with specified boundary conditions. The conditions of zero concentration at infinity and a finite flux from the source at the origin are physically appropriate and mathematically sufficient to yield a unique, stable solution for the concentration profile $c(r)$. The subsequent task of finding $r_{*}$ involves solving an equation where the function $c(r)$ is monotonic, ensuring a unique solution for $r_{*}$. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and physical terms ($Q, D, k, c(r), K_D$). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing equation for the steady-state concentration $c$ of a substance undergoing diffusion and first-order decay is the Helmholtz equation, derived from the principle of mass conservation. At any point in space, the divergence of the diffusive flux must be balanced by the local rate of removal and any sources.\nThe diffusive flux density $\\vec{J}$ is given by Fick's first law:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = -D \\nabla c\n$$\nThe rate of removal is $-k c$. In steady state, the conservation law is $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} - k c + S = 0$, where $S$ is the source term.\nFor a point source of strength $Q$ at the origin, the source term is represented by a Dirac delta function, $S(\\vec{r}) = Q \\delta(\\vec{r})$. The full equation is:\n$$\n-D \\nabla^2 c - k c + Q \\delta(\\vec{r}) = 0\n$$\nWe can solve this by considering the homogeneous equation for $r > 0$, where $\\delta(\\vec{r}) = 0$, and incorporate the source via a boundary condition at the origin. Due to the spherical symmetry of the problem (a point source in an isotropic medium), the concentration $c$ will only depend on the radial distance $r$, i.e., $c = c(r)$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ in spherical coordinates for a function of $r$ only is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nThe homogeneous differential equation for $r > 0$ is:\n$$\nD \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) - k c(r) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we introduce an auxiliary function $u(r) = r c(r)$. Then $c(r) = u(r)/r$. We can compute the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{u}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = r \\frac{du}{dr} - u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{du}{dr} + r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} \\right) - \\frac{du}{dr} = r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the differential equation gives:\n$$\nD \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left( r \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} \\right) - k \\frac{u}{r} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D}{r} \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \\frac{k}{r} u = 0\n$$\nFor $r > 0$, this simplifies to a standard second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \\frac{k}{D} u = 0\n$$\nLet's define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda^{-1}$ where $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. The equation becomes $u'' - \\lambda^2 u = 0$. The general solution for $u(r)$ is:\n$$\nu(r) = A_1 \\exp(-\\lambda r) + A_2 \\exp(\\lambda r)\n$$\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are integration constants. Substituting back $c(r) = u(r)/r$, we get:\n$$\nc(r) = \\frac{A_1}{r} \\exp(-\\lambda r) + \\frac{A_2}{r} \\exp(\\lambda r)\n$$\nWe now apply the boundary conditions.\n1.  For an infinite medium with a finite source, the concentration must vanish at infinity: $c(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. The term $\\frac{A_2}{r} \\exp(\\lambda r)$ diverges as $r \\to \\infty$ (since $\\lambda > 0$). To satisfy the boundary condition, we must set $A_2 = 0$. The solution is thus of the form:\n    $$\n    c(r) = \\frac{A_1}{r} \\exp(-\\lambda r)\n    $$\n2.  The source at the origin has a constant rate $Q$. By conservation of mass, the total flux of neuromodulator out of any sphere enclosing the origin must equal $Q$ in the limit as the sphere's radius goes to zero. The total flux $\\Phi$ through a spherical surface of radius $r$ is the area of the sphere ($4\\pi r^2$) times the radial flux density $J_r = -D \\frac{dc}{dr}$.\n    $$\n    \\Phi(r) = -4\\pi r^2 D \\frac{dc}{dr}\n    $$\n    The boundary condition at the source is $\\lim_{r \\to 0} \\Phi(r) = Q$. Let's compute $\\frac{dc}{dr}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dc}{dr} = A_1 \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda r)}{r} \\right) = A_1 \\left( \\frac{- \\lambda r \\exp(-\\lambda r) - \\exp(-\\lambda r)}{r^2} \\right) = -A_1 \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda r)}{r^2} (1 + \\lambda r)\n    $$\n    Now we compute the flux:\n    $$\n    \\Phi(r) = -4\\pi r^2 D \\left( -A_1 \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda r)}{r^2} (1 + \\lambda r) \\right) = 4\\pi D A_1 \\exp(-\\lambda r) (1 + \\lambda r)\n    $$\n    Taking the limit as $r \\to 0$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\Phi(r) = 4\\pi D A_1 \\exp(0) (1 + 0) = 4\\pi D A_1\n    $$\n    Equating this to the source rate $Q$, we find the constant $A_1$:\n    $$\n    4\\pi D A_1 = Q \\implies A_1 = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D}\n    $$\nThe steady-state concentration profile is therefore:\n$$\nc(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D r} \\exp\\left(-r\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we need to find the threshold radius $r_{*}$, defined as the smallest $r>0$ where $c(r_{*}) = K_{D}$. Since $c(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $r > 0$, there is a unique solution for $r_{*}$. We set up the equation:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D r_{*}} \\exp\\left(-r_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $r_{*}$, we must solve this transcendental equation. Let's rearrange it.\n$$\nr_{*} \\exp\\left(r_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D K_D}\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $x \\exp(x) = y$. We can make this explicit by multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{k/D}$:\n$$\n\\left(r_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) \\exp\\left(r_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D K_D} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\n$$\nLet the variable be $X = r_{*}\\sqrt{k/D}$ and the constant term be $Y = \\frac{Q \\sqrt{k}}{4\\pi K_D D^{3/2}}$. The equation is $X \\exp(X) = Y$.\nThe solution to this form of equation is given by the principal branch of the Lambert W function, $W_0(z)$, or simply $W(z)$, which is defined by the relation $W(z) \\exp(W(z)) = z$.\nThus, $X = W(Y)$.\n$$\nr_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} = W\\left( \\frac{Q \\sqrt{k}}{4\\pi K_D D^{3/2}} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $r_{*}$ gives:\n$$\nr_{*} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} W\\left( \\frac{Q \\sqrt{k}}{4\\pi K_D D^{3/2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the threshold radius $r_{*}$. Since all physical parameters $Q, D, k, K_D$ are positive, the argument of the Lambert W function is positive. For a positive argument $z > 0$, $W(z)$ is a single-valued, real, and positive function, guaranteeing a unique and physically meaningful solution for $r_{*}$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond the synapse, neuromodulators profoundly alter the intrinsic computational properties of neurons by acting on voltage-gated ion channels. A common mechanism involves intracellular signaling cascades, such as those elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which can shift the activation properties of channels like the hyperpolarization-activated current, $I_h$. This exercise  guides you through linearizing channel and membrane kinetics to quantify how such a modulatory shift impacts a neuron's input resistance and its subthreshold resonance, which are key determinants of its integrative function within a network.",

            "problem": "A dendritic compartment is modeled as a single isopotential element obtained by discretizing the passive cable equation, with membrane capacitance $C$, passive leak conductance $G_{L}$, and a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current $I_{h}$. The HCN current obeys the conductance form $I_{h} = \\bar{g}_{h}\\, m(V,t)\\, (V - E_{h})$, where $\\bar{g}_{h}$ is the maximal HCN conductance, $E_{h}$ is the HCN reversal potential, and $m(V,t)$ is a gate that follows first-order kinetics $\\tau_{m}(V)\\, \\dot{m} = -m + m_{\\infty}(V)$. The steady-state activation $m_{\\infty}(V)$ is a Boltzmann function, $m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)}$, where $V_{1/2}$ is the half-activation voltage and $k$ is the slope factor.\n\nA neuromodulatory increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is known to shift the HCN activation curve toward depolarized voltages. In this compartment, cAMP binding shifts the half-activation voltage by a constant $\\Delta V$ so that $V_{1/2} \\mapsto V_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mod}} = V_{1/2} + \\Delta V$, without changing $k$, $\\bar{g}_{h}$, or $\\tau_{m}(V)$ at the resting potential. Assume small-signal perturbations around a resting potential $V_{0}$, and use linearized cable theory for a single isopotential compartment (i.e., linearize the membrane equations about $V_{0}$).\n\nStarting from the given definitions and first-order kinetics, derive how cAMP binding modifies $m_{\\infty}(V)$ and the local slope $\\frac{d m_{\\infty}}{dV}\\big|_{V_{0}}$, then derive the linearized frequency-dependent admittance contribution of $I_{h}$ and the total small-signal input admittance. From this, obtain an analytic expression for the angular frequency at which the magnitude of the input impedance attains its subthreshold resonance and for the direct-current (DC) input resistance. Finally, compute the changes in DC input resistance and in resonance frequency induced by the cAMP shift, using the parameters:\n- $\\bar{g}_{h} = 30 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$,\n- $G_{L} = 25 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$,\n- $C = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}$,\n- $\\tau_{m}(V_{0}) = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}$,\n- $E_{h} = -0.035\\ \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_{0} = -0.065\\ \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $k = 0.007\\ \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_{1/2} = -0.085\\ \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $\\Delta V = +0.008\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nExpress the change in DC input resistance in megaohms and the change in resonance frequency in hertz.

            "solution": "The problem requires a detailed derivation of the effects of neuromodulation on the electrical properties of a dendritic compartment, specifically its direct-current (DC) input resistance and resonance frequency. We will proceed by linearizing the membrane and channel equations, deriving the total admittance, and then calculating the desired quantities before and after the modulatory shift.\n\nThe membrane potential of the isopotential compartment is governed by the current balance equation:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + I_{L} + I_{h} = I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\nwhere $C$ is the membrane capacitance, $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the injected current, $I_{L} = G_{L}(V - E_{L})$ is the passive leak current, and $I_{h} = \\bar{g}_{h}\\, m(V,t)\\, (V - E_{h})$ is the hyperpolarization-activated (HCN) current. The gating variable $m$ follows first-order kinetics:\n$$\\tau_{m}(V)\\, \\frac{dm}{dt} = -m + m_{\\infty}(V)$$\n\nWe linearize the system around the steady-state resting potential $V_{0}$. Let $V(t) = V_{0} + v(t)$, $m(t) = m_{0} + \\delta m(t)$, and $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = I_{0} + i_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$, where $v(t)$, $\\delta m(t)$, and $i_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$ are small perturbations. At rest, $I_{\\mathrm{ext}} = I_{0} = I_L(V_0) + I_h(V_0)$ holds the potential at $V_0$. The linearized equation for the perturbations is:\n$$C \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\delta I_{L} + \\delta I_{h} = i_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$$\n\nThe leak current perturbation is $\\delta I_{L} = G_{L}v$. For the HCN current, we have:\n$$\\delta I_{h} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{V_{0}, m_{0}} v + \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial m}\\right)_{V_{0}, m_{0}} \\delta m$$\nThe partial derivatives evaluated at the resting state $(V_{0}, m_{0} = m_{\\infty}(V_{0}))$ are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial V} = \\bar{g}_{h} m \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{V_{0}, m_{0}} = \\bar{g}_{h} m_{0}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial m} = \\bar{g}_{h} (V - E_{h}) \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{h}}{\\partial m}\\right)_{V_{0}, m_{0}} = \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h})$$\nSo, the perturbation in HCN current is $\\delta I_{h} = \\bar{g}_{h} m_{0} v + \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) \\delta m$.\n\nNext, we linearize the gating variable kinetics around $(V_{0}, m_{0})$:\n$$\\tau_{m}(V_{0}) \\frac{d}{dt}(m_{0} + \\delta m) = - (m_{0} + \\delta m) + m_{\\infty}(V_{0} + v)$$\nUsing a Taylor expansion for $m_{\\infty}(V_{0} + v) \\approx m_{\\infty}(V_{0}) + \\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV}\\big|_{V_{0}} v$ and noting that $\\frac{dm_{0}}{dt} = 0$, we get:\n$$\\tau_{m0} \\frac{d(\\delta m)}{dt} = - \\delta m + m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) v$$\nwhere $\\tau_{m0} = \\tau_{m}(V_{0})$ and $m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) = \\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV}\\big|_{V_{0}}$.\n\nTo analyze the frequency-dependent response, we perform a Fourier transform (letting perturbations vary as $e^{i\\omega t}$, so $\\frac{d}{dt} \\to i\\omega$). The gating kinetics equation becomes:\n$$i\\omega \\tau_{m0} \\tilde{\\delta m} = - \\tilde{\\delta m} + m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\tilde{v}$$\nSolving for the gating variable perturbation $\\tilde{\\delta m}$ in the frequency domain:\n$$\\tilde{\\delta m} (1 + i\\omega \\tau_{m0}) = m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\tilde{v} \\implies \\tilde{\\delta m} = \\frac{m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})}{1 + i\\omega \\tau_{m0}} \\tilde{v}$$\n\nWe substitute this into the expression for the HCN current perturbation $\\tilde{\\delta I_{h}}$:\n$$\\tilde{\\delta I_{h}} = \\bar{g}_{h} m_{0} \\tilde{v} + \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) \\left( \\frac{m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})}{1 + i\\omega \\tau_{m0}} \\right) \\tilde{v}$$\nThe admittance of the HCN current, $Y_{h}(\\omega) = \\tilde{\\delta I_{h}}/\\tilde{v}$, is therefore:\n$$Y_{h}(\\omega) = \\bar{g}_{h} m_{\\infty}(V_{0}) + \\frac{\\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})}{1 + i\\omega \\tau_{m0}}$$\n\nThe total input admittance of the compartment, $Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega) = i_{\\mathrm{ext}}/\\tilde{v}$, is the sum of the admittances of all membrane components:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega) = Y_{L} + Y_{C} + Y_{h}(\\omega) = G_{L} + i\\omega C + \\bar{g}_{h} m_{\\infty}(V_{0}) + \\frac{\\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})}{1 + i\\omega \\tau_{m0}}$$\n\nThe DC input resistance is the inverse of the total admittance at zero frequency, $R_{\\mathrm{DC}} = Z(0) = 1/Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(0)$.\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(0) = G_{L} + \\bar{g}_{h} m_{\\infty}(V_{0}) + \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})$$\nSo, $R_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\left( G_{L} + \\bar{g}_{h} m_{\\infty}(V_{0}) + \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\right)^{-1}$.\n\nThe resonance frequency is defined as the frequency at which the imaginary part of the admittance is zero ($\\mathrm{Im}[Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega)] = 0$) for $\\omega > 0$. Let's separate the real and imaginary parts of $Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega)$:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega) = G_L + i\\omega C + \\bar{g}_{h} m_{0} + \\frac{\\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{m0})^2} (1 - i\\omega\\tau_{m0})$$\n$$\\mathrm{Im}[Y_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\omega)] = \\omega C - \\frac{\\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\omega\\tau_{m0}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{m0})^2}$$\nSetting this to zero for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} > 0$:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} C = \\frac{\\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}\\tau_{m0}}{1 + (\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}\\tau_{m0})^2}$$\n$$C(1 + (\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}\\tau_{m0})^2) = \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0}) \\tau_{m0}$$\nLet's define the dynamic conductance $g_{h}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} = \\bar{g}_{h} (V_{0} - E_{h}) m'_{\\infty}(V_{0})$.\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_{m0}^2 = \\frac{g_{h}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\tau_{m0}}{C} - 1$$\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{m0}} \\sqrt{\\frac{g_{h}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\tau_{m0}}{C} - 1}$$\nThe resonance frequency in Hertz is $f_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} / (2\\pi)$.\n\nNow we compute these values for the control and modulated conditions.\nThe steady-state activation and its derivative are:\n$$m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V -
