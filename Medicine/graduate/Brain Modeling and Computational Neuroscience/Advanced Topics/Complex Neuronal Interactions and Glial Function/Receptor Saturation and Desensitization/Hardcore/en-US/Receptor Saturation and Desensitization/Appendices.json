            "problem": "A postsynaptic receptor population in a neuron binds a neurotransmitter ligand at concentration $L$ and forms a receptor–ligand complex that gates an ion channel. Assume the binding follows the law of mass action at steady state with a dissociation constant $K_{d}$, and the total receptor concentration is conserved. The synaptic current $I(L)$ is proportional to the fraction of receptors in the ligand-bound (active) state, with a finite maximum current $I_{\\max}$ under full activation. Receptor desensitization reduces the available active receptor pool on slow timescales but is assumed to act only as a renormalization of $I_{\\max}$ (i.e., the functional dependence on $L$ remains governed by equilibrium binding).\n\nStarting from mass action binding and conservation of receptors, derive the static input–output function $I(L)$ as a function of $L$, $K_{d}$, and $I_{\\max}$, without assuming any particular parametric form in advance. Then, define the dynamic range of inputs as the ratio $L_{\\text{high}}/L_{\\text{low}}$, where $L_{\\text{low}}$ is the input that produces an output equal to the noise floor $I_{\\text{noise}}$, and $L_{\\text{high}}$ is the input that produces an output equal to $I_{\\max}-I_{\\text{noise}}$.

It describes a standard biophysical model (the Hill-Langmuir model) widely used in neuroscience and pharmacology. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and scientifically sound.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $R$ represent the free receptor, $L$ the ligand, and $RL$ the receptor-ligand complex. The binding reaction is:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nAccording to the law of mass action at steady state, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation. Let $[R]$ and $[RL]$ be the concentrations of the free and bound receptors, respectively. The ligand concentration is given as $L$.\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} [R] L = k_{\\text{off}} [RL] $$\nHere, $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ are the association and dissociation rate constants. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{[R]L}{[RL]} $$\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved:\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] $$\nThe fraction of receptors in the ligand-bound state, denoted by $\\theta$, is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $L$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the equation for $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{L} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{L} + [RL]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1} $$\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by $L$, we obtain the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation (for a Hill coefficient of $1$):\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\frac{L}{L + K_d} $$\nThe problem states that the synaptic current $I(L)$ is proportional to this fraction $\\theta(L)$. So, $I(L) = C \\cdot \\theta(L)$ for some constant of proportionality $C$.\n$$ I(L) = C \\frac{L}{L + K_d} $$\nThe maximum current $I_{\\max}$ occurs at saturating ligand concentrations, i.e., in the limit as $L \\to \\infty$.

The term $K_d$ cancels out.\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\text{high}}}{L_{\\text{low}}} = \\frac{K_d \\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\text{noise}}}{I_{\\text{noise}}}}{K_d \\frac{I_{\\text{noise}}}{I_{\\max} - I_{\\text{noise}}}} = \\left(\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\text{noise}}}{I_{\\text{noise}}}\\right)^2 $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values, $I_{\\max} = 4.0$ and $I_{\\text{noise}} = 0.05$.\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\text{high}}}{L_{\\text{low}}} = \\left(\\frac{4.0 - 0.05}{0.05}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3.95}{0.05}\\right)^2 $$\nWe calculate the value of the base:\n$$ \\frac{3.95}{0.05} = \\frac{395}{5} = 79 $$\nFinally, we square this result to find the dynamic range:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\text{high}}}{L_{\\text{low}}} = (79)^2 = 6241 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result, $6241$, already has four significant figures.",

The fraction of receptors that are not desensitized is then $1 - D(t)$. The rate of change of the desensitized fraction, $\\frac{dD}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of desensitization and the rate of resensitization.\n\nThe rate of resensitization is the flux from the desensitized state back to the non-desensitized state. According to the problem statement, this occurs with a rate constant $k_{\\text{res}}$. Thus, the rate of resensitization is proportional to the fraction of desensitized receptors:\n$$ \\text{Rate of resensitization} = k_{\\text{res}} D(t) $$\n\nThe rate of desensitization is the flux from the non-desensitized state into the desensitized state. The problem states this occurs from the pool of non-desensitized receptors (fraction $1 - D(t)$) at a rate proportional to the instantaneous bound fraction. The proportionality constant is $k_{\\text{des}}$. The instantaneous bound fraction is given by the approximation $\\frac{L(t)}{L(t) + K_d}$. Therefore, the rate of desensitization is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of desensitization} = k_{\\text{des}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{L(t)}{L(t) + K_d} \\right) \\cdot (1 - D(t)) $$\n\nCombining these two rates, we form the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $D(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L(t)}{L(t) + K_d} (1 - D(t)) - k_{\\text{res}} D(t) $$\n\n### Solution of the Differential Equation\nThe problem specifies a step ligand protocol where $L(t) = L_{0}$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Substituting this into the ODE gives:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} (1 - D) - k_{\\text{res}} D $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. Let's rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)$.\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} - k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} D - k_{\\text{res}} D $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} + \\left( k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} + k_{\\text{res}} \\right) D = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} $$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{dD}{dt} + aD = b$, where the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are constants:\n$$ a = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} + k_{\\text{res}} $$\n$$ b = k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} $$\nThe general solution to this type of ODE is $D(t) = \\frac{b}{a} + C \\exp(-at)$, where $C$ is an integration constant.

The steady-state fraction of desensitized receptors, $D_{ss} = \\frac{b}{a}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}}}{k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} + k_{\\text{res}}} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(L_{0} + K_{d})$:\n$$ \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0}}{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0} + k_{\\text{res}}(L_{0} + K_{d})} $$\nThe full solution for $D(t)$ is:\n$$ D(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0}}{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0} + k_{\\text{res}}(L_{0} + K_{d})} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left( k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} + k_{\\text{res}} \\right)t\\right) \\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the solution at an arbitrary time $T > 0$. We simply replace $t$ with $T$:\n$$ D(T) = \\frac{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0}}{k_{\\text{des}} L_{0} + k_{\\text{res}}(L_{0} + K_{d})} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left( k_{\\text{des}} \\frac{L_{0}}{L_{0} + K_{d}} + k_{\\text{res}} \\right)T\\right) \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the fraction of desensitized receptors at time $T$ following the application of a constant ligand concentration $L_0$ at time $t=0$, starting from a fully non-desensitized state.",
