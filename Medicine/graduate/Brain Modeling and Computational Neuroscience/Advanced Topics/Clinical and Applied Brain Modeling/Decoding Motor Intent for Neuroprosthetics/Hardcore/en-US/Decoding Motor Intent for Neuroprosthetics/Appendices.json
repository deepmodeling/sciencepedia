The count $K$ is modeled as a Poisson random variable with a mean $\\mu(\\theta)$ that depends on $\\theta$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Movement direction parameter: $\\theta$ (in radians)\n- Observation window duration: $T$ seconds\n- Spike count distribution: $K \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\mu(\\theta))$\n- Mean spike count: $\\mu(\\theta) = T \\lambda(\\theta)$\n- Firing-rate tuning curve: $\\lambda(\\theta) = \\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_{0})$\n- Constraints on parameters: $\\alpha > |\\beta| > 0$\n- Neuron's preferred direction: $\\theta_0$\n- Fixed, known parameters: $\\alpha, \\beta, T, \\theta_0$\n- Task: Derive a closed-form expression for the Fisher information $I(\\theta)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses a Poisson model for neural spike counts and a cosine tuning curve, which are standard, experimentally-validated models in computational neuroscience for describing the activity of neurons in motor cortex. The application of Fisher information to quantify the encoding capacity of a neuron is a cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience. The condition $\\alpha > |\\beta|$ ensures that the firing rate $\\lambda(\\theta)$ is always positive, which is physically necessary.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions and parameters to derive a unique mathematical expression for the Fisher information. The task is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical and scientific language, free of subjectivity or opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Fisher information $I(\\theta)$ for a parameter $\\theta$ given an observation $K$ from a distribution with probability mass function (PMF) $p(K|\\theta)$ is given by the expectation of the squared score function:\n$$\nI(\\theta) = E\\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\ln p(K|\\theta) \\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe expectation $E[\\cdot]$ is taken with respect to the distribution of $K$ itself, i.e., $p(K|\\theta)$.\n\nThe spike count $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu(\\theta)$, so its PMF is:\n$$\np(K|\\theta) = \\frac{\\mu(\\theta)^K e^{-\\mu(\\theta)}}{K!}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood function, $\\ln p(K|\\theta)$, is:\n$$\n\\ln p(K|\\theta) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\mu(\\theta)^K e^{-\\mu(\\theta)}}{K!} \\right) = K \\ln(\\mu(\\theta)) - \\mu(\\theta) - \\ln(K!)\n$$\nNext, we compute the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\\theta$. This is the score function. The term $\\ln(K!)$ does not depend on $\\theta$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\ln p(K|\\theta) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} [K \\ln(\\mu(\\theta)) - \\mu(\\theta)]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\ln p(K|\\theta) = K \\frac{1}{\\mu(\\theta)} \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = \\left( \\frac{K}{\\mu(\\theta)} - 1 \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nLet's denote the derivative of the mean spike count as $\\mu'(\\theta) = \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}$.

The term $(\\mu'(\\theta))^2$ is a function of $\\theta$ but not of the random variable $K$, so it can be treated as a constant with respect to the expectation.\n$$\nI(\\theta) = E\\left[ \\left( \\frac{K - \\mu(\\theta)}{\\mu(\\theta)} \\right)^2 (\\mu'(\\theta))^2 \\right] = \\frac{(\\mu'(\\theta))^2}{\\mu(\\theta)^2} E\\left[ (K - \\mu(\\theta))^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe term $E[(K - \\mu(\\theta))^2]$ is the definition of the variance of $K$. For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu(\\theta)$, the variance is equal to the mean: $\\text{Var}(K) = \\mu(\\theta)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $I(\\theta)$:\n$$\nI(\\theta) = \\frac{(\\mu'(\\theta))^2}{\\mu(\\theta)^2} \\mu(\\theta) = \\frac{(\\mu'(\\theta))^2}{\\mu(\\theta)}\n$$\nThis is a general result for the Fisher information of a parameter of a Poisson distribution.\n\nNow, we must substitute the specific forms for $\\mu(\\theta)$ and its derivative $\\mu'(\\theta)$.\nThe mean spike count is $\\mu(\\theta) = T \\lambda(\\theta) = T(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0))$.\nIts derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\mu'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} [T(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0))] = T\\beta(-\\sin(\\theta - \\theta_0)) = -T\\beta\\sin(\\theta - \\theta_0)\n$$\nNow we substitute $\\mu(\\theta)$ and $\\mu'(\\theta)$ into the expression for $I(\\theta)$:\n$$\nI(\\theta) = \\frac{(-T\\beta\\sin(\\theta - \\theta_0))^2}{T(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0))}\n$$\n$$\nI(\\theta) = \\frac{T^2 \\beta^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\theta_0)}{T(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0))}\n$$\nSimplifying by canceling a factor of $T$:\n$$\nI(\\theta) = \\frac{T \\beta^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\theta_0)}{\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0)}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the Fisher information contributed by the neuron about the direction parameter $\\theta$.

The second component is the product of the same Laplace distribution and a Gaussian centered at $+\\mu$. If the prior modes at $\\pm\\mu$ are well-separated (i.e., $\\sigma_p \\ll \\mu$), the posterior distribution $p(x|y)$ will be bimodal, with one mode near $-\\mu$ and another near $+\\mu$.\n\n**2. Analysis for $y = \\alpha\\mu$ with $\\alpha \\ll 1$**\nWe are given an observation $y = \\alpha\\mu$ that is small and positive.\n\n**Analysis of the MAP Estimator ($\\hat{x}_{\\text{MAP}}$)**\nThe MAP estimate is the mode of the posterior distribution, i.e., the value of $x$ that maximizes $p(x|y)$.\nThe two modes of the posterior are located near the prior modes $x=-\\mu$ and $x=+\\mu$. To determine the global maximum, we can compare the approximate height of the posterior at these two locations.\nLet's evaluate the (unnormalized) posterior density at $x=\\mu$ and $x=-\\mu$:\n- At $x = \\mu$: $p(\\mu|y) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-\\mu|}{b}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\mu+\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\mu-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}\\right) \\right]$\nSince $y = \\alpha\\mu$ and $0 < \\alpha < 1$, $|y-\\mu| = \\mu(1-\\alpha)$.\n$$ p(\\mu|y) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu(1-\\alpha)}{b}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\sigma_p^2}\\right) + 1 \\right] $$\n- At $x = -\\mu$: $p(-\\mu|y) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-(-\\mu)|}{b}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-\\mu+\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-\\mu-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}\\right) \\right]$\n$|y-(-\\mu)| = \\mu(1+\\alpha)$.\n$$ p(-\\mu|y) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu(1+\\alpha)}{b}\\right) \\left[ 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\sigma_p^2}\\right) \\right] $$\nComparing the two values, the term in the square brackets is identical. The ratio of the heights is determined by the exponential term from the likelihood:\n$$ \\frac{p(\\mu|y)}{p(-\\mu|y)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu(1-\\alpha)}{b}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu(1+\\alpha)}{b}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\mu(1-\\alpha) + \\mu(1+\\alpha)}{b}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha\\mu}{b}\\right) $$\nSince $\\alpha>0$, $\\mu>0$, and $b>0$, the argument of the exponential is positive, so the ratio is greater than $1$. This indicates that the posterior density is higher in the region of $x=+\\mu$ than in the region of $x=-\\mu$.\nTherefore, the global maximum of the posterior (the MAP estimate) will be the mode that is located near $+\\mu$. Thus, $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MAP}}$ will be a positive value close to $\\mu$.\n\n**Analysis of the MMSE Estimator ($\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}}$)**\nThe MMSE estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution, $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}} = \\mathbb{E}[x|y]$.\nFor a bimodal distribution, the mean is a weighted average of the values within each mode. Let the two modes be centered around $x_1 \\approx -\\mu$ and $x_2 \\approx \\mu$. The MMSE estimate will be an average of these two locations, weighted by the total probability mass in each part of the distribution.\n$$ \\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\, p(x|y) \\, dx $$\nConsider the case where $y=0$. The likelihood $p(y|x) = p(0|x) \\propto \\exp(-|x|/b)$ is symmetric around $x=0$. The prior $p(x)$ is also symmetric around $x=0$. The product of two symmetric functions (about the same point) is also symmetric. Thus, for $y=0$, the posterior $p(x|0)$ is symmetric around $x=0$. The mean of any symmetric distribution is its center of symmetry, so $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}}(y=0) = 0$.\nNow, for the given observation $y=\\alpha\\mu$ with $\\alpha \\ll 1$, the observation $y$ is very close to $0$. By continuity, the posterior $p(x|y)$ will be only slightly perturbed from a symmetric distribution. It will be slightly asymmetric, with more probability mass on the positive side ($x>0$) than on the negative side. Consequently, its mean, $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}}$, will be a small positive value, close to $0$. It is an average over the two modes (one near $-\\mu$, one near $+\\mu$), so it will fall somewhere in between them. Because the positive mode has slightly more weight, the mean will be positive. As $\\alpha \\to 0$, $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}} \\to 0$. Therefore, for small $\\alpha$, the estimate is strictly between $0$ and $\\mu$, and closer to $0$.\n\n**Conclusion on Divergence**\nThe MAP estimator makes a \"hard\" decision, selecting the most probable mode, so $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MAP}} \\approx \\mu$. The MMSE estimator makes a \"soft\" decision by averaging over all possibilities, resulting in an estimate $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}}$ that is close to $0$. Thus, for a small but non-zero observation $y$, the two estimators diverge significantly. $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MAP}}$ reflects the belief that the intent was likely $+\\mu$, while $\\hat{x}_{\\text{MMSE}}$ reflects the high uncertainty by producing an estimate near $0$, effectively averaging out the opposing possibilities.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. MAP selects the posterior mode while MMSE selects the posterior mean; under heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise and a bimodal prior, the posterior becomes bimodal and skewed toward the mode nearer $y$. For $y=\\alpha\\mu>0$, MAP favors the $+\\mu$ mode, whereas MMSE yields an estimate strictly between $0$ and $\\mu$ (closer to $0$ when $\\alpha$ is small), so they diverge.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the analysis above.\n- It correctly identifies MAP as the mode and MMSE as the mean.\n- It correctly describes the posterior as bimodal and asymmetric (skewed) due to the observation $y$.\n- It correctly concludes that for $y>0$, MAP selects the mode near $+\\mu$.\n- It correctly characterizes the MMSE estimate as an average that falls between $0$ and $\\mu$, and is close to $0$ for small $\\alpha$.\n- The conclusion that they diverge is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. MAP equals the posterior mean whenever the prior is symmetric; therefore, even with non-Gaussian noise (such as Laplace), they coincide for all $y$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The MAP and MMSE estimates coincide for unimodal, symmetric *posterior* distributions. A symmetric prior does not guarantee a symmetric posterior unless the likelihood is also centered at the prior's point of symmetry. Here, the likelihood is centered at $y$. If $y \\neq 0$, the posterior will not be symmetric around $x=0$, and the mean and mode will generally differ.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Under Laplace noise, MAP minimizes expected squared error and MMSE minimizes expected zero-one loss; with heavy tails they coincide because both reduce sensitivity to outliers.**\nThis statement has the definitions of the estimators reversed. The MMSE estimator (posterior mean) minimizes the mean squared error ($L_2$ loss). The MAP estimator (posterior mode) can be seen as minimizing the zero-one loss. This fundamental error makes the entire statement invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In the presence of heavy-tailed noise, both MAP and MMSE converge to the posterior median; for symmetric priors and small $y$ they both return $0$, so they do not diverge.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The estimator that corresponds to the posterior median is the minimum absolute error (MAE) estimator. There is no general principle stating that MAP and MMSE converge to the posterior median in this scenario. Furthermore, for a small positive $y$, the MAP estimate will be near $+\\mu$, not $0$. The MMSE estimate will be a small positive value, not exactly $0$. Only for $y=0$ would the MMSE estimate be $0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
