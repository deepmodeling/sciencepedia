This is a canonical problem in computational neuroscience and is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear objective, a well-defined physical system, and the necessary governing equations and simplifying assumptions. The givens are sufficient to derive a unique analytical solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem that requires the derivation of a fundamental quantity from first principles.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to derive the axial resistance, $R_{\\text{neck}}$, of the cylindrical spine neck. We begin with the provided fundamental relationships: the continuum form of Ohm's law and the definition of the electric field in terms of the electrostatic potential.\n\nThe continuum form of Ohm's law relates the current density vector $\\mathbf{J}$ to the electric field vector $\\mathbf{E}$ and the material's conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\nThe conductivity $\\sigma$ is the reciprocal of the resistivity $\\rho$, so $\\sigma = 1/\\rho$.\nThe electric field is related to the electrostatic potential $V$ by:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V $$\nCombining these two equations gives a relationship between the current density and the potential gradient:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = -\\sigma \\nabla V $$\nThe problem specifies that the spine neck is a uniform cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. We can establish a one-dimensional coordinate system, letting the variable $x$ represent the position along the central axis of the cylinder, from $x=0$ (at the spine head) to $x=L$ (at the dendrite shaft).\n\nThe problem states that the axial field is one-dimensional and the current density is uniform across the cross-section. This simplifies the vector quantities. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and current density $\\mathbf{J}$ are directed purely along the $x$-axis.\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = E_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{J} = J_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\nThe gradient operator $\\nabla$ in one dimension becomes the derivative with respect to $x$, $\\frac{d}{dx}$. Thus, the relationship $E_x = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$ holds.\n\nSubstituting these one-dimensional forms into the combined Ohm's law gives:\n$$ J_x = -\\sigma \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\nThe total axial current $I$ flowing through the neck is the integral of the current density $J_x$ over the cylinder's cross-sectional area $A$. Since $J_x$ is assumed to be uniform across the cross-section, this integral simplifies to a product:\n$$ I = \\int_A J_x \\, dA = J_x \\int_A \\, dA = J_x A $$\nThe cross-sectional area of the cylinder is $A = \\pi r^2$. Therefore, we can express the current density in terms of the total current:\n$$ J_x = \\frac{I}{A} = \\frac{I}{\\pi r^2} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $J_x$ back into the differential equation for the potential:\n$$ \\frac{I}{A} = -\\sigma \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the potential $V$ by separating variables. We move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $V$ to the other:\n$$ dV = -\\frac{I}{\\sigma A} dx $$\nTo find the total potential difference $\\Delta V$ across the length of the neck, we integrate this expression from one end of the cylinder to the other. Let $V(0) = V_{\\text{head}}$ be the potential at the spine head ($x=0$) and $V(L) = V_{\\text{shaft}}$ be the potential at the junction with the dendrite ($x=L$).\n$$ \\int_{V_{\\text{head}}}^{V_{\\text{shaft}}} dV = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{I}{\\sigma A} dx $$\nUnder the given DC conditions, the current $I$ is constant along the neck. The material is homogeneous ($\\sigma$ is constant) and the cylinder is uniform ($A$ is constant). Therefore, the term $\\frac{I}{\\sigma A}$ is constant with respect to the integration variable $x$.\n$$ V_{\\text{shaft}} - V_{\\text{head}} = -\\frac{I L}{\\sigma A} $$\nThe potential drop across the neck, conventionally defined as $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{start}} - V_{\\text{end}}$, is $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{head}} - V_{\\text{shaft}}$.\n$$ \\Delta V = V_{\\text{head}} - V_{\\text{shaft}} = \\frac{I L}{\\sigma A} $$\nThe macroscopic definition of resistance $R$ is the ratio of the voltage drop $\\Delta V$ across a component to the current $I$ flowing through it, $R = \\Delta V / I$. Applying this to our result gives the neck resistance, $R_{\\text{neck}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{neck}} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I} = \\frac{1}{I} \\left(\\frac{I L}{\\sigma A}\\right) = \\frac{L}{\\sigma A} $$\nFinally, we substitute the given expressions for conductivity, $\\sigma = 1/\\rho$, and cross-sectional area, $A = \\pi r^2$, to express the resistance in terms of the specified parameters $\\rho$, $L$, and $r$.\n$$ R_{\\text{neck}} = \\frac{L}{(1/\\rho) (\\pi r^2)} $$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$ R_{\\text{neck}} = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\pi r^2} $$\nThis result confirms the intuitive understanding that resistance increases with length $L$ and material resistivity $\\rho$, and decreases with the cross-sectional area $\\pi r^2$.",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in statistical biophysics and computational neuroscience, well-posed with sufficient and consistent constraints, and stated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe model considers a two-state system for a synaptic contact: \"stable\" and \"eliminated\". The probability of finding the system in a state with effective energy $E$ is given by a Gibbs distribution, $P(E) \\propto \\exp(-E/\\Theta)$, where $\\Theta$ is an effective noise scale. The two states have correlation-dependent effective energies, $E_{\\text{stable}}(C)$ and $E_{\\text{elim}}(C)$.\n\nThe total set of states is just these two, so the partition function $Z$ is the sum of their Boltzmann factors:\n$$Z(C) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{elim}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)$$\nThe probability of stabilization, $P_{\\text{stab}}(C)$, is the probability of the system being in the \"stable\" state:\n$$P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)}{Z(C)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{elim}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{elim}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)$:\n$$P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C) - E_{\\text{elim}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{stable}}(C) - E_{\\text{elim}}(C)}{\\Theta}\\right) + 1}$$\nLet $\\Delta E(C) = E_{\\text{stable}}(C) - E_{\\text{elim}}(C)$ be the effective energy difference. The expression for the stabilization probability becomes a logistic function of this energy difference:\n$$P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E(C)}{\\Theta}\\right)}$$\nThe problem states that $\\Delta E(C)$ is well-approximated by a linear response in the activity correlation $C$. We can thus write this dependence in the general form:\n$$\\Delta E(C) = k_{1}C + k_{2}$$\nwhere $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe now apply the given constraints to find these constants. The first constraint is the balance condition: at a threshold correlation $C = C_{0}$, the two states are equally probable. This means $P_{\\text{stab}}(C_{0}) = P_{\\text{elim}}(C_{0})$. Since the probabilities must sum to $1$, this implies $P_{\\text{stab}}(C_{0}) = 1/2$. Substituting this into our expression for $P_{\\text{stab}}(C)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E(C_{0})}{\\Theta}\\right)}$$\nThis equation holds if and only if the denominator is $2$, which means $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E(C_{0})}{\\Theta}\\right) = 1$. As the exponential of a real number is $1$ only when its argument is $0$, we must have:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta E(C_{0})}{\\Theta} = 0$$\nSince $\\Theta$ is a non-zero noise scale, this implies $\\Delta E(C_{0}) = 0$. Using our linear form for $\\Delta E(C)$:\n$$\\Delta E(C_{0}) = k_{1}C_{0} + k_{2} = 0 \\implies k_{2} = -k_{1}C_{0}$$\nSubstituting $k_2$ back into the expression for $\\Delta E(C)$ gives:\n$$\\Delta E(C) = k_{1}C - k_{1}C_{0} = k_{1}(C - C_{0})$$\nThe stabilization probability can now be written as:\n$$P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{1}(C - C_{0})}{\\Theta}\\right)}$$\nThe second constraint concerns the steepness of the transition. The derivative of $P_{\\text{stab}}(C)$ with respect to $C$, evaluated at $C = C_{0}$, is given as $\\frac{1}{4\\beta}$. Let's compute this derivative. Let $x(C) = \\frac{k_{1}(C - C_{0})}{\\Theta}$. Then $P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = (1 + \\exp(x(C)))^{-1}$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{stab}}}{dC} = -(1 + \\exp(x(C)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(x(C)) \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dC}$$\nThe derivative of $x(C)$ is $\\frac{dx}{dC} = \\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta}$. So,\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{stab}}}{dC} = -\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{1}(C - C_{0})}{\\Theta}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{1}(C - C_{0})}{\\Theta}\\right)\\right)^2} \\cdot \\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta}$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at $C = C_{0}$. At this point, the argument of the exponentials is $0$, and $\\exp(0)=1$.\n$$\\left.\\frac{dP_{\\text{stab}}}{dC}\\right|_{C=C_{0}} = -\\frac{\\exp(0)}{(1 + \\exp(0))^2} \\cdot \\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta} = -\\frac{1}{(1 + 1)^2} \\cdot \\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta}$$\nWe are given that this quantity equals $\\frac{1}{4\\beta}$:\n$$-\\frac{k_{1}}{4\\Theta} = \\frac{1}{4\\beta}$$\nThis allows us to determine the ratio $\\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into our expression for $P_{\\text{stab}}(C)$:\n$$P_{\\text{stab}}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{\\Theta}\\right)(C - C_{0})\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{C - C_{0}}{\\beta}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the stabilization probability.\n\nThe parameters $(C_{0}, \\beta)$ have clear biophysical interpretations.\n$C_{0}$: This parameter represents the threshold value of the activity correlation $C$. At $C = C_{0}$, $P_{\\text{stab}}(C_{0}) = 1/2$, meaning there is an equal chance for the synapse to be stabilized or eliminated. It serves as a homeostatic set-point or a boundary separating depression-like ($C  C_{0}$, $P_{\\text{stab}}  1/2$) from potentiation-like ($C  C_{0}$, $P_{\\text{stab}}  1/2$) outcomes.\n$\\beta$: This parameter dictates the steepness of the transition from the eliminated to the stable regime around the threshold $C_{0}$. From the derivative condition, a smaller value of $\\beta$ corresponds to a larger derivative, and thus a sharper, more switch-like transition. Conversely, a larger $\\beta$ implies a more gradual and less sensitive transition. It encapsulates the relationship between the intrinsic sensitivity of the energy landscape to correlation (related to $k_{1}$) and the level of stochastic noise in the system (related to $\\Theta$). Specifically, $\\beta = -\\Theta/k_{1}$. For stabilization to be favored by higher correlation ($C  C_{0}$), the energy of the stable state must decrease relative to the eliminated state, implying $\\Delta E  0$, which requires $k_{1}  0$. Since $\\Theta  0$ and $\\beta  0$ are given, this is consistent.",
