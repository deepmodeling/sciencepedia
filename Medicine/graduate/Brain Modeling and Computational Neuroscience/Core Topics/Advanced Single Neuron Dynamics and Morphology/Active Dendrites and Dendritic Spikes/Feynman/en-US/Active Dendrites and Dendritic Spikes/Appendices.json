The solution will be developed from first principles of passive cable theory under steady-state conditions.\n\nThe steady-state behavior of a uniform passive cable is described by the passive cable equation at steady state ($d V/d t = 0$), which is given by:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2 V_m}{dx^2} - V_m = 0 $$\nwhere $V_m$ is the membrane potential relative to the resting potential, $x$ is the distance along the cable, and $\\lambda$ is the space constant. The space constant $\\lambda$ is a characteristic length scale over which the voltage attenuates. It is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}} $$\nHere, $r_m$ is the membrane resistance per unit length (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$ or $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$) and $r_a$ is the axial resistance per unit length (in $\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}$ or $\\Omega/\\mathrm{cm}$).\n\nThese parameters, $r_m$ and $r_a$, can be derived from the specific properties of the dendritic cylinder provided in the problem.\n\n$1$. **Axial resistance per unit length ($r_a$)**: This is the intracellular resistivity $R_a$ divided by the cross-sectional area $A$ of the dendrite.\nThe diameter of the cylinder is $d$. The radius is $d/2$. The cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\pi d^2 / 4$.\nThus, $r_a$ is:\n$$ r_a = \\frac{R_a}{A} = \\frac{R_a}{\\pi d^2 / 4} = \\frac{4 R_a}{\\pi d^2} $$\n\n$2$. **Membrane resistance per unit length ($r_m$)**: This is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ divided by the circumference of the dendrite, which is $\\pi d$.\nThus, $r_m$ is:\n$$ r_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d} $$\n\nNote that the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ is irrelevant for steady-state calculations, as capacitive current $I_c = C_m (dV/dt)$ is zero when the voltage does not change with time ($dV/dt=0$).\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$ into the equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (\\pi d)}{4 R_a / (\\pi d^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4 R_a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 R_a}} $$\n\nNext, we must use consistent units for the calculation.

The distal compartment has passive leak conductance $g_d$ to the same $E_L$, and contains a localized active dendritic spike mechanism represented, over the timescale of interest, by an effective regenerative conductance $g_a$ with reversal potential $E_a$ (modeling sodium, calcium, or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) plateau currents).
