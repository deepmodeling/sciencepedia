            "problem": "Consider a pair of isopotential neurons ($2$-node network) connected by an electrical synapse (gap junction) of conductance $g_{gj}$. Each neuron is coupled to a reference ground (resting potential) through its own intrinsic leak conductance, denoted $g_{L,1}$ for neuron $1$ and $g_{L,2}$ for neuron $2$. A constant direct current of amplitude $I$ is injected into neuron $1$ only, and the system is allowed to reach steady state. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the steady-state deviations of the somatic membrane potentials of neurons $1$ and $2$ from rest, respectively. Define the coupling coefficient $k$ from neuron $1$ to neuron $2$ as $k = V_2/V_1$ under this steady-state current injection into neuron $1$.\n\nStarting only from Kirchhoff’s current law and Ohm’s law, and taking steady state to mean that capacitive currents are zero, derive an analytic expression for $k$ in terms of $g_{gj}$, $g_{L,1}$, and $g_{L,2}$ for the general (asymmetric) case where $g_{L,1} \\neq g_{L,2}$, and then specialize your result to the symmetric case $g_{L,1} = g_{L,2} = g_L$. Clearly state any modeling assumptions you use about linearity and reference potentials. Express your final answer as two closed-form analytic expressions arranged as a row matrix $(k_{\\text{asym}} \\;\\; k_{\\text{sym}})$. The coupling coefficient is dimensionless; do not include units. No numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electrical circuit theory applied to a standard, simplified model of neuronal interaction. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the coupling coefficient, $k$, between two isopotential neurons connected by an electrical synapse. We begin by modeling the system as an electrical circuit, adhering to the assumptions provided.\n\n**Modeling Assumptions and Circuit Representation**\n1.  **Isopotential Neurons**: Each neuron is treated as a single node in an electrical circuit with a uniform membrane potential, $V_1$ for neuron $1$ and $V_2$ for neuron $2$. These potentials are defined as the deviation from the resting potential.\n2.  **Reference Potential**: The resting potential is taken as the reference ground, with a potential of $0$.\n3.  **Ohmic Conductances**: The intrinsic properties of each neuron and the gap junction are modeled as linear conductances. The intrinsic leak conductance of neuron $1$ is $g_{L,1}$, and for neuron $2$ it is $g_{L,2}$. The gap junction conductance connecting the two neurons is $g_{gj}$. These conductances are the reciprocals of the corresponding resistances (e.g., $R_{L,1} = 1/g_{L,1}$).\n4.  **Steady State**: The system is at DC steady state. This implies that all time derivatives of potentials are zero, and consequently, any capacitive currents are also zero ($I_C = C \\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$).\n\nThe problem can be represented by the following circuit:\n-   Node $1$ is at potential $V_1$. A current source injects a constant current $I$ into this node. A conductance $g_{L,1}$ connects Node $1$ to ground ($0$ potential).\n-   Node $2$ is at potential $V_2$. A conductance $g_{L,2}$ connects Node $2$ to ground.\n-   A conductance $g_{gj}$ connects Node $1$ and Node $2$.\n\nWe will apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) at each node. KCL states that the algebraic sum of currents entering any node is zero. By convention, we consider currents leaving the node as positive and currents entering as negative.\n\n**Application of Kirchhoff's Current Law**\n\nAt steady state, the sum of currents leaving each node must be zero.\n\n**For Node 1 (Neuron 1):**\nThe total current leaving Node $1$ is the sum of the current flowing through its intrinsic conductance $g_{L,1}$ to ground, the current flowing through the gap junction $g_{gj}$ to Node $2$, minus the current $I$ being injected into the node.\n-   Current through $g_{L,1}$: Using Ohm's Law, this is $I_{g_{L,1}} = g_{L,1} (V_1 - 0) = g_{L,1} V_1$.\n-   Current through $g_{gj}$: Using Ohm's Law, this is $I_{gj, 1 \\to 2} = g_{gj} (V_1 - V_2)$.\n-   Injected current: $-I$.\n\nApplying KCL to Node $1$:\n$$g_{L,1} V_1 + g_{gj} (V_1 - V_2) - I = 0$$\n$$(g_{L,1} + g_{gj})V_1 - g_{gj}V_2 = I \\quad \\quad (1)$$\n\n**For Node 2 (Neuron 2):**\nThe total current leaving Node $2$ is the sum of the current flowing through its intrinsic conductance $g_{L,2}$ to ground and the current flowing through the gap junction $g_{gj}$ to Node $1$. No external current is injected into Node $2$.\n-   Current through $g_{L,2}$: Using Ohm's Law, this is $I_{g_{L,2}} = g_{L,2} (V_2 - 0) = g_{L,2} V_2$.\n-   Current through $g_{gj}$ from Node $2$ to Node $1$: $I_{gj, 2 \\to 1} = g_{gj} (V_2 - V_1)$.\n\nApplying KCL to Node $2$:\n$$g_{L,2} V_2 + g_{gj} (V_2 - V_1) = 0$$\n$$-g_{gj}V_1 + (g_{L,2} + g_{gj})V_2 = 0 \\quad \\quad (2)$$\n\n**Derivation of the Asymmetric Coupling Coefficient ($k_{\\text{asym}}$)**\nThe problem defines the coupling coefficient from neuron $1$ to neuron $2$ as the ratio $k = V_2/V_1$. We can derive an expression for this ratio directly from the KCL equation for Node $2$ (Equation $2$), as this equation relates $V_1$ and $V_2$ independently of the injected current $I$.\n\nFrom Equation $(2)$:\n$$(g_{L,2} + g_{gj})V_2 = g_{gj}V_1$$\nTo find the ratio $k = V_2/V_1$, we divide both sides by $V_1$ and by $(g_{L,2} + g_{gj})$. We can assume $V_1 \\neq 0$, since $I > 0$ and the conductances are positive, ensuring a non-zero voltage response.\n$$k = \\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{g_{gj}}{g_{L,2} + g_{gj}}$$\nThis is the expression for the coupling coefficient in the general, asymmetric case, which we denote as $k_{\\text{asym}}$.\n$$k_{\\text{asym}} = \\frac{g_{gj}}{g_{L,2} + g_{gj}}$$\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation. The coupling depends on a voltage divider formed by the gap junction conductance $g_{gj}$ and the total input conductance of the postsynaptic neuron $2$, as seen from neuron $1$. The voltage $V_2$ is a fraction of $V_1$ determined by the ratio of the coupling conductance to the total conductance through which current from the gap junction can flow at neuron $2$ (which is $g_{L,2} + g_{gj}$).\n\n**Derivation of the Symmetric Coupling Coefficient ($k_{\\text{sym}}$)**\nThe problem asks for the specialized result for the symmetric case, where the intrinsic leak conductances are equal: $g_{L,1} = g_{L,2} = g_L$.\nTo find the symmetric coupling coefficient, $k_{\\text{sym}}$, we substitute $g_{L,2} = g_L$ into the general expression for $k_{\\text{asym}}$.\n$$k_{\\text{sym}} = \\frac{g_{gj}}{g_L + g_{gj}}$$\n\n**Final Expressions**\nThe two requested expressions are:\n1.  Asymmetric case ($k_{\\text{asym}}$): $\\frac{g_{gj}}{g_{L,2} + g_{gj}}$\n2.  Symmetric case ($k_{\\text{sym}}$): $\\frac{g_{gj}}{g_L + g_{gj}}$\nThese are to be presented as a row matrix.",

The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary symbolic parameters ($C$, $g_L$, $g_{gj}$, $E_L$) and a clear, sequential set of tasks leading to a uniquely determinable result (the two eigenvalues).\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal, and unbiased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins by applying Kirchhoff's current law to each neuron. For a given neuron (compartment), the law of charge conservation implies that the rate of change of charge stored on the capacitor must equal the sum of all currents flowing into the compartment. Equivalently, the sum of all currents flowing out of the compartment is zero.\n\nThe currents associated with each neuron $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ are:\n1.  **Capacitive current ($I_{C,i}$)**: The current required to change the voltage across the capacitor. Based on the definition of capacitance $Q=CV$, the current is $I_{C,i} = \\frac{dQ_i}{dt} = C \\frac{dV_i}{dt}$. This current flows outward from the circuit's perspective, representing charge accumulation.\n2.  **Membrane leak current ($I_{L,i}$)**: A passive current flowing across the membrane. According to Ohm's law, $I=gV$, where the potential difference is between the membrane potential $V_i$ and the leak reversal potential $E_L$. This current is $I_{L,i} = g_{L}(V_i - E_L)$.\n3.  **Gap junction current ($I_{gj}$)**: The current flowing between the two neurons. For neuron $1$, the current flowing from it to neuron $2$ is $I_{gj,1 \\to 2} = g_{gj}(V_1 - V_2)$. For neuron $2$, the current from it to neuron $1$ is $I_{gj,2 \\to 1} = g_{gj}(V_2 - V_1) = -I_{gj,1 \\to 2}$.\n4.  **External current ($I_i(t)$)**: An externally injected current, whose sign is defined such that a positive value indicates current injection into the neuron.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law (sum of currents leaving the node equals zero) to neuron $1$:\n$$I_{C,1} + I_{L,1} + I_{gj,1 \\to 2} - I_1(t) = 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each current:\n$$C \\frac{dV_1}{dt} + g_{L}(V_1 - E_L) + g_{gj}(V_1 - V_2) = I_1(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for neuron $2$:\n$$I_{C,2} + I_{L,2} + I_{gj,2 \\to 1} - I_2(t) = 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each current:\n$$C \\frac{dV_2}{dt} + g_{L}(V_2 - E_L) + g_{gj}(V_2 - V_1) = I_2(t)$$\n\nThese are the two coupled ordinary differential equations for the membrane potentials $V_1(t)$ and $V_2(t)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the homogeneous system by setting the external currents to zero, $I_1(t)=0$ and $I_2(t)=0$. We also define the deviation from the leak reversal potential as $u_i(t) = V_i(t) - E_L$. From this definition, we have $V_i(t) = u_i(t) + E_L$. Since $E_L$ is a constant, the time derivative is $\\frac{dV_i}{dt} = \\frac{du_i}{dt}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the first ODE:\n$$C \\frac{du_1}{dt} + g_{L}u_1 + g_{gj}((u_1 + E_L) - (u_2 + E_L)) = 0$$\n$$C \\frac{du_1}{dt} + g_{L}u_1 + g_{gj}(u_1 - u_2) = 0$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$C \\frac{du_1}{dt} = -(g_L + g_{gj})u_1 + g_{gj}u_2$$\nDividing by $C$:\n$$\\frac{du_1}{dt} = -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C}u_1 + \\frac{g_{gj}}{C}u_2$$\n\nSubstituting into the second ODE:\n$$C \\frac{du_2}{dt} + g_{L}u_2 + g_{gj}((u_2 + E_L) - (u_1 + E_L)) = 0$$\n$$C \\frac{du_2}{dt} + g_{L}u_2 + g_{gj}(u_2 - u_1) = 0$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$C \\frac{du_2}{dt} = g_{gj}u_1 - (g_L + g_{gj})u_2$$\nDividing by $C$:\n$$\\frac{du_2}{dt} = \\frac{g_{gj}}{C}u_1 - \\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C}u_2$$\n\nNow, we write this system in matrix form $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(t)=\\mathbf{M}\\,\\mathbf{u}(t)$, where $\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1(t) \\\\ u_2(t) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{u}_1 \\\\ \\dot{u}_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} & \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} \\\\ \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} & -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe system matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is therefore:\n$$\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} & \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} \\\\ \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} & -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{M}$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} - \\lambda & \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} \\\\ \\frac{g_{gj}}{C} & -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\nLet's simplify by setting $A = -\\frac{g_L + g_{gj}}{C}$ and $B = \\frac{g_{gj}}{C}$.

The term $-\\sin(\\Delta\\phi)$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\theta$.\n$$\nH(\\Delta\\phi) = \\frac{g_{gj}}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_0^{2\\pi} (-\\sin(\\Delta\\phi)) d\\theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(2\\theta+2\\Delta\\phi) d\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(2\\theta) d\\theta \\right]\n$$\n$$\nH(\\Delta\\phi) = \\frac{g_{gj}}{2\\pi} \\left[ -2\\pi \\sin(\\Delta\\phi) + 0 - 0 \\right] = -g_{gj} \\sin(\\Delta\\phi)\n$$\nThus, the averaged weak-coupling equation for the phase difference is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\Delta\\phi = H(\\Delta\\phi) = -g_{gj} \\sin(\\Delta\\phi)\n$$\nTo demonstrate the stability of the in-phase locked state, we find the equilibrium points (fixed points) $\\Delta\\phi^*$ of this equation by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n-g_{gj} \\sin(\\Delta\\phi^*) = 0 \\implies \\sin(\\Delta\\phi^*) = 0\n$$\nThis gives fixed points at $\\Delta\\phi^* = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. The in-phase state corresponds to $\\Delta\\phi^* = 0$.\n\nLinear stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $H'(\\Delta\\phi^*)$. The fixed point is stable if $H'(\\Delta\\phi^*)  0$.\n$$\nH'(\\Delta\\phi) = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta\\phi)} [-g_{gj} \\sin(\\Delta\\phi)] = -g_{gj} \\cos(\\Delta\\phi)\n$$\nFor the in-phase state $\\Delta\\phi^*=0$:\n$$\nH'(0) = -g_{gj} \\cos(0) = -g_{gj}\n$$\nSince the gap junction conductance $g_{gj}$ is given as positive ($g_{gj} > 0$), we have $H'(0)  0$. This confirms that the in-phase locked state is stable.",
