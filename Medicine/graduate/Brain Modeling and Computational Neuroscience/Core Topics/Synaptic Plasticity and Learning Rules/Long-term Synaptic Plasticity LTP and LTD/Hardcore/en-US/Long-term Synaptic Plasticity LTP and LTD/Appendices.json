This unique behavior arises from the voltage-dependent block of the receptor's channel by magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$). In this exercise , you will derive the classic biophysical model for this magnesium block from first principles, connecting thermodynamic concepts to the receptor's electrical properties and quantifying the resulting current.",

            "problem": "A central mechanism for long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in excitatory synapses is the voltage-dependent relief of magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) block of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which controls calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) influx during spike–timing-dependent pairing. Consider a single binding site model for $Mg^{2+}$ block of the NMDA receptor pore with the microscopic reaction $Mg^{2+} + R \\rightleftharpoons MgR$, where $R$ denotes the unblocked receptor and $MgR$ the blocked state. Assume the following foundational facts:\n- The association rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is independent of the membrane voltage $V$ and proportional to the extracellular $Mg^{2+}$ concentration $[Mg^{2+}]$.\n- The dissociation (unblocking) rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)$ depends on $V$ via a Boltzmann factor arising from electrical work on an effective charge $z$ traversing a fraction $\\delta$ of the transmembrane potential drop. Consequently, the voltage-dependent dissociation constant satisfies $K_{d}(V) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$ and $K_{d}(V) = K_{d}^{0} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{R T}\\right)$, where $K_{d}^{0}$ is the zero-voltage dissociation constant, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the definition of the fraction of unblocked receptors as the probability that the blocking site is unoccupied at equilibrium, derive a closed-form expression for the voltage-dependent unblocked fraction $B(V)$ in terms of $[Mg^{2+}]$, $K_{d}^{0}$, $z$, $\\delta$, $F$, $R$, $T$, and $V$. Then, using the conductance-based description for an ohmic ion channel, write down the corresponding steady-state NMDA receptor current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$ in terms of the effective conductance $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, the derived $B(V)$, the membrane voltage $V$, and the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$.\n\nFinally, evaluate the current for the following physiologically plausible parameters representing a pairing protocol that partially depolarizes the postsynaptic spine:\n- Temperature $T = 310 \\,\\mathrm{K}$,\n- Charge number $z = 2$,\n- Field fraction $\\delta = 0.7$,\n- Extracellular magnesium concentration $[Mg^{2+}] = 1.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- Zero-voltage dissociation constant $K_{d}^{0} = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- NMDA conductance $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 2.0 \\,\\mathrm{nS}$,\n- NMDA reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 0.0 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$,\n- Membrane voltage $V = -10.0 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$,\n- Faraday’s constant $F = 9.6485 \\times 10^{4} \\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$,\n- Universal gas constant $R = 8.314 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nRound your final numerical answer for the current to four significant figures, and express it in picoamperes.",

There are no subjective elements.\n- **Other criteria**: The problem is self-contained, its setup is complete and consistent, the conditions are physically plausible, and it is directly relevant to the topic of synaptic plasticity in computational neuroscience.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Unblocked Fraction $B(V)$\nThe reaction for the binding of magnesium to the NMDA receptor is given as $Mg^{2+} + R \\rightleftharpoons MgR$. At equilibrium, the law of mass action gives the dissociation constant $K_d(V)$ as:\n$$K_d(V) = \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{[MgR]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of unblocked receptors and $[MgR]$ is the concentration of blocked receptors.\n\nThe fraction of unblocked receptors, $B(V)$, is the ratio of the concentration of unblocked receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [R] + [MgR]$.\n$$B(V) = \\frac{[R]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[R]}{[R] + [MgR]}$$\nTo express $B(V)$ in terms of known quantities, we first rearrange the dissociation constant equation to express $[MgR]$ in terms of $[R]$:\n$$[MgR] = \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{K_d(V)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B(V)$:\n$$B(V) = \\frac{[R]}{[R] + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{K_d(V)}} = \\frac{[R]}{[R] \\left(1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d(V)}\\right)}$$\n$$B(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d(V)}}$$\nThe problem provides the voltage-dependent form of the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d(V) = K_d^0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B(V)$ yields the closed-form expression for the voltage-dependent unblocked fraction:\n$$B(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}$$\n\n### Expression for the NMDA Current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$\nThe problem specifies a conductance-based description for the NMDA receptor current, which follows Ohm's law. The current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$ is the product of the effective ionic conductance and the driving force. The maximal conductance is $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, but the effective conductance is modulated by the fraction of channels that are not blocked by magnesium, which is $B(V)$.\nThus, the effective conductance is $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} B(V)$. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential $V$ and the reversal potential for the channel, $E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$.\nCombining these elements gives the expression for the steady-state current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} B(V) (V - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $B(V)$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)} \\right) (V - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation of the Current\nWe are asked to evaluate $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$ with the given physiological parameters. First, all parameters must be in consistent SI units.\n- $V = -10.0 \\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.010 \\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $[Mg^{2+}] = 1.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_d^0 = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 2.0 \\,\\mathrm{nS} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{S}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 0.0 \\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $T = 310 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $z = 2$\n- $\\delta = 0.7$\n- $F = 9.6485 \\times 10^{4} \\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $R = 8.314 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless exponent in the Boltzmann factor, $-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}$.\n$$ \\text{Exponent} = -\\frac{(2)(0.7)(9.6485 \\times 10^{4} \\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})(-0.010 \\,\\mathrm{V})}{(8.314 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310 \\,\\mathrm{K})} $$\nSince $1 \\,\\mathrm{J} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{C \\cdot V}$, the units cancel out.\n$$ \\text{Exponent} = \\frac{1.4 \\times 9.6485 \\times 10^{4} \\times 0.010}{8.314 \\times 310} = \\frac{1350.79}{2577.34} \\approx 0.524090 $$\nNext, we calculate the blocking term, which includes the exponential of this value.\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right) \\approx \\exp(0.524090) \\approx 1.68886 $$\nThe ratio of magnesium concentration to the zero-voltage dissociation constant is:\n$$ \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} = \\frac{1.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM}}{3.0 \\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNow, we can calculate the unblocked fraction $B(V)$:\n$$ B(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1.68886} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.562953} = \\frac{1}{1.562953} \\approx 0.639815 $$\nFinally, we calculate the current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} B(V) (V - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}) $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (0.639815) \\times (-0.010 \\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}) $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times (0.639815) \\times (-0.010) \\,\\mathrm{A} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx -1.27963 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{A} $$\nThe question asks for the answer in picoamperes ($1 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{A}$).\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx -12.7963 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{A} = -12.7963 \\,\\mathrm{pA} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final numerical answer for the current is $-12.80 \\,\\mathrm{pA}$.",
