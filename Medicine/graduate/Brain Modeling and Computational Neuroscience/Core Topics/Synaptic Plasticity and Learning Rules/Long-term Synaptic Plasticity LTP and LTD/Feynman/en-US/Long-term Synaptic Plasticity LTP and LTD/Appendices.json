A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Unblocked Fraction $B(V)$\nThe reaction for the binding of magnesium to the NMDA receptor is given as $Mg^{2+} + R \\rightleftharpoons MgR$. At equilibrium, the law of mass action gives the dissociation constant $K_d(V)$ as:\n$$K_d(V) = \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{[MgR]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of unblocked receptors and $[MgR]$ is the concentration of blocked receptors.\n\nThe fraction of unblocked receptors, $B(V)$, is the ratio of the concentration of unblocked receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [R] + [MgR]$.\n$$B(V) = \\frac{[R]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[R]}{[R] + [MgR]}$$\nTo express $B(V)$ in terms of known quantities, we first rearrange the dissociation constant equation to express $[MgR]$ in terms of $[R]$:\n$$[MgR] = \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{K_d(V)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B(V)$:\n$$B(V) = \\frac{[R]}{[R] + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}] [R]}{K_d(V)}} = \\frac{[R]}{[R] \\left(1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d(V)}\\right)}$$\n$$B(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d(V)}}$$\nThe problem provides the voltage-dependent form of the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d(V) = K_d^0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B(V)$ yields the closed-form expression for the voltage-dependent unblocked fraction:\n$$B(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}$$\n\n### Expression for the NMDA Current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$\nThe problem specifies a conductance-based description for the NMDA receptor current, which follows Ohm's law. The current $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$ is the product of the effective ionic conductance and the driving force. The maximal conductance is $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, but the effective conductance is modulated by the fraction of channels that are not blocked by magnesium, which is $B(V)$.\nThus, the effective conductance is $g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} B(V)$. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential $V$ and the reversal potential for the channel, $E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$.\nCombining these elements gives the expression for the steady-state current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} B(V) (V - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $B(V)$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[Mg^{2+}]}{K_d^0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)} \\right) (V - E_{\\mathrm{NMDA}})$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation of the Current\nWe are asked to evaluate $I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(V)$ with the given physiological parameters.

Since conductance $G$ must be a positive quantity, the current $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ must be negative, consistent with an inward flow of positive charge. Therefore, the baseline current, $I_{\\mathrm{base}}$, is $-I_0$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{base}} = -I_0 = -30\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n\nWe can now calculate the baseline peak AMPA conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{base}}$, using the ohmic relationship.\n$$G_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{base}}}{V_{\\mathrm{hold}} - E_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}} = \\frac{-30 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{30}{70} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = \\frac{3}{7}\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\nHere, $1\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A/V}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of the LTP-inducing protocol.

The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta_M}{dt} = \\frac{y_H^2 - \\theta_M}{\\tau_M} = \\frac{40^2 - \\theta_M}{300} = \\frac{1600 - \\theta_M}{300} $$\nThe initial condition is $\\theta_M(0)$. At baseline, $\\theta_S(0) = 15 \\text{ Hz}$, and $\\theta_M(0) = \\theta_S(0)^2 = 15^2 = 225$. So, we solve the initial value problem:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta_M}{dt} + \\frac{1}{300}\\theta_M = \\frac{1600}{300}, \\quad \\theta_M(0) = 225 $$\nThis is a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The general solution is of the form $\\theta_M(t) = \\theta_{M, \\text{ss}} + (\\theta_M(0) - \\theta_{M, \\text{ss}})\\exp(-t/\\tau_M)$, where $\\theta_{M, \\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state value. Here, the steady-state value is $y_H^2 = 1600$.\nSo, the solution is:\n$$ \\theta_M(t) = 1600 + (225 - 1600)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{300}\\right) = 1600 - 1375\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{300}\\right) $$\nWe need to find the value of $\\theta_M$ at the end of the episode, i.e., at $t = T = 600 \\text{ s}$.\n$$ \\theta_{M, \\text{post}} = \\theta_M(600) = 1600 - 1375\\exp\\left(-\\frac{600}{300}\\right) = 1600 - 1375\\exp(-2) $$\nNow we can find the post-episode modification boundary $\\theta_{S, \\text{post}}$ using the relation $\\theta_S(t) = \\sqrt{\\theta_M(t)}$:\n$$ \\theta_{S, \\text{post}} = \\sqrt{\\theta_{M, \\text{post}}} = \\sqrt{1600 - 1375\\exp(-2)} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{30 - \\sqrt{1600 - 1375\\exp(-2)}}{15} $$\nNow we compute the numerical value.\n$$ \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528 $$\n$$ \\theta_{S, \\text{post}} \\approx \\sqrt{1600 - 1375 \\times 0.13533528} = \\sqrt{1600 - 186.08599} = \\sqrt{1413.91401} \\approx 37.6020478 $$\nFinally, we calculate $R$:\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{30 - 37.6020478}{15} = \\frac{-7.6020478}{15} \\approx -0.50680319 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-0.5068$. The negative sign indicates that the high-activity episode has shifted the plasticity outcome for the given induction protocol from LTP (since $y_{\\text{ind}}  \\theta_{S, \\text{pre}}$) to LTD (since $y_{\\text{ind}}  \\theta_{S, \\text{post}}$).",
