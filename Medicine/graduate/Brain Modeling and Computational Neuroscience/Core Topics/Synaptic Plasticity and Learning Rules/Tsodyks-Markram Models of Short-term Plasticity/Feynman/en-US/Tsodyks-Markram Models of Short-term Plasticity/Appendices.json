The duration of this period is $\\Delta t = t_{k+1} - t_k$.\n\nFor $u(t)$, the equation is $\\frac{du}{dt} = -\\frac{u}{\\tau_{fac}}$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with the solution:\n$$\nu(t) = u(t_k^+) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_k}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\nAt time $t_{k+1}^-$, we have $t = t_k + \\Delta t$, so:\n$$\nu_{k+1} = u(t_{k+1}^-) = u(t_k^+) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor $x(t)$, the equation is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1-x}{\\tau_{rec}}$. We can rewrite this as $\\frac{d(1-x)}{dt} = -\\frac{1-x}{\\tau_{rec}}$. The solution is:\n$$\n1-x(t) = (1-x(t_k^+)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_k}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\nwhich gives:\n$$\nx(t) = 1 - (1-x(t_k^+)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_k}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\nAt time $t_{k+1}^-$, we have:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x(t_{k+1}^-) = 1 - (1-x(t_k^+)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Discrete-Time Map**\n\nNow, we substitute the jump equations into the relaxation solutions to get the full map from $(u_k, x_k)$ to $(u_{k+1}, x_{k+1})$.\nThe jump equations are:\n$u(t_k^+) = u_k + U(1-u_k)$\n$x(t_k^+) = x_k(1-u_k)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $u_{k+1}$ and $x_{k+1}$:\n$$\nu_{k+1} = \\left[u_k + U(1-u_k)\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx_{k+1} = 1 - \\left[1 - x_k(1-u_k)\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Fixed-Point Equations**\n\nThe steady-state values $(u^*, x^*)$ are the fixed points of this map, found by setting $u_{k+1}=u_k=u^*$ and $x_{k+1}=x_k=x^*$.\n$$\nu^* = \\left[u^* + U(1-u^*)\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx^* = 1 - \\left[1 - x^*(1-u^*)\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\nThese are the fixed-point equations we need to solve.\n\n**4. Solving for the Fixed Points**\n\nFirst, we solve for $u^*$:\n$$\nu^* = \\left[u^*(1-U) + U\\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu^* \\left[1 - (1-U)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\\right] = U\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu^*(\\Delta t) = \\frac{U\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)}{1 - (1-U)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right)}\n$$\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\Delta t / \\tau_{fac})$:\n$$\nu^*(\\Delta t) = \\frac{U}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right) - (1-U)} = \\frac{U}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right) + U - 1}\n$$\n\nNext, we solve for $x^*$:\n$$\nx^* = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right) + x^*(1-u^*)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx^* \\left[1 - (1-u^*)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\\right] = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx^*(\\Delta t) = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)}{1 - (1-u^*)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression provides $x^*$ as a function of $\\Delta t$ and $u^*(\\Delta t)$. Together with the expression for $u^*(\\Delta t)$, this constitutes the closed-form solution.\n\n**5. Fast Stimulation Limit $(\\Delta t \\to 0)$**\n\nWe now compute the limits of $u^*(\\Delta t)$ and $x^*(\\Delta t)$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$.\n\nFor $u^*$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} u^*(\\Delta t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{U}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}\\right) + U - 1}\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\exp(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{fac}}) = \\exp(0) = 1$, the limit is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} u^*(\\Delta t) = \\frac{U}{1 + U - 1} = \\frac{U}{U} = 1\n$$\nLet's denote this limit as $u^*_0=1$.\n\nFor $x^*$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} x^*(\\Delta t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)}{1 - (1-u^*(\\Delta t))\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)}\n$$\nWe evaluate the limits of the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\\right) = 1 - \\exp(0) = 1-1=0\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\left(1 - (1-u^*(\\Delta t))\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of limits, this is:\n$$\n1 - \\left(1-\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} u^*(\\Delta t)\\right) \\left(\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\\right) = 1 - (1 - 1) \\times \\exp(0) = 1 - 0 \\times 1 = 1\n$$\nSince the limit of the numerator is $0$ and the limit of the denominator is $1$, the limit of the fraction is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} x^*(\\Delta t) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nLet's denote this limit as $x^*_0=0$.\n\nThe limiting pair is $(u^*, x^*) = (1, 0)$.\n\n**6. Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe problem asks for a physical interpretation of this result.\n\n-   **Saturation of Utilization ($u^* \\to 1$):** As the interspike interval $\\Delta t$ approaches zero, the presynaptic spikes arrive at a very high frequency. The utilization variable $u$ increases at each spike by an amount $U(1-u)$. Between spikes, it decays exponentially. For very small $\\Delta t$, the decay time is insufficient, so the facilitation effect of each spike accumulates. The iterative application of the update rule $u \\to u+U(1-u)$ drives $u$ towards its maximum possible value of $1$. This corresponds to a state of saturated facilitation, where the mechanism for releasing neurotransmitter is maximally primed.\n\n-   **Vanishing of Available Resources ($x^* \\to 0$):** The variable $x$ represents the fraction of available neurotransmitter resources. At each spike, according to the rule $x(t_k^+) = x(t_k^-)(1-u(t_k^-))$, a fraction $u(t_k^-)$ of the available resources is consumed. In the high-frequency limit, $u^* \\to 1$, meaning that nearly all available resources are consumed at every spike ($x^+ \\approx 0$). The recovery process, governed by $dx/dt = (1-x)/\\tau_{rec}$, attempts to replenish these resources towards $1$. However, with $\\Delta t \\to 0$, there is virtually no time for recovery between spikes. The rate of consumption far outpaces the rate of recovery, leading to a state of profound synaptic depression where the pool of available resources is almost completely depleted. The synapse, despite being maximally facilitated, cannot transmit a signal because it has run out of neurotransmitter to release.\n\nIn summary, the fast stimulation regime drives the synapse into a state of saturated facilitation but simultaneously exhausted resources, a classic example of strong synaptic depression.\nThe final answer is the limiting pair $(u^*, x^*)$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$.\nThe pair is $(1,0)$.\nThis is written as a row matrix.",
