            "solution": "The first step is to determine the steady-state operating point, $r^{*}$. By definition, this is the firing rate at which the system is at equilibrium, meaning the rate of change of $r(t)$ is zero. We set $\\frac{d r(t)}{d t} = 0$ in the governing ODE:\n$$\n\\tau \\cdot 0 = -r^{*} + \\phi\\big(w\\,r^{*} + I\\big)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the steady-state condition:\n$$\nr^{*} = \\phi\\big(w\\,r^{*} + I\\big)\n$$\nThis is a fixed-point equation for $r^{*}$. We can substitute the explicit form of the logistic function $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\nr^{*} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\big(-(w\\,r^{*} + I)\\big)}\n$$\nNow, we use the provided parameter values, $w = 2$ and $I = -1$:\n$$\nr^{*} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\big(-(2r^{*} - 1)\\big)}\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation. We can solve it by seeking a simple solution. Let us test the hypothesis that the argument of the exponential is zero, i.e., $2r^{*} - 1 = 0$. This would imply $r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$. We can check if this value satisfies the equation:\n$$\n\\text{Left-hand side} = r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Right-hand side} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\big(-(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 1)\\big)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\big(-(1 - 1)\\big)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, $r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is indeed a solution. To confirm this is the unique solution, we can analyze the function $f(r) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(2r - 1))}$. The solutions to $r = f(r)$ are the intersection points of the line $y=r$ and the curve $y=f(r)$. The slope of $y=r$ is $1$. The slope of $y=f(r)$ is given by its derivative, $f'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\phi(2r-1) = 2\\phi'(2r-1)$. The derivative of the logistic function, $\\phi'(x)$, has a maximum value of $\\frac{1}{4}$ at $x=0$. Therefore, the maximum slope of $f(r)$ is $2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the slope of $f(r)$ is always less than $1$, there can be only one intersection point. Thus, the solution $r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is unique.\n\nThe second step is to evaluate the derivative of the transfer function, $\\phi'(x)$, at the total input received by the population at the steady state. The total input is $x^{*} = w\\,r^{*} + I$.\nFirst, let's find the analytical expression for $\\phi'(x)$. Given $\\phi(x) = (1 + \\exp(-x))^{-1}$, we use the chain rule:\n$$\n\\phi'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (1 + \\exp(-x))^{-1} = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\exp(-x))^{-2} \\cdot (-\\exp(-x)) = \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{(1 + \\exp(-x))^2}\n$$\nA more compact form, useful for computation, is $\\phi'(x) = \\phi(x)(1 - \\phi(x))$:\n$$\n\\phi(x)(1 - \\phi(x)) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\exp(-x) - 1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{(1 + \\exp(-x))^2}\n$$\nThe two forms are equivalent.\n\nNow, we evaluate the input argument $x^{*} = w\\,r^{*} + I$ at the operating point $r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nx^{*} = w\\,r^{*} + I = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nWe need to calculate $\\phi'(0)$, which represents the local gain of the nonlinearity around the operating point. Using the derived expression for $\\phi'(x)$:\n$$\n\\phi'(0) = \\frac{\\exp(-0)}{(1 + \\exp(-0))^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + 1)^2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the form $\\phi'(x) = \\phi(x)(1 - \\phi(x))$, we first find $\\phi(0)$:\n$$\n\\phi(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThen, we compute the derivative:\n$$\n\\phi'(0) = \\phi(0)(1 - \\phi(0)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The two required values are $r^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\phi'\\big(w\\,r^{*} + I\\big) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix.",

The fixed point equation becomes $r^* = 0$. This solution is self-consistent if the condition $w r^* + I \\le 0$ holds. Substituting $r^* = 0$ into this condition gives:\n$$\nw(0) + I \\le 0 \\implies I \\le 0\n$$\nSo, a fixed point $r^* = 0$ exists if and only if the external drive $I$ is non-positive.\n\n**Case 2: The active fixed point ($r^*  0$)**\nIf the net input $w r^* + I$ is greater than $0$, then $\\max\\{0, w r^* + I\\} = w r^* + I$. The fixed point equation becomes:\n$$\nr^* = w r^* + I\n$$\nWe can solve for $r^*$:\n$$\nr^* - w r^* = I\n$$\n$$\nr^*(1 - w) = I\n$$\n$$\nr^* = \\frac{I}{1 - w}\n$$\nThis solution is self-consistent if the condition $w r^* + I > 0$ holds. Substituting the expression for $r^*$ back into the condition:\n$$\nw \\left(\\frac{I}{1 - w}\\right) + I > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{wI + I(1 - w)}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{wI + I - wI}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{I}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to $r^* > 0$. So, an active fixed point $r^* = \\frac{I}{1-w}$ exists if $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$. This occurs when $I$ and $1-w$ have the same sign. Typically in stable excitatory networks, we have $w  1$, which means $1-w > 0$. In this scenario, the condition for the active fixed point simplifies to $I > 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the local linear stability of a fixed point $r^*$. We linearize the ODE around $r^*$. Let $F(r) = -r + \\phi(w r + I)$. The ODE is $\\tau \\frac{dr}{dt} = F(r)$.\nLet $r(t) = r^* + \\delta r(t)$, where $\\delta r(t)$ is a small perturbation.\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(r^* + \\delta r)}{dt} = F(r^* + \\delta r)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} \\approx F(r^*) + F'(r^*) \\delta r\n$$\nSince $F(r^*) = 0$ at a fixed point, the linearized equation for the perturbation is:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} = F'(r^*) \\delta r\n$$\nThe derivative $F'(r)$ is:\n$$\nF'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}[-r + \\phi(w r + I)] = -1 + w \\phi'(w r + I)\n$$\nThe derivative of the ReLU function, $\\phi'(x)$, is $1$ for $x > 0$ and $0$ for $x  0$. It is undefined at $x=0$, which corresponds to a bifurcation point.\nThe linearized dynamics are governed by the equation $\\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} = \\lambda \\delta r$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{F'(r^*)}{\\tau} = \\frac{-1 + w \\phi'(w r^* + I)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe fixed point $r^*$ is stable if $\\lambda  0$ (perturbations decay) and unstable if $\\lambda > 0$ (perturbations grow).\n\nNow we apply this stability criterion to the two cases for the fixed point.\n-   For the trivial fixed point $r^*=0$ (which exists for $I  0$): The argument of the nonlinearity is $w(0) + I = I  0$. Thus, $\\phi'(I) = 0$. The eigenvalue is:\n    $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{-1 + w(0)}{\\tau} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    Since $\\tau > 0$, $\\lambda$ is always negative. Therefore, the trivial fixed point is always stable when it exists (for $I0$).\n-   For the active fixed point $r^* = \\frac{I}{1-w}$ (which exists for $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$): The argument of the nonlinearity is $w r^* + I = \\frac{I}{1-w}$, which is positive. Thus, $\\phi'(\\frac{I}{1-w}) = 1$. The eigenvalue is:\n    $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{-1 + w(1)}{\\tau} = \\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    For this fixed point to be stable, we require $\\lambda0$, which means $\\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}  0$. Since $\\tau>0$, this simplifies to the stability criterion $w  1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the specific values for $r^*$ and $\\lambda$ using the given parameters: $\\tau = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $w = 0.8$, and $I = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nFirst, we determine which fixed point is relevant.\n-   The parameter $w = 0.8$ is less than $1$.\n-   The parameter $I = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is greater than $0$.\nAccording to our analysis, since $I>0$, the trivial fixed point $r^*=0$ does not exist. Since $I>0$ and $w1$, the condition $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$ is satisfied, so the active fixed point exists.\n\nWe compute the value of the active fixed point $r^*$:\n$$\nr^* = \\frac{I}{1 - w} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{0.2} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nNext, we compute the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$. For the active fixed point with $w1$, the system is stable. The eigenvalue is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}\n$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{0.8 - 1}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{-0.2}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}} = -20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe sign of $\\lambda$ is negative, which means that small perturbations around the fixed point $r^*=2.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ will decay exponentially. The fixed point is stable.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(r^*, \\lambda)$, with $r^*$ in Hz and $\\lambda$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$r^* = 2.5$\n$\\lambda = -20$",
