A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to determine which Fourier mode becomes unstable first as the gain $g$ is increased. This is accomplished by linearizing the dynamical equation around the trivial uniform steady state $r(\\theta) \\equiv 0$. The nonlinearity $F(x)$ is approximated by its linear term, $F(x) \\approx x$, near $x=0$. The linearized dynamics are:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{\\partial r(\\theta,t)}{\\partial t} = - r(\\theta,t) + g \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} W(\\theta-\\theta')\\, r(\\theta',t)\\, d\\theta'\n$$\nWe analyze the stability of this system with respect to perturbations in different Fourier modes. Consider a perturbation of the form $r(\\theta, t) = A_k(t) \\cos(k\\theta)$. Substituting this into the linearized equation and utilizing the given convolution property $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} W(\\theta-\\theta') \\cos(k\\theta') d\\theta' = J_k \\cos(k\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( A_k(t) \\cos(k\\theta) \\right) = -A_k(t) \\cos(k\\theta) + g A_k(t) J_k \\cos(k\\theta)\n$$\nDividing by $\\cos(k\\theta)$ (which is non-zero almost everywhere), we obtain a linear ordinary differential equation for the amplitude $A_k(t)$ of each mode:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{dA_k}{dt} = (g J_k - 1) A_k(t)\n$$\nThe temporal evolution of the amplitude is $A_k(t) = A_k(0) \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\lambda_k t}{\\tau} \\right)$, where $\\lambda_k = gJ_k - 1$ is the growth rate (eigenvalue) for the mode $k$. A mode becomes unstable when its growth rate $\\lambda_k$ becomes positive, i.e., $gJ_k > 1$. The mode that becomes unstable first as $g$ is increased from $0$ is the one that requires the smallest critical gain $g_c^{(k)} = 1/J_k$. This corresponds to the mode with the largest eigenvalue $J_k$ of the connectivity kernel.\n\nThe given values for the kernel eigenvalues are:\n-   $J_0 = 0.6$\n-   $J_1 = 1.2$\n-   $J_2 = 0.7$\n\nComparing these values, $J_1$ is the maximum. Thus, the mode $k=1$ is the first to become unstable and is selected as the winning mode. We can verify the stability of each mode at the given gain $g=1.4$ (with $\\tau=1$):\n-   $\\lambda_0 = g J_0 - 1 = 1.4 \\times 0.6 - 1 = 0.84 - 1 = -0.16$ (stable)\n-   $\\lambda_1 = g J_1 - 1 = 1.4 \\times 1.2 - 1 = 1.68 - 1 = 0.68$ (unstable)\n-   $\\lambda_2 = g J_2 - 1 = 1.4 \\times 0.7 - 1 = 0.98 - 1 = -0.02$ (stable)\n\nOnly the $k=1$ mode is unstable, confirming it as the pattern-forming mode.\n\nThe second task is to determine the steady-state bump profile $r^*(\\theta)$ that emerges. Near the onset of instability (i.e., for $g$ slightly above the critical value $g_c^{(1)} = 1/J_1$), the dynamics of the amplitude of the winning mode, let's call it $A(t)$, are governed by a Stuart-Landau equation. The problem states that the effective cubic coefficient for this equation is given as $\\gamma = 0.34$. The amplitude equation is:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\lambda_1 A - \\gamma A^3\n$$\nHere, $A(t)$ represents the amplitude of the $\\cos(\\theta)$ mode in the firing rate profile, such that $r(\\theta, t) \\approx A(t) \\cos(\\theta)$. The phase of the cosine is set to zero without loss of generality due to the rotational symmetry of the system.\n\nTo find the steady-state bump profile $r^*(\\theta)$, we seek the non-trivial steady-state solution of the amplitude equation, where $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_1 A - \\gamma A^3 = A (\\lambda_1 - \\gamma A^2)\n$$\nThis equation has the trivial solution $A=0$ (the uniform state) and a non-trivial solution for the saturation amplitude $A_{ss}$:\n$$\nA_{ss}^2 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe amplitude must be real, which requires $\\lambda_1 > 0$. We have already established this is the case. Substituting the known values:\n-   $\\lambda_1 = 0.68$\n-   $\\gamma = 0.34$\n\nWe can calculate the steady-state amplitude squared:\n$$\nA_{ss}^2 = \\frac{0.68}{0.34} = 2\n$$\nThe steady-state amplitude is therefore:\n$$\nA_{ss} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nUnder the assumption that higher harmonics are negligible, the steady-state bump profile is a pure cosine with this amplitude:\n$$\nr^*(\\theta) = A_{ss} \\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2} \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\n\nThe final answer requires the winning mode index, which is $k=1$, and the expression for the steady-state bump profile.",

The new rate vector $\\mathbf{r}^{(n+1)}$ is computed by applying the ReLU activation function.\n    e. **Divergence Check**: The L2 norm, $\\|\\mathbf{r}^{(n+1)}\\|_2$, is calculated. If it exceeds the threshold $10^3$, the simulation is terminated, and the result is marked as non-convergent ($c=0$).\n    f. **Convergence Check**: The relative change in the L2 norm, $\\frac{\\| \\mathbf{r}^{(n+1)} - \\mathbf{r}^{(n)} \\|_2}{\\| \\mathbf{r}^{(n)} \\|_2 + \\varepsilon}$, is calculated. If it falls below the tolerance $\\text{tol} = 10^{-10}$ (with $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ for numerical stability), the simulation has converged ($c=1$).\n$3$. **Termination**: If the loop completes the maximum number of iterations without meeting the convergence criterion, the simulation is also considered non-convergent ($c=0$).\n$4$. **Amplitude Calculation**: If the simulation converges ($c=1$), the bump amplitude $A$ is calculated using the steady-state firing rate profile $r_{\\text{final}}$:\n$$\nA \\;=\\; 2\\left|\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} r_{\\text{final}}(\\theta_j) e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\theta_j}\\right| \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{N} \\left| S_{1, \\text{final}} \\right|\n$$\nThe result is rounded to six decimal places. If the simulation did not converge, the amplitude is set to $a=0.0$.\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each of the five test cases provided.",
