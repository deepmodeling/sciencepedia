            "problem": "A local field potential (LFP) segment of duration $T$ is recorded from hippocampus during a memory task and discretely sampled at a sampling frequency $f_{s}$. The sample sequence has length $N$, and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is computed using the conventional $N$-point definition on contiguous samples with no zero-padding. Assume that the LFP is real-valued and stationarity over the $T$-second window is a reasonable approximation. Definitions: LFP stands for local field potential (LFP), and DFT stands for discrete Fourier transform (DFT). \n\nStarting from the standard sampling definitions $f_{s}=\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\Delta t$ is the sampling interval, and $T=N\\Delta t$, derive the expression for the set of positive Fourier frequencies associated with the DFT bin indices $k$ for a real-valued signal, and show that the frequency spacing depends on the finite observation time $T$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of digital signal processing and computational neuroscience, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first derive the general expression for the frequencies associated with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for a discretely sampled real-valued signal, then to specialize this result to find specific DFT bin indices corresponding to the theta frequency band.\n\nLet the local field potential (LFP) signal be represented by a sequence of $N$ real-valued samples, $x[n]$, for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The signal is sampled at a frequency $f_s$, which corresponds to a sampling interval of $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{f_s}$. The total duration of the recording is $T = N \\Delta t$.\n\nThe $N$-point DFT of the sequence $x[n]$ is defined as:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi kn}{N}\\right)$$\nfor bin indices $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, where $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nEach DFT coefficient $X[k]$ measures the signal's content corresponding to a specific complex exponential basis function $\\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi kn}{N}\\right)$. To find the physical frequency associated with bin index $k$, we relate the discrete-time index $n$ to the continuous time $t$. The time of the $n$-th sample is $t_n = n \\Delta t$. We seek the continuous frequency $f$ of a complex sinusoid $\\exp(j 2\\pi f t)$ that, when sampled at times $t_n$, matches the DFT basis function.\n$$ \\exp(j 2\\pi f t_n) = \\exp(j 2\\pi f (n \\Delta t)) $$\nEquating this with the $k$-th basis function:\n$$ \\exp(j 2\\pi f n \\Delta t) = \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi kn}{N}\\right) $$\nFor this equality to hold for all $n$, the exponents must be equal (modulo $2\\pi$):\n$$ 2\\pi f n \\Delta t = \\frac{2\\pi kn}{N} $$\n$$ f \\Delta t = \\frac{k}{N} $$\nSolving for the frequency $f$, which we denote $f_k$ for index $k$:\n$$ f_k = \\frac{k}{N \\Delta t} $$\nUsing the given definition $T = N \\Delta t$, the expression for the set of Fourier frequencies is:\n$$ f_k = \\frac{k}{T}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\} $$\nAlternatively, substituting $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{f_s}$, we can write $f_k = \\frac{k f_s}{N}$.\n\nThe problem next asks to show that the frequency spacing depends on the finite observation time $T$. The frequency spacing, or frequency resolution, is the difference between frequencies of adjacent bins, $\\Delta f$.\n$$ \\Delta f = f_{k+1} - f_k = \\frac{k+1}{T} - \\frac{k}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} $$\nThis result explicitly demonstrates that the frequency spacing is the reciprocal of the total observation time $T$. A longer recording window $T$ yields a finer frequency resolution (smaller $\\Delta f$).\n\nFor a real-valued signal $x[n]$, the DFT exhibits Hermitian symmetry: $X[k] = X[N-k]^*$, where $*$ denotes the complex conjugate. This implies that the magnitude spectrum is symmetric, $|X[k]| = |X[N-k]|$. All unique information is contained in the first half of the spectrum. For $N$ even, this corresponds to indices $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, \\frac{N}{2}\\}$. The bin $k=0$ corresponds to the DC component, $f_0 = 0$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$. The bin $k=\\frac{N}{2}$ corresponds to the Nyquist frequency, $f_{N/2} = \\frac{N/2}{T} = \\frac{N/2}{N \\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta t} = \\frac{f_s}{2}$. The problem asks for indices corresponding to positive frequencies, which are $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\frac{N}{2}\\}$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given case: $f_s = 1000$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $N = 2000$ samples.\nFirst, we calculate the observation duration $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{N}{f_s} = \\frac{2000}{1000 \\text{ s}^{-1}} = 2 \\text{ s} $$\nThe frequency resolution is $\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{2 \\text{ s}} = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe frequency associated with bin index $k$ is:\n$$ f_k = k \\cdot \\Delta f = k \\times 0.5 \\text{ Hz}, \\quad \\text{or equivalently, } f_k = \\frac{k}{2} \\text{ Hz} $$\nThe one-sided spectrum considers indices $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, \\frac{2000}{2}\\}$, which is $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 1000\\}$.\nWe need to find all integer indices $k$ in this range for which the corresponding frequency $f_k$ lies within the canonical theta band, defined as $[4, 8]$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$ inclusive. This requires solving the inequality:\n$$ 4 \\le f_k \\le 8 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_k$:\n$$ 4 \\le \\frac{k}{2} \\le 8 $$\nTo solve for $k$, we multiply the entire inequality by $2$:\n$$ 4 \\times 2 \\le k \\le 8 \\times 2 $$\n$$ 8 \\le k \\le 16 $$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the set of bin indices whose frequencies fall within the theta band is $\\{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\\}$. These indices are all within the valid range for the one-sided spectrum, $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 1000\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of digital signal processing, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated in an objective, formal manner. We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe process of uniform sampling of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ at a sampling frequency $f_s = 1/T_s$ can be mathematically modeled as the multiplication of $x(t)$ by an infinite train of Dirac delta functions (a Dirac comb), $\\delta_{T_s}(t)$. The sampled signal in continuous time, $x_s(t)$, is thus:\n$$x_s(t) = x(t) \\cdot \\delta_{T_s}(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - nT_s)$$\nwhere $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function and $n$ is an integer.\n\nTo understand the effect of sampling in the frequency domain, we apply the Fourier transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cdot\\}$. The multiplication in the time domain becomes a convolution in the frequency domain:\n$$X_s(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x_s(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} * \\mathcal{F}\\{\\delta_{T_s}(t)\\} = X(f) * \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - nT_s)\\right\\}$$\nwhere $X(f)$ is the Fourier transform of the original signal $x(t)$, and $*$ denotes the convolution operator.\n\nThe Fourier transform of the Dirac comb must be determined. The Dirac comb is a periodic function with period $T_s$, so it can be represented by a Fourier series:\n$$\\delta_{T_s}(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_k e^{j2\\pi k (1/T_s) t}$$\nwhere the Fourier series coefficients $c_k$ are given by:\n$$c_k = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{-T_s/2}^{T_s/2} \\delta_{T_s}(t) e^{-j2\\pi k (1/T_s) t} dt = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{-T_s/2}^{T_s/2} \\delta(t) e^{-j2\\pi k f_s t} dt$$\nBy the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, this simplifies to:\n$$c_k = \\frac{1}{T_s} e^0 = \\frac{1}{T_s} = f_s$$\nSubstituting the coefficients back into the series representation of the Dirac comb gives:\n$$\\delta_{T_s}(t) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{j2\\pi k f_s t}$$\nNow, taking the Fourier transform of this sum, and using the identity $\\mathcal{F}\\{e^{j2\\pi f_c t}\\} = \\delta(f - f_c)$, we get:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{\\delta_{T_s}(t)\\} = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{j2\\pi k f_s t}\\} = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s)$$\nThis result shows that the Fourier transform of a Dirac comb in the time domain is another Dirac comb in the frequency domain, with impulses located at integer multiples of the sampling frequency $f_s$.\n\nWe can now complete the convolution for $X_s(f)$:\n$$X_s(f) = X(f) * \\left( f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s) \\right)$$\nUsing the identity for convolution with a delta function, $G(f) * \\delta(f - f_c) = G(f - f_c)$, we obtain:\n$$X_s(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(f - kf_s)$$\nThis equation is the mathematical foundation of sampling theory. It states that the spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(f)$, consists of infinitely many copies of the original signal's spectrum, $X(f)$, scaled by $f_s$ and shifted to be centered at every integer multiple of the sampling frequency, $k f_s$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific contaminant signal $s(t) = A\\cos(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)$. Using Euler's formula, we can write its Fourier transform, $S(f)$, as:\n$$s(t) = \\frac{A}{2} \\left( e^{j(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)} + e^{-j(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)} \\right)$$\n$$S(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{s(t)\\} = \\frac{A}{2} e^{j\\phi} \\delta(f - f_0) + \\frac{A}{2} e^{-j\\phi} \\delta(f + f_0)$$\nThe spectrum of the contaminant consists of two spectral lines at frequencies $f_0$ and $-f_0$.\n\nWhen this signal is sampled, its spectrum, $S_s(f)$, becomes a replicated version of $S(f)$:\n$$S_s(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} S(f - kf_s) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{A}{2} e^{j\\phi} \\delta(f - kf_s - f_0) + \\frac{A}{2} e^{-j\\phi} \\delta(f - kf_s + f_0) \\right]$$\nThe resulting spectrum has spectral lines at all frequencies $f = f_0 + kf_s$ and $f = -f_0 + kf_s$ for every integer $k$.\n\nThe discrete-time baseband spectrum is observed over the frequency interval $[0, f_s/2]$. Aliasing occurs when a frequency component from the original signal, located outside the range $[-f_s/2, f_s/2]$, is mapped into this baseband due to the spectral replication. An original frequency $f_0$ will appear as an aliased frequency, $f_a$, in the baseband if for some integer $k$:\n$$f_a = |f_0 - kf_s| \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad 0 \\le f_a \\le \\frac{f_s}{2}$$\nThis is the frequency-mapping principle. The integer $k$ is chosen to \"fold\" the frequency $f_0$ into the baseband. This is equivalent to finding the integer $k$ that minimizes the absolute difference $|f_0 - kf_s|$. This value of $k$ is the integer closest to the ratio $f_0/f_s$, i.e., $k = \\text{round}(f_0/f_s)$.\n\nWe now apply this derivation to the specific case provided:\nSampling frequency, $f_s = 500$ Hz.\nContaminant frequency, $f_0 = 340$ Hz.\n\nThe Nyquist frequency is $f_s/2 = 500/2 = 250$ Hz. Since $f_0 = 340$ Hz $> 250$ Hz, the contaminant frequency is above the Nyquist limit, and aliasing is expected. The baseband of interest is $[0, 250]$ Hz.\n\nTo find the aliased frequency $f_a$, we use the mapping principle $f_a = |f_0 - kf_s|$, where $k = \\text{round}(f_0/f_s)$.\nFirst, we compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{f_0}{f_s} = \\frac{340}{500} = 0.68$$\nThe nearest integer to $0.68$ is $k=1$.\n\nNow, we calculate the aliased frequency $f_a$:\n$$f_a = |f_0 - 1 \\cdot f_s| = |340 - 500| = |-160|$$\n$$f_a = 160 \\text{ Hz}$$\nLet's also check the aliasing of the negative frequency component at $-f_0 = -340$ Hz. The replicas are at $-340 + m \\cdot 500$ for integer $m$. For $m=1$, the frequency is $-340 + 500 = 160$ Hz. For $m=0$, it is $-340$ Hz, and for $m=2$, it is $660$ Hz.\nBoth the positive and negative frequency components of the original signal alias to the same absolute frequency in the baseband. The result $f_a = 160$ Hz lies within the specified baseband $[0, f_s/2] = [0, 250]$ Hz.\n\nTherefore, the single aliased frequency that will be observed in the sampled data's baseband spectrum is $160$ Hz.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of windowing functions in the context of resolving closely spaced sinusoidal components in a neural signal. The solution proceeds in four stages: first, defining spectral leakage; second, deriving the properties of the rectangular, Hann, and Hamming windows; third, applying the given resolution criteria to select the appropriate window; and finally, calculating the minimum resolvable frequency separation for the selected window.\n\n**1. Spectral Leakage**\n\nA discrete-time signal $x[n]$ of infinite duration has a Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) defined as $X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n}$, where $\\omega$ is the normalized angular frequency in radians per sample. In practice, we analyze a finite-length segment of the signal, which is equivalent to multiplying the signal $x[n]$ by a window function $w[n]$ of length $N$. The window function is zero outside the interval $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The resulting windowed signal is $x_w[n] = x[n] \\cdot w[n]$.\n\nAccording to the convolution theorem of the DTFT, multiplication in the time domain corresponds to periodic convolution in the frequency domain:\n$$X_w(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} X(e^{j\\theta}) W(e^{j(\\omega-\\theta)}) d\\theta$$\nwhere $W(e^{j\\omega})$ is the DTFT of the window function $w[n]$.\n\nFor a pure sinusoidal component, such as $x[n] = A\\cos(\\omega_0 n)$, its DTFT consists of two Dirac delta functions: $X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\pi A (\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0))$ for $\\omega \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. When convolved with the window's spectrum $W(e^{j\\omega})$, each delta function is replaced by a shifted and scaled version of $W(e^{j\\omega})$. The resulting spectrum is:\n$$X_w(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ W(e^{j(\\omega-\\omega_0)}) + W(e^{j(\\omega+\\omega_0)}) \\right]$$\nThe DTFT of any finite-length window, $W(e^{j\\omega})$, is not a delta function but a continuous function with a central peak (the mainlobe) and a series of smaller peaks (sidelobes). Consequently, the energy of the sinusoid, which is ideally concentrated at the single frequency $\\omega_0$, is spread or \"leaks\" into adjacent frequencies. This phenomenon is termed **spectral leakage**. The extent of this leakage is determined by the characteristics of the window's sidelobes.\n\n**2. Window Properties**\n\nWe analyze the three candidate windows of length $N = 1024$. The frequency $f$ in Hz relates to the normalized angular frequency $\\omega$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f / f_s$.\n\n**a) Rectangular Window**\nThe rectangular window is defined as $w_R[n] = 1$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nIts DTFT is the Dirichlet kernel:\n$$W_R(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{-j\\omega n} = e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}$$\nThe magnitude is $|W_R(e^{j\\omega})| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)} \\right|$.\n- **Mainlobe Width**: The mainlobe is centered at $\\omega=0$. The first zeros occur when the numerator $\\sin(\\omega N/2) = 0$ while the denominator is non-zero. This happens at $\\omega N/2 = \\pm k\\pi$ for integer $k \\neq 0$. The first zeros are at $k=\\pm 1$, giving $\\omega = \\pm 2\\pi/N$. In terms of frequency in Hz, the first zero is at $f = \\frac{\\omega f_s}{2\\pi} = \\frac{(2\\pi/N) f_s}{2\\pi} = \\frac{f_s}{N}$. The mainlobe width, defined as the distance between the first zeros, is $2 \\times \\frac{f_s}{N} = \\frac{2f_s}{N}$.\n- **Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL)**: The ratio of the first sidelobe's peak to the mainlobe's peak is approximately $2/(3\\pi)$. In decibels, this is $20\\log_{10}(2/(3\\pi)) \\approx -13.3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\n**b) Hann Window**\nThe Hann window is defined as $w_{Hn}[n] = 0.5 - 0.5\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}\\right)$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nIts DTFT can be expressed as a superposition of three shifted Dirichlet kernels:\n$W_{Hn}(e^{j\\omega}) = 0.5 W_R(e^{j\\omega}) - 0.25 \\left[ W_R(e^{j(\\omega - \\frac{2\\pi}{N-1})}) + W_R(e^{j(\\omega + \\frac{2\\pi}{N-1})}) \\right]$.\nThis superposition causes cancellation of the first sidelobes of the rectangular window transform, leading to much lower overall sidelobe levels at the cost of a wider mainlobe.\n- **Mainlobe Width**: The placement of the negative kernels at $\\omega \\approx \\pm 2\\pi/N$ cancels the mainlobe of the central kernel near its first zero, effectively pushing the first zero of the combined transform outwards. For large $N$, the first zero is approximately at $\\omega = \\pm 4\\pi/N$. The corresponding frequency is $f = \\frac{(4\\pi/N) f_s}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2f_s}{N}$. The mainlobe width is $2 \\times \\frac{2f_s}{N} = \\frac{4f_s}{N}$.\n- **Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL)**: The peak sidelobe is significantly attenuated, with a standard value of approximately $-31.5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\n**c) Hamming Window**\nThe Hamming window is defined as $w_{Ha}[n] = 0.54 - 0.46\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}\\right)$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nSimilar to the Hann window, its DTFT is a weighted sum of three shifted Dirichlet kernels:\n$W_{Ha}(e^{j\\omega}) = 0.54 W_R(e^{j\\omega}) - 0.23 \\left[ W_R(e^{j(\\omega - \\frac{2\\pi}{N-1})}) + W_R(e^{j(\\omega + \\frac{2\\pi}{N-1})}) \\right]$.\nThe coefficients $0.54$ and $0.46$ are chosen to nearly cancel the first sidelobe of the rectangular window's transform, which results in the lowest possible peak sidelobe level for this class of windows.\n- **Mainlobe Width**: The structure is analogous to the Hann window. The mainlobe width is also $\\frac{4f_s}{N}$.\n- **Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL)**: The optimized cancellation results in a very low peak sidelobe level of approximately $-42.8\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\n**3. Application of Criteria**\n\n**Criterion 1: Rayleigh-type separation**\nThe minimum frequency separation, $\\Delta f_{\\min}$, is defined such that the peak of one component falls on the first zero of the other. This distance is half of the mainlobe width.\n- For Rectangular: $\\Delta f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2f_s}{N}\\right) = \\frac{f_s}{N}$.\n- For Hann: $\\Delta f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4f_s}{N}\\right) = \\frac{2f_s}{N}$.\n- For Hamming: $\\Delta f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4f_s}{N}\\right) = \\frac{2f_s}{N}$.\n\n**Criterion 2: Worst-case leakage**\nThe maximum sidelobe amplitude relative to the mainlobe peak must be less than $0.01$. We convert this linear ratio to decibels (dB):\n$$ \\text{Threshold (dB)} = 20 \\log_{10}(0.01) = 20 \\times (-2) = -40\\,\\mathrm{dB} $$\nA window is acceptable if its Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) is less than $-40\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n- Rectangular window: $PSL \\approx -13.3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This is greater than $-40\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, so it fails the criterion.\n- Hann window: $PSL \\approx -31.5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This is greater than $-40\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, so it fails the criterion.\n- Hamming window: $PSL \\approx -42.8\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This is less than $-40\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, so it **satisfies** the criterion.\n\nThe only window that meets the stringent leakage requirement is the Hamming window.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nWe must use the Hamming window to compute the minimum frequency separation. Using the Rayleigh-type criterion for the Hamming window:\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\min} = \\frac{2f_s}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values $f_s = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $N = 1024$:\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\min} = \\frac{2 \\times 1000}{1024} = \\frac{2000}{1024} = 1.953125\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. Rounding $1.953125$ to four significant figures yields $1.953$.\nTherefore, the minimum frequency separation is $1.953\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.",
