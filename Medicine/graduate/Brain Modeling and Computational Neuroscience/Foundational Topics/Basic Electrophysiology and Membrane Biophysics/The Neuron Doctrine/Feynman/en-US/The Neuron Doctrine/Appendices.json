The provided parameters are realistic for a biological neuron.\n\nWe will proceed with the solution, which consists of three parts:\n1.  Derivation of the governing differential equation for the membrane potential and identification of the time constant.\n2.  Calculation of the numerical value of the time constant.\n3.  Conceptual explanation of the time constant's role in synaptic integration, grounded in the neuron doctrine.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Equation and Identification of the Time Constant**\n\nWe model a patch of a neuronal membrane as a parallel resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. The problem statement directs us to start from the principle of charge conservation, also known as Kirchhoff's Current Law, applied to the membrane patch. The total current injected into the neuron, $I_{inj}$, must be equal to the sum of the currents flowing out through the membrane's resistive (leak) and capacitive pathways.\n\nLet $V(t)$ be the membrane potential at time $t$, and $V_L$ be the constant leak reversal potential. The total current flowing across the membrane is the sum of the ionic current, $I_L$, passing through the leak channels (modeled as a resistor), and the capacitive current, $I_C$, which charges or discharges the membrane capacitance.\n\n$$ I_{total} = I_L + I_C $$\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the leak current $I_L$ is proportional to the potential difference across the resistor:\n$$ I_L = \\frac{V(t) - V_L}{R} $$\nwhere $R$ is the total membrane resistance of the patch.\n\nThe capacitive current is given by the constitutive relation for a capacitor:\n$$ I_C = C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} $$\nwhere $C$ is the total membrane capacitance of the patch.\n\nAn external current $I_{inj}$ is injected into the neuron. By conservation of charge, this injected current must equal the total current flowing across the membrane:\n$$ I_{inj} = I_L + I_C = \\frac{V(t) - V_L}{R} + C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} $$\n\nThe problem provides the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$) and specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ (in units of $\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^2$). These are properties per unit area. For a membrane patch of area $A$, the total resistance and capacitance are:\n$$ R = \\frac{R_m}{A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C = C_m A $$\nThe injected current is given as a constant current density, $J_{inj}$ (in units of $\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^2$), so the total injected current is $I_{inj} = J_{inj} A$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into our charge conservation equation:\n$$ J_{inj} A = \\frac{V(t) - V_L}{R_m/A} + (C_m A) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} $$\n\nDividing the entire equation by the area $A$ eliminates the dependence on the patch's specific geometry, yielding an equation in terms of intensive properties:\n$$ J_{inj} = \\frac{V(t) - V_L}{R_m} + C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the equation for the membrane voltage relative to the leak reversal potential. We define a new variable $v(t) = V(t) - V_L$. Its time derivative is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d(V - V_L)}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dt}$ since $V_L$ is a constant. Substituting $v(t)$ into the equation gives:\n$$ C_m \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} + \\frac{v(t)}{R_m} = J_{inj} $$\n\nTo obtain the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, we divide by $C_m$:\n$$ \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} + \\frac{v(t)}{R_m C_m} = \\frac{J_{inj}}{C_m} $$\n\nThis is the required differential equation. The standard form for a first-order system with time constant $\\tau$ is $\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{x}{\\tau} = F(t)$. By comparing our derived equation to this standard form, we can identify the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$, as:\n$$ \\tau_m = R_m C_m $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Membrane Time Constant**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$$ R_m = 10^{4}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2} $$\n$$ C_m = 1\\,\\mu\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2} $$\n\nWe compute the product to find the time constant $\\tau_m$:\n$$ \\tau_m = R_m C_m = (10^{4}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2}) $$\nThe units of area ($\\text{cm}^2$) cancel out, leaving units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{F}$. The product of Ohms and Farads is seconds ($\\Omega \\cdot \\text{F} = \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{A}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{V}} = \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{A}} = \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{C}/\\text{s}} = \\text{s}$).\n\n$$ \\tau_m = 10^{4} \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{s} = 0.01 \\, \\text{s} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the numerical value is $0.0100$ seconds.\n\n**3. Conceptual Explanation**\n\nThe neuron doctrine establishes that neurons are anatomically and functionally discrete, individual cells that serve as the fundamental computational units of the nervous system. According to this doctrine, and under the stated conditions of negligible direct electrical or ephaptic coupling, a neuron's subthreshold behavior is governed by its own intrinsic biophysical properties.\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau_m = R_m C_m$, is a direct physical consequence of these intrinsic properties. It represents the characteristic time scale over which the neuron's membrane potential, $v(t)$, responds to an injected current. Specifically, following a step change in current, the membrane potential will change exponentially towards its new steady-state value, reaching approximately $1 - 1/e \\approx 63.2\\%$ of the total change in one time constant.\n\nThis property has a critical functional implication for how a neuron integrates synaptic inputs. Synaptic inputs cause brief, transient currents to be injected into the postsynaptic neuron.\n- A neuron with a **large time constant** ($\\tau_m$) has a \"slow\" membrane. The voltage response to a single synaptic input will rise and decay slowly. This allows the neuron to summate inputs that are separated by relatively long time intervals (temporal summation). Such a neuron acts as an integrator or a low-pass filter, effectively smoothing out high-frequency fluctuations in its input.\n- A neuron with a **small time constant** ($\\tau_m$) has a \"fast\" membrane. The voltage response is brief, rising and falling quickly. This allows the neuron to resolve synaptic inputs that arrive in rapid succession as distinct events, making it a coincidence detector.\n\nTherefore, the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ constrains the maximal temporal rate at which a neuron can process inputs independently. For two successive synaptic inputs to be treated as separate events rather than being summed into a single, larger potential, the second input must arrive after the voltage change from the first has substantially decayed. The time scale for this decay is dictated by $\\tau_m$. The maximal frequency of inputs that the neuron can resolve is thus inversely related to its time constant, roughly on the order of $1/\\tau_m$. This establishes a fundamental limit on the temporal processing capability of the neuron, a limit that arises directly from the physical properties of the discrete cellular unit, as specified by the neuron doctrine.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state cable equation for a uniform cylindrical dendrite, the calculation of the electrotonic length constant, and the determination of a minimum separation distance for functional independence based on an attenuation threshold. The derivation will start from the fundamental principles of conservation of current and Ohm's law.\n\nFirst, we model the dendrite as a one-dimensional uniform cylinder of radius $a$. We consider an infinitesimal segment of the cylinder of length $dx$ at a position $x$ along its axis. Let $V(x)$ be the intracellular voltage relative to a ground reference potential outside the cell. The axial current flowing inside the cylinder is denoted by $i_a(x)$, and the membrane current leaking out of the cylinder per unit length is $j_m(x)$.\n\nThe principle of conservation of current (Kirchhoff's current law) applied to the segment $dx$ states that the change in axial current along the segment must equal the current that leaks out through the membrane. In the steady-state, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{di_a}{dx} = -j_m(x) $$\n\nNext, we apply Ohm's law to relate the currents to the voltage.\nThe axial current $i_a$ is driven by the voltage gradient along the axis of the dendrite. The resistance of the infinitesimal segment $dx$ to axial current flow is given by $dR_{axial} = R_a \\frac{dx}{A}$, where $R_a$ is the axial resistivity and $A = \\pi a^2$ is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. Ohm's law states that $dV = -i_a dR_{axial}$, which in differential form is:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -i_a(x) \\frac{R_a}{\\pi a^2} $$\nRearranging for the axial current, we get:\n$$ i_a(x) = -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_a} \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\n\nThe membrane current density per unit length, $j_m$, is the current leaking out through the membrane over a unit length of the cylinder. The resistance of the membrane patch corresponding to the infinitesimal length $dx$ is $dR_{membrane} = \\frac{R_m}{\\text{Area}} = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a dx}$, where $R_m$ is the specific membrane resistance. The current leaking through this patch is $dI_m = \\frac{V(x)}{dR_{membrane}} = \\frac{V(x) (2\\pi a dx)}{R_m}$. The membrane current per unit length is thus $j_m = \\frac{dI_m}{dx}$:\n$$ j_m(x) = \\frac{2\\pi a}{R_m} V(x) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $i_a(x)$ and $j_m(x)$ into the current conservation equation. First, we differentiate the expression for $i_a(x)$ with respect to $x$, assuming the parameters $a$ and $R_a$ are constant:\n$$ \\frac{di_a}{dx} = -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} $$\nEquating this with $-j_m(x)$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2\\pi a}{R_m} V(x) $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the steady-state cable equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi a}{R_m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_a}{\\pi a^2}\\right) V(x) $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 R_a}{a R_m} V(x) $$\nThis equation is typically written in the form $\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V = 0$ or $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} V(x) = 0$.

The analysis begins by modeling the two neurons as a simple electrical circuit and applying Kirchhoff's current law.\n\nThe system is at a steady state with a direct current injection. This implies that all time-derivatives are zero, and thus any capacitive currents vanish. The neurons are described as isopotential, single-compartment passive membranes. Each resting neuron can be modeled as a resistor with resistance $R_{in}$, or equivalently, a conductor with leak conductance $g_{L} = 1/R_{in}$. The membrane potential deviations from rest, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, are the voltages across these conductors relative to a common ground (the resting potential). The two neurons are connected by a gap junction, which is modeled as a conductor with conductance $g_{j}$. A constant current $I$ is injected into neuron $1$, and no current is injected into neuron $2$.\n\nWe apply Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) to the nodes representing each neuron.
