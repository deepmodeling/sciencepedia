It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and realistic. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Rheobase Current\n\nThe dynamics of the membrane potential $V$ are given by:\n$$C \\,\\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L \\left(V - E_L\\right) + I$$\nA steady state is reached when the membrane potential is no longer changing, i.e., $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. Let the steady-state potential be $V_{ss}$. The equation becomes:\n$$0 = -g_L \\left(V_{ss} - E_L\\right) + I$$\nSolving for the steady-state potential as a function of current gives:\n$$V_{ss}(I) = E_L + \\frac{I}{g_L}$$\nThe rheobase current $I_{\\text{rh}}$ is defined as the current for which the steady-state potential is equal to the threshold potential, $V_{ss}(I_{\\text{rh}}) = V_{\\text{th}}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$V_{\\text{th}} = E_L + \\frac{I_{\\text{rh}}}{g_L}$$\nWe can now solve for $I_{\\text{rh}}$ to find its functional dependence on $V_{\\text{th}}$ and $E_L$:\n$$I_{\\text{rh}} = g_L \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - E_L\\right)$$\nThis is the required functional dependence.\n\n### Error Propagation for the Standard Deviation of Rheobase\n\nWe need to quantify the standard deviation of $I_{\\text{rh}}$, denoted $\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}$, given the uncertainties in $V_{\\text{th}}$ and $E_L$. We use the formula for first-order linear error propagation for a function $f(x, y)$. The variance $\\sigma_f^2$ is approximately:\n$$\\sigma_f^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 \\sigma_x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 \\sigma_y^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) \\text{Cov}(x, y)$$\nwhere $\\text{Cov}(x, y) = \\rho_{xy} \\sigma_x \\sigma_y$ is the covariance between $x$ and $y$.\n\nIn our case, the function is $I_{\\text{rh}}(V_{\\text{th}}, E_L) = g_L (V_{\\text{th}} - E_L)$. The variables are $V_{\\text{th}}$ and $E_L$, and $g_L$ is a constant. First, we compute the partial derivatives of $I_{\\text{rh}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{rh}}}{\\partial V_{\\text{th}}} = g_L$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{\\text{rh}}}{\\partial E_L} = -g_L$$\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the variance formula:\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}^2 \\approx \\left(g_L\\right)^2 \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 + \\left(-g_L\\right)^2 \\sigma_{E_L}^2 + 2 \\left(g_L\\right) \\left(-g_L\\right) \\text{Cov}(V_{\\text{th}}, E_L)$$\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}^2 \\approx g_L^2 \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 + g_L^2 \\sigma_{E_L}^2 - 2 g_L^2 \\text{Cov}(V_{\\text{th}}, E_L)$$\nSubstituting $\\text{Cov}(V_{\\text{th}}, E_L) = \\rho \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} \\sigma_{E_L}$ and factoring out $g_L^2$:\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}^2 \\approx g_L^2 \\left( \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 + \\sigma_{E_L}^2 - 2 \\rho \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} \\sigma_{E_L} \\right)$$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}$ is the square root of the variance. Since $g_L$ as a conductance must be non-negative:\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}} \\approx g_L \\sqrt{\\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 + \\sigma_{E_L}^2 - 2 \\rho \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} \\sigma_{E_L}}$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values. To ensure dimensional consistency, we will convert all values to base SI units (S, V).\n- $g_L = 12\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n- $\\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\sigma_{E_L} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\rho = 0.30$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 = (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})^2 = 0.64 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2$$\n$$\\sigma_{E_L}^2 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})^2 = 1.44 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2$$\n$$2 \\rho \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} \\sigma_{E_L} = 2 \\times 0.30 \\times (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 0.576 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is:\n$$(\\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}}^2 + \\sigma_{E_L}^2 - 2 \\rho \\sigma_{V_{\\text{th}}} \\sigma_{E_L}) = (0.64 + 1.44 - 0.576) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2 = 1.504 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2$$\nNow, we take the square root of this value:\n$$\\sqrt{1.504 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V}^2} = \\sqrt{1.504} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 1.22637675 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nFinally, we multiply by $g_L$ to find $\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}} \\approx (12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (1.22637675 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})$$\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}} \\approx 14.716521 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nThe question asks for the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}} \\approx 14.716521\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\sigma_{I_{\\text{rh}}} \\approx 14.72\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$",

The autocorrelation function of the input fluctuations is defined as $C_{I}(\\tau) = \\langle X(t) X(t+\\tau) \\rangle$.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Autocorrelation Function $C_{I}(\\tau)$\n\nTo find $C_{I}(\\tau)$, we first need to solve the SDE for $X(t)$. This is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation, which can be solved using an integrating factor, $\\exp(t/\\tau_c)$.\nMultiplying the SDE by the integrating factor gives:\n$$\n\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg) \\frac{dX(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_c}\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg) X(t) = \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\xi(t)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg[X(t)\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\bigg] = \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\xi(t)\n$$\nIntegrating this equation from some initial time $t_0$ to a later time $t$ yields:\n$$\nX(t)\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\bigg) - X(t_0)\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{t_0}{\\tau_c}\\bigg) = \\sqrt{2D} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\exp\\bigg(\\frac{s}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\xi(s)\\,ds\n$$\nSolving for $X(t)$:\n$$\nX(t) = X(t_0)\\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{t-t_0}{\\tau_c}\\bigg) + \\sqrt{2D} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\xi(s)\\,ds\n$$\nSince the process $X(t)$ is stated to be stationary, its statistical properties do not change over time. This implies that the process has been running for an infinitely long time. We can thus take the limit $t_0 \\to -\\infty$. In this limit, the first term vanishes (as $\\tau_c  0$), and we obtain the formal solution for the stationary process:\n$$\nX(t) = \\sqrt{2D} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\\xi(s)\\,ds\n$$\nNow, we can compute the autocorrelation function $C_{I}(\\tau) = \\langle X(t) X(t+\\tau) \\rangle$.

The Dirac delta function $\\delta(s_1-s_2)$ is non-zero only when $s_2=s_1$. The integral over $s_2$ collapses, and we replace $s_2$ with $s_1$.

For a stationary process, the autocorrelation function must be an even function of $\\tau$, i.e., $C_{I}(\\tau) = C_{I}(-\\tau)$. Therefore, for any real $\\tau$, we can write the result using the absolute value:\n$$\nC_{I}(\\tau) = D\\tau_c \\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{|\\tau|}{\\tau_c}\\bigg)\n$$\nThe variance of the input fluctuations is given by $\\sigma_I^2 = C_I(0) = D\\tau_c$.\n\n### Part 2: Qualitative Effect on Firing Rate Variability\n\nThe problem asks to explain how the total area under the autocorrelation function, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{I}(\\tau)\\, d\\tau$, affects the variability of the neuron's output firing rate on long timescales.\n\nFirst, let's identify what this integral represents. According to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a stationary process, denoted $S_I(\\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function:\n$$\nS_I(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_I(\\tau) \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe value of the PSD at zero frequency, $S_I(0)$, is therefore equal to the total area under the autocorrelation function:\n$$\nS_I(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_I(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nPhysically, $S_I(0)$ quantifies the power of the fluctuations in the input current $I(t)$ at very low frequencies (i.e., on very long timescales). A larger value of $S_I(0)$ implies that the input current possesses stronger slow fluctuations.\n\nThe neuron is operating in the fluctuation-driven regime, where its mean input $\\mu$ is subthreshold. Spikes are triggered by the noisy fluctuations $X(t)$. In this regime, the output firing rate is highly sensitive to changes in the input statistics, particularly the mean current. The relationship between the mean input current and the steady-state firing rate is described by the neuron's frequency-current ($f$-$I$) curve.\n\nA first-principles argument based on linear response is as follows: Slow fluctuations in the input current $I(t)$ (i.e., the components near zero frequency) can be viewed as a slowly varying \"mean\" input to the neuron. Since the neuron's firing rate is a function of this input, these slow input fluctuations will be transduced into slow modulations of the neuron's instantaneous output firing rate.\n\nThe magnitude of this effect is determined by the strength of the slow input fluctuations. A larger area under $C_I(\\tau)$ corresponds to a larger $S_I(0)$, meaning stronger slow fluctuations in the input current. These stronger slow fluctuations will, in turn, drive larger and slower modulations in the output firing rate.\n\nThe variability of the neuron's output spike train on long timescales is strongly influenced by such slow rate modulations. A process with a slowly varying rate will exhibit much greater variance in its spike count over a long time window compared to a process with the same average rate but no slow modulations (like a Poisson process). For example, a neuron that fires at a high rate for a long period and then a low rate for another long period will have a very high variance in the total number of spikes counted over both periods. This increased long-term variability is often quantified by a Fano factor (variance of spike counts divided by the mean) greater than $1$.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative conclusion is that a larger total area under the input autocorrelation function, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{I}(\\tau)\\, d\\tau$, leads to stronger slow fluctuations in the input current. These are transduced by the neuron into larger slow modulations of its output firing rate, which in turn results in **higher variability** of the neuron's output spike train on long timescales.",

The dynamics of the membrane potential $V(t)$ are given by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:\n$$\ndV(t) = \\left[-\\frac{V(t)-V_{\\mathrm{L}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} + \\mu \\right] dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using the effective fixed point $V_{\\infty} \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{L}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mu$ as:\n$$\ndV(t) = -\\frac{V(t) - V_{\\infty}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t\n$$\nAn interspike interval, $T$, is the first-passage time of $V(t)$ from the reset potential $V_{\\mathrm{r}}$ to the threshold potential $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The coefficient of variation is defined as $\\mathrm{CV} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[T]}/\\mathbb{E}[T]$. We will derive its leading-order expression for small noise amplitude $\\sigma$.\n\n**1. Derivation for the Mean-Driven Regime ($V_{\\infty}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$)**\n\nIn the mean-driven regime, the deterministic component of the input is sufficient to drive the neuron to threshold. For small noise, the firing time will be a small perturbation around the deterministic firing time.\n\nFirst, we calculate the deterministic interspike interval, $T_0$, by setting $\\sigma=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_0}{dt} = -\\frac{V_0(t) - V_{\\infty}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\nWith the initial condition $V_0(0) = V_{\\mathrm{r}}$, the solution is:\n$$\nV_0(t) = V_{\\infty} + (V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\infty}) \\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})\n$$\nThe time $T_0$ is found by setting $V_0(T_0) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{th}} = V_{\\infty} + (V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\infty}) \\exp(-T_0/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})\n$$\nSince $V_{\\infty}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}  V_{\\mathrm{r}}$, we can solve for $T_0$:\n$$\nT_0 = \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\infty}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\infty}}\\right) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}}}{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)\n$$\nFor small $\\sigma$, the mean ISI is approximated by the deterministic ISI, $\\mathbb{E}[T] \\approx T_0$.\n\nNext, we find the variance of the ISI, $\\mathrm{Var}[T]$. For small noise, the fluctuations in the passage time, $\\delta T = T - T_0$, are linearly related to the fluctuations in the membrane potential, $\\delta V$, at time $T_0$. The relationship is $\\delta T \\approx -\\delta V(T_0) / \\dot{V}_0(T_0)$, where $\\dot{V}_0(T_0)$ is the rate of change of the deterministic trajectory at the threshold crossing. The variance of the timing is thus:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[T] \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[V(T_0)]}{(\\dot{V}_0(T_0))^2}\n$$\nThe derivative of the deterministic trajectory is $\\dot{V}_0(t) = (V_{\\infty} - V_0(t))/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. At $t=T_0$, we have $V_0(T_0) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, so:\n$$\n\\dot{V}_0(T_0) = \\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\nThe variance of the membrane potential of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting at a fixed point $V_r$ at time $t=0$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t)] = \\sigma^2 \\int_0^t \\exp(-2(t-s)/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) ds = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\left[1 - \\exp(-2t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})\\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate this at $t=T_0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(T_0)] = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\left[1 - \\exp(-2T_0/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})\\right]\n$$\nFrom the expression for $T_0$, we have $\\exp(-T_0/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) = (V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})/(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})$. Substituting this in, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(T_0)] = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)^2\\right] = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\frac{(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})^2 - (V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})^2}{(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})^2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(2V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})}{(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})^2}\n$$\nNow we can compute the variance of the ISI:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[T] \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{2} \\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(2V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})}{(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})^2}}{\\left(\\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}^3 (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(2V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})}{2 (V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})^2 (V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})^2}\n$$\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[T]} / \\mathbb{E}[T] \\approx \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[T]} / T_0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{mean-driven}} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}^{3/2} \\sqrt{(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(2V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})}}{\\sqrt{2} (V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})} \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}}}{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying, we obtain the leading-order expression for the CV in the mean-driven regime:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{mean-driven}} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(2V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})}}{(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}})(V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{r}}}{V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)}\n$$\nNote that the CV scales linearly with the noise amplitude $\\sigma$. As $\\sigma \\to 0$, the CV goes to $0$, corresponding to perfectly regular firing.\n\n**2. Derivation for the Fluctuation-Driven Regime ($V_{\\infty}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$)**\n\nIn the fluctuation-driven regime, the deterministic trajectory starting from $V_{\\mathrm{r}}$ approaches $V_{\\infty}$ and never reaches the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Firing is a noise-induced event, which can be modeled as a stochastic escape over a potential barrier.\n\nThe dynamics can be viewed as the motion of a particle in a potential $U(V)$. The drift term $F(V) = -(V-V_\\infty)/\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$ defines an effective potential $U(V)$ via $F(V) = -dU/dV$. This gives a quadratic potential $U(V) = (V-V_\\infty)^2/(2\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})$ with a minimum at $V=V_\\infty$. The problem is thus an escape from the potential well at $V_\\infty$ over a barrier at $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nFor small noise amplitude $\\sigma$, the escape is a rare event. The mean first-passage time, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$, is dominated by the time spent waiting for a large, favorable fluctuation to carry the potential across the barrier. According to Kramers' escape theory, this mean time is exponentially large in the barrier height scaled by the noise intensity:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\infty})^2}{\\sigma^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)\n$$\nAfter a spike and reset to $V_{\\mathrm{r}}$, the membrane potential relaxes back towards the stable fixed point $V_\\infty$ on a time scale of order $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. For small $\\sigma$, the mean escape time $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ is much larger than the relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This separation of time scales implies that the system loses all memory of the previous spike event (i.e., its reset to $V_r$) long before the next escape event is likely to occur.\n\nBecause the escape events are rare and independent of the system's history, the sequence of spike times constitutes a renewal process that is approximately a Poisson process. The interspike interval distribution $p(T)$ for a Poisson process is an exponential distribution:\n$$\np(T) \\approx r \\exp(-rT)\n$$\nwhere $r = 1/\\mathbb{E}[T]$ is the mean firing rate.\nFor a random variable $T$ following an exponential distribution, the moments are well-known. The mean is $\\mathbb{E}[T] = 1/r$ and the variance is $\\mathrm{Var}[T] = 1/r^2$.\nThe coefficient of variation is then calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[T]}}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/r^2}}{1/r} = \\frac{1/r}{1/r} = 1\n$$\nThis result is the leading-order term in an expansion in small $\\sigma$. Corrections to this result, which would introduce a dependence on the model parameters, are of higher order in $\\sigma$ and become negligible as $\\sigma \\to 0$. Therefore, to leading order, the CV in the fluctuation-driven regime is unity.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{fluctuation-driven}} \\approx 1\n$$\nThis indicates that the firing is highly irregular, characteristic of a Poisson-like random process.",
