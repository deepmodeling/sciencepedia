            "solution": "The problem is evaluated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the expression for the vesicle release rate, $R$, as a function of the free calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. Second, we use this expression to compute a specific fold-change in the rate.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $R([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}])$**\n\nThe vesicle release rate, $R$, is stated to be proportional to the fraction of sensor proteins in the fully occupied state, $S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}$. Let this fraction be denoted by $\\theta$.\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[S]_{T}} $$\nwhere $[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]$ is the concentration of the occupied sensor complex and $[S]_{T}$ is the total concentration of the sensor protein. The relationship between $R$ and $\\theta$ is therefore $R = c \\cdot \\theta$ for some constant of proportionality $c$.\n\nWe are given that the release rate saturates at a maximal value, $R_{\\max}$, when all sensors are fully occupied. This condition corresponds to $[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}] = [S]_{T}$, which implies $\\theta=1$. Substituting this into the proportionality gives $R_{\\max} = c \\cdot 1$, which establishes the constant of proportionality as $c = R_{\\max}$. The release rate can thus be written as:\n$$ R([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = R_{\\max} \\theta = R_{\\max} \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[S]_{T}} $$\nThe total sensor concentration is given by the conservation law:\n$$ [S]_{T} = [S] + [S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}] $$\nwhere $[S]$ is the concentration of the free (unbound) sensor protein.\n\nThe binding reaction $S + n\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}$ is assumed to be at rapid equilibrium. The law of mass action for this reaction is described by the effective equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{n}$:\n$$ K_{n} = \\frac{[S]\\,[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}}{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of free sensor, $[S]$, in terms of the other concentrations:\n$$ [S] = K_{n} \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the conservation equation for $[S]_{T}$:\n$$ [S]_{T} = \\left( K_{n} \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} \\right) + [S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}] $$\nFactoring out $[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]$ from the right-hand side yields:\n$$ [S]_{T} = [S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}] \\left( \\frac{K_{n}}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} + 1 \\right) $$\nWe are interested in the fraction $\\theta = \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[S]_{T}}$. Rearranging the above equation gives:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[S\\mathrm{Ca}_{n}]}{[S]_{T}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{n}}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} + 1} $$\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}}{K_{n} + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\theta$ back into the equation for the release rate $R$:\n$$ R([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = R_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}}{K_{n} + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} $$\nThe problem defines a constant $K$ with units of concentration such that $K^{n} = K_{n}$. Making this final substitution, we arrive at the desired expression for $R([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}])$:\n$$ R([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = R_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}}{K^{n} + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}} $$\nThis functional form is commonly known as the Hill equation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the fold-change $\\mathcal{F}$**\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change $\\mathcal{F}$ in release rate when $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ increases from a concentration of $c_1 = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $c_2 = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The specifics given are $n=4$ and $K=20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The fold-change is defined as the ratio:\n$$ \\mathcal{F} = \\frac{R(c_2)}{R(c_1)} = \\frac{R(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})} $$\nFirst, we evaluate the release rate $R(c_1)$ at $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = c_1 = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Using the derived expression with $n=4$ and $K=20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$ R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = R_{\\max} \\frac{(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}}{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} + (10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}} $$\nWe can factor out $(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}$ from the terms in the denominator. Noting that $(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} = (2 \\times 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} = 2^{4}(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} = 16(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}$, we have:\n$$ R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = R_{\\max} \\frac{(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}}{16(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} + (10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}} = R_{\\max} \\frac{(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}}{(16+1)(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}} = \\frac{R_{\\max}}{17} $$\nNext, we evaluate the release rate $R(c_2)$ at $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = c_2 = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Since $c_2 = K$, we are evaluating the rate at the half-maximal concentration:\n$$ R(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = R_{\\max} \\frac{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}}{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4} + (20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}} = R_{\\max} \\frac{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}}{2(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{4}} = \\frac{R_{\\max}}{2} $$\nThis result confirms the consistency of the definition of $K$ as the concentration yielding a half-maximal rate.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change $\\mathcal{F}$ by taking the ratio of these two rates:\n$$ \\mathcal{F} = \\frac{R(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{R(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{R_{\\max}/2}{R_{\\max}/17} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{17}{1} = \\frac{17}{2} $$\nThe exact dimensionless value of the fold-change is $8.5$.",

It is a standard, non-trivial problem in quantitative neuroscience.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Mean and Variance of PSC\nWe derive expressions for the mean $\\mathbb{E}[I]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(I)$ using the laws of total expectation and total variance, respectively. The total PSC is a random sum $I = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} Q_{i}$.\n\n**Mean $\\mathbb{E}[I]$**\nThe law of total expectation states that $\\mathbb{E}[I] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[I|K]]$.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation of $I$ given the number of released vesicles $K=k$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[I|K=k] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\mathbb{E}[Q_{i}]\n$$\nSince the $Q_i$ are i.i.d. with mean $q$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[I|K=k] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} q = kq\n$$\nThis holds for any given $k$, so we can write the conditional expectation as a function of the random variable $K$: $\\mathbb{E}[I|K] = Kq$.\nNow, we take the expectation over $K$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[I] = \\mathbb{E}[Kq] = q\\mathbb{E}[K]\n$$\nSince $K \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N,p)$, its mean is $\\mathbb{E}[K] = Np$. Therefore, the mean PSC is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[I] = Npq\n$$\n\n**Variance $\\mathrm{Var}(I)$**\nThe law of total variance states that $\\mathrm{Var}(I) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(I|K)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[I|K])$.\nWe compute each term separately.\n1.  The first term is the expectation of the conditional variance. Given $K=k$, the variance of $I$ is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(I|K=k) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i}\\right)\n    $$\n    Since the $Q_i$ are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(I|K=k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\mathrm{Var}(Q_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{q}^{2} = k\\sigma_{q}^{2}\n    $$\n    As a function of the random variable $K$, we have $\\mathrm{Var}(I|K) = K\\sigma_{q}^{2}$.\n    Taking the expectation over $K$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(I|K)] = \\mathbb{E}[K\\sigma_{q}^{2}] = \\sigma_{q}^{2}\\mathbb{E}[K] = Np\\sigma_{q}^{2}\n    $$\n2.  The second term is the variance of the conditional expectation. We already found that $\\mathbb{E}[I|K] = Kq$. Its variance is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[I|K]) = \\mathrm{Var}(Kq) = q^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(K)\n    $$\n    Since $K \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N,p)$, its variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(K) = Np(1-p)$. Thus:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[I|K]) = q^{2}Np(1-p)\n    $$\nCombining both terms, the total variance of the PSC is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(I) = Np\\sigma_{q}^{2} + Np(1-p)q^{2}\n$$\n\n### Estimation of $N$ and $p$ without Quantal Variability ($\\sigma_{q}^{2}=0$)\nWhen there is no variability in the quantal size, $\\sigma_{q}^{2}=0$. The equations simplify to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[I] = Npq\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(I) = Np(1-p)q^{2}\n$$\nWe are given the measurements $m = \\mathbb{E}[I] = 100$, $s^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(I) = 1200$, and $q = 20$.\nFrom the mean equation:\n$$\n100 = Np \\times 20 \\implies Np = \\frac{100}{20} = 5\n$$\nFrom the variance equation:\n$$\n1200 = Np(1-p) \\times 20^{2} = Np(1-p) \\times 400\n$$\nSubstituting $Np=5$ into the variance equation:\n$$\n1200 = 5(1-p) \\times 400 = 2000(1-p)\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n1-p = \\frac{1200}{2000} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\n$$\np = 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\nNow we find $N$ using $Np=5$:\n$$\nN \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 5 \\implies N = 5 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}\n$$\nSo, for the case with no quantal variability, the estimates are $p = 2/5$ and $N = 25/2$. Note that $N$ is not an integer, which is common in such estimations, reflecting that the model is an approximation of a more complex biological reality.\n\n### Identifiability Analysis with Quantal Variability ($\\sigma_{q}^{2} \\geq 0$)\nNow we consider the general case where $\\sigma_{q}^{2}$ is an unknown non-negative parameter. The governing equations are:\n$$\nm = Npq\n$$\n$$\ns^{2} = Np\\sigma_{q}^{2} + Np(1-p)q^{2}\n$$\nUsing the measurements $m=100$, $s^2=1200$, and $q=20$:\nThe mean equation gives, as before, $Np = 5$.\nSubstituting $Np=5$ and $q=20$ into the variance equation:\n$$\n1200 = 5\\sigma_{q}^{2} + 5(1-p) \\times 20^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1200 = 5\\sigma_{q}^{2} + 2000(1-p)\n$$\nWe need to express $p$ and $N$ as functions of $\\sigma_{q}^{2}$. From the equation above, we solve for $p$:\n$$\n2000(1-p) = 1200 - 5\\sigma_{q}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1-p = \\frac{1200 - 5\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{2000} = \\frac{1200}{2000} - \\frac{5\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{2000} = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400}\n$$\n$$\np(\\sigma_{q}^{2}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400}\\right) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400}\n$$\nNow, we express $N$ as a function of $\\sigma_{q}^{2}$ using $Np=5$:\n$$\nN(\\sigma_{q}^{2}) = \\frac{5}{p(\\sigma_{q}^{2})} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400}}\n$$\nTo simplify the expression, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nN(\\sigma_{q}^{2}) = \\frac{5}{\\frac{160 + \\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400}} = \\frac{5 \\times 400}{160 + \\sigma_{q}^{2}} = \\frac{2000}{160 + \\sigma_{q}^{2}}\n$$\nThese expressions for $p(\\sigma_{q}^{2})$ and $N(\\sigma_{q}^{2})$ show that there is no unique solution for $(N, p)$ from the first two moments of the PSC distribution alone if $\\sigma_q^2$ is unknown. This is the problem of identifiability.\n\n### Admissibility Constraints\nThe parameters must satisfy basic probabilistic bounds: $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$ and $\\sigma_{q}^{2} \\geq 0$.\nThe condition $\\sigma_{q}^{2} \\geq 0$ is given. With this, $p(\\sigma_{q}^{2}) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400} \\geq \\frac{2}{5}$. This satisfies $p \\geq 0$.\nThe upper bound on $p$ imposes a constraint on $\\sigma_{q}^{2}$:\n$$\np(\\sigma_{q}^{2}) \\leq 1 \\implies \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400} \\leq 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{400} \\leq 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{q}^{2} \\leq \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = 3 \\times 80 = 240\n$$\nThus, for the model to be probabilistically consistent, the quantal variance must be in the range $0 \\leq \\sigma_{q}^{2} \\leq 240$. The functions for $p$ and $N$ are valid over this domain for $\\sigma_q^2$. For $N$, since $\\sigma_q^2 \\geq 0$, the denominator $160 + \\sigma_q^2$ is always positive, so $N > 0$ is always satisfied.\n\nThe final answer requires four expressions in a single row matrix.",

Because the opening duration is much longer than diffusion time, peak $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ at the sensor is independent of $r$, so the release mode does not change.\nD.

The problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of $c(r)$ and Justification of Quasi-Steady State**\n\nThe provided equation for the calcium concentration, $c(r)$, is a solution to the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation in three dimensions for a point source in a medium with linear buffering. The general form of this equation is $D_{eff} \\nabla^2 c - k_{off}' c = -\\Phi_{eff} \\delta(\\mathbf{r})$, where the effective parameters account for buffering. The solution to this screened Poisson (or Helmholtz) equation is a Yukawa potential, which has the form $c(r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r} e^{-r/\\lambda}$. The given equation,\n$$\nc(r) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\Phi}{4\\pi D\\,r\\,(1+\\kappa)}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right) \\;+\\; c_{\\mathrm{rest}},\n$$\nis a standard model (e.g., Smith model) where the effect of fast, mobile buffers is partitioned into scaling the source strength by a factor of $1/(1+\\kappa)$ and introducing a screening length $\\lambda$ related to buffer kinetics and concentration. The term $1+\\kappa$ reflects the ratio of total to free calcium at equilibrium.\n\nThe quasi-steady state approximation assumes that the concentration profile around the channel reaches its steady state on a timescale much shorter than the channel opening time, $T_{\\mathrm{open}}$.

This option states that increasing $r$ from $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ lowers peak $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ from approximately $94\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Our calculations yield $93.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $7.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, which is an excellent match.

It claims asynchronous release probability remains on the order of a few percent. Our calculations show it goes from $8.8\\%$ to $4.0\\%$, which fits this description.

This is a clear shift. All claims in this option are quantitatively supported by our derivation. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option incorrectly claims that $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ decays with $1/r^2$. The model equation is $c(r) \\propto (1/r)\\exp(-r/\\lambda)$. It incorrectly claims that $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ at $80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ remains above $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (our result is $7.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and that synchronous release is largely unaffected (it drops by a factor of over $700$). **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option incorrectly reasons that because the system reaches steady state quickly, the peak concentration is independent of $r$. The steady-state concentration itself is a strong function of $r$, as shown by the model equation and our calculations. The conclusion that the release mode does not change is consequently also false. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option claims that increasing $r$ *increases* synchronous release.

This option claims the peak $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ at $80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is below $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Our calculation shows it is approximately $7.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The premise is false. Consequently, the conclusion that both release modes are shut off is based on a false premise (and our calculation shows asynchronous release remains at $4\\%$). **Incorrect**.",
