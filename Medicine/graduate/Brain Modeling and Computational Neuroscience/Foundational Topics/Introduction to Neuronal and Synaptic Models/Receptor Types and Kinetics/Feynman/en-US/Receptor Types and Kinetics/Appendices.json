            "problem": "You voltage-clamp a cultured hippocampal neuron that expresses both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).

            "solution": "The user has requested an analysis of a problem in neurophysiology. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** A voltage-clamped cultured hippocampal neuron.\n- **Expressed Receptors:** alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).\n- **Extracellular Solution:** Contains tetrodotoxin (TTX), tetraethylammonium (TEA), and physiological magnesium at a concentration of $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_\\text{out} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- **Stimulus:** A rapid glutamate pulse with a duration of $1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ applied via photolysis.\n- **Experimental Parameters:**\n    - Holding potential ($V_h$) can be set to $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ or $+40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    - Available antagonists: AMPAR antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and NMDAR antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV).\n- **Recording Convention:** Inward currents are plotted downward.\n- **Core Task:** Based on first principles (nonselective cation channel reversal potentials, Ohm’s law, voltage-dependent magnesium block of NMDARs), select the single option that correctly describes:\n    1. A scientifically consistent isolation protocol.\n    2. The resulting current time courses at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    3. The qualitative current–voltage ($I$–$V$) relationships for each receptor.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental, universally accepted principles of synaptic neurophysiology. The experimental setup (voltage clamp, use of TTX and TEA to block intrinsic voltage-gated channels, glutamate uncaging), the specific receptor types (AMPAR, NMDAR), the pharmacological agents (CNQX, D-APV), the physiological concentrations ($[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_\\text{out} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), and the key biophysical phenomena (receptor kinetics, reversal potential, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block) are all standard and factually correct elements of the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary information to deduce the expected experimental outcomes and evaluate the provided options. A unique, stable solution based on established biophysical models is expected to exist.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in cellular neuroscience that tests the understanding of fundamental principles of synaptic transmission. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation from First Principles\n\n1.  **Reversal Potential ($E_\\text{rev}$):** Both AMPARs and NMDARs are non-selective cation channels, permeable to $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$. NMDARs also have significant permeability to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. In typical physiological ionic gradients, the reversal potential for both receptor types is approximately $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    $E_\\text{rev} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n2.  **Ohm's Law and Driving Force:** The current ($I$) through a population of channels is given by $I = G(V_m - E_\\text{rev})$, where $G$ is the total conductance and $(V_m - E_\\text{rev})$ is the driving force.\n    -   At $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force is $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This drives an inward current (cation influx), which is plotted downward.\n    -   At $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force is $+40\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This drives an outward current (cation efflux).\n\n3.  **Receptor Kinetics:**\n    -   **AMPARs:** Have fast activation and deactivation kinetics. Following a brief glutamate pulse, they produce a current with a rapid rise and a rapid decay. This is the \"fast component\" of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).\n    -   **NMDARs:** Have slower activation and much slower deactivation kinetics. They produce a current with a slower rise time and a prolonged decay, lasting hundreds of milliseconds. This is the \"slow component\" of the EPSC.\n\n4.  **Voltage-Dependent $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ Block of NMDARs:**\n    -   At negative membrane potentials (e.g., $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions are driven by the electric field into the NMDAR pore, occluding it. This block is very effective at physiological $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_\\text{out} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. Consequently, the NMDAR conductance ($G_\\text{NMDAR}$) is nearly zero at hyperpolarized potentials, regardless of glutamate binding.\n    -   At positive (depolarized) membrane potentials (e.g., $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the electrostatic repulsion expels the $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ion from the pore, relieving the block and allowing ion flow.\n\n5.  **Predicted $I$–$V$ Relationships:**\n    -   **AMPAR $I$–$V$:** The conductance ($G_\\text{AMPAR}$) is largely voltage-independent. Therefore, the $I$–$V$ curve is approximately linear, following $I_\\text{AMPAR} = G_\\text{AMPAR}(V_m - E_\\text{rev})$, and crossing the voltage axis at $E_\\text{rev} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    -   **NMDAR $I$–$V$ (with $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$):** The conductance ($G_\\text{NMDAR}$) is strongly voltage-dependent. At negative potentials, $G_\\text{NMDAR} \\approx 0$ due to $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block, so the current is minimal. As the potential becomes less negative, the block is relieved and $G_\\text{NMDAR}$ increases. This competition between increasing conductance and decreasing driving force (as $V_m$ approaches $E_\\text{rev}$) creates a region of negative slope conductance. At positive potentials, the block is fully relieved and the curve behaves more linearly. The overall shape is a characteristic \"J-shape\", with negligible inward current at negative potentials and a large outward current at positive potentials. The reversal potential remains near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n6.  **Pharmacological Isolation:**\n    -   To isolate AMPAR current, one must block NMDARs using their selective antagonist, D-APV.\n    -   To isolate NMDAR current, one must block AMPARs using their selective antagonist, CNQX.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Protocol: First record at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ in control, then add D-APV to isolate AMPAR current at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Next, switch to $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and add CNQX to isolate NMDAR current. Time courses: At $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the control trace is dominated by a rapid inward peak with minimal slow tail; with D-APV only the fast inward component remains. At $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ with CNQX, the isolated NMDAR current is a slow outward current. $I$–$V$: AMPAR shows an approximately linear $I$–$V$ with reversal near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$; NMDAR shows a J-shaped $I$–$V$ with reduced conductance (apparent negative slope region) at negative potentials due to magnesium block, and reversal near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.**\n- **Protocol:** The protocol is logical and effective. At $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the NMDAR current is already minimal due to $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block, so the control current is mostly AMPAR. Adding D-APV formally isolates the AMPAR current. At $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, both channels are active, so applying CNQX is the standard method to block the AMPAR component and isolate the NMDAR current. This is correct.\n- **Time courses:** At $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the current is inward. Due to $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block of the slow NMDAR component, the total current is dominated by the fast AMPAR component. This description is correct. Adding D-APV removes the negligible NMDAR component, leaving the fast component, which is also correct. At $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the current is outward. With CNQX isolating the NMDAR, the current will reflect the slow kinetics of NMDARs. So, a \"slow outward current\" is the correct description. This is correct.\n- **$I$–$V$:** The description of the AMPAR $I$–$V$ as linear with reversal near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is correct. The description of the NMDAR $I$–$V$ as \"J-shaped\" due to voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block, exhibiting a negative slope region and reversing near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, is the canonical textbook description. This is correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. All parts of this option are scientifically accurate.\n\n**B. Protocol: First record at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ in control, then add CNQX to isolate AMPAR current at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. ...**\n- **Protocol:** This is fundamentally flawed. CNQX is an AMPAR antagonist; adding it *blocks* the AMPAR current, it does not isolate it. This protocol would isolate the NMDAR current (which is negligible at this potential).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The protocol description contains a critical error.\n\n**C. Protocol: Replace external magnesium with $0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ magnesium to eliminate NMDAR voltage dependence, hold at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to isolate NMDAR and at $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to isolate AMPAR, without antagonists.**\n- **Protocol:** This protocol is flawed. Removing $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ makes both receptors active at all potentials. It is impossible to isolate one receptor current from the other by simply changing the holding potential; both will be active at $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $+40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Pharmacological antagonists would still be required.\n- **Time courses:** The description \"NMDAR is fast\" and \"AMPAR is slow\" is a direct reversal of their known kinetic properties.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The protocol is invalid and the kinetic descriptions are wrong.\n\n**D. Protocol: Hold at $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ in control, then add D-APV to isolate AMPAR at $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. ... Time courses: At $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the control trace is dominated by a fast outward current; with D-APV the slow component remains.**\n- **Time courses:** The description of the effect of D-APV is incorrect. D-APV blocks the NMDAR, which is the *slow component*. Therefore, after applying D-APV, the *fast component* (AMPAR) would remain, not the slow one.\n- **$I$–$V$:** The statement that \"AMPAR exhibits strong inward rectification due to extracellular magnesium\" is incorrect; AMPARs are not blocked by extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. The statement that \"NMDAR is linear\" is also incorrect; it is famously non-linear in the presence of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The description of pharmacology and the $I$–$V$ relationships are factually wrong.\n\n**E. Protocol: First record at $V_h = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and apply D-APV to isolate NMDAR, then at $V_h = +40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ apply CNQX to isolate AMPAR.**\n- **Protocol:** The protocol description is internally contradictory. D-APV is an NMDAR antagonist; it cannot be used to isolate NMDARs. CNQX is an AMPAR antagonist; it cannot be used to isolate AMPARs.\n- **$I$–$V$:** The description of the NMDAR $I$–$V$ as an \"inverted J-shape\" with \"enhanced current at negative potentials\" is the opposite of reality. The description of the AMPAR reversal potential as being near $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is also incorrect; it is near $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The pharmacology and the biophysical descriptions are fundamentally flawed.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes a valid experimental protocol and correctly predicts all associated outcomes based on established first principles.",

            "problem": "An ionotropic receptor with a single orthosteric binding site responds to an agonist through rapid equilibrium binding.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of receptor pharmacology, self-contained with all necessary parameters and assumptions, and well-posed, asking for a unique and derivable solution. The problem will be solved in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Agonist Concentration-Response in the Presence of a Competitive Antagonist\n\nThe agonist concentration-response relationship in the absence of an antagonist is given by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$\n\\frac{E([A])}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{[A]^{n_{H}}}{[A]^{n_{H}} + EC_{50}^{n_{H}}}\n$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the agonist concentration, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal response, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of agonist that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal response, and $n_{H}$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nA competitive antagonist, $[B]$, binds to the same orthosteric site as the agonist, $[A]$. We assume simple, mutually exclusive binding governed by the law of mass action. Let $R$ be the free receptor, $RA$ be the agonist-bound receptor, and $RB$ be the antagonist-bound receptor. The dissociation constants are $K_A$ for the agonist and $K_i$ for the antagonist.\nThe fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist, $p_A$, is given by:\n$$\np_A = \\frac{[RA]}{[R] + [RA] + [RB]}\n$$\nUsing the definitions of the dissociation constants, $K_A = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$ and $K_i = \\frac{[R][B]}{[RB]}$, we can write:\n$$\np_A = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_A}}{[R] + \\frac{[R][A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R][B]}{K_i}} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_A}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $K_A$ yields:\n$$\np_A = \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A] + K_A\\frac{[B]}{K_i}} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)}\n$$\nThis equation describes agonist occupancy for a system with a Hill coefficient of $n_H=1$. It shows that the presence of the antagonist increases the concentration of agonist required for half-maximal occupancy from $K_A$ to $K_A \\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)$. The factor $\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)$ is known as the dose ratio, $DR$.\n\nThe problem presents a phenomenological model where the response follows a Hill equation with $n_H \\neq 1$. The \"phenomenological step\" required to connect the mechanistic result of competitive antagonism with the Hill equation is based on the principle that a pure competitive antagonist does not alter the intrinsic properties of the agonist-receptor interaction, such as cooperativity ($n_H$) or maximal response ($E_{max}$). It only reduces the apparent affinity of the agonist by competing for binding sites. This competition can be overcome by increasing the agonist concentration. To achieve any given level of response (or receptor occupancy) in the presence of the antagonist, the agonist concentration must be increased by the factor $DR$.\n\nTherefore, the response at an agonist concentration $[A]$ in the presence of antagonist $[B]$ is equivalent to the response at a lower effective agonist concentration $[A]/DR$ in the absence of the antagonist. We substitute $[A]$ with $[A]/DR$ in the original Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$\n\\frac{E([A])}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{[A]}{DR}\\right)^{n_{H}}}{\\left(\\frac{[A]}{DR}\\right)^{n_{H}} + EC_{50}^{n_{H}}}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $DR^{n_{H}}$ gives the new concentration-response relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{E([A])}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{[A]^{n_{H}}}{[A]^{n_{H}} + (EC_{50} \\cdot DR)^{n_{H}}}\n$$\nThis equation is in the Hill-Langmuir form. By comparing it to the general form $\\frac{[A]^{n_{H,\\mathrm{app}}}}{[A]^{n_{H,\\mathrm{app}}} + (EC_{50}')^{n_{H,\\mathrm{app}}}}$, we can identify the new parameters:\nThe apparent Hill coefficient, $n_{H,\\mathrm{app}}([B])$, is unchanged:\n$$\nn_{H,\\mathrm{app}}([B]) = n_H\n$$\nThe effective $EC_{50}$ in the presence of antagonist, $EC_{50}'([B])$, is:\n$$\nEC_{50}'([B]) = EC_{50} \\cdot DR([B]) = EC_{50} \\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the given parameters: $EC_{50} = 1.80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $n_H = 1.50$, and $K_i = 300\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nCase 1: Antagonist concentration $[B] = 90.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\nFirst, calculate the dose ratio $DR$:\n$$\nDR(90.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) = 1 + \\frac{90.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{300\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = 1 + 0.3 = 1.3\n$$\nNow, calculate the shifted $EC_{50}'$:\n$$\nEC_{50}'(90.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) = 1.80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times 1.3 = 2.34\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe apparent Hill coefficient remains $n_{H,\\mathrm{app}} = 1.50$.\n\nCase 2: Antagonist concentration $[B] = 1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\nCalculate the dose ratio $DR$:\n$$\nDR(1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 1 + \\frac{1200\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{300\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = 1 + 4 = 5\n$$\nNow, calculate the shifted $EC_{50}'$:\n$$\nEC_{50}'(1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 1.80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times 5 = 9.00\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe apparent Hill coefficient again remains $n_{H,\\mathrm{app}} = 1.50$.\n\nRounding these results to four significant figures gives:\n$EC_{50}'(90.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}) = 2.340\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$EC_{50}'(1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 9.000\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$n_{H,\\mathrm{app}} = 1.500$.\n\nPart 2: Schild Equation and Estimation of $K_i$\n\nThe dose ratio is defined as $DR([B]) \\equiv \\frac{EC_{50}'([B])}{EC_{50}}$.\nFrom Part 1, we established that for a pure competitive antagonist producing parallel rightward shifts, $EC_{50}'([B]) = EC_{50} \\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $DR$ gives the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$\nDR([B]) = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\n$$\nTo derive the Schild equation, we rearrange this expression and take the logarithm. A base-$10$ logarithm is conventionally used for Schild analysis.\n$$\nDR([B]) - 1 = \\frac{[B]}{K_i}\n$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(DR([B]) - 1) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{K_i}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}(DR([B]) - 1) = \\log_{10}([B]) - \\log_{10}(K_i)\n$$\nThis is the Schild equation. It describes a linear relationship between $\\log_{10}(DR - 1)$ and $\\log_{10}([B])$. The expected slope of this line (a \"Schild plot\") is $1$.

This practice focuses on modeling receptor desensitization, a key mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity .

            "problem": "A population of ionotropic receptors mediating a fast excitatory postsynaptic current is modeled with three kinetic states: resting and available $R$, conducting (open) $O$, and desensitized $D$. The total fraction of receptors is conserved and normalized to $1$, so $R(t)+O(t)+D(t)=1$ for all $t$. Ligand binding and unbinding are governed by the law of mass action with on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and desensitization and recovery are first-order transitions with desensitization rate $k_{\\mathrm{d}}$ from $O$ to $D$ and recovery rate $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$ from $D$ to $R$. Consider a paired-pulse and train stimulation protocol in which the ligand is presented as square pulses of duration $T$ at concentration $[L]$, separated by ligand-free intervals of duration $\\Delta$. Assume the following regime, which is typical for ionotropic receptors relative to desensitization and metabotropic signaling: (i) during each ligand pulse, binding/unbinding equilibrate rapidly compared to desensitization and recovery, that is, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]+k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{d}},k_{\\mathrm{r}}$; (ii) between pulses, the ligand concentration is zero, and any residual $O$ decays to $R$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ that is large compared to $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$, so $O \\approx 0$ in the interpulse interval; (iii) the experimental readout is the peak open fraction during a pulse, which under the rapid-equilibrium approximation is proportional to the fraction of available receptors at that time multiplied by the occupancy probability $p=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]+k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the core definitions of chemical kinetics under the law of mass action, derive closed-form analytic expressions for two diagnostic quantities that are used to infer desensitization kinetics and occupancy saturation:\n\n1.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe kinetic scheme can be represented as:\n$$ R \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]}{\\rightleftharpoons}} O \\xrightarrow{k_d} D \\xrightarrow{k_r} R $$\nThe system is governed by the following set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), based on the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]R + k_{\\mathrm{off}}O + k_{\\mathrm{r}}D $$\n$$ \\frac{dO}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]R - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{d}})O $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{d}}O - k_{\\mathrm{r}}D $$\nsubject to the constraint $R(t)+O(t)+D(t)=1$.\n\n**Analysis of Dynamics During a Ligand Pulse**\nDuring a pulse of duration $T$, the ligand concentration is $[L]$.\nAssumption (i), $k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]+k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{d}},k_{\\mathrm{r}}$, implies that the binding and unbinding transitions between $R$ and $O$ are much faster than the desensitization and recovery processes. Thus, the $R \\leftrightarrow O$ reaction can be assumed to be in a quasi-equilibrium state. This means the fraction of open channels, $O$, maintains a constant proportion relative to the total number of available (non-desensitized) channels, $R+O$.\nThis proportion is the occupancy probability, $p$:\n$$ p = \\frac{O}{R+O} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L]+k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nFrom the conservation law, the pool of available receptors is $R+O = 1-D$.\nTherefore, during the pulse, the fraction of open channels is directly related to the fraction of desensitized channels:\n$$ O(t) = p(R(t)+O(t)) = p(1 - D(t)) $$\nSubstituting this into the ODE for $D$:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{d}}O - k_{\\mathrm{r}}D = k_{\\mathrm{d}}p(1-D) - k_{\\mathrm{r}}D $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{d}}p - (k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})D $$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ODE. Let $D(t_0)$ be the initial condition at the start of a pulse. The solution for $t \\ge t_0$ is:\n$$ D(t) = D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}} + (D(t_0) - D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}) \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})(t-t_0)) $$\nwhere the steady-state value during the pulse, $D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}$, is found by setting $\\frac{dD}{dt}=0$:\n$$ D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p}{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}}} $$\n\n**Analysis of Dynamics Between Pulses**\nBetween pulses, the ligand concentration is $[L]=0$ for a duration $\\Delta$.\nAssumption (ii) states that $O \\approx 0$ during this interval due to rapid unbinding ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is large). The kinetic scheme effectively simplifies to $D \\xrightarrow{k_r} R$.\nThe ODE for $D$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{d}}(0) - k_{\\mathrm{r}}D = -k_{\\mathrm{r}}D $$\nLet $D(t_1)$ be the initial condition at the start of an inter-pulse interval. The solution for $t \\ge t_1$ is a simple exponential decay:\n$$ D(t) = D(t_1) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}(t-t_1)) $$\n\n**1. Paired-Pulse Recovery Curve $\\mathcal{F}(\\Delta)$**\nWe consider two pulses. The first pulse starts at $t=0$ and ends at $t=T$. The second pulse starts at $t=T+\\Delta$. We assume the system is initially fully recovered, so at $t=0$, $R(0)=1$, $O(0)=0$, and $D(0)=0$.\n\n- **First Pulse:** The peak response occurs at the beginning of the pulse, $t=0^+$, before any desensitization has occurred. According to assumption (iii), this response, $A_1$, is proportional to $O(0^+) = p(1-D(0))$.\n$$ A_1 \\propto p(1-0) = p $$\nDuring this pulse, the fraction of desensitized receptors $D(t)$ evolves from $D(0)=0$. At the end of the pulse, $t=T$, the fraction is:\n$$ D(T) = D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p}{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) $$\n\n- **Inter-pulse Interval:** From $t=T$ to $t=T+\\Delta$, the system recovers. The fraction of desensitized receptors decays from $D(T)$. At the start of the second pulse, $t=T+\\Delta$, the fraction is:\n$$ D(T+\\Delta) = D(T) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\n\n- **Second Pulse:** The peak response of the second pulse, $A_2$, occurs at its start, $t=(T+\\Delta)^+$.\n$$ A_2 \\propto O((T+\\Delta)^+) = p(1 - D(T+\\Delta)) $$\n\n- **Recovery Curve $\\mathcal{F}(\\Delta)$:** The normalized amplitude ratio is:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}(\\Delta) = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{p(1 - D(T+\\Delta))}{p} = 1 - D(T+\\Delta) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D(T+\\Delta)$ and $D(T)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}(\\Delta) = 1 - D(T) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p}{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) \\right] \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\n\n**2. Steady-State Normalized Peak Amplitude $\\mathcal{S}$**\nWe consider an infinite train of pulses. Let $D_n$ be the fraction of desensitized receptors at the start of the $n$-th pulse.\n- **Evolution during pulse $n$ (duration $T$):** The fraction of desensitized receptors at the end of pulse $n$, denoted $D_n'$, is:\n$$ D_n' = D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}} + (D_n - D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}) \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T) $$\n- **Evolution during inter-pulse interval $n$ (duration $\\Delta$):** The fraction at the start of pulse $n+1$ is:\n$$ D_{n+1} = D_n' \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\nCombining these gives a map from $D_n$ to $D_{n+1}$:\n$$ D_{n+1} = \\left[ D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}} + (D_n - D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}) \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T) \\right] \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\nIn the steady state, $D_{n+1} = D_n = D_{ss}$. We solve for $D_{ss}$:\n$$ D_{ss} = \\left[ D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) + D_{ss}\\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T) \\right] \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\n$$ D_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T - k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta)) = D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta) $$\n$$ D_{ss} = \\frac{D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta)}{1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T - k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta)} $$\nSubstituting $D_{\\infty,\\text{pulse}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p}{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}}}$.\n\nThe quantity $\\mathcal{S}$ is the ratio of the steady-state peak response, $A_{ss}$, to the peak response of the first pulse, $A_1$. The peak response for the first pulse assumes $D_1=0$.\n$$ A_1 \\propto p(1-D_1) = p $$\nThe steady-state peak response is:\n$$ A_{ss} \\propto p(1-D_{ss}) $$\nThus, $\\mathcal{S} = \\frac{A_{ss}}{A_1} = 1 - D_{ss}$.\n$$ \\mathcal{S} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p}{k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}}}(1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T)) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta)}{1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{d}}p + k_{\\mathrm{r}})T - k_{\\mathrm{r}}\\Delta)} $$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified.
