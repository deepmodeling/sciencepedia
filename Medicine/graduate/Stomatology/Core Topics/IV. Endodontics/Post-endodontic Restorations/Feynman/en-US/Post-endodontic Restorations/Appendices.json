The radiographic root length, measured along the canal axis from the coronal reference plane to the radiographic apex, is $21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Clinical protocols accepted in post-endodontic restorations include the following well-tested rules:\n- Retention of a post increases with its embedded length; a widely accepted retention guideline is that the post length inside the root should be approximately two-thirds of the root length (the “two-thirds rule”).\n- A continuous apical sealing segment of gutta-percha (GP) of $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is to be preserved to maintain the endodontic seal.\n- Due to a mild apical curvature, a conservative $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ safety margin beyond the apical seal is required to avoid thinning and perforation risk during post space preparation.\n\nAssuming these constraints must be met simultaneously, determine the minimal post length inside the root that satisfies the two-thirds rule without violating the requirement to preserve the apical sealing segment and the curvature safety margin.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem from the field of stomatology, specifically concerning post-endodontic restorations. I will first validate the problem statement according to the specified criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Radiographic root length, $L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Post length guideline (the “two-thirds rule”): $L_{\\text{post}} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} L_{\\text{root}}$.\n- Apical sealing segment of gutta-percha to be preserved, $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Safety margin beyond the apical seal, $L_{\\text{safety}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The objective is to determine the minimal post length inside the root, $L_{\\text{post}}$, that satisfies the two-thirds rule while respecting the apical seal and safety margin constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is set within the context of dental science (endodontics). The \"two-thirds rule\" for post length and the preservation of a $4$-$5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical gutta-percha seal are well-established, evidence-based clinical guidelines for post-and-core restorations. The parameters and values given ($L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for a maxillary premolar, $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) are clinically realistic. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient data to determine a solution. The phrase \"approximately two-thirds\" is a clinical guideline, but the problem's request to find the length that \"satisfies the two-thirds rule\" formalizes this into a specific calculation for the purpose of the problem. We must calculate the value from this rule and then check its validity against the other constraints. This structure leads to a unique and stable solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and quantitative, free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n4.  **Consistency:** The constraints must be checked for mutual consistency.\n    - The length dictated by the two-thirds rule must be calculated.\n    - The maximum permissible post length, limited by the apical seal and safety margin, must also be calculated.\n    - If the length from the two-thirds rule is less than or equal to the maximum permissible length, the constraints are consistent and a solution exists.\n    - Let's perform a preliminary check: The length from the two-thirds rule is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The maximum allowed length is $21\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since $14\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the constraints are consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed with a formal solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the determination of a post length, $L_{\\text{post}}$, that adheres to multiple clinical constraints simultaneously. Let us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- Total radiographic root length: $L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Required length of apical gutta-percha seal: $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Required safety margin: $L_{\\text{safety}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nThe problem poses two primary conditions that $L_{\\text{post}}$ must meet.\n\n**Condition 1: The \"Two-Thirds Rule\" for Post Retention.**\nThis rule is a guideline for ensuring adequate post retention. The problem asks for the length that \"satisfies\" this rule, which we interpret as calculating the post length directly from this principle. Let this target length be $L_{\\text{rule}}$.\n$$L_{\\text{rule}} = \\frac{2}{3} L_{\\text{root}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $L_{\\text{root}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{rule}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThus, the length that satisfies the two-thirds rule is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Condition 2: Preservation of Apical Integrity.**\nTo maintain the integrity of the apical seal and avoid procedural errors like root perforation, a certain portion of the apical root structure must remain free of the post. This preserved length, $L_{\\text{apical}}$, is the sum of the gutta-percha seal and the safety margin.\n$$L_{\\text{apical}} = L_{\\text{GP}} + L_{\\text{safety}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{\\text{apical}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThis condition imposes an upper limit on the post length. The post cannot extend into this $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical zone. Therefore, the maximum allowable post length, $L_{\\text{max}}$, is the total root length minus this preserved apical length.\n$$L_{\\text{max}} = L_{\\text{root}} - L_{\\text{apical}}$$\n$$L_{\\text{max}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 6\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nSo, any post placed in this root must satisfy the inequality $L_{\\text{post}} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Synthesizing the Conditions.**\nThe problem asks for the minimal post length that satisfies the two-thirds rule without violating the other requirements.\n- The length that satisfies the two-thirds rule is $L_{\\text{rule}} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- We must verify if this length violates the apical integrity constraint, which stipulates that $L_{\\text{post}} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nComparing the two values, we find that $14\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This indicates that a post of length $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is manufacturable and will not compromise the required $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of apical structures.\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimal post length ... that satisfies the two-thirds rule\". The length that precisely satisfies this rule is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since this length is a valid one (it does not violate other constraints), it is the correct answer. The use of \"minimal\" in this context refers to the value specified by the rule itself, as opposed to a longer post which might also be biomechanically acceptable but would exceed the specific guideline.\n\nTherefore, the required post length is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.",

            "introduction": "The long-term success of an endodontically treated tooth often depends more on the quantity and quality of remaining coronal tooth structure than on the post itself. This practice uses a classic biomechanical model to quantify the dramatic increase in stress that occurs when vertical tooth structure, such as a marginal ridge, is lost.

In post-endodontic restorations, such a large stress amplification markedly elevates the risk of cusp fracture and microcrack propagation, especially given dentin’s anisotropy and fatigue behavior.

Model the post–dentin complex as two perfectly bonded, coaxial, isotropic, linear-elastic cylinders under small strain: an inner solid cylinder representing the post of radius $a$ and an outer hollow cylinder representing dentin with inner radius $a$ and outer radius $b$. Assume axisymmetry, perfect bonding at the interface $r=a$, and a traction-free outer root surface $r=b$ so that the radial stress at $r=b$ is zero. A purely axial compressive load $P$ is applied to the post only, producing a uniform axial stress in the post and no external radial loads.
