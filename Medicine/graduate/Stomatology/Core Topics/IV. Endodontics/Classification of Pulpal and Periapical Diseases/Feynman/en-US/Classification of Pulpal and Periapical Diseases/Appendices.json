This exercise challenges you to apply the precise definitions of the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) framework to a common clinical scenario involving a tooth that has already undergone partial endodontic therapy.

            "problem": "A patient presents with a maxillary premolar that has an intact temporary restoration with an open endodontic access. On clinical testing, the tooth does not respond to cold testing or Electric Pulp Test (EPT), is tender to percussion and palpation, and exhibits no swelling or sinus tract. Radiographic examination shows no root canal filling material in any canal and a well-defined periapical radiolucency at the apex. The referring dentist reports that an emergency procedure was performed to relieve pain and the canals were medicated, but definitive obturation was deferred. Using the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) diagnostic framework as the foundational base—where pulpal diagnoses are categorical descriptors of pulp status and treatment stage, and apical diagnoses are independent categorical descriptors of periapical tissue status—select the option that most accurately classifies the pulpal and apical status and correctly states the criteria that make “previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated” mutually exclusive and how those labels interact with current pulpal and apical diagnoses.\n\nA. Pulpal: Previously initiated therapy; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: These two pulpal labels are mutually exclusive because “previously initiated therapy” denotes that endodontic treatment has been started but canals are not obturated, whereas “previously treated” requires completed endodontic therapy with canal obturation visible radiographically. Either pulpal label can co-exist with any current apical diagnosis since pulpal and apical diagnoses are assigned independently.\n\nB. Pulpal: Previously treated; Apical: Chronic apical abscess; Rationale: Mutual exclusivity does not apply when different canals are in different states; a tooth can be both previously initiated and previously treated simultaneously if at least one canal is obturated and another is not. The presence of a periapical radiolucency without swelling best indicates a chronic apical abscess.\n\nC. Pulpal: Pulp necrosis; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: “Previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated” are apical categories that should not be used as pulpal diagnoses. Absent responses to cold and EPT indicate necrotic pulp, and percussion tenderness with radiolucency indicates symptomatic apical periodontitis.\n\nD. Pulpal: Previously initiated therapy; Apical: Normal apical tissues; Rationale: The mutual exclusivity between “previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated” is determined by symptom severity, with symptomatic cases being “previously treated” and asymptomatic cases being “previously initiated therapy.” Normal apical tissues are consistent with the absence of swelling.\n\nE. Pulpal: Previously treated; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: Mutual exclusivity is defined by the presence or absence of a permanent coronal restoration; a tooth with a permanent restoration should be considered previously treated. Apical and pulpal diagnoses are dependent, so symptomatic apical periodontitis cannot be assigned unless the pulpal diagnosis is “previously treated.”",
            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical scenario and requested a diagnosis based on the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) framework, along with an explanation of specific diagnostic terms. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe clinical and radiographic findings for a maxillary premolar are as follows:\n- **Coronal Status**: Intact temporary restoration with an open endodontic access.\n- **Pulpal (Vitality) Testing**:\n    - No response to cold testing.\n    - No response to Electric Pulp Test (EPT).\n- **Periapical Testing**:\n    - Tender to percussion.\n    - Tender to palpation.\n- **Soft Tissue Examination**:\n    - No swelling.\n    - No sinus tract.\n- **Radiographic Findings**:\n    - No root canal filling material in any canal.\n    - Well-defined periapical radiolucency at the apex.\n- **Treatment History**:\n    - An emergency procedure was performed to relieve pain.\n    - Canals were medicated.\n    - Definitive obturation was deferred.\n- **Diagnostic Framework**: American Association of Endodontists (AAE).\n- **Task Requirement**: Select the option that:\n    1.  Accurately classifies the pulpal and apical status.\n    2.  Correctly explains the mutual exclusivity of “previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated”.\n    3.  Correctly explains the interaction of these pulpal labels with apical diagnoses.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set within the established clinical science of endodontics, a specialty of stomatology. It uses standardized terminology, clinical tests, and radiographic interpretation principles that are part of the AAE's official Diagnostic Terminology guidelines. These guidelines represent the consensus and standard of care in the field. The scenario is a common and realistic clinical presentation. The problem is firmly grounded in verifiable scientific principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a comprehensive set of clinical and radiographic data. This information is sufficient to arrive at a specific pulpal and apical diagnosis using the specified AAE framework. The question is unambiguous and asks for a classification and an explanation of the underlying rules of the classification system. A unique and correct answer can be derived.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem statement uses objective clinical language (e.g., \"tender to percussion,\" \"no response to cold testing\") and avoids subjective or ambiguous descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a definitive answer based on the specified diagnostic framework. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of Diagnosis\n\nThe AAE diagnostic framework requires separate, independent diagnoses for the pulp and the periapical tissues.\n\n**Pulpal Diagnosis**\nThe history indicates that the tooth has undergone partial endodontic treatment: an emergency procedure was performed, canals were medicated, but definitive obturation was not completed.\n- According to the AAE, **Previously Initiated Therapy** is the clinical diagnostic category for a tooth that has been previously treated by partial endodontic therapy (e.g., pulpotomy, pulpectomy). The key feature is that the canals have been instrumented but not obturated.\n- **Previously Treated** is the category for a tooth that has been endodontically treated and the canals *are* obturated with a filling material.\n- **Pulp Necrosis** is the category for the death of the dental pulp, indicated by non-responsiveness to pulp tests. While the pulp was certainly necrotic to warrant the initial intervention, the current status is defined by the treatment that has been performed. The AAE guidelines prioritize the treatment status as the diagnosis once intervention has occurred.\nGiven that the canals have been accessed and medicated but contain no filling material, the correct pulpal diagnosis is **Previously Initiated Therapy**.\n\n**Apical Diagnosis**\nThe apical diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and radiographic findings in the periapical region.\n- **Clinical findings**: The tooth is tender to percussion and palpation. These are definitive clinical symptoms of inflammation in the periodontium.\n- **Radiographic findings**: There is a well-defined periapical radiolucency. This is a sign of bone resorption due to inflammation originating from the pulp space.\nBased on the AAE definitions:\n- **Symptomatic Apical Periodontitis** is defined as inflammation of the apical periodontium producing clinical symptoms, including a painful response to biting, percussion, or palpation. It may or may not be associated with a radiolucency. This patient's presentation (symptoms + radiolucency) is the classic example of this diagnosis.\n- **Asymptomatic Apical Periodontitis** is characterized by a radiolucency but *no* clinical symptoms. This is incorrect as the patient is symptomatic.\n- **Chronic Apical Abscess** is characterized by a radiolucency and the presence of a draining sinus tract, with little to no discomfort. This is incorrect as there is no sinus tract and the patient has symptoms.\n- **Acute Apical Abscess** is characterized by pain, swelling, and pus formation. This is incorrect as there is no swelling.\n- **Normal Apical Tissues** is incorrect due to the presence of symptoms and a radiolucency.\nTherefore, the correct apical diagnosis is **Symptomatic Apical Periodontitis**.\n\n**Summary of Correct Diagnosis**:\n- **Pulpal**: Previously Initiated Therapy\n- **Apical**: Symptomatic Apical Periodontitis\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Pulpal: Previously initiated therapy; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: These two pulpal labels are mutually exclusive because “previously initiated therapy” denotes that endodontic treatment has been started but canals are not obturated, whereas “previously treated” requires completed endodontic therapy with canal obturation visible radiographically. Either pulpal label can co-exist with any current apical diagnosis since pulpal and apical diagnoses are assigned independently.**\n- **Pulpal Diagnosis**: Correct. As derived above.\n- **Apical Diagnosis**: Correct. As derived above.\n- **Rationale**: The explanation for mutual exclusivity is precise and aligns with the AAE definitions based on obturation status. The statement that pulpal and apical diagnoses are independent is also a core principle of the AAE framework. The entire rationale is sound.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Pulpal: Previously treated; Apical: Chronic apical abscess; Rationale: Mutual exclusivity does not apply when different canals are in different states; a tooth can be both previously initiated and previously treated simultaneously if at least one canal is obturated and another is not. The presence of a periapical radiolucency without swelling best indicates a chronic apical abscess.**\n- **Pulpal Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The tooth is explicitly described as having \"no root canal filling material in any canal,\" which contradicts the definition of \"Previously Treated.\"\n- **Apical Diagnosis**: Incorrect. A chronic apical abscess is diagnosed by the presence of a sinus tract and is typically asymptomatic. This patient is symptomatic and has no sinus tract.\n- **Rationale**: The rationale is flawed. While complex cases exist, the AAE framework does not assign two simultaneous pulpal diagnoses to a single tooth. The concept of mutual exclusivity is fundamental. The rationale misinterprets the diagnostic criteria for \"Chronic Apical Abscess.\"\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Pulpal: Pulp necrosis; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: “Previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated” are apical categories that should not be used as pulpal diagnoses. Absent responses to cold and EPT indicate necrotic pulp, and percussion tenderness with radiolucency indicates symptomatic apical periodontitis.**\n- **Pulpal Diagnosis**: Incorrect. Although the original state was necrotic, the current state after intervention is best described as \"Previously Initiated Therapy.\" Using \"Pulp Necrosis\" ignores the treatment history.\n- **Apical Diagnosis**: Correct.\n- **Rationale**: The rationale contains a critical error. \"Previously initiated therapy\" and \"previously treated\" are definitively **pulpal**, not apical, diagnostic categories in the AAE framework. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the classification system.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Pulpal: Previously initiated therapy; Apical: Normal apical tissues; Rationale: The mutual exclusivity between “previously initiated therapy” and “previously treated” is determined by symptom severity, with symptomatic cases being “previously treated” and asymptomatic cases being “previously initiated therapy.” Normal apical tissues are consistent with the absence of swelling.**\n- **Pulpal Diagnosis**: Correct.\n- **Apical Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The presence of a periapical radiolucency and tenderness to percussion/palpation are definitive signs of pathology, contradicting a diagnosis of \"Normal Apical Tissues.\"\n- **Rationale**: The rationale is entirely false. The distinction between \"previously initiated\" and \"previously treated\" is based on the procedural state of the root canal system (presence/absence of obturation), not on symptom severity.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Pulpal: Previously treated; Apical: Symptomatic apical periodontitis; Rationale: Mutual exclusivity is defined by the presence or absence of a permanent coronal restoration; a tooth with a permanent restoration should be considered previously treated. Apical and pulpal diagnoses are dependent, so symptomatic apical periodontitis cannot be assigned unless the pulpal diagnosis is “previously treated.”**\n- **Pulpal Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The tooth is not obturated.\n- **Apical Diagnosis**: Correct.\n- **Rationale**: The rationale is incorrect on two counts. First, the defining characteristic for \"Previously Treated\" is canal obturation, not the type of coronal restoration. Second, pulpal and apical diagnoses are independent categories. Symptomatic apical periodontitis can occur with a necrotic pulp, a previously initiated tooth, or a previously treated tooth. The stated dependency is false.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

            "introduction": "While a standardized framework is essential, clinical diagnosis often presents complexities that demand a deeper understanding of pulpal pathophysiology. Diagnostic tests measure proxies for pulpal health, such as neural response, not vitality itself, and their results can be ambiguous, especially in multi-rooted teeth.

            "problem": "A patient aged $38$ years presents with deep distal caries on a mandibular first molar. Thermal testing is performed separately on the mesial and distal cusps. A cold stimulus applied to the mesial cusp elicits a brief, non-lingering sharp pain; the same stimulus on the distal cusp elicits no response. A heat stimulus produces no appreciable lingering pain. An Electric Pulp Test (EPT) generates a crisp response at a moderate setting when the probe is placed on enamel over the mesial pulp horn. Periodontal probing is within normal limits, and there is slight tenderness to percussion. A periapical radiograph shows a discrete radiolucency at the apex of the distal root only. Starting from the fundamental definitions that (i) pulp vitality refers to adequate vascular supply and (ii) pulp sensibility testing interrogates neural responsiveness, and integrating the known physiology of myelinated A-delta and unmyelinated C-fibers, select all statements that best justify why a tooth with partial pulp necrosis can still yield a positive EPT, and how regional vitality patterns are integrated into a single tooth-level pulpal diagnosis under standard classification schemes.\n\nA. EPT interrogates neural sensibility of residual viable myelinated A-delta fibers in remaining vital coronal pulp; current can depolarize these fibers via conductive pathways in enamel/dentin overlying non-necrotic regions, so a positive response is possible even when another canal is necrotic.\n\nB. Because EPT measures pulpal blood flow, any positive EPT definitively excludes necrosis; therefore the tooth cannot be diagnosed as pulp necrosis.\n\nC. In a multi-rooted tooth with one canal necrotic and others still vital, the correct tooth-level pulpal diagnosis in standard endodontic classification is pulp necrosis, because diagnosis is assigned to the entire tooth and the most advanced irreversible state present anywhere in the pulp dictates the label.\n\nD. Regional averaging is recommended: if at least one-half of canals are vital, the tooth-level diagnosis should be reversible pulpitis rather than necrosis.\n\nE. A positive EPT in a tooth with partial necrosis can arise from current conduction to adjacent periodontal tissues or metallic restorations, producing a false positive; therefore sensibility tests must be interpreted alongside thermal testing, clinical signs, and radiographic findings.\n\nF. If one canal exhibits symptomatic irreversible pulpitis while another is necrotic, the tooth-level pulpal diagnosis should be asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis to avoid overtreatment.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient**: Age $38$ years.\n-   **Tooth**: Mandibular first molar.\n-   **Clinical Finding**: Deep distal caries.\n-   **Thermal Test (Cold) on Mesial Cusp**: Elicits a brief, non-lingering sharp pain.\n-   **Thermal Test (Cold) on Distal Cusp**: Elicits no response.\n-   **Thermal Test (Heat)**: Produces no appreciable lingering pain.\n-   **Electric Pulp Test (EPT)**: Generates a crisp response at a moderate setting when the probe is placed on enamel over the mesial pulp horn.\n-   **Periodontal Probing**: Within normal limits.\n-   **Percussion Test**: Slight tenderness.\n-   **Radiographic Finding**: A discrete radiolucency at the apex of the distal root only.\n-   **Fundamental Definition (i)**: Pulp vitality is defined as adequate vascular supply.\n-   **Fundamental Definition (ii)**: Pulp sensibility testing interrogates neural responsiveness.\n-   **Physiological Basis**: Integrate the known physiology of myelinated A-delta and unmyelinated C-fibers.\n-   **Question**: Select all statements that best justify (1) why a tooth with partial pulp necrosis can still yield a positive EPT, and (2) how regional vitality patterns are integrated into a single tooth-level pulpal diagnosis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic and realistic clinical scenario in endodontics.\n\n1.  **Scientific and Factual Soundness**: The clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with established pathophysiology. The distinction between pulp vitality (vascularity) and sensibility (neural response) is a cornerstone of endodontic diagnosis. The functions of A-delta fibers (sharp, brief pain, lower stimulation threshold) and C-fibers (dull, lingering pain, higher stimulation threshold) are correctly implied. The described scenario—vital mesial pulp and necrotic distal pulp in a mandibular molar—is a common clinical presentation.\n2.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided information is sufficient and internally consistent. The brief, sharp pain on the mesial cusp to cold stimulus is a classic A-delta fiber response, indicating vital pulp tissue. The positive EPT on the mesial side corroborates this finding of neural sensibility. The lack of response on the distal cusp to the same stimulus, combined with the periapical radiolucency at the distal apex, strongly indicates pulp necrosis in the distal canal and consequent chronic apical periodontitis. The slight tenderness to percussion indicates inflammation of the periapical ligament, consistent with symptomatic apical periodontitis. All data points converge to a coherent diagnosis of partial pulp necrosis.\n3.  **Well-Posed and Unambiguous**: The problem is clearly formulated. It requires the application of fundamental diagnostic principles to a specific case, asking for justifications for both the test results and the final diagnostic classification. It is not ill-posed, trivial, or based on unverifiable claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe clinical scenario describes a multi-rooted mandibular first molar with partial pulp necrosis. The pulp in the mesial canal(s) is vital and sensate, as evidenced by the response to cold and EPT. This response is mediated by myelinated A-delta nerve fibers. The pulp in the distal canal is necrotic, evidenced by the lack of response to cold and, critically, by the presence of a periapical radiolucency, which is a radiographic sign of bone resorption resulting from chronic infection originating from a necrotic pulp. The slight tenderness to percussion is a sign of symptomatic apical periodontitis.\n\nThe question has two parts:\n1.  Explain a positive EPT in a partially necrotic tooth.\n2.  Explain the integration of regional findings into a single tooth-level pulpal diagnosis.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these requirements and the foundational principles of endodontics.\n\n**A. EPT interrogates neural sensibility of residual viable myelinated A-delta fibers in remaining vital coronal pulp; current can depolarize these fibers via conductive pathways in enamel/dentin overlying non-necrotic regions, so a positive response is possible even when another canal is necrotic.**\nThis statement provides a physiologically correct explanation for a true-positive EPT response in the given scenario. The Electric Pulp Test (EPT) delivers a current that excites sensory nerves, primarily the low-threshold, myelinated A-delta fibers, which are responsible for sharp pain. In this case, the pulp tissue in the mesial portion of the tooth is vital and contains these fibers. When the EPT probe is placed on the enamel overlying this vital region, the current is conducted through enamel and dentin to these nerve fibers, causing depolarization and a sensation of pain, thus registering a positive response. The necrotic status of the distal canal does not prevent this localized stimulation. This statement correctly addresses the first part of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because EPT measures pulpal blood flow, any positive EPT definitively excludes necrosis; therefore the tooth cannot be diagnosed as pulp necrosis.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The premise that EPT measures pulpal blood flow is incorrect. EPT measures neural sensibility, not vascular vitality. Tests that measure blood flow include Laser Doppler Flowmetry and Pulse Oximetry. Since the primary premise is false, the conclusion is invalid. A positive EPT result does not exclude necrosis, as it only indicates that *some* nerve fibers in the pulp are responsive. It cannot assess the status of the entire pulp space, as demonstrated by this very case of partial necrosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In a multi-rooted tooth with one canal necrotic and others still vital, the correct tooth-level pulpal diagnosis in standard endodontic classification is pulp necrosis, because diagnosis is assigned to the entire tooth and the most advanced irreversible state present anywhere in the pulp dictates the label.**\nThis statement accurately describes the established convention for pulpal diagnosis as recommended by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and other governing bodies. Endodontic diagnosis is made for the tooth as a single unit. When different parts of the pulp exhibit different pathological states, the diagnosis for the entire tooth is assigned based on the most advanced or severe condition present. Pulp necrosis is considered a more advanced and irreversible state than pulpitis (reversible or irreversible). Therefore, if any portion of the pulp is necrotic, the diagnosis for the tooth is \"Pulp Necrosis.\" This requires root canal treatment of all canals in the tooth, not just the necrotic one. This statement correctly addresses the second part of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Regional averaging is recommended: if at least one-half of canals are vital, the tooth-level diagnosis should be reversible pulpitis rather than necrosis.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect and describes a dangerous clinical practice. There is no principle of \"regional averaging\" or a \"majority rule\" in endodontic diagnosis. The diagnosis is based on the most severe pathology present. Diagnosing a tooth with partial necrosis as having \"reversible pulpitis\" would lead to gross mismanagement. Reversible pulpitis implies the pulp can heal, warranting conservative treatment (e.g., a filling). Failing to treat the necrotic portion would allow the infection to persist and progress, potentially leading to a severe abscess or systemic involvement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A positive EPT in a tooth with partial necrosis can arise from current conduction to adjacent periodontal tissues or metallic restorations, producing a false positive; therefore sensibility tests must be interpreted alongside thermal testing, clinical signs, and radiographic findings.**\nThis statement is correct on two counts. First, it presents a valid, alternative explanation for a positive EPT: a false positive. The current from an EPT can be conducted to adjacent gingiva, the periodontal ligament, or through a large metallic restoration to an adjacent tooth, any of which can elicit a response that is not from the pulp of the tooth being tested. This is a known limitation of EPT. Second, it states a fundamental and critical principle of diagnosis: test results must be synthesized. No single endodontic test is foolproof. The clinician must integrate all available data—patient history, clinical examination, multiple sensibility tests (thermal and electrical), percussion, palpation, and radiographic findings—to arrive at a correct diagnosis. This principle is precisely how the \"regional vitality patterns\" mentioned in the prompt are integrated. This statement addresses both parts of the question by offering a reason for a positive EPT and explaining the diagnostic methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. If one canal exhibits symptomatic irreversible pulpitis while another is necrotic, the tooth-level pulpal diagnosis should be asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis to avoid overtreatment.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As established in the analysis of option C, the diagnosis is based on the most severe pathology, which is necrosis. The diagnosis in this hypothetical case would be \"Pulp Necrosis.\" Furthermore, the notion of deliberately misdiagnosing a condition as \"asymptomatic\" to \"avoid overtreatment\" is biologically and ethically unsound. The treatment for both symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis is root canal therapy, so the premise of avoiding \"overtreatment\" by changing the diagnostic label is illogical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (specifically, the Leibniz integral rule), we have $\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_t^a f(x)dx = -f(t)$ and $\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_a^t f(x)dx = f(t)$.\n$$ \\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) [-p(t|\\omega_R)] + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I) [p(t|\\omega_I)] $$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the optimality condition:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I) p(t|\\omega_I) - C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) p(t|\\omega_R) = 0 $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I) p(t|\\omega_I) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) p(t|\\omega_R) $$\nThis equation states that at the optimal threshold $t$, the weighted likelihoods of the two classes are equal, where the weights are the products of the misclassification costs and prior probabilities.\n\nThe class-conditional distributions are given as normal distributions with a common variance $\\sigma^2$:\n$$ p(x|\\omega_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting these into the optimality condition:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - \\mu_I)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - \\mu_R)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - \\mu_I)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - \\mu_R)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)) - \\frac{(t - \\mu_I)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln(C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)) - \\frac{(t - \\mu_R)^2}{2\\sigma^2} $$\nRearranging to isolate the terms containing $t$:\n$$ \\frac{(t - \\mu_R)^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{(t - \\mu_I)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln(C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)) - \\ln(C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)) $$\n$$ (t - \\mu_R)^2 - (t - \\mu_I)^2 = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\nExpanding the quadratic terms on the left side:\n$$ (t^2 - 2t\\mu_R + \\mu_R^2) - (t^2 - 2t\\mu_I + \\mu_I^2) = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\n$$ 2t(\\mu_I - \\mu_R) - (\\mu_I^2 - \\mu_R^2) = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\nFactoring the difference of squares, $(\\mu_I^2 - \\mu_R^2) = (\\mu_I - \\mu_R)(\\mu_I + \\mu_R)$:\n$$ 2t(\\mu_I - \\mu_R) - (\\mu_I - \\mu_R)(\\mu_I + \\mu_R) = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\nAssuming $\\mu_I \\neq \\mu_R$, we can divide by $2(\\mu_I - \\mu_R)$:\n$$ t - \\frac{\\mu_I + \\mu_R}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_I - \\mu_R} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\nFinally, solving for $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\mu_I + \\mu_R}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_I - \\mu_R} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}\\right) $$\nThis expression reveals that the optimal threshold $t$ is the midpoint between the two means, $\\frac{\\mu_I + \\mu_R}{2}$, plus a shift term. The shift is zero if the argument of the logarithm is $1$, which occurs when $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R) = C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)$. In this special case, where the prior-weighted costs of misclassification are equal, the optimal threshold is simply the midpoint.\n\nIn our problem, the costs and priors are not symmetric. The shift term accounts for this asymmetry. The term inside the logarithm, $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)}$, is the ratio of the prior-weighted cost of a false positive to that of a false negative.\nGiven values: $\\mu_I = 45$, $\\mu_R = 15$, $\\sigma = 8$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)=0.4$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)=0.6$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}}=6$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}}=2$.\nThe midpoint is $\\frac{45 + 15}{2} = 30$.\nThe term $\\mu_I - \\mu_R = 45 - 15 = 30$, which is positive.\nLet's evaluate the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_R)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\mathbb{P}(\\omega_I)} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.6}{6 \\times 0.4} = \\frac{1.2}{2.4} = 0.5 $$\nSince this ratio is less than $1$, its natural logarithm is negative: $\\ln(0.5) < 0$. The shift term will be negative, meaning the optimal threshold $t$ is less than the midpoint of $30$. This is intuitive: the cost of a false negative ($C_{\\mathrm{FN}}=6$, misclassifying irreversible pulpitis) is significantly higher than a false positive ($C_{\\mathrm{FP}}=2$). To avoid the more costly error, the decision boundary is shifted to make a classification of $\\omega_I$ (irreversible) more likely. Lowering the threshold $t$ for the rule $X \\geq t$ achieves this by enlarging the decision region for class $\\omega_I$.\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values to calculate $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{45 + 15}{2} + \\frac{8^2}{45 - 15} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\times 0.6}{6 \\times 0.4}\\right) $$\n$$ t = 30 + \\frac{64}{30} \\ln(0.5) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.693147$:\n$$ t \\approx 30 + \\frac{64}{30} \\times (-0.693147) $$\n$$ t \\approx 30 - 2.13333... \\times 0.693147 $$\n$$ t \\approx 30 - 1.478714 $$\n$$ t \\approx 28.521286 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the optimal threshold is $28.52$. The unit is $\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.",
