The interaction between NaOCl and chlorhexidine (CHX) can produce a harmful precipitate, necessitating a thorough intermediate rinse.

            "problem": "An endodontic protocol seeks to avoid the known interaction between sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX) that yields a potentially harmful brown precipitate. A single-rooted canal has been instrumented to an apical size of International Organization for Standardization size $30$ (apical diameter $0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) at a working length of $20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ with a constant taper of $0.04\\,\\mathrm{mm/mm}$. Model the canal as a frustum of a right circular cone filled entirely with irrigant. Immediately prior to switching to $2\\%$ chlorhexidine, the canal is filled with $5.25\\%$ sodium hypochlorite. To avoid precipitate formation upon introducing chlorhexidine, the residual sodium hypochlorite concentration inside the canal must be diluted to at or below $0.02\\%$ (weight/volume). The operator will perform a single, uninterrupted sterile saline flush delivered through a side-vented needle placed short of the working length, generating vigorous but incomplete mixing. Under these conditions, treat the canal as a well-mixed control volume with continuous inflow of sodium-hypochlorite-free saline and no volume change, and assume that hydrodynamic limitations reduce the effective volumetric exchange to a constant fraction $\\beta$ of the delivered volume, with $\\beta = 0.010$.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass and the core definition of a continuously stirred single compartment with inflow and no generation or reaction, derive the relation governing the decay of the in-canal sodium hypochlorite concentration during the saline rinse.

Use the geometric model and given instrumentation parameters to compute the in-canal fluid volume. Express the final answer in milliliters and round your result to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The solution will be developed in three main steps. First, the volume of the root canal will be calculated based on the provided geometric model of a frustum. Second, a differential equation governing the concentration of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a function of the delivered saline volume will be derived from the principle of mass conservation. Third, this equation will be solved to determine the minimum volume of saline required to achieve the target dilution.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Root Canal Volume**\n\nThe root canal is modeled as a frustum of a right circular cone. The volume $V$ of a frustum is given by the formula:\n$$\nV = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi h (R^2 + Rr + r^2)\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the height, $r$ is the radius of the smaller base, and $R$ is the radius of the larger base.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following parameters:\n- The height of the frustum is the working length, $h = L = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The apical diameter is $0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, so the apical (smaller) radius is $r = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The taper is defined as $0.04\\,\\mathrm{mm/mm}$, which represents the increase in diameter per millimeter of length from the apex. The corresponding radial taper is $\\frac{0.04}{2} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm/mm}$.\n\nThe coronal (larger) radius $R$ at the full working length $L$ can be calculated as:\n$$\nR = r + (\\text{radial taper}) \\times L\n$$\n$$\nR = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm} + (0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm/mm}) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the volume formula for the frustum:\n$$\nV_{\\text{canal}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (20\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\left( (0.55\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 + (0.55\\,\\mathrm{mm})(0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}) + (0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{canal}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{3} (0.3025 + 0.0825 + 0.0225)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{canal}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{3} (0.4075)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\nThis expression for the canal volume will be used in the subsequent derivation.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Concentration Decay Equation**\n\nWe apply the principle of conservation of mass for the solute (NaOCl) within the control volume (the root canal). The system is treated as a continuously stirred single compartment where the inflow is saline (free of NaOCl) and the outflow has the same concentration as the fluid within the compartment. The total volume of fluid in the canal, $V_{\\text{canal}}$, is constant.\n\nLet $C(v)$ be the concentration of NaOCl in the canal as a function of the total volume $v$ of saline delivered. Let $m$ be the mass of NaOCl in the canal, given by $m = C(v) \\cdot V_{\\text{canal}}$.\n\nThe change in mass $dm$ corresponding to a small delivered volume $dv$ is:\n$$\ndm = V_{\\text{canal}} \\, dC\n$$\nThis change is caused by the removal of NaOCl from the canal. The problem states that the effective volumetric exchange is a fraction $\\beta$ of the delivered volume. Therefore, for a delivered volume $dv$, the volume of fluid effectively flushed from the canal is $dv_{\\text{eff}} = \\beta \\, dv$. The mass of NaOCl removed, $dm_{\\text{out}}$, is the concentration in the canal multiplied by this effective outflow volume:\n$$\ndm_{\\text{out}} = C(v) \\cdot dv_{\\text{eff}} = C(v) \\cdot (\\beta \\, dv)\n$$\nSince there is no inflow of NaOCl, the change in mass within the control volume is equal to the negative of the mass that flows out:\n$$\ndm = -dm_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $dm$ and $dm_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{canal}} \\, dC = -C(v) \\beta \\, dv\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the differential relation governing the concentration decay:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -\\frac{\\beta}{V_{\\text{canal}}} \\, dv\n$$\nThis is the required relation.\n\n**3. Determination of the Required Saline Volume**\n\nTo find the total volume of saline, $V_{\\text{saline}}$, needed to reduce the concentration from its initial value $C_0$ to the final target value $C_f$, we integrate the differential equation. The integration is performed from the initial state ($v=0$, $C=C_0$) to the final state ($v=V_{\\text{saline}}$, $C=C_f$).\n\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C_f} \\frac{dC}{C} = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{saline}}} -\\frac{\\beta}{V_{\\text{canal}}} \\, dv\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|C|]_{C_0}^{C_f} = -\\frac{\\beta}{V_{\\text{canal}}} [v]_{0}^{V_{\\text{saline}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C_f) - \\ln(C_0) = -\\frac{\\beta}{V_{\\text{canal}}} (V_{\\text{saline}} - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_f}{C_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\beta V_{\\text{saline}}}{V_{\\text{canal}}}\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{saline}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{saline}} = -\\frac{V_{\\text{canal}}}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_f}{C_0}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{canal}}}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_f}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the known values into this expression. The givens are:\n- $C_0 = 5.25\\%$\n- $C_f = 0.02\\%$\n- $\\beta = 0.010$\n\nThe canal volume is $V_{\\text{canal}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{3} (0.4075)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3 \\approx 8.53507\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3$.\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{saline}} = \\frac{\\frac{20\\pi}{3} (0.4075)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3}{0.010} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.25}{0.02}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{saline}} = 100 \\left( \\frac{20\\pi}{3} (0.4075) \\right) \\ln(262.5)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{saline}} \\approx 853.507 \\times \\ln(262.5)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{saline}} \\approx 853.507 \\times 5.57016\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3 \\approx 4753.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliliters (mL).

The curvature, $\\kappa$, of the rod's centerline is given by the geometric relation:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{1}{r} $$\nFor a rod of radius $c$ subjected to pure bending, the maximum longitudinal strain, $\\epsilon_{\\text{max}}$, occurs at the outermost fiber.
