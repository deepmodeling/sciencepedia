            "problem": "In an advanced Orofacial Pain (OFP) referral clinic, a standardized mechanical provocation protocol is used to differentiate trigeminal neuralgia (TN) from suspected dental-origin pain. The protocol consists of innocuous tactile stimulation over a suspected trigger zone; a positive response is defined as immediate, sharp, unilateral paroxysmal pain with latency less than $0.5$ seconds resolving spontaneously within $2$ minutes. Assay validation against blinded adjudication by expert panel consensus shows the following operating characteristics with respect to TN versus non-TN dental-origin pain: sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.95$. In the clinic’s referral stream, the pretest prevalence of TN is $0.05$.\n\nAssume the test result is positive for a newly referred patient. Starting from the axiomatic definitions of conditional probability and the law of total probability, derive the posterior probability that the patient actually has TN given a positive test. This posterior probability is used to decide whether to proceed with first-line carbamazepine titration subject to Pharmacogenomics (PGx) screening for Human Leukocyte Antigen B*15:02 (HLA-B*15:02) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) variants.\n\nYou must:\n- Treat the sensitivity as $P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN})$ and specificity as $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN})$, where $T^{+}$ denotes a positive provocation test.\n- Use only foundational probability definitions and do not invoke preassembled clinical “shortcut” formulas.\n- Express the final posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+})$ as a single exact fraction in simplest terms.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, thus meeting all criteria for a valid problem statement. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the posterior probability that a patient has trigeminal neuralgia ($\\mathrm{TN}$) given a positive test result ($T^{+}$), denoted as $P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+})$. The derivation must start from foundational axiomatic definitions.\n\nLet $\\mathrm{TN}$ be the event that the patient has trigeminal neuralgia, and let $\\neg \\mathrm{TN}$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have trigeminal neuralgia. Let $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The pretest prevalence of trigeminal neuralgia: $P(\\mathrm{TN}) = 0.05$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test: $P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) = 0.90$.\n3.  The specificity of the test: $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 0.95$, where $T^{-}$ is the event of a negative test result.\n\nWe begin with the axiomatic definition of conditional probability, which states that for any two events $A$ and $B$, where $P(B) > 0$:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n\nApplying this definition to our target probability, $P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+})$, we have:\n$$P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{TN} \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(\\mathrm{TN} \\cap T^{+})$, can be expressed by rearranging the conditional probability definition for sensitivity, $P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN})$:\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\cap \\mathrm{TN})}{P(\\mathrm{TN})}$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{TN} \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\mathrm{TN})$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the total probability of a positive test. We can expand this term using the law of total probability. The sample space is partitioned by the events $\\mathrm{TN}$ and $\\neg \\mathrm{TN}$. Therefore, the event $T^{+}$ can be written as the union of two disjoint events: $(T^{+} \\cap \\mathrm{TN})$ and $(T^{+} \\cap \\neg \\mathrm{TN})$.\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap \\mathrm{TN}) + P(T^{+} \\cap \\neg \\mathrm{TN})$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term in the sum, we get:\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\mathrm{TN}) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\neg \\mathrm{TN})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into our original equation for $P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+})$ yields Bayes' theorem, derived from first principles as required:\n$$P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\mathrm{TN})}{P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\mathrm{TN}) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) P(\\neg \\mathrm{TN})}$$\n\nBefore substituting the given values, we must calculate the probabilities for the complementary events:\nThe probability of not having TN is:\n$$P(\\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 1 - P(\\mathrm{TN}) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\nThe probability of a positive test given no TN (the false positive rate) is $1$ minus the specificity:\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we convert the decimal probabilities into exact fractions for the calculation:\n$P(\\mathrm{TN}) = 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$\n$P(T^{+} \\mid \\mathrm{TN}) = 0.90 = \\frac{90}{100} = \\frac{9}{10}$\n$P(\\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 0.95 = \\frac{95}{100} = \\frac{19}{20}$\n$P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg \\mathrm{TN}) = 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$\n\nSubstitute these fractional values into the derived formula:\n$$P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) \\left(\\frac{19}{20}\\right)}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the products in the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator:\n$$\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) = \\frac{9}{200}$$\nDenominator terms:\n$$\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) = \\frac{9}{200}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) \\left(\\frac{19}{20}\\right) = \\frac{19}{400}$$\n\nNow, we sum the terms in the denominator:\n$$P(T^{+}) = \\frac{9}{200} + \\frac{19}{400} = \\frac{18}{400} + \\frac{19}{400} = \\frac{37}{400}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability:\n$$P(\\mathrm{TN} \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{9}{200}}{\\frac{37}{400}} = \\frac{9}{200} \\cdot \\frac{400}{37} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 2}{37} = \\frac{18}{37}$$\n\nThe posterior probability that the patient has trigeminal neuralgia given a positive provocation test is $\\frac{18}{37}$.",

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\nTo solve this problem, we first organize the provided data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. The 'test' is the MRI result (positive or negative for NVC), and the 'condition' is the outcome of the MVD surgery (success or failure).\n\nIn this context, we define:\n- True Positive ($TP$): The test is positive (MRI+) and the condition is present (surgical success).\n- False Positive ($FP$): The test is positive (MRI+) but the condition is absent (surgical failure).\n- False Negative ($FN$): The test is negative (MRI-) but the condition is present (surgical success).\n- True Negative ($TN$): The test is negative (MRI-) and the condition is absent (surgical failure).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can directly assign these values:\n- $TP = 136$ (MRI positive, surgical success)\n- $FP = 24$ (MRI positive, surgical failure)\n- $FN = 18$ (MRI negative, surgical success)\n- $TN = 42$ (MRI negative, surgical failure)\n\nThe contingency table is as follows:\n\n|                    | Surgical Success (Condition Positive) | Surgical Failure (Condition Negative) | Total                |\n|--------------------|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|\n| **MRI Positive (Test +)** | $TP = 136$                            | $FP = 24$                             | $TP + FP = 160$      |\n| **MRI Negative (Test -)** | $FN = 18$                             | $TN = 42$                             | $FN + TN = 60$       |\n| **Total**          | $TP + FN = 154$                       | $FP + TN = 66$                        | $TP+FP+FN+TN = 220$  |\n\nNow, we compute the required metrics using their standard definitions.\n\n**1. Sensitivity**\nSensitivity, or the True Positive Rate, is the probability that the test correctly identifies those with the condition. It is the proportion of subjects with surgical success who had a positive MRI.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\nSubstituting the values from our table:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{136}{136 + 18} = \\frac{136}{154} $$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ \\frac{136}{154} \\approx 0.88311688... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.8831$.\n\n**2. Specificity**\nSpecificity, or the True Negative Rate, is the probability that the test correctly identifies those without the condition.

Pharmacogenomic testing reveals carriage of human leukocyte antigen B*15:02 (HLA-B*15:02) and human leukocyte antigen A*31:01 (HLA-A*31:01), and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) genotype consistent with poor metabolism. In light of the elevated risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and altered metabolism with sodium channel blockers and aromatic anticonvulsants, pregabalin is selected as the first-line systemic agent.\n\nThe patient is a $68$-year-old female, height $165$ cm, total body weight $85$ kg, with stable chronic kidney disease and most recent Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of $35$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$ and serum creatinine (SCr) of $1.8$ mg/dL.

The given eGFR of $35$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$ is a standard laboratory report value (likely from an MDRD or CKD-EPI equation), while the instruction to use the Cockcroft-Gault equation for dosing is a common clinical workflow, as the latter is often preferred for drug dose adjustments. This does not represent a contradiction but a realistic clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe calculation proceeds in a stepwise manner as specified by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Calculation of Ideal Body Weight (IBW)**\nThe Devine formula is a standard method for calculating IBW. For a female, the formula is:\n$$ \\text{IBW (kg)} = 45.5 \\, \\text{kg} + 2.3 \\, \\text{kg for each inch of height over 5 feet} $$\nFirst, the patient's height is converted from centimeters to inches:\n$$ \\text{Height (in)} = \\frac{165 \\, \\text{cm}}{2.54 \\, \\text{cm/in}} \\approx 64.96 \\, \\text{in} $$\nThis height is equivalent to $5$ feet and $4.96$ inches.\nApplying the Devine formula:\n$$ \\text{IBW} = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times (64.96 - 60) = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times 4.96 = 45.5 + 11.408 = 56.908 \\, \\text{kg} $$\n\n**2. Determination of Dosing Weight**\nThe problem specifies using adjusted body weight (AdjBW) if the total body weight (TBW) is greater than $120\\%$ of the IBW.\n$$ 1.20 \\times \\text{IBW} = 1.20 \\times 56.908 \\, \\text{kg} = 68.29 \\, \\text{kg} $$\nThe patient's TBW is $85$ kg. Since $85 \\, \\text{kg} > 68.29 \\, \\text{kg}$, the condition is met, and AdjBW must be used for the Cockcroft-Gault calculation.\n\n**3. Calculation of Adjusted Body Weight (AdjBW)**\nThe standard formula for AdjBW is:\n$$ \\text{AdjBW} = \\text{IBW} + 0.4 \\times (\\text{TBW} - \\text{IBW}) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{AdjBW} = 56.908 + 0.4 \\times (85 - 56.908) = 56.908 + 0.4 \\times (28.092) = 56.908 + 11.2368 = 68.1448 \\, \\text{kg} $$\n\n**4. Calculation of Creatinine Clearance (CrCl)**\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation for a female patient is:\n$$ \\text{CrCl (mL/min)} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight (kg)}}{72 \\times \\text{SCr (mg/dL)}} \\times 0.85 $$\nUsing the patient's data and the calculated AdjBW as the weight term:\n- Age = $68$ years\n- Weight = AdjBW = $68.1448$ kg\n- SCr = $1.8$ mg/dL\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 68) \\times 68.1448}{72 \\times 1.8} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{72 \\times 68.1448}{129.6} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{4906.4256}{129.6} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 37.8582 \\times 0.85 = 32.1795 \\, \\text{mL/min} $$\nThe calculated CrCl of approximately $32$ mL/min is consistent with the provided eGFR of $35$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$, granting confidence in the result.\n\n**5. Calculation of Adjusted Pregabalin Dose**\nThe problem states that the maintenance dose is directly proportional to CrCl, with a reference dose of $600$ mg/day corresponding to a reference CrCl of $100$ mL/min.\nThe dose adjustment is performed using a direct ratio:\n$$ \\text{Adjusted Dose} = \\text{Reference Dose} \\times \\frac{\\text{Patient's CrCl}}{\\text{Reference CrCl}} $$\n$$ \\text{Adjusted Dose} = 600 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times \\frac{32.1795 \\, \\text{mL/min}}{100 \\, \\text{mL/min}} $$\n$$ \\text{Adjusted Dose} = 600 \\times 0.321795 = 193.077 \\, \\text{mg/day} $$\n\n**6. Final Answer Rounding**\nThe final dose must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Adjusted Dose} \\approx 193 \\, \\text{mg/day} $$\nThis dose would typically be administered in a divided schedule, for example, $100$ mg in the morning and $100$ mg at night, or approximately $75$ mg twice daily initially, titrating up to a target of approximately $200$ mg/day total, as tolerated.\n\n### Renal Monitoring Protocol\nAs requested, a prudent renal monitoring strategy for the first month of therapy would be as follows:\n- **Baseline:** The baseline serum creatinine (SCr = $1.8$ mg/dL) and calculated CrCl (CrCl $\\approx 32$ mL/min) are established before initiating therapy.\n- **Week 1:** A repeat SCr measurement should be obtained within $5$ to $7$ days after starting pregabalin. This is to ensure that no acute deterioration in renal function has occurred and to confirm the patient's renal stability with the new medication.\n- **Month 1:** A follow-up SCr should be checked at the end of the first month, particularly if the dose has been titrated during this period. This confirms the steady-state renal function on a stable maintenance dose.\n- **Patient Counseling:** The patient must be counseled on the signs and symptoms of drug accumulation (e.g., excessive somnolence, dizziness, ataxia) and worsening renal function (e.g., edema, reduced urine output). This empowers the patient to report adverse effects promptly, which is crucial given the narrowed therapeutic window in renal impairment.\n\nThe final reportable answer is strictly the numerical value of the calculated daily dose.",
