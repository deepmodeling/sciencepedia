We model this using a steady-state reaction-diffusion equation.\n\n**1. Governing Equation**\nFick's second law for diffusion in one dimension ($x$) with a consumption term is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - R_{O_2} $$\nwhere $C$ is the oxygen concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $R_{O_2}$ is the volumetric oxygen consumption rate.\nThe problem states that oxygen uptake follows first-order kinetics, so $R_{O_2} = kC$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant. At steady state, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} = kC \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0 $$\n\n**2. Derivation of Characteristic Length**\nThe general solution to this ODE is $C(x) = A e^{\\sqrt{k/D} x} + B e^{-\\sqrt{k/D} x}$.\nLet's set the hydrogel surface at $x=0$, where the concentration is fixed at $C(0) = C_0$. For the concentration to remain physically meaningful (not grow to infinity) deep inside the hydrogel ($x \\to \\infty$), the coefficient $A$ must be zero. This gives the solution:\n$$ C(x) = C_0 e^{-\\sqrt{k/D} x} $$\nThe problem defines the characteristic diffusion-limited thickness, $L$, as the e-folding length where the concentration decays to $C_0/e$, i.e., $C(L) = C_0 e^{-1}$.\n$$ C_0 e^{-1} = C_0 e^{-\\sqrt{k/D} L} $$\n$$ 1 = \\sqrt{k/D} L \\quad \\implies \\quad L = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} $$\n\n**3.

The hydrogel slab has thickness $L$ and is initially loaded with a one-sided FGF2 gradient established across the slab. Assume purely diffusive transport with no bulk flow and negligible reaction or consumption, and consider one-dimensional transport across the thickness.

            "solution": "This problem requires deriving the characteristic time scale for a diffusing gradient to dissipate and discussing its implications for tissue engineering.\n\n**1. Derivation of Characteristic Time Scale**\nThe transport of FGF2 is described by Fick's second law of diffusion.

Discussion of Implications**\nThe characteristic time for the gradient to dissipate is $\\tau = 5000\\,\\mathrm{s}$, which is approximately $1.4$ hours. Biological processes like branching morphogenesis and cell alignment occur over much longer timescales, typically days to weeks. Because the diffusion time is orders of magnitude shorter than the biological process time, an unconstrained, freely-diffusing gradient of FGF2 would disappear long before it could effectively guide cell behavior. Therefore, to provide a stable, long-lasting positional cue, immobilization strategies are essential. This can be achieved by covalently tethering FGF2 to the hydrogel or using affinity-based binding to the matrix, thereby drastically reducing its effective diffusion and stabilizing the gradient over the required culture period.",
