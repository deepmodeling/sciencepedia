            "introduction": "For a neuron to transmit a pain signal, it must first maintain a stable resting state, a delicate electrochemical balance across its membrane. This practice delves into the biophysical foundations of this state by applying the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation to a pulpal nociceptor. By calculating the resting membrane potential from given ionic concentrations and permeabilities, you will solidify your understanding of how selective ion transport establishes the very excitability that underlies all neural signaling ().",

            "problem": "A myelinated trigeminal nociceptor innervating the dental pulp maintains a steady resting membrane potential, defined as the transmembrane electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular compartments at steady state, when the net transmembrane ionic current is zero and the system satisfies electroneutrality. In an isothermal mammalian preparation at body temperature, this potential arises from selective permeability to ions and their concentration gradients. Consider a simplified bi-ionic membrane where chloride conductance is negligible at rest (assume $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx 0$), and only potassium and sodium contribute. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations are $[K^{+}]_{i} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[K^{+}]_{o} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[Na^{+}]_{i} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and $[Na^{+}]_{o} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.

Round your final numerical value to four significant figures and express it in millivolts (mV).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the resting membrane potential for a simplified neuronal membrane, considering only sodium ($Na^+$) and potassium ($K^+$) ions. The derivation begins from the fundamental principles of ion transport across a membrane under the influence of both concentration gradients and an electric field, as described by the Nernst-Planck equation.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation gives the flux density, $j_S$, of an ion species $S$ as a function of position $x$ across the membrane:\n$$j_S(x) = -D_S \\left( \\frac{dC_S(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_S F}{RT} C_S(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nHere, $D_S$ is the diffusion coefficient of the ion in the membrane, $C_S(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$, $z_S$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electrical potential.\n\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) framework is based on the constant-field assumption, which posits that the electric field, $E = -d\\phi/dx$, is constant across the thickness of the membrane, $L$. Therefore, we can write $d\\phi/dx = -\\frac{V_m}{L}$, where $V_m = \\phi_{in} - \\phi_{out}$ is the total membrane potential difference. Under this assumption, and assuming a steady-state where the flux $j_S$ is constant for each ion, the Nernst-Planck equation can be integrated across the membrane (from $x=0$ at the outside to $x=L$ at the inside). This integration yields the GHK current equation for each ion species. For a generic cation with valence $z_S=+1$, the outward current $I_S$ is given by:\n$$I_S = P_S \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[S]_i - [S]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}$$\nwhere $P_S$ is the membrane permeability of ion $S$, and $[S]_i$ and $[S]_o$ are the intracellular and extracellular concentrations, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that at the resting potential, the net transmembrane ionic current is zero. Since we are considering only potassium ($K^+$) and sodium ($Na^+$) ions (with $z_K = +1$ and $z_{Na} = +1$), the zero-current condition is:\n$$I_{net} = I_K + I_{Na} = 0$$\nSubstituting the GHK current equation for each ion:\n$$P_K \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[K^{+}]_i - [K^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)} + P_{Na} \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[Na^{+}]_i - [Na^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)} = 0$$\nAssuming a non-zero resting potential ($V_m \\neq 0$), we can cancel the common factor $\\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT(1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT))}$:\n$$P_K ([K^{+}]_i - [K^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)) + P_{Na} ([Na^{+}]_i - [Na^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)) = 0$$\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for $V_m$. First, we group terms with and without the exponential factor:\n$$P_K[K^{+}]_i + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_i = (P_K[K^{+}]_o + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_o) \\exp(-F V_m/RT)$$\nIsolating the exponential term gives:\n$$\\exp(-F V_m/RT) = \\frac{P_K[K^{+}]_i + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_i}{P_K[K^{+}]_o + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_o}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$- \\frac{F V_m}{RT} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^{+}]_i + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_i}{P_K[K^{+}]_o + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_o} \\right)$$\nFinally, solving for $V_m$ yields the derived form of the GHK voltage equation for this bi-ionic case:\n$$V_m = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^{+}]_i + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_i}{P_K[K^{+}]_o + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_o} \\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^{+}]_o + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_o}{P_K[K^{+}]_i + P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_i} \\right)$$\nTo facilitate computation, we can divide the numerator and denominator inside the logarithm by $P_K$:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[K^{+}]_o + (P_{Na}/P_K)[Na^{+}]_o}{[K^{+}]_i + (P_{Na}/P_K)[Na^{+}]_i} \\right)$$\nLet $\\alpha = P_{Na}/P_K$ be the ratio of sodium to potassium permeability.

The classification of peripheral nerve fibers into A-delta and C types, their respective myelination status (lightly myelinated vs. unmyelinated), and their role in mediating distinct pain qualities (sharp \"first pain\" vs. dull \"second pain\") are fundamental concepts. The provided conduction velocities, $v_{A\\delta} = 15 \\text{ m s}^{-1}$ and $v_{C} = 1 \\text{ m s}^{-1}$, are within the accepted physiological ranges for these fiber types. The specified length $L = 30 \\text{ mm}$ is anatomically plausible for the path from a premolar pulp to the trigeminal ganglion.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the requested latency difference using the fundamental kinematic relationship between distance, velocity, and time. The assumption that central delays are equal and cancel out creates a self-contained problem focused on peripheral conduction, leading to a unique solution.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition of velocity, which is the rate of change of position with respect to time. For constant velocity $v$, the time $t$ required to travel a distance $L$ is given by the relation:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nThis principle is applied to both the A-delta and C nerve fibers to determine their respective conduction times along the peripheral segment of length $L$.\n\nLet $t_{A\\delta}$ be the conduction time for an action potential to travel along an A-delta fiber, and let $t_{C}$ be the conduction time for a C fiber.\nUsing the formula above, we have:\n$$t_{A\\delta} = \\frac{L}{v_{A\\delta}}$$\n$$t_{C} = \\frac{L}{v_{C}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the latency difference, $\\Delta t$, between the arrival of the signals from the two fiber types at the trigeminal sensory nucleus. Since the problem states that central delays cancel, this difference is entirely determined by the peripheral conduction times. As $v_{A\\delta} > v_{C}$, the signal from the A-delta fiber will arrive first, meaning $t_{A\\delta}  t_{C}$. The latency difference is therefore:\n$$\\Delta t = t_{C} - t_{A\\delta}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{C}$ and $t_{A\\delta}$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{L}{v_{C}} - \\frac{L}{v_{A\\delta}} = L \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{C}} - \\frac{1}{v_{A\\delta}} \\right)$$\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $L = 30 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $v_{A\\delta} = 15 \\text{ m s}^{-1}$\n-   $v_{C} = 1 \\text{ m s}^{-1}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, all units must be converted to a standard system, such as the International System of Units (SI). We convert the length $L$ from millimeters to meters:\n$$L = 30 \\text{ mm} = 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} = 0.03 \\text{ m}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the individual conduction times:\n$$t_{A\\delta} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ m}}{15 \\text{ m s}^{-1}} = 0.002 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t_{C} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ m s}^{-1}} = 0.03 \\text{ s}$$\n\nThe latency difference $\\Delta t$ in seconds is:\n$$\\Delta t = 0.03 \\text{ s} - 0.002 \\text{ s} = 0.028 \\text{ s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in milliseconds (ms). We perform the unit conversion:\n$$1 \\text{ s} = 1000 \\text{ ms}$$\n$$\\Delta t = 0.028 \\text{ s} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ ms}}{1 \\text{ s}} = 28 \\text{ ms}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value of $28 \\text{ ms}$ already has exactly two significant figures ($2$ and $8$), so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n**Clinical Implication:**\nThe calculated latency difference of $\\Delta t = 28 \\text{ ms}$ is the physiological basis for the \"double pain\" sensation often reported in response to noxious stimulation of the dental pulp. The faster, lightly myelinated A-delta fibers mediate the initial, sharp, well-localized, lancinating pain, often termed \"first pain\". The slower, unmyelinated C fibers mediate the subsequent, dull, aching, throbbing, and more diffuse \"second pain\". Therefore, upon application of a brisk cold stimulus to a vital tooth, a patient will perceive a sharp pain sensation almost immediately (after a $2 \\text{ ms}$ peripheral delay), followed approximately $28 \\text{ ms}$ later by the onset of a lingering, dull ache. This distinct temporal separation of two pain qualities is a classic diagnostic sign in assessments of pulpal health.",
