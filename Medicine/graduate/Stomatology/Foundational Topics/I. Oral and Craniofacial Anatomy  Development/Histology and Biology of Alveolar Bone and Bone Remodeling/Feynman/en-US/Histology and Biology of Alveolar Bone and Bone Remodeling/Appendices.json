Provide the exact value; do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and definitions are explicitly provided in the problem statement:\n-   Interlabel time: $\\Delta t = 7\\ \\text{days}$.\n-   Mean interlabel distance: $\\Delta x = 12\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n-   Double-labeled bone surface length: $L_{d} = 3.2\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Single-labeled bone surface length: $L_{s} = 1.6\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Total bone surface referent length: $BS = 12.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Conceptual definition 1: Mineral apposition rate is quantified by the interlabel distance over the interlabel time.\n-   Conceptual definition 2: Bone formation rate per bone surface ($BFR/BS$) is the product of mineral apposition rate and the fraction of bone surface engaged in mineralization.\n-   Governing standard: American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) histomorphometry.\n-   Required output units: $\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{day}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the established, standard technique of dynamic bone histomorphometry using tetracycline labeling. All principles, terminology (e.g., mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate), and the experimental context (alveolar bone remodeling) are factually correct and central to the fields of bone biology and stomatology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary numerical data and a clear conceptual framework, including reference to ASBMR standards, to derive a unique solution for the requested quantity, $BFR/BS$.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness**: The data are self-contained and consistent. The presence of mixed units ($\\mu\\text{m}$ and $\\text{mm}$) is common in this type of problem and is resolvable through standard unit handling; it does not represent a contradiction. The mention of \"$n$ double-labeled sites\" without specifying the value of $n$ is not a flaw, as the mean interlabel distance $\\Delta x$ is provided directly, making the individual measurements and the sample size $n$ unnecessary for the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the bone formation rate per unit of bone surface, denoted as $BFR/BS$. The problem statement itself provides the conceptual equation:\n$$\n\\frac{BFR}{BS} = (\\text{Mineral Apposition Rate}) \\times (\\text{Fraction of forming surface})\n$$\nWe must formalize and calculate each term on the right-hand side using the provided data and standard histomorphometric definitions.\n\nFirst, we define and calculate the Mineral Apposition Rate ($MAR$). This is the rate of new bone matrix deposition at an active formation site. As specified in the problem, it is calculated from the mean distance between the two fluorescent labels divided by the time elapsed between their administration.\n$$\nMAR = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nGiven $\\Delta x = 12\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ and $\\Delta t = 7\\ \\text{days}$:\n$$\nMAR = \\frac{12\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{7\\ \\text{days}} = \\frac{12}{7}\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the \"fraction of forming surface\". In standard ASBMR terminology, this is the Mineralizing Surface per Bone Surface, denoted $MS/BS$. The mineralizing surface ($MS$) represents the total extent of the bone surface that is actively mineralizing during the observation period. According to the ASBMR guidelines for dynamic histomorphometry, the $MS$ is calculated by summing the double-labeled surface ($L_d$) and half of the single-labeled surface ($L_s$). The rationale for weighting the single-labeled surface by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is that, on average, these surfaces were active for only half of the inter-label period.\n$$\nMS = L_d + \\frac{1}{2}L_s\n$$\nThe fraction of forming surface is then this quantity normalized by the total bone surface referent length, $BS$.\n$$\n\\frac{MS}{BS} = \\frac{L_d + \\frac{1}{2}L_s}{BS}\n$$\nSubstituting the given length values: $L_{d} = 3.2\\ \\text{mm}$, $L_{s} = 1.6\\ \\text{mm}$, and $BS = 12.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n$$\n\\frac{MS}{BS} = \\frac{3.2\\ \\text{mm} + \\frac{1}{2}(1.6\\ \\text{mm})}{12.0\\ \\text{mm}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{MS}{BS} = \\frac{3.2\\ \\text{mm} + 0.8\\ \\text{mm}}{12.0\\ \\text{mm}} = \\frac{4.0\\ \\text{mm}}{12.0\\ \\text{mm}} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis fraction is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, we calculate the bone formation rate per bone surface, $BFR/BS$, by multiplying the two previously determined components.\n$$\n\\frac{BFR}{BS} = MAR \\times \\frac{MS}{BS}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $MAR$ and $MS/BS$:\n$$\n\\frac{BFR}{BS} = \\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{BFR}{BS} = \\frac{12}{21}\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}} = \\frac{4}{7}\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\nThe result is an exact value as requested, in the specified units of $\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{day}$.",
