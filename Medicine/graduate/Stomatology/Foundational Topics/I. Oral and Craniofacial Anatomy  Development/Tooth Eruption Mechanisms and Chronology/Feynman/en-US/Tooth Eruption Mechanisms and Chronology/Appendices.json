            "problem": "In a sex-matched cohort, the age at clinical emergence of the mandibular first permanent molars is treated as a quantitative developmental trait whose variability arises from the additive effects of many small, approximately independent biological factors, including rates of root elongation, dental follicle signaling, periodontal ligament traction, and alveolar bone remodeling. Under these assumptions, and invoking the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the distribution of observed eruption ages in the population is modeled as approximately normal with mean age $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. A standardized normal variable is defined as the unitless transformation of an observation that is centered by the population mean and scaled by the population dispersion measured by the Standard Deviation (SD). \n\nA child’s eruption was documented at age $7.0$ years for the mandibular first permanent molars. In the reference cohort, the sex-matched mean age of eruption is $6.2$ years with SD $0.6$ years. Using the definition of a standardized normal variable applied to this stomatologic chronology model, compute the Z-score of this child’s eruption age relative to the cohort. Express your answer as a unitless decimal and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for a standard statistical calculation. The premise of modeling a quantitative biological trait, such as the age of tooth eruption, with a normal distribution by invoking the Central Limit Theorem for the additive effects of numerous small factors is a standard and sound practice in biostatistics. The numerical values provided are realistic for the specified developmental milestone.\n\nThe task is to compute the Z-score for a given observation. Let the random variable $X$ denote the age at clinical emergence of the mandibular first permanent molars. The problem states that $X$ is approximately normally distributed with a population mean $\\mu$ and a population standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n\nThe given values from the reference cohort are:\n- Mean age, $\\mu = 6.2$ years.\n- Standard deviation, $\\sigma = 0.6$ years.\n\nThe specific observation for the child is:\n- Observed eruption age, $x = 7.0$ years.\n\nThe problem defines a standardized normal variable as \"the unitless transformation of an observation that is centered by the population mean and scaled by the population dispersion measured by the Standard Deviation (SD)\". This is the definition of a Z-score. The formula for the Z-score is:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\nThis formula quantifies how many standard deviations an observation $x$ is from the mean $\\mu$.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the formula:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{7.0 - 6.2}{0.6}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator, which is the deviation of the observation from the mean:\n$$\nx - \\mu = 7.0 - 6.2 = 0.8\n$$\nThe child's tooth eruption occurred $0.8$ years after the mean age of the reference cohort.\n\nNext, we scale this deviation by the standard deviation:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{0.8}{0.6}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $10$:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nTo express this value as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$\nZ = 1.3333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth significant figure is $3$. Since this digit is less than $5$, we do not round up the last kept digit.\n\nTherefore, the Z-score, rounded to four significant figures, is $1.333$. This is a dimensionless quantity, as the units of years in the numerator cancel with the units of years in the denominator, which is consistent with the problem's description of a \"unitless transformation\".",

This problem models the clinical outcome of ankylosis, where a tooth fuses to the bone and ceases to erupt while adjacent structures continue their vertical growth.

            "problem": "Ankylosis of a primary molar is characterized by loss of the periodontal ligament (PDL), mechanically coupling the tooth root to the alveolar bone and abolishing eruptive displacement. In contrast, the adjacent alveolar process in mixed dentition continues vertical appositional growth, driven by the functional matrix of the occlusion and soft tissues, which can be idealized kinematically by a constant vertical growth rate. Let $A(t)$ denote the vertical position of the adjacent alveolar crest relative to a fixed basal bone reference, and let $E(t)$ denote the vertical position of the occlusal surface of the ankylosed tooth relative to the same reference. At time $t=0$, suppose the occlusal plane of the ankylosed tooth is level with the adjacent occlusion, so the initial mismatch is zero. Assume the adjacent alveolar crest grows vertically at a constant rate $r$ with $r = 1.5$ millimeters per year, while the ankylosed tooth has negligible eruptive velocity (effectively zero) relative to basal bone. Using only the kinematic definition of velocity $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and conservation of relative motion between structures, derive from first principles an expression for the infraocclusion mismatch $\\Delta h(T)$ after a time interval $T$, defined as the vertical difference between $A(T)$ and $E(T)$ that accumulates from the initial condition.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Let $A(t)$ be the vertical position of the adjacent alveolar crest relative to a fixed basal bone reference.\n- Let $E(t)$ be the vertical position of the occlusal surface of the ankylosed tooth relative to the same reference.\n- At time $t=0$, the occlusal plane of the ankylosed tooth is level with the adjacent occlusion, implying the initial condition $A(0) = E(0)$.\n- The adjacent alveolar crest grows vertically at a constant rate $r$.\n- The value of the growth rate is $r = 1.5$ millimeters per year.\n- The ankylosed tooth has negligible eruptive velocity, which is taken to be zero relative to the basal bone.\n- The kinematic definition of velocity is given as $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n- The quantity to be derived is the infraocclusion mismatch $\\Delta h(T)$ after a time interval $T$.\n- The mismatch is defined as $\\Delta h(T) = A(T) - E(T)$.\n- The expression is to be evaluated for $T = 3$ years.\n- The final numerical answer must be in millimeters and rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of dental science (stomatology), specifically concerning tooth ankylosis and alveolar bone growth in mixed dentition. The described mechanism—fusion of the tooth root to bone, cessation of eruptive movement, and continued vertical growth of the adjacent alveolar process—is a correct and well-documented clinical phenomenon. The use of a constant growth rate is a standard and valid simplification for kinematic modeling. The value provided for alveolar growth, $r = 1.5$ mm/year, is biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides clear initial conditions ($A(0) = E(0)$), constant rates of change (velocities), and a precise definition for the quantity to be determined. All information required for a unique solution is present.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Flaw Analysis**: The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not metaphorical, is not incomplete or contradictory, does not propose unrealistic conditions, is not ill-posed, is not trivial, and is scientifically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe vertical velocity of the adjacent alveolar crest, $v_A$, is the time derivative of its position, $A(t)$. According to the problem statement, this velocity is a constant, $r$.\n$$\nv_A(t) = \\frac{dA}{dt} = r\n$$\nThe vertical velocity of the ankylosed tooth, $v_E$, is the time derivative of its position, $E(t)$. The problem states this velocity is effectively zero.\n$$\nv_E(t) = \\frac{dE}{dt} = 0\n$$\nTo find the position functions $A(t)$ and $E(t)$, we integrate these velocity equations with respect to time from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$.\n\nFor the adjacent alveolar crest position, $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} dA' = \\int_{0}^{t} r \\, dt'\n$$\nSince $r$ is a constant, the integration yields:\n$$\nA(t) - A(0) = r t\n$$\nThus, the position of the adjacent alveolar crest at time $t$ is:\n$$\nA(t) = A(0) + rt\n$$\nFor the ankylosed tooth position, $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{E(0)}^{E(t)} dE' = \\int_{0}^{t} 0 \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\nE(t) - E(0) = 0\n$$\nThus, the position of the ankylosed tooth remains constant:\n$$\nE(t) = E(0)\n$$\nThe infraocclusion mismatch, $\\Delta h(t)$, is defined as the vertical difference between the position of the adjacent alveolar crest and the ankylosed tooth's occlusal surface.\n$$\n\\Delta h(t) = A(t) - E(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $A(t)$ and $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta h(t) = (A(0) + rt) - E(0)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial condition that the occlusal planes are level at $t=0$, which means $A(0) = E(0)$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\Delta h(t) = (E(0) + rt) - E(0) = rt\n$$\nThis gives the general expression for the infraocclusion mismatch at any time $t$. We are asked to find the mismatch after a specific time interval $T$. Replacing $t$ with $T$, we obtain the required expression:\n$$\n\\Delta h(T) = rT\n$$\nThis expression is derived from first principles using the given kinematic definitions. Now, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $r = 1.5 \\, \\text{mm/year}$ and $T = 3 \\, \\text{years}$.\n$$\n\\Delta h(3) = (1.5 \\, \\text{mm/year}) \\times (3 \\, \\text{years})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta h(3) = 4.5 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value $4.5$ has two significant figures. To express it with three significant figures, we append a zero.\n$$\n\\Delta h(3) = 4.50 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$",

Assume a subject’s age $a$ (in years) has a prior that is uniform on the interval $[5,8]$.
