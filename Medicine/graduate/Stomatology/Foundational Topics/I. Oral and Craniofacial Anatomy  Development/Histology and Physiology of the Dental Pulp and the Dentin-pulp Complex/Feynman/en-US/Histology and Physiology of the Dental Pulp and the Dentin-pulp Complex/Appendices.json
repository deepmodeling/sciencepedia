The biological context, the hydrodynamic theory of dentin sensitivity, is a well-established and dominant theory in stomatology. The problem provides all necessary information to derive the required relationship and calculate the ratio, and it contains no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises. The stated values for tubule radii are physiologically realistic. The problem is directly relevant to the histology and physiology of the dentin-pulp complex.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem describes a steady, fully developed, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through a straight cylindrical tube. This is a classic fluid dynamics problem, the solution to which is the Hagen-Poiseuille flow profile. We will derive this from the fundamental governing equations.\n\nWe use a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, where the $z$-axis is aligned with the central axis of the tubule. The problem states the flow is steady and fully developed. This implies that the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ has only a $z$-component, and this component depends only on the radial position $r$. Thus, $\\vec{v} = v_z(r) \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe governing equation for the motion of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is the Navier-Stokes equation. In cylindrical coordinates, the $z$-component of the momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial t} + v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nGiven the assumptions:\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axial flow**: $v_r = 0$ and $v_\\theta = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile does not change along the $z$-axis, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n4.  **Axisymmetric flow**: The velocity does not depend on $\\theta$, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the left-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equation becomes zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dP}{dz} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) $$\nSince $v_z$ depends only on $r$ and $P$ depends only on $z$ (for a given $r$), the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ must be a constant. The problem defines a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a length $L$. We can write this constant pressure gradient as $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$. Substituting this into the simplified equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\mu L} $$\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\mu L} r $$\n$$ r\\frac{d v_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 $$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating again:\n$$ \\frac{d v_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\n$$ v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let the radius of the tubule be $R$.\n1.  The velocity must be finite at the centerline of the tubule ($r=0$). Since $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, we must have $C_1 = 0$ for the velocity to remain physically meaningful.\n2.  The no-slip boundary condition states that the fluid velocity is zero at the tubule wall ($r=R$). So, $v_z(R) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition with $C_1=0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot R^2}{4\\mu L} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity profile equation yields the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot R^2}{4\\mu L} - \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the tubule. The differential area element in cylindrical coordinates is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$ Q = \\int_A v_z(r) dA = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis gives the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\nFrom this equation, we see that the dependence of the volumetric flow rate $Q$ on the tubule radius $R$ is $Q \\propto R^4$, assuming the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$ and fluid viscosity $\\mu$ are constant.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $Q_A / Q_B$ for the two surfaces. Using the problem's notation where the radius is denoted by $r$:\n$$ Q_A = \\frac{\\pi r_A^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\n$$ Q_B = \\frac{\\pi r_B^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that $\\mu$, $L$, and $\\Delta P$ are identical for both tubules. Therefore, the ratio of the flow rates is:\n$$ \\frac{Q_A}{Q_B} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_A^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi r_B^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right)^4 $$\nSubstituting the given values $r_A = 0.6\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $r_B = 0.3\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_A}{Q_B} = \\left(\\frac{0.6}{0.3}\\right)^4 = (2)^4 = 16 $$\n\n## Discussion of Implications\n\nThe calculated ratio $Q_A/Q_B = 16$ demonstrates that the volumetric fluid flow through a dentinal tubule is exquisitely sensitive to its radius, scaling with the fourth power of the radius. A mere doubling of the tubule radius results in a sixteen-fold increase in fluid flow for a given pressure gradient. This has profound implications for dentin sensitivity, as explained by the hydrodynamic theory.\n\nThe hydrodynamic theory posits that dentin pain is initiated by the rapid movement of fluid within the dentinal tubules. External stimuli, such as thermal changes (causing expansion or contraction of the fluid), osmotic gradients (from sugary substances), or air blasts (causing evaporation and outward flow), create a pressure gradient across the length of the tubule, inducing fluid flow.\n\nThis fluid movement acts as a mechanical signal. The moving fluid exerts shear stress on and causes displacement of the odontoblast process, a cellular extension of the odontoblast that resides within the tubule. Odontoblasts are now recognized as sensory-receptor cells, not merely dentin-forming cells. Their membranes, as well as the membranes of closely associated afferent nerve terminals ($A\\delta$ fibers) in the pulp-dentin complex, are equipped with mechanosensitive ion channels, particularly from the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family.\n\nThe result $Q_A > Q_B$ signifies that for the same stimulus, the fluid flow in the wider tubules of surface A is vastly greater than in the narrower tubules of surface B. This amplified fluid movement in wider tubules translates into a much stronger mechanical stimulation (higher shear stress and greater displacement) of the odontoblast process and nerve endings. This stronger stimulus is more likely to surpass the activation threshold of the TRP channels. Activation of these channels leads to an influx of ions (e.g., $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$), depolarization of the cell membrane, release of neurotransmitters such as adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$) by the odontoblast, and ultimately the generation of an action potential in the associated $A\\delta$ nerve fiber. This signal is transmitted to the central nervous system and perceived as a sharp, well-localized pain.\n\nTherefore, dentin with wider, more patent tubules (like surface A) is predicted to be substantially more sensitive to hydrodynamic stimuli. This is consistent with clinical observations of dentin hypersensitivity, where the loss of protective enamel or cementum exposes dentin, and tubules are often pathologically widened. Conversely, treatments for hypersensitivity that aim to occlude or narrow the tubule orifices are effective precisely because they reduce the tubule radius, thereby drastically decreasing fluid flow according to the $Q \\propto r^4$ relationship, which diminishes the mechanical stimulus below the pain threshold.",

The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding the fourth digit up.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 0.1345$$\nThis result demonstrates that the acidification from inflammation substantially decreases the fraction of the membrane-permeant form of the anesthetic, which is the scientific basis for the reduced efficacy of local anesthetics in infected tissues.",
