This exercise provides a direct application of this principle, where the causal effect is estimated by dividing the genetic variant's association with the outcome by its association with the exposure . By working through this calculation, you will solidify your understanding of how summary-level data can be leveraged to infer causality under the core instrumental variable assumptions.",

            "problem": "A biostatistics team is conducting a one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on a binary disease outcome using a single genetic variant as an instrumental variable (IV). Let $G$ denote the number of effect alleles for a single nucleotide polymorphism, $X$ the standardized exposure (in standard deviation units), and $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ the disease indicator. The genetic association with the exposure is summarized as the regression coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GX}$ from a linear model of $X$ on $G$, and the genetic association with the outcome is summarized as the coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY}$ from a logistic regression of $Y$ on $G$, so $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY}$ is on the log-odds scale. Assume the instrumental variable core conditions (relevance, independence, and exclusion restriction) hold, and that the structural model for the outcome is additive on the log-odds scale in $X$. You are given $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GX} = 0.2$ (in standard deviation units of $X$ per effect allele) and $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY} = 0.04$ (in log-odds of $Y$ per effect allele).\n\nUsing only the above core definitions and modeling assumptions, compute the causal effect of a one standard deviation increase in $X$ on the log-odds of $Y$. Express your answer as a single real number on the log-odds scale. No rounding is required, and you should report the numerical value only, without units, but interpretability is per one standard deviation increase in the exposure on the log-odds scale for the outcome.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the estimation of the causal effect of an exposure, $X$, on a binary outcome, $Y$, using a genetic variant, $G$, as an instrumental variable (IV). This is a standard application of Mendelian randomization (MR). We are provided with the necessary estimates from a one-sample study context.\n\nLet $\\beta_{YX}$ represent the causal effect of a one standard deviation ($1$ SD) increase in the exposure $X$ on the log-odds of the disease outcome $Y$. The problem assumes a structural model that is additive on the log-odds scale for the outcome:\n$$ \\text{logit}(P(Y=1|X,U)) = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_{YX} X + f(U) $$\nHere, $\\text{logit}(p) = \\ln(p/(1-p))$, and $U$ represents all unmeasured confounders that may be associated with both $X$ and $Y$. The objective is to estimate $\\beta_{YX}$.\n\nThe genetic variant $G$ is used as an instrumental variable. For $G$ to be a valid instrument, it must satisfy three core conditions, which are stated to hold in the problem:\n1.  **Relevance:** The instrument $G$ must be associated with the exposure $X$. This relationship is quantified by the coefficient $\\gamma_{GX}$ from the regression of $X$ on $G$. The model is $E[X|G] = \\beta_{X0} + \\gamma_{GX} G$. We are given the estimate $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GX} = 0.2$. This value means that each additional effect allele of the variant $G$ is associated with a $0.2$ standard deviation increase in the exposure $X$.\n2.  **Independence:** The instrument $G$ must be independent of any unmeasured confounders $U$ that affect both $X$ and $Y$. This assumption, $G \\perp U$, is crucial because it ensures that any association between $G$ and $Y$ is not due to confounding.\n3.  **Exclusion Restriction:** The instrument $G$ affects the outcome $Y$ only through its effect on the exposure $X$. There is no direct causal pathway from $G$ to $Y$ that bypasses $X$.\n\nUnder these three assumptions, the association between the genetic instrument $G$ and the outcome $Y$ can be used to infer the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$. The association between $G$ and $Y$ is given by the coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY}$ from a logistic regression of $Y$ on $G$:\n$$ \\text{logit}(P(Y=1|G)) = \\beta_{Y0} + \\gamma_{GY} G $$\nWe are given the estimate $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY} = 0.04$, which represents the change in the log-odds of disease $Y$ per additional effect allele of $G$.\n\nThe exclusion restriction principle implies that the total effect of $G$ on the log-odds of $Y$ is mediated entirely through $X$. This allows us to decompose the association $\\gamma_{GY}$ as the product of the effect of $G$ on $X$ and the causal effect of $X$ on the log-odds of $Y$. This can be visualized as a causal chain: $G \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y$.\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$ \\gamma_{GY} = \\gamma_{GX} \\cdot \\beta_{YX} $$\nThis equation holds exactly under a system of linear models with no interaction, and it provides a consistent estimator for $\\beta_{YX}$ in the context of a logistic outcome model, particularly when the genetic effects are modest, which is common. The estimator for the causal effect $\\beta_{YX}$ is obtained by rearranging this equation. This specific form of the IV estimator is known as the Wald ratio.\n\nThe estimate of the causal effect, $\\hat{\\beta}_{YX}$, is therefore the ratio of the genetic association with the outcome to the genetic association with the exposure:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{YX} = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY}}{\\hat{\\gamma}_{GX}} $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GX} = 0.2$ (SD units of $X$ per effect allele)\n-   $\\hat{\\gamma}_{GY} = 0.04$ (log-odds of $Y$ per effect allele)\n\nSubstituting these values into the Wald ratio formula:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{YX} = \\frac{0.04}{0.2} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{YX} = \\frac{4/100}{2/10} = \\frac{4}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{2} = \\frac{40}{200} = \\frac{1}{5} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{YX} = 0.2 $$\nThe resulting value of $0.2$ is the estimated causal effect of a one standard deviation increase in the exposure $X$ on the log-odds of the disease $Y$. The units are (log-odds of $Y$)/ (SD of $X$), which is precisely what the problem requires.",

            "introduction": "A crucial step in any instrumental variable analysis is to ensure the instrument is sufficiently strong, as weak instruments can lead to biased results.

            "problem": "A Mendelian randomization (MR) study uses a single genetic variant, a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), as an Instrumental Variable (IV) to estimate the causal effect of an exposure $X$ on an outcome $Y$. The instrument relevance is assessed through the first-stage regression of $X$ on the instrument $Z$ using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in a large sample, specified as $X = \\pi Z + \\eta$, where $\\pi$ is the instrument-exposure effect and $\\eta$ is the disturbance term.\n\nYou are given the estimated first-stage coefficient $\\hat{\\pi} = 0.05$ and its standard error $SE(\\hat{\\pi}) = 0.02$.

Then, using accepted practice in instrumental variable analysis, determine whether the instrument would be considered strong under the rule-of-thumb threshold. No rounding is required; report the $F$ statistic as an exact value. The final answer must be the single numeric value of the $F$ statistic (unitless).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the $F$-statistic for testing the relevance of the instrumental variable $Z$. The null hypothesis for this test is that the instrument has no association with the exposure, which is specified as $H_{0} : \\pi = 0$ in the first-stage regression model $X = \\pi Z + \\eta$.\n\nIn a linear regression model, the test for a single linear restriction on a single coefficient is most directly conducted using a $t$-statistic. The $t$-statistic is defined as the ratio of the estimated coefficient to its standard error, centered around the value of the coefficient under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe general form of the $t$-statistic for testing $H_{0} : \\pi = \\pi_{0}$ is:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\hat{\\pi} - \\pi_{0}}{SE(\\hat{\\pi})} $$\nIn this specific problem, the null hypothesis is $H_{0} : \\pi = 0$, so $\\pi_{0} = 0$. The $t$-statistic simplifies to:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\hat{\\pi}}{SE(\\hat{\\pi})} $$\nA fundamental principle in the theory of linear models is the relationship between the $t$-statistic and the $F$-statistic. For a test involving a single linear restriction (in this case, $k=1$ restriction, which is $\\pi=0$), the $F$-statistic is exactly the square of the corresponding $t$-statistic. This holds true for large samples, an assumption given in the problem statement.\n$$ F = t^2 $$\nThis relationship constitutes the derivation from first principles requested by the problem, as it links the fundamental test for a single parameter ($t$-test) to the more general framework of the $F$-test for linear restrictions.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of the test statistic using the provided estimates.\nGiven:\n- Estimated coefficient: $\\hat{\\pi} = 0.05$\n- Standard error of the coefficient: $SE(\\hat{\\pi}) = 0.02$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the $t$-statistic:\n$$ t = \\frac{0.05}{0.02} = 2.5 $$\nNext, we use the relationship $F = t^2$ to find the $F$-statistic:\n$$ F = (2.5)^2 = 6.25 $$\nThe calculated $F$-statistic for testing instrument relevance is $6.25$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to determine if the instrument would be considered strong. In instrumental variable analysis, a common rule-of-thumb, originating from the work of Staiger and Stock (1997), is used to assess instrument strength. According to this convention, an instrument is considered \"weak\" if the first-stage $F$-statistic is less than $10$. Weak instruments can lead to biased and imprecise causal estimates in the second stage of the analysis.\n\nIn this case, the computed $F$-statistic is $6.25$. Since $6.25  10$, the single SNP instrument would be classified as a weak instrument under this widely accepted threshold. This suggests that the study may suffer from weak instrument bias.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the $F$-statistic.",
