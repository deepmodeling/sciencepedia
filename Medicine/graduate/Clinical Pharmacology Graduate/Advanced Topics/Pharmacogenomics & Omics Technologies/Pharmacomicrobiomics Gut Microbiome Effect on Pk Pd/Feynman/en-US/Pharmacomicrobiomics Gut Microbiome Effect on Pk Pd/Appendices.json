            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a derivation from first principles, a re-expression in terms of standard kinetic parameters, and a numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Rate Law from First Principles**\n\nThe reaction mechanism is given as:\n$$E + S \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} E + P$$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the initial reaction velocity $v$, defined as the rate of product formation, is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$:\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [ES]$$\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the $ES$ complex is given by its rate of formation minus its rates of breakdown:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES]$$\n\nWe apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA), which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant after a short initial period, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n$$k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_t$, is conserved and is the sum of the free enzyme $[E]$ and the complexed enzyme $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_t = [E] + [ES]$$\nThus, the concentration of free enzyme is $[E] = [E]_t - [ES]$.\n\nSubstitute this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$k_1 ([E]_t - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\n\nNow, we solve for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side gives:\n$$k_1 [E]_t [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\nGroup all terms containing $[ES]$ on one side:\n$$k_1 [E]_t [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] + k_1 [ES][S]$$\nFactor out $[ES]$:\n$$k_1 [E]_t [S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S])$$\nIsolate $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_t [S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]}$$\n\nTo simplify, divide the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_t [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]}$$\n\nFinally, substitute this expression for $[ES]$ into the equation for the velocity $v = k_2[ES]$, and replace $[S]$ with $C$ as defined in the problem:\n$$v = \\frac{k_2 [E]_t C}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + C}$$\nThis is the expression for the initial velocity $v$ in terms of the total enzyme concentration $[E]_t$, the microscopic rate constants $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, $k_2$, and the substrate concentration $C$.\n\n**Part 2: Re-expression using $V_{\\max}$ and $K_m$**\n\nWe now introduce the standard composite kinetic parameters.\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is defined as the reaction rate when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. Under this condition, $[ES] \\approx [E]_t$, so the velocity becomes:\n$$V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_t$$\n\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the following combination of microscopic rate constants:\n$$K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$$\n\nSubstituting these two definitions, $V_{\\max}$ and $K_m$, into the derived rate equation from Part 1:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_m + C}$$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which expresses the initial velocity $v$ as a function of $V_{\\max}$, $K_m$, and $C$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $V_{\\max} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$\n- $K_{m} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $C = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation. The concentration units ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) are consistent and will cancel.\n$$v = \\frac{(2\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}) \\times (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) + (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}$$\n$$v = \\frac{2 \\times 100}{50 + 100} \\, \\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$$\n$$v = \\frac{200}{150} \\, \\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$$\n$$v = \\frac{4}{3} \\, \\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$v \\approx 1.3333... \\, \\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$$\n$$v \\approx 1.333 \\, \\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$$\n\nThe calculated initial velocity is $1.333\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$.",

The xenobiotic exhibits high passive permeability across the intestinal epithelium, negligible transporter effects, and linear (non-saturable) biotransformation. The intestinal organ is supplied by a constant intestinal blood flow $Q_{gut}$, and within the organ, the xenobiotic is removed by two independent (parallel) intrinsic pathways: microbial biotransformation in the lumen with intrinsic clearance $CL_{int,mb}$ and enterocyte (host) metabolism with intrinsic clearance $CL_{int,int}$. Assume the fraction unbound in the gut (enterocyte/lumen) is $f_{u,g}=1$, the organ is well-stirred so that the concentration is spatially uniform and equal to the portal venous outflow concentration at steady state, and that absorption is sufficiently rapid such that the inflowing concentration driving the mass balance can be treated as the concentration entering the intestinal organ from the lumen.\n\nStarting from a steady-state mass balance for a well-stirred organ, derive an expression for the fraction of drug escaping first-pass intestinal elimination and reaching the portal circulation, $F_{g}$, in terms of $Q_{gut}$, $f_{u,g}$, and the total intrinsic intestinal clearance $CL_{int,g}$, where $CL_{int,g}$ arises from the parallel sum of microbial and enterocyte intrinsic clearances, i.e., $CL_{int,g}=CL_{int,mb}+CL_{int,int}$.
