Compute the required dose per administration in milligrams.\n\nRound your final numeric dose to three significant figures. Express the final dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$ per administration (every $12~\\mathrm{h}$).",
            "solution": "The derivation proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Dosing Algorithm**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in relating the dose $D$ to the resulting steady-state concentration. The problem provides that for linear pharmacokinetics, the average plasma concentration $C_{p,\\mathrm{avg}}$ is proportional to the dose rate, $\\frac{D}{\\tau}$, divided by the systemic clearance, $CL$.\n$$C_{p,\\mathrm{avg}} \\propto \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nSince the oral bioavailability $F$ and dosing interval $\\tau$ are assumed to be constant across patients, this simplifies to $C_{p,\\mathrm{avg}} \\propto \\frac{D}{CL}$. For a system exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, all steady-state concentration measures (average, peak, trough) are directly proportional to the dose rate. Therefore, the steady-state plasma trough concentration, $C_{p,\\text{trough}}$, is also proportional to $\\frac{D}{CL}$.\n\nThe problem measures concentration in whole blood ($C_b$) rather than plasma ($C_p$). The relationship between them is given by the hematocrit-dependent partitioning equation:\n$$C_{b} = C_{p} \\left[(1 - H) + \\Pi H\\right]$$\nwhere $H$ is the hematocrit and $\\Pi$ is the erythrocyte-to-plasma concentration ratio. This relationship holds at any time point, including at trough. Thus, for the steady-state trough concentration in whole blood, $C_{b,\\text{trough}}$:\n$$C_{b,\\text{trough}} = C_{p,\\text{trough}} \\left[(1 - H) + \\Pi H\\right]$$\nSubstituting the proportionality for $C_{p,\\text{trough}}$, we establish a relationship for the measured whole blood trough concentration (which we will denote as $C_b$ for simplicity):\n$$C_{b} \\propto \\frac{D}{CL} \\left[(1 - H) + \\Pi H\\right]$$\nLet's introduce a constant of proportionality $k$ which incorporates fixed factors like $F$, $\\tau$, and drug-specific kinetic parameters.\n$$C_{b} = k \\frac{D}{CL} \\left[1 + (\\Pi - 1)H\\right]$$\nThis is our general model. We can now write this equation for the reference patient (subscript $0$) and a new patient (for whom we want to find the dose $D$ to achieve a target concentration $C_{b}^{\\ast}$).\n\nFor the reference patient:\n$$C_{b,0} = k \\frac{D_0}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} \\left[1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0\\right]$$\nFor the new patient:\n$$C_{b}^{\\ast} = k \\frac{D}{CL_{\\text{new}}} \\left[1 + (\\Pi - 1)H\\right]$$\nTo eliminate the unknown constant $k$, we take the ratio of the new patient's equation to the reference patient's equation:\n$$\\frac{C_{b}^{\\ast}}{C_{b,0}} = \\frac{k \\frac{D}{CL_{\\text{new}}} \\left[1 + (\\Pi - 1)H\\right]}{k \\frac{D_0}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} \\left[1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0\\right]} = \\frac{D}{D_0} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{ref}}}{CL_{\\text{new}}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H}{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0}$$\nNext, we must define the clearances $CL_{\\text{ref}}$ and $CL_{\\text{new}}$. The systemic clearance $CL$ is a function of the baseline clearance in a CYP3A5 non-expresser ($CL_0$), the effect of CYP3A5 expression status ($\\phi_{\\mathrm{CYP}}$), and the effect of any CYP3A inhibitors ($\\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}$):\n$$CL = CL_0 \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathrm{CYP}} \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}$$\nThe reference patient is a CYP3A5 non-expresser ($\\phi_{\\mathrm{CYP}} = 1$) and is not on a CYP3A inhibitor (implying $\\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 1$). Therefore, their clearance is:\n$$CL_{\\text{ref}} = CL_0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = CL_0$$\nThe new patient is a CYP3A5 expresser ($\\phi_{\\mathrm{CYP}} = \\lambda$) and is taking a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (with effect $\\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}$). Their clearance is:\n$$CL_{\\text{new}} = CL_0 \\cdot \\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}$$\nThe ratio of clearances is then:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\text{ref}}}{CL_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{CL_0}{CL_0 \\cdot \\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}}$$\nSubstituting this clearance ratio back into our main ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{C_{b}^{\\ast}}{C_{b,0}} = \\frac{D}{D_0} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H}{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0}$$\nFinally, we solve for the required dose $D$ for the new patient. This provides the closed-form expression requested.\n$$D = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{C_{b}^{\\ast}}{C_{b,0}} \\cdot (\\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}) \\cdot \\frac{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0}{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H}$$\nThis expression allows for the calculation of a personalized tacrolimus dose based on a reference regimen, adjusting for differences in pharmacogenomic status (CYP3A5), drug-drug interactions (CYP3A inhibition), and a key physiological variable (hematocrit).\n\n**Part 2: Application to the New Patient**\n\nWe now apply the derived formula to calculate the dose for the specific patient described. The given parameters are:\n- Reference dose: $D_0 = 2~\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Reference whole blood trough concentration: $C_{b,0} = 8~\\mathrm{ng/mL}$\n- Reference hematocrit: $H_0 = 0.40$\n- Target whole blood trough concentration: $C_{b}^{\\ast} = 8~\\mathrm{ng/mL}$\n- New patient's hematocrit: $H = 0.30$\n- RBC partition ratio: $\\Pi = 8$\n- CYP3A5 expresser factor: $\\lambda = 1.8$\n- CYP3A inhibition factor: $\\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0.7$\n\nFirst, we can see that the target concentration is the same as the reference concentration, so the ratio $\\frac{C_{b}^{\\ast}}{C_{b,0}} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$D = D_0 \\cdot (\\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}}) \\cdot \\frac{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0}{1 + (\\Pi - 1)H}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression.\nThe clearance adjustment factor is the product of the genetic and inhibition factors:\n$$\\lambda \\cdot \\psi_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 1.8 \\cdot 0.7 = 1.26$$\nThe hematocrit-partitioning term for the reference patient is:\n$$1 + (\\Pi - 1)H_0 = 1 + (8 - 1)(0.40) = 1 + 7(0.40) = 1 + 2.8 = 3.8$$\nThe hematocrit-partitioning term for the new patient is:\n$$1 + (\\Pi - 1)H = 1 + (8 - 1)(0.30) = 1 + 7(0.30) = 1 + 2.1 = 3.1$$\nNow, substitute all these components into the dose formula:\n$$D = 2~\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot (1.26) \\cdot \\frac{3.8}{3.1}$$\n$$D = 2.52~\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\frac{3.8}{3.1}$$\n$$D \\approx 3.089032...~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final dose to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D \\approx 3.09~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe required dose for the new patient to achieve the target trough concentration is $3.09~\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours.",
