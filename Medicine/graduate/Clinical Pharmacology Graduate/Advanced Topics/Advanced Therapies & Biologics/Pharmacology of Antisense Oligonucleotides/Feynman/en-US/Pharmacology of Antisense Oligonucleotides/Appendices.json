The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a linear pharmacokinetic system where the principle of superposition applies. Let $C_0$ represent the increase in concentration immediately following the administration of a single dose. Thus, the concentration immediately after the first dose, administered at time $t=0$, is $C_{1,max} = C_0$.\n\nFor a first-order elimination process, the concentration $C(t)$ remaining at time $t$ from this single dose is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nDoses are administered at a fixed interval $\\tau$. The peak concentration at steady-state, $C_{ss,max}$, occurs immediately after a dose is given, once the system has reached equilibrium. This concentration is the sum of the concentration from the dose just administered ($C_0$) and the residual concentrations from all previous doses.\n\nThe contribution from the dose given at time $t=0$ will be $C_0 \\exp(-n k \\tau)$ at time $t=n\\tau$.\nThe contribution from the dose given at time $t=\\tau$ will be $C_0 \\exp(-(n-1) k \\tau)$ at time $t=n\\tau$.\n...\nThe contribution from the dose given at time $t=(n-1)\\tau$ will be $C_0 \\exp(-k \\tau)$ at time $t=n\\tau$.\n\nAt steady state, which is mathematically equivalent to considering an infinite number of prior doses (as $n \\to \\infty$), the immediate post-dose concentration $C_{ss,max}$ is the sum of contributions from the current dose and all preceding doses:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_0 + C_0 \\exp(-k\\tau) + C_0 \\exp(-2k\\tau) + C_0 \\exp(-3k\\tau) + \\dots$$\nThis can be written as a series:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-nk\\tau) = C_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (\\exp(-k\\tau))^n$$\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term $a = C_0$ and the common ratio $r = \\exp(-k\\tau)$. Since $k > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the common ratio $r$ is in the range $0 < r < 1$, so the series converges. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by $\\frac{a_{first}}{1-r}$, where $a_{first}$ is the first term of the series. Here, the first term of the sum operator is $1$, so we have:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\right)$$\n\nThe accumulation ratio $R$ is defined as the ratio of the immediate post-dose steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,max}$, to the immediate post-dose concentration following the very first dose, $C_{1,max}$.\n$$R = \\frac{C_{ss,max}}{C_{1,max}} = \\frac{C_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\right)}{C_0} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}$$\nThis is the standard formula for the accumulation ratio for peak concentrations in a one-compartment model.\n\nThe problem provides the terminal half-life, $t_{1/2}$, which is related to the elimination rate constant $k$ by the fundamental equation for first-order processes:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nFrom this, we can express $k$ as:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into the equation for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\tau\\right)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $t_{1/2} = 21$ days and $\\tau = 7$ days.\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{21} \\cdot 7\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3}\\right)}$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(a \\ln(b)) = \\exp(\\ln(b^a)) = b^a$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-1/3}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-1/3}}$$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we compute $2^{-1/3}$ and then $R$:\n$$2^{-1/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.25992105} \\approx 0.79370053$$\nNow, substitute this value into the expression for $R$:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - 0.79370053} = \\frac{1}{0.20629947} \\approx 4.8473221$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 4.847$$\nThe result is a dimensionless number, as expected for a ratio of concentrations.",

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for fractional occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $C$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. We are given the following definitions:\n1. Equilibrium dissociation constant: $K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2. Fractional occupancy: $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$\n3. Constant free ASO concentration: $[L] = C$\n\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express the free mRNA binding site concentration, $[R]$, in terms of the other variables:\n$$[R] = K_d \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of fractional occupancy, $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{K_d \\frac{[RL]}{[L]} + [RL]}$$\nThe concentration of the complex, $[RL]$, is a common factor in the denominator and also appears in the numerator. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[RL]$ (assuming $[RL] \\ne 0$, which is true for any non-zero total concentration of reactants):\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nThe problem states that the free ASO concentration $[L]$ is a constant, $C$. Substituting $[L] = C$ into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{C} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $C$:\n$$f = \\frac{C}{C \\left( \\frac{K_d}{C} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{C}{K_d + C}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to find the fold-change in occupancy, $F = \\frac{f^{\\mathrm{mis}}}{f^{(0)}}$, due to a mismatch. We apply the derived formula for $f$ to both the perfect-match and mismatch cases.\n\nFor the perfect-match case, the dissociation constant is $K_d^{(0)}$, and the fractional occupancy is $f^{(0)}$:\n$$f^{(0)} = \\frac{C}{K_d^{(0)} + C}$$\nFor the mismatch case, the dissociation constant is $K_d^{\\mathrm{mis}}$, and the fractional occupancy is $f^{\\mathrm{mis}}$:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{mis}} = \\frac{C}{K_d^{\\mathrm{mis}} + C}$$\nWe are given that the mismatch increases the dissociation constant by a factor of $10$, so $K_d^{\\mathrm{mis}} = 10\\,K_d^{(0)}$. Substituting this into the expression for $f^{\\mathrm{mis}}$:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{mis}} = \\frac{C}{10\\,K_d^{(0)} + C}$$\nNow, we can compute the fold-change $F$ by taking the ratio of $f^{\\mathrm{mis}}$ to $f^{(0)}$:\n$$F = \\frac{f^{\\mathrm{mis}}}{f^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\frac{C}{10\\,K_d^{(0)} + C}}{\\frac{C}{K_d^{(0)} + C}}$$\nThe term $C$ in the numerator of both fractions cancels out:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10\\,K_d^{(0)} + C}}{\\frac{1}{K_d^{(0)} + C}}$$\nInverting the denominator and multiplying gives the final expression for the fold-change $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{K_d^{(0)} + C}{10\\,K_d^{(0)} + C}$$\nThis expression is in terms of only $C$ and $K_d^{(0)}$, as required by the problem statement.",

The Central Dogma states that DNA is transcribed to mRNA, which is translated into protein.

Calculate $K_{\\max}(C) = \\frac{E_{\\max}\\, C^h}{EC_{50}^h + C^h}$. Watch for the special case of $C=0$, where $C^h$ should be handled as $0$ for $h>0$. Numerically, if $C=0$ or $E_{\\max}=0$, then $K_{\\max}(C)=0$.\n2.  If $K_{\\max}(C) = 0$, set $t_{90} = +\\infty$.\n3.  If $K_{\\max}(C) > 0$, calculate $t_{90} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}$.\nThe units of $t_{1/2}$ are given in hours, so $t_{90}$ will be in hours as required. $K_{\\max}(C)$ is a dimensionless fraction.",
