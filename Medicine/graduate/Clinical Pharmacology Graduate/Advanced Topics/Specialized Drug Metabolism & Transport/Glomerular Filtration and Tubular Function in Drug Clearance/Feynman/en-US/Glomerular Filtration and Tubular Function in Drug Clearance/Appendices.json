            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the filtration clearance of a drug and the computation of its numerical value based on provided definitions and parameters. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in principles of pharmacokinetics and renal physiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental definition of clearance ($\\text{CL}$), which is the volume of plasma cleared of a substance per unit time. For a specific elimination process, it is defined as the rate of elimination by that process divided by the total plasma concentration of the drug ($C_p$).\n$$\n\\text{CL} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Elimination}}{C_p}\n$$\nIn this case, the drug is eliminated *only* by glomerular filtration. Therefore, the rate of elimination is the rate of filtration. We denote the filtration clearance as $\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}}$.\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Filtration}}{C_p}\n$$\nThe rate of filtration is the mass of drug entering Bowman's space per unit time. This is the product of the drug's concentration in the glomerular filtrate ($C_{\\text{filtrate}}$) and the volume of filtrate formed per unit time, which is the glomerular filtration rate ($\\text{GFR}$). The GFR is given as $100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Filtration} = C_{\\text{filtrate}} \\times \\text{GFR}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must express $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ in terms of $C_p$. The problem provides two core definitions for this purpose. First, the glomerular sieving coefficient, $\\theta=0.90$, relates the filtrate concentration to the unbound plasma concentration ($C_u$):\n$$\nC_{\\text{filtrate}} = \\theta\\,C_u\n$$\nSecond, the fraction unbound in plasma, $f_u=0.20$, relates the unbound plasma concentration to the total plasma concentration ($C_p$):\n$$\nC_u = f_u\\,C_p\n$$\nBy substituting the second equation into the first, we can relate $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ directly to $C_p$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{filtrate}} = \\theta\\,(f_u\\,C_p) = \\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ into the equation for the rate of filtration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Filtration} = (\\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p) \\times \\text{GFR}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this rate of filtration back into the definition of filtration clearance:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\frac{\\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p\\,\\text{GFR}}{C_p}\n$$\nThe total plasma concentration term, $C_p$, cancels from the numerator and denominator. This yields the derived expression for filtration clearance:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\theta\\,f_u\\,\\text{GFR}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that filtration clearance is determined by the interplay of three factors: the intrinsic filtration capacity of the kidneys ($\\text{GFR}$), the extent of drug binding to plasma proteins ($f_u$), and the degree of hindrance the drug encounters at the glomerular filtration barrier ($\\theta$).\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we substitute the given parameters into this derived expression:\n- $\\text{GFR} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n- $f_u = 0.20$\n- $\\theta = 0.90$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = (0.90) \\times (0.20) \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = 0.18 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, the value is $18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nFor the interpretation, we consider the hypothetical case where size and charge do not hinder filtration. In this scenario, the drug would be \"freely filtered,\" meaning its concentration in the filtrate would be equal to the unbound concentration in plasma. This corresponds to a sieving coefficient $\\theta = 1$. The clearance for this ideal case would be:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{ideal}} = (1) \\times f_u \\times \\text{GFR} = f_u\\,\\text{GFR}\n$$\nThis quantity, $f_u\\,\\text{GFR}$, represents the clearance of the unbound drug and is the theoretical maximum clearance achievable by filtration alone for a given level of plasma protein binding. For the drug in this problem, the ideal filtration clearance would be:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{ideal}} = 0.20 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\nThe actual calculated filtration clearance is $18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The sieving coefficient $\\theta = 0.90$ signifies a $10\\%$ reduction in filtration efficiency compared to a freely filtered substance. This means the glomerular barrier imposes a slight restriction on the drug's passage, causing the actual clearance ($18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$) to be $90\\%$ of the maximum possible filtration clearance for this drug ($20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$). This hindrance is likely due to the drug's molecular size, shape, or electrostatic interactions, even though it is described as neutral.",

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the $pH$ of the solution, the acid dissociation constant ($pK_a$), and the concentrations of the ionized and unionized species:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\nwhere $[A^-]$ is the molar concentration of the ionized form and $[HA]$ is the molar concentration of the unionized form.\n\nThe fraction unionized, $\\alpha$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the unionized form to the total drug concentration, $C_T = [HA] + [A^-]$.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[HA]}{C_T} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$$\nTo express $\\alpha$ in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we first rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$:\n$$pH - pK_a = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{pH - pK_a}$$\nNow, we can substitute this ratio into the expression for $\\alpha$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\nThe problem provides the values $pH=6.5$ and $pK_a=4.5$.

Let $x$ be the distance along the tubule, from $x=0$ (inlet) to $x=L$ (outlet). Let $C_T(x)$ be the total drug concentration in the luminal fluid at position $x$. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ is constant.\n\nThe mass balance for the drug over a differential segment of length $dx$ is:\n(Rate of mass in) - (Rate of mass out) - (Rate of mass reabsorbed) = $0$\n$$Q C_T(x) - Q C_T(x+dx) - d\\dot{m}_{reab} = 0$$\nUsing the first-order Taylor expansion $C_T(x+dx) \\approx C_T(x) + \\frac{dC_T}{dx}dx$, the equation becomes:\n$$-Q \\frac{dC_T}{dx}dx - d\\dot{m}_{reab} = 0$$\nThe rate of reabsorption, $d\\dot{m}_{reab}$, occurs via passive diffusion of the unionized species, governed by Fick's first law. The flux, $J$, across the tubular epithelium is:\n$$J = P_u (C_u^{lumen} - C_u^{blood})$$\nwhere $P_u$ is the permeability of the unionized form, $C_u^{lumen}$ is its concentration in the lumen, and $C_u^{blood}$ is its concentration in the peritubular blood.\nWe are given that the blood is an infinite sink, so $C_u^{blood} = 0$. The luminal concentration of the unionized form is $C_u^{lumen} = \\alpha C_T(x)$.\n$$J = P_u \\alpha C_T(x)$$\nThe differential rate of reabsorption is the flux multiplied by the differential surface area, $dA$. Assuming the total area $A$ is distributed uniformly over the length $L$, $dA = \\frac{A}{L}dx$.\n$$d\\dot{m}_{reab} = J \\cdot dA = \\left(P_u \\alpha C_T(x)\\right) \\left(\\frac{A}{L}dx\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation:\n$$-Q \\frac{dC_T}{dx}dx - P_u \\alpha C_T(x) \\frac{A}{L}dx = 0$$\nDividing by $dx$ yields the ordinary differential equation:\n$$Q \\frac{dC_T}{dx} = - \\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{L} C_T(x)$$\nSeparating variables:\n$$\\frac{dC_T}{C_T} = -\\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q L} dx$$\nWe integrate this equation along the length of the segment. Let $C_{T,in}$ be the concentration at $x=0$ and $C_{T,out}$ be the concentration at $x=L$:\n$$\\int_{C_{T,in}}^{C_{T,out}} \\frac{dC_T}{C_T} = -\\int_0^L \\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q L} dx$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{T,out}}{C_{T,in}}\\right) = -\\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q L} [x]_0^L = -\\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q}$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the fraction of drug remaining in the lumen:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,out}}{C_{T,in}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q}\\right)$$\nThe fraction of drug reabsorbed, $f_{reab}$, is $1$ minus the fraction remaining:\n$$f_{reab} = 1 - \\frac{C_{T,out}}{C_{T,in}} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{P_u A \\alpha}{Q}\\right)$$\nThis expression relates the fraction reabsorbed to $\\alpha$, $P_u$, $A$, and $Q$, as required.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation of Reabsorption\n\nWe now compute the numerical value for the fraction reabsorbed using the derived formula and the given data. First, we must ensure all parameters are in consistent units. We will use centimeters (cm) for length and seconds (s) for time.\n\nGiven parameters:\n$P_u = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$\n$A = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$\n$Q = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{101}$\n\nThe product $P_u A$ represents the clearance of the unionized drug across the epithelium:\n$$P_u A = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2) = 10.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe luminal flow rate $Q$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ to $\\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$.
