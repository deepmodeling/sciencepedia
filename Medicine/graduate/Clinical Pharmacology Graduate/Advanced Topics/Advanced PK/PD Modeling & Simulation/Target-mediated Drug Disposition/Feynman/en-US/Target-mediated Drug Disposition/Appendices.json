A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the target occupancy fraction, defined as $\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$, using first principles. The starting point is the law of mass action applied to the binding equilibrium at steady state.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is given by:\n$$D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$$\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association ($k_{\\text{on}} D R$) equals the rate of dissociation ($k_{\\text{off}} DR$), where the symbols represent concentrations as specified in the problem statement.\n$$k_{\\text{on}} D R = k_{\\text{off}} DR$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant, $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$. Rearranging the equilibrium equation, we get:\n$$K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{D \\cdot R}{DR}$$\nThis equation provides a relationship between the concentrations of free drug, free receptor, and the drug-receptor complex. Our goal is to express the occupancy fraction, $\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$. To do this, we must eliminate the free receptor concentration, $R$, from the equation by using the conservation relation for total receptors.\n\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of free receptors and bound receptors:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} = R + DR$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the free receptor concentration in terms of the total and bound concentrations:\n$$R = R_{\\text{tot}} - DR$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into the equilibrium equation derived from the law of mass action:\n$$K_D = \\frac{D (R_{\\text{tot}} - DR)}{DR}$$\nThe next step is to algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$.\n$$K_D (DR) = D (R_{\\text{tot}} - DR)$$\n$$K_D (DR) = D R_{\\text{tot}} - D (DR)$$\nTo group the terms containing $DR$, we add $D(DR)$ to both sides:\n$$K_D (DR) + D (DR) = D R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nFactor out $DR$ on the left-hand side:\n$$(DR)(K_D + D) = D R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nFinally, to obtain the target occupancy fraction, we divide both sides by $R_{\\text{tot}}$ and by $(K_D + D)$:\n$$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{D}{K_D + D}$$\nThis is the required expression for the target occupancy. This functional form is known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n- Free drug concentration, $D = 8.0$ nM.\n- Dissociation constant, $K_D = 1.25$ nM.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{8.0}{1.25 + 8.0}$$\n$$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{8.0}{9.25}$$\n$$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\approx 0.86486486...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the target occupancy is $0.8649$.\n\n### Discussion of TMDD Regimes\nThe derived relationship, Occupancy $= \\frac{D}{K_D + D}$, is central to understanding the behavior of drugs exhibiting Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD). The system's behavior can be categorized into different regimes based on the relationship between the drug concentration $D$ and the dissociation constant $K_D$.\n\n1.  **Binding-Limited Regime ($D \\ll K_D$)**: When the free drug concentration is much lower than the $K_D$, the denominator $(K_D + D)$ can be approximated as $K_D$. The occupancy equation simplifies to:\n    $$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\approx \\frac{D}{K_D}$$\n    In this regime, target occupancy is approximately linear with respect to the drug concentration. The system is far from saturation. The clearance of the drug via target binding is significant and highly dependent on concentration, often leading to pronounced nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Drug elimination is limited by the rate at which drug can bind to available receptors.\n\n2.  **Saturation Regime ($D \\gg K_D$)**: When the free drug concentration is much higher than the $K_D$, the denominator $(K_D + D)$ can be approximated as $D$. The occupancy equation simplifies to:\n    $$\\frac{DR}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\approx \\frac{D}{D} = 1$$\n    In this regime, the target occupancy approaches its maximum value of $1$ (or $100\\%$). The receptors are saturated. Further increases in drug concentration do not meaningfully increase occupancy. Consequently, the target-mediated clearance pathway is also saturated and operates at its maximal rate. The overall drug pharmacokinetics tend to become linear, as clearance becomes dominated by non-saturable pathways (e.g., renal or hepatic).\n\n3.  **Transitional Regime ($D \\approx K_D$)**: When the drug concentration is of the same order of magnitude as the $K_D$, the full nonlinear equation must be used. At the specific concentration where $D = K_D$, the occupancy is exactly $0.5$, or $50\\%$. The system is in a transition between the binding-limited and saturated states.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, with $D = 8.0$ nM and $K_D = 1.25$ nM, we have $D = 6.4 \\times K_D$. Since $D$ is significantly greater than $K_D$, the system is operating in the near-saturation regime, as reflected by the high calculated occupancy of approximately $86.5\\%$.",

The rate of formation of the complex is proportional to the product of the concentrations of free drug and free receptor, $k_{\\text{on}}D(t)R(t)$. The complex is removed through two pathways: dissociation back into free drug and receptor at a rate $k_{\\text{off}}DR(t)$, and internalization at a rate $k_{\\text{int}}DR(t)$. The differential equation for $DR(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d[DR]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} D(t) R(t) - k_{\\text{off}} DR(t) - k_{\\text{int}} DR(t)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[DR]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}} D(t) R(t) - (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{int}}) DR(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that we can assume a quasi-steady state (QSS) for the binding process at the observation time $t^{*}$. This approximation implies that the concentration of the complex $DR(t)$ changes much more slowly than the binding and unbinding processes, so we can set its net rate of formation to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d[DR]}{dt} \\approx 0\n$$\nApplying this assumption to the equation at time $t^{*}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{on}} D(t^{*}) R(t^{*}) - (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{int}}) DR(t^{*}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{on}} D(t^{*}) R(t^{*}) = (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{int}}) DR(t^{*})\n$$\nWe are also given the mass-balance equation for the receptors, which states that the total receptor concentration $R_{\\text{tot}}$ is constant and is the sum of free and drug-bound receptors:\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}} = R(t) + DR(t)\n$$\nAt time $t^{*}$, this means $R(t^{*}) = R_{\\text{tot}} - DR(t^{*})$.

The initial complex concentration $DR_{0}$ is directly related to the desired occupancy $\\theta^{*}$ by its definition: $DR_{0} = \\theta^{*} R_{\\text{tot}}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{0}$ and $DR_{0}$ into the equation for total concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{tot}, 0} = \\frac{K_{\\text{ss}} \\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}} + \\theta^{*} R_{\\text{tot}} $$\nTherefore, the loading dose in moles is:\n$$ D_{L, \\text{mol}} = \\left( \\frac{K_{\\text{ss}} \\theta^{*}}{1 - \\theta^{*}} + \\theta^{*} R_{\\text{tot}} \\right) V_{c} $$\nTo find the dose in mass units (milligrams), we multiply the molar dose by the molecular weight $\\text{MW}$ (in $\\text{g}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}$) and a conversion factor of $1000$ $\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{g}^{-1}$.\n$$ D_{L}~(\\text{in mg}) = D_{L, \\text{mol}} \\times \\text{MW} \\times 1000 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- $K_{\\text{ss}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $R_{\\text{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $V_{c} = 3.0~\\text{L}$\n- $\\theta^{*} = 0.90$\n- $\\text{MW} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{g}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the required initial free concentration $C_{0}$:\n$$ C_{0} = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 0.90}{1 - 0.90} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.10} = 2.25 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nNext, calculate the initial complex concentration $DR_{0}$:\n$$ DR_{0} = 0.90 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-9}) = 9.0 \\times 10^{-10}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nThe total initial drug concentration is the sum of these two:\n$$ C_{\\text{tot}, 0} = C_{0} + DR_{0} = (2.25 \\times 10^{-8}) + (0.09 \\times 10^{-8}) = 2.34 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate the loading dose in moles:\n$$ D_{L, \\text{mol}} = C_{\\text{tot}, 0} \\times V_{c} = (2.34 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (3.0~\\text{L}) = 7.02 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{mol} $$\nConvert this to mass in grams:\n$$ D_{L}~(\\text{in g}) = (7.02 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{mol}) \\times (1.50 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{g}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}) = 10.53 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{g} = 0.01053~\\text{g} $$\nFinally, convert the mass to milligrams:\n$$ D_{L}~(\\text{in mg}) = 0.01053~\\text{g} \\times 1000~\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{g}^{-1} = 10.53~\\text{mg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the loading dose is $10.5~\\text{mg}$.",
