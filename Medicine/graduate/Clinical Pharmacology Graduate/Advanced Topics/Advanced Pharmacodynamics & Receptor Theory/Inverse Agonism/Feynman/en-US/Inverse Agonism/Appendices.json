Substituting the expressions for $f_{\\text{active}}$ and $f_0$:\n$$ \\frac{L_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eff}}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right)}{(1 + L_{0}) + [A]_{\\text{eff}} \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right)} = (1 - s) \\frac{L_{0}}{1 + L_{0}} $$\nSince $L_0 > 0$, we can divide both sides by $L_0$:\n$$ \\frac{1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eff}}}{K_{R^{*}}}}{(1 + L_{0}) + [A]_{\\text{eff}} \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - s}{1 + L_{0}} $$\nCross-multiplying yields:\n$$ (1 + L_{0}) \\left(1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eff}}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right) = (1 - s) \\left( (1 + L_{0}) + [A]_{\\text{eff}} \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right) \\right) $$\nExpanding both sides:\n$$ 1 + L_{0} + \\frac{[A]_{\\text{eff}}(1 + L_{0})}{K_{R^{*}}} = (1 - s)(1 + L_{0}) + [A]_{\\text{eff}}(1 - s) \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right) $$\nTo solve for $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$, we gather all terms containing $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} \\left[ (1 - s)\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}\\right) - \\frac{1 + L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}} \\right] = (1 + L_{0}) - (1 - s)(1 + L_{0}) $$\nThe right side simplifies to $(1 + L_{0})(1 - (1 - s)) = s(1 + L_{0})$. The term in the square brackets on the left side simplifies to:\n$$ (1 - s)\\frac{1}{K_{R}} + \\frac{(1 - s)L_{0} - (1 + L_{0})}{K_{R^{*}}} = \\frac{1 - s}{K_{R}} + \\frac{L_{0} - sL_{0} - 1 - L_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}} = \\frac{1 - s}{K_{R}} - \\frac{1 + sL_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}} $$\nThus, the equation becomes:\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{1 - s}{K_{R}} - \\frac{1 + sL_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}} \\right) = s(1 + L_{0}) $$\nSolving for $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$ gives:\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{s(1 + L_{0})}{\\frac{1 - s}{K_{R}} - \\frac{1 + sL_{0}}{K_{R^{*}}}} $$\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Safety Constraint\n\nThe safety constraint limits the fractional occupancy of an off-target receptor $O$, $f_{O}([A])$, to a maximum value $\\theta_{\\max}$.\n$$f_{O}([A]) = \\frac{[A]}{K_{O} + [A]} \\leq \\theta_{\\max}$$\nSince $[A]$ must be non-negative and $K_O$ is positive, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$ [A] \\leq \\theta_{\\max}(K_{O} + [A]) $$\n$$ [A] \\leq \\theta_{\\max}K_{O} + \\theta_{\\max}[A] $$\n$$ [A](1 - \\theta_{\\max}) \\leq \\theta_{\\max}K_{O} $$\nGiven that $\\theta_{\\max}=0.25$, $1-\\theta_{\\max} = 0.75 > 0$, so we can divide by $(1-\\theta_{\\max})$ without reversing the inequality:\n$$ [A] \\leq \\frac{\\theta_{\\max}K_{O}}{1 - \\theta_{\\max}} $$\nThis defines the maximum tolerable concentration, which we denote $[A]_{\\max}$.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Optimal Dosing Target\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest $[A]$ that meets both efficacy and safety requirements.\nFirst, we analyze the behavior of $f_{\\text{active}}([A])$. For an inverse agonist, the ligand preferentially binds to the inactive state, meaning $K_R < K_{R^{*}}$. This implies $1/K_R > 1/K_{R^{*}}$. The derivative of $f_{\\text{active}}([A])$ with respect to $[A]$ has a numerator proportional to $L_0(1/K_{R^{*}} - 1/K_R)$, which is negative. Therefore, $f_{\\text{active}}([A])$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $[A]$.\nTo achieve a suppression of *at least* $s$, we need $f_{\\text{active}}([A]) \\leq (1-s)f_0$. Because the function is decreasing, this is equivalent to requiring a concentration of *at least* $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$. Thus, the efficacy requirement is:\n$$ [A] \\geq [A]_{\\text{eff}} $$\nThe safety requirement is:\n$$ [A] \\leq [A]_{\\max} $$\nCombining these, the allowable range of concentrations is $[[A]_{\\text{eff}}, [A]_{\\max}]$. To minimize adverse effects (which are assumed to correlate with off-target occupancy and thus with $[A]$), we must choose the smallest possible concentration within this valid range. The optimal dosing target is therefore $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$, provided that $[A]_{\\text{eff}} \\leq [A]_{\\max}$.\n\n### Step 5: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the parameters:\n$L_{0} = 0.25$\n$K_{R} = 8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{R^{*}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$s = 0.60$\n$K_{O} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$\\theta_{\\max} = 0.25$\n\nFirst, calculate $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{0.60(1 + 0.25)}{\\frac{1 - 0.60}{8\\,\\mathrm{nM}} - \\frac{1 + 0.60(0.25)}{200\\,\\mathrm{nM}}} = \\frac{0.60(1.25)}{\\frac{0.40}{8\\,\\mathrm{nM}} - \\frac{1 + 0.15}{200\\,\\mathrm{nM}}} $$\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{0.75}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} - \\frac{1.15}{200\\,\\mathrm{nM}}} = \\frac{0.75}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} - 0.00575\\,\\mathrm{nM}^{-1}} $$\n$$ [A]_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{0.75}{0.04425\\,\\mathrm{nM}^{-1}} \\approx 16.9491525\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nNext, calculate the maximum allowed concentration, $[A]_{\\max}$:\n$$ [A]_{\\max} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\max}K_{O}}{1 - \\theta_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{0.75} \\approx 33.333...\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nSince $[A]_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 16.95\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is less than $[A]_{\\max} \\approx 33.33\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, a therapeutic window exists. The optimal concentration is the minimum required for efficacy, $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nRounding the result for $[A]_{\\text{eff}}$ to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ [A] = 16.95\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$",
