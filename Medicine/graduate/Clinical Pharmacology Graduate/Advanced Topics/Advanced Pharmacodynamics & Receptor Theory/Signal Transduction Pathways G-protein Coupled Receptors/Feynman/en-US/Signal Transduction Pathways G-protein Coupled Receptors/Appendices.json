It is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary parameters for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the kinetics of the reversible bimolecular reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$. According to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the receptor-ligand complex, $RL$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of free receptors, $[R]$, and free ligand, $[L]$. The rate of dissociation is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $[RL]$. The net rate of change of the complex concentration is therefore given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[RL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[R][L] - k_{\\text{off}}[RL]\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the association rate constant and $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nWe are given the following notation:\n- $B(t)$ represents the concentration of the bound receptor complex, so $B(t) = [RL]$.\n- $B_{\\max}$ represents the total receptor concentration, so $B_{\\max} = [R] + [RL]$. This implies that the concentration of free receptors at any time $t$ is $[R] = B_{\\max} - [RL] = B_{\\max} - B(t)$.\n- The ligand concentration $[L]$ is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment.\n- The initial condition is that no receptors are bound at $t=0$, so $B(0)=0$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the rate equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}(B_{\\max} - B(t))[L] - k_{\\text{off}}B(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it by gathering the terms involving $B(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - (k_{\\text{on}}[L] + k_{\\text{off}})B(t)\n$$\nLet us define the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, as:\n$$\nk_{\\text{obs}} = k_{\\text{on}}[L] + k_{\\text{off}}\n$$\nThe differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} + k_{\\text{obs}}B(t) = k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]\n$$\nThis equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state ($t'=0$, $B'=0$) to an arbitrary state ($t'=t$, $B'=B(t)$):\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{B(t)} \\frac{dB'}{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B'} = \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{obs}}}\\ln(k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B')\\right]_{0}^{B(t)} = t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{obs}}} \\left( \\ln(k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B(t)) - \\ln(k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B(0)) \\right) = t\n$$\nSince $B(0)=0$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L] - k_{\\text{obs}}B(t)}{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}\\right) = -k_{\\text{obs}}t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{k_{\\text{obs}}B(t)}{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t)\n$$\nSolving for $B(t)$:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}{k_{\\text{obs}}} (1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t))\n$$\nThis is the general equation for the time course of specific binding, $B(t)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium specific binding, $B_{\\text{eq}}$, which is the value of $B(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n$$\nB_{\\text{eq}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} B(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}{k_{\\text{obs}}} (1 - \\lim_{t \\to \\infty}\\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t)) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}{k_{\\text{obs}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{obs}}$, we get:\n$$\nB_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}{k_{\\text{on}}[L] + k_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nUsing the provided definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nB_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}B_{\\max}[L]}{k_{\\text{on}}([L] + K_d)} = \\frac{B_{\\max}[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the well-known equation for equilibrium binding. Now we can write $B(t)$ in terms of $B_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$\nB(t) = B_{\\text{eq}}(1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t))\n$$\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $B_{\\text{eq}}$.

The ligands are the reference ligand $\\mathrm{R}$, test ligand $\\mathrm{A}$, and test ligand $\\mathrm{B}$.

According to Definition 2, the relative efficacy of a test ligand (e.g., $\\mathrm{A}$) versus the reference ligand ($\\mathrm{R}$) in a pathway $P$ is the difference in their transduction coefficients. Let this be denoted by $\\Delta E_{P}(\\mathrm{A})$.\n\nFor test ligand $\\mathrm{A}$:\nThe relative efficacy in the G protein pathway is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{G}(\\mathrm{A}) = T_{\\mathrm{A}, G} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, G} = 0.55 - 0.30 = 0.25 $$\nThe relative efficacy in the β-arrestin pathway is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\beta}(\\mathrm{A}) = T_{\\mathrm{A}, \\beta} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, \\beta} = -0.15 - (-0.05) = -0.15 + 0.05 = -0.10 $$\n\nFor completeness, for test ligand $\\mathrm{B}$:\nThe relative efficacy in the G protein pathway is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{G}(\\mathrm{B}) = T_{\\mathrm{B}, G} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, G} = 0.10 - 0.30 = -0.20 $$\nThe relative efficacy in the β-arrestin pathway is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\beta}(\\mathrm{B}) = T_{\\mathrm{B}, \\beta} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, \\beta} = 0.25 - (-0.05) = 0.25 + 0.05 = 0.30 $$\n\nThe second task is to compute the signaling bias. According to Definition 3, the signaling bias of test ligand $\\mathrm{A}$ relative to reference ligand $\\mathrm{R}$ is the difference between its within-pathway relative efficacies. The problem specifies \"with respect to the G protein pathway over the β-arrestin pathway,\" which dictates the order of subtraction.

A positive value indicates that, compared to the reference ligand, ligand $\\mathrm{A}$ is biased towards the G protein pathway.\n\nAlternatively, the calculation can be expressed in a single step by substituting the definitions:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta E(\\mathrm{A}) = (T_{\\mathrm{A}, G} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, G}) - (T_{\\mathrm{A}, \\beta} - T_{\\mathrm{R}, \\beta}) $$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta E(\\mathrm{A}) = (0.55 - 0.30) - (-0.15 - (-0.05)) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta E(\\mathrm{A}) = (0.25) - (-0.10) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta E(\\mathrm{A}) = 0.35 $$\n\nThe final answer is the signaling bias for ligand $\\mathrm{A}$, which is a dimensionless quantity expressed as a base-10 logarithmic difference.",
