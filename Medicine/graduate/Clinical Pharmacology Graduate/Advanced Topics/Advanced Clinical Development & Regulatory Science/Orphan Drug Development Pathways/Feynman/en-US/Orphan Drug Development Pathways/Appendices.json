            "problem": "A biotechnology company is developing an orphan drug for a rare pediatric lysosomal storage disorder. Because the disorder has a very small incident population and the standard of care is supportive only, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved a single-arm phase II trial against a historical control. The primary endpoint is a binary clinical response within $12$ weeks. Historical data suggest a baseline response rate of $p_{0} = 0.20$ under usual care. The sponsor aims to detect a clinically meaningful improvement to $p_{1} = 0.40$. The trial will use a one-sided test at type I error $\\alpha = 0.05$ with desired power $0.80$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the binomial model and the large-sample normal approximation for the sample proportion, derive the minimum integer sample size $n$ required so that a one-sample superiority test of $H_{0}: p = p_{0}$ versus $H_{1}: p > p_{0}$ at level $\\alpha$ has power $0.80$ when the true response rate is $p_{1}$. In your derivation, begin with the definition of the binomial distribution, the Central Limit Theorem for the sample proportion, and the critical region induced by the one-sided test under $H_{0}$, and then obtain the power under $p_{1}$ by integrating over the approximate sampling distribution. State clearly any distributional approximations and quantiles you use.\n\nFinally, briefly justify why a single-arm design with a historical control is scientifically reasonable in the rare disease context, focusing on feasibility and ethics. Report the final answer for $n$ as the minimum integer that achieves the design targets. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard biostatistical task for determining the sample size of a single-arm clinical trial. All necessary parameters are provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the minimum integer sample size, $n$, required for the specified single-arm trial. We begin from first principles.\n\nLet $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of $n$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, representing the clinical response of each of the $n$ patients in the trial. A response is coded as $X_i = 1$ and no response as $X_i = 0$. The probability of a response for any given patient is $p$, i.e., $P(X_i = 1) = p$. The total number of responses in the sample is $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. Under this model, $S_n$ follows a binomial distribution, $S_n \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$.\n\nThe estimator for the true population proportion $p$ is the sample proportion, $\\hat{p} = \\frac{S_n}{n}$. The expected value of $\\hat{p}$ is $E[\\hat{p}] = p$ and the variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\n\nThe problem requires using the large-sample normal approximation for the sample proportion. According to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normal:\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\approx N\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe hypotheses to be tested are:\nNull hypothesis, $H_0: p = p_0$, where $p_0 = 0.20$.\nAlternative hypothesis, $H_1: p > p_0$.\n\nThe test is conducted at a one-sided significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic is:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}\n$$\nThis statistic $Z$ is approximately distributed as a standard normal distribution, $N(0, 1)$.\n\nWe reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ if the observed value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value $z_{\\alpha}$, where $z_{\\alpha}$ is the upper $\\alpha$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. $P(Z > z_{\\alpha}) = \\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 0.05$, the quantile is $z_{0.05} \\approx 1.645$.\n\nThe rejection region for the test can also be expressed in terms of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$. We reject $H_0$ if $\\hat{p} > c$, where $c$ is the critical value for the proportion. This critical value is found by setting the test statistic equal to the critical normal quantile:\n$$\n\\frac{c - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} = z_{\\alpha}\n$$\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n$$\nc = p_0 + z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}\n$$\n\nThe power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the true proportion is $p_1 = 0.40$. The desired power is $0.80$.\nPower is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Power} = P(\\text{reject } H_0 | p = p_1) = P(\\hat{p} > c | p = p_1)\n$$\nWhen the true proportion is $p_1$, the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is approximately $N\\left(p_1, \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}\\right)$. To calculate the power, we standardize $\\hat{p}$ using its distribution under $H_1$:\n$$\n\\text{Power} = P\\left( \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}} > \\frac{c - p_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}} \\right) = 0.80\n$$\nThe term on the left inside the probability is a standard normal variable. Let $1-\\beta$ represent the power, where $\\beta$ is the Type II error rate. We have $1-\\beta=0.80$, so $\\beta=0.20$.\nThe equation implies:\n$$\n\\frac{c - p_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}} = -z_{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $z_{\\beta}$ is the upper $\\beta$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For $\\beta=0.20$, the quantile is $z_{0.20} \\approx 0.8416$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for the critical value $c$ into this power equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(p_0 + z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}\\right) - p_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}} = -z_{\\beta}\n$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the sample size $n$:\n$$\np_0 - p_1 + z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} = -z_{\\beta}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}\n$$\n$$\np_1 - p_0 = z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} + z_{\\beta}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ from the right-hand side:\n$$\np_1 - p_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + z_{\\beta}\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{n}$ and then for $n$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + z_{\\beta}\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}{p_1 - p_0}\n$$\n$$\nn = \\left( \\frac{z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + z_{\\beta}\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}{p_1 - p_0} \\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the sample size.\n\nWe now substitute the given values into this formula:\n$p_0 = 0.20$\n$p_1 = 0.40$\n$\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{\\alpha} = z_{0.05} \\approx 1.645$\nPower $= 0.80 \\implies \\beta = 0.20 \\implies z_{\\beta} = z_{0.20} \\approx 0.8416$\n\nFirst, calculate the variance terms:\n$p_0(1-p_0) = 0.20 \\times (1-0.20) = 0.20 \\times 0.80 = 0.16$\n$p_1(1-p_1) = 0.40 \\times (1-0.40) = 0.40 \\times 0.60 = 0.24$\n\nNow, substitute these into the formula for $n$:\n$$\nn = \\left( \\frac{1.645\\sqrt{0.16} + 0.8416\\sqrt{0.24}}{0.40 - 0.20} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nn = \\left( \\frac{1.645 \\times 0.4 + 0.8416\\sqrt{0.24}}{0.20} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.658 + 0.8416 \\times 0.489898}{0.20} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.658 + 0.41231}{0.20} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\left( \\frac{1.07031}{0.20} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx (5.35155)^2 \\approx 28.639\n$$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, we take the ceiling of this value to ensure the power and significance level targets are met.\n$$\nn = \\lceil 28.639 \\rceil = 29\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to justify the single-arm design with a historical control in the context of rare diseases. This design choice is scientifically reasonable due to considerations of feasibility and ethics.\n\nFeasibility: Rare diseases, by definition, affect a very small patient population. Recruiting a sufficient number of patients for a traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) is often logistically difficult, time-consuming, and may be altogether impossible within a reasonable timeframe. A single-arm trial requires a smaller sample size than a two-arm trial designed to detect the same effect size, thus making participant recruitment more feasible and accelerating the drug development process for a population with high unmet medical need.\n\nEthics: In the context of a severe, progressive disorder with only supportive care available (i.e., no effective approved treatment), the use of a placebo control arm raises significant ethical concerns. Randomly assigning patients to a placebo group would mean knowingly withholding a potentially life-altering or life-saving therapy from individuals who have no other therapeutic options. A single-arm design ensures that all trial participants receive the investigational drug. The use of a historical control, while possessing known limitations regarding bias, is often considered the most ethical and practical compromise. Its validity rests on the assumption that the natural history of the disease is well-characterized and stable over time, and that the historical data are of high quality and derived from a patient population comparable to the one being studied. For many rare genetic disorders, such as the lysosomal storage disorder mentioned, the disease course is often predictable, making a historical control a scientifically justifiable comparator.",

            "problem": "A sponsor is developing a terminal complement component C5 monoclonal antibody, denoted as $C5\\text{mAb}$, for a chronic immune-mediated cardiomyopathy with total United States prevalence $400{,}000$. The proposed mechanism is inhibition of membrane attack complex formation to prevent complement-mediated cytolysis in myocardial tissue. The sponsor seeks Orphan Drug designation via a medically plausible orphan subset. Using first principles of clinical pharmacology and regulatory definitions, determine which proposed subset argument below meets the Orphan Drug Act criteria for an orphan subset and is scientifically justified.\n\nBase facts and definitions to use:\n- Orphan Drug Act (ODA) designation requires the disease or condition affecting no more than $200{,}000$ people in the United States, or a medically plausible subset within a larger disease where patients outside the subset would be appropriately excluded on safety or efficacy grounds.\n- A medically plausible subset must be grounded in target biology such that patients outside the subset would not be candidates for the drug because benefit is not reasonably expected or risk is unacceptably high.\n- Receptor occupancy by a monoclonal antibody at target site obeys law-of-mass-action equilibrium $f_R = \\frac{C}{C + K_d}$, where $f_R$ is fractional occupancy, $C$ is free drug concentration at the biophase, and $K_d$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant.\n- Pharmacodynamic effect for pathway blockade generally requires both sufficient target engagement and sufficient baseline pathway activation. A common empirical form for activation-dependent effect is $E = E_{\\max}\\frac{A^\\gamma}{A^\\gamma + A_{50}^\\gamma}$, where $A$ is pathway activation level, $A_{50}$ is the activation yielding half-maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$ is maximal effect, and $\\gamma \\ge 1$ is a sigmoidicity parameter.\n\nConsider the following five proposed orphan subset arguments:\n\nA. Define the subset as patients with biopsy-proven complement deposition ($\\text{C5b-9}$ staining above a prespecified threshold) and plasma complement activity $CH50$ above the upper limit of normal, a phenotype present in $35\\%$ of the disease population. The sponsor estimates prevalence $0.35 \\times 400{,}000 = 140{,}000$. Mechanistic justification: In these patients, $A$ (baseline complement activation) is high, so $E$ approaches $E_{\\max}$ when $f_R$ approaches $1$, expected at clinically achievable $C$ given $K_d$ in the low nanomolar range. In patients without complement deposition, $A$ is near baseline physiological levels, so $E \\approx 0$ despite possible target occupancy. Safety justification: $C5$ blockade carries a known increased risk of invasive meningococcal infection; given negligible efficacy outside the complement-positive subset, the benefit-risk for complement-negative patients is unfavorable, warranting exclusion. The sponsor commits to immunization and prophylaxis within the subset.\n\nB. Define the subset as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class $\\text{III}$ and $\\text{IV}$ patients irrespective of mechanism, with estimated prevalence $45\\%$ of the disease population ($180{,}000$). Justification: Greater severity implies greater need; outside the subset, patients are less symptomatic and can be managed with standard therapy.\n\nC. Define the subset geographically as patients residing in the northeastern United States, where clinical infrastructure enables monitoring for $C5\\text{mAb}$-related infections. Estimated prevalence is $180{,}000$. Justification: Concentrated specialist care allows safe use; outside the region, infrastructure is limited.\n\nD. Define the subset as patients with any evidence of systemic inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein), present in $70\\%$ of the disease population ($280{,}000$). Justification: Inflammation correlates with immune involvement; $C5\\text{mAb}$ is an immunomodulator.\n\nE. Define the subset as patients refractory to standard immunosuppression (failure of $\\ge 2$ agents), present in $40\\%$ of the disease population ($160{,}000$). Justification: Refractory patients have high unmet need; $C5\\text{mAb}$ can be reserved for them; outside the subset, other therapies can be tried first.\n\nWhich option provides a medically plausible orphan subset with estimated prevalence $<200,000$ and a sound mechanistic safety or efficacy rationale for excluding patients outside the subset?\n\nOptions:\n- A\n- B\n- C\n- D\n- E",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an evaluation of five proposed orphan subset arguments for a C5 monoclonal antibody ($C5\\text{mAb}$) in a chronic immune-mediated cardiomyopathy. The evaluation must be based on the criteria of the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) and fundamental principles of clinical pharmacology, as provided in the problem statement. Specifically, a valid orphan subset must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  The estimated prevalence of the subset in the United States must be less than $200{,}000$. The total disease population is given as $400{,}000$.\n2.  The subset must be \"medically plausible,\" meaning it is defined based on the drug's target biology, and there is a strong scientific rationale (related to efficacy or safety) for excluding patients from treatment who fall outside this subset.\n\nWe will analyze each proposed subset argument against these two criteria. The analysis will utilize the provided pharmacodynamic models: receptor occupancy, $f_R = \\frac{C}{C + K_d}$, and activation-dependent effect, $E = E_{\\max}\\frac{A^\\gamma}{A^\\gamma + A_{50}^\\gamma}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n-   **Subset Definition**: Patients with biopsy-proven complement deposition ($\\text{C5b-9}$ staining) and elevated plasma complement activity ($CH50$).\n-   **Prevalence Calculation**: The prevalence is given as $35\\%$ of the total disease population. This corresponds to $0.35 \\times 400{,}000 = 140{,}000$ individuals.\n-   **Criterion 1 (Prevalence)**: $140{,}000 < 200{,}000$. This criterion is met.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Medical Plausibility)**: The subset is defined by biomarkers indicating over-activation of the complement cascade, which is the direct target of the $C5\\text{mAb}$. This definition is fundamentally grounded in target biology. The justification for excluding patients outside the subset rests on both efficacy and safety.\n    -   **Efficacy Rationale**: The provided effect model, $E = E_{\\max}\\frac{A^\\gamma}{A^\\gamma + A_{50}^\\gamma}$, shows that the therapeutic effect $E$ is dependent on the baseline pathway activation level $A$. In the proposed subset, patients have high complement activation (high $A$). For these patients, achieving high target occupancy ($f_R \\approx 1$) with the $C5\\text{mAb}$ will lead to a substantial effect ($E$ approaching $E_{\\max}$). Conversely, in patients outside the subset (without evidence of complement activation), $A$ would be at or near normal physiological levels, which would be much lower than $A_{50}$. In this scenario, even with complete target blockade, the resulting effect $E$ would be negligible ($E \\approx 0$). Therefore, the drug is not reasonably expected to provide benefit to patients outside the subset.\n    -   **Safety Rationale**: $C5$ inhibition carries a known risk of serious infections. For patients in whom the drug is not expected to be effective (those outside the subset), an unfavorable benefit-risk profile arises. It is inappropriate to expose patients to a significant safety risk for a negligible or nonexistent chance of benefit. This provides a strong safety-based reason for exclusion.\n-   **Verdict**: Option A presents a subset that satisfies the prevalence threshold and is defined by a robust, medically plausible rationale grounded in the drug's mechanism of action and established pharmacological principles. The exclusion of patients outside the subset is justified by a lack of expected efficacy and an unfavorable benefit-risk balance. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n-   **Subset Definition**: Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class $\\text{III}$ and $\\text{IV}$ severity.\n-   **Prevalence Calculation**: The prevalence is estimated at $45\\%$ of the total population, which is $0.45 \\times 400{,}000 = 180{,}000$.\n-   **Criterion 1 (Prevalence)**: $180{,}000 < 200{,}000$. This criterion is met.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Medical Plausibility)**: The subset is defined by disease severity, not by the underlying biological mechanism targeted by the drug. A patient's NYHA class is a clinical measure of functional limitation due to heart failure; it is not a direct measure of complement pathway activation. A patient with severe (NYHA $\\text{IV}$) cardiomyopathy might have a non-complement-mediated etiology, while a patient with mild (NYHA $\\text{II}$) disease could have a condition strongly driven by complement activation. The justification provided is based on \"greater need\" and the availability of other therapies for less severe patients. This is a \"line of therapy\" or \"unmet need\" argument, not a biological one. It does not posit that the $C5\\text{mAb}$ would be ineffective or unsafe in a patient with complement-driven disease who happens to be NYHA class $\\text{II}$. Therefore, the rationale for excluding patients outside the subset is not medically plausible as defined by the ODA guidance.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails the medical plausibility criterion. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n-   **Subset Definition**: Patients residing in the northeastern United States.\n-   **Prevalence Calculation**: The prevalence is estimated at $180{,}000$.\n-   **Criterion 1 (Prevalence)**: $180{,}000 < 200{,}000$. This criterion is met.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Medical Plausibility)**: This subset is defined by geography. The justification is based on logistics and healthcare infrastructure. This is entirely divorced from the biology of the disease or the drug's mechanism of action. Defining a disease subset by geographic location is arbitrary and not permitted under the ODA. The biological characteristics of a disease do not change based on a patient's place of residence.\n-   **Verdict**: This option egregiously fails the medical plausibility criterion. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n-   **Subset Definition**: Patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).\n-   **Prevalence Calculation**: The prevalence is given as $70\\%$ of the total disease population, which is $0.70 \\times 400{,}000 = 280{,}000$.\n-   **Criterion 1 (Prevalence)**: $280{,}000 > 200{,}000$. This criterion is not met.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Medical Plausibility)**: Since the prevalence criterion is not met, the argument fails irrespective of its plausibility. However, for completeness, it should be noted that elevated CRP is a non-specific marker of inflammation and is not specific to the terminal complement pathway. The scientific rationale is thus significantly weaker than that in Option A.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails the prevalence criterion for an orphan disease. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\n-   **Subset Definition**: Patients refractory to at least two standard immunosuppressive agents.\n-   **Prevalence Calculation**: The prevalence is given as $40\\%$ of the total population, which is $0.40 \\times 400{,}000 = 160{,}000$.\n-   **Criterion 1 (Prevalence)**: $160{,}000 < 200{,}000$. This criterion is met.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Medical Plausibility)**: This subset is defined by treatment history (\"refractory\" status). Similar to Option B, this is not a definition based on target biology. A patient's failure to respond to other therapies does not, in itself, prove that their disease is driven by complement activation. The justification that the drug should be \"reserved\" for these patients is an argument about clinical practice guidelines or treatment sequencing, not a fundamental biological rationale for why the drug would not work or be unsafe in treatment-naive individuals who do have a complement-driven pathophysiology.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails the medical plausibility criterion. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, only Option A defines a subset whose prevalence is below the $200{,}000$ threshold and whose definition is based on a sound, scientifically-grounded rationale tied directly to the drug's mechanism of action, providing a valid reason based on efficacy and safety for excluding patients outside the subset.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed problem in pharmacoeconomics, grounded in established principles of health technology assessment. All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are provided, allowing for the calculation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER is a standard metric in health economics used to evaluate the value for money of a medical intervention. It is defined as the ratio of the change in costs to the change in health effects of one intervention compared to a comparator. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}_{\\text{new}} - \\text{Cost}_{\\text{comparator}}}{\\text{Effect}_{\\text{new}} - \\text{Effect}_{\\text{comparator}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta C$ represents the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ represents the incremental health effect.\n\nFirst, we determine the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$.

The cost of the comparator (optimized standard-of-care) is not provided. In this context, and with the explicit exclusion of cost offsets, the incremental cost $\\Delta C$ is taken to be the total cost of the new therapy.\n\nThe total cost of the therapy per patient is calculated as the price per year multiplied by the treatment duration:\n$$\n\\Delta C = P \\times T\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\$450,000 \\, \\text{year}^{-1} \\times 3 \\, \\text{years} = \\$1,350,000\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the incremental health effect, $\\Delta E$.

The first four significant digits are $3$, $8$, $5$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\approx \\$385,700 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\n\nThe problem also requests a brief discussion on the distinction between affordability and value, based on this result.\n\nThe ICER is a measure of **value**, or economic efficiency. It quantifies the cost required to gain one unit of health (in this case, one QALY). Health systems often use willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds, whether explicit or implicit, to judge whether a therapy offers good value. For instance, WTP thresholds in the United States are often cited in the range of $\\$100,000$ to $\\$150,000$ per QALY, although higher thresholds are frequently considered for orphan drugs or diseases of high severity. The calculated ICER of $\\$385,700$ per QALY is substantially higher than these conventional thresholds, suggesting the therapy may not be considered cost-effective or good \"value\" in a traditional sense. However, for orphan drugs, policymakers may accept higher ICERs due to factors such as disease rarity, severity, and lack of alternative treatments.\n\n**Affordability**, in contrast, is not about efficiency but about budgetary feasibility. It is concerned with the total expenditure a payer or health system would incur to provide the therapy to all eligible patients. Affordability is assessed through a budget impact analysis, which calculates the total cost by multiplying the cost per patient by the expected number of patients. A therapy can be deemed \"good value\" (i.e., have a low ICER) but be unaffordable if it targets a large patient population, leading to an unmanageable total budget impact. Conversely, a therapy with a very high per-patient cost, such as the one in this problem ($\\$1,350,000$), might be considered affordable at a system level if the patient population is extremely small (i.e., \"ultra-rare\"). Therefore, even if a payer's decision-making framework for orphan drugs might accommodate the high ICER (the \"value\" question), the therapy's high price still presents a significant challenge to **affordability**, which a payer must manage within a fixed budget. Value and affordability are thus distinct and equally critical considerations in reimbursement decisions.",
