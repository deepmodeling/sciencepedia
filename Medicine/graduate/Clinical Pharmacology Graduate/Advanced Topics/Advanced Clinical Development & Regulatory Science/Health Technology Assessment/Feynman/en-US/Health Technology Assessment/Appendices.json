            "introduction": "Health Technology Assessment often boils down to a fundamental question: is the health gain offered by a new technology worth its additional cost? This exercise provides hands-on practice with the concept of Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB), a core tool that translates this trade-off into a single monetary value to guide decision-making. By working through this calculation, you will learn how to formally determine if an intervention is considered cost-effective at a given societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$.",

            "problem": "A national payer is conducting a health technology assessment comparing a new implantable device to standard care. The incremental effectiveness of the device relative to standard care is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY), defined as a time-based measure of health benefit that weights life-years by health-related quality of life on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health). The payer uses a willingness-to-pay threshold, denoted by $\\lambda$, which represents the maximum amount in dollars the system is prepared to pay per one additional QALY. \n\nSuppose the incremental effectiveness is $\\Delta \\text{QALY} = 0.45$, the incremental cost is $\\Delta \\text{Cost} = 18{,}000$ dollars, and the threshold is $\\lambda = 50{,}000$ dollars per QALY. Using the core welfare economics framing that monetizes health gains by valuing $\\Delta \\text{QALY}$ at $\\lambda$ and then offsets this value by $\\Delta \\text{Cost}$ to obtain the incremental net monetary benefit, compute the incremental net monetary benefit of the device versus standard care. Express your final result in dollars as an exact value with no rounding. Then, interpret the sign and magnitude of the computed value in terms of cost-effectiveness at the stated threshold.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed quantitative problem grounded in the standard principles of health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the values are realistic.\n\nThe central task is to compute the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of a new technology compared to a standard of care. The problem defines INMB as the monetized value of the incremental health gain minus the incremental cost. The health gain is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and its monetary value is determined by the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta \\text{QALY} = 0.45$. This is a dimensionless quantity representing health-related utility integrated over time.\n- Incremental cost, $\\Delta \\text{Cost} = 18{,}000$ dollars.\n- Willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda = 50{,}000$ dollars per QALY.\n\nBased on the problem's explicit framing from welfare economics, the INMB is calculated using the following formula:\n$$\n\\text{INMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY}) - \\Delta \\text{Cost}\n$$\nThis formula represents the net societal benefit in monetary terms. The term $(\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY})$ represents the monetary value of the health gain, and $\\Delta \\text{Cost}$ is the additional expenditure required to achieve that gain. A positive INMB indicates that the value of the health benefit exceeds the cost, suggesting the technology is cost-effective at the given threshold $\\lambda$.\n\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{INMB} = (\\$50{,}000 \\text{ per QALY} \\times 0.45 \\text{ QALY}) - \\$18{,}000\n$$\nFirst, calculate the monetized value of the incremental effectiveness:\n$$\n\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY} = 50{,}000 \\times 0.45\n$$\n$$\n50{,}000 \\times \\frac{45}{100} = 500 \\times 45 = 22{,}500\n$$\nThis result, $\\$22{,}500$, is the monetary value assigned to the $0.45$ QALY gain.\n\nNext, subtract the incremental cost from this value to find the INMB:\n$$\n\\text{INMB} = \\$22{,}500 - \\$18{,}000 = \\$4{,}500\n$$\nThe incremental net monetary benefit is $\\$4{,}500$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this result.\n- **Sign**: The INMB is positive ($ +\\$4{,}500 $). A positive INMB signifies that, at the specified willingness-to-pay threshold of $\\$50{,}000$ per QALY, the economic value of the health benefits gained from the new device is greater than its additional cost. Therefore, from an economic perspective, the intervention is deemed cost-effective and represents a net gain to the system.\n\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of $\\$4{,}500$ quantifies this net gain per patient treated with the new device instead of standard care. It is the surplus value, expressed in monetary units, after the costs have been accounted for.\n\nAn alternative but equivalent way to evaluate cost-effectiveness is to calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and compare it to the threshold $\\lambda$. The ICER is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Cost}}{\\Delta \\text{QALY}}\n$$\nA technology is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than $\\lambda$. Let's verify this for the given parameters:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$18{,}000}{0.45 \\text{ QALY}} = \\$40{,}000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nComparing the ICER to the threshold:\n$$\n\\$40{,}000 \\text{ per QALY}  \\$50{,}000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nSince $\\text{ICER}  \\lambda$, the intervention is cost-effective, which is consistent with the positive INMB. The algebraic relationship is direct:\n$$\n\\text{INMB} > 0 \\iff (\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY}) - \\Delta \\text{Cost} > 0 \\iff \\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY} > \\Delta \\text{Cost} \\iff \\lambda > \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Cost}}{\\Delta \\text{QALY}} \\iff \\lambda > \\text{ICER}\n$$\nOur calculation confirms this relationship. The positive INMB of $\\$4{,}500$ indicates that the device is cost-effective at the payer's stated threshold.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a cost-utility analysis of three mutually exclusive interventions. The analysis is conducted from the health system payer perspective, with costs measured in United States dollars (USD) and effects in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The fundamental steps involve ordering the interventions by effectiveness, eliminating dominated alternatives, and then calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the remaining options.\n\nThe provided data for the three alternatives are:\n- Standard care ($A$): Cost $C_A = \\$8,000$, Effect $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs.\n- Add-on therapy ($B$): Cost $C_B = \\$12,500$, Effect $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs.\n- Alternative therapy ($C$): Cost $C_C = \\$14,000$, Effect $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n**1. Order Alternatives by Effectiveness**\nThe first step is to order the interventions from the least effective to the most effective, based on their expected QALYs.\n- $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs\n- $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs\n- $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs\n\nThe order of increasing effectiveness is $A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow B$. We can tabulate the alternatives in this order:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Alternative}  \\text{Cost } (C)  \\text{Effect } (E) \\\\\n\\hline\nA  \\$8,000  0.75 \\\\\nC  \\$14,000  0.79 \\\\\nB  \\$12,500  0.80 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**2. Identify Dominated Alternatives**\nNext, we must check for dominance. An alternative is strictly dominated if there is another alternative that is both more effective and less costly. An alternative is extendedly dominated if it has an ICER greater than that of a more effective alternative.\n\nLet's compare the costs and effects of the alternatives in their effectiveness order.\n- Compare Alternative $A$ and Alternative $C$: Alternative $C$ is more effective ($E_C > E_A$) and more costly ($C_C > C_A$). Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare Alternative $C$ and Alternative $B$: Alternative $B$ is more effective than Alternative $C$ ($E_B = 0.80 > E_C = 0.79$). At the same time, Alternative $B$ is less costly than Alternative $C$ ($C_B = \\$12,500  C_C = \\$14,000$).\n\nSince Alternative $B$ provides a greater health benefit for a lower cost compared to Alternative $C$, Alternative $B$ strictly dominates Alternative $C$. A rational decision-maker would never choose Alternative $C$ when Alternative $B$ is available. Therefore, Alternative $C$ must be eliminated from further consideration.\n\n**3. Calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\nAfter removing the dominated Alternative $C$, we are left with two non-dominated alternatives: $A$ (Standard care) and $B$ (Add-on therapy).\n- Alternative $A$: $C_A = \\$8,000$, $E_A = 0.75$\n- Alternative $B$: $C_B = \\$12,500$, $E_B = 0.80$\n\nThe ICER is calculated for the more effective option ($B$) relative to the next less effective option ($A$). The formula for the ICER is the change in cost divided by the change in effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A}\n$$\n\nWe compute the incremental cost and incremental effect:\n- Incremental Cost ($\\Delta C$):\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_B - C_A = \\$12,500 - \\$8,000 = \\$4,500\n$$\n- Incremental Effect ($\\Delta E$):\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_B - E_A = 0.80 \\text{ QALYs} - 0.75 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.05 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\$4,500}{0.05 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$90,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\n\nThe result is an ICER of $90,000$ USD/QALY. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $90,000$ can be written in scientific notation to explicitly show this precision.\n$$\n90,000 = 9.000 \\times 10^4\n$$\nThis value represents the additional cost required to gain one additional quality-adjusted life year by choosing Add-on therapy ($B$) over Standard care ($A$).",

The eligible population can be stratified into two mutually exclusive subgroups based on baseline risk: subgroup A and subgroup B. Subgroup A constitutes $30\\%$ of the population and subgroup B constitutes $70\\%$.

            "solution": "The problem presents a decision analysis scenario within the framework of Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The objective is to determine the optimal proportion of the eligible population to receive a new screening technology by maximizing the expected incremental net monetary benefit (INMB).\n\nThe INMB is defined as the monetary value of the net health gain from an intervention. For a given individual or subgroup, it is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{INMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the willingness-to-pay threshold per unit of effectiveness, $\\Delta E$ is the incremental effectiveness (in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years, or QALYs), and $\\Delta C$ is the incremental cost.\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nThe problem states that for both subgroups, the incremental effectiveness is strictly positive, i.e., $\\Delta E > 0$.

Since $\\Delta E > 0$, the sign of the INMB is solely determined by the sign of the term $(\\lambda - \\text{ICER})$.
