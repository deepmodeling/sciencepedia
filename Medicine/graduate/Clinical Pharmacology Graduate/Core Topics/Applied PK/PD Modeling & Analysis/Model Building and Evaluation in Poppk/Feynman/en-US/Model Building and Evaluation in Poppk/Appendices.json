Extract Givens**\n-   **Model:** One-compartment, IV bolus, linear first-order elimination.\n-   **Half-life ($t_{1/2}$):** $9$ hours.\n-   **Dose ($D$):** $500$ mg.\n-   **Dosing interval ($\\tau$):** $12$ hours.\n-   **Apparent central volume of distribution ($V$):** $50$ L.\n-   **Assumptions:** Immediate mixing, constant elimination rate coefficient, negligible residual error.\n-   **Task:**\n    1.  Derive the expression for the accumulation ratio at steady state ($R_{acc}$).\n    2.  Derive the expression for the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{ss,trough}$).\n    3.  Compute the numerical values for $R_{acc}$ and $C_{ss,trough}$.\n-   **Starting Point:** The derivation must begin from the differential equation for first-order elimination and the definition of half-life.\n-   **Numerical Precision:** Round final numerical answers to four significant figures.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on the classical one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with multiple IV bolus dosing and first-order elimination. This is a fundamental and well-established model in clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. All concepts, including half-life, volume of distribution, accumulation, and steady state, are scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a complete set of parameters ($t_{1/2}$, $D$, $\\tau$, $V$) and a well-defined model structure. This is sufficient to uniquely determine the elimination rate constant, and subsequently, the accumulation ratio and steady-state trough concentration.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no identifiable flaws. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation starting from first principles.\n\n**2.1. First-Order Elimination and Half-Life**\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$. For first-order elimination, the rate of change of the amount of drug in the body is proportional to the amount present:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_{el} A(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_{el}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. This is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its solution is:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-k_{el} t)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the amount of drug at $t=0$.\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of drug to decrease by half. Setting $A(t_{1/2}) = A_0/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-k_{el} t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{el} t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{el} t_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -k_{el} t_{1/2}\n$$\nFrom this, we derive the relationship between $k_{el}$ and $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nk_{el} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\n\n**2.2. Drug Concentration after Multiple Doses**\nThe concentration $C(t)$ is the amount $A(t)$ divided by the volume of distribution $V$, so $C(t) = A(t)/V$. After an IV bolus dose $D$, the initial amount is $A_0 = D$, leading to an initial concentration $C_0 = D/V$.\n\nLet's track the peak (immediately after a dose) and trough (immediately before the next dose) concentrations over multiple dosing intervals of duration $\\tau$.\n-   The peak concentration after the 1st dose is $C_{1,peak} = D/V$.\n-   The trough concentration before the 2nd dose is $C_{1,trough} = C_{1,peak} \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau) = (D/V) \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau)$.\n-   The peak concentration after the 2nd dose is $C_{2,peak} = C_{1,trough} + D/V = (D/V) \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau) + D/V = (D/V)(1 + \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau))$.\n-   The trough concentration before the 3rd dose is $C_{2,trough} = C_{2,peak} \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau) = (D/V)(1 + \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau))\\exp(-k_{el} \\tau) = (D/V)(\\exp(-k_{el} \\tau) + \\exp(-2k_{el} \\tau))$.\n-   The peak concentration after the $n$-th dose, $C_{n,peak}$, is the sum of the initial concentration from the $n$-th dose and the residual concentrations from a geometric series of all previous doses:\n$$\nC_{n,peak} = \\frac{D}{V} + \\frac{D}{V}\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau) + \\frac{D}{V}\\exp(-2k_{el}\\tau) + \\dots + \\frac{D}{V}\\exp(-(n-1)k_{el}\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nC_{n,peak} = \\frac{D}{V} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\left(\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)\\right)^i\n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series with a common ratio $r = \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)$.\n\n**2.3. Steady State and Accumulation Ratio ($R_{acc}$)**\nSteady state is reached as the number of doses $n$ approaches infinity ($n \\to \\infty$). Since $k_{el} > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the ratio $r = \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)$ is between $0$ and $1$. The sum of the infinite geometric series is $\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} r^i = \\frac{1}{1-r}$.\nThe peak concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,peak}$, is therefore:\n$$\nC_{ss,peak} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} C_{n,peak} = \\frac{D}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)} \\right)\n$$\nThe accumulation ratio, $R_{acc}$, is defined as the ratio of the peak concentration at steady state to the peak concentration after the first dose ($C_{1,peak} = D/V$).\n$$\nR_{acc} = \\frac{C_{ss,peak}}{C_{1,peak}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)} \\right)}{\\frac{D}{V}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the derived expression for the accumulation ratio:\n$$\nR_{acc} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)}\n$$\n\n**2.4. Steady-State Trough Concentration ($C_{ss,trough}$)**\nThe trough concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,trough}$, is the concentration just before a dose is administered. It is equal to the peak steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,peak}$, after it has decayed over one full dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n$$\nC_{ss,trough} = C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss,peak}$:\n$$\nC_{ss,trough} = \\left[ \\frac{D}{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)} \\right) \\right] \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)\n$$\nThis gives the derived expression for the steady-state trough concentration:\n$$\nC_{ss,trough} = \\frac{(D/V)\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)}\n$$\n\n**2.5. Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the elimination rate constant $k_{el}$ using the given half-life $t_{1/2} = 9$ h.\n$$\nk_{el} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{9 \\text{ h}} \\approx 0.07701635 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, calculate the term $\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)$ using $\\tau = 12$ h.\n$$\nk_{el}\\tau = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{9}\\right) \\times 12 = \\frac{12}{9}\\ln(2) = \\frac{4}{3}\\ln(2) \\approx 0.924196\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\ln(2)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-4/3}\\right)\\right) = 2^{-4/3} \\approx 0.3968502\n$$\nNow, compute the accumulation ratio, $R_{acc}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_{acc} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-4/3}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - 0.3968502} = \\frac{1}{0.6031498} \\approx 1.65796\n$$\n$$\nR_{acc} \\approx 1.658\n$$\nFinally, compute the steady-state trough concentration, $C_{ss,trough}$, in mg/L, rounded to four significant figures. The initial concentration $C_0 = D/V$ is:\n$$\nC_0 = \\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{500 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 10 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nUsing the derived expression for $C_{ss,trough}$:\n$$\nC_{ss,trough} = \\frac{(D/V)\\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{el}\\tau)} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg/L} \\times 2^{-4/3}}{1 - 2^{-4/3}} \\approx \\frac{10 \\times 0.3968502}{0.6031498} \\approx 6.5796 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\n$$\nC_{ss,trough} \\approx 6.580 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nThe accumulation ratio is a dimensionless quantity. The steady-state trough concentration has units of mg/L as requested.",

Two nested models are compared: a base model without any covariates on $CL$, and a covariate model that includes a single, continuous covariate effect on $CL$ through a log-linear coefficient. The base model assumes $CL$ varies across individuals via interindividual variability but has no systematic covariate effect; the covariate model introduces one additional fixed-effect parameter for the covariate relationship on $CL$, while all other structural and statistical components remain identical.

            "solution": "The problem requires a statistical comparison of two nested population pharmacokinetic models: a base model and a covariate model. The comparison is to be performed using the likelihood ratio test (LRT), based on the provided minimized negative twice the log-likelihood ($-2LL$) values.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation for the test. The comparison of two nested models via maximum likelihood estimation is formally addressed by the likelihood ratio principle. Let the base model be the null model ($H_0$) and the more complex covariate model be the alternative model ($H_1$). The base model is nested within the covariate model because it is a special case of the covariate model where the coefficient for the covariate effect is fixed to zero.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{base}}$ be the maximum likelihood achieved for the base model, and $L_{\\text{cov}}$ be the maximum likelihood for the covariate model. Since the covariate model is more complex (has more parameters) and is fitted to the same data, its maximum likelihood will be greater than or equal to that of the base model, i.e., $L_{\\text{cov}} \\geq L_{\\text{base}}$.\n\nThe likelihood ratio test statistic, $\\lambda_{LR}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda_{LR} = -2 \\ln \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{base}}}{L_{\\text{cov}}} \\right) $$\nUsing the properties of the logarithm, this can be expressed as:\n$$ \\lambda_{LR} = -2 (\\ln(L_{\\text{base}}) - \\ln(L_{\\text{cov}})) $$\n$$ \\lambda_{LR} = (-2 \\ln(L_{\\text{base}})) - (-2 \\ln(L_{\\text{cov}})) $$\nThe problem provides the minimized negative twice the log-likelihood values, which are precisely these terms:\n$$ -2LL_{\\text{base}} = -2 \\ln(L_{\\text{base}}) = 9123.6 $$\n$$ -2LL_{\\text{cov}} = -2 \\ln(L_{\\text{cov}}) = 9119.6 $$\nTherefore, the test statistic, which we can denote as $T$, is the difference between these two values:\n$$ T = -2LL_{\\text{base}} - (-2LL_{\\text{cov}}) $$\nThis difference is often referred to as the change in the objective function value ($\\Delta \\text{OFV}$ or $\\Delta(-2LL)$).\n\nNext, we establish the reference distribution for this test statistic. According to Wilks' theorem, under the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and standard regularity conditions (which are assumed to apply), the likelihood ratio test statistic $\\lambda_{LR}$ is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) random variable. The degrees of freedom ($df$) for this $\\chi^2$ distribution are equal to the difference in the number of estimated parameters between the alternative model ($H_1$) and the null model ($H_0$).\n\nThe problem states that the covariate model introduces \"one additional fixed-effect parameter\" for the covariate relationship on clearance ($CL$) compared to the base model. All other model components are identical. Thus, the difference in the number of parameters is $1$.\n$$ df = (\\text{number of parameters in covariate model}) - (\\text{number of parameters in base model}) = 1 $$\nSo, the test statistic $T$ follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom, denoted as $\\chi^2_1$.\nThis completes the derivation of the test statistic and its reference distribution.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the test statistic $T$ using the given data:\n$$ T = 9123.6 - 9119.6 = 4.0 $$\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the calculated value of $4.0$, assuming the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true. For a $\\chi^2$ test, this corresponds to the area in the upper tail of the distribution.\n$$ p = P(\\chi^2_1 \\geq 4.0) $$\nA $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom is the distribution of the square of a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. That is, $Z^2 \\sim \\chi^2_1$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ P(\\chi^2_1 \\geq 4.0) = P(Z^2 \\geq 4.0) $$\nTaking the square root of both sides of the inequality inside the probability function gives:\n$$ P(|Z| \\geq \\sqrt{4.0}) = P(|Z| \\geq 2.0) $$\nBy the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, this is:\n$$ P(Z \\leq -2.0) + P(Z \\geq 2.0) = 2 \\times P(Z \\geq 2.0) $$\nUsing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$, the p-value is $2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(2.0))$.

It is centered on the core principles of nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, which is the standard methodology for PopPK analysis. The concepts of interindividual variability ($\\omega^2$), random effects ($\\eta$), Empirical Bayes Estimates ($\\hat{\\eta}$), and eta-shrinkage are standard and well-defined within the field of pharmacometrics.

The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive the requested expression and compute the numerical value.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for eta-shrinkage and its subsequent calculation.\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework**\n\nIn a hierarchical model, such as the PopPK model described, parameters for each individual ($i$) are assumed to be drawn from a common population distribution. Here, the individual random effects on clearance, $\\eta_{CL,i}$, are realizations from a single normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\omega_{CL}^{2})$. The variance of this distribution, $\\omega_{CL}^{2}$, represents the true, unobserved interindividual variability (IIV) of the parameter in the population.\n\nThe Empirical Bayes Estimates (EBEs), $\\hat{\\eta}_{CL,i}$, are the estimates of the individual $\\eta_{CL,i}$ values, conditional on the individual's observed data and the population model parameters (including $\\theta_{CL}$ and $\\omega_{CL}^{2}$). The estimation process inherently combines information from the individual's data (via the likelihood function) with information from the population (via the prior distribution of $\\eta_{CL,i}$). This causes the EBEs to be \"shrunk\" from the values that would be estimated using only individual data, toward the mean of the population prior, which is $0$.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as shrinkage, is more pronounced for individuals with sparse or uninformative data. As a result, the collection of EBEs, $\\{\\hat{\\eta}_{CL,1}, \\hat{\\eta}_{CL,2}, \\dots, \\hat{\\eta}_{CL,N}\\}$, will exhibit less variability than the true underlying random effects. That is, the variance of the EBEs across the subjects is expected to be smaller than the population variance: $Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL}) < \\omega_{CL}^{2}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Eta-Shrinkage Formula**\n\nEta-shrinkage ($\\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta}$) is defined as the proportional or relative reduction in the variance of the EBEs compared to the true population variance.\n\nLet $\\omega_{CL}^{2}$ represent the true population variance of the random effects.\nLet $Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL})$ represent the variance of the distribution of the corresponding EBEs.\n\nThe absolute reduction in variance due to shrinkage is the difference between the population variance and the variance of the EBEs:\n$$ \\text{Absolute Reduction} = \\omega_{CL}^{2} - Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL}) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the *relative reduction*. To find this, we normalize the absolute reduction by the original population variance, $\\omega_{CL}^{2}$:\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Reduction}}{\\text{Population Variance}} = \\frac{\\omega_{CL}^{2} - Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL})}{\\omega_{CL}^{2}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by separating the terms in the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = \\frac{\\omega_{CL}^{2}}{\\omega_{CL}^{2}} - \\frac{Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL})}{\\omega_{CL}^{2}} $$\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = 1 - \\frac{Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL})}{\\omega_{CL}^{2}} $$\nThis is the standard formula for calculating eta-shrinkage. In practice, the true variances are unknown and are replaced by their estimates obtained from model fitting. Specifically, $\\omega_{CL}^{2}$ is the model-estimated IIV, and $Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL})$ is estimated by the across-subject sample variance of the computed EBEs.\n\n**3. Calculation of Eta-Shrinkage for Clearance**\n\nThe problem provides the necessary estimated values:\n- The estimated population variance for clearance: $\\omega_{CL}^{2} = 0.36$.\n- The across-subject sample variance of the EBEs for clearance: $Var(\\hat{\\eta}_{CL}) = 0.09$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = 1 - \\frac{0.09}{0.36} $$\nWe first compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{0.09}{0.36} = \\frac{9}{36} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nNow, we complete the calculation for shrinkage:\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.75$ is exact based on the inputs. To express this with four significant figures, we append two trailing zeros.\n$$ \\text{Shrinkage}_{\\eta, CL} = 0.7500 $$\nThis indicates a $75\\%$ reduction in variability of the EBEs relative to the estimated population variability, which is a high degree of shrinkage and would typically warrant scrutiny of the model adequacy and data informativeness for the clearance parameter.",
