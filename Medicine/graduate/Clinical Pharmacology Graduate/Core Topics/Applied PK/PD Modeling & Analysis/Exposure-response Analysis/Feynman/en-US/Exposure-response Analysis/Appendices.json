It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem is based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination. The rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k A(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The concentration of the drug, $C(t)$, is related to the amount by the volume of distribution, $V$, such that $C(t) = A(t)/V$.\n\nClearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. It relates the rate of elimination to the concentration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t) = k A(t) = k \\cdot V \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of $CL$ and $V$.\n\n**Calculation of the elimination rate constant, $k$**\nFrom the definition $CL \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot V \\cdot C(t)$, we can solve for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{CL}{V}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nk = \\frac{5 \\text{ L/h}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 0.1 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of steady-state concentrations, $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$**\nAt steady state, the drug concentration profile is periodic. Let $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$ be the concentration just before a dose is administered, and $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$ be the concentration immediately after the dose.\nFollowing an instantaneous IV bolus dose $D$, the concentration increases by $D/V$. Thus, the peak concentration is:\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} + \\frac{D}{V}\n$$\nDuring the dosing interval of length $\\tau$, the concentration decays from $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$ according to first-order elimination:\n$$\nC(t) = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\exp(-kt) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t < \\tau\n$$\nAt the end of the interval, $t=\\tau$, the concentration returns to the minimum value, $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$\nC_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\exp(-k\\tau)\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$. To solve for $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$, we substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\frac{D}{V}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}(1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)) = \\frac{D}{V}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{D/V}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}\n$$\nOnce $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$ is found, we can find $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\exp(-k\\tau) = \\frac{D/V \\cdot \\exp(-k\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerical values.\nFirst, we need the exponent $k\\tau$ and the concentration increase $D/V$.\n$$\nk\\tau = (0.1 \\text{ h}^{-1}) \\cdot (12 \\text{ h}) = 1.2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 4 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nNow we can calculate $C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ mg/L}}{1 - \\exp(-1.2)} \\approx \\frac{4}{1 - 0.301194} \\approx \\frac{4}{0.698806} \\approx 5.72375 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nAnd $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\cdot \\exp(-1.2) \\approx (5.72375) \\cdot (0.301194) \\approx 1.72375 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nNote that we can also verify this using $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} - D/V \\approx 5.72375 - 4 = 1.72375$ mg/L, which confirms the calculation.\n\n**Calculation of the Area Under the Curve, $AUC_{0-\\tau}$**\nA fundamental principle of linear pharmacokinetics at steady state is that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. Over one dosing interval, the total amount of drug administered is $D$. The total amount eliminated is the integral of the elimination rate over the interval, which is $CL \\cdot AUC_{0-\\tau}$.\n$$\n\\text{Amount In} = \\text{Amount Out}\n$$\n$$\nD = CL \\cdot AUC_{0-\\tau}\n$$\nTherefore, the area under the concentration-time curve over one dosing interval at steady state is:\n$$\nAUC_{0-\\tau} = \\frac{D}{CL}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nAUC_{0-\\tau} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ L/h}} = 40 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}\n$$\n\n**Final Results and Rounding**\nThe problem requires each computed quantity to be rounded to four significant figures.\n- $k = 0.1 \\text{ h}^{-1}$.

It describes the derivation and application of the Sigmoid Emax model, a fundamental and widely used concept in pharmacodynamics for describing exposure-response relationships. The model is based on the law of mass action and receptor theory, which are established scientific principles. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and parameters to derive the function $E(C)$ and perform the required calculations and analysis. The language is objective and precise. The parameters provided are physically realistic. There are no internal contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Exposure-Response Function $E(C)$\n\nThe problem statement asserts that the fractional occupancy, which we denote as $f_{occ}(C)$, follows the Hill-Langmuir form. This relationship describes the fraction of receptor sites bound by a ligand as a function of the ligand's concentration. The general form is:\n$$\nf_{occ}(C) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{K_d^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}\n$$\nwhere $K_d$ is the dissociation constant and $\\gamma$ is the Hill coefficient, representing the degree of cooperativity in binding.\n\nThe problem provides a definition for the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$, as the concentration at which fractional occupancy is $1/2$. We apply this condition:\n$$\nf_{occ}(EC_{50}) = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\gamma}}{K_d^{\\gamma} + EC_{50}^{\\gamma}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $K_d^{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n2 \\cdot EC_{50}^{\\gamma} = K_d^{\\gamma} + EC_{50}^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nK_d^{\\gamma} = EC_{50}^{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that, under these definitions, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is equivalent to $EC_{50}$. We can therefore substitute $EC_{50}$ for $K_d$ in the occupancy equation:\n$$\nf_{occ}(C) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}\n$$\nNext, we formulate the observable effect, $E(C)$. It is stated to be the sum of a baseline effect, $E_0$, and an incremental effect proportional to the fractional occupancy. Let this proportionality be represented by a constant $k$.\n$$\nE(C) = E_0 + k \\cdot f_{occ}(C)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the incremental effect saturates at a maximum value, $E_{\\max}$, as the concentration $C$ approaches infinity. We examine the limit of $E(C)$ as $C \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} E(C) = E_0 + k \\cdot \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} f_{occ}(C)\n$$\nThe limit of the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}} = \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{(EC_{50}/C)^{\\gamma} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0 + 1} = 1\n$$\nThus, as $C \\to \\infty$, the total effect is $E_0 + k$. The incremental effect is $k$. This is defined as $E_{\\max}$. Therefore, the proportionality constant $k$ is equal to $E_{\\max}$.\n\nSubstituting $k = E_{\\max}$ and the derived expression for $f_{occ}(C)$ into the equation for $E(C)$, we obtain the final exposure-response function:\n$$\nE(C) = E_0 + E_{\\max} \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}\n$$\n\n### Part 1: Numerical Computations\n\nWe are given the parameters $E_0 = 10$, $E_{\\max} = 30$, $EC_{50} = 2$ mg/L, and $\\gamma = 2$. The specific exposure-response function is:\n$$\nE(C) = 10 + 30 \\frac{C^2}{2^2 + C^2} = 10 + 30 \\frac{C^2}{4 + C^2}\n$$\nWe now compute the effect $E(C)$ for the three specified concentrations.\n\nFor $C = 0.5$ mg/L:\n$$\nE(0.5) = 10 + 30 \\frac{(0.5)^2}{4 + (0.5)^2} = 10 + 30 \\frac{0.25}{4 + 0.25} = 10 + 30 \\frac{0.25}{4.25} = 10 + \\frac{7.5}{4.25}\n$$\n$$\nE(0.5) \\approx 10 + 1.76470588... = 11.76470588...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E(0.5) = 11.76$.\n\nFor $C = 2$ mg/L:\nSince $C=EC_{50}$, the fractional term should be exactly $1/2$. Let's verify:\n$$\nE(2) = 10 + 30 \\frac{2^2}{4 + 2^2} = 10 + 30 \\frac{4}{4 + 4} = 10 + 30 \\frac{4}{8} = 10 + 30 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 10 + 15 = 25\n$$\nThe result is exactly $25$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $25.00$.\n\nFor $C = 8$ mg/L:\n$$\nE(8) = 10 + 30 \\frac{8^2}{4 + 8^2} = 10 + 30 \\frac{64}{4 + 64} = 10 + 30 \\frac{64}{68} = 10 + 30 \\frac{16}{17}\n$$\n$$\nE(8) = 10 + \\frac{480}{17} \\approx 10 + 28.2352941... = 38.2352941...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E(8) = 38.24$.\n\n### Part 2: Analytical Interpretation of the Steepest Slope\n\nThe \"steepest increase in effect per unit change in concentration\" corresponds to the maximum value of the first derivative of $E(C)$ with respect to $C$, which is $\\frac{dE}{dC}$. This maximum occurs at an inflection point of the $E(C)$ curve, which can be found by setting the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2E}{dC^2}$, to zero.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative, $\\frac{dE}{dC}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( E_0 + E_{\\max} \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}} \\right) = E_{\\max} \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule, where $u = C^{\\gamma}$ and $v = EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dC} = E_{\\max} \\frac{(\\gamma C^{\\gamma-1})(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}) - C^{\\gamma}(\\gamma C^{\\gamma-1})}{(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dC} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\gamma EC_{50}^{\\gamma} C^{\\gamma-1} + \\gamma C^{2\\gamma-1} - \\gamma C^{2\\gamma-1}}{(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2} = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\gamma EC_{50}^{\\gamma} C^{\\gamma-1}}{(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the slope of the exposure-response curve. To find the concentration at which this slope is maximal, we must find the derivative of this expression with respect to $C$ and set it to zero. Let $A = E_{\\max} \\gamma EC_{50}^{\\gamma}$ be a constant. We need to find $\\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C^{\\gamma-1}}{(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2} \\right) = 0$.\nApplying the quotient rule again, with $u=C^{\\gamma-1}$ and $v=(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\gamma-1)C^{\\gamma-2}(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^2 - C^{\\gamma-1} [2(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})(\\gamma C^{\\gamma-1})]}{(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})^4} = 0\n$$\nFor the numerator to be zero (and assuming $C>0$ and $\\gamma>1$), we can divide by $C^{\\gamma-2}$ and $(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma})$:\n$$\n(\\gamma-1)(EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}) - 2\\gamma C^{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\gamma-1)EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + (\\gamma-1)C^{\\gamma} - 2\\gamma C^{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\gamma-1)EC_{50}^{\\gamma} = (2\\gamma - \\gamma + 1)C^{\\gamma} = (\\gamma+1)C^{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\gamma} = EC_{50}^{\\gamma} \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1}\n$$\nTaking the $1/\\gamma$ power of both sides gives the concentration, $C_{inflect}$, at the inflection point:\n$$\nC_{inflect} = EC_{50} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis result is physically meaningful for $\\gamma > 1$. If $\\gamma \\le 1$, the slope is maximal at $C=0$.\n\nInterpretation: The concentration regime exhibiting the steepest increase in effect is centered around the inflection point of the sigmoid curve, located at the concentration $C_{inflect}$. The location of this regime is directly proportional to $EC_{50}$. The dependence on the Hill coefficient $\\gamma$ is such that as $\\gamma$ increases (representing higher cooperativity), the term $\\left(\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1}\\right)^{1/\\gamma}$ approaches $1$, causing the point of steepest slope to move closer to $EC_{50}$. Thus, higher cooperativity concentrates the most sensitive part of the response curve nearer to the $EC_{50}$. For the specific case in this problem where $\\gamma=2$, the steepest slope occurs at $C = EC_{50} \\left( \\frac{2-1}{2+1} \\right)^{1/2} = EC_{50}/\\sqrt{3}$.",

Therefore:\n$$ \\text{Rate in} = \\text{Rate out} $$\n$$ \\frac{D}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration yields:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{D}{CL \\cdot \\tau} $$\nSince the concentration is constant at steady state under this specific dosing regimen, the minimum, maximum, and average concentrations are all equal:\n$$ C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\mathrm{avg},\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nThe problem defines the exposure-response target as $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} \\ge 2$ $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$. Using our derived expression, this target becomes:\n$$ \\frac{D}{CL \\cdot \\tau} \\ge 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L} $$\nWe are tasked with finding the minimal dose $D$ that ensures the Probability of Target Attainment (PTA) is at least $0.8$. The PTA is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population will meet the target. Since $CL$ is the variable that differs across the population, we express this as:\n$$ \\mathrm{PTA} = P\\left( \\frac{D}{CL \\cdot \\tau} \\ge 2 \\right) \\ge 0.8 $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we first isolate the random variable $CL$:\n$$ CL \\le \\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau} $$\nThe condition on the dose $D$ is therefore:\n$$ P\\left( CL \\le \\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau} \\right) \\ge 0.8 $$\nWe are given that $CL$ follows a lognormal distribution, such that $\\ln(CL)$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = \\ln 5$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.3$.\n$$ \\ln(CL) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=\\ln 5, \\sigma^2=0.3^2) $$\nSince the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality for $CL$ can be transformed into an inequality for $\\ln(CL)$:\n$$ \\ln(CL) \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau}\\right) $$\nThe probability statement becomes:\n$$ P\\left( \\ln(CL) \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau}\\right) \\right) \\ge 0.8 $$\nTo use the standard normal distribution, we standardize the variable $\\ln(CL)$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The transformation is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\ln(CL) - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\ln(CL) - \\ln 5}{0.3} $$\nApplying this transformation to our inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(CL) - \\ln 5}{0.3} \\le \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau}\\right) - \\ln 5}{0.3} $$\nThe probability statement is now in terms of $Z$:\n$$ P\\left( Z \\le \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2\\tau}\\right) - \\ln 5}{0.3} \\right) \\ge 0.8 $$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, where $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. The condition is:\n$$ \\Phi\\left( \\frac{\\ln(D/(2\\tau)) - \\ln 5}{0.3} \\right) \\ge 0.8 $$\nTo find the minimal dose $D$, we solve for the case where the equality holds:\n$$ \\Phi\\left( \\frac{\\ln(D/(2\\tau)) - \\ln 5}{0.3} \\right) = 0.8 $$\nLet $z_{0.8}$ be the $80^{th}$ percentile of the standard normal distribution, i.e., $z_{0.8} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.8)$. We have:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(D/(2\\tau)) - \\ln 5}{0.3} = z_{0.8} $$\nNow, we solve for $D$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2\\tau}\\right) - \\ln 5 = 0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8} $$\nUsing logarithm properties, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{2 \\cdot \\tau \\cdot 5}\\right) = 0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{10\\tau}\\right) = 0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8} $$\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$ \\frac{D}{10\\tau} = \\exp(0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8}) $$\n$$ D = 10 \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\exp(0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8}) $$\nWe are given $\\tau = 12$ hours. The value of $z_{0.8}$ from standard normal tables or a calculator is approximately $0.84162$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ D = 10 \\cdot 12 \\cdot \\exp(0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8}) $$\n$$ D = 120 \\cdot \\exp(0.3 \\cdot 0.84162123) $$\n$$ D = 120 \\cdot \\exp(0.25248637) $$\n$$ D = 120 \\cdot 1.28722005 $$\n$$ D \\approx 154.466406 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ D \\approx 154.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe final expression can also be written in terms of the problem parameters: $C_{target} = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$, $\\tau = 12 \\, \\mathrm{h}$, the median of the clearance distribution $CL_{median} = 5 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$, the log-space standard deviation $\\sigma_{lnCL} = 0.3$, and the target probability $p=0.8$.\n$$ D = C_{target} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot CL_{median} \\cdot \\exp(\\sigma_{lnCL} \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(p)) $$\n$$ D = (2 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}) \\cdot (12 \\, \\mathrm{h}) \\cdot (5 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}) \\cdot \\exp(0.3 \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(0.8)) = 120 \\cdot \\exp(0.3 \\cdot z_{0.8}) $$\nThis confirms the consistency of the derivation and calculation. The result is $154.5$ mg.",
