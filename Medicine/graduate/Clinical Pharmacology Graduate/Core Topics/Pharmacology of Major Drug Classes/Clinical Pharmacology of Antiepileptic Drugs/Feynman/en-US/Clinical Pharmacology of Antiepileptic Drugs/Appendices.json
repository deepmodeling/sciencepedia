            "problem": "A critically ill adult requires rapid attainment of a therapeutic total plasma concentration of phenytoin. Assume a one-compartment model with instantaneous mixing and negligible elimination during the brief distribution phase after an intravenous loading dose. The patient weighs $80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The clinically targeted total plasma concentration is $15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. The apparent volume of distribution for phenytoin in adults is $0.7\\ \\mathrm{L/kg}$. You will administer intravenous phenytoin sodium, which has a salt factor $S = 0.92$ (meaning that a fraction $S$ of the labeled salt mass is phenytoin base, the active moiety). Intravenous bioavailability is $F = 1$. Assume no phenytoin is present at baseline.\n\nStarting from the definition of apparent volume of distribution and mass conservation at the end of an intravenous bolus in a one-compartment model, derive the relationship between the administered phenytoin sodium loading dose and the immediate post-distribution total plasma concentration that correctly accounts for the salt factor. Then compute the numerical loading dose of phenytoin sodium required to achieve the target total plasma concentration. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{mg}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a formula for the intravenous loading dose of a drug salt and its subsequent calculation for phenytoin sodium. The derivation will be based on the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics within a one-compartment model.\n\nLet $LD$ be the administered loading dose of the drug salt (in this case, phenytoin sodium). The mass of the active drug moiety (phenytoin base) in this dose is a fraction $S$ of the total mass, where $S$ is the salt factor. Therefore, the mass of active drug administered is $S \\times LD$.\n\nThe bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of the administered active drug that reaches the systemic circulation. The total mass of active drug entering the systemic circulation, which we denote as the bioavailable dose $A$, is given by the principle of mass conservation:\n$$A = F \\times S \\times LD$$\nFor an intravenous administration, the entire dose reaches the systemic circulation, so the bioavailability is $F=1$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$A = S \\times LD$$\n\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, is a proportionality constant that relates the total amount of drug in the body at a given time to the concentration of the drug in the plasma, $C$. By definition:\n$$V_d = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug in the body}}{\\text{Plasma concentration}}$$\nIn our model, we consider the state immediately after the intravenous bolus has been administered and has distributed instantaneously throughout the single compartment, at time $t=0$. At this point, the amount of drug in the body is the bioavailable dose $A$, and the plasma concentration is the initial concentration, $C_0$. The relationship is therefore:\n$$V_d = \\frac{A}{C_0}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the total amount of drug in the body as:\n$$A = C_0 \\times V_d$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for the bioavailable dose, $A$. Equating them establishes the direct relationship between the loading dose of the drug salt and the resulting initial plasma concentration:\n$$S \\times LD = C_0 \\times V_d$$\nThis is the general relationship for an intravenous loading dose. To solve for the loading dose $LD$ required to achieve a target initial concentration, which we denote as $C_{target}$, we rearrange the formula:\n$$LD = \\frac{C_{target} \\times V_d}{S}$$\nThis is the derived relationship requested in the problem. Note that we have set $F=1$ as is appropriate for intravenous administration.\n\nNow we can proceed to the numerical calculation using the provided data.\nThe givens are:\nPatient weight, $W = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nTarget total plasma concentration, $C_{target} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nApparent volume of distribution per unit weight, $v_d = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{L/kg}$.\nSalt factor for phenytoin sodium, $S = 0.92$.\nBioavailability, $F = 1$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, for this specific patient. It is the product of the per-kilogram value and the patient's weight:\n$$V_d = v_d \\times W$$\n$$V_d = (0.7\\ \\mathrm{L/kg}) \\times (80\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 56\\ \\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the values for $C_{target}$, $V_d$, and $S$ into our derived formula for the loading dose $LD$:\n$$LD = \\frac{C_{target} \\times V_d}{S}$$\n$$LD = \\frac{(15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}) \\times (56\\ \\mathrm{L})}{0.92}$$\nThe product in the numerator is:\n$$15 \\times 56 = 840$$\nSo the expression for the loading dose in milligrams is:\n$$LD = \\frac{840}{0.92}\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$LD \\approx 913.043478... \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$LD \\approx 913\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis is the calculated loading dose of phenytoin sodium required to achieve the target plasma concentration in the specified patient.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a maintenance dose for levetiracetam in a patient with reduced renal function, targeting a specific average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$).\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass balance at steady state. Over one dosing interval, $\\tau$, the amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation must equal the amount eliminated from the body. The amount that enters the circulation is the product of the bioavailability, $F$, and the administered dose, $\\text{Dose}$. The amount eliminated over the interval is the product of the total body clearance, $\\text{CL}$, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over that interval, $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$.\n\n$$F \\times \\text{Dose} = \\text{CL} \\times \\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$$\n\nThe average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$, is defined as the $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$ divided by the dosing interval, $\\tau$:\n\n$$C_{ss,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}}{\\tau}$$\n\nSubstituting $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} = C_{ss,\\text{avg}} \\times \\tau$ into the mass balance equation yields:\n\n$$F \\times \\text{Dose} = \\text{CL} \\times C_{ss,\\text{avg}} \\times \\tau$$\n\nRearranging to solve for the maintenance dose gives the fundamental equation for our calculation.

The problem states that total clearance is the sum of renal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{R}}$) and nonrenal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{NR}}$). The patient's total clearance is thus:\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{R, patient}} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{NR, patient}}$$\n\nWe are instructed to model the patient's clearance by first determining the clearance components for an individual with normal renal function ($\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}} = 100$ mL/min) and then adjusting the renal component for the patient's specific renal function.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total clearance for a reference individual, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}$. Clearance is related to the elimination rate constant, $k_e$, and the volume of distribution, $V_d$, by $\\text{CL} = k_e \\times V_d$. The rate constant is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by $k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$. The patient's volume of distribution, $V_d$, is calculated from the given specific volume, $V_{d,ss}$, and the patient's weight, $W$.\n\n$$V_d = V_{d,ss} \\times W = (0.7 \\text{ L/kg}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg}) = 49 \\text{ L}$$\n\nUsing the half-life at normal renal function, $t_{1/2, \\text{ref}} = 7.0$ h, the total clearance in a reference individual of this weight would be:\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2, \\text{ref}}} \\times V_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{7.0 \\text{ h}} \\times 49 \\text{ L} = 7.0 \\times \\ln(2) \\text{ L/h}$$\n\nNext, we partition $\\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}$ into its renal and nonrenal components using the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine, $f_e = 0.66$.\n\nThe nonrenal clearance, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{NR}}$, is assumed to be independent of renal function. Therefore, the patient's nonrenal clearance is the same as the reference nonrenal clearance.\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{NR, patient}} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{NR}} = (1 - f_e) \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} = (1 - 0.66) \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} = 0.34 \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}$$\n\nThe renal clearance at normal function, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{R, ref}}$, is given by:\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{R, ref}} = f_e \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} = 0.66 \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}$$\n\nThe problem states that renal clearance scales in direct proportion to the patient's creatinine clearance ($\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}$) relative to the reference value ($\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}$).\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{R, patient}} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{R, ref}} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) = (f_e \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the patient's total clearance:\n\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{NR, patient}} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{R, patient}}$$\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} = (1 - f_e) \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} + f_e \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} \\left[ (1 - f_e) + f_e \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values to calculate $\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}}$.\nFirst, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{ref}} = 7.0 \\times \\ln(2) \\text{ L/h} \\approx 4.85198 \\text{ L/h}$$\nNext, the adjustment factor for renal function:\n$$\\left[ (1 - 0.66) + 0.66 \\left(\\frac{30 \\text{ mL/min}}{100 \\text{ mL/min}}\\right) \\right] = \\left[ 0.34 + 0.66 \\times 0.3 \\right] = [0.34 + 0.198] = 0.538$$\nSo, the patient's total clearance is:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} = (4.85198 \\text{ L/h}) \\times 0.538 = 2.610365 \\text{ L/h}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required maintenance dose using the target concentration $C_{ss,\\text{avg}} = 20$ mg/L, dosing interval $\\tau = 12$ h, and bioavailability $F = 1.0$.\n\n$$\\text{Dose} = \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{avg}} \\times \\text{CL}_{\\text{patient}} \\times \\tau}{F} = \\frac{(20 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (2.610365 \\text{ L/h}) \\times (12 \\text{ h})}{1.0}$$\n\n$$\\text{Dose} = 20 \\times 2.610365 \\times 12 \\text{ mg} \\approx 626.4876 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we get $626$ mg.",
