You will use the well-established Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate a patient's renal function, a critical determinant of aminoglycoside clearance. By applying one-compartment pharmacokinetic principles for multiple dosing, you will then calculate a dosing interval that is tailored to the patient's individual characteristics to ensure safety. ",

            "problem": "A $68$-year-old female with measured body weight $W = 52$ kg and serum creatinine $SCr = 1.4$ mg/dL is to receive an intravenous aminoglycoside with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity. Assume linear pharmacokinetics, a one-compartment body model, and first-order elimination. The aminoglycoside is administered as instantaneous intravenous bolus doses every $\\tau$ hours, with bioavailability $F = 1$, negligible plasma protein binding, and renal elimination approximated by glomerular filtration. The target is to maintain the steady-state trough concentration immediately before the next dose less than $1$ mg/L to minimize nephrotoxicity while permitting high peaks.\n\nUse the Cockcroft–Gault creatinine clearance formula, including the sex-specific multiplier for females,\n$$CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times W}{72 \\times SCr} \\times 0.85,$$\nto estimate renal function. Model the drug’s total clearance as equal to creatinine clearance converted to liters per hour. Use a volume of distribution $V_d = 0.25$ L/kg and an initial dose $D = 5$ mg/kg.\n\nStarting from first principles of one-compartment first-order elimination and the superposition principle for multiple dosing, determine the minimal dosing interval $\\tau$ (in hours) such that the steady-state trough concentration equals $1$ mg/L. Intervals longer than this will maintain the trough below $1$ mg/L. Express the final dosing interval in hours and round your answer to three significant figures. Use mg/L for concentrations and hours for time units throughout.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical pharmacokinetics, is self-contained, well-posed, objective, and provides realistic clinical data for a formalizable calculation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimal dosing interval $\\tau$ for an intravenous aminoglycoside administered as a bolus dose, such that the steady-state trough concentration, $C_{ss,min}$, is exactly $1$ mg/L. A longer interval would result in a trough concentration below this target.\n\nThe analysis is based on a one-compartment body model with first-order elimination. For a single instantaneous intravenous bolus dose $D$, the plasma concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_0 = \\frac{D}{V_d}$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$, $V_d$ is the volume of distribution, and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nFor a multiple dosing regimen with a constant dose $D$ administered every $\\tau$ hours, the superposition principle leads to the concentration at steady state. The trough concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,min}$, which occurs immediately before the next dose, is given by the sum of the residual concentrations from all previous doses. This can be expressed as:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nwhere $C_{ss,max}$ is the peak concentration at steady state. The peak concentration is given by:\n$$C_{ss,max} = \\frac{D/V_d}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss,max}$ into the equation for $C_{ss,min}$ yields:\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\left( \\frac{D/V_d}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} \\right) \\exp(-k_e \\tau) = \\frac{D}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nWe must solve this equation for the dosing interval $\\tau$.

For fluoroquinolones, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that best correlates with efficacy against Gram-negative organisms is the ratio of the 24-hour free (unbound) area under the concentration–time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration, denoted $fAUC_{24}/MIC$. The clinician selects a target $fAUC_{24}/MIC$ of $125$ based on organism susceptibility and clinical goals. Levofloxacin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in this patient, its absolute oral bioavailability is $F=0.99$, plasma protein binding is $30\\%$, and the total body clearance is $CL=12$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$.

Round your answer to four significant figures and express the dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a single daily oral dose of levofloxacin to achieve a predefined pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target. The solution will be systematically derived using fundamental definitions from clinical pharmacology.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem is established. All provided data and definitions are standard in the field of pharmacokinetics and are scientifically sound.\n- Target PK/PD index: $\\frac{fAUC_{24}}{MIC} = 125$\n- Absolute oral bioavailability: $F = 0.99$\n- Plasma protein binding: $30\\%$\n- Total body clearance: $CL = 12 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$\n- Minimum inhibitory concentration: $MIC = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n- Dosing regimen: once-daily, at steady state.

The values are clinically realistic for levofloxacin therapy. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination. For an orally administered drug, the average rate of administration over a dosing interval $\\tau$ is $\\frac{F \\times \\text{Dose}}{\\tau}$.
