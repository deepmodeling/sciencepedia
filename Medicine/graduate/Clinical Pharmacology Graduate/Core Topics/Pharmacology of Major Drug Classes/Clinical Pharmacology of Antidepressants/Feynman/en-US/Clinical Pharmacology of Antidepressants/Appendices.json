            "problem": "An unknown antidepressant is characterized in vitro by radioligand displacement assays at physiological temperature. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) are measured as follows: $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 60~\\mathrm{nM}$. In a representative patient at steady state, the total plasma trough concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} = 160~\\mathrm{nM}$, with a free (unbound) plasma fraction $f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.05$.

The use of equilibrium dissociation constants ($K_i$), plasma concentrations, free fractions ($f_u$), and brain-plasma partitioning ($K_{p,uu}$) are standard methodologies in clinical pharmacology and drug development. The law of mass action is a fundamental principle governing receptor-ligand interactions. The values provided for the parameters are within a realistic range for known antidepressant drugs. The classification scheme (SSRI, SNRI, TCA) based on transporter affinity and selectivity is a core concept in psychopharmacology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to calculate the required quantities. The questions asked—determining preferential occupancy, mechanistic classification, and calculating a specific ratio—have a clear path to a unique solution based on the provided data and first principles.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The data and assumptions are self-contained and consistent. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, calculation of the free drug concentration in the brain; second, calculation of the fractional occupancy for both SERT and NET at this concentration to determine preferential binding and classification; and third, calculation of the selectivity ratio.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Free Brain Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}$)**\n\nThe free drug concentration in the brain's interstitial fluid is the pharmacologically active concentration that interacts with the transporters. It is given by the formula:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} \\times f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} \\times K_{p,uu}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} = 160~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.05$$\n$$K_{p,uu} = 0.70$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = (160~\\mathrm{nM}) \\times 0.05 \\times 0.70$$\nFirst, calculate the free plasma concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} \\times f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} = 160~\\mathrm{nM} \\times 0.05 = 8~\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNext, calculate the free brain concentration:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} \\times K_{p,uu} = 8~\\mathrm{nM} \\times 0.70 = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Transporter Occupancy and Mechanistic Classification**\n\nThe fractional occupancy ($\\theta$) of a transporter by a ligand at equilibrium is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation, which derives from the law of mass action. For a single binding site, it is given by:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_i}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration (here, $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}$) and $K_i$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the transporter.\n\n**SERT Occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{SERT}}$):**\nUsing $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{SERT}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} + K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}}} = \\frac{5.6}{5.6 + 0.90} = \\frac{5.6}{6.5} \\approx 0.8615$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $86.2\\%$ occupancy of the serotonin transporter.\n\n**NET Occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{NET}}$):**\nUsing $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 60~\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{NET}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} + K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}}} = \\frac{5.6}{5.6 + 60} = \\frac{5.6}{65.6} \\approx 0.08536$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $8.5\\%$ occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter.\n\n**Mechanistic Classification:**\nThe calculations show that at clinically relevant steady-state concentrations, the drug occupies a very high fraction of SERT ($\\approx 86\\%$) while occupying a very low fraction of NET ($\\approx 8.5\\%$). This dramatic preference for SERT over NET is the defining characteristic of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). A serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) would exhibit substantial occupancy of both transporters. Therefore, the drug preferentially occupies SERT over NET, and its mechanistic classification is an SSRI.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Selectivity Ratio**\n\nThe problem defines the selectivity ratio as the ratio of the dissociation constants for NET and SERT. This ratio quantifies the drug's preference for SERT over NET; a higher value indicates greater selectivity for SERT.\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} = \\frac{K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}}}{K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 60~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} = \\frac{60}{0.90} = \\frac{600}{9} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} \\approx 66.7$$\nThe ratio is a unitless quantity since the units of concentration ($\\mathrm{nM}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Competitive Occupancy Relationship\nLet $R$ denote the free serotonin transporter (SERT), $F$ denote fluoxetine, and $N$ denote norfluoxetine. The system involves two simultaneous competitive binding equilibria at the same site:\n$$ R + F \\rightleftharpoons RF $$\n$$ R + N \\rightleftharpoons RN $$\nwhere $RF$ and $RN$ are the receptor-ligand complexes.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constants, $K_{d,F}$ and $K_{d,N}$, are defined as:\n$$ K_{d,F} = \\frac{[R][F]}{[RF]} $$\n$$ K_{d,N} = \\frac{[R][N]}{[RN]} $$\nHere, $[X]$ represents the molar concentration of species $X$ at the site of action, which is the brain interstitial fluid.\n\nWe can rearrange these equations to express the concentrations of the occupied receptor states in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$ and the unbound ligand concentrations $[F]$ and $[N]$:\n$$ [RF] = \\frac{[R][F]}{K_{d,F}} $$\n$$ [RN] = \\frac{[R][N]}{K_{d,N}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of all *occupied* SERT sites that are occupied by norfluoxetine. Let this fraction be denoted by $\\mathcal{F}_N$. This is the ratio of the concentration of SERT sites bound by norfluoxetine to the total concentration of all occupied SERT sites.\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_N = \\frac{\\text{Sites occupied by N}}{\\text{Total occupied sites}} = \\frac{[RN]}{[RF] + [RN]} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $[RF]$ and $[RN]$ into this equation:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_N = \\frac{\\frac{[R][N]}{K_{d,N}}}{\\frac{[R][F]}{K_{d,F}} + \\frac{[R][N]}{K_{d,N}}} $$\n\nThe free receptor concentration $[R]$ is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_N = \\frac{\\frac{[N]}{K_{d,N}}}{\\frac{[F]}{K_{d,F}} + \\frac{[N]}{K_{d,N}}} $$\nThis is the required relationship. It demonstrates that the relative contribution of each ligand to the occupied receptor pool is determined by the ratio of its concentration to its dissociation constant at the target site.\n\n### Calculation\nThe calculation proceeds in four steps:\n1.  Calculate the unbound drug concentrations in plasma ($C_{u,p}$).\n2.  Calculate the unbound drug concentrations in the brain interstitial fluid ($C_{u,brain}$).\n3.  Convert these concentrations from mass units (ng/mL) to molar units (nM) to be consistent with the $K_d$ values.\n4.  Apply the derived formula for $\\mathcal{F}_N$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate unbound plasma concentrations ($C_{u,p}$)**\nThe unbound concentration in plasma is the product of the total plasma concentration ($C_p$) and the unbound fraction ($f_{u,p}$).\nFor fluoxetine (F):\n$$ C_{u,p,F} = C_{p,F} \\times f_{u,p,F} = (300 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\times 0.05 = 15 \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nFor norfluoxetine (N):\n$$ C_{u,p,N} = C_{p,N} \\times f_{u,p,N} = (500 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\times 0.08 = 40 \\text{ ng/mL} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate unbound brain concentrations ($C_{u,brain}$)**\nThe unbound concentration in the brain is determined by the unbound plasma concentration and the unbound brain-to-unbound plasma partition coefficient ($K_{p,uu}$).\n$$ C_{u,brain} = K_{p,uu} \\times C_{u,p} $$\nFor fluoxetine (F):\n$$ C_{u,brain,F} = K_{p,uu,F} \\times C_{u,p,F} = 0.6 \\times (15 \\text{ ng/mL}) = 9.0 \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nFor norfluoxetine (N):\n$$ C_{u,brain,N} = K_{p,uu,N} \\times C_{u,p,N} = 0.9 \\times (40 \\text{ ng/mL}) = 36 \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nThese concentrations correspond to $[F]$ and $[N]$ in the derived formula, but they must be converted to molar units.\n\n**Step 3: Convert concentrations to molar units (nM)**\nThe conversion from a mass concentration $C$ in ng/mL to a molar concentration in nM is given by:\n$$ \\text{Concentration [nM]} = \\frac{C \\text{ [ng/mL]} \\times 1000}{\\text{MW [g/mol]}} $$\nFor fluoxetine (F), the unbound brain concentration is $[F]$:\n$$ [F] = \\frac{9.0 \\text{ ng/mL} \\times 1000}{309.33 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 29.09514 \\text{ nM} $$\nFor norfluoxetine (N), the unbound brain concentration is $[N]$:\n$$ [N] = \\frac{36 \\text{ ng/mL} \\times 1000}{295.36 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 121.89226 \\text{ nM} $$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the fraction of occupied sites due to norfluoxetine ($\\mathcal{F}_N$)**\nUsing the derived formula with the calculated unbound brain concentrations and the given $K_d$ values ($K_{d,F} = 20$ nM, $K_{d,N} = 15$ nM):\nFirst, compute the concentration/$K_d$ ratios:\n$$ \\frac{[F]}{K_{d,F}} = \\frac{29.09514 \\text{ nM}}{20 \\text{ nM}} \\approx 1.454757 $$\n$$ \\frac{[N]}{K_{d,N}} = \\frac{121.89226 \\text{ nM}}{15 \\text{ nM}} \\approx 8.126151 $$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula for $\\mathcal{F}_N$:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_N = \\frac{\\frac{[N]}{K_{d,N}}}{\\frac{[F]}{K_{d,F}} + \\frac{[N]}{K_{d,N}}} = \\frac{8.126151}{1.454757 + 8.126151} = \\frac{8.126151}{9.580908} \\approx 0.848160 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_N \\approx 0.8482 $$\nThus, at steady state under these conditions, approximately $84.82\\%$ of the occupied serotonin transporters are bound by norfluoxetine, with the remaining $15.18\\%$ being bound by the parent drug, fluoxetine.",

Since $0.833 < 1.2$, a steady state exists.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,2}}{C_{ss,1}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1.2 - \\frac{5}{12}}{1.2 - 2 \\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right)} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1.2 - \\frac{5}{12}}{1.2 - \\frac{10}{12}}$$\nTo simplify, let's convert $1.2$ to a fraction: $1.2 = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,2}}{C_{ss,1}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{5}{12}}{\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{10}{12}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{5}{12}}{\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{5}{6}}$$\nFind common denominators for the numerator and denominator of the fraction:\n- Numerator: $\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 12 - 5 \\cdot 5}{60} = \\frac{72 - 25}{60} = \\frac{47}{60}$\n- Denominator: $\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 6 - 5 \\cdot 5}{30} = \\frac{36 - 25}{30} = \\frac{11}{30}$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,2}}{C_{ss,1}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{47}{60}}{\\frac{11}{30}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{47}{60} \\cdot \\frac{30}{11} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{47}{2 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{47}{11}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the decimal value and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{47}{11} \\approx 4.272727...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $4.273$. This demonstrates the non-linear relationship between dose and steady-state concentration: doubling the dose results in a greater than four-fold increase in the plasma concentration due to the saturation of metabolic pathways.",
