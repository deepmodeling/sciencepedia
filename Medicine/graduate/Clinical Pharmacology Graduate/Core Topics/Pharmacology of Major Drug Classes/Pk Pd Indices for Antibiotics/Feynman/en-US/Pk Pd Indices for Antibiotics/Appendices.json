The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a differential equation, an initial condition (implied by the IV bolus dose), and all necessary parameters to solve for the concentration profile $C(t)$. The quantity to be calculated, $f$, is clearly defined. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language. All terms are standard or explicitly defined.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: All required parameters are given. We must check for unit consistency. The dose is in grams ($\\mathrm{g}$), while the $MIC$ is in milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$). A conversion is necessary but straightforward.\n    -   $Dose = 2\\,\\mathrm{g} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n    -   $V = 20\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n    -   $CL = 6\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.\n    -   $MIC = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n    -   $\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n    The units are consistent (mass in $\\mathrm{mg}$, volume in $\\mathrm{L}$, time in $\\mathrm{h}$). The initial concentration would be $C(0) = \\frac{Dose}{V} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, which is greater than the $MIC$, a necessary condition for the problem to be meaningful. The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, is related to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, by $A(t) = V \\times C(t)$. Differentiating this with respect to time $t$ gives $\\frac{dA}{dt} = V \\frac{dC}{dt}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the given mass balance equation, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -CL \\times C(t)$, we obtain:\n$$V \\frac{dC}{dt} = -CL \\times C(t)$$\nRearranging yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V} C(t)$$\nLet us define the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_{el}$, as:\n$$k_{el} = \\frac{CL}{V}$$\nThe differential equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k_{el} C(t)$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-k_{el} t)$$\nwhere $C(0)$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$. For an intravenous bolus dose, the initial concentration is the dose divided by the volume of distribution:\n$$C(0) = \\frac{Dose}{V}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values. First, we ensure unit consistency. The dose is given as $Dose = 2\\,\\mathrm{g}$, which we convert to milligrams: $Dose = 2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nThe other parameters are $V = 20\\,\\mathrm{L}$ and $CL = 6\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.\n\nThe initial concentration is:\n$$C(0) = \\frac{2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe elimination rate constant is:\n$$k_{el} = \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$$\nThus, the plasma concentration at any time $t$ (in hours) is given by:\n$$C(t) = 100 \\exp(-0.3 t)$$\nwith $C(t)$ in units of $\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\nThe problem asks for $T_{>MIC}$, the time duration within the interval $[0, \\tau]$ for which $C(t) > MIC$. The minimum inhibitory concentration is given as $MIC = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$. We need to find the time interval where:\n$$100 \\exp(-0.3 t) > 2$$\nTo find the boundary of this interval, we first solve for the time $t_{MIC}$ at which the concentration equals the $MIC$:\n$$C(t_{MIC}) = MIC$$\n$$100 \\exp(-0.3 t_{MIC}) = 2$$\n$$\\exp(-0.3 t_{MIC}) = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-0.3 t_{MIC})) = \\ln(0.02)$$\n$$-0.3 t_{MIC} = \\ln(0.02)$$\n$$t_{MIC} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{0.3} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.02)}{0.3} = \\frac{\\ln(50)}{0.3}$$\nThe concentration $C(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function. Since $C(0)=100\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} > MIC=2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, the inequality $C(t) > MIC$ holds for all $t$ in the interval $[0, t_{MIC})$.\n\nWe are interested in the duration this condition holds *within* the dosing interval $[0, \\tau]$, where $\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Thus, $T_{>MIC}$ is the length of the intersection of the time intervals $[0, t_{MIC})$ and $[0, \\tau]$. This length is given by $\\min(t_{MIC}, \\tau)$.\n\nWe need to compare the value of $t_{MIC}$ with $\\tau=8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$t_{MIC} = \\frac{\\ln(50)}{0.3}\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nTo compare $t_{MIC}$ to $8$, we check if $\\frac{\\ln(50)}{0.3}$ is greater than $8$:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(50)}{0.3} > 8 \\iff \\ln(50) > 8 \\times 0.3 \\iff \\ln(50) > 2.4$$\nThis is equivalent to checking if $50 > \\exp(2.4)$.\nWe know that $e \\approx 2.718$, so $e^2 \\approx 7.39$. And $e^{2.4} = e^2 \\times e^{0.4}$. A calculator value for $e^{2.4}$ is approximately $11.023$. Since $50$ is clearly greater than $11.023$, the inequality $\\ln(50) > 2.4$ is true.\nTherefore, $t_{MIC} > \\tau$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the concentration at the end of the interval, $t=\\tau=8\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$C(8) = 100 \\exp(-0.3 \\times 8) = 100 \\exp(-2.4)$$\n$C(8) \\approx 100 \\times 0.090718 = 9.0718\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nSince $C(\\tau) = C(8) \\approx 9.07\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, which is greater than $MIC = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, and since $C(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function, the concentration $C(t)$ remains above the $MIC$ for the entire duration of the interval $[0, \\tau]$.\nThus, the condition $C(t) > MIC$ is satisfied for all $t \\in [0, \\tau]$.\nThe total duration $T_{>MIC}$ is the length of this interval, which is $\\tau$.\n$$T_{>MIC} = \\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction $f = \\frac{T_{>MIC}}{\\tau}$.\n$$f = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau} = 1$$\nThe result is an exact integer, so no approximation is required.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state peak concentration ($C_{max,ss}$) for a drug administered via repetitive intravenous (IV) bolus doses and the calculation of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index $C_{max,ss}/MIC$. We start from the fundamental principles of a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.\n\nThe concentration $C$ of a drug in a single compartment following an IV bolus dose, with no ongoing infusion, is governed by the differential equation for first-order elimination:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t) $$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant and $t$ is time. The solution to this linear ordinary differential equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$ C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt) $$\nFor an instantaneous IV bolus dose, the initial concentration at time $t=0$ is given by $C(0) = \\frac{Dose}{V}$, where $Dose$ is the amount of drug administered and $V$ is the volume of distribution. Thus, the concentration profile after a single dose is:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{Dose}{V} \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe problem states that the drug is administered every $\\tau$ hours. We use the principle of superposition to determine the concentration at steady state. The concentration present at any time is the sum of the concentrations remaining from all previous doses. Let's find the peak concentration, which occurs immediately after a dose is administered. The peak concentration just after the $n^{th}$ dose, $C_{max,n}$, is the sum of the newly administered dose and the residual concentrations from the previous $n-1$ doses:\n$$ C_{max,n} = \\frac{Dose}{V}\\exp(-k \\cdot 0) + \\frac{Dose}{V}\\exp(-k \\cdot \\tau) + \\frac{Dose}{V}\\exp(-k \\cdot 2\\tau) + \\dots + \\frac{Dose}{V}\\exp(-k \\cdot (n-1)\\tau) $$\nThis can be written as a sum:\n$$ C_{max,n} = \\frac{Dose}{V} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\exp(-ik\\tau) = \\frac{Dose}{V} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\exp(-k\\tau))^i $$\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{Dose}{V}$ and common ratio $r = \\exp(-k\\tau)$.

Since $k > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the common ratio $r = \\exp(-k\\tau)$ is between $0$ and $1$.
