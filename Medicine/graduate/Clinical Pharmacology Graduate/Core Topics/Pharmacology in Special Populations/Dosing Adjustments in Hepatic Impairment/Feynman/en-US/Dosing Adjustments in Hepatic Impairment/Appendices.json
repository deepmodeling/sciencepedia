Assume that intrinsic hepatic metabolic capacity (intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$) and hepatic blood flow $Q_h$ remain constant over this interval due to the predominance of protein-binding changes rather than perfusion or enzymatic capacity changes.

The ratio of hepatic clearance after the change to before the change ($\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}}$).\n  2. The ratio of the new maintenance dose rate to the old maintenance dose rate ($\\frac{R_2}{R_1}}$).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical pharmacokinetics, specifically the \"well-stirred\" model of hepatic drug clearance. The scenario, involving a change in drug protein binding due to hypoalbuminemia in a patient with liver disease, is a classic and realistic clinical problem. The provided physiological parameters ($Q_h = 90$ L/h, which is $1.5$ L/min) are standard values. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (e.g., constant $CL_{int}$, no extrahepatic clearance) to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formalizable, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental \"well-stirred\" model of hepatic clearance ($CL_h$), which describes the rate of drug removal by the liver. The equation is:\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nwhere $Q_h$ is the hepatic blood flow, $f_u$ is the fraction of drug unbound in plasma, and $CL_{int}$ is the intrinsic clearance (the metabolic capacity of the liver enzymes for the unbound drug).\n\n**1. Dependence of Hepatic Clearance on $f_u$ for a Low-Extraction Drug**\n\nThe problem states the drug is \"low-extraction.\" The hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is defined as the fraction of drug entering the liver that is removed in a single pass:\n$$E_h = \\frac{CL_h}{Q_h} = \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nA \"low-extraction\" condition implies that $E_h \\ll 1$. This occurs when the rate of drug presentation to the metabolic enzymes, which is limited by blood flow, is much greater than the rate of metabolism. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition:\n$$Q_h \\gg f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$$\nWhen this inequality holds, the denominator in the $CL_h$ equation can be approximated as $Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\approx Q_h$. Substituting this approximation into the equation for $CL_h$ gives:\n$$CL_h \\approx \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h} = f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$$\nThis equation establishes the direct proportionality between hepatic clearance ($CL_h$) and the unbound fraction ($f_u$) for a low-extraction drug, a characteristic also known as restrictive clearance. The clearance is \"restricted\" by the degree of protein binding.\n\n**2. Verification of the Low-Extraction Condition**\n\nWe must verify that the condition $f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$ holds for both the initial and final states.\nThe given values are $Q_h = 90$ L/h and $CL_{int} = 10$ L/h.\n\n- **Initial State (before):** $f_{u,1} = 0.01$.\nThe unbound intrinsic clearance is $f_{u,1} \\cdot CL_{int} = 0.01 \\cdot 10 \\text{ L/h} = 0.1$ L/h.\nComparing this to hepatic blood flow: $0.1 \\text{ L/h} \\ll 90 \\text{ L/h}$. The condition is met.\nThe initial extraction ratio is $E_{h,1} = \\frac{0.1}{90 + 0.1} = \\frac{0.1}{90.1} \\approx 0.0011$, which is much less than $1$.\n\n- **Final State (after):** $f_{u,2} = 0.05$.\nThe unbound intrinsic clearance is $f_{u,2} \\cdot CL_{int} = 0.05 \\cdot 10 \\text{ L/h} = 0.5$ L/h.\nComparing this to hepatic blood flow: $0.5 \\text{ L/h} \\ll 90 \\text{ L/h}$. The condition is still met.\nThe final extraction ratio is $E_{h,2} = \\frac{0.5}{90 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{90.5} \\approx 0.0055$, which is also much less than $1$.\n\nThe low-extraction condition is validated for both states, justifying the use of the simplified clearance equation $CL_h = f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Hepatic Clearance Ratio**\n\nLet $CL_{h,1}$ and $CL_{h,2}$ be the hepatic clearance before and after the change in protein binding, respectively. We need to compute the ratio $\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}}$.\nUsing the justified approximation for low-extraction drugs:\n$$CL_{h,1} = f_{u,1} \\cdot CL_{int}$$\n$$CL_{h,2} = f_{u,2} \\cdot CL_{int}$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}} = \\frac{f_{u,2} \\cdot CL_{int}}{f_{u,1} \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nSince $CL_{int}$ is constant, it cancels out:\n$$\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}} = \\frac{f_{u,2}}{f_{u,1}}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $f_u$:\n$$\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.01} = 5$$\nThe hepatic clearance increases by a factor of $5$.\n\n**4. Computation of the Maintenance Dose Rate Ratio**\n\nAt steady state, the maintenance dose rate ($R$) is equal to the rate of elimination. The problem specifies no extrahepatic clearance, so total clearance ($CL_{tot}$) is equal to hepatic clearance ($CL_h$).\n$$R = CL_{tot} \\cdot C_{ss,tot} = CL_h \\cdot C_{ss,tot}$$\nwhere $C_{ss,tot}$ is the total steady-state drug concentration in plasma.\n\nThe clinical target is a fixed unbound steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,u}$. The relationship between total and unbound concentration is given by:\n$$C_{ss,u} = C_{ss,tot} \\cdot f_u \\implies C_{ss,tot} = \\frac{C_{ss,u}}{f_u}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{ss,tot}$ into the dose rate equation gives:\n$$R = CL_h \\cdot \\frac{C_{ss,u}}{f_u}$$\nWe can now write the expressions for the initial dose rate ($R_1$) and the final dose rate ($R_2$):\n$$R_1 = \\frac{CL_{h,1} \\cdot C_{ss,u}}{f_{u,1}}$$\n$$R_2 = \\frac{CL_{h,2} \\cdot C_{ss,u}}{f_{u,2}}$$\nThe ratio of the new dose rate to the old dose rate is:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{CL_{h,2} \\cdot C_{ss,u}}{f_{u,2}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{CL_{h,1} \\cdot C_{ss,u}}{f_{u,1}}\\right)}$$\nSince $C_{ss,u}$ is constant, it cancels out:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}} \\cdot \\frac{f_{u,1}}{f_{u,2}}$$\nFrom Part 3, we established that for this low-extraction drug, $\\frac{CL_{h,2}}{CL_{h,1}} = \\frac{f_{u,2}}{f_{u,1}}$. Substituting this result into the dose rate ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\left(\\frac{f_{u,2}}{f_{u,1}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{f_{u,1}}{f_{u,2}}\\right) = 1$$\nThis result demonstrates that for a low-extraction drug with no change in intrinsic clearance, the maintenance dose rate required to achieve a target unbound concentration does not change, even if protein binding changes significantly. The five-fold increase in clearance is exactly counteracted by the five-fold decrease in the total concentration needed to produce the same unbound concentration.\n\nThe two required results are the hepatic clearance ratio and the maintenance dose-rate ratio.\nHepatic clearance ratio = $5$.\nMaintenance dose-rate ratio = $1$.\nThese are presented as a two-element row matrix as requested.",

The scenario describes a common clinical problem: adjusting drug dosage in a patient with progressing liver disease. The provided pharmacokinetic parameters and their changes are physiologically plausible for a hepatically metabolized drug. The progression from Child-Pugh class A to B is consistent with a decrease in hepatic clearance ($CL_h$) and an increase in oral bioavailability ($F$) due to reduced first-pass metabolism. The assumptions provided ($CL \\approx CL_h$, constant $f_u$) are standard simplifications used to make such problems tractable. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided to calculate the requested adjustment factor. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from fundamental principles.\n\nThe therapeutic goal is to maintain the same average free drug concentration at steady state ($C_{ss,\\mathrm{free}}$) after the patient's liver function has declined.

Therefore, $f_{u,new} = f_{u,old}$. This allows us to simplify the objective to maintaining the same average *total* steady-state concentration:\n$$\nC_{ss,\\mathrm{total},new} = C_{ss,\\mathrm{total},old}\n$$\n\nThe fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics at steady state is that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. For a continuously administered oral drug (or the average over a dosing interval $\\tau$ with dose $D$, where $DoseRate = D/\\tau$), the rate of systemic drug availability is the product of the dosing rate ($DoseRate$) and the oral bioavailability ($F$).
