This exercise provides direct practice with the four-parameter logistic model, the workhorse of quantitative pharmacology.

            "problem": "A single-site agonist acts on a receptor-effector system that produces a monotonic, saturable graded response. Assume the following first-principles model of graded dose-response behavior in a simple system without pronounced receptor reserve: receptor binding follows the law of mass action with fractional occupancy increasing with concentration, and the transduction from occupancy to effect is monotonic and saturating. The baseline response in the absence of drug is $E_{0}$, and the maximum observed response at very high concentrations is $E_{\\max}$. The half-maximal effective concentration ($\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) is the concentration at which the incremental response above baseline reaches one-half of its maximum possible increment. The Hill coefficient $n$ describes the steepness of the graded concentration-response relationship due to cooperativity or other system-level features.\n\nUsing these foundations, derive the graded dose-response as a function of concentration $C$ for this system, and then evaluate the response at three concentrations. Specifically, for parameters $E_{0}=5$ (arbitrary response units, a.u.), $E_{\\max}=45$ (a.u.), $n=1$, and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}=2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, compute the response $E(C)$ at $C=0.5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $C=2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, and $C=10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$. Round each numerical value of $E(C)$ to $4$ significant figures and express it in a.u. Finally, interpret in words, for each concentration, the relative contributions of the baseline term and the drug-mediated incremental effect to the total observed response, grounded in the principles stated above. Report the three numerical $E(C)$ values in the order $C=0.5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $C=2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $C=10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.",
            "solution": "The graded dose-response relationship, $E(C)$, as a function of agonist concentration $C$, can be modeled as the sum of a baseline response, $E_0$, and a concentration-dependent incremental effect. The incremental effect is a fraction of the maximum possible incremental response, which is the difference between the maximal system response, $E_{\\max}$, and the baseline response, $E_0$.\n\nLet the total response be $E(C)$.\n$$E(C) = E_0 + \\text{Incremental Effect}$$\n\nThe incremental effect is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation, which relates concentration to the fractional attainment of the maximal effect. The maximal incremental effect is $(E_{\\max} - E_0)$. The fractional response, which we can denote as $f(C)$, is given by:\n$$f(C) = \\frac{C^n}{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nHere, $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is the half-maximal effective concentration.\n\nTherefore, the incremental effect is $(E_{\\max} - E_0) \\times f(C)$. Substituting this into the expression for the total response gives the four-parameter logistic model for dose-response:\n$$E(C) = E_0 + (E_{\\max} - E_0) \\frac{C^n}{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}^n + C^n}$$\n\nWe can verify this equation against the problem's definitions:\n1.  For $C=0$, the fractional term is $0$, so $E(0) = E_0$.\n2.  As $C \\to \\infty$, the fractional term approaches $1$, so $E(\\infty) = E_0 + (E_{\\max} - E_0)(1) = E_{\\max}$.\n3.  For $C = \\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, the fractional term is $\\frac{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}^n}{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}^n + \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The incremental response is $E(\\mathrm{EC}_{50}) - E_0 = (E_{\\max} - E_0) \\frac{1}{2}$, which is one-half of the maximum possible increment, consistent with the definition of $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n$E_0 = 5$ a.u.\n$E_{\\max} = 45$ a.u.\n$n = 1$\n$\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = 2 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe maximum incremental response is $E_{\\max} - E_0 = 45 - 5 = 40$ a.u.\nSubstituting the parameters into the derived equation yields the specific dose-response curve for this system:\n$$E(C) = 5 + (45 - 5) \\frac{C^1}{2^1 + C^1} = 5 + 40 \\frac{C}{2 + C}$$\nwhere $C$ is in units of $\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nWe will now evaluate the response $E(C)$ at the three specified concentrations.

This is composed of the constant baseline effect of $5$ a.u. and a drug-mediated incremental effect of $8$ a.u. The drug has induced a response that is $8/40 = 20\\%$ of its maximal capacity.\n\n2.  At $C = 2 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$:\n    $$E(2) = 5 + 40 \\frac{2}{2 + 2} = 5 + 40 \\frac{2}{4} = 5 + 40(0.5) = 5 + 20 = 25$$\n    The response is $25.00$ a.u.\n    Interpretation: At a concentration equal to the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, the total observed response is $25.00$ a.u. This is composed of the baseline effect of $5$ a.u. and a drug-mediated incremental effect of $20$ a.u.

This is composed of the baseline effect of $5$ a.u. and a drug-mediated incremental effect of $33.33$ a.u. The response curve is now flattening as it approaches the maximum of $45$ a.u. The drug-induced effect has achieved $33.33 / 40 \\approx 83.3\\%$ of its maximum, demonstrating the diminishing returns of increasing concentration at the upper end of the dose-response curve.\n\nThe three numerical values of $E(C)$ at concentrations $C=0.5 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $C=2 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$, and $C=10 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$ are, respectively, $13.00$, $25.00$, and $38.33$.",

You have a total of $N=72$ participants, and you must choose a finite set of dose levels on a base-$10$ logarithmic scale and allocate participants equally across the selected dose levels. You will analyze the data using nonlinear least squares under the stated error model. Designs are compared on the basis of asymptotic efficiency for the joint estimation of $EC_{50}$ and $n$, in particular by maximizing the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (so-called $D$-optimality), which is directly related to minimizing the joint Cramér–Rao lower bound for unbiased estimators.\n\nWhich of the following design strategies is most appropriate to minimize the asymptotic variance of the estimators of $EC_{50}$ and $n$ given the prior ranges?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The goal is to find an experimental design—a set of dose levels $D_i$ and the number of subjects at each level—that is most efficient for jointly estimating the parameters $\\theta = (EC_{50}, n)^T$. The specified criterion is $D$-optimality, which seeks to maximize the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), $\\det(\\mathbf{M}(\\theta))$. This is equivalent to minimizing the volume of the joint confidence ellipsoid for the parameters.\n\nThe mean response function is $f(D, \\theta) = \\frac{D^{n}}{EC_{50}^{\\,n} + D^{n}}$. Under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian errors, the FIM depends on the partial derivatives of this function with respect to the parameters. The information contributed by any dose point is scaled by $[f(1-f)]^2$. This term is maximized when $f=0.5$, which occurs at $D=EC_{50}$, and approaches $0$ as $f$ approaches $0$ or $1$ (i.e., on the low-dose and high-dose plateaus). This implies that doses should be placed in the region where the response is changing, not on the plateaus.\n\nEstimating $EC_{50}$ is most efficient with doses near the true $EC_{50}$. Estimating the slope parameter $n$ requires information about how quickly the curve changes, which is best captured by placing doses spread out from $EC_{50}$ on a logarithmic scale. A $D$-optimal design must balance these requirements.\n\nSince the true parameters are unknown, we must find a design that is robust over the prior ranges $EC_{50} \\in [1, 10]$ and $n \\in [0.8, 2]$. An efficient and robust design should therefore place doses to cover the region where $EC_{50}$ is likely to lie ($[1,10]$ mg) and extend sufficiently on either side (on a log scale) to capture information about the slope, $n$.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on these principles.\n\n**A. Use $8$ dose levels equally spaced on the base-$10$ logarithmic scale spanning $0.3$ to $30$ milligrams, assigning $9$ participants per level.**\nThis strategy places $8$ dose levels on a log scale across the range $[0.3, 30]$ mg.\n-   **Spacing:** Logarithmic spacing is appropriate for the Hill model.\n-   **Range:** The range $[0.3, 30]$ mg is well-chosen. It encompasses the entire prior range for $EC_{50}$ ($[1, 10]$). It extends roughly one half-decade below the plausible $EC_{50}$ range and one half-decade above it. This provides good coverage of the transition region of the curve where information is highest, while also including points on the shoulders of the curve to effectively constrain the slope parameter $n$.\n-   **Density:** Using $8$ points provides robustness and helps to characterize the shape of the curve.\nThis design is a sensible and robust approach that concentrates sampling effort in the most informative region.\n\n**B. Use $4$ dose levels linearly spaced between $1$ and $10$ milligrams (specifically $1, 4, 7,$ and $10$ milligrams), assigning $18$ participants per level.**\nThis strategy has two major flaws.\n-   **Spacing:** Linear spacing is inefficient for a model whose behavior is logarithmic with respect to dose. It clusters points at the higher end of the range without a corresponding increase in information.\n-   **Range:** The dose range $[1, 10]$ is precisely the prior range for $EC_{50}$. An efficient design for estimating the slope parameter $n$ must include doses outside this range to observe the approach to the lower and upper plateaus. By sampling only within this range, the design will provide very poor information for estimating $n$.\n\n**C. Use $8$ dose levels clustered at the extremes only: $\\{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8\\}$ milligrams and $\\{12, 24, 48, 96\\}$ milligrams, assigning $9$ participants per level.**\nThis design places all samples at very low doses and very high doses, relative to the prior $EC_{50}$ range of $[1, 10]$.\n-   The low dose cluster ($[0.1, 0.8]$) is likely to be on the lower plateau, where the effect is near 0.\n-   The high dose cluster ($[12, 96]$) is likely to be on the upper plateau, where the effect is near 1.\n-   Since the information for both parameters is proportional to $[f(1-f)]^2$, these dose points contribute virtually no information to the FIM. This design would be unable to estimate $EC_{50}$ or $n$ with any reasonable precision.\n\n**D. Use $6$ dose levels equally spaced on the base-$10$ logarithmic scale spanning $0.1$ to $100$ milligrams, assigning $12$ participants per level.**\nThis strategy uses log spacing over the full allowable dose range.\n-   **Range:** The range $[0.1, 100]$ is excessively wide given the prior information. The extreme doses of $0.1$ mg and $100$ mg are almost certain to be on the plateaus, yielding little information.\n-   **Density:** Spreading only $6$ dose levels over a $3$-decade range ($1000$-fold) makes the design very sparse. This means there will be few points in the most critical region around the true $EC_{50}$. Compared to option A, which concentrates $8$ points over a more targeted $2$-decade range, this design is less efficient as it \"wastes\" observations at uninformative extremes and has poor resolution in the most informative region.\n\nComparing the options, strategy A is the most appropriate. It uses the correct (logarithmic) spacing, and its chosen range of $[0.3, 30]$ mg represents an intelligent use of the prior information to focus sampling in the region of maximal information for the joint estimation of $EC_{50}$ and $n$.",
