The concepts of $EC_{50}$, $pEC_{50}$, potency, efficacy, and the rectangular hyperbolic dose-response curve (characteristic of the Hill-Langmuir equation with a Hill coefficient of $1$) are standard and well-established in the field. The premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($pEC_{50}$ values for both drugs), a defined model (rectangular hyperbola), and a clear objective (calculate potency ratio and an equipotent concentration). The information is sufficient for a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., Scientific Unsoundness, Incompleteness, Unrealistic Conditions). The given $pEC_{50}$ values are pharmacologically plausible for potent agents.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a drug-receptor interaction that follows a rectangular hyperbola. This corresponds to the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site. The relationship between the observed effect $E$ and the agonist concentration $[L]$ is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [L]}{EC_{50} + [L]}$$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect, and $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of the agonist that produces $50\\%$ of the maximum effect.\n\n**1. Fold Difference in Potency**\n\nPotency refers to the concentration of a drug required to produce a certain level of effect. It is inversely related to the $EC_{50}$; a lower $EC_{50}$ indicates a higher potency. The fold difference by which drug $A$ is more potent than drug $B$ is the ratio of their potencies. This can be expressed as the inverse ratio of their $EC_{50}$ values:\n$$\\text{Fold difference in potency} = \\frac{\\text{Potency of } A}{\\text{Potency of } B} = \\frac{EC_{50, B}}{EC_{50, A}}$$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the $EC_{50}$ values for each drug from their given $pEC_{50}$ values. The definition provided is $pEC_{50} = -\\log_{10}(EC_{50})$, where $EC_{50}$ is in molar units ($M$). Rearranging this equation gives:\n$$EC_{50} = 10^{-pEC_{50}}$$\n\nFor drug $A$, with $pEC_{50,A} = 8.0$:\n$$EC_{50,A} = 10^{-8.0} \\, M$$\n\nFor drug $B$, with $pEC_{50,B} = 7.0$:\n$$EC_{50,B} = 10^{-7.0} \\, M$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the fold difference in potency:\n$$\\text{Fold difference} = \\frac{EC_{50, B}}{EC_{50, A}} = \\frac{10^{-7.0} \\, M}{10^{-8.0} \\, M} = 10^{(-7.0) - (-8.0)} = 10^{1} = 10$$\nThus, drug $A$ is $10$ times more potent than drug $B$.\n\n**2. Concentration of Drug $B$ for Equipotent Effect**\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration of drug $B$, denoted $[B]$, that produces the same effect as drug $A$ at a concentration of $[A] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. We are given that both drugs are full agonists and have an identical $E_{\\max}$.\nLet $E_A$ be the effect of drug $A$ and $E_B$ be the effect of drug $B$. We need to solve for $[B]$ in the equation $E_A([A]) = E_B([B])$.\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [A]}{EC_{50,A} + [A]} = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [B]}{EC_{50,B} + [B]} $$\nSince $E_{\\max}$ is identical and non-zero, it can be cancelled from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{[A]}{EC_{50,A} + [A]} = \\frac{[B]}{EC_{50,B} + [B]} $$\nTo solve this equation, all concentration terms must be in consistent units. We will use nanomolars ($\\mathrm{nM}$).\nFirst, convert the $EC_{50}$ values from molar ($M$) to nanomolar ($\\mathrm{nM}$), noting that $1\\,M = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$EC_{50,A} = 10^{-8} \\, M = 10^{-8} \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{nM} = 10^1 \\, \\mathrm{nM} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$EC_{50,B} = 10^{-7} \\, M = 10^{-7} \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{nM} = 10^2 \\, \\mathrm{nM} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe concentration of drug $A$ is given as $[A] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nSubstituting these values into the equipotent equation:\n$$ \\frac{5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{10 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + 5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{[B]}{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + [B]} $$\nThe units can be dropped for the algebraic manipulation:\n$$ \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{[B]}{100 + [B]} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{[B]}{100 + [B]} $$\nNow, we solve for $[B]$:\n$$ 1 \\cdot (100 + [B]) = 3 \\cdot [B] $$\n$$ 100 + [B] = 3[B] $$\n$$ 100 = 3[B] - [B] $$\n$$ 100 = 2[B] $$\n$$ [B] = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 $$\nThe concentration of drug $B$ required is $50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the fold difference in potency ($10$) and the required concentration of drug $B$ ($50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$).",

            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Total receptor count: $R_T$.\n-   Tissue response: $E$.\n-   Stimulus: $S$.\n-   Stimulus-response coupling: $S = \\epsilon \\cdot R_A$, where $\\epsilon$ is intrinsic efficacy and $R_A$ is the number of agonist-occupied receptors.\n-   Transduction function: $E = f(S)$, which is monotonically increasing and saturates at a system ceiling $E_{\\text{sys}}$.\n-   Maximal observed agonist response in the intact system: $E_{\\max}$.\n-   An irreversible antagonist makes $60\\%$ of $R_T$ unavailable.

The definitions of intrinsic efficacy ($\\epsilon$), spare receptors (or receptor reserve), and the effect of an irreversible antagonist are standard in the field of pharmacology. The model presented ($S = \\epsilon \\cdot R_A$, $E = f(S)$) is a canonical and scientifically sound framework for analyzing drug action. The language is precise and technical. The problem defines two distinct, idealized systems ($\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$) to probe a fundamental concept, which is a valid pedagogical and theoretical approach. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed, admitting a unique conceptual solution based on the provided definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the number of available receptors, the maximal stimulus that can be generated, and the resulting maximal response.\n\nLet's define the state of the system before the antagonist is administered.\nAt a saturating concentration of the full agonist, all available receptors are occupied. The number of occupied receptors is $R_{A, \\text{initial}}^{\\max} = R_T$.\nThe maximal stimulus generated is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = \\epsilon \\cdot R_T$.\nThe maximal response observed is $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}) = f(\\epsilon \\cdot R_T)$.\n\nAfter the irreversible antagonist is administered, it permanently inactivates $60\\%$ of the receptors.\nThe new total number of available receptors is $R_T' = (1 - 0.6) \\cdot R_T = 0.4 \\cdot R_T$.\nNow, at a saturating agonist concentration, the maximal number of occupied receptors is $R_{A, \\text{final}}^{\\max} = R_T' = 0.4 \\cdot R_T$.\nThe new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = \\epsilon \\cdot R_{A, \\text{final}}^{\\max} = \\epsilon \\cdot (0.4 \\cdot R_T) = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$.\nThe new maximal response is $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}) = f(0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$.\n\nNow we analyze the two systems based on these relationships.\n\n**System $\\mathcal{N}$ (No Spare Receptors)**\nThe definition \"achieving $E_{\\max}$ requires essentially full availability and occupancy\" implies that the initial maximal stimulus, $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$, is just sufficient to produce the maximal response, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. In this scenario, the stimulus-response function $f(S)$ is not saturated at $S = S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. A reduction in the maximal stimulus will therefore directly lead to a reduction in the maximal response.\nThe new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$.\nSince the system is operating in a regime where the response is sensitive to the stimulus level (i.e., not on the plateau of the $f(S)$ curve), the new maximal response $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$ will be significantly lower than $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$. In the simplest interpretation, where stimulus-response coupling is nearly linear in this range, the reduction in response is proportional to the reduction in stimulus. Therefore, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} \\approx 0.4 \\cdot E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response decreases to approximately $40\\%$ of its baseline value.\n\n**System $\\mathcal{S}$ (Spare Receptors)**\nThe definition \"has spare receptors... $E_{\\max}$ can be reached with less than full receptor availability and occupancy\" implies that the initial maximal stimulus, $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$, is greater than the stimulus required to achieve the system's absolute maximal response, $E_{\\text{sys}}$. Let $S_{\\text{sat}}$ be the minimum stimulus that produces $E_{\\text{sys}}$. The condition for spare receptors is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} > S_{\\text{sat}}$. In this case, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}) = E_{\\text{sys}}$, because the stimulus is saturating the response transduction machinery.\n\nAfter the antagonist, the new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The effect on $E_{\\max}$ now depends on whether this reduced stimulus is still sufficient to saturate the system.\n-   **Case 1: Large Receptor Reserve.** If the new maximal stimulus is still greater than or equal to the saturating stimulus ($S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} \\ge S_{\\text{sat}}$), then the system can still generate a response of $E_{\\text{sys}}$. So, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}) = E_{\\text{sys}} = E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response is unchanged. This occurs if the initial receptor population was large enough to overcome the $60\\%$ loss. The number of receptors required to produce $S_{\\text{sat}}$ is $R_{A, \\text{sat}} = S_{\\text{sat}} / \\epsilon$. The number of \"spare\" receptors is $R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}}$. If the number of receptors lost ($0.6 \\cdot R_T$) is less than or equal to the number of spare receptors, $E_{\\max}$ is preserved. This condition is $0.6 \\cdot R_T \\le R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}}$, which rearranges to $R_{A, \\text{sat}} \\le 0.4 \\cdot R_T$. This is equivalent to saying the receptor reserve, $(R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}})/R_T$, is at least $60\\%$.\n-   **Case 2: Small Receptor Reserve.** If the new maximal stimulus is now less than the saturating stimulus ($S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}  S_{\\text{sat}}$), the system can no longer generate $E_{\\text{sys}}$. The new maximal response will be $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}})  E_{\\text{sys}} = E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response decreases. This happens if the receptor reserve was less than $60\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged provided the receptor reserve is at least $60\\%$ of $R_T$, but decreases if the reserve is smaller.**\n-   The analysis for System $\\mathcal{N}$ is consistent with our derivation that a reduction of available receptors to $40\\%$ in a non-reserve system leads to a proportional, or near-proportional, reduction in $E_{\\max}$.\n-   The analysis for System $\\mathcal{S}$ perfectly matches our derivation, correctly identifying the two possible outcomes based on the magnitude of the receptor reserve relative to the fraction of receptors inactivated.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $60\\%$ of baseline; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ increases due to sensitization when spare receptors are present.**\n-   The decrease in $E_{\\max}$ for System $\\mathcal{N}$ would be related to the remaining fraction of receptors ($40\\%$), not the inactivated fraction ($60\\%$). So the value is wrong.\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ increases in System $\\mathcal{S}$ is pharmacologically incorrect. Irreversible antagonism reduces the available signaling units; it does not cause sensitization or an increase in maximal response.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline because spare receptors are more affected by irreversible antagonists.**\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged in System $\\mathcal{N}$ violates the definition of a system with no spare receptors.\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ *always* decreases to $40\\%$ in System $\\mathcal{S}$ is false, as a sufficient reserve will prevent any decrease. The reasoning, \"because spare receptors are more affected,\" is nonsensical; the antagonist acts on the whole receptor population.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In both Systems $\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline because irreversible antagonism always proportionally lowers $E_{\\max}$ regardless of receptor reserve.**\n-   This statement incorrectly generalizes the effect seen in a non-reserve system to all systems. It explicitly denies the role of receptor reserve, which is the key concept that differentiates the behavior of the two systems. The presence of a receptor reserve can, and often does, make the system resilient to some degree of receptor loss, preventing a decrease in $E_{\\max}$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Thus:\n$$ E(t) = E_{\\text{ss}} + A e^{-k_{out} t} $$\nWe find the constant $A$ by applying the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$ E(0) = E_{\\text{ss}} + A e^{0} \\implies A = E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}} $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the trajectory of the effect:\n$$ E(t) = E_{\\text{ss}} + (E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}) e^{-k_{out} t} $$\nThis can be rearranged to express the deviation from the new steady state:\n$$ E(t) - E_{\\text{ss}} = (E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}) e^{-k_{out} t} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest time $t \\ge 0$ at which the effect has reached $90\\%$ of the way from $E(0)$ to $E_{\\text{ss}}$. This means the remaining distance to the new steady state, $|E(t) - E_{\\text{ss}}|$, is $10\\%$ of the initial distance, $|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}|$. Mathematically, we seek the smallest $t \\ge 0$ such that:\n$$ \\left|E(t) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right| \\le 0.1 \\cdot \\left|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right| $$\nSubstituting our solution for $E(t) - E_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ \\left| (E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}) e^{-k_{out} t} \\right| \\le 0.1 \\cdot \\left|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right| $$\nSince $e^{-k_{out} t}$ is always positive for real $t$ and $k_{out}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\left|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right| e^{-k_{out} t} \\le 0.1 \\cdot \\left|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right| $$\n\nWe must consider two cases:\nCase 1: $E(0) \\ne E_{\\text{ss}}$.\nThis inequality holds if $\\left|E(0) - E_{\\text{ss}}\\right|$ is non-zero. We can divide by this positive term:\n$$ e^{-k_{out} t} \\le 0.1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (a monotonically increasing function):\n$$ -k_{out} t \\le \\ln(0.1) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and reversing the inequality sign (assuming $k_{out} > 0$, which is physically required for a stable steady state):\n$$ k_{out} t \\ge -\\ln(0.1) = \\ln(10) $$\n$$ t \\ge \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k_{out}} $$\nThe smallest time $t$ that satisfies this is $t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k_{out}}$. Note that $E(0) \\ne E_{\\text{ss}}$ implies $k_{in}/k_{out} \\ne (k_{in} + E_{\\max}/2)/k_{out}$, which simplifies to $E_{\\max} \\ne 0$.\n\nCase 2: $E(0) = E_{\\text{ss}}$.\nThis occurs if $E_{\\max} = 0$. In this scenario, the initial state is identical to the new steady state. The inequality becomes:\n$$ 0 \\cdot e^{-k_{out} t} \\le 0.1 \\cdot 0 \\implies 0 \\le 0 $$\nThis is true for all $t \\ge 0$. The problem asks for the smallest $t \\ge 0$, which is $t=0$.\n\nThe calculation for each test case is as follows, using $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30258509$:\n\n- Test case 1: $k_{out} = 0.5$, $E_{\\max} = 8 \\ne 0$.\n  $t_1 = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{0.5} \\approx 4.605170186$ hours.\n\n- Test case 2: $k_{out} = 0.01$, $E_{\\max} = 5 \\ne 0$.\n  $t_2 = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{0.01} \\approx 230.258509299$ hours.\n\n- Test case 3: $k_{out} = 5$, $E_{\\max} = 20 \\ne 0$.\n  $t_3 = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{5} \\approx 0.460517019$ hours.\n\n- Test case 4: $k_{out} = 1$, $E_{\\max} = 0$.\n  Since $E_{\\max} = 0$, $E(0) = E_{\\text{ss}}$, so the time is $t_4 = 0$ hours.\n\n- Test case 5: $k_{out} = 0.25$, $E_{\\max} = 40 \\ne 0$.\n  $t_5 = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{0.25} \\approx 9.210340372$ hours.\n\nRounding each result to $6$ decimal places gives the final values for the output.",
