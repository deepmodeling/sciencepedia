It is a standard, scientifically sound, and well-posed problem in quantitative pharmacology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of the concentration profile $C(t)$. We begin with the mass balance equation, which is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}=-k\\,A(t)\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $A$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A(t)} dA(t) = -k\\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a generic time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} dA' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k\\,dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|A'|]_{A(0)}^{A(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince the amount of drug $A(t)$ is a non-negative quantity, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A(0)) = -k(t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the amount of drug $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)} = \\exp(-kt) \\implies A(t) = A(0)\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $A(0)=D$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nA(t) = D\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of concentration, $C(t)=\\frac{A(t)}{V}$, to find the concentration profile:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{D\\exp(-kt)}{V}\n$$\nThis can also be written in terms of the initial concentration $C(0)$. At $t=0$, $C(0) = \\frac{A(0)}{V} = \\frac{D}{V}$. Therefore:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0)\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNow, we compute the value of $C(3\\,\\mathrm{h})$ using the given parameters: $D=100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $V=20\\,\\mathrm{L}$, and $k=0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate the initial concentration $C(0)$:\n$$\nC(0) = \\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $C(t)$ at $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = (5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times \\exp(-0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{h})\n$$\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 5 \\times \\exp(-0.6)\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 5 \\times 0.548811636 \\dots \\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\approx 2.744058 \\dots \\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, we get $C(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 2.744\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem concerns the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, $t_{1/2}$ is the time at which the concentration is half of its initial value:\n$$\nC(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(0)\\exp(-k t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C(0)\n$$\nAssuming $C(0)>0$, we can divide by $C(0)$:\n$$\n\\exp(-k t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k t_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for a first-order elimination process, the half-life is constant and independent of the dose or initial concentration.\nUsing the given value $k=0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.2}\\,\\mathrm{h} \\approx 3.4657\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nWe are asked to compare $3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ with one half-life.\nSince $3\\,\\mathrm{h} < 3.4657\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the time $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is less than one half-life.\n\nFor the interpretation, at exactly one half-life, the fraction of the drug remaining is by definition $\\frac{1}{2}$, or $0.5$. At $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the fraction remaining is:\n$$\n\\frac{C(3\\,\\mathrm{h})}{C(0)} = \\exp(-k \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = \\exp(-0.2 \\times 3) = \\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.5488\n$$\nSince $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is less than one half-life ($t_{1/2}$), it is expected that more than half of the initial concentration remains. The calculation confirms this, as the fraction remaining at $3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ ($0.5488$) is greater than the fraction remaining at one half-life ($0.5$).",

All variables and constants are standard in the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe plasma concentration $C(t)$ after a single oral dose in a one-compartment model is described by the equation:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{F \\cdot D \\cdot k_a}{V \\cdot (k_a - k)} (e^{-kt} - e^{-k_a t}) $$\nwhere $D$ is the dose. This can be written in a bi-exponential form:\n$$ C(t) = A e^{-kt} - A e^{-k_a t} $$\nwhere the intercept coefficient $A$ is given by $A = \\frac{F \\cdot D \\cdot k_a}{V \\cdot (k_a - k)}$.\n\nThe method of residuals is predicated on the condition $k_a > k$, which implies that the term $A e^{-k_a t}$ decays to zero much faster than the term $A e^{-kt}$. At late time points, the concentration is therefore dominated by the elimination process:\n$$ C_{term}(t) \\approx A e^{-kt} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of this expression gives a linear relationship:\n$$ \\ln(C_{term}(t)) \\approx \\ln(A) - kt $$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\ln(C)$, $x = t$, the slope is $m = -k$, and the y-intercept is $b = \\ln(A)$.\n\n**Part 1: Estimation of the Elimination Rate Constant, $k$**\n\nWe will fit the terminal data points to a straight line on a semilogarithmic plot (i.e., fit $\\ln(C)$ vs. $t$). By inspection of the data, the concentration peaks around $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$ and then declines. The terminal linear phase can be assumed to begin at or after $t=5.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$. We will use the last four data points for this fit:\n- $t_1 = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_1 = 3.61\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_1) = 1.2837$\n- $t_2 = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_2 = 2.02\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_2) = 0.7031$\n- $t_3 = 12.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_3 = 0.91\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_3) = -0.0943$\n- $t_4 = 16.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_4 = 0.41\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_4) = -0.8916$\n\nUsing linear regression for $y_i = \\ln(C_i)$ versus $x_i = t_i$:\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\sum t_i = 5.0 + 8.0 + 12.0 + 16.0 = 41.0$\n- $\\sum \\ln(C_i) = 1.2837 + 0.7031 - 0.0943 - 0.8916 = 1.0009$\n- $\\sum t_i^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 + 12^2 + 16^2 = 25 + 64 + 144 + 256 = 489$\n- $\\sum t_i \\ln(C_i) = (5.0)(1.2837) + (8.0)(0.7031) + (12.0)(-0.0943) + (16.0)(-0.8916) = 6.4185 + 5.6248 - 1.1316 - 14.2656 = -3.3539$\n\nThe slope, $m = -k$, is calculated as:\n$$ m = \\frac{n \\sum(t_i \\ln(C_i)) - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum \\ln(C_i))}{n \\sum t_i^2 - (\\sum t_i)^2} = \\frac{4(-3.3539) - (41.0)(1.0009)}{4(489) - (41.0)^2} = \\frac{-13.4156 - 41.0369}{1956 - 1681} = \\frac{-54.4525}{275} \\approx -0.1980 $$\nThus, $k = -m \\approx 0.198\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This value is very close to $0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe intercept, $b = \\ln(A)$, is:\n$$ b = \\frac{\\sum \\ln(C_i)}{n} - m \\frac{\\sum t_i}{n} = \\frac{1.0009}{4} - (-0.1980) \\frac{41.0}{4} = 0.2502 + 2.0295 = 2.2797 $$\nSo, $\\ln(A) \\approx 2.28$ and $A = e^{2.28} \\approx 9.78$. The equation for the extrapolated terminal line is $C_{extrap}(t) \\approx 9.78 e^{-0.198 t}$. For subsequent calculations, we will use the approximate values $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $A=9.78$.\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Absorption Rate Constant, $k_a$**\n\nThe residual concentration, $C_{res}(t)$, is the difference between the extrapolated concentration from the elimination phase and the measured concentration at early times.\n$$ C_{res}(t) = C_{extrap}(t) - C(t) = (A e^{-kt}) - (A e^{-kt} - A e^{-k_a t}) = A e^{-k_a t} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives another linear relationship:\n$$ \\ln(C_{res}(t)) = \\ln(A) - k_a t $$\nThe slope of this line is $-k_a$, and the intercept is $\\ln(A)$, which should be the same as the intercept from the terminal phase line. We calculate the residuals for the early time points not used in the first fit.\nThe extrapolated line is $C_{extrap}(t) = 9.78 e^{-0.20 t}$.\n- At $t = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(0.5) = 9.78 e^{-0.1} \\approx 8.85\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(0.5) = 8.85 - 2.98 = 5.87\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 1.7699$.\n- At $t = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(1.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.2} \\approx 8.01\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(1.0) = 8.01 - 4.51 = 3.50\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 1.2528$.\n- At $t = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(2.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.4} \\approx 6.56\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(2.0) = 6.56 - 5.35 = 1.21\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 0.1906$.\n- At $t = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(3.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.6} \\approx 5.37\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(3.0) = 5.37 - 4.99 = 0.38\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = -0.9676$.\n\nNow, we perform a linear regression on $\\ln(C_{res})$ vs. $t$ for these four points:\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\sum t_i = 0.5 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 6.5$\n- $\\sum \\ln(C_{res, i}) = 1.7699 + 1.2528 + 0.1906 - 0.9676 = 2.2457$\n- $\\sum t_i^2 = 0.5^2 + 1.0^2 + 2.0^2 + 3.0^2 = 0.25 + 1.0 + 4.0 + 9.0 = 14.25$\n- $\\sum t_i \\ln(C_{res, i}) = (0.5)(1.7699) + (1.0)(1.2528) + (2.0)(0.1906) + (3.0)(-0.9676) = 0.8850 + 1.2528 + 0.3812 - 2.9028 = -0.3838$\n\nThe slope, $m' = -k_a$, is:\n$$ m' = \\frac{n \\sum(t_i \\ln(C_{res, i})) - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum \\ln(C_{res, i}))}{n \\sum t_i^2 - (\\sum t_i)^2} = \\frac{4(-0.3838) - (6.5)(2.2457)}{4(14.25) - (6.5)^2} = \\frac{-1.5352 - 14.5971}{57 - 42.25} = \\frac{-16.1323}{14.75} \\approx -1.0937 $$\nThus, $k_a = -m' \\approx 1.094\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This value is very close to $1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nOur analysis yields the pair $(k, k_a) \\approx (0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}, 1.09\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1})$.\n\nA final check can be performed by calculating the theoretical time to maximum concentration, $t_{max}$, given by $t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(k_a/k)}{k_a - k}$. Using the pair $(0.20, 1.00)$:\n$$ t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(1.00/0.20)}{1.00 - 0.20} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{0.80} = \\frac{1.6094}{0.80} \\approx 2.01\\ \\mathrm{h} $$\nThe data shows the maximum measured concentration at $t = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$, which is an excellent agreement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nOur detailed calculation using the method of residuals yielded $k \\approx 0.198\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $k_a \\approx 1.094\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The values in this option are the closest to our derived estimates. Furthermore, the calculated $t_{max}$ of $2.01\\ \\mathrm{h}$ using these parameters perfectly matches the observed peak in the data at $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The condition $k_a > k$ is satisfied. This option is a very strong match.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $k = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThe value of $k = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is significantly different from our calculated value of $\\approx 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. A value of $k=0.30$ would imply a terminal half-life of $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/0.30 \\approx 2.3\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The data shows the concentration falls from $2.02\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ at $t=8\\ \\mathrm{h}$ to $0.91\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ at $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$, taking $4$ hours to decrease by half, which is inconsistent with a $2.3\\ \\mathrm{h}$ half-life.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $k = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThis option violates the explicit condition $k_a > k$ stated in the problem ($0.20 \\ngtr 1.00$). The method of residuals as described is invalid if this condition is not met, as the terminal phase would be absorption-rate limited (\"flip-flop\" kinetics), and the slope would correspond to $k_a$, not $k$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThe value of $k$ is consistent, but the value of $k_a=0.50\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is not consistent with our residual analysis, which gave $k_a \\approx 1.1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. We can check this by calculating the theoretical $t_{max}$:\n$$ t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(0.50/0.20)}{0.50 - 0.20} = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{0.30} = \\frac{0.9163}{0.30} \\approx 3.05\\ \\mathrm{h} $$\nThis predicted peak time of $\\approx 3.05\\ \\mathrm{h}$ is inconsistent with the data, where the concentration is already declining at $t=3.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$ after peaking at $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the initial rate of drug elimination from a single compartment immediately following an IV bolus dose. The elimination process is described as saturable, following enzyme kinetics, which is formally modeled by the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the compartment at time $t$, and $C(t)$ be the concentration. The relationship between amount, concentration, and the apparent volume of distribution, $V$, is:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V}$$\nThe rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is equal to the negative of the elimination rate, $R_e$.\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = -R_e$$\nThe elimination rate for a saturable pathway is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$R_e = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum elimination rate and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, which is the concentration at which the elimination rate is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem requires the initial elimination rate, which is the rate at $t=0$, denoted as $R_e(0)$. To find this, we first need the initial concentration, $C(0)$. An intravenous bolus dose $D$ is administered at $t=0$ and is assumed to distribute instantaneously. Therefore, the initial amount of drug in the body is $A(0) = D$. The resulting initial concentration is:\n$$C(0) = \\frac{A(0)}{V} = \\frac{D}{V}$$\nUsing the given values, $D = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $V = 20\\,\\mathrm{L}$:\n$$C(0) = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nNow, we can calculate the initial elimination rate, $R_e(0)$, by substituting $C(0)$ into the Michaelis-Menten equation along with the given values for $V_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$ and $K_m = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$:\n$$R_e(0) = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C(0)}{K_m + C(0)} = \\frac{(50\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}) \\cdot (5\\,\\mathrm{mg/L})}{(2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{mg/L})}$$\n$$R_e(0) = \\frac{250}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer, we compute the value of the fraction:\n$$R_e(0) \\approx 35.7142857\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$R_e(0) = 35.71\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to assess whether the elimination is operating in the saturated regime at $t=0$. The kinetic regime is determined by comparing the drug concentration $C$ to the Michaelis constant $K_m$.\n- If $C \\ll K_m$, the denominator $K_m + C \\approx K_m$, and the rate $R_e \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}C$. This is first-order kinetics (linear, non-saturated regime), where the rate is proportional to the concentration.\n- If $C \\gg K_m$, the denominator $K_m + C \\approx C$, and the rate $R_e \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}C}{C} = V_{\\max}$. This is zero-order kinetics (non-linear, saturated regime), where the rate is constant and at its maximum.\n\nIn this case, at $t=0$, the initial concentration is $C(0) = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ and the Michaelis constant is $K_m = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nWe observe that $C(0) > K_m$. Specifically, $C(0) = 2.5 \\cdot K_m$. Since the concentration is substantially higher than the Michaelis constant, the enzymatic elimination system is significantly occupied. The elimination rate is closer to its maximum, $V_{\\max}$, than it is to being proportional to the concentration. This condition signifies that the elimination process is operating in the saturated (or more precisely, partially saturated) regime.\n\nWe can quantify this by comparing the calculated initial rate, $R_e(0) = 35.71\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$, to the maximal rate, $V_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$. The initial rate is $\\frac{35.71}{50} \\approx 0.714$, or $71.4\\%$ of the maximum possible rate. A rate that is over $70\\%$ of the maximum clearly indicates that the system is operating in the non-linear, saturable portion of its kinetic profile.",
