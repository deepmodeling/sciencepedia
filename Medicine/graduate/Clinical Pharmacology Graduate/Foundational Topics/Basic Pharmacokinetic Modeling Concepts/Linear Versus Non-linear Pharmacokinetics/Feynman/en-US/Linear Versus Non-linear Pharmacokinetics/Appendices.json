            "problem": "A single subject receives two separate single-dose intravenous (IV) bolus administrations of a small-molecule drug under conditions where the pharmacokinetics are linear (that is, no capacity-limited absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion; and structural parameters are dose-independent). Let the first dose be $D_1 = 180$ mg and the second dose be $D_2 = 600$ mg, administered on different days with no change in physiology or concomitant medications. Assume instantaneous delivery to the central compartment and that elimination follows time-invariant first-order processes characterized by a constant clearance and a constant volume of distribution.\n\nDefine the fold-change in a metric between the two doses as the ratio of the metric after the second dose divided by that after the first dose. Using only fundamental mass-balance relationships and core pharmacokinetic definitions, compute the predicted fold-change in the maximum concentration ($C_{max}$; maximum plasma concentration) and in the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC; area under the concentration–time curve from zero to infinity) when linear pharmacokinetics holds.\n\nExpress your final answer as exact fractions without rounding, and report fold-changes as unitless multiples.",
            "solution": "The core principle of linear pharmacokinetics is that exposure parameters, such as the maximum plasma concentration ($C_{max}$) and the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$), are directly proportional to the administered dose ($D$). We can demonstrate this using fundamental definitions and mass-balance relationships. The problem defines \"fold-change\" as the ratio of a metric after the second dose ($D_2$) to the same metric after the first dose ($D_1$).\n\nFirst, let us analyze the maximum concentration, $C_{max}$. For a single-dose IV bolus administration, the entire dose is assumed to be delivered instantaneously into the central compartment volume, $V$. The maximum concentration is achieved at time $t=0$, immediately after administration. By a simple mass-balance definition, the initial concentration $C(0)$ is the amount of drug (the dose, $D$) divided by the volume it distributes into ($V$).\n$$C_{max} = C(0) = \\frac{D}{V}$$\nThe problem states that the pharmacokinetics are linear and that structural parameters are dose-independent. This means the volume of distribution, $V$, is a constant for the subject and does not change between the two administrations.\n\nFor the first dose, $D_1 = 180$ mg, the maximum concentration is:\n$$C_{max,1} = \\frac{D_1}{V}$$\nFor the second dose, $D_2 = 600$ mg, the maximum concentration is:\n$$C_{max,2} = \\frac{D_2}{V}$$\nThe fold-change in $C_{max}$ is the ratio of $C_{max,2}$ to $C_{max,1}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(C_{max}) = \\frac{C_{max,2}}{C_{max,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{D_2}{V}}{\\frac{D_1}{V}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nSubstituting the given dose values:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(C_{max}) = \\frac{600 \\text{ mg}}{180 \\text{ mg}} = \\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\n\nNext, let us analyze the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, $AUC_{0-\\infty}$ (hereafter denoted as $AUC$). A fundamental mass-balance principle states that for a single dose, the total amount of drug eliminated from the body must equal the dose administered, $D$. The rate of drug elimination from the body is related to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, through the parameter of clearance, $CL$.\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nThe total amount of drug eliminated over all time is the integral of this rate from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe problem specifies that elimination follows time-invariant first-order processes, which is a hallmark of linear pharmacokinetics. This implies that clearance, $CL$, is a constant and does not depend on the dose or concentration. Therefore, $CL$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$, is the definition of $AUC$. Thus:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot AUC$$\nEquating the total amount eliminated with the dose administered gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$D = CL \\cdot AUC$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $AUC$ in terms of dose and clearance:\n$$AUC = \\frac{D}{CL}$$\nFor the first dose, $D_1 = 180$ mg, the $AUC$ is:\n$$AUC_1 = \\frac{D_1}{CL}$$\nFor the second dose, $D_2 = 600$ mg, the $AUC$ is:\n$$AUC_2 = \\frac{D_2}{CL}$$\nThe fold-change in $AUC$ is the ratio of $AUC_2$ to $AUC_1$. Since $CL$ is constant:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(AUC) = \\frac{AUC_2}{AUC_1} = \\frac{\\frac{D_2}{CL}}{\\frac{D_1}{CL}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nThis is the same ratio as for $C_{max}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(AUC) = \\frac{600 \\text{ mg}}{180 \\text{ mg}} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\nTherefore, under conditions of linear pharmacokinetics, both $C_{max}$ and $AUC$ scale directly and proportionally with the dose. The fold-change in both metrics is equal to the fold-change in the dose. We present the fold-changes for $C_{max}$ and $AUC$, respectively, as a row matrix.",

            "problem": "Consider a single well-stirred compartment with constant volume of distribution $V$ and a drug eliminated exclusively by a saturable pathway that obeys Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Let $C(t)$ denote the plasma concentration of the drug at time $t$, $V_{\\max}$ denote the maximum elimination rate in mass per unit time, and $K_m$ denote the Michaelis constant in mass per unit volume.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and analysis of the apparent half-life for a drug eliminated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics in a single-compartment model.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the amount of drug in the compartment, $A(t)$, is the mass balance equation. For an intravenous bolus after time $t=0$, the input rate is zero, and the output is the rate of elimination. Let $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration and $V$ be the constant volume of distribution. The amount of drug is $A(t) = V C(t)$. The elimination pathway follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, so the rate of elimination is given by $\\frac{V_{\\max} C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}$.\n\nThe mass balance equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d A(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nSubstituting $A(t) = V C(t)$ and recognizing that $V$ is a constant, we obtain the differential equation for the concentration $C(t)$:\n$$ V \\frac{d C(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} \\implies \\frac{d C(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} \\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation.

It is a linear function of $C_0$ with a positive slope, meaning the half-life increases as the initial concentration increases. This contrasts with linear, first-order kinetics, where the half-life is constant. The reason for this dependence is the saturation of the elimination pathway. At higher concentrations, the system is less efficient at clearing a given fraction of the drug, thus prolonging the half-life.\n\nTo illustrate with $C_0 = a K_m$:\n$$ t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}}(a K_m) = \\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{a}{2} + \\ln(2) \\right) $$\n- For $a \\ll 1$ ($C_0 \\ll K_m$): The kinetics are pseudo-first-order. $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx \\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}}\\ln(2)$, which is nearly constant.\n- For $a \\gg 1$ ($C_0 \\gg K_m$): The kinetics are pseudo-zero-order. $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx \\frac{V (a K_m)}{2 V_{\\max}} = \\frac{V C_0}{2 V_{\\max}}$, which is directly proportional to $C_0$.\n- For $a \\approx 1$ ($C_0 \\approx K_m$): The kinetics are mixed-order, and the half-life shows a clear dependence on concentration.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}=\\frac{t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}}(C_0=K_m)}{t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}}(C_0=K_m/10)}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator with $C_0 = K_m$:\n$$ t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}}(K_m) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{2} + K_m \\ln(2) \\right) = \\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\ln(2) \\right) $$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator with $C_0 = K_m/10$:\n$$ t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{app}}(K_m/10) = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{K_m}{10}\\right) + K_m \\ln(2) \\right) = \\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{20} + \\ln(2) \\right) $$\nThe ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\ln(2) \\right)}{\\frac{V K_m}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{20} + \\ln(2) \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\ln(2)}{\\frac{1}{20} + \\ln(2)} $$\nTo write this as a single fraction:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{1+2\\ln(2)}{2}}{\\frac{1+20\\ln(2)}{20}} = \\frac{1+2\\ln(2)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{20}{1+20\\ln(2)} = \\frac{10(1+2\\ln(2))}{1+20\\ln(2)} $$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the ratio.",
