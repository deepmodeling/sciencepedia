For weak acids and bases, the pH of the tubular fluid determines the balance between the ionized and unionized forms, which in turn governs passive reabsorption across lipid membranes. This exercise  delves into this principle by asking you to calculate the unionized fraction of ibuprofen at a specific urinary pH, providing a quantitative basis for the concept of ion trapping.",

            "problem": "A monoprotic weak acid present as $HA$ (unionized) and its conjugate base $A^{-}$ (ionized) is subject to renal handling in the distal nephron by passive transcellular diffusion that is dominated by the unionized species. Consider ibuprofen, a monoprotic weak acid with $pK_{a} = 4.9$, in urine at $pH = 6.5$. Assume rapid acid-base equilibrium within the tubular lumen, negligible binding of drug to luminal macromolecules, and that only $HA$ is sufficiently lipophilic to traverse the tubular epithelium by passive diffusion. You may take the acid dissociation constant to be $K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$, together with the definitions $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$ and $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$.\n\nUsing only these base definitions, derive an expression for the fraction of ibuprofen that is unionized in the urine, defined as $f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$, evaluate it at $pH = 6.5$ and $pK_{a} = 4.9$, and then briefly interpret whether passive tubular reabsorption is likely at this urine $pH$ under the stated assumptions.\n\nExpress the final numerical value of $f_{\\text{unionized}}$ as a decimal fraction with no units, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. The premises are scientifically sound, and the provided information is complete and consistent, allowing for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fraction of a monoprotic weak acid that exists in its unionized form, $f_{\\text{unionized}}$, and evaluate it under specific conditions. The weak acid is denoted by $HA$ (unionized) and its conjugate base by $A^{-}$ (ionized).\n\nThe fraction of the unionized species is defined as:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$$\nwhere $[HA]$ is the concentration of the unionized acid and $[A^{-}]$ is the concentration of the ionized conjugate base. The total concentration of the drug in the lumen is $[HA] + [A^{-}]$.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is given by the expression:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$$\nwhere $[H^{+}]$ is the proton concentration. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the ionized species, $[A^{-}]$:\n$$[A^{-}] = \\frac{K_a [HA]}{[H^{+}]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[A^{-}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_{\\text{unionized}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + \\frac{K_a [HA]}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nWe can factor out the term $[HA]$ from the denominator:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] \\left(1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^{+}]}\\right)}$$\nThe term $[HA]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding an expression for $f_{\\text{unionized}}$ that depends only on the ratio of $K_a$ to $[H^{+}]$:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nThe problem provides the definitions for $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}]) \\implies [H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$$\n$$pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a) \\implies K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$$\nWe can substitute these into the ratio $\\frac{K_a}{[H^{+}]}$:\n$$\\frac{K_a}{[H^{+}]} = \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-pH}} = 10^{-pK_a - (-pH)} = 10^{pH - pK_a}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $f_{\\text{unionized}}$ gives the final derived expression in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\nThis equation is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, arranged to calculate the fraction of the protonated (unionized) species of a weak acid.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for ibuprofen using the given values: urine $pH = 6.5$ and ibuprofen's $pK_a = 4.9$.\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{6.5 - 4.9}}$$\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n$$6.5 - 4.9 = 1.6$$\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{1.6}}$$\nCalculating the value of $10^{1.6}$:\n$$10^{1.6} \\approx 39.810717$$\nThen, we calculate the fraction:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 39.810717} = \\frac{1}{40.810717} \\approx 0.0245034$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} \\approx 0.02450$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The value $f_{\\text{unionized}} \\approx 0.02450$ means that at a urine $pH$ of $6.5$, only about $2.45\\%$ of the total ibuprofen in the tubular fluid is in its unionized, lipophilic form ($HA$). The vast majority, approximately $97.55\\%$, exists as the ionized conjugate base ($A^{-}$). According to the problem's assumption, passive transcellular reabsorption is dominated by the unionized species. Since this fraction is very small, passive reabsorption of ibuprofen from the renal tubule is likely to be minimal. The drug is effectively \"trapped\" in its ionized, less lipophilic form within the alkaline urine, a phenomenon known as ion trapping, which promotes its renal excretion. Therefore, passive tubular reabsorption is not likely to be significant under these conditions.",

The model of renal clearance as a sum of parallel processes (filtration, secretion, reabsorption) is a cornerstone of pharmacokinetics.

It is free of any of the invalidity flaws listed in the instructions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe total renal clearance, $CL_r$, is the sum of the clearances from all parallel renal excretion pathways. Based on the problem statement, these pathways are glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, with passive reabsorption being negligible.\n\nTherefore, the total renal clearance can be expressed as:\n$$\nCL_r = CL_{\\text{filtration}} + CL_{\\text{secretion}}\n$$\n\nThe clearance due to glomerular filtration, $CL_{\\text{filtration}}$, is the product of the fraction of drug unbound in plasma, $f_u$, and the Glomerular Filtration Rate, $\\mathrm{GFR}$.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental principle of steady-state pharmacokinetics for a drug administered via a constant-rate maintenance regimen is that the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination. The rate of elimination is the product of the total systemic clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$).\n\nLet $R_{dosing}$ be the maintenance dosing rate (e.g., mass per unit time). At steady state:\n$$R_{dosing} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}$$\nThe average steady-state drug exposure is proportional to $C_{ss,avg}$. To maintain the same exposure in the patient with renal impairment as in a healthy individual, we must ensure that $C_{ss,avg, \\text{patient}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{normal}}$.\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{R_{dosing}}{CL}$$\nTherefore, the condition for equivalent exposure is:\n$$\\frac{R_{dosing, \\text{patient}}}{CL_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{R_{dosing, \\text{normal}}}{CL_{\\text{normal}}}$$\nThe maintenance dose adjustment factor ($DAF$) is defined as the ratio of the required dosing rate for the patient to the standard dosing rate for a healthy individual.\n$$DAF = \\frac{R_{dosing, \\text{patient}}}{R_{dosing, \\text{normal}}}$$\nFrom the previous equation, we derive the expression for $DAF$:\n$$DAF = \\frac{CL_{\\text{patient}}}{CL_{\\text{normal}}}$$\nTo calculate the $DAF$, we must first determine the total clearance in the patient, $CL_{\\text{patient}}$. Total systemic clearance is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_R$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{NR}$).\n$$CL = CL_R + CL_{NR}$$\nFirst, we determine these components for the healthy reference population.\nGiven $CL_{\\text{normal}} = 200 \\text{ mL/min}$ and the fraction excreted unchanged $f_e = 0.7$. By definition, $f_e = \\frac{CL_R}{CL}$.\nThe renal clearance in the normal population is:\n$$CL_{R, \\text{normal}} = f_e \\times CL_{\\text{normal}} = 0.7 \\times 200 \\text{ mL/min} = 140 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nThe nonrenal clearance in the normal population is:\n$$CL_{NR, \\text{normal}} = CL_{\\text{normal}} - CL_{R, \\text{normal}} = 200 \\text{ mL/min} - 140 \\text{ mL/min} = 60 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nNext, we calculate the clearance components for the CKD patient. Based on the problem's assumptions:\n1.  Nonrenal clearance is unaffected:\n    $$CL_{NR, \\text{patient}} = CL_{NR, \\text{normal}} = 60 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n2.  Renal clearance scales linearly with eGFR:\n    $$\\frac{CL_{R, \\text{patient}}}{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{CL_{R, \\text{normal}}}{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{normal}}}$$\n    This allows us to calculate the patient's renal clearance:\n    $$CL_{R, \\text{patient}} = CL_{R, \\text{normal}} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{normal}}}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies evaluating this at the midpoint of the patient's eGFR range of $[20 \\text{ mL/min}, 30 \\text{ mL/min}]$.\n$$\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{patient}} = \\frac{20 \\text{ mL/min} + 30 \\text{ mL/min}}{2} = 25 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$CL_{R, \\text{patient}} = 140 \\text{ mL/min} \\times \\left(\\frac{25 \\text{ mL/min}}{100 \\text{ mL/min}}\\right) = 140 \\text{ mL/min} \\times 0.25 = 35 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nThe total systemic clearance for the patient is the sum of the patient's renal and nonrenal clearance:\n$$CL_{\\text{patient}} = CL_{R, \\text{patient}} + CL_{NR, \\text{patient}} = 35 \\text{ mL/min} + 60 \\text{ mL/min} = 95 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nFinally, we can calculate the dose adjustment factor:\n$$DAF = \\frac{CL_{\\text{patient}}}{CL_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{95 \\text{ mL/min}}{200 \\text{ mL/min}} = 0.475$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$DAF = 0.4750$$\nThis factor represents the fraction of the standard maintenance dose (or dosing rate) that should be administered to the patient to achieve the same systemic exposure as a subject with normal renal function.",
