A key component of a Phase I dose-escalation study is the design of patient cohorts to ensure that if a dose is unacceptably toxic, there is a high probability of observing a safety signal (a Dose-Limiting Toxicity, or DLT). This first exercise lays the statistical foundation for this principle, asking you to derive and apply a fundamental probability model to determine the minimum cohort size needed to confidently detect toxicity .",

            "problem": "A Phase I, first-in-human, oncology dose-escalation trial uses fixed-size cohorts treated at a candidate dose level. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined per protocol as a binary event observed within the first cycle. Suppose that for a given dose, each patient has an independent and identically distributed probability $p$ of experiencing a DLT during the DLT evaluation window, and that DLTs across patients are independent Bernoulli events. The clinical pharmacology team wishes to plan a cohort size that makes it highly likely to observe at least one DLT when the true per-patient DLT probability at that dose is at or above an unacceptable toxicity level.\n\nStarting from the axioms of probability and the definition of independence for Bernoulli trials, derive an expression in terms of $p$ and $n$ for the probability that at least one DLT is observed in a cohort of size $n$. Then, using that expression, determine the minimum integer cohort size $n^{\\ast}$ required to ensure that this probability is at least $q$ when the true per-patient DLT probability is $p$. Finally, evaluate $n^{\\ast}$ for $p = 0.25$ and $q = 0.90$.\n\nExpress your final answer as the single integer $n^{\\ast}$. No units are required, and no rounding to significant figures is needed because $n^{\\ast}$ is an exact integer by definition.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the probability of observing at least one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in a cohort, the minimum cohort size required to meet a certain probability threshold, and the numerical evaluation of this size for specific parameters.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the probability of observing at least one DLT in a cohort of size $n$. Let the random variable $X_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ represent the outcome for the $i$-th patient, where $X_i=1$ if the patient experiences a DLT and $X_i=0$ otherwise. The problem states that these are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a probability of success (experiencing a DLT) equal to $p$. Thus, for each patient $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$$\n\nLet $A$ be the event that at least one DLT is observed in the cohort of $n$ patients. It is computationally simpler to first calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is the event that *no* DLTs are observed in the cohort. According to the axioms of probability, the probability of event $A$ is given by $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$.\n\nThe event $A^c$ occurs if and only if all $n$ patients do not experience a DLT. This can be expressed as the intersection of events $X_i=0$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$A^c = \\{X_1=0 \\text{ and } X_2=0 \\text{ and } \\ldots \\text{ and } X_n=0\\}$$\nThe problem specifies that the DLTs across patients are independent events. The definition of independence for a set of events implies that the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(X_1=0) \\times P(X_2=0) \\times \\cdots \\times P(X_n=0)$$\nSince the trials are identically distributed, $P(X_i=0) = 1-p$ for all $i$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(A^c) = (1-p)^n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P(A)$, we obtain the expression for the probability that at least one DLT is observed in a cohort of size $n$:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\n\nNext, we determine the minimum integer cohort size, which we denote as $n^{\\ast}$, required to ensure that this probability is at least $q$. The condition to satisfy is:\n$$1 - (1-p)^n \\ge q$$\nWe must solve this inequality for $n$. We can rearrange the terms as follows:\n$$(1-p)^n \\le 1 - q$$\nFor a non-trivial problem, we assume $p \\in (0, 1)$ and $q \\in (0, 1)$. This ensures that both $1-p$ and $1-q$ are positive numbers between $0$ and $1$. Since the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is a strictly increasing function for $x>0$, applying it to both sides of the inequality preserves the inequality's direction:\n$$\\ln\\left((1-p)^n\\right) \\le \\ln(1 - q)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we have:\n$$n \\ln(1-p) \\le \\ln(1 - q)$$\nTo isolate $n$, we need to divide by $\\ln(1-p)$. Since we assumed $p \\in (0, 1)$, it follows that $1-p \\in (0, 1)$. The natural logarithm of a number in the interval $(0, 1)$ is negative. Therefore, $\\ln(1-p) < 0$. When dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1 - q)}{\\ln(1-p)}$$\nSince the cohort size $n$ must be an integer, we are looking for the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. This is given by the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side. The minimum integer cohort size $n^{\\ast}$ is therefore:\n$$n^{\\ast} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(1 - q)}{\\ln(1-p)} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $n^{\\ast}$ for the given values of $p = 0.25$ and $q = 0.90$. We substitute these values into the derived expression for $n^{\\ast}$:\n$$n^{\\ast} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(1 - 0.90)}{\\ln(1 - 0.25)} \\right\\rceil$$\n$$n^{\\ast} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(0.10)}{\\ln(0.75)} \\right\\rceil$$\nNow we compute the numerical values of the logarithms:\n$$\\ln(0.10) \\approx -2.302585$$\n$$\\ln(0.75) \\approx -0.287682$$\nCalculating the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(0.10)}{\\ln(0.75)} \\approx \\frac{-2.302585}{-0.287682} \\approx 8.00416$$\nThus, the condition on $n$ is $n \\ge 8.00416$.\nThe minimum integer $n^{\\ast}$ satisfying this inequality is the next integer greater than or equal to $8.00416$, which is $9$.\n$$n^{\\ast} = \\lceil 8.00416 \\rceil = 9$$\nTo verify, for $n=8$ with $p=0.25$, the probability of observing at least one DLT is $1-(0.75)^8 \\approx 1-0.1001 = 0.8999$, which is less than $0.90$. For $n=9$, the probability is $1-(0.75)^9 \\approx 1-0.0751 = 0.9249$, which is greater than $0.90$. Thus, the minimum integer cohort size is indeed $9$.",

Cohorts of size $3$ are treated sequentially starting at dose level $1$ and escalating one level at a time, unless dose reductions or cohort expansions are mandated by observed DLTs.

We estimate the parameter $\\alpha$ by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data. The log-likelihood function for the binomial outcomes is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\alpha) = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{3} \\left( y_\\ell \\ln(p_\\ell(\\alpha)) + (n_\\ell - y_\\ell) \\ln(1 - p_\\ell(\\alpha)) \\right) + C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.

We assume $C = C_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.\n\n- For $D = 25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $C = 25\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$:\n$$E(25) = \\frac{90 \\cdot (25)^{2}}{2500 + (25)^{2}} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 625}{2500 + 625} = \\frac{56250}{3125} = 18\\,\\%$$\n\n- For $D = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $C = 50\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$:\n$$E(50) = \\frac{90 \\cdot (50)^{2}}{2500 + (50)^{2}} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 2500}{2500 + 2500} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\\,\\%$$\nThis is, by definition, half of $E_{\\max}$.\n\n- For $D = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $C = 100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$:\n$$E(100) = \\frac{90 \\cdot (100)^{2}}{2500 + (100)^{2}} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 10000}{2500 + 10000} = \\frac{900000}{12500} = 72\\,\\%$$\n\n- For $D = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $C = 200\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$:\n$$E(200) = \\frac{90 \\cdot (200)^{2}}{2500 + (200)^{2}} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 40000}{2500 + 40000} = \\frac{3600000}{42500} \\approx 84.7\\,\\%$$\nThis is approximately $85\\,\\%$.\n\nThe final step is to select the RP2D by balancing the PD effect (benefit) against the safety data (risk).\n- At $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, the PD effect is $72\\,\\%$, which is $72/90 = 80\\,\\%$ of the theoretical maximum effect. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate is acceptable at $\\leq 10\\,\\%$.\n- At $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, doubling the dose from $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ only increases the PD effect from $72\\,\\%$ to $\\approx 85\\,\\%$. This is a small incremental benefit, indicating the response is nearing saturation. However, this dose doubling causes a significant increase in the DLT rate to $\\approx 25\\,\\%$, which is often considered the threshold for the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and may not be desirable for chronic administration in Phase II.\nGiven the diminishing returns in PD effect and the substantial increase in toxicity, the dose of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ offers a much better balance of benefit and risk than $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. Doses lower than $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ provide substantially less PD effect. Thus, $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is the most scientifically justified RP2D.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The effect model is $E(C) = E_{0} + \\dfrac{E_{\\max}\\, C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}$, where $EC_{50}$ is the concentration producing half of $E_{\\max}$ and $\\gamma$ controls sigmoidicity; with $E_{0} = 0\\,\\%$, $E_{\\max} = 90\\,\\%$, $EC_{50} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, $\\gamma = 2$, and $C_{\\mathrm{avg}} \\approx \\text{dose}$, predicted effects are approximately $18\\,\\%$, $45\\,\\%$, $72\\,\\%$, and $85\\,\\%$ at $25$, $50$, $100$, and $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, respectively. Because PD is near-saturated by $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ (about $0.8\\,E_{\\max}$) and safety worsens at $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is a biologically and clinically appropriate RP2D for Phase II.**\n- The model equation and parameter definitions are correct.\n- The calculated effects ($18\\,\\%$, $45\\,\\%$, $72\\,\\%$, $85\\,\\%$) match my derivation precisely.\n- The justification for selecting $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ as the RP2D is based on achieving a substantial PD effect ($80\\,\\%$ of $E_{\\max}$) while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, avoiding the diminishing returns and increased toxicity seen at $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This reasoning is entirely correct and follows modern principles of model-informed drug development.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The effect model is $E(C) = E_{0} + \\dfrac{E_{\\max}\\, EC_{50}^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}$, where $EC_{50}$ is the concentration at which maximal effect occurs and larger $\\gamma$ indicates larger $E_{\\max}$. Because $50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ corresponds to $EC_{50}$, the maximal effect is reached by $50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, so $50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is the RP2D.**\n- The model equation is incorrect. The term $C^{\\gamma}$ is missing from the numerator, resulting in an inverse relationship.\n- The interpretations of the parameters are incorrect. $EC_{50}$ is the concentration for *half-maximal* effect, not maximal effect. The Hill coefficient $\\gamma$ relates to the steepness of the curve, not the value of $E_{\\max}$.\n- The conclusion is based on these flawed premises.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The effect model is $E(C) = E_{0} + \\dfrac{E_{\\max}\\, C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}$, but Phase I trials should select the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) regardless of PD saturation to maximize efficacy signals in Phase II. Since $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ gives the highest observed PD effect and the highest dose, it should be chosen as the RP2D.**\n- The model equation is correct.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The principle of selecting the MTD regardless of PD saturation is an outdated paradigm, especially for targeted therapies with measurable biomarker responses. The modern approach is to find an optimal biological dose that balances efficacy and safety. Choosing $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ ignores the clear evidence of diminishing returns on the PD biomarker and the significant increase in toxicity, representing a poor risk-benefit trade-off.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The effect model is linear, $E(C) = E_{0} + S\\, C$ with slope $S$, because within the tested range effect increases with concentration. Therefore, higher doses always produce proportionally greater benefit; to maximize effect, $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ should be chosen as the RP2D for Phase II despite higher DLT rates.**\n- This option proposes a linear model, which directly contradicts the problem statement that the relationship is \"saturable, sigmoidal\".\n- The reasoning based on a linear model (that higher doses produce proportionally greater benefit) is invalid for the specified saturable system. This justification completely ignores the fundamental nature of the PD response described in the problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, only option A correctly presents the pharmacological model, performs the necessary calculations, and applies sound scientific reasoning to justify the selection of the RP2D.",
