            "problem": "A new orally administered monoprotic weak base is entering Investigational New Drug-enabling studies aimed at predicting absorption-limited exposure from fundamental properties and the gastrointestinal (GI) pH environment. The compound has acid dissociation constant $pK_{a} = 6.8$, partition coefficient $\\log P = 3.0$, and intrinsic solubility (defined as the solubility of the neutral species) $S_{0} = 0.001$ mg/mL. An immediate-release $100$ mg dose is administered with $250$ mL water. Assume the following gastrointestinal transit and environment: the stomach is at pH $1.5$ with volume $250$ mL, and gastric emptying delivers the entire dissolved content to the small intestine, which is well mixed at pH $6.5$ with volume $500$ mL. Assume the small intestinal absorption window is $2.0$ hours. \n\nFor passive permeability across the intestinal epithelium, model the effective permeability-surface area product of the unionized species using the empirical relation $PS_{u} = \\kappa \\times 10^{\\log P}$ with $\\kappa = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ cm$^{3}$/s. Assume the ionized species has negligible permeability relative to the unionized species, so that the effective permeability-surface area product is $PS_{\\text{eff}} = f_{u} \\times PS_{u}$, where $f_{u}$ is the fraction of drug in the unionized (neutral) form at the local pH. Treat the stomach as a dissolution compartment only (no gastric absorption). Assume rapid acid-base equilibrium and rapid solid–liquid equilibrium such that upon transfer from stomach to intestine, any supersaturation at the intestinal pH instantaneously relaxes to the equilibrium solubility at that pH (precipitation removes excess). Assume dissolution from precipitated solid is fast enough to maintain the luminal dissolved concentration at the equilibrium solubility in the small intestine over the absorption window as long as solid remains. \n\nStarting from acid-base equilibria for a monoprotic weak base and mass transfer by passive diffusion, and using the GI pH profile above:\n- Compute the unionized fraction $f_{u}$ in the stomach and small intestine.\n- Compute the pH-dependent solubility in the stomach and small intestine using the intrinsic solubility and acid-base equilibria.\n- Determine the initial intestinal concentration after mixing gastric contents into the intestinal volume, and compute the supersaturation ratio relative to the intestinal equilibrium solubility to assess precipitation risk.\n- Under the stated assumptions, compute the total mass absorbed from the small intestine over the $2.0$ hour window and thereby the predicted fraction of the dose absorbed (a unitless decimal). \n\nExpress the final answer as the predicted fraction of dose absorbed as a decimal.

The time units (hours for the window, seconds for the rate constant) are reconcilable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step calculation of the fraction of a drug dose absorbed from the small intestine. This involves analyzing the drug's state in the stomach, its transition to the intestine, and its subsequent absorption.\n\n**1. Unionized Fraction ($f_u$)**\n\nThe drug is a monoprotic weak base. Its protonation equilibrium is $B + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons BH^+$, where $B$ is the unionized base and $BH^+$ is the ionized conjugate acid. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the conjugate acid is:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} \\right)$$\nThe fraction of the drug in the unionized form, $f_u$, is given by:\n$$f_u = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [BH^+]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]}}$$\nFrom the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, $\\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]} = 10^{(pK_a - pH)}$. Thus,\n$$f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}}$$\n- In the stomach ($pH_{stomach} = 1.5$ with $pK_a = 6.8$):\n$$f_{u, stomach} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(6.8 - 1.5)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.3}}$$\nThis is a very small fraction, indicating the drug is almost entirely ionized in the stomach.\n\n- In the small intestine ($pH_{intestine} = 6.5$ with $pK_a = 6.8$):\n$$f_{u, intestine} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(6.8 - 6.5)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.3}}$$\n\n**2. pH-Dependent Solubility ($S_{pH}$)**\n\nThe total solubility, $S_{pH}$, is the sum of the dissolved unionized species ($S_0$) and the dissolved ionized species in a saturated solution.\n$$S_{pH} = [B]_{sat} + [BH^+]_{sat} = S_0 + S_0 \\times 10^{(pK_a - pH)} = S_0 (1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)})$$\n- In the stomach ($pH_{stomach} = 1.5$):\n$$S_{stomach} = S_0 (1 + 10^{(6.8 - 1.5)}) = (0.001 \\text{ mg/mL}) \\times (1 + 10^{5.3})$$\n$$S_{stomach} \\approx (0.001) \\times (1 + 199526) \\approx 199.5 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nThe maximum mass that can be dissolved in the stomach volume ($V_{stomach} = 250$ mL) is:\n$$M_{dissolved, stomach} = S_{stomach} \\times V_{stomach} \\approx 199.5 \\text{ mg/mL} \\times 250 \\text{ mL} = 49875 \\text{ mg}$$\nSince $M_{dissolved, stomach} \\gg M_{dose} = 100$ mg, the entire dose dissolves in the stomach.\n\n- In the small intestine ($pH_{intestine} = 6.5$):\n$$S_{intestine} = S_0 (1 + 10^{(6.8 - 6.5)}) = (0.001 \\text{ mg/mL}) \\times (1 + 10^{0.3})$$\nUsing $10^{0.3} \\approx 1.99526$:\n$$S_{intestine} \\approx 0.001 \\times (1 + 1.99526) = 0.00299526 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\n\n**3. Intestinal Concentration and Supersaturation**\n\nThe entire dissolved dose ($100$ mg) is emptied into the intestinal volume ($V_{intestine} = 500$ mL). The initial concentration, if no precipitation occurred, would be:\n$$C_{initial, intestine} = \\frac{M_{dose}}{V_{intestine}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{500 \\text{ mL}} = 0.2 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nThe supersaturation ratio (SR) is the ratio of this initial concentration to the equilibrium solubility in the intestine:\n$$SR = \\frac{C_{initial, intestine}}{S_{intestine}} = \\frac{0.2 \\text{ mg/mL}}{0.001 \\times (1 + 10^{0.3}) \\text{ mg/mL}} = \\frac{200}{1 + 10^{0.3}} \\approx \\frac{200}{2.99526} \\approx 66.8$$\nSince $SR > 1$, the solution is supersaturated. The problem states that precipitation occurs instantaneously, reducing the luminal concentration to the equilibrium solubility. Therefore, the concentration of dissolved drug in the intestine is maintained at:\n$$C_{lumen} = S_{intestine} = S_0 (1 + 10^{0.3})$$\nThis concentration is maintained as long as precipitated solid drug is present to redissolve and replace the absorbed drug.\n\n**4. Absorption Rate and Total Mass Absorbed**\n\nThe rate of absorption is given by the product of the effective permeability-surface area product and the luminal concentration of the drug. The problem specifies that only the unionized form is permeable.\n$$\\frac{dM_{absorbed}}{dt} = PS_{\\text{eff}} \\times C_{lumen}$$\nwhere $PS_{\\text{eff}} = f_{u, intestine} \\times PS_u$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $PS_{\\text{eff}}$, $f_{u, intestine}$, and $C_{lumen}$:\n$$\\frac{dM_{absorbed}}{dt} = (f_{u, intestine} \\times PS_u) \\times S_{intestine}$$\n$$\\frac{dM_{absorbed}}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH_{intestine})}} \\times PS_u \\right) \\times \\left( S_0 (1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH_{intestine})}) \\right)$$\nThe term $(1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH_{intestine})})$ cancels out, yielding a constant absorption rate:\n$$\\frac{dM_{absorbed}}{dt} = PS_u \\times S_0$$\nThis is a key simplification for solubility-limited absorption. We now calculate the numerical values.\nFirst, calculate $PS_u$:\n$$PS_u = \\kappa \\times 10^{\\log P} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ cm}^3/\\text{s}) \\times 10^{3.0}$$\n$$PS_u = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ cm}^3/\\text{s}) \\times 1000 = 1.0 \\text{ cm}^3/\\text{s}$$\nSince $1$ cm$^3 = 1$ mL, $PS_u = 1.0$ mL/s.\nNow, calculate the absorption rate:\n$$\\text{Rate} = PS_u \\times S_0 = (1.0 \\text{ mL/s}) \\times (0.001 \\text{ mg/mL}) = 0.001 \\text{ mg/s}$$\nThis rate is constant as long as solid drug is available. The amount of precipitated drug is $M_{precipitated} = (C_{initial, intestine} - S_{intestine}) \\times V_{intestine} = (0.2 - 0.002995) \\times 500 \\approx 98.5$ mg, which is substantial.\n\nThe total mass absorbed over the $T = 2.0$ hour window is the integral of this rate over time.\nThe time window in seconds is $T = 2.0 \\text{ h} \\times 3600 \\text{ s/h} = 7200$ s.\n$$M_{absorbed} = \\text{Rate} \\times T = (0.001 \\text{ mg/s}) \\times (7200 \\text{ s}) = 7.2 \\text{ mg}$$\nSince $7.2$ mg is much less than the precipitated mass, the assumption of a constant rate is valid for the entire window.\n\n**5. Fraction of Dose Absorbed ($F_a$)**\n\nThe fraction of the dose absorbed is the ratio of the mass absorbed to the total dose administered:\n$$F_a = \\frac{M_{absorbed}}{M_{dose}} = \\frac{7.2 \\text{ mg}}{100 \\text{ mg}} = 0.072$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final answer is $0.0720$.",

The formulation has sustained input designed to minimize peak-to-trough fluctuation; the predicted terminal half-life is $t_{1/2} = 18$ h, which is longer than the dosing interval ($t_{1/2} > \\tau$), so the steady-state trough concentration is expected to be close to the steady-state average concentration, with deviation under approximately $10\\%$.

Your final numerical answer should be only the computed dose per dosing interval.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe fundamental principle for determining a maintenance dosing regimen for a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics is the concept of mass balance at steady state. At steady state ($ss$), the rate at which the drug is administered and absorbed into the systemic circulation must equal the rate at which it is eliminated from the body.\n\nThe average rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation (Rate In) for an oral drug with dose $D$, dosing interval $\\tau$, and oral bioavailability $F$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} $$\nThe average rate of drug elimination from the body (Rate Out) is the product of the systemic clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nAt steady state, we equate these two rates:\n$$ \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nThe problem asks to calculate the dose $D$ required to achieve a target steady-state trough concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$) of $1.1$ mg/L. A crucial piece of information is that the drug's predicted terminal half-life ($t_{1/2} = 18$ h) is longer than the dosing interval ($\\tau = 12$ h). For an extended-release formulation under such conditions ($t_{1/2} > \\tau$), the fluctuation between peak and trough concentrations at steady state is minimal. The problem statement formalizes this by providing the approximation that the trough concentration is nearly equal to the average concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss,trough}} \\approx C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nTherefore, we can set our target average steady-state concentration to be the target trough concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = 1.1 \\, \\text{mg/L} $$\nNow, we can solve the steady-state mass balance equation for the dose $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F} $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Systemic clearance, $CL = 7.2$ L/h\n- Dosing interval, $\\tau = 12$ h\n- Target average concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = 1.1$ mg/L\n- Nominal oral bioavailability, $F = 0.42$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the dose:\n$$ D = \\frac{(7.2 \\, \\text{L/h}) \\times (1.1 \\, \\text{mg/L}) \\times (12 \\, \\text{h})}{0.42} $$\nThe units are consistent: $\\frac{(\\text{L/h}) \\times (\\text{mg/L}) \\times \\text{h}}{\\text{dimensionless}} = \\text{mg}$.\n$$ D = \\frac{95.04 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.42} $$\n$$ D = 226.285714... \\, \\text{mg} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the required dose is $226.3$ mg.\n\nRegarding the sensitivity of the required dose to the uncertainty in oral bioavailability ($F$), the dose equation $D = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F}$ shows that $D$ is inversely proportional to $F$. This inverse relationship is a critical consideration in first-in-human (FIH) planning. The plausible range for $F$ is given as $0.30$ to $0.60$. This uncertainty in $F$ translates directly into a wide range of possible doses required to achieve the therapeutic target. For instance:\n- If $F = 0.30$ (worst-case absorption): $D = \\frac{95.04}{0.30} = 316.8$ mg.\n- If $F = 0.60$ (best-case absorption): $D = \\frac{95.04}{0.60} = 158.4$ mg.\nThe dose required to meet the target concentration could be nearly $40\\%$ higher or $30\\%$ lower than the dose calculated with the nominal $F$. This highlights a significant risk: if the true $F$ is higher than the nominal value of $0.42$, administering the calculated dose of $226.3$ mg could lead to unexpectedly high and potentially toxic concentrations. Conversely, if the true $F$ is lower, the dose may be sub-therapeutic.\n\nTo quantify the fractional change in the required dose if the true $F$ is $0.30$ instead of the nominal $0.42$, we can calculate the ratio. Let $D_{nominal}$ be the dose for $F_{nominal} = 0.42$ and $D_{new}$ be the dose for $F_{new} = 0.30$.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{D_{new} - D_{nominal}}{D_{nominal}} $$\nSince $D$ is proportional to $1/F$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{\\frac{k}{F_{new}} - \\frac{k}{F_{nominal}}}{\\frac{k}{F_{nominal}}} = \\frac{F_{nominal}}{F_{new}} - 1 $$\nwhere $k = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau$.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{0.42}{0.30} - 1 = 1.4 - 1 = 0.4 $$\nA bioavailability of $0.30$ instead of $0.42$ would require a $40\\%$ increase in the dose to achieve the same target steady-state concentration. This underscores the importance of carefully managing assumptions about bioavailability in early clinical development.",

The calculated optimal dose $d^{\\ast} = 40$ is indeed within this interval. Because the function is concave and the unconstrained maximum is within the interval, it is also the maximum over that interval.\n\nThe question asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The optimal dose is exactly $40$ milligrams, which is written as $40.0$ to show three significant figures of precision.",
