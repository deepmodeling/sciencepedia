An individual has risk-allele dosages $x=(2,1,0,2,1)$ at $5$ independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the corresponding per-allele effect size estimates from an external genome-wide association study (GWAS) are $\\hat{\\beta}=(0.08,-0.05,0.12,0.02,0.09)$. Assume the usual additive model in which each locus contributes independently and additively to the log-risk on the liability scale, the risk-allele dosages are accurate counts per locus, and the $5$ loci have been linkage disequilibrium pruned in the discovery study so that weights can be combined linearly without double-counting correlated signals. Using the conventional definition of a linear polygenic score that aggregates locus-specific contributions via a weighted sum, construct the individual’s unstandardized score $S$ from these inputs. Then, using a reference population score distribution with mean $\\mu=0.15$ and standard deviation $\\sigma=0.10$, compute the individual’s standardized value $z$ relative to that reference.

The additive model, use of effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and standardization are all well-established concepts.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. The vectors $x$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ have consistent dimensions.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n-   The problem does not violate any other criteria for invalidity (e.g., it is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial).\n\nThe solution process can proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Unstandardized Polygenic Score ($S$)\n\nThe problem defines the unstandardized polygenic score, $S$, as a weighted sum of the risk-allele dosages, where the weights are the corresponding per-allele effect sizes. This can be expressed as the dot product of the dosage vector $x$ and the effect size vector $\\hat{\\beta}$.

The value $0.24$ has two significant figures. To express it with four, we add trailing zeros:\n$$S = 0.2400$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Standardized Polygenic Score ($z$)\n\nThe standardized score, or $z$-score, measures how many standard deviations an individual's score is from the mean of a reference population. The formula is:\n$$z = \\frac{S - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nUsing the calculated unstandardized score $S = 0.24$ and the given reference population parameters $\\mu = 0.15$ and $\\sigma = 0.10$:\n$$z = \\frac{0.24 - 0.15}{0.10}$$\n$$z = \\frac{0.09}{0.10}$$\n$$z = 0.9$$\nThe problem requires this value to also be rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.9$ has one significant figure. To express it with four, we add trailing zeros:\n$$z = 0.9000$$\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a row vector containing the rounded values of $S$ and $z$ in that order.\nThe required vector is $(S, z)$, which is $(0.2400, 0.9000)$.

            "problem": "In precision medicine, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) generate individualized absolute risk predictions for common diseases that inform threshold-based preventive treatment decisions. A PRS-derived risk model is deployed in a clinical setting with $N = 2000$ patients, partitioned into five strata based on their current predicted $5$-year absolute risks $p_i$ and stratum sizes $n_i$: stratum 1 has $n_1 = 800$ with $p_1 = 0.05$, stratum 2 has $n_2 = 400$ with $p_2 = 0.08$, stratum 3 has $n_3 = 300$ with $p_3 = 0.12$, stratum 4 has $n_4 = 300$ with $p_4 = 0.18$, and stratum 5 has $n_5 = 200$ with $p_5 = 0.30$. The current clinical decision rule is to offer preventive therapy to patients whose predicted risk is at or above a threshold of $0.10$.\n\nSubsequent evaluation reveals miscalibration characterized by a calibration slope of $0.6$ on the log-odds scale. To correct this, the model is recalibrated on the log-odds scale (\"calibration-in-the-large\" plus slope adjustment) so that after recalibration the mean predicted risk equals the observed event prevalence of $\\pi_{\\text{obs}} = 0.12$. For purposes of this problem, the recalibration should be understood to act on the logit of risk, where the logit function is defined by $\\operatorname{logit}(p) = \\ln\\!\\big(p/(1-p)\\big)$ and its inverse (the logistic function) is $\\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-z)}$.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the provided data, determine how recalibration alters treatment decisions by computing the change in the number of patients whose predicted risk is at or above $0.10$ after recalibration, compared to before recalibration. Provide the final count difference as an integer number of patients. No rounding by significant figures is required. The answer must be a single real-valued number.",
            "solution": "The task is to determine the change in the number of patients receiving preventive therapy due to a model recalibration. This change is the number of patients treated after recalibration minus the number of patients treated before recalibration.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of patients treated *before* recalibration. The clinical decision rule is to offer therapy to patients with a predicted risk $p \\ge 0.10$. The initial predicted risks for the five strata are $p_{1} = 0.05$, $p_{2} = 0.08$, $p_{3} = 0.12$, $p_{4} = 0.18$, and $p_{5} = 0.30$.\n\n- Stratum 1: $p_{1} = 0.05  0.10$.

The recalibration is performed on the log-odds (logit) scale. Let $p_i$ be the initial predicted risk for a patient in stratum $i$, and $p'_i$ be the recalibrated risk. The logit function is $\\operatorname{logit}(p) = \\ln(p/(1-p))$. The initial log-odds for stratum $i$ is $z_i = \\operatorname{logit}(p_i)$.\n\nThe recalibrated log-odds, $z'_i$, are given by a linear transformation of the initial log-odds:\n$$z'_i = a + S \\cdot z_i$$\nwhere $S=0.6$ is the given calibration slope and $a$ is the calibration-in-the-large intercept.

Since $g(a_{c,2}) = 232.51  240$, the true value of $a$ required to satisfy $g(a)=240$ must be greater than $a_{c,2}$.\nSo, we have established that $a  a_{c,2}$.\n\nNow let's check the condition $a \\ge a_{c,1}$.\n$a_{c,1} = -0.43056$.

The other risks will be higher than they were for $a_{c,2}$.\n$z'_1(a_{c1}) = a_{c1}+Sz_1 = -\\ln(9) - Sz_1 + Sz_1 = -\\ln(9)$. So $p'_1=0.1$.\n$z'_2(a_{c1}) = a_{c1} + Sz_2 = -\\ln(9) - S(z_1-z_2) \\approx -2.19722 - 0.6(-2.94444 - (-2.44235)) = -2.19722 - 0.6(-0.50209) \\approx -2.19722+0.30125=-1.89597$.\n$p'_2(a_{c1}) \\approx 1/(1+\\exp(1.89597)) \\approx 0.1305$.\nSimilarly, we can see all other $p'_i(a_{c1})$ will be $0.1$.\nSumming the expected cases:\n$g(a_{c,1})_1 = n_1 p'_1 = 800(0.1)=80$.\n$g(a_{c,1})_2 = n_2 p'_2 = 400(0.1305) = 52.2$.\n$p'_3(a_{c1}) = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-\\ln(9)-S(z_1-z_3)) \\approx \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-2.19722 - 0.6(-0.95201)) \\approx \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-1.62601) \\approx 0.1648$. $n_3 p'_3 \\approx 49.44$.\n$p'_4(a_{c1}) = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-\\ln(9)-S(z_1-z_4)) \\approx \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-1.34103) \\approx 0.2073$. $n_4 p'_4 \\approx 62.19$.\n$p'_5(a_{c1}) = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-\\ln(9)-S(z_1-z_5)) \\approx \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(-0.93906) \\approx 0.2811$. $n_5 p'_5 \\approx 56.22$.\n$g(a_{c,1}) \\approx 80 + 52.2 + 49.44 + 62.19 + 56.22 = 300.05$.\nSince $g(a_{c,1}) = 300.05  240$, the true value of $a$ must be less than $a_{c,1}$.\n\nSo we have established the location of the true intercept $a$: $a_{c,2}  a  a_{c,1}$.\nThis translates to $-0.73181  a  -0.43056$.\n\nNow we determine the treatment status of each stratum after recalibration using the condition $a \\ge a_{c,i}$:\n- Stratum 1: Is $a \\ge a_{c,1}$? No, since $a  a_{c,1}$. Not treated.\n- Stratum 2: Is $a \\ge a_{c,2}$? Yes, since $a  a_{c,2}$. Treated.\n- Strata 3, 4, 5 were treated before, and their critical intercepts $a_{c,i}$ are even more negative than $a_{c,2}$, so they will certainly remain treated. For completeness:\n$a_{c,3} = -\\ln(9) - 0.6 z_3 \\approx -1.00176$. Since $a  -0.73181  -1.00176$, $aa_{c,3}$. Treated.\n$a_{c,4} = -\\ln(9) - 0.6 z_4 \\approx -1.28683$. Since $a  a_{c,4}$. Treated.\n$a_{c,5} = -\\ln(9) - 0.6 z_5 \\approx -1.68884$. Since $a  a_{c,5}$. Treated.\n\nThus, after recalibration, strata 2, 3, 4, and 5 are treated.\nThe number of patients treated after recalibration is:\n$N_{\\text{after}} = n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 = 400 + 300 + 300 + 200 = 1200$.\n\nThe change in the number of patients receiving therapy is:\n$\\Delta N = N_{\\text{after}} - N_{\\text{before}} = 1200 - 800 = 400$.",
