This fundamental practice tackles two common and critical conversions: translating between the 1-based, inclusive coordinates used by NCBI and the 0-based, half-open system of BED files, while also performing an assembly 'liftover' to update positions to a newer genome build . Correctly performing these conversions is a foundational skill for ensuring data integrity across different bioinformatic tools and databases.",

            "problem": "A researcher working in precision medicine needs to harmonize genomic interval data across assemblies and file formats for downstream integration with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), GenBank, the Reference Sequence (RefSeq), and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). Three exon intervals for a clinically relevant gene were retrieved from Reference Sequence (RefSeq) on Genome Reference Consortium Human build 37 (GRCh37) in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) style, where coordinates are $1$-based and inclusive. The intervals on chromosome $7$ are:\n- Region $1$: start $s_{1} = 55321114$, end $e_{1} = 55321333$.\n- Region $2$: start $s_{2} = 55322001$, end $e_{2} = 55322231$.\n- Region $3$: start $s_{3} = 55323900$, end $e_{3} = 55323985$.\n\nA chain alignment–based assembly conversion for this locus indicates that within the locally colinear block containing all three intervals, the mapping to Genome Reference Consortium Human build 38 (GRCh38) is a linear offset on the positive strand: for any position $x$ in GRCh37, the corresponding position in GRCh38 is $x' = x + \\Delta$ with $\\Delta = 413$, and there are no internal gaps within any of the three intervals.\n\nThe data must be converted for use in the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser as Browser Extensible Data (BED), which uses a $0$-based, half-open interval convention. Using only the foundational definitions of coordinate systems (that is, the meaning of $1$-based inclusive versus $0$-based half-open coordinates) and the given linear offset, do the following:\n1. Compute the boundary-corrected GRCh38 BED coordinates $(s'_{i}, e'_{i})$ for each region $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n2. Compute the total pre-conversion length $$L_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(e_{i} - s_{i} + 1\\right).$$\n3. Compute the total post-conversion length in BED convention $$L_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(e'_{i} - s'_{i}\\right).$$\n4. Verify equality by evaluating $L_{\\mathrm{post}} - L_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ and, assuming equality holds, report the common total length.\n\nExpress the final total length in base pairs (bp). No rounding is required; provide the exact integer value. Your final reported quantity must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the conversion of genomic interval coordinates from the GRCh37 assembly to the GRCh38 assembly, and simultaneously from NCBI's $1$-based, inclusive coordinate system to the Browser Extensible Data (BED) format's $0$-based, half-open system. We must then calculate the total length of the intervals before and after conversion and verify that the length is conserved.\n\nFirst, we establish the transformation rules. An interval in a $1$-based, inclusive system is denoted by $[s, e]$, representing the set of bases from position $s$ to position $e$, inclusive. The length of such an interval is calculated as $L = e - s + 1$. An interval in a $0$-based, half-open system is denoted by $[s', e')$, representing the set of bases from position $s'$ up to, but not including, position $e'$. The length of this interval is $L' = e' - s'$.\n\nThe conversion consists of two independent transformations:\n1.  An assembly liftover from GRCh37 to GRCh38, which is given as a linear offset $\\Delta = 413$. A position $x$ in GRCh37 corresponds to a position $x' = x + \\Delta$ in GRCh38.\n2.  A coordinate system change from $1$-based inclusive to $0$-based half-open.\n\nLet's derive the formula for the coordinate system change on a single assembly. For a $1$-based inclusive interval $[S, E]$, the first physical base is at position $S$ and the last is at position $E$. In a $0$-based system, the base at position $k$ has index $k-1$. Thus, the bases in the interval correspond to indices $\\{S-1, S, \\dots, E-1\\}$. A $0$-based half-open interval $[S_0, E_0)$ must start at the index of the first base, so $S_0 = S-1$. It must end one position after the index of the last base, so $E_0 = (E-1) + 1 = E$. The conversion rule is $[S, E] \\rightarrow [S-1, E)$.\n\nCombining these two transformations for an initial interval $[s_i, e_i]$ on GRCh37:\nFirst, apply the liftover offset $\\Delta = 413$. The interval in GRCh38 coordinates, but still $1$-based inclusive, is $[s_i + \\Delta, e_i + \\Delta]$.\nSecond, apply the coordinate system change. Let $S = s_i + \\Delta$ and $E = e_i + \\Delta$. The final $0$-based half-open coordinates $(s'_i, e'_i)$ are given by:\n$$s'_i = S - 1 = s_i + \\Delta - 1$$\n$$e'_i = E = e_i + \\Delta$$\n\nNow we perform the specified tasks.\n\n1. Compute the boundary-corrected GRCh38 BED coordinates $(s'_{i}, e'_{i})$ for each region $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\nThe given offset is $\\Delta = 413$.\n\nFor Region $1$: $s_1 = 55321114$, $e_1 = 55321333$.\n$s'_1 = s_1 + \\Delta - 1 = 55321114 + 413 - 1 = 55321526$.\n$e'_1 = e_1 + \\Delta = 55321333 + 413 = 55321746$.\nThe GRCh38 BED coordinates are $(s'_{1}, e'_{1}) = (55321526, 55321746)$.\n\nFor Region $2$: $s_2 = 55322001$, $e_2 = 55322231$.\n$s'_2 = s_2 + \\Delta - 1 = 55322001 + 413 - 1 = 55322413$.\n$e'_2 = e_2 + \\Delta = 55322231 + 413 = 55322644$.\nThe GRCh38 BED coordinates are $(s'_{2}, e'_{2}) = (55322413, 55322644)$.\n\nFor Region $3$: $s_3 = 55323900$, $e_3 = 55323985$.\n$s'_3 = s_3 + \\Delta - 1 = 55323900 + 413 - 1 = 55324312$.\n$e'_3 = e_3 + \\Delta = 55323985 + 413 = 55324398$.\nThe GRCh38 BED coordinates are $(s'_{3}, e'_{3}) = (55324312, 55324398)$.\n\n2. Compute the total pre-conversion length $L_{\\mathrm{pre}}$.\nThe length of each initial interval is $L_i = e_i - s_i + 1$.\n$L_1 = 55321333 - 55321114 + 1 = 219 + 1 = 220$ bp.\n$L_2 = 55322231 - 55322001 + 1 = 230 + 1 = 231$ bp.\n$L_3 = 55323985 - 55323900 + 1 = 85 + 1 = 86$ bp.\nThe total pre-conversion length is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_i = 220 + 231 + 86 = 537 \\text{ bp}.$$\n\n3. Compute the total post-conversion length $L_{\\mathrm{post}}$.\nThe length of each converted interval is $L'_i = e'_i - s'_i$.\n$L'_1 = 55321746 - 55321526 = 220$ bp.\n$L'_2 = 55322644 - 55322413 = 231$ bp.\n$L'_3 = 55324398 - 55324312 = 86$ bp.\nThe total post-conversion length is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L'_i = 220 + 231 + 86 = 537 \\text{ bp}.$$\n\n4. Verify equality and report the common total length.\nThe difference between the total lengths is $L_{\\mathrm{post}} - L_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 537 - 537 = 0$.\nThe equality holds, as expected. This can be shown analytically: the length of a converted interval is $L'_i = e'_i - s'_i = (e_i + \\Delta) - (s_i + \\Delta - 1) = e_i - s_i + 1 = L_i$. Thus, length is invariant under this specific transformation.\n\nThe common total length of the three exon intervals is $537$ base pairs.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the mapping of Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) coding DNA (`c.`) coordinates to absolute genomic positions on the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (`GRCh38`). This is a standard and fundamental task in genomic diagnostics.\n\nThe general principle for converting a `c.` coordinate to a genomic coordinate for a gene on the positive ($+$) strand is to sum the lengths of the coding portions of the exons to create a contiguous reference sequence, and then map positions from this constructed sequence back to their corresponding locations on the chromosome.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the coding portions of the transcript `NM_999999.1`. We are given the genomic coordinates of three exons on chromosome 12 and the location of the coding start, `c.1`.\n\nThe given exon coordinates are $1$-based and inclusive:\n- Exon $1$: start $S_1 = 100{,}000{,}101$, end $F_1 = 100{,}000{,}300$\n- Exon $2$: start $S_2 = 100{,}010{,}001$, end $F_2 = 100{,}010{,}150$\n- Exon $3$: start $S_3 = 100{,}020{,}501$, end $F_3 = 100{,}021{,}000$\n\nThe coding sequence start `c.1` is at genomic position $C_{start} = 100{,}000{,}110$. This lies within Exon $1$, as $100{,}000{,}101 \\le 100{,}000{,}110 \\le 100{,}000{,}300$.\n\nWe can now determine the length and `c.` coordinate range for the coding sequence within each exon.\n\n1.  **Exon 1 Analysis:**\n    The untranslated region (UTR) at the beginning of Exon $1$ has a length of $100{,}000{,}110 - 100{,}000{,}101 = 9$ bases. The coding sequence in Exon $1$ starts at $100{,}000{,}110$ and ends at the exon's end, $100{,}000{,}300$.\n    The length of the coding portion of Exon $1$ is $L_{c1} = F_1 - C_{start} + 1 = 100{,}000{,}300 - 100{,}000{,}110 + 1 = 191$ bases.\n    Thus, Exon $1$ contains the coding positions from `c.1` to `c.191`.\n\n2.  **Exon 2 Analysis:**\n    Exon $2$ is fully coding. Its length is $L_{c2} = F_2 - S_2 + 1 = 100{,}010{,}150 - 100{,}010{,}001 + 1 = 150$ bases.\n    The coding sequence in Exon $2$ begins immediately after that of Exon $1$. The first `c.` position in Exon $2$ is $191 + 1 = 192$.\n    The last `c.` position in Exon $2$ is $192 + 150 - 1 = 341$.\n    Thus, Exon $2$ contains the coding positions from `c.192` to `c.341`.\n\n3.  **Exon 3 Analysis:**\n    Exon $3$ is also treated as fully coding for the scope of this problem. Its length is $L_{c3} = F_3 - S_3 + 1 = 100{,}021{,}000 - 100{,}020{,}501 + 1 = 500$ bases.\n    The coding sequence in Exon $3$ begins after Exon $2$. The first `c.` position is $341 + 1 = 342$.\n    Thus, Exon $3$ contains coding positions starting from `c.342`.\n\nThis establishes the mapping:\n- Exon $1$: `c.1` to `c.191` corresponds to genomic positions $[100{,}000{,}110, 100{,}000{,}300]$.\n- Exon $2$: `c.192` to `c.341` corresponds to genomic positions $[100{,}010{,}001, 100{,}010{,}150]$.\n- Exon $3$: `c.342` to `c.841` corresponds to genomic positions $[100{,}020{,}501, 100{,}021{,}000]$.\n\nNow, we can compute the genomic position for each specified variant.\n\n**Variant 1: $c.50\\text{G}>\\text{A}$**\nThe position `c.50` falls within the range of Exon $1$ ($1 \\le 50 \\le 191$). The genomic coordinate is found by calculating the offset from the start of the coding sequence.\nGenomic Position = $C_{start} + (\\text{c.position} - 1) = 100{,}000{,}110 + (50 - 1) = 100{,}000{,}110 + 49 = 100{,}000{,}159$.\n\n**Variant 2: $c.200\\text{C}>\\text{T}$**\nThe position `c.200` falls within the range of Exon $2$ ($192 \\le 200 \\le 341$). The genomic coordinate is found by calculating the offset from the start of Exon $2$. The first `c.` position in Exon $2$ is `c.192`.\nThe offset from the start of Exon $2$'s coding sequence is $200 - 192 = 8$ bases.\nGenomic Position = $S_2 + \\text{offset} = 100{,}010{,}001 + 8 = 100{,}010{,}009$.\n\n**Variant 3: $c.341+5\\text{G}>\\text{T}$**\nThis variant is intronic. The position `c.341` is the last coding base of Exon $2$. Its genomic position is the end of Exon $2$, $F_2 = 100{,}010{,}150$. The `+5` notation indicates a position $5$ bases into the following intron. Since the gene is on the positive strand, we add to the genomic coordinate.\nGenomic Position = $F_2 + 5 = 100{,}010{,}150 + 5 = 100{,}010{,}155$.\n\n**Variant 4: $c.342-3\\text{A}>\\text{G}$**\nThis variant is also intronic. The position `c.342` is the first coding base of Exon $3$. Its genomic position is the start of Exon $3$, $S_3 = 100{,}020{,}501$. The `-3` notation indicates a position $3$ bases into the preceding intron. For a positive strand gene, we subtract from the genomic coordinate.\nGenomic Position = $S_3 - 3 = 100{,}020{,}501 - 3 = 100{,}020{,}498$.\n\nThe four computed absolute genomic positions on `GRCh38` are:\n1. $100{,}000{,}159$\n2. $100{,}010{,}009$\n3. $100{,}010{,}155$\n4. $100{,}020{,}498$\n\nThe problem requires these positions to be sorted in ascending order. The calculated order is already ascending.\nThe final result is the ordered list of these four integer coordinates.",

The number $15.438$ rounded to four significant figures is $15.44$.\nTherefore, the total saving is $15.44$ terabytes.",
