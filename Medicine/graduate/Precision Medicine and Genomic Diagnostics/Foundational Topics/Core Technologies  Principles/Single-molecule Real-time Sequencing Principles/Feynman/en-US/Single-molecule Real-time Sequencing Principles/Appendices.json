            "problem": "A single DNA polymerase observed in Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing incorporates nucleotides to extend a template-primer, producing fluorescence pulses whose Interpulse Duration (IPD) is the time between successive incorporations. Assume the polymerase follows classical Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics for nucleotide incorporation, with turnover limited by catalysis and substrate binding. Let the catalytic rate constant be $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, the Michaelis constant be $K_M$, and the free nucleotide (substrate) concentration be $[S]$. The sequencing speed is the number of bases incorporated per unit time by a single active enzyme under steady-state conditions, and the mean IPD is the expected waiting time between incorporations assuming a memoryless (Poisson) arrival process of pulses.\n\nGiven $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}=17\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_M=22\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $[S]=9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, determine the expected sequencing speed in bases per second. Then, analytically assess how doubling the nucleotide concentration from $[S]$ to $2[S]$ changes the mean IPD under two asymptotic regimes: when $[S]\\ll K_M$ and when $[S]\\gg K_M$. Report the two regime-specific IPD change factors as the ratio of the new mean IPD to the original mean IPD.\n\nExpress the final speed in bases per second and round it to four significant figures. Express the two IPD ratios as decimals without units. Provide the three results in the order: sequencing speed, low-substrate IPD ratio, high-substrate IPD ratio.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem lies in the application of the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. For a single enzyme molecule, the rate of reaction, or velocity ($V$), is given by:\n$$V = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nHere, $V$ represents the number of catalytic events (nucleotide incorporations) per unit time, which corresponds directly to the definition of sequencing speed provided in the problem. The parameters are the catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, the Michaelis constant $K_M$, and the substrate (nucleotide) concentration $[S]$.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the sequencing speed using the provided values: $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}=17\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_M=22\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $[S]=9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) for $K_M$ and $[S]$ are consistent, so they can be used directly in the ratio.\n$$V = \\frac{(17\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{22\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{153}{31}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is equivalent to \"events per second,\" which in this context is \"bases per second.\" Evaluating this expression numerically gives:\n$$V \\approx 4.93548387... \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V \\approx 4.935\\,\\text{bases/s}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the Interpulse Duration (IPD). The problem states that the mean IPD is the expected waiting time between successive incorporation events. If the incorporation events follow a Poisson process with a rate $V$, the waiting time between events is exponentially distributed with a mean of $1/V$. Therefore, the mean IPD is the reciprocal of the sequencing speed:\n$$\\text{Mean IPD} = \\frac{1}{V} = \\frac{K_M + [S]}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}$$\n\nWe are asked to assess how doubling the nucleotide concentration from $[S]$ to $2[S]$ changes the mean IPD. Let $\\text{IPD}_{\\text{orig}}$ be the mean IPD at concentration $[S]$ and $\\text{IPD}_{\\text{new}}$ be the mean IPD at concentration $2[S]$.\n$$\\text{IPD}_{\\text{orig}} = \\frac{K_M + [S]}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}$$\n$$\\text{IPD}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{K_M + 2[S]}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} (2[S])}$$\nWe need to find the ratio $R = \\frac{\\text{IPD}_{\\text{new}}}{\\text{IPD}_{\\text{orig}}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{K_M + 2[S]}{2 k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}}{\\frac{K_M + [S]}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}} = \\frac{K_M + 2[S]}{2 k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_M + [S]} = \\frac{K_M + 2[S]}{2(K_M + [S])}$$\nThis is the general expression for the IPD change factor. Now we must evaluate this ratio in two asymptotic regimes.\n\nRegime 1: Low-substrate concentration, $[S] \\ll K_M$.\nIn this limit, the concentration $[S]$ is negligible compared to $K_M$. Thus, we can make the following approximations in the numerator and denominator of the ratio expression:\n$$K_M + 2[S] \\approx K_M$$\n$$K_M + [S] \\approx K_M$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for $R$ yields the ratio for the low-substrate regime, $R_{\\text{low}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{low}} \\approx \\frac{K_M}{2(K_M)} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\nIn this regime, the reaction rate is approximately first-order in $[S]$ ($V \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}[S]$), so doubling the substrate concentration doubles the rate, which in turn halves the mean waiting time (IPD).\n\nRegime 2: High-substrate concentration, $[S] \\gg K_M$.\nIn this limit, the enzyme is saturated with substrate. The Michaelis constant $K_M$ becomes negligible compared to the substrate concentration $[S]$. Thus, we can make the following approximations:\n$$K_M + 2[S] \\approx 2[S]$$\n$$K_M + [S] \\approx [S]$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$ gives the ratio for the high-substrate regime, $R_{\\text{high}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{high}} \\approx \\frac{2[S]}{2([S])} = 1$$\nIn this regime, the reaction rate approaches its maximum value, $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and becomes independent of $[S]$. Therefore, doubling the already high substrate concentration has no significant effect on the incorporation rate, and the mean IPD remains unchanged, resulting in a ratio of $1$.\n\nThe three results to be reported are the sequencing speed ($4.935\\,\\text{bases/s}$), the low-substrate IPD ratio ($0.5$), and the high-substrate IPD ratio ($1$).",

            "problem": "In Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing using Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS), a single polymerase generates multiple independent passes across a circularized DNA insert, producing a set of subreads for each position. Consider a per-pass base substitution error probability of $\\epsilon$, with all three incorrect nucleotides equally likely for a substitution (so each wrong nucleotide occurs with probability $\\epsilon/3$). Assume independence of errors across passes, ignore insertions and deletions, and suppose the CCS consensus caller uses a strict majority-of-identical-base rule at each position: it assigns a base if and only if more than half of the passes agree on that identical base. Under these assumptions:\n\n1. Derive the basewise CCS consensus error probability $p_{\\mathrm{err}}(N)$ as a function of the number of passes $N$ and the per-pass error probability $\\epsilon$.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the general expression for the consensus error probability and the corresponding quality score. Second, we apply this to a specific dataset to calculate a probability.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Basewise Consensus Error Probability ($p_{\\mathrm{err}}(N)$) and Quality Value ($\\mathrm{QV}(N)$)**\n\nLet us consider a single nucleotide position. Assume the true base at this position is $B_T$. The sequencing process involves $N$ independent passes. In each pass, a base is read.\n\nThe per-pass substitution error probability is given as $\\epsilon$. Thus, for a single pass:\n- The probability of reading the correct base $B_T$ is $P(\\text{correct}) = 1 - \\epsilon$.\n- The probability of reading any of the three incorrect bases is $\\epsilon$. Since all incorrect nucleotides are equally likely, the probability of reading a specific incorrect base (e.g., $B_{I1}$) is $P(\\text{specific incorrect}) = \\epsilon/3$.\n\nThe consensus calling rule is a strict majority vote.

These events are mutually exclusive.

Let $p_I = \\epsilon/3$ be the probability of observing a specific incorrect base in a single pass.

In a SMRT circular consensus sequencing workflow, each single molecule produces multiple polymerase passes across the same insert, enabling within-molecule consistency checks. In tandem repeat regions, polymerase slippage can spuriously produce apparent single-repeat insertions on a given pass, even when no true insertion exists. Assume the following foundational base: independent incorporation events across passes for a given molecule, independence across molecules, and a calibrated per-pass slippage probability in the repeat of interest.\n\nYou design a method that leverages read-level consistency by defining, for each molecule, an indicator that is equal to one if all passes show a $+1$-repeat call at the locus and zero otherwise. Consider two models:\n- Null hypothesis $H_{0}$ (repeat-mediated artifact only): all molecules are truly reference, and the probability that any pass shows a $+1$-repeat call is a known calibration value $p_{s}$ (per-pass slippage), independent across passes. Hence, the probability that a molecule with $R$ passes shows all $+1$ calls is $p_{s}^{R}$.\n- Alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$ (true insertion present at unknown sample fraction): a fraction $f \\in [0,1]$ of molecules derives from the $+1$ insertion haplotype and the remaining fraction $1-f$ from the reference haplotype. Conditional on haplotype, each pass shows a $+1$ call with probability $1-p_{s}$ for insertion molecules and with probability $p_{s}$ for reference molecules, independently across passes. Thus, the probability that a molecule shows all $+1$ calls is $p(f) = f(1-p_{s})^{R} + (1-f)p_{s}^{R}$.\n\nYou obtain $n$ independent molecules, each with $R$ passes, and observe that $a$ molecules have all $+1$ calls.
