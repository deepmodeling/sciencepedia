This exercise  challenges you to apply the fundamental laws of Mendelian genetics to a digenic recessive disorder.

Specifically, the disease phenotype occurs only in individuals who are genotype $aa$ at gene A and genotype $bb$ at gene B. Assume the two loci assort independently (they are on different chromosomes or effectively unlinked) and the disease has incomplete penetrance, such that an individual with genotype $aa$ at gene A and $bb$ at gene B manifests the disease with probability $f$, where $0 \\leq f \\leq 1$.\n\nA couple, where both parents have the genotype $AaBb$, are planning to have children. There is no additional information about affected status of prior children; you may treat transmissions as governed by Mendelian segregation with equal gamete contributions.

            "solution": "The problem describes a digenic recessive model where the disease phenotype requires simultaneous homozygosity for the recessive alleles at two independent loci. The foundational principles we use are:\n\n1. Mendel's law of segregation: For a single locus with heterozygous parents in a cross of $Aa \\times Aa$, each parent transmits allele $A$ or $a$ with probability $1/2$.\n2. Mendel's law of independent assortment: For two loci on different chromosomes (or effectively unlinked), transmissions at the two loci are independent.\n3. The definition of penetrance: If $D$ denotes the disease phenotype and $G$ denotes the required disease genotype, then $\\Pr(D \\mid G) = f$, and for individuals not carrying $G$, $\\Pr(D \\mid \\text{not } G) = 0$ under the model.\n\nWe seek the familial recurrence risk, which is the probability that a randomly drawn child from this mating is affected.

            "introduction": "Our initial model assumed that genes assort independently, but this is often not the case for genes located on the same chromosome. This practice  introduces the crucial concept of genetic linkage and recombination, exploring how the physical arrangement of alleles on a parent's chromosomes—known as cis and trans phases—alters transmission probabilities and, consequently, disease risk. Mastering this allows for more accurate risk prediction when loci are not independent.",

            "problem": "In digenic inheritance, disease occurs when an individual carries at least one deleterious allele at each of two loci, denoted by locus $A$ with alleles $A$ (deleterious) and $a$ (reference), and locus $B$ with alleles $B$ (deleterious) and $b$ (reference). Consider a nuclear family in which one parent is a double heterozygote and the other parent is a non-carrier. Specifically, the transmitting parent has two phased haplotypes and is either in the cis (coupling) phase $AB/ab$ or in the trans (repulsion) phase $Ab/aB$. The other parent is $ab/ab$. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- Mendel’s law of segregation and the standard meiotic recombination model with recombination fraction $r$ between loci $A$ and $B$, where $0 \\leq r \\leq \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n- No de novo mutation, no gene conversion, and no transmission distortion.\n- Penetrance $f$ is the probability of disease conditional on carrying at least one $A$ allele and at least one $B$ allele; all other genotypes have penetrance $0$.\n\nUsing these bases, derive from first principles the expected transmission probabilities that an offspring inherits both $A$ and $B$ alleles under the cis and trans configurations. Then, compute the disease risks for the offspring under each configuration as functions of $r$ and $f$, and finally provide a single simplified analytic expression for the risk difference\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) - R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f).$$\nExpress your final answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $r$ and $f$ only. No rounding is required, and no units apply.",
            "solution": "The problem requires calculating the disease risk for an offspring under two scenarios for the parental genotype configuration (cis and trans) and then finding the difference between these risks.\n\nThe mating is between a double heterozygote parent and a non-carrier parent with genotype $ab/ab$. The non-carrier parent can only produce gametes of type $ab$. Therefore, the genotype of the offspring is determined solely by the gamete inherited from the double heterozygote parent.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a disease phenotype requires a genotype with at least one deleterious allele $A$ and at least one deleterious allele $B$. Given that the second parent is $ab/ab$, the only way for an offspring to meet this condition is to inherit an $AB$ gamete from the heterozygous parent, resulting in the genotype $AB/ab$. All other offspring genotypes ($Ab/ab$, $aB/ab$, $ab/ab$) will not have both deleterious alleles and thus will have a disease penetrance of $0$.\n\nThe disease risk, $R$, is the probability that an offspring develops the disease. This can be expressed using the law of total probability:\n$$R = P(\\text{Disease}) = P(\\text{Disease} | \\text{Genotype is } AB/ab) \\times P(\\text{Genotype is } AB/ab)$$\nGiven that the penetrance for the $AB/ab$ genotype is $f$, this simplifies to:\n$$R = f \\times P(\\text{Offspring inherits an } AB \\text{ gamete})$$\n\nWe need to calculate this probability for both the cis and trans configurations of the heterozygous parent.\n\n#### 1.

Gametes carrying haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$ are recombinant.\n\n- The total probability of recombination is $r$.\n- The total probability of no recombination is $1-r$.\n\nThe meiotic process produces four types of gametes with equal likelihood from the recombinant or non-recombinant pools.\n- **Non-recombinant gametes**: The probability of forming a non-recombinant gamete is $1-r$. This is split equally between the two non-recombinant types, $AB$ and $ab$.\n  $$P(\\text{gamete is } AB) = P(\\text{gamete is } ab) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\n- **Recombinant gametes**: The probability of forming a recombinant gamete is $r$. This is split equally between the two recombinant types, $Ab$ and $aB$.\n  $$P(\\text{gamete is } Ab) = P(\\text{gamete is } aB) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\n\nThe probability that the offspring inherits an $AB$ gamete is $T_{\\text{cis}}(A,B) = P(\\text{gamete is } AB) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n\nThe disease risk for the offspring in the cis case, $R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f)$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) = f \\times T_{\\text{cis}}(A,B) = f \\left( \\frac{1-r}{2} \\right)$$\n\n#### 2. Trans (Repulsion) Configuration: $Ab/aB$\nIn this configuration, the parental haplotypes are $Ab$ and $aB$. Gametes carrying these haplotypes are non-recombinant. Gametes carrying haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$ are now the recombinant ones.\n\n- **Non-recombinant gametes**: The probability of forming a non-recombinant gamete is $1-r$.

This is split equally between the two recombinant types, $AB$ and $ab$.\n  $$P(\\text{gamete is } AB) = P(\\text{gamete is } ab) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\n\nThe probability that the offspring inherits an $AB$ gamete is $T_{\\text{trans}}(A,B) = P(\\text{gamete is } AB) = \\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe disease risk for the offspring in the trans case, $R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f)$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f) = f \\times T_{\\text{trans}}(A,B) = f \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)$$\n\n#### 3. Risk Difference: $\\Delta R(r,f)$\nFinally, we compute the risk difference as requested.\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) - R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f)$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = f \\left( \\frac{1-r}{2} \\right) - f \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)$$\nWe can factor out the common term $f$ and combine the fractions:\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = \\frac{f}{2} ( (1-r) - r )$$\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = \\frac{f}{2} (1 - 2r)$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = f \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - r \\right)$$\nThis is the final, simplified analytic expression for the risk difference in terms of $r$ and $f$.",
