In a sample containing a mixture of tumor and normal cells, the observed $VAF$ of a somatic mutation is not a fixed value but is directly influenced by the sample's tumor purity, the variant's copy number state, and its clonality.

Histopathological assessment and computational deconvolution both concordantly estimate tumor purity to be $0.40$ (fraction of tumor cells), with the remainder being non-neoplastic tissue. At a locus of interest, copy-number profiling indicates copy-neutral diploidy and no allele-specific imbalance. A somatic Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) is assessed to be clonal (present in all tumor cells) and heterozygous (one mutated allele and one wild-type allele per tumor cell). Assume the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules from tumor and normal compartments are equally represented in library preparation, sequencing is unbiased with respect to alleles, and formalin-induced artifacts are negligible due to appropriate uracil-DNA glycosylase treatment.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions that relate the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) to the fraction of variant alleles among all alleles in a mixed tumor-normal sample, derive from first principles the expected $VAF$ for this scenario. Express your answer as a unitless decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics and oncology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated using objective, formal language. The problem is a direct application of fundamental definitions to a realistic, albeit simplified, scenario in genomic diagnostics.\n\nThe Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads at a specific genomic locus that carry the variant allele, out of the total number of reads covering that locus. Under the stated assumption that sequencing is unbiased and the DNA from all cells is equally represented, the expected VAF is equivalent to the proportion of variant alleles in the total pool of DNA from the mixed cell population.\n\nWe are given the following variables and conditions:\n- Tumor purity, $p = 0.40$. This represents the fraction of tumor cells in the sample.\n- The fraction of normal, non-neoplastic cells is therefore $1 - p = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- The locus is in a state of copy-neutral diploidy. This means both tumor cells and normal cells have a copy number of $2$ at this locus. Let $CN_T$ be the copy number in tumor cells and $CN_N$ be the copy number in normal cells. Thus, $CN_T = 2$ and $CN_N = 2$.\n- The Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) is clonal, meaning it is present in all tumor cells.\n- The SNV is heterozygous in the tumor cells. This means each tumor cell contains one mutated (variant) allele and one wild-type allele at this locus. Let $M_T$ be the number of mutated alleles per tumor cell. Therefore, $M_T = 1$.\n- As the mutation is somatic, the normal cells do not carry the variant. Let $M_N$ be the number of mutated alleles per normal cell. Thus, $M_N = 0$.\n\nTo derive the expected VAF, we calculate the total number of mutated alleles and the total number of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) in a representative sample. We can express these quantities in terms of the fractional contributions from the tumor ($p$) and normal ($1-p$) cell populations.\n\nThe number of mutated alleles in the sample is determined solely by the tumor compartment, as the normal cells are wild-type. The contribution to the mutated allele pool from the tumor fraction is proportional to the fraction of tumor cells multiplied by the number of mutated alleles per tumor cell.\nProportional number of mutated alleles = $p \\times M_T = 0.40 \\times 1 = 0.40$.\n\nThe total number of alleles at this locus in the sample is the sum of alleles from both the tumor and normal compartments.\n- Proportional number of alleles from the tumor fraction = $p \\times CN_T = 0.40 \\times 2 = 0.80$.\n- Proportional number of alleles from the normal fraction = $(1 - p) \\times CN_N = (1 - 0.40) \\times 2 = 0.60 \\times 2 = 1.20$.\n\nThe total proportional number of all alleles in the sample is the sum of these contributions:\nTotal proportional number of alleles = $(p \\times CN_T) + ((1 - p) \\times CN_N) = 0.80 + 1.20 = 2.00$.\nThis result is expected, as every cell in the sample (both tumor and normal) is diploid at this locus, so there are two alleles per cell on average.\n\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of the proportional number of mutated alleles to the total proportional number of all alleles.\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\times M_T}{p \\times CN_T + (1 - p) \\times CN_N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40 \\times 1}{(0.40 \\times 2) + (0.60 \\times 2)} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{0.80 + 1.20} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{2.00} $$\n$$ VAF = 0.20 $$\nA simpler form of the equation for the specific case of a clonal heterozygous SNV in a diploid region (where $M_T=1$, $CN_T=2$, $CN_N=2$) is:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\times 1}{p \\times 2 + (1 - p) \\times 2} = \\frac{p}{2p + 2 - 2p} = \\frac{p}{2} $$\nUsing this simplified formula:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{2} = 0.20 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ VAF = 0.2000 $$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the definition and calculation of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) based on a specific scenario involving next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from a targeted panel. The solution requires a step-by-step derivation from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks in order.\n\n**1. Definition of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)**\n\nAs stated in the problem and consistent with standard practice in the field, Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is a quantitative measure of genomic instability in a tumor. It is defined as the total number of somatic, coding, nonsynonymous mutations identified in a tumor specimen, normalized by the size of the genomic region that was effectively interrogated by the sequencing assay. The normalization accounts for the portion of the gene panel that is \"callable,\" meaning the region where mutations could have been reliably detected given the quality and depth of the sequencing data. The final value is typically expressed in units of mutations per megabase (mut/Mb).\n\n**2. Derivation of Callable Megabases**\n\nThe calculation of the callable genomic territory begins with the intended target size of the assay and sequentially applies filters for mappability, sequencing depth, and base quality.\n\nLet $S_{intended}$ be the intended coding target size of the panel, which is given as $1.92$ Mb.\n\nFirst, we account for regions that are excluded due to low mappability or presence on a blacklist. A fraction $f_{map\\_exclude} = 0.08$ of the intended target is removed. The remaining high-mappability territory, $S_{mappable}$, is:\n$$S_{mappable} = S_{intended} \\times (1 - f_{map\\_exclude})$$\n$$S_{mappable} = 1.92 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times (1 - 0.08) = 1.92 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.92 = 1.7664 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nNext, we apply the depth-of-coverage filter. The assay's callability definition requires a minimum deduplicated depth of $80\\times$. The given depth distribution applies to the high-mappability territory, $S_{mappable}$. The fraction of bases meeting the depth requirement, $f_{depth\\_pass}$, is the sum of the fractions of bases at depth $\\ge 120\\times$ and at depth in the range $[80, 119]$.\n$$f_{depth\\_pass} = f_{\\text{depth} \\ge 120} + f_{80 \\le \\text{depth} \\le 119}$$\n$$f_{depth\\_pass} = 0.55 + 0.30 = 0.85$$\nThe size of the territory that meets both mappability and depth criteria, $S_{depth\\_ok}$, is:\n$$S_{depth\\_ok} = S_{mappable} \\times f_{depth\\_pass}$$\n$$S_{depth\\_ok} = 1.7664 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.85 = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nFinally, a base-quality filter is applied. This filter removes a fraction $f_{bq\\_fail} = 0.02$ of the bases that would otherwise be considered callable (i.e., those within $S_{depth\\_ok}$). The final callable territory, $S_{callable}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{callable} = S_{depth\\_ok} \\times (1 - f_{bq\\_fail})$$\n$$S_{callable} = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times (1 - 0.02) = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.98$$\n$$S_{callable} = 1.4714112 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nSo, the total size of the callable region interrogated by the assay is $1.4714112$ Mb.\n\n**3. Computation of TMB**\n\nTo compute the TMB, we first need to determine the total number of somatic nonsynonymous coding mutations, which serves as the numerator. The problem provides a list of detected high-confidence somatic variants, all of which are nonsynonymous and alter the resulting protein product. These include single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). We sum the counts for all listed categories:\n$$N_{mut} = N_{\\text{missense}} + N_{\\text{nonsense}} + N_{\\text{splice}} + N_{\\text{frameshift}} + N_{\\text{in-frame}}$$\n$$N_{mut} = 26 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 34$$\nThe total count of nonsynonymous mutations is $34$.\n\nNow, we can compute the TMB using the provided formula, dividing the total mutation count by the callable territory in megabases:\n$$TMB = \\frac{N_{mut}}{S_{callable}}$$\n$$TMB = \\frac{34}{1.4714112 \\, \\text{Mb}} \\approx 23.106509 \\, \\frac{\\text{mut}}{\\text{Mb}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$TMB \\approx 23.1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mut}}{\\text{Mb}}$$",

All provided data and terminologies are standard in the field of precision oncology.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The concepts of WES, TMB, VAF, tumor purity, copy-number analysis, IHC, mismatch repair genes (`MSH2`, `MSH6`), and hereditary cancer syndromes (Lynch syndrome) are scientifically sound and central to modern oncology. The given values are plausible. The TMB calculation is consistent: $700$ variants / $20$ Mb = $35$ mut/Mb.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient, rich data to allow for a reasoned decision. The question asks for the \"most defensible decision rule,\" which is appropriate for a molecular tumor board setting where evidence is weighed to make a clinical recommendation.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical and genomic data, free from subjective language.\n4.  **Consistency**: There is a critical, and intentional, discrepancy between the given tumor purity and the observed VAF distribution. This discrepancy is not a flaw in the problem statement but is rather the central clue that must be identified and interpreted using first principles. It points to a real-world challenge in interpreting tumor-only sequencing data. The problem is internally consistent and not contradictory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-formed question that tests the application of fundamental principles in cancer genomics to a realistic clinical scenario. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the relationship between Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), tumor purity ($p$), and the distinction between germline and somatic variants.\n\nLet's define the expected VAF for different types of variants in a sample with tumor purity $p$ and normal cell contamination $(1-p)$, assuming a diploid (copy number $2$) state in both tumor and normal tissue, as stated in the problem.\n\n1.  **Heterozygous Germline Variant**: A germline variant is present in every cell of the body (both tumor and normal). Therefore, in a diploid genome, one of the two alleles carries the variant.\n    The number of variant alleles is proportional to $p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    The total number of alleles is proportional to $p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n    The expected VAF is:\n    $$VAF_{germline, het} = \\frac{p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\n2.  **Clonal Heterozygous Somatic Variant**: A somatic variant originates in the tumor and is absent from normal cells. If it is \"clonal,\" it is present in all tumor cells.\n    The number of variant alleles is proportional to $p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = p$.\n    The total number of alleles is proportional to $p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n    The expected VAF is:\n    $$VAF_{somatic, het, clonal} = \\frac{p}{2}$$\n\n**Applying Principles to the Case Data:**\n\nGiven tumor purity $p = 0.35$, we can calculate the expected VAF for a clonal somatic mutation:\n$$VAF_{somatic, het, clonal} = \\frac{0.35}{2} = 0.175$$\n\nThe problem states that approximately $45\\%$ of the detected variants have a VAF between $0.45$ and $0.55$. This observed VAF range is centered around $0.5$, which is the theoretical VAF for a heterozygous germline variant. It is starkly different from the expected VAF of $0.175$ for a clonal somatic variant. This strongly suggests that a large proportion of the variants identified by the tumor-only sequencing are, in fact, germline variants, not somatic mutations.\n\nFurthermore, Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is defined based on *somatic* mutations. The reported TMB of $35$ mut/Mb is based on all $700$ variants. If $45\\%$ of these ($0.45 \\times 700 = 315$ variants) are germline, they should be excluded from the TMB calculation. The corrected somatic TMB would be approximately:\n$$TMB_{somatic} = \\frac{700 - 315}{20 \\text{ Mb}} = \\frac{385}{20 \\text{ Mb}} = 19.25 \\text{ mut/Mb}$$\nThis is a significant reduction and could affect therapeutic decisions that rely on specific TMB thresholds.\n\n**Clinical and Genetic Context:**\n- A patient age of $38$ is young for colorectal cancer.\n- A family history of early-onset colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative is a major red flag for a hereditary cancer syndrome.\n- The `MSH2` gene is a key mismatch repair (MMR) gene; germline pathogenic variants in `MSH2` cause Lynch syndrome, the most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome.\n- The identified `MSH2` variant is \"truncating,\" which is typically pathogenic.\n- The VAF of the `MSH2` variant is $0.49$, falling squarely in the VAF cluster suggestive of germline origin.\n- The IHC result showing loss of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins is the classic phenotype for an inactivating `MSH2` mutation, confirming its functional impact.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combined genomic and clinical evidence points overwhelmingly to two conclusions:\n1.  The patient likely has Lynch syndrome due to a germline pathogenic variant in `MSH2`.\n2.  The TMB calculated from tumor-only sequencing is artifactually inflated by the inclusion of numerous germline variants.\n\nThe only definitive way to confirm the germline status of the `MSH2` variant and to accurately determine the somatic mutation landscape (and thus the true TMB) is to sequence a matched normal sample (e.g., peripheral blood).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Do not request matched normal sequencing because low tumor purity can explain VAF ≈ 0.5 for clonal somatic variants; proceed directly to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy based on high TMB.**\nThis statement's premise is false. As derived above, for a clonal somatic variant, VAF should be $p/2 = 0.175$, not approximately $0.5$. A VAF of $0.5$ for a somatic variant would require a purity of nearly $100\\%$ ($p \\approx 1.0$) and likely LOH, which contradicts the given purity of $p=0.35$. Ignoring the strong evidence of a germline finding is clinically irresponsible.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Request matched normal sequencing because a large fraction of variants with VAF ≈ 0.5 despite p = 0.35, the presence of a truncating variant in a canonical hereditary cancer gene (MSH2) at VAF ≈ 0.5, and uncertainty in somatic status together indicate likely inclusion of germline variants inflating TMB and require clarification for both treatment selection and hereditary risk management.**\nThis option accurately synthesizes all the key data points: the VAF-purity discrepancy, its implication for germline variant contamination, the specific high-risk `MSH2` finding, the consequence of TMB inflation, and the dual need for clarification for both therapy (treatment selection) and hereditary cancer risk assessment. The proposed action—requesting matched normal sequencing—is the correct and necessary next step.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Defer matched normal sequencing and rely on population frequency filtering alone, because rare germline variants are sufficiently captured by databases and TMB computation is robust to residual germline calls.**\nPopulation frequency filtering (e.g., MAF $< 0.01$) is designed to remove common, benign polymorphisms. It is ineffective at distinguishing rare pathogenic germline variants (like those causing Lynch syndrome) from true somatic mutations, as both are rare in the general population. The claim that \"TMB computation is robust to residual germline calls\" is proven false by the calculation above, where the TMB is nearly halved after accounting for likely germline variants. Deferring sequencing would neglect a critical diagnosis with life-long implications for the patient and their family.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Request matched normal sequencing only if microsatellite instability (MSI) polymerase chain reaction testing is negative, because positive MSI renders somatic versus germline status irrelevant to therapy.**\nThe IHC result (loss of MSH2/MSH6) is a strong predictor that MSI testing will be positive (MSI-High). While MSI-High status is a biomarker for immunotherapy, rendering the exact TMB value less critical for that one decision, the germline vs. somatic status of the `MSH2` variant is of paramount importance. Confirming a germline `MSH2` mutation establishes a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, which requires specific cancer surveillance protocols for the patient and genetic counseling and testing for family members. The germline status is far from irrelevant.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Do not request matched normal sequencing unless copy-number analysis proves complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at MSH2, because LOH is the sole determinant of whether a variant is germline versus somatic in tumor-only data.**\nThis assertion is false. LOH is not the \"sole determinant\" of variant origin. VAF analysis in the context of tumor purity is a powerful tool, as demonstrated here. The presence or absence of LOH would alter the expected VAF, but it does not by itself distinguish germline from somatic. For a germline variant, the VAF of $0.49$ is more consistent with the absence of LOH. Demanding LOH as a prerequisite for further investigation is illogical and based on an incorrect understanding of cancer genetics.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",
