This practice delves into the law of mass action to explore how the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 competes with the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 for the same ligand, CD80.

            "problem": "In precision oncology and immunotherapy, competition between T cell receptors and inhibitory receptors for shared ligands on antigen-presenting cells can be approximated by equilibrium binding under the law of mass action. Consider the monovalent binding of Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on a T cell to the same ligand, Cluster of Differentiation 80 (CD80), modeled as independent equilibria. Assume the following: (i) binding is non-cooperative and at equilibrium, (ii) dissociation constants for CD28–CD80 and CTLA-4–CD80 are given by $K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}}=4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}=0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, respectively, (iii) the free ligand concentration is maintained at $[L]=1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (ligand is in excess relative to receptor so that ligand depletion is negligible), and (iv) CD28 and CTLA-4 have equal total abundances on the cell, so that any comparison of occupancy between receptors is not confounded by receptor copy number.\n\nStarting from the definition of the dissociation constant as the ratio of free receptor and ligand to complex at equilibrium, and mass conservation for each receptor, derive an expression for the equilibrium fractional occupancy of each receptor by CD80 in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental law of mass action applied to receptor-ligand binding, a standard model in biophysical chemistry and immunology. The provided parameters and assumptions are physically realistic and sufficient to obtain a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a receptor is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound to a ligand at equilibrium. Let $R$ denote the receptor, $L$ the ligand, and $C$ the receptor-ligand complex. The binding reaction is represented by the equilibrium:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons C\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[C]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[C]$ are the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of the receptor, $[R]_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of its free and bound forms:\n$$\n[R]_T = [R] + [C]\n$$\nFrom this mass balance equation, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = [R]_T - [C]$. Substituting this into the expression for $K_D$:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{([R]_T - [C])[L]}{[C]}\n$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the complex, $[C]$.\n$$\nK_D [C] = ([R]_T - [C])[L] = [R]_T[L] - [C][L]\n$$\n$$\nK_D [C] + [C][L] = [R]_T[L]\n$$\n$$\n[C](K_D + [L]) = [R]_T[L]\n$$\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{[R]_T[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the bound receptor concentration to the total receptor concentration:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{[R]_T}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[C]$ into the definition of $\\theta$ yields the general expression for fractional occupancy in terms of the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_D$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{[R]_T} \\left( \\frac{[R]_T[L]}{K_D + [L]} \\right) = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. It is a form of the Langmuir binding isotherm. This derivation assumes that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ is constant, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to the two specific receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4, binding to the ligand CD80. The problem states that their binding equilibria are independent.\n\nFor CD28:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}} + [L]}\n$$\nFor CTLA-4:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} + [L]}\n$$\nTo determine which receptor preferentially occupies the ligand CD80, we compare their fractional occupancies, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$. Since $[L]$ is the same for both, the receptor with the smaller denominator will have a larger fractional occupancy. The denominators are $K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}} + [L]$ and $K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} + [L]$.\nWe are given $K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}} = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nSince $K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} < K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}}$, it follows that $(K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} + [L]) < (K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}} + [L])$.\nConsequently, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} > \\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$. This indicates that CTLA-4, having a lower dissociation constant (higher affinity), preferentially occupies the ligand CD80 at the given concentration.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for the fractional occupancies using the provided data: $[L] = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $K_{D,\\mathrm{CD28}} = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $K_{D,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor CD28:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nFor CTLA-4:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{1.4} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal, we get $\\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857...$.\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\nFor CD28, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}} = 0.2000$.\nFor CTLA-4, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} \\approx 0.7143$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix in the order $(\\theta_{\\mathrm{CD28}}, \\theta_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}})$.",

Tumor Mutational Burden is a clinically relevant biomarker for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The definition provided is standard. Modeling mutation counts with a Poisson distribution is a common and appropriate statistical approach in genomics. The use of targeted panels, the concept of \"callable\" sequence, and the calibration of panel-based estimates to a \"gold standard\" like whole-exome sequencing are all standard practices in molecular diagnostics. The numerical values provided are realistic for such an assay.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear set of instructions to arrive at a unique numerical solution. The logic is direct and unambiguous.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of any subjective or non-scientific claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the invalidation checklist. It is scientifically valid, relevant to the specified topic, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps: first, we determine the size of the genome region that was effectively assayed; second, we calculate the TMB as measured by the targeted panel; and third, we apply the provided linear calibration model to estimate the whole-exome TMB.\n\nLet $L_{nom}$ be the nominal size of the targeted panel in megabases (Mb). The problem states $L_{nom} = 1.2$ Mb.\nLet $f_{call}$ be the fraction of the panel's bases that are callable. The problem states $f_{call} = 0.95$.\nThe total callable coding sequence length, denoted $L_{call}$, is the product of the nominal panel size and the callable fraction:\n$$L_{call} = L_{nom} \\times f_{call}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{call} = 1.2 \\text{ Mb} \\times 0.95 = 1.14 \\text{ Mb}$$\n\nLet $N_{mut}$ be the number of observed somatic nonsynonymous mutations. The problem states $N_{mut} = 36$.\nThe problem defines TMB as the expected number of mutations per megabase and states that mutations follow a homogeneous Poisson process. For a Poisson process, the rate parameter $\\lambda$ represents the expected number of events per unit of exposure. In this context, the TMB is the rate parameter $\\lambda$, the events are mutations, and the exposure is the callable sequence length in megabases.\nThe problem specifies that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter is the observed count divided by the exposure. Therefore, the panel-based TMB estimate, denoted $TMB_{panel}$, is calculated as:\n$$TMB_{panel} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{L_{call}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $N_{mut}$ and $L_{call}$:\n$$TMB_{panel} = \\frac{36}{1.14} \\text{ mutations/Mb}$$\n\nFinally, we use the provided linear calibration model to convert the panel-based TMB to the corresponding whole-exome TMB, denoted $TMB_{WES}$. The model is:\n$$TMB_{WES} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times TMB_{panel}$$\nThe given parameters are the intercept $\\alpha = 0.8$ and the slope $\\beta = 0.92$. We substitute the expression for $TMB_{panel}$ into this equation:\n$$TMB_{WES} = 0.8 + 0.92 \\times \\left( \\frac{36}{1.14} \\right)$$\nWe now compute the numerical value.\n$$TMB_{panel} = \\frac{36}{1.14} \\approx 31.578947...$$\n$$TMB_{WES} = 0.8 + 0.92 \\times 31.578947...$$\n$$TMB_{WES} = 0.8 + 29.052631...$$\n$$TMB_{WES} = 29.852631...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $29.852631...$ are $2$, $9$, $8$, and $5$. The fifth significant digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe final calibrated whole-exome TMB is $29.85$.",

It provides a standard clinical scenario involving immunotherapy for melanoma, a context where pseudoprogression is a known and critical phenomenon. The provided data (lesion sizes, time points, biomarker values for PD-L$1$, TMB, and ctDNA) are all within plausible ranges for such a case. The definitions of RECIST $1.1$ and iRECIST are stated correctly. The problem is self-contained and does not contain contradictory information or violate fundamental principles. The task requires a direct application of the provided rules and data to reach a logical conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to explain pseudoprogression and the iRECIST approach, then apply them to the patient's data to determine the best decision rule among the options.\n\n**1. Explanation of Concepts**\n- **Pseudoprogression**: In a subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, an initial radiographic assessment may show an increase in the size of existing tumors or the appearance of new lesions. This apparent \"progression\" is not due to tumor cell proliferation but rather to the infiltration of T-lymphocytes and other immune cells into the tumor microenvironment, causing inflammation and edema. This inflammatory response is a harbinger of an effective anti-tumor immune attack. Following this transient increase, a subsequent scan often reveals a decrease in tumor burden. Mistaking this phenomenon for true progressive disease could lead to the premature discontinuation of a beneficial therapy. The patient's high PD-L$1$ score ($80\\%$) and high TMB ($14$ mut/Mb) are biomarkers that predict a higher likelihood of response to PD-$1$ blockade, which also correlates with a higher incidence of atypical response patterns like pseudoprogression.\n- **iRECIST (immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)**: iRECIST was developed to account for pseudoprogression and other atypical response patterns. Unlike RECIST $1.1$, which would define progression at the first sign of sufficient growth or new lesions, iRECIST introduces a confirmation step.\n    - **New Lesions and iUPD**: The appearance of new lesions, as seen in this patient at $t_1$, does not immediately signify confirmed progression. Instead, it defines **immune Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (iUPD)**.\n    - **Confirmation**: If a patient is clinically stable, treatment is continued, and a follow-up assessment is performed in $4$ to $8$ weeks. If this confirmatory scan shows further progression, the disease status is updated to **immune Confirmed Progressive Disease (iCPD)**. If the scan shows stable or decreased tumor burden, progression is not confirmed, and the iUPD designation is overturned.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Patient's Course**\n\n- **At $t_1 = 8$ weeks**:\n    - **Radiographic Assessment**: The sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions increased from $S_0 = 65$ mm to $S_1 = 78$ mm. The percent change is $((78 - 65) / 65) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$. The absolute increase is $78 - 65 = 13$ mm. Since the increase is $\\ge 20\\%$ and $\\ge 5$ mm, this meets the RECIST $1.1$ criteria for Progressive Disease (PD) based on target lesions. Additionally, the appearance of two new lesions ($6$ mm and $5$ mm) independently qualifies as PD under RECIST $1.1$.\n    - **iRECIST Application**: Due to the use of immunotherapy, these findings are classified as **iUPD**. The patient is clinically stable, so per iRECIST guidelines, therapy should be continued pending a confirmatory scan.\n    - **Molecular Assessment**: The ctDNA VAF drops sharply from a baseline of $C_0 = 3.2\\%$ to $C_1 = 1.2\\%$. This represents a $(3.2 - 1.2) / 3.2 = 0.625$, or $62.5\\%$, reduction. A significant decline in ctDNA is a strong independent indicator of therapeutic response at the molecular level. This discordance between radiographic findings (apparent progression) and molecular findings (response) is a classic feature of pseudoprogression.\n\n- **At $t_2 = 12$ weeks (Confirmatory Assessment)**:\n    - **Radiographic Assessment**: The SOD has decreased to $S_2 = 60$ mm. This is a reduction from both the prior measurement ($S_1=78$ mm) and the baseline ($S_0=65$ mm). The new lesions have also shrunk to $5$ mm and $4$ mm. This radiographic improvement confirms that the findings at $t_1$ were not true progression. The iUPD is not confirmed.\n    - **Molecular Assessment**: The ctDNA VAF continues to fall to $C_2 = 0.6\\%$, reinforcing the evidence of a deep and ongoing biological response.\n    - **Conclusion**: The entire clinical, radiographic, and molecular picture is characteristic of pseudoprogression. The patient is deriving benefit from the PD-$1$ blockade.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. New lesions under iRECIST immediately establish immune-confirmed progressive disease. A decision rule that halts therapy at the first sign of any new lesion or a $\\ge 20\\%$ increase in target lesion sum minimizes risk and should classify the $t_1$ findings as true progression.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement fundamentally misrepresents iRECIST. New lesions establish immune *unconfirmed* progressive disease (iUPD), not iCPD. The decision rule described is precisely the RECIST $1.1$ standard that iRECIST was designed to modify for immunotherapy because it fails to account for pseudoprogression. Applying this rule would have incorrectly classified this patient as having true progression at $t_1$ and led to the cessation of effective therapy.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. New lesions under iRECIST establish immune unconfirmed progressive disease that requires radiographic confirmation. A decision rule that continues therapy in clinically stable patients if a confirmatory scan within $4$ to $8$ weeks shows no further increase meeting confirmation criteria and ctDNA declines by $\\ge 50\\%$ from baseline appropriately distinguishes pseudoprogression from true progression; this patient’s course is consistent with pseudoprogression.**\n- **Analysis**: This option accurately describes the iRECIST process for new lesions (iUPD requiring confirmation). It proposes an integrated decision rule combining the key elements of a modern approach: clinical stability, the iRECIST confirmation principle, and molecular monitoring with ctDNA. This rule correctly handles the patient's data: the patient was stable, the confirmatory scan was performed ($4$ weeks later), the scan did not confirm progression, and the ctDNA showed a profound drop ($>50\\%$) at the first assessment. The rule correctly distinguishes pseudoprogression and correctly classifies this patient's favorable outcome.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. New lesions under iRECIST can be disregarded when PD-L$1$ expression is $\\ge 50\\%$. A decision rule that classifies patients with high PD-L$1$ and high TMB as delayed responders regardless of imaging changes should classify this patient as pseudoprogression.**\n- **Analysis**: While high PD-L$1$ and TMB (this patient has both) are favorable predictive biomarkers, they are not absolute. True progression can still occur in such patients. A decision rule to \"disregard\" imaging changes based solely on baseline biomarkers is clinically unsafe and not supported by any established guidelines. Imaging remains a cornerstone of response assessment, and iRECIST provides a framework for interpreting it, not ignoring it. The reasoning is flawed, even if the final classification for this particular patient happens to be correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. New lesions under iRECIST are not part of progression assessment; only target lesion growth matters. A decision rule that defines true progression if any new lesion grows by $\\ge 5$ mm at the next assessment should classify the $t_2$ findings as true progression because a new lesion exceeds this threshold.**\n- **Analysis**: This option contains multiple falsehoods. First, new lesions are a critical component of iRECIST assessment, triggering iUPD. Second, the proposed rule for confirming progression (new lesion growth of $\\ge 5$ mm) is arbitrary and not part of the formal iRECIST criteria. Third, and most importantly, the factual premise is wrong. The new lesions in this patient *shrank* from $6$ mm and $5$ mm at $t_1$ to $5$ mm and $4$ mm at $t_2$. They did not grow at all. The option's conclusion is based on a misreading of the provided data.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
