            "introduction": "The first step in assessing a somatic variant is to accurately interpret its presence and abundance from sequencing data. The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is a key metric, but its value is heavily influenced by the sample's biological context, such as tumor purity and local copy number changes. This exercise  guides you through deriving the fundamental model that connects these variables to the expected VAF, providing the essential skills to avoid common pitfalls in data interpretation.",

            "problem": "A bulk tissue specimen is sequenced to assess somatic variants relevant to precision oncology. The sample contains a mixture of tumor and normal cells, where the tumor cell fraction (tumor purity) is $p$. At a genomic locus with tumor copy number $CN_{t}$ and normal (diploid) copy number $CN_{n}$, a clonal heterozygous somatic variant is present on $m$ mutated copies in every tumor cell and absent in normal cells. Assume unbiased sequencing without allelic amplification bias, and that the expected read fraction equals the underlying allele fraction at the locus in the mixture.\n\nStarting from core definitions of allele counts contributed by tumor and normal compartments and the definition of variant allele fraction (VAF), derive the expected expression for the variant allele fraction as a function of $p$, $CN_{t}$, $CN_{n}$, and $m$. Then, compute the expected variant allele fraction for $p=0.4$, $CN_{t}=2$, $CN_{n}=2$, and $m=1$. Express the result as a decimal or a fraction (no percentage sign).\n\nFinally, reason about the implications of this expected value for actionability classification thresholds in clinical genomics pipelines that use a raw VAF threshold $\\theta$ to flag variants for potential clinical action, in light of the dependence of the expected VAF on $p$ and $CN_{t}$. No numerical result is required for this discussion. The numerical answer must be the expected variant allele fraction and must be a single real-valued number or a single closed-form expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the variant allele fraction (VAF) in a mixed tumor-normal sample, a subsequent calculation for a specific case, and a discussion of the clinical implications.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   $p$: tumor cell fraction (tumor purity).\n-   $CN_{t}$: tumor copy number at the genomic locus.\n-   $CN_{n}$: normal (diploid) copy number at the genomic locus. Given as diploid, so $CN_{n}=2$.\n-   $m$: number of mutated copies in every tumor cell.\n-   The variant is clonal and somatic.\n-   Assumptions: unbiased sequencing, no allelic amplification bias, expected read fraction equals the underlying allele fraction.\n-   Numerical values for calculation: $p=0.4$, $CN_{t}=2$, $CN_{n}=2$, $m=1$.\n-   Final task includes a discussion on the implications for actionability classification thresholds, $\\theta$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing a standard and fundamental model in cancer genomics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary variables and assumptions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and the given numerical values are realistic. It represents a standard, non-trivial reasoning task in bioinformatics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe variant allele fraction, denoted as $VAF$, is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads at a specific locus that carry the variant allele. Under the assumption that read fraction equals the underlying allele fraction, the $VAF$ can be calculated as the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of all alleles at that locus in the tissue sample.\n\nThe sample is a mixture of two populations: tumor cells, which constitute a fraction $p$ of the total cells, and normal cells, which constitute the remaining fraction $(1-p)$. We can model the total and variant allele counts by summing the contributions from each population.\n\nLet's calculate the numerator of the $VAF$ expression: the total number of variant alleles.\nThe variant is somatic, meaning it is present only in the tumor cells. Normal cells do not carry the variant. In each tumor cell, there are $m$ copies of the variant allele.\nThe contribution to variant alleles from the tumor cell fraction $p$ is proportional to $p \\times m$.\nThe contribution from the normal cell fraction $(1-p)$ is $0$.\nThus, the total number of variant alleles in the mixture is proportional to $p \\cdot m$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the denominator: the total number of alleles (both variant and wild-type) at the locus.\nEach tumor cell has a total copy number of $CN_{t}$ at this locus. The contribution to the total allele count from the tumor cell fraction $p$ is proportional to $p \\times CN_{t}$.\nEach normal cell is diploid, with a copy number of $CN_{n}$. The problem specifies $CN_{n}=2$. The contribution to the total allele count from the normal cell fraction $(1-p)$ is proportional to $(1-p) \\times CN_{n}$.\nThe total number of alleles in the mixture is the sum of contributions from both cell types, proportional to $p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}$.\n\nCombining the numerator and the denominator, we derive the general expression for the expected $VAF$:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\cdot m}{p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}} $$\nThis is the required general formula.\n\nNow, we compute the expected $VAF$ for the specific case provided:\n-   Tumor purity $p = 0.4$\n-   Tumor copy number $CN_{t} = 2$\n-   Normal copy number $CN_{n} = 2$\n-   Mutated copies in tumor cells $m = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4 \\times 1}{(0.4 \\times 2) + (1 - 0.4) \\times 2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{0.8 + (0.6) \\times 2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{0.8 + 1.2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{2.0} $$\n$$ VAF = 0.2 $$\n\nThe expected variant allele fraction for this case is $0.2$, or $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nFinally, we reason about the implications of this model for clinical genomics pipelines. The derived formula, $VAF = \\frac{p \\cdot m}{p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}}$, demonstrates that the expected $VAF$ of a clonal somatic variant is not a fixed constant. Instead, it is a function of both the tumor purity ($p$) and the locus-specific copy number in the tumor ($CN_{t}$) and normal tissue ($CN_{n}$).\n\nA clinical genomics pipeline that uses a simple, fixed $VAF$ threshold, $\\theta$, to identify potentially actionable variants is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  **False Negatives**: A sample with low tumor purity ($p$) will exhibit a proportionally lower $VAF$ for a clonal variant. For instance, in a copy-neutral region ($CN_{t}=CN_{n}=2$), the expected $VAF$ for a clonal heterozygous mutation ($m=1$) simplifies to $VAF = p/2$. If a pipeline uses a threshold of $\\theta = 0.05$, a true clonal driver mutation in a sample with $p=0.08$ would have an expected $VAF$ of $0.04$ and would be missed. This is a critical issue as many clinical specimens have low to moderate purity.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Clonality**: The $VAF$ is also modulated by copy number alterations. A copy number loss of the wild-type allele (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) in tumor cells can elevate the $VAF$. For example, if $p=0.4$, $CN_{n}=2$, but the tumor has LOH such that $CN_{t}=1$ and $m=1$, the expected $VAF$ becomes $VAF = \\frac{0.4 \\times 1}{(0.4 \\times 1) + (0.6 \\times 2)} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4 + 1.2} = \\frac{0.4}{1.6} = 0.25$. This value is significantly higher than the $0.2$ calculated for the copy-neutral state. Conversely, copy number gains can also alter the expected $VAF$.\n\nTherefore, interpreting an observed $VAF$ value in isolation is insufficient and can be misleading. A robust actionability assessment requires integrating information from multiple sources. An advanced pipeline should first estimate the global tumor purity $p$ (e.g., from the full distribution of somatic variant VAFs) and the locus-specific copy number $CN_{t}$ (from sequencing read depth). With these estimates, the pipeline can calculate the *expected* $VAF$ for a clonal variant at any given genomic locus. The observed $VAF$ can then be compared to this context-specific expectation to more accurately determine the variant's clonality (clonal vs. subclonal) and to avoid incorrectly filtering out true positive variants in low-purity or copy-altered samples. Reliance on a raw, fixed $VAF$ threshold $\\theta$ compromises the sensitivity and specificity of somatic variant detection and classification.",

The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It relies on established principles of Bayesian inference and standard statistical models (Gaussian distribution) applied to a realistic scenario in clinical genomics. All necessary parameters are provided, and the questions are unambiguous.\n\nThe overall goal is to compute an \"adjusted actionability confidence\" by integrating the uncertainty of a variant's presence with the clinical evidence for its therapeutic benefit. This will be done in three main steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I will derive the Bayes factor ($BF$). This requires defining two mutually exclusive hypotheses:\n- $H_1$: The somatic variant is truly present.\n- $H_0$: The somatic variant is truly absent.\n\nThe problem states that the measurement error for the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. The probability density function (PDF) for a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$f(y; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nThe likelihood of observing a VAF measurement of $x$ depends on which hypothesis is true.\nUnder hypothesis $H_1$, the true mean VAF is $v = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$.

The problem gives $p_c = P(C|V) = 6.5 \\times 10^{-1}$, which is the probability of actionability conditional on the variant being present.\nThe adjusted actionability confidence is the joint probability that the variant is both present AND actionable, given our measurement $x$. We seek to calculate $P(V \\cap C | x)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (the chain rule):\n$$P(V \\cap C | x) = P(C|V, x) P(V|x)$$\nThe problem states that the clinical evidence synthesis is \"independent of analytic detection.\" This is a crucial assumption, which implies that the observation $x$ provides no new information about the clinical actionability of the variant if we already know the variant is present. In formal terms, $P(C|V, x) = P(C|V) = p_c$.\nTherefore, the integration is a simple multiplication:\n$$\\text{Adjusted Actionability Confidence} = P(C|V) P(V|x) = p_c \\times p_{post}$$\nSubstituting the expressions and values:\n$$\\text{Adjusted Actionability Confidence} = p_c \\times \\frac{\\exp(3.375)}{19 + \\exp(3.375)}$$\nNow, I will compute the final numerical value.\n$$ \\exp(3.375) \\approx 29.223006 $$\n$$ p_{post} \\approx \\frac{29.223006}{19 + 29.223006} = \\frac{29.223006}{48.223006} \\approx 0.605995 $$\nFinally, multiply by the clinical probability $p_c = 0.65$:\n$$\\text{Adjusted Actionability Confidence} \\approx 0.65 \\times 0.605995 \\approx 0.39389675$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $0.3939$.",
