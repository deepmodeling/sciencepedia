The patient’s genotype indicates nonfunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 alleles consistent with a cytochrome P450 2D6 poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. Consider a drug administered as a single intravenous bolus dose to avoid confounding by absorption, where elimination is exclusively through metabolic clearance pathways.

The role of Cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, in drug metabolism and the impact of genetic polymorphisms (e.g., PM phenotype) on drug exposure (measured by AUC) are fundamental concepts in precision medicine.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined, with all necessary parameters and relationships provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The question asks for a specific, calculable quantity (fold increase in AUC).\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and objective, using standard scientific terminology.\n- **Complete and Consistent:** The assumptions provided (linear pharmacokinetics, no change in other pathways) are explicit and create a self-contained, solvable system without contradictions. The assumption that $CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} \\approx 0$ for a PM with nonfunctional alleles is a standard and valid approximation in this context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe objective is to determine the fold increase in the Area Under the Curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}$) in a poor metabolizer (PM) relative to an extensive metabolizer (EM). This quantity is the ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{EM}}}$.\n\nThe relationship between dose ($D$), total clearance ($CL_{\\mathrm{total}}$), and $\\mathrm{AUC}$ is given as:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{D}{CL_{\\mathrm{total}}} $$\n\nSince the dose $D$ is administered as a single IV bolus and is assumed to be the same for both phenotype scenarios, the ratio of AUCs can be expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{EM}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{D}{CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{D}{CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}}\\right)} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}}} $$\nHere, $CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}$ is the total clearance in an extensive metabolizer, and $CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}}$ is the total clearance in a poor metabolizer.\n\nThe total drug clearance is the sum of the clearances through all metabolic pathways. We can partition the total clearance in the EM into the component mediated by CYP2D6 ($CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, EM}}$) and the component mediated by all other pathways ($CL_{\\mathrm{other}}$):\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} = CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, EM}} + CL_{\\mathrm{other}} $$\n\nThe fraction of drug metabolized by CYP2D6 in the EM is given as $f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} = 0.9$. By definition:\n$$ f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, EM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}} $$\nFrom this, we can express the CYP2D6-mediated clearance in the EM as:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, EM}} = f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} $$\n\nThe clearance via other pathways, $CL_{\\mathrm{other}}$, can then be expressed in terms of the total clearance and $f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{other}} = CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} - CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, EM}} = CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} - (f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}) $$\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{other}} = (1 - f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}}) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} $$\n\nNow, we must define the total clearance in the PM patient. The problem states that for a PM, the CYP2D6 pathway is nonfunctional, so $CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, PM}} \\approx 0$. It is also assumed that there are no compensatory changes in other elimination pathways. Therefore, the clearance via other pathways is the same in the PM as in the EM. The total clearance in the PM is:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}} = CL_{\\mathrm{CYP2D6, PM}} + CL_{\\mathrm{other}} \\approx 0 + CL_{\\mathrm{other}} = CL_{\\mathrm{other}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $CL_{\\mathrm{other}}$ from the EM case:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}} = (1 - f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}}) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}} $$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fold increase in AUC by substituting this expression for $CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}}$ into our ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{EM}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{total, PM}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}}{(1 - f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}}) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}} $$\nThe term $CL_{\\mathrm{total, EM}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the general relationship:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{EM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}}} $$\n\nPlugging in the given value $f_m^{\\mathrm{CYP2D6}} = 0.9$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{EM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.9} = \\frac{1}{0.1} = 10 $$\n\nThus, the expected fold increase in AUC in the cytochrome P450 2D6 poor metabolizer relative to the extensive metabolizer is $10$.",

This leads to two distinct possibilities for the patient's genotype.\n\n**Scenario 1: The `CYP2D6 *4` haplotype is duplicated.**\n-   The genotype would be `CYP2D6 *4x2/*10`.\n-   This means the patient possesses two copies of the `*4` allele and one copy of the `*10` allele.\n-   The activity value for `CYP2D6 *4` is `$0$`.\n-   The activity value for `CYP2D6 *10` is `$0.25$`.\n-   The total Activity Score (AS) is the sum of the values from all three gene copies:\n    $$AS_1 = (\\text{activity of } *4) + (\\text{activity of } *4) + (\\text{activity of } *10) = 0 + 0 + 0.25 = 0.25$$\n-   According to the CPIC phenotype bins, an AS of `$0.25$` falls into the range `$[0.25, 1.0]`, which corresponds to an **intermediate metabolizer** phenotype.\n\n**Scenario 2: The `CYP2D6 *10` haplotype is duplicated.**\n-   The genotype would be `CYP2D6 *4/*10x2`.\n-   This means the patient possesses one copy of the `*4` allele and two copies of the `*10` allele.\n-   The total Activity Score (AS) is the sum of the values from all three gene copies:\n    $$AS_2 = (\\text{activity of } *4) + (\\text{activity of } *10) + (\\text{activity of } *10) = 0 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5$$\n-   According to the CPIC phenotype bins, an AS of `$0.5$` also falls into the range `$[0.25, 1.0]`, which corresponds to an **intermediate metabolizer** phenotype.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n-   The possible activity scores for this patient are `$0.25$` and `$0.5$`. The full range of possible AS is `$[0.25, 0.5]`.\n-   In both possible scenarios, the resulting phenotype is \"intermediate metabolizer\". The clinical classification is therefore unambiguous, even though the exact AS is not.\n-   A conservative and complete clinical report should transparently state the existing ambiguity, the resulting range of possible activity scores, and the final, unambiguous phenotype. Recommending further, more expensive testing (like long-read sequencing or ddPCR) to resolve the phasing should be contextualized; since the phenotype category does not change, reflex testing is generally not required unless a specific clinical protocol differentiates dosing based on the exact AS value within the IM range.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Possible activity scores are in `$[0.25,0.5]$` depending on whether the duplication is on CYP2D6 `*4` or CYP2D6 `*10`, with phenotype remaining intermediate metabolizer in either case. Report as “CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (AS $0.25$ to $0.5$)” with a comment that phasing uncertainty does not alter the phenotype; consider reflex long-read sequencing or droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) only if drug selection or dosing would hinge on the exact AS.**\n-   This option correctly identifies the range of possible activity scores as `$[0.25, 0.5]$`.\n-   It correctly concludes that the phenotype is \"intermediate metabolizer\" in both scenarios.\n-   The proposed reporting strategy is excellent: it is transparent about the ambiguity (AS `$0.25$` to `$0.5$`), correctly states the final phenotype, and provides a nuanced, clinically appropriate recommendation regarding further testing. This represents best practice.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Possible activity scores are in `$[0,0.5]$` because a duplication of CYP2D6 `*4` yields AS `$0$`. Report as “poor to intermediate metabolizer” and always perform reflex long-read sequencing to resolve phase.**\n-   This option incorrectly calculates the AS for the `*4` duplication scenario. The genotype `*4x2/*10` results in an AS of `$0+0+0.25 = 0.25$`, not `$0$`. The calculation neglects the contribution of the `*10` allele.\n-   Consequently, the AS range of `$[0, 0.5]$` is incorrect; the minimum possible AS is `$0.25$`.\n-   The phenotype range of \"poor to intermediate\" is incorrect because a \"poor metabolizer\" phenotype (AS = `$0$`) is not a possible outcome.\n-   The recommendation to \"always perform reflex... sequencing\" is overly aggressive and not cost-effective, especially given that the phenotype category is unchanged by the ambiguity.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The activity score is fixed at `$0.5$` because the duplication must involve the decreased-function haplotype. Report as “intermediate metabolizer” without mentioning phasing uncertainty.**\n-   This option makes an unsubstantiated assumption that the duplication \"must involve the decreased-function haplotype\". The problem explicitly states the phasing is unresolved, meaning either allele could be duplicated. This contradicts the given information.\n-   Reporting \"without mentioning phasing uncertainty\" is clinically irresponsible and violates the principles of transparent and accurate reporting of laboratory results.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Possible activity scores are in `$[0.5,1.0]$`, so the phenotype could range from intermediate to normal metabolizer. Report as “indeterminate between intermediate and normal” and recommend reflex sequencing in all cases.**\n-   This option incorrectly calculates the range of activity scores. As derived, the range is `$[0.25, 0.5]$`, not `$[0.5, 1.0]$`. An AS of `$1.0$` is not a possible outcome for this genotype.\n-   Because the AS range is incorrect, the conclusion that the phenotype could be \"normal metabolizer\" is also incorrect. The AS never reaches the threshold of `$1.25$` for a normal metabolizer.\n-   The phenotype is not \"indeterminate between intermediate and normal\"; it is definitively \"intermediate\".\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
