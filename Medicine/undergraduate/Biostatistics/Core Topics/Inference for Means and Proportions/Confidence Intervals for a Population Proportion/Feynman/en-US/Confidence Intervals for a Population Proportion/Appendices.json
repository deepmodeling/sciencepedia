This exercise reverses the usual process; instead of building an interval from data, you will dissect a given interval to find its core components: the point estimate and the margin of error. This practice reinforces the fundamental symmetric structure of the standard confidence interval, $\\hat{p} \\pm E$, and clarifies how the sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$, serves as the interval's center while the margin of error, $E$, defines its width.",

The team randomly samples a large number of freshly produced circuit boards and inspects them for soldering defects. After analyzing the sample data, they construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion, $p$, of all circuit boards produced with this new technique that have at least one soldering defect. The resulting confidence interval is given as $(0.075, 0.125)$.\n\nBased on this information, determine the sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$, of defective circuit boards observed in their sample, and the margin of error, $E$, used to construct this interval. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(\\hat{p}, E)$.",

Before collecting any data, we can determine the necessary sample size to achieve a desired level of precision and confidence.

A key feature of the app relies on understanding the proportion of residents who use public transportation as their primary mode of commuting.

The team wants to have a 90% level of confidence in their results. Since this is the first study of its kind in the city, there is no prior information available to estimate the population proportion.\n\nWhat is the minimum integer sample size required to meet these specifications?",

This advanced problem explores a critical boundary case—observing zero events in a sample—to dramatically illustrate the limitations of this standard method. By comparing the flawed Wald interval to a theoretically sound \"exact\" interval (the Clopper-Pearson method), you will gain a deeper appreciation for the assumptions underlying statistical formulas and the importance of choosing the right tool for the job, especially when dealing with rare events .",

Out of $n=40$ consecutively enrolled participants, $x=0$ experienced the event. Let $p$ denote the true population proportion of participants who would experience the adverse event if treated similarly. Assume a Binomial sampling model for the count of events.\n\nStarting from the Binomial model and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that suitably scaled sums of independent, identically distributed random variables converge in distribution to a normal distribution, derive a two-sided large-sample confidence interval at level $1-\\alpha$ for $p$ based on the sample proportion $\\hat{p}=x/n$.

Identify the upper endpoint explicitly as a function of $\\alpha$ and $n$.\n\nTo quantify the pathological behavior of the large-sample (Wald) interval relative to the exact interval in this boundary case, compute the difference between the upper endpoints of the exact interval and the Wald interval, and provide this single value as your final answer. Use $\\alpha=0.05$. Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "This problem requires the derivation and comparison of two types of confidence intervals for a population proportion $p$ when the observed number of events is $x=0$ in a sample of size $n$.\n\n**1. Wald Large-Sample Interval**\n\nFirst, we consider the large-sample interval based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), commonly known as the Wald-type confidence interval. A two-sided confidence interval for $p$ at level $1-\\alpha$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{p} = x/n$ is the sample proportion and $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution (e.g., $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$ for a 95% confidence level).\n\nFor the given data, $n=40$ and $x=0$, the sample proportion is $\\hat{p} = 0/40 = 0$. Substituting $\\hat{p}=0$ into the interval formula gives:\n$$\n0 \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{0(1-0)}{40}} = 0 \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{0} = [0, 0]\n$$\nThe Wald interval collapses to a single point, $[0, 0]$, an interval of zero width. This is a known pathological behavior, as it suggests with undue certainty that the true proportion $p$ is exactly 0. The upper endpoint of the Wald interval is therefore $p_{U, \\text{Wald}} = 0$.\n\n**2. Exact (Clopper-Pearson) Interval**\n\nNext, we derive the exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for the case $x=0$. This interval is constructed by inverting an equal-tailed hypothesis test based on the Binomial distribution, where $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$. The upper endpoint, $p_U$, is the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing a result as low as or lower than $x=0$ is $\\alpha/2$. We must solve:\n$$\nP(X \\le 0 | p=p_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\nSince the number of events $X$ cannot be negative, $P(X \\le 0)$ is the same as $P(X=0)$. The probability mass function for a Binomial distribution gives $P(X=0) = \\binom{n}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{n-0} = (1-p)^n$. So, we set:\n$$\n(1-p_U)^n = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $p_U$:\n$$\n1-p_U = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\n$$\np_U = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the upper endpoint of the exact interval, $p_{U, \\text{Exact}}$. By convention, the lower endpoint when $x=0$ is $p_L = 0$.\n\n**3. Difference in Upper Endpoints**\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference between the upper endpoints of the exact and Wald intervals for $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $n=40$.\n$$\n\\Delta = p_{U, \\text{Exact}} - p_{U, \\text{Wald}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\right) - 0\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0.05}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{40}} = 1 - (0.025)^{\\frac{1}{40}}\n$$\nThis provides the requested closed-form analytic expression for the difference.",
