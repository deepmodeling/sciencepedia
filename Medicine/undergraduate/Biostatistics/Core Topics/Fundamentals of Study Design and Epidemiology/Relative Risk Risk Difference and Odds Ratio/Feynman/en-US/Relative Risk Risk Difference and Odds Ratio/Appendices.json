            "problem": "A prospective cohort study investigates whether occupational exposure to a solvent is associated with the development of contact dermatitis over one year. Among the exposed workers, there are $a=48$ cases of dermatitis and $b=152$ non-cases, for a total of $a+b=200$. Among the unexposed workers, there are $c=30$ cases and $d=270$ non-cases, for a total of $c+d=300$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the estimated relative risk ($\\widehat{RR}$), risk difference ($\\widehat{RD}$), and odds ratio ($\\widehat{OR}$) from the provided sample data of a prospective cohort study. The derivation must proceed from the foundational definitions of risk and odds.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Exposed group: $a=48$ cases (dermatitis), $b=152$ non-cases. The total number of exposed workers is $N_1 = a+b = 48+152 = 200$.\n- Unexposed group: $c=30$ cases, $d=270$ non-cases.

            "problem": "In a randomized trial evaluating a prophylactic intervention for a rare binary outcome (infection), consider two subpopulations that differ only in baseline risk under control. Let the baseline risks be $p_{0,\\text{small}} = 0.01$ and $p_{0,\\text{moderate}} = 0.20$. Suppose the intervention has the same causal odds ratio (OR) across subpopulations, with $\\theta = 4$, meaning the post-treatment odds equal $\\theta$ times the control odds within each subpopulation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a ratio of risk differences derived from a constant odds ratio applied to two subpopulations with different baseline risks. First, the problem statement must be validated for soundness and completeness.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Two subpopulations: \"small\" and \"moderate\" baseline risk.\n- Baseline risk for the small subpopulation: $p_{0,\\text{small}} = 0.01$.\n- Baseline risk for the moderate subpopulation: $p_{0,\\text{moderate}} = 0.20$.\n- A constant causal odds ratio (OR) across subpopulations: $\\theta = 4$.\n- Definition of odds for a risk $p$: $\\text{odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\n- Definition of Odds Ratio (OR): Ratio of odds under treatment to odds under control.

The assumption of a constant odds ratio is a standard modeling choice (e.g., in logistic regression) used to explore how effect measures can vary across different scales. The value $\\theta = 4$ for an intervention labeled \"prophylactic\" implies the intervention is harmful, as it increases the odds of the adverse outcome. While this is counterintuitive for a measure intended to be prophylactic, it does not represent a scientific or mathematical contradiction. It presents a valid setup to explore the mathematical relationships between effect measures.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. All necessary numerical values ($p_{0,\\text{small}}$, $p_{0,\\text{moderate}}$, $\\theta$) and definitions are provided to compute the required quantities. The instructions are unambiguous and lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. No information is missing or contradictory.\n- **Other criteria**: The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, ill-posed, or unverifiable. It is a standard exercise in biostatistical reasoning that correctly illustrates the concept of effect measure modification.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed as requested.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires starting from fundamental definitions. We first derive a general expression for the treated risk, $p_1$, as a function of the control risk, $p_0$, and the odds ratio, $\\theta$.\n\nLet $O_0$ be the odds of the outcome in the control group and $O_1$ be the odds in the treated group. By definition, the odds in the control group are:\n$$ O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} $$\nThe odds ratio, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the treated odds to the control odds:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} $$\nTherefore, the odds in the treated group are:\n$$ O_1 = \\theta \\cdot O_0 = \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} $$\nThe odds in the treated group can also be expressed in terms of the treated risk, $p_1$:\n$$ O_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $O_1$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} = \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $p_1$:\n$$ p_1 = \\left( \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} \\right) (1-p_1) $$\n$$ p_1 = \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} - p_1 \\left( \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} \\right) $$\n$$ p_1 \\left( 1 + \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} \\right) = \\theta \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} $$\nTo simplify, multiply both sides of the equation by $(1-p_0)$:\n$$ p_1 \\left( (1-p_0) + \\theta p_0 \\right) = \\theta p_0 $$\nThis yields the general formula for the treated risk:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{\\theta p_0}{1 - p_0 + \\theta p_0} $$\nThis formula allows us to compute the treated risk for any given control risk and odds ratio.\n\n**Calculations for the \"small\" Subpopulation**\nGiven $p_{0,\\text{small}} = 0.01$ and $\\theta = 4$.\nThe treated risk, $p_{1,\\text{small}}$, is:\n$$ p_{1,\\text{small}} = \\frac{4 \\times 0.01}{1 - 0.01 + 4 \\times 0.01} = \\frac{0.04}{0.99 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.04}{1.03} $$\nThe risk difference for this subpopulation is:\n$$ RD_{\\text{small}} = p_{1,\\text{small}} - p_{0,\\text{small}} = \\frac{0.04}{1.03} - 0.01 $$\nTo combine terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ RD_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{0.04 - 0.01 \\times 1.03}{1.03} = \\frac{0.04 - 0.0103}{1.03} = \\frac{0.0297}{1.03} $$\n\n**Calculations for the \"moderate\" Subpopulation**\nGiven $p_{0,\\text{moderate}} = 0.20$ and $\\theta = 4$.\nThe treated risk, $p_{1,\\text{moderate}}$, is:\n$$ p_{1,\\text{moderate}} = \\frac{4 \\times 0.20}{1 - 0.20 + 4 \\times 0.20} = \\frac{0.80}{0.80 + 0.80} = \\frac{0.80}{1.60} = 0.5 $$\nThe risk difference for this subpopulation is:\n$$ RD_{\\text{moderate}} = p_{1,\\text{moderate}} - p_{0,\\text{moderate}} = 0.5 - 0.20 = 0.30 $$\n\n**Final Ratio Calculation**\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{RD_{\\text{small}}}{RD_{\\text{moderate}}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{0.0297}{1.03}}{0.30} = \\frac{0.0297}{1.03 \\times 0.30} = \\frac{0.0297}{0.309} $$\nNow we perform the final division:\n$$ R \\approx 0.09611650485... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $6$, $1$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ R \\approx 0.09612 $$\nThis result demonstrates that a constant effect on one scale (the odds ratio scale) translates to different effects on another scale (the risk difference scale), depending on the baseline risk of the population.",

It presents a standard scenario for comparing measures of association in an epidemiological context.\n\nLet $p_0$ be the probability of the outcome in the unexposed group (baseline risk) and $p_1$ be the probability of the outcome in the exposed group. The problem provides the following values:\n$p_0 = 0.12$\n$p_1 = 0.60$\n\nWe begin by stating the fundamental definitions of the quantities involved.\nThe risk, $R$, is the probability of the outcome.\nRisk in the unexposed group: $R_0 = p_0$.\nRisk in the exposed group: $R_1 = p_1$.\n\nThe odds, $O$, are defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n$O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\nOdds in the unexposed group: $O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}$.\nOdds in the exposed group: $O_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}$.\n\nFrom these, we define the three primary measures of association.\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$$\n\nThe Risk Difference ($RD$) is the absolute difference in risk between the two groups.\n$$RD = R_1 - R_0 = p_1 - p_0$$\n\nThe Odds Ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group.\n$$OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} = \\frac{p_1 / (1-p_1)}{p_0 / (1-p_0)}$$\n\nThe problem requires constructing a counterexample to demonstrate that the $OR$ can significantly exceed the $RR$ even when the baseline risk $p_0$ is moderately small. We use the provided values for this purpose.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $RR$ and $RD$ for the given scenario.\n$$RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\frac{0.60}{0.12} = 5$$\n$$RD = p_1 - p_0 = 0.60 - 0.12 = 0.48$$\nThe relative risk of $5$ indicates a strong association between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nNext, we calculate the $OR$.\n$$OR = \\frac{0.60 / (1-0.60)}{0.12 / (1-0.12)} = \\frac{0.60 / 0.40}{0.12 / 0.88} = \\frac{1.5}{0.13636...} = 11$$\nTo find the exact value, we work with fractions:\n$$OR = \\frac{60/100 / 40/100}{12/100 / 88/100} = \\frac{60/40}{12/88} = \\frac{3/2}{3/22} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{22}{3} = 11$$\n\nIn this case, the $OR$ is $11$ while the $RR$ is $5$. The $OR$ is more than double the $RR$, which serves as the required demonstration. The baseline risk $p_0 = 0.12$ ($12\\%$) can be considered moderately small, yet the discrepancy between $OR$ and $RR$ is substantial. This refutes the overly simplistic application of the \"rare disease assumption,\" which posits that $OR \\approx RR$ only when the outcome is rare (i.e., $p_0$ and $p_1$ are very close to $0$).\n\nNow, we analyze the relationship between $OR$ and $RR$ to explain the role of $RD$. Let us rearrange the formula for the $OR$:\n$$OR = \\frac{p_1 / (1-p_1)}{p_0 / (1-p_0)} = \\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}\\right)$$\nSince $RR = p_1/p_0$, we have:\n$$OR = RR \\times \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$$\nThis equation reveals that the $OR$ is the $RR$ multiplied by a correction factor, $\\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$. The common approximation $OR \\approx RR$ is valid only when this factor is close to $1$. This occurs when $1-p_0 \\approx 1-p_1$, which means $p_0 \\approx p_1$. However, a more common condition for the approximation is when both $p_0$ and $p_1$ are small, such that $1-p_0 \\approx 1$ and $1-p_1 \\approx 1$.\n\nIn our scenario, $p_0$ is smallish ($0.12$) but $p_1$ is large ($0.60$). The largeness of $p_1$ is what drives the discrepancy. The term $(1-p_1)$ in the denominator of the correction factor becomes small, inflating the value of the factor and thus the $OR$.\n\nThe role of the Risk Difference ($RD$) can be seen by substituting $p_1 = p_0 + RD$ into the correction factor:\n$$\\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1} = \\frac{1-p_0}{1-(p_0 + RD)} = \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_0-RD}$$\nThis form elucidates the contribution of $RD$. For a fixed baseline risk $p_0$, as the Risk Difference $RD$ increases, the denominator $(1-p_0-RD)$ decreases. A smaller denominator leads to a larger $OR/RR$ ratio, magnifying the difference between the $OR$ and $RR$. In our case, the $RD$ is large ($0.48$), meaning the exposure has a large absolute effect on risk. This large $RD$ drives $p_1$ to a high value ($0.60$), which in turn causes the term $(1-p_1)$ to be small ($0.40$). It is this large effect size, quantified by $RD$, that ultimately causes the significant overestimation of $RR$ by $OR$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required scalar quantity $OR/RR$.\n$$\\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{1 - 0.12}{1 - 0.60} = \\frac{0.88}{0.40}$$\nTo express this as an exact value:\n$$\\frac{0.88}{0.40} = \\frac{88}{40} = \\frac{11 \\times 8}{5 \\times 8} = \\frac{11}{5} = 2.2$$\nThe $OR$ is exactly $2.2$ times the $RR$ in this scenario.",
