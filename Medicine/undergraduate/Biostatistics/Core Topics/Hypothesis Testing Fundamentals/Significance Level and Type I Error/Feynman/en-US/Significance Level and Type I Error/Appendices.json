            "introduction": "The significance level, denoted by $\\alpha$, is a cornerstone of hypothesis testing, representing the probability of committing a Type I error—incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis. This exercise provides a foundational workout in calculating $\\alpha$ directly from a test's rejection region. By working with an asymmetric rejection region, you will see how the costs associated with different types of errors can influence test design, moving beyond the simple symmetric tests often seen in introductory examples .",

            "problem": "In a high-precision manufacturing process for optical lenses, the deviation of the focal length from its target specification is a critical quality parameter. Let $\\mu$ be the true mean deviation for a production batch. The null hypothesis, $H_0: \\mu=0$, signifies that the process is perfectly calibrated. From each batch, a sample is drawn and a test statistic $Z$ is computed. Under the null hypothesis, $Z$ is known to follow a standard normal distribution.\n\nDue to differing economic impacts, the tolerance for negative deviations (lenses with shorter focal lengths) is much stricter than for positive deviations. Consequently, the quality control protocol specifies an asymmetric rejection region. The production process is halted and the batch is rejected if the test statistic $Z$ is less than $-2.33$ or greater than $1.645$.\n\nYou are given that for a standard normal random variable $Z$, the cumulative distribution function values are $\\Phi(-2.33) = P(Z \\le -2.33) = 0.009903$ and $\\Phi(1.645) = P(Z \\le 1.645) = 0.950000$.\n\nCalculate the significance level, $\\alpha$, of this hypothesis test. Round your final answer to four significant figures.",

By definition, the significance level is the probability of rejecting $H_{0}$ when it is true:\n$$\n\\alpha = P(Z < -2.33 \\text{ or } Z > 1.645 \\mid H_{0}).\n$$\nSince the two regions are disjoint and $Z$ is standard normal under $H_{0}$, this becomes\n$$\n\\alpha = P(Z < -2.33) + P(Z > 1.645).\n$$\nUsing the cumulative distribution function $\\Phi$ of the standard normal, we have\n$$\nP(Z < -2.33) = \\Phi(-2.33), \\quad P(Z > 1.645) = 1 - \\Phi(1.645).\n$$\nWith the given values,\n$$\n\\alpha = \\Phi(-2.33) + \\left(1 - \\Phi(1.645)\\right) = 0.009903 + (1 - 0.950000).\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\alpha = 0.009903 + 0.050000 = 0.059903.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields\n$$\n\\alpha = 0.05990.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Once an experiment is complete, we are left with a p-value, which quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. The practical application of the significance level $\\alpha$ is to serve as a pre-determined threshold for making a decision based on this p-value. This practice focuses on the crucial decision rule: if the p-value is less than or equal to $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$. You will explore how the same experimental result can lead to different conclusions depending on the chosen level of significance, a scenario common in fields like finance and clinical trials where the stakes of a decision vary .",

            "introduction": "In the previous exercises, the rejection region was either given or the decision was made using a p-value. However, a critical step in designing an experiment is to define the rejection region *before* data is collected, based on a desired significance level $\\alpha$. This practice challenges you to construct such a region for a test involving a discrete distribution . You will discover an important nuance of discrete tests: it is often impossible to achieve a conventional significance level like $0.05$ exactly, forcing us to find a region that keeps the Type I error rate as close as possible to our target without exceeding it.",
