            "problem": "A biostatistics research team is designing a one-sided hypothesis test for the mean concentration of a biomarker measured by a calibrated assay. For a single study arm, the observations are modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2$, written $X_i \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$. The scientific question is whether the true mean exceeds a clinically established reference $\\mu_0$. The team adopts the hypotheses $H_0:\\mu=\\mu_0$ versus $H_1:\\mu>\\mu_0$ and requires a test that has exact size $\\alpha$, where $0<\\alpha<1$ is prespecified.\n\nUsing only the following foundational facts:\n- If $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ are independent and identically distributed as $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ with known $\\sigma^2$, then the sample mean $\\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/n$.\n- For any real-valued constant $a$, if $Y\\sim N(\\mu_Y,\\sigma_Y^2)$, then $(Y-\\mu_Y)/\\sigma_Y$ has the standard normal distribution with cumulative distribution function $\\Phi$ and corresponding quantile function $\\Phi^{-1}$.\n\nDerive, from first principles, a rejection rule of exact size $\\alpha$ for testing $H_0:\\mu=\\mu_0$ versus $H_1:\\mu>\\mu_0$ expressed as a threshold on $\\overline{X}$, and then derive the power function $\\pi(\\mu)$, defined as $\\pi(\\mu)=\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu}(\\text{reject }H_0)$ as a function of the true mean $\\mu$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard, well-posed problem in introductory mathematical statistics and biostatistics. It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested quantities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe goal is to first derive a rejection rule of exact size $\\alpha$ for the one-sided hypothesis test $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$ versus $H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0$, and then to derive the power function $\\pi(\\mu)$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Rejection Rule**\n\nThe size of a test, denoted by $\\alpha$, is the probability of a Type I error. This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$ when it is, in fact, true. The problem requires this size to be exactly $\\alpha$.\nA rejection rule for the one-sided alternative $H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0$ will naturally be of the form \"reject $H_0$ if the sample mean $\\overline{X}$ is large\". We formalize this by defining a rejection region $\\mathcal{R} = \\{\\overline{X} > c\\}$, where $c$ is a critical value we must determine.\n\nThe size constraint is mathematically expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is true}) = \\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting our rejection rule and the condition for $H_0$ being true ($\\mu = \\mu_0$), we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu_0}(\\overline{X} > c) = \\alpha\n$$\nThe subscript $\\mu_0$ indicates that the probability is calculated under the distribution where the true mean is $\\mu_0$.\n\nAccording to the provided foundational facts, when the true mean is $\\mu_0$, the sample mean $\\overline{X}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu_0$ and variance $\\sigma^2/n$. That is, $\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\sigma^2/n)$.\n\nTo evaluate the probability and solve for $c$, we standardize the random variable $\\overline{X}$. Under $H_0$, the standardized statistic is:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThis statistic $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution, $N(0,1)$. We can transform the inequality $\\overline{X} > c$ into an equivalent inequality for $Z$:\n$$\n\\overline{X} > c \\quad \\iff \\quad \\overline{X} - \\mu_0 > c - \\mu_0 \\quad \\iff \\quad \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} > \\frac{c - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThus, the size constraint becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z > \\frac{c - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = \\alpha\n$$\nFor a standard normal variable $Z$ with cumulative distribution function (CDF) $\\Phi$, we know that $\\mathbb{P}(Z > k) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z \\le k) = 1 - \\Phi(k)$. The value $k$ for which this probability equals $\\alpha$ is a quantile of the standard normal distribution. Specifically, it is the upper $\\alpha$-quantile, which we can denote as $z_{\\alpha}$. This value is defined by the property $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\le z_{\\alpha}) = 1-\\alpha$. Using the provided quantile function notation $\\Phi^{-1}$, this is $z_{\\alpha} = \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)$.\n\nBy equating the argument of the probability with this quantile, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{c - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nWe now solve for the critical value $c$, which is the threshold on $\\overline{X}$:\n$$\nc = \\mu_0 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the answer. The rejection rule is to reject $H_0$ if a calculated sample mean $\\overline{X}$ is greater than this value $c$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Power Function**\n\nThe power of a test, $\\pi(\\mu)$, is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the true mean is $\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is a value specified by the alternative hypothesis (i.e., $\\mu > \\mu_0$). The power function is defined for any value of $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = \\mathbb{P}_{\\mu}(\\text{reject } H_0)\n$$\nUsing the rejection rule derived above, this becomes:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = \\mathbb{P}_{\\mu}\\left(\\overline{X} > \\mu_0 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we must consider the distribution of $\\overline{X}$ when the true mean is $\\mu$. From the given facts, this distribution is $\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)$. We standardize $\\overline{X}$ with respect to this true distribution:\n$$\nZ' = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim N(0,1)\n$$\nWe now re-express the inequality in our power calculation in terms of this new standard normal variable $Z'$.\n$$\n\\overline{X} > \\mu_0 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nSubtract $\\mu$ from both sides and divide by the standard error $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} > \\frac{\\left(\\mu_0 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\\right) - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThe left side is $Z'$. We simplify the right side:\n$$\nZ' > \\frac{\\mu_0 - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} + \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n$$\nZ' > \\frac{\\mu_0 - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\n$$\nThe power function is the probability of this event occurring:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z' > \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha) + \\frac{\\mu_0 - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z' > \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha) - \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property that for a standard normal variable $Z'$, $\\mathbb{P}(Z' > k) = 1 - \\Phi(k)$, we obtain the final expression for the power function:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha) - \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the second part of the answer, expressed solely in terms of the required parameters.\n\nThe final answer requires a composite expression for the critical value on $\\overline{X}$ and the power function $\\pi(\\mu)$.\nThe critical value is $c = \\mu_0 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha)$.\nThe power function is $\\pi(\\mu) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha) - \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$.",

The probability $P(Z > x) = 1-\\beta$ implies $x = -z_{\\beta}$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{c - \\mu_1}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = -z_{\\beta} $$\nThis gives our second equation relating $c$ and $n$:\n$$ c = \\mu_1 - z_{\\beta} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns, $n$ and $c$.

The data consists of a single observation $X$ from a Binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, with $n=5$.\n\nThe Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework is the foundation for this analysis. The NP lemma provides the most powerful test for simple hypotheses. For a simple null $H_0: p=p_0$ versus a simple alternative $H_1': p=p_1$ where $p_1 > p_0$, the most powerful test rejects $H_0$ for large values of the likelihood ratio, $\\frac{L(p_1|x)}{L(p_0|x)}$. The likelihood function for a binomial observation $X=x$ is given by its probability mass function (PMF):\n$$ L(p|x) = P(X=x; p) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} $$\nThe likelihood ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{L(p_1|x)}{L(p_0|x)} = \\frac{\\binom{n}{x} p_1^x (1-p_1)^{n-x}}{\\binom{n}{x} p_0^x (1-p_0)^{n-x}} = \\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\right)^x \\left(\\frac{1-p_1}{1-p_0}\\right)^{n-x} = \\left(\\frac{1-p_1}{1-p_0}\\right)^n \\left[ \\frac{p_1(1-p_0)}{p_0(1-p_1)} \\right]^x $$\nFor any $p_1 > p_0$, the term $\\frac{p_1(1-p_0)}{p_0(1-p_1)}$ is greater than $1$. Therefore, the likelihood ratio is a monotonically increasing function of the statistic $X$. This property is known as the monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) in the statistic $X$.

The cutoff for certain rejection is $c=5$, and the randomization probability at $X=c-1=4$ is $\\gamma=\\frac{11}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the integer cutoff $c$ and the randomization probability $\\gamma$.\n$c=5$\n$\\gamma=\\frac{11}{25}$",
