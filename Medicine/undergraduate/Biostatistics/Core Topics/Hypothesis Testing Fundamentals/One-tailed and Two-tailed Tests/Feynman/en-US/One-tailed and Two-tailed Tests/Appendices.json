This first exercise provides a foundational calculation of one- and two-tailed $p$-values from a given test statistic. By working directly with an observed $Z$-statistic from a large clinical trial, you will see how the framing of the research question—as a directional (superiority) or non-directional claim—directly impacts the resulting $p$-value and the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis . This practice reinforces the core definition of the $p$-value as a tail probability under a symmetric, continuous distribution.",

            "solution": "The problem is first assessed for validity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Parameter of Interest:** Mean difference in change from baseline systolic blood pressure, $\\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}$. Negative values indicate the new drug is more effective.\n- **Null Hypothesis ($H_{0}$):** $\\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}=0$.\n- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{1}$), one-sided:** $\\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}<0$ (superiority claim for the new drug).\n- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{1}$), two-sided:** $\\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}\\neq 0$.\n- **Test Statistic ($Z$):** Under $H_0$, the statistic is approximately standard normal, $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n- **Observed Test Statistic ($z_{\\text{obs}}$):** $z_{\\text{obs}}=2.1$.\n- **Coding Convention:** The test statistic is coded such that positive values indicate evidence for the superiority alternative, $H_{1}: \\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}<0$.\n- **Task:**\n    1. Compute the one-tailed $p$-value for the superiority hypothesis.\n    2. Compute the two-tailed $p$-value for the non-directional hypothesis.\n    3. Interpret the evidential strength for the superiority claim.\n    4. Report the two $p$-values rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of frequentist hypothesis testing, a cornerstone of biostatistics. The use of a Z-test for comparing means in a large sample is a standard and valid procedure.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. All necessary components are provided: the null and alternative hypotheses, the null distribution of the test statistic ($N(0,1)$), and the observed value of the statistic ($z_{\\text{obs}} = 2.1$). The coding convention, while not the most common, is explicitly and unambiguously defined, which removes any vagueness. This allows for a unique calculation of the required $p$-values.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, formal language typical of statistics and biostatistics, with no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information. The verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nA $p$-value is defined as the probability, under the null hypothesis ($H_0$), of obtaining a test statistic result at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed. The null hypothesis states that our test statistic, $Z$, follows a standard normal distribution, denoted as $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. The observed test statistic is given as $z_{\\text{obs}} = 2.1$.\n\n**1) Computation of the one-tailed $p$-value**\n\nThe one-tailed alternative hypothesis is the superiority claim, $H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}} < 0$. The problem explicitly states that the test statistic has been coded such that \"positive $z_{\\text{obs}}$ indicates evidence for the prespecified superiority direction.\" This means that the region of rejection for this one-tailed test lies in the upper tail of the standard normal distribution. Values of the test statistic that are greater than or equal to the observed value $z_{\\text{obs}}$ are considered \"at least as extreme\" in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the one-tailed $p$-value, which we denote as $p_{1}$, is the probability $P(Z \\ge z_{\\text{obs}})$ under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.\n$$p_{1} = P(Z \\ge 2.1 | H_0)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, defined as $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. The probability of being in the upper tail can be calculated as:\n$$p_{1} = 1 - P(Z  2.1) = 1 - \\Phi(2.1)$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or computational software for the standard normal CDF, we find that $\\Phi(2.1) \\approx 0.9821356$.\n$$p_{1} \\approx 1 - 0.9821356 = 0.0178644$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the one-tailed $p$-value is $0.01786$.\n\n**2) Computation of the two-tailed $p$-value**\n\nFor the two-tailed alternative hypothesis, $H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}} \\neq 0$, \"at least as extreme\" refers to observing a test statistic value as far from the null value ($0$) as $z_{\\text{obs}}$ is, but in either direction. This means we are interested in values of $Z$ such that $|Z| \\ge |z_{\\text{obs}}|$.\n\nThe two-tailed $p$-value, denoted as $p_{2}$, is:\n$$p_{2} = P(|Z| \\ge |2.1| | H_0) = P(Z \\ge 2.1 \\text{ or } Z \\le -2.1)$$\nSince the events $Z \\ge 2.1$ and $Z \\le -2.1$ are mutually exclusive, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$p_{2} = P(Z \\ge 2.1) + P(Z \\le -2.1)$$\nDue to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution about $0$, we have $P(Z \\le -z) = P(Z \\ge z)$ for any $z  0$. Thus, $P(Z \\le -2.1) = P(Z \\ge 2.1)$.\nThis simplifies the expression for the two-tailed $p$-value to:\n$$p_{2} = 2 \\times P(Z \\ge 2.1) = 2 \\times p_{1}$$\nUsing the unrounded value for $p_1$:\n$$p_{2} \\approx 2 \\times 0.0178644 = 0.0357288$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the two-tailed $p$-value is $0.03573$.\n\n**Interpretation of Evidential Strength**\n\nThe interpretation of the evidence for the superiority claim must be based on the pre-specified one-tailed hypothesis and its corresponding $p$-value, $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786$. In hypothesis testing, we compare the $p$-value to a pre-determined significance level, denoted $\\alpha$. Conventional values for $\\alpha$ are $0.05$ and $0.01$.\n- If we use a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, we find that $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786  0.05$. Under this convention, the result is statistically significant. We would reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ that the new drug is superior.\n- If we use a more stringent significance level of $\\alpha = 0.01$, we find that $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786  0.01$. Under this convention, the result is not statistically significant. We would fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n\nTherefore, the evidence for the new drug's superiority is statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level, but not at the more rigorous $\\alpha=0.01$ level. This indicates moderate evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the superiority claim. An interpretation from first principles is as follows: If the new drug truly had no effect compared to standard care ($H_0$ is true), the probability of observing a result at least as favorable to the new drug as the one obtained in this trial would be approximately $1.8\\%$. This is a rare event, suggesting the null hypothesis may not be true.",

These fixed margins are the row totals (group sizes) $R_1=10$ and $R_2=10$, and the column totals (outcome counts) $C_1=9$ and $C_2=11$. The total number of subjects is $N=20$.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, is that the event rates are equal in the two arms. The assumption of exchangeability under $H_0$ implies that, given the margins, every possible configuration of the $C_1=9$ events among the $N=20$ subjects is equally likely.\n\nTo deduce the exact finite-sample distribution of the number of events in the treatment arm (the value of cell $a$), we can frame this as a combinatorial problem of sampling without replacement. Let $A$ be the random variable corresponding to the count in cell $a$. We are selecting a sample of $R_1=10$ subjects (the treatment arm) from a total population of $N=20$ subjects. This total population contains $C_1=9$ subjects who experience the event (successes) and $C_2=11$ who do not (failures).

The term $\\binom{9}{a}$ requires $0 \\le a \\le 9$. The term $\\binom{11}{10-a}$ requires $0 \\le 10-a \\le 11$, which implies $-1 \\le a \\le 10$. The intersection of these constraints gives the valid range for $a$ as integers from $0$ to $9$.\n\nThe denominator is constant for all possible tables with these margins:\n$$\n\\binom{20}{10} = \\frac{20!}{10!10!} = 184756\n$$\n\nThe one-tailed Fisher's Exact Test (FET) p-value is calculated for the directional alternative hypothesis $H_1$ that the treatment arm has a higher event rate.

Since $0.06978  0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_{0}$. The conclusion is that there is insufficient statistical evidence to claim a difference (in either direction) in event rates between the two arms.\nThis discrepancy highlights the difference in statistical power and interpretation between one-tailed and two-tailed tests, especially for results near the significance threshold. The a priori choice of a one-tailed test, if justified by prior knowledge (e.g., that a new treatment could only plausibly increase risk), leads to a finding of statistical significance, whereas the more conservative two-tailed test does not.",
