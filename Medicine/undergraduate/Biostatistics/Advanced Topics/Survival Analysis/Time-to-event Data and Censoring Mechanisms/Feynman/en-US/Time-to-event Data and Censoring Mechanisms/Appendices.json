Assume independent, non-informative right-censoring and that, when an event and a censoring share the same recorded time, the event is considered to occur just before the censoring for risk set accounting. Time is measured in months. The observed data for each patient are given as an ordered pair $(\\text{time}, \\text{indicator})$, where $\\text{indicator}=1$ denotes an observed event and $\\text{indicator}=0$ denotes a right-censoring:\n- Subject $1$: $(3, 1)$\n- Subject $2$: $(4, 0)$\n- Subject $3$: $(4, 1)$\n- Subject $4$: $(5, 1)$\n- Subject $5$: $(6, 0)$\n- Subject $6$: $(7, 1)$\n- Subject $7$: $(7, 0)$\n- Subject $8$: $(8, 1)$\n- Subject $9$: $(9, 1)$\n- Subject $10$: $(11, 0)$\n- Subject $11$: $(12, 1)$\n- Subject $12$: $(12, 0)$\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate for time-to-event data, including the definition of the survival function $S(t)=\\Pr(T>t)$ and the notion of conditional event probabilities at distinct observed event times under right-censoring, construct the nonparametric product-limit estimator of $S(t)$ by expressing it as a product over distinct observed event times.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics, specifically survival analysis, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data and assumptions, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of the product-limit estimator for the survival function, $S(t)$, and its application to a given dataset to find the estimated survival probability at $t=10$ months.\n\nFirst, we construct the estimator from first principles. The survival function, $S(t)$, is defined as the probability that the true event time, a random variable $T$, is greater than some specified time $t$:\n$$S(t) = \\Pr(T > t)$$\nLet the distinct ordered event times observed in the cohort be $t_{(1)} < t_{(2)} < \\dots < t_{(k)}$. The survival function can be expressed as a product of conditional probabilities over the intervals defined by these event times. For any time $t$ such that $t_{(j)} \\le t < t_{(j+1)}$, the probability of surviving beyond $t$ is the same as surviving beyond $t_{(j)}$. This can be written as:\n$$S(t) = \\Pr(T > t_{(j)}) = \\Pr(T > t_{(1)}) \\times \\Pr(T > t_{(2)} | T > t_{(1)}) \\times \\dots \\times \\Pr(T > t_{(j)} | T > t_{(j-1)})$$\nUsing the product notation, and defining $t_{(0)} = 0$, we have:\n$$S(t) = \\prod_{i: t_{(i)} \\le t} \\Pr(T > t_{(i)} | T > t_{(i-1)})$$\nUnder the assumption of non-informative censoring, we can estimate each conditional probability term from the observed data. Let us define the following quantities for each distinct event time $t_{(i)}$:\n-   $n_i$: The number of individuals at risk of experiencing the event just prior to time $t_{(i)}$. This constitutes the risk set. These are all subjects whose observed time (event or censoring) is greater than or equal to $t_{(i)}$.\n-   $d_i$: The number of individuals who experience the event at time $t_{(i)}$.\n\nThe conditional probability of an event occurring at time $t_{(i)}$, given that a subject has survived up to that time, can be estimated by the proportion of subjects at risk who experience the event at $t_{(i)}$:\n$$\\widehat{\\Pr}(T = t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)}) = \\frac{d_i}{n_i}$$\nConsequently, the conditional probability of surviving past time $t_{(i)}$, given survival up to that time, is estimated as:\n$$\\widehat{\\Pr}(T > t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)}) = 1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}$$\nSince there are no events between $t_{(i-1)}$ and $t_{(i)}$, $\\Pr(T > t_{(i)} | T > t_{(i-1)})$ is equivalent to $\\Pr(T > t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)})$. Substituting this estimate into the product expression for $S(t)$ yields the product-limit estimator, also known as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, $\\hat{S}(t)$:\n$$\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{i: t_{(i)} \\le t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right)$$\nBy convention, $\\hat{S}(t) = 1$ for $t < t_{(1)}$.\n\nNext, we apply this estimator to the provided data to compute $\\hat{S}(10)$. We must first determine the values of $n_i$ and $d_i$ at each distinct event time. The total number of subjects is $N=12$.\nThe ordered times of events or censorings are: $3(1), 4(0), 4(1), 5(1), 6(0), 7(1), 7(0), 8(1), 9(1), 11(0), 12(1), 12(0)$.\nThe distinct event times are $3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12$. We need to calculate $\\hat{S}(10)$, so we consider all event times $t_{(i)} \\le 10$. These are $t_{(1)}=3, t_{(2)}=4, t_{(3)}=5, t_{(4)}=7, t_{(5)}=8, t_{(6)}=9$.\n\nWe construct a life table to organize the calculation. The rule for ties in time between an event and a censoring is that the subject being censored is included in the risk set for that time.\n\n-   At $t_{(1)} = 3$:\n    The number of subjects at risk is all $12$ subjects, so $n_1 = 12$.\n    One subject has an event, so $d_1 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_1}{n_1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$.\n\n-   At $t_{(2)} = 4$:\n    One subject had an event at $t=3$, leaving $11$ subjects. The number of subjects at risk is $n_2 = 11$. (Subject $2$, censored at $t=4$, is included in this risk set).\n    One subject has an event, so $d_2 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{10}{11}$.\n\n-   At $t_{(3)} = 5$:\n    At time $t=4$, one subject had an event and one was censored. The number of subjects at risk for the next event time is $11 - 2 = 9$, so $n_3 = 9$.\n    One subject has an event, so $d_3 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_3}{n_3} = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$.\n\n-   At $t_{(4)} = 7$:\n    At $t=5$, one subject had an event. At $t=6$, one was censored. The number of subjects at risk for the next event time is $9 - 2 = 7$, so $n_4 = 7$. (Subject $7$, censored at $t=7$, is included).\n    One subject has an event, so $d_4 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_4}{n_4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$.\n\n-   At $t_{(5)} = 8$:\n    At time $t=7$, one subject had an event and one was censored. The number of subjects at risk for the next event time is $7 - 2 = 5$, so $n_5 = 5$.\n    One subject has an event, so $d_5 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_5}{n_5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n-   At $t_{(6)} = 9$:\n    At time $t=8$, one subject had an event. The number of subjects at risk for the next event time is $5 - 1 = 4$, so $n_6 = 4$.\n    One subject has an event, so $d_6 = 1$.\n    The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_6}{n_6} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe next event time is at $t=12$, which is greater than $10$. Therefore, the survival probability estimate $\\hat{S}(10)$ is the product of the survival factors for all event times up to and including $t=9$.\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\prod_{i=1}^{6} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right)$$\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$$\nWe can simplify this product by canceling terms:\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 8 \\times 6 \\times 4 \\times 3}{12 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 4}$$\nCanceling the $11$s and $4$s:\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\frac{10 \\times 8 \\times 6 \\times 3}{12 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5}$$\nFactoring terms to simplify further:\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\frac{(2 \\times 5) \\times 8 \\times 6 \\times 3}{(2 \\times 6) \\times (3 \\times 3) \\times 7 \\times 5}$$\nCanceling $(2 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 3)$:\n$$\\hat{S}(10) = \\frac{8}{3 \\times 7} = \\frac{8}{21}$$\nTo provide the numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{8}{21} \\approx 0.38095238...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.3810$.",

            "problem": "A cohort study investigates time from a common biological origin at time $0$ (for example, disease onset) to an event time $T$. Individuals are not necessarily observed from time $0$. Instead, each individual $i$ enrolls at a delayed entry time $E_i \\ge 0$ and is then followed forward in calendar time until either the event occurs at $T_i$ or right-censoring at $C_i$, yielding observed time $X_i=\\min(T_i,C_i)$ and event indicator $\\Delta_i=\\mathbf{1}\\{T_i \\le C_i\\}$. Individuals with $T_i \\le E_i$ are never observed in the study because they experienced the event before enrollment. Assume non-informative delayed entry in the sense that, conditional on measured covariates, $E_i$ is independent of $T_i$, and right-censoring is independent of $T_i$ given covariates and $E_i$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of survival analysis and probability—namely, that the survival function is $S_T(t)=\\Pr(T>t)$, the probability density function (if it exists) is $f_T(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}\\Pr(T\\le t)$, and the hazard function is $h_T(t)=\\lim_{\\Delta t \\downarrow 0}\\frac{\\Pr(t \\le T < t+\\Delta t \\mid T \\ge t)}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{f_T(t)}{S_T(t)}$—reason through the implications of delayed entry versus left-censoring.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct about left-truncation due to delayed entry at $E_i$ and how it differs from left-censoring:\n\nA.

In the delayed entry scenario, subjects with $T_i \\le E_i$ should be included as left-censored at time $E_i$ (with contributions involving $\\Pr(T_i \\le E_i)$), because the exact event time is unknown but the event occurred before $E_i$.\n\nC.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a cohort study with time-to-event data subject to delayed entry (left-truncation) and right-censoring. This is a standard setup in survival analysis. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and uses precise, objective terminology. The assumptions of non-informative entry and censoring are standard and allow for a well-defined analysis. Therefore, the problem statement is valid. We will now proceed to evaluate each statement.\n\nThe core of the problem is the distinction between left-truncation and left-censoring.\n- **Left-truncation (Delayed Entry):** An individual $i$ with event time $T_i$ and an entry time $E_i$ is only included in the study if they are event-free at the time of entry, i.e., $T_i > E_i$. Individuals for whom $T_i \\le E_i$ are never observed and are not part of the study sample. All subsequent analyses must be conditioned on the fact that an individual was observed, which means conditioning on the event $T_i > E_i$.\n- **Left-censoring:** An individual $i$ is known to be in the study, and it is known that their event occurred before a certain time $E_i$, but the exact event time is unknown. For a left-censored observation, the data is that $T_i \\le E_i$. We have information about these individuals, albeit incomplete information.\n\nLet's use the provided fundamental definitions:\n- Survival function: $S_T(t) = \\Pr(T > t)$\n- Probability density function (PDF): $f_T(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt}S_T(t)$\n- Hazard function: $h_T(t) = \\frac{f_T(t)}{S_T(t)}$\n\nFor an individual $i$ to be included in the dataset, the condition $T_i > E_i$ must be met. Thus, the likelihood contribution of each observed individual $i$ must be derived from probabilities conditioned on $T_i > E_i$.\n\nLet's analyze an observed individual $i$ with entry time $E_i$ and observed data $(X_i, \\Delta_i)$, where $X_i = \\min(T_i, C_i)$ and $\\Delta_i = \\mathbf{1}\\{T_i \\le C_i\\}$. The observation window is $[E_i, C_i]$.\n\n- If the event is observed ($\\Delta_i=1$), then $T_i=X_i=t_i$. The likelihood is proportional to the conditional probability density of observing the event at $t_i$, given survival until entry. This is $f_{T|T>E_i}(t_i)$.\n- If the observation is right-censored ($\\Delta_i=0$), then $T_i > X_i=c_i$. The likelihood is proportional to the conditional probability of surviving past the censoring time $c_i$, given survival until entry. This is $\\Pr(T_i > c_i \\mid T_i > E_i)$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under left-truncation caused by delayed entry at $E_i$, the likelihood contribution for an uncensored event observed at time $t_i$ is proportional to the conditional density $f_T(t_i \\mid T>E_i)$, which equals $\\frac{f_T(t_i)}{S_T(E_i)}$ for $t_i>E_i$; values $t_i \\le E_i$ are unobserved.**\n\nThis statement analyzes the likelihood for an uncensored observation, where $T_i = t_i$. As established, since the subject is only in the study because $T_i > E_i$, the relevant probability distribution is the one conditioned on this event. The conditional probability density function of $T$ given $T > E_i$ is, by definition:\n$$ f_{T|T>E_i}(t_i) = \\frac{f_T(t_i)}{\\Pr(T > E_i)} $$\nfor $t_i > E_i$, and $0$ otherwise.\nUsing the definition of the survival function, $\\Pr(T > E_i) = S_T(E_i)$. Therefore, the conditional density is:\n$$ f_{T|T>E_i}(t_i) = \\frac{f_T(t_i)}{S_T(E_i)} $$\nThe statement correctly identifies that this conditional density is the basis for the likelihood contribution and that event times $t_i \\le E_i$ are unobservable by the nature of left-truncation. The statement is a precise and correct description of the likelihood contribution for an uncensored event.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the delayed entry scenario, subjects with $T_i \\le E_i$ should be included as left-censored at time $E_i$ (with contributions involving $\\Pr(T_i \\le E_i)$), because the exact event time is unknown but the event occurred before $E_i$.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets left-truncation as left-censoring. In the problem description, it is explicitly stated that \"Individuals with $T_i \\le E_i$ are **never observed** in the study\". This means we have no information about them; they are not in our data set. One cannot include subjects in an analysis if their existence is unknown to the researchers. The procedure described in this option—including a subject with a contribution related to $\\Pr(T_i \\le E_i)$—is the correct procedure for a left-censored observation, where we know the subject exists and their event happened before $E_i$. Because the problem setup is one of truncation, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For nonparametric estimation under left-truncation, the risk set at time $t$ should include individual $i$ if and only if $E_i \\le t < X_i$, so that subject $i$ begins contributing risk only at times $t \\ge E_i$, which operationalizes conditioning on $T_i > E_i$.**\n\nNonparametric estimators like the Kaplan-Meier or Nelson-Aalen estimators rely on the concept of the risk set, $R(t)$, which is the set of individuals who are under observation and at risk of experiencing the event at time $t$. In a standard (non-truncated) analysis, an individual $i$ is in $R(t)$ if they are still under observation at time $t$, i.e., $X_i \\ge t$.\n\nWith delayed entry, an individual is not under observation until their entry time $E_i$. Therefore, individual $i$ can only be at risk for times $t$ after they have entered the study. This means the condition $t \\ge E_i$ (or $E_i \\le t$) must be met. Combining this with the standard requirement that they have not yet had an event or been censored, the condition for being in the risk set at time $t$ becomes that they have entered by time $t$ and are still being followed at time $t$. The statement proposes the condition $E_i \\le t < X_i$.\n- $E_i \\le t$: The individual has entered the study and is under observation at time $t$.\n- $t < X_i$: The individual has not yet experienced the event or been censored at time $t$.\nThis correctly defines the set of individuals at risk at time $t$. By enforcing that an individual only joins the risk set at time $E_i$, the analysis correctly accounts for the fact that the individual has survived until at least $E_i$ to be observed. This modification to the standard risk set definition is precisely how left-truncation is handled in nonparametric analysis, effectively operationalizing the conditioning required by the study design. The phrasing of the condition can vary slightly in textbooks (e.g., $E_i \\le t \\le X_i$), but the described logic is sound and central to the correct analysis of truncated data.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Left-censoring and left-truncation yield the same likelihood contributions for observed events at $t_i>E_i$, since both mechanisms involve missing information prior to $E_i$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, the likelihood contribution for an uncensored event at $t_i$ under left-truncation is proportional to $\\frac{f_T(t_i)}{S_T(E_i)}$. The denominator $S_T(E_i)$ arises from conditioning on being included in the sample ($T_i > E_i$).\n\nIn a study with left-censoring at $E_i$, the likelihood for an observed event at $t_i > E_i$ would simply be proportional to the unconditional density $f_T(t_i)$. Left-censored individuals would contribute terms of the form $\\Pr(T_i \\le E_i) = 1-S_T(E_i)$ to the likelihood. The overall likelihood is a product of these different types of terms. The likelihood for an observed event does not have the $S_T(E_i)$ denominator. The mathematical forms of the likelihood are fundamentally different because truncation modifies the sampling frame itself, whereas censoring deals with incomplete measurement on a complete sample.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If one ignores delayed entry and treats all individuals as if they were under observation from time $0$, estimated hazards $h_T(t)$ at early times (near $0$) will generally be biased downward, because the analyzed cohort necessarily excludes those who failed before their $E_i$ and thus artificially inflates exposure time free of events at early times.**\n\nLet's analyze the consequence of ignoring delayed entry. This means we incorrectly assume $E_i = 0$ for all individuals $i$ in our sample. The hazard function is estimated as the ratio of the number of events to the number of individuals at risk, $ \\hat{h}(t) = d(t) / |R(t)| $.\n\nConsider an early time point $t$.\n- **Correct Risk Set:** The true risk set $R_{\\text{correct}}(t)$ includes only those individuals who have actually entered the study, i.e., $\\{i \\mid E_i \\le t \\text{ and } X_i \\ge t\\}$. For an early $t$, this set may be small.\n- **Incorrect (Naive) Risk Set:** The naive analysis would assume the risk set is $R_{\\text{naive}}(t) = \\{i \\mid X_i \\ge t\\}$. This set includes *all* individuals in the final sample who have not yet had an event, regardless of their entry time. For an early $t$, where many individuals have $E_i > t$, it is clear that $|R_{\\text{naive}}(t)| > |R_{\\text{correct}}(t)|$. The naive risk set is inflated.\n- **Number of Events:** The number of observed events $d(t)$ at time $t$ will be the same in both analyses, as an event can only be observed if the person has entered the study.\n\nThe naive hazard estimator is $\\hat{h}_{\\text{naive}}(t) = \\frac{d(t)}{|R_{\\text{naive}}(t)|}$. The correct estimator is $\\hat{h}_{\\text{correct}}(t) = \\frac{d(t)}{|R_{\\text{correct}}(t)|}$. Since $|R_{\\text{naive}}(t)| > |R_{\\text{correct}}(t)|$, it follows that $\\hat{h}_{\\text{naive}}(t) < \\hat{h}_{\\text{correct}}(t)$. The hazard is underestimated, i.e., biased downward.\n\nThe reasoning provided in the option is accurate. By including individuals in the risk set from time $0$ even if their entry time $E_i$ is much later, one adds \"immortal\" person-time to the denominator of the hazard estimator. These individuals could not possibly have had an observed event during the interval $[0, E_i)$, but they are counted as being at risk. This artificially inflates the denominator and deflates the hazard estimate. The cohort is biased towards survivors, especially at early time points, leading to a downward bias in the estimated hazard.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal Summary: Statements A, C, and E are correct.",

This requires the overall survival function, $S(t)$, which is the probability of being event-free (from any cause) at time $t$.\n\nThe overall hazard rate, $\\lambda(t)$, is the sum of the cause-specific hazard rates:\n$$ \\lambda(t) = \\lambda_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{2}(t) = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} $$\nThe overall survival function $S(t)$ is given by:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda(u) \\, du\\right) $$\nSince the overall hazard rate is constant, the integral is straightforward:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}) \\, du\\right) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) $$\nThe CIF for cause $k=1$, $F_{1}(t)$, is the integral of its cause-specific hazard multiplied by the overall survival function over the time interval $[0, t]$:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{1}(u) S(u) \\, du $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_{1}(u)$ and $S(u)$:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{1} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})u) \\, du $$\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\lambda_{1} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})u)}{-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})} \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\lambda_{1} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t)}{-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})} - \\frac{\\exp(0)}{-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})} \\right) $$\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) \\right) $$\nThis is the correct expression for the cumulative incidence of cause $1$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the incorrect risk estimate obtained by treating the competing event ($k=2$) as independent right-censoring. The Kaplan-Meier estimator under this incorrect assumption targets the *net* survival function for cause $1$, which we denote $S_{1}^{*}(t)$. This function describes the survival probability in a hypothetical scenario where cause $1$ is the only possible event. The hazard for this scenario is simply $\\lambda_1(t) = \\lambda_1$.\n$$ S_{1}^{*}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{1}(u) \\, du\\right) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t) $$\nThe corresponding cumulative risk estimate, which we denote $F_{KM,1}(t)$, is $1$ minus this net survival function:\n$$ F_{KM,1}(t) = 1 - S_{1}^{*}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t) $$\nThis quantity is often referred to as the net risk.\n\nThe analytical expression for the bias at time $t$ is the difference between the incorrect estimate and the true CIF:\n$$ \\text{Bias}(t) = F_{KM,1}(t) - F_{1}(t) $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$ \\text{Bias}(t) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) \\right)\\right) $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the bias.\n\nNow, we evaluate this bias numerically for the given parameters: $\\lambda_{1}=0.05$, $\\lambda_{2}=0.10$, and $t=5$.\n\nFirst, calculate the incorrect KM-based estimate $F_{KM,1}(5)$:\n$$ F_{KM,1}(5) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05 \\times 5) = 1 - \\exp(-0.25) $$\nNext, calculate the true CIF $F_{1}(5)$:\n$$ F_{1}(5) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) \\right) $$\n$$ F_{1}(5) = \\frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.10} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(0.05 + 0.10) \\times 5) \\right) $$\n$$ F_{1}(5) = \\frac{0.05}{0.15} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.15 \\times 5) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.75) \\right) $$\nThe bias at $t=5$ is:\n$$ \\text{Bias}(5) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.25)\\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.75)\\right) $$\nNow we compute the numerical values:\n$$ \\exp(-0.25) \\approx 0.77880078 $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.75) \\approx 0.47236655 $$\nSubstituting these values into the bias expression:\n$$ \\text{Bias}(5) \\approx (1 - 0.77880078) - \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 0.47236655) $$\n$$ \\text{Bias}(5) \\approx 0.22119922 - \\frac{1}{3}(0.52763345) $$\n$$ \\text{Bias}(5) \\approx 0.22119922 - 0.17587782 $$\n$$ \\text{Bias}(5) \\approx 0.04532140 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.04532$.",
