            "problem": "An investigator studies the association between a binary exposure and a binary disease outcome across $3$ clinically defined strata (for example, age groups), yielding three $2 \\times 2$ contingency tables with stratum-specific cell counts given as $(a_k,b_k,c_k,d_k)$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. The observed counts are $(a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1)=(12,8,18,22)$, $(a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2)=(5,15,20,10)$, and $(a_3,b_3,c_3,d_3)=(9,11,13,27)$. Define the stratum $k$ row totals $m_{1k}=a_k+b_k$ and $m_{0k}=c_k+d_k$, the column totals $n_{1k}=a_k+c_k$ and $n_{0k}=b_k+d_k$, and the grand total $n_k=m_{1k}+m_{0k}=n_{1k}+n_{0k}$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of no exposure–outcome association within each stratum (that is, a common odds ratio equal to $1$), conditional on the fixed margins $(m_{1k},m_{0k},n_{1k},n_{0k})$, the cell count $a_k$ follows the hypergeometric model with expected value $E[a_k]=\\frac{m_{1k}n_{1k}}{n_k}$ and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(a_k)=\\frac{m_{1k}m_{0k}n_{1k}n_{0k}}{n_k^{2}(n_k-1)}$.

Compute the numeric value of $Q_{MH}$ from the data above and briefly interpret it in terms of the large-sample reference distribution.\n\nRound your final numeric answer for $Q_{MH}$ to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is well-defined, scientifically sound, and provides all necessary information to compute the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test statistic. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test is used to test for an association between a binary exposure and a binary outcome, while adjusting for one or more categorical confounding variables (strata). The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that there is no association between the exposure and the outcome within any of the strata, which corresponds to a common odds ratio (OR) of $1$ across all strata.\n\nThe CMH test statistic, $Q_{MH}$, aggregates information across $K$ strata. For each stratum $k$ (where $k=1, \\dots, K$), the data can be represented in a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & \\text{Outcome +} & \\text{Outcome -} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Exposed} & a_k & b_k & m_{1k} \\\\\n\\text{Unexposed} & c_k & d_k & m_{0k} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & n_{1k} & n_{0k} & n_k\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that under the null hypothesis, conditional on the marginal totals $(m_{1k}, m_{0k}, n_{1k}, n_{0k})$, the count $a_k$ follows a hypergeometric distribution. The expectation and variance of $a_k$ are given by:\n$$E[a_k] = \\frac{m_{1k}n_{1k}}{n_k}$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(a_k) = \\frac{m_{1k}m_{0k}n_{1k}n_{0k}}{n_k^{2}(n_k-1)}$$\n\nThe CMH statistic is constructed by summing the deviations of the observed counts $a_k$ from their expected values $E[a_k]$ across all strata, and then comparing the square of this sum to the sum of the variances. The formula for the uncorrected CMH statistic is:\n$$Q_{MH} = \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{K} (a_k - E[a_k]) \\right)^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\operatorname{Var}(a_k)}$$\n\nWe are given data for $K=3$ strata.

The denominators are $59$, $49=7^2$, and $531=9 \\times 59 = 3^2 \\times 59$. The least common denominator is $3^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 59 = 9 \\times 49 \\times 59 = 26019$.\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\operatorname{Var}(a_k) = \\frac{200 \\times (9 \\times 49)}{26019} + \\frac{150 \\times (9 \\times 59)}{26019} + \\frac{1672 \\times 49}{26019}$$\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\operatorname{Var}(a_k) = \\frac{200 \\times 441}{26019} + \\frac{150 \\times 531}{26019} + \\frac{81928}{26019} = \\frac{88200 + 79650 + 81928}{26019} = \\frac{249778}{26019}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the CMH statistic $Q_{MH}$:\n$$Q_{MH} = \\frac{\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2}{\\frac{249778}{26019}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{9}}{\\frac{249778}{26019}} = \\frac{16}{9} \\times \\frac{26019}{249778}$$\nSince $26019 = 9 \\times 2891$, we can simplify:\n$$Q_{MH} = \\frac{16 \\times (9 \\times 2891)}{9 \\times 249778} = \\frac{16 \\times 2891}{249778} = \\frac{46256}{249778} \\approx 0.185186$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.1852$.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nUnder the null hypothesis of no association (common odds ratio of $1$), the CMH test statistic $Q_{MH}$ follows, for sufficiently large sample sizes, a chi-squared distribution with $1$ degree of freedom, denoted $\\chi^2_1$.\nThe calculated value of the statistic is $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.1852$. We compare this value to the critical value from the $\\chi^2_1$ distribution. For a typical significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value is $3.841$. Since $0.1852 \\ll 3.841$, the test statistic does not fall in the rejection region. Therefore, we do not have sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The observed data are consistent with the hypothesis of no association between the exposure and the outcome, after adjusting for the stratified variable.",

The analysis of stratified categorical data using CMH and BD tests is a standard and fundamental technique for handling confounding and effect modification.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides the necessary context (study design), data (counts in tables), and specific statistical results ($p$-values) required to arrive at a definitive interpretation. The question is clear and requires applying core statistical reasoning.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem statement is objective and devoid of subjective or ambiguous language. It presents factual data and test outcomes.\n-   **Consistency Check**: Let's perform a brief check on the plausibility of the results. The stratum-specific odds ratios ($OR_i = \\frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i}$) are:\n    -   $OR_1 = \\frac{18 \\times 91}{82 \\times 9} = \\frac{1638}{738} \\approx 2.22$\n    -   $OR_2 = \\frac{25 \\times 88}{75 \\times 12} = \\frac{2200}{900} \\approx 2.44$\n    -   $OR_3 = \\frac{30 \\times 86}{70 \\times 14} = \\frac{2580}{980} \\approx 2.63$\n    The odds ratios are all greater than $1$ and are of a similar magnitude. This consistency is what the Breslow-Day test for homogeneity evaluates. A high $p$-value ($0.55$) is entirely plausible, as it indicates a failure to detect a statistically significant difference among these odds ratios. The CMH test evaluates the null hypothesis of no association (common $OR=1$) assuming homogeneity. Since each stratum suggests an association with an $OR > 2$, it is highly plausible that the combined evidence would be statistically significant, consistent with the given $p$-value of $0.004$. The provided information is internally consistent and factually sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and consistent. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n**Core Principles**\n\n1.  **Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Test**: The CMH test is used to assess the association between two binary variables (here, $E$ and $D$) across multiple strata (here, $S$). It tests the null hypothesis, $H_0: OR_{\\text{common}} = 1$, where $OR_{\\text{common}}$ is the common odds ratio across all strata. A significant result (small $p$-value) indicates that there is an association between the exposure and the outcome after adjusting for the stratifying variable. A key assumption for the standard interpretation of the CMH test is that the odds ratio is homogeneous (constant) across the strata.\n\n2.  **Breslow-Day (BD) Test**: The BD test is a test for homogeneity of odds ratios. It evaluates the null hypothesis, $H_0: OR_1 = OR_2 = \\dots = OR_k$, where $k$ is the number of strata. A non-significant result (large $p$-value) suggests that the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject the assumption of a common odds ratio across strata. This supports the primary assumption of the CMH test. A significant result (small $p$-value) suggests the presence of heterogeneity or \"effect modification,\" meaning the strength or direction of the association between exposure and outcome differs depending on the stratum.\n\n**Interpretation of Given Results**\n\n-   **BD test result ($p=0.55$)**: This $p$-value is large (i.e., greater than conventional significance levels like $\\alpha=0.05$ or $\\alpha=0.10$). We fail to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous odds ratios. This means the data are consistent with the assumption that the association between $E$ and $D$ is of similar magnitude in all three clinical centers. This does not prove homogeneity, but it means we lack evidence against it.\n-   **CMH test result ($p=0.004$)**: This $p$-value is small. We reject the null hypothesis that the common odds ratio is $1$. This provides strong evidence that there is a statistically significant association between exposure $E$ and disease $D$ after controlling for the confounding effect of the clinical center $S$.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nThe combination of a non-significant BD test and a significant CMH test represents the ideal scenario for summarizing the effect with a single, adjusted measure of association. The BD test result supports the assumption of homogeneity needed for the CMH test, and the CMH test result indicates a significant underlying association. Therefore, it is standard and appropriate practice to report a summary measure, like the Mantel-Haenszel estimated common odds ratio, as the primary finding.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The data provide evidence of an association between $E$ and $D$ conditional on $S$, and no evidence against homogeneity of stratum-specific odds ratios; it is appropriate to summarize with a single common odds ratio (for example, a Mantel-Haenszel estimate) and its confidence interval, while noting that a non-significant BD test does not prove perfect homogeneity.**\nThis statement correctly interprets both test results. The significant CMH test ($p=0.004$) shows an association conditional on $S$. The non-significant BD test ($p=0.55$) shows no evidence against homogeneity. The conclusion to report a common odds ratio is the correct statistical practice in this situation. The final clause, \"...noting that a non-significant BD test does not prove perfect homogeneity,\" is a statistically sound and important caveat, correctly distinguishing between \"acceptance\" of the null hypothesis and \"failure to reject\" it.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The combination of a significant CMH test and non-significant BD test indicates Simpson’s paradox; the adjusted association is an artifact, so only the unadjusted pooled $2 \\times 2$ table should be reported.**\nThis is incorrect. Simpson's paradox typically involves a reversal of association direction upon stratification. The non-significant BD test implies the association is consistent, not reversing, across strata. The purpose of stratification and adjusted analysis is to control for confounding variables like $S$. The adjusted association (from the CMH test) is considered the more valid one, not an artifact. Reporting only the unadjusted (crude) result would be ignoring the potential confounding that motivated the stratified analysis in the first place.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The significant CMH test together with the non-significant BD test indicates strong effect modification; therefore a common effect is invalid and only stratum-specific odds ratios should be reported.**\nThis is incorrect. Effect modification (heterogeneity of effect) is indicated by a *significant* BD test, not a non-significant one. The $p$-value of $0.55$ provides no evidence of effect modification. Therefore, the conclusion that a common effect is invalid is false; the results actually support the validity of reporting a common effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The results show that stratification by $S$ has removed confounding so completely that no adjusted association remains; thus the exposure has no effect and no odds ratio should be reported.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The CMH test, which measures the adjusted association, yielded a highly significant $p$-value of $0.004$. This explicitly indicates that an adjusted association *does* remain after stratification. The conclusion that the exposure has no effect is a direct contradiction of the evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The CMH test is only valid when the BD test is significant; since the BD test is non-significant here, the CMH result should be ignored and logistic regression with an interaction term is mandatory.**\nThis statement has the logic reversed. The standard CMH test for a common association is most appropriately interpreted when its underlying assumption of homogeneity is met, which is supported by a *non-significant* BD test. If the BD test were significant, it would call into question the interpretation of a single common odds ratio from the CMH test. Furthermore, logistic regression with an interaction term is the analog to a *significant* BD test (i.e., when effect modification is present). Since the BD test is non-significant, the appropriate model-based analog would be a logistic regression model with main effects only (no interaction).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The problem is valid.\n\nWe will now proceed with the derivation of the required statistics and the evaluation of each option.\n\nThe data are given for $K=3$ strata, with cell counts $(a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k)$ for stratum $k=1, 2, 3$.\n- Stratum $1$: $(a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1) = (12,18,8,22)$\n- Stratum $2$: $(a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2) = (0,20,25,5)$\n- Stratum $3$: $(a_3,b_3,c_3,d_3) = (15,10,5,30)$\n\nThe total sample size for stratum $k$ is $n_k=a_k+b_k+c_k+d_k$.\n- $n_1 = 12+18+8+22 = 60$\n- $n_2 = 0+20+25+5 = 50$\n- $n_3 = 15+10+5+30 = 60$\n\n**1. Calculation of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator, $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$**\n\nThe formula for the MH estimator of the common odds ratio is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^K R_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^K S_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^K a_k d_k / n_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^K b_k c_k / n_k} $$\nThis formula is well-defined as long as the denominator, $\\sum b_k c_k / n_k$, is non-zero. The presence of a zero in an $a_k$ cell does not compromise the computability.\n\nLet's compute the components for each stratum:\n- Stratum $1$: $R_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} = \\frac{12 \\times 22}{60} = \\frac{264}{60} = 4.4$.\n  $S_1 = \\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} = \\frac{18 \\times 8}{60} = \\frac{144}{60} = 2.4$.\n- Stratum $2$: $R_2 = \\frac{a_2 d_2}{n_2} = \\frac{0 \\times 5}{50} = 0$.\n  $S_2 = \\frac{b_2 c_2}{n_2} = \\frac{20 \\times 25}{50} = \\frac{500}{50} = 10$.\n- Stratum $3$: $R_3 = \\frac{a_3 d_3}{n_3} = \\frac{15 \\times 30}{60} = \\frac{450}{60} = 7.5$.\n  $S_3 = \\frac{b_3 c_3}{n_3} = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{60} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nNow we sum these components:\n- $\\sum_{k=1}^3 R_k = 4.4 + 0 + 7.5 = 11.9$\n- $\\sum_{k=1}^3 S_k = 2.4 + 10 + \\frac{5}{6} = 12.4 + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{124}{10} + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{62}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{372+25}{30} = \\frac{397}{30}$\n\nFinally, we compute the estimator:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{11.9}{397/30} = \\frac{119/10}{397/30} = \\frac{119}{10} \\times \\frac{30}{397} = \\frac{119 \\times 3}{397} = \\frac{357}{397} \\approx 0.89924 $$\nSo, $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\approx 0.90$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic, $Q_{MH}$**\n\nThe formula for the CMH test statistic is:\n$$ Q_{MH} = \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^K a_k - \\sum_{k=1}^K E[a_k] \\right)^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^K \\text{Var}(a_k)} $$\nThe expected value $E[a_k]$ and variance $\\text{Var}(a_k)$ are calculated under the null hypothesis ($\\theta=1$), conditional on the marginal totals of each $2 \\times 2$ table. Let $r_{1k} = a_k+c_k$ (cases), $r_{2k} = b_k+d_k$ (controls), $m_{1k} = a_k+b_k$ (exposed), and $m_{2k} = c_k+d_k$ (unexposed).\n\nThe formulas are:\n- $E[a_k] = \\frac{r_{1k} m_{1k}}{n_k}$\n- $\\text{Var}(a_k) = \\frac{r_{1k} r_{2k} m_{1k} m_{2k}}{n_k^2 (n_k-1)}$\n\nLet's compute the components for each stratum:\n- Stratum $1$: $r_{11}=20, m_{11}=30, n_1=60$.\n  $E[a_1] = \\frac{20 \\times 30}{60} = 10$.\n  $r_{21}=40, m_{21}=30$.\n  $\\text{Var}(a_1) = \\frac{20 \\times 40 \\times 30 \\times 30}{60^2 (59)} = \\frac{720000}{3600 \\times 59} = \\frac{200}{59} \\approx 3.3898$.\n- Stratum $2$: $r_{12}=25, m_{12}=20, n_2=50$.\n  $E[a_2] = \\frac{25 \\times 20}{50} = 10$.\n  $r_{22}=25, m_{22}=30$.\n  $\\text{Var}(a_2) = \\frac{25 \\times 25 \\times 20 \\times 30}{50^2 (49)} = \\frac{375000}{2500 \\times 49} = \\frac{150}{49} \\approx 3.0612$.\n- Stratum $3$: $r_{13}=20, m_{13}=25, n_3=60$.\n  $E[a_3] = \\frac{20 \\times 25}{60} = \\frac{500}{60} = \\frac{25}{3}$.\n  $r_{23}=40, m_{23}=35$.\n  $\\text{Var}(a_3) = \\frac{20 \\times 40 \\times 25 \\times 35}{60^2 (59)} = \\frac{700000}{3600 \\times 59} = \\frac{1750}{9 \\times 59} = \\frac{1750}{531} \\approx 3.2957$.\n\nNow, we sum the necessary components:\n- Observed sum: $O = \\sum a_k = 12 + 0 + 15 = 27$.\n- Expected sum: $E = \\sum E[a_k] = 10 + 10 + \\frac{25}{3} = 20 + \\frac{25}{3} = \\frac{60+25}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} \\approx 28.333$.\n- Variance sum: $V = \\sum \\text{Var}(a_k) = \\frac{200}{59} + \\frac{150}{49} + \\frac{1750}{531} \\approx 3.3898 + 3.0612 + 3.2957 \\approx 9.7467$.\n\nFinally, we compute the statistic:\n$$ Q_{MH} = \\frac{(O - E)^2}{V} = \\frac{(27 - 85/3)^2}{9.7467} = \\frac{((81-85)/3)^2}{9.7467} = \\frac{(-4/3)^2}{9.7467} = \\frac{16/9}{9.7467} \\approx \\frac{1.777...}{9.7467} \\approx 0.1824 $$\nSo, $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.18$. Under the null hypothesis, $Q_{MH}$ follows a chi-square distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. The critical value for $\\alpha=0.05$ is $\\chi^2_{1, 0.95} \\approx 3.84$. Since $0.18 < 3.84$, we do not reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nA. Using the fixed-margin conditional model, both $Q_{MH}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ remain well-defined despite $a_2=0$; for these data, one finds $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\approx 0.90$ and $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.18$, so there is no evidence against the null at level $\\alpha=0.05$.\n- Our calculations confirm that $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ and $Q_{MH}$ are well-defined and computable despite $a_2=0$. The denominators in their respective formulas are non-zero.\n- Our calculated value $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\approx 0.89924$ is correctly approximated as $0.90$.\n- Our calculated value $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.1824$ is correctly approximated as $0.18$.\n- The conclusion that there is no evidence against the null hypothesis at $\\alpha=0.05$ is correct, since $Q_{MH} \\approx 0.18 < 3.84$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The zero cell $a_2=0$ makes $Q_{MH}$ undefined because its variance calculation divides by $a_k$, and forces $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ to be exactly $0$.\n- The formula for $\\text{Var}(a_k)$ is $\\frac{r_{1k} r_{2k} m_{1k} m_{2k}}{n_k^2 (n_k-1)}$. This formula does not involve division by $a_k$. The variance is well-defined.\n- The formula for $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ is $\\frac{\\sum a_k d_k / n_k}{\\sum b_k c_k / n_k}$. A single term $a_k d_k / n_k$ being zero does not force the entire sum (numerator) to be zero, unless all such terms are zero. In our data, the numerator is $11.9 \\neq 0$. The overall estimate is not $0$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The only way to compute $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ when any cell is $0$ is to add a continuity correction (e.g., add $0.5$ to all four cells) in that stratum; without such a correction, $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ cannot be computed and, in this dataset, the corrected $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ would exceed $1$.\n- The claim that $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ cannot be computed without correction is false. We computed it directly from its definition. Such corrections are typically needed for stratum-specific odds ratios, $\\hat{\\theta}_k = a_k d_k / b_k c_k$, when a cell is zero, but not for the pooled MH estimator.\n- A continuity correction is not the \"only way\"; the uncorrected estimator is the standard definition.\n- Even if we add $0.5$ to the cells of stratum 2, the new data $(0.5, 20.5, 25.5, 5.5)$ with $n_2' = 52$ lead to $R_2' = \\frac{0.5 \\times 5.5}{52} \\approx 0.0529$ and $S_2' = \\frac{20.5 \\times 25.5}{52} \\approx 10.0529$. The corrected estimator would be $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}' = \\frac{4.4 + 0.0529 + 7.5}{2.4 + 10.0529 + 5/6} = \\frac{11.9529}{13.2862} \\approx 0.8996$, which is not greater than $1$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Zero cells can increase small-sample concerns for the chi-square approximation underlying $Q_{MH}$; while both $Q_{MH}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ are computable here without continuity correction, interpretation should consider exact conditional inference or sensitivity to small-sample corrections, and note that a zero in one stratum can pull $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ toward values below $1$ even if other strata suggest a positive association.\n- \"Zero cells can increase small-sample concerns...\": This is a correct statistical principle. Sparse data challenge the validity of asymptotic approximations like the chi-square distribution for $Q_{MH}$.\n- \"...both $Q_{MH}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ are computable here...\": This is true, as demonstrated.\n- \"...interpretation should consider exact conditional inference...\": This is a standard and proper recommendation when dealing with sparse data. Exact methods avoid reliance on asymptotic approximations.\n- \"...a zero in one stratum can pull $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ toward values below $1$...\": This is also true. The stratum-specific odds ratios are $\\hat{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{12 \\times 22}{18 \\times 8} \\approx 1.83$, $\\hat{\\theta}_2=0$, and $\\hat{\\theta}_3 = \\frac{15 \\times 30}{10 \\times 5} = 9$. Stratum $2$, with an odds ratio of $0$, has a very large weight in the MH calculation ($S_2=10$) compared to the others ($S_1=2.4$, $S_3 \\approx 0.83$). This large weight pulls the pooled estimate $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\approx 0.90$ down below $1$, despite strong positive associations in strata $1$ and $3$.\n- Each part of this statement represents a correct and insightful aspect of statistical practice and interpretation in this context.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. If $a_k=0$ in any single stratum, then necessarily $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}<1$ for the pooled estimate across strata.\n- This statement implies a universal rule. We can test it with a counterexample. Consider two strata: Stratum 1: $(a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1)=(0,1,10,10)$, so $a_1=0$. Stratum 2: $(a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2)=(10,1,1,10)$.\n- For this example, $n_1=21, n_2=22$.\n- $R_1=0/21=0$, $S_1=10/21$.\n- $R_2=100/22$, $S_2=1/22$.\n- $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{0 + 100/22}{10/21 + 1/22} = \\frac{100/22}{(220+21)/(21 \\times 22)} = \\frac{100}{22} \\frac{462}{241} = \\frac{100 \\times 21}{241} = \\frac{2100}{241} \\approx 8.71 > 1$.\n- The counterexample disproves the claim. The effect of a single stratum with $a_k=0$ depends on the relative weights and the strength of association in the other strata.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBoth statements A and D are correct. Statement A confirms the specific numerical results and the immediate conclusion for this dataset. Statement D provides a correct and more general commentary on the methodological issues and interpretation related to the presence of a zero cell.",
