These are fundamental topics in biostatistics and epidemiology. The specified DAG represents a canonical confounding structure. The problem is a well-formulated textbook exercise.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary probabilities and conditions are provided to compute the required quantities. The questions are unambiguous and lead to a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, complete, consistent, and well-posed. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts, corresponding to the two tasks in the problem statement. For a binary outcome variable such as $Y$, a conditional expectation is equivalent to a conditional probability: $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A] = P(Y=1 \\mid A)$.\n\n**Task 1: Demonstration of Simpson's Paradox**\n\nFirst, we compute the stratum-specific associations for $z \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nFor the stratum where $Z=0$, the association is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1, Z=0] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0, Z=0] = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1\n$$\nFor the stratum where $Z=1$, the association is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1, Z=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0, Z=1] = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1\n$$\nIn both strata, the association between $X$ and $Y$ is positive, with a value of $0.1$.\n\nNext, we compute the marginal association, $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0]$. To do this, we must first compute the marginal expectations $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0]$ by marginalizing over $Z$.\n$$\nP(Y=1 \\mid X=x) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid X=x, Z=z) P(Z=z \\mid X=x)\n$$\nWe need the posterior probabilities $P(Z=z \\mid X=x)$, which can be found using Bayes' rule:\n$$\nP(Z=z \\mid X=x) = \\frac{P(X=x \\mid Z=z)P(Z=z)}{P(X=x)}\n$$\nFirst, we find the marginal probability of $X$.\n$$\nP(X=1) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(X=1 \\mid Z=z) P(Z=z) = P(X=1 \\mid Z=0)P(Z=0) + P(X=1 \\mid Z=1)P(Z=1)\n$$\n$$\nP(X=1) = (0.9)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.5) = 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.5\n$$\nThus, $P(X=0) = 1 - P(X=1) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNow we can compute the posterior probabilities:\n$$\nP(Z=0 \\mid X=1) = \\frac{P(X=1 \\mid Z=0)P(Z=0)}{P(X=1)} = \\frac{(0.9)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.9\n$$\n$$\nP(Z=1 \\mid X=1) = \\frac{P(X=1 \\mid Z=1)P(Z=1)}{P(X=1)} = \\frac{(0.1)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.1\n$$\n$$\nP(Z=0 \\mid X=0) = \\frac{P(X=0 \\mid Z=0)P(Z=0)}{P(X=0)} = \\frac{(1 - 0.9)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.1\n$$\n$$\nP(Z=1 \\mid X=0) = \\frac{P(X=0 \\mid Z=1)P(Z=1)}{P(X=0)} = \\frac{(1 - 0.1)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.9\n$$\nWe can now calculate the marginal expectations for $Y$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1] = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0)P(Z=0 \\mid X=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1)P(Z=1 \\mid X=1)\n$$\n$$\n= (0.2)(0.9) + (0.6)(0.1) = 0.18 + 0.06 = 0.24\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0] = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0)P(Z=0 \\mid X=0) + P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1)P(Z=1 \\mid X=0)\n$$\n$$\n= (0.1)(0.1) + (0.5)(0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46\n$$\nThe marginal association is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0] = 0.24 - 0.46 = -0.22\n$$\nThe stratum-specific associations are both positive ($+0.1$), whereas the marginal association is negative ($-0.22$). This demonstrates that the marginal association has the opposite sign from each stratum-specific association, a phenomenon known as Simpson's Paradox.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Average Causal Effect (ACE)**\n\nTo compute the average causal effect, $\\text{ACE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{1}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{0}]$, we use the backdoor criterion. The DAG is $Z \\to X$, $Z \\to Y$, $X \\to Y$. The path $X \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$ is a backdoor path from $X$ to $Y$ because it contains an arrow into $X$. The variable $Z$ lies on this path. To use $Z$ as an adjustment set, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1. No node in $\\{Z\\}$ is a descendant of $X$. This is true, as there is no path from $X$ to $Z$.\n2. The set $\\{Z\\}$ blocks all backdoor paths from $X$ to $Y$. The only backdoor path is $X \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$, and conditioning on $Z$ blocks this path.\nSince both conditions are met, $\\{Z\\}$ is an admissible adjustment set.\n\nThe backdoor adjustment formula for the ACE is:\n$$\n\\text{ACE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{1}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{0}] = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1, Z=z]P(Z=z) - \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0, Z=z]P(Z=z)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as a weighted average of the stratum-specific effects:\n$$\n\\text{ACE} = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\left( \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=1, Z=z] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=0, Z=z] \\right) P(Z=z)\n$$\nWe have the given probabilities $P(Z=0)=0.5$ and $P(Z=1)=0.5$. The stratum-specific effects were calculated in Task 1.\n$$\n\\text{ACE} = (P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0))P(Z=0) + (P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1))P(Z=1)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ACE} = (0.2 - 0.1)(0.5) + (0.6 - 0.5)(0.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ACE} = (0.1)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.5) = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1\n$$\nThe average causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is $0.1$.",

Using the chain rule of probability, we can express this as:\n$$P(X=1, Y=1, C=1) = P(C=1 \\mid X=1, Y=1) \\, P(X=1, Y=1)$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n$$P(C=1 \\mid X=1, Y=1) = 0.9$$\n$$P(X=1, Y=1) = 0.12$$\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$$P(X=1, Y=1, C=1) = 0.9 \\times 0.12 = 0.108$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(X=1, C=1)$, is a marginal joint probability.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, the theoretical justification for identifiability, and second, the numerical computation.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Identifiability**\n\nThe objective is to show that the interventional quantity $P(Y=y \\mid do(X=x))$ can be expressed solely in terms of the observational probability distribution $P(X, M, Y)$. The expectation $E[Y_x]$ is equivalent to $P(Y=1 \\mid do(X=x))$ for a binary outcome $Y$.\n\nThe causal relationships in the provided DAG can be encoded by the factorization of the joint probability distribution over all variables, including the latent variable $U$:\n$$ P(u, x, m, y) = P(u) P(x \\mid u) P(m \\mid x) P(y \\mid m, u) $$\nThis is the factorization of the joint probability distribution based on the given DAG, where each variable is conditioned on its direct parents. Note that $Y$ is conditioned on $M$ and $U$, not $X$, because there is no direct $X \\rightarrow Y$ edge, and $M$ d-separates $X$ from $Y$ in the path $X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$ once we account for the other parent of $Y$, which is $U$.\n\nThe distribution resulting from an intervention $do(X=x_0)$ is obtained by modifying the original joint distribution. The intervention severs the arrows into $X$ (here, from $U$), and sets the value of $X$ to $x_0$. This corresponds to replacing the factor $P(x \\mid u)$ with a Dirac delta function $\\delta(x-x_0)$, which is $1$ if $x=x_0$ and $0$ otherwise. The post-intervention joint distribution is:\n$$ P(u, m, y \\mid do(X=x_0)) = P(u) P(m \\mid x_0) P(y \\mid m, u) $$\nTo find the desired interventional probability $P(y \\mid do(x_0))$, we must marginalize out the latent variable $U$ and the mediator $M$:\n$$ P(y \\mid do(X=x_0)) = \\sum_{m} \\sum_u P(u, m, y \\mid do(X=x_0)) $$\n$$ P(y \\mid do(X=x_0)) = \\sum_{m} \\sum_u P(u) P(m \\mid x_0) P(y \\mid m, u) $$\nSince $P(m \\mid x_0)$ does not depend on $u$, we can rearrange and rewrite this as:\n$$ P(y \\mid do(X=x_0)) = \\sum_m P(m \\mid x_0) \\left( \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) P(u) \\right) $$\nThe term $P(m \\mid x_0)$ is an observable conditional probability. However, the term in the parenthesis, $\\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) P(u)$, involves the unobserved variable $U$ and cannot be computed directly. The core of the identification task is to express this term using observables.\n\nLet's analyze the quantity $\\sum_{x'} P(y \\mid m, x')P(x')$, which is composed entirely of observable probabilities. By the law of total probability, we can expand $P(y \\mid m, x')$ by conditioning on $U$:\n$$ P(y \\mid m, x') = \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, x', u) P(u \\mid m, x') $$\nFrom the DAG, $Y$ is d-separated from $X$ by the set $\\{M, U\\}$. Thus, $P(y \\mid m, x', u) = P(y \\mid m, u)$.\nAlso from the DAG, $U$ is d-separated from $M$ by $X$. The path is $U \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow M$. Thus, $P(u \\mid m, x') = P(u \\mid x')$.\nSubstituting these two simplifications back:\n$$ P(y \\mid m, x') = \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) P(u \\mid x') $$\nNow, let's substitute this back into the expression $\\sum_{x'} P(y \\mid m, x')P(x')$:\n$$ \\sum_{x'} P(y \\mid m, x')P(x') = \\sum_{x'} \\left( \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) P(u \\mid x') \\right) P(x') $$\nBy swapping the order of summation:\n$$ = \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) \\left( \\sum_{x'} P(u \\mid x')P(x') \\right) $$\nThe inner sum $\\sum_{x'} P(u \\mid x')P(x')$ is equivalent to $\\sum_{x'} P(u, x')$, which by the law of total probability is simply $P(u)$.\nSo we have shown that:\n$$ \\sum_{x'} P(y \\mid m, x') P(x') = \\sum_u P(y \\mid m, u) P(u) $$\nThe left side is an expression of observable quantities. The right side is exactly the unobservable term from our expression for $P(y \\mid do(x_0))$.\n\nBy substituting this result back into the equation for $P(y \\mid do(x_0))$, we get:\n$$ P(Y=y \\mid do(X=x)) = \\sum_{m} P(M=m \\mid X=x) \\left( \\sum_{x'} P(Y=y \\mid M=m, X=x') P(X=x') \\right) $$\nThis is the frontdoor adjustment formula. Since every term on the right-hand side—$P(M=m \\mid X=x)$, $P(Y=y \\mid M=m, X=x')$, and $P(X=x')$—is an estimable quantity from observational data, the interventional estimand $P(Y=y \\mid do(X=x))$ is identifiable. Consequently, $E[Y_x] = P(Y=1 \\mid do(X=x))$ is identifiable.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are asked to compute $E[Y_{x=1}] = P(Y=1 \\mid do(X=1))$. Using the frontdoor adjustment formula derived above with $y=1$ and $x=1$:\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = \\sum_{m \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(M=m \\mid X=1) \\left( \\sum_{x' \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid M=m, X=x') P(X=x') \\right) $$\nLet's first compute the inner sum, which represents the causal effect of $M$ on $Y$, $P(Y=1 \\mid do(M=m))$, for $m=1$ and $m=0$.\n\nFor $m=1$:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid do(M=1)) = \\sum_{x' \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid M=1, X=x') P(X=x') $$\n$$ = P(Y=1 \\mid M=1, X=1)P(X=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid M=1, X=0)P(X=0) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ = (0.8)(0.4) + (0.6)(0.6) = 0.32 + 0.36 = 0.68 $$\n\nFor $m=0$:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid do(M=0)) = \\sum_{x' \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid M=0, X=x') P(X=x') $$\n$$ = P(Y=1 \\mid M=0, X=1)P(X=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid M=0, X=0)P(X=0) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ = (0.3)(0.4) + (0.2)(0.6) = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the final quantity by combining these results:\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = P(M=1 \\mid X=1)P(Y=1 \\mid do(M=1)) + P(M=0 \\mid X=1)P(Y=1 \\mid do(M=0)) $$\nWe are given $P(M=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.7$, which implies $P(M=0 \\mid X=1) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$.\nSubstituting all values:\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = (0.7)(0.68) + (0.3)(0.24) $$\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = 0.476 + 0.072 $$\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = 0.548 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ E[Y_{x=1}] = 0.5480 $$",
