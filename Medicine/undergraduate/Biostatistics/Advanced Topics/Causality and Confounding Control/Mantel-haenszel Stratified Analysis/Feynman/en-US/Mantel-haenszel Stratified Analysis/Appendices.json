            "problem": "A multicenter case-control study in clinical epidemiology investigates the association between a binary exposure and a binary disease outcome, with potential confounding by center addressed via stratification. For each stratum $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, the $2 \\times 2$ table cells are defined as follows: $a_i$ exposed cases, $b_i$ exposed controls, $c_i$ unexposed cases, and $d_i$ unexposed controls. Consider data from $3$ centers (strata) with cell counts given by $(a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i) = (10,40,20,30)$, $(5,25,15,55)$, and $(12,18,8,62)$, respectively.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of the odds in a $2 \\times 2$ table and the odds ratio as the ratio of odds between exposure groups, and assuming a common stratum-specific odds ratio across strata with fixed stratum margins due to study design, derive the large-sample Mantel–Haenszel (MH) estimator for the common odds ratio as a ratio of stratum-weighted cross-products.

Do not use a percentage sign; express the final result as pure numbers without units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimator for a common odds ratio from fundamental definitions and its subsequent calculation for a given dataset from a stratified case-control study.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Mantel-Haenszel Estimator**\n\nWe begin by formalizing the structure of the data within a single stratum. For each stratum $i$, the data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where $D+$ denotes the presence of the disease (cases) and $D-$ denotes its absence (controls), and $E+$ and $E-$ denote presence and absence of the exposure, respectively.\n\nThe cell counts for stratum $i$ are:\n- $a_i$: number of exposed cases ($E+, D+$)\n- $b_i$: number of exposed controls ($E+, D-$)\n- $c_i$: number of unexposed cases ($E-, D+$)\n- $d_i$: number of unexposed controls ($E-, D-$)\n\nThe table for stratum $i$ is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n& D+ & D- & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\nE+ & a_i & b_i & a_i+b_i \\\\\nE- & c_i & d_i & c_i+d_i \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & a_i+c_i & b_i+d_i & n_i\n\\end{array}\n$$\nwhere $n_i = a_i+b_i+c_i+d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$. The problem specifies a case-control study design, where subjects are sampled based on their disease status. The number of cases ($n_{1i} = a_i+c_i$) and controls ($n_{0i} = b_i+d_i$) are fixed by design within each stratum.\n\nThe core definition of the odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. In a case-control study, we estimate the odds of exposure separately for cases and controls.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases in stratum $i$ is estimated by the ratio of exposed cases to unexposed cases:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(E+|D+, \\text{stratum } i) = \\frac{a_i}{c_i}\n$$\nThe odds of exposure among controls in stratum $i$ is estimated by the ratio of exposed controls to unexposed controls:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(E+|D-, \\text{stratum } i) = \\frac{b_i}{d_i}\n$$\nThe odds ratio (OR) for stratum $i$, denoted $\\theta_i$, is the ratio of these two odds. It quantifies the association between exposure and disease within that stratum.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_i = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(E+|D+, \\text{stratum } i)}{\\text{Odds}(E+|D-, \\text{stratum } i)} = \\frac{a_i/c_i}{b_i/d_i} = \\frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i}\n$$\nThe problem states the assumption of a common odds ratio, $\\theta$, across all strata. That is, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 = \\dots = \\theta_k = \\theta$. We seek a single, summary estimate for $\\theta$ that pools information from all $k$ strata.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel estimator, $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$, provides such a summary estimate. It is constructed as a weighted average of the stratum-specific information, formulated to have good statistical properties, particularly when data are sparse. Rather than averaging the stratum-specific odds ratios $\\hat{\\theta}_i$ directly (which can be unstable), the MH method pools the cross-products.\n\nThe MH estimator is defined as a ratio of summed weighted cross-products. The specific form, as requested, is derived by choosing a weight for each stratum that is inversely proportional to the stratum's total sample size, $n_i$. Let the weight for the \"numerator\" cross-product ($a_i d_i$) and the \"denominator\" cross-product ($b_i c_i$) be $w_i = 1/n_i$. This leads to the estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i (a_i d_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i (b_i c_i)}\n$$\nSubstituting $w_i = 1/n_i$, we obtain the standard large-sample Mantel-Haenszel estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}}\n$$\nThis formula represents the estimator as a ratio of summed stratum-weighted cross-products, where the weight for each stratum is the reciprocal of its total size. This is the required derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for the Given Data**\n\nThe problem provides data from $k=3$ strata.\n- Stratum $1$: $(a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1) = (10, 40, 20, 30)$\n- Stratum $2$: $(a_2, b_2, c_2, d_2) = (5, 25, 15, 55)$\n- Stratum $3$: $(a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3) = (12, 18, 8, 62)$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of subjects, $n_i$, for each stratum.\n$$\nn_1 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 + d_1 = 10 + 40 + 20 + 30 = 100\n$$\n$$\nn_2 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 + d_2 = 5 + 25 + 15 + 55 = 100\n$$\n$$\nn_3 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 + d_3 = 12 + 18 + 8 + 62 = 100\n$$\nThe stratum totals are $n_1 = 100$, $n_2 = 100$, and $n_3 = 100$.\n\nNext, we apply the Mantel-Haenszel formula. We calculate the numerator, which is the sum of the weighted cross-products $\\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i} = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} + \\frac{a_2 d_2}{n_2} + \\frac{a_3 d_3}{n_3}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{10 \\times 30}{100} + \\frac{5 \\times 55}{100} + \\frac{12 \\times 62}{100}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{300}{100} + \\frac{275}{100} + \\frac{744}{100}\n$$\n$$\n= 3.00 + 2.75 + 7.44 = 13.19\n$$\nNow, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the weighted cross-products $\\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i} = \\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} + \\frac{b_2 c_2}{n_2} + \\frac{b_3 c_3}{n_3}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{40 \\times 20}{100} + \\frac{25 \\times 15}{100} + \\frac{18 \\times 8}{100}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{800}{100} + \\frac{375}{100} + \\frac{144}{100}\n$$\n$$\n= 8.00 + 3.75 + 1.44 = 13.19\n$$\nFinally, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio estimate, $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}} = \\frac{13.19}{13.19} = 1\n$$\nThe problem requires the result for $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $1$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $1.000$.\n\nThe required values are:\n- Stratum totals: $n_1=100$, $n_2=100$, $n_3=100$.\n- Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio estimate: $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = 1.000$.",

            "problem": "A case-control study investigates the association between an exposure $X$ and a binary disease outcome $Y$, stratified by clinical severity at presentation (two strata). Let each stratum be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ table with cells $(a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k)$ for stratum $k$, where $a_k$ is the number of exposed cases, $b_k$ is the number of exposed non-cases, $c_k$ is the number of unexposed cases, and $d_k$ is the number of unexposed non-cases. The odds ratio (OR) in any table is defined from first principles as the ratio of the odds, namely $\\text{OR} = \\dfrac{a d}{b c}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the cell counts in a $2 \\times 2$ table. The crude odds ratio collapses strata by summing cell counts before forming the same ratio. The data below are scientifically plausible and reflect a scenario where the distribution of exposure $X$ varies strongly by clinical severity, which can create confounding.\n\nStratum $1$ (high severity):\n- Exposed cases $a_1 = 500$\n- Exposed non-cases $b_1 = 500$\n- Unexposed cases $c_1 = 30$\n- Unexposed non-cases $d_1 = 40$\n\nStratum $2$ (low severity):\n- Exposed cases $a_2 = 4$\n- Exposed non-cases $b_2 = 57$\n- Unexposed cases $c_2 = 200$\n- Unexposed non-cases $d_2 = 3800$\n\nUsing only the definition of odds and odds ratios and standard properties of $2 \\times 2$ stratified analysis, first verify that the crude odds ratio formed by collapsing the strata overstates each of the two stratum-specific odds ratios. Then, adjust for the confounding induced by clinical severity by computing the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) pooled odds ratio for a common effect across strata.\n\nProvide your final Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio as a single exact reduced fraction.

Compute the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) pooled odds ratio ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$) to obtain an adjusted measure of association.\n\nThe strata are defined by the following $2 \\times 2$ tables, where the cells are $(a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k)$:\n- Stratum $k=1$ (high severity):\n  - $a_1 = 500$ (exposed cases)\n  - $b_1 = 500$ (exposed non-cases)\n  - $c_1 = 30$ (unexposed cases)\n  - $d_1 = 40$ (unexposed non-cases)\n- Stratum $k=2$ (low severity):\n  - $a_2 = 4$ (exposed cases)\n  - $b_2 = 57$ (exposed non-cases)\n  - $c_2 = 200$ (unexposed cases)\n  - $d_2 = 3800$ (unexposed non-cases)\n\nThe odds ratio for a given $2 \\times 2$ table is defined as $\\text{OR} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$.\n\n**1.

This indicates that the effect of the exposure is homogeneous across the strata of clinical severity (no effect modification).\n\n**2. Crude Odds Ratio and Verification**\n\nTo calculate the crude odds ratio, we first collapse the strata by summing the corresponding cell counts:\n- Total exposed cases: $a = a_1 + a_2 = 500 + 4 = 504$\n- Total exposed non-cases: $b = b_1 + b_2 = 500 + 57 = 557$\n- Total unexposed cases: $c = c_1 + c_2 = 30 + 200 = 230$\n- Total unexposed non-cases: $d = d_1 + d_2 = 40 + 3800 = 3840$\n\nThe crude odds ratio is then:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{(504)(3840)}{(557)(230)} = \\frac{1935360}{128110} = \\frac{193536}{12811} $$\nTo compare this with the stratum-specific odds ratios, we can approximate the values:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} \\approx 15.107 $$\n$$ \\text{OR}_1 = \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333 $$\nClearly, $\\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} > \\text{OR}_1$ and $\\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} > \\text{OR}_2$. The crude odds ratio significantly overstates the association found within each stratum. This is a classic example of confounding, where the stratifying variable (clinical severity) is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, creating a spurious overall association when not properly adjusted.\n\n**3. Mantel-Haenszel Pooled Odds Ratio**\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel formula provides a pooled odds ratio, adjusted for the stratifying variable. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}} $$\nwhere $N_k = a_k + b_k + c_k + d_k$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $k$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of subjects in each stratum:\n- $N_1 = 500 + 500 + 30 + 40 = 1070$\n- $N_2 = 4 + 57 + 200 + 3800 = 4061$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the $\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$ formula.\nNumerator:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k} = \\frac{(500)(40)}{1070} + \\frac{(4)(3800)}{4061} = \\frac{20000}{1070} + \\frac{15200}{4061} $$\n\nDenominator:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k} = \\frac{(500)(30)}{1070} + \\frac{(57)(200)}{4061} = \\frac{15000}{1070} + \\frac{11400}{4061} $$\n\nWe can rewrite the numerator terms using the stratum-specific odds ratios, $\\text{OR}_k = \\frac{a_k d_k}{b_k c_k}$, which implies $a_k d_k = \\text{OR}_k \\cdot b_k c_k$.\nSince we found that $\\text{OR}_1 = \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4}{3}$, we can substitute $\\text{OR}_k = \\frac{4}{3}$ for both strata:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) b_k c_k}{N_k} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k} $$\nNow we can express the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio as:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}} $$\nThe term $\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}$ is a non-zero sum of non-negative weights, so it can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThis result demonstrates a key property of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator: when the odds ratio is constant across all strata (i.e., no effect modification), the MH pooled odds ratio is equal to that common odds ratio. The calculation provides the adjusted common odds ratio, which correctly reflects the association after accounting for the confounding effect of clinical severity.\nThe final answer is requested as an exact reduced fraction.",

The continuity correction by adding a small value (like $0.5$) to cell counts is primarily intended to handle strata with zero cells. Such zeros would otherwise cause the stratum-specific odds ratio to be $0$ or infinite, or its variance to be undefined, problematic outcomes for computation.\n\nThe problem specified a correction only for strata containing zeros (Strata $1$ and $2$). An alternative approach is to add $0.5$ to all cells in *all* strata, including Stratum $3$. The sensitivity of $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ to this choice depends on the characteristics of the strata that would be additionally corrected. In Stratum $3$, where the cell counts ($12, 30, 15, 43$) are all non-zero and reasonably large, adding $0.5$ to each cell would cause a very small perturbation. The stratum-specific odds ratio for Stratum $3$ is $\\hat{\\theta}_3 = (12 \\times 43)/(30 \\times 15) = 516/450 \\approx 1.147$. If corrected, it would become $(12.5 \\times 43.5)/(30.5 \\times 15.5) \\approx 1.150$. This minor change, along with a similarly small change in its weight ($S_3$), would have a minimal impact on the overall $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ estimate. Thus, for strata with large counts and no zeros, the choice of whether to apply the correction has little practical consequence on the final pooled estimate. The correction's significant effect is confined to strata where it is mathematically necessary due to the presence of zeros.",
