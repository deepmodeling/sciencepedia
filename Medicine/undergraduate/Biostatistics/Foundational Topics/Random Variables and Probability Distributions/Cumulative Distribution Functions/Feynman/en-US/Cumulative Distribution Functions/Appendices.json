The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is a powerful, non-parametric tool that allows us to visualize and understand the distribution of a sample directly. This first exercise provides foundational practice in constructing an ECDF from a set of observations, a crucial first step in data exploration and a bridge between raw data and probabilistic modeling.
