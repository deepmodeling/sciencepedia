            "problem": "A biostatistics team is studying the time to immediate biochemical response in a cohort where some individuals respond at baseline while others respond later. Let $X$ denote the time to response (in hours). Empirically, there is a point mass at $0$ representing immediate response with probability $p$, and a continuous component for delayed response on $(0,\\infty)$ with probability density function (PDF) $(1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$, where $\\lambda0$ is a rate parameter. Thus, $X$ is a mixed random variable with a probability mass function (PMF) at $0$ equal to $p$ and a PDF on $(0,\\infty)$ equal to $(1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$. Assume $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$ and $\\lambda0$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of expectation as a Lebesgue integral with respect to the distribution of $X$ (i.e., $E[g(X)] = \\int g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}F_X(x)$), and using only well-established facts about integration and exponentials, compute the exact closed-form expressions for $E[X]$ and $E[|X|]$ in terms of $p$ and $\\lambda$. Then, discuss the integrability conditions for $X$ under the Lebesgue definition (that is, when $E[|X|]$ is finite) in terms of the parameters $p$ and $\\lambda$, and provide clear reasoning tied to the structure of the mixed distribution.\n\nExpress the final results for $E[X]$ and $E[|X|]$ as exact algebraic expressions in $p$ and $\\lambda$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a mixed random variable, a standard concept in probability theory and biostatistics, and asks for the derivation of its expectation and a discussion of its integrability, which are well-defined mathematical tasks.\n\nThe random variable $X$, representing the time to response, has a mixed distribution. Its probability measure is composed of a discrete part and a continuous part.\n1.  A discrete point mass at $X=0$ with probability $P(X=0) = p$.\n2.  A continuous distribution on the interval $(0, \\infty)$ with a probability density function given by $f_c(x) = (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$ for $x0$.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probability of the discrete event and the integral of the continuous density over its support:\n$$P(X=0) + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f_c(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = p + \\int_0^\\infty (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$(1-p)\\lambda \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = (1-p)\\lambda \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\right]_0^\\infty = (1-p) \\left( \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (-\\exp(-\\lambda x)) - (-\\exp(0)) \\right)$$\nSince $\\lambda  0$, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda x) = 0$. Thus, the integral is $(1-p)(0 - (-1)) = 1-p$.\nThe total probability is $p + (1-p) = 1$, which confirms the validity of the distribution.\n\nThe problem requires computing the expectation of a function $g(X)$ starting from the fundamental definition $E[g(X)] = \\int g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}F_X(x)$, where $F_X(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of $X$. For a mixed distribution like this, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral separates into a sum over the discrete mass points and a standard Riemann integral over the continuous domain.\n$$E[g(X)] = g(0)P(X=0) + \\int_0^\\infty g(x) f_c(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\n$$E[g(X)] = g(0) \\cdot p + \\int_0^\\infty g(x) (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\n\nFirst, we compute the expectation of $X$, denoted $E[X]$. This corresponds to the case where $g(x) = x$.\n$$E[X] = (0) \\cdot p + \\int_0^\\infty x (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\n$$E[X] = (1-p)\\lambda \\int_0^\\infty x \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use integration by parts, $\\int u \\, \\mathrm{d}v = uv - \\int v \\, \\mathrm{d}u$. Let $u=x$ and $\\mathrm{d}v = \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Then $\\mathrm{d}u = \\mathrm{d}x$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x)$.\n$$\\int_0^\\infty x \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\left[ x \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x)\\right) \\right]_0^\\infty - \\int_0^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x)\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\n$$= \\left[ -\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x) \\right]_0^\\infty + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe first term is evaluated at the limits: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x)\\right) - 0$. The limit as $x\\to\\infty$ is $0$, which can be verified using L'Hôpital's rule on $\\frac{x}{\\exp(\\lambda x)}$. The second term is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ times the integral of an exponential PDF (without its rate constant), which we already know evaluates to $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\n$$\\int_0^\\infty x \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\exp(-\\lambda x) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} (-\\exp(-\\infty) - (-\\exp(0))) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}(0 - (-1)) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = (1-p)\\lambda \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\right) = \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda}$$\n\nNext, we compute $E[|X|]$, which corresponds to the case $g(x) = |x|$.\n$$E[|X|] = |0| \\cdot p + \\int_0^\\infty |x| (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe support of the random variable $X$ is the set $\\{0\\} \\cup (0, \\infty)$, where all values are non-negative. Therefore, for any value $x$ that $X$ can take, $|x|=x$.\nThis implies that $|X| = X$, and consequently, their expectations must be equal.\n$$E[|X|] = E[X] = \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda}$$\nTo be rigorous, we show this from the integral definition:\n$$E[|X|] = 0 \\cdot p + \\int_0^\\infty x (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThis is precisely the same expression as for $E[X]$, yielding the same result.\n$$E[|X|] = \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda}$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the integrability conditions for $X$ under the Lebesgue definition. A random variable $X$ is defined as integrable if its expectation exists and is finite, which is equivalent to the condition $E[|X|]  \\infty$.\nFrom our calculation, we have:\n$$E[|X|] = \\frac{1-p}{\\lambda}$$\nThe problem provides the constraints on the parameters: $0 \\le p \\le 1$ and $\\lambda  0$.\nUnder these constraints:\n- The numerator, $1-p$, is in the range $[0, 1]$.\n- The denominator, $\\lambda$, is strictly positive, so $\\lambda \\in (0, \\infty)$.\nThe ratio $\\frac{1-p}{\\lambda}$ is therefore always non-negative and finite. The only way it could be infinite is if $\\lambda=0$, but this is explicitly excluded by the problem statement.\nTherefore, $E[|X|]$ is always finite for any valid choice of parameters $p$ and $\\lambda$.\n\nThe reason for this guaranteed integrability is rooted in the structure of the distribution. The total expectation $E[|X|]$ is the sum of contributions from the discrete and continuous parts. The discrete part at $x=0$ contributes $|0| \\cdot p = 0$, which is finite. The continuous part's contribution is determined by the integral $\\int_0^\\infty x (1-p)\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. The convergence of this integral depends on the tail behavior of the density. The term $\\exp(-\\lambda x)$ decays to zero much faster than the term $x$ grows to infinity, for any $\\lambda  0$. This rapid exponential decay ensures that the integral is finite. Thus, the random variable $X$ is always integrable given the specified parameter ranges.",
