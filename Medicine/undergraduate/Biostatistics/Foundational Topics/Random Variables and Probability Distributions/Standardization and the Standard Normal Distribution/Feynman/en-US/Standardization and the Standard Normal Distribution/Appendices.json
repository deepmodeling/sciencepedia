By transforming a general normal variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ into a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$, we can solve problems using the universal properties of the standard normal curve. This practice uses the symmetry of the standard normal distribution to solve for an unknown value, a fundamental skill for many statistical calculations .",

The equation simplifies to:\n$$P(Z  a) = P(Z  a - 2)$$\nThe standard normal distribution is symmetric about 0. This means that for any value $k$, the probability $P(Z  k)$ is equal to the probability $P(Z  -k)$. Applying this property to the left side of our equation, we get:\n$$P(Z  -a) = P(Z  a - 2)$$\nSince the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is strictly increasing, if the probabilities are equal, their arguments must also be equal:\n$$-a = a - 2$$\nSolving this simple linear equation for $a$:\n$$2a = 2$$\n$$a = 1$$\nFinally, we substitute the original expression for $a$ back in and solve for $c$:\n$$\\frac{c-\\mu}{\\sigma} = 1$$\n$$c = \\mu + \\sigma$$",

For each biomarker, individual measurements are modeled as independent and identically distributed draws from a normal distribution with known standard deviation $ \\sigma = 1.0 $ (in arbitrary concentration units) and unknown mean $ \\mu $.

The Bonferroni correction sets the significance level for each individual test, $\\alpha'$, to:\n    $$\\alpha' = \\frac{\\alpha}{m} = \\frac{0.05}{5} = 0.01$$\n    For a one-sided upper-tail test ($H_A: \\mu  \\mu_0$), the null hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected if the test statistic $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$ exceeds the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha'}$.\n    The required critical value is $z_{1-0.01} = z_{0.99}$.
