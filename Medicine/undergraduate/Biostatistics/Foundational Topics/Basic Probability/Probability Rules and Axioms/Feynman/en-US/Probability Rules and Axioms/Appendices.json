            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed and fundamental exercise in probability theory, specifically the construction of a product probability space for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested probability. We therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to first construct a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ that models the outcomes of $n$ independent patients, each with a binary response. We must then use this construction and foundational principles to derive the probability of observing exactly $k$ responses.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the Probability Space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$**\n\nA probability space is a triple consisting of a sample space $\\Omega$, a sigma-algebra of events $\\mathcal{F}$, and a probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n**1. The Sample Space $\\Omega$**\nThe outcome of the study for $n$ patients is a sequence of length $n$, where the $i$-th element represents the outcome for patient $i$. Since each outcome $X_i$ is binary ($1$ for response, $0$ for no response), an elementary outcome of the entire experiment is a tuple $\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots, \\omega_n)$ where each $\\omega_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The sample space $\\Omega$ is the set of all such possible sequences. This is the $n$-fold Cartesian product of the set $\\{0, 1\\}$ with itself.\n$$ \\Omega = \\{0, 1\\}^n = \\{(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots, \\omega_n) \\mid \\omega_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\text{ for } i=1, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThis is a finite sample space with $|\\Omega| = 2^n$ elements.\n\n**2. The Sigma-Algebra $\\mathcal{F}$**\nAn event is a subset of $\\Omega$. The collection of all events must form a sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$. For a finite sample space such as $\\Omega$, the most comprehensive and standard choice for the sigma-algebra is the power set of $\\Omega$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)$. The power set is the set of all subsets of $\\Omega$.\n$$ \\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $$\nThis choice trivially satisfies the axioms of a sigma-algebra:\n   - $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (since $\\Omega \\subseteq \\Omega$).\n   - If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then its complement $A^c = \\Omega \\setminus A$ is also a subset of $\\Omega$ and thus $A^c \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n   - If $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ is any (finite or countable) collection of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$, their union $\\bigcup_i A_i$ is also a subset of $\\Omega$ and thus is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n**3. The Probability Measure $\\mathbb{P}$**\nThe probability measure $\\mathbb{P}: \\mathcal{F} \\to [0, 1]$ assigns a probability to every event in $\\mathcal{F}$. To satisfy the Kolmogorov axioms and the problem's conditions of independence and identical distribution, we first define the probability of each elementary outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n\nThe problem states that the patient outcomes are independent and that for each patient $i$, the probability of a response is $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=1) = p$ and of no response is $\\mathbb{P}(X_i=0) = 1-p$. An elementary outcome $\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\dots, \\omega_n)$ represents the joint occurrence of $n$ individual outcomes. The event $\\{\\omega\\}$ is the intersection of the events $E_i = \\{\\text{outcome of patient } i \\text{ is } \\omega_i\\}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nBy the definition of independence, the probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{outcome 1 is } \\omega_1, \\dots, \\text{outcome } n \\text{ is } \\omega_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{outcome } i \\text{ is } \\omega_i) $$\nWe are given $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{outcome } i \\text{ is } 1) = p$ and $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{outcome } i \\text{ is } 0) = 1-p$. This can be written compactly as $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{outcome } i \\text{ is } \\omega_i) = p^{\\omega_i} (1-p)^{1-\\omega_i}$, since if $\\omega_i=1$, this is $p^1(1-p)^0=p$, and if $\\omega_i=0$, this is $p^0(1-p)^1=1-p$.\n\nTherefore, for an elementary outcome $\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\dots, \\omega_n)$, its probability is:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{\\omega_i} (1-p)^{1-\\omega_i} = p^{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^n (1-\\omega_i)} = p^{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i} (1-p)^{n - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i} $$\nLet $s(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i$ be the number of responses (ones) in the sequence $\\omega$. Then the probability of this specific sequence is:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = p^{s(\\omega)} (1-p)^{n-s(\\omega)} $$\nFor any event $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, which is a set of elementary outcomes, the third Kolmogorov axiom (countable additivity, which for a finite space simplifies to finite additivity) dictates that its probability is the sum of the probabilities of the elementary outcomes it contains:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in A} \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) $$\nWe must verify that this measure satisfies the first two Kolmogorov axioms.\n- **Axiom 1 (Nonnegativity):** Since $p \\in (0, 1)$, we have $p > 0$ and $1-p > 0$. Thus, for any $\\omega$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = p^{s(\\omega)} (1-p)^{n-s(\\omega)} \\ge 0$. The probability of any event $A$ is a sum of these non-negative terms, so $\\mathbb{P}(A) \\ge 0$.\n- **Axiom 2 (Normalization):** We must show $\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega)=1$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} p^{s(\\omega)} (1-p)^{n-s(\\omega)} $$\nWe can group the elementary outcomes by the number of responses, $k = s(\\omega)$. For a fixed $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, the number of sequences $\\omega$ with exactly $k$ responses is the number of ways to choose $k$ positions for the '1's out of $n$ positions, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$. Each such sequence has the same probability $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\left( \\sum_{\\omega: s(\\omega)=k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThis sum is the binomial expansion of $(p + (1-p))^n$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) = (p + (1-p))^n = 1^n = 1 $$\nThe normalization axiom is satisfied. The probability space is now fully and correctly constructed.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Probability of Exactly $k$ Responses**\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of the event that there are exactly $k$ responses. Let us denote this event by $E_k$. In the formalism of our sample space, this event is the set of all elementary outcomes $\\omega$ that contain exactly $k$ ones.\n$$ E_k = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid s(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i = k\\} $$\nSince $E_k \\subseteq \\Omega$, $E_k$ is an event in our sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$. Using the additivity property of the probability measure, its probability is the sum of the probabilities of its constituent elementary outcomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E_k) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in E_k} \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) $$\nAs established in Step 1, for any single outcome $\\omega \\in E_k$, the number of responses is $s(\\omega)=k$. The probability of this specific outcome is:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega\\}) = p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nCrucially, every elementary outcome in the event $E_k$ has the exact same probability. The sum therefore simplifies to the number of such outcomes multiplied by this common probability value:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E_k) = |E_k| \\times p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThe final task is to determine $|E_k|$, the number of elements in $E_k$. This is a purely combinatorial problem: we need to count the number of distinct binary sequences of length $n$ that have exactly $k$ ones (and consequently, $n-k$ zeros). This is equivalent to choosing $k$ positions for the ones from the $n$ available positions. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\":\n$$ |E_k| = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nSubstituting this counting result into the probability expression, we obtain the probability of observing exactly $k$ responses:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E_k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThis result, known as the probability mass function of the binomial distribution, has been derived from first principles as required.",

The problem states that $0<q<1$ and $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$. Under these conditions, each of the three terms $q$, $(1-q)$, and $(\\alpha-\\beta)^2$ is strictly positive. Therefore, their product is strictly positive, and the equality does not hold.\nThis demonstrates that $\\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1, Y_2=1) \\neq \\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1)\\mathbb{P}(Y_2=1)$, proving that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are not independent. The non-zero difference $\\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1, Y_2=1) - \\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1)\\mathbb{P}(Y_2=1)$ is the covariance, which shows that correlations persist unconditionally.\n\nFinally, we compute the correlation coefficient $\\rho(Y_1, Y_2)$ for the given parameter values $q=\\frac{2}{5}$, $\\alpha=\\frac{4}{5}$, and $\\beta=\\frac{1}{5}$.\nThe correlation coefficient is defined as:\n$$ \\rho(Y_1, Y_2) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(Y_1) \\text{Var}(Y_2)}} $$\nSince the variables are identically distributed, $\\text{Var}(Y_1) = \\text{Var}(Y_2)$, so the denominator is $\\text{Var}(Y_1)$.\n\nThe covariance is $\\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) = \\mathbb{E}[Y_1 Y_2] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_1]\\mathbb{E}[Y_2]$.\nFor Bernoulli variables, $\\mathbb{E}[Y_1 Y_2] = \\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1, Y_2=1)$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]=\\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1)$.\n$$ \\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) = \\mathbb{P}(Y_1=1, Y_2=1) - p_{\\text{marg}}^2 $$\nFrom our previous derivation, this is exactly the term $q(1-q)(\\alpha-\\beta)^2$.\nLet's compute its value:\n$q = \\frac{2}{5}$, so $1-q = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n$$ \\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6}{25}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6}{25} \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{54}{625} $$\n\nThe variance of a Bernoulli variable is $\\text{Var}(Y_1) = p_{\\text{marg}}(1-p_{\\text{marg}})$.\nFirst, we compute $p_{\\text{marg}}$:\n$$ p_{\\text{marg}} = q\\alpha + (1-q)\\beta = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{8}{25} + \\frac{3}{25} = \\frac{11}{25} $$\nNow, we compute the variance:\n$$ \\text{Var}(Y_1) = p_{\\text{marg}}(1-p_{\\text{marg}}) = \\frac{11}{25}\\left(1 - \\frac{11}{25}\\right) = \\frac{11}{25}\\left(\\frac{14}{25}\\right) = \\frac{154}{625} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the correlation coefficient:\n$$ \\rho(Y_1, Y_2) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2)}{\\text{Var}(Y_1)} = \\frac{54/625}{154/625} = \\frac{54}{154} $$\nTo express this as a reduced fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. Both are divisible by $2$:\n$$ \\frac{54}{154} = \\frac{2 \\times 27}{2 \\times 77} = \\frac{27}{77} $$\nThe prime factorization of $27$ is $3^3$ and of $77$ is $7 \\times 11$. There are no common factors, so the fraction is fully reduced.",
