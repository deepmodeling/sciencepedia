            "introduction": "Anatomical votives, terracotta models of body parts left by worshippers, are a primary form of archaeological evidence for the ailments treated at Asclepian sanctuaries. While simply counting these items gives us a general sense of popular concerns, statistical analysis allows us to ask a deeper question: does the number of votives for a specific ailment significantly deviate from what we might expect by chance? This exercise  introduces a foundational method for testing such deviations, enabling you to use quantitative reasoning to interpret the patterns within a hypothetical archaeological assemblage.",

            "problem": "At a sanctuary of Asclepius in the classical Greek world, worshippers left anatomical votives corresponding to the body part for which they sought healing. Suppose an assemblage from a single stratum yields the following observed counts by category: eyes $30$, limbs (arms and legs) $50$, uteri $20$, and internal organs (e.g., liver, kidneys) $40$. For interpretive purposes in the history of medicine, assume a minimal null hypothesis motivated by a uniform background need across broad body systems in the local catchment: namely, that in the absence of temple-specific preference or differential disease salience, each of the four categories would be equally likely. \n\nStarting from the definition of a multinomial model with category probabilities $p_{i}$ satisfying $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$ and the notion that departures from expectation can be summarized by standardized deviations, proceed as follows:\n- First, determine which single category is most represented in the assemblage in terms of absolute observed count.\n- Second, quantify the overall degree of overrepresentation or underrepresentation across the four categories relative to the uniform null by computing the standardized-deviation sum\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{(O_{i} - E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}},$$\nwhere $O_{i}$ are the observed counts and $E_{i}$ are the expected counts under equal probabilities.\n\nReport only the computed value of $S$ as your final answer. Express your final answer as an exact value (no rounding). No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem provides a clear historical context and a well-defined statistical task based on provided data. It requests the calculation of a standard goodness-of-fit statistic, for which all necessary information (observed counts, number of categories, and a null hypothesis) is supplied. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and free of any scientific or logical flaws.\n\nThe task is to compute the quantity $S$, defined as\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{(O_{i} - E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}},$$\nwhere $O_i$ are the observed counts and $E_i$ are the expected counts for four categories of anatomical votives.\n\nFirst, we identify the observed counts, $O_i$, for each of the $k=4$ categories:\n1.  Eyes: $O_1 = 30$\n2.  Limbs: $O_2 = 50$\n3.  Uteri: $O_3 = 20$\n4.  Internal organs: $O_4 = 40$\n\nThe category most represented in terms of absolute observed count is 'limbs', with an observed count of $O_2 = 50$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of observations, $N$.\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} O_i = O_1 + O_2 + O_3 + O_4 = 30 + 50 + 20 + 40 = 140$$\n\nThe problem specifies a null hypothesis that each of the four categories is equally likely. This implies that the probability, $p_i$, for an observation to fall into any category $i$ is the same for all categories. Given that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$, for $k=4$ categories, the probability for each is:\n$$p_i = p = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe expected count, $E_i$, for each category under the null hypothesis is given by the product of the total number of observations, $N$, and the probability for that category, $p_i$. Since the probabilities are uniform, the expected count is the same for all four categories:\n$$E_i = E = N \\times p = 140 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 35$$\n\nNow we can compute the components of the sum for $S$. The term $\\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$ is calculated for each category:\n\nFor category $1$ (Eyes):\n$$\\frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{E_1} = \\frac{(30 - 35)^2}{35} = \\frac{(-5)^2}{35} = \\frac{25}{35}$$\n\nFor category $2$ (Limbs):\n$$\\frac{(O_2 - E_2)^2}{E_2} = \\frac{(50 - 35)^2}{35} = \\frac{(15)^2}{35} = \\frac{225}{35}$$\n\nFor category $3$ (Uteri):\n$$\\frac{(O_3 - E_3)^2}{E_3} = \\frac{(20 - 35)^2}{35} = \\frac{(-15)^2}{35} = \\frac{225}{35}$$\n\nFor category $4$ (Internal organs):\n$$\\frac{(O_4 - E_4)^2}{E_4} = \\frac{(40 - 35)^2}{35} = \\frac{(5)^2}{35} = \\frac{25}{35}$$\n\nFinally, we sum these values to find $S$:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{(O_{i} - E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}} = \\frac{25}{35} + \\frac{225}{35} + \\frac{225}{35} + \\frac{25}{35}$$\n$$S = \\frac{25 + 225 + 225 + 25}{35} = \\frac{500}{35}$$\n\nTo express the final answer as an exact value, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$.\n$$S = \\frac{500 \\div 5}{35 \\div 5} = \\frac{100}{7}$$\nThis quantity, recognized in statistics as the Pearson chi-squared statistic, quantifies the total deviation of the observed data from the expectations of the uniform null hypothesis.",

            "introduction": "Inscriptions proclaiming successful cures, known as *iamata*, are invaluable textual sources for understanding temple medicine, but they require a critical eye. Since sanctuary officials likely had an interest in promoting the temple's efficacy, we must question whether the public record tells the whole story. This exercise  demonstrates the profound impact of \"selection bias\" through a clear, numerical thought experiment, calculating how the deliberate omission of failures can dramatically skew the apparent cure rate. Mastering this concept is crucial for any historian working with curated or propagandistic sources.",

            "problem": "In evaluating testimonies of healing at temples dedicated to Asclepius in the Greek world, historians often confront selection bias introduced by inscriptional curation. Consider a sanctuary where a set of votive tablets records outcomes for petitioners seeking divine intervention. Let the true counts be $c$ cures and $n$ non-cures, with the cure rate defined by the fundamental proportion $p = \\frac{c}{c + n}$. Suppose initial tabulations from a particular season show $c = 200$ cures and $n = 100$ non-cures. Later, priests remove $50$ non-cure entries from public display, leaving an apparent non-cure count $n' = 50$ while the cure count remains $c' = c = 200$. Define the apparent cure rate by $\\hat{p} = \\frac{c'}{c' + n'}$. Using only these definitional bases of proportion and count, compute the true cure rate $p$, the apparent cure rate $\\hat{p}$, and evaluate the bias introduced as the difference $\\Delta = \\hat{p} - p$. Provide only $\\Delta$ as your final numeric answer, expressed in simplest fractional form without a percentage sign. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a bias term, $\\Delta$, which is the difference between an apparent cure rate, $\\hat{p}$, and a true cure rate, $p$. The calculation will proceed by first determining the values of $p$ and $\\hat{p}$ from the provided data and definitions.\n\nThe problem provides the following initial counts:\n- The true number of cures, $c = 200$.\n- The true number of non-cures, $n = 100$.\n\nThe true cure rate, $p$, is defined by the fundamental proportion:\n$$p = \\frac{c}{c + n}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $c$ and $n$:\n$$p = \\frac{200}{200 + 100} = \\frac{200}{300}$$\nSimplifying this fraction gives the true cure rate:\n$$p = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nNext, we consider the effect of the alteration of the records. It is stated that $50$ non-cure entries are removed from public display. This leads to new, apparent counts, denoted as $c'$ and $n'$.\nThe number of cure entries remains unchanged:\n$$c' = c = 200$$\nThe number of non-cure entries is reduced by $50$:\n$$n' = n - 50 = 100 - 50 = 50$$\n\nThe apparent cure rate, $\\hat{p}$, is defined using these new, apparent counts:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{c'}{c' + n'}$$\nSubstituting the values for $c'$ and $n'$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{200}{200 + 50} = \\frac{200}{250}$$\nSimplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $50$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{200 \\div 50}{250 \\div 50} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nThe problem defines the bias, $\\Delta$, as the difference between the apparent cure rate and the true cure rate.\n\n$$\\Delta = \\hat{p} - p$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $\\hat{p}$ and $p$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} - \\frac{2 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac{12}{15} - \\frac{10}{15}$$\nPerforming the subtraction:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{12 - 10}{15} = \\frac{2}{15}$$\nThe resulting bias, $\\Delta$, is $\\frac{2}{15}$. This value represents the overestimation of the cure rate due to the selective removal of non-cure records. The problem asks for this value as a simple fraction, which $\\frac{2}{15}$ is.",

A key question for historians is how the perceived effectiveness of these different approaches compared.

By analyzing a hypothetical dataset, you will learn to measure the added benefit of a mixed-modality approach, gaining insight into the complex therapeutic landscape of the ancient world.",
