This exercise invites you to step into the role of a historical archaeologist by applying basic geometric principles to evaluate the design of a Roman *valetudinarium*. By calculating the available space within a hypothetical hospital footprint, you will quantitatively assess whether its design was sufficient to meet the practical needs of patient care, providing a tangible link between architectural plans and human capacity.

            "problem": "A Roman military hospital (valetudinarium) is hypothesized to have a square plan organized around a peristyle, with wards arranged along the perimeter and interior circulation provided by corridors. Assume the following, drawing on architectural first principles for area and capacity analysis: the footprint is a square of side $60$ $\\text{m}$, there are $24$ equal wards distributed around the peristyle, and corridors occupy a fraction $0.25$ of the total footprint. Treat the remaining non-corridor area as entirely assignable ward area (i.e., do not reserve additional space for service rooms). Using the fundamental definition that the area of a rectangle is $A = l \\times w$, and the capacity requirement that the minimum floor area per bed is $4$ $\\text{m}^{2}$, with $8$ beds per ward, derive from first principles the ratio $R$ of available ward area per ward to the minimum required bed area per ward. Then, based on this ratio, argue whether the hypothesized ward area is sufficient for $8$ beds per ward at $4$ $\\text{m}^{2}$ per bed under these simplifying assumptions. Express the final ratio $R$ as a pure number with no units, and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in basic geometry and arithmetic, and objective in its language. All data required for a unique solution are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises.\n\nThe objective is to derive the ratio $R$ of the available ward area per ward to the minimum required bed area per ward and to assess the sufficiency of the space. We will proceed by calculating these two areas from the given parameters.\n\nLet the side length of the square footprint be $s$. The total area of the footprint, $A_{total}$, is given by the area formula for a square:\n$$A_{total} = s^2$$\nGiven $s = 60 \\text{ m}$, the total area is:\n$$A_{total} = (60 \\text{ m})^2 = 3600 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nA fraction $f_c$ of the total footprint is occupied by corridors. The given value is $f_c = 0.25$. The area occupied by corridors, $A_c$, is:\n$$A_c = f_c \\times A_{total} = 0.25 \\times 3600 \\text{ m}^2 = 900 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nThe problem states that the remaining non-corridor area is entirely assignable to wards. Let this total ward area be $A_{w,total}$.\n$$A_{w,total} = A_{total} - A_c = A_{total}(1 - f_c)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$A_{w,total} = 3600 \\text{ m}^2 - 900 \\text{ m}^2 = 2700 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nThere are $N_w = 24$ equal wards. The available area per ward, $A_{ward,avail}$, is the total ward area divided by the number of wards:\n$$A_{ward,avail} = \\frac{A_{w,total}}{N_w}$$\n$$A_{ward,avail} = \\frac{2700 \\text{ m}^2}{24} = 112.5 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the minimum required area per ward. The problem specifies a requirement of $N_{beds} = 8$ beds per ward, with a minimum floor area per bed of $A_{bed,min} = 4 \\text{ m}^2$. The minimum required bed area per ward, $A_{ward,req}$, is:\n$$A_{ward,req} = N_{beds} \\times A_{bed,min}$$\n$$A_{ward,req} = 8 \\times 4 \\text{ m}^2 = 32 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the available ward area to the minimum required bed area per ward.\n$$R = \\frac{A_{ward,avail}}{A_{ward,req}}$$\nWe can express this ratio symbolically in terms of the primary givens:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{A_{total}(1 - f_c)}{N_w}}{N_{beds} \\times A_{bed,min}} = \\frac{s^2(1 - f_c)}{N_w N_{beds} A_{bed,min}}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{112.5 \\text{ m}^2}{32 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{112.5}{32}$$\nThe calculation yields an exact value:\n$$R = 3.515625$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.516$$\n\nFinally, we must argue whether the hypothesized ward area is sufficient. A ratio $R \\ge 1$ indicates that the available area is greater than or equal to the required area, meaning it is sufficient. In this case, $R \\approx 3.516$, which is significantly greater than $1$. This means the available area per ward ($112.5 \\text{ m}^2$) is more than $3.5$ times the minimum area required to house $8$ beds ($32 \\text{ m}^2$). Therefore, based on the simplifying assumptions provided in the problem, the hypothesized ward area is more than sufficient.",

            "problem": "A Roman legion maintained a centralized military hospital, the valetudinarium, to serve the health needs of its approximately $5{,}000$ soldiers. For planning purposes, the hospital administrator consults a daily census that records the number of inpatients currently admitted and the occupancy level. Roman medical roles included physician-level staff called the medicus (plural medici), and medical orderlies called capsarius (plural capsarii). For this legion, it is a well-established planning rule that one medicus can supervise up to $12$ inpatients, and each medicus is supported by exactly two capsarii. Occupancy is defined as the fraction of beds in use, namely $o = \\frac{N}{C}$, where $N$ is the current inpatient census and $C$ is the total bed capacity of the valetudinarium.\n\nOn a particular day, the census records $N = 96$ inpatients at $80\\%$ occupancy. Using the definitions above and assuming staffing numbers must be whole persons with fractional requirements rounded up to the next whole number, determine the minimum numbers of medici and capsarii required to supervise the current inpatient census.

Any fractional number of staff must be rounded up to the next integer. This is mathematically equivalent to applying the ceiling function, denoted as $\\lceil x \\rceil$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of *medici*, $M$. The number of *medici* required is determined by the total number of inpatients, $N$, and the supervisory capacity of each *medicus*.\n\n$M_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{\\text{Total inpatients}}{\\text{Inpatients per medicus}} = \\frac{N}{12}$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $N$:\n$M_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{96}{12} = 8$\n\nThe problem states that fractional requirements must be rounded up. In this case, the result is an exact integer, $8$. Applying the ceiling function does not change the value:\n$M = \\lceil \\frac{96}{12} \\rceil = \\lceil 8 \\rceil = 8$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of *medici* required is $8$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of *capsarii*, $K$. The problem states that each *medicus* is supported by exactly two *capsarii*. The number of *capsarii* is therefore directly proportional to the number of *medici*.\n\n$K = 2 \\times M$\n\nUsing the calculated value $M=8$:\n$K = 2 \\times 8 = 16$\n\nSince $M$ is an integer, $K$ is also an integer, and no further rounding is necessary. The minimum number of *capsarii* required is $16$.\n\nThe problem asks for the result as an ordered pair $(M, K)$.\n$(M, K) = (8, 16)$",

            "solution": "The problem is addressed using capacity planning and unit conversion, both of which are general logistical tools applicable to historical infrastructures such as Roman valetudinaria supplied by cisterns.\n\nDefine the variables:\n- Let $N$ be the number of occupied beds (patients), with $N = 96$.\n- Let $h$ be the per-patient daily water requirement for hygiene, with $h = 40$ liters per day.\n- Let $a$ be the per-patient daily water requirement for ancillary uses, with $a = 20$ liters per day.\n- Let $C$ be the cistern capacity in cubic meters, with $C = 120\\ \\mathrm{m}^3$.\n\nFirst, compute total per-patient daily water requirement.
