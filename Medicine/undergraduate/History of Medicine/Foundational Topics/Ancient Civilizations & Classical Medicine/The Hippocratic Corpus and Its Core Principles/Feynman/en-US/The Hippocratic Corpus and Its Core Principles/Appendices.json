            "problem": "You are studying how practitioners grounded in the Hippocratic Corpus might systematically infer which humor is in relative excess, using the Corpus’s core definitions of the four humors and their qualities, and the historically attested seasonal associations. The foundational base for this inference is as follows: the four humors—blood (hot and wet), phlegm (cold and wet), yellow bile (hot and dry), and black bile (cold and dry)—are associated with qualitative properties, and seasons modulate humoral balance by favoring the humor whose qualities they share. Specifically, spring favors blood, summer favors yellow bile, autumn favors black bile, and winter favors phlegm, because spring is relatively hot and wet, summer hot and dry, autumn cold and dry, and winter cold and wet.\n\nConsider a single patient case observed in mid-summer during a heat wave, whose symptom profile has been qualitatively assessed in the Hippocratic manner. Encode the humors by numeric indices $h \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ where $h=1$ denotes blood, $h=2$ denotes phlegm, $h=3$ denotes yellow bile, and $h=4$ denotes black bile. For each observed sign $i$, you are provided an importance weight $w_i$ and a sign-specific support score $s_{i,h}$ for each humor $h$, reflecting how strongly that sign tends to indicate an excess of that humor under Hippocratic qualitative reasoning. The patient’s context and signs are:\n\n- Seasonal context (mid-summer heat wave), index $i=1$: importance $w_1=2$ with supports $s_{1,1}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $s_{1,2}=-1$, $s_{1,3}=1$, $s_{1,4}=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- High continuous fever, index $i=2$: importance $w_2=3$ with supports $s_{2,1}=1$, $s_{2,2}=-1$, $s_{2,3}=1$, $s_{2,4}=-1$.\n- Dry skin and constipation, index $i=3$: importance $w_3=2$ with supports $s_{3,1}=-1$, $s_{3,2}=-1$, $s_{3,3}=1$, $s_{3,4}=1$.\n- Bitter taste in the mouth, index $i=4$: importance $w_4=2$ with supports $s_{4,1}=0$, $s_{4,2}=0$, $s_{4,3}=1$, $s_{4,4}=0$.\n- Jaundiced sclera, index $i=5$: importance $w_5=3$ with supports $s_{5,1}=0$, $s_{5,2}=0$, $s_{5,3}=1$, $s_{5,4}=0$.\n- Restlessness and insomnia, index $i=6$: importance $w_6=1$ with supports $s_{6,1}=1$, $s_{6,2}=-1$, $s_{6,3}=1$, $s_{6,4}=-1$.\n- Absence of cough or sputum (dry mucous membranes), index $i=7$: importance $w_7=1$ with supports $s_{7,1}=-\\frac{1}{2}$, $s_{7,2}=-1$, $s_{7,3}=1$, $s_{7,4}=1$.\n\nCompute, for each humor $h$, the total weighted support by summing $w_i s_{i,h}$ across all signs $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$. Then determine the numeric index $H^{*}$ corresponding to the humor with the largest total weighted support. Report only the single numeric index $H^{*}$. No rounding is required.",

It is not asserting the scientific validity of humoral theory but is presenting a well-defined mathematical problem that models the logic *of* that theory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous computational objective. The language is objective and formal.

This indicates an excess of yellow bile, which is consistent with the initial context of a mid-summer heat wave and the clinical presentation of fever, dryness, and jaundice as interpreted through the Hippocratic framework.",

            "problem": "A central aim of the Hippocratic Corpus was prognōsis: from careful observation of signs, the physician estimates likely outcomes to guide preparation and care. Consider a historically informed modeling exercise in which a Hippocratic-era physician treats an adult with an acute febrile illness. From local casebooks, the physician adopts a background mortality risk for such cases of $P(\\text{death}) = 0.25$. On examination, three classic danger signs emphasized in the Hippocratic texts are present simultaneously: (i) the so-called “Hippocratic face” (sunken eyes, pinched nose), (ii) cold, clammy extremities, and (iii) muttering delirium at night.\n\nSuppose a careful retrospective tally from the same nosological context provides the following empirically observed conditional probabilities for these signs:\n- Hippocratic face: $P(S_{1} \\mid \\text{death}) = 0.70$, $P(S_{1} \\mid \\text{survival}) = 0.15$.\n- Cold, clammy extremities: $P(S_{2} \\mid \\text{death}) = 0.60$, $P(S_{2} \\mid \\text{survival}) = 0.20$.\n- Muttering delirium: $P(S_{3} \\mid \\text{death}) = 0.50$, $P(S_{3} \\mid \\text{survival}) = 0.10$.\n\nAssume that, conditional on the patient’s true outcome (death versus survival), these signs are independent.

The provided probabilities are hypothetical but lie within the valid range of $[0, 1]$ and are internally consistent.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (prior probabilities and conditional probabilities) and a crucial assumption (conditional independence) required to calculate a unique posterior probability.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. The terms are clearly defined, and the question is unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined and solvable problem in applied probability. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of death given the simultaneous observation of all three signs, $P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) = \\frac{P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S_1, S_2, S_3)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the numerator.\nThe prior probability of death is given as $P(D) = 0.25$.\nThe likelihood of observing all three signs given death is $P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D)$. Due to the assumption of conditional independence, this can be expressed as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) = P(S_1 \\mid D) P(S_2 \\mid D) P(S_3 \\mid D) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) = (0.70)(0.60)(0.50) = 0.21 $$\nThe numerator of Bayes' theorem is therefore:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D) = 0.21 \\times 0.25 = 0.0525 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(S_1, S_2, S_3)$, which is the total probability of observing the three signs, regardless of the outcome. We use the law of total probability, partitioning the outcome space into death ($D$) and survival ($D^c$):\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D) + P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) P(D^c) $$\nWe have already calculated the first term in this sum. We now calculate the second term.\nThe prior probability of survival is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\nThe likelihood of observing the three signs given survival, $P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c)$, is calculated using the conditional independence assumption:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) = P(S_1 \\mid D^c) P(S_2 \\mid D^c) P(S_3 \\mid D^c) $$\nSubstituting the given values for the survival outcome:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) = (0.15)(0.20)(0.10) = 0.003 $$\nNow, we can compute the total probability $P(S_1, S_2, S_3)$:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = (0.21)(0.25) + (0.003)(0.75) $$\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = 0.0525 + 0.00225 = 0.05475 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) = \\frac{0.0525}{0.05475} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) \\approx 0.958904109... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) \\approx 0.9589 $$\n\nIn response to the interpretative query, the calculated posterior probability of death, approximately $0.9589$, is substantially greater than the posited grave prognosis threshold of $0.60$, thus strongly warranting a warning to the patient's kin and preparations for a likely fatal outcome. The combination of these three signs has dramatically shifted the initial probability of death from $0.25$ to nearly certain.",

We evaluate $E(y)$ at each of these points.\n\n- For $y = 0$:\n$$E(0) = 2 |14(0) - 44| + |78 - 16(0)| = 2 |-44| + |78| = 2(44) + 78 = 88 + 78 = 166$$\n\n- For $y = \\frac{22}{7}$:\n$$E\\left(\\frac{22}{7}\\right) = 2 \\left|14\\left(\\frac{22}{7}\\right) - 44\\right| + \\left|78 - 16\\left(\\frac{22}{7}\\right)\\right|$$\n$$E\\left(\\frac{22}{7}\\right) = 2 |44 - 44| + \\left|78 - \\frac{352}{7}\\right| = 2(0) + \\left|\\frac{546 - 352}{7}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{194}{7}\\right| = \\frac{194}{7}$$\n\n- For $y = \\frac{39}{8}$:\n$$E\\left(\\frac{39}{8}\\right) = 2 \\left|14\\left(\\frac{39}{8}\\right) - 44\\right| + \\left|78 - 16\\left(\\frac{39}{8}\\right)\\right|$$\n$$E\\left(\\frac{39}{8}\\right) = 2 \\left|\\frac{7 \\cdot 39}{4} - 44\\right| + |78 - 78| = 2 \\left|\\frac{273}{4} - \\frac{176}{4}\\right| + 0 = 2 \\left|\\frac{97}{4}\\right| = 2\\left(\\frac{97}{4}\\right) = \\frac{97}{2}$$\n\n- For $y = 9$:\n$$E(9) = 2 |14(9) - 44| + |78 - 16(9)| = 2 |126 - 44| + |78 - 144| = 2|82| + |-66| = 2(82) + 66 = 164 + 66 = 230$$\n\nFinally, we compare the calculated values:\n$E(0) = 166$\n$E(\\frac{22}{7}) = \\frac{194}{7} \\approx 27.714$\n$E(\\frac{39}{8}) = \\frac{97}{2} = 48.5$\n$E(9) = 230$\n\nThe minimum value among these is $\\frac{194}{7}$. Therefore, the minimal possible value of the overall imbalance score $E$ is $\\frac{194}{7}$.",
