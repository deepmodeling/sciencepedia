            "introduction": "To understand the practice of Mesopotamian medicine, one must first grasp the mathematical language used by its practitioners. Ancient Mesopotamian scribes utilized a sophisticated base-60 (sexagesimal) number system, which was fundamental to everything from astronomical calculations to the precise measurement of ingredients in medical prescriptions. This exercise provides a direct opportunity to practice thinking and calculating like a Babylonian healer by converting familiar fractions into their historical sexagesimal equivalents, a foundational skill for interpreting therapeutic texts .",

            "problem": "In cuneiform medical tablets, quantities of ingredients were often specified using the Babylonian base-$60$ (sexagesimal) positional system. Consider a healer’s composite prescription recorded as a sum of fractions of the shekel: $ \\tfrac{1}{2} $ shekel plus $ \\tfrac{1}{3} $ shekel of a single ingredient. Drawing on the historical fact that Babylonian numeration is sexagesimal and that fractional places to the right of the radix represent successive powers of $ \\tfrac{1}{60} $, express the combined amount as a single sexagesimal numeral relative to the unit shekel, and also provide a modern decimal approximation.\n\nYour tasks:\n1) Combine $ \\tfrac{1}{2} $ shekel and $ \\tfrac{1}{3} $ shekel into a single Babylonian sexagesimal fractional numeral of the form $ a;b,c,d,\\dots $, where $ a $ is the whole number of shekels and $ b,c,d,\\dots $ are base-$60$ fractional digits (that is, sixtieths, $60$-squaredths, etc.). Use the standard semicolon to separate whole and fractional parts.\n2) Compute the same total in modern base-$10$ (decimal) shekels and round your result to four significant figures.\n\nReport your final results in the order: first the sexagesimal numeral, then the decimal approximation in shekels. Do not include units in your final boxed answer, but use shekels in your working where appropriate.",
            "solution": "The first step is to determine the total quantity by summing the two specified amounts. Let the total quantity be denoted by $Q$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of $2$ and $3$, namely $6$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\nThe total quantity is $\\frac{5}{6}$ of a shekel.\n\nThe first task is to express this quantity, $Q = \\frac{5}{6}$, as a sexagesimal numeral. A sexagesimal numeral is a base-$60$ representation. A number is expressed in the form $\\dots d_1 d_0 ; d_{-1} d_{-2} \\dots$, which corresponds to the value $\\sum_i d_i \\times 60^i$. The semicolon separates the integer part from the fractional part. The digits $d_i$ are integers such that $0 \\le d_i \\le 59$.\n\nSince $Q = \\frac{5}{6}$ is less than $1$, the integer part of its sexagesimal representation is $0$. The representation will have the form $0;b,c,d,\\dots$, which is equivalent to the expression:\n$$ \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{b}{60^1} + \\frac{c}{60^2} + \\frac{d}{60^3} + \\dots $$\nTo find the first fractional digit, $b$ (the number of sixtieths), we multiply the fractional value by the base, $60$:\n$$ \\frac{5}{6} \\times 60 = 5 \\times 10 = 50 $$\nThe integer part of this result gives the first fractional digit, so $b = 50$.\nThe fractional part of the result is $50 - 50 = 0$. Since the fractional part is zero, the expansion terminates. This means all subsequent digits ($c, d, \\dots$) are zero.\nTherefore, the sexagesimal representation of $\\frac{5}{6}$ is $0;50$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the modern base-$10$ decimal equivalent of $Q = \\frac{5}{6}$ and round the result to four significant figures.\nFirst, we perform the division in base-$10$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{5}{6} = 0.833333\\dots = 0.8\\overline{3} $$\nNext, we round this value to four significant figures. Significant figures are counted from the first non-zero digit.\nIn the number $0.833333\\dots$:\nThe first significant figure is $8$.\nThe second significant figure is $3$.\nThe third significant figure is $3$.\nThe fourth significant figure is $3$.\nThe fifth significant figure is also $3$. Since this digit is less than $5$, we do not round up the fourth significant figure.\nThus, the decimal value rounded to four significant figures is $0.8333$.\n\nThe final answer requires both results, presented in the specified order: the sexagesimal numeral followed by the decimal approximation.\nSexagesimal numeral: $0;50$\nDecimal approximation: $0.8333$",

            "introduction": "The Code of Hammurabi offers an invaluable window into the societal structure surrounding Mesopotamian medicine, famously stipulating different fees and penalties based on a patient's social status. This exercise moves beyond a simple reading of these ancient laws to a direct quantitative analysis, making the abstract concept of social stratification tangible. By calculating the relative value of a surgical procedure across the different social classes—the *awīlum*, *muškēnum*, and *wardum*—you can uncover the clear hierarchy embedded within the legal and medical framework of the time .",

            "problem": "In the Old Babylonian period, the Code of Hammurabi (CoH) codified differential medical fees by social status for specific procedures, including eye surgery. The three principal statuses were awīlum (free person of higher standing), muškēnum (dependent/commoner), and wardum (slave). Well-attested provisions in the CoH establish that fees for a successful eye operation were stratified by status. Treating these prescribed fees purely as relative valuations set by law, consider the following fee schedule: the awīlum fee is $10$ shekels of silver, the muškēnum fee is $5$ shekels of silver, and the wardum (slave) fee is $2$ shekels of silver paid by the master (owner) to the surgeon.\n\nUsing the CoH’s differential fee schedule as a fundamental base, let $F_{a}$, $F_{m}$, and $F_{w}$ denote the surgeon’s fee, respectively, for an awīlum, a muškēnum, and a wardum, for a successful eye operation. First, formalize the fee schedule as a vector of fees and then derive the ratios of these fees by normalizing each fee to the awīlum fee. Express your final ratios in the order (awīlum, muškēnum, wardum) as exact fractions in simplest form, dimensionless, and present them as a single row matrix. Do not include units in your final ratios. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to perform two main tasks: first, to formalize the given fee schedule as a vector, and second, to calculate the normalized ratios of these fees with respect to the fee for an `awīlum`.\n\nLet the fees for a successful eye operation on an `awīlum`, `muškēnum`, and a `wardum` be denoted by $F_{a}$, $F_{m}$, and $F_{w}$, respectively. According to the problem statement, the values of these fees are:\n$$F_{a} = 10 \\text{ shekels}$$\n$$F_{m} = 5 \\text{ shekels}$$\n$$F_{w} = 2 \\text{ shekels}$$\n\nFirst, we formalize this fee schedule as a row vector, $\\mathbf{F}$, with components corresponding to the fees for `awīlum`, `muškēnum`, and `wardum`, in that order.\n$$\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{a} & F_{m} & F_{w} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, we have:\n$$\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 5 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we are asked to derive the ratios of these fees by normalizing each fee to the `awīlum` fee, $F_{a}$. Normalization in this context means dividing each component of the fee vector by the reference value, $F_{a}$. Let the resulting vector of ratios be denoted by $\\mathbf{R}$, with components $R_{a}$, $R_{m}$, and $R_{w}$.\n\nThe components of the normalized vector $\\mathbf{R}$ are calculated as follows:\n$$R_{a} = \\frac{F_{a}}{F_{a}}$$\n$$R_{m} = \\frac{F_{m}}{F_{a}}$$\n$$R_{w} = \\frac{F_{w}}{F_{a}}$$\n\nWe can express the vector $\\mathbf{R}$ as:\n$$\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{F_{a}} \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{F_{a}}{F_{a}} & \\frac{F_{m}}{F_{a}} & \\frac{F_{w}}{F_{a}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into these expressions. The reference fee is $F_{a} = 10$.\n\nThe ratio for the `awīlum` is:\n$$R_{a} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$$\n\nThe ratio for the `muškēnum` is:\n$$R_{m} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe ratio for the `wardum` is:\n$$R_{w} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nThese ratios are dimensionless, as they are a quantity (shekels) divided by another quantity with the same unit (shekels). The problem requires the final answer to be presented as a single row matrix containing these ratios as exact fractions in simplest form.\n\nThe resulting row matrix of normalized ratios is:\n$$\\mathbf{R} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis fulfills all the requirements of the problem statement.",

            "introduction": "The fees and severe penalties detailed in the Code of Hammurabi did more than just reflect social values; they created a dynamic system of risk and reward that profoundly shaped a surgeon's professional choices. This advanced problem challenges you to use the modern tools of decision theory to model the complex reality of historical medical practice . By developing a formal model of a surgeon's decision-making process, you will determine the minimum probability of success required to make a risky operation a rational choice, demonstrating how we can analyze the powerful incentive structures embedded within ancient legal codes.",
            "id": "4755560",
            "problem": "In the Old Babylonian period, the Code of Hammurabi specified fees and punishments for surgical outcomes: a successful operation on a free person yielded a fee, whereas a failed operation on a free person could result in hand amputation; for slaves, a successful operation yielded a lower fee, and a failed operation required the surgeon to pay the slave's owner the slave's replacement value. Assume a surgeon is considering whether to perform an operation on a patient drawn at random from the urban population. Let the probability of success be $p$, and let the probability the patient is a free person be $q$ (so the probability the patient is a slave is $1 - q$). Suppose the fee for a successful operation on a free person is $B_{f}$, and on a slave is $B_{s}$. If a failed operation is performed on a free person, the surgeon suffers hand amputation; let the monetary equivalent of the disutility of this outcome be $H > 0$. If a failed operation is performed on a slave, the code requires paying the slave's replacement cost $V > 0$ to the owner. Let the per-operation resource cost (time, materials, opportunity cost) be $C \\ge 0$.\n\nAssume the surgeon is risk-neutral, so utility is linear in monetary equivalents. The surgeon chooses whether to operate by maximizing Expected Utility (EU) relative to the outside option of not operating, which yields utility $0$. Starting from the expected utility principle and the historical payoff structure described above, derive the condition on $p$ under which operating is rational, and solve for the minimal success probability threshold $p^{\\ast}$ such that it is optimal to operate if and only if $p \\ge p^{\\ast}$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form algebraic expression in terms of $q$, $B_{f}$, $B_{s}$, $H$, $V$, and $C$. No numerical substitution is required. Probabilities are dimensionless; do not include units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The surgeon's decision to operate is based on maximizing expected utility. The surgeon will choose to perform the operation if the expected utility of operating, denoted $EU(\\text{operate})$, is greater than or equal to the utility of not operating, which is given as $0$.\nThe condition is:\n$$\nEU(\\text{operate}) \\ge 0\n$$\nTo calculate $EU(\\text{operate})$, we must consider all possible outcomes, their probabilities, and their associated utilities. The outcome of an operation depends on two independent events: the patient's status (free or slave) and the operation's result (success or failure). This yields four distinct scenarios.\n\nThe per-operation resource cost $C$ is a certain cost incurred if the operation is undertaken, regardless of the outcome. We can therefore express the total expected utility as the expected payoff from the operation's outcome minus this certain cost.\n$$\nEU(\\text{operate}) = E[\\text{Payoff}] - C\n$$\nThe expected payoff, $E[\\text{Payoff}]$, is the sum of the payoffs of each scenario weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\n1.  **Success on a Free Person**:\n    -   Probability: The probability of the patient being a free person is $q$, and the probability of success is $p$. The joint probability is $p \\cdot q$.\n    -   Payoff: The surgeon receives a fee of $B_{f}$.\n\n2.  **Failure on a Free Person**:\n    -   Probability: The probability of the patient being a free person is $q$, and the probability of failure is $1 - p$. The joint probability is $(1 - p) \\cdot q$.\n    -   Payoff: The surgeon suffers a disutility of $H$, which is equivalent to a monetary loss of $-H$.\n\n3.  **Success on a Slave**:\n    -   Probability: The probability of the patient being a slave is $1 - q$, and the probability of success is $p$. The joint probability is $p \\cdot (1 - q)$.\n    -   Payoff: The surgeon receives a fee of $B_{s}$.\n\n4.  **Failure on a Slave**:\n    -   Probability: The probability of the patient being a slave is $1 - q$, and the probability of failure is $1 - p$.

Since $H$ and $V$ are strictly positive, at least one of the terms $qH$ or $(1-q)V$ must be positive (unless $q=0$ or $q=1$, in which case one of them is positive anyway). Thus, $K > 0$. We can divide the inequality by $K$ without changing its direction.\n$$\np \\ge \\frac{q H + (1 - q) V + C}{q B_{f} + (1 - q) B_{s} + q H + (1 - q) V}\n$$\nThis inequality establishes the condition under which operating is the rational choice. The minimal success probability threshold, $p^{\\ast}$, is the value at which the surgeon is indifferent between operating and not operating.

The denominator represents the total stakes of the operation: the sum of the expected gain from success and the expected loss from failure. It is the rational choice to operate if and only if the actual probability of success $p$ is greater than or equal to this threshold $p^{\\ast}$.",
