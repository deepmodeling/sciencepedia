This first exercise places you in the role of a data analyst during the Crimean War, tasked with making sense of mortality data.

            "problem": "In the spirit of Florence Nightingale’s mid-nineteenth-century hospital reforms, consider a field hospital that records causes of death among admissions in order to distinguish deaths from infectious diseases from deaths due to battle wounds. Suppose that over a single campaign the hospital logs the following counts of deaths among a total of $1000$ admissions: cholera $80$, typhus $120$, dysentery $100$, and wounds $70$. Assume that causes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for deaths, and that the appropriate denominator for a mortality proportion in this setting is the total number of admissions. Using the foundational epidemiological definition that the mortality proportion for a specified cause equals the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total admissions, treat “infectious disease” as the aggregation of cholera, typhus, and dysentery and “wounds” as its own category. Derive from first principles the infectious-disease mortality proportion and the wounds mortality proportion, and then compute the ratio of the infectious-disease mortality proportion to the wounds mortality proportion. Report only this ratio as your final answer, expressed as a pure number (no units and no percent sign), and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Total number of admissions: $N_{\\text{adm}} = 1000$\n- Number of deaths from cholera: $D_{\\text{chol}} = 80$\n- Number of deaths from typhus: $D_{\\text{typh}} = 120$\n- Number of deaths from dysentery: $D_{\\text{dys}} = 100$\n- Number of deaths from wounds: $D_{\\text{wounds}} = 70$\n- Causes of death are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for all deaths.\n- Definition of mortality proportion for a cause: $\\text{Mortality Proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from cause}}{\\text{Total admissions}}$\n- Definition of \"infectious disease\" deaths, $D_{\\text{id}}$: The aggregation of deaths from cholera, typhus, and dysentery.\n- Definition of \"wounds\" deaths, $D_{\\text{wounds}}$: The given count of deaths from wounds.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is grounded in the foundational principles of epidemiology and elementary statistics. The historical context provided by Florence Nightingale's work is appropriate, as she was a pioneer in using statistical data to advocate for public health reforms. All data and definitions required for a solution are explicitly provided. The definitions of \"mortality proportion\", \"infectious disease\", and \"wounds\" are clear and unambiguous. The data are internally consistent; the total number of deaths ($80 + 120 + 100 + 70 = 370$) is less than the total number of admissions ($1000$), which is a logical necessity. Thus, the problem is well-posed and admits a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of a ratio of two mortality proportions. We will derive each proportion from first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of deaths attributable to \"infectious disease\". This category is defined as the aggregation of deaths from cholera, typhus, and dysentery. Since the causes of death are stated to be mutually exclusive, the total count is the sum of the individual counts. Let $D_{\\text{id}}$ be the number of deaths from infectious disease.\n$$D_{\\text{id}} = D_{\\text{chol}} + D_{\\text{typh}} + D_{\\text{dys}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{id}} = 80 + 120 + 100 = 300$$\n\nNext, we use the provided definition of mortality proportion. The mortality proportion for a specified cause is the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total number of admissions, $N_{\\text{adm}}$.\n\nThe infectious-disease mortality proportion, denoted as $P_{\\text{id}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{id}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}} = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3$$\n\nThe wounds mortality proportion, denoted as $P_{\\text{wounds}}$, is based on the given number of deaths from wounds, $D_{\\text{wounds}} = 70$.\n$$P_{\\text{wounds}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{wounds}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}} = \\frac{70}{1000} = 0.07$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the infectious-disease mortality proportion to the wounds mortality proportion. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{P_{\\text{id}}}{P_{\\text{wounds}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the proportions:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}}}{\\frac{D_{\\text{wounds}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}}}$$\nThe term for total admissions, $N_{\\text{adm}}$, cancels, simplifying the ratio to the ratio of the death counts for the two categories:\n$$R = \\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{D_{\\text{wounds}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values for the number of deaths:\n$$R = \\frac{300}{70} = \\frac{30}{7}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the ratio and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$R = \\frac{30}{7} \\approx 4.28571428...$$\nTo round this to four significant figures, we examine the first five digits: $4.2857$. Since the fifth digit ($7$) is $5$ or greater, we round up the fourth significant digit ($5$).\n$$R \\approx 4.286$$\nThis is the final answer.",

            "introduction": "Once a problem is identified and a solution is implemented, the next critical step is to measure its impact. This practice involves a straightforward but powerful calculation to estimate the number of \"deaths avoided\" following sanitary and nursing reforms . This type of pre-post analysis was essential for Nightingale to prove the effectiveness of her interventions. As you work through the problem, you will also engage with a crucial concept in epidemiology: the challenge of attributing causality based on observational data, reminding us that correlation is not causation.",

            "problem": "Florence Nightingale’s statistical work during the Crimean War drew on basic probabilistic reasoning: if each soldier faces a mortality risk from disease over a defined period, then in a large cohort the expected number of deaths is the sum of those individual risks. Consider a cohort of $20{,}000$ soldiers observed over a comparable period before and after the introduction of sanitation and professionalized nursing reforms. Suppose the pre-commission disease mortality risk is $0.17$ per soldier over the period, and the post-reform disease mortality risk is $0.06$ per soldier over the period. Starting only from the definition that, for independent and identically distributed Bernoulli outcomes with per-individual probability $p$, the expected total count in a cohort of size $n$ equals the sum of individual expectations, derive an expression for the expected number of deaths avoided in the cohort when the risk changes from $p_0$ to $p_1$, and then compute this value using $p_0=0.17$, $p_1=0.06$, and $n=20{,}000$. Express your final answer as a number of deaths. Provide the numeric result as an exact integer (no rounding). After computing the number, briefly state in your reasoning why this estimate, while useful for historical inference about reforms associated with Florence Nightingale’s program, has limits for causal attribution; however, your final reported answer must be the single computed number of avoided deaths.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no disqualifying flaws.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the expected number of deaths avoided and its computation based on provided data. We begin by formalizing the situation using the principles of probability theory.\n\nLet the outcome for an individual soldier be represented by a Bernoulli random variable, $X_i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$, the total number of soldiers in the cohort. We define $X_i=1$ if the $i$-th soldier dies from disease and $X_i=0$ if the soldier survives. The problem states that the mortality risk, or the probability of death for a single soldier, is $p$. Thus, we have the probability mass function for each soldier:\n$$ P(X_i=1) = p $$\n$$ P(X_i=0) = 1-p $$\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is, by definition:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p $$\n\nThe total number of deaths in the cohort, $D$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $n$ soldiers:\n$$ D = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $$\n\nThe expected total number of deaths, $E[D]$, is the expected value of this sum. The problem specifies that we should use the property that the expected total count is the sum of individual expectations. This is a direct application of the linearity of expectation:\n$$ E[D] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] $$\n\nSince the soldiers' outcomes are described as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the expected value for each soldier is the same, $E[X_i] = p$. Therefore, the sum becomes:\n$$ E[D] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = n \\cdot p $$\n\nThis general expression gives the expected number of deaths in a cohort of size $n$ where each individual has a mortality risk of $p$.\n\nWe are given two scenarios: pre-reform and post-reform. Let $p_0$ be the pre-reform mortality risk and $p_1$ be the post-reform mortality risk.\nThe expected number of deaths pre-reform, $E[D_0]$, is:\n$$ E[D_0] = n \\cdot p_0 $$\nThe expected number of deaths post-reform, $E[D_1]$, is:\n$$ E[D_1] = n \\cdot p_1 $$\n\nThe expected number of deaths avoided is the difference between the expected number of deaths before the reforms and the expected number of deaths after the reforms. Let this quantity be denoted by $\\Delta E$.\n$$ \\Delta E = E[D_0] - E[D_1] $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\Delta E = n \\cdot p_0 - n \\cdot p_1 $$\nFactoring out the cohort size $n$, we obtain the desired general expression for the expected number of deaths avoided:\n$$ \\Delta E = n(p_0 - p_1) $$\n\nNow, we compute this value using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Cohort size, $n = 20,000$.\n- Pre-reform mortality risk, $p_0 = 0.17$.\n- Post-reform mortality risk, $p_1 = 0.06$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta E = 20,000 \\cdot (0.17 - 0.06) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 20,000 \\cdot (0.11) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 2,200 $$\n\nThus, the expected number of deaths avoided in the cohort is $2,200$.\n\nFinally, we address the limits of this estimate for causal attribution. The calculation demonstrates a strong statistical association (a correlation) between the sanitary and nursing reforms and the substantial reduction in the expected mortality rate. However, correlation does not imply causation. To attribute the reduction in deaths solely to Nightingale's reforms would be to assume they were the only relevant factor that changed between the two observation periods. This is a strong and likely oversimplified assumption in a complex historical context like a war. Other factors, known as confounding variables, could have contributed to the observed outcome. Examples of such confounders include:\n1.  Changes in the intensity or nature of the conflict, which might affect the baseline health and injury rates of soldiers.\n2.  Improvements in nutrition or supply lines unrelated to the specific sanitary reforms.\n3.  The natural progression of epidemics, which can have their own cycles of waxing and waning.\n4.  Seasonal effects, as mortality from disease often varies significantly with the time of year.\nWithout a controlled experimental design where a treated group (receiving reforms) is compared simultaneously to an untreated control group (not receiving reforms), it is impossible to definitively isolate the effect of the reforms from other co-occurring changes. Therefore, while the statistical analysis provides powerful circumstantial evidence for the effectiveness of Nightingale's program, it is not, by itself, conclusive proof of a causal link.",

            "introduction": "Florence Nightingale's vision extended beyond immediate reforms; she aimed to establish nursing as a respected and enduring profession through rigorous training. This final exercise explores a fundamental challenge in building any elite professional corps: the trade-off between maintaining high standards and producing a sufficient number of graduates to meet demand . By modeling the effects of attrition on a cohort of trainees, you will gain insight into the strategic decisions that shaped the future of modern nursing.",
            "id": "4745462",
            "problem": "Florence Nightingale’s training school emphasized rigorous moral character and practical competency standards for probationers, which historically led to early-stage removals of trainees who did not meet expectations. Consider a cohort-based training model consistent with this practice: an entering cohort of size $N_{0}$ faces a first-year screening with a constant proportional attrition rate $a$ applied to the cohort. Assume that after this first-year screening there is no further attrition and all remaining probationers proceed to graduation.\n\nStarting from the definition that an attrition rate is the proportion of the cohort removed during the screening, derive from first principles an expression for the number of graduates $G$ as a function of $N_{0}$ and $a$. Then evaluate $G$ for an entering cohort of $N_{0} = 60$ and a first-year attrition rate of $a = 0.25$. Provide the final answer as a count (no units). No rounding is required.\n\nIn one or two sentences, interpret your result in terms of the trade-off between selectivity (higher $a$ induced by stricter standards) and the supply of trained nurses, as faced by reformers seeking to professionalize nursing while meeting service needs.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Entering cohort size: $N_{0}$\n-   First-year proportional attrition rate: $a$\n-   Definition of attrition rate: \"the proportion of the cohort removed during the screening\"\n-   Condition: \"after this first-year screening there is no further attrition\"\n-   Number of graduates: $G$\n-   Function to derive: $G$ as a function of $N_{0}$ and $a$.\n-   Values for evaluation: $N_{0} = 60$, $a = 0.25$.\n-   Required interpretation: A brief statement on the trade-off between selectivity and supply.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses a basic and sound mathematical model of population dynamics (attrition). This is a standard approach in fields from epidemiology to workforce planning. The historical context is plausible and serves as a framing device for a formalizable mathematical problem.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained. The term \"attrition rate\" is explicitly defined as a proportion. All necessary variables ($N_{0}$, $a$) are provided for the derivation and subsequent calculation. The assumption of no attrition after the first year removes ambiguity and ensures a unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and free of subjective or biased statements.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the specified flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). It is a well-defined mathematical modeling exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for Graduates**\nThe number of graduates, $G$, is the initial number of probationers in the cohort, $N_{0}$, minus the number of probationers removed during the first-year screening. Let the number of probationers removed be denoted by $N_{removed}$.\n$$\nG = N_{0} - N_{removed}\n$$\nThe problem states that the attrition rate, $a$, is the *proportion* of the cohort removed. A proportion is a part of a whole, calculated by dividing the part by the whole. Therefore, the attrition rate $a$ is defined as:\n$$\na = \\frac{N_{removed}}{N_{0}}\n$$\nTo find the number of removed probationers, $N_{removed}$, we can rearrange this definition from first principles:\n$$\nN_{removed} = a \\cdot N_{0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $N_{removed}$ back into the equation for the number of graduates, $G$:\n$$\nG = N_{0} - (a \\cdot N_{0})\n$$\nFactoring out the initial cohort size, $N_{0}$, we obtain the general expression for the number of graduates as a function of the initial cohort size and the attrition rate:\n$$\nG(N_{0}, a) = N_{0}(1 - a)\n$$\nThis expression represents the number of individuals remaining in a cohort after a single attrition event characterized by a rate $a$.\n\n**Evaluation for Given Values**\nThe problem requires the evaluation of $G$ for an entering cohort of size $N_{0} = 60$ and a first-year attrition rate of $a = 0.25$. Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nG = 60 \\cdot (1 - 0.25)\n$$\n$$\nG = 60 \\cdot (0.75)\n$$\nTo compute this product, we can express the decimal $0.75$ as a fraction, $\\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$\nG = 60 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n$$\nG = \\frac{180}{4}\n$$\n$$\nG = 45\n$$\nThus, for an initial cohort of $60$ probationers and a first-year attrition rate of $25\\%$, the number of graduates is $45$.\n\n**Interpretation**\nThis result illustrates the fundamental trade-off between programmatic selectivity and workforce supply. Stricter standards, corresponding to a higher attrition rate $a$, would yield a smaller number of graduates $G$, thereby enhancing the perceived quality and professional status of the nursing corps at the cost of reducing the quantity of nurses available to meet healthcare demands.",
