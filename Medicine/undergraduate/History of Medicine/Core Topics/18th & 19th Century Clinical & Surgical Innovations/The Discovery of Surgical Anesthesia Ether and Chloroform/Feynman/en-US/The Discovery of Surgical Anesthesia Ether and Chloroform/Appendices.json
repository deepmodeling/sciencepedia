The historical context is accurate, and the physical parameters (vapor pressures, atmospheric pressure) are standard and realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data to derive a general formula and then calculate specific values. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the saturated inspired fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, of an anesthetic agent. According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure of a gas mixture, $P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$, is the sum of the partial pressures of its individual components. In an open system where an anesthetic liquid evaporates into ambient air until the air is saturated, the components of the mixture are the gases of the air (collectively represented with partial pressure $P_{\\mathrm{air}}$) and the anesthetic vapor ($P_{\\mathrm{agent}}$).\n\nTherefore, the total atmospheric pressure is given by:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{atm}} = P_{\\mathrm{air}} + P_{\\mathrm{agent}}$$\n\nThe problem states that for a saturated vapor, the partial pressure of the agent, $P_{\\mathrm{agent}}$, is equal to its equilibrium vapor pressure at the given temperature.\n\nThe inspired fraction of any component in a gas mixture is defined as the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure. Thus, the saturated inspired fraction of the anesthetic agent, $F_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{agent}}}{P_{\\mathrm{total}}}$$\n\nIn this context, the total pressure is the ambient atmospheric pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$. This gives the general expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{agent}}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$\nThis expression represents the maximum possible concentration (as a fraction) of the anesthetic agent that can be delivered in an open system at a given atmospheric pressure and temperature, as it corresponds to a carrier gas that is fully saturated with the agent's vapor.\n\nNext, we compute the specific values for diethyl ether and chloroform using the provided data. The total atmospheric pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nFor diethyl ether, the vapor pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{ether}} = 440\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. The saturated inspired fraction is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sat, ether}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{ether}}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}} = \\frac{440\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} \\approx 0.578947...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $F_{\\mathrm{sat, ether}} \\approx 0.579$. This corresponds to a maximum concentration of $57.9\\%$.\n\nFor chloroform, the vapor pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{chloroform}} = 160\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. The saturated inspired fraction is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sat, chloroform}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{chloroform}}}{P_{\\mathrm{atm}}} = \\frac{160\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} \\approx 0.210526...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $F_{\\mathrm{sat, chloroform}} \\approx 0.211$. This corresponds to a maximum concentration of $21.1\\%$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe calculated values, $F_{\\mathrm{sat, ether}} \\approx 0.579$ and $F_{\\mathrm{sat, chloroform}} \\approx 0.211$, represent the maximum possible inspired concentrations achievable in an open-drop system at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and sea-level pressure.\n\nIn the historical context of the $1840$s, anesthesia was administered using imprecise open-drop techniques, where the liquid agent was dripped onto a cloth or sponge held over the patient's face. The actual delivered concentration depended on the rate of dripping, the room's ventilation, and the patient's breathing, but the saturated vapor concentration represents the physical upper limit.\n\nThe minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of anesthetic potency, with a lower MAC indicating higher potency. The MAC for ether is approximately $1.9\\%$, while for chloroform it is much lower, at about $0.75\\%$. Anesthetic maintenance is typically achieved at $1$ to $1.5$ times the MAC value (i.e., $\\sim 2\\%-3\\%$ for ether, $\\sim 0.75\\%-1.2\\%$ for chloroform).\n\nComparison of the maximum possible concentrations with the required therapeutic concentrations reveals critical safety aspects:\n1.  **Diethyl Ether**: The maximum achievable concentration ($57.9\\%$) is vastly higher than the concentration required for anesthesia ($\\sim 2-3\\%$). While this high volatility means concentrations can rise quickly, ether's relatively low potency (high MAC) provides a wider margin of safety between the effective dose and a fatal overdose.\n2.  **Chloroform**: The maximum achievable concentration ($21.1\\%$) is also far in excess of the very low concentration needed for surgical anesthesia ($\\sim 1\\%$). However, chloroform is highly potent (low MAC) and has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between the anesthetic dose and a toxic dose is small. Cardiac toxicity and sudden death are known to occur at concentrations not far above the therapeutic range (e.g., above $2\\%$). The ability to easily generate a concentration of $21.1\\%$, more than $20$ times the required dose, with an imprecise technique like the open drop method, posed an extreme and often fatal risk of overdose. This physical property, combined with its cardiotoxicity, explains the numerous deaths associated with chloroform in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",

The physical scenario, while idealized, is a standard application of phase equilibrium principles. The provided data for temperature, pressures, and enthalpies of vaporization are physically realistic for the substances in question. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided (the universal gas constant $R$ is assumed known). The question is well-posed, asking for a specific, calculable outcome based on the given model and data. The language is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe relationship between the saturated vapor pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{sat}}$) of a liquid and its absolute temperature ($T$) is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. For a temperature change from $T_1$ to $T_2$, the integrated form of this equation is:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_2)}{P_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_1)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is the enthalpy of vaporization (assumed constant over this small temperature range), and $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the inspired anesthetic mole fraction, $x_{\\mathrm{anesthetic}}$, is equal to the saturated vapor mole fraction. For an ideal gas mixture at a total pressure $P_{\\mathrm{total}}$, the mole fraction of a component is the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure. Here, the partial pressure of the anesthetic is its saturated vapor pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{anesthetic}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{P_{\\mathrm{total}}} $$\nGiven $P_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{atm}$, the inspired mole fraction is numerically equal to the saturated vapor pressure expressed in atmospheres.\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{anesthetic}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{1\\,\\mathrm{atm}} $$\nThus, to find the new mole fraction at $T_2 = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, we must calculate the new saturated vapor pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_2)$, for each substance.\n\nThe temperature term in the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{293.15\\,\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{293.15 - 298.15}{293.15 \\times 298.15}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} = \\frac{-5}{87413.8225}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} \\approx -5.7197 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} $$\nSince both $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ and the term in parentheses are negative, the right-hand side of the equation is positive. This means $\\ln(P_2/P_1) > 0$, so $P_2 > P_1$. The vapor pressure, and thus the inspired concentration, will **increase** for both anesthetics, which is the expected physical behavior.\n\n**Calculation for Diethyl Ether:**\n- $P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_1) = 0.44\\,\\mathrm{atm}$\n- $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap,ether}} = 26\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 26000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_2)}{0.44}\\right) = -\\frac{26000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} \\left(-5.7197 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_2)}{0.44}\\right) \\approx 3127.24 \\times 5.7197 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 0.17887 $$\n$$ \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_2)}{0.44} = e^{0.17887} \\approx 1.1958 $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_2) \\approx 0.44 \\times 1.1958 \\approx 0.526\\,\\mathrm{atm} $$\nThe new inspired mole fraction is $\\approx 0.53$.

Both increase by roughly $20\\%$. Ether’s inspired mole fraction rises from about $0.44$ to $\\approx 0.52$; chloroform’s rises from about $0.21$ to $\\approx 0.26$.**\nThis option states that both concentrations increase, which is directionally correct. The predicted final mole fraction for chloroform ($\\approx 0.26$) exactly matches our calculation. The predicted final mole fraction for ether ($\\approx 0.52$) is extremely close to our calculated value of $\\approx 0.53$. The stated percentage increase of \"roughly $20\\%$\" is consistent with our calculations of $19.5\\%$ and $21.9\\%$. The minor discrepancy for ether can be attributed to using a common approximation, $\\Delta P \\approx P_1 (\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} / RT^2) \\Delta T$, which yields $P_{\\mathrm{sat,ether}}(T_2) \\approx 0.52\\,\\mathrm{atm}$. This option provides an excellent match to the physical prediction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both decrease because higher temperature reduces gas solubility near the interface; each drops by approximately $10\\%$.**\nThe premise is fundamentally flawed. Vapor pressure of a liquid increases with temperature, it does not decrease. The reasoning provided confuses evaporation with gas dissolution (Henry's Law), which is not the process described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Ether increases slightly (about $+5\\%$) to $\\approx 0.46$, while chloroform increases more (about $+30\\%$) to $\\approx 0.27$ because its normal boiling point is higher.**\nThe calculated percentage increases ($\\approx 20-22\\%$) and final mole fractions ($\\approx 0.53$ for ether, $\\approx 0.26$ for chloroform) do not match the values proposed in this option. The fractional change is indeed slightly larger for chloroform due to its higher $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$, but the magnitudes are incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Ether increases strongly (about $+50\\%$) to $\\approx 0.66$, while chloroform changes negligibly (to $\\approx 0.22$) because its vapor is denser.**\nThe calculated percentage increases ($\\approx 20-22\\%$) are significantly different from the \"strongly\" ($50\\%$) and \"negligibly\" values proposed. The final mole fractions are also incorrect. The reasoning based on vapor density is physically irrelevant to the temperature dependence of vapor pressure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both increase by the same absolute partial pressure increment of $\\approx 0.05\\,\\mathrm{atm}$, so their inspired mole fractions become $\\approx 0.49$ (ether) and $\\approx 0.26$ (chloroform).**\nThe absolute pressure increments are not equal. Our calculation shows $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ether}} \\approx 0.526 - 0.44 = 0.086\\,\\mathrm{atm}$ and $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{chloro}} \\approx 0.256 - 0.21 = 0.046\\,\\mathrm{atm}$. The change for ether is almost double that for chloroform. The premise of an equal increment is physically incorrect because the rate of change of pressure with temperature ($dP/dT$) is itself proportional to the pressure $P$. Since ether starts at a much higher pressure, its absolute increase is larger.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The probability of death from ignition given flames is the product of the probability of ignition and the conditional probability of death given ignition.\n$$ P(D_{ign}) = (p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}}) \\cdot q $$\nTherefore, the total expected harm for ether is:\n$$ \\text{Expected Harm (Ether)} = p_{E} + q \\cdot p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}} $$\n\n**Finding the Threshold $q^{*}$:**\nWe set the expected harms equal to each other:\n$$ \\text{Expected Harm (Chloroform)} = \\text{Expected Harm (Ether)} $$\n$$ p_{C} = p_{E} + q^{*} \\cdot p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}} $$\nNow, we solve for $q^{*}$:\n$$ q^{*} \\cdot p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}} = p_{C} - p_{E} $$\n$$ q^{*} = \\frac{p_{C} - p_{E}}{p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}}} $$\n\n**Substituting the given values:**\n- $p_{E} = 1/15000$\n- $p_{C} = 1/7000$\n- $p_{\\text{ign}} = 1/5000$\n- $p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}} = 1/2$\n\nNumerator:\n$$ p_{C} - p_{E} = \\frac{1}{7000} - \\frac{1}{15000} = \\frac{15}{105000} - \\frac{7}{105000} = \\frac{8}{105000} $$\n\nDenominator:\n$$ p_{\\text{ign}} \\cdot p_{\\text{death}\\mid \\text{ign}} = \\frac{1}{5000} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{10000} $$\n\nCalculation of $q^{*}$:\n$$ q^{*} = \\frac{8/105000}{1/10000} = \\frac{8}{105000} \\times 10000 = \\frac{80000}{105000} = \\frac{80}{105} = \\frac{16}{21} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$ q^{*} = 16 \\div 21 \\approx 0.76190476... $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $q^{*} = 0.7619$.\n\n**Interpretation:** If the surgeon believes the probability of open flames being used is greater than $\\approx 76.2\\%$, then chloroform is the safer choice based on this model. If the probability is less than this threshold, ether is the safer choice.",
