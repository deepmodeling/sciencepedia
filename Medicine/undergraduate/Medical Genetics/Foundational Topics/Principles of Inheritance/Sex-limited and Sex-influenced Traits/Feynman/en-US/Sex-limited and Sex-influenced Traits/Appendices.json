            "introduction": "This first exercise provides a foundational scenario to master the mechanics of sex-influenced inheritance. By applying given rules of dominance that differ between sexes to a simple cross, you will practice predicting how the same genotype can result in different phenotypes. This is a crucial first step in understanding how an individual's sex can modulate gene expression .",

            "problem": "In the fictional species of Crimson-Crested Sunlizard (*Solisaurus rubicrista*), the presence of a vibrant, inflatable throat pouch is a trait governed by a single gene with two alleles: the allele for pouch development ($P$) and the allele for no pouch ($p$). The expression of this trait is sex-influenced. In males, the allele for a pouch ($P$) is dominant over the allele for no pouch ($p$). In females, the allele for a pouch ($P$) is recessive to the allele for no pouch ($p$).\n\nA pure-breeding male lizard that displays a prominent throat pouch is crossed with a pure-breeding female lizard that completely lacks a pouch. Assuming a typical Mendelian inheritance pattern for the alleles, which of the following statements correctly describes the expected phenotypes of their first-generation (F1) offspring?\n\nA. All F1 offspring, both male and female, will have a throat pouch.\n\nB. All F1 offspring, both male and female, will lack a throat pouch.\n\nC. All F1 male offspring will lack a throat pouch, while all F1 female offspring will have a throat pouch.\n\nD. All F1 male offspring will have a throat pouch, while all F1 female offspring will lack a throat pouch.\n\nE. 50% of the male offspring will have a throat pouch, and 50% of the female offspring will have a throat pouch.\n\nF. All F1 offspring will have a pouch of intermediate size.",
            "solution": "The trait is sex-influenced with different dominance in the two sexes. In males, $P$ is dominant to $p$, so male phenotypes are: pouch for $PP$ or $Pp$, and no pouch for $pp$. In females, $P$ is recessive to $p$, so female phenotypes are: pouch only for $PP$, and no pouch for $Pp$ or $pp$.\n\nThe male parent is described as pure-breeding with a pouch. Pure-breeding implies homozygosity, and since a male with a pouch must carry at least one $P$, the male genotype is $PP$. The female parent is described as pure-breeding without a pouch. Pure-breeding again implies homozygosity, and in females the no-pouch phenotype occurs for $Pp$ or $pp$, but only $pp$ is homozygous, so the female genotype is $pp$.\n\nCrossing these parents gives:\n$$PP \\times pp \\rightarrow \\text{F1 all } Pp.$$\nThe gametes are $P$ from the male and $p$ from the female, so every F1 offspring is $Pp$.\n\nApplying the sex-influenced expression to the F1:\n- For F1 males with genotype $Pp$, because $P$ is dominant in males, they express a pouch.\n- For F1 females with genotype $Pp$, because $P$ is recessive in females, they do not express a pouch.\n\nTherefore, all F1 male offspring will have a throat pouch, and all F1 female offspring will lack a throat pouch, which corresponds to option D.",

            "introduction": "This problem challenges you to think like a geneticist by working backward from experimental data. Instead of being given the dominance relationship, you must deduce it from the distinct phenotypes observed in the male and female offspring of a cross. This exercise hones your deductive reasoning skills and deepens your understanding of how reciprocal crosses can reveal patterns of sex-influenced inheritance .",

            "problem": "In a species of Glimmerwing Moths, the wing pattern is determined by a single autosomal gene with two alleles, and its expression is sex-influenced. Two phenotypes are observed: striped and spotted. A geneticist performs a cross between a pure-breeding striped female and a pure-breeding spotted male. All of the resulting F1 sons are striped, and all of the F1 daughters are spotted. These F1 moths are then intercrossed to produce an F2 generation. Assuming an equal sex ratio in the F2 population, what proportion of all F2 offspring are expected to have the striped phenotype? Express your answer as a fraction.",
            "solution": "Let the single autosomal locus have two alleles: $T$ (biases striped) and $P$ (biases spotted). Because all F1 are heterozygous and yet F1 sons are striped while F1 daughters are spotted, the heterozygote $TP$ must express as striped in males and as spotted in females. This is the hallmark of sex-influenced dominance, with $T$ dominant in males and $P$ dominant in females.\n\nPure-breeding striped female implies she is homozygous $TT$ (in females, $TT$ is striped), and pure-breeding spotted male implies he is homozygous $PP$ (in males, $PP$ is spotted). The cross $TT$ (female) $\\times$ $PP$ (male) produces F1 all $TP$, consistent with F1 sons striped and F1 daughters spotted.\n\nIntercrossing F1 ($TP \\times TP$) yields the standard Mendelian genotypic ratio:\n$$\nP(TT)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(TP)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(PP)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nAssuming an equal sex ratio, sex is independent of genotype. Phenotypic expression by sex:\n- In males: $TT$ and $TP$ are striped; $PP$ is spotted.\n- In females: $TT$ is striped; $TP$ and $PP$ are spotted.\n\nTherefore, the overall proportion of striped F2 is\n$$\nP(\\text{striped})=P(TT)\\cdot 1 + P(TP)\\cdot P(\\text{male}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nEquivalently, among males (half the population), $\\frac{3}{4}$ are striped, contributing $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{8}$, and among females (half), $\\frac{1}{4}$ are striped, contributing $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{8}$; together $\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$.",

            "introduction": "Our final practice connects sex-influenced traits to the broader field of population genetics. Using phenotypic data from a population, you will apply the principles of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to calculate underlying allele frequencies and predict phenotypic distributions in the opposite sex. This demonstrates the power of integrating Mendelian concepts with population-level analysis to understand genetic patterns in nature .",

            "problem": "In a particular species of bird, the Golden-plumed Warbler, the coloration of the throat patch is determined by a single gene with two alleles, $C^G$ (for a gold patch) and $C^Y$ (for a yellow patch). The expression of this trait is sex-influenced. The gold allele ($C^G$) behaves as a dominant allele in males but as a recessive allele in females. A large, isolated population of these warblers is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for this gene.\n\nA field study is conducted on this population, and it is observed that 36% of the males have a yellow throat patch. Based on this information, what proportion of the females in this population are expected to have a gold throat patch?\n\nCalculate this proportion and express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let $p$ be the allele frequency of $C^{G}$ and $q$ be the allele frequency of $C^{Y}$, with $p+q=1$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies in each sex are $p^{2}$ for $C^{G}C^{G}$, $2pq$ for $C^{G}C^{Y}$, and $q^{2}$ for $C^{Y}C^{Y}$.\n\nIn males, $C^{G}$ is dominant, so the yellow phenotype occurs only for genotype $C^{Y}C^{Y}$ with frequency $q^{2}$. The observed male yellow proportion is $0.36$, hence\n$$\nq^{2}=0.36 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q=\\sqrt{0.36}=0.6, \\quad p=1-q=0.4.\n$$\nIn females, $C^{G}$ is recessive, so the gold phenotype occurs only for genotype $C^{G}C^{G}$ with frequency $p^{2}$. Therefore the expected proportion of females with a gold throat patch is\n$$\np^{2}=(0.4)^{2}=0.16.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.160$.",
