            "problem": "In medical genetics, an autosomal locus is a chromosomal position on a non-sex chromosome, and an allele is a variant form of a gene at a locus. For a single autosomal locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, suppose two individuals with genotypes $A/a$ and $A/a$ mate. By the Law of Segregation, each parent contributes one allele to a gamete such that the two alleles in a heterozygote segregate equally, and by random union of gametes at fertilization, zygote genotypes form according to the product of gamete probabilities. Assume complete penetrance of genotypes into phenotypes, and define a carrier as a heterozygote $A a$ for a recessive disease allele $a$.\n\nUsing only these foundational principles, derive the expected genotype proportions among the offspring for the genotypes $AA$, $A a$, and $a a$. Then, compute the probability that a randomly chosen offspring is a carrier (that is, has genotype $A a$). Express all proportions as exact fractions. Provide your final answer as a single row matrix whose entries, in order, are the proportions for $AA$, $A a$, and $a a$, followed by the carrier probability.

The two alleles in a heterozygote ($A a$) segregate equally.\n- **Principle 2 (Random Fertilization)**: Zygote genotypes form by the random union of gametes. The probability of a zygote genotype is the product of the probabilities of the constituent gametes.\n- **Penetrance**: Complete penetrance of genotypes into phenotypes is assumed.\n- **Definition**: A carrier is defined as a heterozygote, $A a$.\n- **Objective**: Derive the expected genotype proportions for $AA$, $A a$, and $a a$ among the offspring. Compute the probability that a randomly chosen offspring is a carrier.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is fundamentally based on the principles of Mendelian genetics, specifically the Law of Segregation and the concept of random fertilization. These are cornerstone principles of classical genetics. The terminology (autosomal, allele, genotype, heterozygote, carrier) is standard and correctly used. The setup is scientifically sound and realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is self-contained and provides all the necessary information and principles required to derive a unique solution. The question is unambiguous and asks for specific, computable quantities.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of offspring genotype proportions from a mating between two individuals with genotype $A a$. We will use the foundational principles stated in the problem.\n\nLet the two mating individuals be Parent $1$ and Parent $2$. Both have the genotype $A a$.\n\nAccording to the Law of Segregation, the two alleles in a heterozygote segregate equally into gametes. This means that for each parent, the probability of producing a gamete carrying the $A$ allele is equal to the probability of producing a gamete carrying the $a$ allele. Since there are only two possibilities, each probability must be $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor Parent $1$ (genotype $A a$):\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$: $P_1(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$: $P_1(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFor Parent $2$ (genotype $A a$):\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$: $P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$: $P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe problem states that zygote genotypes form by the random union of gametes, and the probability of a zygote's genotype is the product of the probabilities of the uniting gametes. We can now calculate the probabilities for each of the three possible offspring genotypes: $AA$, $A a$, and $a a$.\n\n1.  **Genotype $AA$**: This genotype results from the fusion of an $A$ gamete from Parent $1$ and an $A$ gamete from Parent $2$.\n    $$P(AA) = P_1(A) \\times P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n2.  **Genotype $aa$**: This genotype results from the fusion of an $a$ gamete from Parent $1$ and an $a$ gamete from Parent $2$.\n    $$P(aa) = P_1(a) \\times P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n3.  **Genotype $A a$**: This heterozygous genotype can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    - An $A$ gamete from Parent $1$ fuses with an $a$ gamete from Parent $2$. The probability of this event is $P_1(A) \\times P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    - An $a$ gamete from Parent $1$ fuses with an $A$ gamete from Parent $2$. The probability of this event is $P_1(a) \\times P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n    The total probability of forming an $A a$ zygote is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    $$P(A a) = (P_1(A) \\times P_2(a)) + (P_1(a) \\times P_2(A)) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe expected genotype proportions among the offspring are therefore:\n- Proportion of $AA$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- Proportion of $A a$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- Proportion of $aa$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThese proportions sum to $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nFinally, we must compute the probability that a randomly chosen offspring is a carrier. The problem defines a carrier as a heterozygote, which has the genotype $A a$. Therefore, the probability of an offspring being a carrier is equal to the probability of an offspring having the genotype $A a$.\n\n$$P(\\text{carrier}) = P(A a) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe final answer requires a single row matrix containing the proportions for $AA$, $A a$, $a a$, and the carrier probability, in that order. The values are $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{2}$.",

            "introduction": "While Mendelian laws elegantly describe inheritance within families, population genetics provides the framework for understanding allele and genotype frequencies on a much larger scale. This practice bridges that gap by exploring the foundational Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle.

Using first principles of probability and the definition of allele frequency, derive the expected genotype proportions among zygotes for the three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ in terms of the allele frequencies $p$ for $A$ and $q$ for $a$. Then, for a large, panmictic population in which the observed frequency of the $A$ allele is $p = 0.68$ (so $q = 1 - p$), compute the expected counts of $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ genotypes in a random sample of $N = 2500$ unrelated individuals under HWE.

Let $p$ denote the population allele frequency of the functional allele $A$ in gametes, and let $q$ denote the population allele frequency of the loss-of-function allele $a$ in gametes, with $p + q = 1$. Under HWE, zygotes form by random union of gametes, and the alleles contributed by the two parents are independent draws from the gamete pool.\n\nUsing the multiplication rule of probability for independent events, the probability that a zygote is homozygous $AA$ equals the probability that the gamete from one parent contributes $A$ and the gamete from the other parent contributes $A$, which is\n$$\nP(AA) = p \\times p = p^2.\n$$\nFor the heterozygote $Aa$, there are two mutually exclusive ways to obtain the genotype: the first parent contributes $A$ and the second contributes $a$, or the first contributes $a$ and the second contributes $A$. Each way has probability $p \\times q$, and by the addition rule for mutually exclusive events the total probability is\n$$\nP(Aa) = pq + qp = 2pq.\n$$\nSimilarly, the probability of homozygous $aa$ is\n$$\nP(aa) = q \\times q = q^2.\n$$\nThese are the HWE genotype proportions derived from first principles of independent gamete sampling.\n\nTo compute expected genotype counts in a sample of size $N$, multiply each genotype proportion by $N$. For the given parameters $p = 0.68$ and $N = 2500$, first compute $q$:\n$$\nq = 1 - p = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32.\n$$\nNow compute the genotype proportions:\n$p^2 = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624$, $2pq = 2 \\times 0.68 \\times 0.32 = 0.4352$, $q^2 = (0.32)^2 = 0.1024$.\nMultiply by $N = 2500$ to obtain expected counts:\n$$\nN \\times p^2 = 2500 \\times 0.4624 = 1156,\n$$\n$$\nN \\times 2pq = 2500 \\times 0.4352 = 1088,\n$$\n$$\nN \\times q^2 = 2500 \\times 0.1024 = 256.\n$$\nThus, the expected counts under HWE in the order $(AA, Aa, aa)$ are $(1156, 1088, 256)$.",

            "introduction": "In clinical genetics, interpreting the impact of multiple genetic variants requires more than just knowing they are present; it often demands knowing their arrangement on the chromosomes. This practice introduces the critical concept of \"phase\"—whether two alleles are on the same chromosome (cis) or on opposite homologs (trans). This exercise hones your logical deduction skills by tasking you with inferring the phase of two variants by analyzing their transmission from parents to a child, a common and essential task in genetic counseling and diagnostics .",

            "problem": "An autosomal gene $G$ harbors two single nucleotide variants (Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV)) at distinct loci, denoted $v_1$ and $v_2$. In a patient (the proband), both loci are heterozygous: the proband’s genotype at these loci is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, where $+$ denotes the reference allele. In medical genetics, the “phase” of two heterozygous variants refers to whether the two variant alleles are located on the same homologous chromosome (“cis”) or on opposite homologous chromosomes (“trans”). Determining phase affects interpretation of autosomal recessive disease, because two pathogenic variants in trans can constitute compound heterozygosity for loss of function, whereas two variants in cis may be inherited together on the same chromosome copy and not yield biallelic loss.\n\nUse the following fundamental base to reason about phase inference:\n- Mendelian segregation: in meiosis, each gamete receives exactly one homolog of each autosome; therefore, each child receives one allele at each locus from the mother and one allele at each locus from the father.\n- A haplotype is the ordered pair of alleles on the same homolog across loci; a gamete carries one haplotype from a parent. In the absence of de novo mutation, a child’s alleles at a locus must be traceable to parental alleles by transmission.\n- Assume $v_1$ and $v_2$ reside within the same gene such that meiotic recombination between them within a single gamete is negligible for inference. No de novo mutation is occurring.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly infer the proband’s phase (cis versus trans) from the trio genotypes described:\n\nA. In a trio where the proband is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, the mother is $v_1/+ ; +/+$, and the father is $+/+ ; v_2/+$, the proband’s $v_1$ and $v_2$ are in trans.\n\nB. In a trio where the proband is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, the mother is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, and the father is $+/+ ; +/+$, the proband’s $v_1$ and $v_2$ are in cis.\n\nC. In a trio where both parents are $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$ and the proband is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, the phase of the proband’s variants can be deduced to be trans by Mendelian logic alone.\n\nD. In a trio where the proband is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, the mother is $+/+ ; +/+$, and the father is $v_1/+ ; v_2/v_2$, the proband’s $v_1$ and $v_2$ are in cis.\n\nE. In a trio where the proband is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$, the mother is $v_1/+ ; +/+$, and the father is $+/+ ; v_2/v_2$, the proband’s $v_1$ and $v_2$ are in trans.\n\nChoose all that apply.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is sound. It is a well-posed problem in Mendelian genetics, utilizing standard terminology and principles for phase inference in a trio (proband and parents). The assumptions of no de novo mutation and negligible recombination between the two intragenic variant loci are explicitly stated, which allows for deterministic logical inference.\n\nThe proband's genotype is given as $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$. This means the proband's two homologous chromosomes carrying gene $G$ have one of two possible configurations (phases) for the alleles at loci $1$ and $2$:\n1.  **Cis phase:** The two variants are on the same chromosome. The proband's two haplotypes are $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(+, +)$.\n2.  **Trans phase:** The two variants are on opposite chromosomes. The proband's two haplotypes are $(v_1, +)$ and $(+, v_2)$.\n\nThe task is to determine, for each scenario, whether the parental genotypes allow for an unambiguous inference of the proband's phase. We will analyze each case by determining the haplotypes transmitted from each parent. A haplotype is the set of alleles on a single chromosome copy, written here as an ordered pair (allele at locus $1$, allele at locus $2$).\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n-   Proband genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n-   Mother's genotype: $v_1/+ ; +/+$\n-   Father's genotype: $+/+ ; v_2/+$\n\n1.  **Mother's Haplotypes:** The mother has alleles $\\{v_1, +\\}$ at locus $1$ and $\\{+, +\\}$ at locus $2$. Due to the homozygosity at locus $2$, her two haplotypes must be $(v_1, +)$ and $(+, +)$. She can transmit either of these to her child.\n2.  **Father's Haplotypes:** The father has alleles $\\{+, +\\}$ at locus $1$ and $\\{v_2, +\\}$ at locus $2$. Due to the homozygosity at locus $1$, his two haplotypes must be $(+, v_2)$ and $(+, +)$. He can transmit either of these.\n3.  **Inference of Transmission:** The proband has the allele $v_1$. The mother is the only parent with a $v_1$ allele, so she must have transmitted the haplotype containing it, which is $(v_1, +)$. The proband also has the allele $v_2$. The father is the only parent with a $v_2$ allele, so he must have transmitted the haplotype containing it, which is $(+, v_2)$.\n4.  **Proband's Phase:** The proband's genotype is constituted by the inherited haplotypes $(v_1, +)$ from the mother and $(+, v_2)$ from the father.

His only possible haplotype is $(+, +)$. He must transmit this haplotype to the proband.\n2.  **Inference of Transmission:** The proband inherited one haplotype, $(+, +)$, from the father. The proband's genotype is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$. To form this genotype, the other haplotype (inherited from the mother) must supply the alleles not provided by the father's haplotype. The father contributed $(+, +)$, so the mother must have contributed the alleles $v_1$ and $v_2$. Thus, the maternal haplotype must be $(v_1, v_2)$.\n3.  **Proband's Phase:** The proband's genotype is constituted by the haplotypes $(v_1, v_2)$ from the mother and $(+, +)$ from the father. With both variants on the same homologous chromosome, the phase is **cis**. (This also implies the mother's genotype must have been in the cis phase).\n\nThe statement that the proband's variants are in cis is **Correct**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n-   Proband genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n-   Mother's genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n-   Father's genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n\n1.  **Parental Haplotypes:** Both parents are heterozygous at both loci ($v_1/+ ; v_2/+$). The phase of the variants in each parent is unknown. A parent could be in cis, with haplotypes $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(+, +)$, or in trans, with haplotypes $(v_1, +)$ and $(+, v_2)$.\n2.  **Possible Scenarios for Proband's Phase:**\n    -   **Could the proband be trans?** Yes. A trans proband has haplotypes $(v_1, +)$ and $(+, v_2)$. This can occur if, for example, both parents are in trans. The mother could transmit $(v_1, +)$ and the father could transmit $(+, v_2)$.\n    -   **Could the proband be cis?** Yes. A cis proband has haplotypes $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(+, +)$. This can occur if, for example, both parents are in cis. The mother could transmit $(v_1, v_2)$ and the father could transmit $(+, +)$.\n3.  **Inference of Transmission:** Since the parental phases are not given, multiple inheritance scenarios are possible, leading to different phases in the proband. For example, if both parents happen to be trans, they can produce a trans child. If both parents happen to be cis, they can produce a cis child. Without further information (e.g., genotyping of grandparents or other children), the proband's phase cannot be determined.\n\nThe statement that the phase can be deduced to be trans by Mendelian logic alone is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n-   Proband genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n-   Mother's genotype: $+/+ ; +/+$\n-   Father's genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/v_2$\n\n1.  **Mother's Haplotypes:** The mother is homozygous for the reference allele at both loci. Her only possible haplotype is $(+, +)$. She must transmit this haplotype to the proband.\n2.  **Inference of Transmission:** The proband inherited one haplotype, $(+, +)$, from the mother. The proband's genotype is $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$. To form this genotype, the other haplotype (inherited from the father) must supply the alleles not provided by the mother's haplotype, which are $v_1$ and $v_2$. Thus, the paternal haplotype must be $(v_1, v_2)$.\n3.  **Proband's Phase:** The proband's genotype is constituted by the haplotypes $(v_1, v_2)$ from the father and $(+, +)$ from the mother. With both variants on the same homologous chromosome, the phase is **cis**.\n4.  **Consistency Check:** The father's genotype is $v_1/+ ; v_2/v_2$. His alleles are $\\{v_1, +\\}$ at locus $1$ and $\\{v_2, v_2\\}$ at locus $2$. His haplotypes must be $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(+, v_2)$. He can indeed transmit the $(v_1, v_2)$ haplotype. The scenario is consistent.\n\nThe statement that the proband's variants are in cis is **Correct**.\n\n**Option E Analysis**\n-   Proband genotype: $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$\n-   Mother's genotype: $v_1/+ ; +/+$\n-   Father's genotype: $+/+ ; v_2/v_2$\n\n1.  **Mother's Haplotypes:** The mother has alleles $\\{v_1, +\\}$ at locus $1$ and $\\{+, +\\}$ at locus $2$. Her haplotypes must be $(v_1, +)$ and $(+, +)$.\n2.  **Father's Haplotypes:** The father has alleles $\\{+, +\\}$ at locus $1$ and $\\{v_2, v_2\\}$ at locus $2$. He is homozygous at both loci (homozygous reference at locus $1$, homozygous variant at locus $2$). His only possible haplotype is $(+, v_2)$. He must transmit this haplotype.\n3.  **Inference of Transmission:** The proband inherited the haplotype $(+, v_2)$ from the father. To form the proband's $v_1/+ ; v_2/+$ genotype, the haplotype from the mother must provide the remaining alleles. The proband needs a $v_1$ allele for locus $1$ and a $+$ allele for locus $2$. Thus, the maternal haplotype must be $(v_1, +)$.\n4.  **Proband's Phase:** The proband's genotype is constituted by the inherited haplotypes $(v_1, +)$ from the mother and $(+, v_2)$ from the father. With the variants on opposite homologous chromosomes, the phase is **trans**.\n\nThe statement that the proband's variants are in trans is **Correct**.",
