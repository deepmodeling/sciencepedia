The linear model for height is a simplification, but it is explicitly defined for the purpose of this quantitative problem and does not contradict scientific principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated, provides all necessary data and a well-defined model, and asks for a specific, computable quantity.

This difference, $\\Delta H$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta H = H(n_{47,XXY}) - H(n_{45,X}) $$\nwhere $n_{47,XXY}$ and $n_{45,X}$ are the number of actively expressed copies of the SHOX gene for the respective karyotypes.\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of $n$ for each karyotype based on the provided biological principles. The problem states that the SHOX gene is in a pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and that PAR genes are expressed from every sex chromosome (X and Y) that carries them. This implies that the number of active SHOX gene copies, $n$, is equal to the total number of sex chromosomes in the individual's karyotype.\n\nFor an individual with karyotype $47,\\mathrm{XXY}$ (Klinefelter syndrome), there are three sex chromosomes: two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome.

Therefore, the number of active SHOX copies is:\n$$ n_{45,X} = 1 $$\n\nNow, we use the given quantitative model for height, $H(n) = H_{2} + \\beta(n - 2)$, with the provided parameters $H_{2} = 170\\,\\text{cm}$ and $\\beta = 6\\,\\text{cm}$.\n\nThe predicted average height for an individual with karyotype $47,\\mathrm{XXY}$ is:\n$$ H(n_{47,XXY}) = H(3) = H_{2} + \\beta(3 - 2) = H_{2} + \\beta $$\n\nThe predicted average height for an individual with karyotype $45,\\mathrm{X}$ is:\n$$ H(n_{45,X}) = H(1) = H_{2} + \\beta(1 - 2) = H_{2} - \\beta $$\n\nThe height difference, $\\Delta H$, is the difference between these two predicted heights:\n$$ \\Delta H = H(n_{47,XXY}) - H(n_{45,X}) = (H_{2} + \\beta) - (H_{2} - \\beta) $$\n$$ \\Delta H = H_{2} + \\beta - H_{2} + \\beta $$\n$$ \\Delta H = 2\\beta $$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $\\beta = 6\\,\\text{cm}$:\n$$ \\Delta H = 2 \\times 6\\,\\text{cm} = 12\\,\\text{cm} $$\n\nThe predicted height difference between an average individual with karyotype $47,\\mathrm{XXY}$ and an average individual with karyotype $45,\\mathrm{X}$ is $12\\,\\text{cm}$.",

The assumptions provided—proportionality between transcription and RNA abundance, and additivity of allelic expression—are standard, simplifying assumptions used in quantitative biological modeling.

It is free from subjectivity and ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as factual unsoundness, non-formalizability, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility. It is a standard quantitative reasoning problem in genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to determine the female-to-male steady-state RNA abundance ratio, $R$, for a given X-linked gene. We proceed by formalizing the transcriptional output for males and females based on the provided assumptions.\n\nLet $C$ be the baseline transcriptional output from a single, fully active X-linked allele, as per assumption (iii). This constant represents a normalized quantity of transcript produced per unit time.\n\nFirst, we determine the total transcriptional output for a male. A male possesses a single X chromosome. According to the problem statement, the allele on this chromosome is expressed at the full baseline output. Let $T_M$ denote the total transcriptional output in a male.\n$$T_M = C$$\n\nNext, we determine the total transcriptional output for a female. A female possesses two X chromosomes: one active (Xa) and one inactive (Xi).\n- The allele on the active X chromosome, Xa, is expressed at the full baseline output, which is $C$.\n- The allele on the inactive X chromosome, Xi, partially escapes inactivation. Its transcriptional output is a fraction $f$ of the baseline output. This contribution is therefore $f \\times C$.\n\nAccording to assumption (ii), the total transcriptional output is additive. Let $T_F$ denote the total transcriptional output in a female. It is the sum of the outputs from the allele on Xa and the allele on Xi.\n$$T_F = C + (f \\times C)$$\nWe can factor out the constant $C$:\n$$T_F = C(1 + f)$$\n\nNow, we relate transcriptional output to steady-state RNA abundance. Assumption (i) states that steady-state RNA abundance, let's call it $A$, is proportional to the transcriptional output, $T$. We can write this relationship using a proportionality constant, $k$.\n$$A = k \\times T$$\nThis constant $k$ encapsulates factors such as RNA degradation rates and is assumed to be the same for the gene product in both males and females.\n\nThe steady-state RNA abundance in a male, $A_M$, is:\n$$A_M = k \\times T_M = k \\times C$$\n\nThe steady-state RNA abundance in a female, $A_F$, is:\n$$A_F = k \\times T_F = k \\times C(1+f)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the female-to-male steady-state RNA abundance ratio, $R$. This is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{A_F}{A_M}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_F$ and $A_M$:\n$$R = \\frac{k \\times C(1+f)}{k \\times C}$$\nThe constants $k$ and $C$ are non-zero and cancel out from the numerator and denominator, which is expected for a dimensionless ratio. This leaves the final expression for $R$ purely in terms of the escape fraction $f$.\n$$R = 1 + f$$\nThis result is consistent with the biological context. If the gene does not escape inactivation ($f=0$), then $R=1$, indicating perfect dosage compensation. If the gene completely escapes inactivation ($f=1$), then $R=2$, indicating that females have a gene dosage twice that of males, as if both X chromosomes were fully active for this gene. For partial escape ($0 < f < 1$), the ratio lies between $1$ and $2$.",
