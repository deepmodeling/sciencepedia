            "introduction": "Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism that allows a single gene to produce multiple distinct proteins. However, for a spliced mRNA to be translated into a functional protein, it must maintain the correct translational reading frame. This exercise  explores the critical relationship between the length of a spliced exon and the integrity of the genetic code, a concept known as the 'in-frame' rule. Understanding this rule is essential for predicting the functional consequences of alternative splicing events and splicing-related mutations.",

            "problem": "The gene `G1` in a eukaryotic organism codes for a structural protein. Its primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains five exons. Through alternative splicing, two different mature mRNA molecules are produced in the cell. The first, `mRNA-A`, represents the canonical transcript containing all five exons. The second, `mRNA-B`, is an isoform where exon 3 is precisely skipped, causing exon 2 to be joined directly to exon 4. Analysis reveals that the skipped exon 3 is exactly 63 nucleotides long. Both `mRNA-A` and `mRNA-B` are stable and successfully translated into `Protein-A` and `Protein-B`, respectively. The start codon for translation is located in exon 1 and the stop codon is located in exon 5.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of `Protein-B` compared to `Protein-A`?\n\nA. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by 21 amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids coded by exons 4 and 5 will be identical to that in `Protein-A`.\n\nB. The splicing event that creates `mRNA-B` will cause a shift in the translational reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence for the part of the protein coded by exons 4 and 5, likely resulting in a severely truncated protein.\n\nC. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by exactly 63 amino acids.\n\nD. The ribosome will be unable to translate `mRNA-B` past the novel junction between exon 2 and exon 4, resulting in a very short, non-functional protein fragment containing only the amino acids coded by exons 1 and 2.\n\nE. The amino acid sequence of `Protein-B` will be identical to `Protein-A` because the splicing machinery automatically inserts filler nucleotides to preserve the reading frame.",
            "solution": "The genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets (codons), so translation proceeds in a fixed reading frame determined by the start codon in exon 1. A deletion or insertion that changes the coding sequence by a number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 causes a frameshift; conversely, removal of a segment whose length is a multiple of 3 preserves the reading frame.\n\nLet the length of exon 3 be $L_{E3}=63$ nucleotides. Since each codon has length $c=3$ nucleotides, the number of codons encoded by exon 3 is\n$$\nn_{\\Delta}=\\frac{L_{E3}}{c}=\\frac{63}{3}=21.\n$$\nSkipping exon 3 therefore removes exactly $21$ codons from the open reading frame without altering the downstream reading frame, because\n$$\nL_{E3}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nThus, the length of Protein-B relative to Protein-A satisfies\n$$\nN_{B}=N_{A}-21,\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ and $N_{B}$ are the amino acid lengths of Protein-A and Protein-B, respectively. Because the reading frame is preserved, the codon boundaries at the exon 2–exon 4 junction align with the original frame, and the codon sequences in exons 4 and 5 are identical to those in the canonical mRNA-A. The start codon in exon 1 and stop codon in exon 5 remain correctly positioned in-frame, so translation proceeds normally through exons 4 and 5 with unchanged amino acid sequence in those regions.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is correct: Protein-B is shorter by $21$ amino acids, and the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 4 and 5 are identical to Protein-A.\n- Option B is incorrect because there is no frameshift when $63$ nucleotides (a multiple of $3$) are removed.\n- Option C is incorrect because $63$ nucleotides correspond to $21$ amino acids, not $63$ amino acids.\n- Option D is incorrect because ribosomes translate contiguous codons across exon-exon junctions; the junction does not impede translation when the frame is preserved.\n- Option E is incorrect because the splicing machinery does not insert filler nucleotides; frame preservation here results from the exon length being a multiple of $3$.",

            "introduction": "The accuracy of splicing depends on the precise recognition of sequence signals at intron-exon boundaries by the spliceosome. This practice  delves into the molecular mechanics of 3' splice site selection, using a hypothetical scenario where a mutation creates a new 'cryptic' splice site. By analyzing the interplay between the polypyrimidine tract and the scanning mechanism for the terminal `AG` dinucleotide, you can predict how the cell might misinterpret these signals, a common mechanism underlying many genetic diseases.",

            "problem": "A gene harbors a variant that creates an `AG` dinucleotide located upstream of the authentic $3'$ splice site in the terminal portion of an intron. The intron’s acceptor region otherwise possesses a strong polypyrimidine tract (PPT) and an intact branchpoint adenine. Based on the mechanistic recognition of acceptor sites during pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) splicing in humans, predict the likelihood that the spliceosome will shift the acceptor to the newly created upstream `AG`, and infer the expected impact on the protein-coding reading frame should this alternative acceptor be used within a coding exon. Use only the following foundational bases: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), consensus-driven splice site recognition involving branchpoint, PPT, and terminal `AG`, and the triplet codon nature of translation.\n\nWhich option best reflects the most likely outcome?\n\nA. High likelihood of acceptor shift to the new upstream `AG` because a strong PPT stabilizes acceptor definition; this would extend the exon at its $5'$ end by inclusion of intronic nucleotides and has a high risk of disrupting the reading frame unless the added length is a multiple of $3$.\n\nB. Low likelihood of acceptor shift because an `AG` alone is insufficient without a branchpoint mutation; splicing remains at the authentic $3'$ site and the reading frame is preserved.\n\nC. High likelihood of acceptor shift, but the outcome would be exon skipping rather than exon extension; the reading frame of the downstream exon would therefore remain intact.\n\nD. Moderate likelihood of acceptor shift, but preferential use of a downstream `AG` is expected; this would truncate the exon’s $5'$ end and typically preserve the reading frame by removing nucleotides in multiples of $3$.",
            "solution": "The removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts is performed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. The accurate recognition of intron boundaries is critical for producing a correct mature mRNA sequence. The 3' end of an intron, also known as the acceptor site, is defined by three main sequence elements, recognized in order from 5' to 3':\n1.  **The Branchpoint Site (BPS):** An adenine nucleotide, located typically 18-40 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice junction, which performs the first nucleophilic attack in the splicing reaction. The problem states this is intact.\n2.  **The Polypyrimidine Tract (PPT):** A stretch of pyrimidine-rich (uracil and cytosine) nucleotides located between the BPS and the 3' splice junction. It is bound by the splicing factor U2 auxiliary factor 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65), a key step in defining the acceptor site. The problem states the PPT is strong, which implies a high affinity for U2AF65.\n3.  **The `AG` Acceptor Dinucleotide:** A nearly invariant `AG` sequence at the extreme 3' end of the intron. It is recognized by the U2AF35 kDa subunit (U2AF35).\n\nThe established mechanism for 3' splice site selection involves a scanning process. After the branchpoint is recognized and the U2AF65 protein is bound to the PPT, the splicing machinery searches in the 3' direction (downstream) for the first `AG` dinucleotide it encounters. The binding of U2AF65 to a strong PPT, as specified in the problem, robustly recruits the splicing machinery to this region, making the subsequent scan for an `AG` highly efficient.\n\nThe problem states that a variant has created a new `AG` dinucleotide *upstream* of the authentic `AG` site. The sequence context is therefore: `... Intron ... [Branchpoint A] ... [Strong PPT] ... [new upstream AG] ... [authentic downstream AG][Exon] ...`.\n\nGiven the scanning model, the new, upstream `AG` is the first such dinucleotide that the spliceosome component U2AF35 will encounter after the PPT. Due to this positional advantage and the stable anchoring provided by U2AF65 on the strong PPT, there is a **high likelihood** that the spliceosome will select this new cryptic `AG` as the acceptor site.\n\nNext, we infer the impact on the protein. If the new upstream `AG` is used, the spliceosome will cut the pre-mRNA at this new site. The intronic sequence between the new `AG` and the authentic `AG` will fail to be excised and will be retained in the mature mRNA. This event constitutes an **extension of the downstream exon at its 5' end** by the inclusion of what was formerly intronic sequence.\n\nAccording to the Central Dogma, this altered mRNA is a template for protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in codons, which are non-overlapping triplets of nucleotides. Let the length of the newly included intronic sequence be $L$ nucleotides. For the translational reading frame to be preserved, $L$ must be an integer multiple of 3. However, the position of the mutation creating the new `AG` is not biologically constrained to satisfy this condition. The length $L$ can be considered a random integer. The probability that $L \\pmod 3 = 0$ is approximately $1/3$, while the probability that $L \\pmod 3 \\neq 0$ is $2/3$. Therefore, there is a **high risk** (a $2/3$ probability) that the inclusion of this new sequence will cause a frameshift mutation. A frameshift typically alters all downstream codons and often leads to the creation of a premature termination codon (PTC), resulting in a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. High likelihood of acceptor shift to the new upstream `AG` because a strong PPT stabilizes acceptor definition; this would extend the exon at its $5'$ end by inclusion of intronic nucleotides and has a high risk of disrupting the reading frame unless the added length is a multiple of $3$.**\n- This option correctly states a **high likelihood** of acceptor shift, consistent with the scanning model favoring the first `AG` downstream of a strong PPT.\n- The reason provided, that a strong PPT stabilizes acceptor definition, is mechanistically correct.\n- The consequence, **exon extension at the 5' end** due to inclusion of intronic nucleotides, is also correct.\n- The impact on the reading frame, a **high risk of disruption** unless the added length is a multiple of 3, is a direct and accurate consequence of the triplet nature of the genetic code.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Low likelihood of acceptor shift because an `AG` alone is insufficient without a branchpoint mutation; splicing remains at the authentic $3'$ site and the reading frame is preserved.**\n- This option incorrectly claims a **low likelihood**. The \"first `AG` rule\" makes the shift highly probable.\n- The reasoning that a branchpoint mutation is required is incorrect. The existing intact branchpoint is sufficient to initiate the process; it is the new `AG` that alters the final choice of cut site.\n- The conclusion that splicing remains at the authentic site is therefore unlikely.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. High likelihood of acceptor shift, but the outcome would be exon skipping rather than exon extension; the reading frame of the downstream exon would therefore remain intact.**\n- While the **high likelihood** part is correct, this option misidentifies the molecular outcome. The mutation affects the boundary of an exon, leading to the inclusion of adjacent intronic sequence (intron retention/exon extension). **Exon skipping** is a different phenomenon where an entire exon is omitted from the final transcript, which is not the direct and primary result of this type of acceptor site mutation.\n- The statement about the reading frame is tied to the incorrect premise of exon skipping.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Moderate likelihood of acceptor shift, but preferential use of a downstream `AG` is expected; this would truncate the exon’s $5'$ end and typically preserve the reading frame by removing nucleotides in multiples of $3$.**\n- This option incorrectly suggests **preferential use of a downstream `AG`**. The scanning model predicts the opposite: preference for the first, upstream `AG`.\n- The consequence of **exon truncation** is the opposite of what occurs; the exon is extended.\n- The claim that the reading frame is \"typically\" preserved is unsubstantiated and contrary to probability. There is no known mechanism that ensures cryptic splice site mutations generate insertions/deletions in multiples of 3.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A cassette exon in a gene is evaluated under two cellular conditions for alternative splicing using ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq). For each condition, reads uniquely mapping to junctions that represent exon inclusion and exon skipping are reported. Assume the following foundational principles: according to the Central Dogma, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed into precursor messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA), which undergoes splicing to produce mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA); alternative splicing yields isoforms that include or skip exons. Under standard quantification assumptions for RNA-seq junction analysis, junction read counts are proportional to isoform abundances, and when effective junction lengths are comparable and coverage is approximately uniform, proportionality constants cancel in ratios.\n\nDefine Percent Spliced In (PSI, $\\Psi$) for a cassette exon as the fraction of the included isoform abundance among the total abundance of included-plus-excluded isoforms.
