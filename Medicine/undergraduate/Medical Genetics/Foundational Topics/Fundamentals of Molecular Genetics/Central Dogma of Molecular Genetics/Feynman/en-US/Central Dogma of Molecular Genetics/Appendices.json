            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state protein abundance within a simplified two-stage model of gene expression and its subsequent numerical calculation. The process begins by formalizing the given assumptions into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n\nLet $m(t)$ be the number of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecules and $p(t)$ be the number of protein molecules at time $t$.\n\nThe rate of change of mRNA molecules, $\\frac{dm}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between its production (transcription) and its removal (degradation).\nThe transcription process is assumed to occur at a constant rate, $k_{tx}$. This is a zero-order production term.\nThe degradation of mRNA is a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the current number of mRNA molecules, $m(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{deg,m}$.\nThus, the first ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = k_{tx} - k_{deg,m} m(t)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the rate of change of protein molecules, $\\frac{dp}{dt}$, is determined by its production (translation) and removal (degradation).\nThe translation process synthesizes protein from mRNA templates. Its rate is assumed to be proportional to the number of available mRNA molecules, $m(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{tl}$.\nThe degradation of the protein is also a first-order process, with a rate proportional to the protein abundance $p(t)$ and a rate constant $k_{deg,p}$.\nThus, the second ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp(t)}{dt} = k_{tl} m(t) - k_{deg,p} p(t)\n$$\n\nThe steady state of the system is defined as the condition where the numbers of mRNA and protein molecules no longer change with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dp}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nLet $M^{*}$ and $P^{*}$ denote the steady-state abundances of mRNA and protein, respectively.\nFrom the first ODE at steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{tx} - k_{deg,m} M^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $M^{*}$ yields:\n$$\nM^{*} = \\frac{k_{tx}}{k_{deg,m}}\n$$\n\nFrom the second ODE at steady state, and substituting $M^{*}$ for $m(t)$:\n$$\n0 = k_{tl} M^{*} - k_{deg,p} P^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $P^{*}$ yields:\n$$\nP^{*} = \\frac{k_{tl} M^{*}}{k_{deg,p}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $M^{*}$ into the equation for $P^{*}$ to obtain the final symbolic solution in terms of the fundamental rate constants:\n$$\nP^{*} = \\frac{k_{tl}}{k_{deg,p}} \\left( \\frac{k_{tx}}{k_{deg,m}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{tx} k_{tl}}{k_{deg,m} k_{deg,p}}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to calculate the numerical values of the degradation rate constants, $k_{deg,m}$ and $k_{deg,p}$, from their respective half-lives, using the provided formula $k_{deg} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$. It is crucial to maintain consistent time units. The rates $k_{tx}$ and $k_{tl}$ are given in units of $\\text{min}^{-1}$, so we will use minutes as the time unit.\n\nFor mRNA:\nThe half-life is $t_{1/2,m} = 15\\,\\text{min}$.\nThe degradation rate constant is:\n$$\nk_{deg,m} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,m}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{15}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor protein:\nThe half-life is $t_{1/2,p} = 5\\,\\text{h}$.

            "solution": "**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Part 1: Translation error rate per amino acid incorporation**\n\nThe problem asks for the translation error rate per amino acid incorporation under the condition of increased mischarging. The problem statement provides the following key definitions:\n1.  The probability that a charged tRNA carries an incorrect amino acid due to aaRS mischarging is $p$.\n2.  Other sources of translational error are negligible, so the per-residue misincorporation probability equals $p$.\n\nThe \"translation error rate per amino acid incorporation\" is by definition the per-residue misincorporation probability.

It is more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: a protein having zero misincorporations. A protein has zero misincorporations if and only if every amino acid from position $1$ to position $L$ is incorporated correctly.\n\nThe probability of a correct incorporation at a single position is $P(\\text{correct}) = 1 - p$.\nSince the events at each position are independent, the probability of $L$ consecutive correct incorporations is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{zero misincorporations}) = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - p) \\quad (L \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(\\text{zero misincorporations}) = (1 - p)^L$$\n\nThe fraction of proteins with at least one misincorporation is $1$ minus the fraction of proteins with zero misincorporations:\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) = 1 - P(\\text{zero misincorporations})$$\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) = 1 - (1 - p)^L$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values $p = 10^{-2} = 0.01$ and $L = 500$:\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) = 1 - (1 - 0.01)^{500}$$\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) = 1 - (0.99)^{500}$$\n\nWe calculate the value of $(0.99)^{500}$:\n$$(0.99)^{500} \\approx 0.0065704807$$\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) \\approx 1 - 0.0065704807$$\n$$P(\\text{at least one misincorporation}) \\approx 0.9934295193$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "A patient harbors a single-nucleotide variant in a multi-exon gene that introduces a premature termination codon in the penultimate exon. The premature stop lies $80$ nucleotides (nt) upstream of the last exon–exon junction. In mammalian cells, during the pioneer round of translation, exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited upstream of exon–exon junctions and are normally removed by ribosomes traversing the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). If a ribosome terminates prematurely with one or more EJC remaining downstream, the surveillance pathway Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) can be engaged via core factors including Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). In the context of the central dogma (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to mRNA to protein), predict whether NMD will be engaged for this variant and propose a rigorous experimental strategy using UPF1 small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) knockdown to validate your prediction, including the expected direction of change in the mutant transcript and an appropriate readout such as quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\nWhich option most accurately states the prediction and validation plan?\n\nA.

            "solution": "**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe central dogma describes the flow of genetic information from Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to protein. NMD is a critical mRNA surveillance pathway that ensures the fidelity of this process by degrading transcripts containing PTCs, thereby preventing the synthesis of potentially deleterious truncated proteins.\n\nThe canonical mechanism of NMD in mammalian cells is EJC-dependent. During pre-mRNA splicing, EJCs are deposited approximately $20-24$ nt upstream of each newly formed exon-exon junction. In the initial \"pioneer\" round of translation, the ribosome traverses the mRNA and displaces these EJCs.\n\nA key rule governing NMD activation is the \"50-55 nucleotide rule\". If a termination codon is located more than $50$ to $55$ nt upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction, the terminating ribosome will disengage from the mRNA before it can displace the EJC associated with that junction. The persistence of this downstream EJC serves as a flag for aberrancy. The EJC, in conjunction with the stalled ribosome, recruits the core NMD factor UPF1, an RNA helicase and ATPase. UPF1 then orchestrates the assembly of the full decay complex, leading to the rapid degradation of the faulty mRNA transcript.\n\nIn the given problem, the PTC is located $80$ nt upstream of the last exon–exon junction. Since $80 > 55$, the PTC satisfies the condition for triggering EJC-dependent NMD. Therefore, the prediction is that the mutant mRNA transcript will be recognized as a substrate for NMD and will be actively degraded.\n\nTo validate this prediction, a direct experimental test is required. The most rigorous approach is to inhibit the NMD pathway and observe the effect on the abundance of the target transcript.\n1.  **Inhibition of NMD:** UPF1 is the master regulator of NMD. Its functional removal effectively disables the pathway. A standard and specific method to achieve this is via RNA interference, using an siRNA designed to target and degrade UPF1 mRNA. A non-targeting control siRNA is used in a parallel experiment to control for off-target effects of the transfection and siRNA machinery.\n2.  **Quantification of mRNA:** The effect of NMD inhibition is a change in the steady-state level of the target mRNA. qRT-PCR is the gold-standard technique for precise quantification of specific mRNA transcripts. Primers must be designed to specifically amplify the mutant transcript. Using primers that span an exon-exon junction is a best practice to ensure that the template is spliced mRNA, not contaminating genomic DNA.\n3.  **Expected Outcome:** If the mutant transcript is indeed an NMD target, inhibiting NMD via UPF1 knockdown will abrogate its degradation. This will lead to an **increase** in the steady-state abundance, and consequently a longer measured half-life, of the mutant mRNA in the UPF1 siRNA-treated cells compared to the control siRNA-treated cells. The corresponding wild-type transcript, lacking a PTC, is not a direct NMD substrate and its levels should remain largely unaffected.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. NMD will be engaged. Knock down UPF1 with siRNA, then quantify mutant and wild-type mRNA by qRT-PCR using junction-spanning primers. Expect the mutant mRNA to increase in steady-state abundance and exhibit a longer half-life relative to control siRNA, with minimal change in the wild-type mRNA.**\n- This option correctly predicts that NMD will be engaged based on the $80$ nt distance. It proposes the correct experimental strategy (UPF1 siRNA knockdown) and the correct analytical method (qRT-PCR with junction-spanning primers). Crucially, it predicts the correct outcome: an increase in the abundance and half-life of the mutant transcript upon NMD inhibition, with no significant direct effect on the wild-type transcript.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. NMD will not be engaged because the premature termination codon is close to the last exon–exon junction. UPF1 knockdown is expected to decrease the mutant mRNA due to indirect destabilization; quantify by qRT-PCR.**\n- The premise that $80$ nt is \"close\" is incorrect; it is well beyond the threshold for NMD activation. The prediction that NMD will not be engaged is therefore false. The claim that UPF1 knockdown would decrease the mRNA is the opposite of the known function of NMD and lacks a valid mechanistic basis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. NMD will be engaged. UPF1 knockdown will specifically reduce accumulation of the truncated protein without changing mutant mRNA levels; validation should be by Western blot only.**\n- While the prediction of NMD engagement is correct, the description of the effect of UPF1 knockdown is fundamentally flawed. NMD degrades mRNA. Therefore, its inhibition must primarily affect mRNA levels. Stating that mRNA levels will not change is a direct contradiction of the pathway's mechanism. While Western blotting can be a secondary validation, qRT-PCR is the primary and most direct test.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. NMD will not be engaged because the stop codon is in the penultimate exon. To validate, overexpress UPF1 and quantify by qRT-PCR; expect higher mutant mRNA if NMD were involved.**\n- The reason given for NMD escape (\"because the stop codon is in the penultimate exon\") is incorrect. PTCs in penultimate exons are common triggers for NMD. The proposed validation by overexpression of UPF1 is less standard than knockdown, and the expected result is inverted; overexpression of a degradation factor should *decrease*, not increase, the target substrate.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. NMD will be engaged only if the $3^{\\prime}$ untranslated region exceeds $200$ nt; because the distance is $80$ nt, NMD will not occur, and UPF1 knockdown should have no effect on mRNA abundance by qRT-PCR.**\n- This option incorrectly applies a rule related to an alternative, EJC-independent NMD trigger (the \"faux $3'$ UTR\" model, which depends on the distance between the termination codon and the poly(A) tail) to an EJC-dependent scenario. The relevant parameter here is the distance to the last exon-exon junction ($80$ nt), not the length of the $3'$ UTR. The conclusion that NMD will not occur is based on this flawed reasoning.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
