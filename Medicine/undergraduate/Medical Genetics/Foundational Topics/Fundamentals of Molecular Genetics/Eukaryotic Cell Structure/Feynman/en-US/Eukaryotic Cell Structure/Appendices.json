This exercise explores the logic behind differential centrifugation, a cornerstone technique in cell biology that separates cellular components based on their physical properties like size and density. By working through this classic protocol, you will gain insight into the practical methods that underpin our molecular understanding of the cell.",

            "problem": "A researcher is developing a protocol to isolate two specific organelles, nuclei and mitochondria, from a fresh sample of homogenized mammalian liver cells. The process relies on differential centrifugation, a technique that separates components of a mixture by spinning them in a centrifuge at various speeds. The sedimentation of a particle depends on its size and density; larger and denser particles form a solid pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube at lower centrifugal forces than smaller, less dense particles. For a typical mammalian liver cell, nuclei are significantly larger and denser than mitochondria. The initial sample is the total cell homogenate.\n\nThe goal is to obtain two separate fractions: one enriched with nuclei and another enriched with mitochondria. Which of the following procedures correctly describes the sequence of steps to achieve this separation?\n\nA. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the supernatant and discard the pellet. Then, centrifuge this supernatant at a low speed (e.g., 600 x g) and collect the resulting pellet as the mitochondrial fraction and the final supernatant as the nuclear fraction.\n\nB. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction.\n\nC. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains a mix of both organelles. Resuspend this pellet and centrifuge again at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the resulting supernatant as the mitochondrial fraction and the pellet as the nuclear fraction.\n\nD. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction.",
            "solution": "Differential centrifugation separates cellular components by their sedimentation velocities under a centrifugal field. In the Stokes regime, the terminal sedimentation velocity of a roughly spherical particle of radius $a$ and density $\\rho_{p}$ in a medium of density $\\rho_{m}$ and viscosity $\\eta$, at angular speed $\\omega$ and radial position $r$, scales as\n$$\nv=\\frac{2 a^{2}(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m}) \\omega^{2} r}{9 \\eta}.\n$$\nThus, larger and denser particles have greater $v$ at a given $\\omega$, so they pellet at lower centrifugal forces and/or shorter times than smaller, less dense particles. For mammalian cell homogenates, nuclei are larger and denser than mitochondria, so at a low centrifugal force, nuclei pellet while mitochondria remain in the supernatant; at a higher centrifugal force applied to that supernatant, mitochondria pellet.\n\nApplying this principle to the options:\n- Option A starts with a high-speed spin, which would pellet both nuclei and many mitochondria together; discarding this pellet would lose the desired organelles, and a subsequent low-speed spin cannot pellet mitochondria. Therefore A is incorrect.\n- Option B performs a low-speed spin first to pellet nuclei (nuclear fraction), then applies a higher-speed spin to the supernatant to pellet mitochondria (mitochondrial fraction). This matches the expected sequence from the dependence of $v$ on $a$ and $(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m})$. Therefore B is correct.\n- Option C uses a high-speed spin first to pellet both organelles together, then a low-speed spin on the resuspended pellet to pellet nuclei and leave mitochondria in the supernatant. However, mitochondria would not be pelleted in that step and would remain in the supernatant mixed with smaller components; calling that supernatant the mitochondrial fraction without a subsequent higher-speed pelleting step is incorrect. Therefore C is incorrect.\n- Option D asserts that low speed pellets mitochondria and that high speed then pellets nuclei from the supernatant; this inverts the known order and contradicts the velocity scaling, so D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is to pellet nuclei at low speed, then pellet mitochondria from the supernatant at higher speed, as described in option B.",

            "problem": "In a typical eukaryotic cell, two different proteins, designated Protein A and Protein B, are being synthesized. The messenger RNA (mRNA) for Protein A encodes a polypeptide that lacks any specific N-terminal targeting signal. The mRNA for Protein B encodes a polypeptide that includes a specific N-terminal signal peptide that targets it to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Both proteins are ultimately folded into their stable, functional conformations, and neither possesses any other targeting signals (such as those for the nucleus, mitochondria, or peroxisomes) beyond what is described.\n\nAssuming all cellular protein-sorting machinery is functioning correctly, which of the following statements most accurately describes the final destinations of functional Protein A and Protein B?\n\nA. Protein A will be located in the cytoplasm; Protein B will be located in the extracellular space after secretion.\n\nB. Both Protein A and Protein B will be located in the cytoplasm.\n\nC.

Protein A will be located in the extracellular space after secretion; Protein B will be located in the cytoplasm.",
            "solution": "The governing principles of eukaryotic protein targeting are as follows: translation initiates on free cytosolic ribosomes; an N-terminal ER signal peptide on a nascent chain is recognized by the signal recognition particle, which targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the ER membrane for cotranslational translocation. In the absence of any N-terminal ER signal peptide, translation completes on free ribosomes and the default localization is the cytosol unless additional specific targeting signals (for organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, or peroxisomes) are present. For soluble proteins that enter the ER lumen and lack ER retention/retrieval signals (such as the KDEL sequence) and lack other targeting information, the default pathway is through the ER and Golgi apparatus to secretion to the extracellular space.\n\nApplying these principles:\n1. Protein A lacks any specific N-terminal targeting signal and is specified to have no other targeting signals. Therefore, it is synthesized on free ribosomes and remains in the cytoplasm as its final destination.\n2. Protein B contains a specific N-terminal ER signal peptide and no other targeting signals. It will be cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen; in the absence of retention signals, the default trafficking is ER to Golgi to secretory vesicles, culminating in secretion to the extracellular space. Thus, its final destination is the extracellular space after secretion.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states Protein A in the cytoplasm and Protein B in the extracellular space after secretion.\n- B is incorrect because Protein B does not remain in the cytoplasm.\n- C is incorrect because Protein A lacks an ER signal and is not secreted.\n- D and E both invert the expected destinations and are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is A.",

            "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying protein trafficking in a specially engineered human cell line. These cells have a conditional loss-of-function mutation in a gene encoding a crucial subunit of the Coat Protein Complex II (COPII). When a specific inducing agent is added to the culture medium, the synthesis of this subunit ceases, leading to the rapid depletion of functional COPII complexes throughout the cell.\n\nTo investigate the consequences, the researchers add the inducing agent and simultaneously pulse-label newly synthesized proteins. They then track the subcellular localization of three specific proteins over time:\n1.  **Catalase:** An enzyme whose primary function is within peroxisomes.\n2.  **Albumin:** A protein synthesized for secretion into the extracellular medium.\n3.  **Glucagon Receptor:** A transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor destined for the plasma membrane.\n\nAssuming the mutation is 100% effective and that all other cellular machinery is functioning normally, which of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of these three newly synthesized proteins in the presence of the inducing agent?\n\nA. All three proteins will accumulate in the cis-Golgi network.\n\nB. Albumin and the Glucagon Receptor will accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, while Catalase will correctly localize to peroxisomes.\n\nC. All three proteins will be mislocalized and accumulate in the cytosol.\n\nD. All three proteins will accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nE. Catalase and Albumin will accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, while the Glucagon Receptor will be degraded in the cytosol.",
            "solution": "1) Principle: COPII mediates anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cis-Golgi by forming vesicles at ER exit sites. A complete loss of a COPII subunit abolishes ER export, causing newly synthesized secretory pathway cargo to accumulate in the rough ER.\n\n2) Albumin: As a secreted protein, albumin is synthesized with an N-terminal signal sequence, engages the signal recognition particle, and is co-translationally translocated into the rough ER lumen. Its onward movement to the Golgi requires COPII-mediated ER export. With COPII function lost, albumin accumulates in the rough ER.\n\n3) Glucagon receptor: As a multi-pass transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor destined for the plasma membrane, it is co-translationally inserted into the rough ER membrane. Forward trafficking to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane requires COPII vesicles for the ER-to-Golgi step. With COPII function lost, the glucagon receptor accumulates in the rough ER membrane.\n\n4) Catalase: Catalase is a peroxisomal matrix enzyme synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and contains a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1 or PTS2) recognized by peroxins (e.g., Pex5/Pex7), enabling post-translational import directly into peroxisomes. This peroxisomal import pathway is independent of COPII and the Golgi. With peroxin machinery intact, catalase correctly localizes to peroxisomes despite COPII loss.\n\n5) Option check:\n- A is incorrect: no COPII means cargo cannot reach the cis-Golgi.\n- B is correct: albumin and glucagon receptor accumulate in the rough ER; catalase localizes to peroxisomes.\n- C is incorrect: secretory and membrane proteins do not accumulate in cytosol; they are co-translationally targeted to ER.\n- D is incorrect: catalase does not localize to the ER; it targets peroxisomes.\n- E is incorrect: catalase is not ER-localized, and the glucagon receptor is inserted into ER membrane rather than degraded in the cytosol.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is B.",
