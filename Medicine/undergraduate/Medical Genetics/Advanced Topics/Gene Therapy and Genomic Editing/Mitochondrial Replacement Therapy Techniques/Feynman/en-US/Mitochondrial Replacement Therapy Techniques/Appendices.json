The fundamental goal is to transfer the nuclear genetic material while leaving behind as many of the mother's mitochondria as possible. This first exercise allows you to build a simple but powerful model to quantify this unavoidable \"carryover\" of maternal mitochondria, helping you translate the qualitative goal of \"minimizing carryover\" into a concrete, predictable number.

            "problem": "Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) is a mitochondrial replacement therapy technique in which the maternal metaphase II spindle–chromosome complex is isolated as a karyoplast and transferred into an enucleated donor oocyte. A key concern is the carryover of mutant mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) that co-localizes with the spindle-associated mitochondria. Use the standard definition of concentration as number per unit volume and the fact that expected counts equal concentration times volume to model the expected mutant mtDNA carryover.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded scenario. The local concentration of mitochondria in the spindle-associated microenvironment is $\\rho$ (mitochondria per picoliter), each mitochondrion contains on average $m$ mtDNA copies, and the fraction of mutant mtDNA among those copies is $\\varphi$. The spindle karyoplast transferred volume is $v$ picoliters. Under the approximation that the microenvironment is well-mixed at the scale of $v$ and that the mutant fraction is uniform within the associated mitochondria, derive the effective mutant mtDNA concentration $\\alpha$ and then the expected number $c$ of mutant mtDNA copies carried over.

It is based on established principles of cell biology and medical genetics, specifically concerning mitochondrial replacement therapy. The definitions and parameters provided are clear and sufficient to derive a unique, meaningful solution. All validation criteria are met.\n\nThe objective is to determine the expected number of mutant mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) copies, denoted by $c$, that are carried over during a Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) procedure. The derivation will be based on the fundamental definition of concentration.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given parameters:\n- $\\rho$: The local concentration of mitochondria in the spindle-associated microenvironment, in units of mitochondria per picoliter.\n- $m$: The average number of mtDNA copies per mitochondrion.\n- $\\varphi$: The dimensionless fraction of mtDNA copies that are mutant.\n- $v$: The volume of the transferred spindle karyoplast, in units of picoliters.\n\nThe problem requires us to first derive the effective concentration of mutant mtDNA, which we will denote as $\\alpha$. Concentration is defined as number per unit volume.\n\n1.  The concentration of mitochondria is given as $\\rho$.\n2.  Each mitochondrion contains, on average, $m$ mtDNA copies. Therefore, the concentration of total mtDNA copies (both wild-type and mutant) is the product of the mitochondrial concentration and the number of copies per mitochondrion.\n    $$\n    \\text{Concentration of total mtDNA copies} = \\rho \\cdot m\n    $$\n    The units for this quantity are $(\\text{mitochondria}/\\text{pL}) \\times (\\text{mtDNA copies}/\\text{mitochondrion}) = \\text{mtDNA copies}/\\text{pL}$.\n\n3.  The fraction of these mtDNA copies that are mutant is given by $\\varphi$. To find the concentration of only the mutant mtDNA copies, $\\alpha$, we multiply the total mtDNA concentration by this fraction.\n    $$\n    \\alpha = (\\rho \\cdot m) \\cdot \\varphi = \\rho m \\varphi\n    $$\n    The units for $\\alpha$ are also mtDNA copies/pL, which is consistent with its definition as a concentration.\n\nNext, we derive the expected number of mutant mtDNA copies, $c$, carried over in the transfer. The problem explicitly states that the expected count is the product of concentration and volume. The volume of the transferred karyoplast is $v$.\n\n1.  Using the derived concentration of mutant mtDNA, $\\alpha$, and the given transferred volume, $v$, the expected number of mutant mtDNA copies is:\n    $$\n    c = \\alpha \\cdot v\n    $$\n\n2.  Substituting the expression for $\\alpha$, we obtain the final symbolic expression for $c$:\n    $$\n    c = (\\rho m \\varphi) v = \\rho m \\varphi v\n    $$\n    The units for $c$ are $(\\text{mutant mtDNA copies}/\\text{pL}) \\times \\text{pL} = \\text{mutant mtDNA copies}$, which is a dimensionless count, as expected.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the numerical value of $c$ using the provided parameters:\n- $\\rho = 300 \\, \\text{pL}^{-1}$\n- $m = 5$\n- $\\varphi = 0.03$\n- $v = 3.5 \\, \\text{pL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $c$:\n$$\nc = (300) \\cdot (5) \\cdot (0.03) \\cdot (3.5)\n$$\nWe perform the calculation step-by-step:\n$$\nc = (1500) \\cdot (0.03) \\cdot (3.5)\n$$\n$$\nc = 45 \\cdot (3.5)\n$$\n$$\nc = 157.5\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

            "problem": "A woman carries a pathogenic mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) variant with maternal heteroplasmy $h_m = 0.80$. Two assisted reproduction strategies are considered to reduce the mutant mtDNA burden in the offspring:\n\n- Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT): A fraction $f = 0.10$ of donor cytoplasm containing healthy mitochondria is injected into the woman's oocyte before fertilization. Assume donor mtDNA is wild-type and the woman's oocyte retains the remainder of its original mitochondria. No nuclear material is exchanged.\n- Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) by nuclear transfer: The woman’s nuclear genetic material is moved into an enucleated donor oocyte with healthy mtDNA. Assume a maternal mtDNA carryover fraction $c = 0.01$ into the donor oocyte.

The concepts of mtDNA carryover and replicative advantage are scientifically valid and studied phenomena.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary quantitative parameters to model the expected heteroplasmy for each technique.

It is deemed **valid**. We may now proceed with the quantitative analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the expected final heteroplasmy for each of the two techniques, denoted $H_{CT}$ and $H_{MRT}$, and compare them to the disease threshold $T$ and to each other.\n\n**1. Analysis of Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT)**\n\nIn CT, a volume of donor cytoplasm, assumed to be a fraction $f$ of the recipient oocyte's volume and containing a proportional number of wild-type mitochondria, is injected into the maternal oocyte. Let $N_m$ be the initial number of mtDNA molecules in the maternal oocyte. The number of mutant molecules is $h_m N_m$. The number of added donor mitochondria is $f N_m$, all of which are wild-type.\n\nThe total number of mtDNA molecules in the resulting oocyte is $N_{total, CT} = N_m + f N_m = N_m (1+f)$.\nThe total number of mutant mtDNA molecules remains unchanged at $N_{mutant, CT} = h_m N_m$.\n\nThe expected heteroplasmy after CT, $H_{CT}$, is the ratio of mutant mtDNA to total mtDNA:\n$$H_{CT} = \\frac{N_{mutant, CT}}{N_{total, CT}} = \\frac{h_m N_m}{N_m (1+f)} = \\frac{h_m}{1+f}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $h_m = 0.80$ and $f = 0.10$:\n$$H_{CT} = \\frac{0.80}{1 + 0.10} = \\frac{0.80}{1.10} \\approx 0.727$$\nThis resulting heteroplasmy, $H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$, is greater than the clinical threshold for disease, $T = 0.60$. Therefore, CT is predicted to be insufficient to prevent the disease in the offspring.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT)**\n\nIn MRT, the maternal nucleus is transferred to an enucleated donor oocyte. A small fraction, $c$, of the total mitochondria are carried over from the maternal oocyte, while the fraction $(1-c)$ are from the healthy donor.\n\nThe initial heteroplasmy in the reconstructed oocyte, $H_{MRT,0}$, is the fraction of carried-over mtDNA, $c$, multiplied by the maternal heteroplasmy, $h_m$. The donor mitochondria are wild-type.\n$$H_{MRT,0} = c \\times h_m = 0.01 \\times 0.80 = 0.008$$\nThis is the heteroplasmy level at time $t=0$. However, the problem states that the maternal mtDNA has a replicative advantage, $r = 1.10$, over the donor mtDNA for $t=10$ cell cycles. We must model the change in the proportion of maternal-derived mtDNA over this period.\n\nLet $M_t$ and $D_t$ be the populations of maternal and donor mtDNA at cycle $t$, respectively. The ratio of these populations evolves as:\n$$\\frac{M_t}{D_t} = \\left(\\frac{M_0}{D_0}\\right) r^t$$\nThe initial ratio of maternal to donor mtDNA molecules is $\\frac{M_0}{D_0} = \\frac{c}{1-c}$.\nAfter $t=10$ cycles, the ratio becomes:\n$$\\frac{M_{10}}{D_{10}} = \\left(\\frac{c}{1-c}\\right) r^{10} = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{1-0.01}\\right) (1.10)^{10} = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{0.99}\\right) (1.10)^{10}$$\nUsing a calculator, $(1.10)^{10} \\approx 2.59374$.\n$$\\frac{M_{10}}{D_{10}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{0.01}{0.99}\\right) \\times 2.59374 \\approx 0.010101 \\times 2.59374 \\approx 0.02620$$\nThe final heteroplasmy, $H_{MRT}$, is the fraction of mtDNA that are mutant. The mutants are a fraction $h_m$ of the final maternal mtDNA population, $M_{10}$.\n$$H_{MRT} = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant mtDNA}}{\\text{Total mtDNA}} = \\frac{h_m M_{10}}{M_{10} + D_{10}}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the ratio $\\frac{M_{10}}{D_{10}}$:\n$$H_{MRT} = h_m \\left( \\frac{M_{10}/D_{10}}{M_{10}/D_{10} + 1} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$H_{MRT} \\approx 0.80 \\left( \\frac{0.02620}{0.02620 + 1} \\right) = 0.80 \\left( \\frac{0.02620}{1.02620} \\right) \\approx 0.80 \\times 0.02553 \\approx 0.0204$$\nThis resulting heteroplasmy, $H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$, is very far below the clinical threshold $T = 0.60$.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\n-   CT results in a heteroplasmy of $H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$, which is above the disease threshold $T=0.60$. The predicted clinical risk is high.\n-   MRT results in a heteroplasmy of $H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$, which is far below the disease threshold $T=0.60$. The predicted clinical risk is low.\n-   Therefore, MRT is a significantly more effective strategy for reducing disease risk than CT under the specified parameters.\n\n### Option-by-Option Evaluation\n\n**A. Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT) dilutes mutant heteroplasmy sufficiently that the offspring’s mutant fraction falls below $T$, yielding lower disease risk than Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT).**\nOur calculation shows $H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$, which is *above* the threshold $T = 0.60$. Furthermore, $H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$ is much greater than $H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$, so CT yields a *higher*, not lower, disease risk than MRT. The statement is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) with low carryover $c$ and moderate maternal mtDNA replicative advantage $r$ keeps mutant heteroplasmy far below $T$, producing lower predicted disease risk than Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT) under the given parameters.**\nOur calculation shows $H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$, which is indeed \"far below\" the threshold $T = 0.60$. Our analysis also shows that the risk from MRT ($H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$) is substantially lower than the risk from CT ($H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$). This statement accurately summarizes the results of our quantitative analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT) achieves nuclear replacement and thus eliminates maternal mtDNA effects; disease risk then depends only on donor haplotype matching, making CT superior to MRT.**\nThis statement mischaracterizes the techniques. CT involves the transfer of cytoplasm, not the nucleus. MRT is the technique that involves nuclear replacement. Consequently, CT does not eliminate maternal mtDNA; in fact, the vast majority of mtDNA in the resulting oocyte is maternal. The statement is fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) invariably creates nuclear–mitochondrial mismatch that increases disease risk relative to Cytoplasmic Transfer (CT), regardless of carryover level or donor mtDNA health.**\nWhile nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch is a valid biological concern in MRT, this statement makes an unsupportable claim. It asserts that this potential risk *invariably* outweighs the benefit of reducing a known pathogenic variant's heteroplasmy, \"regardless of carryover level\". In this case, MRT reduces the heteroplasmy of a pathogenic variant from an extremely high-risk level of $h_m=0.80$ to a very low-risk level of $H_{MRT} \\approx 0.0204$. CT, by contrast, leaves the heteroplasmy at a high-risk level of $H_{CT} \\approx 0.727$. Based on the provided quantitative data, the risk from the known pathogenic variant is overwhelmingly greater in the CT case. The statement's generalization is too strong and contradicts the quantitative analysis mandated by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The standard rule of thumb is that $n\\hat{p}$ and $n(1-\\hat{p})$ must be sufficiently large for both samples (typically $\\geq 10$).\nFor PNT:\n- Number of successes: $x_{\\mathrm{PNT}} = n_{\\mathrm{PNT}}\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{PNT}} = 62$\n- Number of failures: $n_{\\mathrm{PNT}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{PNT}}) = 120 - 62 = 58$\nFor MST:\n- Number of successes: $x_{\\mathrm{MST}} = n_{\\mathrm{MST}}\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{MST}} = 48$\n- Number of failures: $n_{\\mathrm{MST}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{MST}}) = 130 - 48 = 82$\nAll four of these values ($62$, $58$, $48$, $82$) are greater than $10$, so the large-sample approximation is appropriate.\n\nNext, we determine the critical value $z_{\\alpha/2}$ for a $95\\%$ confidence interval.\n- Confidence level $1 - \\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- For a two-sided interval, we use $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\n- The critical value $z_{0.025}$ is the value from the standard normal distribution that has an upper tail probability of $0.025$.
