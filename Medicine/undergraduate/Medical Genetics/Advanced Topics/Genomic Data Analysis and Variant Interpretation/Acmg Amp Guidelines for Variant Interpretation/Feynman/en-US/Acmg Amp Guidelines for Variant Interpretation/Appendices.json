We will walk through the fundamental process of using Bayes' theorem to combine multiple lines of pathogenic evidence—whose strengths are represented by likelihood ratios—to update our belief about a variant's clinical significance.

            "problem": "Consider a single-nucleotide variant under evaluation using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines for variant interpretation. Assume a Bayesian framework in which the variant has a prior probability of pathogenicity $P_{0} = 0.10$ based on gene-level knowledge and disease prevalence. The variant meets one Strong and two Moderate pathogenic criteria, and you are provided the following evidence likelihood ratios (LRs) for pathogenicity: Very Strong $= 350$, Strong $= 18.7$, Moderate $= 4.3$, Supporting $= 2.08$. \n\nStarting from Bayes’ theorem and the definition of odds, and assuming the criteria are conditionally independent given pathogenic or benign status, derive the posterior probability of pathogenicity after integrating the one Strong and two Moderate criteria. Then, decide the ACMG/AMP classification category using the following widely cited Bayesian thresholds: Pathogenic if posterior probability $\\geq 0.99$, Likely pathogenic if $0.90 \\leq$ posterior probability $ 0.99$, Variant of Uncertain Significance if $0.10 \\leq$ posterior probability $ 0.90$, Likely benign if $0.001 $ posterior probability $ 0.10$, and Benign if posterior probability $\\leq 0.001$.\n\nExpress the final posterior probability as a single simplified exact fraction. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The solution is derived using Bayes' theorem, which relates prior probability and posterior probability through a likelihood ratio. It is most convenient to work with odds, where odds are defined as $O = \\frac{P}{1-P}$, with $P$ being the probability of an event.\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form is:\n$$ O_{posterior} = O_{prior} \\times LR_{total} $$\nwhere $O_{prior}$ are the prior odds of pathogenicity, $O_{posterior}$ are the posterior odds, and $LR_{total}$ is the combined likelihood ratio of the observed evidence.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds of pathogenicity, $O_{prior}$, from the given prior probability $P_{0} = 0.10$. Let $Path$ denote the event that the variant is pathogenic.\n$$ P(Path) = P_{0} = 0.10 $$\nThe prior probability of the variant being benign, $P(\\neg Path)$, is:\n$$ P(\\neg Path) = 1 - P(Path) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\nThe prior odds are then:\n$$ O_{prior} = \\frac{P(Path)}{P(\\neg Path)} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{total}$, for the observed evidence. The evidence consists of one Strong criterion ($E_S$) and two Moderate criteria ($E_{M1}$, $E_{M2}$). The problem states that these criteria are conditionally independent. Therefore, the total likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios.\nThe given LR values are $LR_{Strong} = 18.7$ and $LR_{Moderate} = 4.3$.\n$$ LR_{total} = LR_{Strong} \\times LR_{Moderate} \\times LR_{Moderate} $$\nTo maintain precision for an exact fractional answer, we convert the decimal values to fractions:\n$$ LR_{Strong} = 18.7 = \\frac{187}{10} $$\n$$ LR_{Moderate} = 4.3 = \\frac{43}{10} $$\nNow, we calculate $LR_{total}$:\n$$ LR_{total} = \\frac{187}{10} \\times \\frac{43}{10} \\times \\frac{43}{10} = \\frac{187 \\times 43^2}{1000} $$\nWe compute $43^2 = 1849$.\n$$ LR_{total} = \\frac{187 \\times 1849}{1000} = \\frac{345763}{1000} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds, $O_{posterior}$, using the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ O_{posterior} = O_{prior} \\times LR_{total} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{345763}{1000} = \\frac{345763}{9000} $$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a posterior probability, $P_{posterior}$. The relationship is $P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\n$$ P_{posterior} = \\frac{O_{posterior}}{1 + O_{posterior}} = \\frac{\\frac{345763}{9000}}{1 + \\frac{345763}{9000}} = \\frac{\\frac{345763}{9000}}{\\frac{9000 + 345763}{9000}} = \\frac{345763}{354763} $$\n\nTo ensure this fraction is simplified, we must check for common factors between the numerator ($345763$) and the denominator ($354763$). Any common factor must also divide their difference, which is $354763 - 345763 = 9000$. The prime factorization of $9000$ is $2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^3$.\n- The numerator $345763$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd).\n- The sum of the digits of the numerator is $3+4+5+7+6+3 = 28$, which is not divisible by $3$. So, the numerator is not divisible by $3$.\n- The numerator does not end in $0$ or $5$, so it is not divisible by $5$.\nSince the numerator has no prime factors in common with $9000$, it shares no common factors with the denominator other than $1$. Thus, the fraction $\\frac{345763}{354763}$ is in its simplest form.\n\nThe first part of the answer is the posterior probability: $\\frac{345763}{354763}$.\n\nFor the second part, we determine the ACMG/AMP classification. We evaluate the numerical value of the posterior probability:\n$$ P_{posterior} = \\frac{345763}{354763} \\approx 0.97463 $$\nWe compare this value to the given thresholds:\n- Pathogenic: $\\geq 0.99$\n- Likely pathogenic: $0.90 \\leq P  0.99$\n- VUS: $0.10 \\leq P  0.90$\n- Likely benign: $0.001  P  0.10$\n- Benign: $\\leq 0.001$\n\nSince $0.90 \\leq 0.97463  0.99$, the variant is classified as **Likely pathogenic**.",
