The premises—first-order clearance, a source term reduced by surgical intervention, and a system at steady-state pre-intervention—are realistic and consistent with the biological context of ctDNA dynamics. The problem is well-posed; it describes a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with a well-defined initial condition derived from the steady-state assumption, which guarantees a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any physical or mathematical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe temporal evolution of the ctDNA concentration, $C(t)$, in a single, well-mixed compartment is described by a mass balance equation. The rate of change of concentration is the difference between the rate of input and the rate of clearance.\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of input}) - (\\text{Rate of clearance})\n$$\nThe problem defines the input rate as a piecewise constant term, $S(t)$. For the purpose of this model, $S(t)$ represents the rate of change of concentration due to the influx of ctDNA, with units of concentration per time. The clearance is a first-order process, meaning the rate of removal is proportional to the current concentration, given by $kC(t)$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = S(t) - kC(t)\n$$\n\nFirst, we must relate the rate constant $k$ to the given half-life, $t_{1/2}$. For a pure first-order decay process ($\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$), the solution is $C(t) = C(0)\\exp(-kt)$. The half-life is the time at which $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C(0)$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}C(0) = C(0)\\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}\n$$\nThus, the rate constant $k$ is:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the initial condition for the period $t \\geq 0$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system was at steady state. At steady state, the concentration does not change, so $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. For $t < 0$, the input rate is $S(t) = S_{0}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n0 = S_{0} - kC_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state concentration. Solving for $C_{\\text{ss}}$ gives:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{S_{0}}{k}\n$$\nSince the concentration is continuous at the moment of intervention, the concentration at $t=0$ is equal to this pre-surgical steady-state value.\n$$\nC(0) = C_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{S_{0}}{k}\n$$\n\nNow, we solve the ODE for $t \\geq 0$. For this period, the input rate is $S(t) = S_{1}$. The ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = S_{1} - kC(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. It can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + kC(t) = S_{1}\n$$\nThis ODE can be solved using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(kt)$. Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(kt)\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + k\\exp(kt)C(t) = S_{1}\\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $C(t)\\exp(kt)$ by the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t)\\exp(kt)\\right) = S_{1}\\exp(kt)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t)\\exp(kt)\\right) dt = \\int S_{1}\\exp(kt) dt\n$$\n$$\nC(t)\\exp(kt) = \\frac{S_{1}}{k}\\exp(kt) + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $C(t)$ by dividing by $\\exp(kt)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{S_{1}}{k} + A\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nTo find the constant $A$, we apply the initial condition $C(0) = S_{0}/k$:\n$$\nC(0) = \\frac{S_{1}}{k} + A\\exp(-k \\cdot 0) = \\frac{S_{1}}{k} + A\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{S_{0}}{k} = \\frac{S_{1}}{k} + A \\implies A = \\frac{S_{0}}{k} - \\frac{S_{1}}{k} = \\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the expression for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{S_{1}}{k} + \\left(\\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{k}\\right) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis solution represents the new steady state, $S_1/k$, plus a transient term that decays from the initial condition.\n\nFinally, we express the solution in terms of the given variables $S_{0}$, $S_{1}$, $t_{1/2}$, and $t$. We substitute $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$ into the expression for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{S_{1}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} + \\left(\\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}t\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{S_{1} t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} + \\frac{(S_{0} - S_{1})t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t \\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}$ gives the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\left[ S_{1} + (S_{0} - S_{1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t \\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression describes the ctDNA concentration for $t \\geq 0$, starting from the pre-surgical steady-state level and exponentially approaching a new, lower steady-state level consistent with the reduced input rate $S_1$.",

The statistical approach, including the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution for rare events (small $p$, large $N$), is canonical. All terms are well-defined, and the parameters ($m, N, p, t$) are provided with realistic values for a contemporary liquid biopsy assay. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed, asking for a specific derivation and calculation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem asks for a step-by-step derivation. First, we derive the expression for the per-locus detection probability, $q$.\n\nA single locus is considered positive if the number of observed mutant molecules, $X$, is greater than or equal to the threshold $t$. The probability of this event is $q$.\n$$q = P(X \\geq t)$$\nThe problem specifies using the Poisson approximation for the distribution of $X$, where $X \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ and $\\lambda = Np$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nTo calculate $P(X \\geq t)$, it is more convenient to calculate the probability of the complement event, $P(X < t)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$q = 1 - P(X < t)$$\nThe event $X < t$ corresponds to $X$ taking on integer values from $0$ to $t-1$.\n$$P(X < t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} P(X=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nFactoring out the constant term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$, we get:\n$$P(X < t) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $q$, we obtain the per-locus detection probability in terms of $\\lambda$ and $t$:\n$$q = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the overall probability that the panel detects MRD. Let this probability be $P_{\\text{overall}}$. Detection occurs if at least one of the $m$ loci is positive. Let $D_i$ be the event that the $i$-th locus is positive. The probability of this is $P(D_i) = q$. We are looking for the probability of the union of these events:\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} = P(D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup D_m)$$\nSince the loci are independent, it is easier to calculate the probability of the complement event: that no locus is positive. Let $D_i^c$ be the event that the $i$-th locus is negative. The probability is $P(D_i^c) = 1 - P(D_i) = 1 - q$.\nThe probability that all $m$ loci are negative is the product of their individual probabilities, due to their independence:\n$$P(\\text{no detection}) = P(D_1^c \\cap D_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap D_m^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} P(D_i^c) = (1-q)^m$$\nThe overall detection probability is $1$ minus the probability of no detection:\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} = 1 - (1-q)^m$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this overall probability numerically using the given parameters: $m=8$, $N=10,000$, $p=2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, and $t=3$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = Np = 10,000 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 10^4 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 2.0$$\nNext, we calculate the per-locus detection probability $q$ with $\\lambda=2$ and $t=3$. The sum runs from $k=0$ to $t-1=2$.\n$$q = 1 - \\exp(-2) \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\frac{2^k}{k!} = 1 - \\exp(-2) \\left( \\frac{2^0}{0!} + \\frac{2^1}{1!} + \\frac{2^2}{2!} \\right)$$\nRecalling that $0! = 1$:\n$$q = 1 - \\exp(-2) \\left( \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{2}{1} + \\frac{4}{2} \\right) = 1 - \\exp(-2) (1 + 2 + 2) = 1 - 5\\exp(-2)$$\nNow we can compute the overall detection probability, $P_{\\text{overall}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} = 1 - (1-q)^m = 1 - (1 - (1 - 5\\exp(-2)))^8$$\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} = 1 - (5\\exp(-2))^8 = 1 - 5^8 \\exp(-16)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} = 1 - 390625 \\times \\exp(-16)$$\nUsing the value $e \\approx 2.71828$, we have $\\exp(-16) \\approx 1.12535 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} \\approx 1 - 390625 \\times (1.12535 \\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} \\approx 1 - 0.04403664...$$\n$$P_{\\text{overall}} \\approx 0.95596335...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.9560$.",
