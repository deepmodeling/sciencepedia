This relationship can often be described with a mathematical model. This exercise challenges you to fit a proposed model to clinical data, allowing you to quantify the inverse correlation between repeat length and age of onset and to determine a critical repeat threshold for pathogenicity.

            "problem": "In repeat expansion disorders such as Huntington disease, cytosine-adenine-guanine ($\\text{CAG}$) triplet repeat counts in the affected gene correlate inversely with the expected age of onset due to genetic anticipation. Genetic anticipation refers to the observation that expansions of unstable repeats tend to increase across generations, leading to earlier and often more severe disease onset. Empirically, above a critical repeat length, the disease manifests and the expected age of onset declines with further expansion. A cohort study used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping to measure repeat counts and clinical records to estimate group mean ages of onset. Assume the expected age of onset, denoted by $E[\\text{onset}]$, is modeled as a reciprocal shift:\n$$E[\\text{onset}]=a+\\frac{b}{r-c},$$\nwhere $r$ is the repeat count, $a$ is a baseline minimum expected onset age (years), $b$ is a positive scaling constant (years), and $c$ is an unknown effective threshold repeat count (dimensionless) indicating the location of the vertical asymptote of the model.\n\nThree non-overlapping genotype groups yielded the following mean values (reporting ages in years):\n- Group $1$: repeat count $r_1=35$, mean onset $t_1=58$.\n- Group $2$: repeat count $r_2=50$, mean onset $t_2=22$.\n- Group $3$: repeat count $r_3=70$, mean onset $t_3=16$.\n\nAssuming the model holds exactly for these group means (negligible measurement noise at this scale), fit the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ analytically from first principles by solving the system implied by the three data points. Then, interpret $c$ in biological terms as an effective threshold for pathological repeat length within this modeling framework.\n\nReport only the fitted value of the threshold parameter $c$. No rounding is required. Do not include units inside your final reported value; $c$ is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires fitting the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the model $E[\\text{onset}] = a + \\frac{b}{r-c}$ to three given data points and then reporting the value of the parameter $c$. The provided data points, which relate the mean repeat count $r$ to the mean age of onset $t$, are $(r_1, t_1) = (35, 58)$, $(r_2, t_2) = (50, 22)$, and $(r_3, t_3) = (70, 16)$. We assume the model holds exactly for these points.\n\nFirst, we establish the system of three equations by substituting the data into the model equation $t = a + \\frac{b}{r-c}$:\n$$58 = a + \\frac{b}{35-c} \\quad (1)$$\n$$22 = a + \\frac{b}{50-c} \\quad (2)$$\n$$16 = a + \\frac{b}{70-c} \\quad (3)$$\n\nTo solve this non-linear system, we can first eliminate the parameter $a$ by subtracting the equations from one another.\n\nSubtracting equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$58 - 22 = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{35-c}\\right) - \\left(a + \\frac{b}{50-c}\\right)$$\n$$36 = \\frac{b}{35-c} - \\frac{b}{50-c}$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{1}{35-c} - \\frac{1}{50-c} \\right)$$\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{(50-c) - (35-c)}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right)$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{50 - c - 35 + c}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right)$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{15}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right) \\quad (4)$$\n\nNext, we subtract equation $(3)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$22 - 16 = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{50-c}\\right) - \\left(a + \\frac{b}{70-c}\\right)$$\n$$6 = \\frac{b}{50-c} - \\frac{b}{70-c}$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{1}{50-c} - \\frac{1}{70-c} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{(70-c) - (50-c)}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{70 - c - 50 + c}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{20}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right) \\quad (5)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations, $(4)$ and $(5)$, with two unknowns, $b$ and $c$. We can eliminate $b$ to find $c$. We solve for $b$ in both equations, assuming $b \\neq 0$.\nFrom equation $(4)$:\n$$b = \\frac{36}{15} (35-c)(50-c) = \\frac{12}{5} (35-c)(50-c)$$\nFrom equation $(5)$:\n$$b = \\frac{6}{20} (50-c)(70-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (50-c)(70-c)$$\n\nSetting the two expressions for $b$ equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{12}{5} (35-c)(50-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (50-c)(70-c)$$\n\nThe repeat counts are distinct, so $c$ cannot be equal to $35$, $50$, or $70$, as this would lead to division by zero in the original equations. Therefore, $(50-c) \\neq 0$, and we can divide both sides by this term:\n$$\\frac{12}{5} (35-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (70-c)$$\n\nTo solve for $c$, we can first clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by $10$:\n$$10 \\cdot \\frac{12}{5} (35-c) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} (70-c)$$\n$$2 \\cdot 12 (35-c) = 3 (70-c)$$\n$$24 (35-c) = 3 (70-c)$$\n\nDivide both sides by $3$:\n$$8 (35-c) = 70-c$$\n\nNow, expand and solve for $c$:\n$$8 \\cdot 35 - 8c = 70 - c$$\n$$280 - 8c = 70 - c$$\n$$280 - 70 = 8c - c$$\n$$210 = 7c$$\n$$c = \\frac{210}{7}$$\n$$c = 30$$\n\nThe fitted value for the threshold parameter $c$ is $30$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of $c$. In the model $E[\\text{onset}] = a + \\frac{b}{r-c}$, the term $\\frac{b}{r-c}$ represents the deviation from the baseline minimum age of onset $a$. The parameter $c$ is the value of the repeat count $r$ at which the denominator $r-c$ becomes zero, causing a vertical asymptote. As $r$ approaches $c$ from above (i.e., for repeat counts just over the threshold), the expected age of onset approaches infinity. Biologically, this means that for repeat counts at or below the threshold $c$, the disease is not expected to manifest within a normal human lifespan. Thus, $c$ represents the effective threshold repeat count for pathogenicity in this model. Repeat counts greater than $c$ are associated with a finite age of onset that decreases as $r$ increases. The value $c=30$ is biologically plausible, as it falls within the range often considered for the boundary between normal and premutation alleles for Huntington disease.\n\nThe question asks only for the value of $c$.",

Using the law of total probability, we can expand this as:\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = P(A | C, T^{-}) P(C | T^{-}) + P(A | C^c, T^{-}) P(C^c | T^{-})$$\nAn affected child requires the mother to be a carrier. Therefore, if the mother is not a carrier ($C^c$), the child cannot be affected. This means $P(A | C^c, T^{-}) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = P(A | C, T^{-}) P(C | T^{-})$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds in two main steps:\n1.  Calculate the posterior probability that the individual is a carrier, given the negative test result, $P(C | T^{-})$.\n2.  Calculate the probability that the child is affected, given the mother is a carrier, $P(A | C, T^{-})$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $P(C | T^{-})$**\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | C) P(C)}{P(T^{-})}$$\nWe need to find the terms $P(T^{-} | C)$ and $P(T^{-})$.\n\nFirst, let's find $P(T^{-} | C)$, the probability of a negative test given the individual is a carrier. This depends on whether she is a mosaic or non-mosaic carrier.\nThe probability of a negative test for a mosaic carrier is $1 - s_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$.\nThe probability of a negative test for a non-mosaic carrier is $1 - s_{\\mathrm{n}} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\nUsing the law of total probability, conditioning on mosaicism status:\n$$P(T^{-} | C) = P(T^{-} | \\text{mosaic carrier})P(\\text{mosaic carrier} | C) + P(T^{-} | \\text{non-mosaic carrier})P(\\text{non-mosaic carrier} | C)$$\n$$P(T^{-} | C) = (1 - s_{\\mathrm{m}}) q + (1 - s_{\\mathrm{n}}) (1 - q)$$\n$$P(T^{-} | C) = (0.30)(0.10) + (0.02)(0.90) = 0.03 + 0.018 = 0.048$$\n\nNext, we find the overall probability of a negative test, $P(T^{-})$, by conditioning on carrier status:\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | C) P(C) + P(T^{-} | C^c) P(C^c)$$\n$$P(T^{-}) = (0.048)(0.25) + (1)(0.75) = 0.012 + 0.75 = 0.762$$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability $P(C | T^{-})$:\n$$P(C | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | C) P(C)}{P(T^{-})} = \\frac{(0.048)(0.25)}{0.762} = \\frac{0.012}{0.762}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $P(A | C, T^{-})$ and the final probability**\n\nThe event $A$ (child is affected) is determined by germline events (oogenesis and transmission), while the test result $T^{-}$ is determined by somatic cell DNA from a blood sample. These are biologically independent processes. Therefore, the test result provides no new information about transmission to the child once we already know the mother is a carrier. This means we can assume conditional independence:\n$$P(A | C, T^{-}) = P(A | C)$$\nThe probability $P(A | C)$ is the probability that a carrier mother has an affected male child. This requires three independent events to occur:\n1.  The male fetus inherits the X-chromosome carrying the premutation allele (probability = $0.5$).\n2.  The premutation allele expands to a full mutation during oogenesis (probability = $E = 0.20$).\n3.  The full mutation is expressed, causing the syndrome (penetrance = $1$).\n\nThus, the probability is the product of these individual probabilities:\n$$P(A | C) = (0.5) \\times E \\times 1 = (0.5)(0.20) = 0.10$$\n\nFinally, we combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to compute the desired probability $P(A | T^{-})$:\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = P(A | C) \\times P(C | T^{-})$$\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = 0.10 \\times \\frac{0.012}{0.762} = \\frac{0.0012}{0.762}$$\n$$P(A | T^{-}) \\approx 0.00157480315$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.001575$. This is the residual probability that the male child will be affected with Fragile X syndrome given the mother's negative carrier screen.",
