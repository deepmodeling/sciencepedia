            "problem": "A couple is evaluated for recurrence risk of a disorder of sex development caused by a pathogenic variant in the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene. The AR gene is located on the X chromosome, and pathogenic variants that cause loss of function lead to Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), which manifests clinically in $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ individuals with hemizygous pathogenic AR variants. For this problem, define an “affected offspring” as a live-born $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ child who expresses AIS due to the pathogenic AR variant.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- Under X-linked inheritance, a $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ child inherits his single X chromosome from his mother and the Y chromosome from his father.\n- Standard Mendelian segregation implies that, absent selection, a heterozygous mother transmits the variant allele to offspring with probability $1/2$.\n- Assume the probability of a live-born child being $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ is $1/2$, prenatal selection is negligible, and the father is $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ with a wild-type AR allele and is not mosaic.\n- In $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ hemizygotes for the pathogenic AR variant, clinical expression (penetrance) is $p=0.97$.\n- X-inactivation (Lyonization) occurs in female somatic cells and does not bias which X-linked allele is transmitted in oocytes because the X chromosomes are reactivated during oogenesis before meiosis.\n\nEvaluate the risk that the next child born to this couple will be an affected offspring under each of the following maternal states:\n1. The mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ heterozygous for the pathogenic AR variant, and her somatic X-inactivation is random, i.e., the fraction of somatic cells inactivating the X chromosome carrying the variant is $s=0.50$.\n2. The mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ heterozygous for the pathogenic AR variant, but her somatic X-inactivation is highly skewed, with $s=0.90$ of somatic cells inactivating the X chromosome carrying the variant.\n3. The mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ homozygous for the pathogenic AR variant.\n\nCompute the risk for each scenario using the foundational facts above. Express each risk as a decimal (not a percentage), rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical genetics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The task is to calculate the risk of having an \"affected offspring,\" which is defined as a live-born $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ child who expresses Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) due to a pathogenic variant in the X-linked Androgen Receptor (AR) gene.\n\nThe total risk, denoted as $P(\\text{Affected Offspring})$, is the product of three probabilities based on a sequence of independent events:\n$1$. The probability that the child is chromosomally male, $P(46,\\mathrm{XY})$.\n$2$. The probability that the child inherits the pathogenic AR allele from the mother, $P(\\text{Transmit})$. This probability depends on the mother's genetic status.\n$3$. The probability that a $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ individual with the pathogenic allele will clinically express the disorder (penetrance), denoted as $p$.\n\nThe general formula for the risk is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{Affected Offspring}) = P(46,\\mathrm{XY}) \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The probability of a live-born child being $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ is $P(46,\\mathrm{XY}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The penetrance of AIS in $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ hemizygotes is $p = 0.97$.\n- The father is $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ with a wild-type AR allele, so he cannot transmit the pathogenic variant. The child's risk depends solely on the mother.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$$P(\\text{Affected Offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times 0.97$$\n\nWe now evaluate this risk for each of the three specified maternal states. A critical piece of information provided is that somatic X-inactivation patterns, whether random or skewed, do not bias the segregation of alleles in the germline. This is due to the reactivation of the X chromosomes during oogenesis prior to meiosis. Therefore, any data on somatic X-inactivation are irrelevant to calculating the recurrence risk.\n\n**1. Mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ heterozygous, random somatic X-inactivation ($s=0.50$).**\nThe mother is heterozygous for the pathogenic AR variant. This means one of her X chromosomes carries the pathogenic allele and the other carries the wild-type allele. According to the principles of Mendelian segregation, she has a $1$ in $2$ chance of transmitting the X chromosome with the pathogenic allele to any given offspring. The fraction of somatic cells inactivating the variant-carrying X, $s=0.50$, is irrelevant to this germline transmission probability.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_1$, is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.97 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.97 = 0.2425$$\n\n**2. Mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ heterozygous, skewed somatic X-inactivation ($s=0.90$).**\nThe mother's genetic status at the germline level is identical to the first scenario: she is heterozygous. The fact that her somatic X-inactivation is highly skewed ($s=0.90$) may have clinical implications for her own phenotype, but as explicitly stated in the problem's foundational facts, it does not affect the probability of allele transmission to her offspring. Meiosis in the oocytes still follows standard Mendelian segregation.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_2$, is identical to the first:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.97 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.97 = 0.2425$$\n\n**3. Mother is $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ homozygous for the pathogenic AR variant.**\nIn this case, both of the mother's X chromosomes carry the pathogenic AR variant. Therefore, she will transmit a pathogenic allele to every one of her offspring, regardless of their sex. The probability of transmitting the pathogenic allele is certain.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = 1$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_3$, is:\n$$R_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 0.97 = 0.485$$\nTo express this with four significant figures, we write $0.4850$.\n\nIn summary, the risks for the three scenarios are $0.2425$, $0.2425$, and $0.4850$, respectively.",

Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are measured by Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) immediately before hCG administration and $72$ hours after the final hCG dose, using the same assay for all measurements. The following values are obtained:\n- Pre-hCG: testosterone $= 82$ ng/dL, DHT $= 4.1$ ng/dL.\n- Post-hCG: testosterone $= 540$ ng/dL, DHT $= 19$ ng/dL.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- The Central Dogma links pathogenic variants in the SRD5A2 gene to reduced SRD5A2 enzyme activity, thereby decreasing the biochemical conversion of testosterone to DHT.\n- Under short-interval stimulation testing and stable clearance, the instantaneous rate of product formation in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is, to first order, proportional to enzyme activity and to the available substrate concentration.\n- In age-matched controls tested under the same protocol and assay, the median post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio is $10$ (that is, a median post-hCG DHT-to-testosterone ratio of $0.1$).\n- A post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio greater than $20$ is widely used as a diagnostic threshold consistent with SRD5A2 deficiency in prepubertal testing.\n\nUsing only these data and assumptions, determine whether the post-hCG values meet the diagnostic criterion for SRD5A2 deficiency and, based on proportionality of DHT formation to enzyme activity and available testosterone, estimate the patient’s residual SRD5A2 activity relative to the control median as a decimal fraction.\n\nReport only the residual SRD5A2 activity relative to normal as the final numerical answer.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of endocrinology and medical genetics, specifically concerning the diagnosis of disorders of sex development. The givens are self-contained, consistent, and well-defined, constituting a well-posed problem. The language is objective and the scenario is clinically realistic. I will therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis based on the provided data and assumptions. First, we must determine if the patient's post-hCG hormone profile meets the diagnostic criterion for steroid $5\\alpha$-reductase type $2$ (SRD5A2) deficiency. Second, we must estimate the patient's residual SRD5A2 enzyme activity relative to the median activity of a control population.\n\nLet $T$ represent the serum testosterone concentration and $DHT$ represent the serum dihydrotestosterone concentration. The provided data for the patient are:\n- Pre-hCG: $T_{pre} = 82$ ng/dL, $DHT_{pre} = 4.1$ ng/dL.\n- Post-hCG: $T_{post, pt} = 540$ ng/dL, $DHT_{post, pt} = 19$ ng/dL.\n\nThe data for the control group is given as a median post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio:\n- $(\\frac{T}{DHT})_{post, control} = 10$.\n\nThe diagnostic threshold for SRD5A2 deficiency is given as a post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio greater than $20$.\n\nFirst, we check if the patient's results meet this diagnostic criterion. We calculate the patient's post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{T}{DHT}\\right)_{post, pt} = \\frac{T_{post, pt}}{DHT_{post, pt}} = \\frac{540 \\text{ ng/dL}}{19 \\text{ ng/dL}} = \\frac{540}{19} $$\n$$ \\frac{540}{19} \\approx 28.42 $$\nSince $28.42 > 20$, the patient's results meet the specified diagnostic criterion for SRD5A2 deficiency.\n\nNext, we estimate the residual SRD5A2 enzyme activity. The problem states that \"the instantaneous rate of product formation is, to first order, proportional to enzyme activity and to the available substrate concentration.\" The reaction is the conversion of testosterone (substrate) to DHT (product), catalyzed by the SRD5A2 enzyme.\nLet $R_{DHT}$ be the rate of DHT formation, $A$ be the SRD5A2 enzyme activity, and $[T]$ be the testosterone concentration. The relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ R_{DHT} \\propto A \\cdot [T] $$\n$$ R_{DHT} = k_{form} \\cdot A \\cdot [T] $$\nwhere $k_{form}$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nUnder the assumption of \"stable clearance,\" we can model the system at a pseudo-steady state where the rate of formation of DHT is balanced by its rate of clearance. Assuming first-order clearance, the rate of clearance is proportional to the DHT concentration, $[DHT]$:\n$$ R_{clear} = k_{clear} \\cdot [DHT] $$\nAt pseudo-steady state, $R_{DHT} = R_{clear}$:\n$$ k_{form} \\cdot A \\cdot [T] = k_{clear} \\cdot [DHT] $$\nRearranging this equation, we find the relationship between the hormone ratio and enzyme activity:\n$$ \\frac{[DHT]}{[T]} = \\frac{k_{form}}{k_{clear}} \\cdot A $$\nThis shows that the ratio of DHT to testosterone is directly proportional to the SRD5A2 enzyme activity, $A$. Let $K = \\frac{k_{form}}{k_{clear}}$ be the overall proportionality constant.\n$$ \\frac{[DHT]}{[T]} = K \\cdot A $$\n\nWe can apply this relationship to both the patient ($pt$) and the control median ($control$) using their post-hCG values:\nFor the patient:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt} = K \\cdot A_{pt} $$\nFor the control median:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, control} = K \\cdot A_{control} $$\n\nThe desired quantity is the patient's residual activity relative to the control median, which is the ratio $\\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}}$. We can find this by dividing the two equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt}}{\\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, control}} = \\frac{K \\cdot A_{pt}}{K \\cdot A_{control}} = \\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}} $$\n\nLet $A_{rel} = \\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}}$ be the relative residual activity. We now substitute the given values into this expression.\nThe patient's post-hCG DHT-to-testosterone ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt} = \\frac{19}{540} $$\nThe control's median post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio is given as $10$. Therefore, the median DHT-to-testosterone ratio is the reciprocal:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, control} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{T}{DHT}\\right)_{post, control}} = \\frac{1}{10} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the relative activity:\n$$ A_{rel} = \\frac{\\frac{19}{540}}{\\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{19}{540} \\times 10 = \\frac{190}{540} = \\frac{19}{54} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ A_{rel} = \\frac{19}{54} \\approx 0.35185185... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ A_{rel} \\approx 0.352 $$\nThis decimal fraction represents the patient's estimated residual SRD5A2 activity relative to the median activity of the control group.",

            "problem": "A family presents for counseling regarding future reproductive risk related to a known variant in Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 5 Group A Member 1 (NR5A1), a gene implicated in disorders of sex development. The proband is a $46,XY$ individual with a confirmed heterozygous pathogenic NR5A1 variant and clinical features consistent with $46,XY$ disorder of sex development. The parents are phenotypically unaffected, with the father being $46,XY$ and the mother $46,XX$. One $46,XY$ sibling is unaffected.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a recurrence risk, which necessitates updating prior beliefs about the origin of the proband's mutation using the evidence from the family history. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet the three mutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin of the proband’s pathogenic variant be:\n-   $H_F$: The father is a carrier, and the proband inherited the variant from him.\n-   $H_M$: The mother is a carrier, and the proband inherited the variant from her.\n-   $H_D$: The variant arose de novo in the proband; neither parent is a carrier.\n\nThe prior probabilities for these hypotheses are given as:\n-   $P(H_F) = \\pi_F = 0.25$\n-   $P(H_M) = \\pi_M = 0.25$\n-   $P(H_D) = \\pi_D = 0.5$\n\nThe evidence, $E$, consists of the phenotypes of the father and the sibling:\n-   $E_1$: The $46,XY$ father is unaffected.\n-   $E_2$: The $46,XY$ sibling is unaffected.\nThe total evidence is $E = E_1 \\cap E_2$. We assume the phenotypes are conditionally independent given the parental genotypes.\n\nWe must calculate the likelihood of observing this evidence under each hypothesis, $P(E|H_i)$.\n\n1.  **Likelihood for $H_F$ (Father is a carrier):**\n    -   $P(E_1|H_F)$: The father is a $46,XY$ carrier but is phenotypically unaffected. This occurs with probability $(1-p)$, where $p=0.6$ is the penetrance. So, $P(E_1|H_F) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.\n    -   $P(E_2|H_F)$: The $46,XY$ sibling is unaffected. This can happen in two ways: either the sibling did not inherit the variant from the father (probability $0.5$) or the sibling inherited the variant (probability $0.5$) but is unaffected due to non-penetrance (probability $1-p$).\n    $$P(E_2|H_F) = (0.5 \\times 1) + (0.5 \\times (1-p)) = 0.5 \\times (1 + 1 - p) = 0.5 \\times (2-p)$$\n    Substituting $p=0.6$, we get $P(E_2|H_F) = 0.5 \\times (2-0.6) = 0.5 \\times 1.4 = 0.7$.\n    -   The total likelihood is $P(E|H_F) = P(E_1|H_F) \\times P(E_2|H_F) = (1-p) \\times 0.5(2-p) = 0.4 \\times 0.7 = 0.28$.\n\n2.  **Likelihood for $H_M$ (Mother is a carrier):**\n    -   $P(E_1|H_M)$: The father is unaffected. Under this hypothesis, the father is not a carrier, so he is guaranteed to be unaffected. $P(E_1|H_M) = 1$.\n    -   $P(E_2|H_M)$: The $46,XY$ sibling is unaffected. The logic is identical to the case where the father is the carrier, but the variant is transmitted from the mother.\n    $$P(E_2|H_M) = (0.5 \\times 1) + (0.5 \\times (1-p)) = 0.5(2-p) = 0.7$$\n    -   The total likelihood is $P(E|H_M) = P(E_1|H_M) \\times P(E_2|H_M) = 1 \\times 0.7 = 0.7$.\n\n3.  **Likelihood for $H_D$ (De novo):**\n    -   $P(E_1|H_D)$: The father is unaffected. Under this hypothesis, he is not a carrier. $P(E_1|H_D) = 1$.\n    -   $P(E_2|H_D)$: The $46,XY$ sibling is unaffected. Under this hypothesis, the parents are not carriers, so the sibling would not inherit the variant. The possibility of the sibling having their own independent de novo mutation is negligible and typically ignored in this context. Thus, the sibling is unaffected. $P(E_2|H_D) = 1$.\n    -   The total likelihood is $P(E|H_D) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nNow, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of each hypothesis, $P(H_i|E) = \\frac{P(E|H_i)P(H_i)}{P(E)}$.\nFirst, we compute the marginal probability of the evidence, $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = P(E|H_F)P(H_F) + P(E|H_M)P(H_M) + P(E|H_D)P(H_D)$$\n$$P(E) = (0.28)(0.25) + (0.7)(0.25) + (1)(0.5)$$\n$$P(E) = 0.07 + 0.175 + 0.5 = 0.745$$\n\nThe posterior probabilities are:\n-   $P(H_F|E) = \\frac{0.07}{0.745}$\n-   $P(H_M|E) = \\frac{0.175}{0.745}$\n-   $P(H_D|E) = \\frac{0.5}{0.745}$\n\nThe posterior probability that a parent is a carrier is the sum of the posteriors for $H_F$ and $H_M$:\n$$P(\\text{parent carrier}|E) = P(H_F|E) + P(H_M|E) = \\frac{0.07 + 0.175}{0.745} = \\frac{0.245}{0.745} \\approx 0.328859$$\n\nNext, we compute the recurrence risk ($RR$) for a future $46,XY$ child to be affected. This is the total probability, weighted by the posterior probabilities of each hypothesis.\n$$RR = P(\\text{affected}|E) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{F,M,D\\}} P(\\text{affected}|H_i) P(H_i|E)$$\n\nWe need the risk of an affected $46,XY$ child conditional on each hypothesis:\n-   $P(\\text{affected}|H_F)$: If the father is the carrier, the risk is (prob. of transmission) $\\times$ (prob. of expression). $P(\\text{affected}|H_F) = 0.5 \\times p = 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3$.\n-   $P(\\text{affected}|H_M)$: If the mother is the carrier, the risk is the same. $P(\\text{affected}|H_M) = 0.5 \\times p = 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3$.\n-   $P(\\text{affected}|H_D)$: If the variant was de novo in the proband, the risk to a future child is the risk of a new de novo event, $\\mu$, followed by expression of the phenotype, $p$. $P(\\text{affected}|H_D) = \\mu \\times p = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.6 = 0.6 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nNow, we combine these to find the total recurrence risk:\n$$RR = P(\\text{affected}|H_F)P(H_F|E) + P(\\text{affected}|H_M)P(H_M|E) + P(\\text{affected}|H_D)P(H_D|E)$$\n$$RR = (0.3)\\left(\\frac{0.07}{0.745}\\right) + (0.3)\\left(\\frac{0.175}{0.745}\\right) + (0.6 \\times 10^{-5})\\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.745}\\right)$$\n$$RR = \\frac{1}{0.745} [ (0.3)(0.07) + (0.3)(0.175) + (0.6 \\times 10^{-5})(0.5) ]$$\n$$RR = \\frac{1}{0.745} [ 0.021 + 0.0525 + 0.000003 ]$$\n$$RR = \\frac{0.0735 + 0.000003}{0.745} = \\frac{0.073503}{0.745}$$\n$$RR \\approx 0.098661744966...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.09866$.",
