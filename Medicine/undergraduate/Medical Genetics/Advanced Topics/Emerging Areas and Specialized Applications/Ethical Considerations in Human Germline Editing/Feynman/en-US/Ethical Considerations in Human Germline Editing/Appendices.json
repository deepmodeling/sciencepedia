            "introduction": "Ethical decision-making in medicine often involves balancing potential benefits against foreseeable risks. This practice provides a quantitative method for this balancing act by applying a consequentialist framework, where an action's morality is judged by its outcomes. By modeling the expected net benefit of a germline editing procedure, you will derive a clear 'permissibility threshold'—a maximum acceptable risk level—which is a foundational skill in clinical ethics and health technology assessment .",

            "problem": "A clinical ethics board is evaluating whether Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) germline editing should be approved to correct a pathogenic variant that causes a severe early-onset monogenic disorder. In a simplified consequentialist framework grounded in expected utility, let the expected net benefit in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) be modeled as $E=(1-p)B - pC$, where $p$ is the probability of a severe editing-related harm that would negate the intended benefit, $B$ is the QALYs gained if editing succeeds relative to no intervention, and $C$ is the QALYs lost if the severe harm occurs. Assume $B$ and $C$ are ethically-weighted QALYs for the future person, consistent with standard decision theory and utilitarian consequentialism.\n\nStarting from the foundational definition of expected value and the decision rule to intervene only when the expected net QALYs satisfy $E>0$, derive the permissibility threshold $p^{\\ast}$ as a function of $B$ and $C$. Then, for the specified scenario with $B=24$ QALYs and $C=80$ QALYs, compute $p^{\\ast}$ and report it as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The ethical analysis uses the consequentialist principle that actions are justified when they maximize expected value, here quantified as expected net Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).

This exercise moves our focus to the principle of distributive justice, using a model inspired by John Rawls’s difference principle to guide the allocation of a limited number of germline editing procedures. You will use the maximin criterion to determine an allocation that prioritizes improving the well-being of the least advantaged group, illustrating how ethical principles can be formalized to address issues of equity in healthcare .",

            "problem": "A public health authority must decide how to allocate a fixed capacity of $C = 100$ germline editing procedures across two subpopulations during a single planning period. Subpopulation $L$ is the least advantaged group, with a higher burden of severe, early-onset Mendelian disorders; subpopulation $H$ is the more advantaged group, with lower genetic disease burden. In medical genetics and health policy, an ethically relevant outcome proxy is Healthy Life Years (HLY), defined as the expected lifetime years lived in good health. Assume fractional allocation is feasible because the plan aggregates over many cycles and clinics.\n\nLet the baseline expected Healthy Life Years (HLY) in the absence of editing be $W_{L}^{0} = 45$ for subpopulation $L$ and $W_{H}^{0} = 65$ for subpopulation $H$. Due to triage that prioritizes the most severe variants first and the diminishing returns typical in risk-targeted interventions, the incremental HLY gains from allocating $x$ edits to $L$ and $C - x$ edits to $H$ follow concave functions:\n$$\ng_{L}(x) = 3\\sqrt{x}, \\quad g_{H}(C-x) = \\sqrt{C - x}.\n$$\nThus, the post-allocation well-being levels are\n$$\nW_{L}(x) = W_{L}^{0} + g_{L}(x) = 45 + 3\\sqrt{x}, \\quad W_{H}(x) = W_{H}^{0} + g_{H}(C-x) = 65 + \\sqrt{100 - x}.\n$$\n\nUse the core definition of John Rawls’s difference principle (“social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged”) operationalized by the maximin criterion (choose the policy that maximizes the minimum of group outcomes) to determine the ethically optimal allocation $x^{\\ast}$ to subpopulation $L$.

            "introduction": "The societal implications of germline editing extend beyond therapeutic applications to the possibility of human enhancement, raising concerns about social competition and inequality. This practice utilizes game theory to model a potential 'arms race' for genetic enhancements, where individually rational choices can lead to a collectively undesirable outcome.

            "problem": "A medical genetics ethics committee is evaluating potential societal dynamics if heritable enhancement becomes technically feasible and legal. Consider two large populations, labeled $A$ and $B$, whose members are randomly matched across populations for status-sensitive competitions (for example, high-stakes admissions or employment). Each individual chooses between two strategies: adopt a heritable enhancement (strategy $E$) or refrain (strategy $N$). Let $S>0$ denote the benefit associated with being enhanced relative to a non-enhanced rival in a competitive interaction (a positional or status benefit), and let $H>0$ denote the expected health risk cost associated with adopting heritable enhancement.\n\nAssume the following individual-level payoffs per match:\n- If both individuals adopt ($E$ vs. $E$): each receives $-H$ (both incur health risk, no relative status advantage).\n- If you adopt and the rival does not ($E$ vs. $N$): you receive $S-H$, the rival receives $-S$.\n- If you do not adopt and the rival adopts ($N$ vs. $E$): you receive $-S$, the rival receives $S-H$.\n- If neither adopts ($N$ vs. $N$): each receives $0$.\n\nModel the situation as a symmetric $2 \\times 2$ game with random matching across the two populations. Using the definition of Nash equilibrium (a strategy profile where no individual can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally deviating) and expected utility from mixed strategies, derive the set of Nash equilibria as functions of $S$ and $H$. Define an “arms race escalation” as the case where the unique Nash equilibrium yields adoption with probability $1$ in both populations.\n\nLet $r^{\\ast}$ denote the critical ratio $S/H$ at which the equilibrium transitions from no adoption to arms race escalation.

            "solution": "To find the Nash equilibria of this symmetric $2 \\times 2$ game, we first construct the payoff matrix for one player (e.g., Player A, the Row player) against another (Player B, the Column player). The strategies are Enhance ($E$) and Not Enhance ($N$). The parameters are the positional benefit $S>0$ and the health cost $H>0$.\n\nThe payoff matrix for Player A is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n\\text{Player A} \\backslash \\text{Player B} & E & N \\\\\n\\hline\nE & -H & S-H \\\\\nN & -S & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nA Nash Equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We analyze the players' best responses based on the relationship between $S$ and $H$.\n\n**Case 1: $S > H$ (Positional benefit outweighs health cost)**\n*   If Player B chooses $E$, Player A's best response is to choose $E$ because the payoff $-H$ is greater than $-S$ (since $S>H \\implies -H > -S$).\n*   If Player B chooses $N$, Player A's best response is to choose $E$ because the payoff $S-H$ is greater than $0$ (since $S>H$).\nIn this case, strategy $E$ is a strictly dominant strategy for Player A. By symmetry, it is also the dominant strategy for Player B. The unique Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose Enhance, resulting in the strategy profile $(E, E)$. This corresponds to the \"arms race escalation.\"\n\n**Case 2: $S < H$ (Health cost outweighs positional benefit)**\n*   If Player B chooses $E$, Player A's best response is to choose $N$ because the payoff $-S$ is greater than $-H$ (since $S<H \\implies -S > -H$).\n*   If Player B chooses $N$, Player A's best response is to choose $N$ because the payoff $0$ is greater than $S-H$ (since $S<H$).\nHere, strategy $N$ is a strictly dominant strategy for both players. The unique Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose Not Enhance, resulting in the strategy profile $(N, N)$. This is the \"no adoption\" outcome.\n\n**Case 3: $S = H$ (Positional benefit equals health cost)**\n*   If Player B chooses $E$, Player A is indifferent between $E$ (payoff $-H$) and $N$ (payoff $-S=-H$).\n*   If Player B chooses $N$, Player A is indifferent between $E$ (payoff $S-H=0$) and $N$ (payoff $0$).\nIn this case, any strategy is a best response to any strategy of the opponent. Any mixture of strategies constitutes a Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical ratio $r^{\\ast} = S/H$ where the equilibrium transitions from \"no adoption\" to \"arms race escalation.\"\n- The \"no adoption\" equilibrium $(N, N)$ is unique when $S < H$, which is equivalent to the ratio $S/H < 1$.\n- The \"arms race escalation\" equilibrium $(E, E)$ is unique when $S > H$, which is equivalent to the ratio $S/H > 1$.\n\nThe transition between these two distinct outcomes occurs at the boundary where $S = H$, or when the ratio $r = S/H$ is exactly $1$. Therefore, the critical ratio is:\n$$ r^{\\ast} = 1 $$\nIf $r > 1$, the strategic logic leads to an arms race. If $r < 1$, the logic leads to mutual restraint.
