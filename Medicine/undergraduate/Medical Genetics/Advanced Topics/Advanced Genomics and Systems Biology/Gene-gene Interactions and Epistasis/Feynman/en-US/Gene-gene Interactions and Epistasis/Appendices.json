In this scenario, an allele at one locus can completely mask the phenotypic expression of alleles at a different, non-allelic locus. This exercise  challenges you to apply this rule to a dihybrid cross, translating the logic of genetic suppression into expected phenotypic ratios, a core skill for predicting the inheritance patterns of interacting genes.",

            "problem": "A clinician investigates a congenital disorder in which the activity of one locus is suppressed by a second locus. Let locus $C$ encode a protein that, when present in at least one dominant copy ($C$), would produce a measurable phenotype called the functional phenotype. Let locus $S$ encode a dominant suppressor that blocks the action of locus $C$ whenever at least one dominant $S$ allele is present. Thus, individuals with genotype $S-$ (that is, $SS$ or $Ss$) do not show the functional phenotype, regardless of their genotype at $C$. Individuals with genotype $ss$ show the functional phenotype only if they carry at least one dominant $C$ allele. Assume complete dominance at both loci, complete suppression by $S$, independent assortment, and complete penetrance. Two clinically unaffected parents are each double heterozygotes ($Cc \\, Ss$) and have a large number of children.\n\nStarting from Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment (each allele at each locus segregates with probabilities $1/2$ to gametes, and loci assort independently), and the definitions above for suppression and dominance, derive the expected phenotypic segregation of unaffected to functional phenotypes in the children under this dominant suppressor interaction model. In your working, explicitly enumerate the two-locus genotype classes that confer each phenotype according to the model.\n\nWhat is the exact fraction of children expected to show the functional phenotype under these assumptions? Express your final answer as a single reduced fraction. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a classic case of dominant epistasis (suppression) in Mendelian genetics. All necessary information, including parental genotypes, dominance relationships, and inheritance patterns (independent assortment), is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem describes a dihybrid cross between two parents who are both double heterozygotes with the genotype $Cc \\, Ss$. The cross is therefore $Cc \\, Ss \\times Cc \\, Ss$.\n\nAccording to Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment, the segregation of alleles at the $C$ locus is independent of the segregation of alleles at the $S$ locus. We can analyze the outcomes for each locus separately.\n\nFor the $C$ locus, the cross is $Cc \\times Cc$. The expected genotypic ratio in the offspring is $1 \\, CC : 2 \\, Cc : 1 \\, cc$. Given complete dominance, genotypes $CC$ and $Cc$ produce the same phenotype. We denote the presence of at least one dominant $C$ allele as $C-$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the genotype $C-$ (i.e., $CC$ or $Cc$) is:\n$$P(C-) = P(CC) + P(Cc) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe probability of an offspring having the recessive genotype $cc$ is:\n$$P(cc) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nFor the $S$ locus, the cross is $Ss \\times Ss$. The expected genotypic ratio is $1 \\, SS : 2 \\, Ss : 1 \\, ss$. Given complete dominance, genotypes $SS$ and $Ss$ produce the suppressor phenotype. We denote the presence of at least one dominant $S$ allele as $S-$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the genotype $S-$ (i.e., $SS$ or $Ss$) is:\n$$P(S-) = P(SS) + P(Ss) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe probability of an offspring having the recessive genotype $ss$ is:\n$$P(ss) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSince the loci assort independently, we can use the product rule to find the probabilities of the combined two-locus genotypes. There are four genotypic classes:\n1.  $P(C- S-) = P(C-) \\times P(S-) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$\n2.  $P(C- ss) = P(C-) \\times P(ss) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n3.  $P(cc S-) = P(cc) \\times P(S-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n4.  $P(cc ss) = P(cc) \\times P(ss) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nNow, we map these genotypic classes to the phenotypes based on the rules of dominant suppression provided.\n\nThe functional phenotype is expressed only in individuals who carry at least one dominant $C$ allele and are homozygous recessive $ss$ at the suppressor locus.\n- **Functional Phenotype**: This phenotype corresponds to the genotype class $C- \\, ss$. The probability of an offspring exhibiting the functional phenotype is:\n$$P(\\text{Functional}) = P(C- \\, ss) = \\frac{3}{16}$$\n\nAn individual is clinically unaffected if they do not show the functional phenotype. This occurs under three conditions:\n1.  The dominant suppressor allele $S$ is present ($S-$). This blocks the expression of the $C$ allele, regardless of the genotype at the $C$ locus. This corresponds to the genotype classes $C- \\, S-$ and $cc \\, S-$.\n2.  The individual is homozygous recessive $cc$. In this case, there is no functional protein to be produced, so no phenotype is observed. This corresponds to the genotype class $cc \\, ss$. (The class $cc \\, S-$ is already covered by the first condition).\n\nLet's explicitly enumerate the genotype classes conferring the unaffected phenotype:\n- Genotype class $C- \\, S-$: Action of $C$ is suppressed by $S$. These are unaffected. Probability is $\\frac{9}{16}$.\n- Genotype class $cc \\, S-$: No $C$ allele to be expressed. These are unaffected. Probability is $\\frac{3}{16}$.\n- Genotype class $cc \\, ss$: No $C$ allele to be expressed. These are unaffected. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe total probability of an offspring being unaffected is the sum of the probabilities of these mutually exclusive genotypic classes:\n$$P(\\text{Unaffected}) = P(C- \\, S-) + P(cc \\, S-) + P(cc \\, ss) = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$$\nAs a check, the sum of probabilities for all phenotypes must be $1$: $P(\\text{Functional}) + P(\\text{Unaffected}) = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$.\n\nThe expected phenotypic segregation ratio of unaffected to functional phenotypes is $13:3$.\n\nThe specific question is to find the exact fraction of children expected to show the functional phenotype. As determined above, this corresponds to the genotype class $C- \\, ss$.\nThe fraction is $\\frac{3}{16}$. This fraction is already in its simplest reduced form.",

            "problem": "A clinician is studying a congenital metabolic disorder in which two genes, denoted by locus $A$ with alleles $A$ (functional) and $a$ (loss-of-function) and locus $B$ with alleles $B$ (functional) and $b$ (loss-of-function), encode redundant enzymes for the same indispensable reaction. The redundancy is such that an individual is metabolically normal if at least one functional allele is present at either locus, and metabolically affected only if neither locus contributes any functional allele.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Genes and Alleles:** Two genes, locus $A$ (alleles $A$ for functional, $a$ for loss-of-function) and locus $B$ (alleles $B$ for functional, $b$ for loss-of-function).\n- **Gene Interaction:** The genes encode redundant enzymes for an indispensable reaction.\n- **Phenotype Rule:** An individual is metabolically normal if at least one functional allele is present at either locus. An individual is metabolically affected only if neither locus contributes any functional allele.\n- **Dominance:** Complete dominance at each locus ($A$ is dominant to $a$, and $B$ is dominant to $b$).\n- **Penetrance:** Complete penetrance.\n- **Assortment:** Mendelian independent assortment.\n- **Parental Cross:** Two carriers, both with genotype $AaBb$, mate.\n- **Offspring Generation:** The analysis is for the second filial generation ($F_2$).\n- **Tasks:**\n    1.

Compute the exact fraction of affected $F_2$ offspring.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically valid.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes duplicate dominant epistasis, a well-established mechanism in Mendelian genetics. The biological premise of redundant enzymes is a known basis for this type of gene interaction. All concepts used (alleles, loci, dominance, independent assortment, epistasis) are fundamental to genetics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined, with all necessary conditions provided. The initial genotypes of the parents and the rules of inheritance are specified, leading to a unique, determinable outcome for the offspring generation.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and unambiguous. Terms have precise scientific meanings.\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific principles. It is a standard, solvable problem in medical genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks in order.\n\n**Task 1: Genotype-to-Phenotype Rule Set**\n\nThe problem describes a type of gene interaction known as duplicate dominant epistasis. The phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant (functional) alleles at two different loci, $A$ and $B$.\n\n- **Dominance:** Due to complete dominance, the presence of a single $A$ allele is sufficient to create a functional product from the $A$ locus. Therefore, genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ are phenotypically equivalent at this locus. We denote this condition as $A-$. Similarly, genotypes $BB$ and $Bb$ are phenotypically equivalent at the $B$ locus, denoted as $B-$. The loss-of-function phenotype only appears with the homozygous recessive genotypes, $aa$ and $bb$.\n\n- **Phenotype Definition:** The problem states that a normal phenotype results \"if at least one functional allele is present at either locus.\" This translates to the condition that the organism must have at least one dominant allele at locus $A$ OR at least one dominant allele at locus $B$.\n- **Affected Phenotype:** The affected phenotype occurs \"only if neither locus contributes any functional allele.\" This means the individual must be homozygous recessive at both loci simultaneously.\n\nBased on this, the formal genotype-to-phenotype rule set is:\n- **Normal Phenotype:** An individual exhibits the normal phenotype if their genotype is of the form $A- B-$, $A- bb$, or $aa B-$. This fulfills the condition of having at least one dominant allele at either locus $A$ or locus $B$.\n- **Affected Phenotype:** An individual exhibits the affected phenotype only if their genotype is $aa bb$. This is the sole genotype lacking a dominant allele at both loci.\n\n**Task 2: Proof of the $15:1$ Ratio**\n\nWe are asked to derive the phenotypic ratio from a dihybrid cross ($AaBb \\times AaBb$) using conditional counting based on segregation and independent assortment, without enumerating the $16$ possible offspring genotypes.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities for the genotypes at each locus independently from a monohybrid cross.\nFor the $A$ locus, the cross is $Aa \\times Aa$. According to the law of segregation, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- $P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the probability of an offspring having at least one dominant $A$ allele (genotype $A-$):\n$$P(A-) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe probability of an offspring being homozygous recessive at the $A$ locus is:\n$$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the $B$ locus, the cross $Bb \\times Bb$ yields identical probabilities:\n$$P(B-) = P(BB) + P(Bb) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n$$P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe simplest approach is to calculate the probability of the single genotype that produces the affected phenotype. According to the rule set from Task $1$, an individual is affected only if their genotype is $aa bb$. Because the genes assort independently, the probability of this combined genotype is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa \\text{ and } bb) = P(aa) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nAll other genotypic combinations result in a normal phenotype. The total probability of all outcomes is $1$. Therefore, the probability of an offspring being normal is:\n$$P(\\text{normal}) = 1 - P(\\text{affected}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}$$\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of normal to affected offspring is the ratio of their respective probabilities:\n$$\\text{Ratio (Normal : Affected)} = P(\\text{normal}) : P(\\text{affected}) = \\frac{15}{16} : \\frac{1}{16}$$\nMultiplying by $16$ to express this as a ratio of integers gives $15:1$. This proves the classical duplicate gene action ratio without enumerating the full Punnett square.\n\n**Task 3: Fraction of Affected Offspring**\n\nThe exact fraction of $F_2$ offspring expected to be affected was calculated as an intermediate step in Task $2$. As derived above, the probability of the affected phenotype, which corresponds to the genotype $aa bb$, is:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThis is the final numerical answer requested.",

We can compute this as $\\sum_{k_A} f(k_A)(k_A-0.6)I(k_A)$, where $I(k_A) = \\sum_{k_B} f(k_B)G_{k_A,k_B}(k_B-1.2)$.\n- $I(0) = (0.16)(5)(-1.2) + (0.48)(3)(-0.2) + (0.36)(1)(0.8) = -0.96 - 0.288 + 0.288 = -0.96$\n- $I(1) = (0.16)(8)(-1.2) + (0.48)(10)(-0.2) + (0.36)(12)(0.8) = -1.536 - 0.96 + 3.456 = 0.96$\n- $I(2) = (0.16)(11)(-1.2) + (0.48)(17)(-0.2) + (0.36)(23)(0.8) = -2.112 - 1.632 + 6.624 = 2.88$\n\nNow, we compute $S$:\n$$ S = (0.49)(-0.6)I(0) + (0.42)(0.4)I(1) + (0.09)(1.4)I(2) $$\n$$ S = (0.49)(-0.6)(-0.96) + (0.42)(0.4)(0.96) + (0.09)(1.4)(2.88) $$\n$$ S = 0.28224 + 0.16128 + 0.36288 = 0.8064 $$\nHence, $\\beta_{AA} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{0.42 \\cdot 0.48}} = \\frac{0.8064}{\\sqrt{0.2016}}$.\nThe additive-by-additive epistatic variance is $V_{AA} = \\beta_{AA}^2 = \\frac{0.8064^2}{0.2016} = \\frac{0.65028096}{0.2016} = 3.2256$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the results to four significant figures.\n$V_A = 25.6296 \\approx 25.63$\n$V_{AA} = 3.2256 \\approx 3.226$\nThe final answer is reported as two numbers in the order $V_A$ and $V_{AA}$.",
