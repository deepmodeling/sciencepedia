            "problem": "Inherited variants in Tumor Protein p53 (TP53) underlie Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a cancer predisposition disorder in which the p53 transcription factor functions as a tetramer composed of $4$ identical subunits. The Central Dogma of molecular biology (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to protein) implies that a heterozygous loss-of-function *TP53* allele produces a pool of mutant p53 monomers alongside wild-type monomers. Empirical observations establish that p53 tetramer function requires integrity of its subunits: a single mutant subunit within a tetramer exerts a dominant-negative (DN) effect, rendering that tetramer nonfunctional.\n\nConsider a large cell population in which the fraction of p53 monomers that are mutant is $p$, with $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$. Tetramers assemble randomly from the monomer pool, and the composition of each tetramer can be modeled by independently drawing $4$ subunits from this pool. Only tetramers composed entirely of wild-type subunits are functional.\n\nUsing first principles of probability appropriate to independent draws from a large reservoir, derive a closed-form expression $F(p)$ for the expected fraction of fully functional p53 tetramers in this population. Provide your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $p$. No numerical approximation or rounding is required, and no units are involved in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent framework for a probabilistic analysis of protein complex formation based on established principles of molecular biology and genetics, specifically concerning dominant-negative mutations in oligomeric proteins like p53. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction of fully functional p53 tetramers, denoted as $F(p)$, in a large cell population where the fraction of mutant p53 monomers is $p$.\n\nFirst, we define the probabilities of selecting a single monomer of each type from the large cellular pool.\nLet $M$ be the event that a randomly selected monomer is mutant.\nLet $W$ be the event that a randomly selected monomer is wild-type.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the fraction of mutant monomers is $p$. As the pool consists only of mutant and wild-type monomers, the probabilities of these events are:\n$P(M) = p$\n$P(W) = 1 - p$\nThe condition $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$ ensures that these are valid probabilities.\n\nA p53 transcription factor is a tetramer, meaning it is composed of $4$ subunits. The problem states that tetramers assemble randomly and the composition of each can be modeled by independently drawing $4$ subunits from the monomer pool. The assumption of a \"large pool\" implies that the probability of drawing a mutant or wild-type monomer remains constant for each of the $4$ draws; this is analogous to sampling with replacement.\n\nThe condition for a tetramer to be functional is that it must be composed entirely of wild-type subunits. A single mutant subunit is sufficient to render the entire tetramer nonfunctional, a phenomenon known as a dominant-negative effect.\n\nTherefore, to form a functional tetramer, all $4$ independent draws must result in a wild-type monomer. Let the four draws be represented by the events $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. A functional tetramer corresponds to the compound event where $S_1=W$, $S_2=W$, $S_3=W$, and $S_4=W$.\n\nThe probability of this compound event, which we will call $P_{\\text{functional}}$, is the joint probability of these four individual events occurring:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = P(S_1=W \\cap S_2=W \\cap S_3=W \\cap S_4=W)$$\nBecause the draws are independent events, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = P(S_1=W) \\times P(S_2=W) \\times P(S_3=W) \\times P(S_4=W)$$\nSubstituting the probability of drawing a single wild-type monomer, $P(W) = 1 - p$:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times (1 - p)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = (1 - p)^{4}$$\nThis expression gives the probability that any single tetramer, formed by random assembly, will be functional.\n\nBy the law of large numbers, for a large population of such tetramers, the expected fraction of fully functional tetramers, $F(p)$, will be equal to this probability.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the expected fraction of fully functional p53 tetramers is:\n$$F(p) = (1 - p)^{4}$$\nThis is a simplified analytic expression in terms of $p$, as required. For a heterozygous individual where transcription and translation from both alleles are equal, one might approximate $p=0.5$. In this specific case, the fraction of functional tetramers would be $(1 - 0.5)^4 = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625$, or $6.25\\%$, illustrating the potent effect of the dominant-negative mutation. However, the problem correctly asks for the general expression in terms of $p$.",

It presents a clear, formalizable task based on established concepts such as Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), heterozygosity, and mosaicism.\n\nThe Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the total number of variant alleles divided by the total number of all alleles in the bulk sample. We can express this formally as:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{\\text{variant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{variant}}$ is the total count of the specific variant allele and $N_{\\text{total}}$ is the total count of all alleles (variant and wild-type) at that genetic locus across all cells in the sample.\n\nThe problem states that the sample contains $N$ diploid nucleated blood cells. Since the cells are diploid and there are no copy-number changes at the *TP53* locus, each cell contributes exactly $2$ alleles. Therefore, the total number of alleles in the sample is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = N \\times 2 = 2N\n$$\nThis denominator is the same for both scenarios. The calculation of the expected VAF for each scenario thus requires determining the total number of variant alleles, $N_{\\text{variant}}$.\n\n**Scenario (1): Germline Heterozygous Variant**\n\nIn this scenario, every cell in the sample is heterozygous for the *TP53* variant.

A fraction $f$ of the cells are heterozygous for the variant, while the remaining fraction, $1 - f$, are wild-type. The problem specifies $f = 0.20$.\n\n- Total number of cells: $N$\n- Fraction of heterozygous cells: $f = 0.20$\n- Number of heterozygous cells: $f \\times N = 0.20N$\n- Fraction of wild-type cells: $1 - f = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n- Number of wild-type cells: $(1 - f)N = 0.80N$\n\nTo find the total number of variant alleles, $N_{\\text{variant, (2)}}$, we sum the contributions from each cell population.\n- The heterozygous cells ($0.20N$ of them) each contribute $1$ variant allele.\n- The wild-type cells ($0.80N$ of them) each contribute $0$ variant alleles.\n\nSo, the total number of variant alleles is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{variant, (2)}} = (0.20N \\times 1) + (0.80N \\times 0) = 0.20N\n$$\nThe total number of alleles in the sample, $N_{\\text{total}}$, remains $2N$, as all cells are diploid.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in medical genetics that requires synthesizing quantitative and qualitative genomic data to deduce the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a rigorous, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n-   An individual has Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with a germline heterozygous missense variant in the *TP53* gene.\n-   The sample is a resected sarcoma.\n-   Targeted sequencing shows a Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) for the *TP53* variant of approximately $80\\%$.\n-   Tumor purity is estimated to be approximately $60\\%$.\n-   Copy number (CN) data for chromosome $17p$ (where *TP53* is located) show:\n    -   Total copy number is near $2$.\n    -   The log-ratio is approximately $0$.\n    -   B-allele frequency (BAF) shows clusters near $0$ and $1$.\n-   Foundational facts:\n    1.  A normal diploid genome has $2$ alleles.\n    2.  A germline heterozygote has $1$ variant and $1$ reference allele in normal cells.\n    3.  Observed VAF is a weighted average of tumor and normal cell populations.\n    4.  Copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (cnLOH), or uniparental disomy, maintains a total CN of $2$ while creating regional homozygosity.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of cancer genetics and genomics. Li-Fraumeni syndrome, *TP53* mutations, Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, and the interpretation of sequencing data (VAF, purity, CN, BAF) are all standard and well-established concepts. The location of *TP53* on chromosome $17p$ is correct.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient quantitative and qualitative data to allow for a unique, determinable solution. The question is precise, asking for the best explanation that reconciles all provided data.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical and objective. All data are presented as measurements (VAF, purity, log-ratio, BAF patterns).\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The data are complete and internally consistent. For example, a log-ratio of approximately $0$ is mathematically consistent with a total copy number of $2$ (since $\\log_2(2_{tumor\\_copies}/2_{normal\\_copies}) = \\log_2(1) = 0$). The scenario describes a classic mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in a hereditary cancer syndrome.\n-   **Feasibility:** The scenario is not only feasible but is a textbook example of somatic events in LFS-associated tumors. The VAF and purity values are realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous solution. I will proceed to derive the answer.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe observed Variant Allele Fraction ($VAF_{obs}$) in a bulk tumor sample is a weighted average of the allele fractions in the tumor ($VAF_T$) and normal ($VAF_N$) cell compartments. The weights are the tumor purity ($P$) and the normal cell contamination ($1-P$).\n\nThe number of variant alleles in the sample is proportional to the sum of variant alleles from tumor cells and normal cells: $(P \\times n_{V,T}) + ((1-P) \\times n_{V,N})$.\nThe total number of alleles at that locus in the sample is proportional to the sum of total alleles from tumor and normal cells: $(P \\times n_{T,total}) + ((1-P) \\times n_{N,total})$.\n\nThe formula for the observed VAF is:\n$$ VAF_{obs} = \\frac{(P \\times n_{V,T}) + ((1-P) \\times n_{V,N})}{(P \\times n_{T,total}) + ((1-P) \\times n_{N,total})} $$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   $VAF_{obs} \\approx 0.80$\n-   $P \\approx 0.60$\n-   Normal cells are diploid, so the total number of alleles is $n_{N,total} = 2$.\n-   The individual has a germline heterozygous variant, so normal cells have $1$ variant and $1$ wild-type allele. Thus, $n_{V,N} = 1$.\n\nWe must find the pair of values for the number of variant alleles ($n_{V,T}$) and total alleles ($n_{T,total}$) in the tumor cells that satisfies the VAF equation and is consistent with the copy number and B-allele frequency data.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n$$ 0.80 = \\frac{(0.60 \\times n_{V,T}) + ((1-0.60) \\times 1)}{(0.60 \\times n_{T,total}) + ((1-0.60) \\times 2)} $$\n$$ 0.80 = \\frac{0.6 \\cdot n_{V,T} + 0.4}{0.6 \\cdot n_{T,total} + 0.8} $$\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n#### A. Copy-neutral LOH (uniparental disomy) at chromosome $17p$, yielding $2$ total copies and $2$ copies of the TP53 variant allele in tumor cells, consistent with log-ratio $\\approx 0$ and BAF near $0$ and $1$.\n\n-   **Proposed state in tumor cells:** Loss of the wild-type allele and duplication of the mutant allele. This results in $n_{V,T} = 2$ and $n_{T,total} = 2$.\n-   **VAF Calculation:** Let's test these values in our equation.\n    $$ VAF_{calc} = \\frac{(0.60 \\times 2) + 0.40}{(0.60 \\times 2) + 0.80} = \\frac{1.20 + 0.40}{1.20 + 0.80} = \\frac{1.60}{2.00} = 0.80 $$\n    The calculated VAF of $80\\%$ perfectly matches the observed VAF.\n-   **Consistency with other data:**\n    -   A total copy number of $2$ ($n_{T,total} = 2$) is consistent with the stated log-ratio of $\\approx 0$.\n    -   This event, copy-neutral LOH, results in homozygosity for all alleles on the affected chromosomal segment. For heterozygous markers, this loss of the heterozygous state is precisely what causes BAF clusters to shift from the heterozygous position (at $0.5$) towards the homozygous positions ($0$ and $1$).\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This explanation is quantitatively and qualitatively consistent with all pieces of evidence.\n\n#### B. Hemizygous deletion of the wild-type TP53 allele at chromosome $17p$, yielding $1$ total copy and $1$ copy of the TP53 variant allele in tumor cells, consistent with a decreased log-ratio and BAF shift.\n\n-   **Proposed state in tumor cells:** The tumor cells have lost the wild-type allele, leaving only the mutant allele. This results in $n_{V,T} = 1$ and $n_{T,total} = 1$.\n-   **VAF Calculation:**\n    $$ VAF_{calc} = \\frac{(0.60 \\times 1) + 0.40}{(0.60 \\times 1) + 0.80} = \\frac{0.60 + 0.40}{0.60 + 0.80} = \\frac{1.00}{1.40} \\approx 0.714 $$\n    A VAF of $\\approx 71.4\\%$ is not a good fit for the observed $80\\%$.\n-   **Consistency with other data:** A total copy number of $1$ ($n_{T,total} = 1$) in the tumor would result in an average copy number of $(0.60 \\times 1) + (0.40 \\times 2) = 1.4$ for the bulk sample. The log-ratio would be $\\log_2(1/2) = -1$ for the pure tumor component, and $\\log_2(1.4/2) = \\log_2(0.7) \\approx -0.51$ for the bulk sample. This is a significant decrease, contradicting the observation of a log-ratio $\\approx 0$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This explanation is inconsistent with both the VAF and the copy number data.\n\n#### C. Retained heterozygosity at chromosome $17p$ with $2$ total copies in tumor cells, one TP53 variant allele and one wild-type allele, independent of purity.\n\n-   **Proposed state in tumor cells:** The tumor cells have the same allelic state as the normal cells. This means $n_{V,T} = 1$ and $n_{T,total} = 2$. This scenario would imply no \"second hit\" at the *TP53* locus.\n-   **VAF Calculation:**\n    $$ VAF_{calc} = \\frac{(0.60 \\times 1) + 0.40}{(0.60 \\times 2) + 0.80} = \\frac{0.60 + 0.40}{1.20 + 0.80} = \\frac{1.00}{2.00} = 0.50 $$\n    A VAF of $50\\%$ is far from the observed $80\\%$.\n-   **Consistency with other data:** Retained heterozygosity in the tumor would mean that the BAF of the bulk sample would remain centered around $0.5$ for heterozygous markers. This directly contradicts the finding of BAF clusters near $0$ and $1$, which indicates LOH. The claim that this is \"independent of purity\" is also false; the VAF calculation changes with purity.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This explanation is inconsistent with both the VAF and the BAF data.\n\n#### D. High-level amplification of the TP53 variant allele at chromosome $17p$ to $3$ copies in tumor cells (total CN $3$), consistent with an increased log-ratio at $17p$ and VAF substantially greater than $80\\%$ at $60\\%$ purity.\n\n-   **Proposed state in tumor cells:** This scenario implies the wild-type allele is lost and the variant allele is amplified. Let's assume $n_{V,T} = 3$ and $n_{T,total} = 3$.\n-   **VAF Calculation:**\n    $$ VAF_{calc} = \\frac{(0.60 \\times 3) + 0.40}{(0.60 \\times 3) + 0.80} = \\frac{1.80 + 0.40}{1.80 + 0.80} = \\frac{2.20}{2.60} \\approx 0.846 $$\n    A VAF of $\\approx 84.6\\%$ is close, but not as precise as Option A. The option itself claims the VAF would be \"substantially greater than $80\\%$\", which is an ambiguous but arguable description of $84.6\\%$.\n-   **Consistency with other data:** The primary contradiction lies with the copy number. A total copy number of $3$ ($n_{T,total} = 3$) in the tumor would give a log-ratio of $\\log_2(3/2) \\approx +0.58$ for the pure tumor component. This is a significant increase, contradicting the central finding that the log-ratio is $\\approx 0$ (total CN near $2$).\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This explanation is unequivocally contradicted by the copy number evidence provided in the problem statement.",
