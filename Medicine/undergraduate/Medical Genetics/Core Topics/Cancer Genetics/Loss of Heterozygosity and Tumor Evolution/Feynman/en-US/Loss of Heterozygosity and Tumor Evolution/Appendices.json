This exercise  challenges you to apply the classic two-hit hypothesis to the retinoblastoma gene (*RB1*), a cornerstone of cancer biology. By evaluating different scenarios, you will learn to distinguish between the various molecular pathways—such as deletion, mitotic recombination, and uniparental disomy—that can lead to loss of heterozygosity and biallelic inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene.",

            "problem": "A tumor suppressor gene requires biallelic inactivation in a diploid cell to abolish its function, consistent with the two-hit model proposed for recessive tumor suppressor genes. In diploid ($2n$) human somatic cells, each autosomal locus exists in $2$ copies (alleles). The retinoblastoma protein gene (*RB1*) is a classic tumor suppressor. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a common route by which the second allele is inactivated and is defined as a transition from a heterozygous state at a locus (and linked polymorphic markers) to either a homozygous or hemizygous state as a consequence of mechanisms such as deletion, mitotic recombination, gene conversion, or uniparental disomy (UPD). Zygosity categories at the locus can be represented using allele notation: $RB1^{+/+}$ (homozygous wild-type), $RB1^{+/m}$ (heterozygous with one wild-type allele $+$ and one mutant loss-of-function allele $m$), $RB1^{m/m}$ (homozygous mutant), and $RB1^{m/0}$ or $RB1^{+/0}$ (hemizygous states where $0$ denotes physical absence of the allele due to deletion). Note that epigenetic silencing, such as promoter hypermethylation, inactivates transcription but does not alter the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence and therefore does not change sequence-based zygosity.\n\nSelect all options in which (i) both *RB1* alleles are inactivated in the tumor cell by a molecularly plausible sequence of $2$ hits, and (ii) the stated final zygosity category at the *RB1* locus is correctly predicted.\n\nA. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: interstitial deletion of the segment containing the wild-type allele. Predicted final zygosity: hemizygous mutant, $RB1^{m/0}$, with loss of heterozygosity.\n\nB. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: mitotic recombination between the centromere and the *RB1* locus yields two copies derived from the mutant homolog (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity). Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.\n\nC. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: hypermethylation of the promoter of the wild-type allele. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.\n\nD. Germline $RB1^{+/+}$. First hit: somatic point mutation creates $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: mitotic nondisjunction loses the mutant chromosome and duplicates the wild-type homolog (UPD for wild-type). Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{+/+}$.\n\nE. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: gene conversion replaces the wild-type allele sequence with the mutant sequence without altering copy number. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.\n\nF. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: interstitial deletion removing the mutant allele. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{+/0}$.\n\nG. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: uniparental disomy via loss of the wild-type chromosome and duplication of the mutant homolog. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of several scenarios describing the inactivation of the *RB1* tumor suppressor gene, based on the Knudson two-hit model. A scenario is considered correct only if it fulfills two conditions: (i) the described sequence of events leads to the inactivation of both alleles of the *RB1* gene in a diploid cell, and (ii) the predicted final zygosity at the *RB1* locus is a correct consequence of the described molecular event.\n\nThe problem statement defines the relevant terms. Allelic inactivation means loss of function. For a recessive tumor suppressor gene like *RB1*, tumorigenesis requires biallelic inactivation, meaning no functional wild-type ($+$) alleles remain. The initial state for most scenarios is germline heterozygosity, $RB1^{+/m}$, which constitutes the first hit. The second hit must inactivate the remaining wild-type allele. The problem also strictly defines zygosity based on the DNA sequence, distinguishing it from functional inactivation by epigenetic mechanisms like methylation.\n\nLet us analyze each option against criteria (i) and (ii).\n\n**A. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: interstitial deletion of the segment containing the wild-type allele. Predicted final zygosity: hemizygous mutant, $RB1^{m/0}$, with loss of heterozygosity.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The starting cell is $RB1^{+/m}$, possessing one functional wild-type ($+$) allele and one non-functional mutant ($m$) allele. This germline mutation is the first hit. The second hit is an interstitial deletion of the wild-type allele. After this event, the cell no longer contains a wild-type allele, only the mutant allele remains. Therefore, the function of both *RB1* alleles is lost. This condition is met.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: Starting from $RB1^{+/m}$, the physical removal (deletion) of the wild-type allele results in a hemizygous state, where only the mutant allele is present. This is correctly denoted as $RB1^{m/0}$, where '0' signifies the deletion. The transition from a heterozygous ($+/m$) to a hemizygous ($m/0$) state is a form of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The predicted final zygosity is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: mitotic recombination between the centromere and the *RB1* locus yields two copies derived from the mutant homolog (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity). Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The initial state is $RB1^{+/m}$ (first hit). The second hit is a specific outcome of mitotic recombination that results in the cell becoming homozygous for the mutant allele. The final state, $RB1^{m/m}$, contains two non-functional mutant alleles and zero functional wild-type alleles. Therefore, biallelic inactivation is achieved.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: Mitotic recombination between non-sister chromatids, if it occurs between the centromere and the gene locus, followed by a specific segregation pattern at anaphase, can indeed produce a daughter cell that is homozygous for all loci distal to the point of crossover. If the cell becomes homozygous for the chromosome arm carrying the mutant ($m$) allele, its genotype at the *RB1* locus will be $RB1^{m/m}$. This process is a known mechanism of LOH and is copy-neutral because the cell retains two homologous chromosomes. The predicted zygosity is a plausible and correctly described outcome of the event.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: hypermethylation of the promoter of the wild-type allele. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The initial state is $RB1^{+/m}$ (first hit). The second hit, hypermethylation of the promoter of the wild-type ($+$) allele, is an epigenetic modification that silences gene transcription. This effectively inactivates the function of the remaining wild-type allele. Functionally, biallelic inactivation is achieved. This is a common \"second hit\" mechanism in cancer.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: The problem explicitly states that zygosity is \"sequence-based\" and that epigenetic silencing \"does not alter the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence and therefore does not change sequence-based zygosity\". Hypermethylation does not change the DNA sequence of the $+$ allele to an $m$ allele. Therefore, the sequence-based zygosity of the cell remains $RB1^{+/m}$. The option incorrectly predicts the final zygosity as $RB1^{m/m}$. An $RB1^{m/m}$ state requires both alleles to have the mutant sequence.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Germline $RB1^{+/+}$. First hit: somatic point mutation creates $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: mitotic nondisjunction loses the mutant chromosome and duplicates the wild-type homolog (UPD for wild-type). Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{+/+}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The sequence of events is $RB1^{+/+} \\rightarrow RB1^{+/m} \\rightarrow RB1^{+/+}$. The first hit creates a heterozygous cell. The second hit, however, reverses this by eliminating the mutant allele and duplicating the wild-type allele. The final state is homozygous wild-type, $RB1^{+/+}$, which has two fully functional alleles. This is the opposite of biallelic inactivation and would be a growth-disadvantageous or neutral event in the context of tumorigenesis driven by *RB1* loss. This condition is not met.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: The described event, loss of the mutant chromosome and duplication of the wild-type homolog from a starting $RB1^{+/m}$ state, does correctly lead to a final state of $RB1^{+/+}$. However, since criterion (i) fails, the option is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: gene conversion replaces the wild-type allele sequence with the mutant sequence without altering copy number. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The initial state is $RB1^{+/m}$ (first hit). The second hit is gene conversion, where the sequence of the mutant ($m$) allele is used as a template to replace the sequence of the wild-type ($+$) allele. The result is a cell with two $m$ alleles. Since both alleles are now non-functional, biallelic inactivation is achieved.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: The described event transforms the $RB1^{+/m}$ state into a state where both alleles have the mutant sequence. This is correctly represented as $RB1^{m/m}$. Gene conversion is a known mechanism for copy-neutral LOH. The predicted final zygosity is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**F. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: interstitial deletion removing the mutant allele. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{+/0}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The initial state is $RB1^{+/m}$ (first hit). The second hit is a deletion of the mutant ($m$) allele. The resulting cell is left with only the functional wild-type ($+$) allele. The cell is not biallelically inactivated; on the contrary, it has lost its only non-functional allele, leaving it with a single, perfectly functional copy. This condition is not met.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: Starting from $RB1^{+/m}$ and deleting the mutant allele would correctly result in a hemizygous wild-type state, $RB1^{+/0}$. The prediction is accurate for the described event, but the event itself does not satisfy criterion (i).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**G. Germline $RB1^{+/m}$. Second hit: uniparental disomy via loss of the wild-type chromosome and duplication of the mutant homolog. Predicted final zygosity: $RB1^{m/m}$.**\n- (i) Biallelic Inactivation: The initial state is $RB1^{+/m}$ (first hit). The second hit is a specific form of uniparental disomy (UPD), a large-scale event typically involving mitotic nondisjunction. The chromosome carrying the wild-type ($+$) allele is lost, and the remaining chromosome carrying the mutant ($m$) allele is duplicated. The resulting cell contains two copies of the mutant allele. Thus, biallelic inactivation is achieved.\n- (ii) Correct Final Zygosity: This process, starting from a $RB1^{+/m}$ state, will result in a cell that is homozygous for the entire mutant chromosome (or at least the part containing the *RB1* gene). The zygosity at the *RB1* locus is therefore correctly predicted as $RB1^{m/m}$. This is a classic mechanism for LOH.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, options A, B, E, and G describe molecularly plausible sequences of two hits that result in biallelic inactivation of the *RB1* gene and correctly predict the resulting sequence-based zygosity.",
