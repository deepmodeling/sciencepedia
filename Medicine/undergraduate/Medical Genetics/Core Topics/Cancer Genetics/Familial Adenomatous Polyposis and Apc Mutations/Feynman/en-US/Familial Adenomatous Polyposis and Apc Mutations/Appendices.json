This exercise provides a practical method for translating genetic information—a mutation at a specific codon—into a predictable physical property: the protein's molecular weight. By performing this calculation, you will see how a specific genotype leads to a measurable change that can be detected using common laboratory techniques like Western blotting. ",

            "problem": "Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is commonly caused by truncating mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene that introduce premature termination codons, leading to shortened APC proteins. Consider a patient with a germline *APC* nonsense mutation reported at codon $1309$, a hotspot in FAP. The full-length APC protein is annotated as having $2843$ amino acids. Use the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein) and the well-established approximation that, in denaturing conditions such as Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), polypeptide migration correlates with the number of amino acids and thus with the molecular mass. Assume an average mass per amino acid of $110$ daltons. For the purpose of this calculation, define “stop at codon $1309$” to mean the truncated protein contains residues $1$ through $1308$.\n\nCompute the predicted change in molecular weight, in kilodaltons (kDa), between the full-length APC protein and the truncated protein that ends at residue $1308$. State the decrease as a single positive number corresponding to $M_{\\text{full}} - M_{\\text{trunc}}$, where $M_{\\text{full}}$ is the mass of full-length APC and $M_{\\text{trunc}}$ is the mass of the truncated variant. Round your final numeric answer to four significant figures and express it in kilodaltons (kDa). Briefly explain, in words, how this mass change would be expected to affect Western blot band positions and detection sensitivity when using an antibody that recognizes an amino-terminal epitope.\n\nProvide only the single numeric value for the mass decrease as the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular biology and genetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is formulated with objective, precise language.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the change in molecular weight between a full-length and a truncated protein, and an explanation of the consequences for a Western blot analysis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the predicted change in molecular weight. The following data are provided:\n-   The number of amino acids in the full-length APC protein, $N_{\\text{full}} = 2843$.\n-   A nonsense mutation at codon $1309$ results in a truncated protein containing amino acid residues $1$ through $1308$. Thus, the number of amino acids in the truncated protein is $N_{\\text{trunc}} = 1308$.\n-   The average mass of an amino acid is given as $m_{\\text{aa}} = 110 \\text{ Da}$.\n\nThe molecular mass of the full-length protein, $M_{\\text{full}}$, can be approximated as:\n$$M_{\\text{full}} = N_{\\text{full}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 2843 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 312730 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nThe molecular mass of the truncated protein, $M_{\\text{trunc}}$, can be approximated as:\n$$M_{\\text{trunc}} = N_{\\text{trunc}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 1308 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 143880 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the decrease in molecular weight, $\\Delta M$, which is the difference between the mass of the full-length protein and the mass of the truncated protein.\n$$\\Delta M = M_{\\text{full}} - M_{\\text{trunc}}$$\nAlternatively, this can be calculated from the number of amino acids that are lost due to the truncation. The number of lost C-terminal amino acids is:\n$$N_{\\text{lost}} = N_{\\text{full}} - N_{\\text{trunc}} = 2843 - 1308 = 1535 \\text{ amino acids}$$\nThe corresponding mass decrease is:\n$$\\Delta M = N_{\\text{lost}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 1535 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 168850 \\text{ Da}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilodaltons (kDa). We use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ kDa} = 1000 \\text{ Da}$:\n$$\\Delta M = \\frac{168850 \\text{ Da}}{1000 \\text{ Da/kDa}} = 168.85 \\text{ kDa}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta M \\approx 168.9 \\text{ kDa}$$\n\nSecond, we explain the expected effects on a Western blot.\nIn a Western blot, proteins are first separated by SDS-PAGE, primarily based on their molecular mass. The truncated APC protein, being significantly smaller ($M_{\\text{trunc}} \\approx 143.9 \\text{ kDa}$) than the full-length protein ($M_{\\text{full}} \\approx 312.7 \\text{ kDa}$), will migrate faster through the polyacrylamide gel. Consequently, the band corresponding to the truncated protein will appear lower on the blot (i.e., will have migrated further from the loading well) than the band for the full-length protein.\n\nThe question specifies that the antibody used for detection recognizes an amino-terminal epitope. The truncated protein consists of residues $1$ through $1308$ and therefore retains the amino-terminus of the original protein. This means the antibody's epitope is present in both the full-length and the truncated protein variants. As a result, the antibody is expected to detect both forms. Regarding detection sensitivity, while the antibody's intrinsic ability to bind the epitope is unchanged, the observed signal strength on the blot depends on the abundance of the target protein. In many biological systems, mRNAs containing premature termination codons are degraded by a process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and the resulting truncated proteins are often unstable and rapidly cleared by cellular degradation machinery. This would lead to a lower steady-state concentration of the truncated protein compared to the full-length protein expressed from the wild-type allele. Therefore, on a Western blot of proteins from a heterozygous FAP patient, one would anticipate observing a band for the full-length protein and a second, typically much fainter, band at a lower molecular weight corresponding to the truncated protein.\n\nThe final answer, however, is restricted to the numerical value of the mass decrease.",

            "problem": "A patient with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) carries a germline loss-of-function mutation in one allele of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene. In a single colonic crypt, initiation of the first adenoma is modeled as occurring when the remaining wild-type *APC* allele in a stem cell is inactivated by any somatic point mutation within an effective target of size $L$ base positions that, if mutated, produce loss of function. Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- The Central Dogma of molecular biology and the tumor suppressor framework imply that biallelic inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene is required for tumor initiation; given a germline hit, only $1$ additional somatic hit is needed in a crypt’s stem cell to initiate an adenoma.\n- Somatic point mutations at each base position occur as rare, independent events over time, with a constant instantaneous rate $\\mu$ per base per unit time, and the probability of more than $1$ event in an infinitesimal interval is negligible.\n- The superposition of independent rare-event processes across $L$ functionally equivalent target positions can be treated as a single rare-event process for adenoma initiation in that crypt.\n\nLet $T$ be the waiting time (in arbitrary time units consistent with $\\mu$) from birth until the first adenoma arises in that crypt due to inactivation of the remaining *APC* allele by any of the $L$ targetable somatic mutations.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient has Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) with a germline loss-of-function mutation in one allele of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (*APC*) gene.\n- Initiation of the first adenoma occurs when the remaining wild-type *APC* allele in a stem cell is inactivated.\n- Inactivation is caused by a somatic point mutation within an effective target of size $L$ base positions.\n- The Central Dogma and tumor suppressor framework imply biallelic inactivation is required; one somatic hit is needed after the germline hit.\n- Somatic point mutations at each base position occur as rare, independent events with a constant instantaneous rate $\\mu$ per base per unit time.

FAP and the role of the *APC* gene are a classic and well-established example. The modeling of mutations as a stochastic Poisson process is a standard and scientifically sound approach in molecular evolution and cancer modeling.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($L$, $\\mu$) and a clear objective (derive $\\mathbb{E}[T]$). The relationship between the individual mutation events and the overall adenoma initiation event is explicitly defined, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and formal scientific language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The assumptions provided are standard for modeling such a process. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected waiting time, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$, for the first somatic mutation that inactivates the remaining functional allele of the *APC* gene in a colonic crypt stem cell.\n\nThe adenoma initiation event is defined as the first somatic point mutation to occur at any one of the $L$ specified base positions within the wild-type *APC* allele.\nThe rate of mutation at a single base position is given as a constant, $\\mu$.\nWe are given that mutations at each of the $L$ sites are independent rare events. The problem states that the superposition of these independent processes can be treated as a single rare-event process. For independent Poisson processes, the rate of the combined process is the sum of the rates of the individual processes.\nLet $\\lambda$ be the total rate of an inactivating mutation occurring in the stem cell.\nSince there are $L$ independent target positions, each contributing a rate of $\\mu$ to the total process, the combined rate $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\mu = L \\mu $$\nThis rate $\\lambda$ has units of events per unit time. The occurrence of one such event corresponds to the inactivation of the second *APC* allele and thus the initiation of an adenoma. The problem of finding the waiting time $T$ for this event is equivalent to finding the waiting time for the first event in a Poisson process with constant rate $\\lambda$.\n\nWe will use the principles of survival analysis to find the distribution of $T$ and then its expectation. Let $S(t)$ be the survival function, defined as the probability that the waiting time $T$ is greater than some time $t$.\n$$ S(t) = P(T > t) $$\nThis is the probability that no inactivating mutation has occurred by time $t$. We derive an expression for $S(t)$ using the small-interval characterization. Consider a small time interval $\\Delta t$. The probability that the event has not occurred by time $t + \\Delta t$ can be expressed as the probability that it has not occurred by time $t$ AND it does not occur in the interval $(t, t + \\Delta t]$.\n$$ S(t + \\Delta t) = P(T > t + \\Delta t) = P(T > t \\cap T \\notin (t, t + \\Delta t]) $$\nBecause the underlying Poisson process is memoryless, the event of a mutation in $(t, t + \\Delta t]$ is independent of the events (or lack thereof) up to time $t$.\n$$ S(t + \\Delta t) = P(T > t) \\cdot P(\\text{no mutation in } (t, t + \\Delta t]) $$\nThe probability of one mutation occurring in the small interval $\\Delta t$ is $\\lambda \\Delta t$, as per the definition of a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. The probability of more than one mutation is negligible (of order $o(\\Delta t)$). Therefore, the probability of zero mutations in $\\Delta t$ is $1 - \\lambda \\Delta t$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $S(t + \\Delta t)$:\n$$ S(t + \\Delta t) = S(t) (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t) $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{S(t + \\Delta t) - S(t)}{\\Delta t} = - \\lambda S(t) $$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we get the definition of the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = - \\lambda S(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the survival function $S(t)$. We can solve it by separation of variables or by noting its standard form. The general solution is:\n$$ S(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We use the initial condition that at time $t=0$ (birth), no somatic mutation has yet occurred, so the probability of survival beyond time $0$ must be $1$.\n$$ S(0) = P(T > 0) = 1 $$\nSubstituting this into the general solution:\n$$ 1 = C \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) = C \\cdot 1 \\implies C = 1 $$\nThus, the survival function is:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThis is the survival function of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$. The waiting time $T$ is therefore exponentially distributed.\n\nThe expected value of a non-negative continuous random variable $T$ can be calculated by integrating its survival function from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_0^\\infty S(t) \\, dt $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S(t)$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt $$\nWe evaluate this definite integral:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]_0^\\infty = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda t) - \\exp(0) \\right) $$\nSince $\\lambda = L\\mu > 0$, the limit term $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ evaluates to $0$. The term $\\exp(0)$ is $1$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} (0 - 1) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} $$\nThis is the well-known result for the mean of an exponential distribution. Finally, we substitute back the expression for the total rate $\\lambda = L\\mu$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{L\\mu} $$\nThis expression represents the expected waiting time until the second \"hit\" inactivates the *APC* gene, thereby initiating an adenoma in the colonic crypt.",

In this clinic population, the pre-test probability that an evaluated proband truly carries a pathogenic *APC* variant is $\\pi = 0.30$.

All necessary data are provided for a unique solution using established principles of probability theory.\n\nThe task is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) for a genetic test, given the pre-test probability of the condition, and the test's sensitivity and specificity. The PPV is the posterior probability that a patient truly has the condition, given a positive test result. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n$D$: The event that a patient from the high-risk clinic truly carries a pathogenic Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (*APC*) variant.\n$D^c$: The event that a patient does not carry a pathogenic *APC* variant.\n$T^+$: The event that the test result is positive for a pathogenic variant.\n$T^-$: The event that the test result is negative (no pathogenic variant detected).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pre-test probability, or prior probability, of carrying a pathogenic *APC* variant is given as $\\pi$.\n$$P(D) = \\pi = 0.30$$\nThe probability of not carrying a pathogenic *APC* variant is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\nThe clinical sensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the pathogenic variant.\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95$$\nThe clinical specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the pathogenic variant.\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.99$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient has the pathogenic variant given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states (having the variant or not having the variant):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe have $P(T^+ | D)$ and $P(D)$. We need to find $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a patient without the variant can either test positive or negative, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\nNow we can substitute the known values to calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95)(0.30) + (0.01)(0.70)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.285 + 0.007 = 0.292$$\nFinally, we can substitute all components back into the Bayes' theorem formula to find the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.30)}{0.292}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.285}{0.292} \\approx 0.976027397...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$PPV \\approx 0.9760$$\n\nThe primary assumption made is that the provided values for prior probability, sensitivity, and specificity are accurate for any randomly selected individual within this specific high-risk clinic population. The problem's simplification of the test outcome to a binary result (pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic), explicitly excluding variants of uncertain significance, is a necessary condition for this calculation.\n\nFor the interpretation, the calculation shows that while a patient in this high-risk clinic has a pre-test probability of $30\\%$ of carrying a pathogenic APC variant, a positive test result dramatically increases this probability to approximately $97.6\\%$. For pre-test counseling, this means explaining the initial substantial risk. For post-test counseling following a positive result, this implies that the result is highly likely to be a true positive. This high degree of certainty is critical for making significant medical decisions, such as a recommendation for prophylactic colectomy and initiating cascade testing for at-risk family members. The residual $2.4\\%$ chance of a false positive, while small, should also be communicated for informed consent. The test is exceptionally useful for risk stratification in this clinical setting.",
