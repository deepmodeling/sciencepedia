            "problem": "In medical genetics, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) employ short, single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to complementary genomic loci.

This model is a cornerstone of molecular biology and bioinformatics for designing primers and probes. The values used are standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters ($G$, probability model, target probability) are provided. The objective is to find a minimal integer $L$ satisfying a clear inequality. A unique solution is expected.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and precise, with no subjective content.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is free from the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., it is not contradictory, infeasible, or trivial). The explicit mention of a \"rare-event approximation\" and the approximation $G - L + 1 \\approx G$ are standard and valid in this context, making the problem well-structured for a solution.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\nThe problem requires finding the minimal integer probe length, $L$, such that the probability of observing at least one unintended perfect match in the genome is at most $10^{-6}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable for the number of unintended perfect matches. The total length of the haploid genome is $G = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs. A probe of length $L$ can potentially start at any of the first $G-L+1$ positions. Since one of these positions is the intended target, the number of unintended loci to consider is $n = (G-L+1) - 1 = G-L$. Given that $G \\gg L$, we can approximate this number as $n \\approx G$. The problem statement assumes approximately $G$ independent trials. To be slightly more precise, let's consider the number of unintended sites to be $n=G-1$, which is also excellently approximated by $G$.\n\nAt each unintended locus, the probability of a perfect match, $p$, is given by the probability of matching each of the $L$ bases independently. With four equally likely bases, this probability is:\n$$ p = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{L} = 4^{-L} $$\n\nThe number of unintended matches, $N$, follows a binomial distribution, $N \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, where $n \\approx G$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the success probability per trial. Since $n$ is very large (on the order of $10^9$) and $p$ is very small, we can use the Poisson approximation, as suggested by the problem's reference to \"rare-event approximations.\" The distribution of $N$ is well-approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = np$.\n$$ \\lambda = n \\cdot p \\approx G \\cdot p = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot 4^{-L} $$\n\nThe problem specifies the constraint on the probability of at least one unintended match:\n$$ P(N \\geq 1) \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nFor a Poisson-distributed variable, the probability of observing at least one event is $P(N \\geq 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$. The probability of zero events is $P(N=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$ 1 - e^{-\\lambda} \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nFor a very small upper bound on probability, such as $10^{-6}$, the expression $1 - e^{-\\lambda}$ can be approximated by $\\lambda$. This comes from the Taylor expansion $e^{-\\lambda} \\approx 1 - \\lambda$ for small $\\lambda$, which makes $1 - e^{-\\lambda} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\lambda) = \\lambda$. Thus, the condition simplifies to a constraint on the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of $L$:\n$$ (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot 4^{-L} \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nWe can now solve this inequality for $L$. First, we isolate the term containing $L$:\n$$ 4^{-L} \\leq \\frac{10^{-6}}{3.2 \\times 10^{9}} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ 4^{L} \\geq \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{9}}{10^{-6}} $$\n$$ 4^{L} \\geq 3.2 \\times 10^{15} $$\n\nTo solve for $L$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(4^{L}) \\geq \\ln(3.2 \\times 10^{15}) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$ L \\ln(4) \\geq \\ln(3.2) + \\ln(10^{15}) $$\n$$ L \\cdot (2 \\ln(2)) \\geq \\ln(3.2) + 15 \\ln(10) $$\nIsolating $L$ gives:\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{\\ln(3.2) + 15 \\ln(10)}{2 \\ln(2)} $$\n\nBy substituting the numerical values of the logarithms ($\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$, $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30259$, $\\ln(3.2) \\approx 1.16315$):\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{1.16315 + 15(2.30259)}{2(0.69315)} $$\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{1.16315 + 34.53885}{1.3863} $$\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{35.702}{1.3863} $$\n$$ L \\geq 25.7529... $$\n\nSince the probe length $L$ must be an integer, we must choose the smallest integer that satisfies this condition.

Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) is not applicable here because it requires metaphase spreads, whereas the laboratory will screen interphase nuclei in suspension. To characterize the detection performance, the laboratory models the assay using the following mechanistic assumptions grounded in standard probe physics:\n\n- Each target locus on a chromosome is detected as a discrete fluorescent spot if and only if two independent events both occur: successful probe hybridization and signal retention within the optical section. Let the probability of successful hybridization per locus be $h$ and the probability of signal retention per locus be $r$, with independence between these two events. Hence, the per-locus visibility probability is $v = h \\times r$.\n- In a trisomic nucleus (abnormal), exactly $3$ target loci exist for the enumerated probe; in a disomic nucleus (normal), exactly $2$ target loci exist. Across loci within a nucleus, visibility events are independent and identically distributed with probability $v$.\n- A nucleus is scored as “abnormal” if exactly $3$ true probe signals are observed. Assume perfect specificity for this scoring rule, that is, a normal nucleus is never mislabeled as abnormal under this rule.\n- Nuclei in the sample are independent and identically distributed.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluorescence microscopy and molecular cytogenetics, well-posed with all necessary parameters defined, and objective in its language. The assumptions, such as perfect specificity for the given scoring rule and independence of probabilistic events, are explicitly stated and internally consistent, forming a solvable model. The problem will be solved as follows.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1) Derivation of the per-abnormal-nucleus true positive probability, $s_{\\text{nuc}}$.\n\nAn abnormal, or trisomic, nucleus contains exactly $3$ target loci for the probe. A single target locus becomes a visible fluorescent spot if two independent events occur: successful probe hybridization (with probability $h$) and signal retention within the optical section (with probability $r$). The probability of a single locus being visible, $v$, is the product of these independent probabilities:\n$$v = h \\times r$$\nThe visibility events for the $3$ loci within a single nucleus are independent and identically distributed, each with probability $v$. This scenario is modeled by a Binomial distribution. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of visible signals in a single trisomic nucleus. Then $X$ follows a Binomial distribution with number of trials $n_{\\text{loci}} = 3$ and probability of success $v$.\n$$X \\sim B(n_{\\text{loci}}, v) \\quad \\text{where } n_{\\text{loci}}=3$$\nThe probability mass function for $X$ is given by $P(X=k) = \\binom{3}{k} v^k (1-v)^{3-k}$.\n\nA nucleus is scored as \"abnormal\" if and only if exactly $3$ signals are observed. Therefore, the true positive probability for a single abnormal nucleus, $s_{\\text{nuc}}$, is the probability that $X=3$.\n$$s_{\\text{nuc}} = P(X=3) = \\binom{3}{3} v^3 (1-v)^{3-3} = 1 \\cdot v^3 \\cdot 1 = v^3$$\nSubstituting $v = h \\times r$, we have:\n$$s_{\\text{nuc}} = (h \\times r)^3$$\nUsing the given values $h = 0.97$ and $r = 0.92$:\n$$v = 0.97 \\times 0.92 = 0.8924$$\n$$s_{\\text{nuc}} = (0.8924)^3 \\approx 0.71055053$$\n\n2) Derivation of the sample-level detection probability, $S(n)$.\n\nWe are now considering a sample of $n$ nuclei drawn from a population with a mosaic fraction $p = 0.05$ of abnormal (trisomic) nuclei. The event of interest is detecting \"at least $1$ true-positive nucleus\". A \"true-positive nucleus\" is an abnormal nucleus that is correctly scored as abnormal.\n\nLet's define the probability, $p_{\\text{TP}}$, that a single, randomly selected nucleus from the sample is a true-positive. This requires two independent events to occur: the nucleus must be truly abnormal (which occurs with probability $p$), and it must be correctly scored as abnormal (which, for an abnormal nucleus, occurs with probability $s_{\\text{nuc}}$).\n$$p_{\\text{TP}} = p \\times s_{\\text{nuc}}$$\nThe problem states that a normal nucleus is never mislabeled as abnormal, confirming that the false positive rate is $0$ and we only need to consider true positives.\n\nWe are scoring a panel of $n$ independent nuclei. Let $Y$ be the random variable for the number of true-positive nuclei found in the panel of $n$. Each nucleus constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $p_{\\text{TP}}$. Therefore, $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution $Y \\sim B(n, p_{\\text{TP}})$.\n\nThe sample-level detection probability, $S(n)$, is the probability of observing at least one true-positive nucleus, i.e., $P(Y \\geq 1)$. It is more convenient to calculate this using the complement event, $P(Y=0)$.\n$$S(n) = P(Y \\geq 1) = 1 - P(Y=0)$$\nUsing the Binomial probability mass function for $Y$:\n$$P(Y=0) = \\binom{n}{0} (p_{\\text{TP}})^0 (1 - p_{\\text{TP}})^{n-0} = (1 - p_{\\text{TP}})^n$$\nTherefore, the sample-level detection probability is:\n$$S(n) = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{TP}})^n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{\\text{TP}}$ and $s_{\\text{nuc}}$ gives the general formula:\n$$S(n) = 1 - (1 - p \\cdot (h \\cdot r)^3)^n$$\n\n3) Determination of the minimum integer $n$.\n\nWe need to find the minimum integer $n$ such that the sample-level detection probability is at least $0.95$.\n$$S(n) \\geq 0.95$$\n$$1 - (1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}})^n \\geq 0.95$$\nRearranging the inequality:\n$$(1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}})^n \\leq 1 - 0.95$$\n$$(1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}})^n \\leq 0.05$$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$n \\ln(1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}}) \\leq \\ln(0.05)$$\nThe term $(1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}})$ is less than $1$, so its natural logarithm is negative. Dividing by this negative number will reverse the direction of the inequality.\n$$n \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(1 - p \\cdot s_{\\text{nuc}})}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. The probability of a single random nucleus being a true-positive is:\n$$p_{\\text{TP}} = p \\times s_{\\text{nuc}} = 0.05 \\times (0.8924)^3 \\approx 0.05 \\times 0.71055053 \\approx 0.03552753$$\nNow we compute the value for $n$:\n$$n \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(1 - 0.03552753)}$$\n$$n \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.96447247)}$$\n$$n \\geq \\frac{-2.99573227}{-0.03617388}$$\n$$n \\geq 82.8138...$$\nSince the number of scored nuclei, $n$, must be an integer, we must find the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. This is achieved by taking the ceiling of the calculated value.\n$$n_{\\text{min}} = \\lceil 82.8138... \\rceil = 83$$\nTherefore, a minimum of $83$ nuclei must be scored to ensure a detection probability of at least $95\\%$.",

While this is a high probability, it also means there is a $20.00\\%$ chance the result is a false positive. This significant residual uncertainty makes it ethically and medically imperative to recommend a definitive, diagnostic confirmatory test, such as a full karyotype analysis from cultured amniocytes or chorionic villus sampling, before any irreversible clinical decisions (e.g., pregnancy termination) are considered.\nAn NPV of $0.9996$ is extremely high. It signifies that a negative FISH result is highly reassuring, with a $99.96\\%$ probability that the fetus is not affected by trisomy $21$. The post-test probability of having the disease despite the negative result is only $1 - 0.9996 = 0.0004$, or $1$ in $2500$. For most patients, this level of certainty is sufficient to rule out trisomy $21$, and no further invasive testing for this specific aneuploidy would be indicated.\nThe role of FISH is thus a rapid screening or preliminary test. Its main advantage is speed (results in $24-48$ hours), which reduces parental anxiety. However, it is targeted only to specific chromosomes. In contrast, spectral karyotyping (SKY), like conventional G-banded karyotyping, provides a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of all chromosomes but requires cell culture and has a longer turnaround time ($1-2$ weeks). SKY is superior for detecting complex chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., translocations, insertions, deletions) that are invisible to a targeted FISH panel. Therefore, the strategy is to use FISH for rapid risk assessment. A positive FISH result mandates confirmation with a full karyotype (or SKY for complex cases) to ensure diagnostic accuracy and to assess the entire chromosome complement for abnormalities that FISH would miss. SKY acts as the gold-standard diagnostic tool, whereas FISH functions as a highly effective triage instrument.",
