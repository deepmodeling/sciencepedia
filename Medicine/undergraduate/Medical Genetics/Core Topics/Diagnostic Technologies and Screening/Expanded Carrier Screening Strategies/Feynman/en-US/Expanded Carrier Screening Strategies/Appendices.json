This exercise guides you through deriving this relationship from first principles using the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) model. By completing this practice, you will solidify your understanding of how population-level data, which is what screening programs often collect, translates directly into public health metrics like disease incidence .",

            "problem": "A public health program implementing Expanded Carrier Screening (ECS) is evaluating an autosomal recessive disease in a large, randomly mating population with no consanguinity, no selection, and stable allele frequencies. Assume Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), where genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ (homozygous non-carrier), $2pq$ (heterozygous carrier), and $q^{2}$ (homozygous affected), with $p + q = 1$. In ECS, the carrier frequency refers to the proportion of unaffected heterozygous carriers, so $f$ denotes the heterozygote frequency.\n\nGiven a measured carrier frequency $f = 0.04$, derive from first principles the expected affected birth rate among live births in this population. In your derivation, explicitly show:\n- a formula for the couple risk (the probability a randomly paired couple are both heterozygous carriers) in terms of $f$,\n- a formula for the offspring risk (the probability a child is affected given both parents are heterozygous carriers) under autosomal recessive inheritance,\n\nand then combine these concepts with HWE to compute the exact expected affected birth rate as a function of $f$ and evaluate it for $f = 0.04$. Express the final affected birth rate as a decimal, rounded to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign anywhere in your answer.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed and scientifically grounded question in population genetics.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected affected birth rate of an autosomal recessive disease in a population assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The fundamental principles of HWE state that for a biallelic locus with allele frequencies $p$ and $q$, where $p+q=1$, the genotype frequencies in the population are $p^{2}$ for homozygous non-carriers, $2pq$ for heterozygous carriers, and $q^{2}$ for homozygous affected individuals.\n\nThe problem provides the carrier frequency, $f$, which is defined as the heterozygote frequency. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\nf = 2pq\n$$\nThe affected birth rate corresponds to the frequency of homozygous affected individuals in the population at birth, which is given by $q^{2}$. Our goal is to determine $q^{2}$ from the given value of $f$.\n\nThe problem specifies a derivation path that explicitly involves the concepts of \"couple risk\" and \"offspring risk\". Let us follow this path first.\n\n1.  **Couple Risk**: This is the probability that a randomly selected couple from the population both consist of heterozygous carriers. Assuming random mating, the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of an individual being a carrier is $f$. Thus, the probability that both partners in a couple are carriers is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Couple Risk} = f \\times f = f^2\n    $$\n\n2.  **Offspring Risk**: This is the conditional probability that a child is affected, given that both parents are heterozygous carriers. For an autosomal recessive trait, a mating between two heterozygotes ($Aa \\times Aa$) results in offspring with genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ in the Mendelian ratio of $1:2:1$. The probability of producing an affected ($aa$) offspring is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\text{Offspring Risk} = \\frac{1}{4}\n    $$\n\nCombining these two concepts, one might approximate the affected birth rate by multiplying the couple risk by the offspring risk. This calculates the proportion of births that are affected specifically from carrier-carrier unions:\n$$\n\\text{Affected Birth Rate (approx.)} = (\\text{Couple Risk}) \\times (\\text{Offspring Risk}) = f^2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{f^2}{4}\n$$\nThis calculation is a common and useful approximation in clinical genetics, as it correctly assumes that the vast majority of affected children are born to two carrier parents, especially when the disease is rare (i.e., $q$ is small). Matings involving an affected individual (who has genotype $aa$) are much rarer and contribute negligibly to the overall rate in such cases.\n\nHowever, the problem demands the **exact** expected affected birth rate. The exact rate under HWE is, by definition, $q^{2}$. To find this, we must establish the exact mathematical relationship between $q$ and $f$.\n\nWe start with the two fundamental HWE equations:\n1.  $p + q = 1 \\implies p = 1 - q$\n2.  $f = 2pq$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\nf = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^2\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation in terms of the variable $q$:\n$$\n2q^2 - 2q + f = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $q$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(2)(f)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8f}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}\n$$\nThis yields two possible solutions for $q$. For a recessive \"disease\", the affected allele ($q$) is typically the rarer of the two alleles, meaning its frequency must be less than $0.5$. The solution $q = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}$ would result in $q > 0.5$ (unless $f=0.5$, which makes $q=0.5$). The correct solution for a rare recessive allele is therefore the one with the negative sign:\n$$\nq = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}\n$$\nThe exact affected birth rate is $q^2$. Squaring the expression for $q$, we obtain the exact affected birth rate as a function of the carrier frequency $f$:\n$$\n\\text{Affected Birth Rate} = q^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the given measured carrier frequency, $f = 0.04$, into this exact formula.\n$$\nq^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2(0.04)}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nq^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 0.08}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{0.92}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.92} \\approx 0.9591663\n$$\n$$\nq^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.9591663}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.0408337}{2} \\right)^2 = (0.02041685)^2\n$$\n$$\nq^2 \\approx 0.0004168476\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.0004168$.\nFor comparison, the approximate formula $\\frac{f^2}{4}$ would have given $\\frac{(0.04)^2}{4} = \\frac{0.0016}{4} = 0.0004$, which is close but not the exact value.",

            "introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg model provides a baseline for risk estimation under the assumption of random mating, but real-world mating patterns can be more complex. Consanguinity, or mating between related individuals, significantly increases the risk for autosomal recessive conditions by increasing the chance that two partners share the same pathogenic allele from a common ancestor. This practice demonstrates how to quantitatively measure this increase in risk using the inbreeding coefficient $F$, providing a crucial tool for genetic counseling in families with a history of consanguinity .",

            "solution": "We begin from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium under random mating for a bi-allelic locus with pathogenic allele frequency $q$ and non-pathogenic allele frequency $p = 1 - q$. Under random mating, the genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ for the homozygous non-pathogenic genotype, $2 p q$ for the heterozygote, and $q^{2}$ for the homozygous pathogenic genotype. Therefore, the probability that an offspring is affected (homozygous for the pathogenic allele) under random mating is\n$$\nP_{\\text{random}}(\\text{affected}) = q^{2}.\n$$\n\nNext, we incorporate inbreeding using the definition of the inbreeding coefficient $F$ as the probability that the two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). By the law of total probability, we condition on whether the two alleles are IBD:\n- With probability $F$, the two alleles in the offspring are IBD. In this case, the probability that they are both the pathogenic allele is the population frequency of that allele, $q$, because a randomly chosen ancestral allele is pathogenic with probability $q$.\n- With probability $1 - F$, the two alleles are not IBD and are sampled independently from the gene pool.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in medical genetics involving Mendelian inheritance and Bayesian inference. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C_f$: The female partner is a carrier of the autosomal recessive allele.\n- $\\neg C_f$: The female partner is not a carrier.\n- $C_m$: The male partner is a carrier of the autosomal recessive allele.\n- $\\neg C_m$: The male partner is not a carrier.\n- $T_f^+$: The female partner's expanded carrier screening (ECS) result is positive.\n- $T_m^-$: The male partner's ECS result is negative.\n- $A$: The couple's next child will be affected by the condition.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following prior probabilities and test characteristics:\n- The pretest probability that the female is a carrier is $P(C_f) = p_f = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n- The pretest probability that the male is a carrier is $P(C_m) = p_m = \\frac{1}{40}$.\n- The analytic sensitivity of the female's test is the probability of a positive test given the person is a carrier: $P(T_f^+ | C_f) = s_f = 0.92$.\n- The analytic sensitivity of the male's test is $P(T_m^+ | C_m) = s_m = 0.85$.\n- The specificity for both tests is effectively $1$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the person is not a carrier. Thus, $P(T_f^- | \\neg C_f) = 1$ and $P(T_m^- | \\neg C_m) = 1$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive other conditional probabilities:\n- The false negative rate for the female's test is $P(T_f^- | C_f) = 1 - s_f = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\n- The false negative rate for the male's test is $P(T_m^- | C_m) = 1 - s_m = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- The false positive rate for both tests is $1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 1 = 0$. So, $P(T_f^+ | \\neg C_f) = 0$ and $P(T_m^+ | \\neg C_m) = 0$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that the next child is affected, given the couple's test results: $P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-)$.\n\nFor an autosomal recessive condition with complete penetrance, a child is affected if and only if both parents are carriers and both transmit the recessive allele to the child. The probability of a carrier parent transmitting the recessive allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability of an affected child, given that both parents are carriers, is $P(A | C_f, C_m) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. If either parent is not a carrier, the probability of having an affected child is $0$.\n\nThe overall probability can be expressed as:\n$$P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-) = P(A | C_f, C_m) \\times P(C_f, C_m | T_f^+, T_m^-)$$\nSince the partners are unrelated, their carrier status is independent, and their test results are conditionally independent given their true carrier status. Thus, the joint posterior probability of them both being carriers can be separated into the product of their individual posterior probabilities:\n$$P(C_f, C_m | T_f^+, T_m^-) = P(C_f | T_f^+) \\times P(C_m | T_m^-)$$\nCombining these, the target probability is:\n$$P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times P(C_f | T_f^+) \\times P(C_m | T_m^-)$$\n\nWe must now calculate the posterior probability of being a carrier for each partner using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, for the female partner with a positive test result ($T_f^+$):\n$$P(C_f | T_f^+) = \\frac{P(T_f^+ | C_f) P(C_f)}{P(T_f^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T_f^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T_f^+) = P(T_f^+ | C_f) P(C_f) + P(T_f^+ | \\neg C_f) P(\\neg C_f)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P(C_f) = p_f = \\frac{1}{30}$\n$P(\\neg C_f) = 1 - p_f = 1 - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{30}$\n$P(T_f^+ | C_f) = s_f = 0.92$\n$P(T_f^+ | \\neg C_f) = 0$ (since specificity is $1$)\n$$P(T_f^+) = (0.92)\\left(\\frac{1}{30}\\right) + (0)\\left(\\frac{29}{30}\\right) = \\frac{0.92}{30}$$\nTherefore, the posterior probability for the female partner is:\n$$P(C_f | T_f^+) = \\frac{(0.92)(\\frac{1}{30})}{\\frac{0.92}{30}} = 1$$\nThis result is expected: with a test that has perfect specificity (no false positives), a positive result confirms carrier status with certainty.\n\nNext, for the male partner with a negative test result ($T_m^-$):\n$$P(C_m | T_m^-) = \\frac{P(T_m^- | C_m) P(C_m)}{P(T_m^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T_m^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T_m^-) = P(T_m^- | C_m) P(C_m) + P(T_m^- | \\neg C_m) P(\\neg C_m)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P(C_m) = p_m = \\frac{1}{40}$\n$P(\\neg C_m) = 1 - p_m = 1 - \\frac{1}{40} = \\frac{39}{40}$\n$P(T_m^- | C_m) = 1 - s_m = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$ (false negative rate)\n$P(T_m^- | \\neg C_m) = 1$ (specificity)\n$$P(T_m^-) = (0.15)\\left(\\frac{1}{40}\\right) + (1)\\left(\\frac{39}{40}\\right) = \\frac{0.15 + 39}{40} = \\frac{39.15}{40}$$\nTherefore, the posterior probability for the male partner is:\n$$P(C_m | T_m^-) = \\frac{(0.15)(\\frac{1}{40})}{\\frac{39.15}{40}} = \\frac{0.15}{39.15} = \\frac{15}{3915} = \\frac{1}{261}$$\nThis is the residual risk that the male partner is a carrier despite his negative test result.\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find the probability of an affected child:\n$$P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times P(C_f | T_f^+) \\times P(C_m | T_m^-)$$\n$$P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{261} = \\frac{1}{1044}$$\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{1}{1044} \\approx 0.0009578544...$$\nThe first four significant figures are $9$, $5$, $7$, and $8$.
