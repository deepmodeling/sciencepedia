It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical statistics and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All provided values are realistic for a newborn screening scenario.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a newborn has the disorder, and $D^c$ be the event that the newborn does not have the disorder. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be translated into probabilistic terms:\nThe prevalence of the disorder is $p = P(D) = \\frac{1}{10000} = 0.0001$.\nThe probability of not having the disorder is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the assay, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the true positive rate, defined as the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of the disorder:\n$$ \\mathrm{Se} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95 $$\nThe specificity of the assay, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, is the true negative rate, defined as the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of the disorder:\n$$ \\mathrm{Sp} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.995 $$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the false negative rate (FNR) and the false positive rate (FPR):\nThe false negative rate is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - \\mathrm{Se}$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$.\n\nOur objective is to derive expressions for the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV).\nThe PPV is the probability that a subject with a positive test result truly has the disorder, $P(D | T^+)$.\nThe NPV is the probability that a subject with a negative test result truly does not have the disorder, $P(D^c | T^-)$.\n\nWe use Bayes’ theorem to derive the expressions. For the PPV:\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ P(T^+) = (\\mathrm{Se})(p) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p) $$\nTherefore, the general expression for PPV is:\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p)} $$\n\nFor the NPV:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ P(T^-) = (\\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})(p) $$\nTherefore, the general expression for NPV is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sp}(1 - p)}{\\mathrm{Sp}(1 - p) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the given data:\n$p = 0.0001$, $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.95$, $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.995$.\n$1 - p = 0.9999$, $1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 0.05$, $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.005$.\n\nComputing PPV:\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.0001)}{(0.95)(0.0001) + (0.005)(0.9999)} = \\frac{0.000095}{0.000095 + 0.0049995} = \\frac{0.000095}{0.0050945} \\approx 0.018647560... $$\nRounding to six significant figures, $\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.0186476$.\n\nComputing NPV:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{(0.995)(0.9999)}{(0.995)(0.9999) + (0.05)(0.0001)} = \\frac{0.9949005}{0.9949005 + 0.000005} = \\frac{0.9949005}{0.9949055} \\approx 0.99999497... $$\nRounding to six significant figures, $\\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 0.999995$.\n\nRegarding the implications for the referral burden, the computed PPV of approximately $0.0186$ is quite low. This value signifies that only about $1.86\\%$ of all newborns who screen positive will actually have the disorder confirmed by subsequent diagnostic testing. The reciprocal of the PPV, $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{PPV}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0186476} \\approx 53.6$, indicates that for every true case of the disorder identified through the screening program, approximately $54$ screen-positive infants must be referred for follow-up evaluation. This high ratio of false positives to true positives represents a substantial referral burden on the healthcare system and causes significant anxiety and stress for the families of the newborns who are ultimately found to be unaffected. This illustrates a fundamental challenge in screening for rare diseases: even with high specificity, the low prevalence of the disease leads to a low PPV.",

            "problem": "A state newborn screening program evaluates a rare recessive metabolic disorder with prevalence $p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ in the birth cohort. A first-tier biochemical assay is applied to all newborns and has sensitivity $s_{1} = 0.99$ and specificity $c_{1} = 0.98$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a newborn has the disorder, and $D^c$ be the event that a newborn does not have the disorder. The prior probability of disease is given by the prevalence, $P(D) = p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.9999$.\n\nLet $T_1^+$ denote a positive result on the first-tier assay and $T_2^+$ a positive result on the second-tier assay. The performance characteristics of the assays are given as:\n- Sensitivity of tier 1: $s_1 = P(T_1^+ | D) = 0.99$\n- Specificity of tier 1: $c_1 = P(T_1^- | D^c) = 0.98$, which implies the false positive rate is $P(T_1^+ | D^c) = 1 - c_1 = 0.02$.\n- Sensitivity of tier 2: $s_2 = P(T_2^+ | D) = 0.95$\n- Specificity of tier 2: $c_2 = P(T_2^- | D^c) = 0.9995$, which implies the false positive rate is $P(T_2^+ | D^c) = 1 - c_2 = 0.0005$.\n\nA standard assumption in sequential testing problems, unless stated otherwise, is that the test outcomes are conditionally independent given the true disease status. That is, $P(T_2^+ | D, T_1^+) = P(T_2^+ | D)$ and $P(T_2^+ | D^c, T_1^+) = P(T_2^+ | D^c)$.\n\n**1. Posterior Odds after a Positive First-Tier Test**\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio (LR).\nThe prior odds of disease are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p}{1-p} $$\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive first-tier test is:\n$$ LR_1^+ = \\frac{P(T_1^+ | D)}{P(T_1^+ | D^c)} = \\frac{s_1}{1-c_1} $$\nThe posterior odds of disease given a positive first-tier test, $\\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+)$, are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR_1^+ = \\frac{p}{1-p} \\times \\frac{s_1}{1-c_1} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+) = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} \\times \\frac{0.99}{1 - 0.98} = \\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999} \\times \\frac{0.99}{0.02} \\approx (1.0001 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 49.5 \\approx 4.95 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n\n**2. Posterior Odds after Sequential Positive Tests**\n\nFor the second stage of testing, the prior odds are the posterior odds from the first stage, $\\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+)$. The likelihood ratio for a positive second-tier test, $LR_2^+$, is derived under the assumption of conditional independence:\n$$ LR_2^+ = \\frac{P(T_2^+ | D, T_1^+)}{P(T_2^+ | D^c, T_1^+)} = \\frac{P(T_2^+ | D)}{P(T_2^+ | D^c)} = \\frac{s_2}{1-c_2} $$\nThe posterior odds after two sequential positive tests, $\\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+, T_2^+)$, are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+, T_2^+) = \\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+) \\times LR_2^+ = \\left( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\frac{s_1}{1-c_1} \\right) \\times \\frac{s_2}{1-c_2} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T_1^+, T_2^+) \\approx (4.95 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\frac{0.95}{1 - 0.9995} = (4.95 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\frac{0.95}{0.0005} = (4.95 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 1900 \\approx 9.405 $$\n\n**3. Expected Number of False Positives**\n\nA false positive (FP) is an individual without the disease ($D^c$) who tests positive.\nFor a single-tier strategy using only the first assay, a false positive occurs with probability $P(T_1^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T_1^+ | D^c)P(D^c) = (1 - c_1)(1 - p)$.\nThe expected number of false positives, $E[\\text{FP}_1]$, in a cohort of size $N$ is:\n$$ E[\\text{FP}_1] = N \\times (1 - c_1)(1 - p) $$\n$$ E[\\text{FP}_1] = 100,000 \\times (1 - 0.98) \\times (1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 100,000 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.9999 = 2000 \\times 0.9999 = 1999.8 $$\n\nFor the two-tier strategy, a false positive requires positive results on both tests for an individual without the disease. The probability is $P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ \\cap D^c)$. Using the assumption of conditional independence:\n$P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T_2^+ | D^c) P(T_1^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (1 - c_2)(1 - c_1)(1 - p)$.\nThe expected number of false positives for the two-tier strategy, $E[\\text{FP}_{1,2}]$, is:\n$$ E[\\text{FP}_{1,2}] = N \\times (1 - c_2)(1 - c_1)(1 - p) $$\n$$ E[\\text{FP}_{1,2}] = 100,000 \\times (1 - 0.9995) \\times (1 - 0.98) \\times (1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) $$\n$$ E[\\text{FP}_{1,2}] = 100,000 \\times 0.0005 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.9999 = 1 \\times 0.9999 = 0.9999 $$\n\n**4. Fold Reduction in False Positives**\n\nThe fold reduction is the ratio of the expected number of false positives from the single-tier strategy to that of the two-tier strategy.\n$$ \\text{Fold Reduction} = \\frac{E[\\text{FP}_1]}{E[\\text{FP}_{1,2}]} = \\frac{N (1 - c_1)(1 - p)}{N (1 - c_2)(1 - c_1)(1 - p)} $$\nThe terms $N$, $(1-c_1)$, and $(1-p)$ cancel out, yielding a simplified expression:\n$$ \\text{Fold Reduction} = \\frac{1}{1-c_2} $$\nThis result has a clear interpretation: the initial pool of false positives from the first tier is reduced by a factor corresponding to the reciprocal of the false positive rate of the second-tier test.\nSubstituting the value for $c_2$:\n$$ \\text{Fold Reduction} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.9995} = \\frac{1}{0.0005} = 2000 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $2000$ can be written in scientific notation as $2.0 \\times 10^3$ to explicitly denote two significant figures.",

            "solution": "The problem is to find the optimal decision threshold $t$ for a newborn screening test that minimizes an expected loss function, and then to convert this threshold into a concentration cutoff $\\tau$.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(c_{FN} p) - \\frac{(t-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln(c_{FP} (1-p)) - \\frac{(t-\\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$$\nRearranging to solve for $t$:\n$$\\frac{(t-\\mu_0)^2 - (t-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln(c_{FP} (1-p)) - \\ln(c_{FN} p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{FP}(1-p)}{c_{FN}p}\\right)$$\nExpanding the numerator on the left side:\n$$(t^2 - 2t\\mu_0 + \\mu_0^2) - (t^2 - 2t\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2) = 2t(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0) + \\mu_0^2 - \\mu_1^2 = 2t(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0) - (\\mu_1^2 - \\mu_0^2)$$\nFactoring the difference of squares:\n$$2t(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)(\\mu_1 + \\mu_0) = (\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)(2t - (\\mu_1 + \\mu_0))$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n$$(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)(2t - (\\mu_1 + \\mu_0)) = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{FP}(1-p)}{c_{FN}p}\\right)$$\n$$2t - (\\mu_1 + \\mu_0) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\mu_1-\\mu_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{FP}(1-p)}{c_{FN}p}\\right)$$\nFinally, isolating $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{\\mu_0+\\mu_1}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_1-\\mu_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{FP}(1-p)}{c_{FN}p}\\right)$$\nThis is the general expression for the optimal threshold.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n-   $\\mu_0 = \\ln(0.25)$\n-   $\\mu_1 = \\ln(2.0)$\n-   $\\sigma = 0.5$, so $\\sigma^2 = 0.25$\n-   $p = 1/15000$\n-   $c_{FP} = 1$\n-   $c_{FN} = 10^5$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the expression for $t$:\n$$\\mu_0+\\mu_1 = \\ln(0.25) + \\ln(2.0) = \\ln(0.25 \\times 2.0) = \\ln(0.5)$$\n$$\\mu_1-\\mu_0 = \\ln(2.0) - \\ln(0.25) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0}{0.25}\\right) = \\ln(8)$$\nThe argument of the logarithm is:\n$$\\frac{c_{FP}(1-p)}{c_{FN}p} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 - 1/15000)}{10^5 \\cdot (1/15000)} = \\frac{14999/15000}{100000/15000} = \\frac{14999}{100000} = 0.14999$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{2} + \\frac{0.25}{\\ln(8)} \\ln(0.14999)$$\nUsing numerical values for the logarithms: $\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.69315$, $\\ln(8) \\approx 2.07944$, and $\\ln(0.14999) \\approx -1.89719$.\n$$t \\approx \\frac{-0.69315}{2} + \\frac{0.25}{2.07944} (-1.89719)$$\n$$t \\approx -0.34657 + (0.12022) (-1.89719)$$\n$$t \\approx -0.34657 - 0.22809$$\n$$t \\approx -0.57466$$\nThe problem asks for the concentration cutoff $\\tau = \\exp(t)$.\n$$\\tau = \\exp(-0.57466)$$\n$$\\tau \\approx 0.56289 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{mol/L}$$\nRounding the final result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau \\approx 0.563 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{mol/L}$$\nThis is the concentration cutoff that minimizes the expected loss. Any newborn with an octanoylcarnitine concentration greater than or equal to this value should be flagged for further investigation.",
