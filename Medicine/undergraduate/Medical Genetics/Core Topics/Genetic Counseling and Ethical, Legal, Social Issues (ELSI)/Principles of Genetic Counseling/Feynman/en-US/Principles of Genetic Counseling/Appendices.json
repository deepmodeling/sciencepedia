            "problem": "A genetic counselor is analyzing an autosomal recessive condition caused by a deleterious allele $a$ at a single autosomal locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$. Let the frequency of allele $a$ in the population be $q$, and the frequency of allele $A$ be $p$, with $p+q=1$. Assume the population is large, randomly mating, and experiences no selection, migration, mutation, or assortative mating, so that Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) applies. Using only the foundational principles that under HWE the union of gametes is random and genotype frequencies arise from the product of gamete allele frequencies, derive the expected proportion of carriers (heterozygotes $Aa$) in terms of $p$ and $q$. Then, under the assumption that $q \\ll 1$ so that $p \\approx 1$, obtain the leading-order approximation of the carrier frequency expressed purely as a function of $q$. Provide your final simplified expression in terms of $q$ only, as a single closed-form analytic expression. Do not include units in your final answer, and do not express the result as an inequality or a percentage.",
            "solution": "The principles of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) state that in a large, randomly mating population with no selection, mutation, migration, or assortative mating, allele frequencies remain constant across generations, and genotype frequencies in the next generation are determined by random union of gametes. Let $p$ denote the frequency of allele $A$ and $q$ denote the frequency of allele $a$, with $p+q=1$.\n\nUnder random mating, the probability that a gamete carries allele $A$ is $p$, and the probability that a gamete carries allele $a$ is $q$. The genotype frequencies in zygotes are given by the probabilities of combining gametes:\n- The probability of genotype $AA$ is the probability that both gametes contribute $A$, which is $p \\times p = p^{2}$.\n- The probability of genotype $aa$ is the probability that both gametes contribute $a$, which is $q \\times q = q^{2}$.\n- The probability of genotype $Aa$ (heterozygote) is the probability of one gamete contributing $A$ and the other contributing $a$, which has two mutually exclusive ways: $A$ from one parent and $a$ from the other, or $a$ from one parent and $A$ from the other. Therefore, the probability is $p \\times q + q \\times p = 2pq$.\n\nThus, the carrier frequency (heterozygote proportion) under HWE is $2pq$.\n\nNow, apply the assumption $q \\ll 1$ and $p \\approx 1$. Since $p=1-q$, we have\n$$\n2pq = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^{2}.\n$$\nWhen $q \\ll 1$, the term $q^{2}$ is negligible compared to $q$, so the leading-order approximation is\n$$\n2pq \\approx 2q.\n$$\nThis is the carrier frequency expressed purely in terms of $q$ under the small-$q$ approximation.\n\nTherefore, the final simplified expression for the carrier frequency, in terms of $q$ only, is $2q$.",

            "problem": "A couple is known to be heterozygous carriers for a fully penetrant autosomal recessive condition. Let the disease allele be denoted by $a$ and the normal allele by $A$. Thus, both parents have genotype $Aa$. They have two children: the first is affected (genotype $aa$), and the second is clinically unaffected. Assume no new mutations, no gametic selection, and independent assortment across pregnancies.\n\nUsing only the foundational principles of Mendelian segregation and the definition of conditional probability, derive from first principles:\n1) the recurrence risk that the next pregnancy will result in an affected child, and\n2) the probability that the unaffected child is a carrier.\n\nIn your derivations, explicitly introduce any events you condition on and use the definition $P(X \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(X \\cap Y)}{P(Y)}$ where appropriate.

No rounding is required and no units are needed.",
            "solution": "The analysis begins with the foundational principles of Mendelian segregation for the given parental cross: $Aa \\times Aa$. Each parent produces gametes containing either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele with equal probability, $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The random fusion of these gametes during fertilization determines the genotype of an offspring.\n\nThe probabilities for the three possible offspring genotypes are:\n-   **Genotype $AA$ (unaffected, non-carrier)**: $P(AA) = P(A_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{mother}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   **Genotype $Aa$ (unaffected, carrier)**: $P(Aa) = (P(A_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{mother}})) + (P(a_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{mother}})) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   **Genotype $aa$ (affected)**: $P(aa) = P(a_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{mother}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\n**1) Recurrence Risk for the Next Pregnancy**\n\nThe problem asks for the recurrence risk, which is the probability that the next child will be affected. A core assumption is the independence of pregnancies. This means the genotypes of previous children have no influence on the genotype of a future child. The parental genotypes remain $Aa \\times Aa$, and the Mendelian probabilities for their offspring are constant for each pregnancy.\n\nAn \"affected\" child corresponds to the genotype $aa$, as the condition is fully penetrant. The probability of having a child with genotype $aa$ was derived directly from the principles of segregation.\n$$\n\\text{Recurrence risk} = P(\\text{next child is affected}) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\n**2) Probability that the Unaffected Child is a Carrier**\n\nThis calculation requires the use of conditional probability. We are given the information that the second child is clinically unaffected, and we want to find the probability that this child is a carrier.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a child is a carrier (genotype $Aa$).\nLet $U$ be the event that a child is clinically unaffected.\n\nWe need to calculate the conditional probability $P(C \\mid U)$, defined as:\n$$P(C \\mid U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of the conditioning event, $P(U)$. A child is unaffected if their genotype is either $AA$ or $Aa$. These are mutually exclusive events.\n$$P(U) = P(AA \\cup Aa) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nNext, we determine the probability of the intersection, $P(C \\cap U)$. This is the probability that a child is both a carrier ($C$) and unaffected ($U$). The only genotype that satisfies both conditions is $Aa$.\n$$P(C \\cap U) = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the conditional probability formula:\n$$P(C \\mid U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the unaffected child is a carrier is $\\frac{2}{3}$. This result can be understood intuitively: among the unaffected offspring from an $Aa \\times Aa$ cross, there are two $Aa$ individuals for every one $AA$ individual, so the chance of an unaffected child being a carrier is 2 out of 3.\n\nThe final answers are the recurrence risk ($\\frac{1}{4}$) and the carrier probability for the unaffected sibling ($\\frac{2}{3}$).",

            "problem": "A patient of Northern European ancestry undergoes an expanded carrier screening for a single autosomal recessive condition. The population pretest carrier probability for this condition is $1/30$. The screening assay has a detection rate $D$ for carriers (that is, the probability that the test will report a positive result given that the individual is truly a carrier is $D$). Assume the test is effectively perfectly specific for carriers (that is, the probability of a false positive in a non-carrier is negligible), and the carrier state is rare compared to non-carrier. The patient’s result is negative (no reportable pathogenic variants identified).\n\nStarting from first principles of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, and using the definitions of detection rate and specificity, derive an approximate expression for the residual carrier probability $P(\\text{carrier} \\mid \\text{negative})$ in terms of $D$ and the pretest probability $p$. Then, using $D=0.95$ and $p=1/30$, compute the approximate residual carrier probability. Express your final numerical answer as a fraction. No rounding is required.\n\nSeparately, in one sentence, propose patient-centered counseling language that communicates the meaning of this residual risk in a way consistent with the principles of genetic counseling (for example, nondirective, clear about limitations, and avoiding overpromising certainty).",
            "solution": "We are asked to derive an expression for the residual carrier probability, $P(\\text{carrier} \\mid \\text{negative})$. Let us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the patient is a carrier.\n- $NC$: The event that the patient is not a carrier.\n- $Pos$: The event of a positive test result.\n- $Neg$: The event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The pretest (prior) probability of being a carrier: $P(C) = p = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n- The detection rate (sensitivity): $P(Pos \\mid C) = D = 0.95$.\n- The probability of a false positive is negligible, so the specificity is effectively perfect. This means $P(Pos \\mid NC) \\approx 0$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce other necessary probabilities:\n- The prior probability of not being a carrier: $P(NC) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - p$.\n- The probability of a negative result given the patient is a carrier (false negative rate): $P(Neg \\mid C) = 1 - P(Pos \\mid C) = 1 - D$.\n- The probability of a negative result given the patient is not a carrier (true negative rate): $P(Neg \\mid NC) = 1 - P(Pos \\mid NC) \\approx 1 - 0 = 1$.\n\nWe seek to find the posterior probability $P(C \\mid Neg)$. According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) = \\frac{P(Neg \\mid C) P(C)}{P(Neg)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(Neg)$, is the total probability of a negative result, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(Neg) = P(Neg \\mid C)P(C) + P(Neg \\mid NC)P(NC) $$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $p$ and $D$:\n$$ P(Neg) = (1 - D)p + (1)(1 - p) = p - Dp + 1 - p = 1 - Dp $$\nNow, substituting this back into Bayes' theorem, we obtain the exact expression for the residual carrier probability under the model's assumptions:\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) = \\frac{(1 - D)p}{1 - Dp} $$\nThe problem asks for an *approximate* expression, leveraging the fact that the carrier state is rare, meaning $p \\ll 1$. When $p$ is small, the product $Dp$ is also small ($Dp \\ll 1$). Consequently, the denominator of the exact expression, $1 - Dp$, is approximately equal to $1$:\n$$ 1 - Dp \\approx 1 $$\nApplying this approximation to the exact formula yields the desired approximate expression for the residual carrier probability:\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) \\approx (1 - D)p $$\nThis approximation is physically meaningful: when the condition is rare, the vast majority of negative test results come from true non-carriers, so the total probability of a negative result is close to $1$. The residual risk is therefore approximately equal to the probability of the joint event of being a carrier *and* testing negative, which is $P(C \\cap Neg) = P(Neg \\mid C)P(C) = (1-D)p$.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of this approximate residual carrier probability using the given values $p = \\frac{1}{30}$ and $D = 0.95$.\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) \\approx (1 - 0.95) \\times \\frac{1}{30} $$\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) \\approx (0.05) \\times \\frac{1}{30} $$\nTo express this as a fraction, we write $0.05$ as $\\frac{5}{100}$ or $\\frac{1}{20}$:\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) \\approx \\frac{1}{20} \\times \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{600} $$\nThe approximate residual carrier probability is $\\frac{1}{600}$.\n\nSeparately, the counseling language to communicate this risk is proposed as follows:\nThis negative result reduces your chance of being a carrier from $1$ in $30$ to approximately $1$ in $600$, reflecting that the test is highly effective but cannot detect every possible genetic variant for the condition.",
