            "introduction": "Epigenetic patterns, unlike the DNA sequence itself, must be actively maintained across cell divisions to preserve cellular identity. This practice delves into the core mechanism of this process: maintenance methylation performed by enzymes like DNMT1. By modeling methylation as a probabilistic event that occurs after each round of DNA replication, we can derive how an epigenetic mark is either faithfully propagated or gradually diluted over generations . This exercise builds a quantitative intuition for the fundamental dynamics of epigenetic inheritance and stability.",

            "problem": "A single cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dyad consists of two complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands that can each carry a methyl group at the cytosine position. In mammalian cells, after DNA replication, methyl marks are retained on the parental strands, producing hemimethylated dyads in which the parental strand is methylated and the newly synthesized strand is unmethylated. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) performs maintenance methylation by methylating the unmethylated strand at hemimethylated sites with some efficiency interpreted as a probability. Assume the following mechanistic base:\n- After each division, parental methyl marks are perfectly copied to the parental strands, generating hemimethylated dyads at all sites that were methylated on the parental strands.\n- Maintenance methylation acts only at hemimethylated sites with efficiency $\\rho$ (probability that the unmethylated strand becomes methylated during the maintenance step in that division).\n- There is no de novo methylation on unmethylated dyads and no active demethylation; unmethylated dyads remain unmethylated.\n- Sites act independently and the population is large enough to use expected values.\n\nSuppose at division $0$ every CpG dyad in a population of cells is fully methylated (both strands methylated). At division $1$, the maintenance efficiency is $\\rho = p$, and at divisions $2$ through $n$ the maintenance efficiency decreases and remains at $\\rho = p'$, with $0 \\leq p' \\leq p \\leq 1$. Define the methylation level after each division as the expected fraction of methylated strands per CpG dyad (that is, $1$ for a fully methylated dyad, $\\frac{1}{2}$ for a hemimethylated dyad, and $0$ for an unmethylated dyad).\n\nUsing only the assumptions above, derive a closed-form analytic expression, in terms of $n$, $p$, and $p'$, for the expected dilution of methylation after $n$ cell divisions, quantified as the expected fraction of methylated strands per CpG dyad at division $n$. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression. No rounding is required and no units are needed.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established models of DNA methylation, mathematically well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated.\n\nLet $E_k$ represent the expected fraction of methylated strands per CpG dyad after cell division $k$. The problem defines this quantity for a fully methylated dyad as $1$, for a hemimethylated dyad as $\\frac{1}{2}$, and for an unmethylated dyad as $0$.\n\nThe process of changing methylation status from one division to the next consists of two stages: DNA replication and maintenance methylation. We will derive a recurrence relation for $E_k$ based on its value at the previous division, $E_{k-1}$.\n\nLet us consider the state of the cell population after division $k-1$. The expected fraction of methylated strands is $E_{k-1}$.\nThe first step in division $k$ is DNA replication. According to the problem, \"parental methyl marks are retained on the parental strands\". This means the total number of methylated strands in the entire cell population remains constant during replication. However, the total number of DNA strands doubles. Consequently, the expected fraction of methylated strands is exactly halved immediately following replication and before the maintenance phase. Let's denote this intermediate value as $E'_k$.\n$$E'_k = \\frac{1}{2} E_{k-1}$$\n\nThe second step is maintenance methylation. This process acts on hemimethylated sites. After replication, a dyad that was fully methylated (MM) becomes hemimethylated (HM), and a dyad that was hemimethylated (HM) becomes one hemimethylated (HM) and one unmethylated (UU) dyad. The fraction of dyads that are hemimethylated after replication, and thus are substrates for the maintenance enzyme DNMT1, is equal to the fraction of methylated strands present in the parental generation before replication. This is because each methylated strand gives rise to exactly one hemimethylated dyad. Therefore, the proportion of hemimethylated dyads available for maintenance at division $k$ is equal to $E_{k-1}$.\n\nMaintenance methylation, with efficiency $\\rho_k$, converts a fraction of these hemimethylated dyads into fully methylated dyads. When a hemimethylated dyad (methylation level $\\frac{1}{2}$) becomes fully methylated (methylation level $1$), its contribution to the average methylation level increases by $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe total increase in the expected methylation level, $\\Delta E_k$, is the product of the fraction of available sites (which is $E_{k-1}$), the efficiency of methylation at these sites ($\\rho_k$), and the change in methylation level per successful event ($\\frac{1}{2}$).\n$$\\Delta E_k = E_{k-1} \\cdot \\rho_k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\rho_k E_{k-1}}{2}$$\n\nThe final methylation level after division $k$, $E_k$, is the sum of the level after replication, $E'_k$, and the increase due to maintenance, $\\Delta E_k$.\n$$E_k = E'_k + \\Delta E_k = \\frac{1}{2} E_{k-1} + \\frac{\\rho_k E_{k-1}}{2}$$\nFactoring out $E_{k-1}$, we obtain the general recurrence relation:\n$$E_k = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_k}{2}\\right) E_{k-1}$$\n\nWe are given the initial condition: \"at division $0$ every CpG dyad ... is fully methylated\". This means at $k=0$, the fraction of fully methylated dyads is $1$, so the methylation level $E_0$ is:\n$$E_0 = 1$$\n\nThe maintenance efficiencies are given as:\n- For division $k=1$: $\\rho_1 = p$\n- For divisions $k=2, 3, \\ldots, n$: $\\rho_k = p'$\n\nWe can now solve the recurrence relation by unrolling it from $k=n$ down to $k=1$:\n$$E_n = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_n}{2}\\right) E_{n-1}$$\n$$E_n = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_n}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_{n-1}}{2}\\right) E_{n-2}$$\n$$E_n = \\ldots = E_0 \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_k}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $E_0$ and $\\rho_k$:\n$$E_n = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_2}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 + \\rho_n}{2}\\right)$$\n$$E_n = \\left(\\frac{1 + p}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1 + p'}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 + p'}{2}\\right)}_{n-1 \\text{ terms}}$$\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{1 + p'}{2}\\right)$ appears for $k=2, 3, \\ldots, n$, which is a total of $n-1$ times.\n\nThis gives the final closed-form analytic expression for the expected fraction of methylated strands per CpG dyad at division $n$:\n$$E_n = \\left(\\frac{1+p}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1+p'}{2}\\right)^{n-1}$$\nThis expression is valid for $n \\ge 1$. For the trivial case $n=0$, the level is $E_0=1$. The formula holds for $n=1$, yielding $E_1 = \\frac{1+p}{2}$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond general stability, epigenetic marks serve as powerful regulators of gene function, a concept vividly illustrated by genomic imprinting. This phenomenon, where gene expression occurs from only one parental allele, depends on parent-of-origin-specific methylation patterns. Here, we explore the classic example of the *IGF2* gene, whose expression is controlled by methylation at a nearby imprinting control region . This problem challenges you to translate this biological mechanism into a quantitative model, allowing you to calculate the change in gene dosage that occurs during a loss of imprinting, a common event in developmental disorders and cancer.",

            "problem": "A core principle of genomic imprinting is that certain genes are expressed from only one parental allele due to allele-specific epigenetic marks. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is typically expressed from the paternal allele because the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) near the H19/IGF2 locus is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated, the ICR binds the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), insulating IGF2 from shared enhancers and preventing transcription; when methylated, CTCF cannot bind, enhancer access is permitted, and the allele is transcriptionally active. Loss of Imprinting (LOI) refers to a state in which this parent-of-origin-specific control is disrupted, for example by aberrant methylation of the maternal ICR, allowing biallelic expression.\n\nConsider a large population of cells in which the fraction of alleles with methylated ICR is measured by bisulfite sequencing and reported as a methylation percentage. Assume that:\n- the methylation percentage for each allele equals the probability that a randomly chosen cell has that allele in the expression-permissive state,\n- an allele in the expression-permissive state contributes a normalized transcript output of $I_{0}$, and\n- an allele in the non-permissive state contributes $0$.\n\nUnder normal imprinting in this sample, the paternal allele has a measured ICR methylation of $0.90$, and the maternal allele has a measured ICR methylation of $0.05$. After Loss of Imprinting (LOI), the paternal allele methylation is $0.88$, and the maternal allele methylation is $0.70$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of expected value from probability theory and the biological mapping between ICR methylation and IGF2 expression described above, derive the expected total IGF2 expression per cell under each condition and compute the fold-change in total expected IGF2 expression (LOI divided by normal imprinting). Express the final fold-change as a decimal number. Round your final answer to four significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "Genomic imprinting sets the parental origin-specific expression pattern via epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. For the H19/IGF2 locus, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, which prevents CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding and permits enhancer access to IGF2, thereby allowing transcription. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated at the ICR, allowing CTCF binding to insulate IGF2 from enhancers, which represses IGF2 transcription. Loss of Imprinting (LOI) can aberrantly methylate the maternal ICR, abolishing CTCF binding and enabling IGF2 transcription from the maternal allele, producing biallelic expression.\n\nWe map methylation percentage to expression state probabilistically as follows. Let $m_{p}$ and $m_{m}$ denote the paternal and maternal ICR methylation fractions (each in $[0,1]$). By assumption, for a randomly chosen cell:\n- the paternal allele is expression-permissive with probability $m_{p}$ and non-permissive with probability $1 - m_{p}$,\n- the maternal allele is expression-permissive with probability $m_{m}$ and non-permissive with probability $1 - m_{m}$,\n- an expression-permissive allele contributes $I_{0}$ transcripts and a non-permissive allele contributes $0$.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation (a well-tested principle in probability), the expected IGF2 expression contributed by each allele equals the probability of the expression-permissive state times the output in that state plus the probability of the non-permissive state times the output in that state.

The formula provided is:\n$$m = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\beta_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$\nwhere $n=5$ is the number of CpG sites, $w_i$ is the number of informative reads for site $i$, and $\\beta_i$ is the methylation $\\beta$-value for site $i$.

This justification rests on the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ Protein) and the principles of epigenetic regulation.\n\n1.  **Epigenetic Silencing**: The methylation of cytosine bases in CpG dinucleotides within a gene's promoter region is a primary epigenetic mechanism for regulating gene expression. High levels of promoter methylation are strongly associated with the recruitment of protein complexes that condense chromatin, making the DNA inaccessible to the transcriptional machinery (like RNA polymerase). This process, known as transcriptional silencing, effectively turns the gene \"off,\" preventing the production of its corresponding protein.\n\n2.  **The Role of MGMT**: The $MGMT$ gene encodes the $O\\textsuperscript{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein. This protein is a DNA repair enzyme that specifically removes alkyl adducts from the O\\textsuperscript{6} position of guanine residues in DNA.\n\n3.  **Mechanism of Temozolomide**: Temozolomide is an alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma. Its cytotoxic effect stems from its ability to methylate DNA, creating lesions such as $O\\textsuperscript{6}$-methylguanine. These lesions are mutagenic and cytotoxic; if left unrepaired, they cause DNA strand breaks during replication, ultimately triggering cell death (apoptosis).\n\n4.  **Connecting the Model to Biology**:\n    -   In a patient with **low** $MGMT$ promoter methylation (low $m$), the $MGMT$ gene is transcriptionally active. The resulting MGMT protein actively repairs the DNA damage caused by temozolomide. This repair mechanism confers resistance to the therapy, leading to a poor clinical response.\n    -   In a patient with **high** $MGMT$ promoter methylation (high $m$), the $MGMT$ gene is silenced. The cell cannot produce the MGMT repair protein. Consequently, the DNA damage induced by temozolomide accumulates, leading to high levels of cytotoxicity and a favorable clinical response.\n\n5.  **Clinical Utility**: The logistic regression model, $\\ln(p/(1-p)) = b_0 + b_1 m$, mathematically formalizes this biological relationship. The positive coefficient $b_1 = 5.0$ confirms that a higher mean methylation fraction $m$ is associated with a higher probability of response $p$. The clinical utility of this model is significant for personalized medicine. By measuring a patient's $MGMT$ promoter methylation status, clinicians can generate a quantitative prediction of their likelihood of responding to temozolomide. This allows for patient stratification:\n    -   Patients with high methylation (like the one in this problem, with a predicted response probability of $\\approx 82\\%$) can be confidently treated with temozolomide.\n    -   Patients with low methylation might be spared the toxicity of an ineffective treatment and instead be directed toward alternative therapies or clinical trials, improving outcomes and avoiding unnecessary side effects.\n\nTherefore, the model provides a powerful, biologically-grounded biomarker for guiding treatment decisions in glioblastoma.",
