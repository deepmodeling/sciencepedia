A missense variant can impair an enzyme by altering its catalytic turnover rate ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) or its affinity for its substrate (inversely related to $K_M$). This exercise allows you to directly calculate and compare the performance of a wild-type versus a variant enzyme, illustrating how a single amino acid change translates into a quantifiable biochemical deficit ().",

            "problem": "A missense coding variant in a human metabolic enzyme alters its kinetic properties relative to the wild type. According to the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein), a change in the protein sequence can modify enzyme function by changing the turnover number and substrate affinity. The variant is observed to have a reduced turnover number and decreased apparent substrate affinity compared to the wild type, characterized by the following parameters: wild-type turnover number $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}=100\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, wild-type Michaelis constant $K_{M}=20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$; variant turnover number $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}=10\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, variant Michaelis constant $K_{M}=200\\ \\mu\\text{M}$. Assume an initial-rate regime where product accumulation is negligible and substrate concentration is much greater than enzyme concentration, with total enzyme concentration $[E]_{T}=50\\ \\text{nM}$.

Let $E$ represent the collection of all observed evidence.\n\nThe prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $P(H_P) = 0.1$. The prior probability of being benign is therefore $P(H_B) = 1 - P(H_P) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\n\nFirst, we convert the prior probability to prior odds. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(H_P) = \\frac{P(H_P)}{P(H_B)} = \\frac{P(H_P)}{1 - P(H_P)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given prior probability:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(H_P) = \\frac{0.1}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nThe problem states that Bayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds and likelihood ratios (LR).

Given the assumption that the lines of evidence are independent, the total likelihood ratio for the set of evidence $E = \\{E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\}$ is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR(E) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} LR(E_i)\n$$\nCombining these, the expression for the posterior odds is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(H_P | E) = \\left( \\frac{P(H_P)}{1 - P(H_P)} \\right) \\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n} LR(E_i)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression. Now we evaluate it for the specified evidence set. The evidence consists of one $\\text{PVS1}$, one $\\text{PM}$, two $\\text{PP}$, and one $\\text{BS}$ criterion.
