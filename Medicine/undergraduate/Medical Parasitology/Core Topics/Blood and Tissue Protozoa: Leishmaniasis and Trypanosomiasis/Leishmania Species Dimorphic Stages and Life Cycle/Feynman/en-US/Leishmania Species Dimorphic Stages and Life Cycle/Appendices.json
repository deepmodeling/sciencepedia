A key driver of this transition is vacuolar acidification, which results from proton pumping by Vacuolar-type Adenosine Triphosphatase (V-ATPase) and opposing proton leakage, acting on a compartment with finite buffer capacity. Consider a newly formed parasitophorous vacuole containing a promastigote of a visceral Leishmania species immediately after uptake by a human macrophage.
