            "problem": "A child from a rural triatomine-bug–endemic region presents within one week of suspected nocturnal exposure with unilateral painless periorbital edema consistent with Romana's sign. In the local surveillance database of febrile illnesses in similar-age children, the baseline pre-test probability of acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection is $0.015$. Observational epidemiology further shows that documented conjunctival contamination with triatomine feces (ocular route) confers an odds ratio ($OR$) of $4$ for acute infection relative to febrile children without such exposure. The child's examination confirms Romana's sign, and a rapid immunochromatographic assay detecting T. cruzi immunoglobulin M (IgM) is positive.\n\nAssume the following test performance estimates for the acute phase:\n- Sensitivity of Romana's sign (as a binary clinical finding): $0.25$; specificity: $0.98$.\n- Sensitivity of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) rapid test: $0.85$; specificity: $0.92$.\n\nAssume conditional independence of Romana's sign and the IgM assay given disease status. Using appropriate probabilistic reasoning grounded in fundamental definitions of probability, odds, and likelihood ratios, compute the posterior probability that the child has acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection after incorporating the ocular-route odds ratio, the presence of Romana's sign, and the positive IgM test.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability of acute *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection given a set of clinical and laboratory findings. This is a problem of Bayesian inference, which can be elegantly solved using the odds-likelihood ratio formulation.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Baseline pre-test probability of acute *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection, $P(D)$: $0.015$. This represents the prevalence in the reference population of febrile children.\n- Odds ratio ($OR$) for conjunctival contamination (ocular route): $4$.\n- Clinical finding: Positive Romana's sign, denoted as the event $R$.\n- Laboratory finding: Positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) rapid test, denoted as the event $M$.\n- Sensitivity of Romana's sign, $\\text{Sens}_R = P(R|D)$: $0.25$.\n- Specificity of Romana's sign, $\\text{Spec}_R = P(R^c|D^c)$: $0.98$.\n- Sensitivity of the IgM rapid test, $\\text{Sens}_M = P(M|D)$: $0.85$.\n- Specificity of the IgM rapid test, $\\text{Spec}_M = P(M^c|D^c)$: $0.92$.\n- Assumption: Romana's sign and the IgM assay are conditionally independent given the disease status ($D$ or $D^c$).\n\nLet $D$ represent the event that the child has an acute *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection, and $D^c$ represent the event that the child does not.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the clinical epidemiology of Chagas disease. The concepts of pre-test probability, odds ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and conditional independence are standard tools in medical diagnostics and biostatistics. The numerical values provided are plausible for clinical signs and serological assays. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution without internal contradictions. The structure requires a sequential update of probability: first adjusting the baseline probability using the risk-factor odds ratio, and then updating this new prior with the results of the two diagnostic tests. This is a standard and valid approach in clinical reasoning. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed with Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main stages:\n1.  Update the baseline pre-test probability using the odds ratio associated with the ocular exposure route.\n2.  Calculate the likelihood ratios for the positive Romana's sign and the positive IgM test.\n3.  Combine the updated prior odds with the likelihood ratios to compute the final posterior odds, and convert this to the posterior probability.\n\n**Stage 1: Update the Prior Probability**\n\nThe initial or baseline pre-test probability for a child from the specified population is $P_{prior_0}(D) = 0.015$. The corresponding probability of not having the disease is $P_{prior_0}(D^c) = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985$.\n\nThe baseline prior odds of having the disease are given by the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{prior_0}(D) = \\frac{P_{prior_0}(D)}{P_{prior_0}(D^c)} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985} = \\frac{15}{985} = \\frac{3}{197}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that conjunctival contamination confers an odds ratio ($OR$) of $4$. The child's presentation with Romana's sign is a direct consequence of this exposure route, so it is appropriate to update the prior odds for this specific child by this factor. The new prior odds, $\\text{Odds}_{prior_1}(D)$, reflecting this specific risk factor, are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{prior_1}(D) = \\text{Odds}_{prior_0}(D) \\times OR = \\frac{3}{197} \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{197}\n$$\nThis updated value represents the prior odds of disease before considering the results of the specific diagnostic tests (Romana's sign as a formal finding, and the IgM test).\n\n**Stage 2: Calculate Likelihood Ratios**\n\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive test result, $LR(+)$, is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual (false positive rate, or $1 - \\text{specificity}$).\n\nFor a positive Romana's sign ($R$):\n- Sensitivity, $P(R|D) = 0.25$.\n- Specificity, $P(R^c|D^c) = 0.98$.\n- False positive rate, $P(R|D^c) = 1 - P(R^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive Romana's sign is:\n$$\nLR(R) = \\frac{P(R|D)}{P(R|D^c)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.02} = 12.5\n$$\n\nFor a positive IgM test ($M$):\n- Sensitivity, $P(M|D) = 0.85$.\n- Specificity, $P(M^c|D^c) = 0.92$.\n- False positive rate, $P(M|D^c) = 1 - P(M^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive IgM test is:\n$$\nLR(M) = \\frac{P(M|D)}{P(M|D^c)} = \\frac{0.85}{0.08} = \\frac{85}{8} = 10.625\n$$\n\nDue to the assumption of conditional independence, the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence ($R$ and $M$) is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR(R, M) = LR(R) \\times LR(M) = 12.5 \\times 10.625 = 132.8125\n$$\n\n**Stage 3: Calculate the Posterior Probability**\n\nThe posterior odds of disease, $\\text{Odds}_{post}(D | R, M)$, are found by multiplying the updated prior odds, $\\text{Odds}_{prior_1}(D)$, by the combined likelihood ratio, $LR(R, M)$:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{post}(D | R, M) = \\text{Odds}_{prior_1}(D) \\times LR(R, M) = \\frac{12}{197} \\times 132.8125\n$$\nTo maintain precision, we can use fractional forms: $132.8125 = \\frac{1328125}{10000} = \\frac{2125}{16}$.\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{post}(D | R, M) = \\frac{12}{197} \\times \\frac{2125}{16} = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{197} \\times \\frac{2125}{4 \\times 4} = \\frac{3 \\times 2125}{197 \\times 4} = \\frac{6375}{788}\n$$\n\nFinally, the posterior probability, $P_{post}(D | R, M)$, is calculated from the posterior odds using the relationship $P = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}$:\n$$\nP_{post}(D | R, M) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{post}(D | R, M)}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{post}(D | R, M)} = \\frac{\\frac{6375}{788}}{1 + \\frac{6375}{788}} = \\frac{6375}{788 + 6375} = \\frac{6375}{7163}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nP_{post}(D | R, M) \\approx 0.890004188...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested by the problem statement, yields $0.8900$.\nThus, after incorporating all evidence, the probability that the child has acute *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection is approximately $89.00\\%$.",

            "problem": "A community in the Amazon basin experiences an acute cluster of febrile illness following a festival where guava juice was served. Laboratory confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identifies acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection in cases. Investigators suspect an orally transmitted common-source outbreak due to contamination of the guava juice by triatomine bug feces. During a retrospective cohort assessment, the following is observed: among $200$ attendees, $140$ drank the guava juice (exposed) and $60$ did not (unexposed). Among the $140$ exposed individuals, $84$ developed PCR-confirmed acute Chagas disease, while among the $60$ unexposed individuals, $6$ developed PCR-confirmed acute Chagas disease. For the purpose of source attribution within this outbreak investigation, assume route-of-acquisition classification as follows: cases among juice drinkers are considered orally acquired and cases among non-drinkers are considered vector-acquired.\n\nIn acute Chagas disease, unilateral painless periorbital edema (Romana's sign) is an external marker consistent with conjunctival inoculation typically seen in vector-borne transmission. For differentiating vector-acquired versus orally acquired acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection among confirmed cases, the presence of Romana's sign has sensitivity $0.70$ for vector-acquired infection and specificity $0.95$ against orally acquired infection in this epidemiologic context.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of attack rate, prior probability, sensitivity, specificity, and the law of conditional probability, derive from first principles the posterior probability that a randomly selected PCR-confirmed case from this cohort who presents with Romana's sign acquired the infection through the vector route rather than the oral route.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability that a randomly selected, PCR-confirmed case of Chagas disease who presents with Romana's sign acquired the infection through the vector route. This is a problem of conditional probability that can be solved using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the events and probabilities from the information given.\nLet $C$ be the event that an individual is a PCR-confirmed case.\nLet $Vector$ be the event that a confirmed case was acquired via the vector-borne route. For this problem, this corresponds to cases among individuals who did not drink the guava juice.\nLet $Oral$ be the event that a confirmed case was acquired via the oral route. This corresponds to cases among individuals who drank the guava juice.\nLet $RS$ be the event that a confirmed case presents with Romana's sign.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is the posterior probability $P(Vector | RS)$.\n\nAccording to the law of conditional probability, which is the basis of Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(Vector | RS) = \\frac{P(Vector \\cap RS)}{P(RS)}$$\nThe numerator can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)$, as:\n$$P(Vector | RS) = \\frac{P(RS | Vector) \\cdot P(Vector)}{P(RS)}$$\n\nTo solve this, we must determine three quantities:\n$1$. $P(Vector)$: The prior probability that a randomly selected case is vector-acquired.\n$2$. $P(RS | Vector)$: The probability of observing Romana's sign given the infection was vector-acquired (the sensitivity).\n$3$. $P(RS)$: The overall (marginal) probability of a case presenting with Romana's sign, regardless of acquisition route.\n\nLet's calculate these quantities from the data provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the prior probabilities, $P(Vector)$ and $P(Oral)$, based on the population of confirmed cases.\nNumber of cases among the exposed (orally acquired), $C_{Oral} = 84$.\nNumber of cases among the unexposed (vector-acquired), $C_{Vector} = 6$.\nThe total number of confirmed cases in the cohort is $C_{Total} = C_{Oral} + C_{Vector} = 84 + 6 = 90$.\n\nThe prior probability that a randomly selected case is vector-acquired is the ratio of vector-acquired cases to the total number of cases:\n$$P(Vector) = \\frac{C_{Vector}}{C_{Total}} = \\frac{6}{90}$$\nSimilarly, the prior probability that a case is orally acquired is:\n$$P(Oral) = \\frac{C_{Oral}}{C_{Total}} = \\frac{84}{90}$$\nNote that $P(Vector) + P(Oral) = \\frac{6}{90} + \\frac{84}{90} = \\frac{90}{90} = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we identify the conditional probabilities related to Romana's sign, known as likelihoods in Bayesian terminology.\nThe sensitivity of Romana's sign for vector-acquired infection is given as:\n$$P(RS | Vector) = 0.70$$\nThe specificity of Romana's sign against orally acquired infection is given as $P(\\neg RS | Oral) = 0.95$, where $\\neg RS$ is the event of not having Romana's sign. Since having the sign and not having the sign are complementary events for a given case, their probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$P(RS | Oral) + P(\\neg RS | Oral) = 1$$\nTherefore, the probability of having Romana's sign given an oral infection is:\n$$P(RS | Oral) = 1 - P(\\neg RS | Oral) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\nThis value represents the false positive rate of the sign for detecting vector-borne transmission.\n\nNow, we calculate the marginal probability, $P(RS)$, using the law of total probability.

            "problem": "A rural village in an endemic region for Trypanosoma cruzi has been surveyed to estimate household triatomine infestation and to interpret likely clinical outcomes related to Chagas disease. Triatomine insects (commonly called kissing bugs) transmit Trypanosoma cruzi through stercorarian contamination, and conjunctival inoculation can lead to the early clinical manifestation known as Romana's sign (unilateral painless periorbital edema). Consider the following scientifically grounded facts and survey measurements.\n\nFundamental base:\n- In a household infestation survey, the observed infestation fraction under imperfect detection is the product of the true infestation fraction and the detection sensitivity. If the detection sensitivity is known, the true infestation fraction can be inferred from the observed fraction by dividing by sensitivity. \n- The expected number of events in a population over a time horizon equals the sum of expected per-individual per-time probabilities, under independence and stationarity of exposure.\n- In an infested household, each triatomine has some nightly probability of blood feeding, and feeding events are distributed across residents. A subset of feeds occur near the face, and for infected bugs, a fraction defecates near the bite. A small fraction of contamination events reach the conjunctiva and can cause infection, of which a fraction present as Romana's sign.\n\nVillage and survey data:\n- There are $500$ households and $1{,}800$ residents in the village, with approximately uniform occupancy.\n- A random sample of $240$ households underwent a timed manual search. At least one triatomine was found in $54$ of the $240$ sampled households.\n- The per-household detection sensitivity of this search protocol (probability of detecting infestation when it is truly present) is $0.75$.\n- In infested households, the average triatomine density is $3$ bugs per household.\n- Each triatomine has a nightly blood feeding probability of $0.35$.\n- Bugs infected with Trypanosoma cruzi comprise $0.40$ of the triatomine population.\n- Of feeding events by infected bugs, the probability of defecation during or immediately after feeding near the bite site is $0.90$.\n- Of face-proximate feeding events, the probability that contamination reaches the conjunctiva is $0.05$.\n- Given conjunctival contamination, the probability of successful Trypanosoma cruzi infection is $0.30$.\n- Among infections acquired via conjunctival inoculation, the probability of Romana's sign is $0.60$.\n- The proportion of feeds occurring near the face in the absence of protection is $0.15$.\n- Bed nets are used by $0.30$ of residents, and for those residents, the fraction of feeds occurring near the face is reduced by $50\\%$ relative to the unprotected fraction.\n- Consider a warm season of $90$ consecutive nights.\n\nAssume that feeding events are independently and uniformly distributed among household residents, that the stated fractions are stable over the season, and that household occupancy is approximately constant across households.

It represents a valid quantitative problem in applied epidemiology. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of Romana's sign cases, denoted $E[N_{Romana}]$, in the village over a $90$-night season. This can be calculated by determining the total number of \"risk events\" (a feeding by an infected, defecating triatomine) and multiplying this by the probability that such an event leads to Romana's sign. The calculation proceeds in a stepwise fashion.\n\n**Step 1: Estimate the true household infestation fraction**\nThe observed infestation fraction in the sample, $\\hat{p}_{H, obs}$, is the ratio of infested households found to the total number of households sampled.\n$$ \\hat{p}_{H, obs} = \\frac{n_{H, obs}}{n_H} = \\frac{54}{240} = 0.225 $$\nThis observed fraction underestimates the true fraction due to imperfect detection. The true infestation fraction, $\\hat{p}_{H, true}$, is inferred by correcting for the detection sensitivity, $S$.\n$$ \\hat{p}_{H, true} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_{H, obs}}{S} = \\frac{0.225}{0.75} = 0.30 $$\nThus, we estimate that $30\\%$ of households in the village are truly infested.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate the total number of triatomine bugs in the village**\nFirst, we find the total number of infested households, $N_{H, inf}$, in the village by applying the true infestation fraction to the total number of households.\n$$ N_{H, inf} = N_{H, total} \\times \\hat{p}_{H, true} = 500 \\times 0.30 = 150 \\text{ households} $$\nNext, we calculate the total triatomine population, $N_T$, by multiplying the number of infested households by the average density of bugs per infested household, $D_T$.\n$$ N_T = N_{H, inf} \\times D_T = 150 \\times 3 = 450 \\text{ bugs} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of exposure-relevant feeding events over the season**\nAn exposure-relevant event is a feeding by a triatomine that is infected and defecates near the bite. We first find the total number of feeding events over the $T = 90$ night season.\n$$ N_{feeds, total} = N_T \\times p_{feed} \\times T = 450 \\times 0.35 \\times 90 = 14{,}175 $$\nFrom these, the number of feeds by infected bugs is:\n$$ N_{feeds, inf} = N_{feeds, total} \\times p_{inf} = 14{,}175 \\times 0.40 = 5{,}670 $$\nThe total number of \"risk events\", $N_{risk}$, where an infected bug also defecates, is:\n$$ N_{risk} = N_{feeds, inf} \\times p_{def} = 5{,}670 \\times 0.90 = 5{,}103 $$\nThis is the total number of potential conjunctival inoculation events distributed among the village population over the season.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the population-averaged probability of a risk event causing Romana's sign**\nThe probability of a host being inoculated depends on the bite location (face or not), which is affected by bed net use. We must calculate a population-averaged probability of a bite being on the face, $\\bar{p}_{face}$.\nThe proportion of residents not using nets is $(1 - f_{net}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe proportion of residents using nets is $f_{net} = 0.30$.\nFor unprotected residents, the probability of a facial bite is $p_{face, unprot} = 0.15$.\nFor protected residents, this probability is reduced by $R_{net} = 0.50$:\n$$ p_{face, prot} = p_{face, unprot} \\times (1 - R_{net}) = 0.15 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.075 $$\nThe population-averaged probability of a facial bite is the weighted average across both groups:\n$$ \\bar{p}_{face} = (1 - f_{net}) \\times p_{face, unprot} + f_{net} \\times p_{face, prot} $$\n$$ \\bar{p}_{face} = (0.70 \\times 0.15) + (0.30 \\times 0.075) = 0.105 + 0.0225 = 0.1275 $$\nNow, we can find the probability that a single risk event leads to Romana's sign, $P(Romana | \\text{risk})$. This is the product of the probabilities of the subsequent events in the causal chain: a facial bite, successful conjunctival contamination, successful infection, and presentation of Romana's sign.\n$$ P(Romana | \\text{risk}) = \\bar{p}_{face} \\times p_{conj} \\times p_{succ\\_inf} \\times p_{romana} $$\n$$ P(Romana | \\text{risk}) = 0.1275 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.60 = 0.0011475 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the expected number of Romana's sign cases**\nThe total expected number of cases is the product of the total number of risk events and the probability that any one of those events results in Romana's sign.\n$$ E[N_{Romana}] = N_{risk} \\times P(Romana | \\text{risk}) $$\n$$ E[N_{Romana}] = 5{,}103 \\times 0.0011475 = 5.8569925 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $5.86$.\nTherefore, the expected number of Romana's sign cases in the village over the $90$-night season is approximately $5.86$.",
