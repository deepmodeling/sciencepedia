            "problem": "A clinical parasitology laboratory is evaluating a stool-based detection algorithm for *Hymenolepis nana* (the dwarf tapeworm) in a patient who is known to be truly infected but has low-intensity, intermittently shed ova. Each daily stool specimen is examined using a formalin–ethyl acetate concentration technique (FEA) with a per-specimen sensitivity of $s=0.6$.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Topic**: *Hymenolepis nana* (the dwarf tapeworm) detection.\n- **Patient Status**: Known to be truly infected.\n- **Specimen Testing**: Daily stool specimens are tested.\n- **Test Method**: Formalin–ethyl acetate concentration technique (FEA).\n- **Per-specimen Sensitivity**: $s = 0.6$.\n- **Number of Specimens**: $n$ independent specimens.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1. The patient’s infection status is constant.\n    2. Test performance ($s$) is constant across days.\n    3. Day-to-day test results are independent conditional on true infection.\n- **Task 1**: Derive an expression for the overall probability of detecting at least one positive result after testing $n$ specimens, and then simplify it for $s=0.6$.\n- **Task 2**: Determine the smallest integer $n$ for which the overall probability from Task 1 is at least $0.95$.

The scenario of using repeated testing to increase the cumulative sensitivity for detecting an intermittently shed pathogen is a standard, practical concept. The given sensitivity value $s=0.6$ is realistic for microscopic examination of stool for parasites. The problem is based on fundamental principles of probability theory.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined. It provides all necessary information (sensitivity, independence assumption) and clearly specifies the quantities to be derived. A unique solution exists for both parts of the problem.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. Terms like \"sensitivity\" and \"independence\" have rigorous mathematical definitions, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a solution built from first principles of probability.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Detection Probability Expression**\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the patient is truly infected. The problem states this is a known condition, so all probabilities are implicitly conditional on $D$.\nLet $T_i$ be the event that the test on the $i$-th specimen yields a positive result, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe sensitivity of the test, $s$, is defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the patient is infected.\nTherefore, the probability of a single test being positive is:\n$$ P(T_i) = s $$\nThe problem asks for the probability of detecting **at least one** positive result after testing $n$ specimens. Let this event be $A_n$. This event can be expressed as the union of the individual positive test events:\n$$ A_n = T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup T_n $$\nCalculating the probability of a union of non-mutually exclusive events is complex. A more direct approach is to consider the complementary event, $A_n^c$, which is the event that **no** positive tests are obtained in $n$ trials. This means all $n$ tests are negative.\nLet $T_i^c$ be the event that the test on the $i$-th specimen is negative. The probability of a single test being negative is:\n$$ P(T_i^c) = 1 - P(T_i) = 1 - s $$\nThe event $A_n^c$ is the intersection of all individual negative test events:\n$$ A_n^c = T_1^c \\cap T_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap T_n^c $$\nThe problem states that the test results are independent. Therefore, the probability of the intersection of these events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P(A_n^c) = P(T_1^c) \\times P(T_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(T_n^c) $$\nSince the sensitivity $s$ is constant for all tests, $P(T_i^c)$ is also constant for all $i$.\n$$ P(A_n^c) = (1 - s)^n $$\nThe probability of the event of interest, $A_n$, is found using the law of complementary events:\n$$ P(A_n) = 1 - P(A_n^c) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A_n^c)$ gives the general algebraic expression for the overall probability of at least one detection:\n$$ P(A_n) = 1 - (1 - s)^n $$\nThis is the expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the given value of sensitivity, $s = 0.6$:\n$$ 1 - s = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\nThe simplified expression for the overall detection probability, which depends only on $n$, is:\n$$ P(A_n) = 1 - (0.4)^n $$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Minimum Number of Specimens ($n$)**\n\nThe second task is to find the smallest integer $n$ such that the overall detection probability is at least $0.95$. We must solve the following inequality for $n$:\n$$ P(A_n) \\ge 0.95 $$\nSubstituting the expression from Part 1:\n$$ 1 - (0.4)^n \\ge 0.95 $$\nThis is the exact inequality to be solved. We rearrange the terms to isolate the term containing $n$:\n$$ 1 - 0.95 \\ge (0.4)^n $$\n$$ 0.05 \\ge (0.4)^n $$\nTo solve for the exponent $n$, we apply the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) to both sides of the inequality. Since the logarithm function is strictly increasing for positive arguments, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln(0.05) \\ge \\ln((0.4)^n) $$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$:\n$$ \\ln(0.05) \\ge n \\ln(0.4) $$\nTo isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.4)$. It is critical to recognize that for any number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$, its logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is negative. Since $0.4 < 1$, $\\ln(0.4)$ is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.4)} \\le n $$\nOr, written more conventionally:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.4)} $$\nThis is the exact expression used to find the minimum value of $n$. We can evaluate this expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.4)} \\approx \\frac{-2.99573}{-0.91629} \\approx 3.2693 $$\nSo, the inequality is:\n$$ n \\ge 3.2693... $$\nSince $n$ must be an integer (representing the number of specimens tested), the smallest integer value that satisfies this condition is $n=4$.\n\nWe can verify this result:\nFor $n=3$, $P(A_3) = 1 - (0.4)^3 = 1 - 0.064 = 0.936$, which is less than $0.95$.\nFor $n=4$, $P(A_4) = 1 - (0.4)^4 = 1 - 0.0256 = 0.9744$, which is greater than $0.95$.\nThe smallest integer is indeed $n=4$.\n\nThe final answer requires the pair consisting of the simplified detection-probability expression as a function of $n$ and the minimal integer $n$. These are $1 - (0.4)^n$ and $4$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Case Presentation**: A child in a crowded daycare exhibits intermittent abdominal discomfort and weight loss.\n- **Laboratory Data**: Stool microscopy shows numerous embryonated eggs of *Hymenolepis nana*. Egg counts increase over several weeks.\n- **Exclusion Criteria**: No documented external re-exposure, no history of travel, no history of ingestion of arthropods.\n- **Clinical Hypothesis**: The clinician suspects internal autoinfection by *Hymenolepis nana*.\n- **Core Question**: Why is a similar mucosal autoinfection phenomenon not observed with *Taenia* species in human intestines?\n- **Provided Definitions/Principles**:\n    1.  The definitive host is where sexual maturity of a parasite occurs.\n    2.  The intermediate host is where required larval development of a parasite occurs.\n    3.  Larval stages exhibit tissue tropism shaped by host tissue cues.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of medical parasitology. The clinical presentation is classic for hymenolepiasis. The life cycle of *Hymenolepis nana*, including its unique ability to cause internal autoinfection (a direct life cycle within a single host), is a well-documented biological fact. The life cycles of *Taenia solium* and *Taenia saginata* are also standard knowledge. The comparison between the two genera regarding autoinfection pathogenesis is a valid and instructive exercise in parasitology. The definitions provided are correct and central to the discipline.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The question is specific and answerable. It asks for the biological reasons behind a known difference in the life cycles and pathologies of two types of cestodes. A clear, definitive explanation based on established biological mechanisms exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and clinical terminology. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides sufficient context—the case of *H. nana* autoinfection—to frame the comparative question about *Taenia* species. The provided definitions are consistent with the context and adequate for formulating an answer. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formed, scientifically sound question in medical parasitology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the question lies in the differing sites of larval development for *Hymenolepis nana* and *Taenia* species when eggs hatch within the human intestine.\n\n**Principle 1: Life Cycle of *Hymenolepis nana* (Internal Autoinfection)**\nThe phenomenon described in the problem—increasing egg counts without re-exposure—is due to internal autoinfection. The cycle is as follows:\n1.  An embryonated egg, passed by an adult worm in the intestine, hatches within the same host's small intestine.\n2.  The released hexacanth embryo, or oncosphere, actively penetrates one of the intestinal villi.\n3.  Within the tissue of the villus, the oncosphere undergoes mandatory larval development, transforming into a cysticercoid larva. This step is critical; the intestinal villus serves as a temporary \"intermediate host\" tissue.\n4.  After approximately $4$-$5$ days, the mature cysticercoid larva emerges from the villus back into the intestinal lumen.\n5.  The cysticercoid larva attaches to the intestinal wall and develops into a new, sexually mature adult tapeworm.\nThis complete cycle from egg to adult occurs within the intestine, leading to a multiplication of the adult worm burden. This is a true mucosal autoinfection that increases the number of intestinal parasites.\n\n**Principle 2: Life Cycle of *Taenia* species following Egg Ingestion**\nThe question pertains to *Taenia* species. We primarily consider *Taenia solium*, as its eggs are infective to humans, whereas *Taenia saginata* eggs are not.\n1.  If a human ingests embryonated eggs of *T. solium* (either from an external source or from their own infection, which is a form of autoinfection), the eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing oncospheres.\n2.  These oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the circulatory system (blood or lymph).\n3.  The oncospheres do not remain in the intestinal villi. Guided by tissue tropism, they migrate to various *extraintestinal* tissues, most commonly striated muscle, the brain, subcutaneous tissue, and the eyes.\n4.  In these extraintestinal sites, the oncospheres develop into larval cysts called cysticerci. This condition is known as cysticercosis.\n5.  Crucially, these cysticerci located in human tissues represent a developmental dead end. They cannot exit the tissue, re-enter the intestinal lumen, and mature into adult tapeworms in the same host. They cause tissue pathology but do not increase the adult worm burden in the intestine.\n\n**Conclusion of Principles**: The fundamental difference is the site of larval development and the subsequent fate of the larva. For *H. nana*, larval development occurs within the intestinal villus, allowing the larva to return to the lumen and become an adult. For *T. solium*, larval development occurs in extraintestinal tissues, from which the larva cannot return to the intestinal lumen to complete its life cycle.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. *Taenia* oncospheres require extraintestinal tissues, such as striated muscle, to differentiate into cysticerci; the intestinal villi do not provide the necessary developmental signals, so a mucosal autoinfection cycle cannot generate additional adult worms.**\nThis statement accurately captures the essence of tissue tropism as it applies to *Taenia*. The oncospheres are evolutionarily adapted to respond to developmental cues found in specific extraintestinal tissues of their intermediate host (e.g., pig muscle). The human intestinal villus lacks these specific signals required for the oncosphere-to-cysticercus transformation. Consequently, the mucosal cycle seen in *H. nana* cannot occur.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. *Taenia* species normally complete their larval development in an intermediate host tissue rather than in the intestinal mucosa of the definitive host; as a result, the human intestinal mucosa is not a permissive site for the larval stage that precedes adult maturation.**\nThis option correctly frames the situation in terms of definitive and intermediate hosts. For *Taenia*, the pig or cow is the normal intermediate host, and larval development occurs in their tissues. A human is the definitive host for the adult worm. The intestinal mucosa of the definitive host (human) is not biologically \"permissive\" for the larval development of *Taenia*. This contrasts with *H. nana*, where the definitive host's intestinal villus can function as the site for larval development.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. *Taenia* eggs cannot hatch in the human intestine, preventing any possibility of internal autoinfection.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The eggs of *Taenia solium* readily hatch in the human intestine upon ingestion. This hatching is the necessary first step for the development of human cysticercosis, which is a severe disease and a form of internal infection (though not one that increases adult worm count).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. When *Taenia solium* eggs hatch within a human host, the resulting oncospheres invade extraintestinal tissues to form cysticerci (cysticercosis) rather than completing a villus-to-lumen cycle; therefore, even internal autoinfection does not increase intestinal adult worm burden.**\nThis provides a precise and complete description of the pathogenesis following *T. solium* egg ingestion. It correctly identifies the pathway of the oncospheres (invasion into extraintestinal tissues), the resulting condition (cysticercosis), and the ultimate consequence (no increase in adult worm burden). This directly contrasts the outcome with that of *H. nana* autoinfection.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. *Hymenolepis nana* requires an arthropod intermediate host for its larval development, so its autoinfection is only possible when such arthropods are ingested, a process that *Taenia* spp. cannot replicate.**\nThis statement is misleading and fundamentally wrong in the context of the problem. While *H. nana* *can* have an indirect life cycle involving an arthropod (e.g., grain beetle), its primary clinical importance stems from its ability to use a *direct* cycle without any intermediate host. The problem specifically describes a scenario of internal autoinfection where arthropod ingestion is ruled out. Therefore, the premise that it \"requires\" an arthropod for autoinfection is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The reduction is therefore $p_0 - p_1$.\n\nLet $N$ be the total population size. The number of infected individuals at baseline is $p_0 N$. The number of uninfected individuals is $(1-p_0)N$.\n\nA fraction $c$ of the population is treated. Due to the assumption of random treatment allocation, the probability that any given individual is treated is $c$, irrespective of their infection status.\n\nWe can categorize the infected population based on treatment and outcome:\n1.  **Infected and Not Treated:** A fraction $p_0$ of the population is infected. A fraction $(1-c)$ of these individuals will not be treated. All individuals in this group remain infected. The fraction of the total population belonging to this group is $p_0(1-c)$.\n\n2.  **Infected and Treated:** A fraction $p_0$ of the population is infected. A fraction $c$ of these individuals will be treated. The fraction of the total population in this group is $p_0 c$.\n\nWithin the \"Infected and Treated\" group, there are two outcomes based on drug efficacy $e$:\n2a. **Infected, Treated, and Cured:** The probability of being cured, given one is infected and treated, is $e$. The fraction of the total population that falls into this category is $p_0 c e$. These individuals are no longer infected.\n2b. **Infected, Treated, and Not Cured (Treatment Failure):** The probability of not being cured, given one is infected and treated, is $(1-e)$. The fraction of the total population in this category is $p_0 c (1-e)$. These individuals remain infected.\n\nThe new prevalence, $p_1$, is the fraction of the total population that remains infected after the intervention. This is the sum of the fractions of the groups that are still infected. Based on our analysis, these are the \"Infected and Not Treated\" group and the \"Infected, Treated, and Not Cured\" group.\n\nTherefore, the new prevalence $p_1$ is given by:\n$$\np_1 = p_0(1-c) + p_0 c(1-e)\n$$\n\nWe can expand and simplify this expression:\n$$\np_1 = p_0 - p_0 c + p_0 c - p_0 c e\n$$\nThe terms $-p_0 c$ and $+p_0 c$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\np_1 = p_0 - p_0 c e\n$$\nThis expression can be factored as:\n$$\np_1 = p_0 (1 - c e)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected reduction in prevalence, which is the difference between the initial prevalence and the final prevalence, $p_0 - p_1$.\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Prevalence} = p_0 - p_1\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $p_1$:\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Prevalence} = p_0 - [p_0 (1 - c e)]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Prevalence} = p_0 - p_0 + p_0 c e\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Prevalence} = p_0 c e\n$$\nThis final expression represents the fraction of the total population that was initially infected and subsequently cured by the intervention.
