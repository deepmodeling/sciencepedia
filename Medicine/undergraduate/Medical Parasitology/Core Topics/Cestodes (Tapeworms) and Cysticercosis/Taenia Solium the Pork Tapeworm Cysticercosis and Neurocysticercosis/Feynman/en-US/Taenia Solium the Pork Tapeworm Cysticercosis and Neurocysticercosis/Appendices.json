            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard application of Bayesian decision theory to a classification problem with a sound biological basis.\n\nThe task is to determine an optimal decision rule for classifying a microscopic image of a gravid proglottid as either *Taenia solium* or *Taenia saginata* based on the count of lateral uterine branches, $x$. We are given a statistical model for this count and prior probabilities for each species. The goal is to compute the expected classification accuracy of the optimal rule.\n\nLet $S$ denote the event that the species is *Taenia solium* and $T$ denote the event that it is *Taenia saginata*. The observed count $x$ is a non-negative integer, $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\nThe prior probabilities of the two species are:\n$P(S) = \\pi_{s} = 0.4$\n$P(T) = \\pi_{t} = 0.6$\n\nThe conditional probability distributions (likelihoods) for the count $x$, given the species, are Poisson distributions:\nFor *T. solium*: $P(x|S) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{s}) \\lambda_{s}^{x}}{x!}$, with mean $\\lambda_{s} = 10$.\nFor *T. saginata*: $P(x|T) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{t}) \\lambda_{t}^{x}}{x!}$, with mean $\\lambda_{t} = 20$.\n\nThe Bayesian minimum error decision rule, for equal misclassification losses, is to assign the observation $x$ to the class with the highest posterior probability. We classify as species $S$ if $P(S|x) > P(T|x)$ and as species $T$ if $P(T|x) > P(S|x)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the posterior probabilities are $P(S|x) = \\frac{P(x|S)P(S)}{P(x)}$ and $P(T|x) = \\frac{P(x|T)P(T)}{P(x)}$. The decision rule $P(S|x) > P(T|x)$ is thus equivalent to comparing the numerators:\n$$ P(x|S)P(S) > P(x|T)P(T) $$\nSubstituting the given priors, this becomes:\n$$ P(x|S)\\pi_{s} > P(x|T)\\pi_{t} $$\nThis inequality can be rearranged into a likelihood ratio test:\n$$ \\frac{P(x|S)}{P(x|T)} > \\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}} $$\nWe now substitute the Poisson probability mass functions into this inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{s}) \\lambda_{s}^{x}}{x!}}{\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{t}) \\lambda_{t}^{x}}{x!}} > \\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}} $$\nThe $x!$ terms cancel, and we can group the exponential and power terms:\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda_{t} - \\lambda_{s}) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}}\\right)^{x} > \\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}} $$\nTo solve for $x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. The logarithmic function is monotonically increasing, so the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\exp(\\lambda_{t} - \\lambda_{s}) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}}\\right)^{x}\\right) > \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}}\\right) $$\n$$ (\\lambda_{t} - \\lambda_{s}) + x \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}}\\right) > \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}}\\right) $$\nWe isolate the term with $x$:\n$$ x \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}}\\right) > \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}}\\right) - (\\lambda_{t} - \\lambda_{s}) $$\nSince $\\lambda_{s} = 10$ and $\\lambda_{t} = 20$, the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}} = \\frac{10}{20} = 0.5$, which is less than $1$. Therefore, its natural logarithm, $\\ln(0.5)$, is negative. Dividing the inequality by this negative number reverses its direction:\n$$ x < \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}}\\right) - (\\lambda_{t} - \\lambda_{s})}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}}\\right)} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\lambda_{s}=10$, $\\lambda_{t}=20$, $\\pi_{s}=0.4$, and $\\pi_{t}=0.6$.\nThe ratios are $\\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{s}} = \\frac{0.6}{0.4} = 1.5$ and $\\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{\\lambda_{t}} = \\frac{10}{20} = 0.5$.\nThe critical value for $x$, which we denote $x_{c}$, is:\n$$ x_{c} = \\frac{\\ln(1.5) - (20 - 10)}{\\ln(0.5)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.5) - 10}{\\ln(0.5)} $$\nNumerically, $\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.405465$ and $\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.693147$.\n$$ x_{c} \\approx \\frac{0.405465 - 10}{-0.693147} = \\frac{-9.594535}{-0.693147} \\approx 13.8418 $$\nThe decision rule is to classify as *T. solium* if $x < 13.8418$ and as *T. saginata* if $x > 13.8418$. Since $x$ must be an integer, the optimal integer-based decision rule is to classify as *solium* if $x \\le 13$ and as *saginata* if $x \\ge 14$. Let the threshold be $k=13$.\nThe decision is to classify as *solium* if $x \\le 13$ and as *saginata* if $x > 13$.\n\nNext, we compute the expected classification accuracy, $A$, defined as:\n$$ A = \\pi_{s}\\,\\mathbb{P}(\\text{classify as solium} | \\text{solium}) + \\pi_{t}\\,\\mathbb{P}(\\text{classify as saginata} | \\text{saginata}) $$\nUsing our decision rule, this translates to:\n$$ A = \\pi_{s}\\,\\mathbb{P}(x \\le 13 | \\lambda_{s}=10) + \\pi_{t}\\,\\mathbb{P}(x > 13 | \\lambda_{t}=20) $$\nThese probabilities are calculated from the Poisson cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(k; \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^i}{i!}$.\nThe second term is $\\mathbb{P}(x > 13) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(x \\le 13)$.\nSo, the accuracy is:\n$$ A = \\pi_{s} F(13; \\lambda_{s}) + \\pi_{t} (1 - F(13; \\lambda_{t})) $$\nSubstituting the parameter values:\n$$ A = 0.4 \\times F(13; 10) + 0.6 \\times (1 - F(13; 20)) $$\nWe need to compute the values of the Poisson CDF.\nFor the first term, $F(13; 10)$:\n$\\mathbb{P}(x \\le 13 | \\lambda_{s}=10) \\approx 0.8644645$\nFor the second term, $F(13; 20)$:\n$\\mathbb{P}(x \\le 13 | \\lambda_{t}=20) \\approx 0.0661250$\nNow, substitute these numerical values into the expression for $A$:\n$$ A \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.8644645 + 0.6 \\times (1 - 0.0661250) $$\n$$ A \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.8644645 + 0.6 \\times 0.9338750 $$\n$$ A \\approx 0.3457858 + 0.5603250 $$\n$$ A \\approx 0.9061108 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ A \\approx 0.9061 $$",

            "problem": "A single viable parenchymal cyst caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium leads to neurocysticercosis when the cyst localizes within brain parenchyma. Antiparasitic therapy accelerates cyst death and clearance but can precipitate perilesional inflammation and transient breakthrough seizures, whereas observation avoids drug-induced inflammatory risk but accepts slower spontaneous resolution. Decision analysis chooses the strategy that minimizes expected loss of health-adjusted quality over a fixed horizon using the principle of expected utility, where expected disutility is computed as the probability-weighted sum of disutilities of possible outcomes. Assume a one-year horizon with no discounting and use Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) losses as disutilities.\n\nConsider two strategies: antiparasitic therapy and observation. Let a patient’s short-term risk preference be represented by a coefficient $\\lambda$ that multiplies only the disutility of immediate treatment-induced adverse inflammatory events (reflecting the patient’s aversion to short-term harm). Future seizure burdens, whether after therapy or observation, are not multiplied by $\\lambda$.\n\nUse the following scientifically plausible parameters for a single viable parenchymal cyst with baseline seizure control under antiepileptic drugs:\n\n- Probability of radiologic resolution by month $3$ with therapy: $p_{r} = 0.85$.\n- Probability of radiologic resolution within $1$ year under observation: $p_{n} = 0.55$.\n- Probability of a treatment-induced inflammatory episode causing transient breakthrough seizures with therapy: $p_{a} = 0.20$.\n- Utility weight on a day with seizures is $u_{s} = 0.50$ (baseline daily utility is $1$), so the QALY loss per seizure day is $1 - u_{s} = 0.50$.\n- For late outcomes over the remainder of the year:\n  - If therapy leads to early resolution, expected seizure days are $S_{\\text{T,res}} = 2$.\n  - If the cyst persists (whether under therapy or observation), expected seizure days are $S_{\\text{nonres}} = 8$.\n  - If observation leads to spontaneous resolution, expected seizure days are $S_{\\text{O,res}} = 4$.\n- A treatment-induced inflammatory episode produces an additional $S_{a} = 3$ seizure days concentrated in the short term.\n\nAssume that each seizure day’s QALY loss is spread uniformly over the year for calculation purposes.
