            "problem": "African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei is transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina). Consider a host–vector system where transmission follows mass-action contact between humans and tsetse flies. Let $m$ denote the ratio of vectors to humans (flies per human), $a$ the biting rate on humans per vector (bites per vector per day), $b$ the probability that a susceptible vector becomes infected given a bite on an infectious human, $c$ the probability that a bite by an infectious vector infects a susceptible human, $\\mu_v$ the per-capita mortality rate of vectors (per day), $\\tau$ the extrinsic incubation period in the vector (days), and $r$ the removal rate of infectious humans (per day), which captures recovery, treatment, or death. Assume that:\n- An infectious human remains infectious for an expected duration of $1/r$.\n- A single vector bites humans at rate $a$ per day, independently of other vectors, and there are $m$ vectors per human.\n- Each infectious bite from an infectious vector infects a human with probability $c$, and each bite on an infectious human infects a vector with probability $b$.\n- Vectors experience constant mortality at rate $\\mu_v$, so the probability a newly infected vector survives the extrinsic incubation period is $\\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau)$.\n- After completing the extrinsic incubation period, an infectious vector remains infectious until death, with expected duration $1/\\mu_v$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the concept of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary human infections produced by a single infectious human introduced into a wholly susceptible population, derive an expression for $R_0$ in terms of $m$, $a$, $b$, $c$, $\\mu_v$, $\\tau$, and $r$ by explicitly computing the expected number of infectious vectors generated by one infectious human and the expected number of human infections caused by one infectious vector, and then multiplying these expectations.\n\nNow, suppose the parameters take the following realistic values for a rural setting with moderate vector density and feeding frequency: $m = 8$ flies per human, $a = 0.25$ bites per vector per day, $b = 0.03$, $c = 0.10$, $\\mu_v = 0.06$ per day, $\\tau = 25$ days, and $r = 0.004$ per day.

Using your derived expression, determine the minimal $\\rho$ such that the post-intervention basic reproduction number satisfies $R_0  1$. Express $\\rho$ as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "To solve this problem, we first derive the expression for the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and then use this expression to calculate the minimal reduction factor, $\\rho$, needed to bring transmission below the threshold for epidemic growth.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$)**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the expected number of new human infections generated by a single initial infectious human in a fully susceptible population. We can calculate this by breaking down the transmission cycle into two parts: from human to vector, and from vector back to human.\n\n1.  **Infections from Human to Vector:**\n    An infectious human remains so for an average duration of $1/r$. During this period, they are bitten by tsetse flies. With $m$ vectors per human and a biting rate of $a$ per vector, the single infectious human is bitten at a rate of $m \\cdot a$ bites per day. The total number of bites on this human during their infectious period is $(m \\cdot a) \\times (1/r)$. Each of these bites has a probability $b$ of infecting the vector. So, the expected number of vectors that ingest an infectious blood meal is $\\frac{mab}{r}$. For these vectors to become capable of transmission, they must survive the extrinsic incubation period, $\\tau$. The probability of surviving this period is $\\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau)$. Thus, the total expected number of new infectious vectors generated by one infectious human is:\n    $$ N_{v \\leftarrow h} = \\frac{mab}{r} \\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau) $$\n\n2.  **Infections from Vector to Human:**\n    An infectious vector can transmit the parasite for the rest of its life. With a constant mortality rate $\\mu_v$, the expected infectious lifespan is $1/\\mu_v$. During this period, it bites humans at a rate of $a$. The total expected number of bites on humans by this single infectious vector is $a \\times (1/\\mu_v)$. Each bite has a probability $c$ of infecting a susceptible human. So, the expected number of new human infections generated by one infectious vector is:\n    $$ N_{h \\leftarrow v} = \\frac{ac}{\\mu_v} $$\n\n3.  **Combining for $R_0$:**\n    $R_0$ is the product of these two quantities, representing the full cycle from one human case back to the next generation of human cases:\n    $$ R_0 = N_{v \\leftarrow h} \\times N_{h \\leftarrow v} = \\left( \\frac{mab}{r} \\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau) \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{ac}{\\mu_v} \\right) $$\n    $$ R_0 = \\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu_v} \\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau) $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Minimal Reduction Factor ($\\rho$)**\n\nA control measure reduces the biting rate $a$ to $a' = (1-\\rho)a$. The new basic reproduction number, $R_0'$, is found by substituting $a'$ into the formula for $R_0$:\n$$ R_0' = \\frac{m ((1-\\rho)a)^2 b c}{r \\mu_v} \\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau) = (1-\\rho)^2 \\left( \\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu_v} \\exp(-\\mu_v \\tau) \\right) = (1-\\rho)^2 R_0 $$\nTo stop transmission, we need $R_0'  1$. The critical condition is $R_0' = 1$.\n$$ (1-\\rho)^2 R_0 = 1 \\implies 1-\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_0}} \\implies \\rho = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_0}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the baseline $R_0$ with the given parameters:\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{(8)(0.25)^2(0.03)(0.10)}{(0.004)(0.06)} \\exp(-(0.06)(25)) $$\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{0.0015}{0.00024} \\exp(-1.5) = 6.25 \\times \\exp(-1.5) \\approx 6.25 \\times 0.22313 \\approx 1.39456 $$\nNow we can calculate the required reduction $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.39456}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{1.180916} \\approx 1 - 0.84680 = 0.15320 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal reduction factor is $\\rho = 0.1532$.",

Assume constant ambient temperature so that the daily development accumulation equals the temperature surplus above threshold. Using this framework, derive the expression for the EIP $n$ as a function of temperature $T$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of the effect of temperature on the vectorial capacity ($C$) of tsetse flies for African trypanosomes, mediated through the extrinsic incubation period ($n$). The solution involves three primary steps: deriving the expression for $n$ as a function of temperature ($T$), calculating the ratio of vectorial capacities at two different temperatures, and computing the final numerical result.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the extrinsic incubation period, $n$, and the ambient temperature, $T$, based on the provided degree-day model. The model states that parasite development requires the accumulation of a fixed heat sum, $K$, in degree-days, above a minimum developmental threshold temperature, $T_{\\min}$. For a constant ambient temperature $T$, the number of degree-days accumulated per day is the surplus temperature, $(T - T_{\\min})$. This accumulation is assumed to happen only if $T  T_{\\min}$. The total heat sum accumulated over $n$ days is the product of the daily accumulation and the number of days. This leads to the equation:\n$$\nn \\cdot (T - T_{\\min}) = K\n$$\nSolving for $n$ as a function of $T$ yields the expression for the extrinsic incubation period:\n$$\nn(T) = \\frac{K}{T - T_{\\min}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $T  T_{\\min}$. If $T \\le T_{\\min}$, development does not proceed, and $n$ would be infinite. The inverse relationship shows that as temperature increases, the time required for parasite development decreases.\n\nSecond, we determine how this temperature-dependent EIP affects the vectorial capacity, $C$. The problem provides the Macdonald formulation for $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n}}{-\\ln(p)}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the number of vectors per host, $a$ is the daily biting rate, and $p$ is the daily survival probability of the vector. The problem specifies that $m$, $a$, and $p$ are constant across the temperatures being compared. The temperature dependence of $C$ therefore arises exclusively from $n(T)$. We can write $C$ as a function of $T$:\n$$\nC(T) = \\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n(T)}}{-\\ln(p)}\n$$\nWe need to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{C(T_2)}{C(T_1)}$ for two temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$. Substituting the expression for $C(T)$ into the ratio gives:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C(T_2)}{C(T_1)} = \\frac{\\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n(T_2)}}{-\\ln(p)}}{\\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n(T_1)}}{-\\ln(p)}}\n$$\nThe terms $m$, $a^2$, and $-\\ln(p)$ are constant and cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{p^{n(T_2)}}{p^{n(T_1)}} = p^{n(T_2) - n(T_1)}\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the numerical value of $R$ using the supplied parameters: $K = 140$ degree-days, $T_{\\min} = 18\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $p = 0.95$. The temperatures for comparison are $T_1 = 22\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $T_2 = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nWe first calculate the EIP, $n$, at each temperature.\nFor $T_1 = 22\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n$$\nn_1 = n(T_1) = \\frac{K}{T_1 - T_{\\min}} = \\frac{140}{22 - 18} = \\frac{140}{4} = 35 \\text{ days}\n$$\nFor $T_2 = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n$$\nn_2 = n(T_2) = \\frac{K}{T_2 - T_{\\min}} = \\frac{140}{28 - 18} = \\frac{140}{10} = 14 \\text{ days}\n$$\nThe increase in temperature from $22\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ reduces the EIP from $35$ days to $14$ days.\n\nNow, we substitute these values for $n_1$ and $n_2$ into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = p^{n_2 - n_1} = (0.95)^{14 - 35} = (0.95)^{-21}\n$$\nWe calculate the numerical value of this expression:\n$$\nR = (0.95)^{-21} \\approx 2.9363503\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $3$, so we round down.\n$$\nR \\approx 2.936\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ being significantly greater than $1$ indicates a substantial increase in transmission potential at the higher temperature, driven entirely by the shortening of the extrinsic incubation period.",

The probability that the test detects an infection, given the fly is infected, is the sensitivity, $s$.\nSince the specificity is approximately 1, we can ignore false positives.
