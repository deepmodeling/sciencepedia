            "problem": "A household is experiencing persistent enterobiasis caused by Enterobius vermicularis. Gravid female worms exhibit nocturnal oviposition at the perianal region. Use the following fundamental definitions and assumptions, which are standard in medical parasitology: (i) fecundity per oviposition event is the number of eggs released by a single gravid female during one nocturnal migration, denoted by $\\rho$, (ii) egg production events on different nights are independent and additive across individuals, and (iii) under steady-state infection pressure in the household, approximately $n$ gravid females reach the perianal region and oviposit each night across $T$ consecutive nights. It is well established that a gravid Enterobius vermicularis female produces on the order of $10^{4}$ eggs per oviposition.

The variables ($n$, $\\rho$, $T$) are explicitly defined, and the assumptions (additivity, steady state) are clearly stated. The objective is to derive a specific mathematical expression, which leads to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is formal, technical, and free of bias or subjective claims.\n- **Flaw Analysis**: The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic within a modeling context, well-structured, and non-trivial.

The assumption of additivity supports this direct multiplication.\n$$E_{night} = n \\times \\rho$$\n\nThe problem specifies a steady-state infection pressure over $T$ consecutive nights, meaning that the number of eggs deposited each night is considered constant. The total cumulative egg burden, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the eggs deposited over these $T$ nights.\n$$E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{T} E_{night}$$\nSince $E_{night}$ is constant for each of the $T$ nights, this summation simplifies to:\n$$E_{total} = T \\times E_{night}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{night}$, we obtain the general formula for the cumulative egg burden in terms of $n$, $\\rho$, and $T$:\n$$E_{total}(n, \\rho, T) = T \\cdot n \\cdot \\rho$$\nThis expression is derived from the first principles laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe next step is to specialize this general expression for the specific values provided.\nWe are given:\n- The time period is $T=7$ nights.\n- The fecundity is on the order of $10^4$ eggs, so we will use the value $\\rho = 10^4$ eggs/female/night.\n\nSubstituting these values into the general formula:\n$$E_{total} = 7 \\cdot n \\cdot 10^4$$\n\nTo provide the final answer as a simplified analytic expression in terms of $n$ only, we rearrange the terms:\n$$E_{total} = (7 \\times 10^4) n$$\nThe coefficient $7 \\times 10^4$ is equal to $70000$. The final expression for the total number of eggs produced over $7$ nights is:\n$$E_{total} = 70000n$$\nAs per the formatting guidelines for the final answer, the coefficient is best expressed in scientific notation.\n$$E_{total} = (7 \\times 10^4)n$$\nThis represents the total egg count as a function of the number of nightly ovipositing females.",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and diagnostic testing, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The provided values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are plausible for the described scenario involving *Enterobius vermicularis* detection.\n\nThe task is to derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) from first principles and then calculate its numerical value. The PPV is defined as the probability that an individual is truly infected given that their test result is positive.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $I$: The event that an individual is infected with *Enterobius vermicularis*.\n- $I^c$: The event that an individual is not infected.\n- $T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we formalize using probabilistic notation:\n1.  The prevalence of the infection, $P(I)$, is given as $0.05$.\n    $$P(I) = 0.05$$\n    From this, the probability of an individual not being infected is:\n    $$P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $S$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual is infected.\n    $$S = P(T^+ \\mid I) = 0.5$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual is not infected.\n    $$Sp = P(T^- \\mid I^c) = 0.98$$\n    From this, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual is not infected. This is the complement of specificity.\n    $$P(T^+ \\mid I^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid I^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as $P(I \\mid T^+)$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThis equation states that the PPV is the ratio of the probability of being infected and testing positive (a true positive) to the total probability of testing positive.\n\nWe must now express the numerator, $P(I \\cap T^+)$, and the denominator, $P(T^+)$, in terms of the given quantities: $P(I)$, $S$, and $Sp$.\n\nThe numerator, $P(I \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the infection and testing positive. From the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^+ \\mid I) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(I)}$, we can rearrange to find the joint probability:\n$$ P(I \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid I) \\cdot P(I) = S \\cdot P(I) $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  The individual is infected and tests positive (a true positive). The probability of this is $P(I \\cap T^+)$.\n2.  The individual is not infected and tests positive (a false positive). The probability of this is $P(I^c \\cap T^+)$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, $P(T^+)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(I \\cap T^+) + P(I^c \\cap T^+) $$\nWe have already found an expression for the first term: $P(I \\cap T^+) = S \\cdot P(I)$.\nFor the second term, $P(I^c \\cap T^+)$, we use the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+ \\mid I^c)$:\n$$ P(I^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid I^c) \\cdot P(I^c) = (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(I)) $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(T^+)$, we get:\n$$ P(T^+) = (S \\cdot P(I)) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(I))) $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator $P(I \\cap T^+)$ and the denominator $P(T^+)$ back into the formula for the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{S \\cdot P(I)}{S \\cdot P(I) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(I))} $$\nThis is the general formula for PPV, derived from first principles as required. This result is a specific application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula to calculate the PPV for this specific setting.\nGiven:\n- $P(I) = 0.05$\n- $S = 0.5$\n- $Sp = 0.98$\n\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.5) \\cdot (0.05)}{(0.5) \\cdot (0.05) + (1 - 0.98) \\cdot (1 - 0.05)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.025}{0.025 + (0.02) \\cdot (0.95)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.019} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.025}{0.044} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.56818181... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.5682 $$\nThis result indicates that in this low-prevalence setting, even with a positive test result, there is only a $56.82\\%$ chance that the individual is actually infected, a consequence of the low prevalence and moderate sensitivity.",
