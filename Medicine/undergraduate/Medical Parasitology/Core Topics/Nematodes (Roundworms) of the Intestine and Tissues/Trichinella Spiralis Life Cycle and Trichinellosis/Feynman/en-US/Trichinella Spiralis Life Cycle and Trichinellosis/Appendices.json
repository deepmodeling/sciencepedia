Consider the following stage-specific, per-larva survival probabilities, each defined as the conditional probability of progressing from one stage to the next within the same host: survival through gastric digestion in the stomach is $0.8$, successful establishment and maturation in the intestine is $0.5$, survival during hematogenous dissemination is $0.3$, and successful settlement and encystment in muscle is $0.6$. Assume that survival events at each stage are independent given arrival at that stage, and that a larva must traverse all stages in order.\n\nUsing foundational probability principles, including the multiplication rule for independent events and the definition of expected value for a Bernoulli outcome, derive from first principles the expected number of larvae that ultimately establish in muscle per single ingested larva.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of *Trichinella spiralis* larvae that establish in muscle, starting from a single ingested larva. This problem can be modeled as a sequence of probabilistic events, where the successful completion of the life cycle requires passing through several distinct stages.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Initial condition: A single ($1$) infective larva is ingested.\n- Stage 1 Probability ($P_S$): Survival through gastric digestion in the stomach is $0.8$.\n- Stage 2 Probability ($P_I$): Successful establishment and maturation in the intestine is $0.5$.\n- Stage 3 Probability ($P_H$): Survival during hematogenous dissemination is $0.3$.\n- Stage 4 Probability ($P_M$): Successful settlement and encystment in muscle is $0.6$.\n- Constraint 1: Survival events at each stage are independent given arrival at that stage.\n- Constraint 2: A larva must traverse all stages in order (stomach $\\rightarrow$ intestine $\\rightarrow$ circulation $\\rightarrow$ muscle).\n- Objective: Derive the expected number of larvae that establish in muscle per single ingested larva.\n- Output format: Express the final answer as an exact decimal.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, modeling a simplified but plausible biological process in medical parasitology. The stages of the *T. spiralis* life cycle are correctly identified. The use of conditional probabilities and the assumption of independence are standard modeling techniques in epidemiology and population dynamics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical probabilities and constraints to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free from contradictions or ambiguities. It is a straightforward application of probability theory, not trivial or pseudo-profound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us define the events and their probabilities:\n- Let $S$ be the event that the larva survives gastric digestion in the stomach. The problem provides $P(S) = 0.8$.\n- Let $I$ be the event that the larva establishes in the intestine, given it survived the stomach. The problem states this conditional probability as $P(I|S) = 0.5$.\n- Let $H$ be the event that the larva survives hematogenous dissemination, given it established in the intestine. This conditional probability is $P(H|I \\cap S) = 0.3$.\n- Let $M$ be the event that the larva encysts in muscle, given it survived dissemination. This conditional probability is $P(M|H \\cap I \\cap S) = 0.6$.\n\nFor a single larva to successfully establish in muscle, it must pass through all four stages sequentially. The probability of this compound event, which we will call $P_{success}$, is the probability of the intersection of all these events: $P(M \\cap H \\cap I \\cap S)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this for our sequence of four events:\n$$P(M \\cap H \\cap I \\cap S) = P(M | H \\cap I \\cap S) \\times P(H \\cap I \\cap S)$$\nWe can expand the second term again:\n$$P(H \\cap I \\cap S) = P(H | I \\cap S) \\times P(I \\cap S)$$\nAnd the second term of this result again:\n$$P(I \\cap S) = P(I | S) \\times P(S)$$\nSubstituting backwards, we get:\n$$P_{success} = P(M | H \\cap I \\cap S) \\times P(H | I \\cap S) \\times P(I | S) \\times P(S)$$\nThe problem statement gives these conditional probabilities assuming the larva has successfully reached the prior stage. This is precisely the structure given above. The independence is \"given arrival at that stage,\" which validates our chain of conditional probabilities.\n\nLet's use the given symbols for these probabilities:\n- $P(S) = P_S = 0.8$\n- $P(I|S) = P_I = 0.5$\n- $P(H|I \\cap S) = P_H = 0.3$\n- $P(M|H \\cap I \\cap S) = P_M = 0.6$\n\nTherefore, the total probability of a single ingested larva successfully encysting in muscle is the product of these probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = P_S \\times P_I \\times P_H \\times P_M$$\n\nNow, we must find the expected number of larvae that establish in muscle per single ingested larva. The outcome for a single larva is a binary event: it either successfully encysts (a success) or it does not (a failure). This is a Bernoulli trial.\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the number of larvae that successfully encyst from a single ingested larva. The possible values for $X$ are $1$ (success) and $0$ (failure).\nThe probability of success is $P(X=1) = P_{success}$.\nThe probability of failure is $P(X=0) = 1 - P_{success}$.\n\nThe expected value of a discrete random variable, $E[X]$, is defined as the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i} x_i P(X=x_i)$$\nFor our Bernoulli variable $X$, this becomes:\n$$E[X] = (1 \\times P(X=1)) + (0 \\times P(X=0))$$\n$$E[X] = 1 \\times P_{success} + 0 \\times (1 - P_{success})$$\n$$E[X] = P_{success}$$\n\nThus, the expected number of successfully established larvae per ingested larva is simply the overall probability of success, $P_{success}$.\n\nWe can now calculate this value by substituting the given probabilities:\n$$P_{success} = 0.8 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.6$$\nLet's compute the product:\n$$P_{success} = (0.8 \\times 0.5) \\times (0.3 \\times 0.6)$$\n$$P_{success} = 0.4 \\times 0.18$$\n$$P_{success} = 0.072$$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of larvae that ultimately establish in muscle per single ingested larva is $0.072$. This result is an exact decimal as requested.",

In many hosts, encysted larvae are rare and approximately independently distributed in muscle tissue, and the expected count in a sample is proportional to the mass examined. Assume a carcass has a true larval density of $0.5$ larvae per gram, and that the occurrence of larvae in disjoint muscle portions is independent with a constant spatial rate per gram.\n\nUsing the principles of rare independent event counting in space, model the number of larvae observed in a digested muscle sample of mass $m$ grams. From this model, derive the expression for the probability of failing to detect any larvae (that is, observing zero larvae) when examining the entire digest. Then, evaluate this probability for a single $1$ gram sample, and for a pooled composite of $100$ grams digested and examined as a single unit.\n\nReport both probabilities as decimals rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It describes a classic scenario for the application of a Poisson process.\n\nThe problem states that encysted larvae are rare, approximately independently distributed, and occur at a constant spatial rate per gram of muscle tissue. These are the defining assumptions for a Poisson process. Let the random variable $X$ represent the number of larvae observed in a muscle sample. The distribution of $X$ will follow a Poisson distribution.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\mu^k \\exp(-\\mu)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of events (larvae) observed, and $\\mu$ is the average number of events in the given interval or region. In this problem, the \"region\" is a mass of muscle tissue.\n\nThe problem provides the true larval density, which is the rate parameter of the spatial process. Let this density be $\\lambda$.\n$$\\lambda = 0.5 \\text{ larvae/gram}$$\nThe expected count $\\mu$ in a sample of mass $m$ grams is proportional to the mass, as stated. The constant of proportionality is the density $\\lambda$.\n$$\\mu = \\lambda m$$\nSubstituting the given value of $\\lambda$:\n$$\\mu = 0.5m$$\n\nThe model for the number of larvae $k$ observed in a digested muscle sample of mass $m$ is therefore a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\mu = 0.5m$:\n$$P(X=k | m) = \\frac{(0.5m)^k \\exp(-0.5m)}{k!}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the probability of failing to detect any larvae, which corresponds to observing zero larvae ($k=0$).\n$$P(X=0 | m) = \\frac{(0.5m)^0 \\exp(-0.5m)}{0!}$$\nBy mathematical definition, for any non-zero number $a$, $a^0 = 1$, and the factorial of zero is $0! = 1$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0 | m) = \\exp(-0.5m)$$\nThis is the general expression for the probability of observing zero larvae in a sample of mass $m$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this probability for the two specified cases.\n\nCase 1: A single $1$ gram sample.\nFor this case, the mass $m = 1$ gram. The probability of observing zero larvae, let's call it $P_1$, is:\n$$P_1 = P(X=0 | m=1) = \\exp(-0.5 \\times 1) = \\exp(-0.5)$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$P_1 \\approx 0.6065306597$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_1 \\approx 0.6065$$\n\nCase 2: A pooled composite of $100$ grams digested and examined as a single unit.\nFor this case, the mass $m = 100$ grams. The probability of observing zero larvae, let's call it $P_{100}$, is:\n$$P_{100} = P(X=0 | m=100) = \\exp(-0.5 \\times 100) = \\exp(-50)$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$P_{100} \\approx 1.928749847 \\times 10^{-22}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{100} \\approx 1.929 \\times 10^{-22}$$\n\nThe two required probabilities are approximately $0.6065$ for the $1$ gram sample and $1.929 \\times 10^{-22}$ for the $100$ gram sample.

Trichinella spiralis is a nematode whose infective larvae in meat are rendered nonviable when the geometric core reaches a sufficiently high temperature. Consumer guidance historically uses a core temperature of $71\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ as a conservative safety threshold for inactivation. You must derive and implement a program that, given cut thickness, predicts the minimum cooking time required for the center of a boneless, homogeneous cut to first reach $71\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ under a controlled heating scenario.\n\nBase your derivation on the one-dimensional transient heat diffusion equation in a slab geometry, which is a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) valid for homogeneous, isotropic media with constant thermal properties and no internal heat generation. Let the slab have full thickness $L$, spatial coordinate $x \\in [-L/2,L/2]$ (with $x=0$ at the center), thermal diffusivity $ \\alpha $, initial uniform temperature $T_0$, and both surfaces maintained at a constant temperature $T_s$ for $t>0$.

Treat the safety condition as satisfied at the first instant the center reaches $T_{\\mathrm{safe}}$; no additional hold time is required in this model.\n\nYour program must implement a numerically stable and convergent method to compute $t_{\\mathrm{safe}}(L)$ from the PDE model.

We assume a solution of the form $\\theta(x,t) = X(x)\\tau(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE and separating variables, we obtain two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where $-k^2$ is the separation constant:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\alpha\\tau}\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -k^2 $$\n1. Time-dependent ODE: $\\dfrac{d\\tau}{dt} = -\\alpha k^2 \\tau$, which has the solution $\\tau(t) = C e^{-\\alpha k^2 t}$.\n2. Space-dependent ODE: $\\dfrac{d^2X}{dx^2} + k^2 X = 0$, which has the general solution $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $\\theta(\\pm L/2, t) = 0$ to $X(x)$ implies $X(\\pm L/2) = 0$.\nThe problem is symmetric about $x=0$, as the geometry, initial condition, and boundary conditions are all symmetric. The solution must therefore be an even function of $x$, which implies that the coefficients of the sine terms must be zero ($B=0$). The solution form is $X(x) = A \\cos(kx)$.\nThe boundary condition $X(L/2)=0$ then requires $A \\cos(kL/2) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\cos(kL/2) = 0$. This occurs when the argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$:\n$$ \\frac{k_n L}{2} = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2} \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThis defines the eigenvalues $k_n$:\n$$ k_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{L} $$\nThe solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is a superposition of all possible modes:\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos(k_n x) e^{-\\alpha k_n^2 t} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi x}{L}\\right) e^{-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t} $$\nThe coefficients $A_n$ are determined by the initial condition $\\theta(x,0) = 1$. This requires expanding the constant function $f(x)=1$ as a Fourier series in terms of the eigenfunctions $\\cos(k_n x)$:\n$$ 1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nUsing the orthogonality of the cosine functions over the interval $[-L/2, L/2]$, the coefficients are calculated as:\n$$ A_n = \\frac{\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} 1 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx}{\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx} = \\frac{\\frac{2L}{(2n-1)\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)}{L/2} = \\frac{4(-1)^{n-1}}{(2n-1)\\pi} $$\nSubstituting $A_n$ back into the series gives the full analytical solution for the dimensionless temperature.

We can truncate the series after a small number of terms ($N \\approx 10$ is sufficient for high accuracy, though a larger number like $N=50$ provides a robust margin) and solve the resulting equation numerically. Since the right-hand side is a monotonically decreasing function of $t$, a unique root for $t_{\\mathrm{safe}}$ is guaranteed. A robust bracketing root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method, is an appropriate and efficient tool for this task. The final implementation will use this analytical series solution and a numerical root-finder to compute $t_{\\mathrm{safe}}$ for each given thickness $L$.",
