            "problem": "A district is experiencing endemic transmission of a soil-transmitted helminth. The basic reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single typical infection in a fully susceptible population under the prevailing contact structure, is estimated to be $R_{0}=2.5$. The health authority plans a Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign using a single-dose anthelminthic that, when taken, reduces an individual’s contribution to onward transmission by an efficacy $e=0.9$ during the period of interest. Assume homogeneous mixing, absence of acquired immunity, and that treatment acts by proportionally reducing the per-contact transmission potential of treated individuals without altering the contact structure. \n\nUsing the definition of the effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ as the average number of secondary cases in the presence of the intervention, and appropriate aggregation over treated and untreated subpopulations, determine the minimum coverage $c$ (expressed as a decimal fraction) required such that $R_{e}1$. Round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum coverage $c$ of a Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign required to reduce the effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ below $1$. The problem provides the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$, which is the expected number of secondary cases from a single infection in a completely susceptible population, and the efficacy $e$ of the anthelminthic drug, which reduces an individual's contribution to transmission.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the relationship between the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ and the effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ under the intervention. The population is divided into two subgroups: a fraction $c$ that is treated and a fraction $(1-c)$ that is untreated. The problem states to assume homogeneous mixing, which means that an infectious individual is equally likely to contact any other individual in the population, regardless of their treatment status.\n\nThe effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ is the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual in this mixed population. A typical infectious individual has a probability $c$ of being in the treated group and a probability $(1-c)$ of being in the untreated group.\n\nAn infectious individual from the untreated group will, on average, cause $R_{0}$ secondary infections.\nAn infectious individual from the treated group has their contribution to onward transmission reduced by the drug's efficacy $e$. Thus, their transmission potential is reduced by a factor of $e$, and they contribute $(1-e)$ of what an untreated individual would. Therefore, an infectious individual from the treated group will, on average, cause $R_{0}(1-e)$ secondary infections.\n\n$R_{e}$ is the weighted average of the contributions from these two types of infectious individuals, weighted by their respective proportions in the population:\n$$R_{e} = (1-c) \\cdot R_{0} + c \\cdot \\left[R_{0}(1-e)\\right]$$\nThis expression represents the aggregation over the treated and untreated subpopulations, as specified in the problem statement. We can simplify this expression by factoring out $R_{0}$:\n$$R_{e} = R_{0} \\left[ (1-c) + c(1-e) \\right]$$\n$$R_{e} = R_{0} [1 - c + c - ce]$$\n$$R_{e} = R_{0}(1 - ce)$$\nThis is the standard formula for an intervention that reduces the infectiousness of a proportion $c$ of the population with efficacy $e$.\n\nThe goal of the public health authority is to stop the endemic transmission, which requires reducing the effective reproduction number to below $1$. The condition is:\n$$R_{e}  1$$\nSubstituting our expression for $R_{e}$ into this inequality gives:\n$$R_{0}(1 - ce)  1$$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for the coverage $c$. Since $R_{0}=2.5  0$, we can divide by $R_{0}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$1 - ce  \\frac{1}{R_{0}}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $c$:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}}  ce$$\nSince the efficacy $e=0.9  0$, we can divide by $e$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$c  \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}}}{e}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$c  \\frac{\\frac{R_{0}-1}{R_{0}}}{e} = \\frac{R_{0}-1}{eR_{0}}$$\nThis inequality gives the condition on the coverage $c$ required to ensure $R_{e}  1$. The minimum coverage required is the value at the boundary of this condition. Let's denote this minimum or critical coverage as $c_{min}$.\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{R_{0}-1}{eR_{0}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $R_{0}=2.5$ and $e=0.9$.\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{2.5 - 1}{0.9 \\times 2.5}$$\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1.5}{2.25}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express it as a ratio of integers:\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1.50}{2.25} = \\frac{150}{225}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $75$:\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{2 \\times 75}{3 \\times 75} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$c_{min} \\approx 0.6667$$\nThis means a minimum coverage of approximately $66.67\\%$ is required to bring the effective reproduction number below $1$ and interrupt transmission.",

            "problem": "A national control program is considering Mass Drug Administration (MDA) for an asexual haploid blood-stage parasite with a single locus and two alleles: a drug-resistant allele $\\mathrm{R}$ and a susceptible allele $\\mathrm{S}$. Under sustained drug pressure during MDA, the relative fitness of $\\mathrm{R}$ is modeled as $w_{\\mathrm{R}}=1+s$ and that of $\\mathrm{S}$ as $w_{\\mathrm{S}}=1$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient capturing the net advantage of resistance across treated and untreated hosts. Assume discrete, non-overlapping generations, random mixing, constant selection, and negligible mutation, migration, and genetic drift over the time horizon considered.\n\nAt the start of the MDA campaign, the resistant allele frequency is $p_0=0.01$. The selection coefficient under the contemplated regimen is $s=0.10$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of relative fitness, mean fitness, and frequency updates by proportional weighting (that is, update next-generation allele frequencies by weighting by relative fitness and renormalizing by the mean fitness), derive the next-generation resistant allele frequency $p_1$ from $p_0$ and $s$ and then compute the expected absolute change in resistant allele frequency after $1$ generation, $\\Delta p = p_1 - p_0$, under the given parameters.

            "solution": "### Derivation and Calculation\nThe problem requires deriving the next-generation allele frequency using foundational principles. Let $p_t$ be the frequency of the resistant allele $\\mathrm{R}$ in generation $t$, and $q_t$ be the frequency of the susceptible allele $\\mathrm{S}$. Since there are only two alleles, $p_t + q_t = 1$.\n\nThe relative fitness values are given as $w_{\\mathrm{R}} = 1+s$ and $w_{\\mathrm{S}} = 1$.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average of the allelic fitnesses, weighted by their frequencies:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p_t w_{\\mathrm{R}} + q_t w_{\\mathrm{S}}\n$$\nSubstituting $q_t = 1 - p_t$ and the given fitness values:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p_t (1+s) + (1-p_t)(1) = p_t + s p_t + 1 - p_t = 1 + s p_t\n$$\nThe frequency of an allele in the next generation is its proportional contribution to the gene pool of that generation. This is found by taking the frequency of the allele in the current generation, multiplying by its relative fitness, and then normalizing by the mean fitness of the population. For the resistant allele $\\mathrm{R}$, its frequency in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is:\n$$\np_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t w_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $\\bar{w}$:\n$$\np_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t(1+s)}{1+s p_t}\n$$\nThis is the general recurrence relation for the frequency of the resistant allele under this model.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific one-generation step from $t=0$ to $t=1$. The frequency $p_1$ is derived from $p_0$ as:\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{p_0(1+s)}{1+s p_0}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the absolute change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p$, which is defined as $\\Delta p = p_1 - p_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p_0(1+s)}{1+s p_0} - p_0\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p_0(1+s) - p_0(1+s p_0)}{1+s p_0}\n$$\nFactor out $p_0$ from the numerator:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p_0[(1+s) - (1+s p_0)]}{1+s p_0}\n$$\nSimplify the expression within the brackets in the numerator:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p_0[1+s - 1 - s p_0]}{1+s p_0} = \\frac{p_0(s - s p_0)}{1+s p_0}\n$$\nFactor out $s$ from the term in parentheses:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{s p_0 (1-p_0)}{1+s p_0}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the one-generation change in allele frequency. Now, we substitute the given numerical values: $p_0 = 0.01$ and $s = 0.10$.\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{(0.10)(0.01)(1-0.01)}{1+(0.10)(0.01)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{(0.10)(0.01)(0.99)}{1+0.001}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{0.00099}{1.001}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx 0.000989010989...\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.0009890$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a brief explanation of the implications of this result. A $\\Delta p$ of approximately $0.0009890$ means the frequency of the resistant allele increases by nearly $0.1$ percentage points in a single parasite generation. For many parasites, generation times are short, so this indicates a rapid selection for resistance under the specified drug pressure. This rapid increase has significant implications for control program design:\n1.  **Drug Rotation**: The fast rise of resistance against the current drug implies its useful lifespan is limited. A strategy of rotating to a different class of drug after a certain period may be necessary to manage the spread of resistance.\n2.  **Combination Therapy**: The strong selective advantage of the single resistance allele highlights the vulnerability of monotherapy. Using two or more drugs with different mechanisms of action simultaneously (combination therapy) makes it exponentially more difficult for a parasite to evolve resistance, as it would need to acquire multiple, independent resistance mutations. This result provides a quantitative argument in favor of deploying combination therapies from the outset.\n3.  **Refugia**: The speed of selection underscores the importance of refugia—a subpopulation of parasites not exposed to the drug. These parasites, being predominantly drug-susceptible, slow the overall increase in resistance frequency in the total parasite population by competing with and diluting the resistant parasites. The calculated rate of change helps quantify how quickly resistance would spread in the absence of such refugia, informing policies on the extent of MDA coverage (e.g., targeted vs. universal treatment) to balance therapeutic benefit with resistance management.",
