This exercise challenges that assumption by introducing the concept of saturation, reflecting that host defensive behaviors can limit the number of successful bites. By applying a more realistic Holling type II functional response, you will calculate the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) and see firsthand how non-linearity can alter predictions of disease exposure .",

            "problem": "A malaria-endemic village is monitored to quantify the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is defined as the rate of infectious bites received per host per unit time. In the absence of host defensive saturation, the baseline model assumes a linear relationship: the attempted biting rate per mosquito is $a$ (in bites per mosquito per day), the mosquito-to-human ratio is $m$ (mosquitoes per host), and the fraction of mosquitoes that are infectious is $i_{v}$ (dimensionless). Under this linear assumption, the successful biting rate per host equals the attempted rate $a m$, and infectious bites occur at rate $i_{v}$ times the successful biting rate. However, field observations indicate that human defensive behavior (e.g., swatting and avoidance) saturates as mosquito pressure increases. Assume this saturation can be described by a Holling type II functional response: the successful biting rate per host is the attempted rate moderated by a handling time parameter $\\alpha$ (with units of days per bite), so that increasing $a m$ leads to a saturating rather than linear increase in successful bite rate. Using only these definitions and the Holling type II assumption, derive the expression for the EIR under defensive saturation, compute its numerical value, and compare it to the linear case via the fold reduction factor $r$, defined as the ratio of the saturated EIR to the linear EIR.\n\nUse the following parameter values representative of a high-transmission setting:\n- Attempted biting rate per mosquito per day: $a = 0.3$,\n- Mosquito-to-human ratio: $m = 10$,\n- Fraction infectious among mosquitoes: $i_{v} = 0.05$,\n- Defensive handling time: $\\alpha = 0.1$ days per bite.\n\nReport the saturated EIR and the linear EIR in units of infectious bites per host per day, but for the final answer report only the fold reduction factor $r$ as a pure decimal (dimensionless). Round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is the product of the successful biting rate per host and the fraction of bites that are infectious. By definition, if $i_{v}$ is the fraction of mosquitoes that are infectious (dimensionless), then the rate of infectious bites per host per unit time is\n$$\n\\text{EIR} = (\\text{successful bites per host per day}) \\times i_{v}.\n$$\nUnder the linear model (no defensive saturation), the successful biting rate per host equals the attempted biting rate $a m$, because each mosquito attempts bites at rate $a$ and there are $m$ mosquitoes per host. Therefore, the linear EIR is\n$$\n\\text{EIR}_{\\text{lin}} = a m \\, i_{v}.\n$$\n\nUnder host defensive saturation modeled by a Holling type II functional response, the successful biting rate per host is a saturating function of the attempted rate $a m$. The standard Holling type II form arises from the assumption that each successful bite requires a handling or engagement time $\\alpha$ (with units of days per bite), which limits the throughput of successful bites as the attempt rate increases. The canonical form for the processed rate given an attempt rate $x$ is $x/(1+\\alpha x)$; here $x = a m$. Dimensional analysis confirms that $\\alpha a m$ is dimensionless because $\\alpha$ has units days per bite and $a m$ has units bites per day. Thus, the successful biting rate per host under saturation is\n$$\n\\frac{a m}{1 + \\alpha a m}.\n$$\nMultiplying by $i_{v}$ gives the saturated EIR,\n$$\n\\text{EIR}_{\\text{sat}} = \\frac{a m}{1 + \\alpha a m} \\, i_{v}.\n$$\n\nThe fold reduction factor $r$ comparing the saturated to the linear case is\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\text{EIR}_{\\text{sat}}}{\\text{EIR}_{\\text{lin}}}\n= \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{a m}{1 + \\alpha a m}\\right) i_{v}}{a m \\, i_{v}}\n= \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha a m}.\n$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless.\n\nNow substitute the given numerical values $a = 0.3$, $m = 10$, $i_{v} = 0.05$, and $\\alpha = 0.1$. First compute the attempted biting rate per host per day:\n$$\na m = 0.3 \\times 10 = 3.\n$$\nCompute the linear EIR:\n$$\n\\text{EIR}_{\\text{lin}} = a m \\, i_{v} = 3 \\times 0.05 = 0.15.\n$$\nCompute the saturated EIR:\n$$\n\\text{EIR}_{\\text{sat}} = \\frac{3}{1 + 0.1 \\times 3} \\times 0.05 = \\frac{3}{1.3} \\times 0.05 \\approx 2.3077 \\times 0.05 \\approx 0.1154.\n$$\nFinally, compute the fold reduction factor:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{1 + (0.1)(3)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.3} = \\frac{1}{1.3} \\approx 0.76923077.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the fold reduction factor is $0.7692$.\n\nThe saturated and linear EIR values, for completeness and unit context, are approximately $0.1154$ infectious bites per host per day and $0.15$ infectious bites per host per day, respectively.

Consider a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) framework in which infected hosts recover at per capita rate $\\gamma$ and become susceptible again, and transmission occurs through effective host contacts. The force of infection is the per susceptible rate at which new infections occur and is denoted by $\\lambda(i)$. Two biologically motivated incidence forms are considered:\n\n1) Linear mass-action incidence: $\\lambda(i) = \\beta i$, representing non-saturating effective contacts.\n\n2) Saturating incidence: $\\lambda(i) = \\dfrac{\\beta i}{1 + \\alpha i}$, representing behavioral or time constraints that limit effective contacts as prevalence grows, with $\\alpha > 0$ quantifying saturation strength.\n\nAssume all parameters are positive constants.
