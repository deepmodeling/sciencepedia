            "problem": "Two valid species-group names were established in different genera with the same specific epithet: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ by Author A in year $y_{1} = 1860$, and $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ by Author B in year $y_{2} = 1875$. In year $t = 1900$, new evidence showed that the species described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ is congeneric with $\\textit{Taenia}$, and the former was accordingly transferred, creating the new combination $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$).

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the application of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a foundational framework in biology, including medical parasitology. The scenario is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided and are internally consistent. The problem will be solved by applying the principles defined by the ICZN.\n\nThe core principles of the ICZN relevant to this problem are:\n$1$. **Binomial Nomenclature**: The scientific name of a species is a combination of two names: the generic name (genus) and the specific epithet.\n$2$. **The Principle of Priority**: The valid name for a taxon is the oldest available name applied to it.\n$3$. **The Principle of Homonymy**: Any one name, in its particular spelling, may be used for only one taxon within a particular nomenclatural rank. Among two or more identical names for different taxa, only the senior one (the one published earliest) is valid.\n\nFirst, we must establish whether a homonymy arises and classify it.\nA homonymy occurs when two or more species-group taxa bear the same specific epithet and are placed in the same genus. We are given two species-group names:\n- Name $1$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$, established by Author A in year $y_{1} = 1860$.\n- Name $2$: $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$, established by Author B in year $y_{2} = 1875$.\n\nAt the time of their establishment, these two names were in different genera, $\\textit{Taenia}$ and $\\textit{Cysticercus}$. Therefore, in the years from $y_{1}=1860$ to $t=1900$, they were not homonyms, as their full binomial names, $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ and $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$, are different.\n\nIn year $t = 1900$, the species originally described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ was transferred to the genus $\\textit{Taenia}$. This action created the new combination $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). At this point, two distinct taxa are referred to by the identical binomial name $\\textit{Taenia minor}$:\n- Taxon $1$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A, $1860$)\n- Taxon $2$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$)\n\nThis constitutes a homonymy. The ICZN distinguishes between two types of homonymy:\n- **Primary homonymy**: Exists when two identical species-group names are established in the same original genus.\n- **Secondary homonymy**: Exists when two identical species-group names, originally established in different genera, are subsequently placed in the same genus.\n\nIn this case, the homonymy was not present at the time of original publication but arose only upon the transfer of one species into the genus of the other. Therefore, this is a case of **secondary homonymy**.\n\nSecond, we must identify the senior and junior homonyms.\nThe Principle of Priority dictates that the validity and seniority of a name are determined by its date of publication. The dates of publication for the specific epithets are retained, even when they are transferred to a new genus.\n- The name $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A) was published in $y_{1} = 1860$.\n- The name $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ (Author B) was published in $y_{2} = 1875$.\n\nSince $y_{1} < y_{2}$ (i.e., $1860 < 1875$), the name established by Author A is the older one.\n- **Senior homonym**: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A, $1860$). This name is valid.\n- **Junior homonym**: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). This name is invalid according to the Principle of Homonymy.\n\nThe junior homonym must be rejected and replaced to avoid confusion and ensure that each taxon has a unique name. Thus, a new replacement name (`nomen novum`) is required for the species originally described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ by Author B in $1875$.\n\nThird, we will argue for the appropriateness of the replacement name.\nThe proposed replacement name is $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$ (Author C, $1902$). This is an appropriate solution for the following reasons:\n- It resolves the homonymy by providing a new, unique specific epithet, `parvulus`, for the junior homonym. The resulting binomial name, $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$, is distinct from the senior homonym, $\\textit{Taenia minor}$.\n- The authorship of the replacement name is correctly attributed to its proposer, Author C, and its date is the date of its publication, $r = 1902$.\n- A crucial aspect of a `nomen novum` is that it is a new name for a pre-existing taxon; it does not represent a new taxonomic discovery. Therefore, the name-bearing type of the replacement name is, by definition, the same as the name-bearing type of the name it replaces. In this instance, the type specimen(s) for $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$ (Author C, $1902$) are the same as those designated for the original name, $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). This maintains nomenclatural stability and links the new name to the original biological entity.\n\nFinally, we compute the priority margin $\\Delta$.\nThe priority margin is defined as the difference in the publication years of the two specific epithets.\n$$ \\Delta = y_{2} - y_{1} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ y_{1} = 1860 $$\n$$ y_{2} = 1875 $$\nThe calculation is:\n$$ \\Delta = 1875 - 1860 = 15 $$\nThe priority margin is $15$ years.",

The dataset includes the type genus Leishmania, a Latinized genus-group name honoring William Boog Leishman.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Type genus: $Leishmania$.\n- Nature of the name: A Latinized genus-group name.\n- Principle for forming family-group names (family, subfamily, tribe): Append rank-specific suffixes to the stem of the type genus.\n- Rule for stem determination: The stem is found from the genitive singular form of the genus-group name by removing the genitive ending.\n- Specific rule for genitive formation: For names ending in $-ia$, the genitive is $-iae$.\n- Suffixes for ranks: $-idae$ for family, $-inae$ for subfamily, and $-ini$ for tribe.\n- Definition of the function $L(\\cdot)$: The number of alphabetic characters in a name.\n- Quantity to compute: $S = L(\\text{family name}) + L(\\text{subfamily name}) + L(\\text{tribe name})$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It is based on the formal rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), which governs the naming of animals, including protozoan parasites. The principles cited for forming family-group names from the stem of a type genus, the use of the genitive case, and the standard suffixes are all correct representations of ICZN articles. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear, self-contained set of rules and a defined objective, leading to a unique, deterministic solution. The language is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is a formalizable_task directly relevant to the field of taxonomy.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution can be constructed by applying the given rules sequentially.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the nomenclatural rules provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Determine the stem of the type genus, $Leishmania$.**\n    The process begins with the nominative singular form of the type genus, which is given as $Leishmania$.\n    According to the provided rules, for a genus-group name ending in $-ia$, the genitive singular is formed by changing the ending to $-iae$.\n    Therefore, the genitive singular of $Leishmania$ is $Leishmaniae$.\n    The stem is obtained by removing the genitive ending from the genitive singular form. The genitive singular ending for a first-declension Latin noun is $-ae$.\n    Removing the ending $-ae$ from $Leishmaniae$ yields the stem.\n    Stem = $Leishmaniae - ae = Leishmani$.\n    The stem of the genus $Leishmania$ is thus $Leishmani$.\n\n2.  **Form the family-group names.**\n    The names for the family, subfamily, and tribe are formed by adding the appropriate rank-specific suffix to the stem $Leishmani$.\n    -   **Family Name:** The suffix for the family rank is $-idae$.\n        Family name = Stem + $-idae$ = $Leishmani + idae = Leishmaniidae$.\n    -   **Subfamily Name:** The suffix for the subfamily rank is $-inae$.\n        Subfamily name = Stem + $-inae$ = $Leishmani + inae = Leishmaniinae$.\n    -   **Tribe Name:** The suffix for the tribe rank is $-ini$.\n        Tribe name = Stem + $-ini$ = $Leishmani + ini = Leishmaniini$.\n\n3.  **Compute the number of characters for each name.**\n    The function $L(\\cdot)$ counts the number of alphabetic characters in each name.\n    -   $L(\\text{family name}) = L(Leishmaniidae)$. The name $Leishmaniidae$ has $13$ characters.\n    -   $L(\\text{subfamily name}) = L(Leishmaniinae)$. The name $Leishmaniinae$ has $13$ characters.\n    -   $L(\\text{tribe name}) = L(Leishmaniini)$. The name $Leishmaniini$ has $12$ characters.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final sum $S$.**\n    The problem asks for the sum of the character counts of the three names.\n    $$S = L(Leishmaniidae) + L(Leishmaniinae) + L(Leishmaniini)$$\n    Substituting the character counts:\n    $$S = 13 + 13 + 12$$\n    $$S = 38$$\nThe final value of $S$ is $38$.",

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, task in computational taxonomy based on established principles of DNA barcoding and classification theory. The givens and assumptions are internally consistent and sufficient to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe task consists of two parts: first, to calculate a species-delimitation threshold based on a naive midpoint rule, and second, to provide a qualitative explanation of how this threshold choice affects misclassification error rates under a set of simplifying assumptions.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\text{intra}}$ represent the mean intraspecific Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distance and $\\mu_{\\text{inter}}$ represent the mean interspecific K2P distance.\nThe given values are:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{intra}} = 1.2\\%\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{inter}} = 8.5\\%\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Species-Delimitation Threshold**\n\nThe problem specifies that the naive threshold, denoted as $t$, is the midpoint between the two empirical means, $\\mu_{\\text{intra}}$ and $\\mu_{\\text{inter}}$.

To convert a percentage to a decimal fraction, we divide by $100$.\n$$\nt_{\\text{decimal}} = \\frac{4.85}{100} = 0.0485\n$$\nThis value represents the threshold for species delimitation based on the provided data and rule.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Explanation of Error Rates**\n\nThe threshold $t$ establishes a decision rule for classifying a pair of organisms based on their genetic distance, $d$:\n- If $d < t$, the pair is classified as conspecific (belonging to the same species).\n- If $d \\ge t$, the pair is classified as heterospecific (belonging to different species).\n\nThis classification is subject to two types of errors:\n1.  **False Intraspecific Split (Type I Error):** This occurs when a truly conspecific pair (a pair from within the same species) has a genetic distance $d_{\\text{intra}} \\ge t$. The organisms are incorrectly \"split\" into two different species. The rate of this error is the probability $P(d_{\\text{intra}} \\ge t)$.\n2.  **False Lumping (Type II Error):** This occurs when a truly heterospecific pair (a pair from two different species) has a genetic distance $d_{\\text{inter}} < t$. The two distinct species are incorrectly \"lumped\" into one. The rate of this error is the probability $P(d_{\\text{inter}} < t)$.\n\nThe concept of the \"barcode gap\" posits that the distribution of intraspecific distances is largely separated from the distribution of interspecific distances. The threshold $t$ is placed within this gap.\n\nThe problem requires an explanation based on specific assumptions: \"symmetric unimodal distance distributions with similar spread, and equal misclassification costs.\" These are key.\n\n- The assumption of **symmetric unimodal distributions** (e.g., Gaussian distributions) for both intraspecific and interspecific distances means that each distribution is centered around its mean.\n- The assumption of **similar spread** (i.e., similar variance or standard deviation) implies the shapes of the two distributions are comparable.\n- The choice of the **midpoint threshold** $t$ places the decision boundary exactly halfway between the means of the two distributions, $\\mu_{\\text{intra}}$ and $\\mu_{\\text{inter}}$.\n\nGiven these ideal symmetry conditions, the threshold $t$ is equidistant from the centers of the two distributions. The false intraspecific split rate corresponds to the area under the upper tail of the intraspecific distribution (i.e., for values greater than $t$). The false lumping rate corresponds to the area under the lower tail of the interspecific distribution (i.e., for values less than $t$). Because the distributions are symmetric with similar spread, and the threshold is at the symmetrical midpoint, the area under the tail of the intraspecific distribution beyond $t$ will be approximately equal to the area under the tail of the interspecific distribution below $t$.\n\nTherefore, the choice of a midpoint threshold under these simplified, ideal conditions is a strategy that aims to **balance and approximately equalize the two error rates**. The expected rate of false intraspecific splits is made to be roughly equal to the expected rate of false lumping. This strategy is optimal for minimizing the total error rate when the costs of the two error types are equal and the prior probabilities of encountering a conspecific versus a heterospecific pair are also equal, as is assumed.",
