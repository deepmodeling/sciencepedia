This exercise models this fundamental process of neuronal integration, where you will calculate the combined effect of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) to see if a neuron reaches its firing threshold . This practice will solidify your understanding of how temporal and spatial summation work together to govern neuronal output.",

The neuron under study has a stable resting membrane potential of $-68$ mV and a threshold potential of $-50$ mV required to trigger an action potential.\n\nThe neuron receives inputs from two other neurons, designated Neuron X and Neuron Y. When Neuron X fires, it produces an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) that results in a $+11$ mV depolarization at the axon hillock of the target neuron. When Neuron Y fires, it produces an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) that results in a $-7$ mV hyperpolarization at the same location.\n\nIn a specific experiment, Neuron X is stimulated twice in rapid succession, allowing for perfect temporal summation of its two EPSPs. Simultaneously with the second stimulation of Neuron X, Neuron Y is stimulated once. Assuming the effects of these three potentials (two EPSPs from Neuron X and one IPSP from Neuron Y) summate linearly, calculate the peak membrane potential reached at the axon hillock.\n\nExpress your answer in millivolts (mV).",

            "problem": "A neurophysiologist is investigating the properties of a mammalian neuron maintained in an in-vitro bath. The neuron has a stable resting membrane potential (RMP) of $V_m = -70.0$ mV and an action potential threshold of $V_{th} = -55.0$ mV. The intracellular potassium concentration is maintained at $[K^+]_{in} = 140$ mM. In an experiment, the standard extracellular solution is replaced with one containing a high potassium concentration of $[K^+]_{out} = 50.0$ mM. After the neuron has stabilized in this new environment, a neurotransmitter is applied that exclusively opens ligand-gated potassium channels.\n\nAssume the experiment is conducted at mammalian body temperature (37 °C), where the Nernst potential for a monovalent cation can be calculated using the formula:\n$E_{ion} = (61.5 \\text{ mV}) \\cdot \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}}\\right)$\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting postsynaptic potential?\n\nA.

It produces an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) because K+ ions flow into the cell.\nC. It produces no significant change in potential because the driving force on K+ is now zero.\nD. It produces an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) because the equilibrium potential for K+ is now less negative than the resting membrane potential.\nE. It produces an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) because even though the membrane depolarizes, it does not reach the threshold.",
            "solution": "The direction and magnitude of the postsynaptic potential produced by opening an ion channel are determined by the Nernst potential of that ion and the driving force relative to the membrane potential. The relevant principle is that increasing the conductance to ion $X$ drives the membrane potential $V$ toward the equilibrium potential $E_{X}$, with transmembrane current given by $I_{X} = g_{X}\\left(V - E_{X}\\right)$.\n\nFor potassium under the stated conditions, the Nernst equation at physiological temperature is provided as\n$$\nE_{K} = 61.5 \\text{ mV} \\cdot \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out}}{[K^{+}]_{in}}\\right).\n$$\nWith $[K^{+}]_{out} = 50.0$ mM and $[K^{+}]_{in} = 140$ mM, this gives\n$$\nE_{K} = 61.5 \\text{ mV} \\cdot \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{50.0}{140}\\right),\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{50.0}{140}\\right) = \\log_{10}(0.357\\ldots) < 0,\n$$\nhence\n$$\nE_{K} \\approx -27.5 \\text{ mV}.\n$$\nThis value is less negative than the given resting potential $V_{m} = -70.0 \\text{ mV}$ and is also more positive than the threshold $V_{th} = -55.0 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nOpening ligand-gated $K^{+}$ channels increases $g_{K}$, and $V$ is driven toward $E_{K}$. Because $E_{K} > V_{m}$ (i.e., less negative than $V_{m}$), the membrane will depolarize. In terms of driving force at $V = -70.0 \\text{ mV}$,\n$$\nV - E_{K} = (-70.0 \\text{ mV}) - (-27.5 \\text{ mV}) < 0,\n$$\nso $I_{K} = g_{K}(V - E_{K}) < 0$, which corresponds to an inward positive current (in this scenario, $K^{+}$ influx) that depolarizes the membrane. A depolarizing postsynaptic response is, by definition, an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). The classification as EPSP does not require that threshold be reached; it is based on the depolarizing direction of the potential change.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that opening $K^{+}$ channels produces an EPSP here because the equilibrium potential for $K^{+}$ is now less negative than the resting membrane potential.\n\nOptions analysis:\n- A is incorrect: opening $K^{+}$ channels is not intrinsically inhibitory; it depends on $E_{K}$ relative to $V$.\n- B states a true mechanistic detail in this specific setup (inward $K^{+}$ flux), but the most general and accurate rationale is the position of $E_{K}$ relative to $V_{m}$.\n- C would only hold if $V = E_{K}$ exactly, which is not generally warranted; the given comparison shows a nonzero driving force.\n- D correctly identifies the general principle leading to a depolarizing (excitatory) effect.\n- E is incorrect because EPSP versus IPSP is not determined by whether threshold is reached.",

            "introduction": "Inhibition is a cornerstone of neural computation, but it doesn't always involve making the membrane potential more negative. This problem introduces the crucial and subtle concept of shunting inhibition, which can occur even when there is no net ion flow or voltage change.

            "problem": "In the central nervous system, synaptic inhibition is crucial for shaping neural circuit activity. One common mechanism involves neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to ligand-gated ion channels that are permeable to chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$). Consider a postsynaptic neuron whose membrane potential ($V_m$) is momentarily held at -70 mV. At this exact moment, an inhibitory synapse on its dendrite is activated, opening a population of these anion-specific channels. For this particular neuron, under these specific ionic conditions, the Nernst potential for chloride ions ($E_{Cl}$) is also exactly -70 mV.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of the activation of this inhibitory synapse?\n\nA. A net influx of chloride ions occurs, causing the membrane potential to become more negative in a process known as hyperpolarization.\nB. A net efflux of chloride ions occurs, causing the membrane potential to become less negative in a process known as depolarization.\nC. There is no net flow of chloride ions across the membrane, and therefore the synapse has no physiological effect on the neuron's excitability at this moment.\nD. There is no net flow of chloride ions and no change in the membrane potential, but the total membrane resistance decreases, making the neuron less responsive to subsequent excitatory inputs.",
            "solution": "We use the standard ohmic description of synaptic currents for a ligand-gated ion channel selective for chloride. The chloride current satisfies\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m}-E_{Cl}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Cl}$ is the chloride conductance when the channels are open, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{Cl}$ is the Nernst (reversal) potential for chloride.\n\nAt the instant considered, it is given that $V_{m}=E_{Cl}$. Therefore, the driving force is\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{Cl}=0,\n$$\nand hence\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\cdot 0=0.\n$$\nThus, immediately upon channel opening, there is no net chloride flux and no immediate change in $V_{m}$.\n\nHowever, opening the channels increases the membrane conductance. Let the baseline membrane conductance be $G_{m}$ (with input resistance $R_{in}=1/G_{m}$). When chloride channels open, the total conductance becomes\n$$\nG_{m}'=G_{m}+g_{Cl},\n$$\nso the input resistance becomes\n$$\nR_{in}'=\\frac{1}{G_{m}'}=\\frac{1}{G_{m}+g_{Cl}}<\\frac{1}{G_{m}}=R_{in}.\n$$\nA decreased input resistance reduces the voltage response to any subsequent synaptic or injected current, since a given current $I$ produces a voltage change $\\Delta V=I/G_{m}'$ that is smaller than $\\Delta V=I/G_{m}$. This divisive, “shunting” effect diminishes excitatory postsynaptic potentials without requiring a change in $V_{m}$ at the moment of inhibitory channel opening.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that there is no net chloride flow and no immediate change in membrane potential, but the membrane resistance decreases, making the neuron less responsive to excitatory inputs.\n\nThe correct choice is D.",
