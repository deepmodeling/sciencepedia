            "problem": "A cultured hippocampal neuron expresses a destabilized reporter messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for a synaptic protein at a constant transcriptional synthesis rate. In the absence of microRNA, the reporter mRNA is removed by first-order decay. Upon overexpression of a microRNA (miRNA), Argonaute-loaded RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) binds a constant fraction of the reporter mRNA molecules and catalyzes an additional first-order decay pathway.\n\nUse the following foundational bases and definitions:\n- The Central Dogma posits that transcription produces mRNA, which is then degraded; in a well-mixed compartment under constant conditions, mRNA dynamics can be modeled by a production term minus a removal term.\n- For first-order removal, the flux is proportional to the current mRNA concentration.\n- If two independent first-order decay processes act simultaneously, their rate constants add to give the total first-order removal rate constant.\n\nLet $m(t)$ denote the cytosolic reporter mRNA concentration at time $t$. The synthesis occurs at a constant rate $k_{s}$, baseline removal occurs with a first-order rate constant $k_{d}$, and the miRNA-bound fraction is $p$.

The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness. We can therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $m(t)$ denote the concentration of the reporter mRNA at time $t$. The rate of change of this concentration, $\\frac{dm(t)}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between the rate of synthesis and the rate of removal.

The problem states that for such simultaneous processes, their rate constants are additive.\nThe first pathway is the baseline decay, characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_d$.\nThe second pathway is the miRNA-catalyzed decay. This process adds an effective first-order rate constant of $\\beta p$ to the total removal, where $p$ is the constant fraction of mRNA bound by the RISC complex and $\\beta$ is a rate parameter.\n\nThe total first-order removal rate constant, $k_{total}$, is therefore the sum of the constants for the two pathways:\n$$ k_{total} = k_d + \\beta p $$\nThe rate of removal, being a first-order process, is the product of this total rate constant and the mRNA concentration $m(t)$:\n$$ \\text{Rate of removal} = k_{total} \\cdot m(t) = (k_d + \\beta p) m(t) $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for synthesis and removal back into the rate equation gives the full model for mRNA dynamics:\n$$ \\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = k_s - (k_d + \\beta p) m(t) $$\n\nThe steady state is achieved when the mRNA concentration is constant, which means its time derivative is zero. Let $m^{\\ast}$ denote the steady-state concentration $[m\\mathrm{RNA}]^{\\ast}$.

Assume the following fundamental bases: (i) proteins are synthesized at a rate proportional to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) translation and degraded by first-order kinetics, and (ii) the protein half-life is the time required for the protein abundance to decay to one-half under first-order degradation. Let the protein abundance be $P(t)$, the basal synthesis rate be $k_{s}$, and the degradation rate constant be $k_{d}$. Before time $t=0$, the neuron is at steady state under basal conditions. At $t=0$, a $5$-minute high-frequency firing episode induces a microRNA effect that instantaneously reduces the protein’s translational output to a fraction $r=0.5$ of its basal value for the duration of the episode, without altering $k_{d}$ or mRNA abundance.

The given data are dimensionally consistent (time units can be reconciled).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the protein abundance $P(t)$ are described by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\text{Synthesis Rate} - \\text{Degradation Rate}\n$$\nGiven a first-order degradation process, the degradation rate is $k_d P(t)$. The synthesis rate is $k_s$ under basal conditions and $r k_s$ during the episode.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial condition at $t=0^{-}$. The system is at steady state, which means $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$. The synthesis rate is the basal rate $k_s$. Let $P_{ss}$ be the steady-state protein abundance.\n$$\n0 = k_s - k_d P_{ss}\n$$\nThis gives the initial protein abundance:\n$$\nP(0^{-}) = P_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the degradation rate constant $k_d$ from the protein half-life, $T_{1/2}$. For a first-order decay process, the relationship between the half-life and the rate constant is:\n$$\nk_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n$$\nThe problem gives $T_{1/2} = 1$ hour. Since the event duration is in minutes, we must use consistent units.

The differential equation governing the protein abundance for $t \\geq 0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = r k_s - k_d P(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation. The initial condition is $P(0) = P(0^{-}) = P_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d}$. We can solve this equation. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + k_d P(t) = r k_s\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($P_h(t) = C \\exp(-k_d t)$) and a particular solution. For the particular solution, we can assume a constant $P_p = A$, which yields $k_d A = r k_s$, so $A = \\frac{r k_s}{k_d}$.\nThe general solution is:\n$$\nP(t) = C \\exp(-k_d t) + \\frac{r k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $P(0) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d}$ to find the constant of integration $C$:\n$$\nP(0) = C \\exp(0) + \\frac{r k_s}{k_d} = C + \\frac{r k_s}{k_d}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k_s}{k_d} = C + \\frac{r k_s}{k_d} \\implies C = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} - \\frac{r k_s}{k_d} = \\frac{(1-r)k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution gives the explicit solution for $P(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{(1-r)k_s}{k_d} \\exp(-k_d t) + \\frac{r k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nWe can express this in terms of the initial steady-state abundance $P(0^{-}) = P_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d}$:\n$$\nP(t) = (1-r) P_{ss} \\exp(-k_d t) + r P_{ss} = P_{ss} \\left( r + (1-r)\\exp(-k_d t) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional change in protein abundance at $t=5$ minutes, which is defined as $\\frac{P(5\\,\\text{min}) - P(0^{-})}{P(0^{-})}$.\n$$\n\\frac{P(t) - P(0^{-})}{P(0^{-})} = \\frac{P_{ss} \\left( r + (1-r)\\exp(-k_d t) \\right) - P_{ss}}{P_{ss}} = \\left( r + (1-r)\\exp(-k_d t) \\right) - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Change} = r - 1 + (1-r)\\exp(-k_d t) = (1-r)(\\exp(-k_d t) - 1)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $t=5$ minutes, $r=0.5$, and $k_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{60}$ min$^{-1}$.\nThe exponent term is:\n$$\n-k_d t = -\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{60}\\right) \\times 5 = -\\frac{5 \\ln(2)}{60} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the fractional change:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Change} = (1 - 0.5) \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.5 \\left( \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-1/12}\\right)\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 0.5 \\left( 2^{-1/12} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n2^{-1/12} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[12]{2}} \\approx 0.94387431\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Change} \\approx 0.5 \\times (0.94387431 - 1) = 0.5 \\times (-0.05612569) = -0.028062845\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
