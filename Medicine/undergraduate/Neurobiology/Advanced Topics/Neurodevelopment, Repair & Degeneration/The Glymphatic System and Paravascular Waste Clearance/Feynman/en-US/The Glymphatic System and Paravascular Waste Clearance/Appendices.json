Solute transport is primarily a competition between advection, the bulk flow of fluid carrying solutes along, and diffusion, the random movement of solutes down their concentration gradient. This exercise  provides a hands-on approach to deriving the characteristic timescales for each process directly from the convection-diffusion equation. By calculating the Péclet number, a dimensionless ratio of these timescales, you will gain a powerful tool for predicting which transport mechanism dominates under specific physiological conditions, such as during sleep.",
