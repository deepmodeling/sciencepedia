            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard ligand-receptor binding equilibrium, which is a fundamental concept in pharmacology and cell biology. The provided parameters and assumptions are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the expression for fractional receptor occupancy. Let $[R]$ be the molar concentration of free P2Y12 receptors, $[L]$ be the molar concentration of the free ligand (ADP), and $[RL]$ be the molar concentration of the receptor-ligand complex. The binding process is a reversible reaction described by:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, at equilibrium, the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product complex is a constant. This constant is the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. The problem specifies a single binding site per receptor and no cooperativity.\nThe definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ is:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{tot}$, is the sum of the free receptors and the bound receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{tot} = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nFractional receptor occupancy, denoted by $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{tot}}\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from the equations. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express the concentration of free receptors $[R]$ as:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration gives:\n$$\n[R]_{tot} = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]\n$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ on the right-hand side yields:\n$$\n[R]_{tot} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to find the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{tot}}$, which is the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{tot}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional receptor occupancy as a function of free ADP concentration. This equation is a specific case of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a non-cooperative system (Hill coefficient $n=1$).\n\nNext, we address why the P2Y12 signaling output can be modeled as proportional to the fractional occupancy under a linear transduction assumption. A linear transduction assumption posits that the downstream biological signal generated by the receptor population is directly proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors. Let the signal output be $S$. This assumption can be stated mathematically as:\n$$\nS = c \\cdot [RL]\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality representing the efficacy of the signal transduction cascade per bound receptor. The maximum possible signal, $S_{max}$, occurs when all receptors are occupied by the ligand (i.e., at saturating ligand concentrations, where $[RL] \\approx [R]_{tot}$). Thus:\n$$\nS_{max} = c \\cdot [R]_{tot}\n$$\nThe fractional signal output is the ratio of the current signal to the maximum possible signal:\n$$\n\\frac{S}{S_{max}} = \\frac{c \\cdot [RL]}{c \\cdot [R]_{tot}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{tot}}\n$$\nBy definition, this ratio is the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$. Therefore, under a linear transduction assumption, the fractional signaling output is identical to the fractional receptor occupancy:\n$$\n\\frac{S}{S_{max}} = \\theta\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the signaling output, when normalized to its maximum, can be directly modeled by the fractional occupancy $\\theta$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional occupancy for the given ADP concentrations using the derived expression $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$ and the provided value $K_d = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\n1.  For an ADP concentration of $[L] = 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n    $$\n    \\theta_1 = \\frac{0.05}{0.2 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.2000$.\n\n2.  For an ADP concentration of $[L] = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n    In this case, the ligand concentration is equal to the dissociation constant, $[L] = K_d$.\n    $$\n    \\theta_2 = \\frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5\n    $$\n    As expected, when $[L] = K_d$, half of the receptors are occupied. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\n3.  For an ADP concentration of $[L] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n    $$\n    \\theta_3 = \\frac{2}{0.2 + 2} = \\frac{2}{2.2} = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909090...\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.9091$.\n\nThe computed fractional occupancies for $[L] = 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ are $0.2000$, $0.5000$, and $0.9091$, respectively.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and consistent. It describes a standard application of stochastic process theory, specifically the Poisson process, to a biological phenomenon. The provided data are sufficient and dimensionally correct. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the probability of at least one microglial contact with a synapse within a time interval $[0, t]$, given that contacts are independent, memoryless, and occur at a constant average rate $\\lambda$. This physical description corresponds to a Poisson process. The problem specifically requires the derivation to be based on the waiting-time distribution for a memoryless process with a constant hazard rate.\n\nLet $T$ be the continuous random variable representing the waiting time for the first contact. The process being \"memoryless\" means that the probability of a contact occurring in a future time interval is independent of how long we have already waited. This property is formally expressed by the equation:\n$$P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)$$\nfor any $t > 0$ and $s > 0$.\n\nLet $S(t) = P(T > t)$ be the survival function, which represents the probability that no contact has occurred by time $t$. The conditional probability definition $P(A|B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B)$ allows us to rewrite the memoryless property as:\n$$\\frac{P(T > t + s \\text{ and } T > t)}{P(T > t)} = P(T > s)$$\nThe event $\\{T > t+s\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{T > t\\}$, so their intersection is simply $\\{T > t+s\\}$. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$\\frac{S(t+s)}{S(t)} = S(s) \\implies S(t+s) = S(t)S(s)$$\nThis is the Cauchy functional equation. For a function that is not identically zero and is at least continuous (a reasonable assumption for a physical probability), the only solutions are of the form $S(t) = \\exp(-kt)$ for some constant $k$.\n\nNext, we must relate the constant $k$ to the given constant average rate of contact, $\\lambda$. This rate is the hazard rate, $h(t)$, which is defined as the instantaneous rate of an event occurring at time $t$, given that it has not yet occurred.\n$$h(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(t < T \\le t+\\Delta t | T > t)}{\\Delta t}$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$P(t < T \\le t+\\Delta t | T > t) = \\frac{P(t < T \\le t+\\Delta t)}{P(T > t)} = \\frac{P(T > t) - P(T > t+\\Delta t)}{P(T > t)} = \\frac{S(t) - S(t+\\Delta t)}{S(t)}$$\nSubstituting this into the hazard rate definition:\n$$h(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{S(t) - S(t+\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t \\cdot S(t)} = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the average rate of contact is constant, which we denote as $\\lambda$. Thus, $h(t) = \\lambda$.\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$$\nWe now substitute our functional form for $S(t) = \\exp(-kt)$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{\\exp(-kt)} \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(-kt)) = -\\frac{1}{\\exp(-kt)} (-k \\exp(-kt)) = k$$\nThis shows that the constant $k$ in the survival function is precisely the contact rate $\\lambda$. Therefore, the probability that the waiting time for the first contact is greater than $t$ is:\n$$S(t) = P(T > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis is the probability that no contact occurs in the interval $[0, t]$. The problem asks for the probability that the synapse will be contacted *at least once* within time $t$. This is the complement of the event of having no contacts. Let $P(\\ge 1)$ be this probability.\n$$P(\\ge 1 \\text{ contact in } [0, t]) = 1 - P(0 \\text{ contacts in } [0, t])$$\nThe event of \"0 contacts in $[0, t]$\" is identical to the event \"the first contact occurs after time $t$\", which is $P(T > t)$.\nTherefore, the desired expression is:\n$$P(\\ge 1 \\text{ contact}) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters:\nContact rate $\\lambda = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\nTime interval $t = 10\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless exponent $\\lambda t$:\n$$\\lambda t = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{min}) = 2$$\nThe probability is then:\n$$P = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\nUsing the value of $e$, we compute the numerical result:\n$$\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528...$$\n$$P \\approx 1 - 0.13533528... = 0.86466471...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 0.8647$$\nThis is the final numerical answer.",

            "problem": "A neuron–microglia co-culture is used to study synaptic pruning. Presynaptic boutons express synapto-pHluorin, a green fluorescent protein engineered to report pH, whose fluorescence is strong at near-neutral pH and quenched in acidic environments. A student observes that when microglial processes contact boutons, synapto-pHluorin fluorescence declines over time. The student wants to test whether the decline specifically reflects engulfment of synaptic elements into acidifying microglial phagosomes rather than extracellular quenching, local extracellular acidification, or photobleaching.\n\nUse the following fundamental base to guide your reasoning: microglial phagosomes acidify via the vacuolar-type proton adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase), which drives lumenal pH from approximately extracellular pH $7.4$ toward phagolysosomal pH near $5.0$–$5.5$. The fluorescence of pHluorin depends on protonation according to acid–base equilibrium; for a dye with acid dissociation constant characterized by $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, the deprotonated fraction varies with pH via standard acid–base relations.\n\nWhich experimental design most convincingly justifies the use of synapto-pHluorin to confirm engulfment leading to acidification, and includes controls that distinguish extracellular quenching from phagosomal acidification?\n\nA. Express synapto-pHluorin in presynaptic boutons and image during microglial contact. Apply a membrane-impermeant quencher (trypan blue) to extinguish extracellular fluorescence and infer that any subsequent loss of signal during microglial contact must be due to internal acidification.

            "solution": "A robust experimental design to test the hypothesis must achieve several key objectives simultaneously:\n1.  **Distinguish Internalized vs. Extracellular Boutons:** It is crucial to determine if the presynaptic bouton is inside a microglial compartment or remains outside. A signal decline could occur extracellularly, so proving internalization is the first step.\n2.  **Control for pH-Independent Signal Loss:** Fluorescence intensity can decrease for reasons other than pH, notably photobleaching (light-induced fluorophore destruction) or the physical movement of the bouton out of the focal plane. A proper design must control for these artifacts. The gold-standard method is to use a ratiometric reporter, where a pH-sensitive fluorophore is fused to a pH-insensitive one. The ratio of their emissions provides a measure of pH that is independent of the total amount of protein.\n3.  **Establish Causality of Acidification:** To prove that the signal loss is due to acidification, the mechanism of acidification must be manipulated. This involves two complementary approaches:\n    a. **Inhibition:** Blocking the V-ATPase (e.g., with bafilomycin) should prevent phagosome acidification. If the hypothesis is correct, internalized boutons should not lose their pHluorin signal in the presence of the inhibitor.\n    b. **Reversal:** Once the pHluorin signal is quenched, transiently neutralizing the acidic compartment (e.g., with a weak base like $\\mathrm{NH_4Cl}$) should rescue the fluorescence. This demonstrates that the fluorophore was quenched, not degraded or removed.\n4.  **Reporter Validation:** The reporter system's pH-response curve should be calibrated in situ to confirm it behaves as expected and to allow for quantitative pH measurements.\n\nThe most convincing design will integrate all of these elements. Let's analyze the options based on these criteria.\n\n**A. Express synapto-pHluorin in presynaptic boutons and image during microglial contact. Apply a membrane-impermeant quencher (trypan blue) to extinguish extracellular fluorescence and infer that any subsequent loss of signal during microglial contact must be due to internal acidification. Do not manipulate phagosomal pH or include a pH-insensitive fluorophore.**\n\nThis option is critically flawed. It lacks a control for photobleaching or physical loss of the bouton, so any signal decline is ambiguous. More importantly, it fails to establish causality. It \"infers\" that signal loss is due to acidification without any direct test. The lack of pharmacological manipulation (blocking or reversing acidification) makes the conclusion weak and unsubstantiated.\n\n**B. Express synapto-pHluorin and verify that lowering the bath pH to $5.5$ quenches boutons near microglia more than distant ones. Add tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block neuronal firing as a control for exocytosis-dependent fluorescence changes.**\n\nThis experiment is misdirected. The primary hypothesis is about *internal* phagosomal acidification, but this design tests the effect of *external* acidification. Showing that an acidic bath quenches the fluorophore only confirms the reporter's intrinsic property; it does not provide any evidence for engulfment. The TTX control is irrelevant to the core question of pruning and phagosomal acidification.\n\n**C. Replace synapto-pHluorin with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged synapsin and confirm microglial lysosome involvement by colocalization with LysoTracker. Correct for photobleaching and assume any colocalized green signal loss reflects engulfment-driven acidification.**\n\nThis option is flawed. It replaces the specialized pH-sensitive reporter (synapto-pHluorin) with EGFP, which is not an optimized pH sensor. It also \"assumes\" that signal loss is due to acidification, a conclusion that must be experimentally proven. While colocalization with LysoTracker is suggestive, it is less direct than measuring the pH of the specific engulfed compartment itself.\n\n**D. Express a tandem synapto-pHluorin–mCherry reporter in presynaptic boutons and image microglial contacts. Apply an extracellular anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobody to quench surface-accessible pHluorin without entering cells, so that persistent green signal reports internal compartments.

Calibrate reporter pH sensitivity by clamping intracellular pH with nigericin in high $\\mathrm{K^+}$ buffers and verifying that green/red ratios correspond to pH $7.4$ versus pH $5.5$.**\n\nThis design is comprehensive and rigorous.\n- The **tandem reporter** controls for photobleaching and protein quantity.\n- The **anti-GFP nanobody** provides a specific assay for internalization.\n- **Bafilomycin** (inhibition) and **$\\mathrm{NH_4Cl}$** (rescue) directly test the causal role of acidification.\n- **Nigericin calibration** validates the reporter system.\nThis design incorporates multiple, orthogonal controls and direct tests of mechanism, making it the most convincing approach.",
