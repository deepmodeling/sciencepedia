This exercise explores the concept of population coding, where the collective activity of many broadly-tuned neurons in the primary motor cortex represents a specific movement direction . By applying the classic population vector algorithm, you will see how a simple, weighted average of neuronal preferences can accurately decode motor intent, providing a foundational model for brain-machine interfaces.",

            "problem": "A canonical approach to decoding movement intention from primary motor cortex relies on population encoding: neurons with distinct preferred movement directions collectively represent the intended movement via their firing rates. Consider a planar reach in the horizontal plane at a true direction of 60°. A population of 8 motor cortical neurons has preferred directions uniformly spaced every 45°, specifically 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°. Each neuron exhibits a baseline firing rate of 20 spikes per second (sp/s) and a modulation depth of 10 sp/s that is consistent with classic cosine tuning of firing to movement direction. Assume the standard population vector method in which each neuron's contribution is a vector in its preferred direction with magnitude equal to its firing rate, summed across neurons to yield a decoded direction.\n\nUsing only foundational principles about cosine-tuned motor cortical activity and population vector decoding, compute the population vector estimate of the movement direction and the angular error between this estimate and the true 60° reach. Express both the decoded direction and the angular error in degrees, and round your answers to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The firing rate $r_i$ of neuron $i$ is described by the cosine tuning model:\n$$r_i = B + M \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_i)$$\nwhere $B=20$ sp/s is the baseline rate, $M=10$ sp/s is the modulation depth, $\\theta=60^\\circ$ is the true movement direction, and $\\theta_i$ is the neuron's preferred direction.\n\nThe population vector $\\vec{P}$ is the sum of individual neural vectors $\\vec{v}_i$. Each vector $\\vec{v}_i$ points in the neuron's preferred direction $\\theta_i$ and has a magnitude equal to its firing rate $r_i$.\n$$\\vec{P} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\vec{v}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} r_i \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta_i) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta_i) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe Cartesian components of the population vector are:\n$$P_x = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} r_i \\cos(\\theta_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} [B + M \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_i)] \\cos(\\theta_i)$$\n$$P_y = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} r_i \\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} [B + M \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_i)] \\sin(\\theta_i)$$\n\nBecause the 8 preferred directions are uniformly distributed around a circle, the sums involving the baseline rate $B$ become zero ($\\sum \\cos(\\theta_i) = 0$ and $\\sum \\sin(\\theta_i) = 0$). The components simplify to:\n$$P_x = M \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_i) \\cos(\\theta_i)$$\n$$P_y = M \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_i) \\sin(\\theta_i)$$\n\nUsing the identity $\\cos(A-B) = \\cos A \\cos B + \\sin A \\sin B$ and the properties of sums over uniformly spaced angles ($\\sum \\cos^2\\theta_i = N/2$, $\\sum \\sin^2\\theta_i = N/2$, and $\\sum \\sin\\theta_i\\cos\\theta_i = 0$ for $N \\ge 3$), the equations further simplify to:\n$$P_x = M \\cos(\\theta) \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\cos^2\\theta_i = M \\cos(\\theta) (N/2)$$\n$$P_y = M \\sin(\\theta) \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sin^2\\theta_i = M \\sin(\\theta) (N/2)$$\n\nThe decoded direction $\\theta_{\\text{dec}}$ is the angle of this vector, which is found using the arctangent of the ratio of the components:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{dec}} = \\operatorname{atan2}(P_y, P_x) = \\operatorname{atan2}(M \\sin(\\theta) (N/2), M \\cos(\\theta) (N/2)) = \\operatorname{atan2}(\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta) = \\theta$$\n\nThis shows that for an ideal population with uniformly distributed preferred directions and cosine tuning, the population vector algorithm provides a perfect estimate of the movement direction.\n\nThe true direction is $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$.\nTherefore, the decoded direction is $\\theta_{\\text{dec}} = 60^{\\circ}$.\nTo four significant figures, this is written as $60.00^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe angular error is the absolute difference between the decoded and true directions:\n$$\\text{Error} = |\\theta_{\\text{dec}} - \\theta| = |60^{\\circ} - 60^{\\circ}| = 0^{\\circ}$$\nExpressed to the implied precision of the calculation, this is $0.0000^{\\circ}$.",

            "problem": "In motor cortical map plasticity, motor learning is accompanied by an increase in the formation and stabilization of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons in primary motor cortex. Consider a simplified probabilistic model for a short training regimen in which the baseline linear spine density along a dendritic segment is $D_0 = 1.20$ spines per µm. During each day of training, new spines form at a fraction $r = 0.05$ per day, referenced to the baseline density $D_0$, and each newly formed spine independently stabilizes with probability $p = 0.30$ by the end of that day and then persists for the remainder of the training. Assume training lasts $T = 10$ consecutive days, that formation and stabilization events on different days are independent, and that the reported daily formation fraction $r$ is referenced to the baseline $D_0$ each day (so it does not compound across days over this short interval).\n\nUsing only core probability definitions (Bernoulli trials, independence, and linearity of expectation) and the stated assumptions, derive an expression for the expected net increase in stable spine density after $T$ days and evaluate it for the given parameters.

Density of Spines Formed Per Day:**\nThe problem states that new spines form at a rate $r = 0.05$ per day, relative to the baseline density $D_0 = 1.20$ spines/µm. The density of new spines formed on any single day is constant (non-compounding):\n$$D_{\\text{new}} = r \\times D_0 = 0.05 \\text{ day}^{-1} \\times 1.20 \\text{ spines/µm} = 0.06 \\text{ spines/µm per day}$$\n\n**2. Expected Density of Spines Stabilized Per Day:**\nEach newly formed spine has a probability $p = 0.30$ of becoming stable. The expected density of spines that form and stabilize on any given day is the product of the new spine density and the stabilization probability:\n$$E[\\Delta D_{\\text{stable, day}}] = D_{\\text{new}} \\times p = (0.06 \\text{ spines/µm per day}) \\times 0.30 = 0.018 \\text{ spines/µm per day}$$\n\n**3. Total Expected Increase Over the Training Period:**\nThe training lasts for $T = 10$ days. Since stabilized spines persist and the process is identical each day, the total expected increase is the daily expected increase multiplied by the number of days. This follows from the linearity of expectation ($E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$).\n$$E[\\Delta D_{\\text{stable}}] = T \\times E[\\Delta D_{\\text{stable, day}}]$$\n$$E[\\Delta D_{\\text{stable}}] = 10 \\text{ days} \\times 0.018 \\text{ spines/µm per day} = 0.18 \\text{ spines/µm}$$\n\n**4.

Consider a simplified activity-dependent competition model during an early critical period in which two effectors (left forelimb and right forelimb) compete for a fixed cortical sector of total area $S$. The model assumes that, at steady state, the cortical territory $T_{i}$ assigned to effector $i$ is proportional to its time-averaged activity $A_{i}$ over the critical period, with total area constrained by $\\sum_{i} T_{i} = S$. Assume that, in a typical baseline condition without manipulation, the two forelimbs have equal time-averaged activity $A_{0}$, so that the baseline allocation to each limb is symmetric.\n\nNow suppose a neonatal manipulation immobilizes the left forelimb throughout the critical period, reducing its time-averaged activity to a fraction of baseline while leaving the right forelimb’s activity unchanged. Specifically, the left forelimb’s activity is reduced by $70\\%$ relative to its baseline, such that its time-averaged activity becomes $0.30\\,A_{0}$, while the right forelimb remains at $A_{0}$. Assume that adult map allocation equals the steady-state proportional allocation produced by these time-averaged activities.\n\nUsing only the assumptions stated above together with conservation of total cortical area, compute the fractional shrinkage (unitless) of the left forelimb’s cortical territory in adulthood relative to its own baseline allocation.
