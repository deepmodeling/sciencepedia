This first exercise guides you through a foundational kinetic model to determine the steady-state level of methylation, a crucial concept for understanding how a cell maintains its stable yet adaptable epigenetic identity.

            "problem": "Consider a population of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites at the promoter of a memory-associated gene such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a hippocampal neuron. The fraction of methylated sites at time $t$, denoted $M(t)$, is regulated by the opposing enzymatic actions of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and Ten-eleven translocation (TET) demethylase. Assume a well-mixed locus and mass-action kinetics under constant enzyme availability, so that methylation proceeds at a rate proportional to the unmethylated fraction and demethylation proceeds at a rate proportional to the methylated fraction. Let $k_m$ be the effective methylation rate constant due to DNMT and $k_d$ be the effective demethylation rate constant due to TET. The dynamics of the methylation fraction are given by the first-order ordinary differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m\\left(1 - M\\right) - k_d M\n$$.\nUsing the definition of a steady state in which $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$, derive an expression for the steady-state methylation fraction $M^{*}$ in terms of $k_m$ and $k_d$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k_m$ and $k_d$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state fraction of methylated CpG sites, denoted $M^{*}$, based on a kinetic model of DNA methylation and demethylation. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The model, while a simplification of complex biological reality, is a standard and valid approach in theoretical biology for studying dynamic epigenetic states.\n\nThe dynamics of the methylation fraction, $M(t)$, are described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m\\left(1 - M\\right) - k_d M\n$$\nHere, $M$ represents the fraction of methylated sites, so it is a dimensionless quantity constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. Consequently, the fraction of unmethylated sites is $(1 - M)$. The term $k_m(1 - M)$ represents the rate of methylation, which is proportional to the concentration of available unmethylated sites. The constant $k_m$ is the effective rate constant for methylation, encompassing the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. The term $-k_d M$ represents the rate of demethylation, which is proportional to the concentration of methylated sites available as substrate. The constant $k_d$ is the effective rate constant for demethylation, reflecting the activity of enzymes such as the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family. The rate constants $k_m$ and $k_d$ are inherently non-negative, i.e., $k_m \\ge 0$ and $k_d \\ge 0$.\n\nA steady state is a condition where the state variable of the system, in this case $M(t)$, no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this is defined by the condition that the time derivative of the state variable is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe denote the value of $M$ at steady state as $M^{*}$. By substituting this condition into the governing differential equation, we transition from a dynamic equation to an algebraic equation that defines the equilibrium point(s) of the system.\n$$\n0 = k_m\\left(1 - M^{*}\\right) - k_d M^{*}\n$$\nOur goal is to solve this algebraic equation for $M^{*}$. First, we distribute the $k_m$ term on the right-hand side:\n$$\n0 = k_m - k_m M^{*} - k_d M^{*}\n$$\nNext, we collect all terms containing $M^{*}$ on one side of the equation. We can move the terms with $M^{*}$ to the left-hand side:\n$$\nk_m M^{*} + k_d M^{*} = k_m\n$$\nNow, we factor out the common term $M^{*}$ from the expression on the left-hand side:\n$$\nM^{*}\\left(k_m + k_d\\right) = k_m\n$$\nFinally, to isolate $M^{*}$, we divide both sides by the sum of the rate constants, $(k_m + k_d)$. This is permissible as long as $k_m + k_d \\neq 0$. Given that $k_m$ and $k_d$ are non-negative rate constants, their sum can only be zero if both are zero, which would represent a trivial system with no dynamic activity. In any biologically relevant scenario, at least one of the rates is non-zero, so $k_m + k_d > 0$.\n$$\nM^{*} = \\frac{k_m}{k_m + k_d}\n$$\nThis expression gives the steady-state methylation fraction as a function of the methylation and demethylation rate constants. It represents the point of balance where the rate of methylation equals the rate of demethylation. For instance, if $k_m \\gg k_d$, $M^{*}$ approaches $1$, indicating a state of high methylation. Conversely, if $k_d \\gg k_m$, $M^{*}$ approaches $0$, indicating a state of low methylation. If the rates are equal, $k_m = k_d$, then $M^{*} = \\frac{k_m}{k_m + k_m} = \\frac{k_m}{2k_m} = \\frac{1}{2}$, indicating that half the sites are methylated at steady state. The derived expression is dimensionally consistent, as the units of $k_m$ and $k_d$ ($\\text{time}^{-1}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction for $M^{*}$.",

In a simplified biophysical description of a promoter nucleosome, let $A(t)$ denote the fraction of nucleosomes that are acetylated at time $t$. Assume well-mixed, first-order kinetics in which acetylation is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases with rate constant $k_{ac}$ and deacetylation is catalyzed by Histone Deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) with rate constant $k_{deac}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe system dynamics of histone acetylation can be modeled by considering the balance between the acetylation of unacetylated nucleosomes and the deacetylation of acetylated ones. Let $A(t)$ be the fraction of nucleosomes that are acetylated. Consequently, the fraction of unacetylated nucleosomes is $1 - A(t)$.\n\nAccording to the principle of mass-action for first-order reactions, the rate of change of the acetylated fraction, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is given by the rate of formation minus the rate of removal.\nThe rate of formation (acetylation) is proportional to the fraction of available substrate, which is the unacetylated population $1 - A(t)$. This rate is $k_{ac}(1 - A(t))$.\nThe rate of removal (deacetylation) is proportional to the fraction of the acetylated population $A(t)$. This rate is $k_{deac}A(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms yields the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{ac}(1 - A(t)) - k_{deac}A(t)\n$$\n\nThe steady-state acetylation fraction, denoted as $A^{*}$, is achieved when the net rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. Setting the equation to zero allows us to solve for $A^{*}$:\n$$\n0 = k_{ac}(1 - A^{*}) - k_{deac}A^{*}\n$$\n$$\nk_{ac} - k_{ac}A^{*} = k_{deac}A^{*}\n$$\n$$\nk_{ac} = (k_{ac} + k_{deac})A^{*}\n$$\n$$\nA^{*} = \\frac{k_{ac}}{k_{ac} + k_{deac}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the steady-state acetylation fraction.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the two conditions: baseline and with the inhibitor.\n\nFor the baseline condition, we use the given rate constants: $k_{ac, \\text{baseline}} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $k_{deac, \\text{baseline}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nThe baseline steady-state fraction, $A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}}$, is:\n$$\nA^{*}_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{k_{ac, \\text{baseline}}}{k_{ac, \\text{baseline}} + k_{deac, \\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.1} = \\frac{0.08}{0.18} = \\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{4}{9}\n$$\n\nFor the condition with the HDAC2 inhibitor, the problem states that the inhibitor reduces HDAC2 activity by $70\\%$. This means the remaining activity is $100\\% - 70\\% = 30\\%$, or $0.3$ of the baseline. Since $k_{deac}$ scales linearly with HDAC2 activity, the new deacetylation rate constant, $k_{deac, \\text{inhib}}$, is:\n$$\nk_{deac, \\text{inhib}} = (1 - 0.70) \\times k_{deac, \\text{baseline}} = 0.3 \\times 0.1\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe acetylation rate constant, $k_{ac}$, remains unchanged:\n$$\nk_{ac, \\text{inhib}} = k_{ac, \\text{baseline}} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe steady-state fraction in the presence of the inhibitor, $A^{*}_{\\text{inhib}}$, is:\n$$\nA^{*}_{\\text{inhib}} = \\frac{k_{ac, \\text{inhib}}}{k_{ac, \\text{inhib}} + k_{deac, \\text{inhib}}} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.03} = \\frac{0.08}{0.11} = \\frac{8}{11}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change, which is the ratio $\\frac{A^{*}_{\\text{inhib}}}{A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{A^{*}_{\\text{inhib}}}{A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{11}}{\\frac{4}{9}} = \\frac{8}{11} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{72}{44}\n$$\nSimplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{72 \\div 4}{44 \\div 4} = \\frac{18}{11}\n$$",

            "problem": "In a hippocampal neuron experiment probing epigenetic regulation during memory-related plasticity, investigators measure chromatin accessibility at the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) promoter before and after induction of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).

We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n$$A = k_1 R'$$\nwhere $R'$ is the background-corrected read count and $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can define the chromatin accessibility at baseline, $A_b$, and post-LTP, $A_p$:\n$$A_b = k_1 R'_{b} = k_1(40)$$\n$$A_p = k_1 R'_{p} = k_1(140)$$\n\nThe fold-change in chromatin accessibility is defined as the ratio of the post-LTP accessibility to the baseline accessibility:\n$$\\text{Fold-change in } A = \\frac{A_p}{A_b} = \\frac{k_1(140)}{k_1(40)}$$\nThe proportionality constant $k_1$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$\\text{Fold-change in } A = \\frac{140}{40} = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$$\n\nNext, we must infer the expected fold-change in transcription initiation.
