Restoring the delicate ionic balance is the cell's top priority, a task performed by the energy-intensive $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pump. This exercise provides a concrete link between the fundamental physics of electrical charge and the biochemical cost of cellular homeostasis, allowing you to calculate the immense ATP demand required to recover from an excitotoxic event . Understanding this metabolic burden is key to appreciating why energy failure is a central feature of secondary brain injury.",

Assume the charge movement during the depolarization is carried entirely by monovalent sodium ions $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ (ignore contributions from chloride or divalent ions).

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information for a unique solution based on fundamental principles of electrophysiology and biochemistry.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimal number of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecules that must be hydrolyzed per square centimeter to restore the sodium gradient after a depolarization event. The solution can be obtained through a sequence of logical steps.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of sodium ions, denoted as $N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$, that entered the cytosol. The problem states that the total positive charge moved into the cell is $Q = 5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C}$ and that this charge is carried exclusively by monovalent sodium ions, $\\mathrm{Na}^+$. Each sodium ion carries a single elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$. The total number of ions is therefore the total charge divided by the charge per ion:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = \\frac{Q}{e} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the number of ATP molecules required to extrude these sodium ions. The restoration of the ion gradient is performed by the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase. The stoichiometry of this pump is given as extruding $3$ intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions for every $1$ molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. Therefore, the number of ATP molecules required, $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, is one-third of the total number of sodium ions that need to be removed.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}}{3} $$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$ into the equation for $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, we can derive a single expression for the number of ATP molecules in terms of the given quantities $Q$ and $e$:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{Q/e}{3} = \\frac{Q}{3e} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ATP molecules per square centimeter. The initial charge movement of $Q$ occurred over a membrane patch of area $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. Therefore, the calculated $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is already the number of molecules for an area of $1\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. The density of ATP hydrolysis, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, is thus:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{A} = \\frac{Q}{3eA} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into this expression:\n$Q = 5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$A = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$\n\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{3 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{cm^2})} $$\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-12}}{4.806529902 \\times 10^{-19}}\\,\\mathrm{molecules/cm^2} $$\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\approx 10402492.2\\,\\mathrm{molecules/cm^2} $$\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\approx 1.04024922 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{molecules/cm^2} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\approx 1.040 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{molecules/cm^2} $$\nThis is the minimal number of ATP molecules that must be hydrolyzed per square centimeter to remove the sodium load.",

Consider a capillary segment where the hydraulic conductivity of the barrier is $L_p = 1\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m/(Pa\\cdot s)}$ and the available exchange surface area is $S = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$. The capillary hydrostatic pressure exceeds the interstitial hydrostatic pressure by $P_c - P_i = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.

The context of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a valid and important area of biophysical modeling. The parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity, pressure gradients, and reflection coefficient, are the correct variables for this model. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($L_p, S, P_c - P_i, \\sigma, \\pi_c - \\pi_i$) required to calculate the volumetric flux $J_v$ using the specified physical principle. The question is unambiguous and asks for a symbolic expression and a a specific numerical value, which can be uniquely determined from the givens.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The units provided are consistent within the SI system ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\mathrm{s}$). There are no contradictions in the provided data. Although the calculated outcome (net fluid absorption) might seem counterintuitive to the generalized understanding of edema in TBI, the specific values given are physically plausible and lead to a definite mathematical result. The problem does not claim that the given values are universally representative of all TBI cases, but presents a specific scenario to be analyzed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe Starling principle quantifies the net volumetric fluid flux ($J_v$) across a capillary wall as a function of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients. The equation is given by:\n$$J_v = L_p S ( \\Delta P_{net} )$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the capillary wall, $S$ is the surface area for exchange, and $\\Delta P_{net}$ is the net driving pressure across the barrier.\n\nThe net driving pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the effective colloid osmotic pressure gradient. The problem specifies a sign convention where flux from the capillary to the interstitium is positive.\n- The hydrostatic pressure difference, $P_c - P_i$, drives fluid out of the capillary, so it contributes positively to $J_v$.\n- The colloid osmotic pressure difference, $\\pi_c - \\pi_i$, pulls fluid into the capillary, thus opposing filtration and contributing negatively to $J_v$. This effect is scaled by the osmotic reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, which represents the effectiveness of the solute in exerting an osmotic force.\n\nThus, the net driving pressure is:\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$$\n\nCombining these, the first part of the task is to express the net volumetric flux $J_v$. The expression is:\n$$J_v = L_p S [ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) ]$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate $J_v$ numerically using the provided values.\n- $L_p = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m/(Pa\\cdot s)}$\n- $S = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$\n- $P_c - P_i = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\sigma = 0.9$\n- $\\pi_c - \\pi_i = 2000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $J_v$:\n$$J_v = (1 \\times 10^{-7}) (0.1) [ (1000) - (0.9)(2000) ]$$\nThe units for this calculation are $(\\mathrm{m/(Pa\\cdot s)}) \\times (\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (\\mathrm{Pa})$, which results in $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$, the correct unit for volumetric flux.\n\nFirst, calculate the term inside the brackets, which is the net driving pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = 1000 - 1800 = -800\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nA negative net pressure indicates that the net driving force is directed from the interstitium into the capillary, favoring fluid absorption rather than filtration.\n\nNow, calculate the final volumetric flux:\n$$J_v = (1 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 0.1) \\times (-800)$$\n$$J_v = (1 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (-800)$$\n$$J_v = -800 \\times 10^{-8}$$\n$$J_v = -8 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-8}$$\n$$J_v = -8 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to one significant figure. The calculated value is $-8 \\times 10^{-6}$, where the mantissa, $-8$, already has one significant figure. No further rounding is necessary. The negative sign indicates that the net fluid movement is into the capillary from the interstitium.",
