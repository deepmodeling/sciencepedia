This exercise  explores how a channelopathy affecting a key ion like potassium can disrupt this balance, altering neuronal excitability from the ground up. By applying the parallel conductance model, you will calculate the resulting shift in the resting potential, providing a quantitative understanding of how such mutations can move a neuron closer to its firing threshold.",

            "problem": "A neuron with a documented loss-of-function channelopathy in the delayed rectifier potassium channels exhibits a reduction in potassium conductance. Consider a single-compartment passive neuron model in which the only steady-state ionic pathways are a voltage-independent leak and a voltage-independent potassium pathway. The reversal potential for potassium is $E_{K}=-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the reversal potential for the leak is $E_{L}=-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Due to the channelopathy, the potassium conductance is reduced from $g_{K}=10\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ to $g_{K}=5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, while the leak conductance remains $g_{L}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Assume that there are no synaptic or injected currents and that both the leak and potassium currents are linear functions of membrane voltage.\n\nStarting from the fundamental membrane current balance at steady state and the definition of an ohmic ionic current, derive the resting membrane potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ after the reduction in $g_{K}$ and compute its value. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in millivolts (mV).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Model: Single-compartment passive neuron.\n- Ionic pathways: Voltage-independent leak and voltage-independent potassium pathway.\n- Current-voltage relationship: Linear (Ohmic) for both leak and potassium currents.\n- External currents: No synaptic or injected currents ($I_{\\text{ext}} = 0$).\n- Potassium reversal potential: $E_{K} = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- Leak reversal potential: $E_{L} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- Leak conductance density: $g_{L} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n- Post-channelopathy potassium conductance density: $g_{K} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being based on the standard parallel-conductance model of a neuronal membrane, a fundamental concept in cellular neurophysiology. The provided values for conductances and reversal potentials are within physiologically realistic ranges. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters to uniquely determine the resting membrane potential. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe resting membrane potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$, is defined as the steady-state membrane potential, $V_m$, at which the total transmembrane current, $I_{\\text{total}}$, is zero. For the described single-compartment model, the total current is the sum of the individual ionic currents across the membrane.\nThe total current density, $J_{\\text{total}}$, can be expressed as the sum of the potassium current density, $J_K$, and the leak current density, $J_L$. At steady state, this sum must be zero:\n$$J_{\\text{total}} = J_K + J_L = 0$$\nThe problem states that the currents are linear, which corresponds to an Ohmic relationship. The current density for a given ionic species `$i$` is defined as:\n$$J_i = g_i (V_m - E_i)$$\nwhere $g_i$ is the conductance density, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for that ion.\n\nApplying this definition to the potassium and leak currents yields:\n$$J_K = g_K (V_m - E_K)$$\n$$J_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the current balance equation at rest (where $V_m = V_{\\text{rest}}$) gives:\n$$g_K (V_{\\text{rest}} - E_K) + g_L (V_{\\text{rest}} - E_L) = 0$$\nThis equation is the formal representation of the problem's steady-state condition. To find the resting membrane potential, we must solve for $V_{\\text{rest}}$. We expand the terms:\n$$g_K V_{\\text{rest}} - g_K E_K + g_L V_{\\text{rest}} - g_L E_L = 0$$\nNext, we group terms containing $V_{\\text{rest}}$:\n$$(g_K + g_L) V_{\\text{rest}} = g_K E_K + g_L E_L$$\nIsolating $V_{\\text{rest}}$ provides the general formula for the resting potential in this two-component system:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{g_K E_K + g_L E_L}{g_K + g_L}$$\nThis equation shows that the resting potential is a weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the weights are the respective conductances.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values for the post-channelopathy state:\n- $g_{K} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $g_{L} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $E_{K} = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $E_{L} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{(5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}$$\nThe units of conductance density ($\\mathrm{mS}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$) cancel out, leaving the result in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$), as expected.\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{-450 - 32.5}{5.5}\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{-482.5}{5.5}\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} \\approx -87.727272...\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} \\approx -87.73\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThis result indicates that the reduction in potassium conductance from the normal value has caused the resting membrane potential to depolarize (become less negative) from what it would have been, moving closer to the leak reversal potential, $E_L$. This is a direct consequence of the decreased relative contribution of the potassium conductance to the total membrane conductance.",
