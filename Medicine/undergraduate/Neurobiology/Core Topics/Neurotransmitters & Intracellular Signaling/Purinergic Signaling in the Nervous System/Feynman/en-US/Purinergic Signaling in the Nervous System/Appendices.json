The context, purinergic signaling, is a valid and significant topic in neurobiology. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe binding of a ligand $L$ to a receptor $R$ to form a complex $LR$ is described by the reaction:\n$$ L + R \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} LR $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of association (forward reaction) is proportional to the concentrations of the free ligand and free receptor:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = k_{on} [L] [R] $$\nThe rate of dissociation (reverse reaction) is proportional to the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} = k_{off} [LR] $$\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$ k_{on} [L] [R] = k_{off} [LR] $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of concentrations of products to reactants for the dissociation reaction $LR \\rightleftharpoons L + R$. From the equilibrium condition, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio that defines $K_D$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} $$\nWe are given the values for the rate constants: $k_{off} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{on} = 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We substitute these values to calculate $K_D$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{0.5 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{M} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe problem requires $K_D$ to be expressed in nanomolar ($\\mathrm{nM}$). We use the conversion factor $1 \\, \\mathrm{M} = 10^{9} \\, \\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$ K_D = (5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{M}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{9} \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{M}}\\right) = 5 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{nM} = 500 \\, \\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe problem asks for this value to be reported to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $500$. To explicitly denote three significant figures, we can write this as $5.00 \\times 10^2 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nNext, we determine the equilibrium fractional occupancy, $\\theta$. Fractional occupancy is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound to the ligand:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nThe total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free receptors and the ligand-bound receptors:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [LR] $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R] + [LR]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we use the definition of $K_D$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [LR]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{\\frac{K_D [LR]}{[L]} + [LR]} $$\nWe can factor out $[LR]$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[LR] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ gives the standard Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} $$\nWe are given the free ligand concentration $[L] = 1 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

This exercise explores the powerful, nonlinear nature of synaptic modulation, where a modest change in an input signal can cause a dramatic change in output.

Assume that the effective number of calcium ions required to trigger fusion under these conditions is four, so that the fusion rate scales with the fourth power of the presynaptic calcium concentration.\n\nStarting from the accepted biophysical principle that, near a release site, the local free calcium concentration is approximately proportional to calcium influx through presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and that cooperative binding of $m$ identical ligands to a sensor yields a reaction rate proportional to $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{m}$ under mass-action conditions, derive the fractional reduction in the fusion rate when A1R activation lowers presynaptic calcium entry by $30\\%$. Compute the numerical value of this fractional reduction.\n\nExpress your final answer as a unitless decimal fraction, and round your answer to four significant figures.",

It describes a canonical mechanism in synaptic physiology—the cooperative action of calcium in neurotransmitter release and its modulation—using established biophysical principles. The data provided are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nLet $R$ denote the instantaneous rate of synaptic vesicle fusion. Let $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ denote the local free calcium concentration at the presynaptic release site. Let $I_{Ca}$ denote the calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels.\n\nThe problem states two key relationships:\n1. The fusion rate $R$ scales with the fourth power of the presynaptic calcium concentration. This is due to a cooperative binding process requiring an effective number of $m=4$ calcium ions. Under mass-action kinetics, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$R \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{4}$$\nThis can be written as an equation with a proportionality constant, $k_1$:\n$$R = k_1 [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{4}$$\n\n2.

This can be expressed with a proportionality constant, $k_2$:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\propto I_{Ca}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = k_2 I_{Ca}$$\n\nWe can combine these two relationships by substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ from the second equation into the first equation:\n$$R = k_1 (k_2 I_{Ca})^{4} = k_1 k_2^{4} (I_{Ca})^{4}$$\nLet us define a new composite constant $k = k_1 k_2^{4}$. The relationship between the fusion rate and calcium influx is then:\n$$R = k (I_{Ca})^{4}$$\n\nNow, we analyze the system under two conditions: the initial (control) state and the final state after Adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation. Let the initial fusion rate and calcium influx be $R_0$ and $I_{Ca,0}$, respectively. Let the final fusion rate and calcium influx be $R_1$ and $I_{Ca,1}$.\n\nThe relationship in the initial state is:\n$$R_0 = k (I_{Ca,0})^{4}$$\n\nAccording to the problem, A1R activation lowers presynaptic calcium entry by $30\\%$. This means the new calcium influx $I_{Ca,1}$ is $30\\%$ less than the original influx $I_{Ca,0}$. We can write this as:\n$$I_{Ca,1} = I_{Ca,0} - 0.30 \\times I_{Ca,0} = (1 - 0.30) I_{Ca,0} = 0.70 I_{Ca,0}$$\n\nThe fusion rate in the final state, $R_1$, is then given by:\n$$R_1 = k (I_{Ca,1})^{4} = k (0.70 I_{Ca,0})^{4}$$\n$$R_1 = k (0.70)^{4} (I_{Ca,0})^{4}$$\nBy substituting $R_0 = k (I_{Ca,0})^{4}$, we can express $R_1$ in terms of $R_0$:\n$$R_1 = (0.70)^{4} R_0$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in the fusion rate. The fractional reduction, which we can denote as $F_R$, is defined as the absolute reduction in the rate $(R_0 - R_1)$ divided by the original rate $R_0$:\n$$F_R = \\frac{R_0 - R_1}{R_0}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_1$ into this equation:\n$$F_R = \\frac{R_0 - (0.70)^{4} R_0}{R_0}$$\nFactoring out $R_0$ from the numerator:\n$$F_R = \\frac{R_0 (1 - (0.70)^{4})}{R_0}$$\nThe term $R_0$ cancels out, provided $R_0 \\neq 0$:\n$$F_R = 1 - (0.70)^{4}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$(0.70)^{4} = 0.70 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.70 = 0.49 \\times 0.49 = 0.2401$$\nTherefore, the fractional reduction is:\n$$F_R = 1 - 0.2401 = 0.7599$$\nThis value has four significant figures as required.
