This exercise  lays the groundwork by modeling the neuron as a simple, \"well-mixed\" compartment where spatial variations are ignored. By establishing a balance between a constant rate of synthesis ($J_s$) and a degradation rate proportional to concentration ($k_d C$), you will derive the steady-state concentration of cAMP, illustrating the fundamental principle of dynamic equilibrium that governs all signaling pathways.",

            "problem": "In a neuron, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is synthesized by adenylyl cyclase upon sustained activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and degraded by phosphodiesterase (PDE). Consider a single, well-mixed compartment such that spatial gradients can be neglected and the volume is constant. Suppose that sustained GPCR activation clamps the net cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclase to a constant rate per unit volume denoted by $J_s$ (with units of concentration per unit time), and that PDE-mediated degradation of cAMP follows first-order kinetics with rate constant $k_d$ (with units of inverse time), so that the degradation flux per unit volume is proportional to the instantaneous cAMP concentration. Let $C(t)$ denote the concentration of cAMP as a function of time.\n\nStarting exclusively from conservation of mass for a well-mixed compartment and the stated kinetic assumptions, derive an explicit expression for the steady-state concentration of cAMP, defined as the time-independent concentration $C^{\\ast}$ that results when synthesis and degradation balance exactly. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $J_s$ and $k_d$. Do not include units in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), denoted as $C^{\\ast}$, based on a mass-balance model in a well-mixed neuronal compartment. The derivation will start from the principle of conservation of mass and the provided kinetic laws for synthesis and degradation.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing ordinary differential equation for the concentration of cAMP, $C(t)$. The principle of conservation of mass for a species in a well-mixed compartment of constant volume states that the rate of change of its concentration is equal to the sum of all synthesis rates per unit volume minus the sum of all degradation rates per unit volume.\n\nLet $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$ be the rate of change of the cAMP concentration over time.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n1.  The synthesis of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase is clamped at a constant rate per unit volume, which we denote as $J_s$. This represents the influx term.\n    Rate of Synthesis = $J_s$\n2.  The degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterase (PDE) follows first-order kinetics. This means the degradation flux per unit volume is directly proportional to the instantaneous cAMP concentration, $C(t)$. The proportionality constant is the rate constant $k_d$. This represents the outflux term.\n    Rate of Degradation = $k_d C(t)$\n\nCombining these terms, the mass-balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\text{(Rate of Synthesis)} - \\text{(Rate of Degradation)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given kinetic expressions, we obtain the differential equation for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = J_s - k_d C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration, $C^{\\ast}$. The steady state is defined as the condition where the concentration no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the time derivative of the concentration is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration $C(t)$ becomes the time-independent steady-state concentration $C^{\\ast}$. We can substitute this condition into our governing differential equation:\n$$\n0 = J_s - k_d C^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis equation signifies that at steady state, the rate of synthesis is exactly balanced by the rate of degradation.\n\nTo find the expression for $C^{\\ast}$, we solve this algebraic equation for $C^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nk_d C^{\\ast} = J_s\n$$\nDividing both sides by the degradation rate constant $k_d$ (which must be non-zero for degradation to occur, $k_d > 0$), we isolate $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\frac{J_s}{k_d}\n$$\nThis expression represents the steady-state concentration of cAMP as a function of the constant synthesis rate $J_s$ and the first-order degradation rate constant $k_d$. The units are consistent: $J_s$ has units of concentration/time, and $k_d$ has units of $1$/time, so their ratio has units of concentration, as expected for $C^{\\ast}$.",
