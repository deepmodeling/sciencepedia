I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total current through the $GABA_A$ receptor, $I_{GABA}$, is the sum of the currents carried by chloride ions, $I_{\\text{Cl}}$, and bicarbonate ions, $I_{\\text{HCO}_3}$.\n$$I_{GABA} = I_{\\text{Cl}} + I_{\\text{HCO}_3}$$\nBoth $\\text{Cl}^-$ and $\\text{HCO}_3^-$ are monovalent anions, so their valence is $z=-1$. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation for a generic monovalent anion 'A' is:\n$$I_A = P_A z^2 \\frac{V_m F^2}{RT} \\frac{[A]_i - [A]_o \\exp(-zV_mF/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-zV_mF/RT)}$$\nSubstituting $z=-1$:\n$$I_A = P_A (-1)^2 \\frac{V_m F^2}{RT} \\frac{[A]_i - [A]_o \\exp(-(-1)V_mF/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-(-1)V_mF/RT)}$$\n$$I_A = P_A \\frac{V_m F^2}{RT} \\frac{[A]_i - [A]_o \\exp(V_mF/RT)}{1 - \\exp(V_mF/RT)}$$\nThe total current $I_{GABA}$ is therefore:\n$$I_{GABA} = \\frac{V_m F^2}{RT(1 - \\exp(V_mF/RT))} \\left( P_{\\text{Cl}}([\\text{Cl}^-]_i - [\\text{Cl}^-]_o \\exp(V_mF/RT)) + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}([\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i - [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o \\exp(V_mF/RT)) \\right)$$\nThe reversal potential, $E_{GABA}$, is defined as the membrane potential $V_m$ at which the net current $I_{GABA}$ is zero. For $I_{GABA}=0$ (and assuming $V_m \\neq 0$), the term in the large parentheses must be zero:\n$$ P_{\\text{Cl}}([\\text{Cl}^-]_i - [\\text{Cl}^-]_o \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT)) + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}([\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i - [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT)) = 0 $$\nTo solve for $E_{GABA}$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$ P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i = P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_o \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT) + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT) $$\nFactor out the exponential term:\n$$ P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i = \\left( P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_o + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o \\right) \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT) $$\nIsolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp(E_{GABA}F/RT) = \\frac{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i}{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_o + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $E_{GABA}$ yields the desired expression for the mixed-anion reversal potential:\n$$ E_{GABA} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i}{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^-]_o + P_{\\text{HCO}_3}[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the GHK voltage equation generalized for multiple monovalent anions.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $E_{GABA}$. To use the given permeability ratio $P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}}$, we divide the numerator and the denominator of the argument of the logarithm by $P_{\\text{Cl}}$:\n$$ E_{GABA} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + (P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}})[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i}{[\\text{Cl}^-]_o + (P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}})[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given values.\nThe term $RT/F$ is first calculated in volts:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310 \\, \\mathrm{K})}{96485 \\, \\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.026712 \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\nThen, we compute the argument of the logarithm using the given concentrations and permeability ratio:\n- Numerator: $[\\text{Cl}^-]_i + (P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}})[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_i = 10 + (0.2)(16) = 10 + 3.2 = 13.2$\n- Denominator: $[\\text{Cl}^-]_o + (P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}})[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_o = 120 + (0.2)(24) = 120 + 4.8 = 124.8$\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ E_{GABA} = (0.026712 \\, \\mathrm{V}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{13.2}{124.8} \\right) $$\n$$ E_{GABA} \\approx (0.026712 \\, \\mathrm{V}) \\ln(0.105769) $$\n$$ E_{GABA} \\approx (0.026712 \\, \\mathrm{V})(-2.24645) $$\n$$ E_{GABA} \\approx -0.059998 \\, \\mathrm{V} $$\nConverting to millivolts gives:\n$$ E_{GABA} \\approx -59.998 \\, \\mathrm{mV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ E_{GABA} = -60.0 \\, \\mathrm{mV} $$\nFinally, we must decide if the activation of $GABA_A$ receptors is depolarizing. A depolarizing event is one that makes the membrane potential less negative (i.e., moves it closer to $0 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$).\nThe resting membrane potential is given as $V_m = -70 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$.\nOur calculated reversal potential is $E_{GABA} = -60.0 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$.\nWhen a specific ion channel opens, the membrane potential $V_m$ is driven towards the reversal potential $E_{rev}$ for that channel.\nIn this case, since $V_m (-70 \\, \\mathrm{mV})  E_{GABA} (-60.0 \\, \\mathrm{mV})$, the membrane potential is more negative than the reversal potential. Upon receptor activation, the membrane potential will move from $-70 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-60.0 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$. This change to a less negative value is, by definition, a depolarization. Therefore, in this cell, $GABA_A$ receptor activation is depolarizing. It is worth noting that despite being depolarizing, this effect is still inhibitory because $E_{GABA}$ is well below the threshold for firing an action potential, and the opening of these channels increases membrane conductance, shunting other excitatory inputs.",

It does not violate any of the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe steady-state membrane potential, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$, of a neuron with multiple active conductances can be calculated using the parallel conductance model. At steady state, the sum of all ionic currents across the membrane is zero:\n$$\n\\sum_i I_i = 0\n$$\nEach current $I_i$ is given by $I_i = g_i (V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_i)$, where $g_i$ is the conductance and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for that ion channel type.\n\nFor this problem, the total current is the sum of the leak, excitatory (AMPA), and inhibitory (GABA-A) currents:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} + I_{\\mathrm{E}} + I_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = 0\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}) + g_{\\mathrm{E}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{E}}) + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ gives the weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the conductances are the weights:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{L}}E_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}E_{\\mathrm{E}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}}{g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}}\n$$\n\nAn input is considered \"inhibitory\" if it makes the neuron less likely to reach its spike threshold, $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the relevant potentials:\n- Resting potential: $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- GABA-A reversal potential: $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Spike threshold: $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nWe observe the relationship $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}  E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This is the classic condition for depolarizing shunting inhibition. Activating GABA-A channels alone from rest would depolarize the cell from $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, but this potential is still below the threshold of $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With the parameters given, concurrent GABA-A and AMPA conductances yield a steady-state membrane potential below spike threshold, because the added conductance shunts current and its reversal potential lies below threshold, even though it is depolarizing relative to rest.**\n\nLet's calculate the steady-state membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ when all three conductances are active:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(0\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (25\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-55\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 25\\,\\mathrm{nS}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{-650 - 1375}{40} \\,\\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{-2025}{40} \\,\\mathrm{mV} = -50.625\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThe calculated potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}} = -50.625\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is below the spike threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Without the GABA-A input, the potential would be:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m, no GABA}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{L}}E_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}E_{\\mathrm{E}}}{g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(0\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{-650}{15} \\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -43.33\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThis is well above the threshold, so the AMPA input alone would cause the neuron to spike. The addition of the GABA-A conductance prevents the spike.\nThe reasoning provided is also sound:\n1.  The added conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nS}$) is large and \"shunts\" (diverts) the excitatory current. This is reflected in the denominator of the $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ equation.\n2.  The GABA-A reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is below the spike threshold ($V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), so it pulls the membrane potential towards a value that is sub-threshold.\n3.  It is depolarizing relative to rest ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  E_{\\mathrm{L}}$).\nThe statement is quantitatively and conceptually correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A depolarizing GABA-A response increases the excitatory driving force, thereby increasing the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential, so it is not inhibitory.**\n\nThe driving force for the excitatory AMPA current is $(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{E}})$. The reversal potential is $E_{\\mathrm{E}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The resting potential is $E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. A depolarizing GABA-A response moves the membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ from rest towards $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. For any value of $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ between $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the membrane potential is closer to $E_{\\mathrm{E}}=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ than it was at rest. For example, at rest, the magnitude of the driving force is $|-65\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}| = 65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. After depolarization to $-60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the magnitude is $|-60\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}| = 60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The depolarization *decreases* the magnitude of the excitatory driving force, not increases it. A smaller driving force results in a smaller excitatory current for a given conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Opening GABA-A channels reduces input resistance, so the same excitatory synaptic current produces a smaller voltage change, which can prevent threshold crossing despite depolarization.**\n\nInput resistance is the inverse of the total conductance: $R_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1/g_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\nInitially, at rest, $g_{\\mathrm{total}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\nWhen GABA-A channels open, the total conductance increases: $g_{\\mathrm{total}}' = g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} (+ g_{\\mathrm{E}})$. For instance, with GABA-A and leak, $g_{\\mathrm{total}}' = 10+25 = 35\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. The increase in total conductance causes a decrease in input resistance.\nAccording to Ohm's Law in the context of a neuron, the change in membrane potential ($\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}}$) due to a synaptic current ($I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$) is approximated by $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}} = I_{\\mathrm{syn}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nIf $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is reduced, the same excitatory synaptic current will produce a smaller $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This effect, known as shunting, makes it harder for the excitatory input to depolarize the neuron to its threshold. This statement correctly describes the core mechanism of shunting inhibition.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Depolarizing GABA-B responses are inhibitory primarily because they open chloride channels whose reversal potential is above spike threshold.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors.\n1.  The problem states that GABA-B receptors activate \"G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels\", not chloride channels. GABA-A receptors activate chloride channels.\n2.  The response mediated by potassium channels is typically hyperpolarizing, not depolarizing, as the potassium reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{K}}$) is usually around $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, far below the resting potential of $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The premise \"Depolarizing GABA-B responses\" is therefore inconsistent with the standard mechanism described.\n3.  The reversal potential of the GABA-B mediated K+ current ($E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is far *below*, not above, the spike threshold ($V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\nThe statement conflates GABA-A and GABA-B mechanisms and is incorrect on every point.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Even when $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, if $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, GABA-A can be inhibitory by producing outward current at voltages near threshold and by decreasing the membrane time constant, thereby reducing temporal summation of coincident excitatory inputs.**\n\nThis statement proposes two mechanisms.\n1.  \"...producing outward current at voltages near threshold.\" The GABA-A current is $I_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}})$. Given $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. If an excitatory input drives the membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ into the range above $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ but below $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (i.e., \"near threshold\"), the driving force $(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}})$ becomes positive. This results in an outward current (positive charge leaving the cell, or negative charge entering), which opposes further depolarization and pushes $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ back towards $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, away from the threshold. This is a correct description of the inhibitory action.\n2.  \"...decreasing the membrane time constant, thereby reducing temporal summation...\". The membrane time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} C_{\\mathrm{m}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}}/g_{\\mathrm{total}}$, where $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the membrane capacitance. Opening GABA-A channels increases the total conductance $g_{\\mathrm{total}}$, which in turn decreases the time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. A shorter time constant means that synaptic potentials decay more rapidly. Faster decay reduces the window for temporal summation, making it less likely that successive or coincident excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) will sum to reach threshold. This is also a correct description of an aspect of shunting inhibition.\nBoth mechanisms described in the statement are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

Pertussis toxin (PTX) ADP-ribosylates the alpha subunit of $G_{i/o}$ ($G_{\\alpha i/o}$), preventing productive coupling between $GABA_B$ receptors and $G$ proteins. In the experiment, interneurons are stimulated to elicit slow IPSPs attributed to $GABA_B$ activation and fast IPSPs attributed to $GABA_A$ activation. In additional trials, baclofen is applied to selectively activate $GABA_B$ receptors, and paired-pulse stimulation (two pulses separated by $\\Delta t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) is used to assess presynaptic release via the paired-pulse ratio $PPR = EPSC_{2}/EPSC_{1}$ of excitatory postsynaptic currents.\n\nBased on the fundamental definitions above, predict how PTX treatment will alter slow IPSPs mediated by $GABA_B$ receptors and differentiate pre- versus postsynaptic consequences.

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core mechanism to analyze is the action of Pertussis toxin ($\\text{PTX}$). The problem states that $\\text{PTX}$ prevents the coupling between $GABA_B$ receptors and their associated $G_{i/o}$ proteins. This means that any signaling pathway downstream of $G_{i/o}$ protein activation by $GABA_B$ receptors will be blocked. We must analyze the consequences of this blockage on the postsynaptic and presynaptic functions mediated by $GABA_B$ receptors.\n\n**1. Postsynaptic Effects of $\\text{PTX}$**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** Postsynaptically, $GABA_B$ receptor activation by GABA or an agonist like baclofen leads to the activation of a $G_{i/o}$ protein. The dissociated $\\beta\\gamma$ subunits of the $G$ protein then directly bind to and open GIRK channels. Since the equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_K$) is more negative than the typical resting membrane potential, the opening of GIRK channels leads to an efflux of $K^{+}$ ions, causing a slow hyperpolarization of the membrane (the slow IPSP) and an increase in membrane conductance.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** By preventing the coupling of $GABA_B$ receptors to $G_{i/o}$ proteins, $\\text{PTX}$ abolishes this entire pathway. Agonist binding to the $GABA_B$ receptor will no longer lead to GIRK channel activation. Consequently, $\\text{PTX}$ treatment will eliminate the slow IPSP and the associated conductance increase normally produced by $GABA_B$ receptor activation.\n\n**2. Presynaptic Effects of $\\text{PTX}$**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** Presynaptically, $GABA_B$ receptors (acting as autoreceptors on GABAergic terminals or heteroreceptors on other terminals, such as glutamatergic ones) also couple to $G_{i/o}$ proteins. Their activation inhibits voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels. This reduction in $Ca^{2+}$ influx into the presynaptic terminal upon arrival of an action potential decreases the probability of neurotransmitter release ($P_{release}$).\n*   **Paired-Pulse Ratio ($PPR$):** The $PPR$, defined as $EPSC_{2}/EPSC_{1}$, is inversely related to the initial probability of release ($P_{release,1}$). When $P_{release,1}$ is low (as it would be under $GABA_B$-mediated presynaptic inhibition), the synapse is more likely to exhibit paired-pulse facilitation ($PPR  1$), because less vesicle depletion and/or residual $Ca^{2+}$ effects dominate. When $P_{release,1}$ is high, the synapse is more likely to exhibit paired-pulse depression ($PPR  1$), often due to vesicle pool depletion. Therefore, activation of presynaptic $GABA_B$ receptors decreases $P_{release,1}$ and thus *increases* the $PPR$.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** $\\text{PTX}$ blocks the $G_{i/o}$ signaling that mediates this presynaptic inhibition. As a result, $GABA_B$ receptors can no longer suppress $Ca^{2+}$ channel activity. This eliminates the presynaptic inhibition. The probability of transmitter release ($P_{release,1}$) will therefore be higher than it would be in the presence of $GABA_B$ activity. This increase in $P_{release,1}$ will lead to a *decrease* in the $PPR$ (i.e., a reduction of paired-pulse facilitation or an enhancement of paired-pulse depression).\n\n**3. Effects on $GABA_A$ Receptors**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** $GABA_A$ receptors are ionotropic receptors, meaning they are ligand-gated ion channels. Their function—gating a $Cl^{-}$conductance to produce a fast IPSP—is direct and does not involve G-proteins.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** Since $\\text{PTX}$ is specific for $G_{i/o}$ proteins, it has no known direct mechanism of action on ionotropic receptors like the $GABA_A$ receptor. Therefore, $\\text{PTX}$ is not expected to affect the fast IPSPs mediated by $GABA_A$ receptors.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. PTX abolishes the baclofen-induced slow hyperpolarization and its associated increase in membrane conductance because $GABA_B$–$G_{i/o}$ coupling to GIRK channels is disrupted.**\nThis statement accurately describes the postsynaptic effect. Baclofen is a $GABA_B$ agonist. The slow hyperpolarization (slow IPSP) and conductance increase are due to GIRK channel activation via the $GABA_B$–$G_{i/o}$ pathway. $\\text{PTX}$ disrupts this coupling, thereby abolishing the effect.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. PTX enhances presynaptic inhibition by $GABA_B$, further reducing $Ca^{2+}$ entry and transmitter release probability during the first pulse, thereby increasing $PPR$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. $\\text{PTX}$ *blocks* or *abolishes* $GABA_B$-mediated signaling; it does not enhance it. The predicted effects on $Ca^{2+}$ entry, release probability, and $PPR$ are the opposite of what would occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. PTX decreases $GABA_B$-mediated presynaptic inhibition, increasing glutamate release probability and reducing paired-pulse facilitation (i.e., lowers $PPR$ toward baseline).**\nThis statement accurately describes the presynaptic effect. By blocking presynaptic inhibition from $GABA_B$ receptors (which could be tonically active or activated by the experimental stimulation), $\\text{PTX}$ will cause an increase in the baseline probability of glutamate release. An increased release probability reduces paired-pulse facilitation, which is reflected as a lower $PPR$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. PTX does not affect fast IPSPs mediated by $GABA_A$ receptors.**\nThis statement is correct. The mechanism of action of $\\text{PTX}$ is specific to $G_{i/o}$ proteins. $GABA_A$ receptors are ionotropic and do not use this signaling pathway. Therefore, their function should be unaffected by $\\text{PTX}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. PTX converts the slow IPSP into a faster, larger $Cl^{-}$-dependent hyperpolarization by shifting receptor coupling from metabotropic to ionotropic signaling at $GABA_B$ receptors.**\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. $\\text{PTX}$ is an enzyme that chemically modifies a G-protein subunit. It does not possess the capability to fundamentally alter the structure and function of a receptor from metabotropic to ionotropic. This proposed mechanism is biologically implausible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
