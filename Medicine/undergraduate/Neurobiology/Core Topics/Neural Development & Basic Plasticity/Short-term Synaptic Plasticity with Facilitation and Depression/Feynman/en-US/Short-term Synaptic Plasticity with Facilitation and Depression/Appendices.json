            "problem": "A cortical synapse exhibits short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) characterized by activity-dependent depression and recovery of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles. Between presynaptic spikes, the fraction of available release resources, denoted by $R(t)$, recovers toward its baseline value $R=1$ with a single-exponential time course governed by the replenishment time constant $\\tau_d$. Specifically, in the absence of presynaptic spikes, $R(t)$ follows the first-order linear differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt}=\\frac{1-R}{\\tau_d}.\n$$\nAssume that the postsynaptic response amplitude is proportional to $R(t)$ and that the baseline response corresponds to $R=1$. A presynaptic high-frequency train of duration $1$ second at $50$ Hz is delivered, and you may assume this train is sufficiently strong to deplete the RRP so that immediately after the train ends (define this as $t=0$), the available fraction satisfies $R(0)=0$. After the end of the train, no further presynaptic spikes occur and recovery proceeds according to the equation above.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and equations, derive the time $t_{0.9}$ required for the response to recover to $0.9$ of baseline, that is, the smallest $t>0$ such that $R(t)=0.9$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The fraction of available release resources is denoted by $R(t)$.\n- The recovery time constant is $\\tau_d$.\n- The governing differential equation for recovery in the absence of spikes is $\\frac{dR}{dt}=\\frac{1-R}{\\tau_d}$.\n- The baseline value of the available fraction is $R=1$.\n- At time $t=0$, which is defined as immediately after the end of a high-frequency spike train, the initial condition is $R(0)=0$.\n- The goal is to find the time $t_{0.9}$ such that $R(t_{0.9}) = 0.9$.\n- The answer must be a closed-form analytical expression in terms of $\\tau_d$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a simplified, but standard and widely used, model of short-term synaptic depression and recovery. The differential equation $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{1-R}{\\tau_d}$ is a classic first-order kinetic model for a process approaching an equilibrium value (here, $R=1$) with a characteristic time constant ($\\tau_d$). This model is a cornerstone of phenomenological models of synaptic plasticity, such as the Tsodyks-Markram model. The scenario is scientifically sound and relevant to computational neuroscience and biophysics.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem constitutes a well-posed initial value problem (IVP). It provides a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a corresponding initial condition, $R(0)=0$. Such an IVP has a unique solution for $R(t)$. The question asks to find the time at which this function reaches a specific value ($0.9$). Since $R(t)$ starts at $0$ and asymptotically approaches $1$, it will pass through $0.9$ at exactly one positive time $t$. The solution is unique, stable, and meaningful.\n\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and scientific terminology. All quantities are clearly defined. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information to find the solution. The ODE, the initial condition, and the target value are all explicitly stated. The information regarding the stimulus train ($50$ Hz for $1$ second) serves as a physical justification for the initial condition $R(0)=0$ and does not introduce any contradictions.\n\n5.  **Feasibility**: The assumption that $R(0)=0$ (complete depletion) is an idealization, but it is a common simplifying assumption in theoretical models to facilitate analysis. It represents an extreme case of strong synaptic depression and does not render the problem scientifically implausible or physically impossible within the context of a mathematical model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. It is a valid and solvable problem. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe recovery of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, $R(t)$, is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{1-R}{\\tau_d}\n$$\nThis equation is subject to the initial condition that the resources are fully depleted at $t=0$:\n$$\nR(0) = 0\n$$\nTo find the function $R(t)$, we solve this differential equation. It is a separable equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $R$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{1-R} = \\frac{dt}{\\tau_d}\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial state $(t', R') = (0, R(0)=0)$ to an arbitrary state $(t, R(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{R(0)}^{R(t)} \\frac{1}{1-R'} dR' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{\\tau_d} dt'\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $R(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{R(t)} \\frac{1}{1-R'} dR' = \\frac{1}{\\tau_d} \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThe integral on the left-hand side is $[-\\ln(1-R')]_{0}^{R(t)}$. For the recovery process, $R(t)$ will be between $0$ and $1$, so $1-R'$ is always positive and the absolute value is not needed. The integral on the right-hand side is $[\\frac{t'}{\\tau_d}]_{0}^{t}$.\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$\n-\\ln(1-R(t)) - (-\\ln(1-0)) = \\frac{t}{\\tau_d} - 0\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\ln(1-R(t)) = \\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\n$$\nTo find the explicit form of $R(t)$, we solve for $R(t)$. First, multiply by $-1$:\n$$\n\\ln(1-R(t)) = -\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\n$$\nThen, exponentiate both sides (with base $e$):\n$$\n1-R(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, isolate $R(t)$:\n$$\nR(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation describes the time course of recovery from complete depletion. Now, we must find the time $t_{0.9}$ at which the response has recovered to $0.9$ of its baseline value. This corresponds to finding the time $t$ for which $R(t)=0.9$. We set $R(t_{0.9})=0.9$ in our solution:\n$$\n0.9 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_d}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we solve for $t_{0.9}$. Rearranging the equation to isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_d}\\right) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{0.9}$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_d}\\right)\\right) = \\ln(0.1)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_d} = \\ln(0.1)\n$$\nThe natural logarithm of $0.1$ can be written as $\\ln(1/10) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)$.\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_d} = -\\ln(10)\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-\\tau_d$ gives the final expression for $t_{0.9}$:\n$$\nt_{0.9} = \\tau_d \\ln(10)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the time required for the resource pool to recover to $90\\%$ of its baseline value, expressed in terms of the recovery time constant $\\tau_d$. The unit of $t_{0.9}$ will be the same as the unit of $\\tau_d$, which is seconds.",

            "problem": "Short-term synaptic plasticity arises from two biophysical processes that transiently modify synaptic efficacy in response to closely spaced presynaptic action potentials: facilitation and vesicle depletion (depression). Consider a single synapse in which the postsynaptic response amplitude to the $n$-th presynaptic spike, denoted $A_{n}$, is proportional to the product of two state variables evaluated at the time of that spike: the instantaneous release probability $u_{n}$ and the fraction of readily releasable vesicles $x_{n}$.

We substitute the expressions for $u_{\\infty}^{+}$ and $x_{\\infty}^{-}$.\n$$ A_{\\infty}(f) = A_{0}\\,u_{\\infty}^{+}(f) \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))}{1 - (1 - u_{\\infty}^{+}(f))\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))} $$\nTo obtain a single closed-form expression, we can rearrange this as:\n$$ A_{\\infty}(f)/A_0 = \\frac{u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)(1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d)))}{1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d)) + u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)$:\n$$ A_{\\infty}(f)/A_0 = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))}{\\frac{1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))}{u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)} + \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)} = \\frac{1 - (1-U)\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_f))}{U} $$\nThus,\n$$ A_{\\infty}(f) = A_{0} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))}{\\frac{(1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d)))(1 - (1-U)\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_f)))}{U} + \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))} $$\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by $U$:\n$$ A_{\\infty}(f) = A_{0} \\frac{U(1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d)))}{(1 - \\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d)))(1 - (1-U)\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_f))) + U\\exp(-1/(f\\tau_d))} $$\nLet's simplify the denominator, using $\\Delta t = 1/f$:\nDenominator $= (1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}) - (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f}(1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}) + Ue^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}$\n$= 1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d} - (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f} + (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f}e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d} + Ue^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}$\n$= 1 - (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f} + (-1+U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d} + (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f}e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}$\n$= 1 - (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f} - (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d} + (1-U)e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_f}e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_d}$\n$= 1 - (1-U)\\left[e^{-1/(f\\tau_f)} + e^{-1/(f\\tau_d)} - e^{-1/(f\\tau_f)}e^{-1/(f\\tau_d)}\\right]$\n$= 1 - (1-U)\\left[ e^{-1/(f\\tau_f)} + e^{-1/(f\\tau_d)} - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_f} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_d}\\right)\\right) \\right]$\nThis gives the final expression for $A_{\\infty}(f)$.\n\n**4. Qualitative Analysis of Gain $G(f)$**\nThe dimensionless gain is $G(f) = A_{\\infty}(f)/A_0 = u_{\\infty}^{+}(f) x_{\\infty}^{-}(f)$.\n- $u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)$ is a monotonically increasing function of frequency $f$. It starts at $u_{\\infty}^{+}(0) = U$ and saturates at $u_{\\infty}^{+}(\\infty) = 1$. This represents the accumulation of facilitation.\n- $x_{\\infty}^{-}(f)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of frequency $f$. It starts at $x_{\\infty}^{-}(0) = 1$ and decays to $x_{\\infty}^{-}(\\infty) = 0$. This represents the accumulation of depression.\n- The behavior of $G(f)$ is determined by the product of these two opposing effects.\n\n**Facilitation-dominated regime (small $U$, large $\\tau_f$ relative to $\\tau_d$):**\n- With small $U$, the initial gain $G(0)=U$ is low, providing a large dynamic range for facilitation.\n- With a large facilitation time constant $\\tau_f$, the variable $u$ builds up rapidly with increasing frequency.\n- The depression time constant $\\tau_d$ is relatively small, meaning resource recovery is fast. Thus, $x_{\\infty}^{-}(f)$ decreases slowly at low frequencies.\n- The initial rise in $u_{\\infty}^{+}(f)$ dominates the slow fall in $x_{\\infty}^{-}(f)$, causing the overall gain $G(f)$ to increase with $f$ at low frequencies.\n- At higher frequencies, resource depletion becomes significant ($x_{\\infty}^{-}(f) \\to 0$ as $f \\to \\infty$), causing the gain to fall.\n- The combination of an initial increase and eventual decrease means $G(f)$ will exhibit a peak at an intermediate, optimal frequency. This synapse acts as a **band-pass filter**.\n\n**Depression-dominated regime (large $U$, large $\\tau_d$ relative to $\\tau_f$):**\n- With a large $U$, the initial gain $G(0)=U$ is high. There is little room for further facilitation as $u$ is already close to $1$.\n- The large depression time constant $\\tau_d$ means resource recovery is slow. Even a modest increase in frequency will cause significant resource depletion.\n- The strong effect of depression (due to large $U$ and slow recovery) dominates the weak effect of facilitation.\n- Consequently, $G(f)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of frequency. The synapse acts as a **low-pass filter**.\n\n**Limiting Behaviors:**\n- Low frequency limit ($f \\to 0$, $\\Delta t \\to \\infty$): Spike-history effects vanish. $u_{\\infty}^{+} \\to U$ and $x_{\\infty}^{-} \\to 1$. The gain becomes $G(f) \\to U$, so $A_{\\infty}(f) \\to A_{0}U$. The response is determined solely by the baseline utilization.\n- High frequency limit ($f \\to \\infty$, $\\Delta t \\to 0$): Facilitation saturates ($u_{\\infty}^{+} \\to 1$), but resources are heavily depleted. As derived in the thought process, $x_{\\infty}^{-} \\approx 1/(f\\tau_d)$. The gain becomes $G(f) \\approx 1/(f\\tau_d)$, so $A_{\\infty}(f) \\approx A_{0}/(f\\tau_d)$. The response amplitude is limited by the rate of resource recovery and decays as $1/f$.",
