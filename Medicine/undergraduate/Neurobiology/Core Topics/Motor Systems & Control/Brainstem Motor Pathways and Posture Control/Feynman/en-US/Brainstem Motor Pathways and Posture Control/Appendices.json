            "problem": "A sudden backward tilt of the head elicits a corrective activation of trunk extensor motoneurons via a brainstem-mediated pathway dominated by the lateral vestibulospinal tract. Consider a simplified, biophysically plausible model in which the earliest efferent signal that will produce an action potential in a spinal motoneuron follows a single effective route with the following properties: the signal propagates along myelinated axons for a total path length $L$ (the sum of the afferent and descending segments) with uniform axonal conduction velocity $v$, and it crosses $n$ chemical synapses en route from the first afferent spike to the motoneuron’s axon hillock. Assume that each chemical synapse imposes a fixed synaptic transmission delay of $\\delta$, that synaptic and conduction delays add linearly because stages are sequential and non-overlapping, and that any receptor transduction time and dendritic integration time are negligible relative to the conduction and synaptic delays. Ignore neuromuscular junction transmission and muscle electromechanical coupling by defining the response time as the latency to the motoneuron action potential initiation.\n\nStarting only from the definitions that time equals distance divided by speed for axonal conduction and that sequential delays sum, derive the expected response latency $T$ from perturbation onset to motoneuron action potential as a function of $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$. Express your final result in seconds as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that asks for the derivation of a response latency in a simplified neurobiological model. The premises are physically and biologically plausible for a first-order approximation, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe total response latency, which we denote as $T$, is the time elapsed from the initial perturbation to the initiation of the motoneuron action potential. The problem states that this total latency can be modeled as the linear sum of sequential, non-overlapping delays. The two sources of delay specified in the model are axonal conduction and synaptic transmission.\n\nLet $T_{\\text{cond}}$ be the total delay due to axonal conduction and $T_{\\text{syn}}$ be the total delay due to synaptic transmission. The total latency $T$ is therefore given by the sum:\n$$T = T_{\\text{cond}} + T_{\\text{syn}}$$\n\nWe will now derive an expression for each component based on the givens.\n\nFirst, we consider the axonal conduction delay, $T_{\\text{cond}}$. The problem specifies that the neural signal propagates along a total path length of $L$ with a uniform conduction velocity $v$. The problem requires us to use the definition that time equals distance divided by speed. Applying this principle, the time required for the signal to travel the entire axonal length is:\n$$T_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nNext, we consider the synaptic transmission delay, $T_{\\text{syn}}$. The signal path involves crossing $n$ chemical synapses. Each synapse is assumed to introduce a fixed transmission delay of $\\delta$. Since these synaptic crossings occur sequentially, their individual delays sum to give the total synaptic delay. Therefore, the total delay contributed by all synapses is the number of synapses, $n$, multiplied by the delay per synapse, $\\delta$:\n$$T_{\\text{syn}} = n\\delta$$\n\nFinally, to find the total response latency $T$, we substitute the expressions for $T_{\\text{cond}}$ and $T_{\\text{syn}}$ into our initial summation equation. This yields the complete expression for the latency as a function of the given parameters $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v} + n\\delta$$\n\nThis expression represents the total time from the start of the reflex arc to the firing of the final motoneuron, under the simplifying assumptions of the model. The units are consistent: if $L$ is in meters ($m$), $v$ in meters per second ($m/s$), and $\\delta$ in seconds ($s$), then the term $\\frac{L}{v}$ has units of seconds, and the term $n\\delta$ also has units of seconds, resulting in a total latency $T$ in seconds, as required.",

Do not approximate trigonometric functions and do not round your answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the ankle extensor torque commanded by a neurologically-inspired controller for posture stabilization. The system is modeled as a single-link inverted pendulum, which is a standard and appropriate simplification for analyzing postural sway in the frontal plane under quasi-static conditions.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the destabilizing torque exerted by gravity on the body due to the tilt. The gravitational force, with magnitude $F_g = mg$, acts vertically downwards on the center of mass (COM). The COM is located at a distance $h$ from the pivot point, which is the ankle joint. The body is tilted by an angle $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$ with respect to the vertical.\n\nThe torque, $\\tau$, is defined by the cross product of the lever arm vector, $\\vec{r}$, and the force vector, $\\vec{F}$: $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$. The magnitude of the torque is given by $|\\vec{\\tau}| = |\\vec{r}| |\\vec{F}| \\sin(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the angle between the vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$.\n\nIn this specific case:\n- The lever arm vector $\\vec{r}$ extends from the ankle pivot to the COM. Its magnitude is $|\\vec{r}| = h$.\n- The force vector $\\vec{F}$ is the gravitational force, with magnitude $|\\vec{F}| = mg$.\n- The angle $\\phi$ between the lever arm (which is aligned with the tilted body) and the vertical gravitational force is the tilt angle, $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$.\n\nSubstituting these quantities into the torque magnitude equation gives the magnitude of the destabilizing gravitational torque, $\\tau_g$:\n$$ \\tau_g = h (mg) \\sin(\\theta) $$\nGiven that the tilt angle is $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$, the expression for the gravitational torque is:\n$$ \\tau_g = mgh \\sin(5^{\\circ}) $$\nThis torque acts in the direction that would increase the tilt, hence it is \"destabilizing\".\n\nThe problem states that the lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) controller generates a corrective ankle extensor torque, which we denote as $\\tau_{LVST}$. This controller operates on a principle of proportional control. Specifically, the commanded torque is proportional to the magnitude of the destabilizing gravitational torque, $\\tau_g$. The constant of proportionality is the dimensionless gain, $G$.\n\nThis control law can be written as:\n$$ \\tau_{LVST} = G \\cdot \\tau_g $$\n\nTo find the expression for the commanded torque, we substitute the expression for $\\tau_g$ into the control law equation:\n$$ \\tau_{LVST} = G \\left( mgh \\sin(5^{\\circ}) \\right) $$\n\nThe problem is considered under quasi-static conditions, which implies that angular accelerations are negligible. This validates the use of a static torque balance to define the stimulus ($\\tau_g$) for the controller. The question asks for the torque that the LVST controller *would command*, which is precisely the output of the control law, $\\tau_{LVST}$.\n\nThus, the final expression for the commanded ankle extensor torque is $G m g h \\sin(5^{\\circ})$.",
