            "introduction": "The physiological effects of cortisol are not monolithic; they are carefully graded based on the hormone's concentration. This is made possible by the existence of two distinct intracellular receptors, the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), which possess different affinities for cortisol. This practice will guide you through a quantitative exploration of how these different affinities lead to differential receptor occupancy across the physiological range of cortisol concentrations, providing a molecular basis for how cells distinguish between the low cortisol levels of daily rhythms and the high levels during an acute stress response .",

            "problem": "A central feature of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is the regulation of target tissue responses by steroid hormone binding to receptors. Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal cortex, binds both the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). At equilibrium, binding of a ligand to a receptor can be modeled by the law of mass action. Consider a single ligand species with free concentration $F$ (units nM), a receptor with total concentration $[R_T]$, free receptor concentration $[R]$, and receptor-ligand complex concentration $[RF]$. The equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined by $K_d = \\frac{[R][F]}{[RF]}$. The receptor occupancy is defined as the fraction of receptors bound by ligand, $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$. \n\nUsing these fundamental definitions, derive the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of $F$ and $K_d$ for a single binding site receptor, and then apply the result to compute and compare the occupancies of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor and the Glucocorticoid Receptor across physiologically plausible free cortisol concentrations. Assume cortisol’s equilibrium dissociation constants are $K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}} = 1$\\,nM and $K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}} = 25$\\,nM for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor and the Glucocorticoid Receptor, respectively. \n\nFor the purposes of explicit calculation, take a basal free cortisol level $F_b = 5$\\,nM representative of non-stressed conditions and a stress-elevated free cortisol level $F_s = 100$\\,nM within the range $F \\in [1, 500]$ nM. Compute the Mineralocorticoid Receptor occupancy at $F_b$ and $F_s$, and the Glucocorticoid Receptor occupancy at $F_b$ and $F_s$. Based on these computations and the dependence of occupancy on $F$ and $K_d$, infer which receptor is predominantly engaged under basal versus stress levels.\n\nExpress the final occupancies as exact fractions, in the order $\\left(\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_b),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_b),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_s),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_s)\\right)$, and present them as a single row matrix.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and neuroendocrinology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe first step is to derive a general expression for receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, as a function of the free ligand concentration, $F$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental definitions:\n1. The equilibrium dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][F]}{[RF]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the free receptor concentration, $[F]$ is the free ligand concentration, and $[RF]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\n2. The receptor occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$$\nwhere $[R_T]$ is the total receptor concentration.\n\nA third, implicit relationship is the conservation of receptors. The total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, must be the sum of the free receptors and the ligand-bound receptors:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [RF]$$\n\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$ and $[RF]$:\n$$[R] = [R_T] - [RF]$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R_T] - [RF])[F]}{[RF]}$$\n\nThe goal is to find an expression for $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$. To do this, we rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio. First, multiply both sides by $[RF]$:\n$$K_d [RF] = ([R_T] - [RF])[F]$$\n\nDistribute $[F]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$K_d [RF] = [R_T][F] - [RF][F]$$\n\nGroup all terms containing $[RF]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_d [RF] + [RF][F] = [R_T][F]$$\n\nFactor out $[RF]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$[RF](K_d + F) = [R_T][F]$$\n\nTo obtain the occupancy ratio $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$, we divide both sides by $[R_T]$ and by $(K_d + F)$:\n$$\\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{F}{K_d + F}$$\n\nTherefore, the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of $F$ and $K_d$ is:\n$$\\theta(F) = \\frac{F}{F + K_d}$$\nThis relationship is known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the occupancies for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) at basal and stress-induced cortisol levels.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- MR dissociation constant: $K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}} = 1$\\,nM\n- GR dissociation constant: $K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}} = 25$\\,nM\n- Basal free cortisol level: $F_b = 5$\\,nM\n- Stress-elevated free cortisol level: $F_s = 100$\\,nM\n\nWe now compute the four required occupancy values, which are dimensionless fractions.\n\n1.  **MR occupancy at basal cortisol level ($F_b$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_b) = \\frac{F_b}{F_b + K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}}} = \\frac{5}{5 + 1} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\n2.  **GR occupancy at basal cortisol level ($F_b$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_b) = \\frac{F_b}{F_b + K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}}} = \\frac{5}{5 + 25} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\n3.  **MR occupancy at stress cortisol level ($F_s$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_s) = \\frac{F_s}{F_s + K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 1} = \\frac{100}{101}$$\n\n4.  **GR occupancy at stress cortisol level ($F_s$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_s) = \\frac{F_s}{F_s + K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 25} = \\frac{100}{125} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nBased on these computations, we can infer the differential engagement of the receptors. At the basal cortisol level of $F_b = 5$\\,nM, the high-affinity MR is substantially occupied ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 5/6 \\approx 83.3\\%$), while the lower-affinity GR is sparsely occupied ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}} = 1/6 \\approx 16.7\\%$). This indicates that under basal, non-stressed conditions, cortisol's effects are primarily mediated by the Mineralocorticoid Receptor.\n\nAt the stress-elevated cortisol level of $F_s = 100$\\,nM, the MR is nearly saturated ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 100/101 \\approx 99\\%$). The most significant change is the dramatic increase in GR occupancy, which rises to $\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}} = 4/5 = 80\\%$. This shows that the large surge in cortisol during a stress response leads to a substantial engagement of the Glucocorticoid Receptor. Therefore, the GR is the primary mediator of the physiological response to high-concentration stress signals, while the MR is already near maximal engagement. This differential occupancy profile allows the HPA axis to have distinct responses to tonic (basal) and phasic (stress) hormone signals.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix of the four computed occupancies in the specified order.",

The task is to compute the minimal total latency, $T$, for a specified genomic signaling pathway. This latency is the sum of the durations of the sequential a priori steps, starting from receptor translocation and culminating in the functional insertion of a newly synthesized protein into the cell membrane.\n\nThe total latency $T$ is given by the equation:\n$$T = t_{\\text{trans}} + t_{\\text{init}} + t_{\\text{elong}} + t_{\\text{proc}} + t_{\\text{export}} + t_{\\text{tl}} + t_{\\text{traffic}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following durations directly in minutes:\n- Nuclear translocation time, $t_{\\text{trans}} = 1.0 \\text{ min}$.\n- Transcription initiation time, $t_{\\text{init}} = 2.0 \\text{ min}$.\n- mRNA processing time, $t_{\\text{proc}} = 2.0 \\text{ min}$.\n- mRNA nuclear export time, $t_{\\text{export}} = 1.5 \\text{ min}$.\n- Protein trafficking time, $t_{\\text{traffic}} = 3.0 \\text{ min}$.\n\nTwo durations, $t_{\\text{elong}}$ and $t_{\\text{tl}}$, must be calculated from the provided rates and lengths.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time for transcriptional elongation, $t_{\\text{elong}}$.

This is the time required for a ribosome to synthesize the polypeptide chain. It is calculated by dividing the number of amino acids, $n_{\\text{aa}}$, by the translational elongation rate, $v_{\\text{tl}}$.\nGiven:\n- Protein length, $n_{\\text{aa}} = 600$ amino acids.\n- Translation rate, $v_{\\text{tl}} = 6$ amino acids per second.\n\n$$t_{\\text{tl}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{aa}}}{v_{\\text{tl}}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ aa}}{6 \\text{ aa/s}} = 100 \\text{ s}$$\n\nSince all other time components are in minutes, we must convert $t_{\\text{tl}}$ to minutes.

Assume a single-compartment plasma model for 11-deoxycortisol in which ACTH fixes the upstream production flux at a constant rate $J$ into the 11-deoxycortisol pool, and 11-deoxycortisol is removed by two processes: enzymatic conversion to cortisol at a first-order rate constant $k_h$ and systemic elimination from plasma at a first-order rate constant $k_e$.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $C_{11}(t)$ be the concentration of 11-deoxycortisol in the plasma compartment at time $t$. The dynamics of this concentration are governed by the differential equation representing the mass balance:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{11}}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Removal}) $$\nThe rate of production is the constant upstream flux $J$. The rate of removal is the sum of the rates of the two first-order processes: enzymatic conversion and systemic elimination. The total removal rate is $(k_h + k_e)C_{11}$.\nThus, the governing differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{11}}{dt} = J - (k_h + k_e)C_{11} $$\nAt steady state, the concentration is constant, which implies that its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dC_{11}}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the equation to zero allows us to solve for the steady-state concentration, which we denote as $C_{11,\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ 0 = J - (k_h + k_e)C_{11,\\text{ss}} $$\n$$ (k_h + k_e)C_{11,\\text{ss}} = J $$\n$$ C_{11,\\text{ss}} = \\frac{J}{k_h + k_e} $$\nThis general formula can be applied to the conditions both before and after the administration of metyrapone.\n\n**1. Steady-State Concentration Before Metyrapone ($C_{11,\\text{before}}$)**\nBefore the drug is administered, both removal pathways are active. The rate constants are the baseline values $k_h$ and $k_e$. The steady-state concentration is:\n$$ C_{11,\\text{before}} = \\frac{J}{k_h + k_e} $$\n\n**2. Steady-State Concentration After Metyrapone ($C_{11,\\text{after}}$)**\nAfter metyrapone administration, the CYP11B1 enzyme is completely blocked. This means the rate constant for enzymatic conversion becomes effectively zero, i.e., $k_h' = 0$. The upstream flux $J$ and the systemic elimination constant $k_e$ remain unchanged. The new steady-state concentration is:\n$$ C_{11,\\text{after}} = \\frac{J}{k_h' + k_e} = \\frac{J}{0 + k_e} = \\frac{J}{k_e} $$\n\n**3. Increase in Steady-State Concentration ($\\Delta C_{11}$)**\nThe problem asks for the increase in concentration, defined as $\\Delta C_{11} = C_{11,\\text{after}} - C_{11,\\text{before}}$. Substituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\Delta C_{11} = \\frac{J}{k_e} - \\frac{J}{k_h + k_e} $$\nTo simplify, we factor out $J$ and find a common denominator:\n$$ \\Delta C_{11} = J \\left( \\frac{1}{k_e} - \\frac{1}{k_h + k_e} \\right) = J \\left( \\frac{(k_h + k_e) - k_e}{k_e(k_h + k_e)} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta C_{11} = J \\frac{k_h}{k_e(k_h + k_e)} $$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values into the derived expressions:\n- $J = 1.3$ nmol/(L·min)\n- $k_h = 0.07$ min$^{-1}$\n- $k_e = 0.015$ min$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual steady-state concentrations:\n$$ C_{11,\\text{before}} = \\frac{1.3}{0.07 + 0.015} = \\frac{1.3}{0.085} \\approx 15.2941 \\text{ nmol/L} $$\n$$ C_{11,\\text{after}} = \\frac{1.3}{0.015} \\approx 86.6667 \\text{ nmol/L} $$\nThe increase is the difference between these two values:\n$$ \\Delta C_{11} = C_{11,\\text{after}} - C_{11,\\text{before}} \\approx 86.6667 - 15.2941 = 71.3726 \\text{ nmol/L} $$\nAlternatively, using the simplified final expression for $\\Delta C_{11}$:\n$$ \\Delta C_{11} = (1.3) \\frac{0.07}{0.015(0.07 + 0.015)} = (1.3) \\frac{0.07}{0.015(0.085)} = \\frac{0.091}{0.001275} \\approx 71.372549... \\text{ nmol/L} $$\nThe results are consistent. The final step is to round the numerical answer to four significant figures.\nThe value is $71.372549...$. The fourth significant digit is $7$.
