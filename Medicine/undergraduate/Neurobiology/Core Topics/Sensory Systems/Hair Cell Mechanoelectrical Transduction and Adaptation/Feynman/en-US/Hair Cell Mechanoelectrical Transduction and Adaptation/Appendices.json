            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents two standard electrophysiological a in the study of ion channel biophysics, providing all necessary parameters and experimental values. The models specified—Ohm's law for single-channel conductance and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) constant-field framework for permeability—are appropriate for the context. The problem is therefore valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution is divided into two calculations as requested, followed by a brief interpretation.\n\n**1. Calculation of Single-Channel Conductance ($g$)**\n\nThe problem states that the single-channel current-voltage relationship follows Ohm's law:\n$$i = g(V - V_{\\text{rev}})$$\nwhere $i$ is the single-channel current, $g$ is the single-channel conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $V_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential.\n\nWe are given the following values from the monovalent-dominated measurement:\n- Membrane potential, $V = -80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Reversal potential, $V_{\\text{rev, mono}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Single-channel open current amplitude, $|i_{\\text{open}}| = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\nBy convention, inward current (flow of positive charge into the cell) is negative. Since the membrane potential ($V = -80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is negative relative to the reversal potential ($V_{\\text{rev, mono}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the net flow of cations will be into the cell, constituting an inward current. Therefore, the current $i$ is $i_{\\text{open}} = -12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nWe can rearrange Ohm's law to solve for the conductance $g$:\n$$g = \\frac{i}{V - V_{\\text{rev, mono}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$g = \\frac{-12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{-80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{-12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{-80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = 0.150\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{pA}}{\\mathrm{mV}}$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{pA}/\\mathrm{mV}$ is equivalent to nanoSiemens ($\\mathrm{nS}$). To express the conductance in picoSiemens ($\\mathrm{pS}$):\n$$g = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 150\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the conductance is $1.50 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Permeability Ratio ($P_K/P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$)**\n\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) constant-field model is used to relate the reversal potential to ionic concentrations and permeabilities. At the reversal potential ($V_{\\text{rev}}$), the net ionic current across the membrane is zero. For a membrane permeable to potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$) and calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), this means $I_K + I_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = 0$.\n\nThe GHK current equation for an ion species $j$ with valence $z_j$ is:\n$$I_j = P_j z_j^2 \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{[j]_i - [j]_o \\exp(-z_j V F / RT)}{1 - \\exp(-z_j V F / RT)}$$\nwhere $P_j$ is the permeability, $[j]_i$ and $[j]_o$ are the internal and external concentrations, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Let $u = V_{\\text{rev}}F/(RT)$ be the dimensionless potential at reversal.\n\nAt $V = V_{\\text{rev}}$, the zero-current condition is:\n$$P_K z_K^2 \\frac{[K]_i - [K]_o \\exp(-z_K u)}{1 - \\exp(-z_K u)} + P_{\\mathrm{Ca}} z_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^2 \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} u)}{1 - \\exp(-z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} u)} = 0$$\nWith $z_K = +1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = +2$:\n$$P_K \\frac{[K]_i - [K]_o \\exp(-u)}{1 - \\exp(-u)} + 4 P_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-2u)}{1 - \\exp(-2u)} = 0$$\nUsing the identity $1 - \\exp(-2u) = (1 - \\exp(-u))(1 + \\exp(-u))$, we can simplify:\n$$P_K ([K]_i - [K]_o \\exp(-u)) + 4 P_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-2u)}{1 + \\exp(-u)} = 0$$\nWe are given the following conditions for the bi-ionic measurement:\n- $[K]_i = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[K]_o = 0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_o = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $V_{\\text{rev}} = -5.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $V_T = RT/F$ and the dimensionless potential $u$:\n$$V_T = \\frac{RT}{F} \\approx \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V} = 25.69\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$u = \\frac{V_{\\text{rev}}}{V_T} = \\frac{-5.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{25.69\\,\\mathrm{mV}} \\approx -0.1946$$\nSubstituting the zero external potassium condition, $[K]_o = 0$, into the zero-current equation:\n$$P_K [K]_i + 4 P_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-2u)}{1 + \\exp(-u)} = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for the permeability ratio $P_K/P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$:\n$$\\frac{P_K}{P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} = \\frac{-4([\\mathrm{Ca}]_i - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-2u))}{[K]_i(1 + \\exp(-u))} = \\frac{4([\\mathrm{Ca}]_o \\exp(-2u) - [\\mathrm{Ca}]_i)}{[K]_i(1 + \\exp(-u))}$$\nNow, we compute the exponential terms:\n$$\\exp(-u) = \\exp(0.1946) \\approx 1.2148$$\n$$\\exp(-2u) = \\exp(0.3892) \\approx 1.4758$$\nSubstituting all numerical values into the expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{P_K}{P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} = \\frac{4((10\\,\\mathrm{mM})(1.4758) - 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{(140\\,\\mathrm{mM})(1 + 1.2148)}$$\n$$\\frac{P_K}{P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} = \\frac{4(14.758 - 0.0001)}{140(2.2148)} = \\frac{4(14.7579)}{310.072} = \\frac{59.0316}{310.072} \\approx 0.19038$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the permeability ratio is $0.190$.\n\n**3. Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated permeability ratio $P_K/P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ of approximately $0.190$ indicates that the MET channel is significantly more permeable to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ than to $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ($P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_K \\approx 5.3$). Under physiological conditions, the hair bundle is bathed in endolymph, which has a very high $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentration (around $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and a low $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration (tens of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). Despite the low external $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration, the high relative permeability of the MET channel to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ensures a substantial influx of calcium ions whenever the channel opens. This influx leads to the formation of a high-concentration calcium \"microdomain\" in the cytoplasm just beneath the channel pore. This local, rapid rise in intracellular calcium is the critical signal that mediates fast adaptation of the MET apparatus, a key process for adjusting the hair cell's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli.",

            "problem": "A vertebrate inner ear hair cell transduces bundle deflection into electrical current through hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. In a paired-step protocol, two identical positive bundle deflections are applied, separated by an interpulse interval at rest. The first step evokes a rapid MET current that peaks and then decays due to fast adaptation driven by local calcium ion entry. Assume the following experimentally justified base principles: (i) at rest (between steps), the local calcium concentration that drives fast adaptation relaxes back to baseline by first-order clearance kinetics, and (ii) the instantaneous suppression of the MET peak current by fast adaptation is linearly proportional to the residual adaptation drive set by local calcium. Slow adaptation mechanisms are pharmacologically blocked, and leak currents are subtracted.\n\nAn experiment is performed as follows. The first bundle step begins at time $t=0$ and lasts long enough to reach a steady plateau. At the onset of the first step, the MET current peaks at $I_{0}=400$ pA and decays to a steady plateau $I_{\\mathrm{pl}}=200$ pA before the step ends. After the first step ends and the bundle returns to rest, an identical second step is delivered after an interpulse interval $\\Delta t = 5.0$ ms.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established biophysics of hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe solution proceeds by mathematically formalizing the two provided base principles.\n\nLet $I(t)$ be the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) current at time $t$. Let $C(t)$ represent the local calcium concentration that drives fast adaptation, relative to its baseline resting concentration. We can set the resting concentration to zero, $C_{rest}=0$.\n\nPrinciple (ii) states that the instantaneous suppression of the MET peak current is linearly proportional to the residual adaptation drive set by local calcium. The unadapted peak current, evoked from a fully rested state, is given as $I_{0}$. The suppression at any moment is the difference between this maximal current and the observed peak current, $I_{peak}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$I_{0} - I_{peak} = k C(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This can be rearranged to express the peak current obtainable at time $t$:\n$$I_{peak}(t) = I_{0} - k C(t)$$\n\nThe first stimulus is applied at $t=0$. At this point, the hair cell is fully rested, so the adapting calcium concentration is at its baseline, $C(0) = 0$. The peak current evoked is:\n$$I_{peak}(0) = I_{0} - k C(0) = I_{0}$$\nThe problem states this value is $I_{0} = 400 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nDuring this first long stimulus step, the MET current adapts and settles to a steady-state plateau, $I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. At this plateau, the calcium concentration has also reached a steady-state level, which we denote as $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The current suppression is now maximal for the given stimulus. By treating the plateau as the limit of an adapting peak, we can relate it to $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{pl}} = I_{0} - k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$$\nThis equation allows us to characterize the maximal adaptation effect. We can rearrange it to find the term $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$k C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$$\n\nAfter the first stimulus ends, the system is allowed to rest for an interpulse interval of duration $\\Delta t$. According to principle (i), the calcium concentration $C(t')$ during this rest period (where $t'$ is time since the start of the interval) decays with first-order kinetics. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt'} = -\\frac{C}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is the calcium clearance time constant. The initial condition for this decay is the steady-state concentration reached at the end of the first pulse, $C(t'=0) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$C(t') = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\n\nThe second identical stimulus is applied at the end of the interpulse interval, i.e., at $t' = \\Delta t$. The residual calcium concentration at this moment is:\n$$C(\\Delta t) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nThe peak current of this second step, $I_{2}$, will be suppressed by this residual calcium:\n$$I_{2} = I_{0} - k C(\\Delta t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(\\Delta t)$:\n$$I_{2} = I_{0} - k \\left( C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right) \\right) = I_{0} - (k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nWe can now substitute the expression for $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ derived from the first pulse's plateau: $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. This yields the desired expression for $I_{2}$ as a function of $\\Delta t$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$:\n$$I_{2}(\\Delta t, \\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}) = I_{0} - (I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nThis expression describes the recovery from adaptation.\n\nThe next task is to use the provided numerical data to compute $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$.

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $p_o(t)$, which can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_o}{dt} + \\left[ k_{oc}(y(t)) + k_{co}(y(t)) \\right] p_o(t) = k_{oc}(y(t))\n$$\n\nThe transition rates $k_{oc}$ and $k_{co}$ depend exponentially on the effective displacement $y$, as per the gating spring model:\n$$\nk_{oc}(y) = k_{oc0} \\exp(s_{oc}\\, y), \\quad k_{co}(y) = k_{co0} \\exp(-s_{co}\\, y)\n$$\nThe parameters are given as $k_{oc0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, $k_{co0} = 1.0~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, $s_{oc} = 0.15~\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$, and $s_{co} = 0.10~\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n\n### Steady-State Analysis\nIn the steady state, $t\\to\\infty$, for a constant effective displacement $y$, the system reaches equilibrium, so $\\frac{dp_o}{dt} = 0$. The steady-state open probability, $p_o^\\infty$, is found by solving the algebraic equation:\n$$\nk_{oc}(y) \\left[1-p_o^\\infty\\right] - k_{co}(y) p_o^\\infty = 0\n$$\n$$\np_o^\\infty(y) = \\frac{k_{oc}(y)}{k_{oc}(y) + k_{co}(y)}\n$$\n\n### Transient Analysis (No Adaptation)\nWhen the displacement $x$ is a step function, $y(t)$ is also a constant for $t\\ge 0$. The ODE for $p_o$ has constant coefficients. Let $k_{\\text{sum}} = k_{oc}(y) + k_{co}(y)$ and $p_o^\\infty = k_{oc}(y)/k_{\\text{sum}}$. The ODE is $\\frac{dp_o}{dt} + k_{\\text{sum}} p_o = k_{oc}(y)$, with the solution:\n$$\np_o(t) = p_o^\\infty + \\left(p_o(0) - p_o^\\infty\\right) \\exp(-k_{\\text{sum}} t)\n$$\nwhere $p_o(0)$ is the initial open probability at time $t=0$.\n\n### Analysis with Adaptation\nWith adaptation, the effective displacement is $y(t) = x(t) - a(t)$, and the adaptation offset $a(t)$ evolves according to:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta\\, p_o(t) - a(t)}{\\tau_a}\n$$\nThis creates a system of two coupled, non-linear ODEs for $p_o(t)$ and $a(t)$.\nSteady-state conditions require $\\frac{dp_o}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{da}{dt}=0$. This leads to a system of two coupled algebraic equations:\n1. $a_\\infty = \\Delta p_o^\\infty$\n2. $p_o^\\infty = \\frac{k_{oc}(y_\\infty)}{k_{oc}(y_\\infty) + k_{co}(y_\\infty)}$, where $y_\\infty = x_\\infty - a_\\infty$\nSubstituting (1) into (2) gives a single non-linear equation for $p_o^\\infty$, which must be solved numerically (e.g., using a root-finding algorithm):\n$$\np_o^\\infty = \\frac{k_{oc}(x_\\infty - \\Delta p_o^\\infty)}{k_{oc}(x_\\infty - \\Delta p_o^\\infty) + k_{co}(x_\\infty - \\Delta p_o^\\infty)}\n$$\nThe transient behavior of this coupled system must be found by numerical integration.\n\nWe now solve the four test cases.\n\n**Test Case 1: Steady state, no adaptation**\n- Stimulus: constant displacement $x(t) \\equiv x_1 = 10~\\mathrm{nm}$. No adaptation, so $y = x_1 = 10~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Rates:\n$k_{oc}(10) = 0.2 \\exp(0.15 \\times 10) = 0.2 e^{1.5}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n$k_{co}(10) = 1.0 \\exp(-0.10 \\times 10) = e^{-1.0}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n- Steady-state probability $p_1$:\n$$\np_1 = p_o^\\infty(10) = \\frac{0.2 e^{1.5}}{0.2 e^{1.5} + e^{-1.0}} \\approx \\frac{0.896338}{0.896338 + 0.367879} \\approx 0.709015\n$$\n\n**Test Case 2: Transient, no adaptation**\n- Stimulus: step from $x_0=0~\\mathrm{nm}$ to $x_1=15~\\mathrm{nm}$ at $t=0$. No adaptation, so $y(t)=x(t)$.\n- Initial condition ($t<0$): system is at steady state with $y=x_0=0~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$p_o(0) = p_o^\\infty(0) = \\frac{k_{oc}(0)}{k_{oc}(0)+k_ {co}(0)} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2+1.0} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n- For $t \\ge 0$, $y=x_1=15~\\mathrm{nm}$. We compute the new steady-state $p_o^\\infty(15)$ and relaxation rate $k_{\\text{sum}}(15)$.\n$k_{oc}(15) = 0.2 \\exp(0.15 \\times 15) = 0.2 e^{2.25}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n$k_{co}(15) = 1.0 \\exp(-0.10 \\times 15) = e^{-1.5}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n$p_o^\\infty(15) = \\frac{0.2 e^{2.25}}{0.2 e^{2.25} + e^{-1.5}} \\approx 0.894788$\n$k_{\\text{sum}}(15) = k_{oc}(15) + k_{co}(15) \\approx 1.897547 + 0.223130 = 2.120677~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n- The transient value $p_2$ at $t=5~\\mathrm{ms}$ is:\n$$\np_2 = p_o(5) = p_o^\\infty(15) + \\left(p_o(0) - p_o^\\infty(15)\\right) \\exp(-k_{\\text{sum}}(15) \\times 5)\n$$\n$$\np_2 \\approx 0.894788 + (1/6 - 0.894788) \\exp(-2.120677 \\times 5) \\approx 0.894770\n$$\n\n**Test Case 3: Transient and steady state with adaptation**\n- Stimulus: step from $x_0=0~\\mathrm{nm}$ to $x_1=18~\\mathrm{nm}$ at $t=0$. Adaptation parameters: $\\Delta=6~\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\tau_a=20~\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Initial condition ($t<0$): system is at steady-state with $x_0=0$. We must solve for $p_o(0)$ and $a(0)$:\n$a(0) = \\Delta p_o(0) = 6 p_o(0)$, and $p_o(0) = p_o^\\infty(y(0))$ with $y(0) = x_0 - a(0) = -a(0)$.\nThis requires finding the root of $f(p) = p - p_o^\\infty(-6p) = 0$. Numerical root-finding yields $p_o(0) \\approx 0.146733$ and $a(0) = 6 p_o(0) \\approx 0.880399~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Transient at $t=50~\\mathrm{ms}$ ($p_{3,50}$): For $t \\ge 0$, we numerically integrate the system of ODEs with $x_1=18~\\mathrm{nm}$ and initial conditions $(p_o(0), a(0))$.\n$$\n\\frac{dp_o}{dt} = k_{oc}(18-a(t))\\left[1-p_o(t)\\right] - k_{co}(18-a(t)) p_o(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{6 p_o(t) - a(t)}{20}\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=50~\\mathrm{ms}$ gives $p_o(50) \\approx 0.840506$. So, $p_{3,50} = 0.840506$.\n- Steady state for $t\\to\\infty$ ($p_{3,\\infty}$): We solve the steady-state algebraic system with $x_1=18~\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThis requires finding the root of $g(p) = p - p_o^\\infty(18-6p)=0$. Numerical root-finding yields $p_{3,\\infty} \\approx 0.840733$.\n\n**Test Case 4: Steady state, no adaptation, negative displacement**\n- Stimulus: constant displacement $x(t) \\equiv x_1 = -5~\\mathrm{nm}$. No adaptation, so $y = x_1 = -5~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Rates:\n$k_{oc}(-5) = 0.2 \\exp(0.15 \\times -5) = 0.2 e^{-0.75}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n$k_{co}(-5) = 1.0 \\exp(-0.10 \\times -5) = e^{0.5}~\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$\n- Steady-state probability $p_4$:\n$$\np_4 = p_o^\\infty(-5) = \\frac{0.2 e^{-0.75}}{0.2 e^{-0.75} + e^{0.5}} \\approx \\frac{0.094473}{0.094473 + 1.648721} \\approx 0.054196\n$$\n\nThe final results are compiled into the required output format.",
