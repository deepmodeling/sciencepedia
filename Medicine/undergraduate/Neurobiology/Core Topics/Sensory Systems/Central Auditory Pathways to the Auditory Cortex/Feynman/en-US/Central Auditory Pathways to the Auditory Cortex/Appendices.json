Saltatory conduction across nodes of Ranvier underlies this scaling, and for uniformly myelinated axons in a healthy mammalian brain, this relation provides a reasonable first-order estimate.\n\nAssume a straight-line effective path length of $L = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ between the MGB and a target locus in the primary auditory cortex.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the conduction delay, $t$, for two types of thalamocortical axons with different diameters. The delay is defined by the relationship $t = L/v$, where $L$ is the path length and $v$ is the conduction velocity.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Path length: $L = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- Axon diameters: $d_{1} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $d_{2} = 4\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Empirical relation for conduction velocity (Hursh factor): $v \\approx 6d$, where $v$ is in units of meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$) and $d$ is in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nLet the Hursh factor be denoted by $k_H = 6$. The units of $k_H$ are $(\\mathrm{m/s})/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to ensure dimensional consistency in the formula $v = k_H d$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the conduction velocity for each axon type using the provided formula.\nFor the axon with diameter $d_{1} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$v_{1} = k_H \\cdot d_{1} = 6 \\frac{\\mathrm{m/s}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 12\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nFor the axon with diameter $d_{2} = 4\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$v_{2} = k_H \\cdot d_{2} = 6 \\frac{\\mathrm{m/s}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot 4\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 24\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the conduction delay $t = L/v$ for each axon. It is crucial to ensure that the units are consistent before performing the division. The path length $L$ is given as $12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. We must convert this to meters to be consistent with the velocity units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe conversion is $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, so:\n$$L = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 12 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the delays in seconds ($s$).\nFor the first axon type ($d_1$):\n$$t_{1} = \\frac{L}{v_{1}} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{12\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFor the second axon type ($d_2$):\n$$t_{2} = \\frac{L}{v_{2}} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{24\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answers to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) and rounded to three significant figures.

Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) is a standard clinical neurophysiological test. The concepts of axonal conduction velocity, synaptic delay, path length, and latency are central to this field. The specified anatomical structures (superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus) are correct components of the central auditory pathway whose activity corresponds to the generation of ABR waves III and V. The effect of demyelination, which is a reduction in conduction velocity, is also a well-established pathophysiological principle.

The relationship between the variables is clearly defined by the provided assumptions.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. All criteria for a valid problem are met. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe total interpeak latency, $\\Delta t$, is defined as the sum of the axonal conduction time, $t_{\\mathrm{cond}}$, and the total synaptic delay, $\\tau$.\n$$ \\Delta t = t_{\\mathrm{cond}} + \\tau $$\nThe axonal conduction time is the ratio of the axonal path length, $L$, to the conduction velocity, $v$.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{L}{v} $$\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives the general model for the interpeak latency:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{L}{v} + \\tau $$\nThis model can be applied to both the normal (norm) and observed (obs) patient conditions. The problem states that $L$ and $\\tau$ are constant in both conditions.\n\nFor the normal healthy adult:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = \\frac{L}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} + \\tau $$\nFor the patient with suspected demyelination:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{L}{v_{\\mathrm{obs}}} + \\tau $$\nWe can rearrange these equations to solve for the conduction velocities, $v_{\\mathrm{norm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. First, we isolate the axonal conduction time term for each case.\nFor the normal case, the conduction time is:\n$$ \\frac{L}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} - \\tau $$\nThus, the normal conduction velocity is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{norm}} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} - \\tau} $$\nFor the observed case, the conduction time is:\n$$ \\frac{L}{v_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\tau $$\nThus, the observed conduction velocity is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\tau} $$\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in axonal conduction velocity, which we can denote as $F$. This is defined as:\n$$ F = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{norm}} - v_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} $$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} $$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $v_{\\mathrm{norm}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ into this equation.\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\tau} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{L}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} - \\tau} \\right)} $$\nThe path length $L$ cancels out, which is expected as we are calculating a relative change and the path length is assumed to be constant.\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{v_{\\mathrm{norm}}} = \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} - \\tau}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\tau} $$\nSubstituting this ratio back into the equation for the fractional reduction $F$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} - \\tau}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\tau} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{ms}$, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 3.0~\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\tau = 0.6~\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{2.0 - 0.6}{3.0 - 0.6} $$\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{1.4}{2.4} $$\nThe fraction can be simplified:\n$$ \\frac{1.4}{2.4} = \\frac{14}{24} = \\frac{7}{12} $$\nSo, the fractional reduction is:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{5}{12} $$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$ F = \\frac{5}{12} \\approx 0.416666... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ F \\approx 0.4167 $$\nThis is the fractional reduction in axonal conduction velocity.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a principled rate-based decoding model for sound source azimuth based on the firing rates of neuron populations in the left and right Inferior Colliculus (IC). The solution involves three main stages: first, fitting parametric tuning curves to empirical data; second, deriving and implementing a maximum likelihood decoder; and third, using the model to predict localization biases under simulated unilateral hearing loss.\n\n### Step 1: Parametric Modeling of Neuronal Tuning Curves\n\nThe firing rates of the left ($r_L$) and right ($r_R$) IC populations are modeled as a function of sound source azimuth $\\alpha$. As specified, we use a four-parameter logistic function for the tuning curves, $f(\\alpha; \\theta)$:\n$$\nf(\\alpha;\\theta) = L + \\frac{U-L}{1+\\exp\\left(k\\left(\\alpha-x_{0}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nwhere the parameter vector is $\\theta = (L, U, k, x_0)$. Here, $L$ is the lower asymptote (minimum firing rate), $U$ is the upper asymptote (maximum firing rate), $k$ controls the steepness of the curve, and $x_0$ is the azimuth at the inflection point (center of the dynamic range).\n\nWe must determine the optimal parameter vectors $\\theta_L$ for the left IC and $\\theta_R$ for the right IC. This is achieved by fitting the model function $f(\\alpha; \\theta)$ to the provided empirical datasets for $r_L$ and $r_R$. The fitting process minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the model's predictions and the measured firing rates. For the left IC, we minimize:\n$$\n\\text{SSE}_L(\\theta_L) = \\sum_{i} \\left( r_{L,i} - f(\\alpha_i; \\theta_L) \\right)^2\n$$\nAnd similarly for the right IC:\n$$\n\\text{SSE}_R(\\theta_R) = \\sum_{i} \\left( r_{R,i} - f(\\alpha_i; \\theta_R) \\right)^2\n$$\nThis constitutes two separate non-linear least-squares optimization problems. The optimization is performed using numerical methods, with bounds on the parameters to ensure they remain within biologically plausible ranges. Based on the data, the firing rates range from approximately $5$ spikes/s to $50$ spikes/s. The left IC rate decreases with increasing $\\alpha$, implying $k_L > 0$. The right IC rate increases with increasing $\\alpha$, implying $k_R < 0$. The steepest part of the transition occurs near $\\alpha=0$, suggesting $x_0$ is close to $0$ for both channels.\n\n### Step 2: The Azimuth Decoder\n\nThe decoder's function is to estimate the most likely azimuth $\\hat{\\alpha}$ given a pair of observed firing rates $(r_L, r_R)$. Following the principle of maximum likelihood estimation and the assumption that the observed rates are corrupted by independent, zero-mean Gaussian noise with equal variance, the optimal estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is the one that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed rates and the values predicted by the fitted tuning curves. This defines the objective function $J(\\alpha)$:\n$$\nJ(\\alpha) = \\left(r_L - f_L(\\alpha; \\theta_L)\\right)^2 + \\left(r_R - f_R(\\alpha; \\theta_R)\\right)^2\n$$\nThe decoder $A(r_L, r_R)$ returns the value of $\\alpha$ in the specified range $[-90, 90]$ degrees that minimizes this function:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = A(r_L, r_R) = \\underset{\\alpha \\in [-90, 90]}{\\arg\\min} J(\\alpha)\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional optimization problem that can be solved numerically.\n\n### Step 3: Simulation of Unilateral Gain Reduction and Bias Calculation\n\nUnilateral hearing impairment is modeled as a multiplicative gain reduction on one channel. For a gain factor $g_R \\in (0, 1]$ applied to the right ear, the firing rate of the right IC is scaled accordingly. For a true sound source azimuth $\\alpha_{true}$, the \"observed\" firing rates fed to the central decoder are:\n$$\nr_L^{(g)} = f_L(\\alpha_{true}; \\theta_L)\n$$\n$$\nr_R^{(g)} = g_R \\cdot f_R(\\alpha_{true}; \\theta_R)\n$$\nThe perceived azimuth, $\\hat{\\alpha}_g$, is then computed by applying the decoder to this modified pair of rates:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}_g = A\\left(r_L^{(g)}, r_R^{(g)}\\right)\n$$\nThe localization bias, $b$, is the difference between the perceived azimuth and the true azimuth:\n$$\nb = \\hat{\\alpha}_g - \\alpha_{true}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Implementation and Computation\n\nThe overall procedure is implemented as follows:\n1.  The provided datasets for azimuths ($\\alpha$), left IC rates ($r_L$), and right IC rates ($r_R$) are stored.\n2.  The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function is used with the 'L-BFGS-B' method to find the optimal parameter vectors $\\theta_L$ and $\\theta_R$ by minimizing the respective SSE functions, subject to reasonable bounds on the parameters.\n3.  For each test case $(\\alpha_{true}, g_R)$:\n    a. The simulated rates $r_L^{(g)}$ and $r_R^{(g)}$ are calculated using the fitted functions $f_L(\\alpha; \\theta_L)$ and $f_R(\\alpha; \\theta_R)$.\n    b. The decoding objective function $J(\\alpha)$ is defined for these simulated rates.\n    c. The `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` function is used to find the perceived azimuth $\\hat{\\alpha}_g$ that minimizes $J(\\alpha)$ over the interval $[-90, 90]$.\n    d.
