            "problem": "Interaural time difference (ITD) is defined as the difference in arrival times of a sound at the two ears. In the horizontal plane, a common mechanistic model in neurobiology approximates the head as a rigid sphere of radius $r$, with the ears located at antipodal points on the sphere’s equator. Consider a low-frequency plane wave (so that diffraction follows the sphere’s curvature) propagating at the speed of sound $c$ with azimuthal angle $\\theta$ measured from straight-ahead. Starting from the fundamental relation between distance traveled and time, $v = dx/dt$, and the geometric fact that the arc length on a circle is $s = r \\phi$, derive an expression for the ITD under the spherical-head approximation by evaluating the extra distance the wavefront must travel to reach the far ear relative to the near ear. Then, using your derived expression, compute the expected ITD for a human with $r = 0.09$ m and $c = 343$ m/s at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. Convert the angle to radians for any trigonometric evaluation.

            "problem": "Interaural Level Difference (ILD) cues arise because the head acts as an acoustic obstacle that attenuates high-frequency sounds at the far ear, producing level differences between the two ears. A standard way to approximate the onset of appreciable head-shadowing is to consider the non-dimensional acoustic size parameter, defined by the wavenumber-radius product. Use the following fundamental bases:\n\n- The acoustic wavenumber is $k = \\frac{2\\pi f}{c}$, where $f$ is frequency and $c$ is the speed of sound in air.\n- A widely used criterion for the crossover from weak to strong scattering by a sphere of radius $r$ is when $k r \\approx 1$.\n- Take the head as a sphere of radius $r$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Starting only from these bases, derive a symbolic expression for the crossover frequency $f^{\\ast}$ in terms of $c$ and $r$.\n2) Evaluate $f^{\\ast}$ numerically for a human head radius $r = 0.09 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and the speed of sound $c = 343 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-1}}$.

Sound arriving from a distant source can be approximated locally at the pinna aperture as a plane wave. Let the intrinsic cavity depth along the ear canal axis be $d_{c}$, and let a prominent pinna ridge near the cavity entrance cause the location of specular interaction to shift with source elevation angle $\\theta$, thereby modifying the effective acoustic dimension $d(\\theta)$ that sets the dominant notch frequency.\n\nStarting from the linear one-dimensional acoustic wave equation for pressure $p(x,t)$ inside a tube, along with appropriate boundary conditions for an open aperture and a rigid closed termination, derive the resonance condition for the lowest mode and show how the corresponding frequency $f$ depends on the effective cavity dimension $d$. Then, using a simple geometric projection argument, relate $d(\\theta)$ to the elevation angle $\\theta$ by assuming the following: as $\\theta$ increases, the specular interaction point along a straight pinna ridge of characteristic span $s$ shifts by a distance whose projection onto the cavity axis is $s \\sin(\\theta)$; thus, the effective dimension becomes $d(\\theta) = d_{c} + s \\sin(\\theta)$.
