            "introduction": "The right and left adrenal glands have distinct shapes—the right is often described as pyramidal, while the left is more crescentic. While anatomical descriptions are qualitative, we can use idealized geometric models to quantify features like surface area, which is relevant for understanding vascular supply and fascial relationships. This exercise  will guide you through calculating the surface area of each gland using simple prisms, offering a practical way to connect abstract geometric concepts to tangible anatomical structures.",

            "problem": "An anatomist studying the external morphology of the human adrenal glands (also called suprarenal glands) adopts idealized geometric models to approximate external surface area, which is relevant for vascular and fascial coverage. The right adrenal is modeled as an isosceles triangular prism whose planar triangular face has base length $2.5 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and altitude $4.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$, extruded uniformly to thickness $0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The left adrenal is modeled as a thin crescent, idealized as a curved rectangular strip whose midline arc length is $5.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and uniform width is $2.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$, extruded to the same thickness $0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Use the widely accepted solid geometry fact for prisms that the total external surface area equals twice the area of the planar cross-section plus the product of the cross-section perimeter and the extrusion thickness. Treat the crescent’s planar cross-section as a rectangle of length equal to its mid-arc length and width equal to its strip width for both its area and perimeter.\n\nStarting from these foundations, derive expressions for the external surface areas of the right and left adrenal models, compute their numerical values, and then report the ratio of left-to-right external surface area. Express any surface areas you compute in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Round the final ratio to four significant figures. Do not include units in the final ratio.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total external surface area for two idealized geometric models of the human adrenal glands and then finding the ratio of the left gland's area to the right gland's area.\n\nThe fundamental formula provided for the total external surface area, $A_{total}$, of an extruded prism is:\n$$A_{total} = 2 A_{cs} + P_{cs} T$$\nwhere $A_{cs}$ is the area of the planar cross-section, $P_{cs}$ is the perimeter of that cross-section, and $T$ is the uniform extrusion thickness.\n\nFirst, we analyze the model for the right adrenal gland, which is described as an isosceles triangular prism.\nThe given parameters for the triangular cross-section are:\nBase length, $b_R = 2.5 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\nAltitude, $h_R = 4.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\nThe extrusion thickness is $T = 0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe area of the triangular cross-section, $A_{cs,R}$, is given by the standard formula for a triangle:\n$$A_{cs,R} = \\frac{1}{2} b_R h_R$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A_{cs,R} = \\frac{1}{2} (2.5)(4.0) = 5.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n\nTo find the perimeter of the cross-section, $P_{cs,R}$, we must determine the length of the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle. Let the length of one of these sides be $s$. The altitude to the base bisects the base, forming two right-angled triangles with legs of length $h_R$ and $\\frac{b_R}{2}$. By the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$s^2 = h_R^2 + \\left(\\frac{b_R}{2}\\right)^2$$\n$$s = \\sqrt{h_R^2 + \\left(\\frac{b_R}{2}\\right)^2}$$\nThe perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the three sides:\n$$P_{cs,R} = b_R + 2s = b_R + 2\\sqrt{h_R^2 + \\left(\\frac{b_R}{2}\\right)^2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$P_{cs,R} = 2.5 + 2\\sqrt{(4.0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2.5}{2}\\right)^2} = 2.5 + 2\\sqrt{16 + (1.25)^2}$$\n$$P_{cs,R} = 2.5 + 2\\sqrt{16 + 1.5625} = 2.5 + 2\\sqrt{17.5625} \\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total external surface area of the right adrenal model, $A_R$:\n$$A_R = 2 A_{cs,R} + P_{cs,R} T$$\n$$A_R = 2(5.0) + \\left(2.5 + 2\\sqrt{17.5625}\\right)(0.8)$$\n$$A_R = 10 + (2.5)(0.8) + 1.6\\sqrt{17.5625}$$\n$$A_R = 10 + 2.0 + 1.6\\sqrt{17.5625} = 12 + 1.6\\sqrt{17.5625} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nNumerically, $A_R \\approx 12 + 1.6(4.1907636) = 12 + 6.7052217 = 18.7052217 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the model for the left adrenal gland. The problem states to idealize its cross-section as a rectangle.\nThe given parameters for this rectangular cross-section are:\nLength, $l_L = 5.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\nWidth, $w_L = 2.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$\nThe extrusion thickness is the same, $T = 0.8 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe area of the rectangular cross-section, $A_{cs,L}$, is:\n$$A_{cs,L} = l_L w_L$$\n$$A_{cs,L} = (5.0)(2.0) = 10.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangular cross-section, $P_{cs,L}$, is:\n$$P_{cs,L} = 2(l_L + w_L)$$\n$$P_{cs,L} = 2(5.0 + 2.0) = 2(7.0) = 14.0 \\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nNow we calculate the total external surface area of the left adrenal model, $A_L$:\n$$A_L = 2 A_{cs,L} + P_{cs,L} T$$\n$$A_L = 2(10.0) + (14.0)(0.8)$$\n$$A_L = 20.0 + 11.2 = 31.2 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the ratio of the left-to-right external surface area, which we denote as $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{A_L}{A_R}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$R = \\frac{31.2}{12 + 1.6\\sqrt{17.5625}} = \\frac{31.2}{18.7052217...} \\approx 1.6679800$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures yields $1.668$.",
