This exercise provides a hands-on method to conceptualize the significant fluid exchange that underlies this diurnal variation. By modeling the disc as a simple prism and calculating the mass of water lost due to daily compressive loads, you will gain a tangible appreciation for the disc's hydrophilic nature and its function in load-bearing.

            "problem": "In the lumbar spine, intervertebral discs exhibit diurnal variation in height due to fluid exchange. Consider a single lumbar intervertebral disc modeled as a right prism whose planar cross-sectional area remains approximately constant under physiological loading. The disc’s morning height is measured as $11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and its evening height as $10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The average planar cross-sectional area is $1{,}400\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$. Assume that the observed reduction in height is entirely due to loss of intradiscal fluid, that the solid matrix volume and mass are unchanged over the interval, and that the intradiscal fluid has the density of water, $\\rho = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{g/cm^3}$. Use only the definitions of prismatic volume, $V = A h$, and density, $\\rho = m/V$, together with standard unit conversions.\n\nUsing these assumptions and definitions, determine the best estimate of the mass of fluid expelled from the disc between morning and evening.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the mass of fluid lost from an intervertebral disc when its height decreases from morning to evening. The fundamental starting points are the definition of the volume of a right prism, $V = A h$, where $A$ is the constant cross-sectional area and $h$ is the height, and the definition of density, $\\rho = m/V$, relating mass $m$ and volume $V$.\n\nFirst, compute the change in disc height:\n$$\n\\Delta h = h_{\\text{morning}} - h_{\\text{evening}} = 11\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 10\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mm}.\n$$\n\nWith the planar cross-sectional area assumed constant at $A = 1{,}400\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$, the corresponding change in disc volume, modeled as a right prism, is\n$$\n\\Delta V = A\\,\\Delta h = \\left(1{,}400\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\\right)\\left(1\\ \\mathrm{mm}\\right) = 1{,}400\\ \\mathrm{mm}^3.\n$$\n\nConvert this volume to cubic centimeters to use the given density in $\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$.

This practice applies a classic engineering model, treating the annulus as a thin-walled pressure vessel, to quantify this circumferential \"hoop stress\". By calculating this stress and comparing it to the material capacity of the disc's matrix, you can deduce why the specialized, multi-layered collagen fiber arrangement of the annulus is biomechanically essential for spinal integrity.

            "problem": "In the intervertebral disc (IVD), the annulus fibrosus (AF) can be idealized as a thin-walled cylindrical shell subjected to internal intradiscal pressure. Consider an AF segment with mean radius $r$ and wall thickness $t$, loaded by a uniform intradiscal pressure $p$. Using static force equilibrium on a diametral cut of a long cylinder and the thin-wall assumption $t \\ll r$, derive an expression for the circumferential (hoop) stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ at the mid-wall in terms of $p$, $r$, and $t$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the circumferential stress, also known as hoop stress, in a thin-walled cylinder. We consider a segment of the cylinder of length $L$. To find the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we make an imaginary cut along a diametral plane, splitting the cylinder segment into two halves. We then analyze the static equilibrium of one of these halves.\n\nThe internal pressure $p$ exerts an outward force on the internal surface of the cylinder. The resultant \"bursting\" force, $F_p$, acts perpendicular to the cut plane. This force is equal to the pressure multiplied by the projected area onto which the pressure acts. The projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the cylinder's internal diameter ($2r$) and its length ($L$).\n$$F_p = p \\times (2r) \\times L$$\n\nThis bursting force must be balanced by the resisting force, $F_{wall}$, generated by the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ acting on the material of the cylinder wall at the cut. The area of the wall material exposed by the cut is the sum of the areas of the two rectangular cross-sections of the wall. Each cross-section has an area of $t \\times L$.\n$$A_{wall} = 2 \\times (t \\times L)$$\nThe total resisting force is the hoop stress multiplied by this area.\n$$F_{wall} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times A_{wall} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2tL)$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, the bursting force must equal the resisting force:\n$$F_p = F_{wall}$$\n$$p(2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta}(2tL)$$\n\nWe can solve for the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ by simplifying the equation. The terms $2$ and $L$ cancel from both sides.\n$$pr = \\sigma_{\\theta}t$$\nThis yields the expression for the circumferential (hoop) stress:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{pr}{t}$$\nThis is the well-known Barlow's formula for a thin-walled cylinder.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ using the given numerical values: $p=0.6\\ \\text{MPa}$, $r=20\\ \\text{mm}$, and $t=6\\ \\text{mm}$.

            "introduction": "Moving from normal biomechanics to pathology, understanding the precise spatial relationships within the vertebral canal is crucial for diagnosing the effects of disc herniation. This practice challenges you to reason like a clinician, using fundamental anatomical principles to determine which specific nerve root is compressed by a common posterolateral disc herniation. By carefully tracing the pathways of the \"exiting\" and \"traversing\" nerve roots relative to the disc, you will master a key concept that explains how the location of a herniation dictates its clinical signs.

            "problem": "A clinician is correlating neurological deficits with the likely nerve root affected by a posterolateral intervertebral disc herniation at lumbar levels. Use the following fundamental anatomical facts as your base: the intervertebral disc lies between adjacent vertebral bodies; each lumbar spinal nerve exits the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen below the pedicle of the same-numbered vertebra; within the canal, a root descending to exit at the next caudal level occupies the lateral recess medial to the foramen; and a posterolateral herniation of the disc protrudes into the lateral recess just lateral to the posterior longitudinal ligament. From these fundamentals, determine which statements correctly map the relationship between posterolateral disc herniation and the traversing versus exiting lumbar nerve roots.\n\nChoose the option(s) that are anatomically correct.\n\nA. At $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$, a posterolateral disc herniation typically compresses the traversing $\\mathrm{L}5$ nerve root because the exiting $\\mathrm{L}4$ root lies superior and lateral under the $\\mathrm{L}4$ pedicle.\n\nB.

            "solution": "Let's analyze the anatomical relationships at a generic lumbar intervertebral level, $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$, based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **The Exiting Nerve Root:** The $\\mathrm{L}n$ nerve root exits below the pedicle of the $\\mathrm{L}n$ vertebra. At the level of the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc, this root has already passed superiorly and laterally to enter its foramen. It is therefore located \"above\" the typical site of a posterolateral disc herniation.\n\n2.  **The Traversing Nerve Root:** The $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ nerve root descends to exit at the next level down. It \"traverses\" the posterior aspect of the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc, passing through the lateral recess at this level.\n\n3.  **Location of Herniation:** A posterolateral herniation protrudes into the lateral recess, directly in the path of the traversing root.\n\nThis establishes a general rule: **A posterolateral herniation at level $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ typically compresses the traversing $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ nerve root.**\n\nNow we evaluate the options based on this rule:\n\n**A.

The statement incorrectly claims the exiting $\\mathrm{L}5$ root is compressed. The reason given is also factually wrong; the S1 root is traversing the canal at this level.

Throughout the lumbar spine, posterolateral disc herniations most often injure the exiting root at the same level (for example, $\\mathrm{L}4$ at $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$).**\nThis contradicts the general rule we established.

This statement is correct.\n\n**E. Only far-lateral (foraminal or extraforaminal) herniations compress the traversing root; posterolateral herniations spare it.**\nA far-lateral herniation affects the *exiting* root (e.g., L$n$ at L$n$–L$(n+1)$), not the traversing root. The second clause is also incorrect, as posterolateral herniations are the primary cause of traversing root compression. This statement is incorrect.",
