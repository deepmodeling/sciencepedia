This exercise explores the elegant relationship between form and function at the knee joint by examining the patella's role as an anatomical pulley.

            "problem": "In a planar analysis of the knee extensor mechanism, consider the quadriceps femoris acting through the patella and the patellar tendon to extend the knee about the femorotibial rotation axis. The patella, a sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps tendon, displaces the tendon anteriorly relative to the knee’s center of rotation, thereby altering the effective moment arm. Starting only from the core definitions that (i) torque about a fixed axis equals force times the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force, and (ii) the effective moment arm is that perpendicular distance, do the following:\n\n1) Derive an expression for the change in knee extension torque when the patella’s position modifies the effective moment arm from an initial value $r_{1}$ to a new value $r_{2}$, assuming the quadriceps force $F$ is unchanged and the knee axis is fixed.\n\n2) Using your derived expression, compute the numerical change in knee extension torque when the effective moment arm increases from $r_{1} = 3.0\\,\\text{cm}$ to $r_{2} = 3.5\\,\\text{cm}$ under a constant quadriceps force of $F = 1{,}200\\,\\text{N}$.

It is well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically sound, as the role of the patella is indeed to increase the moment arm of the quadriceps tendon. The provided data are realistic. Therefore, a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, the derivation of a general expression, and second, its numerical evaluation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Change in Torque ($\\Delta\\tau$)**\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the torque $\\tau$ is the product of the force $F$ and the effective moment arm $r$. The initial torque, $\\tau_1$, and the final torque, $\\tau_2$, are thus given by:\n$$ \\tau_1 = r_1 F $$\n$$ \\tau_2 = r_2 F $$\nThe change in torque, $\\Delta\\tau$, is the difference between the final and initial torques:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = \\tau_2 - \\tau_1 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = r_2 F - r_1 F $$\nFactoring out the constant force $F$ provides the general expression for the change in torque:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (r_2 - r_1)F $$\nThis is the required expression. A positive value of $\\Delta\\tau$ corresponds to an increase in torque.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nInitial moment arm, $r_1 = 3.0\\,\\text{cm}$\nFinal moment arm, $r_2 = 3.5\\,\\text{cm}$\nConstant force, $F = 1,200\\,\\text{N}$\n\nThe desired unit for torque is Newton-meters ($\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$). The given moment arms are in centimeters and must be converted to meters. The conversion factor is $1\\,\\text{m} = 100\\,\\text{cm}$.\n$$ r_1 = 3.0\\,\\text{cm} = \\frac{3.0}{100}\\,\\text{m} = 0.030\\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ r_2 = 3.5\\,\\text{cm} = \\frac{3.5}{100}\\,\\text{m} = 0.035\\,\\text{m} $$\n\nThese values are substituted into the derived expression for $\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (0.035\\,\\text{m} - 0.030\\,\\text{m}) \\times 1,200\\,\\text{N} $$\nFirst, the change in the moment arm is calculated:\n$$ \\Delta r = r_2 - r_1 = 0.005\\,\\text{m} $$\nThen, this change is multiplied by the force:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (0.005\\,\\text{m}) \\times (1,200\\,\\text{N}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = 6\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} $$\nThe result is positive, indicating an increase in torque, which is consistent with the increase in the moment arm.

This problem models the pelvis as a lever to explore the crucial stabilizing role of the gluteus medius muscle in the frontal plane. By analyzing the balance of torques from body weight and muscle contraction, you will gain insight into the mechanics of normal gait and the basis for clinical indicators of hip abductor weakness, such as the Trendelenburg sign. ",
            "id": "5132791",
            "problem": "A person stands in single-leg mid-stance on the left lower limb. In the frontal plane, the pelvis is modeled as a rigid segment connecting the left and right hip joint centers with length $2b$. The left hip joint is the pivot for frontal-plane rotation. The abductor mechanism of the stance hip (dominated by the gluteus medius) is modeled as a single resultant force $F$ acting with a constant moment arm $r$ about the left hip, independent of pelvic obliquity. The gravitational load of the trunk and the contralateral limb is modeled as a single weight $W$ acting vertically downward through the contralateral (right) hip joint center. Let the contralateral pelvic drop be defined by an angle $\\theta$ such that the line joining the hip joint centers is inclined by $\\theta$ below the horizontal on the contralateral side.\n\nUsing first principles of anatomy and mechanics, justify why the gluteus medius is the key frontal-plane pelvic stabilizer in mid-stance. Then, starting from static moment balance about the stance hip and the above geometric model, derive an expression for $\\theta$ that re-establishes equilibrium if the abductor force decreases to $0.70$ of its initial value while $W$, $b$, and $r$ remain unchanged. Finally, compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ in degrees. Round your answer to $3$ significant figures and express the angle in degrees.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It presents a standard, simplified biomechanical model of the pelvis in single-leg stance, based on the principles of static equilibrium. The question combines anatomical reasoning with mechanical derivation, which is a valid interdisciplinary approach.\n\nFirst, we address the justification for the role of the gluteus medius as the primary frontal-plane stabilizer of the pelvis. During single-leg stance, the gravitational force on the body mass superior to the hips and on the non-weight-bearing limb acts downward. The center of mass for this load is located medial to the supporting hip joint. This gravitational force, which the problem models as a single weight $W$, creates an adduction moment about the stance hip. This moment, if unopposed, would cause the contralateral (non-weight-bearing) side of the pelvis to drop, a phenomenon known as the Trendelenburg sign. To maintain a level pelvis, a counteracting abduction moment must be generated. This moment is produced by the contraction of the hip abductor muscles of the stance limb. Anatomically, the primary hip abductor muscles are the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, with a smaller contribution from the tensor fasciae latae. The gluteus medius is the largest and most powerful of these muscles. Its fibers originate on the external surface of the ilium and converge to insert on the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter of the femur. This arrangement provides the muscle with a large moment arm for abduction in the frontal plane, as its line of action passes superiorly and laterally to the center of rotation of the hip joint. Due to its size, architectural features, and advantageous leverage, the gluteus medius is the key muscle responsible for generating the large abduction moment required to stabilize the pelvis and prevent contralateral pelvic drop during activities like walking, running, and single-leg stance.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the pelvic drop angle $\\theta$ based on the provided model and principles of static mechanics. The system is in rotational equilibrium when the sum of the moments about the pivot point (the center of the left hip joint) is zero. Let us define counter-clockwise moments as positive and clockwise moments as negative.\n\nThe gravitational load $W$ acts vertically downward through the contralateral (right) hip joint center. The pelvis is modeled as a rigid rod of length $2b$. When the pelvis drops by an angle $\\theta$ on the contralateral side, the horizontal distance from the pivot (left hip) to the line of action of $W$ is the moment arm for the gravitational force. This moment arm is $d_W = (2b)\\cos\\theta$. This force creates a clockwise (adduction) moment, which is given by:\n$$M_W = -W \\cdot d_W = -W(2b)\\cos\\theta$$\n\nThe abductor muscle force $F$ acts with a constant moment arm $r$. This force generates a counter-clockwise (abduction) moment given by:\n$$M_F = F \\cdot r$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, the sum of moments must be zero:\n$$\\sum M = M_F + M_W = 0$$\n$$F \\cdot r - W(2b)\\cos\\theta = 0$$\n\nLet us first consider the initial state where the person is in a stable mid-stance. It is standard to assume this corresponds to a level pelvis, so the initial angle is $\\theta_0 = 0$. Let the initial abductor force required for equilibrium be $F_0$. The equilibrium equation is:\n$$F_0 \\cdot r - W(2b)\\cos(0) = 0$$\n$$F_0 \\cdot r = 2bW$$\nThis equation defines the magnitude of the abductor force required to maintain a level pelvis.\n\nNow, consider the final state where the abductor force has decreased to $F_1 = 0.70 F_0$. To re-establish equilibrium, the pelvis must drop by some angle $\\theta > 0$. The new equilibrium equation is:\n$$F_1 \\cdot r - W(2b)\\cos\\theta = 0$$\nSubstituting $F_1 = 0.70 F_0$:\n$$(0.70 F_0) \\cdot r - W(2b)\\cos\\theta = 0$$\n$$0.70 (F_0 \\cdot r) = W(2b)\\cos\\theta$$\n\nFrom the initial state equation, we have the expression $F_0 \\cdot r = 2bW$. We substitute this into the equation for the final state:\n$$0.70 (2bW) = W(2b)\\cos\\theta$$\n\nSince $W > 0$ and $b > 0$, we can divide both sides by the term $2bW$:\n$$0.70 = \\cos\\theta$$\nThis is the derived relationship. To find the angle $\\theta$, we take the arccosine of both sides:\n$$\\theta = \\arccos(0.70)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ in degrees. Using a calculator, we find the value in radians:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.7953987... \\text{ rad}$$\nTo convert this to degrees, we multiply by $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$:\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.7953987... \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 45.572996...^{\\circ}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\\theta \\approx 45.6^{\\circ}$$",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definition of mechanical work $W$ performed by a torque $\\tau$ over an angular displacement:\n$$W = \\int_{\\theta_i}^{\\theta_f} \\tau(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nwhere $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_f$ are the initial and final angles, respectively. The total angular displacement is given as $\\Delta \\theta = \\theta_f - \\theta_i = 0.7\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\n**1. Total Mechanical Work ($W_{\\text{total}}$)**\nThe problem states that the net hip extension torque $\\tau$ is approximately constant at $\\tau = 80\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$ throughout the movement. Under this condition, the torque can be moved outside the integral:\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = \\tau \\int_{\\theta_i}^{\\theta_f} d\\theta = \\tau (\\theta_f - \\theta_i) = \\tau \\Delta\\theta$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = (80\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}) \\times (0.7\\,\\text{rad})$$\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = 56\\,\\text{J}$$\n\n**2. Work Performed by the Hamstrings ($W_{\\text{ham}}$)**\nThe torque generated by the hamstrings, $\\tau_{\\text{ham}}$, is a constant fraction $f_{\\text{ham}}$ of the total torque $\\tau$. Therefore:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{ham}} = f_{\\text{ham}} \\tau$$\nSince $f_{\\text{ham}}$ and $\\tau$ are both constant, $\\tau_{\\text{ham}}$ is also constant. The work done by the hamstrings is calculated using the same work-torque relationship:\n$$W_{\\text{ham}} = \\int_{\\theta_i}^{\\theta_f} \\tau_{\\text{ham}} \\, d\\theta = \\tau_{\\text{ham}} \\Delta\\theta$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau_{\\text{ham}}$:\n$$W_{\\text{ham}} = (f_{\\text{ham}} \\tau) \\Delta\\theta = f_{\\text{ham}} (\\tau \\Delta\\theta)$$\nRecognizing that $\\tau \\Delta\\theta = W_{\\text{total}}$, we have:\n$$W_{\\text{ham}} = f_{\\text{ham}} W_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given value $f_{\\text{ham}} = 0.60$ and the calculated total work:\n$$W_{\\text{ham}} = 0.60 \\times 56\\,\\text{J} = 33.6\\,\\text{J}$$\n\n**3. Work Performed by the Gluteus Maximus ($W_{\\text{glut}}$)**\nThe gluteus maximus provides the remainder of the torque. The fraction of torque from the gluteus maximus, $f_{\\text{glut}}$, is:\n$$f_{\\text{glut}} = 1 - f_{\\text{ham}}$$\nThe torque generated by the gluteus maximus, $\\tau_{\\text{glut}}$, is therefore:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{glut}} = f_{\\text{glut}} \\tau = (1 - f_{\\text{ham}}) \\tau$$\nSince this torque is also constant, the work done by the gluteus maximus is:\n$$W_{\\text{glut}} = \\int_{\\theta_i}^{\\theta_f} \\tau_{\\text{glut}} \\, d\\theta = \\tau_{\\text{glut}} \\Delta\\theta = (1 - f_{\\text{ham}}) \\tau \\Delta\\theta$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$W_{\\text{glut}} = (1 - f_{\\text{ham}}) W_{\\text{total}}$$\nAlternatively, since work is an additive scalar quantity and the net torque is the sum of the contributing torques ($\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{ham}} + \\tau_{\\text{glut}}$), the total work must be the sum of the work done by each muscle group:\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = W_{\\text{ham}} + W_{\\text{glut}}$$\nTherefore, the work of the gluteus maximus can be found by subtraction:\n$$W_{\\text{glut}} = W_{\\text{total}} - W_{\\text{ham}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$W_{\\text{glut}} = 56\\,\\text{J} - 33.6\\,\\text{J} = 22.4\\,\\text{J}$$\nUsing the fractional method as a check:\n$$W_{\\text{glut}} = (1 - 0.60) \\times 56\\,\\text{J} = 0.40 \\times 56\\,\\text{J} = 22.4\\,\\text{J}$$\nThe results are consistent.\n\n**4. Final Values and Rounding**\nThe problem requires the final answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\n- Total work: $W_{\\text{total}} = 56\\,\\text{J}$.

This is also at three significant figures.\n\nThe final values reported in the specified order (total, hamstrings, gluteus maximus) are $56.0\\,\\text{J}$, $33.6\\,\\text{J}$, and $22.4\\,\\text{J}$.",
