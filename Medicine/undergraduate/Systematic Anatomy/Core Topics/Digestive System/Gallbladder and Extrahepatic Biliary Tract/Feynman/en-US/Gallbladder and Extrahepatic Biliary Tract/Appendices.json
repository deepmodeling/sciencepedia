            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the physiological principles of biliary fluid dynamics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively. The solution can be determined by a direct application of the stated principles.\n\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous net driving pressure for bile flow into the duodenum immediately following the relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi (SO). The governing principle provided is that fluid flow is driven by a pressure gradient, and a sphincter acts as an additive pressure barrier.\n\nLet us define the relevant pressures:\n- $P_{bile}$ is the pressure in the common bile duct, proximal to the SO.\n- $P_{duo}$ is the pressure in the duodenum, distal to the SO.\n- $P_{SO}$ is the pressure exerted by the SO, which acts as a barrier.\n\nAccording to the problem description, flow from the common bile duct into the duodenum occurs when the upstream pressure ($P_{bile}$) exceeds the sum of the downstream pressure ($P_{duo}$) and the sphincter barrier pressure ($P_{SO}$). The net driving pressure, which we can denote as $P_{net}$, is the difference between the driving pressure and the total resisting pressure.\n$$P_{net} = P_{bile} - (P_{duo} + P_{SO})$$\nFlow occurs when $P_{net} > 0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial basal state before SO relaxation. The given values are:\n- Basal sphincter pressure, $P_{SO, basal} = 12 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n- Duodenal pressure, $P_{duo} = 5 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\nThe problem states that in this basal state, \"there is no net bile flow\" and \"the common bile duct just proximal to the SO equilibrates to the minimum pressure needed to prevent flow.\" This establishes a condition of equilibrium where the upstream pressure exactly balances the total downstream resisting pressure. Therefore, the biliary pressure $P_{bile}$ must be equal to the sum of the duodenal pressure and the basal sphincter pressure.\n$$P_{bile} = P_{duo} + P_{SO, basal}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{bile} = 5 \\text{ mmHg} + 12 \\text{ mmHg} = 17 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThis is the pressure in the common bile duct just prior to the administration of the hormone analog.\n\nNext, we analyze the state at the instant of SO relaxation. The problem provides new conditions:\n- The residual sphincter pressure drops to $P_{SO, relaxed} = 4 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n- The duodenal pressure is assumed to remain constant at $P_{duo} = 5 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n- A crucial assumption is that \"over the very short time interval at the onset of relaxation... the proximal intraductal (biliary) pressure remains unchanged.\" This means the biliary pressure is still $P_{bile} = 17 \\text{ mmHg}$ at the moment relaxation begins.\n\nWe can now calculate the new instantaneous net driving pressure, $P_{net}$, using the formula derived earlier with the new sphincter pressure.\n$$P_{net} = P_{bile} - (P_{duo} + P_{SO, relaxed})$$\nSubstituting the values for this instantaneous state:\n$$P_{net} = 17 \\text{ mmHg} - (5 \\text{ mmHg} + 4 \\text{ mmHg})$$\n$$P_{net} = 17 \\text{ mmHg} - 9 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$P_{net} = 8 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThis positive net driving pressure of $8 \\text{ mmHg}$ will initiate the flow of bile into the duodenum.",

This concept is especially critical in pathologies like cholecystitis, where inflammation can narrow the cystic duct.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics (Poiseuille's law), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language. All assumptions (Newtonian fluid, laminar flow, rigid tube) are standard simplifications for constructing a tractable biophysical model.\n\nThe problem requires determining the percentage increase in hydrodynamic resistance in the cystic duct due to a reduction in its effective radius. The provided relationship for hydrodynamic resistance, $R$, is based on Poiseuille's law for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube.\n\nThe governing relationship is given as a proportionality:\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{L}{r^{4}}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the hydrodynamic resistance, $L$ is the length of the tube, and $r$ is the radius of the tube.\n\nLet $R_1$ and $r_1$ denote the initial resistance and radius of the cystic duct before the onset of edema. Let $R_2$ and $r_2$ denote the final resistance and radius after the edema has developed. Since the problem states that the duct's length $L$ and the bile's dynamic viscosity remain unchanged, the constant of proportionality, which depends on these factors, is the same in both the initial and final states. We can therefore write the relationship as an equation with a constant $C$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C}{r^4}\n$$\nThe initial resistance is:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{C}{r_1^4}\n$$\nThe final resistance is:\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{C}{r_2^4}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mucosal edema causes a uniform reduction in the effective luminal radius by $20\\%$.

The question specifies the answer should be a decimal number, which corresponds to the fractional increase.\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} = \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1} - 1\n$$\nUsing our expression for the ratio $\\frac{R_2}{R_1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{625}{256}\n$$\nThe fractional increase is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{625}{256} - 1 = \\frac{625}{256} - \\frac{256}{256} = \\frac{625 - 256}{256} = \\frac{369}{256}\n$$\nTo express this exact fraction as a decimal number, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{369}{256} = 1.44140625\n$$\nThis value represents a $144.140625\\%$ increase in hydrodynamic resistance.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Surgical Scenario**: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n- **Anatomical Variant**: A double cystic artery, with both branches arising from the Right Hepatic Artery (RHA).\n- **Branch Anatomy and Supply**:\n    - An anterior (superficial) branch supplies the peritoneal surface of the gallbladder.\n    - A posterior (deep) branch courses along the hepatic surface and supplies it.\n- **Surgical Event**: The anterior (superficial) branch is inadvertently ligated.\n- **Post-Ligation State**: The posterior (deep) branch remains intact.\n- **Conceptual Framework**: Reasoning must use the definitions of end-arterial supply, anastomosis, and the hemodynamic principle $Q=\\Delta P/R$, where $Q$ is regional arterial inflow, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure gradient, and $R$ is the net vascular resistance.\n- **Collateral Supply**: Small cholecystohepatic arteries may enter the gallbladder from the hepatic bed.\n- **Distribution of Collateral Supply**: The cholecystohepatic arteries \"preferentially reinforce the hepatic surface and the proximal body and neck.\"\n- **Question**: Predict the likelihood and regional distribution of ischemia in the gallbladder.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established human anatomy and physiology. A double cystic artery is a known, albeit uncommon, anatomical variant. The described division of supply to the peritoneal and hepatic surfaces is consistent with typical cystic artery branching. The existence and typical location of cholecystohepatic arteries as a secondary blood supply from the liver bed are well-documented. The hemodynamic principle $Q=\\Delta P/R$ is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics (Poiseuille's law), correctly applied to blood flow.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a specific, well-defined clinical scenario and asks for a logical deduction based on provided anatomical and physiological principles. It contains sufficient information to arrive at a unique, reasoned conclusion.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent setup. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of gallbladder perfusion following the ligation of one of its two primary arterial supplies, considering the specific distribution of the remaining primary and collateral vessels.\n\n$1$. **Define Core Concepts**:\n- **End Artery**: An artery that does not have significant anastomoses (connections) with other arteries. Occlusion of an end artery leads to ischemia and infarction of the tissue it supplies.\n- **Anastomosis**: A connection between adjacent blood vessels. Anastomoses provide collateral circulation, which are alternative pathways for blood flow if a primary vessel is occluded.\n- **Hemodynamics**: The principle $Q = \\Delta P / R$ states that blood flow ($Q$) to a tissue is directly proportional to the pressure difference across the vascular bed ($\\Delta P$) and inversely proportional to the vascular resistance ($R$). Ligation of an artery increases the resistance of that pathway to infinity, reducing $Q$ through that path to zero. Perfusion then depends entirely on alternative pathways (collaterals), which have their own characteristic resistance.\n\n$2$. **Analyze the Vascular State**:\n- **Baseline (Pre-ligation)**: The gallbladder is supplied by two arteries: an anterior branch for the peritoneal surface and a posterior branch for the hepatic surface.\n- **Insult (Post-ligation)**: The anterior branch is ligated. The primary arterial inflow ($Q_{\\text{anterior}}$) to the peritoneal surface is now zero. The posterior branch remains intact, preserving the primary inflow ($Q_{\\text{posterior}}$) to the hepatic surface.\n- **Remaining Supply**:\n    - **Intact Primary Supply**: The posterior cystic artery continues to perfuse the hepatic surface of the gallbladder.\n    - **Collateral Supply**: The problem explicitly mentions \"small cholecystohepatic arteries\" that \"preferentially reinforce the hepatic surface and the proximal body and neck.\"\n\n$3$. **Predict Regional Perfusion**:\nWe must assess the perfusion of different regions of the gallbladder based on their proximity to the remaining blood sources.\n\n- **Hepatic Surface and Proximal Gallbladder (Body/Neck)**: This region has a robust and likely redundant blood supply. It is perfused by the intact posterior cystic artery *and* reinforced by the cholecystohepatic arteries. Ischemia in this region is highly improbable.\n\n- **Peritoneal Surface**: This region has lost its primary blood supply (the ligated anterior branch). Its survival depends on collateral flow. The potential sources of this collateral flow are:\n    - Anastomoses from the intact posterior branch.\n    - Anastomoses from the cholecystohepatic arteries.\n\nThe problem guides our reasoning by stating the cholecystohepatic arteries *preferentially* supply the hepatic surface and proximal parts. This implies their contribution to the distal peritoneal surface is minimal. The fundus is the most distal part of the gallbladder, farthest from the hilum where the cystic arteries and cholecystohepatic vessels enter. Therefore, the peritoneal surface of the fundus is the region most geographically isolated from all remaining blood supplies.\n\nWhile some intramural anastomoses likely exist between the anterior and posterior arterial systems, they are often insufficient to fully compensate for the loss of a major branch. Given the low-resistance, direct perfusion of the hepatic side and the high-resistance, circuitous collateral perfusion of the peritoneal side, the hemodynamic principle $Q = \\Delta P / R$ predicts a significant disparity in flow. The region with the highest vascular resistance to collateral flow will be the most underperfused. This is the peritoneal surface of the fundus, as it is most distant from both the intact posterior cystic artery's territory and the origin of the cholecystohepatic collaterals.\n\nTherefore, the most logical outcome is not global infarction, nor an absence of ischemia, nor uniform ischemia, but rather *focal ischemia* concentrated in the region most vulnerable: the peritoneal surface of the fundus.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. High likelihood of global gallbladder infarction because cystic artery branches behave as strict end arteries without meaningful anastomoses.**\n  - **Evaluation**: This statement is incorrect. The presence of the intact posterior cystic artery and the collateral cholecystohepatic arteries provides substantial perfusion to a large part of the gallbladder (the hepatic surface, body, and neck). Therefore, *global* infarction is not the expected outcome. The premise of \"strict end arteries\" is an oversimplification, but even if it were true, the presence of other intact vessels makes the conclusion of global necrosis invalid.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. No meaningful risk of ischemia because vessels from the hepatic bed reliably replace cystic arterial flow to all regions, including the peritoneal surface and fundus.**\n  - **Evaluation**: This statement contradicts the problem's givens. The problem explicitly states that the cholecystohepatic arteries \"preferentially reinforce the hepatic surface and the proximal body and neck.\" This directly refutes the claim that they can reliably supply *all* regions, particularly the distal peritoneal surface and fundus. Ligation of a major arterial branch always carries a risk of ischemia, and this option unjustifiably dismisses it.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Limited ischemia most likely at the peritoneal (anteroinferior) surface of the fundus, because the intact posterior branch and hepatic bed collaterals preferentially support the hepatic surface and proximal segments, leaving the distal peritoneal surface relatively underperfused.**\n  - **Evaluation**: This statement is a precise and logical synthesis of all the information provided. It correctly identifies that the intact posterior artery and the cholecystohepatic collaterals secure the perfusion of the hepatic surface and proximal gallbladder. It correctly deduces that the region supplied by the ligated anterior artery, and most distant from the remaining collateral sources (i.e., the peritoneal surface of the fundus), is the most susceptible to ischemia.\n  - **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n- **D. Uniform mild ischemia of the entire gallbladder due to a proportional reduction in inflow with loss of a branch, without regional differences in collateral support.**\n  - **Evaluation**: This statement is incorrect. It falsely claims there are no \"regional differences in collateral support,\" directly contradicting the problem's description of the cholecystohepatic arteries. Because the remaining primary supply (posterior cystic artery) and the collateral supply (cholecystohepatic arteries) are regionally distributed, the resulting perfusion deficit will also be regional, not uniform.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
