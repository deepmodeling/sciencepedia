The relationship between distance, velocity, and time is a core physical concept applied to axonal conduction. The anatomical description of the ansa cervicalis, its components from $\\mathrm{C1}$-$\\mathrm{C3}$, and the temporary association of $\\mathrm{C1}$ fibers with the hypoglossal nerve is correct.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires the computation of the latency, which is the time ($t$) it takes for a nerve impulse (action potential) to travel from the site of stimulation to the target muscle's neuromuscular junction.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between distance ($L$), constant velocity ($v$), and time ($t$) is given by the equation for uniform motion:\n$$v = \\frac{L}{t}$$\nThe problem is based on the assumption that the nerve conduction velocity is constant along the axon, which is a standard simplification for such calculations.\n\nTo find the latency ($t$), we rearrange the equation to solve for time:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- The total path length of the motor axon from the stimulation point to the sternohyoid motor endplate is $L = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- The conduction velocity of these large myelinated motor fibers is $v = 50 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe anatomical details confirm that the stimulus applied to the hypoglossal nerve will indeed activate the $\\mathrm{C1}$ motor fibers that U-turn to supply the sternohyoid muscle via the ansa cervicalis, making the chosen pathway correct. The assumptions allow us to disregard other smaller time-contributing factors and focus solely on the axonal conduction time.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the rearranged equation:\n$$t = \\frac{0.18 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{50 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}}$$\nThe units of meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving the result in units of seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$t = 0.0036 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe question explicitly asks for the answer to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$). The conversion factor between seconds and milliseconds is $1 \\ \\mathrm{s} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nTo convert the calculated time into milliseconds, we multiply by this factor:\n$$t \\text{ (in ms)} = 0.0036 \\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{ms}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$t = 3.6 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nThis is the expected latency between the stimulus and the onset of muscle response, based on the provided data and assumptions.",

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information in its \"Fundamental base\":\n- Motor deficits reflect loss of function in muscles innervated by the injured nerve; the pattern of weakness follows the normal actions of the affected muscles.\n- Cranial nerve $XII$ provides motor innervation to all intrinsic and extrinsic tongue muscles except the palatoglossus; unilateral weakness of the genioglossus produces tongue deviation toward the side of the lesion on protrusion, and denervation of tongue muscles leads to ipsilateral atrophy and fasciculations with dysarthria.\n- The ansa cervicalis is a loop formed by a superior root (predominantly fibers from $C1$ traveling transiently with cranial nerve $XII$) and an inferior root (from $C2$–$C3$); the loop innervates infrahyoid strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and both bellies of omohyoid), which depress the hyoid bone and larynx and stabilize the hyoid during swallowing and phonation.\n- Cervical spinal nerve $C1$ also sends motor fibers via cranial nerve $XII$ directly to the geniohyoid and thyrohyoid, typically proximal to the formation of the superior root; therefore, an isolated lesion of the superior root (descendens hypoglossi) does not necessarily affect tongue muscles and may spare geniohyoid and thyrohyoid depending on lesion location.\n\nThe question asks: Which single clinical sign most specifically favors a diagnosis of hypoglossal nerve injury over an isolated $C1$ superior root lesion of the ansa cervicalis?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is to be validated for its scientific grounding, clarity, and consistency.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The anatomical and physiological statements provided in the \"Fundamental base\" are correct and align with established principles of neuroanatomy.\n    - The description of motor deficit patterns is a foundational concept in neurology.\n    - The innervation territory of cranial nerve $XII$ (hypoglossal nerve) and the clinical signs of its lesion (tongue deviation, atrophy, fasciculations) are textbook facts.\n    - The description of the ansa cervicalis, its roots ($C1$, $C2$, $C3$), and its target muscles (infrahyoid strap muscles) is accurate.\n    - The complex relationship between $C1$ spinal nerve fibers and the hypoglossal nerve, including the separate branches to the superior root of the ansa, geniohyoid, and thyrohyoid, is correctly portrayed. This anatomical arrangement is crucial for the clinical reasoning required.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear differential diagnosis between two specific neurological lesions and asks for the most distinguishing clinical sign. The provided information is sufficient to deduce a unique answer through logical application of anatomical principles.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. Terms like \"hypoglossal nerve\", \"ansa cervicalis\", \"superior root\", \"atrophy\", and \"fasciculations\" are standard, objective medical terms.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will be derived by analyzing the distinct anatomical pathways and resulting clinical deficits.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to identify a clinical sign that is present in a hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve $XII$) lesion but absent in an isolated lesion of the superior root of the ansa cervicalis (which is formed by fibers from cervical spinal nerve $C1$).\n\nLet's analyze the innervation patterns and the consequences of each lesion based on the provided facts:\n\n1.  **Hypoglossal Nerve ($CN~XII$) Injury**: The hypoglossal nerve's primary function is to provide motor innervation to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue (except palatoglossus). Therefore, a lesion of $CN~XII$ will directly result in paralysis and subsequent denervation changes in the ipsilateral tongue muscles. As the problem states, this manifests as:\n    - Weakness of the genioglossus muscle, causing the tongue to deviate *toward* the side of the lesion upon protrusion.\n    - Long-term denervation leads to ipsilateral tongue muscle *atrophy* (loss of bulk) and *fasciculations* (spontaneous, fine muscle twitches).\n    These signs are specific to the loss of function of the hypoglossal nerve itself.\n\n2.  **Isolated Superior Root of the Ansa Cervicalis Injury**: The superior root is formed by fibers originating from the $C1$ spinal nerve that travel briefly with $CN~XII$ before branching off. This root, along with the inferior root (from $C2$-$C3$), innervates the infrahyoid muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid). An *isolated* lesion of the superior root, by definition, affects only these $C1$ fibers after they have separated from the main trunk of the hypoglossal nerve. Crucially, such a lesion would *not* affect the motor fibers of $CN~XII$ that continue on to supply the tongue muscles. Therefore, an isolated superior root lesion would result in weakness of the infrahyoid muscles but would spare all tongue muscles. The tongue would have normal strength, bulk, and no fasciculations or deviation.\n\n**Distinguishing Sign**: The key difference lies in the function of the tongue muscles. Signs of tongue muscle denervation are pathognomonic for a lesion affecting the motor fibers of the hypoglossal nerve proper. These signs would be completely absent in an isolated lesion of the ansa cervicalis' superior root. Therefore, the most specific sign favoring a $CN~XII$ injury is one that demonstrates tongue muscle dysfunction.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. On tongue protrusion, the tongue deviates toward the side of the lesion, with ipsilateral tongue atrophy and fasciculations.**\n- **Analysis**: This option describes the classic triad of signs resulting from a unilateral lesion of the hypoglossal nerve ($CN~XII$). As derived above, these signs are caused by the denervation of the tongue muscles. An isolated lesion of the superior root of the ansa cervicalis spares the tongue muscles, so these signs would be absent. The presence of these signs is therefore highly specific for a $CN~XII$ lesion in this differential diagnosis.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Delayed descent of the larynx after swallowing due to inability to depress the hyoid, with preserved tongue strength and bulk.**\n- **Analysis**: \"Delayed descent of the larynx\" points to weakness of the infrahyoid muscles, which are innervated by the ansa cervicalis. A lesion of the superior root ($C1$) would contribute to this weakness. However, a lesion of the hypoglossal nerve *proximal* to where the superior root branches off would also damage the traveling $C1$ fibers, causing the same infrahyoid weakness. Thus, the sign of infrahyoid weakness is not specific and can occur in both conditions. The phrase \"with preserved tongue strength and bulk\" describes the findings in an ansa cervicalis lesion, but the question asks for a sign that favors a *hypoglossal nerve injury*. This option describes a clinical picture that favors the ansa cervicalis lesion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Shoulder droop with impaired resisted shoulder shrug on the side of the lesion.**\n- **Analysis**: These signs are characteristic of a lesion of the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve $XI$), which innervates the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. This is unrelated to the hypoglossal nerve or the ansa cervicalis and is therefore irrelevant to the differential diagnosis presented.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Loss of taste from the anterior $\\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the tongue with an intact gag reflex.**\n- **Analysis**: Taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is mediated by the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve $VII$). The gag reflex involves the glossopharyngeal nerve ($CN~IX$) and vagus nerve ($CN~X$). These functions are unrelated to the motor functions of the hypoglossal nerve or the ansa cervicalis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

The anterior rami $C1$–$C4$ form the cervical plexus, which provides cutaneous and motor branches.\n    2.  The cervical plexus has cutaneous branches to the lateral head and neck.\n    3.  The ansa cervicalis, a nerve loop from upper cervical anterior rami, innervates the infrahyoid (strap) muscles.\n    4.

It provides two distinct, localized lesions and a set of principles (\"Foundational base\") from which to logically deduce the consequences. The question asks to identify the best match among the options, which is a standard format for assessing understanding of these principles.

A $C2$ lesion would cause sensory loss in this area.\n    *   **Great Auricular Nerve**: Arises from $C2$ and $C3$. It supplies the skin over the mastoid process, the parotid gland, the angle of the mandible, and the lower part of the auricle. A $C2$ lesion would cause decreased sensation in this distribution.\n2.  **Motor Innervation**:\n    *   **Ansa Cervicalis**: This nerve loop innervates the infrahyoid muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid), which are responsible for depressing the hyoid bone and larynx. The ansa is formed by a superior root (fibers from $C1$) and an inferior root (fibers from $C2$ and $C3$). An isolated $C2$ lesion would damage part of the inferior root, leading to *weakness* (paresis), but not complete paralysis, of the infrahyoid muscles, as the $C1$ and $C3$ contributions would be spared. This would manifest as mild weakness in depressing the hyoid bone.\n    *   **Phrenic Nerve**: The phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, is formed from the anterior rami of $C3$, $C4$, and $C5$. The $C2$ ramus does not contribute to the phrenic nerve. Therefore, there will be **no diaphragmatic deficit**.\n    *   **Deep Prevertebral Muscles**: As per the foundational base, $C2$ provides segmental supply to these muscles. A unilateral lesion would cause mild, often clinically subtle, weakness in neck flexion.\n\n**Summary for Patient X ($C2$ Lesion)**: Expected deficits include sensory loss on the scalp behind the ear and over the angle of the jaw, and mild weakness of the infrahyoid muscles.\n\n**Analysis for Patient Y: Unilateral $C4$ Anterior Ramus Lesion**\n\n1.  **Cutaneous Innervation**: The $C4$ anterior ramus contributes to the supraclavicular nerves.\n    *   **Supraclavicular Nerves**: Arise from $C3$ and $C4$. They supply the skin over the supraclavicular fossa, the \"shoulder tip\" (acromioclavicular region), and the upper pectoral region. A $C4$ lesion would cause sensory loss in this \"cape-like\" distribution.\n2.  **Motor Innervation**:\n    *   **Phrenic Nerve**: As stated, this nerve arises from $C3$, $C4$, and $C5$. The foundational base highlights the importance of the \"dominant segmental contribution,\" which is universally recognized as $C4$. Therefore, an isolated, unilateral $C4$ anterior ramus lesion will cause **ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis**. On imaging (like a chest X-ray), this appears as an elevation of the affected hemidiaphragm.\n    *   **Ansa Cervicalis**: The ansa cervicalis is formed by fibers from $C1$, $C2$, and $C3$. The $C4$ ramus does not contribute. Therefore, the infrahyoid muscles will be **spared**, and their strength will be preserved.\n    *   **Deep Prevertebral Muscles**: $C4$ provides segmental supply to these muscles. A unilateral lesion would contribute to mild weakness in neck flexion.\n\n**Summary for Patient Y ($C4$ Lesion)**: Expected deficits include ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and sensory loss over the shoulder tip and clavicular region. Infrahyoid muscle function should be normal.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Patient X: decreased cutaneous sensation posterior to the auricle and over the parotid–angle of mandible region with mild weakness in depressing the hyoid during swallowing; Patient Y: ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis with elevation of the hemidiaphragm and numbness over the shoulder tip and supraclavicular fossa, with infrahyoid strength largely preserved.**\n\n*   **Patient X Analysis**: The sensory deficits described (\"posterior to the auricle\" and \"parotid-angle of mandible region\") perfectly match the distribution of the lesser occipital ($C2$) and great auricular ($C2, C3$) nerves. The \"mild weakness in depressing the hyoid\" correctly reflects the partial deficit to the ansa cervicalis from a $C2$ lesion. This description is accurate.\n*   **Patient Y Analysis**: The \"ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis with elevation of the hemidiaphragm\" is the classic sign of a phrenic nerve lesion, expected from a dominant $C4$ root injury. The \"numbness over the shoulder tip and supraclavicular fossa\" matches the distribution of the supraclavicular nerves ($C3, C4$). The statement that \"infrahyoid strength largely preserved\" is also correct, as $C4$ does not contribute to the ansa cervicalis. This description is accurate.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. Both descriptions are consistent with the predicted neurological deficits.\n\n**B. Patient X: loss of tongue protrusion and trapezius paralysis with preserved scalp sensation; Patient Y: loss of sensation of the auricle and parotid region without respiratory change.**\n\n*   **Patient X Analysis**: Tongue protrusion is a function of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve $XII$). Trapezius function is via the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve $XI$). The problem explicitly excludes cranial nerve injury. \"Preserved scalp sensation\" is incorrect, as the lesser occipital nerve ($C2$) would be affected.\n*   **Patient Y Analysis**: Sensation of the auricle and parotid is from the great auricular nerve ($C2, C3$), not $C4$. \"Without respiratory change\" is incorrect, as a $C4$ lesion would cause significant respiratory deficit (diaphragmatic paralysis).\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Patient X: shoulder tip numbness and diaphragmatic paresis; Patient Y: posterior scalp numbness with hoarseness due to laryngeal muscle paralysis.**\n\n*   **Patient X Analysis**: Shoulder tip numbness is a $C4$ sign. Diaphragmatic paresis is a $C3, C4, C5$ sign. Neither is caused by a $C2$ lesion.\n*   **Patient Y Analysis**: Posterior scalp numbness is a $C2$ sign. Hoarseness from laryngeal muscle paralysis is a sign of a lesion to the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve $X$), which is excluded.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The deficits are mismatched with the lesions.\n\n**D. Patient X: anesthesia of the external nose tip and forehead; Patient Y: sternocleidomastoid paralysis and absent gag reflex.**\n\n*   **Patient X Analysis**: Sensation of the nose and forehead is from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve $V$), which is excluded.\n*   **Patient Y Analysis**: Sternocleidomastoid paralysis is a sign of a spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve $XI$) lesion. An absent gag reflex involves cranial nerves $IX$ and $X$. All are excluded.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The deficits are caused by cranial nerve lesions, which are explicitly ruled out.\n\n**E. Patient X: complete paralysis of all infrahyoid muscles including thyrohyoid and geniohyoid; Patient Y: no clinically detectable deficits.**\n\n*   **Patient X Analysis**: A $C2$ lesion would cause only partial weakness of the infrahyoid muscles, not complete paralysis. The thyrohyoid and geniohyoid muscles are innervated by $C1$ fibers and would be spared. The geniohyoid is a suprahyoid muscle, not infrahyoid.\n*   **Patient Y Analysis**: A $C4$ lesion would cause very clear and clinically detectable deficits: diaphragmatic paralysis and significant sensory loss. The statement \"no clinically detectable deficits\" is false.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option contains multiple anatomical errors and incorrect clinical conclusions.",
