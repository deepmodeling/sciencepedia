In neutral ulnar variance (defined on a posteroanterior radiograph as the relative distal projection of the ulna to the radius at the distal radioulnar joint, with positive values indicating a longer ulna), classic experimental observations report that the distal radius transmits a fraction $0.82$ of the axial load and the distal ulna transmits a fraction $0.18$ of the axial load.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and conditions explicitly provided are:\n-   A model of a cadaveric wrist in neutral posture is loaded axially.\n-   Ulnar variance is defined as the relative distal projection of the ulna to the radius, with neutral ulnar variance corresponding to a value of $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   At neutral ulnar variance ($0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the fraction of axial load transmitted by the distal radius is $0.82$.\n-   At neutral ulnar variance ($0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the fraction of axial load transmitted by the distal ulna is $0.18$.\n-   The fraction of axial load borne by the ulna varies linearly with ulnar variance for small deviations near neutral.\n-   At an ulnar variance of $+2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the fraction of axial load transmitted by the ulna is $0.42$.\n-   An assumption is given: \"conservation of load transmission between the two bones,\" which implies the sum of the fractions transmitted by the radius and ulna is unity.\n-   The task is to estimate the load fractions for the radius and ulna at neutral ulnar variance ($0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ulnar variance.\n-   The final answer must be reported as four decimal values, rounded to four significant figures, in the order: radius fraction at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, ulna fraction at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, radius fraction at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and ulna fraction at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of wrist biomechanics. The concept of ulnar variance and its effect on load distribution across the radiocarpal and ulnocarpal joints is a standard topic in orthopedics and bioengineering. The given load-sharing fractions ($82\\%$ on the radius and $18\\%$ on the ulna at neutral) are consistent with classic experimental findings (e.g., Palmer & Werner, 1984). The assumption of linearity for small deviations is a reasonable and common modeling approach.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct data points for the ulnar load fraction as a function of ulnar variance, which is sufficient to uniquely determine the parameters of the assumed linear model. The \"conservation of load\" provides a clear constraint to determine the load fraction on the radius from the ulna's fraction.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided data points are consistent. For neutral variance, the sum of fractions is $0.82 + 0.18 = 1.00$, which agrees with the \"conservation of load\" principle. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe phrasing \"estimate... the fractions... in neutral posture\" might initially seem tautological, as these values are given. However, in the context of building and applying a model, this is a request to use the derived model to predict the values at one of the input data points, serving as a verification of the model's construction before applying it to a new, unknown point. This does not invalidate the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $x$ denote the ulnar variance in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). Let $F_u(x)$ be the fraction of axial load transmitted through the ulna, and $F_r(x)$ be the fraction transmitted through the radius.\n\nThe problem states two primary conditions:\n1.  The total load is conserved between the radius and ulna:\n    $$F_r(x) + F_u(x) = 1$$\n2.  The fraction of load on the ulna, $F_u(x)$, is a linear function of the ulnar variance, $x$:\n    $$F_u(x) = mx + c$$\n    where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the intercept.\n\nWe are given two data points to determine the parameters $m$ and $c$:\n-   Point 1: At neutral ulnar variance, $x_1 = 0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the ulna transmits a fraction $F_u(0) = 0.18$. This gives the point $(0, 0.18)$.\n-   Point 2: At an ulnar variance of $x_2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the ulna transmits a fraction $F_u(2.5) = 0.42$. This gives the point $(2.5, 0.42)$.\n\nWe can use these points to find the equation of the line. The intercept $c$ is the value of $F_u(x)$ at $x=0$. From Point 1, we have:\n$$c = F_u(0) = 0.18$$\n\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as the change in $F_u$ divided by the change in $x$:\n$$m = \\frac{F_u(x_2) - F_u(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{0.42 - 0.18}{2.5 - 0} = \\frac{0.24}{2.5}$$\n$$m = 0.096$$\n\nThus, the linear model for the fraction of load transmitted by the ulna is:\n$$F_u(x) = 0.096x + 0.18$$\n\nUsing the conservation of load, we can find the model for the radius:\n$$F_r(x) = 1 - F_u(x) = 1 - (0.096x + 0.18)$$\n$$F_r(x) = 0.82 - 0.096x$$\n\nNow we can calculate the required fractions.\n\n**1. Fractions at neutral ulnar variance ($x=0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$):**\nUsing our derived models at $x=0$:\n-   Radius fraction: $F_r(0) = 0.82 - 0.096(0) = 0.82$\n-   Ulna fraction: $F_u(0) = 0.096(0) + 0.18 = 0.18$\nThese results correctly match the input data provided in the problem statement.\n\n**2. Fractions at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ulnar variance ($x=2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$):**\nWe evaluate the models at $x=2$:\n-   Ulna fraction: $F_u(2) = 0.096(2) + 0.18 = 0.192 + 0.18 = 0.372$\n-   Radius fraction: $F_r(2) = 0.82 - 0.096(2) = 0.82 - 0.192 = 0.628$\nAs a check, the sum of fractions is $0.372 + 0.628 = 1.000$, which is consistent with the conservation of load.\n\nThe problem requires the answer as four decimal values, rounded to four significant figures.\n-   $F_r(0) = 0.82$. To four significant figures, this is $0.8200$.\n-   $F_u(0) = 0.18$. To four significant figures, this is $0.1800$.\n-   $F_r(2) = 0.628$. To four significant figures, this is $0.6280$.\n-   $F_u(2) = 0.372$. To four significant figures, this is $0.3720$.\n\nThe final results are presented in the specified order: radius at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, ulna at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, radius at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, ulna at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.",

            "problem": "A patient presents with wrist pain after a fall onto an outstretched hand. You are asked to reason from first principles about how the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) participates in ulnocarpal load sharing and how different TFCC lesions alter the fraction of compressive load borne by the ulna. The TFCC comprises a central fibrocartilaginous articular disc and peripheral ligamentous structures (including the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments and the ulnocarpal ligaments), which together transmit load from the ulnar carpus (primarily the lunate and triquetrum) to the distal ulna while stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint.\n\nModel the wrist under axial compression as three parallel load paths, each behaving as a linear elastic spring according to Hooke’s law ($F = kx$):\n- a radial column path with stiffness $k_{r}$,\n- a TFCC central disc path with stiffness $k_{c}$,\n- a TFCC peripheral ligamentous path with stiffness $k_{p}$.\n\nIn the intact state, let the stiffnesses be $k_{r} = 80$, $k_{c} = 15$, and $k_{p} = 5$ (arbitrary but internally consistent units). Consider two lesions:\n1. A central perforation of the TFCC disc that reduces its effective stiffness to $k_{c}^{\\prime} = 0.2 k_{c}$ (reflecting substantial loss of load-bearing area of the central disc), with peripheral structures intact ($k_{p}$ unchanged).\n2.

Then compute the ulnar load fraction for each lesion and finally compute the difference between the peripheral tear and the central perforation.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It presents a simplified, but scientifically grounded, biomechanical model of the wrist joint. The model utilizes the principle of parallel linear elastic springs (Hooke's law), which is a standard method for first-order analysis of load distribution in biological structures. All parameters are clearly defined, and the objectives are quantifiable and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is well-posed and solvable.\n\nThe problem models the wrist's axial load-bearing capacity as three parallel springs, subjected to an equal compressive displacement, $x$. The forces generated in each path are given by Hooke's law, $F = kx$.\nThe three paths are:\n1. The radial column, with stiffness $k_r$ and force $F_r = k_r x$.\n2. The TFCC central disc, with stiffness $k_c$ and force $F_c = k_c x$.\n3. The TFCC peripheral ligaments, with stiffness $k_p$ and force $F_p = k_p x$.\n\nThe total axial force, $F_{total}$, is the sum of the forces in these parallel paths:\n$$F_{total} = F_r + F_c + F_p = k_r x + k_c x + k_p x = (k_r + k_c + k_p)x$$\n\nThe total force transmitted through the ulnar side of the wrist is the sum of forces through the two TFCC components:\n$$F_{ulnar} = F_c + F_p = k_c x + k_p x = (k_c + k_p)x$$\n\nThe ulnar load fraction, which we will denote as $U$, is defined as the ratio of the ulnar force to the total force:\n$$U = \\frac{F_{ulnar}}{F_{total}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces, we derive the general formula for the ulnar load fraction:\n$$U = \\frac{(k_c + k_p)x}{(k_r + k_c + k_p)x} = \\frac{k_c + k_p}{k_r + k_c + k_p}$$\nThe displacement $x$ cancels, indicating that the load fraction is independent of the magnitude of the displacement or total force, and depends only on the relative stiffnesses of the components.\n\nThe initial stiffness values for the intact state are given as $k_{r} = 80$, $k_{c} = 15$, and $k_{p} = 5$ in arbitrary units.\n\nNow, we analyze the two lesion scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Central Perforation\nA central perforation reduces the stiffness of the TFCC disc to $k_{c}^{\\prime} = 0.2 k_{c}$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two dimensionless morphometric ratios for the wrist and their interpretation in the context of carpal stability. The calculations are based on first principles of proportional anatomy, treating the radiographic measurements as direct inputs for the defined ratios. The assumption of uniform radiographic magnification is valid for calculating ratios, as any magnification factor, $M$, would apply to both the numerator and the denominator, thus canceling out:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Measured Length}_1}{\\text{Measured Length}_2} = \\frac{M \\times \\text{True Length}_1}{M \\times \\text{True Length}_2} = \\frac{\\text{True Length}_1}{\\text{True Length}_2}\n$$\n\nThe given measurements are:\n- Carpal height, $H_c = 28.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Third metacarpal length, $L_{MC3} = 60.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Capitate length, $L_{Cap} = 21.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Carpal Ratios**\n\nFirst, we compute the carpal height ratio, also known as the Youm index or Youm method. This ratio is defined as the carpal height divided by the length of the third metacarpal.\nLet $CHR_{Youm}$ denote this ratio.\n$$\nCHR_{Youm} = \\frac{H_c}{L_{MC3}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$\nCHR_{Youm} = \\frac{28.8}{60.4} \\approx 0.47682119...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\nCHR_{Youm} \\approx 0.4768\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the revised carpal height ratio, which is referenced to the capitate length. This ratio was introduced to be less dependent on individual variations in metacarpal length.\nLet $CHR_{Rev}$ denote this ratio.\n$$\nCHR_{Rev} = \\frac{H_c}{L_{Cap}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$\nCHR_{Rev} = \\frac{28.8}{21.0} \\approx 1.37142857...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\nCHR_{Rev} \\approx 1.371\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of Results**\n\nTo interpret these values, we must compare them to established normative data for a healthy adult population.\n- The widely accepted normal value for the carpal height ratio (Youm method), $CHR_{Youm}$, is $0.54 \\pm 0.03$. This corresponds to a normal range of approximately $0.51$ to $0.57$.\n- The accepted normal value for the revised carpal height ratio, $CHR_{Rev}$, is $1.57 \\pm 0.05$. This corresponds to a normal range of approximately $1.52$ to $1.62$.\n\nComparing our computed values to these standards:\n- The calculated $CHR_{Youm}$ of $0.4768$ is significantly below the lower limit of the normal range ($0.51$).\n- The calculated $CHR_{Rev}$ of $1.371$ is also significantly below the lower limit of the normal range ($1.52$).\n\nBoth indices consistently demonstrate a marked reduction in relative carpal height. This finding is the quantitative definition of **carpal collapse**.\n\nCarpal collapse refers to the loss of vertical height of the carpus, which is a key indicator of significant structural derangement and instability. This process is a common endpoint for several wrist pathologies, most notably scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) and scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC). In these conditions, disruption of key ligamentous constraints (e.g., the scapholunate interosseous ligament in SLAC) or loss of scaphoid integrity (e.g., a scaphoid waist nonunion in SNAC) leads to a predictable pattern of carpal malalignment. The capitate, which is the keystone of the distal carpal row, migrates proximally into the space created by the flexion of the scaphoid and extension of the lunate (a deformity known as Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability or DISI, characteristic of SLAC wrist). This proximal subsidence of the capitate directly reduces the carpal height, $H_c$, measured from the radius to the base of the third metacarpal.\n\nThe computed ratios, being significantly below normal, strongly indicate the presence of carpal collapse. The severity of the reduction suggests an advanced state of instability, although, as per the problem constraints, no specific stage of SLAC or SNAC can or should be inferred from these ratios alone. The measurement of carpal height loss is a fundamental tool for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring the progression of these debilitating wrist conditions.",
