            "problem": "A spherical eukaryotic cell contains a small, uncharged metabolite that is produced at the inner face of the plasma membrane and spreads through the cytosol by molecular diffusion. Assume the cytosol can be modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic continuum and that transport is purely diffusive with no advection, binding, or reaction. Start from Fick’s first law of diffusion and the local conservation of mass to obtain the diffusion equation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the maximum radius $R_{\\text{max}}$ of a spherical cell, such that a metabolite produced at the plasma membrane can diffuse to the center within a characteristic time $t^{\\ast}$. The solution will be developed in three parts: first, the derivation of the governing diffusion equation; second, the establishment of the relationship between characteristic diffusion distance and time; and third, the calculation of $R_{\\text{max}}$ using the provided parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Diffusion Equation**\n\nThe transport of the metabolite is stated to be purely diffusive and governed by the local conservation of mass. We begin with Fick's first law, which relates the diffusive flux $\\vec{J}$ to the gradient of the concentration $C(\\vec{r}, t)$. In an isotropic medium, this is given by:\n$$ \\vec{J}(\\vec{r}, t) = -D \\nabla C(\\vec{r}, t) $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector, and $t$ is time. The negative sign indicates that the net movement of particles is from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.\n\nThe principle of local conservation of mass for a species with concentration $C$ is expressed by the continuity equation. Since the problem specifies no advection, binding, or reaction, there are no source or sink terms in the cytosol volume. The rate of change of concentration at a point is equal to the negative divergence of the flux at that point:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C(\\vec{r}, t)}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}(\\vec{r}, t) $$\n\nTo obtain the diffusion equation, we substitute Fick's first law into the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla C) $$\nThe problem states that the cytosol can be modeled as a homogeneous continuum, which implies that the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant with respect to position. Therefore, $D$ can be moved outside the divergence operator:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla C) $$\nThe divergence of the gradient of a scalar field is the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$. This yields the diffusion equation, also known as Fick's second law:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 C $$\n\n**Part 2: Characteristic Diffusion Distance and Time**\n\nThe problem asks for a relationship connecting a characteristic distance to elapsed time. This relationship can be derived by considering the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a particle undergoing a random walk, which is the physical basis of diffusion. The solution to the diffusion equation for a point source shows that the variance of the particle's position grows linearly with time. For diffusion in $d$ spatial dimensions, the MSD, denoted as $\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle$, is given by the Einstein relation for diffusion:\n$$ \\langle r^2(t) \\rangle = 2dDt $$\nIn this problem, the metabolite diffuses in the three-dimensional space of the cytosol, so $d=3$. The MSD is therefore:\n$$ \\langle r^2(t) \\rangle = 6Dt $$\nThe \"characteristic diffusion distance\" is naturally defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) displacement, $r_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\langle r^2(t) \\rangle}$. This distance represents the typical magnitude of displacement of a diffusing particle after time $t$. The problem asks for the maximum cell radius $R_{\\text{max}}$ such that a metabolite starting at the plasma membrane (at radius $R$) \"typically reaches\" the geometric center (at radius $0$) within time $t^{\\ast}$. We can model this by setting the RMS displacement equal to the cell radius. Thus, for a maximum radius $R_{\\text{max}}$ and a given time $t^{\\ast}$, we have:\n$$ R_{\\text{max}}^2 = 6 D_{\\text{eff}} t^{\\ast} $$\nHere, we use the effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{eff}}$, to account for the crowded environment of the cytosol.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Maximum Cell Radius**\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{eff}}$. The problem provides the uncrowded diffusion coefficient, $D_{0} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, the macromolecular volume fraction, $\\phi = 0.35$, and the relation $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_{0} (1 - \\phi)$.\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 - 0.35) $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.65 $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = 3.9 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nNext, we use the derived relationship to calculate the square of the maximum radius, $R_{\\text{max}}^2$, using the specified arrival time $t^{\\ast} = 0.300 \\ \\text{s}$.\n$$ R_{\\text{max}}^2 = 6 D_{\\text{eff}} t^{\\ast} $$\n$$ R_{\\text{max}}^2 = 6 \\times (3.9 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.300 \\ \\text{s}) $$\n$$ R_{\\text{max}}^2 = 7.02 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} $$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find $R_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{max}} = \\sqrt{7.02 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2}} $$\n$$ R_{\\text{max}} \\approx 2.6495282 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m} $$\n\nFinally, we convert the result from meters to micrometers and round to four significant figures, as requested. The conversion factor is $1 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}$.\n$$ R_{\\text{max}} \\approx (2.6495282 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\ \\mu\\text{m}}{10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}}\\right) $$\n$$ R_{\\text{max}} \\approx 26.495282 \\ \\mu\\text{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ R_{\\text{max}} \\approx 26.50 \\ \\mu\\text{m} $$\nThis result indicates the physical constraint that diffusion imposes on the size of cells that rely on this mechanism for intracellular transport over short timescales.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely topology of a multi-pass membrane protein, defined by the number of transmembrane segments (TMS) and the orientation of its termini and loops.\n\n1.  **Number of Transmembrane Segments:** The problem states that hydropathy analysis identified \"four prominent hydrophobic segments\". The assumption of \"no re-entrant loops\" confirms these should be treated as true TMS. Therefore, the protein has **4 TMS**.

            "introduction": "Cellular life is dynamic, involving constant trafficking of materials across membranes. The process of endocytosis, where the cell internalizes substances by forming vesicles from its plasma membrane, culminates in a dramatic scission event. This \"pinch-off\" is powered by the mechanochemical enzyme dynamin, which converts the chemical energy of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis into mechanical force. This problem asks you to connect the molecular-level activity of an enzyme to a large-scale cellular process by calculating how an inhibitor that reduces dynamin's catalytic rate ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) affects the overall flux of vesicle formation .",
            "id": "5094249",
            "problem": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis proceeds through sequential stages of coat assembly, membrane invagination, neck formation, and scission to release a vesicle into the cytosol. Dynamin is a large guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-hydrolyzing enzyme (GTPase) that assembles into a helical collar around the neck of deeply invaginated endocytic pits. A widely accepted physical basis for scission is that hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin provides free energy that is transduced into mechanical work via conformational changes of the assembled dynamin helix, increasing membrane curvature and line tension at the neck until the energetic barrier to fission is crossed. Two foundational principles relevant here are: (i) enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions release free energy that can be coupled to mechanical work, and (ii) at saturating substrate concentration, the turnover rate of an enzyme-limited step follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with velocity proportional to the catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and the amount of active enzyme. Assume the following simplified, realistic model for a population of endocytic pits in a cell: scission is the single rate-limiting step of the pathway, the cytosolic GTP concentration is saturating, and the per-pit scission rate is directly proportional to dynamin’s $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.\n\nYou are given that there are $N = 200$ active endocytic pits at steady state, each with a baseline scission rate $r_{s} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ under control conditions. A small-molecule dynamin inhibitor reduces $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ by $50\\%$ without changing the affinity for GTP or the amount of dynamin at the neck. Under these assumptions, choose the option that best explains how dynamin GTPase activity couples to membrane scission and correctly predicts the quantitative effect of the inhibitor on endocytic flux and the qualitative morphological outcome at the plasma membrane.\n\nA. Dynamin assembles into a helical collar whose GTP hydrolysis drives conformational constriction and torque at the neck, lowering the energetic barrier to fission; halving $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ halves the per-pit scission rate at saturating GTP, reducing the endocytic flux from $J_{0} = N r_{s} = 6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $J' = 3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, with accumulation of long-lived, narrow-necked coated pits that fail to scission.\n\nB. Dynamin primarily stabilizes the neck and opposes fission; inhibiting its GTPase activity destabilizes the neck, thereby increasing scission frequency and endocytic flux to $J' = 12\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ while reducing the number of coated pits at the surface.\n\nC. Dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis is dispensable because other curvature-generating proteins provide all the mechanical work; inhibiting GTPase activity leaves the flux unchanged at $J' = 6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and produces no characteristic accumulation of stalled pits.\n\nD. Dynamin hydrolysis drives early coat assembly rather than scission; inhibiting GTPase activity reduces the number of nascent pits, not the scission rate, so the flux remains at $J' = 6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ but surface pits are fewer and shallow, without narrow necks.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of dynamin's role, the quantitative effect of an inhibitor on endocytic flux, and the resulting morphological outcome.\n\n**1. Dynamin's Role and Mechanism**\nAs described in the problem, dynamin is a mechanochemical GTPase. It assembles into a helical collar around the neck of an invaginated pit. The chemical energy from GTP hydrolysis is converted into mechanical work (constriction and torque), which increases membrane tension and curvature, ultimately overcoming the energy barrier for membrane scission (fission).\n\n**2. Quantitative Effect on Endocytic Flux**\nThe total endocytic flux ($J$) is the rate of vesicle formation. With scission being the rate-limiting step, the flux is the product of the number of active pits ($N$) and the scission rate per pit ($r_s$).\n\n*   **Initial Flux ($J_0$):**\n    Given $N = 200$ pits and $r_s = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    $$J_0 = N \\times r_s = 200 \\times 0.03\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\n*   **Effect of Inhibitor:**\n    The problem states that GTP is saturating, and the scission rate ($r_s$) is directly proportional to dynamin's catalytic rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. The inhibitor reduces $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ by $50\\%$. Therefore, the per-pit scission rate is also halved.\n    The new scission rate, $r_s'$, is:\n    $$r_s' = 0.5 \\times r_s = 0.5 \\times 0.03\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\n*   **New Flux ($J'$):**\n    The new flux is calculated with the new scission rate:\n    $$J' = N \\times r_s' = 200 \\times 0.015\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n    The flux is reduced by 50%, from $6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\n**3. Qualitative Morphological Outcome**\nInhibiting the rate-limiting scission step creates a bottleneck. Coated pits will form and invaginate but will be unable to detach efficiently from the plasma membrane. This leads to a characteristic accumulation of stalled, deeply invaginated coated pits with long, narrow necks decorated by the inhibited dynamin. The lifetime of these pits ($1/r_s$) doubles, making them \"long-lived\".\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n*   **Option A** correctly describes the mechanism, calculates the flux reduction from $6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and predicts the accumulation of long-lived, narrow-necked pits. This matches our analysis.\n*   **Option B** proposes an incorrect mechanism and predicts an increase in flux.\n*   **Option C** incorrectly claims GTP hydrolysis is dispensable and predicts no change in flux.\n*   **Option D** misidentifies dynamin's role as being in coat assembly, not scission, and predicts an incorrect morphology.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the correct comprehensive answer.",
