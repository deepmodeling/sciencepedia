Consider a subject in whom the total effective epithelial surface area of the choroid plexus is $A=15\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$. The epithelium secretes CSF at a uniform local rate (volumetric secretion per unit time per unit area) of $J=0.02\\ \\mathrm{ml/(min\\cdot cm^2)}$. Assume that secretion is spatially uniform over the epithelium, that extrachoroidal CSF production is negligible, and that the system is in steady state so that produced volume accumulates at the same rate it is secreted.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition that a uniform surface secretion density multiplied by surface area yields a total volumetric secretion rate, and that a rate given “per minute” converts to “per hour” by multiplying by the number of minutes in an hour, determine the total CSF produced in one hour for this subject.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the total volume of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) produced in one hour, based on a given surface area of secretion and a uniform secretion rate per unit area. The solution must be derived from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the total volumetric secretion rate, the secretion rate per unit area, and the total surface area. As stated in the problem, the total volumetric secretion rate, which we shall denote by $Q$, is the product of the uniform local secretion rate (a flux), denoted by $J$, and the total effective surface area, denoted by $A$.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$Q = J \\times A$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe total effective epithelial surface area is $A = 15\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$.\nThe uniform local secretion rate is $J = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{ml/(min \\cdot cm^2)}$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the equation to find the total volumetric secretion rate $Q$ in units of milliliters per minute ($\\mathrm{ml/min}$).\n\n$$Q = \\left(0.02\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm^2}}\\right) \\times \\left(15\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}\\right)$$\n\nThe area units ($\\mathrm{cm^2}$) cancel out, yielding a result in $\\mathrm{ml/min}$:\n$$Q = 0.02 \\times 15\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n$$Q = 0.3\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in terms of production per hour. We must convert the rate from milliliters per minute to milliliters per hour ($\\mathrm{ml/h}$). The conversion factor between minutes and hours is given by the exact relationship:\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{hour} = 60\\ \\mathrm{minutes}$$\n\nTo convert the rate $Q$ to the hourly rate, which we denote $Q_h$, we multiply by the number of minutes in an hour:\n$$Q_h = Q \\times \\left(60\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $Q$:\n$$Q_h = \\left(0.3\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{min}}\\right) \\times \\left(60\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\right)$$\n\nThe time units ($\\mathrm{min}$) cancel, resulting in a rate in $\\mathrm{ml/h}$:\n$$Q_h = 0.3 \\times 60\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{h}}$$\n$$Q_h = 18\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ml}}{\\mathrm{h}}$$\n\nThe question asks for the \"total CSF produced in one hour\" and to \"Express your answer in $\\mathrm{ml/h}$\". A rate of $18\\ \\mathrm{ml/h}$ means that in one hour, a volume of $18\\ \\mathrm{ml}$ is produced. The requested quantity is therefore the numerical value of this rate.\n\nFinally, the problem specifies that the final result must be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $18$. To express this numerical value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$18.00$$\n\nThus, the total CSF produced, a rate expressed in $\\mathrm{ml/h}$ and formatted to the required precision, is $18.00\\ \\mathrm{ml/h}$.",

This practice  delves into the physics of fluid flow to reveal a crucial principle: the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is exquisitely sensitive to the radius of the channel, $r$. Understanding this powerful $Q \\propto r^4$ relationship is key to appreciating why even a minor constriction, known as stenosis, can have dramatic consequences, leading to conditions like obstructive hydrocephalus.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the volumetric flow rate $Q$ of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the cerebral aqueduct, modeled as a straight circular cylinder, and then to calculate the fractional reduction in $Q$ due to a stenosis (constriction) of the aqueduct's radius. The derivation must begin from the steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.\n\nLet the cylindrical coordinate system be $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $z$ is the axial direction along the aqueduct, $r$ is the radial coordinate, and $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = v_r \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r + v_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + v_z \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. Let the radius of the aqueduct be $R$ and its length be $L$. The pressure difference driving the flow is $\\Delta P$. The fluid has dynamic viscosity $\\mu$.\n\nThe problem states to assume steady, axisymmetric, fully developed, laminar flow. These assumptions translate to the following conditions on the velocity field:\n1.  **Steady flow**: All time derivatives are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetric flow**: All derivatives with respect to the azimuthal angle are zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. Also, there is no swirl, so the azimuthal velocity component is zero, $v_\\theta = 0$.\n3.  **Unidirectional flow**: For flow in a straight cylinder, the velocity is purely axial, so the radial velocity component is zero, $v_r = 0$.\n4.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile does not change along the axial direction, which means $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nWe start with the equation of continuity for an incompressible fluid ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$) in cylindrical coordinates:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r v_r) + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nApplying the assumptions $v_r = 0$, $v_\\theta = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, the equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. This is consistent with the `fully developed flow` assumption. This also implies that $v_z$ can only be a function of $r$, i.e., $v_z = v_z(r)$.\n\nNext, we simplify the Navier-Stokes momentum equations.\nThe $r$-momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( v_r \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{v_\\theta^2}{r} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial r}\\right) - \\frac{v_r}{r^2} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v_r}{\\partial \\theta^2} - \\frac{2}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_r}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nWith $v_r = 0$ and $v_\\theta = 0$, every term except the pressure gradient vanishes, leaving:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} $$\nThis implies that the pressure $p$ is not a function of the radial coordinate $r$.\n\nThe $\\theta$-momentum equation simplifies similarly to $0 = -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}$, which is satisfied since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}=0$.\n\nThe $z$-momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nApplying the assumptions ($v_r=0$, $v_\\theta=0$, $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}=0$), the equation reduces to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) $$\nSince we established that $p$ is not a function of $r$ or $\\theta$, and $v_z$ is not a function of $z$ or $\\theta$, we can rewrite the partial derivatives as ordinary derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dv_z}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} $$\nThe left side of this equation is a function of $r$ only, and the right side is a function of $z$ only. This can only be true if both sides are equal to a constant. For fully developed flow, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ is indeed constant. The pressure drops by $\\Delta P$ over the length $L$, so $\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dv_z}{dr}\\right) = r \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} \\right) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{r^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_1 $$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating again:\n$$ \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nWe apply the boundary conditions. First, the velocity must be finite at the centerline of the aqueduct ($r=0$). Since $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\nThe velocity profile becomes:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_2 $$\nSecond, the no-slip boundary condition at the aqueduct wall ($r=R$) requires the fluid velocity to be zero: $v_z(R)=0$.\n$$ 0 = \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ and $\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$ into the velocity profile gives:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) - \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) $$\nThis is the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of Hagen-Poiseuille flow.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the aqueduct:\n$$ Q = \\int_A v_z(r) dA = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R^4}{8\\mu L} $$\nThe problem statement uses $r$ to denote the radius of the cylinder. To match this notation, we replace $R$ with $r$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r^4}{8\\mu L} $$\nThis expression shows that the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is proportional to the fourth power of the radius $r$, assuming $\\Delta P$, $L$, and $\\mu$ are constant: $Q \\propto r^4$.\n\nNow, we determine the fractional reduction in $Q$ when the radius decreases by $20\\%$. Let the initial radius be $r_1$ and the corresponding flow rate be $Q_1$. The new radius is $r_2 = r_1 - 0.20 r_1 = 0.80 r_1$. The new flow rate is $Q_2$.\nFrom the derived relationship, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{(\\pi \\Delta P / 8\\mu L) r_2^4}{(\\pi \\Delta P / 8\\mu L) r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nSubstituting $r_2 = 0.80 r_1$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{0.80 r_1}{r_1}\\right)^4 = (0.80)^4 = 0.4096 $$\nThe fractional reduction in flow rate is given by $\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_1}$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.5904$ already has four significant figures.",
