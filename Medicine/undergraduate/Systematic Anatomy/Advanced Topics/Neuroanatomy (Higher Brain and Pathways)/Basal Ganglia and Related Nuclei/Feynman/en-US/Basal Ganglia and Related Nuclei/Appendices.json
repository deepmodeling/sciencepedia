            "problem": "A right-sided lacunar infarct damages the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) in a patient who subsequently develops violent flinging movements of the left limbs characteristic of hemiballismus. Use the canonical organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit and the following foundational facts to reason through the net effect of this lesion. Foundational facts include: (1) excitatory synapses increase postsynaptic firing rate and are mediated by glutamate, while inhibitory synapses decrease postsynaptic firing rate and are mediated by Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA); (2) the STN sends glutamatergic excitatory projections to the Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) and the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr); (3) the GPi and SNr send GABAergic inhibitory outputs to motor thalamus; (4) thalamus sends excitatory projections to motor cortex; (5) pallidal output influences contralateral limb movement via thalamocortical projections and corticospinal decussation; and (6) lesions decrease the firing rate of the lesioned structure. Let the firing rates be denoted by $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$, $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$, and a scalar measure of pallidal inhibitory output to thalamus by $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$, and let the thalamocortical excitatory drive to motor cortex be $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Clinical Scenario**: A right-sided lacunar infarct damages the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN).\n- **Symptom**: The patient develops violent flinging movements of the left limbs (hemiballismus).\n- **Task**: Use the canonical organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit and a set of foundational facts to reason through the net effect of the lesion.\n- **Foundational Fact (1)**: Excitatory synapses (glutamate) increase postsynaptic firing rate; inhibitory synapses (GABA) decrease postsynaptic firing rate.\n- **Foundational Fact (2)**: The STN sends glutamatergic (excitatory) projections to the Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) and the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr).\n- **Foundational Fact (3)**: The GPi and SNr send GABAergic (inhibitory) outputs to the motor thalamus.\n- **Foundational Fact (4)**: The thalamus sends excitatory projections to the motor cortex.\n- **Foundational Fact (5)**: Pallidal output influences contralateral limb movement via thalamocortical projections and corticospinal decussation.\n- **Foundational Fact (6)**: Lesions decrease the firing rate of the lesioned structure.\n- **Variables**:\n    - $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$: firing rate of the STN.\n    - $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$: firing rate of the GPi.\n    - $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$: scalar measure of pallidal inhibitory output to thalamus.\n    - $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$: thalamocortical excitatory drive to motor cortex.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. The description of the basal ganglia circuit components (STN, GPi, Thalamus, Cortex), their synaptic connections, neurotransmitter types (glutamate, GABA), and the clinical correlation between an STN lesion and contralateral hemiballismus are all standard textbook knowledge in neuroscience and clinical neurology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial condition (STN lesion), a set of rules (the foundational facts), and a specific question about the resulting causal chain. The variables are explicitly defined. This structure allows for a unique, step-by-step logical deduction to arrive at a solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It relies on established facts and definitions, avoiding any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to deduce the correct mechanistic pathway. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Mechanistic Chain\n\nWe are asked to determine the sequence of events following a lesion of the right STN that results in left-sided hemiballismus. We will use the provided foundational facts to construct this chain. Let a downward arrow ($\\downarrow$) denote a decrease in a quantity and an upward arrow ($\\uparrow$) denote an increase.\n\n1.  **STN Lesion**: The problem states there is a lacunar infarct damaging the right STN. According to foundational fact ($6$), a lesion decreases the firing rate of the lesioned structure. Therefore, the firing rate of the right STN, $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$, decreases.\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{STN}} \\downarrow$$\n2.  **Effect on GPi**: Foundational fact ($2$) states that the STN sends glutamatergic (excitatory) projections to the GPi. A decrease in the excitatory input from the STN to the GPi will cause a decrease in the firing rate of the GPi neurons.\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{STN}} \\downarrow \\implies r_{\\mathrm{GPi}} \\downarrow$$\n3.  **Effect on Thalamus**: Foundational fact ($3$) states that the GPi sends GABAergic (inhibitory) outputs to the motor thalamus. The variable $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ represents this inhibitory output. As the firing rate of the GPi ($r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$) decreases, the amount of GABA released onto the thalamus also decreases. Consequently, the net inhibitory output to the thalamus, $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$, is reduced.\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{GPi}} \\downarrow \\implies I_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\downarrow$$\n4.  **Thalamic Activity**: A reduction in inhibition ($I_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\downarrow$) is referred to as \"disinhibition\". The thalamic neurons are now less suppressed and are free to fire at a higher rate.\n5.  **Effect on Motor Cortex**: Foundational fact ($4$) states that the thalamus sends excitatory projections to the motor cortex. The variable $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$ represents this excitatory drive. With the thalamic neurons disinhibited and firing more actively, the excitatory drive from the thalamus to the motor cortex increases.\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{Th}} \\downarrow \\implies \\text{Thalamic Disinhibition} \\implies E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}} \\uparrow$$\n6.  **Clinical Manifestation**: The increased excitatory drive ($E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}} \\uparrow$) to the motor cortex leads to excessive and uncontrolled activation of motor programs. According to foundational fact ($5$), this effect is on the contralateral side. A right-sided STN lesion affects the right GPi, the right thalamus (in this simplified model), and the right motor cortex. Due to the decussation of the corticospinal tracts, this results in excessive, involuntary movements of the left limbs. This clinical picture is precisely that of hemiballismus.\n\nThe complete causal chain is: Decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ $\\rightarrow$ Decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$ $\\rightarrow$ Decrease in $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ $\\rightarrow$ Increase in $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$ $\\rightarrow$ Hyperkinetic movement of contralateral limbs.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ lowers excitatory drive to $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$, thereby decreasing $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ and disinhibiting thalamic relay neurons, which increases $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$ to motor cortex and facilitates contralateral limb movement.**\n- This option perfectly follows the logical chain derived from the foundational facts. It correctly identifies that a decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ leads to a decrease in GPi activity (since STN is excitatory to GPi), which in turn decreases the inhibitory output to the thalamus ($I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$). This disinhibition of the thalamus increases its excitatory output to the cortex ($E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$), causing hyperkinetic contralateral movement (hemiballismus).\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ lowers inhibitory drive to the Globus Pallidus Externus (GPe), increasing GPe firing, which increases inhibition of GPi; this elevates $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ and suppresses thalamocortical excitation, producing hypokinetic symptoms.**\n- This option introduces the Globus Pallidus Externus (GPe), which is not defined in the problem's foundational facts. More critically, it incorrectly states that the STN provides \"inhibitory drive\" to the GPe; the STN-GPe connection is excitatory (glutamatergic). Finally, it concludes with \"hypokinetic symptoms,\" which contradicts the clinical presentation of hemiballismus given in the problem.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ increases $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$ due to loss of GPe inhibition, resulting in increased $I_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ and reduced $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$, thereby causing akinesia rather than hemiballismus.**\n- This option makes a factually incorrect claim at the outset. A decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ should lead to a *decrease* in $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$, because the direct STN-to-GPi projection is excitatory (Fact $2$). The statement that $r_{\\mathrm{GPi}}$ *increases* violates the provided premises. The conclusion of \"akinesia\" (a hypokinetic symptom) is also inconsistent with the problem statement.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. A decrease in $r_{\\mathrm{STN}}$ interrupts the hyperdirect cortical input to STN, directly reducing $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$, which diminishes contralateral movement and cannot explain hemiballismus.**\n- This option invokes the \"hyperdirect pathway,\" which is not part of the foundational facts provided for solving the problem. It also incorrectly suggests a direct reduction of $E_{\\mathrm{Th}\\to \\mathrm{Cx}}$ as a consequence, bypassing the GPi-thalamic link described in the facts. Lastly, it incorrectly concludes that movement is diminished, which is the opposite of hemiballismus.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "A dopaminergic burst from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) transiently elevates dopamine in the dorsal striatum. The principal striatal neurons are medium spiny projection neurons (SPNs). The direct pathway SPNs predominantly express dopamine receptor $1$ (D$1$), which couples to the stimulatory G protein (G$_s$) to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. The indirect pathway SPNs predominantly express dopamine receptor $2$ (D$2$), which couples to the inhibitory G protein (G$_i$) to reduce cAMP and PKA activity.

Also assume the canonical basal ganglia circuit anatomy: the direct pathway projects GABAergic inhibition from striatum to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The indirect pathway projects GABAergic inhibition from striatum to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe); GPe inhibits the subthalamic nucleus (STN); STN provides glutamatergic excitation to GPi/SNr.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem asking to determine the effects of a transient dopamine elevation in the striatum on the excitability of striatal projection neurons ($SPNs$) and the subsequent net effect on basal ganglia output and motor function. The problem is based on the canonical model of the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement is confirmed. The problem provides a clear, self-contained, and scientifically sound description of the basal ganglia circuitry and the modulatory role of dopamine. The stated assumptions about receptor coupling, intracellular signaling, and neuronal excitability are consistent with established neuroscientific principles and standard textbook models. The circuit anatomy is correctly described. Thus, the problem is well-posed and solvable.\n\nWe will now derive the solution by systematically tracing the consequences of a transient dopamine elevation through the direct and indirect pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Effect of Dopamine on Striatal Projection Neuron (SPN) Excitability**\n\nThe problem states that a dopaminergic burst from the substantia nigra pars compacta ($SNc$) transiently elevates dopamine in the dorsal striatum. This dopamine acts on two distinct populations of $SPNs$.\n\n- **Direct Pathway SPNs**: These neurons predominantly express dopamine receptor $1$ ($D1$). The problem specifies that $D1$ receptors couple to the stimulatory G protein ($G_s$) to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate ($cAMP$) and protein kinase A ($PKA$) activity. It is further assumed that higher $cAMP$–$PKA$ activity increases the spike probability, i.e., intrinsic membrane excitability.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is:\nDopamine $\\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ Binds to $D1$ receptors $\\rightarrow$ $G_s$ activation $\\rightarrow$ $cAMP \\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $PKA \\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ Excitability of direct-pathway $SPNs \\uparrow$.\n\n- **Indirect Pathway SPNs**: These neurons predominantly express dopamine receptor $2$ ($D2$). The problem specifies that $D2$ receptors couple to the inhibitory G protein ($G_i$) to reduce $cAMP$ and $PKA$ activity. It is assumed that lower $cAMP$–$PKA$ activity decreases the spike probability, i.e., intrinsic membrane excitability.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is:\nDopamine $\\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ Binds to $D2$ receptors $\\rightarrow$ $G_i$ activation $\\rightarrow$ $cAMP \\downarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $PKA \\downarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ Excitability of indirect-pathway $SPNs \\downarrow$.\n\nSo, a transient dopamine elevation has opposite effects on the two pathways at the level of the striatum: it excites the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway.\n\n**Step 2: Tracing the Signal through the Direct Pathway**\n\nThe direct pathway projects GABAergic inhibition from the striatum to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the internal segment of the globus pallidus ($GPi$) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata ($SNr$).\n1.  Increased excitability of direct-pathway $SPNs$ leads to increased firing in response to any given input.\n2.  This causes an increase in GABAergic inhibitory output from the direct-pathway $SPNs$ onto their targets in the $GPi/SNr$.\n3.  Increased inhibition of $GPi/SNr$ neurons leads to a decrease in their firing rate.\nSummary for direct pathway: Direct $SPN$ activity $\\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ Inhibition of $GPi/SNr \\uparrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $GPi/SNr$ activity $\\downarrow$.\n\n**Step 3: Tracing the Signal through the Indirect Pathway**\n\nThe indirect pathway involves multiple stages:\n1.  Decreased excitability of indirect-pathway $SPNs$ leads to decreased firing.\n2.  These $SPNs$ project GABAergic inhibition to the external segment of the globus pallidus ($GPe$). A decrease in their activity results in less inhibition of the $GPe$. This is a disinhibition.\n3.  Disinhibition of the $GPe$ causes its own firing rate to increase.\n4.  The $GPe$ projects GABAergic inhibition to the subthalamic nucleus ($STN$). Increased $GPe$ activity leads to increased inhibition of the $STN$.\n5.  Increased inhibition of the $STN$ causes its firing rate to decrease.\n6.  The $STN$ provides the primary glutamatergic (excitatory) drive to the $GPi/SNr$. A decrease in $STN$ activity results in less excitation of the $GPi/SNr$.\n7.  Reduced excitatory drive to the $GPi/SNr$ contributes to a decrease in their firing rate.\nSummary for indirect pathway: Indirect $SPN$ activity $\\downarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $GPe$ activity $\\uparrow$ (disinhibition) $\\rightarrow$ $STN$ activity $\\downarrow$ (inhibition) $\\rightarrow$ Excitation of $GPi/SNr \\downarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ $GPi/SNr$ activity $\\downarrow$.\n\n**Step 4: Net Effect on Basal Ganglia Output and Thalamocortical Drive**\n\nBoth the direct pathway and the indirect pathway converge to produce the same net effect on the basal ganglia output nuclei:\n- Direct pathway activation $\\rightarrow$ $GPi/SNr$ activity $\\downarrow$.\n- Indirect pathway suppression $\\rightarrow$ $GPi/SNr$ activity $\\downarrow$.\n\nThe combined effect is a significant decrease in the firing rate of $GPi/SNr$ neurons.\n\nThe $GPi/SNr$ provides tonic GABAergic inhibition to the thalamus.\n1.  A decrease in $GPi/SNr$ activity means less inhibition is exerted on the thalamus. This is a disinhibition of the thalamus.\n2.  Disinhibition of the thalamus causes its firing rate to increase.\n3.  The thalamus provides glutamatergic excitation to the motor cortex. Increased thalamic activity leads to increased excitation of the cortex.\n\nThis increased thalamocortical drive is the neural correlate of movement facilitation (a \"go\" signal).\n\n**Step 5: Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Direct-pathway SPN excitability increases; indirect-pathway SPN excitability decreases; net GPi/SNr inhibitory output to thalamus decreases; thalamocortical excitation increases (movement facilitation).**\n  - Direct-pathway $SPN$ excitability increases: Correct, due to $D1$ receptor stimulation.\n  - Indirect-pathway $SPN$ excitability decreases: Correct, due to $D2$ receptor stimulation.\n  - Net $GPi/SNr$ inhibitory output to thalamus decreases: Correct. This is because the activity of $GPi/SNr$ neurons themselves decreases, as derived from the combined effects of both pathways.\n  - Thalamocortical excitation increases (movement facilitation): Correct. This is the direct consequence of thalamic disinhibition.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Direct-pathway SPN excitability increases; indirect-pathway SPN excitability increases; net GPi/SNr inhibitory output to thalamus increases; thalamocortical excitation decreases (movement suppression).**\n  - Indirect-pathway $SPN$ excitability increases: Incorrect. Dopamine acting on $D2$ receptors is inhibitory to indirect pathway $SPNs$.\n  - Net $GPi/SNr$ inhibitory output to thalamus increases: Incorrect. The output decreases.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Direct-pathway SPN excitability decreases; indirect-pathway SPN excitability increases; net GPi/SNr inhibitory output to thalamus increases; thalamocortical excitation decreases (movement suppression).**\n  - Direct-pathway $SPN$ excitability decreases: Incorrect. Dopamine acting on $D1$ receptors is excitatory to direct pathway $SPNs$.\n  - Indirect-pathway $SPN$ excitability increases: Incorrect.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Direct-pathway SPN excitability increases; indirect-pathway SPN excitability decreases; net GPi/SNr inhibitory output to thalamus increases via STN drive; thalamocortical excitation decreases (movement suppression).**\n  - Net $GPi/SNr$ inhibitory output to thalamus increases via $STN$ drive: Incorrect. The net output *decreases*. Furthermore, the influence via the $STN$ is a *decrease* in excitatory drive to the $GPi/SNr$, which contributes to the *decrease*, not increase, in $GPi/SNr$ output.\n  - Thalamocortical excitation decreases: Incorrect. It increases.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the circuit, Option A provides a complete and accurate description of the consequences of a transient dopamine elevation in the striatum.",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. The model is a standard simplification of basal ganglia circuitry, and the parameters provided are plausible.\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: first, to justify the structure of the given model based on canonical basal ganglia anatomy, and second, to compute the output of the model for a given set of parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of the Model Terms**\n\nThe model for the mean output firing rate of the globus pallidus internus ($I_{GPi}$) is given by:\n$$I_{GPi} = -w_{1} S_{D1} + w_{2} f(S_{D2}) + w_{3} H + b$$\nWe will justify each term based on the provided anatomical facts. The GPi is the primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia, tonically inhibiting downstream targets like the thalamus. Therefore, a decrease in $I_{GPi}$ is disinhibitory (facilitating action), and an increase in $I_{GPi}$ is more inhibitory (suppressing action).\n\n1.  **Direct Pathway Term ($ -w_{1} S_{D1} $):**\n    The direct pathway consists of striatal medium spiny neurons expressing $D1$ receptors ($S_{D1}$) projecting directly to the GPi. The problem states that striatal neurons are GABAergic, meaning they are inhibitory. Therefore, an increase in the firing rate of $D1$ neurons ($S_{D1}$) causes increased inhibition of the GPi neurons. This leads to a *decrease* in the GPi firing rate, $I_{GPi}$. The model represents this relationship with the term $-w_{1} S_{D1}$. Since $w_{1}$ is a positive gain, the negative sign correctly captures the inhibitory nature of this monosynaptic pathway.\n\n2.  **Indirect Pathway Term ($ +w_{2} f(S_{D2}) $):**\n    The indirect pathway is polysynaptic: it involves striatal medium spiny neurons expressing $D2$ receptors ($S_{D2}$) projecting to the globus pallidus externus (GPe), which in turn projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the STN projects to the GPi.\n    -   The $S_{D2} \\to \\text{GPe}$ projection is inhibitory (GABAergic).\n    -   The $\\text{GPe} \\to \\text{STN}$ projection is also inhibitory (GABAergic).\n    -   The $\\text{STN} \\to \\text{GPi}$ projection is excitatory (glutamatergic).\n    An increase in $D2$ neuron activity ($S_{D2}$) inhibits the GPe. Reduced GPe activity disinhibits the STN (i.e., the inhibitory signal from GPe to STN is weakened), causing the STN to become more active. The now more active STN sends a stronger excitatory signal to the GPi.\n    The net effect of the indirect pathway is that an increase in $S_{D2}$ leads to an *increase* in $I_{GPi}$. The model represents this with the term $+w_{2} f(S_{D2})$. Since $w_{2}$ is a positive gain, the positive sign correctly captures the net excitatory effect of this pathway on the GPi.\n\n3.  **Justification of the Rectification Function $f(x) = \\max(0, x - \\theta)$:**\n    The function $f(x)$ is a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) with a threshold $\\theta$. Its inclusion in the indirect pathway term is justified for two reasons. First, neuronal firing rates cannot be negative, and the $\\max(0, \\dots)$ operation ensures this physical constraint. Second, the threshold $\\theta$ models the requirement for the input signal $S_{D2}$ to exceed a certain level of activity before it can effectively propagate through the multi-synapse indirect pathway and produce a significant effect on the GPi. Below this threshold, the pathway is considered inactive or its effect negligible.\n\n4.  **Hyperdirect Pathway Term ($ +w_{3} H $):**\n    The hyperdirect pathway involves a direct cortical projection to the STN, which then projects to the GPi. The problem states that cortical fibers excite the STN, and the STN, being glutamatergic, excites the GPi. Therefore, an increase in the effective cortical drive ($H$) causes an increase in STN activity, which in turn causes a further increase in the GPi firing rate, $I_{GPi}$. The model represents this with the term $+w_{3} H$. Since $w_{3}$ is a positive gain, the positive sign correctly captures the powerful, net excitatory effect of this pathway on the GPi.\n\n5.  **Baseline Term ($ +b $):**\n    GPi neurons are known to be autonomously active, exhibiting a high tonic firing rate even in the absence of structured input from the striatum or STN. The positive constant $b$ represents this intrinsic, baseline firing rate.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of $I_{GPi}$ using the provided parameters:\n-   Gains: $w_{1} = 0.73$, $w_{2} = 0.58$, $w_{3} = 0.41$\n-   Inputs: $S_{D1} = 18\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, $S_{D2} = 14\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, $H = 9\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   Constants: $b = 62\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, $\\theta = 12.5\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the output of the nonlinear function $f(S_{D2})$ for the indirect pathway:\n$$f(S_{D2}) = \\max(0, S_{D2} - \\theta)$$\nSubstituting the given values for $S_{D2}$ and $\\theta$:\n$$f(14) = \\max(0, 14 - 12.5) = \\max(0, 1.5) = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nNext, we substitute this result and all other given parameters into the main equation for $I_{GPi}$:\n$$I_{GPi} = -w_{1} S_{D1} + w_{2} f(S_{D2}) + w_{3} H + b$$\n$$I_{GPi} = -(0.73)(18) + (0.58)(1.5) + (0.41)(9) + 62$$\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n-   Direct pathway contribution: $-(0.73) \\times (18) = -13.14$\n-   Indirect pathway contribution: $(0.58) \\times (1.5) = 0.87$\n-   Hyperdirect pathway contribution: $(0.41) \\times (9) = 3.69$\n-   Baseline: $62$\n\nSumming these terms gives the final value for $I_{GPi}$:\n$$I_{GPi} = -13.14 + 0.87 + 3.69 + 62$$\n$$I_{GPi} = -13.14 + 66.56$$\n$$I_{GPi} = 53.42\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value $53.42$ already has exactly four significant figures.",
