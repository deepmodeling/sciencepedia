To prevent the unsupported side of your pelvis from dropping, your hip abductor muscles on the stance side must generate a powerful stabilizing force. This exercise uses the fundamental principle of static equilibrium to create a simplified model of the pelvis, allowing you to calculate the minimum force the gluteus medius muscle must produce to maintain balance. Mastering this core concept is the first step to understanding many aspects of gait and hip pathology. ",

            "problem": "A subject performs a steady single-leg stance on the right lower limb. Model the pelvis as a rigid body pivoting about the right hip joint center. Let the subject’s total mass be $m$, and let the acceleration due to gravity be $g$. Define the pelvis width $w$ as the horizontal distance between the right and left hip joint centers. Assume that the gravitational line of action of the body’s weight passes vertically downward through the midline between the two hip joint centers, so that its horizontal distance to the right hip joint center is $w/2$. The right gluteus medius and synergist hip abductor muscle group act with a combined effective force $F$ and an effective abductor moment arm $r$ about the right hip joint center. Neglect any torques from passive structures and from other muscles, and note that the hip joint reaction force passes through the joint center and therefore does not create a moment about that point. Assume there is no angular acceleration of the pelvis.\n\nUsing only first principles of static equilibrium for rigid bodies and the definition of a moment as force times the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation, derive the minimum magnitude of the gluteus medius force $F$ required to prevent pelvic tilt (i.e., to keep the pelvis level) in this single-leg stance. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $g$, $w$, and $r$. The force has units of Newtons. Do not substitute numerical values, and do not include units in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the minimum magnitude of the gluteus medius force, denoted by $F$, required to maintain a level pelvis during a single-leg stance. The problem is approached by applying the principles of static equilibrium to a simplified model of the human pelvis.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nAll given information is extracted verbatim:\n- The system is a subject in a steady single-leg stance on the right lower limb.\n- The pelvis is modeled as a rigid body pivoting about the right hip joint center.\n- The subject's total mass is $m$.\n- The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n- The pelvis width, $w$, is the horizontal distance between the right and left hip joint centers.\n- The gravitational line of action of the body's weight passes vertically downward at a horizontal distance of $w/2$ from the right hip joint center.\n- The right hip abductor muscle group acts with a combined effective force $F$ and an effective abductor moment arm $r$ about the right hip joint center.\n- Torques from passive structures and other muscles are neglected.\n- The hip joint reaction force passes through the joint center.\n- There is no angular acceleration of the pelvis.\nThe problem requires deriving an expression for $F$ in terms of $m$, $g$, $w$, and $r$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in Newtonian mechanics (specifically, statics), well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. The model is a standard simplification used in biomechanics and does not violate any physical laws or contain inconsistencies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the condition for static rotational equilibrium. The problem states that the stance is \"steady\" and there is \"no angular acceleration,\" which implies that the net moment (or torque), $\\sum \\tau$, acting on the pelvis about any point must be zero.\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = 0\n$$\nWe choose the pivot point to be the center of the right hip joint, as specified in the problem. This is a convenient choice because the hip joint reaction force passes through this point, meaning its moment arm is zero, and thus it exerts no torque about this axis. This simplifies the analysis.\n\nTwo forces create moments about the right hip joint center:\n1.  The force due to the body's weight, which has a magnitude of $mg$. The problem states that its line of action is at a perpendicular horizontal distance of $w/2$ from the pivot. This force tends to cause the unsupported (left) side of the pelvis to drop, which corresponds to a clockwise (adduction) rotation about the right hip.\n2.  The force from the hip abductor muscles, $F$. The problem provides its effective moment arm as $r$. This force counteracts the weight by pulling the pelvis up on the supported side, creating a counter-clockwise (abduction) rotation.\n\nLet's adopt the standard convention where counter-clockwise (CCW) moments are positive and clockwise (CW) moments are negative.\n\nThe moment produced by the body's weight, $\\tau_g$, is a clockwise moment:\n$$\n\\tau_g = - (mg) \\left( \\frac{w}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe moment produced by the abductor muscle force, $\\tau_F$, is a counter-clockwise moment:\n$$\n\\tau_F = F \\cdot r\n$$\nFor the pelvis to remain level (in rotational equilibrium), the sum of these moments must be zero:\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = \\tau_F + \\tau_g = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the moments into the equilibrium equation:\n$$\n(F \\cdot r) + \\left( - mg \\frac{w}{2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF \\cdot r - \\frac{mgw}{2} = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for the force $F$:\n$$\nF \\cdot r = \\frac{mgw}{2}\n$$\n$$\nF = \\frac{mgw}{2r}\n$$\nThis expression represents the magnitude of the abductor force required to exactly balance the moment created by the body's weight. Any force smaller than this value would result in a net clockwise torque, causing the pelvis to tilt. Therefore, this is the minimum force required to prevent pelvic tilt. The final expression for the force $F$ is a function of the given variables $m$, $g$, $w$, and $r$.",

In such an ideal mechanical system, the tension is conserved across the pulley. This means the magnitude of the force in the quadriceps tendon is equal to the magnitude of the force in the patellar tendon.\n$$ |\\vec{F}_{P}| = |\\vec{F}_{Q}| $$\nWe will denote the magnitude of the quadriceps force as $F_{Q}(\\theta)$.
