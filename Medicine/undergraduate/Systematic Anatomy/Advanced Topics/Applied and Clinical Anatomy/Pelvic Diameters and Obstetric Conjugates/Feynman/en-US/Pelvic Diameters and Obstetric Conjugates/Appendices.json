            "problem": "A nulliparous patient at term undergoes clinical pelvimetry. The diagonal conjugate (DC) measured per vaginam from the sacral promontory to the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis is $DC = 11.5 \\ \\text{cm}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient status: Nulliparous, at term.\n- Clinical measurement: Diagonal conjugate, $DC = 11.5 \\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Definition of $DC$: Measured from the sacral promontory to the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis.\n- Correction factor: Pubic symphysis thickness correction is $1.5 \\ \\text{cm}$ along the axis of the conjugate.\n- Definition of Obstetric Conjugate ($OC$): The anteroposterior diameter that limits descent of the fetal head at the pelvic inlet.\n- Adequacy Threshold 1: Minimum acceptable $OC$ is $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Adequacy Threshold 2: Typical normal $OC$ is $\\geq 10.5 \\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Required tasks:\n    1. Derive the expression for the obstetric conjugate ($OC$) in terms of $DC$ and the correction.\n    2. Compute the value of $OC$ for the patient.\n    3. Compare the computed value to the adequacy thresholds.\n- Final answer requirements: Express the $OC$ in centimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of obstetrics and pelvic anatomy. The definitions of the diagonal conjugate ($DC$) and obstetric conjugate ($OC$) are standard. The relationship between them, typically approximated by subtracting a correction factor, is a well-known clinical rule of thumb. The provided numerical values for $DC$ and the correction are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data to derive the requested expression and compute the numerical value. The objectives are clearly stated, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, clinical, and devoid of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe pelvic inlet has several important anteroposterior diameters. The two relevant to this problem are the obstetric conjugate ($OC$) and the diagonal conjugate ($DC$).\n\n1.  **Geometric Definitions**:\n    - The **obstetric conjugate ($OC$)** is the shortest anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet. It extends from the sacral promontory to the most prominent point on the posterior-superior aspect of the pubic symphysis. This is the critical diameter through which the fetal head must pass. It cannot be measured directly in a clinical examination.\n    - The **diagonal conjugate ($DC$)** is the distance from the sacral promontory to the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis. This diameter can be measured clinically during a vaginal examination.\n\n2.  **Relationship between $OC$ and $DC$**:\n    The $DC$ is longer than the $OC$. The difference arises because the measurement point on the pubic symphysis is different (inferior margin for $DC$ vs. posterior-superior aspect for $OC$). The relationship depends on the height and angle of the pubic symphysis. In clinical practice, this geometric relationship is simplified into a linear subtraction. The problem statement codifies this simplification by defining a \"pubic symphysis thickness correction... along the axis of the conjugate.\"\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Expression**:\n    Let $c$ represent the pubic symphysis thickness correction. Based on the anatomical definitions, the diagonal conjugate spans a longer distance than the obstetric conjugate. The obstetric conjugate can therefore be estimated by subtracting the correction factor from the diagonal conjugate. The problem asks for this derivation based on the provided definitions.\n    \n    The relationship is thus expressed as:\n    $$OC = DC - c$$\n    This is the standard clinical approximation used to estimate the true conjugate from the measurable diagonal conjugate.\n\n4.  **Computation of the Obstetric Conjugate**:\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    - Diagonal conjugate, $DC = 11.5 \\ \\text{cm}$.\n    - Pubic symphysis thickness correction, $c = 1.5 \\ \\text{cm}$.\n\n    Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n    $$OC = 11.5 \\ \\text{cm} - 1.5 \\ \\text{cm}$$\n    $$OC = 10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$$\n\n    The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$ already contains three significant figures (the trailing zero is significant in this context of measurement and calculation).\n\n5.  **Comparison with Adequacy Thresholds**:\n    The computed obstetric conjugate is $OC = 10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$. This value is now compared to the provided clinical thresholds for a term vertex presentation.\n    - **Minimum Adequacy Threshold**: The minimum acceptable $OC$ is given as $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$. The patient's computed $OC$ of $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$ meets this minimum requirement exactly. A pelvis with an $OC$ of $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$ is considered borderline adequate.\n    - **Typical Normal Threshold**: The typical range for a normal (uncontracted) pelvis is given as $OC \\geq 10.5 \\ \\text{cm}$. The patient's computed $OC$ of $10.0 \\ \\text{cm}$ is less than $10.5 \\ \\text{cm}$. Therefore, the patient's pelvic inlet is smaller than typical.\n\n    In summary, the patient's pelvis is classified as borderline, meeting the absolute minimum dimension for a vaginal delivery of a term infant in a vertex presentation, but it is not considered spacious or typical. This finding would warrant careful monitoring of labor progress.",

            "problem": "A mature primigravida presents with a clinically estimated pelvic inlet whose anteroposterior limiting dimension is the obstetric conjugate (conjugata obstetrica), denoted $C_o$, and whose transverse limiting dimension is the maximum transverse diameter, denoted $T$. The fetal head is assumed to present with its biparietal diameter (the largest transverse cranial diameter) aligned to the inlet transverse axis, and the presenting cranial diameter aligned to the inlet anteroposterior axis. Engagement of the fetal head at the inlet occurs if and only if the presenting cranial diameter does not exceed $C_o$ and the biparietal diameter does not exceed $T$.\n\nUse the following widely accepted anatomical values for a term singleton fetus:\n- Biparietal diameter $d_{\\mathrm{BPD}} = 9.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Presenting cranial diameter with good flexion (suboccipitobregmatic) $d_{\\mathrm{SOB}} = 9.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Presenting cranial diameter with partial deflexion (occipitofrontal) $d_{\\mathrm{OF}} = 11.0\\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Presenting cranial diameter with marked deflexion/brow (mentovertical) $d_{\\mathrm{MV}} = 13.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\n\nGiven $C_o = 10.5\\ \\text{cm}$ and $T = 13\\ \\text{cm}$, determine, based on first principles of spatial fit at the inlet, whether engagement is permitted for flexion and for deflexion, and whether the mentovertical presentation is incompatible with engagement.\n\nTo produce a single quantitative output, define indicator variables:\n- $I_{\\mathrm{flexion}} = 1$ if flexion permits engagement, otherwise $0$.\n- $I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}} = 1$ if deflexion permits engagement, otherwise $0$.\n- $I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}} = 1$ if mentovertical presentation is incompatible with engagement, otherwise $0$.\n\nCompute the code $S = I_{\\mathrm{flexion}} + 2 I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}} + 4 I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of whether a fetal head can engage in the maternal pelvic inlet for three different states of flexion/deflexion. This determination is based on a simple spatial fit model where the fetal cranial diameters must be less than or equal to the corresponding pelvic diameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters and conditions.\nThe pelvic inlet dimensions are given as:\nAnteroposterior (obstetric conjugate): $C_o = 10.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\nTransverse: $T = 13\\ \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe fetal head diameters are given as:\nBiparietal diameter (transverse): $d_{\\mathrm{BPD}} = 9.5\\ \\text{cm}$. This diameter is constant regardless of flexion.\nPresenting cranial diameters (anteroposterior), which vary with flexion:\n- Suboccipitobregmatic (good flexion): $d_{\\mathrm{SOB}} = 9.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Occipitofrontal (partial deflexion): $d_{\\mathrm{OF}} = 11.0\\ \\text{cm}$.\n- Mentovertical (marked deflexion): $d_{\\mathrm{MV}} = 13.5\\ \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe conditions for engagement are stated as:\n1. The presenting cranial diameter must not exceed $C_o$.\n2. The biparietal diameter must not exceed $T$.\n\nLet us first evaluate the transverse condition, $d_{\\mathrm{BPD}} \\le T$, which must be met for any presentation.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$9.5 \\le 13$$\nThis statement is true. The transverse diameter of the pelvis is adequate. Therefore, engagement is determined solely by the anteroposterior condition, where the specific presenting diameter must be less than or equal to $C_o$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each case to determine the values of the indicator variables $I_{\\mathrm{flexion}}$, $I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}}$, and $I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}}$.\n\nCase 1: Good flexion\nThe presenting diameter is $d_{\\mathrm{SOB}} = 9.5\\ \\text{cm}$. The condition for engagement is $d_{\\mathrm{SOB}} \\le C_o$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$9.5 \\le 10.5$$\nThis inequality is true. Engagement is permitted with good flexion.\nThe indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{flexion}}$ is $1$ if engagement is permitted. Therefore, $I_{\\mathrm{flexion}} = 1$.\n\nCase 2: Partial deflexion\nThe presenting diameter is $d_{\\mathrm{OF}} = 11.0\\ \\text{cm}$. The condition for engagement is $d_{\\mathrm{OF}} \\le C_o$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$11.0 \\le 10.5$$\nThis inequality is false. Engagement is not permitted with partial deflexion.\nThe indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}}$ is $0$ if engagement is not permitted. Therefore, $I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}} = 0$.\n\nCase 3: Marked deflexion (mentovertical presentation)\nThe indicator variable of interest is $I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}}$, which is $1$ if the presentation is *incompatible* with engagement. Incompatibility means that the conditions for engagement are not met.\nThe presenting diameter is $d_{\\mathrm{MV}} = 13.5\\ \\text{cm}$. The condition for engagement is $d_{\\mathrm{MV}} \\le C_o$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$13.5 \\le 10.5$$\nThis inequality is false. Engagement is not permitted.\nSince engagement is not permitted, the mentovertical presentation is indeed incompatible with engagement in this pelvis.\nTherefore, $I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the code $S$ based on the formula provided:\n$$S = I_{\\mathrm{flexion}} + 2 I_{\\mathrm{deflexion}} + 4 I_{\\mathrm{MV,inc}}$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined for the indicator variables:\n$$S = 1 + 2(0) + 4(1)$$\n$$S = 1 + 0 + 4$$\n$$S = 5$$\nThe final result is a dimensionless integer.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question based on realistic anatomical and physiological parameters, which can be solved using first principles of geometry.\n\nThe objective is to compute the numerical clearance margin, $C_m$, at the midpelvis.
