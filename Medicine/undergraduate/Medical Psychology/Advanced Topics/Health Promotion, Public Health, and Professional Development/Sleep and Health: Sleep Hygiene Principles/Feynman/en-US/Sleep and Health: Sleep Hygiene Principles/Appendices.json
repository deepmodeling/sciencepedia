In sleep health, one of the most important metrics for evaluating the quality of your nightly rest is Sleep Efficiency ($SE$).

The diary yields a total time in bed $TIB = 7.5$ hours and a total sleep time $TST = 6.4$ hours. In behavioral sleep medicine, sleep efficiency is defined conceptually as the proportion of time in bed spent asleep, and sleep restriction is typically considered when sleep efficiency is below a commonly used clinical threshold. Using foundational definitions of $TIB$ and $TST$, compute the sleep efficiency from these data and justify whether a sleep restriction intervention would be indicated if the operational threshold is $0.85$ for initiating restriction. Express the sleep efficiency as a decimal number (do not use a percentage sign) and round to $4$ significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Total time in bed: $TIB = 7.5$ hours\n- Total sleep time: $TST = 6.4$ hours\n- Conceptual definition of sleep efficiency: The proportion of time in bed spent asleep.\n- Operational threshold for initiating sleep restriction: $0.85$\n- Required output format for sleep efficiency: Decimal number rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the field of behavioral sleep medicine, a sub-discipline of medical psychology. The concepts of Total Time in Bed ($TIB$), Total Sleep Time ($TST$), and Sleep Efficiency ($SE$) are standard, well-defined metrics used in both clinical practice and research (e.g., in studies using polysomnography, actigraphy, or sleep diaries). The formula for sleep efficiency as the ratio of $TST$ to $TIB$ is the standard operational definition. Sleep restriction therapy is a core component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), and its initiation is commonly guided by sleep efficiency, with $85\\%$ ($0.85$) being a frequently used clinical threshold. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($TIB$, $TST$, threshold) and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. The values provided are realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of sleep efficiency from provided sleep diary data and a subsequent clinical judgment based on a given threshold.\n\nFirst, we formalize the definition of sleep efficiency ($SE$). As stated, it is the proportion of time in bed ($TIB$) that is spent asleep ($TST$). This translates to the following mathematical relationship:\n$$\nSE = \\frac{TST}{TIB}\n$$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Total Time in Bed, $TIB = 7.5$ hours\n- Total Sleep Time, $TST = 6.4$ hours\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for sleep efficiency yields:\n$$\nSE = \\frac{6.4}{7.5}\n$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the exact decimal value:\n$$\nSE = 0.85333...\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies that this value must be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $5$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\n$$\nSE \\approx 0.8533\n$$\n\nNext, we must justify whether a sleep restriction intervention is indicated. This decision is based on comparing the calculated sleep efficiency to the provided operational threshold. The threshold for initiating sleep restriction is given as $0.85$. The intervention is typically considered when sleep efficiency falls *below* this threshold.\n\nLet the clinical threshold be $SE_{threshold} = 0.85$. The condition for considering the intervention is $SE < SE_{threshold}$.\n\nWe compare our calculated value to this threshold:\n$$\n0.8533 > 0.85\n$$\n\nSince the calculated sleep efficiency ($SE \\approx 0.8533$) is not below the clinical threshold of $0.85$, a sleep restriction intervention is not indicated based on this specific criterion and data.\n\nThe primary assumption made in this analysis is that the sleep diary data for $TIB$ and $TST$ are accurate and representative of the individual's typical sleep patterns over a meaningful period. In clinical practice, this decision would be supplemented by considering other factors such as the variability of sleep, the patient's subjective experience of sleep quality, and their level of daytime functioning. However, based solely on the provided data and the strict application of the given rule, the conclusion is unambiguous.",

            "introduction": "Good sleep hygiene involves not just what you do at night, but also your behaviors during the day. This practice explores the impact of one of the most common daily habits: caffeine consumption. By applying a basic model of pharmacokinetics, you will calculate how a morning cup of coffee can still be affecting your system at bedtime, providing a concrete, scientific basis for the classic advice to avoid stimulants in the afternoon and evening .",

            "problem": "A healthy undergraduate participant consumes a single caffeine dose of $200$ milligrams at 12:00. Assume first-order elimination kinetics for caffeine, where the concentration $C(t)$ of caffeine in plasma decreases proportionally to its current value over time, and use the empirical definition of half-life that after time $t_{1/2}$ the concentration is halved. Let the caffeine half-life be $t_{1/2} = 5$ hours for this individual. \n\nStarting from the differential equation for first-order elimination and the definition of half-life, derive an expression for the fraction of the original dose remaining after elapsed time $t$, and then calculate the fraction of the dose remaining at $t = 8$ hours after ingestion (i.e., at 20:00). \n\nFinally, based on the computed fraction at $t = 8$ hours, briefly reason whether consuming $200$ milligrams of caffeine at 12:00 aligns with sleep hygiene principles for a planned bedtime at 22:00 on the same day (do not include this reasoning in the final numeric answer). Express the requested fraction as a decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures. The final answer should contain only the fraction.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of first-order pharmacokinetics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe elimination of caffeine is described by first-order kinetics. This means the rate of change of the caffeine concentration, $C(t)$, is directly proportional to the concentration itself. This relationship is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive elimination rate constant. The negative sign indicates that the concentration decreases over time.\n\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating. Let the initial concentration at time $t=0$ be $C(0) = C_0$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C'} = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(C')]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides to solve for the ratio $C(t)/C_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe fraction of the original dose remaining at time $t$, denoted as $f(t)$, is equivalent to the ratio of the concentrations $C(t)/C_0$, assuming the substance is distributed in a single compartment (the plasma).\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the fraction remaining. The next step is to relate the rate constant $k$ to the given half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. At $t = t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = C_0/2$. Substituting this into our solution:\n$$\n\\frac{C_0/2}{C_0} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for the rate constant $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $k$ back into the equation for the fraction $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf(t) = 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the fraction of the original dose remaining after an elapsed time $t$, in terms of the half-life $t_{1/2}$.\n\nThe problem provides a half-life of $t_{1/2} = 5$ hours. We need to calculate the fraction remaining at $t = 8$ hours (from 12:00 to 20:00).\n$$\nf(8) = 2^{-8/5} = 2^{-1.6}\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures.\n$$\nf(8) = \\frac{1}{2^{1.6}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3.03143313} \\approx 0.3298769...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nf(8) \\approx 0.3299\n$$\nThis means that after $8$ hours, approximately $32.99\\%$ of the initial caffeine dose remains in the system.\n\nFinally, we are asked to reason whether this consumption pattern aligns with sleep hygiene principles for a planned bedtime at 22:00. The caffeine was ingested at 12:00. The elapsed time from ingestion to the planned bedtime of 22:00 is $t_{bed} = 10$ hours. The fraction of the dose remaining at bedtime would be:\n$$\nf(10) = 2^{-10/5} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nThe initial dose was $200$ milligrams. The amount of caffeine remaining in the system at bedtime is:\n$$\n\\text{Amount at bedtime} = 200 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 0.25 = 50 \\, \\text{mg}\n$$\nA dose of $50$ mg of caffeine is pharmacologically active and known to be sufficient to interfere with sleep. It can increase sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep), reduce total sleep time, and alter sleep architecture by decreasing the proportion of deep, restorative sleep. Given that a significant, sleep-disrupting amount of caffeine remains in the body at the planned bedtime, consuming $200$ mg of caffeine at 12:00 is not consistent with good sleep hygiene principles for an individual with a $5$-hour half-life and a 22:00 bedtime. The calculation at $t=8$ hours (20:00), showing that nearly $33\\%$ of the dose (about $66$ mg) is still present just two hours before bedtime, further supports this conclusion.",
