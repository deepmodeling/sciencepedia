            "problem": "A medical psychology study investigates how Socioeconomic Status (SES) relates to health disparities across ethnic groups by constructing a composite SES index from three indicators that are widely used and empirically validated: years of formal education, the natural logarithm of annual household income in United States Dollars (USD), and occupational prestige scored by the International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI). The composite SES for each participant is defined as the average of the standardized indicators, given by\n$$\nSES \\;=\\; \\frac{z(\\text{education}) \\;+\\; z(\\ln(\\text{income})) \\;+\\; z(\\text{occupation})}{3}.\n$$\nAcross a sample of $N$ adult participants, the study-wide descriptive statistics are as follows: mean years of education $\\mu_{\\text{edu}}=14$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{edu}}=2$; mean natural logarithm of income $\\mu_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}=11$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}=0.5$; mean ISEI occupational prestige $\\mu_{\\text{occ}}=50$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{occ}}=15$.

Round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required for Cronbach’s $\\alpha$.",
            "solution": "The problem presents a multi-part task: first, to calculate the composite Socioeconomic Status (SES) index for a specific individual, and second, to derive and compute Cronbach’s alpha for the SES index as a whole. The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary data for the required calculations.\n\nFirst, we address the calculation of the composite SES score for Participant A. The composite SES index is the average of three standardized indicators. A standardized score, or z-score, is calculated using the formula $z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $x$ is the raw score, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nLet the three indicators be education (edu), natural logarithm of income ($\\ln(\\text{inc})$), and occupational prestige (occ).\nThe given statistics for the sample are:\n$\\mu_{\\text{edu}}=14$, $\\sigma_{\\text{edu}}=2$\n$\\mu_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}=11$, $\\sigma_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}=0.5$\n$\\mu_{\\text{occ}}=50$, $\\sigma_{\\text{occ}}=15$\n\nParticipant A's raw scores are:\nEducation: $x_{\\text{edu}} = 16$ years\nLog-income: $x_{\\ln(\\text{inc})} = 11.4$\nOccupation: $x_{\\text{occ}} = 62$\n\nWe calculate the z-score for each of Participant A's indicators:\n$z(\\text{education}) = \\frac{x_{\\text{edu}} - \\mu_{\\text{edu}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{edu}}} = \\frac{16 - 14}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.0$\n$z(\\ln(\\text{income})) = \\frac{x_{\\ln(\\text{inc})} - \\mu_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}}{\\sigma_{\\ln(\\text{inc})}} = \\frac{11.4 - 11}{0.5} = \\frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8$\n$z(\\text{occupation}) = \\frac{x_{\\text{occ}} - \\mu_{\\text{occ}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{occ}}} = \\frac{62 - 50}{15} = \\frac{12}{15} = 0.8$\n\nThe composite SES for Participant A is the average of these standardized scores:\n$SES_A = \\frac{z(\\text{education}) + z(\\ln(\\text{income})) + z(\\text{occupation})}{3} = \\frac{1.0 + 0.8 + 0.8}{3} = \\frac{2.6}{3} \\approx 0.867$\n\nNext, we derive and calculate Cronbach’s alpha ($\\alpha$) for the three-item SES index. Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency reliability for a psychometric test or a composite index. It is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_{Y_i}^2}{\\sigma_X^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of items (indicators), $\\sigma_{Y_i}^2$ is the variance of the $i$-th item, and $\\sigma_X^2$ is the variance of the total score, which is the sum of the items.\n\nIn this problem, the \"items\" are the three standardized indicators: $Y_1 = z(\\text{education})$, $Y_2 = z(\\ln(\\text{income}))$, and $Y_3 = z(\\text{occupation})$. Thus, $k=3$.\nBy definition, a standardized variable has a variance of $1$. Therefore, for each item $Y_i$:\n$\\sigma_{Y_i}^2 = \\text{Var}(Y_i) = 1$.\nThe sum of the item variances is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_{Y_i}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 1 = 1+1+1 = 3 $$\n\nThe total score $X$ is the sum of the standardized items: $X = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3$. The variance of this sum, $\\sigma_X^2$, is derived from the core definition of the variance of a sum of random variables:\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k Y_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(Y_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_j) $$\nFor $k=3$, this expands to:\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_{Y_1}^2 + \\sigma_{Y_2}^2 + \\sigma_{Y_3}^2 + 2\\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) + 2\\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_3) + 2\\text{Cov}(Y_2, Y_3) $$\nThe covariance between two standardized variables is equal to their correlation coefficient, $\\rho$:\n$\\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_j) = \\rho_{Y_i, Y_j} \\sigma_{Y_i} \\sigma_{Y_j} = \\rho_{ij} (1)(1) = \\rho_{ij}$.\n\nThe given inter-item correlations are:\n$\\rho_{12} = \\rho_{\\text{edu},\\ln(\\text{inc})} = 0.55$\n$\\rho_{13} = \\rho_{\\text{edu},\\text{occ}} = 0.50$\n$\\rho_{23} = \\rho_{\\ln(\\text{inc}),\\text{occ}} = 0.60$\n\nSubstituting the variances and covariances into the formula for $\\sigma_X^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = (1 + 1 + 1) + 2(\\rho_{12} + \\rho_{13} + \\rho_{23}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_X^2 = 3 + 2(0.55 + 0.50 + 0.60) = 3 + 2(1.65) = 3 + 3.3 = 6.3 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate Cronbach's alpha:\n$k = 3$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sigma_{Y_i}^2 = 3$\n$\\sigma_X^2 = 6.3$\n\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{3-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3}{6.3} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{30}{63} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{10}{21} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{21 - 10}{21} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{11}{21} \\right) = \\frac{33}{42} = \\frac{11}{14} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{11}{14} \\approx 0.785714... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\alpha = 0.7857$.\n\nIn the context of this study, Cronbach’s $\\alpha$ assesses the internal consistency of the three-item SES index. It quantifies the extent to which years of education, log-income, and occupational prestige are intercorrelated, providing a measure of how well these three distinct indicators collectively represent a single, unidimensional latent construct of Socioeconomic Status. A higher $\\alpha$ value, such as the one calculated, suggests that the items are measuring the same underlying construct reliably, thus supporting their aggregation into a composite index. A conventional threshold for acceptable reliability is $\\alpha \\ge 0.7$, which this index meets.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of Cronbach's alpha.",

On the additive scale of the outcome $Y$, this is the arithmetic difference between the two slopes calculated above.\nDifference in slopes $= (\\text{Slope for } Eth=1) - (\\text{Slope for } Eth=0)$\n$$\n\\text{Difference in slopes} = (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) - (\\beta_1) = \\beta_3\n$$\nTherefore, $\\beta_3$ represents the difference in the expected change in $Y$ per $1$-unit increase in $SES$ when comparing the minoritized group ($Eth=1$) to the majority group ($Eth=0$).\n\n**A.

The expected change in $Y$ per $1$-unit increase in $SES$ is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3$ for $Eth=1$ and $\\beta_1$ for $Eth=0$. The ratio is $(\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) / \\beta_1$. This is not equal to $\\exp(\\beta_3)$. Comparisons in a linear model are differences, not ratios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\beta_3$ captures the confounding between $SES$ and $Eth$ and does not change the slope of $SES$ on $Y$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, confounding and effect modification are distinct statistical concepts. $\\beta_3$ measures effect modification (interaction). Confounding would be addressed by the inclusion of the main effects $\\beta_1\\,SES$ and $\\beta_2\\,Eth$. Second, the very purpose of the interaction term $\\beta_3(SES \\times Eth)$ is to allow the slope of $SES$ on $Y$ to change depending on the value of $Eth$. The statement that it \"does not change the slope\" is a direct contradiction of the definition of an interaction term.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\beta_3$ represents the difference in the variance of $\\epsilon$ across ethnic groups.**\nThe coefficient $\\beta_3$ is a parameter in the model for the conditional **mean** of $Y$. The variance of the error term, $\\epsilon$, relates to the conditional **variance** of $Y$. A difference in the variance of $\\epsilon$ across groups is known as heteroscedasticity. While this is an important feature of the data to check, it is not what $\\beta_3$ measures.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
