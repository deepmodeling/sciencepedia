To make these scores comparable across different studies, populations, or even different domains within the same instrument, we often transform them onto a standardized scale, such as from $0$ to $100$.

            "problem": "A medical psychology research team is analyzing health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a cohort using a validated multi-domain instrument. One domain is scored by averaging $6$ items, each rated on a Likert scale from $1$ (worst) to $5$ (best), producing a raw domain score $x \\in [1,5]$ that is treated as interval-level. To compare across studies and domains, the institution expresses scores on a $0$–$100$ metric via a linear rescaling that preserves equal intervals and maps the worst and best anchors such that the domain score $x=1$ corresponds to $0$ on the $0$–$100$ metric and $x=5$ corresponds to $100$ on the $0$–$100$ metric.\n\nA patient’s raw domain score average is $x=3.8$. Using only the principles of interval scaling and linear (affine) transformation with the stated anchor constraints, derive the transformation function $T(x)$ from $[1,5]$ to $[0,100]$, then compute the transformed score for $x=3.8$ exactly. Finally, interpret the clinical meaningfulness of the transformed value under the following framework: in this population, scores $\\ge 70$ on the $0$–$100$ metric are considered “high functioning,” scores $50$ are “low functioning,” and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is $5$ points on the $0$–$100$ scale. Assume the patient’s previous transformed score was $65$ and discuss whether the change is clinically meaningful.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer as the transformed score on the $0$–$100$ scale.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of psychometrics and linear scale transformation, well-posed with sufficient information to derive a unique solution, and objective in its language. The premises are consistent and the task is to apply standard mathematical methods to a clearly defined scenario.\n\nThe task is to derive a linear transformation function, apply it to a given data point, and interpret the result within a specified clinical framework.\n\nLet the raw domain score be denoted by the variable $x$, which exists in the interval $[1, 5]$. Let the transformed score on the $0$–$100$ metric be denoted by $T(x)$, which exists in the interval $[0, 100]$. The transformation is stated to be linear, which means it can be represented by an affine function of the form:\n$$T(x) = mx + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe problem provides two anchor points that define this linear relationship:\n1. A raw score of $x=1$ corresponds to a transformed score of $T(1)=0$.\n2. A raw score of $x=5$ corresponds to a transformed score of $T(5)=100$.\n\nThese two points, $(1, 0)$ and $(5, 100)$, allow us to determine the parameters $m$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope $m$ of the line connecting these two points:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{T(5) - T(1)}{5 - 1} = \\frac{100 - 0}{5 - 1} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25$$\n\nNow that we have the slope, the function is $T(x) = 25x + b$. We can use one of the anchor points to solve for the intercept $b$. Using the point $(1, 0)$:\n$$T(1) = 25(1) + b$$\n$$0 = 25 + b$$\n$$b = -25$$\n\nThus, the complete linear transformation function is:\n$$T(x) = 25x - 25$$\nThis can be written in a factored form, which is common for such transformations:\n$$T(x) = 25(x - 1)$$\nThis form clearly shows that the score is determined by the distance of the raw score $x$ from the minimum possible raw score ($1$), scaled by a factor of $25$. We can verify this function using the second anchor point, $(5, 100)$:\n$$T(5) = 25(5 - 1) = 25(4) = 100$$\nThe function is correct.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the transformed score for a patient with a raw average domain score of $x = 3.8$. We substitute this value into our derived function:\n$$T(3.8) = 25(3.8 - 1)$$\n$$T(3.8) = 25(2.8)$$\nTo compute this product exactly:\n$$T(3.8) = 25 \\times \\frac{28}{10} = \\frac{25 \\times 28}{10} = \\frac{5 \\times 28}{2} = 5 \\times 14 = 70$$\nThe patient's transformed score is exactly $70$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret the clinical meaningfulness of this result.\nThe interpretation framework provides three pieces of information:\n- Scores $\\ge 70$ are considered “high functioning.”\n- Scores $ 50$ are considered “low functioning.”\n- The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is $5$ points on the $0$–$100$ scale.\n\nThe patient’s current score is $T(3.8) = 70$. According to the given framework, a score of $70$ falls into the “high functioning” category, as it satisfies the condition $T(x) \\ge 70$.\n\nThe patient’s previous transformed score was $65$. The change in score is the difference between the current score and the previous score:\n$$\\Delta T = \\text{Current Score} - \\text{Previous Score} = 70 - 65 = 5$$\nThe patient's score has improved by $5$ points. The problem states that the MCID is $5$ points. The MCID is the smallest change in a treatment outcome that a patient would identify as important. Since the patient's improvement of $5$ points is equal to the MCID, the change is considered clinically meaningful. This means the improvement is not just a numerical fluctuation but represents a tangible enhancement in the patient's quality of life for this domain. The final request is to provide the numerical value of the transformed score for $x=3.8$.",

            "introduction": "Quality of Life is inherently multidimensional, encompassing physical, emotional, and social well-being. While analyzing individual domain scores is crucial, it is often necessary to synthesize them into a single composite index for overall assessment or health policy decisions. This practice  explores how a weighted summary score can be derived from foundational measurement principles, demonstrating that the familiar weighted average is not an arbitrary choice but a logical consequence of desirable properties like fairness and consistency.",

            "problem": "A health outcomes researcher is constructing a composite index to summarize a patient's Quality of Life (QoL) across multiple domains for clinical decision-making in medical psychology. The instrument reports scores on three domains: physical functioning, emotional well-being, and social participation, each measured on a common anchored interval scale from $0$ (worst) to $100$ (best). Denote the domain score vector by $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the importance weight vector by $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)$, where each $w_i \\ge 0$ and the weights are normalized such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1$. The researcher requires that the overall composite score $S(\\mathbf{x})$ satisfies the following foundational principles drawn from measurement theory and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT):\n\n- Anchored scale consistency: $S(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$ and for any constant $c \\in [0,100]$, if $\\mathbf{x} = (c,c,c)$ then $S(\\mathbf{x}) = c$.\n- Monotonicity: If $x_i$ increases while all other $x_j$ for $j \\neq i$ are held fixed, then $S(\\mathbf{x})$ strictly increases.\n- Additive separability under preferential independence: The contribution of each domain to $S(\\mathbf{x})$ does not depend on the levels of the other domains except through their own scores, and the trade-offs between domains are constant across the scale.\n- Linearity in scale units: Differences of equal magnitude on the $0$–$100$ domain scale produce equal increments in the overall score, all else equal.\n\nStarting from these principles and without invoking any pre-specified aggregation formula, derive the functional form for $S(\\mathbf{x})$ that is consistent with all four principles. Then, the researcher assigns weights $\\mathbf{w} = (0.3, 0.2, 0.5)$ and observes domain scores $\\mathbf{x} = (60, 75, 50)$. Compute the patient's overall QoL composite score. Express your answer as a single real number on the $0$–$100$ scale. Do not use a percentage sign. No rounding instruction applies because an exact value can be obtained.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a functional form for a composite Quality of Life (QoL) score, $S(\\mathbf{x})$, based on four foundational principles, and then to compute the score for a specific case. The score vector is $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the weight vector is $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)$.\n\nFirst, we will translate the given principles into mathematical constraints on the function $S(x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\n\n1.  **Additive separability under preferential independence**: This principle states that the contribution of each domain to the overall score $S(\\mathbf{x})$ is independent of the levels of the other domains. In the context of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), this implies that the function $S(\\mathbf{x})$ can be represented in an additive form. A general additive representation is:\n    $$S(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + f_3(x_3) + K$$\n    where $f_i$ are functions of the individual domain scores and $K$ is a constant.\n\n2.  **Linearity in scale units**: This principle states that equal differences on a domain scale lead to equal increments in the overall score, all else being equal. Let's consider the effect of changing $x_i$ by an amount $\\Delta x$. The change in the total score is:\n    $$\\Delta S = S(..., x_i + \\Delta x, ...) - S(..., x_i, ...)$$\n    Using the additive form from the first principle, this becomes:\n    $$\\Delta S = (f_i(x_i + \\Delta x) + \\sum_{j \\neq i} f_j(x_j) + K) - (\\sum_{j=1}^3 f_j(x_j) + K) = f_i(x_i + \\Delta x) - f_i(x_i)$$\n    The linearity principle demands that this change, $\\Delta S$, depends only on the magnitude of the difference $\\Delta x$, and not on the initial level of $x_i$ (or any other $x_j$). This is a functional requirement on $f_i(x_i)$. The condition $f_i(x_i + \\Delta x) - f_i(x_i) = g_i(\\Delta x)$ for some function $g_i$ implies that $f_i$ must be a linear function of $x_i$. Therefore, we can write:\n    $$f_i(x_i) = w_i x_i + c_i$$\n    where $w_i$ and $c_i$ are constants. The coefficient $w_i$ represents the scaling factor or importance of the $i$-th domain. Substituting this back into the expression for $S(\\mathbf{x})$:\n    $$S(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (w_i x_i + c_i) + K = \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i x_i + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^3 c_i + K\\right)$$\n    Let $C = \\sum_{i=1}^3 c_i + K$ be a new constant. The functional form is now reduced to:\n    $$S(x_1, x_2, x_3) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + C$$\n\n3.  **Anchored scale consistency**: This principle provides two conditions to determine the remaining constants.\n    -   First, $S(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$. For $\\mathbf{x} = (0, 0, 0)$, we have:\n        $$S(0, 0, 0) = w_1(0) + w_2(0) + w_3(0) + C = C$$\n        Since $S(0, 0, 0) = 0$, it follows that $C=0$. The function simplifies to:\n        $$S(x_1, x_2, x_3) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3$$\n    -   Second, for any constant $c \\in [0, 100]$, if $\\mathbf{x} = (c, c, c)$, then $S(\\mathbf{x}) = c$. Applying this:\n        $$S(c, c, c) = w_1 c + w_2 c + w_3 c = c(w_1 + w_2 + w_3)$$\n        We are given that $S(c, c, c) = c$. So, $c(w_1 + w_2 + w_3) = c$. For this to hold for any non-zero $c$, we must have:\n        $$w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1$$\n    This confirms that the coefficients $w_i$ in our derived formula are the normalized importance weights mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Monotonicity**: This principle requires that $S(\\mathbf{x})$ strictly increases if any single $x_i$ increases. To check this, we compute the partial derivative of $S(\\mathbf{x})$ with respect to $x_i$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^3 w_j x_j \\right) = w_i$$\n    For $S(\\mathbf{x})$ to be strictly increasing in $x_i$, we must have $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x_i} > 0$, which implies $w_i > 0$ for all $i=1, 2, 3$. The problem states $w_i \\ge 0$, but the given weights $\\mathbf{w} = (0.3, 0.2, 0.5)$ all satisfy the stricter condition $w_i > 0$.\n\nCombining all principles, the only functional form for the composite score $S(\\mathbf{x})$ that is consistent with the given axioms is the weighted arithmetic mean:\n$$S(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i x_i = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3$$\n\nNow, we can compute the patient's overall QoL composite score using the given weights and domain scores.\nThe weights are $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3) = (0.3, 0.2, 0.5)$.\nThe domain scores are $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3) = (60, 75, 50)$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$S(60, 75, 50) = (0.3)(60) + (0.2)(75) + (0.5)(50)$$\nCalculating each term:\n$$(0.3)(60) = 18$$\n$$(0.2)(75) = 15$$\n$$(0.5)(50) = 25$$\nSumming the terms gives the final score:\n$$S = 18 + 15 + 25 = 58$$\nThe patient's overall QoL composite score is $58$.",

The respondent is indifferent between two scenarios, which implies that the total health value, or QALY, of each scenario is equal. Let us denote the two options as Option A and Option B.\n\nOption A: Living for a duration $T$ in a constant health state $H$.\nOption B: Living for a shorter duration $t^{\\ast}$ in full health, followed by immediate death.\n\nThe QALY is defined as the integral of the instantaneous utility function, $u(t)$, over the lifespan, $\\tau$:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} u(t)\\,dt$$\n\nWe calculate the QALY for each option based on the givens.\n\nFor Option A, the lifespan is $\\tau = T$, and the utility is constant, $u(t) = u(H)$, for the entire duration. Therefore, the QALY for Option A, denoted $Q_A$, is:\n$$Q_A = \\int_{0}^{T} u(H)\\,dt$$\nSince $u(H)$ is a constant with respect to time $t$, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$Q_A = u(H) \\int_{0}^{T} 1\\,dt = u(H) [t]_{0}^{T} = u(H) (T - 0) = u(H)T$$\n\nFor Option B, the lifespan is $\\tau = t^{\\ast}$, and the utility is that of full health, which is anchored at $u(t) = 1$, for the entire duration.
