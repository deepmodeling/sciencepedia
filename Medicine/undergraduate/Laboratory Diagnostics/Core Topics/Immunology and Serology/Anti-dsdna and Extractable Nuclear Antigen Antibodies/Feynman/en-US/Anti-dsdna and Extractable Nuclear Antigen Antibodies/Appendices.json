However, for a clinician interpreting a patient's result, the more pressing questions are \"Given a positive result, what is the probability my patient has the disease?\" and \"Given a negative result, how sure can I be they don't?\" This exercise  will guide you through calculating these crucial metrics—the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)—for an anti-dsDNA antibody test.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid application of Bayesian probability to the evaluation of a medical diagnostic test. All provided data—prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity—are well-defined, consistent, and scientifically realistic for the given clinical context. The problem is well-posed and allows for a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the notation for the events involved.\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have SLE.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the anti-dsDNA ELISA test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the anti-dsDNA ELISA test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities, which are extracted verbatim:\n1.  The prevalence of SLE: $P(D) = 0.10$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the ELISA: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.80$.\n3.  The specificity of the ELISA: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom these given values, we can deduce other necessary probabilities using the complement rule.\nThe probability of a patient not having SLE is:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\nThe probability of a false negative (a negative test in a patient with SLE) is the complement of sensitivity:\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\nThe probability of a false positive (a positive test in a patient without SLE) is the complement of specificity:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe task is to derive the expressions for the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and then calculate their numerical values.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient has the disease given that they tested positive, denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem for this derivation:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive result can occur: a true positive and a false positive.\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV gives the complete expression in terms of the initial parameters:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis expression relates PPV to sensitivity ($P(T^+ | D)$), prevalence ($P(D)$), and specificity (via its complement, $P(T^+ | D^c)$).\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.80)(0.10)}{(0.80)(0.10) + (0.10)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.09} = \\frac{0.08}{0.17}$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.470588... \\approx 0.4706$$\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given that they tested negative, denoted as $P(D^c | T^-)$. Again, we apply Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability, we expand it by considering the case of a true negative and a false negative:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D)$$\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the formula for NPV gives:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)}$$\nThis expression relates NPV to specificity ($P(T^- | D^c)$), prevalence (via its complement, $P(D^c)$), and sensitivity (via its complement, $P(T^- | D)$).\n\nWe substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.90)}{(0.90)(0.90) + (0.20)(0.10)} = \\frac{0.81}{0.81 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.81}{0.83}$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9759036... \\approx 0.9759$$\n\n**Interpretation of Clinical Utility**\nThe calculated PPV is $0.4706$, or $47.06\\%$. This value, while a substantial increase from the pre-test probability (prevalence) of $10\\%$, is less than $50\\%$. It signifies that a positive anti-dsDNA test result in this clinical setting is not sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of SLE, as more than half of the positive results ($1 - 0.4706 = 0.5294$, or $52.94\\%$) will be false positives. Therefore, the test has limited utility for confirming the disease but is useful for raising the index of suspicion.\n\nThe calculated NPV is $0.9759$, or $97.59\\%$. This high value indicates that a negative test result is very reliable. If a patient tests negative, there is a very high probability that they do not have SLE. Thus, the anti-dsDNA test, in this context, is an excellent tool for ruling out SLE. A negative result can confidently be used to direct the diagnostic workup away from SLE.\n\nExtractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibody testing provides complementary information. SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a variety of autoantibodies. Anti-dsDNA is highly specific for SLE but is not found in all patients (sensitivity is $0.80$, not $1.00$). The ENA panel tests for antibodies against other nuclear antigens, such as Smith (Sm), Ro/SSA, La/SSB, and RNP. Anti-Sm antibodies are also highly specific for SLE. If a patient presents with clinical features of SLE but has a negative anti-dsDNA test, a positive ENA panel (e.g., positive anti-Sm) can help establish the diagnosis. Conversely, in a patient with a positive anti-dsDNA test (with its modest PPV), the presence of other confirmatory markers like anti-Sm would substantially increase the post-test probability, solidifying the diagnosis. The use of ENA testing in conjunction with anti-dsDNA testing improves overall diagnostic accuracy by accounting for the clinical and serological heterogeneity of SLE.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and its calculation for a specific diagnostic test under three different disease prevalences.\n\nLet us define the events:\n- $D$: The patient has the disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, SLE).\n- $D^c$: The patient does not have the disease.\n- $T^+$: The test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities, which are the fundamental characteristics of the diagnostic test and the population:\n- Sensitivity ($S_e$): The probability of a positive test given the disease is present. $S_e = P(T^+ \\mid D) = 75\\% = 0.75$.\n- Specificity ($S_p$): The probability of a negative test given the disease is absent. $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 95\\% = 0.95$.\n- Prevalence ($p$): The prior probability of the disease in the population being tested. $p = P(D)$.

Mathematically, this is the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nWe begin by applying Bayes' theorem to express the PPV:\n$$\nPPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly given: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ and $P(D) = p$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by marginalizing over the disease status (present or absent):\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nWe can express the terms in this expansion using the given definitions:\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ (Sensitivity)\n- $P(D) = p$ (Prevalence)\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual, also known as the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity. Since for a non-diseased individual the test can be either positive or negative, we have $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$. The specificity is $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - S_p$. For this problem, $1 - S_p = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (S_e)(p) + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expanded form of $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for the PPV:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the derived general expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the PPV for the given dsDNA assay at the three specified prevalences.

The provided data includes the number of condition-positive patients, $N_{+} = 48$, and the number of condition-negative patients, $N_{-} = 72$.\n\nFirst, we clarify the relationship between the provided counts and the performance metrics. A patient is classified as test-positive if their ENA panel index $I$ meets or exceeds a cutoff $c$, i.e., $I \\geq c$.\n- The number of condition-positives is $N_{+} = 48$.\n- The number of condition-negatives is $N_{-} = 72$.\n- True Positives ($\\text{TP}$) are condition-positives who test positive.

The Trade-off Between Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nThe trade-off arises from the dependency of both metrics on the chosen cutoff value, $c$. Let us analyze the effect of changing $c$ from a value $c_1$ to a higher value $c_2$, such that $c_2 > c_1$.\n\nThe condition for a positive test is $I \\geq c$. If we increase the cutoff from $c_1$ to $c_2$, the condition for a positive test becomes stricter. Consequently, the set of patients with an index $I$ such that $I \\geq c_2$ is a subset of the set of patients for whom $I \\geq c_1$. This implies that fewer (or an equal number of) patients will test positive at the higher cutoff $c_2$ compared to the lower cutoff $c_1$.\n\nThis affects the counts of true positives and false positives:\n- The number of true positives at $c_2$, denoted $\\text{TP}(c_2)$, will be less than or equal to the number of true positives at $c_1$, denoted $\\text{TP}(c_1)$. That is, $\\text{TP}(c_2) \\leq \\text{TP}(c_1)$. Since sensitivity is directly proportional to $\\text{TP}$ (i.e., $\\text{Sensitivity} = \\text{TP}/N_{+}$), it follows that $\\text{Sensitivity}(c_2) \\leq \\text{Sensitivity}(c_1)$. Thus, increasing the cutoff tends to decrease sensitivity.\n\n- Similarly, the number of false positives at $c_2$, $\\text{FP}(c_2)$, will be less than or equal to the number of false positives at $c_1$, $\\text{FP}(c_1)$. That is, $\\text{FP}(c_2) \\leq \\text{FP}(c_1)$. Specificity is defined as $\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{N_{-} - \\text{FP}}{N_{-}}$. As $\\text{FP}$ decreases, the numerator $N_{-} - \\text{FP}$ increases, and therefore specificity increases. It follows that $\\text{Specificity}(c_2) \\geq \\text{Specificity}(c_1)$. Thus, increasing the cutoff tends to increase specificity.\n\nIn summary, increasing the cutoff value $c$ leads to a decrease in sensitivity and an increase in specificity. Conversely, decreasing the cutoff $c$ makes the test positive criterion less strict, leading to an increase in sensitivity and a decrease in specificity. This inverse relationship constitutes the fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic testing based on a continuous marker. The Youden index $J$ is a measure that attempts to find a balance in this trade-off.\n\n**2.

Determination of the Optimal Cutoff**\n\nThe optimal cutoff among the candidates is the one that maximizes the Youden index, $J$. We compare the values of $J$ calculated for each cutoff:\n- $J(c=5) = \\frac{13}{24} \\approx 0.5417$\n- $J(c=8) = \\frac{7}{12} \\approx 0.5833$\n- $J(c=10) = \\frac{29}{48} \\approx 0.6042$\n- $J(c=12) = \\frac{11}{18} \\approx 0.6111$\n- $J(c=15) = \\frac{9}{16} = 0.5625$\n\nComparing these values, the maximum is $J(c=12) = \\frac{11}{18}$. Therefore, the cutoff that maximizes the Youden index is $c = 12 \\; \\mathrm{U/mL}$. The problem requests this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The integer $12$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we write $12.0$.",
