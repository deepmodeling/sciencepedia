            "problem": "An optical coagulation analyzer monitors clot formation at a wavelength of $660$ nanometers by recording the increase in apparent absorbance arising from light scattering by a growing fibrin network. Assume the instrument is baseline-corrected so that the absorbance at the instant of reagent addition is $0$. The apparent absorbance is modeled using Beer–Lambert law applied to an empirical, mass-specific turbidity coefficient: the instantaneous absorbance $A(t)$ is proportional to the path length $l$, the apparent specific absorbance coefficient $\\epsilon_{\\text{app}}$ (in $\\mathrm{L\\,g^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$), and the instantaneous concentration of formed fibrin $c_{\\text{fibrin}}(t)$ (in $\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$). A citrated plasma sample has fibrinogen concentration $c_{0} = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$. The cuvette path length is $l = 1.00$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. The analyzer is calibrated at $660$ nanometers to an empirical coefficient $\\epsilon_{\\text{app}} = 0.25$ $\\mathrm{L\\,g^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$.

The parameters are physically realistic for a coagulation assay. The question is well-defined and has a unique solution. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing a mathematical model that connects the concentration of formed fibrin to the measured absorbance, and then integrating a kinetic model for fibrin formation.\n\nThe apparent absorbance, $A(t)$, is given by the Beer–Lambert law adapted for the turbidimetric measurement:\n$$A(t) = \\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{\\text{fibrin}}(t)$$\nwhere $c_{\\text{fibrin}}(t)$ is the instantaneous concentration of the light-scattering fibrin network.\n\nThe formation of fibrin from fibrinogen is described as a pseudo-first-order kinetic process. Let $c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(t)$ be the concentration of unpolymerized fibrinogen at time $t$. The rate of its consumption is:\n$$\\frac{d c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(t)$$\nWith the initial condition $c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(0) = c_0$, the solution to this first-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(t) = c_{0} \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nBy conservation of mass, assuming the mass concentration is conserved during polymerization, the concentration of fibrin formed at time $t$ is the difference between the initial fibrinogen concentration and the remaining unpolymerized fibrinogen concentration:\n$$c_{\\text{fibrin}}(t) = c_{0} - c_{\\text{fibrinogen}}(t) = c_{0} - c_{0} \\exp(-kt) = c_{0}(1 - \\exp(-kt))$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $c_{\\text{fibrin}}(t)$ into the absorbance equation yields the time-dependent absorbance:\n$$A(t) = \\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{0}(1 - \\exp(-kt))$$\n\nThe problem first directs us to compute the asymptotic absorbance at completion, which we denote as $A_{\\text{max}}$. This is the absorbance as time approaches infinity ($t \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the exponential term $\\exp(-kt)$ approaches $0$ because $k > 0$.\n$$A_{\\text{max}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} A(t) = \\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{0}(1 - 0) = \\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{0}$$\nThis result corresponds physically to the total conversion of all initial fibrinogen into the fibrin network. We can calculate its value:\n$$A_{\\text{max}} = (0.25 \\mathrm{~L\\,g^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\cdot (1.00 \\mathrm{~cm}) \\cdot (2.0 \\mathrm{~g\\,L^{-1}}) = 0.50$$\nThe specified threshold absorbance $A_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.300$ is less than $A_{\\text{max}} = 0.50$, confirming that the threshold is reachable.\n\nNext, we determine the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which the absorbance first reaches the threshold value $A_{\\text{th}}$. This is found by setting $A(t^{\\ast}) = A_{\\text{th}}$ in our model:\n$$A_{\\text{th}} = \\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{0}(1 - \\exp(-kt^{\\ast}))$$\nRecognizing that the term $\\epsilon_{\\text{app}} \\cdot l \\cdot c_{0}$ is the maximum absorbance $A_{\\text{max}}$, we can write the equation more compactly:\n$$A_{\\text{th}} = A_{\\text{max}}(1 - \\exp(-kt^{\\ast}))$$\nWe now solve this equation for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\text{th}}}{A_{\\text{max}}} = 1 - \\exp(-kt^{\\ast})$$\n$$\\exp(-kt^{\\ast}) = 1 - \\frac{A_{\\text{th}}}{A_{\\text{max}}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides isolates the exponent:\n$$-kt^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{A_{\\text{th}}}{A_{\\text{max}}}\\right)$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{A_{\\text{th}}}{A_{\\text{max}}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression to find the value of $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$t^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{0.35} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{0.300}{0.50}\\right)$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{0.35} \\ln(1 - 0.60)$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{0.35} \\ln(0.40)$$\n\nUsing the value $\\ln(0.40) \\approx -0.91629073$:\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx -\\frac{1}{0.35} (-0.91629073) \\approx 2.6179735 \\mathrm{~s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final reported time to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx 2.618 \\mathrm{~s}$$",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of coagulation testing, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. The problem requires a rigorous, first-principles derivation of concentrations and a correction protocol, which is a meaningful exercise in stoichiometry and mass-balance calculations relevant to laboratory diagnostics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts as requested by the problem statement, followed by the final numerical computation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Citrate Concentration in Plasma, $C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H)$**\n\nWe are given that a volume of whole blood, $V_b$, is mixed with a volume of anticoagulant, $V_a$, in the ratio $V_b : V_a = 9:1$. The total amount of citrate added to the collection tube is given by the moles of citrate in the anticoagulant solution:\n$$n_{\\text{cit}} = C_{\\text{cit}} V_a$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{cit}} = 0.109\\ \\text{mol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$ is the concentration of sodium citrate in the anticoagulant.\n\nThe problem states that all citrate resides in the plasma phase after mixing. First, we must determine the total volume of this phase. The volume of whole blood is $V_b$. The hematocrit, $H$, represents the fraction of this volume occupied by packed cells. Therefore, the plasma volume within the blood sample is:\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, from blood}} = V_b (1 - H)$$\nThe total volume available for the citrate to dissolve in is the sum of the plasma volume from the blood and the aqueous volume of the anticoagulant itself, $V_a$.\n$$V_{\\text{total plasma phase}} = V_{\\text{plasma, from blood}} + V_a = V_b (1 - H) + V_a$$\nThe concentration of citrate in the plasma, $C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H)$, is the total moles of citrate divided by this total plasma phase volume:\n$$C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H) = \\frac{n_{\\text{cit}}}{V_{\\text{total plasma phase}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}} V_a}{V_b (1 - H) + V_a}$$\nWe can use the given ratio $V_b : V_a = 9:1$, which implies $V_b = 9V_a$. Substituting this into the expression, the term $V_a$ cancels out:\n$$C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H) = \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}} V_a}{9V_a (1 - H) + V_a} = \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{9(1 - H) + 1}$$\nSimplifying the denominator gives the final expression for the plasma citrate concentration as a function of hematocrit:\n$$C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H) = \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{9 - 9H + 1} = \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Post-Recalcification Free Calcium Concentration, $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H)$**\n\nThe analyzer mixes a volume of citrated plasma, $V_p = 100\\ \\mu\\text{L}$, with a volume of recalcification reagent, $V_{\\text{add}} = 100\\ \\mu\\text{L}$. The total volume of this reaction mixture is $V_{\\text{mix}} = V_p + V_{\\text{add}}$.\n\nThe total moles of citrate introduced into the reaction mixture from the plasma sample is:\n$$n_{\\text{cit,p}} = C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H) V_p$$\nThe total moles of calcium ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) introduced from the recalcification reagent is:\n$$n_{\\text{Ca,add}} = C_{\\text{Ca,add}} V_{\\text{add}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{Ca,add}} = 25\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nAccording to the problem, calcium ions and citrate ions react in a $1:1$ stoichiometric manner. Assuming the added calcium is in molar excess of the citrate, the number of moles of free calcium remaining after complexation is:\n$$n_{\\text{Ca,free}} = n_{\\text{Ca,add}} - n_{\\text{cit,p}}$$\nThe concentration of this free calcium, $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H)$, in the total reaction mixture volume $V_{\\text{mix}}$ is:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H) = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca,free}}}{V_{\\text{mix}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca,add}} - n_{\\text{cit,p}}}{V_p + V_{\\text{add}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for moles:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H) = \\frac{C_{\\text{Ca,add}} V_{\\text{add}} - C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H) V_p}{V_p + V_{\\text{add}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the derived expression for $C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H)$ from Part 1:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H) = \\frac{C_{\\text{Ca,add}} V_{\\text{add}} - \\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}\\right) V_p}{V_p + V_{\\text{add}}}$$\nGiven that $V_p = V_{\\text{add}} = 100\\ \\mu\\text{L}$, we can simplify this expression. Let $V = V_p = V_{\\text{add}}$:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H) = \\frac{C_{\\text{Ca,add}} V - \\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}\\right) V}{V + V} = \\frac{V \\left( C_{\\text{Ca,add}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H} \\right)}{2V}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{\\text{Ca,add}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 3: Quantification of Bias**\n\nWe quantify the bias by calculating the plasma fraction and the post-recalcification free calcium concentration at the nominal hematocrit $H_0 = 0.45$ and the high hematocrit $H_1 = 0.60$. For calculations, we use $C_{\\text{cit}} = 109\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$ and $C_{\\text{Ca,add}} = 25\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\n*   **Bias in plasma fraction in the collection tube:**\n    The volume of plasma in the tube is $V_{\\text{total plasma phase}} = V_b(1-H) + V_a$. The total collection volume is $V_b+V_a = 10V_a$. The fraction of plasma in the total liquid volume of the tube is $\\frac{V_b(1-H)+V_a}{V_b+V_a} = \\frac{9V_a(1-H)+V_a}{10V_a} = \\frac{9(1-H)+1}{10} = \\frac{10-9H}{10} = 1 - 0.9H$.\n    At $H_0 = 0.45$: plasma fraction is $1 - 0.9(0.45) = 1 - 0.405 = 0.595$.\n    At $H_1 = 0.60$: plasma fraction is $1 - 0.9(0.60) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.460$.\n    The high hematocrit sample has a significantly lower plasma-to-anticoagulant ratio, leading to over-citration of the plasma component.\n\n*   **Bias in post-recalcification free calcium $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}$:**\n    First, we calculate the plasma citrate concentration for both cases:\n    $C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H_0 = 0.45) = \\frac{109}{10 - 9(0.45)} = \\frac{109}{10 - 4.05} = \\frac{109}{5.95} \\approx 18.319\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n    $C_{\\text{cit,plasma}}(H_1 = 0.60) = \\frac{109}{10 - 9(0.60)} = \\frac{109}{10 - 5.4} = \\frac{109}{4.6} \\approx 23.696\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\n    Now, we calculate the free calcium concentration for both cases:\n    $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H_0 = 0.45) = \\frac{1}{2}(25 - \\frac{109}{5.95}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(25 - 18.319) = 3.3405\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n    $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H_1 = 0.60) = \\frac{1}{2}(25 - \\frac{109}{4.6}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(25 - 23.696) = 0.652\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n    The bias is substantial: the free calcium concentration in the high-hematocrit sample is only about $19.5\\%$ of the nominal value, which would drastically and artifactually prolong the measured clotting time.\n\n**Part 4: Correction Protocol and Final Calculation**\n\nWe aim to derive an expression for a corrected calcium reagent concentration, $C_{\\text{Ca,corr}}$, that achieves a target free calcium concentration, $T$, for any hematocrit $H$. The target is defined as the concentration at the nominal hematocrit $H_0$:\n$$T = [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free}}(H_0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{\\text{Ca,add}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H_0}\\right)$$\nThe free calcium concentration achieved with a corrected reagent concentration $C_{\\text{Ca,corr}}$ for a patient with hematocrit $H$ is:\n$$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{free,corr}}(H) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}\\right)$$\nSetting this equal to the target $T$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{\\text{Ca,add}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H_0}\\right)$$\nMultiplying by $2$ and solving for $C_{\\text{Ca,corr}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H} = C_{\\text{Ca,add}} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H_0}$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = C_{\\text{Ca,add}} + \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H} - \\frac{C_{\\text{cit}}}{10 - 9H_0}$$\nThis can be factored to yield the closed-form expression for the correction protocol:\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = C_{\\text{Ca,add}} + C_{\\text{cit}}\\left(\\frac{1}{10 - 9H} - \\frac{1}{10 - 9H_0}\\right)$$\nThis validated protocol allows for the calculation of the appropriate CaCl$_2$ concentration based on a patient's measured hematocrit $H$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $C_{\\text{Ca,corr}}$ for the high hematocrit case $H_1 = 0.60$.\nWe have $H = 0.60$, $H_0 = 0.45$, $C_{\\text{cit}} = 109\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$, and $C_{\\text{Ca,add}} = 25\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109\\left(\\frac{1}{10 - 9(0.60)} - \\frac{1}{10 - 9(0.45)}\\right)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109\\left(\\frac{1}{10 - 5.4} - \\frac{1}{10 - 4.05}\\right)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109\\left(\\frac{1}{4.6} - \\frac{1}{5.95}\\right)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109\\left(\\frac{5.95 - 4.6}{4.6 \\times 5.95}\\right)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109\\left(\\frac{1.35}{27.37}\\right)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 109(0.049324077...)$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 25 + 5.37632444...$$\n$$C_{\\text{Ca,corr}} = 30.37632444...\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the required corrected concentration is $30.38\\ \\text{mmol}\\ \\text{L}^{-1}$.",

Substituting this definition into the threshold condition yields:\n$$-\\log_{10}(T_{\\text{m}}(t_{\\mathrm{c}})) - (-\\log_{10}(T_{\\text{m}}(0))) = \\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{m}}(0)}{T_{\\text{m}}(t_{\\mathrm{c}})}\\right) = \\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ gives:\n$$\\frac{T_{\\text{m}}(0)}{T_{\\text{m}}(t_{\\mathrm{c}})} = 10^{\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for $T_{\\text{m}}(t_{\\mathrm{c}})$:\n$$T_{\\text{m}}(t_{\\mathrm{c}}) = T_{\\text{m}}(0) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nThe measured transmittance $T_{\\text{m}}(t)$ is related to the true sample transmittance $T(t)$ and the stray-light fraction $s$ by the relation:\n$$T_{\\text{m}}(t) = \\frac{T(t) + s}{1 + s}$$\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we have:\n$$\\frac{T(t_{\\mathrm{c}}) + s}{1 + s} = \\left(\\frac{T(0) + s}{1 + s}\\right) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nThe factor $(1+s)$ cancels from both sides, provided $s \\neq -1$, which is physically guaranteed as $s$ is a fraction of radiant power and thus non-negative.\n$$T(t_{\\mathrm{c}}) + s = (T(0) + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\nSolving for $T(t_{\\mathrm{c}})$:\n$$T(t_{\\mathrm{c}}) = (T(0) + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s$$\nThe true transmittance $T(t)$ is modeled as $T(t) = T_{\\infty} + (T_{0} - T_{\\infty})\\exp(-t/\\tau)$. At $t=0$, this gives $T(0) = T_{\\infty} + (T_{0} - T_{\\infty})\\exp(0) = T_{\\infty} + T_{0} - T_{\\infty} = T_{0}$.\nSubstituting the model for $T(t)$ at $t=t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $T(0)=T_0$ into the equation for $T(t_c)$:\n$$T_{\\infty} + (T_{0} - T_{\\infty})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\tau}\\right) = (T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s$$\nWe now solve for $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$(T_{0} - T_{\\infty})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\tau}\\right) = (T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}{T_0 - T_{\\infty}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}{T_0 - T_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nFinally, solving for $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ gives the desired closed-form expression as a function of $s$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{c}}(s) = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}{T_0 - T_{\\infty}}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0 - T_{\\infty}}{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the standard uncertainty $u_t$ in $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ arising from the standard uncertainty $u_s$ in $s$. Using first-order uncertainty propagation, $u_t$ is given by:\n$$u_t = \\left| \\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} \\right| u_s$$\nWe must compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s}$. For clarity, let the argument of the logarithm be $F(s)$:\n$$F(s) = \\frac{T_0 - T_{\\infty}}{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}$$\nThen $t_{\\mathrm{c}}(s) = \\tau \\ln(F(s))$, and the derivative is $\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} = \\tau \\frac{1}{F(s)} \\frac{\\partial F(s)}{\\partial s}$. Let the denominator of $F(s)$ be $D(s) = (T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}$. The numerator is constant with respect to $s$.\nUsing the quotient rule, $\\frac{\\partial F(s)}{\\partial s} = (T_0 - T_{\\infty}) \\cdot \\left(- \\frac{1}{D(s)^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial D(s)}{\\partial s}$.\nThe derivative of the denominator is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial D(s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( T_0 \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} + s \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty} \\right) = 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - 1$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} = \\tau \\frac{D(s)}{T_0 - T_{\\infty}} \\cdot (T_0 - T_{\\infty}) \\cdot \\left(- \\frac{1}{D(s)^2}\\right) \\cdot (10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - 1)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} = -\\frac{\\tau}{D(s)} (10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - 1) = \\frac{\\tau(1 - 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}})}{D(s)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D(s)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\tau(1 - 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}})}{(T_0 + s) \\cdot 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}} - s - T_{\\infty}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $T_{0} = 0.95$, $T_{\\infty} = 0.40$, $\\tau = 12\\ \\text{s}$, $s = 0.0050$, and $\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.150$.\nFirst, calculate the constant term $10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}$:\n$$10^{-0.150} \\approx 0.70794578$$\nThe numerator of the derivative is:\n$$\\tau(1 - 10^{-\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{th}}}) \\approx 12 \\times (1 - 0.70794578) = 12 \\times 0.29205422 \\approx 3.5046506$$\nThe denominator of the derivative is:\n$$(0.95 + 0.0050) \\cdot 10^{-0.150} - 0.0050 - 0.40 = (0.955) \\cdot 10^{-0.150} - 0.405$$\n$$\\approx 0.955 \\times 0.70794578 - 0.405 \\approx 0.67608827 - 0.405 = 0.27108827$$\nNow we compute the sensitivity coefficient:\n$$\\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} \\approx \\frac{3.5046506}{0.27108827} \\approx 12.92795 \\ \\text{s}$$\nThe uncertainty $u_t$ is calculated using $u_s = 0.0010$:\n$$u_t = \\left| \\frac{\\partial t_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\partial s} \\right| u_s \\approx 12.92795 \\times 0.0010 = 0.01292795\\ \\text{s}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$u_t \\approx 0.01293\\ \\text{s}$$",
