            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory is building a triage algorithm to narrow the differential diagnosis among three common gram-negative non-fermenters using only two rapid spot tests: the oxidase test and the catalase test. The three taxa considered are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Eikenella corrodens. Based on well-established biochemical phenotypes, assume the following true organism properties: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, Acinetobacter baumannii is oxidase-negative and catalase-positive, and Eikenella corrodens is oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. The laboratory verifies the following test performance characteristics on reference strains: for organisms that are truly oxidase-positive, the oxidase test has sensitivity $0.96$; for oxidase-negative organisms, the oxidase test has specificity $0.98$. For organisms that are truly catalase-positive, the catalase test has sensitivity $0.95$; for catalase-negative organisms, the catalase test has specificity $0.97$. Assume conditional independence of the oxidase and catalase test results given the organism identity. In the laboratory’s specimen mix, the prior probabilities of the taxa are $P(\\text{Pseudomonas aeruginosa})=0.50$, $P(\\text{Acinetobacter baumannii})=0.35$, and $P(\\text{Eikenella corrodens})=0.15$. \n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, construct an optimal decision rule that assigns an isolate to one of the three taxa based solely on the binary oxidase and catalase results by maximizing the posterior probability of the taxon given the test results. Then, under this rule and the stated assumptions, compute the expected misclassification probability (overall error rate) across the specimen mix. Express the error rate as a decimal fraction and round your final answer to four significant figures.",

Let the evidence $E$ be the ordered pair of test results $(R_{ox}, R_{cat})$, where $R_{ox}$ is the oxidase test result and $R_{cat}$ is the catalase test result. Each result can be positive ($+$) or negative ($-$). There are four possible evidence states: $E_1=(+,+)$, $E_2=(+,-)$, $E_3=(-,+)$, and $E_4=(-,-)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the conditional probabilities of observing each test result, given the true state of the organism.\nFor the oxidase test:\n$P(R_{ox+} | S_{O+}) = \\text{Sens}_{ox} = 0.96$\n$P(R_{ox-} | S_{O+}) = 1 - \\text{Sens}_{ox} = 0.04$\n$P(R_{ox-} | S_{O-}) = \\text{Spec}_{ox} = 0.98$\n$P(R_{ox+} | S_{O-}) = 1 - \\text{Spec}_{ox} = 0.02$\n\nFor the catalase test:\n$P(R_{cat+} | S_{C+}) = \\text{Sens}_{cat} = 0.95$\n$P(R_{cat-} | S_{C+}) = 1 - \\text{Sens}_{cat} = 0.05$\n$P(R_{cat-} | S_{C-}) = \\text{Spec}_{cat} = 0.97$\n$P(R_{cat+} | S_{C-}) = 1 - \\text{Spec}_{cat} = 0.03$\n\nNext, we calculate the likelihoods $P(E|T)$ for each combination of evidence $E$ and taxon $T$. Due to the conditional independence of the tests, $P(E|T) = P(R_{ox}|T) \\times P(R_{cat}|T)$.\n\nFor $T_{Pa}$ (True state: $S_{O+}, S_{C+}$):\n$P(E_1|T_{Pa}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C+}) = 0.96 \\times 0.95 = 0.912$\n$P(E_2|T_{Pa}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C+}) = 0.96 \\times 0.05 = 0.048$\n$P(E_3|T_{Pa}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C+}) = 0.04 \\times 0.95 = 0.038$\n$P(E_4|T_{Pa}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C+}) = 0.04 \\times 0.05 = 0.002$\n\nFor $T_{Ab}$ (True state: $S_{O-}, S_{C+}$):\n$P(E_1|T_{Ab}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O-})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C+}) = 0.02 \\times 0.95 = 0.019$\n$P(E_2|T_{Ab}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O-})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C+}) = 0.02 \\times 0.05 = 0.001$\n$P(E_3|T_{Ab}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O-})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C+}) = 0.98 \\times 0.95 = 0.931$\n$P(E_4|T_{Ab}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O-})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C+}) = 0.98 \\times 0.05 = 0.049$\n\nFor $T_{Ec}$ (True state: $S_{O+}, S_{C-}$):\n$P(E_1|T_{Ec}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C-}) = 0.96 \\times 0.03 = 0.0288$\n$P(E_2|T_{Ec}) = P(R_{ox+}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C-}) = 0.96 \\times 0.97 = 0.9312$\n$P(E_3|T_{Ec}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat+}|S_{C-}) = 0.04 \\times 0.03 = 0.0012$\n$P(E_4|T_{Ec}) = P(R_{ox-}|S_{O+})P(R_{cat-}|S_{C-}) = 0.04 \\times 0.97 = 0.0388$\n\nThe optimal decision rule, which maximizes the posterior probability $P(T|E)$, is equivalent to choosing the taxon $T$ that maximizes the joint probability $P(E, T) = P(E|T)P(T)$ for a given evidence $E$. We compute this for each of the four evidence states. The given prior probabilities are $P(T_{Pa})=0.50$, $P(T_{Ab})=0.35$, and $P(T_{Ec})=0.15$.\n\nCase 1: Evidence $E_1 = (+,+)$\n$P(E_1, T_{Pa}) = P(E_1|T_{Pa})P(T_{Pa}) = 0.912 \\times 0.50 = 0.456$\n$P(E_1, T_{Ab}) = P(E_1|T_{Ab})P(T_{Ab}) = 0.019 \\times 0.35 = 0.00665$\n$P(E_1, T_{Ec}) = P(E_1|T_{Ec})P(T_{Ec}) = 0.0288 \\times 0.15 = 0.00432$\nThe maximum is $0.456$, so the decision is to classify as $T_{Pa}$.\n\nCase 2: Evidence $E_2 = (+,-)$\n$P(E_2, T_{Pa}) = P(E_2|T_{Pa})P(T_{Pa}) = 0.048 \\times 0.50 = 0.024$\n$P(E_2, T_{Ab}) = P(E_2|T_{Ab})P(T_{Ab}) = 0.001 \\times 0.35 = 0.00035$\n$P(E_2, T_{Ec}) = P(E_2|T_{Ec})P(T_{Ec}) = 0.9312 \\times 0.15 = 0.13968$\nThe maximum is $0.13968$, so the decision is to classify as $T_{Ec}$.\n\nCase 3: Evidence $E_3 = (-,+)$\n$P(E_3, T_{Pa}) = P(E_3|T_{Pa})P(T_{Pa}) = 0.038 \\times 0.50 = 0.019$\n$P(E_3, T_{Ab}) = P(E_3|T_{Ab})P(T_{Ab}) = 0.931 \\times 0.35 = 0.32585$\n$P(E_3, T_{Ec}) = P(E_3|T_{Ec})P(T_{Ec}) = 0.0012 \\times 0.15 = 0.00018$\nThe maximum is $0.32585$, so the decision is to classify as $T_{Ab}$.\n\nCase 4: Evidence $E_4 = (-,-)$\n$P(E_4, T_{Pa}) = P(E_4|T_{Pa})P(T_{Pa}) = 0.002 \\times 0.50 = 0.001$\n$P(E_4, T_{Ab}) = P(E_4|T_{Ab})P(T_{Ab}) = 0.049 \\times 0.35 = 0.01715$\n$P(E_4, T_{Ec}) = P(E_4|T_{Ec})P(T_{Ec}) = 0.0388 \\times 0.15 = 0.00582$\nThe maximum is $0.01715$, so the decision is to classify as $T_{Ab}$.\n\nThe optimal decision rule is:\n- If $(R_{ox+}, R_{cat+})$, classify as $T_{Pa}$.\n- If $(R_{ox+}, R_{cat-})$, classify as $T_{Ec}$.\n- If $(R_{ox-}, R_{cat+})$, classify as $T_{Ab}$.\n- If $(R_{ox-}, R_{cat-})$, classify as $T_{Ab}$.\n\nThe expected misclassification probability (error rate), $P_{error}$, is the sum of the probabilities of all events that lead to a misclassification. This is calculated using the law of total probability:\n$P_{error} = \\sum_{T} P(\\text{misclassify organism } T) = \\sum_{T} P(\\text{misclassify}|T)P(T)$\n\nWe calculate the conditional probability of misclassification for each taxon.\n- For $T_{Pa}$: Misclassification occurs if the evidence is not $E_1$.\n$P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Pa}) = P(E_2|T_{Pa}) + P(E_3|T_{Pa}) + P(E_4|T_{Pa}) = 0.048 + 0.038 + 0.002 = 0.088$.\n- For $T_{Ab}$: Misclassification occurs if the evidence is not $E_3$ or $E_4$.\n$P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Ab}) = P(E_1|T_{Ab}) + P(E_2|T_{Ab}) = 0.019 + 0.001 = 0.020$.\n- For $T_{Ec}$: Misclassification occurs if the evidence is not $E_2$.\n$P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Ec}) = P(E_1|T_{Ec}) + P(E_3|T_{Ec}) + P(E_4|T_{Ec}) = 0.0288 + 0.0012 + 0.0388 = 0.0688$.\n\nNow, we compute the total error rate:\n$P_{error} = P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Pa})P(T_{Pa}) + P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Ab})P(T_{Ab}) + P(\\text{misclassify}|T_{Ec})P(T_{Ec})$\n$P_{error} = (0.088)(0.50) + (0.020)(0.35) + (0.0688)(0.15)$\n$P_{error} = 0.044 + 0.007 + 0.01032$\n$P_{error} = 0.06132$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The laboratory has access to two tests: a rapid oxidase test and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The following are established facts for this setting.\n\n- Prevalence priors for an intensive care unit isolate: the prior probability that the organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa is $0.55$, and the prior probability that it is Acinetobacter baumannii is $0.45$.\n- Oxidase test performance: the probability of an oxidase-positive result given Pseudomonas aeruginosa is $0.98$, and the probability of an oxidase-positive result given Acinetobacter baumannii is $0.05$. The oxidase test has a monetary cost of $\\$15$ and a mean turnaround time of $0.25$ hours.\n- MALDI-TOF MS performance: when performed and reported, MALDI-TOF MS returns a species-level identification that is correct with probability $0.97$ and incorrect with probability $0.03$. MALDI-TOF MS has a monetary cost of $\\$150$ and a mean turnaround time of $1.5$ hours.\n- Time penalty: the per-hour delay to a definitive report incurs an expected clinical delay cost of $\\$250$ per hour.\n- Misidentification risk cost: if the final reported identification is incorrect, the expected clinical risk cost is $\\$4000$.\n\nAssume the following decision framework:\n- If MALDI-TOF MS is performed at any point, the laboratory reports the MALDI-TOF MS identification as definitive, independent of any oxidase result.\n- If MALDI-TOF MS is not performed, the laboratory reports based on the oxidase result alone: oxidase-positive implies a report of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; oxidase-negative implies a report of Acinetobacter baumannii.\n- The laboratory may choose among the following policies: perform MALDI-TOF MS for all specimens without oxidase; perform oxidase only; perform oxidase first and then perform MALDI-TOF MS conditional on oxidase-positive; perform oxidase first and then perform MALDI-TOF MS conditional on oxidase-negative; perform oxidase first and then perform MALDI-TOF MS in all cases.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of expected value and Bayes’ theorem, derive the expected total cost (monetary plus time penalty plus expected misidentification risk cost) for each policy and determine the minimal expected total cost across policies.

            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory seeks to formalize the identification of a Gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting bacillus using a classifier based on four routinely available test results: oxidase reaction, growth at $42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, pigment production, and the oxidation-fermentation test pattern. The goal is to distinguish among three common genera: Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. Starting from Bayes' theorem and the definition of conditional independence, derive a naïve Bayes classification rule that combines these four features to compute the posterior probability of each genus given an observed test profile. Then, apply your derived rule to the following empirically determined prior and conditional probabilities, which were estimated from a historically representative dataset of non-fermenters processed in the laboratory.\n\nLet the class variable be $C \\in \\{P, A, S\\}$, where $P$ denotes Pseudomonas, $A$ denotes Acinetobacter, and $S$ denotes Stenotrophomonas. The feature variables are:\n- $X_1$: oxidase reaction, with values $\\{\\text{positive}, \\text{negative}\\}$.\n- $X_2$: growth at $42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, with values $\\{\\text{growth}, \\text{no growth}\\}$.\n- $X_3$: pigment production, with values $\\{\\text{present}, \\text{absent}\\}$, where pigment refers to a pyocyanin-like chromogenic phenotype on agar.\n- $X_4$: oxidation-fermentation (OF) test pattern for glucose, with values $\\{\\text{oxidative}, \\text{non-utilizer}, \\text{fermentative}\\}$, where the oxidation-fermentation test (OF) is the classical Hugh and Leifson method.\n\nAssume the following priors:\n- $\\Pr(C=P) = 0.4$, $\\Pr(C=A) = 0.35$, $\\Pr(C=S) = 0.25$.\n\nAssume the following conditional probabilities:\n- Oxidase ($X_1$): $\\Pr(X_1=\\text{positive}\\mid C=P)=0.96$, $\\Pr(X_1=\\text{positive}\\mid C=A)=0.04$, $\\Pr(X_1=\\text{positive}\\mid C=S)=0.08$; use the complement for $\\text{negative}$ in each case.\n- Growth at $42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($X_2$): $\\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=P)=0.88$, $\\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=A)=0.18$, $\\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=S)=0.06$; use the complement for $\\text{no growth}$ in each case.\n- Pigment ($X_3$): $\\Pr(X_3=\\text{present}\\mid C=P)=0.72$, $\\Pr(X_3=\\text{present}\\mid C=A)=0.02$, $\\Pr(X_3=\\text{present}\\mid C=S)=0.12$; use the complement for $\\text{absent}$ in each case.\n- OF pattern ($X_4$): $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxidative}\\mid C=P)=0.93$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{non-utilizer}\\mid C=P)=0.07$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{fermentative}\\mid C=P)=0.00$; $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxidative}\\mid C=A)=0.35$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{non-utilizer}\\mid C=A)=0.65$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{fermentative}\\mid C=A)=0.00$; $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxidative}\\mid C=S)=0.89$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{non-utilizer}\\mid C=S)=0.11$, $\\Pr(X_4=\\text{fermentative}\\mid C=S)=0.00$.\n\nFor an isolate with the observed profile $X_1=\\text{positive}$, $X_2=\\text{growth}$, $X_3=\\text{present}$, and $X_4=\\text{oxidative}$, compute the posterior probability $\\Pr(C=P \\mid X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)$ produced by your naïve Bayes classifier. Express your answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures. No physical units are required for probabilities.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive a naïve Bayes classification rule and apply it to find the posterior probability $\\Pr(C=P \\mid \\mathbf{X})$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of observed test results $(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)$.\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes' theorem, which relates the posterior probability of a class $c_k$ from the set $\\{P, A, S\\}$ to the class prior probability and the class-conditional probability of the evidence:\n$$ \\Pr(C=c_k \\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{\\Pr(\\mathbf{X} \\mid C=c_k) \\Pr(C=c_k)}{\\Pr(\\mathbf{X})} $$\nHere, $\\Pr(C=c_k)$ is the prior probability of class $c_k$. The term $\\Pr(\\mathbf{X} \\mid C=c_k)$ is the likelihood of observing the feature vector $\\mathbf{X}$ given that the class is $c_k$. The term $\\Pr(\\mathbf{X})$ is the marginal probability of observing the feature vector $\\mathbf{X}$, often called the evidence.\n\nThe \"naïve\" assumption of the naïve Bayes classifier is that the features $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ are conditionally independent given the class $C$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\Pr(\\mathbf{X} \\mid C=c_k) = \\Pr(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 \\mid C=c_k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\Pr(X_i \\mid C=c_k) $$\nSubstituting this independence assumption into Bayes' theorem yields the naïve Bayes classification rule:\n$$ \\Pr(C=c_k \\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{\\Pr(C=c_k) \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\Pr(X_i \\mid C=c_k)}{\\Pr(\\mathbf{X})} $$\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(\\mathbf{X})$, serves as a normalization constant to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum to $1$ over all classes. It can be computed by summing the unnormalized posteriors (the numerators) over all possible classes $c_j \\in \\{P, A, S\\}$:\n$$ \\Pr(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{P,A,S\\}} \\Pr(\\mathbf{X} \\mid C=c_j) \\Pr(C=c_j) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{P,A,S\\}} \\left( \\Pr(C=c_j) \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\Pr(X_i \\mid C=c_j) \\right) $$\nThus, the full expression for the posterior probability for a given class $c_k$ is:\n$$ \\Pr(C=c_k \\mid \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{\\Pr(C=c_k) \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\Pr(X_i \\mid C=c_k)}{\\sum_{j \\in \\{P,A,S\\}} \\left( \\Pr(C=c_j) \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\Pr(X_i \\mid C=c_j) \\right)} $$\nThis is the derived naïve Bayes classification rule.\n\nApplying this rule to the specific case provided, the observed feature vector is $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}} = (X_1=\\text{positive}, X_2=\\text{growth}, X_3=\\text{present}, X_4=\\text{oxidative})$. The goal is to compute $\\Pr(C=P \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}})$.\n\nTo do this, the unnormalized posterior, which is proportional to the true posterior, is calculated for each of the three classes. Let's denote this quantity by $L(C)$.\n\nFor Pseudomonas ($C=P$):\n$$ L(P) = \\Pr(C=P) \\times \\Pr(X_1=\\text{pos}\\mid C=P) \\times \\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=P) \\times \\Pr(X_3=\\text{pres}\\mid C=P) \\times \\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxid}\\mid C=P) $$\n$$ L(P) = 0.4 \\times 0.96 \\times 0.88 \\times 0.72 \\times 0.93 $$\n$$ L(P) = 0.225796096 $$\n\nFor Acinetobacter ($C=A$):\n$$ L(A) = \\Pr(C=A) \\times \\Pr(X_1=\\text{pos}\\mid C=A) \\times \\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=A) \\times \\Pr(X_3=\\text{pres}\\mid C=A) \\times \\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxid}\\mid C=A) $$\n$$ L(A) = 0.35 \\times 0.04 \\times 0.18 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.35 $$\n$$ L(A) = 0.00001764 $$\n\nFor Stenotrophomonas ($C=S$):\n$$ L(S) = \\Pr(C=S) \\times \\Pr(X_1=\\text{pos}\\mid C=S) \\times \\Pr(X_2=\\text{growth}\\mid C=S) \\times \\Pr(X_3=\\text{pres}\\mid C=S) \\times \\Pr(X_4=\\text{oxid}\\mid C=S) $$\n$$ L(S) = 0.25 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.89 $$\n$$ L(S) = 0.00012816 $$\n\nThe normalization constant (evidence) is the sum of these values:\n$$ \\Pr(\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}}) = L(P) + L(A) + L(S) $$\n$$ \\Pr(\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}}) = 0.225796096 + 0.00001764 + 0.00012816 = 0.225941896 $$\n\nFinally, the posterior probability for Pseudomonas is computed by dividing its unnormalized posterior by the evidence term:\n$$ \\Pr(C=P \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}}) = \\frac{L(P)}{\\Pr(\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}})} $$\n$$ \\Pr(C=P \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}}) = \\frac{0.225796096}{0.225941896} \\approx 0.999354714 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Pr(C=P \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{obs}}) \\approx 0.9994 $$",
