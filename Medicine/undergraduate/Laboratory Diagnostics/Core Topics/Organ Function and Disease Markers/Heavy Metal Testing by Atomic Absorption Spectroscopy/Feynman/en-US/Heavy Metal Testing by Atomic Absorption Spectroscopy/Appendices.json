            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the characteristic concentration, $c_0$, for zinc using flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). This problem is based on the application of the Beer–Lambert law in the context of an empirical calibration.\n\nThe Beer–Lambert law describes the linear relationship between absorbance, $A$, and the concentration, $c$, of an absorbing species, given by $A = \\epsilon b c$, where $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity and $b$ is the path length. In instrumental analysis such as AAS, a practical calibration curve is generated by plotting measured absorbance values against known concentrations of a series of standards.\n\nThe problem states that for low concentrations, this calibration relationship is linear and, after blank subtraction, the intercept is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, the governing equation for the calibration can be expressed as:\n$$A = m \\cdot c$$\nwhere $A$ is the measured absorbance, $c$ is the analyte concentration, and $m$ is the slope of the linear calibration plot.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe slope of the calibration curve, $m = 2.20 \\times 10^{-4}$ absorbance per $\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$.\nThe characteristic concentration, $c_0$, is defined as the concentration of the analyte that produces a specific absorbance, which we will denote as $A_0$. The value for this absorbance is given as $A_0 = 0.0044$. This value corresponds to a fractional absorption of $0.01$ (or $1\\%$), as confirmed by the relationship $A = -\\log_{10}(1 - \\text{fractional absorption}) = -\\log_{10}(1 - 0.01) = -\\log_{10}(0.99) \\approx 0.00436$, which is commonly rounded to $0.0044$ in this context.\n\nTo find the characteristic concentration $c_0$, we rearrange the calibration equation to solve for concentration:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{m}$$\nSubstituting the specific values for the characteristic concentration, we get:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{A_0}{m}$$\nNow, we insert the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$A_0 = 0.0044$$\n$$m = 2.20 \\times 10^{-4} \\frac{\\text{absorbance}}{\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}}$$\nSo, the calculation for $c_0$ is:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{0.0044}{2.20 \\times 10^{-4}} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we can write the numerator in scientific notation:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{4.4 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.20 \\times 10^{-4}} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = \\left(\\frac{4.4}{2.20}\\right) \\times 10^{-3 - (-4)} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = 2 \\times 10^{1} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = 20 \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $20$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $20.0$.\n$$c_0 = 20.0 \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\nThe characteristic concentration, $c_0$, is an instrumental parameter indicating sensitivity; a lower value of $c_0$ signifies a more sensitive method, as a smaller concentration is needed to generate a reference signal corresponding to $1\\%$ absorption.",

Fitting the Linear Model $A = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} c$**\n\nWe use ordinary least squares (OLS) to find the estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$.\n$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^N (c_k - \\bar{c})(A_k - \\bar{A})}{\\sum_{k=1}^N (c_k - \\bar{c})^2} = \\frac{S_{cA}}{S_{cc}}$\n$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{A} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{c}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary sums and means over all $N=15$ observations:\n$\\sum c_k = 3(0.00) + 3(0.50) + 3(1.00) + 3(2.00) + 3(4.00) = 22.5$\n$\\bar{c} = \\frac{22.5}{15} = 1.5$\n$\\sum A_k = 3(0.005) + 3(0.105) + 3(0.205) + 3(0.405) + 3(0.771) = 4.473$\n$\\bar{A} = \\frac{4.473}{15} = 0.2982$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of squares for $c$ ($S_{cc}$) and the sum of cross-products ($S_{cA}$):\n$S_{cc} = \\sum (c_k - \\bar{c})^2 = \\sum c_k^2 - N \\bar{c}^2$\n$\\sum c_k^2 = 3(0.00^2) + 3(0.50^2) + 3(1.00^2) + 3(2.00^2) + 3(4.00^2) = 0 + 0.75 + 3 + 12 + 48 = 63.75$\n$S_{cc} = 63.75 - 15(1.5)^2 = 63.75 - 33.75 = 30$\n\n$S_{cA} = \\sum (c_k - \\bar{c})(A_k - \\bar{A}) = \\sum c_k A_k - N \\bar{c} \\bar{A}$\n$\\sum c_k A_k = 0.00 \\times 3(0.005) + 0.50 \\times 3(0.105) + 1.00 \\times 3(0.205) + 2.00 \\times 3(0.405) + 4.00 \\times 3(0.771) = 0 + 0.1575 + 0.615 + 2.43 + 9.252 = 12.4545$\n$S_{cA} = 12.4545 - 15(1.5)(0.2982) = 12.4545 - 6.7095 = 5.745$\n\nNow we can compute the estimates:\n$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{5.745}{30} = 0.1915$\n$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = 0.2982 - (0.1915)(1.5) = 0.2982 - 0.28725 = 0.01095$\nThe fitted linear model is $\\hat{A} = 0.01095 + 0.1915 c$.\n\n**3. Calculation of Lack-of-Fit Sum of Squares ($SS_{LOF}$)**\n\nThe lack-of-fit sum of squares is given by:\n$SS_{LOF} = \\sum_{i=1}^{g} n_i (\\bar{A}_i - \\hat{A}_i)^2$\nwhere $\\hat{A}_i$ is the predicted absorbance from the model at concentration $c_i$.\n\n- $c_1=0.00$: $\\hat{A}_1 = 0.01095$. Term: $3(0.005 - 0.01095)^2 = 3(-0.00595)^2 = 1.062075 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- $c_2=0.50$: $\\hat{A}_2 = 0.01095 + 0.1915(0.5) = 0.1067$. Term: $3(0.105 - 0.1067)^2 = 3(-0.0017)^2 = 8.67 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $c_3=1.00$: $\\hat{A}_3 = 0.01095 + 0.1915(1) = 0.20245$. Term: $3(0.205 - 0.20245)^2 = 3(0.00255)^2 = 1.95075 \\times 10^{-5}$\n- $c_4=2.00$: $\\hat{A}_4 = 0.01095 + 0.1915(2) = 0.39395$. Term: $3(0.405 - 0.39395)^2 = 3(0.01105)^2 = 3.663075 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- $c_5=4.00$: $\\hat{A}_5 = 0.01095 + 0.1915(4) = 0.77695$. Term: $3(0.771 - 0.77695)^2 = 3(-0.00595)^2 = 1.062075 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\n$SS_{LOF} = 1.062075\\times 10^{-4} + 0.0867\\times 10^{-4} + 0.195075\\times 10^{-4} + 3.663075\\times 10^{-4} + 1.062075\\times 10^{-4}$\n$SS_{LOF} = (1.062075 + 0.0867 + 0.195075 + 3.663075 + 1.062075) \\times 10^{-4} = 6.069 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.0006069$.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for lack of fit are $df_{LOF} = g - p = 5 - 2 = 3$.\nThe mean square for lack of fit is $MS_{LOF} = \\frac{SS_{LOF}}{df_{LOF}} = \\frac{0.0006069}{3} = 0.0002023$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the F-statistic and Interpretation**\n\nThe $F$-statistic for the lack-of-fit test is:\n$F = \\frac{MS_{LOF}}{MS_{PE}} = \\frac{0.0002023}{1.6 \\times 10^{-6}} = 126.4375$\n\nTo interpret this result, we compare it to a critical value from the $F$-distribution at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level with $df_{LOF} = 3$ numerator degrees of freedom and $df_{PE} = 10$ denominator degrees of freedom.\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the linear model is adequate.\nThe alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is that the linear model is not adequate.\nThe critical value is $F_{crit} = F_{0.05, 3, 10} \\approx 3.71$.\n\nSince our calculated $F$-statistic, $F = 126.4375$, is much larger than the critical value $F_{crit} = 3.71$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence of lack of fit. This indicates that the simple linear model $A = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} c$ is not an adequate description of the relationship between absorbance and concentration over the tested range. The strong rejection of the linear model statistically warrants the exploration of a more complex model, such as one including a quadratic term ($c^2$).\n\nThe problem asks for the calculated $F$-statistic rounded to four significant figures.\n$F = 126.4375 \\approx 126.4$.",
