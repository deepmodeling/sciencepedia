This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and translate the given information into the language of probability theory.\nLet $M$ be the event that the patient has a Myocardial Infarction.\nLet $M^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the patient does not have a Myocardial Infarction.\nLet $T$ be the event that the hs-cTnT test result is positive.\nLet $T^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test probability of MI is given as $0.20$. This is the prior probability of the event $M$.\n    $$ P(M) = 0.20 $$\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay is $0.95$.

It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^c|M^c)$, because for a given condition (disease absence), the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$ P(T|M^c) + P(T^c|M^c) = 1 $$\nTherefore,\n$$ P(T|M^c) = 1 - P(T^c|M^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|M)P(M) + P(T|M^c)P(M^c) $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ P(T) = (0.95)(0.20) + (0.10)(0.80) $$\n$$ P(T) = 0.19 + 0.08 $$\n$$ P(T) = 0.27 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated values back into Bayes' theorem to find $P(M|T)$:\n$$ P(M|T) = \\frac{P(T|M) P(M)}{P(T)} $$\nThe numerator is the first term in our calculation for $P(T)$, which is $P(T \\cap M) = (0.95)(0.20) = 0.19$.\n$$ P(M|T) = \\frac{0.19}{0.27} $$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$ P(M|T) = \\frac{19}{27} \\approx 0.7037037... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(M|T) \\approx 0.7037 $$\nThis is the post-test probability of MI given a positive hs-cTnT result.",
