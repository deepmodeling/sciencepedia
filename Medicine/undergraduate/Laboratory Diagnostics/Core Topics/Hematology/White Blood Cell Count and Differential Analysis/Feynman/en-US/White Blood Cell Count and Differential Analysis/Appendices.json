            "problem": "A clinical laboratory reports the white blood cell count (WBC) and the leukocyte differential for an adult patient. The white blood cell count is $WBC = 4.2 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. The differential counts indicate a fraction $0.42$ for segmented neutrophils and $0.06$ for band forms. In clinical risk stratification, the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is defined as the concentration of cells in the neutrophil lineage, which includes segmented neutrophils and band forms. The leukocyte differential fractions are proportions of the total white blood cell count. Widely accepted clinical categories for neutropenia severity, based on ANC, are:\n- Normal: $ANC \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$,\n- Mild neutropenia: $1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\leq ANC < 1.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$,\n- Moderate neutropenia: $0.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\leq ANC < 1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$,\n- Severe neutropenia: $ANC < 0.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental principle that the absolute count of a leukocyte subtype equals the total white blood cell count multiplied by the subtype’s fraction, and that band forms are part of the neutrophil lineage, compute the Absolute Neutrophil Count and classify neutropenia severity. To make the classification a calculation-compatible output, encode severity with the numeric code $0$ for Normal, $1$ for Mild, $2$ for Moderate, and $3$ for Severe.\n\nExpress the ANC in units of $10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and round the ANC to three significant figures. Provide your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{ANC value} & \\text{severity code}\\end{pmatrix}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and the classification of neutropenia severity based on a given total white blood cell (WBC) count and leukocyte differential fractions.\n\nThe fundamental principle provided is that the absolute count of a specific leukocyte subtype is the product of the total WBC count and the fraction of that subtype. Let $WBC$ be the total white blood cell count. Let $f_i$ be the fraction of a specific leukocyte subtype $i$. The absolute count of this subtype, $C_i$, is given by:\n$$C_i = WBC \\times f_i$$\n\nThe problem defines the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) as the total concentration of cells in the neutrophil lineage, which includes segmented neutrophils and band forms. Let $f_{seg}$ be the fraction of segmented neutrophils and $f_{band}$ be the fraction of band forms. The total fraction of neutrophils, $f_{ANC}$, is the sum of these two fractions:\n$$f_{ANC} = f_{seg} + f_{band}$$\n\nThe ANC is then calculated by multiplying the total WBC count by this total neutrophil fraction:\n$$ANC = WBC \\times f_{ANC} = WBC \\times (f_{seg} + f_{band})$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Total white blood cell count: $WBC = 4.2 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- Fraction of segmented neutrophils: $f_{seg} = 0.42$\n- Fraction of band forms: $f_{band} = 0.06$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total fraction of neutrophils, $f_{ANC}$:\n$$f_{ANC} = 0.42 + 0.06 = 0.48$$\nThis fraction is a dimensionless quantity representing the proportion of neutrophils out of the total white blood cells.\n\nNext, we calculate the ANC using the given WBC count:\n$$ANC = (4.2 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times 0.48$$\nPerforming the multiplication of the coefficients:\n$$4.2 \\times 0.48 = 2.016$$\nTherefore, the ANC is:\n$$ANC = 2.016 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the ANC value for the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $2.016$. The first three significant figures are $2$, $0$, and $1$. The fourth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third digit.\n$$ANC_{rounded} \\approx 2.02 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the ANC value to be expressed in units of $10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Thus, the numerical value for the final answer is $2.02$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to classify the neutropenia severity. The classification is based on the unrounded ANC value to maintain precision for the comparison. The categories are:\n- Normal: $ANC \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- Mild neutropenia: $1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\leq ANC < 1.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- Moderate neutropenia: $0.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\leq ANC < 1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- Severe neutropenia: $ANC < 0.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nOur calculated ANC is $2.016 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. We compare this value to the thresholds:\n$$2.016 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThis comparison is true. Therefore, the patient's ANC falls into the \"Normal\" category.\n\nThe problem requires encoding the severity level with a numeric code:\n- Normal: $0$\n- Mild: $1$\n- Moderate: $2$\n- Severe: $3$\n\nSince the classification is Normal, the severity code is $0$.\n\nThe final answer must be presented as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{ANC value} & \\text{severity code}\\end{pmatrix}$. The ANC value is the rounded numerical part, $2.02$, and the severity code is $0$. The resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}2.02 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "Automated laboratory instruments are highly efficient, but their results require critical evaluation, as they can be affected by analytical interferences. This exercise tackles a classic scenario where nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) artificially inflate the white blood cell count, a common challenge in hematology . Mastering this correction is essential for ensuring data accuracy before calculating derivative parameters like the ANC, reinforcing the principle that sound clinical decisions depend on clean data.",

            "problem": "An automated hematology analyzer reports a white blood cell (WBC) concentration of $WBC_{\\mathrm{reported}} = 18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ on a peripheral blood sample that is flagged for nucleated red blood cells (NRBC). A manual smear confirms the presence of NRBC at a ratio of $25$ NRBC per $100$ leukocytes, recorded as $25/100$ WBC. A manual differential performed on the same smear (counting only leukocytes and excluding NRBC from the leukocyte differential) yields the following leukocyte fractions: segmented neutrophils $0.62$, band neutrophils $0.08$, lymphocytes $0.20$, monocytes $0.06$, eosinophils $0.03$, and basophils $0.01$. \n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to laboratory diagnostics—namely, that automated analyzers count nucleated cellular events per unit volume and that the reported WBC can be inflated by NRBC because both are nucleated—derive the corrected WBC concentration that reflects only leukocytes. Then use the corrected WBC to obtain the corrected absolute neutrophil count (ANC), taking neutrophils to be the sum of segmented and band forms. In your reasoning, explain qualitatively whether using the uncorrected $WBC_{\\mathrm{reported}}$ would overestimate or underestimate the ANC and quantify the magnitude of any difference.\n\nExpress the final ANC in $10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ and round your final answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The fundamental base in this setting is that an automated hematology analyzer computes a concentration by counting nucleated cellular events in a known sample volume and normalizing to report a concentration of nucleated cells per unit volume. If nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) are present, the analyzer may include them among nucleated events, inflating the reported white blood cell (WBC) concentration because NRBC are counted alongside true leukocytes. A manual smear provides the NRBC burden as a ratio of NRBC per $100$ leukocytes, which can be used to determine the fraction of nucleated events that are true leukocytes.\n\nLet $W$ denote the reported WBC concentration, $x$ denote the NRBC per $100$ leukocytes, and $W_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ denote the corrected WBC concentration. The manual smear ratio $x$ means that for every $100$ leukocytes, there are $x$ NRBC, so the analyzer’s nucleated-event pool per $100$ leukocytes comprises $100 + x$ nucleated cells. The fraction of nucleated events that are true leukocytes is therefore\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{leukocyte}} = \\frac{100}{100 + x}.\n$$\nApplying this fraction to the reported concentration yields the corrected leukocyte concentration\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{corr}} = W \\times \\frac{100}{100 + x}.\n$$\n\nWith the provided data, $W = 18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ and $x = 25$.

Neutrophils are the sum of segmented and band forms. Let $p_{\\mathrm{seg}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{band}}$ denote the fractions of segmented and band neutrophils, respectively. Then the neutrophil fraction is\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{neut}} = p_{\\mathrm{seg}} + p_{\\mathrm{band}}.\n$$\nWith $p_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 0.62$ and $p_{\\mathrm{band}} = 0.08$, we have\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{neut}} = 0.62 + 0.08 = 0.70.\n$$\nThus, the corrected ANC is\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC}_{\\mathrm{corr}} = W_{\\mathrm{corr}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{neut}} = \\left(14.4 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}\\right) \\times 0.70 = 10.08 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $10.08 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ remains $10.08 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nImpact of using $WBC_{\\mathrm{reported}}$ without NRBC correction: If one used the uncorrected $W$, the ANC calculation would be\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC}_{\\mathrm{uncorr}} = W \\times p_{\\mathrm{neut}} = \\left(18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}\\right) \\times 0.70 = 12.6 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}.\n$$\nComparing, the uncorrected approach overestimates the ANC because it includes NRBC-driven inflation of the WBC.

Neutrophils exist in two main intravascular pools: the circulating pool (measured by CBC) and the marginated pool (cells loosely adherent to the vascular endothelium). Catecholamines, such as epinephrine, cause a rapid shift of cells from the marginated pool to the circulating pool. The assumption that these two pools are roughly equal in size is a standard approximation in hematology. The constraints (no change in bone marrow release, tissue egress, or other cell lines) are appropriate for isolating the effect of demargination.
