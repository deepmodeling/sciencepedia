The context is realistic for a clinical laboratory setting. The provided values for hand surface area, film thickness, and density are plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the volume. The instruction to find the volume, given area and thickness, is unambiguous. The inclusion of density is extraneous to the calculation of volume but does not invalidate the problem; it serves to test the solver's understanding of which physical quantities are relevant. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe volume, $V$, of a uniform film is given by the product of its surface area, $A$, and its thickness, $t$.\n$$V = A \\times t$$\nThe given surface area is $A = 800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and the thickness is $t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. To calculate the volume, the units of area and thickness must be consistent. The final answer for the volume is required in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$).

It is therefore most direct to express all length dimensions in centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$).\n\nThe thickness is given in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). We convert this to centimeters using the relationship $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nNow, we can calculate the volume in cubic centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$).\n$$V = (800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (0.002\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$V = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, the volume in milliliters is:\n$$V = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem states that the answer should be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $1.6$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$V = 1.60\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe density of the ABHR, given as $\\rho = 0.85\\,\\mathrm{g/mL}$, is not required for the calculation of the volume.

Consider a doffing sequence in which gloves are removed before detaching the gown sleeves, so the technician’s bare hands will subsequently contact the outer gown sleeves. Model contamination transfer per contact as an independent Bernoulli trial. Assume the following well-tested facts and operational parameters:\n\n- The outer glove surface transfers contamination to any surface it touches with probability $p_{g} = 0.10$ per distinct contact.\n- The outer gown sleeve surface transfers contamination to skin with probability $p_{s} = 0.05$ per distinct contact.\n- During glove removal, the second glove is removed using one bare hand that must make $n_{g} = 2$ distinct contacts with the outer glove surface.\n- During gown sleeve detachment, each bare hand makes $n_{s} = 3$ distinct contacts with the outer sleeve surface.\n- All contacts are independent across time and hands.\n- Immediately after doffing, hand hygiene is performed using an alcohol-based hand rub that inactivates a proportion $r = 0.90$ of contaminations present on skin at that moment, leaving a residual contamination probability factor of $(1 - r)$ for any contamination that occurred.\n\nTreat the technician’s two hands as separate risk entities.

Extract Givens:**\n- Probability of contamination from glove to a surface per contact: $p_{g} = 0.10$.\n- Probability of contamination from gown sleeve to skin per contact: $p_{s} = 0.05$.\n- Number of contacts of one bare hand with the second glove's outer surface: $n_{g} = 2$.\n- Number of contacts of each bare hand with its respective outer gown sleeve surface: $n_{s} = 3$.\n- Proportion of contamination inactivated by hand hygiene: $r = 0.90$.\n- All contacts are independent events.\n- The two hands are independent risk entities.\n- The goal is to find the probability $P$ that at least one hand remains contaminated after hygiene.\n\n**2. Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem uses a standard probabilistic model (Bernoulli trials) to represent contamination events, which is a methodologically sound approach in risk assessment and epidemiology. The parameters and scenario are consistent with real-world concerns in laboratory safety.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is mathematically well-defined. All necessary parameters ($p_{g}$, $p_{s}$, $n_{g}$, $n_{s}$, $r$) are provided, and the objective is clearly stated. The assumptions of independence allow for a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is quantitative and precise, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\nThe core task is to calculate the probability of the union of two events: Hand 1 being contaminated post-hygiene, or Hand 2 being contaminated post-hygiene. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event—that both hands are clean after hygiene—and subtract this from $1$.\n\nLet $P$ be the overall probability that at least one hand remains contaminated. Let $E_1$ be the event that Hand 1 is clean after hand hygiene, and $E_2$ be the event that Hand 2 is clean after hand hygiene. The problem states that the hands are to be treated as separate, independent risk entities. Thus, the events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent.\n\nThe probability that both hands are clean is $P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = P(E_1)P(E_2)$.\nThe desired probability $P$ is then:\n$$P = 1 - P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = 1 - P(E_1)P(E_2)$$\n\nWe must now determine $P(E_1)$ and $P(E_2)$. Let's analyze the contamination pathway for each hand. Let Hand 1 be the hand that first becomes bare and is used to remove the second glove. Let Hand 2 be the other hand.\n\n**Contamination of Hand 1 ($H_1$) before hygiene:**\nHand 1 is exposed to two sources of contamination: the outer surface of the second glove and the outer surface of its own gown sleeve.\nThe probability of a single contact with the glove *not* causing contamination is $(1 - p_{g})$. Since there are $n_{g}$ independent contacts, the probability of no contamination from the glove is $(1 - p_{g})^{n_{g}}$.\nSimilarly, the probability of no contamination from the sleeve after $n_{s}$ contacts is $(1 - p_{s})^{n_{s}}$.\nThe event \"Hand 1 is not contaminated before hygiene\" ($\\neg C_{1,pre}$) requires no contamination from *either* source. Due to independence, the probability is:\n$$P(\\neg C_{1,pre}) = (1 - p_{g})^{n_{g}} (1 - p_{s})^{n_{s}}$$\nThe probability that Hand 1 *is* contaminated before hygiene ($C_{1,pre}$) is:\n$$P(C_{1,pre}) = 1 - P(\\neg C_{1,pre}) = 1 - (1 - p_{g})^{n_{g}} (1 - p_{s})^{n_{s}}$$\n\n**Contamination of Hand 2 ($H_2$) before hygiene:**\nHand 2 is only exposed to its own gown sleeve.\nThe probability that Hand 2 is not contaminated before hygiene ($\\neg C_{2,pre}$) after $n_{s}$ contacts is:\n$$P(\\neg C_{2,pre}) = (1 - p_{s})^{n_{s}}$$\nThe probability that Hand 2 *is* contaminated before hygiene ($C_{2,pre}$) is:\n$$P(C_{2,pre}) = 1 - P(\\neg C_{2,pre}) = 1 - (1 - p_{s})^{n_{s}}$$\n\n**Effect of Hand Hygiene:**\nHand hygiene inactivates a proportion $r$ of contamination. If a hand is contaminated (event $C_{i,pre}$), the probability it remains contaminated post-hygiene (event $C_{i,post}$) is reduced by this factor. The problem phrasing implies that the probability of *remaining* contaminated, given initial contamination, is $(1-r)$.\n$$P(C_{i,post} | C_{i,pre}) = 1 - r$$\nIf a hand is not contaminated, it cannot become contaminated by hygiene, so $P(C_{i,post} | \\neg C_{i,pre}) = 0$.\nThe overall probability of a hand being contaminated post-hygiene is:\n$$P(C_{i,post}) = P(C_{i,post} | C_{i,pre})P(C_{i,pre}) + P(C_{i,post} | \\neg C_{i,pre})P(\\neg C_{i,pre})$$\n$$P(C_{i,post}) = (1-r)P(C_{i,pre}) + 0 \\cdot P(\\neg C_{i,pre}) = (1-r)P(C_{i,pre})$$\nThe probability that hand $i$ is clean post-hygiene, $P(E_i)$, is $1 - P(C_{i,post})$:\n$$P(E_i) = 1 - (1-r)P(C_{i,pre})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P(C_{1,pre})$ and $P(C_{2,pre})$:\n$$P(E_1) = 1 - (1-r) \\left[ 1 - (1-p_{g})^{n_{g}}(1-p_{s})^{n_{s}} \\right]$$\n$$P(E_2) = 1 - (1-r) \\left[ 1 - (1-p_{s})^{n_{s}} \\right]$$\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSubstitute the given values into these expressions.\n- $p_{g} = 0.10 \\implies 1-p_{g} = 0.90$\n- $p_{s} = 0.05 \\implies 1-p_{s} = 0.95$\n- $n_{g} = 2$\n- $n_{s} = 3$\n- $r = 0.90 \\implies 1-r = 0.10$\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities of no contamination before hygiene:\n$$P(\\neg C_{1,pre}) = (0.90)^2 (0.95)^3 = (0.81)(0.857375) = 0.69447375$$\n$$P(\\neg C_{2,pre}) = (0.95)^3 = 0.857375$$\n\nNext, calculate the probabilities of contamination before hygiene:\n$$P(C_{1,pre}) = 1 - 0.69447375 = 0.30552625$$\n$$P(C_{2,pre}) = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625$$\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities of contamination *after* hygiene:\n$$P(C_{1,post}) = (1-r)P(C_{1,pre}) = 0.10 \\times 0.30552625 = 0.030552625$$\n$$P(C_{2,post}) = (1-r)P(C_{2,pre}) = 0.10 \\times 0.142625 = 0.0142625$$\n\nThe probabilities that each hand is clean after hygiene are:\n$$P(E_1) = 1 - P(C_{1,post}) = 1 - 0.030552625 = 0.969447375$$\n$$P(E_2) = 1 - P(C_{2,post}) = 1 - 0.0142625 = 0.9857375$$\n\nFinally, calculate the desired probability $P$:\n$$P = 1 - P(E_1)P(E_2)$$\n$$P = 1 - (0.969447375)(0.9857375)$$\n$$P = 1 - 0.95562061640625$$\n$$P = 0.04437938359375$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 0.0444$$",

It presents a simplified but coherent probabilistic model for assessing contamination risk, a common practice in epidemiology and occupational health. The parameters are physically plausible probabilities and fractions. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous objective. The underlying principles are based on standard probability theory (Bernoulli trials, independence of events).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet the three items be gloves ($g$), gown ($o$), and face protection ($f$). The first step is to calculate the probability, $s_i$, that removing item $i$ contaminates the hands. This is the joint probability that the item's surface is contaminated ($p_i$) and that a transfer occurs during contact ($\\tau_i$). Due to independence, this is $s_i = p_i \\tau_i$.\n\nFor gloves:\n$s_g = p_{\\text{gloves}} \\tau_{\\text{gloves}} = 0.60 \\times 0.15 = 0.09$\n\nFor the gown:\n$s_o = p_{\\text{gown}} \\tau_{\\text{gown}} = 0.35 \\times 0.08 = 0.028$\n\nFor face protection:\n$s_f = p_{\\text{face}} \\tau_{\\text{face}} = 0.20 \\times 0.05 = 0.01$\n\nLet a doffing sequence be denoted by an ordered triplet $(i, j, k)$, where $i$ is removed first, $j$ second, and $k$ third. ABHR is performed between the removal of $j$ and $k$. We need to find the final probability of hand contamination, $P_{\\text{final}}$.\n\nLet $C_{pre}$ be the event that hands are contaminated before the ABHR step. This occurs if contamination happens during the removal of item $i$ or item $j$. The probability of not being contaminated by item $i$ is $(1-s_i)$, and by item $j$ is $(1-s_j)$. Due to independence, the probability of being not contaminated by either is $(1-s_i)(1-s_j)$. Therefore, the probability of being contaminated is:\n$P(C_{pre}) = 1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)$\n\nAfter the ABHR is performed, any existing contamination on the hands is reduced. The problem states that the contamination is multiplied by the residual fraction $r$. In this probabilistic model, this means that if the hands are contaminated, the contamination persists with probability $r$. Let $C_{survive}$ be the event that contamination from the first two steps survives the ABHR. The probability of this event is:\n$P(C_{survive}) = P(C_{pre}) \\times r = r [1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$\n\nFinally, item $k$ is removed, which can contaminate the hands with probability $s_k$. The final hand contamination event, $C_{\\text{final}}$, occurs if the pre-ABHR contamination survives ($C_{survive}$) OR if contamination occurs from the final item $k$. These two events are independent. Thus, the probability of $C_{\\text{final}}$ is:\n$P(C_{\\text{final}}) = P(C_{survive} \\cup C_k) = P(C_{survive}) + P(C_k) - P(C_{survive})P(C_k)$\n$P(C_{\\text{final}}) = P(C_{survive}) + s_k - P(C_{survive})s_k = s_k + P(C_{survive})(1-s_k)$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(C_{survive})$:\n$P_{\\text{final}}(i, j, k) = s_k + r(1-s_k)[1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum of $P_{\\text{final}}$ over all $3! = 6$ permutations of $(g, o, f)$. Since the order of the first two items $(i, j)$ does not change the value of $[1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$, we only need to test the three possible choices for the final item, $k$.\n\nThe contamination probabilities are $s_g = 0.09$, $s_o = 0.028$, and $s_f = 0.01$.
