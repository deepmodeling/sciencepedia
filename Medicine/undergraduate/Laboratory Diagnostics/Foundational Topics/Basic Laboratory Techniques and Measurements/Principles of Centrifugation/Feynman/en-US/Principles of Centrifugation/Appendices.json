            "solution": "The first step is to derive the equation for the time required for a particle to sediment from a minimum radius, $r_{\\min}$, to a maximum radius, $r_{\\max}$, in a centrifuge operating at a constant angular velocity, $\\omega$.\n\nA particle suspended in a fluid within a centrifuge rotor experiences a centrifugal force, $F_c$, directed radially outward, and an opposing drag force, $F_d$, due to its motion through the viscous solvent. The buoyant force is also present and is accounted for in the definition of the sedimentation coefficient.\n\nThe centrifugal force is given by:\n$$F_c = m_b \\omega^2 r$$\nwhere $m_b$ is the buoyant mass of the particle (its actual mass minus the mass of the displaced fluid), $\\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $r$ is the radial position of the particle.\n\nThe drag force is given by Stokes' law:\n$$F_d = f v = f \\frac{dr}{dt}$$\nwhere $f$ is the frictional coefficient (dependent on particle shape and solvent viscosity) and $v = dr/dt$ is the instantaneous radial velocity of the particle.\n\nUnder the assumption that the particle quickly reaches a terminal velocity where these forces balance, we have $F_c = F_d$:\n$$m_b \\omega^2 r = f \\frac{dr}{dt}$$\nThe sedimentation coefficient, $s$, is a characteristic property of a particle in a given solvent. It is defined as the sedimentation velocity per unit of applied centrifugal acceleration:\n$$s = \\frac{v}{\\omega^2 r} = \\frac{dr/dt}{\\omega^2 r}$$\nFrom the force balance equation, we can rearrange to find $v = (m_b/f)\\omega^2 r$. Comparing this with the definition of $s$, we see that $s = m_b/f$. This confirms that $s$ depends only on the properties of the particle and the solvent (which are constant in this problem), not on the centrifuge operating conditions.\n\nTo find the time required to sediment from $r_{\\min}$ to $r_{\\max}$, we rearrange the equation for $s$ to separate variables:\n$$s \\omega^2 dt = \\frac{dr}{r}$$\nWe can now integrate this expression. The time, $t$, runs from $0$ to the total pelleting time, $T$. The radius, $r$, runs from the top of the sample, $r_{\\min}$, to the bottom, $r_{\\max}$. Since $\\omega$ and $s$ are constant throughout the run:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} s \\omega^2 dt = \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} \\frac{dr}{r}$$\n$$s \\omega^2 \\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} \\frac{1}{r} dr$$\n$$s \\omega^2 [t]_{0}^{T} = [\\ln(r)]_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}}$$\n$$s \\omega^2 (T - 0) = \\ln(r_{\\max}) - \\ln(r_{\\min})$$\n$$s \\omega^2 T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max}}{r_{\\min}}\\right)$$\nSolving for the time $T$, we obtain the derived equation:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{s \\omega^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max}}{r_{\\min}}\\right)$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNow, we apply this equation to the two different centrifuge runs. The problem states that the analyte and solvent conditions are identical, so the sedimentation coefficient, $s$, is the same in both runs. The condition of an \"equivalent pelleting endpoint\" means that a particle starting at $r_{\\min}$ fully traverses the sample to $r_{\\max}$ in the given time for each respective run.\n\nFor run A:\n$$t_A = \\frac{1}{s \\omega_A^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,A}}{r_{\\min,A}}\\right)$$\nFor run B:\n$$t_B = \\frac{1}{s \\omega_B^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,B}}{r_{\\min,B}}\\right)$$\nSince $s$ is the constant linking the two experiments, we can solve for $s$ in both equations:\n$$s = \\frac{1}{t_A \\omega_A^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,A}}{r_{\\min,A}}\\right)$$\n$$s = \\frac{1}{t_B \\omega_B^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,B}}{r_{\\min,B}}\\right)$$\nSetting these two expressions for $s$ equal to each other gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{t_A \\omega_A^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,A}}{r_{\\min,A}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{t_B \\omega_B^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,B}}{r_{\\min,B}}\\right)$$\nWe need to solve for the unknown time, $t_B$:\n$$t_B = t_A \\frac{\\omega_A^2}{\\omega_B^2} \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,B}}{r_{\\min,B}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,A}}{r_{\\min,A}}\\right)}$$\nThe angular velocity $\\omega$ is proportional to the speed in rpm ($\\omega = k \\times \\mathrm{rpm}$ where $k = 2\\pi/60$). Therefore, the ratio of the squares of the angular velocities is equal to the ratio of the squares of the rpm values:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_A^2}{\\omega_B^2} = \\frac{(k \\times \\mathrm{rpm}_A)^2}{(k \\times \\mathrm{rpm}_B)^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{rpm}_A}{\\mathrm{rpm}_B}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $t_B$:\n$$t_B = t_A \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{rpm}_A}{\\mathrm{rpm}_B}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,B}}{r_{\\min,B}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max,A}}{r_{\\min,A}}\\right)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this final expression:\n- $t_A = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n- $\\mathrm{rpm}_A = 15{,}000$\n- $\\mathrm{rpm}_B = 10{,}000$\n- $r_{\\min,A} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $r_{\\max,A} = 9.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $r_{\\min,B} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $r_{\\max,B} = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\n$$t_B = 30.0 \\left(\\frac{15000}{10000}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{20.0}{8.0}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{9.0}{5.0}\\right)}$$\n$$t_B = 30.0 \\left(1.5\\right)^2 \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{\\ln(1.8)}$$\n$$t_B = 30.0 \\times 2.25 \\times \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{\\ln(1.8)}$$\n$$t_B = 67.5 \\times \\frac{0.9162907...}{0.5877866...}$$\n$$t_B = 67.5 \\times 1.558880...$$\n$$t_B = 105.2244... \\,\\mathrm{min}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested by the problem statement:\n$$t_B \\approx 105.2\\,\\mathrm{min}$$",
