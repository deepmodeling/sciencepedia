This fundamental task requires more than just measuring volume and mass; it demands an understanding of reagent purity. This exercise will guide you through the process of calculating the necessary mass of a common laboratory chemical, potassium chloride, to create a standard of a specific concentration, accounting for the fact that the solid reagent is not 100% pure. Mastering this skill is essential for ensuring the traceability and accuracy of all subsequent measurements that rely on this standard .",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically sound, presenting a standard and practical scenario in analytical chemistry. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution without contradiction or ambiguity. The principles involved—amount-of-substance concentration, molar mass, and mass fraction (purity)—are fundamental to the International System of Units (SI) in chemistry.\n\nThe solution requires two calculations:\n1.  The mass ($m_{\\text{weighed}}$) of an impure solid ($\\mathrm{KCl}$) needed to prepare a calibration standard of a target concentration.\n2.  The actual concentration ($c_{\\text{actual}}$) that results from an operator error where the purity correction is neglected.\n\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of potassium chloride, $M_{\\mathrm{KCl}}$, using the provided standard atomic masses of potassium ($M_{\\mathrm{K}}$) and chlorine ($M_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$).\n$$M_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = M_{\\mathrm{K}} + M_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 39.0983\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 35.45\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} = 74.5483\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Weighed Mass**\nThe target is a solution with concentration $c_{target} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$ and volume $V = 250.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. We convert these to more convenient units for calculation:\n$c_{target} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}} = 0.0100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n$V = 250.0\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 0.2500\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe required amount of substance ($n_{target}$) of pure $\\mathrm{KCl}$ is given by the definition of concentration, $c = n/V$:\n$$n_{target} = c_{target} \\times V = (0.0100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}) \\times (0.2500\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 0.002500\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nFrom the amount of substance, we calculate the required mass of pure $\\mathrm{KCl}$, denoted as $m_{\\text{analyte}}$, using the relationship $n = m/M$:\n$$m_{\\text{analyte}} = n_{target} \\times M_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = (0.002500\\,\\mathrm{mol}) \\times (74.5483\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}) = 0.18637075\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThis mass of pure $\\mathrm{KCl}$ must be obtained from a solid reagent with a mass fraction purity of $f = 98.5\\% = 0.985$. The total mass to be weighed ($m_{\\text{weighed}}$) is found by rearranging the given purity formula, $m_{\\text{analyte}} = f \\cdot m_{\\text{weighed}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{weighed}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{analyte}}}{f} = \\frac{0.18637075\\,\\mathrm{g}}{0.985} = 0.18920888\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$m_{\\text{weighed}} \\approx 0.1892\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Actual Concentration from Error**\nThe second part of the problem describes a procedural error. The technician weighs a mass of the impure salt equal to the mass that would be correct for a $100\\%$ pure substance. This mass is $m_{\\text{ideal}} = m_{\\text{analyte}}$.\n$$m_{\\text{ideal}} = 0.18637075\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nSince the technician uses the impure salt, the actual mass of pure $\\mathrm{KCl}$ dissolved ($m_{\\text{actual, KCl}}$) is this weighed mass multiplied by the purity factor:\n$$m_{\\text{actual, KCl}} = m_{\\text{ideal}} \\times f = (0.18637075\\,\\mathrm{g}) \\times 0.985 = 0.18357518875\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe actual amount of substance ($n_{\\text{actual}}$) of $\\mathrm{KCl}$ in the solution is:\n$$n_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{actual, KCl}}}{M_{\\mathrm{KCl}}} = \\frac{0.18357518875\\,\\mathrm{g}}{74.5483\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} = 0.0024625\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nThis amount is dissolved in the specified volume $V = 0.2500\\,\\mathrm{L}$. The resulting actual concentration ($c_{\\text{actual}}$) is:\n$$c_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{actual}}}{V} = \\frac{0.0024625\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{0.2500\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.00985\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\nExpressed in the requested units of $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$:\n$$c_{\\text{actual}} = 0.00985\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,mol^{-1}} = 9.85\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\nAlternatively, this result can be derived more directly. The actual concentration $c_{\\text{actual}}$ is related to the target concentration $c_{target}$ by the purity factor $f$:\n$$c_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{actual}}}{V} = \\frac{n_{target} \\times f}{V} = \\frac{(c_{target} \\times V) \\times f}{V} = c_{target} \\times f$$\n$$c_{\\text{actual}} = (10.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}) \\times 0.985 = 9.85\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures as instructed gives:\n$$c_{\\text{actual}} \\approx 9.850\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\nThe final answers are the calculated mass in grams and the concentration in $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$, both rounded to four significant figures.",
