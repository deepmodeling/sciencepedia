To generate a microaerophilic atmosphere for bacterial growth, a small paraffin candle is ignited inside the jar and the lid is closed immediately.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of stoichiometry and the Ideal Gas Law, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe solution requires determining the final mole fraction of oxygen, $x_{\\mathrm{O_2},f}$, in a sealed jar after the combustion of a specified mass of paraffin. This involves calculating the initial composition of the gas, determining the change in moles of gaseous species due to the chemical reaction, and then calculating the final composition.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial number of moles of gas in the jar. According to the Ideal Gas Law, $PV = nRT$, the total initial number of moles of gas, $n_{i,tot}$, is:\n$$n_{i,tot} = \\frac{PV}{RT}$$\nGiven the initial pressure $P = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{atm}$, volume $V = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{L}$, temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the ideal gas constant $R = 0.082057\\,\\mathrm{L\\cdot atm \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, we have:\n$$n_{i,tot} = \\frac{(1.00\\,\\mathrm{atm})(2.50\\,\\mathrm{L})}{(0.082057\\,\\mathrm{L\\cdot atm \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 0.10219\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe initial moles of oxygen, $n_{\\mathrm{O_2}, i}$, and nitrogen, $n_{\\mathrm{N_2}, i}$, are found using their initial mole fractions, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2},i} = 0.21$ and $y_{\\mathrm{N_2},i} = 0.79$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{O_2}, i} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2},i} \\cdot n_{i,tot} = 0.21 \\cdot n_{i,tot} \\approx 0.21 \\cdot 0.10219\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\approx 0.02146\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{N_2}, i} = y_{\\mathrm{N_2},i} \\cdot n_{i,tot} = 0.79 \\cdot n_{i,tot} \\approx 0.79 \\cdot 0.10219\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\approx 0.08073\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nNext, we establish the stoichiometry of the complete combustion of paraffin, which is approximated as $\\mathrm{C_{25}H_{52}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the dissolved oxygen concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, in a liquid medium and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The derivation is based on two foundational principles of physical chemistry: Dalton's law of partial pressures and Henry's law.\n\nFirst, we apply Dalton's law to the gas phase in the chamber. The total pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the partial pressures of all gaseous components. The problem states that the headspace is saturated with water vapor at the incubation temperature of $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of water vapor, $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, is equal to the given saturated water vapor pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}$.

The problem gives the mole fraction of oxygen in the dry gas as $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. The partial pressure of a component in an ideal gas mixture is the product of its mole fraction and the total pressure of the mixture it is part of. In this case, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is the mole fraction within the dry gas portion of the atmosphere. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{dry}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{\\mathrm{dry}}$ from Dalton's law, we find the partial pressure of oxygen in terms of the total chamber pressure and water vapor pressure:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (p_{\\mathrm{tot}} - p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}})$$\nFinally, we use Henry's law, which states that at equilibrium, the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in the phase above the liquid. The law is given by:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = k_H \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is the molar concentration of dissolved oxygen and $k_H$ is the Henry's law constant for oxygen at the specified temperature.\n\nBy substituting our derived expression for $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ into Henry's law, we obtain the requested general expression that relates the dissolved oxygen concentration to the given variables:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = k_H(37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) \\left[ y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (p_{\\mathrm{tot}} - p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}) \\right]$$\nWe now proceed with the numerical evaluation using the provided values:\n$p_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.000\\ \\mathrm{atm}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.047\\ \\mathrm{atm}$\n$y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.18$\n$k_H(37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) = 1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{atm}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial pressure of oxygen, $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.18 \\times (1.000\\ \\mathrm{atm} - 0.047\\ \\mathrm{atm}) = 0.18 \\times 0.953\\ \\mathrm{atm} = 0.17154\\ \\mathrm{atm}$$\nNext, we use this partial pressure in Henry's law to find the dissolved oxygen concentration in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = (1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{atm}^{-1}) \\times (0.17154\\ \\mathrm{atm})$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 2.05848 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the concentration to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.
