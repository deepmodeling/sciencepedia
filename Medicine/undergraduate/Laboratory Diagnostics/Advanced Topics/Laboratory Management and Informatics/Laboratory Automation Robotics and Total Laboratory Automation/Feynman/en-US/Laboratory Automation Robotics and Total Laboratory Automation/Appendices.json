            "problem": "A Total Laboratory Automation (TLA) core laboratory uses an automated swing-bucket centrifuge in its pre-analytical module to standardize serum separation before robotic aliquoting. The Standard Operating Procedure specifies a Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) of $2000\\,g$ at the sample meniscus for a fixed spin time. The rotor’s labeled radius to the sample meniscus is $r=10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. Assume gravitational acceleration is $g=9.80665\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$, the radius remains constant during the run, and aerodynamic and slip effects are negligible.\n\nStarting from fundamental relationships among centripetal acceleration, angular velocity, and rotation rate, derive the expression for the required rotation rate in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) to achieve the specified RCF at radius $r$. Then compute its numerical value. Next, quantify the actual RCF delivered if the centrifuge speed undershoots by $5\\%$ and runs at $0.95$ times the setpoint RPM. Round both the RPM and the undershoot RCF to four significant figures. Report the RPM in revolutions per minute (rev/min) and the RCF as a multiple of gravitational acceleration $g$ (dimensionless).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the centrifuge rotation rate in Revolutions Per Minute ($RPM$) to achieve a specified Relative Centrifugal Force ($RCF$), followed by numerical calculations for a specific scenario and an undershoot condition.\n\nThe first step is to establish the fundamental physical relationships. The centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, experienced by a sample at a radius $r$ rotating with an angular velocity $\\omega$ is given by:\n$$a_c = \\omega^2 r$$\nThe Relative Centrifugal Force ($RCF$) is defined as the ratio of the centripetal acceleration to the standard gravitational acceleration, $g$. It is a dimensionless quantity representing acceleration in multiples of $g$.\n$$RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g}$$\nBy substituting the expression for $a_c$ into the definition of $RCF$, we obtain:\n$$RCF = \\frac{\\omega^2 r}{g}$$\nThe problem requires the rotation rate in $RPM$, which we denote as $N$. The angular velocity $\\omega$ is typically in units of radians per second ($\\mathrm{rad/s}$). The conversion between $\\omega$ and $N$ is derived from the fact that one revolution is $2\\pi$ radians and one minute is $60$ seconds:\n$$N \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{rev}}{\\mathrm{min}}\\right] = \\omega \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{rad}}{\\mathrm{s}}\\right] \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{rev}}{2\\pi \\ \\mathrm{rad}} \\times \\frac{60 \\ \\mathrm{s}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{min}}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$N = \\omega \\frac{30}{\\pi}$$\nTo express $RCF$ in terms of $N$, we first rearrange the conversion formula for $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega = N \\frac{\\pi}{30}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\omega$ into the $RCF$ equation yields:\n$$RCF = \\frac{\\left(N \\frac{\\pi}{30}\\right)^2 r}{g} = \\frac{N^2 \\pi^2 r}{900 g}$$\nTo find the required rotation rate $N$ for a given $RCF$, we solve this equation for $N$:\n$$N^2 = \\frac{900 g \\cdot RCF}{\\pi^2 r}$$\n$$N = \\sqrt{\\frac{900 g \\cdot RCF}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\cdot RCF}{r}}$$\nThis is the required general expression for the rotation rate $N$ in $RPM$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $N$ for the specified conditions.\nThe given values are:\n- Specified $RCF = 2000$ (dimensionless)\n- Radius $r = 10 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Gravitational acceleration $g = 9.80665 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n\nIt is critical to use consistent SI units for the calculation. Substituting the values into the derived formula:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{(9.80665 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}) \\cdot 2000}{0.1 \\ \\mathrm{m}}}$$\nFirst, evaluate the expression inside the square root:\n$$\\frac{9.80665 \\times 2000}{0.1} = 196133 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$\nThen, calculate $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{196133} \\approx \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 442.86905 \\approx 9.549296 \\times 442.86905 \\approx 4229.08 \\ \\mathrm{RPM}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested gives the setpoint rotation rate:\n$$N_{setpoint} = 4229 \\ \\mathrm{RPM}$$\n\nFinally, we must quantify the actual $RCF$ delivered when the centrifuge speed undershoots by $5\\%$. This means the actual rotation rate, $N_{actual}$, is $95\\%$ of the setpoint rate:\n$$N_{actual} = 0.95 \\times N_{setpoint}$$\nFrom the equation $RCF = \\frac{N^2 \\pi^2 r}{900 g}$, we observe that for a constant radius $r$, $RCF$ is directly proportional to the square of the rotation rate $N$:\n$$RCF \\propto N^2$$\nWe can form a ratio to find the actual $RCF$, $RCF_{actual}$, relative to the specified $RCF$, $RCF_{spec}$:\n$$\\frac{RCF_{actual}}{RCF_{spec}} = \\frac{(N_{actual})^2}{(N_{setpoint})^2} = \\left(\\frac{N_{actual}}{N_{setpoint}}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the speed ratio:\n$$\\frac{RCF_{actual}}{RCF_{spec}} = (0.95)^2 = 0.9025$$\nNow, we calculate the $RCF_{actual}$ using the specified $RCF$ of $2000$:\n$$RCF_{actual} = RCF_{spec} \\times 0.9025 = 2000 \\times 0.9025 = 1805$$\nThe actual $RCF$ is $1805$ times the gravitational acceleration $g$. This value has four significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe two results are the required rotation rate ($4229 \\ \\mathrm{RPM}$) and the RCF during the undershoot ($1805\\,g$).",

            "problem": "A core line in a Total Laboratory Automation (TLA) system in a clinical chemistry laboratory consists of two parallel pre-analytical branches that merge into a single analyzer via a loader robot. The laboratory has sufficient demand such that the line is never starved of samples. Assume steady-state operation and negligible variability so that deterministic flow balance applies. Use conservation of flow and capacity constraints to derive the maximum steady-state sample throughput of the entire line.\n\nBranch $1$ has three serial stations: a decapper with capacity $900$ samples/h, a centrifuge with capacity $850$ samples/h, and an aliquoter with capacity $1000$ samples/h. Branch $2$ has three serial stations: a decapper with capacity $700$ samples/h, a centrifuge with capacity $1000$ samples/h, and an aliquoter with capacity $650$ samples/h. After the branches merge, a loader robot can feed the analyzer at up to $1300$ samples/h. The analyzer has a rated capacity of $1200$ samples/h, but in every $60$ minutes of operation, scheduled maintenance consumes $5$ minutes during which no samples are processed. Assume no blocking except as implied by these finite capacities.\n\nUsing first principles of steady-state flow balance, determine the maximum achievable steady-state throughput of the entire line and identify which single station is the system-level bottleneck that limits this throughput. Express the final throughput in samples per hour and round your answer to four significant figures. In your derivation, explicitly justify how each constraint is incorporated. Do not report the bottleneck station in the final numeric answer; only the throughput value is to be reported.",
            "solution": "The solution is derived by applying the principles of steady-state flow balance to determine the capacity of each subsystem and subsequently the entire system.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum throughput for each of the two parallel pre-analytical branches. For a set of stations in series, the maximum throughput is constrained by the station with the lowest capacity, which is the bottleneck of that series.\n\nLet $T_1$ be the maximum throughput of Branch $1$. It is the minimum of the capacities of its components:\n$$T_1 = \\min(C_{1,d}, C_{1,c}, C_{1,a})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_1 = \\min(900 \\text{ samples/h}, 850 \\text{ samples/h}, 1000 \\text{ samples/h}) = 850 \\text{ samples/h}$$\nThe bottleneck for Branch $1$ is its centrifuge.\n\nSimilarly, let $T_2$ be the maximum throughput of Branch $2$. It is the minimum of the capacities of its components:\n$$T_2 = \\min(C_{2,d}, C_{2,c}, C_{2,a})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_2 = \\min(700 \\text{ samples/h}, 1000 \\text{ samples/h}, 650 \\text{ samples/h}) = 650 \\text{ samples/h}$$\nThe bottleneck for Branch $2$ is its aliquoter.\n\nNext, we calculate the combined throughput of the two branches operating in parallel. Since the system is never starved of samples, the total flow from the parallel section is the sum of the maximum throughputs of the individual branches. Let this be $T_{parallel}$.\n$$T_{parallel} = T_1 + T_2 = 850 \\text{ samples/h} + 650 \\text{ samples/h} = 1500 \\text{ samples/h}$$\n\nNow, we must determine the effective capacity of the analyzer, which is subject to periodic maintenance. Its rated capacity is $C_{analyzer,rated} = 1200$ samples/h. However, it only operates for $60 - 5 = 55$ minutes in every $60$-minute cycle. The availability, $A$, of the analyzer is the fraction of time it is operational:\n$$A = \\frac{\\text{Uptime}}{\\text{Total Cycle Time}} = \\frac{55 \\text{ min}}{60 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nThe effective capacity, $C_{analyzer,eff}$, is the rated capacity multiplied by the availability:\n$$C_{analyzer,eff} = C_{analyzer,rated} \\times A = 1200 \\frac{\\text{samples}}{\\text{h}} \\times \\frac{11}{12} = 100 \\times 11 \\frac{\\text{samples}}{\\text{h}} = 1100 \\frac{\\text{samples}}{\\text{h}}$$\n\nFinally, the entire TLA line can be viewed as a single series of three stages:\n$1$. The parallel pre-analytical subsystem with a combined capacity of $T_{parallel} = 1500$ samples/h.\n$2$. The loader robot with a capacity of $C_{load} = 1300$ samples/h.\n$3$. The analyzer with an effective capacity of $C_{analyzer,eff} = 1100$ samples/h.\n\nThe maximum steady-state throughput of the entire system, $T_{sys}$, is limited by the bottleneck of this new series, which is the stage with the minimum capacity.\n$$T_{sys} = \\min(T_{parallel}, C_{load}, C_{analyzer,eff})$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$T_{sys} = \\min(1500 \\text{ samples/h}, 1300 \\text{ samples/h}, 1100 \\text{ samples/h}) = 1100 \\text{ samples/h}$$\n\nThe minimum capacity is that of the analyzer. Therefore, the analyzer is the system-level bottleneck, and it limits the overall throughput of the TLA line to $1100$ samples/h. The problem asks for this value rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1100$.",
