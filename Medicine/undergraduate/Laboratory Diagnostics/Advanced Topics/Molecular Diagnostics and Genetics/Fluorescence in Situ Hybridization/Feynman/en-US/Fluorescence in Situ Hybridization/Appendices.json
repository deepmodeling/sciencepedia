This exercise walks you through the fundamental calculation for assessing Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification in breast cancer, a cornerstone of modern molecular pathology. By calculating the HER2 to chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) ratio, you will practice the essential skill of normalizing target gene counts to a reference chromosome to control for aneuploidy and arrive at a clinically meaningful result.

For Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor $2$ (HER2) status assessment in breast cancer, a locus-specific identifier probe targets the HER2 gene, while a centromere enumeration probe targets chromosome $17$ (CEP17). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommend interpreting HER2 amplification by comparing averaged per-nucleus HER2 counts to averaged CEP17 counts across an adequate number of nuclei.\n\nStarting from the definitions that a FISH signal is an integer count per nucleus, that a sample mean is the arithmetic average of per-nucleus counts across $N$ nuclei, and that normalization to a chromosomal reference controls for aneuploidy, derive the expression that quantifies amplification by comparing HER2 counts to CEP17 counts using sample means across the same set of nuclei. Then, apply the ASCO/CAP cutoffs for HER2 amplification based on this derived quantity to the following dataset: mean HER2 signals per nucleus $= 6.2$ and mean CEP17 signals per nucleus $= 2.1$, measured across $60$ nuclei that meet quality control criteria. \n\nCompute the amplification quantity for this dataset and determine whether it meets the ASCO/CAP definition of amplification.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for quantifying HER2 gene amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data, followed by the calculation of this quantity for a given dataset and its interpretation according to ASCO/CAP guidelines.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- Target gene: Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor $2$ (HER2).\n- Chromosomal reference: Centromere of chromosome $17$ (CEP17).\n- A FISH signal is an integer count per nucleus.\n- Amplification is assessed by comparing averaged per-nucleus HER2 counts to averaged CEP17 counts.\n- A sample mean is the arithmetic average of per-nucleus counts across $N$ nuclei.\n- Normalization to a chromosomal reference controls for aneuploidy.\n- Dataset: mean HER2 signals per nucleus $= 6.2$.\n- Dataset: mean CEP17 signals per nucleus $= 2.1$.\n- Dataset: number of nuclei, $N = 60$.\n- The final result, the amplification quantity, must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular pathology and cytogenetics, specifically the clinical testing protocol for HER2 status in breast cancer. The terminology and context are accurate. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data to calculate the primary requested quantity. The requirement to apply ASCO/CAP cutoffs relies on standard, established clinical guidelines, which are considered fundamental principles in this context. The problem is objective and contains no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. Let $h_i$ denote the integer count of HER2 signals in nucleus $i$ and $c_i$ denote the integer count of CEP17 signals in nucleus $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\nAccording to the problem statement, the sample mean is the arithmetic average of per-nucleus counts. Thus, the mean HER2 signals per nucleus, which we denote as $\\bar{H}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{H} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i $$\nSimilarly, the mean CEP17 signals per nucleus, denoted as $\\bar{C}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i $$\nThe problem asks for an expression that quantifies amplification by \"comparing HER2 counts to CEP17 counts\" and using \"normalization to a chromosomal reference.\" This standardly implies calculating the ratio of the target gene's average copy number to the reference chromosome's average copy number. This ratio corrects for aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), as a proportional increase in both HER2 and chromosome $17$ would not represent true gene amplification. The amplification quantity, which we will call $R$, is therefore the ratio of the mean HER2 count to the mean CEP17 count.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\bar{H}}{\\bar{C}} $$\nThis expression represents the derived amplification quantity. It is a dimensionless number.\n\nNext, we apply this expression to the provided dataset. The given values are:\n- Mean HER2 signals per nucleus, $\\bar{H} = 6.2$\n- Mean CEP17 signals per nucleus, $\\bar{C} = 2.1$\n- Number of nuclei, $N = 60$ (Note: this value is extraneous for calculating the ratio from the provided means, but confirms the adequacy of the sample size as per guidelines).\n\nSubstituting the given means into the derived expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{6.2}{2.1} $$\nCalculating the value of this ratio:\n$$ R \\approx 2.9523809523... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $5$, and $2$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, so we round down.\n$$ R \\approx 2.952 $$\n\nFinally, we must determine if this result meets the ASCO/CAP definition of amplification. The 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2 testing in breast cancer define a sample as positive for HER2 amplification if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is $\\ge 2.0$, with additional criteria based on the average HER2 copy number per cell. In this case, the calculated ratio is $R \\approx 2.952$, which is greater than or equal to the cutoff of $2.0$. Furthermore, the average HER2 signals per nucleus is $6.2$, which is well above the threshold of $4.0$ used to resolve certain equivocal cases. Therefore, the sample is unequivocally defined as demonstrating HER2 amplification.\n\nThe final answer requested is the amplification quantity itself.",

            "problem": "Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is evaluated on two-dimensional images of three-dimensional tissue sections. In dual-probe assays, each intact diploid nucleus typically shows approximately two discrete signals for both the target locus and the internal control locus. However, section thickness and nuclear overlap can bias observed signal counts per segmented nucleus. Consider a field in which nuclei are approximately spherical with radius $R = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, centers are distributed in space as a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $\\lambda = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, and the section thickness is $t$ (either $t = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ or $t = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). Segmentation uses the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) channel to define nuclear masks, and any mask that contains overlapping nuclei in $z$ but contiguous in the projection may pool signals from multiple nuclei into a single counted “nucleus.”\n\nStart from the following fundamentals: spatial homogeneity of nuclear centers implies a Poisson distribution for counts in any fixed volume, and an overlap in the projection occurs when another nuclear center falls within a right circular cylinder of height $t$ and radius $R$ around a given nucleus. Assume a diploid copy number $c = 2$ for both probes in intact isolated nuclei, and that merged masks that contain exactly two nuclei typically show approximately $2c$ signals for each probe.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive the approximate probability $p(t)$ that a given DAPI nuclear mask contains signals from more than one nucleus (i.e., at least one additional nucleus within the cylinder of radius $R$ and height $t$), in terms of $\\lambda$, $R$, and $t$.\n2. Evaluate $p(t)$ for $t = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ using $R = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\lambda = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. Using these values, compute the expected mean signals per mask $E[s]$ for a locus with true $c = 2$, assuming masks are either isolated (probability $1 - p$; $c$ signals) or merged with exactly one neighbor (probability $p$; $2c$ signals).\n3. Based on your derivation and interpretation, select all statements below that correctly explain how section thickness and nuclear overlap produce apparent polysomy and that justify defensible exclusion criteria to avoid overcalling polysomy in FISH image analysis.\n\nOptions:\nA. Under a homogeneous Poisson packing model, the expected number of neighboring nuclear centers inside the cylinder of radius $R$ and height $t$ is proportional to $t$, so $p(t)$ increases with $t$; therefore thicker sections increase apparent polysomy by increasing merged masks. A defensible exclusion rule is to omit DAPI masks whose projected area exceeds $1.5\\,\\pi R^{2}$ or whose circularity is low (e.g., $C  0.8$), as these are consistent with merged nuclei.\n\nB. Thinner sections produce more apparent polysomy because truncation reduces the number of visible signals per nucleus and the missing signals are compensated by background bright spots, inflating counts; therefore one should prefer thinner sections to detect polysomy.\n\nC. In dual-probe assays, merged masks co-increase both target and control signals, so the target-to-control ratio tends to remain near $1$ despite elevated absolute counts. This pattern can flag overlap artifacts; an appropriate mitigation is to re-count using stricter selection of isolated, non-touching nuclei, guided by morphology in the DAPI channel.\n\nD. Because merged masks can yield high counts, any nucleus showing more than $4$ signals for the target probe should be excluded as artifactual, since biologically plausible polysomy cannot exceed $4$ copies without amplification.\n\nE. Masks at section edges or with unusually small projected DAPI area (e.g., $A  0.5\\,\\pi R^{2}$) should be excluded to avoid truncation bias, which primarily causes apparent monosomy rather than polysomy; this strengthens the inference that apparent polysomy in thicker sections is due to overlap rather than truncation.\n\nSelect all that apply.",

Using a Poisson point process to model the spatial distribution of cells/nuclei is a standard and valid approach in the absence of more detailed information about tissue structure. The geometric model for overlap (a cylinder) is a reasonable simplification used in such analyses.

The number of points, $N_V$, in a given volume $V$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = \\lambda V$. The probability of finding $k$ points in $V$ is $P(N_V = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda V)^k e^{-\\lambda V}}{k!}$.\n\nA given nuclear mask is considered to contain signals from more than one nucleus if the center of at least one other nucleus lies within a specified volume. This volume is a right circular cylinder of radius $R$ and height $t$, centered on the nucleus in question. The volume of this cylinder is:\n$$ V_{\\text{cyl}}(t) = (\\pi R^2) \\cdot t $$\n\nThe expected number of *other* nuclear centers within this volume, $\\mu(t)$, is:\n$$ \\mu(t) = \\lambda V_{\\text{cyl}}(t) = \\lambda \\pi R^2 t $$\n\nThe probability $p(t)$ that a mask contains signals from more than one nucleus is the probability that the number of other nuclear centers in this cylinder, $N_{\\text{cyl}}$, is one or more, i.e., $P(N_{\\text{cyl}} \\ge 1)$. It is most easily calculated using the complementary event, $P(N_{\\text{cyl}} = 0)$:\n$$ P(N_{\\text{cyl}} = 0) = \\frac{(\\mu(t))^0 e^{-\\mu(t)}}{0!} = e^{-\\mu(t)} $$\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one overlap is:\n$$ p(t) = P(N_{\\text{cyl}} \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N_{\\text{cyl}} = 0) = 1 - e^{-\\mu(t)} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu(t)$, we get:\n$$ p(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\pi R^2 t} $$\n\n**Task 2: Evaluate $p(t)$ and the expected mean signals per mask $E[s]$.**\n\nWe are given the parameters:\n-   $R = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\lambda = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $c = 2$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the constant part of the mean: $\\lambda \\pi R^2$.\n$$ \\lambda \\pi R^2 = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times \\pi \\times (5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 = 50\\pi \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 0.05\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\approx 0.1571\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n\nNow we evaluate $\\mu(t)$ and $p(t)$ for $t = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor $t = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\mu(3) = (0.05\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.15\\pi \\approx 0.4712 $$\n$$ p(3) = 1 - e^{-0.15\\pi} \\approx 1 - e^{-0.4712} \\approx 1 - 0.6243 = 0.3757 $$\n\nFor $t = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\mu(6) = (0.05\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.30\\pi \\approx 0.9425 $$\n$$ p(6) = 1 - e^{-0.30\\pi} \\approx 1 - e^{-0.9425} \\approx 1 - 0.3897 = 0.6103 $$\n\nNext, we compute the expected mean signals per mask, $E[s]$, using the simplified model provided:\n-   Signal count is $c=2$ with probability $1-p(t)$ (isolated nucleus).\n-   Signal count is $2c=4$ with probability $p(t)$ (merged with one neighbor).\n\nThe expected value is:\n$$ E[s](t) = c \\cdot (1 - p(t)) + 2c \\cdot p(t) = c + c \\cdot p(t) = c(1 + p(t)) $$\nWith $c = 2$:\n$$ E[s](t) = 2(1 + p(t)) $$\n\nFor $t = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ E[s](3) = 2(1 + 0.3757) = 2(1.3757) = 2.7514 $$\n\nFor $t = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ E[s](6) = 2(1 + 0.6103) = 2(1.6103) = 3.2206 $$\n\nThe calculations clearly show that as section thickness $t$ increases, the probability of overlap $p(t)$ increases, and consequently, the expected signal count per mask $E[s]$ also increases, rising above the true diploid value of $c=2$. This is a quantitative model of \"apparent polysomy\" due to an imaging artifact.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluate the provided statements.**\n\n**Option A**: \"Under a homogeneous Poisson packing model, the expected number of neighboring nuclear centers inside the cylinder of radius $R$ and height $t$ is proportional to $t$, so $p(t)$ increases with $t$; therefore thicker sections increase apparent polysomy by increasing merged masks. A defensible exclusion rule is to omit DAPI masks whose projected area exceeds $1.5\\,\\pi R^{2}$ or whose circularity is low (e.g., $C  0.8$), as these are consistent with merged nuclei.\"\n-   The first part of the statement is a direct consequence of our derivation. We found $\\mu(t) = (\\lambda \\pi R^2) t$, which is proportional to $t$. We also showed that $p(t) = 1-e^{-k t}$ (with $k0$) is a monotonically increasing function of $t$. This increased merging leads to higher average signal counts ($E[s]  c$), i.e., apparent polysomy. This part is correct.\n-   The second part proposes an exclusion rule based on morphometry. A merged projection of two nuclei will be larger and less circular than a single nucleus. An area threshold greater than the area of a single nucleus ($\\pi R^2$), such as $1.5\\pi R^2$, and a circularity threshold below the ideal value of $1$, are standard and defensible methods in image cytometry to filter out clumps. This part is also correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B**: \"Thinner sections produce more apparent polysomy because truncation reduces the number of visible signals per nucleus and the missing signals are compensated by background bright spots, inflating counts; therefore one should prefer thinner sections to detect polysomy.\"\n-   The premise \"Thinner sections produce more apparent polysomy\" contradicts our findings; thicker sections do.\n-   The reasoning is flawed. Truncation, which is more severe in thinner sections, causes signal *loss* (apparent monosomy), not signal gain (polysomy). The idea that background spots \"compensate\" for this is nonsensical in a properly conducted analysis.\n-   The conclusion to prefer thinner sections for detecting polysomy is incorrect. Thinner sections are generally avoided for polysomy scoring precisely because of the high rate of signal loss from truncation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C**: \"In dual-probe assays, merged masks co-increase both target and control signals, so the target-to-control ratio tends to remain near $1$ despite elevated absolute counts. This pattern can flag overlap artifacts; an appropriate mitigation is to re-count using stricter selection of isolated, non-touching nuclei, guided by morphology in the DAPI channel.\"\n-   In a diploid sample ($c=2$), an isolated nucleus has counts $(2,2)$ for (target, control), ratio $1$. A merged pair of diploid nuclei would have counts $(4,4)$, ratio $1$. The statement correctly identifies that absolute counts increase while the ratio remains stable.\n-   This pattern is a key diagnostic feature to distinguish overlap artifact from true gene amplification, where the target count would increase but the control would not (e.g., counts $(5,2)$, ratio $2.5$).\n-   The proposed mitigation—re-scoring with more stringent morphological criteria for selecting isolated nuclei—is the standard and correct procedural response to suspected overlap.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D**: \"Because merged masks can yield high counts, any nucleus showing more than $4$ signals for the target probe should be excluded as artifactual, since biologically plausible polysomy cannot exceed $4$ copies without amplification.\"\n-   The premise \"biologically plausible polysomy cannot exceed $4$ copies\" is factually incorrect. Aneuploidy can lead to various copy numbers, including $5$ (pentasomy), $6$ (hexasomy), etc., which are observed in many cancers. Tetraploidy (4 copies of every chromosome) also occurs.\n-   Furthermore, the model itself allows for overlaps of more than two nuclei. The probability of finding $k=2$ neighbors in the cylinder for $t=6\\mu m$ is $P(N_{\\text{cyl}}=2) = \\frac{\\mu(6)^2 e^{-\\mu(6)}}{2!} \\approx \\frac{(0.9425)^2(0.3897)}{2} \\approx 0.17$. An overlap of three nuclei, leading to $3c=6$ signals, is not a negligible event in this model.\n-   Therefore, setting a rigid cutoff at $4$ signals would improperly discard both real biological events and plausible artifacts from triple overlaps.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E**: \"Masks at section edges or with unusually small projected DAPI area (e.g., $A  0.5\\,\\pi R^{2}$) should be excluded to avoid truncation bias, which primarily causes apparent monosomy rather than polysomy; this strengthens the inference that apparent polysomy in thicker sections is due to overlap rather than truncation.\"\n-   Nuclei cut at the top or bottom of a section (truncated nuclei) will have a smaller volume within the section and a smaller projected area. Excluding them based on small area is a standard method to reduce truncation bias. This part is correct.\n-   Truncation leads to loss of nuclear volume and thus potential loss of signals. This results in undercounting (e.g., scoring $1$ signal instead of $2$), which is apparent monosomy. It does not cause overcounting (polysomy). This part is correct.\n-   The final conclusion is logical. Since the two main artifacts are truncation (causing undercounting) and overlap (causing overcounting), the observation of apparent polysomy strongly points to overlap as the cause. This is particularly true since apparent polysomy is shown to worsen in ticker sections, whereas truncation is worse in thinner sections.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal summary: Options A, C, and E are correct statements that align with the provided model, its mathematical consequences, and established principles of quantitative pathology.",
