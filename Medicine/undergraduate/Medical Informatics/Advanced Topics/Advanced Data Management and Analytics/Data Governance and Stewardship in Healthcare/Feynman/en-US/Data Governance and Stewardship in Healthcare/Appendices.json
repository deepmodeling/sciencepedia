            "introduction": "Effective data governance moves beyond abstract principles to establish measurable standards for data quality. One of the most fundamental dimensions of data quality is completeness, which ensures that essential data is not missing. In a healthcare setting, the absence of a critical lab value can have direct consequences for patient care, making this metric particularly important. This practice asks you to apply a precise, policy-based definition to calculate the completeness rate for a key clinical measurement, a foundational skill for any data steward .",

            "problem": "A tertiary academic medical center has adopted a data governance policy that treats hemoglobin measurement within the first day of admission as a mandated clinical data element for inpatient episodes. Under the completeness dimension of data quality, the governing definition specifies that completeness for a mandated data element is the proportion of eligible inpatient episodes for which at least one valid value is captured within the required timeframe, where episodes count in the numerator only if there is at least one valid value recorded within the timeframe and duplicates or values recorded after the timeframe do not increase the numerator nor change the denominator. During Quarter $2$ of year $2025$, there were $10{,}000$ inpatient admissions that met eligibility criteria for this measure. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) shows that $8{,}000$ of these eligible admissions have at least one hemoglobin laboratory result timestamped no later than $24$ hours after the admission time. All remaining eligible admissions either have no hemoglobin result or have only hemoglobin results recorded after $24$ hours. Using the fundamental definition of completeness described above as a proportion of eligible episodes with a valid within-timeframe value, compute the hemoglobin completeness rate for this period. Express your final answer as a decimal number, not with a percentage sign, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of a data quality metric, specifically the completeness rate for hemoglobin measurements in a hospital setting. The problem statement provides a precise definition of this metric.\n\nThe completeness rate, denoted here as $C$, is defined as the proportion of eligible inpatient episodes for which at least one valid value is captured within the required timeframe. This can be expressed as a ratio:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\text{Number of eligible episodes with at least one valid, timely value}}{\\text{Total number of eligible episodes}}\n$$\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of eligible inpatient episodes, which forms the denominator of the ratio.\nLet $N_{complete}$ be the number of eligible episodes that meet the completeness criterion, which forms the numerator.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the givens are:\n1. The total number of eligible inpatient episodes during Quarter $2$ of year $2025$ is $N_{total} = 10,000$.\n2. The number of these eligible admissions that have at least one hemoglobin laboratory result recorded within the required timeframe (no later than $24$ hours after admission) is $N_{complete} = 8,000$.\n3. The remaining episodes ($10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000$) do not meet the criterion, as they either have no result or have results recorded after the $24$-hour timeframe. This confirms that all cases are accounted for and the numerator is precisely $8,000$.\n\nUsing the formal definition, the completeness rate $C$ is calculated as:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N_{complete}}{N_{total}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\nC = \\frac{8,000}{10,000}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nC = 0.8\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.8$. To express this value with four significant figures, we must include trailing zeros. The first significant figure is $8$. To achieve a total of four significant figures, we append three zeros after the $8$.\nTherefore, the completeness rate expressed to four significant figures is $0.8000$.",

            "introduction": "A core responsibility of healthcare data stewardship is balancing the immense potential of data for research with the non-negotiable duty to protect patient privacy. While direct identifiers like names are easily removed, quasi-identifiers (QIs) like age or ZIP code can be combined to re-identify individuals.

            "introduction": "The reliability of clinical decision support tools and machine learning models depends on the stability of the underlying data.

Data stewards actively monitor for such changes using metrics like the Population Stability Index (PSI). This problem guides you through the logic behind the PSI and gives you hands-on practice in calculating it to quantify the magnitude of drift between two datasets .",

            "problem": "A hospital’s Data Governance program monitors the stability of model inputs to ensure clinical decision support tools remain reliable. Consider a laboratory feature whose values are binned into three clinically meaningful intervals (e.g., hypo-, normo-, and hyper-range). The governance team maintains a reference distribution from the prior year and compares it to the current month’s distribution. Let the discrete probability mass functions for the three bins be denoted by $r = (r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3})$ for the reference and $c = (c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3})$ for the current, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_{i} = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_{i} = 1$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a drift metric, identified as the Population Stability Index (PSI), based on a set of core principles, and then its calculation for a given dataset.\n\n### Derivation of the Population Stability Index (PSI)\n\nThe goal is to find a functional form for the drift metric, let's call it $D$, that satisfies the three given properties. Let $d_i$ be the contribution to the drift from the $i$-th bin.\n\n1.  **Additivity:** The total drift is the sum of the bin-wise contributions.\n    $$D = \\sum_{i} d_i$$\n2.  **Sensitivity to Proportional Change:** The metric must be sensitive to the proportional change between the current probability $c_i$ and the reference probability $r_i$. This suggests incorporating the logarithm of their ratio, $\\ln(\\frac{c_i}{r_i})$. This term naturally captures proportional, rather than absolute, differences and is dimensionless.\n3.  **Zero Drift Condition:** If $c_i = r_i$, the contribution from that bin, $d_i$, must be zero. The term $\\ln(\\frac{c_i}{r_i})$ satisfies this, as $\\ln(\\frac{r_i}{r_i}) = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n\nLet us construct the bin-wise drift $d_i$ as a product of a weighting factor and the logarithmic term. A simple form would be $d_i = W_i \\ln(\\frac{c_i}{r_i})$, where $W_i$ is a weight depending on $c_i$ and $r_i$. A logical choice for the weight $W_i$ is the difference in probability mass for the bin, $(c_i - r_i)$. This choice is motivated by the desire for bins with larger changes in probability to contribute more significantly to the total drift. Furthermore, if $c_i - r_i = 0$, the contribution from that bin is zero, which is an intuitive and desirable property for a drift metric.\n\nCombining these elements, we propose the following functional form for the bin-wise contribution:\n$$d_i = (c_i - r_i) \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_i}{r_i}\\right)$$\nThe total drift, or PSI, is the sum over all bins:\n$$\\text{PSI} = \\sum_{i} (c_i - r_i) \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_i}{r_i}\\right)$$\nThis derived functional form satisfies all three required properties. It is additive, it is zero when the distributions are identical, and it is sensitive to proportional changes through the logarithmic term, weighted by the magnitude of the probability shift. This formula is the standard definition of the Population Stability Index.\n\n### Calculation of PSI\n\nWe are given the reference and current probability distributions:\n- Reference: $r = (r_1, r_2, r_3) = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)$\n- Current: $c = (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (0.1, 0.35, 0.55)$\n\nWe compute the contribution for each of the three bins.\n\n**Bin 1:**\n- $c_1 = 0.1$, $r_1 = 0.2$\n- Contribution: $(0.1 - 0.2) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1}{0.2}\\right) = (-0.1) \\ln(0.5) = (-0.1) \\times (-0.693147\\dots) \\approx 0.069315$\n\n**Bin 2:**\n- $c_2 = 0.35$, $r_2 = 0.3$\n- Contribution: $(0.35 - 0.3) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.35}{0.3}\\right) = (0.05) \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{6}\\right) = (0.05) \\times (0.154151\\dots) \\approx 0.007708$\n\n**Bin 3:**\n- $c_3 = 0.55$, $r_3 = 0.5$\n- Contribution: $(0.55 - 0.5) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.55}{0.5}\\right) = (0.05) \\ln(1.1) = (0.05) \\times (0.095310\\dots) \\approx 0.004766$\n\nThe total PSI is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\\text{PSI} = (0.1 - 0.2) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1}{0.2}\\right) + (0.35 - 0.3) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.35}{0.3}\\right) + (0.55 - 0.5) \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.55}{0.5}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{PSI} \\approx 0.069315 + 0.007708 + 0.004766$$\n$$\\text{PSI} \\approx 0.081789$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.08179$.\nThe calculation using higher precision is:\n$\\text{PSI} = (-0.1) \\ln(0.5) + (0.05) \\ln(7/6) + (0.05) \\ln(1.1)$\n$\\text{PSI} \\approx (-0.1)(-0.69314718) + (0.05)(0.15415068) + (0.05)(0.09531018)$\n$\\text{PSI} \\approx 0.069314718 + 0.007707534 + 0.004765509$\n$\\text{PSI} \\approx 0.081787761$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.08179$.",
