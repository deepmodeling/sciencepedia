            "problem": "A hospital formulary is being normalized to the United States National Library of Medicine RxNorm. Under RxNorm, a Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) is defined by a triplet consisting of an Ingredient (IN), a Strength per discrete dose unit, and a Dose Form. A Dose Form Group (DFG) is a grouping of dose forms by route and physical form used for analytics and interoperability.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts and definitions:\n1. The SCD for a simple, single-ingredient product includes exactly one Ingredient (IN), one Strength per unit, and one Dose Form, represented canonically as “Ingredient $+$ Strength $+$ Dose Form.”\n2. In RxNorm, the plain English dose form “tablet” for a routine systemic small-molecule antihypertensive is standardized as the Dose Form “Oral Tablet.”\n3. For this exercise, use the following DFG mapping derived from standard RxNorm groupings: any Dose Form in the set {“Oral Tablet,” “Oral Capsule,” “Chewable Tablet”} is a member of the DFG “Oral Solid.”\n4. Let $n$ denote the number of Ingredients (IN) in the SCD, $s$ denote the numeric strength in milligrams per single dose unit, and $I$ be an indicator variable equal to $1$ if the Dose Form is in the DFG “Oral Solid,” and $0$ otherwise.\n\nYou are given the free-text product description: “lisinopril $10$ mg tablet.”\n\nTasks:\na) Derive the SCD triplet by identifying the Ingredient (IN), the Strength per unit, and the Dose Form from the description using only the facts above.\nb) Using the DFG mapping in fact $3$, determine the value of $I$ for the derived Dose Form.\nc) Compute the verification score\n$$V = n + \\frac{s}{5} + I.$$\n\nProvide the final value of $V$ as a single real number.

The definitions are clear and all necessary information is provided to arrive at a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the three specified tasks in sequence.\n\n**a) Derive the SCD triplet.**\nThe input description is “lisinopril $10$ mg tablet.” We must extract the Ingredient (IN), Strength per unit, and Dose Form.\n-   **Ingredient (IN):** The active ingredient is identified as \"lisinopril.\" Fact 1 specifies this is a \"simple, single-ingredient product,\" and Fact 4 defines $n$ as the number of ingredients. Therefore, we have one ingredient, and $n=1$.\n-   **Strength per unit:** The strength is given as \"$10$ mg.\" Fact 4 defines $s$ as the numeric strength in milligrams. Thus, $s=10$.\n-   **Dose Form:** The dose form is given as \"tablet.\" Fact 2 states that the plain English dose form “tablet” is standardized as the Dose Form “Oral Tablet.”\n\nThe resulting SCD triplet is (lisinopril, $10$ mg, Oral Tablet).\n\n**b) Determine the value of the indicator variable $I$.**\nThe variable $I$ is defined in Fact 4 as an indicator variable that equals $1$ if the Dose Form is in the DFG “Oral Solid,” and $0$ otherwise.\n-   From part (a), the derived Dose Form for the given product is “Oral Tablet.”\n-   Fact 3 defines the DFG “Oral Solid” as containing any Dose Form from the set {“Oral Tablet,” “Oral Capsule,” “Chewable Tablet”}.\n-   Since “Oral Tablet” is an element of this set, the condition for $I=1$ is met.\nTherefore, the value of the indicator variable is $I=1$.\n\n**c) Compute the verification score $V$.**\nThe verification score is defined by the formula:\n$$V = n + \\frac{s}{5} + I$$\nWe substitute the values determined in the previous steps:\n-   $n = 1$ (from a single ingredient, \"lisinopril\")\n-   $s = 10$ (from the strength \"$10$ mg\")\n-   $I = 1$ (as the dose form \"Oral Tablet\" is in the DFG \"Oral Solid\")\n\nPlugging these values into the equation gives:\n$$V = 1 + \\frac{10}{5} + 1$$\nPerforming the arithmetic operations:\n$$V = 1 + 2 + 1$$\n$$V = 4$$\nThe final value of $V$ is $4$.

            "introduction": "For many clinical and analytical purposes, it is essential to group medications that share the same active ingredients and dose form, even if their strengths differ. This practice introduces the Semantic Clinical Drug Form (SCDF), an abstraction that enables such grouping by removing the strength attribute from a Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD). You will not only define this abstraction but also use principles of probability to understand how multiple distinct drug products can be 'collapsed' into a single SCDF, a key feature for enabling higher-level analysis .",

            "problem": "A terminology service represents medications using RxNorm, a controlled vocabulary published by the United States National Library of Medicine (RxNorm). In RxNorm, a Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) encodes a medication as a tuple consisting of its active ingredient set, strength specification, and dose form. A Semantic Clinical Drug Form (SCDF) encodes the same medication concept but abstracts away the strength, preserving only the active ingredient set and dose form. Using only these definitions and fundamental counting principles, you will formalize the mapping from SCD to SCDF and quantify how abstraction over strength collapses multiple SCD into a single SCDF.\n\nConsider a dataset of SCDs covering the following ingredient sets and dose forms, with their observed strength variants:\n\n- Metformin Oral Tablet: strengths $500$ mg, $850$ mg, $1000$ mg.\n- Lisinopril Oral Tablet: strengths $2.5$ mg, $5$ mg, $10$ mg, $20$ mg, $40$ mg.\n- Acetaminophen $+$ Hydrocodone Oral Tablet: strengths $325$ mg $+$ $5$ mg and $325$ mg $+$ $10$ mg.\n- Albuterol Inhalation Solution: strengths $0.083$\\% and $0.5$\\%.\n- Amoxicillin Oral Suspension: strengths $125$ mg$/$ $5$ mL, $250$ mg$/$ $5$ mL, $400$ mg$/$ $5$ mL.\n- Morphine Extended Release Oral Capsule: strengths $10$ mg, $20$ mg, $30$ mg.\n\nTasks:\n\n1. Define a function $f$ that maps any SCD to its corresponding SCDF by preserving the ingredient set and dose form while abstracting away strength. Then, construct the SCDF for the specific SCD “Amoxicillin $250$ mg$/$ $5$ mL Oral Suspension” using your definition, and briefly justify how your construction preserves ingredient and dose form while omitting strength.\n\n2. Suppose two distinct SCDs are drawn uniformly at random without replacement from the entire dataset. Derive, from first principles, the probability that both selected SCDs map to the same SCDF under $f$. Express your final probability as a single simplified fraction with no units. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical informatics, specifically the RxNorm terminology standard. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the tasks are formalizable.\n\nLet the set of all Semantic Clinical Drugs be denoted by $\\mathcal{S}$ and the set of all Semantic Clinical Drug Forms be denoted by $\\mathcal{F}$. According to the provided definition, an SCD is a tuple $s = (I, T, D)$, where $I$ is the set of active ingredients, $T$ is the strength specification, and $D$ is the dose form. Similarly, an SCDF is a tuple $f = (I, D)$.\n\nTask $1$: Define the mapping function and apply it.\n\nLet an arbitrary SCD be $s = (I, T, D) \\in \\mathcal{S}$. The mapping function $f$ abstracts away the strength, which is the second component of the tuple. Therefore, the function $f: \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathcal{F}$ is a projection defined as:\n$$f((I, T, D)) = (I, D)$$\nThis function takes an SCD as input and returns a new tuple containing only the ingredient set $I$ and the dose form $D$, which is, by definition, the corresponding SCDF.\n\nNow, we apply this function to the specific SCD “Amoxicillin $250$ mg$/$ $5$ mL Oral Suspension”.\nFor this SCD, we can identify the components of its tuple representation:\n- Ingredient set: $I = \\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}$\n- Strength: $T = 250 \\text{ mg}/5 \\text{ mL}$\n- Dose Form: $D = \\text{Oral Suspension}$\n\nThe SCD can be formally written as the tuple $s_{amox} = (\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, 250 \\text{ mg}/5 \\text{ mL}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$.\nApplying the function $f$ to $s_{amox}$:\n$$f(s_{amox}) = f((\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, 250 \\text{ mg}/5 \\text{ mL}, \\text{Oral Suspension})) = (\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$$\nThe resulting SCDF is the tuple $(\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$, which corresponds to the name “Amoxicillin Oral Suspension”.\n\nThe construction preserves the ingredient set ($\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}$) and the dose form ($\\text{Oral Suspension}$) by including them as the components of the output tuple. It omits the strength ($250 \\text{ mg}/5 \\text{ mL}$) by not including the second component of the input tuple in the output, thereby achieving the desired abstraction.\n\nTask $2$: Derive the probability.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of distinct SCDs in the dataset. Let $N$ be this total number. We count the number of strength variants for each medication group:\n- Metformin Oral Tablet: $3$ SCDs\n- Lisinopril Oral Tablet: $5$ SCDs\n- Acetaminophen $+$ Hydrocodone Oral Tablet: $2$ SCDs\n- Albuterol Inhalation Solution: $2$ SCDs\n- Amoxicillin Oral Suspension: $3$ SCDs\n- Morphine Extended Release Oral Capsule: $3$ SCDs\n\nThe total number of SCDs is the sum of these counts:\n$$N = 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 18$$\nWe are drawing two distinct SCDs uniformly at random without replacement from this set of $N=18$ SCDs. The total number of ways to choose two distinct SCDs is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$:\n$$\\text{Total Outcomes} = \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{18 \\times 17}{2} = 9 \\times 17 = 153$$\n\nNext, we must find the number of pairs of SCDs that map to the same SCDF under the function $f$. Two SCDs, $s_1 = (I_1, T_1, D_1)$ and $s_2 = (I_2, T_2, D_2)$, map to the same SCDF if and only if $f(s_1) = f(s_2)$, which means $(I_1, D_1) = (I_2, D_2)$. This occurs when both SCDs are chosen from the same medication group (i.e., they share the same ingredient set and dose form).\n\nLet us denote the number of SCDs in each of the $k=6$ medication groups as $n_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n- $n_1 = 3$ (Metformin Oral Tablet)\n- $n_2 = 5$ (Lisinopril Oral Tablet)\n- $n_3 = 2$ (Acetaminophen $+$ Hydrocodone Oral Tablet)\n- $n_4 = 2$ (Albuterol Inhalation Solution)\n- $n_5 = 3$ (Amoxicillin Oral Suspension)\n- $n_6 = 3$ (Morphine Extended Release Oral Capsule)\n\nThe number of ways to choose $2$ SCDs from the $i$-th group is $\\binom{n_i}{2}$. The total number of Favorable Outcomes, $E$, is the sum of the number of pairs that can be formed within each group.\n$$E = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\binom{n_i}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2}$$\nWe calculate each binomial coefficient:\n- $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 3$\n- $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n- $\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the sum for $E$:\n$$E = 3 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 21$$\nThere are $21$ pairs of distinct SCDs that map to the same SCDF.\n\nThe probability, $P$, is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n$$P = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Outcomes}} = \\frac{21}{153}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. Both are divisible by $3$:\n$$21 = 3 \\times 7$$\n$$153 = 3 \\times 51$$\nThus, the simplified probability is:\n$$P = \\frac{7}{51}$$\nSince $7$ is a prime number and $51 = 3 \\times 17$, the fraction is irreducible.",

This final exercise addresses this real-world complexity by introducing the concepts of the Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) and Multiple Ingredients (MIN).

            "problem": "A health system is harmonizing medication records using RxNorm, a standardized clinical drug vocabulary. The objective is to normalize a combination oral liquid product label to RxNorm concept types and verify internal consistency. The following core definitions apply: Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) represents a single ingredient with a quantitative strength and a dose form; Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) represents a clinically meaningful product concept combining one or more SCDC entries with a single dose form and precise strengths; Multiple Ingredient (MIN) represents the unordered set of ingredients regardless of their strengths. For oral liquids, the normalized SCDC strength is specified per the canonical unit volume, which for this exercise is $1$ mL. Use the fundamental relationship that concentration equals amount divided by volume: if an ingredient has amount $a$ in milligrams over a volume $v$ in milliliters, then its concentration is $c = a / v$ in milligrams per milliliter.\n\nYou are given this combination product label as recorded in a hospital formulary: “Acetaminophen $160$ mg per $5$ mL; Diphenhydramine hydrochloride $12.5$ mg per $5$ mL; Oral Suspension.” Assume the preparation is uniform and the labeled strengths are exact with respect to the dispensed $5$ mL oral dosing volume. \n\nTasks:\n1. Decompose the label into Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) entries by normalizing each ingredient’s strength to per $1$ mL for the dose form “Oral Suspension.”\n2. From the SCDC entries, identify the Multiple Ingredient (MIN) concept by listing the ingredient set at the level of ingredient (ignoring salt forms).\n3.

Define the consistency scalar $C$ as the sum of the absolute differences, across ingredients, between the label-stated strengths per $5$ mL and the strengths obtained by recombining the SCDC entries into the SCD per $5$ mL. Compute $C$.\n\nExpress the final value of $C$ in mg. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical informatics and dimensional analysis, well-posed with clear definitions and objectives, and objectively formulated. There are no contradictions, missing information, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis of a medication label using the provided RxNorm-based definitions. We will address each task sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: Decompose the label into Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) entries.**\nAn SCDC represents a single ingredient with a strength normalized to a canonical unit volume, which is specified as $1$ mL. The dose form is \"Oral Suspension.\" We use the relationship that concentration $c$ (in mg/mL) is equal to amount $a$ (in mg) divided by volume $v$ (in mL).\n\nFor the first ingredient, Acetaminophen, the label provides an amount $a_1 = 160$ mg in a volume of $v = 5$ mL. The normalized concentration, $c_1$, which corresponds to the SCDC strength, is calculated as:\n$$c_1 = \\frac{a_1}{v} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nTherefore, the first SCDC is {Acetaminophen, $32$ mg/mL strength, Oral Suspension dose form}.\n\nFor the second ingredient, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, the label provides an amount $a_2 = 12.5$ mg in the same volume of $v = 5$ mL. The normalized concentration, $c_2$, is:\n$$c_2 = \\frac{a_2}{v} = \\frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nTherefore, the second SCDC is {Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, $2.5$ mg/mL strength, Oral Suspension dose form}.\n\n**Task 2: Identify the Multiple Ingredient (MIN) concept.**\nThe MIN concept is defined as the unordered set of ingredients, ignoring any salt forms. The ingredients given are Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hydrochloride. To obtain the MIN, we identify the base ingredients. Acetaminophen has no salt form listed. For Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, the base ingredient is Diphenhydramine.\nThe resulting MIN is the set {Acetaminophen, Diphenhydramine}.\n\n**Task 3: Recombine the SCDC entries to form the Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) concept.**\nThe SCD concept represents the clinically dispensed product, which has a volume of $5$ mL. To reconstruct the SCD strengths, we must scale the normalized SCDC strengths (per $1$ mL) back to the dispensed volume. Let the recombined amount-based strengths per $5$ mL be denoted by $a'_i$.\n\nFor Acetaminophen, using its SCDC strength $c_1 = 32$ mg/mL, the recombined amount in a $5$ mL volume is:\n$$a'_1 = c_1 \\times 5 \\text{ mL} = 32 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 5 \\text{ mL} = 160 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nFor Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, using its SCDC strength $c_2 = 2.5$ mg/mL, the recombined amount in a $5$ mL volume is:\n$$a'_2 = c_2 \\times 5 \\text{ mL} = 2.5 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 5 \\text{ mL} = 12.5 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe recombined SCD concept is thus {Acetaminophen $160$ mg per $5$ mL; Diphenhydramine hydrochloride $12.5$ mg per $5$ mL; Oral Suspension}, which perfectly matches the original product label's description.\n\n**Task 4: Compute the consistency scalar $C$.**\nThe consistency scalar $C$ is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the label-stated strengths and the recombined SCD strengths, with all strengths considered per the dispensed volume of $5$ mL. Let $S_{L,i}$ denote the label-stated strength and $S_{R,i}$ denote the recombined strength for ingredient $i$.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n$$C = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |S_{L,i} - S_{R,i}|$$\nwhere $n=2$ for the two ingredients in the product.\n\nFor the first ingredient, Acetaminophen ($i=1$):\nThe label-stated strength is $S_{L,1} = 160$ mg.\nThe recombined strength from Task 3 is $S_{R,1} = a'_1 = 160$ mg.\nThe absolute difference is $|160 \\text{ mg} - 160 \\text{ mg}| = 0$ mg.\n\nFor the second ingredient, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride ($i=2$):\nThe label-stated strength is $S_{L,2} = 12.5$ mg.\nThe recombined strength from Task 3 is $S_{R,2} = a'_2 = 12.5$ mg.\nThe absolute difference is $|12.5 \\text{ mg} - 12.5 \\text{ mg}| = 0$ mg.\n\nSumming these differences gives the value of the consistency scalar $C$:\n$$C = |160 - 160| + |12.5 - 12.5| = 0 + 0 = 0$$\nThe final value of the consistency scalar $C$ is $0$ mg, which indicates that the normalization and recombination process is internally consistent and perfectly reconstructs the original label.",
