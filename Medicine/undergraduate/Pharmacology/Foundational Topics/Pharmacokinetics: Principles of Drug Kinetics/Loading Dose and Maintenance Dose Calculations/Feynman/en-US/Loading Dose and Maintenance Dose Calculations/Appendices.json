            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided pharmacokinetic parameters are within a realistic range for a therapeutic drug. The problem will be solved by applying first principles of mass balance and core pharmacokinetic definitions.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Oral Loading Dose ($LD$)**\n\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is intended to rapidly achieve a target amount of drug in the body, which corresponds to the target plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{target}}$). The fundamental relationship between the amount of drug in the body ($A$) and the plasma concentration ($C$) is given by the definition of the volume of distribution ($V_{d}$):\n$$C = \\frac{A}{V_d}$$\nTherefore, to achieve a target concentration of $C_{\\text{target}}$, the required amount of drug in the body ($A_{\\text{target}}$) is:\n$$A_{\\text{target}} = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nThe problem specifies oral administration. The bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of the administered oral dose that reaches the systemic circulation. Thus, the amount of drug that actually enters the body from an oral loading dose ($LD$) is $F \\cdot LD$.\nFor the amount of drug in the body to instantaneously reach $A_{\\text{target}}$ upon absorption, we must have:\n$$F \\cdot LD = A_{\\text{target}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\text{target}}$, we get the mass-balance equation for the loading dose:\n$$F \\cdot LD = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nSolving for $LD$:\n$$LD = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $V_{d} = 35 \\text{ L}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$LD = \\frac{(7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (35 \\text{ L})}{0.85} = \\frac{262.5 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 308.8235 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the loading dose is $308.8$ mg.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Oral Maintenance Dose ($MD$)**\n\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is designed to replace the amount of drug eliminated by the body over one dosing interval ($\\tau$), thereby maintaining the average concentration at a steady state. At steady state, the average rate of drug administration must equal the average rate of drug elimination.\n\nThe rate of drug elimination is governed by clearance ($CL$). Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination (mass per time) is the product of clearance and plasma concentration ($C$):\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C$$\nAt steady state, the concentration fluctuates, but the average rate of elimination over a dosing interval can be calculated using the average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$. The problem requires this average to be the target concentration, $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nThe rate of drug administration is the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation per dosing interval, averaged over that interval. For an oral maintenance dose $MD$ with bioavailability $F$ given every $\\tau$ hours, the amount entering the circulation per dose is $F \\cdot MD$. The average rate of administration is:\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Administration} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau}$$\nEquating the average rates at steady state:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nSolving for $MD$:\n$$MD = \\frac{CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $CL = 2.8 \\text{ L/h}$\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $\\tau = 12 \\text{ h}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$MD = \\frac{(2.8 \\text{ L/h}) \\cdot (7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (12 \\text{ h})}{0.85} = \\frac{252 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 296.4705 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the maintenance dose is $296.5$ mg.\n\n**3. Impact of Errors in $V_{d}$ and $CL$**\n\nThe roles of volume of distribution ($V_{d}$) and clearance ($CL$) are distinct, and errors in their estimation have different consequences for the loading dose and maintenance dosing outcomes.\n\n**Effect on Initial Concentration after Loading Dose:**\nThe initial concentration achieved immediately after the absorption of the loading dose, $C_{0}$, is determined by the principle that the bioavailable dose ($F \\cdot LD$) fills the volume of distribution ($V_d$).\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{F \\cdot LD}{V_d}$$\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $V_{d,est}$: $LD = (C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}) / F$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved concentration $C_0$ which depends on the *true* $V_d$:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{F}{V_d} \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{d,est}}{V_d}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved initial concentration $C_0$ is directly proportional to the estimated $V_{d,est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $V_d$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **overestimated** ($V_{d,est} > V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too large. This results in an achieved initial concentration $C_0$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **underestimated** ($V_{d,est} < V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_0$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $CL$ does not appear in the equation for $C_0$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $CL$ has **no effect** on the initial concentration achieved by the loading dose. $CL$ only governs how quickly the concentration declines *after* this initial level is achieved.\n\n**Effect on Average Steady-State Concentration:**\nThe average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) is determined by the balance between the rate of drug administration and the rate of drug elimination. As derived previously:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $CL_{est}$: $MD = (CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau) / F$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ which depends on the *true* $CL$:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F}{CL \\cdot \\tau} \\left( \\frac{CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{est}}{CL}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ is directly proportional to the estimated $CL_{est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $CL$.\n-   If $CL$ is **overestimated** ($CL_{est} > CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too large to compensate for a faster-than-actual perceived elimination. This results in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $CL$ is **underestimated** ($CL_{est} < CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $V_d$ does not appear in the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $V_d$ has **no effect** on the average concentration achieved at steady state. An incorrect $V_d$ would alter the time to reach steady state and the magnitude of the fluctuations (peak and trough concentrations) around the average, but not the average value itself.\n\nIn summary, the loading dose and the initial concentration are governed by $V_d$, while the maintenance dose and the average steady-state concentration are governed by $CL$.",

It explores a common clinical consideration: changing the dosing frequency for patient convenience while aiming to maintain the same average therapeutic effect. This exercise will demonstrate the direct trade-off between a less frequent dosing schedule and the resulting fluctuation in drug levels, a key concept in optimizing both efficacy and safety .",

            "problem": "A single-compartment drug with instantaneous distribution and first-order elimination is administered repeatedly to achieve a target steady-state concentration. Assume linear pharmacokinetics, constant bioavailability, and no time-varying clearance. A patient is receiving a maintenance regimen designed to achieve a specified average steady-state concentration $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$ over each dosing interval. The drug’s terminal half-life is $t_{1/2} = 8~\\text{h}$. The current dosing interval is $\\tau_{1} = 12~\\text{h}$, and the clinician plans to change to a less frequent regimen with dosing interval $\\tau_{2} = 24~\\text{h}$ while keeping the same $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$.\n\nUsing first principles of mass balance at steady state and the definition of clearance, do the following:\n\n1. Starting from the definitions of steady state and average input rate over a dosing interval, show that keeping $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$ unchanged when changing from $\\tau_{1}$ to $\\tau_{2}$ requires that the maintenance dose per administration be scaled in direct proportion to the dosing interval. Explicitly, demonstrate that doubling $\\tau$ necessitates doubling the dose per administration, and argue why this leaves the total daily dose unchanged.\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and formulated with objective, unambiguous language. The solution can proceed.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Dose Scaling and Total Daily Dose**\n\nThe analysis begins from the first principle of mass balance at steady state, which dictates that the average rate of drug input must equal the average rate of drug elimination.\n\nLet $D_M$ be the maintenance dose administered per dosing interval $\\tau$. Let $F$ be the bioavailability, representing the fraction of the dose that reaches systemic circulation. The total amount of drug entering the circulation over one interval is $F \\cdot D_M$. The average rate of drug input is then:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_M}{\\tau} $$\nThe rate of elimination at any time $t$ is the product of the drug's clearance, $CL$, and its plasma concentration, $C(t)$. Assuming linear pharmacokinetics, $CL$ is a constant. The average rate of elimination over a dosing interval at steady state is the product of clearance and the average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,\\text{avg}} $$\nAt steady state, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot D_M}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,\\text{avg}} $$\nSolving for the average steady-state concentration yields a fundamental relationship in pharmacokinetics:\n$$ C_{ss,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_M}{CL \\cdot \\tau} $$\nThe problem states that a patient is switched from an initial regimen (dose $D_{M1}$, interval $\\tau_{1}$) to a new regimen (dose $D_{M2}$, interval $\\tau_{2}$) while keeping $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$ constant. The parameters $F$ and $CL$ are also assumed to be constant. We can therefore equate the expressions for $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$ for both regimens:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot D_{M1}}{CL \\cdot \\tau_{1}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{M2}}{CL \\cdot \\tau_{2}} $$\nThe constant terms $F$ and $CL$ cancel, leading to:\n$$ \\frac{D_{M1}}{\\tau_{1}} = \\frac{D_{M2}}{\\tau_{2}} $$\nThis equation shows that the dosing rate, defined as the dose per unit time ($D_M/\\tau$), must remain constant to maintain the same $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$. To demonstrate the scaling relationship, we solve for $D_{M2}$:\n$$ D_{M2} = D_{M1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{2}}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) $$\nThis result explicitly shows that the maintenance dose per administration, $D_M$, must be scaled in direct proportion to the dosing interval, $\\tau$. Specifically, if the dosing interval is doubled such that $\\tau_{2} = 2\\tau_{1}$, the new dose must also be doubled:\n$$ D_{M2} = D_{M1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2\\tau_{1}}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) = 2 \\cdot D_{M1} $$\nThis completes the first required demonstration.\n\nNext, we argue why this leaves the total daily dose unchanged. The total daily dose is the total amount of drug administered over a $24$-hour period.\nFor the initial regimen, the total daily dose is $D_{\\text{total},1} = D_{M1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{24~\\text{h}}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)$.\nFor the new regimen, the total daily dose is $D_{\\text{total},2} = D_{M2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{24~\\text{h}}{\\tau_{2}}\\right)$.\nFrom the previously derived relationship $\\frac{D_{M1}}{\\tau_{1}} = \\frac{D_{M2}}{\\tau_{2}}$, we can multiply both sides by the constant $24~\\text{h}$:\n$$ D_{M1} \\cdot \\frac{24~\\text{h}}{\\tau_{1}} = D_{M2} \\cdot \\frac{24~\\text{h}}{\\tau_{2}} $$\nThis is equivalent to stating that $D_{\\text{total},1} = D_{\\text{total},2}$. Thus, changing the dosing regimen in this manner keeps the total daily dose constant, which is consistent with maintaining a constant average input rate.\n\n**Part 2: Peak-to-Trough Concentration Ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the ratio of the steady-state peak concentration ($C_{ss,\\text{max}}$) to the trough concentration ($C_{ss,\\text{min}}$) over a dosing interval $\\tau$. The key assumption is that the concentration declines monoexponentially between doses.\n\nLet $t=0$ be the time immediately after a dose is administered at steady state, where the concentration is at its peak, $C_{ss,\\text{max}}$. The concentration $C(t)$ at a later time $t$ within the interval ($0 \\le t \\le \\tau$) is described by first-order elimination kinetics:\n$$ C(t) = C_{ss,\\text{max}} \\cdot \\exp(-k_e t) $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The trough concentration, $C_{ss,\\text{min}}$, occurs at the very end of the dosing interval, just before the next dose, at $t=\\tau$. Therefore:\n$$ C_{ss,\\text{min}} = C_{ss,\\text{max}} \\cdot \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\nThe general steady-state ratio of peak-to-trough concentration is obtained by rearranging this equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)} = \\exp(k_e \\tau) $$\nThis ratio is a measure of the fluctuation in drug concentration over a dosing interval.\n\nTo evaluate this ratio numerically for the new regimen, we must first determine $k_e$ from the given half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The relationship is:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e} \\quad \\implies \\quad k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nSubstituting this into the ratio expression gives:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} \\cdot \\tau\\right) $$\nWe are given the values for the new regimen:\n- Terminal half-life: $t_{1/2} = 8~\\text{h}$\n- New dosing interval: $\\tau = \\tau_{2} = 24~\\text{h}$\n\nSubstituting these numerical values into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8~\\text{h}} \\cdot 24~\\text{h}\\right) $$\nThe units of hours cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio as expected:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = \\exp\\left(3 \\cdot \\ln(2)\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = \\exp\\left(\\ln(2^3)\\right) = \\exp(\\ln(8)) $$\nSince the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse functions:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{max}}}{C_{ss,\\text{min}}} = 8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact integer value of $8$ is written as $8.00$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe analysis is based on the principles of a linear one-compartment model with first-order elimination and repeated bolus dosing.\n\nFirst, we determine the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_e$, from the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nGiven $t_{1/2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$,\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nThe fraction of drug remaining after one dosing interval, $\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, is given by the term $e^{-k_e \\tau}$.\n$$e^{-k_e \\tau} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{6} \\cdot 8\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\ln(2)\\right) = \\left(e^{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{-4/3} = 2^{-4/3}$$\nThis term is a constant that will be used throughout the calculations. $2^{-4/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{16}} \\approx 0.39685$.\n\nAt steady state ($ss$), the maximum and minimum concentrations ($C_{ss,max}$ and $C_{ss,min}$) are constant from cycle to cycle. The concentration immediately after a dose is $C_{ss,max}$, and the concentration just before the next dose is $C_{ss,min}$. They are related by:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$$\nThe immediate increase in concentration after an oral dose $D_0$ is $\\Delta C = \\frac{F D_0}{V}$. At steady state, the concentration jumps from $C_{ss,min}$ to $C_{ss,max}$:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\nSolving these two simultaneous equations for $C_{ss,max}$ and $C_{ss,min}$ gives:\n$$C_{ss,max} = \\frac{F D_0}{V} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$$\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\frac{F D_0}{V} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the patient, at steady state, misses one dose. Let's denote the time of the *last properly administered dose* as $t=0$. At $t=0^+$, the concentration is $C_{ss,max}$. The missed dose was scheduled for time $t=\\tau$. The next dose is scheduled for time $t=2\\tau$. We must find the trough concentration at $t=2\\tau$.\n\nAt time $t=\\tau$, just before the scheduled (but missed) dose, the concentration has decayed from $C_{ss,max}$ to $C_{ss,min}$:\n$$C(\\tau^-) = C_{ss,max} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} = C_{ss,min}$$\nSince the dose at $t=\\tau$ is missed, the concentration does not increase. It continues to decay from $C_{ss,min}$ for another full dosing interval of $\\tau$.\nThe altered trough concentration at time $t=2\\tau$, which we denote as $C'_{trough}$, is:\n$$C'_{trough} = C(\\tau^-) \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$$\n\n**Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Altered Concentrations**\n\nThe new trough concentration is $C'_{trough} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$. Since $k_e > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the factor $e^{-k_e \\tau}$ is less than $1$. Therefore, **qualitatively**, the new trough concentration is lower than the usual steady-state trough concentration.\n\nNumerically:\nThe incremental concentration is $\\Delta C = \\frac{F D_0}{V} = \\frac{0.80 \\cdot 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{40\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nThe steady-state trough is:\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\Delta C \\cdot \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot \\frac{2^{-4/3}}{1 - 2^{-4/3}} \\approx 6 \\cdot \\frac{0.39685}{1 - 0.39685} \\approx 3.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe altered trough is:\n$$C'_{trough} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} \\approx 3.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot 0.39685 \\approx 1.567\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe new trough is approximately $1.57\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, significantly lower than the steady-state trough of approximately $3.95\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\nIf a usual dose $D_0$ were administered at $t=2\\tau$, the new peak would be $C'_{peak} = C'_{trough} + \\Delta C$. The usual peak is $C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\Delta C$.\n**Qualitatively**, since $C'_{trough} < C_{ss,min}$, the new peak $C'_{peak}$ would be lower than the usual steady-state peak $C_{ss,max}$.\nNumerically:\n$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\Delta C \\approx 3.948 + 6 = 9.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n$C'_{peak} = C'_{trough} + \\Delta C \\approx 1.567 + 6 = 7.567\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nThe new peak would be approximately $7.57\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ instead of the usual $9.95\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\n**Determination of the Compensatory Dose**\n\nThe goal is to administer a new oral dose, $D'$, at time $t=2\\tau$ to instantaneously restore the concentration to the usual steady-state peak, $C_{ss,max}$. The concentration just before this dose is $C'_{trough}$. The new dose $D'$ must cause a concentration increase of $\\frac{F D'}{V}$ such that:\n$$C'_{trough} + \\frac{F D'}{V} = C_{ss,max}$$\nWe can substitute the known relationships for the concentration terms:\n$$C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D'}{V} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\nRearranging to solve for $D'$:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V} = C_{ss,min} - C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V} = C_{ss,min}(1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}) + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $C_{ss,min} = \\frac{F D_0}{V} \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V} = \\left(\\frac{F D_0}{V} \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}\\right) (1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}) + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\nThe term $(1 - e^{-k_e \\tau})$ cancels out:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V} = \\frac{F D_0}{V} e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D_0}{V}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{V}{F}$ gives the expression for the required dose $D'$:\n$$D' = D_0 e^{-k_e \\tau} + D_0 = D_0 (1 + e^{-k_e \\tau})$$\nThis result is intuitive: the required dose is the normal maintenance dose $D_0$ plus a \"make-up\" dose, $D_0 e^{-k_e \\tau}$, which corresponds to the amount of the missed dose that would have been eliminated during the interval $\\tau$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $D'$.\nGiven $D_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $e^{-k_e \\tau} = 2^{-4/3}$.\n$$D' = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot (1 + 2^{-4/3})$$\n$$D' = 300 \\cdot (1 + 0.39685026...)$$\n$$D' = 300 \\cdot (1.39685026...)$$\n$$D' = 419.05507...\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $419\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",
