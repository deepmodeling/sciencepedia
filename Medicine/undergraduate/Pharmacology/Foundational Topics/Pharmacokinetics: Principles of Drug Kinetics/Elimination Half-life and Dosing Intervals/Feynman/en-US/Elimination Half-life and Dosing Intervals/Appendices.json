This first practice exercise delves into the fundamental principle of drug accumulation. By deriving the accumulation ratio, $R$, directly from the differential equation governing first-order elimination, you will build a robust mental model of how the relationship between a drug's elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$) and the dosing interval ($\\tau$) dictates the extent to which a drug will build up in the body to reach its steady-state concentration .",

            "problem": "A clinician is initiating a fixed-dose multiple dosing regimen for a drug that follows a one-compartment, linear, time-invariant model with first-order elimination and instantaneous input at the dosing times. Between doses the plasma concentration $C(t)$ evolves according to the differential equation $ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -k\\,C $ with constant elimination rate constant $k$. The elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$ is defined by $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. Identical doses are administered at a fixed dosing interval $\\tau$. Define the steady-state accumulation ratio $R$ as the ratio of the steady-state peak concentration immediately after a dose to the peak concentration after the very first dose.\n\nStarting only from the stated differential equation and the definition of elimination half-life, and without appealing to prefabricated accumulation formulas, derive an expression for $R$ in terms of $k$ and $\\tau$, and then express it purely in terms of $t_{1/2}$ and $\\tau$.

All definitions are standard within this field.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined, providing all necessary definitions and equations to derive the required expressions and compute the final value. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. The request for clinical interpretation pertains to the standard, objective consequences of the calculated accumulation ratio within the established pharmacokinetic framework, not subjective opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe concentration of the drug in the plasma between doses is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -k C $$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt $$\nIntegrating both sides from an initial time $t_0$ (with concentration $C_0$) to a later time $t$ (with concentration $C(t)$) yields:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{t_0}^{t} -k \\, dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -k(t - t_0) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -k(t - t_0) $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the concentration decay function:\n$$ C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k(t - t_0)) $$\nFor a single decay period starting at time $t=0$ with concentration $C(0)$, the equation simplifies to $C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)$.\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the elimination rate constant $k$ and the elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t=t_{1/2}$, the concentration is half of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C(0)$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nDividing by $C(0)$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\n\nNow, we model the concentration over a multiple-dosing regimen. Let $\\Delta C$ be the instantaneous increase in concentration following the administration of a single dose. Let $C_{n, \\text{peak}}$ be the peak concentration immediately after the $n$-th dose and $C_{n, \\text{trough}}$ be the trough concentration just before the $(n+1)$-th dose.\nThe peak concentration after the first dose (at $t=0$) is:\n$$ C_{1, \\text{peak}} = \\Delta C $$\nAfter a dosing interval $\\tau$, the concentration decays to the first trough value:\n$$ C_{1, \\text{trough}} = C_{1, \\text{peak}} \\exp(-k\\tau) = \\Delta C \\exp(-k\\tau) $$\nImmediately after the second dose (at $t=\\tau$), a new amount $\\Delta C$ is added:\n$$ C_{2, \\text{peak}} = C_{1, \\text{trough}} + \\Delta C = \\Delta C \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\Delta C = \\Delta C (1 + \\exp(-k\\tau)) $$\nThis process continues. The peak concentration after the $(n+1)$-th dose is related to the peak after the $n$-th dose by the recurrence relation:\n$$ C_{n+1, \\text{peak}} = C_{n, \\text{peak}} \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\Delta C $$\nAt steady state (as $n \\to \\infty$), the peak and trough concentrations become constant from one interval to the next. Let $C_{\\text{ss, peak}}$ denote the steady-state peak concentration. Then, $C_{n+1, \\text{peak}} = C_{n, \\text{peak}} = C_{\\text{ss, peak}}$. Substituting into the recurrence relation:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss, peak}} = C_{\\text{ss, peak}} \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\Delta C $$\nWe can now solve for $C_{\\text{ss, peak}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss, peak}} - C_{\\text{ss, peak}} \\exp(-k\\tau) = \\Delta C $$\n$$ C_{\\text{ss, peak}} (1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)) = \\Delta C $$\n$$ C_{\\text{ss, peak}} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} $$\nThe accumulation ratio $R$ is defined as $R = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss, peak}}}{C_{1, \\text{peak}}}$. Substituting the expressions for $C_{\\text{ss, peak}}$ and $C_{1, \\text{peak}} = \\Delta C$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta C}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}}{\\Delta C} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} $$\nThis is the expression for $R$ in terms of $k$ and $\\tau$.\n\nTo express $R$ in terms of $t_{1/2}$ and $\\tau$, we substitute $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\tau\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-\\tau/t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-\\tau/t_{1/2}}} $$\nThis is the expression for $R$ purely in terms of $t_{1/2}$ and $\\tau$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $R$ for $t_{1/2} = 12$ h and $\\tau = 8$ h. The units of time are consistent and cancel in the ratio.\nThe exponent is $-\\frac{\\tau}{t_{1/2}} = -\\frac{8}{12} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-2/3}} $$\nWe calculate the value:\n$$ 2^{-2/3} \\approx 0.62996052 $$\n$$ 1 - 2^{-2/3} \\approx 1 - 0.62996052 = 0.37003948 $$\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{0.37003948} \\approx 2.70240055 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R \\approx 2.702$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the clinical significance of this value. An accumulation ratio of $R \\approx 2.702$ signifies that drug accumulation is moderate but significant. At steady state, the peak plasma concentration will be $2.702$ times higher than the peak concentration achieved after the first dose. This indicates that a substantial period of time, on the order of $3$ to $5$ half-lives (i.e., $3 \\times 12 = 36$ hours to $5 \\times 12 = 60$ hours), will be required to reach steady-state conditions. If a rapid onset of the drug's therapeutic effect is clinically necessary, the slow accumulation to steady state may be undesirable. In such a scenario, a loading dose, which is larger than the subsequent maintenance doses, would be warranted to rapidly achieve a plasma concentration that approximates the eventual steady-state level. The value of $R$ being greater than $1$ is a direct consequence of the dosing interval ($\\tau = 8$ h) being shorter than the elimination half-life ($t_{1/2} = 12$ h), which allows insufficient time for the drug to be completely eliminated between doses.",

The concepts of steady state, peak and trough concentrations, dosing interval, IV bolus administration, volume of distribution, and clearance are all standard, well-established principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient data ($C_{\\text{ss,max,current}}$, $C_{\\text{ss,min,current}}$, $\\tau_{\\text{current}}$) to determine the patient's elimination rate constant ($k_e$).

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem is governed by the principles of first-order elimination kinetics in a one-compartment model for a drug administered via repeated IV bolus injections.\n\nThe concentration of the drug, $C(t)$, at a time $t$ after reaching a peak concentration $C_{\\text{peak}}$ declines according to the equation:\n$$C(t) = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The constant $k_e$ is a characteristic of the drug and the patient, related to the drug's clearance ($CL$) and volume of distribution ($V_d$) by $k_e = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$. Since $CL$ and $V_d$ are assumed to be constant, $k_e$ is also constant.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration fluctuates between a peak, $C_{\\text{ss,max}}$, immediately after a dose, and a trough, $C_{\\text{ss,min}}$, immediately before the next dose. The trough concentration is the result of the elimination process acting on the peak concentration over one dosing interval, $\\tau$. Thus, the relationship is:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min}} = C_{\\text{ss,max}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the patient-specific elimination rate constant, $k_e$, using the data from the current dosing regimen.\nThe given values are $C_{\\text{ss,max,current}} = 12\\,\\text{mg/L}$, $C_{\\text{ss,min,current}} = 4\\,\\text{mg/L}$, and $\\tau_{\\text{current}} = 8\\,\\text{h}$.\nSubstituting these into the steady-state equation:\n$$4 = 12 \\exp(-k_e \\cdot 8)$$\nTo solve for $k_e$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\frac{4}{12} = \\exp(-8k_e)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{3} = \\exp(-8k_e)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -8k_e$$\n$$-\\ln(3) = -8k_e$$\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{8}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nThis value of $k_e$ is a constant for this patient.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of the IV bolus dose, $D$. In a one-compartment model, an IV bolus dose instantaneously increases the drug concentration by an amount $\\Delta C = \\frac{D}{V_d}$. At steady state, this increase corresponds to the difference between the peak and trough concentrations:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{\\text{ss,max}} - C_{\\text{ss,min}}$$\nTherefore, we have:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} - C_{\\text{ss,min}} = \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\nThe problem states that the per-dose amount, $D$, is kept unchanged. Since the volume of distribution, $V_d$, is also assumed to be constant, the difference between the steady-state peak and trough concentrations, $\\Delta C$, must remain constant for the new dosing regimen.\n\nFor the current regimen:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{\\text{ss,max,current}} - C_{\\text{ss,min,current}} = 12\\,\\text{mg/L} - 4\\,\\text{mg/L} = 8\\,\\text{mg/L}$$\nThis difference must be the same for the new regimen:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{\\text{ss,max,new}} - C_{\\text{ss,min,new}} = 8\\,\\text{mg/L}$$\n\nThe clinician desires a new steady-state trough concentration of $C_{\\text{ss,min,new}} = 2.0\\,\\text{mg/L}$. We can now find the corresponding new steady-state peak concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,max,new}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max,new}} - 2.0 = 8$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max,new}} = 10.0\\,\\text{mg/L}$$\n\nFinally, we use the steady-state equation for the new regimen to find the new dosing interval, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$. We use the newly calculated peak and target trough concentrations, along with the previously determined elimination rate constant $k_e$.\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min,new}} = C_{\\text{ss,max,new}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}})$$\n$$2.0 = 10.0 \\exp(-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}})$$\nIsolating the exponential term:\n$$\\frac{2.0}{10.0} = \\exp(-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{5} = \\exp(-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = -k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}}$$\n$$-\\ln(5) = -k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{k_e}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $k_e = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{8}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\frac{\\ln(3)}{8}} = 8 \\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\ln(3)}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we calculate the value of this expression:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = 8 \\frac{1.6094379...}{1.0986123...} \\approx 8 \\times 1.4649735... \\approx 11.719788\\,\\text{h}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} \\approx 11.72\\,\\text{h}$$\nThe new dosing interval required to achieve a trough concentration of $2.0\\,\\text{mg/L}$ while keeping the dose amount constant is $11.72$ hours.",

I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the Principled Algorithm and Solution\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$, $C_{\\max,\\textss}$, $D$, and $\\tau$.\nThe concentration increment from a single dose is $\\Delta C = \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}}$.\nThus, $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} = C_{\\min,\\textss} + \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}}$.\nThe decay over the interval is $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$.\n\nA crucial insight is the fluctuation ratio, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}}{C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}} = \\frac{C_{\\min,\\text{ss}} + \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}}}{C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}} = 1 + \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}} \\cdot C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}}$$\nAlternatively and more fundamentally, by substituting the expressions:\n$$R = \\frac{C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}}{C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}} = \\frac{C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}}{C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}} = e^{k_e \\tau}$$\nThis shows that the fluctuation ratio $R$ depends *only* on the drug's intrinsic half-life (via $k_e$) and the chosen dosing interval ($\\tau$). The ratio is independent of the dose $D$.\n\n**Algorithm Design:**\nThe goal is to increase $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$ to $3.5$ mg/L while keeping $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} \\le 7.5$ mg/L.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current state:**\n    -   $k_e \\approx 0.06931 \\text{ h}^{-1}$.\n    -   Current $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}} \\approx 2.312$ mg/L.\n    -   Current $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} = C_{\\min,\\text{ss}} + \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}} = 2.312 \\text{ mg/L} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 150 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 2.312 + 3 = 5.312$ mg/L.\n    -   The current state is: $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}} \\approx 2.31$ mg/L (below target $3.5$ mg/L) and $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}} \\approx 5.31$ mg/L (below safety limit $7.5$ mg/L).\n\n2.  **Strategy 1: Increase Dose ($D$), keep $\\tau$ constant.**\n    -   If we change only the dose, $D$, all concentrations scale proportionally because the fluctuation ratio $R = e^{k_e \\tau}$ remains constant.\n    -   To reach $C_{\\min,\\text{ss, target}} = 3.5$ mg/L, the required scaling factor is $\\frac{3.5 \\text{ mg/L}}{2.312 \\text{ mg/L}} \\approx 1.514$.\n    -   The new dose would be $D_{\\text{new}} = D_{\\text{current}} \\cdot 1.514 = 150 \\text{ mg} \\cdot 1.514 \\approx 227.1$ mg.\n    -   The projected new maximum concentration would be $C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}} = C_{\\max,\\text{ss, current}} \\cdot 1.514 = 5.312 \\text{ mg/L} \\cdot 1.514 \\approx 8.04$ mg/L.\n    -   **Decision**: This projected $C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}}$ of $8.04$ mg/L exceeds the safety limit of $7.5$ mg/L. Therefore, this strategy is not acceptable.\n\n3.  **Strategy 2: Shorten Interval ($\\tau$), keep $D$ constant (or adjust as needed).**\n    -   Since proportional scaling failed, the fluctuation $R = e^{k_e \\tau}$ is too large for the desired therapeutic window. To reduce fluctuation, one must shorten the dosing interval $\\tau$.\n    -   Let's test the specific recommendation in Option A: keep $D = 150$ mg and change $\\tau$ to $8$ h.\n    -   New interval $\\tau_{\\text{new}} = 8$ h.\n    -   Exponent: $k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}} \\approx 0.06931 \\text{ h}^{-1} \\cdot 8 \\text{ h} \\approx 0.5545$.\n    -   Decay factor: $e^{-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}}} \\approx e^{-0.5545} \\approx 0.5743$.\n    -   Dose-dependent term: $\\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 150 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 3$ mg/L.\n    -   New minimum concentration:\n        $$C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} = \\left(\\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}}\\right) \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}}}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau_{\\text{new}}}} = (3 \\text{ mg/L}) \\frac{0.5743}{1 - 0.5743} \\approx (3 \\text{ mg/L}) \\frac{0.5743}{0.4257} \\approx 4.047 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n    -   This new $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$ of $\\approx 4.05$ mg/L successfully meets the target of $\\ge 3.5$ mg/L.\n    -   New maximum concentration:\n        $$C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}} = C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} + \\frac{FD}{V_{\\text{d}}} \\approx 4.047 \\text{ mg/L} + 3 \\text{ mg/L} \\approx 7.047 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n    -   This new $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ of $\\approx 7.05$ mg/L is below the safety limit of $7.5$ mg/L.\n    -   **Decision**: This strategy is both effective and safe.\n\nThe **principled algorithm** is thus:\n1.  Calculate current $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ and $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$.\n2.  Hypothesize increasing the dose $D$ proportionally to reach the $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$ target.\n3.  Calculate the resulting $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ from this dose increase.\n4.  If the new $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ is within the safety limit, this is a viable option.\n5.  If the new $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ exceeds the safety limit, it implies the inherent fluctuation $R=e^{k_e\\tau}$ is too large. The dosing interval $\\tau$ must be shortened to reduce this fluctuation. A new regimen with a shorter $\\tau$ must then be calculated and verified.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compute the elimination rate constant from $t_{1/2}$, assess the magnitude of decline across one dosing interval, and if raising $D$ proportionally to reach the $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$ target would cause $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ to exceed the safety constraint, prioritize shortening $\\tau$; for this case, reduce $\\tau$ to $8$ h while keeping $D = 150$ mg.**\n-   **Algorithm**: This statement perfectly describes the principled algorithm derived above. It correctly identifies the logic for choosing between adjusting $D$ and adjusting $\\tau$.\n-   **Application**: It recommends the exact regimen ($D=150$ mg, $\\tau=8$ h) that my calculations proved to be both effective and safe.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Increase $D$ by the ratio of target to current $C_{\\min,\\textss}$ without considering $t_{1/2}$ or $\\tau$; for this case, set $D = 225$ mg every $12$ h.**\n-   **Algorithm**: This algorithm is critically flawed. It ignores the $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ safety constraint, which is a primary concern. Stating to ignore $t_{1/2}$ and $\\tau$ is scientifically unsound, as these parameters govern the fluctuation that determines if the strategy is safe.\n-   **Application**: The proposed new dose is $D = 225$ mg. Let's calculate the outcome. $D_{\\text{new}} = 1.5 \\cdot D_{\\text{current}}$. All concentrations will scale by $1.5$.\n    -   $C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} = 2.312 \\cdot 1.5 = 3.468$ mg/L. This is borderline on the target.\n    -   $C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}} = 5.312 \\cdot 1.5 = 7.968$ mg/L. This violates the safety constraint of $7.5$ mg/L.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The algorithm is unsafe, and the specific recommendation is not permissible.\n\n**C. Always shorten $\\tau$ to the smallest practical value to increase $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$; for this case, set $\\tau = 6$ h while keeping $D = 150$ mg.**\n-   **Algorithm**: The `Always` and `smallest practical value` directives make this a poor heuristic, not a principled algorithm. It doesn't consider if a simpler dose adjustment might be sufficient and safe. The goal is to meet the target, not to overshoot it by minimizing $\\tau$ arbitrarily.\n-   **Application**: Test $D=150$ mg, $\\tau=6$ h.\n    -   $k_e \\tau \\approx 0.06931 \\cdot 6 = 0.41586$. $e^{-k_e \\tau} \\approx 0.6598$.\n    -   $C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} = (3 \\text{ mg/L}) \\frac{0.6598}{1 - 0.6598} \\approx 5.82$ mg/L. This is a significant overshoot of the $3.5$ mg/L target.\n    -   $C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}} = 5.82 + 3 = 8.82$ mg/L. This massively violates the $7.5$ mg/L safety constraint.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The algorithm is flawed, and the recommendation is unsafe.\n\n**D. Keep the total daily dose constant and split it into more frequent administrations regardless of $t_{1/2}$; for this case, change to $75$ mg every $6$ h.**\n-   **Algorithm**: \"Keeping total daily dose constant\" is a common strategy to reduce fluctuation, but it is not a universally applicable first principle for achieving a specific target trough. \"Regardless of $t_{1/2}$\" is again an unscientific statement.\n-   **Application**: The current daily dose is $2 \\cdot 150 = 300$ mg. The proposed regimen is $4 \\cdot 75 = 300$ mg per day. Let's test $D=75$ mg, $\\tau=6$ h.\n    -   Dose increment $\\Delta C = \\frac{1 \\cdot 75 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 1.5$ mg/L.\n    -   From C, for $\\tau=6$ h, the term $\\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}} \\approx 1.939$.\n    -   $C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} = (1.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot 1.939 \\approx 2.91$ mg/L.\n    -   This trough concentration is below the target of $3.5$ mg/L. The regimen is ineffective.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The algorithm is a heuristic, and the specific recommendation fails to meet the therapeutic objective.\n\n**E. Simultaneously increase dose and shorten $\\tau$ just enough to make $C_{\\min,\\text{ss}}$ reach target, ignoring the $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ constraint; for this case, use $200$ mg every $10$ h.**\n-   **Algorithm**: \"Ignoring the $C_{\\max,\\text{ss}}$ constraint\" is fundamentally unacceptable from a scientific, medical, and ethical standpoint. Patient safety is non-negotiable.\n-   **Application**: Test $D=200$ mg, $\\tau=10$ h. Note that $\\tau = t_{1/2}$.\n    -   $k_e \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10} \\cdot 10 = \\ln(2)$. So $e^{-k_e \\tau} = e^{-\\ln(2)} = 0.5$.\n    -   Dose increment $\\Delta C = \\frac{1 \\cdot 200 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ L}} = 4$ mg/L.\n    -   $C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} = (4 \\text{ mg/L}) \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5} = 4$ mg/L. This meets the target.\n    -   $C_{\\max,\\text{ss, new}} = C_{\\min,\\text{ss, new}} + \\Delta C = 4 + 4 = 8$ mg/L.\n    -   This violates the safety constraint of $7.5$ mg/L.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The algorithm is unconscionable, and the recommendation is unsafe.",
