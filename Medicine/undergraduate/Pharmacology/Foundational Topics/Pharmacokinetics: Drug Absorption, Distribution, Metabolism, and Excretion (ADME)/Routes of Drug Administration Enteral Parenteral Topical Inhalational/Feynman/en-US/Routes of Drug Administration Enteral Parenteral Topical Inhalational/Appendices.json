Thus, the concentration increases monotonically throughout the infusion period.\n- For $t  T$:\n  $$ C(t) = C(T) \\exp(-k_e (t-T)) \\implies \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_e C(T) \\exp(-k_e (t-T)) $$\n  Since $k_e$ and $C(T)$ are positive, $\\frac{dC}{dt}  0$. Thus, the concentration decreases monotonically after the infusion stops.\nCombining these observations, the maximum concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{max, infusion}}$) occurs exactly at the end of the infusion, at $t=T$.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{max, infusion}} = C(T) = \\frac{R_0}{V_{\\mathrm{d}} k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e T)) $$\nSubstituting $R_0 = D/T$:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{max, infusion}} = \\frac{D}{T V_{\\mathrm{d}} k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e T)) $$\nThe condition that this maximum concentration does not exceed $C_{\\mathrm{safe}}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{D}{T V_{\\mathrm{d}} k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e T)) \\le C_{\\mathrm{safe}} $$\n\n**Task 4: Minimum Infusion Duration, $T_{\\min}$**\n\nTo find the minimum infusion duration, $T_{\\min}$, we solve the equality case of the condition derived in Task 3:\n$$ \\frac{D}{T_{\\min} V_{\\mathrm{d}} k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e T_{\\min})) = C_{\\mathrm{safe}} $$\nThis equation is transcendental and must be solved for $T_{\\min}$. We can simplify it by rearranging and non-dimensionalizing. Let $y = k_e T_{\\min}$.\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{safe}} V_{\\mathrm{d}}}{D} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-k_e T_{\\min})}{k_e T_{\\min}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-y)}{y} $$\nLet's calculate the dimensionless constant on the left side:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{safe}} V_{\\mathrm{d}}}{D} = \\frac{(4.00 \\text{ mg/L})(20 \\text{ L})}{100 \\text{ mg}} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8 $$\nSo we must solve the equation:\n$$ 0.8 = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-y)}{y} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\exp(-y) + 0.8y - 1 = 0$. This equation has a trivial solution $y=0$ (corresponding to $T_{\\min}=0$, the bolus case which we know fails) and a second, non-zero root. This non-zero root must be found numerically, for example using the Newton-Raphson method. Let $f(y) = \\exp(-y) + 0.8y - 1$. The numerical solution for the non-zero root yields $y \\approx 0.46441$.\n\nNow we can find $T_{\\min}$ from $y = k_e T_{\\min}$:\n$$ T_{\\min} = \\frac{y}{k_e} = \\frac{y \\cdot t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} $$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{0.46441 \\times 3.00 \\text{ h}}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{1.39323 \\text{ h}}{0.693147} \\approx 2.0100 \\text{ h} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in minutes, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx 2.0100 \\text{ h} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{h}} \\approx 120.60 \\text{ min} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $121$ minutes.",
