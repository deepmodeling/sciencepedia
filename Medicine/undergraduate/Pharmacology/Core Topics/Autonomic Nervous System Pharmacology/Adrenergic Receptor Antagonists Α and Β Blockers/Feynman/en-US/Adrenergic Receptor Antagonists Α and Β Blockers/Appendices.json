            "introduction": "The journey of understanding any antagonist begins at the molecular level. A drug's clinical utility is defined by its affinity for its intended target receptor and its selectivity, which is its ability to avoid binding to off-target receptors. This exercise  provides a foundational practice in translating raw binding data, such as the inhibition constant ($K_i$), into clinically meaningful metrics like the selectivity index and receptor occupancy. By doing so, you can learn to predict a drug's behavior in the body based on its inherent molecular properties and a given plasma concentration.",

Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: calculation of the selectivity index, determination of the free drug concentration, and calculation of the fractional occupancies for each receptor subtype.\n\n**1. Calculation of the $\\beta_1$ Selectivity Index ($\\mathrm{SI}_{\\beta_1}$)**\n\nThe selectivity index for the $\\beta_1$ receptor is defined as the ratio of the drug's affinity for the $\\beta_2$ receptor to its affinity for the $\\beta_1$ receptor. Using the given inhibition constants as a measure of affinity (where a lower $K_i$ indicates higher affinity), the selectivity index is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SI}_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{K_{i,\\beta_2}}{K_{i,\\beta_1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SI}_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{50.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 10.0\n$$\nAs the problem requires rounding to four significant figures, this value is expressed as $10.00$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Steady-State Free Molar Concentration ($[L]$)**\n\nFirst, the total plasma concentration, given in mass-per-volume units, must be converted to molar concentration.\nThe total plasma concentration is $C_{p,total} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ng\\,mL^{-1}}$. We convert this to units of $\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$:\n$$\nC_{p,total} = 80\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ng}}{\\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{g}}{10^9\\,\\mathrm{ng}} \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{1\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}\n$$\nNext, we use the molecular weight, $M_w = 300\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, to convert the mass concentration to molar concentration ($C_{p,total,molar}$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$):\n$$\nC_{p,total,molar} = \\frac{C_{p,total}}{M_w} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}}{300\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{3.00 \\times 10^2}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = \\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the free concentration of the ligand, $[L]$, which is active at the receptor site, is equal to the free plasma concentration. This is calculated using the fraction unbound, $f_u = 0.10$:\n$$\n[L] = f_u \\times C_{p,total,molar} = 0.10 \\times \\left(\\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}\n$$\nFor consistency with the units of $K_i$ ($\\mathrm{nM}$), we convert $[L]$ to nanomolar ($1\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$):\n$$\n[L] = \\left(\\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}\\right) \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}} = \\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^1\\,\\mathrm{nM} = \\frac{80}{3}\\,\\mathrm{nM}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy ($\\theta_{\\beta_1}$ and $\\theta_{\\beta_2}$)**\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is given by the formula $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$. Based on the assumption that $K_d \\approx K_i$, we can calculate the occupancy for each receptor subtype.\n\nFor the $\\beta_1$ receptor:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{i,\\beta_1}}\n$$\nSubstituting $[L] = \\frac{80}{3}\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i,\\beta_1} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{80}{3} + 5.0} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{80}{3} + \\frac{15}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{95}{3}} = \\frac{80}{95} = \\frac{16}{19}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\theta_{\\beta_1} \\approx 0.842105...$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.8421$.\n\nFor the $\\beta_2$ receptor:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\beta_2} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{i,\\beta_2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $[L] = \\frac{80}{3}\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i,\\beta_2} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\beta_2} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{80}{3} + 50.0} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{80}{3} + \\frac{150}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{3}}{\\frac{230}{3}} = \\frac{80}{230} = \\frac{8}{23}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\theta_{\\beta_2} \\approx 0.347826...$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.3478$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the selectivity index, the $\\beta_1$ occupancy, and the $\\beta_2$ occupancy, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\mathrm{SI}_{\\beta_1} = 10.00$\n$\\theta_{\\beta_1} = 0.8421$\n$\\theta_{\\beta_2} = 0.3478$",

Cardiolex exhibits simple $1:1$ reversible binding to receptors governed by the law of mass action and is competitive with endogenous catecholamines, which you may neglect at rest for the purpose of this calculation. Assume that target tissue (airway and sinoatrial node) free drug concentration equals the steady-state average free plasma concentration.\n\nKnown properties of Cardiolex and the patient population are as follows:\n- Dissociation constant at $\\beta_{1}$ receptors: $K_{d,\\beta_{1}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n- Dissociation constant at $\\beta_{2}$ receptors: $K_{d,\\beta_{2}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n- Molecular weight: $\\mathrm{MW} = 300\\ \\mathrm{g}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- Oral bioavailability: $F = 0.90$.\n- Unbound (free) fraction in plasma: $f_{u} = 0.10$.\n- Apparent systemic clearance: $\\mathrm{CL} = 20\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Dosing interval at steady state: $\\tau = 12\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n\nIn moderate asthma, define “clinically significant $\\beta_{2}$ antagonism” as occurring when the fractional occupancy of $\\beta_{2}$ receptors by Cardiolex reaches $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} = 0.20$.\n\nUsing only fundamental receptor binding based on the law of mass action and steady-state mass balance for a one-compartment model with linear clearance (no saturation), derive from first principles and compute the minimal per-dose amount $D_{\\text{thresh}}$ (oral dose given every $\\tau$ hours at steady state) at which $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}} = \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast}$. Express the final dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal oral dose, $D_{\\text{thresh}}$, administered every $\\tau$ hours, that results in a clinically significant fractional occupancy of $\\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors, defined as $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} = 0.20$. The solution requires a multi-step derivation that connects the pharmacodynamic effect (receptor occupancy) to the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and the prescribed dosing regimen.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main stages:\n1.  **Pharmacodynamics**: Determine the required free drug concentration, $[L]_{\\text{free}}$, that achieves the target fractional occupancy $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast}$ at the $\\beta_{2}$ receptors.\n2.  **Pharmacokinetics**: Relate this required free drug concentration to the necessary average total drug concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,avg}$, in the plasma.\n3.  **Dosing Calculation**: Use the steady-state mass balance equation for a one-compartment model to calculate the oral dose, $D_{\\text{thresh}}$, required to maintain this $C_{ss,avg}$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of Required Free Drug Concentration**\n\nThe binding of a drug (ligand, $L$) to a receptor, $R$, is a reversible process governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]} $$\nwhere $[L]$ is the concentration of the free ligand, $[R]$ is the concentration of the free receptor, and $[LR]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total receptors ($[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [LR]$) that are bound by the ligand:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[LR]}{[R] + [LR]} $$\nBy rearranging the $K_d$ equation, we have $[R] = \\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{\\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]} + [LR]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[LR]$ yields the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nWe are given that clinically significant $\\beta_{2}$ antagonism occurs when the fractional occupancy of $\\beta_{2}$ receptors, $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}$, reaches the threshold $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} = 0.20$. The problem states that the free drug concentration in the target tissue is equal to the steady-state average free plasma concentration, which we denote as $[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}$. We can set $[L] = [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}$ and apply the equation to the $\\beta_{2}$ receptor:\n$$ \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}}{K_{d,\\beta_{2}} + [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}} $$\nWe must solve for the required concentration, $[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}$.\n$$ \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} (K_{d,\\beta_{2}} + [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}) = [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} $$\n$$ \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} K_{d,\\beta_{2}} = [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} (1 - \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} = K_{d,\\beta_{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast}}{1 - \\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values $K_{d,\\beta_{2}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and $\\theta_{\\beta_{2}}^{\\ast} = 0.20$:\n$$ [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} = (50\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\left( \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} \\right) = (50\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\left( \\frac{0.20}{0.80} \\right) = (50\\ \\mathrm{nM}) \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 12.5\\ \\mathrm{nM} $$\n\n**Step 2: Conversion to Average Total Plasma Concentration**\n\nThe average total plasma concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,avg}$, is related to the average free concentration, $[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}$, by the unbound fraction in plasma, $f_u$.\n$$ [C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} = f_u \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\nTherefore, the required average total concentration is:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}}}{f_u} $$\nSubstituting the values $[C]_{\\text{free,ss,avg}} = 12.5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and $f_u = 0.10$:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{12.5\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{0.10} = 125\\ \\mathrm{nM} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Threshold Dose**\n\nFor a one-compartment model with linear clearance at steady state, the rate of drug administration that becomes systemically available is equal to the rate of drug elimination. The average rate of drug entering the systemic circulation from an oral dose $D$ with bioavailability $F$ given every dosing interval $\\tau$ is $\\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau}$. The average rate of elimination is the product of the systemic clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$, and the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate in} = \\text{Rate out} $$\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\text{thresh}}}{\\tau} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\nWe can now solve for the threshold dose, $D_{\\text{thresh}}$:\n$$ D_{\\text{thresh}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{ss,avg} \\cdot \\tau}{F} $$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure all units are consistent.
