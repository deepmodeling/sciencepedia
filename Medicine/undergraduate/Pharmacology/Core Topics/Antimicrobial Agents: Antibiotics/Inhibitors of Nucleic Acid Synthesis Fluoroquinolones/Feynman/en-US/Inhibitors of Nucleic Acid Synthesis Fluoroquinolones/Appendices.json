For fluoroquinolones, a primary mechanism of bacterial resistance involves mutations in the target enzyme, DNA gyrase, which weakens this binding. This exercise  provides a quantitative model to connect a change in binding affinity, represented by the dissociation constant ($K_d$), directly to the change in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), a crucial clinical measure of bacterial susceptibility. By working through this problem, you will gain a first-principles understanding of how molecular changes translate into observable resistance.",

            "problem": "In a Gram-negative bacterium, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin act primarily by binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gyrase, a Type II topoisomerase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Consider the binding of ciprofloxacin to DNA gyrase to be governed by the equilibrium law of mass action with dissociation constant $K_{d}$, where the fractional target occupancy is given by $f=\\frac{[A]}{[A]+K_{d}}$ and $[A]$ is the free antibiotic concentration. Define the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) as the antibiotic concentration at which a fixed threshold fractional occupancy $f^{\\ast}$ is achieved at steady state.\n\nA clinical isolate carries a gyrA Ser83Leu mutation that decreases drug affinity and increases the dissociation constant for ciprofloxacin by a factor of $10$ (i.e., $K_{d}\\to 10K_{d}$), without altering the occupancy threshold $f^{\\ast}$ for inhibition.\n\nUnder this occupancy-driven pharmacodynamic model, derive the relationship between MIC and $K_{d}$ from first principles and then determine the fold increase in MIC produced by the mutation. Express your final answer as a single fold-change factor (dimensionless). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of pharmacology and microbiology, specifically the action of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and a common mechanism of bacterial resistance. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: first, to derive the relationship between the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) based on the provided pharmacodynamic model; second, to calculate the fold increase in MIC for a mutant bacterium.\n\nLet us begin from first principles. The fractional occupancy, $f$, of the target protein (DNA gyrase) by the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) is given by the law of mass action for a simple one-to-one binding equilibrium:\n$$f = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the free concentration of the antibiotic and $K_d$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the antibiotic-target complex.\n\nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the specific antibiotic concentration, $[A]$, at which a fixed threshold fractional occupancy, $f^{\\ast}$, is achieved. By this definition, when $[A] = \\text{MIC}$, the fractional occupancy $f$ is exactly $f^{\\ast}$. Substituting these into the fractional occupancy equation gives:\n$$f^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\text{MIC}}{\\text{MIC} + K_d}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship between MIC and $K_d$, we rearrange this equation to solve for MIC.\nFirst, multiply both sides by $(\\text{MIC} + K_d)$:\n$$f^{\\ast} (\\text{MIC} + K_d) = \\text{MIC}$$\nDistribute $f^{\\ast}$ on the left-hand side:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{MIC} + f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC}$$\nTo isolate MIC, we gather all terms containing MIC on one side of the equation:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC} - f^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{MIC}$$\nFactor out MIC on the right-hand side:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC} (1 - f^{\\ast})$$\nFinally, assuming $f^{\\ast} \\neq 1$, we can divide by $(1 - f^{\\ast})$ to solve for MIC:\n$$\\text{MIC} = K_d \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\nThis equation represents the relationship between MIC and $K_d$ derived from the given model. It demonstrates that, for a constant threshold occupancy $f^{\\ast}$, the MIC is directly proportional to the dissociation constant $K_d$. The term $\\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$ is a constant of proportionality. A higher $K_d$ signifies weaker binding (lower affinity), thus requiring a higher concentration of the drug (a higher MIC) to achieve the same inhibitory effect.\n\nNow, we must determine the fold increase in MIC for a clinical isolate with a mutation. Let the parameters for the wild-type (sensitive) bacterium be denoted by $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}$ and $K_{d, \\text{WT}}$. Let the parameters for the mutant (resistant) bacterium be denoted by $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}$ and $K_{d, \\text{Mut}}$.\n\nAccording to the derived relationship, the MIC for each strain is:\n$$\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}} = K_{d, \\text{WT}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\n$$\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}} = K_{d, \\text{Mut}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\nThe problem states that the mutation does not alter the occupancy threshold $f^{\\ast}$ for inhibition.\n\nThe problem also states that the mutation increases the dissociation constant by a factor of $10$. This can be expressed as:\n$$K_{d, \\text{Mut}} = 10 \\cdot K_{d, \\text{WT}}$$\n\nThe fold increase in MIC is the ratio of the MIC of the mutant to the MIC of the wild-type:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}}{\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}$ and $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}$:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{K_{d, \\text{Mut}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}}$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$ is non-zero (since $f^{\\ast}$ must be between $0$ and $1$) and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{K_{d, \\text{Mut}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the mutant and wild-type dissociation constants:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{10 \\cdot K_{d, \\text{WT}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}}}$$\nThe term $K_{d, \\text{WT}}$ cancels out, yielding the final result:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = 10$$\nTherefore, the mutation results in a $10$-fold increase in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. This is a dimensionless factor.",

In the context of the calculated macroscopic species (cationic, zwitterionic, anionic), the zwitterion is the most permeable as it has a net charge of zero. To maximize passive diffusion, the concentration of the zwitterionic species should be maximized.\nComparing the calculated mole fractions of the zwitterion at the three given $pH$ values:\n- At $pH = 6.0$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.442$.\n- At $pH = 7.4$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.909$.\n- At $pH = 8.5$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.612$.\nThe fraction of the zwitterionic species is highest at $pH = 7.4$.

Given the units of $A_{24}$ are in $\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$, the resulting unit of time will be hours ($\\text{h}$).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{A_{24}}{M} = \\frac{20\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}}{0.25\\,\\text{mg/L}} $$\nThe calculation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{20}{0.25} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 20 \\times 4 = 80 $$\nThus, the value of the $AUC_{24}/MIC$ ratio is $80\\,\\text{h}$.

To express it with three significant figures, we write it as $80.0$.\n$$ \\frac{AUC_{24}}{MIC} = 80.0\\,\\text{h} $$\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess whether the pharmacodynamic target is achieved. The target for Gram-negative bacilli is given as $AUC/MIC \\geq 125$. While the target is often cited as a dimensionless number, the dimensional analysis shows that the quantity has units of time. Therefore, the comparison should be:\n$$ \\text{Is } 80.0\\,\\text{h} \\geq 125\\,\\text{h}? $$\nThe comparison shows that $80.0 < 125$. Therefore, the calculated PK/PD index for this patient does not meet the minimum target for predicted efficacy against the infecting organism.
