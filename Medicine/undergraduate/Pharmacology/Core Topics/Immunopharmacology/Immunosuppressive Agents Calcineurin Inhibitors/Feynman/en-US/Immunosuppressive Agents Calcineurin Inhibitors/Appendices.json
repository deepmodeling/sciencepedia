            "problem": "Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is administered orally as a single dose with absolute bioavailability $F$, dose $D$, clearance $CL$, and apparent volume of distribution $V$. Assume a one-compartment model with linear pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption relative to elimination (so that input can be treated as instantaneous at $t=0$), and first-order elimination. Use conservation of mass, the definition of clearance as the proportionality constant between elimination rate and concentration, and the definition of concentration as amount divided by volume to derive the concentration–time function $C(t)$ from first principles. Then compute the peak concentration immediately after absorption and the concentration at $t=12\\,\\text{h}$ after this single dose.\n\nGiven $F=0.25$, $D=3\\,\\text{mg}$, $CL=0.9\\,\\text{L/h}$, and $V=50\\,\\text{L}$. Report the two concentrations in $\\text{ng/mL}$, rounded to four significant figures. Provide your final answer as two numbers in the order $C_{\\text{peak}}, C_{12\\,\\text{h}}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the well-established principles of one-compartment linear pharmacokinetics, is mathematically well-posed, and all necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the concentration-time function $C(t)$ from first principles. Let $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$. The principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of the amount of drug in the body is equal to the rate of absorption minus the rate of elimination.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Absorption} - \\text{Rate of Elimination}\n$$\nThe problem states that absorption is rapid and can be treated as instantaneous at $t=0$. This implies that for $t>0$, the rate of absorption is zero. The elimination process is first-order. The rate of elimination is defined in terms of clearance ($CL$) and concentration ($C(t)$) as:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThus, for $t>0$, the mass balance equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThe concentration $C(t)$ is defined as the amount of drug $A(t)$ divided by the apparent volume of distribution $V$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the amount of drug as $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$. Since $V$ is a constant, we can substitute this expression into the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d(V \\cdot C(t))}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V} C(t)\n$$\nWe define the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_e$, as $k_e = \\frac{CL}{V}$. The differential equation is then:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_e C(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k_e dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_0^t -k_e dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -k_e t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -k_e t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general solution:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nThe initial condition $C(0)$ is the concentration immediately after the oral dose $D$ is absorbed. The bioavailable dose, which is the amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation, is $F \\cdot D$. At $t=0$, this amount is distributed in the volume $V$. Therefore, the initial concentration is:\n$$\nC(0) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V}\n$$\nDue to instantaneous absorption, this initial concentration is also the peak concentration, $C_{\\text{peak}}$.\nSubstituting $C(0)$ and $k_e$ back into the general solution, we obtain the specific concentration-time function:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nNow, we can compute the required concentrations using the given values: $F=0.25$, $D=3\\,\\text{mg}$, $CL=0.9\\,\\text{L/h}$, and $V=50\\,\\text{L}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the peak concentration, $C_{\\text{peak}}$, which occurs at $t=0$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} = C(0) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 3\\,\\text{mg}}{50\\,\\text{L}} = \\frac{0.75\\,\\text{mg}}{50\\,\\text{L}} = 0.015\\,\\text{mg/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the concentration in units of $\\text{ng/mL}$. We perform the unit conversion:\n$$\n1\\,\\text{mg} = 10^6\\,\\text{ng}\n$$\n$$\n1\\,\\text{L} = 10^3\\,\\text{mL}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} = 0.015\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{10^6\\,\\text{ng}}{1\\,\\text{mg}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{L}}{10^3\\,\\text{mL}} = 0.015 \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\text{ng}}{\\text{mL}} = 15\\,\\text{ng/mL}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $C_{\\text{peak}} = 15.00\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration at $t=12\\,\\text{h}$, denoted as $C_{12\\,\\text{h}}$. We use the derived concentration-time function:\n$$\nC(12) = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} \\times 12\\,\\text{h}\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$\n-\\frac{CL}{V} t = -\\frac{0.9\\,\\text{L/h}}{50\\,\\text{L}} \\times 12\\,\\text{h} = -0.018\\,\\text{h}^{-1} \\times 12\\,\\text{h} = -0.216\n$$\nNow, we calculate $C(12)$:\n$$\nC(12) = 15.00\\,\\text{ng/mL} \\times \\exp(-0.216)\n$$\n$$\nC(12) \\approx 15.00\\,\\text{ng/mL} \\times 0.8057306 = 12.085959\\,\\text{ng/mL}\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $C_{12\\,\\text{h}} = 12.09\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\n\nThe requested concentrations are $C_{\\text{peak}} = 15.00\\,\\text{ng/mL}$ and $C_{12\\,\\text{h}} = 12.09\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.",

The described drug-drug interaction, where ketoconazole (a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) reduces the clearance of tacrolimus (a CYP3A4 substrate), is a well-established pharmacological principle.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation of the average steady-state drug concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$, starts from the fundamental principle of mass balance.

The average rate of drug input is this amount distributed over the dosing interval:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Drug Input} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} $$\n\nFor a drug that exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, the rate of elimination at any given time $t$ is the product of the drug's clearance, $CL$, and its concentration in the measurement matrix (e.g., plasma or blood), $C(t)$.
