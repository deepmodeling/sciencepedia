            "problem": "A topical sunscreen is labeled with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) measured under standard testing conditions at an application density of $2$ mg/cm$^{2}$. In photoprotection pharmacology, a common physical starting point is that the erythemally effective ultraviolet irradiance transmitted through an absorbing film follows the Beer–Lambert law, which in its standard form states that the transmitted fraction $T$ through a uniform absorbing layer of thickness $\\ell$ and concentration $c$ is $T=\\exp(-\\epsilon c \\ell)$, where $\\epsilon$ is a constant attenuation coefficient. For a sunscreen film of uniform density on skin, the mass per unit area $m$ is related to the film thickness $\\ell$ by $m=\\rho \\ell$, where $\\rho$ is the film density, and the erythema-weighted attenuation per unit mass can be treated as a constant over the relevant band. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is defined operationally as the ratio of the minimal erythema dose without sunscreen to that with sunscreen, and in the monochromatic, erythema-weighted approximation can be treated as the reciprocal of the transmitted fraction, $\\mathrm{SPF}=1/T$.\n\nAssume a sunscreen product has a labeled $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{label}}=50$ at the reference application density $m_{\\mathrm{ref}}=2$ mg/cm$^{2}$. Using only the principles stated above, derive from first principles a general expression for $\\mathrm{SPF}(m)$ as a function of $m$ and $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\mathrm{label}}$ and use it to compute the transmitted fraction $T(m)$ and the blocked fraction $1-T(m)$ at application densities $m \\in \\{0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0\\}$ mg/cm$^{2}$. Finally, use your derived expression to predict the real-world $\\mathrm{SPF}$ when only $m=1.0$ mg/cm$^{2}$ is applied.\n\nFor reporting, provide only the predicted $\\mathrm{SPF}$ at $m=1.0$ mg/cm$^{2}$ as a unitless number rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "We begin from the Beer–Lambert law, which states that the transmitted fraction of irradiance through an absorbing layer is $T=\\exp(-\\epsilon c \\ell)$, where $\\epsilon$ is an attenuation coefficient, $c$ is the concentration, and $\\ell$ is the path length. For a uniform sunscreen film on skin, it is convenient to express attenuation per unit mass per area. Let the film have density $\\rho$ and thickness $\\ell$, so that the mass per unit area is $m=\\rho \\ell$. If the erythema-weighted effective attenuation per unit mass is constant and equal to $k$ (with units of area per mass), then the transmitted fraction as a function of application density $m$ can be written as\n$$\nT(m)=\\exp(-k m).\n$$\nThe Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is operationally defined as the ratio of minimal erythema dose without sunscreen to that with sunscreen.

Within $5$ days they develop an erythematous, scaling eruption confined to areas of application, accompanied by burning and pruritus. The eruption partially improves when the product is stopped but flares again after reintroduction. You are asked to design a diagnostic strategy to differentiate allergic contact dermatitis from irritant contact dermatitis and to identify whether urea, salicylic acid, the vehicle, or occlusion is the culprit. The strategy must specify both the timing of patch test readings and appropriate control sites.\n\nBase your reasoning on the following fundamental principles and facts:\n- Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV) reaction, requiring prior sensitization and characterized by a delayed onset and a crescendo pattern that often peaks after removal of the allergen; irritant contact dermatitis is a non-immunologic, dose-dependent toxic response that tends to peak early and then wane.\n- Standardized epicutaneous patch testing is performed on unaffected skin (typically the upper back), with test chambers under occlusion for approximately $48$ hours and clinical readings at two time points to capture delayed responses.\n- Controls help isolate whether reactions are due to specific ingredients versus the vehicle or occlusion/adhesive; vehicle-only controls and occlusion-only controls are used to distinguish vehicle and mechanical effects.\n\nWhich of the following diagnostic strategies best adheres to these principles and will most reliably distinguish allergic from irritant mechanisms in this patient?\n\nA. After the eruption fully subsides, perform standardized patch testing on the unaffected upper back using separate patches for salicylic acid and urea at guideline test concentrations in vehicle, the patient’s combined product, a vehicle-only negative control, and an occlusion-only (blank chamber) control; remove patches at $48$ hours and perform clinical readings at both $48$ and $96$ hours, interpreting a delayed crescendo at $96$ hours as allergic and an early peak with attenuation by $96$ hours as irritant.\n\nB. Perform a single occluded patch of the combined product on involved plantar skin and read once at $24$ hours; include sodium lauryl sulfate $1\\%$ as a “positive allergy control,” but omit vehicle-only and occlusion-only controls to minimize confounders.\n\nC. Perform occluded patches of the combined product on the upper back, remove them at $48$ hours, but read only once at $72$ hours; omit separate ingredient testing and vehicle-only control to reduce the number of chambers.\n\nD. Perform skin prick testing with immediate readings at $15$ minutes for salicylic acid and urea on the volar forearm, followed by a single $24$-hour closed application test of the combined product to confirm results; no controls are needed because prick testing identifies hypersensitivity.\n\nSelect the single best strategy.",
            "solution": "This problem requires designing a diagnostic strategy based on the fundamental differences between allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). The correct strategy must properly utilize patch testing, including appropriate controls and reading times, to identify both the mechanism (allergic vs. irritant) and the causative agent.\n\n- **Mechanism Differentiation:** ACD is a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction characterized by a \"crescendo\" pattern, often intensifying after the patch is removed. ICD is a direct toxic effect that is typically maximal at patch removal and then wanes. Differentiating them requires at least two reading times (e.g., at 48 hours and 72-96 hours) to observe this temporal evolution.\n- **Culprit Identification:** To determine if the reaction is to urea, salicylic acid, the vehicle, or simply occlusion, each component must be tested separately. Standardized patch testing uses separate chambers for each potential allergen at non-irritating concentrations, the vehicle alone (vehicle control), and an empty chamber (occlusion/adhesive control).\n- **Test Location:** Testing must be done on unaffected, non-irritated skin (typically the back) after the initial rash has resolved to prevent false-positive results.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n- **Option A:** Correctly follows all principles. It tests on unaffected skin after resolution, includes separate tests for active ingredients, the full product, and both vehicle and occlusion controls. Most importantly, it specifies two reading times (48h and 96h) designed to capture the temporal pattern differentiating an allergic crescendo from an irritant decrescendo.\n- **Option B:** Incorrect. It tests on involved skin, uses an insufficient single reading, and fundamentally misunderstands that sodium lauryl sulfate is a control for irritation, not allergy.\n- **Option C:** Incorrect. It omits component and vehicle controls, making it impossible to identify the culprit. The single reading time prevents differentiation between ACD and ICD.\n- **Option D:** Incorrect. It proposes skin prick testing, which is for immediate (Type I) allergies, not delayed (Type IV) contact dermatitis.\n\nTherefore, strategy A is the only one that is methodologically sound and capable of answering the clinical question.",
