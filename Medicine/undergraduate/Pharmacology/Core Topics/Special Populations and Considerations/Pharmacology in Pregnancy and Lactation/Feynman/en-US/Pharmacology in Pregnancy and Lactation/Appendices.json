In nonpregnant adults, the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$) is $50$ liters and the clearance ($CL$) is $5$ liters per hour. During late pregnancy, physiologic changes lead to expansion of plasma volume and increased renal and hepatic blood flows, so that $V_d$ increases by a factor of $1.40$ and $CL$ increases by a factor of $1.50$.\n\nAssume one-compartment, first-order elimination applies, and start from core pharmacokinetic definitions: clearance ($CL$) as the proportionality constant relating elimination rate to concentration, the elimination rate constant ($k$) linking the time course of drug amount or concentration to the exponential decay law, and the definition of elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$) as the time required for the drug amount to reduce to half.

The proportionality constant is the elimination rate constant, $k$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = -\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)\n$$\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, relates the amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma:\n$$\nA(t) = V_d \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $A(t)$ into the rate equation gives:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = k \\cdot V_d \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nClearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. It relates the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we establish a relationship between $CL$, $k$, and $V_d$:\n$$\nCL \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot V_d \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nAssuming the concentration $C(t)$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $C(t)$ to obtain:\n$$\nCL = k \\cdot V_d\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the elimination rate constant, $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{CL}{V_d}\n$$\nThe elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of drug (or its concentration) to decrease by half. For a first-order process, the concentration decay is described by the exponential function $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $C_0$ is the initial concentration.\nAt $t = t_{1/2}$, the concentration is $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $C_0$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nFinally, substituting the previously derived expression for $k$ ($k = CL/V_d$) into the equation for $t_{1/2}$ yields the required analytic relationship:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL/V_d} = \\frac{V_d \\ln(2)}{CL}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.

            "introduction": "When a lactating individual takes medication, a key question is how much drug will pass into the breast milk. This is not always a simple diffusion process; the slight difference in pH between maternal plasma (around $7.4$) and breast milk (around $7.0$) can cause certain drugs to become 'trapped' and accumulate in the milk. This practice explores the principle of ion trapping, using fundamental acid-base chemistry to quantify how a drug's chemical properties ($\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$) and this pH gradient lead to its concentration in milk.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part solution: first, the ratio of ionized fractions, and second, the total concentration ratio between milk and plasma.\n\n**Part 1: Ratio of Ionized Fractions**\n\nFirst, we must derive an expression for the ionized fraction, $f_{i}$, of a weak base. The ionized fraction is defined as the concentration of the ionized form ($\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$) divided by the total concentration ($[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$).\n$$f_{i} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo express this in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, we start with the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nRearranging gives the ratio of unionized to ionized species:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} = \\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$ and $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$. Therefore, $K_{a} = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}$ and $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$.

We can divide the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$:\n$$f_{i} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} + 1}$$\nSubstituting our derived ratio:\n$$f_{i} = \\frac{1}{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}} + 1}$$\nThis is the required expression for the ionized fraction as a function of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$.\n\nNow, we compute the ionized fraction in milk ($f_{i,m}$) and plasma ($f_{i,p}$) using the given values: $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 8.0$, $\\mathrm{pH}_{m} = 7.00$, and $\\mathrm{pH}_{p} = 7.40$.\n\nFor milk:\n$$f_{i,m} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{m} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.00 - 8.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$$\n$$f_{i,m} \\approx 0.909090...$$\nFor plasma:\n$$f_{i,p} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{p} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.40 - 8.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.6}}$$\n$$f_{i,p} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.2511886} = \\frac{1}{1.2511886} \\approx 0.799243...$$\nThe ratio of ionized fractions in milk versus plasma is:\n$$\\frac{f_{i,m}}{f_{i,p}} = \\frac{1/1.1}{1/(1+10^{-0.6})} = \\frac{1+10^{-0.6}}{1.1} \\approx \\frac{1.2511886}{1.1} \\approx 1.13744$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.137$.\n\n**Part 2: Milk-to-Plasma Total Concentration Ratio ($M/P$)**\n\nThe total drug concentration in any compartment is the sum of the unionized and ionized forms.\nTotal concentration in milk: $C_{m} = [\\mathrm{B}]_{m} + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{m}$.\nTotal concentration in plasma: $C_{p} = [\\mathrm{B}]_{p} + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{p}$.\n\nThe milk-to-plasma ratio ($M/P$) is $\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}}$.\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_{m} + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{m}}{[\\mathrm{B}]_{p} + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{p}}$$\nThe problem states that at steady state, the concentration of the unionized base is equal in both compartments: $[\\mathrm{B}]_{m} = [\\mathrm{B}]_{p}$. Let's denote this common concentration as $[\\mathrm{B}]$. The expression becomes:\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{m}}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]_{p}}$$\nTo proceed, we need to express the ionized concentrations in terms of the unionized concentration. Rearranging the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship $\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}\\right) = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}} \\implies [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] = [\\mathrm{B}] \\times 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}}$$\nSubstituting this into the ratio expression for each compartment:\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{B}] \\times 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}_{m}}}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{B}] \\times 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}_{p}}}$$\nFactoring out $[\\mathrm{B}]$ from the numerator and denominator and canceling yields the final expression for the $M/P$ ratio:\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}_{m}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a} - \\mathrm{pH}_{p}}}$$\nNow we substitute the given values:\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{8.0 - 7.00}}{1 + 10^{8.0 - 7.40}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{1.0}}{1 + 10^{0.6}}$$\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} = \\frac{1 + 10}{1 + 10^{0.6}} = \\frac{11}{1 + 10^{0.6}}$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\frac{C_{m}}{C_{p}} \\approx \\frac{11}{1 + 3.981072} = \\frac{11}{4.981072} \\approx 2.20845$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the milk-to-plasma ratio is $2.208$.\n\nThe results demonstrate the principle of \"ion trapping\": because milk is more acidic ($\\mathrm{pH}=7.00$) than plasma ($\\mathrm{pH}=7.40$), the weakly basic drug is more extensively ionized in milk. Since the charged form cannot easily cross back into the plasma, the drug becomes trapped and accumulates in the milk compartment, leading to a total concentration in milk that is more than twice that in plasma.",
