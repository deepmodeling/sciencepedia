Terminal Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**\n\nThe terminal phase of elimination is described as a first-order process. For any first-order process, the relationship between the rate constant, here denoted $\\lambda_z$, and the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is derived from the decay equation $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda_z t)$. The half-life is the time required for the concentration to decrease by half, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda_z t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda_z t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda_z t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\lambda_z t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda_z}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $\\lambda_z = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\approx 23.104906...\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the terminal half-life is $23.10$ h.\n\n**2. Extrapolated Area Under the Curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}$)**\n\nThe extrapolated area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the last quantifiable time point, $t_{\\text{last}}$, to infinity is defined by the integral:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = \\int_{t_{\\text{last}}}^{\\infty} C(t) dt\n$$\nAssuming first-order elimination from $t_{\\text{last}}$ onwards, the concentration can be modeled as $C(t) = C_{\\text{last}} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{\\text{last}}))$.

Fraction of Total AUC from Extrapolation**\n\nThis fraction is the ratio of the extrapolated AUC to the total AUC from time $t=0$ to infinity ($\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$).\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}}{\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}}\n$$\nThe total AUC is the sum of the AUC calculated from the data points up to $t_{\\text{last}}$ and the extrapolated AUC:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}} + \\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}\n$$\nFirst, we compute $\\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}}$ using the linear trapezoidal rule. This involves summing the areas of the trapezoids formed by consecutive data points $(t_i, C_i)$.\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{C_i + C_{i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i)\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n-   $i=1$: $\\text{AUC}_{0-2} = \\frac{85 + 82}{2}(2-0) = 167\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n-   $i=2$: $\\text{AUC}_{2-8} = \\frac{82 + 70}{2}(8-2) = 456\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n-   $i=3$: $\\text{AUC}_{8-24} = \\frac{70 + 40}{2}(24-8) = 880\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n-   $i=4$: $\\text{AUC}_{24-48} = \\frac{40 + 19.5}{2}(48-24) = 714\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n-   $i=5$: $\\text{AUC}_{48-72} = \\frac{19.5 + 9.35}{2}(72-48) = 346.2\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$\n\nSumming these individual areas gives $\\text{AUC}_{0-72}$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-72} = 167 + 456 + 880 + 714 + 346.2 = 2563.2\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}\n$$\nNow, we compute the total AUC, $\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = 2563.2 + 311.666... = 2874.866...\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{311.666...}{2874.866...} \\approx 0.108410...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction is $0.1084$.",

Provide a brief physiological explanation for why $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ can be low for monoclonal antibodies.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of pharmacokinetics, a core discipline of pharmacology. The concepts of bioavailability ($F$), clearance ($\\text{CL}$), area under the curve ($\\text{AUC}$), and the relationship between them under linear kinetics are fundamental. The use of a crossover study to compare IV and SC routes is standard clinical trial methodology. The specified drug class (mAb), doses, and resulting AUC values are physiologically and clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The knowns ($\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}$, $\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$, $\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}$, $\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$) and the assumptions ($F_{\\mathrm{IV}}=1$, route-independent $\\text{CL}$) are sufficient to determine the unknown ($F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$). The crossover design provides the basis for assuming that $\\text{CL}$ is constant for a subject across both administration periods, making the comparison valid.\n- **Realistic and Feasible**: The provided data are realistic. For instance, the systemic clearance can be calculated from the IV data: $\\text{CL} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2400\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}} \\approx 0.0417\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$, which is a typical value for an IgG1 mAb. The bioavailability calculation will also yield a value in a plausible range.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and realistic. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is based on the fundamental relationship in linear pharmacokinetics that connects the total drug exposure, represented by the area under the concentration-time curve ($\\text{AUC}$), to the dose administered, the bioavailability ($F$), and the systemic clearance ($\\text{CL}$). The governing equation is given as:\n$$\\text{AUC} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{\\text{CL}}$$\n\nWe can write this equation for each of the two administration routes, intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC).\n\nFor the IV route:\n$$\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{IV}} \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{CL}}$$\nBy definition, intravenous administration delivers the entire dose directly into the systemic circulation, so its bioavailability is complete. The problem explicitly states this assumption: $F_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 1$. Therefore, the equation for the IV route simplifies to:\n$$\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{CL}}$$\n\nFor the SC route:\n$$\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SC}} \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}{\\text{CL}}$$\nHere, $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ is the absolute bioavailability of the subcutaneous route, which is the fraction of the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation intact. This is the quantity we wish to determine.\n\nThe problem states that systemic clearance, $\\text{CL}$, is independent of the route of administration. This is a critical assumption, justified by the crossover study design where the same subjects receive both treatments. This allows us to treat $\\text{CL}$ as a constant that is common to both equations.\n\nWe can rearrange the IV administration equation to solve for $\\text{CL}$:\n$$\\text{CL} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}$$\nWe can also rearrange the SC administration equation to solve for $\\text{CL}$:\n$$\\text{CL} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SC}} \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}$$\nSince $\\text{CL}$ is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SC}} \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}$$\nNow, we must algebraically isolate $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ to derive the required expression. We multiply both sides by $\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ and divide by $\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}$$\nRearranging the terms to group the AUC values and the Dose values gives the final expression for $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}}}{\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}}}$$\nThis expression defines the absolute bioavailability of the SC route in terms of the measurable quantities from the study.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ using the provided data:\n- $\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 100 \\text{ mg}$\n- $\\text{Dose}_{\\mathrm{SC}} = 150 \\text{ mg}$\n- $\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 2400\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n- $\\text{AUC}_{\\mathrm{SC}} = 1200\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{1200\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}}{2400\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}} \\cdot \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{150\\,\\mathrm{mg}}$$\nThe units cancel out, as expected for the dimensionless quantity $F$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\left(\\frac{1200}{2400}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{100}{150}\\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.33333...$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SC}} \\approx 0.3333$$\nThis means that approximately $33.33\\%$ of the subcutaneously administered dose reaches the systemic circulation.\n\nFinally, we address the physiological reason for a low $F_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ for monoclonal antibodies. The calculated value of $F_{\\mathrm{SC}} \\approx 0.3333$ is indeed low and requires a biophysical explanation.\nMonoclonal antibodies, such as the IgG1 in this problem, are large protein macromolecules with a molecular weight of approximately $150 \\text{ kDa}$. After subcutaneous injection into the interstitial space, their large size prevents them from being readily absorbed directly into the blood through the endothelial junctions of capillaries. Instead, their primary route to the systemic circulation is via uptake into the lymphatic system. This process is both slow and inefficient, leading to a bioavailability significantly less than $1$ ($F_{\\mathrm{SC}} < 1$). Two main factors contribute to this pre-systemic loss:\n1.  **Incomplete Lymphatic Uptake**: A fraction of the mAb may be retained at the injection site, bound to components of the extracellular matrix, or cleared locally without ever entering a lymphatic vessel.\n2.  **Local Catabolism**: While in the interstitial fluid and during transit through the lymphatic system (which includes lymph nodes), the mAb is exposed to various degradation mechanisms. Phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells) present in the tissue and lymph nodes can internalize and catabolize the antibody. Proteolytic enzymes in the interstitium can also degrade the protein. This degradation before the mAb reaches the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct constitutes pre-systemic elimination, thereby reducing the quantity of intact, active antibody that becomes systemically available.\nThe interplay of these factors results in the characteristically low and variable subcutaneous bioavailability observed for many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

All assumptions are explicitly provided and are consistent with one another.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{\\text{ss, trough}}$) from first principles. For a one-compartment model with intravenous bolus administration, the concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ after a single dose $\\text{Dose}_0$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{V} \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $V$ is the volume of distribution and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen with a dose $\\text{Dose}_0$ administered every interval $\\tau$, the concentration accumulates.

In our formula, the expression $1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)$ in the denominator can be approximated as:\n$$1 - \\exp(-k\\tau) \\approx 1 - (1 - k\\tau) = k\\tau$$\nFor the numerator, $\\exp(-k\\tau) \\approx 1$. Applying these approximations to the exact formula yields:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough}} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{V} \\cdot 1}{k\\tau} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{kV\\tau}$$\nUsing the relationship between clearance ($\\text{CL}$), volume of distribution ($V$), and the elimination rate constant ($k = \\text{CL}/V$), we can express the trough concentration in terms of $\\text{CL}$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{(\\text{CL}/V)V\\tau} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{\\text{CL} \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThis derived relationship shows that, under the given approximation, the steady-state trough concentration is inversely proportional to the clearance ($\\text{CL}$). This expression is also recognized as the average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{ss, avg}}$.\n\n**1. Compute the fold change in CL**\n\nLet the pre-ADA state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the post-ADA state by subscript $2$. We are given $C_{\\text{ss, trough, 1}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$ and $C_{\\text{ss, trough, 2}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$. The dose $\\text{Dose}_0 = 230$ mg and dosing interval $\\tau = 7$ days are constant for both states.\n\nUsing the derived approximate relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough, 1}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{\\text{CL}_1 \\cdot \\tau}$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough, 2}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{\\text{CL}_2 \\cdot \\tau}$$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{ss, trough, 1}}}{C_{\\text{ss, trough, 2}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0 / (\\text{CL}_1 \\cdot \\tau)}{\\text{Dose}_0 / (\\text{CL}_2 \\cdot \\tau)} = \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$$\nThe fold change in clearance is $\\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$. Substituting the given concentration values:\n$$\\text{Fold change} = \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}}{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}} = 3$$\nThe clearance increases by a factor of $3$ due to the development of ADAs.\n\n**2. Determine the new weekly dose**\n\nThe objective is to find a new dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}$, that restores the steady-state trough concentration to the pre-ADA level of $30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$, under the new, higher clearance $\\text{CL}_2$.\n\nThe relationship between dose and trough concentration is linear, as assumed in the problem (\"the system is linear\"). For a fixed clearance $\\text{CL}_2$, the trough concentration is directly proportional to the dose:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough}} \\propto \\text{Dose}$$\nLet $C_{\\text{target}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$ be the desired trough concentration and $C_{\\text{current}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$ be the trough concentration with the original dose $\\text{Dose}_0 = 230$ mg under the post-ADA clearance $\\text{CL}_2$. To achieve the target concentration, the dose must be scaled by the same factor as the desired change in concentration.\n$$\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}}{\\text{Dose}_0} = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}}}{C_{\\text{current}}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}}{230\\,\\mathrm{mg}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}}{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}} = 3$$\nSolving for $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}} = 3 \\times 230\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 690\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the new dose is $690.0$ mg.\n\nTo summarize, the fold change in clearance is $3$, and the new weekly dose required to restore the original trough concentration is $690.0$ mg.",
