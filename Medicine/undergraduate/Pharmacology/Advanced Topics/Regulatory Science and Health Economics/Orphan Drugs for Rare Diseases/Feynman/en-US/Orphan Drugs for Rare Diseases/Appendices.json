            "problem": "A rare metabolic disorder is being evaluated for orphan drug designation. The epidemiologic estimate for the disorder’s point prevalence is $0.7/10{,}000$ in a country with a total population of $330 \\times 10^{6}$ individuals. Use the following foundational regulatory definitions:\n- In the European Union (EU), orphan designation applies to conditions with prevalence not exceeding $5/10{,}000$ in the European Union (EU) population, among other criteria.\n- In the United States (US), orphan designation applies to conditions affecting fewer than $200{,}000$ persons in the United States (US), among other criteria.\n\nStarting from the definition that prevalence $r$ reported as “$r$ per $10{,}000$” means an expected count of $\\frac{r}{10{,}000}$ cases per person, derive the absolute expected number of affected individuals in a national population $P$ using first principles.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is based on standard epidemiological definitions and real-world regulatory criteria for orphan drug designation. All necessary data are provided, and the objectives are clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities: the absolute expected number of affected individuals ($N$), and two indicator variables, $I_{\\mathrm{EU}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{US}}$, which represent whether the European Union (EU) and United States (US) orphan drug designation criteria are met, respectively.\n\nFirst, we derive the absolute expected number of affected individuals, $N$, in a given population.\nThe problem provides the following givens:\n-   The point prevalence of the disorder, $r = 0.7$ per $10{,}000$ individuals.\n-   The total national population, $P = 330 \\times 10^{6}$ individuals.\n\nThe problem defines that a prevalence of \"$r$ per $10{,}000$\" corresponds to a prevalence rate, which we denote as $p_{rate}$, of $\\frac{r}{10{,}000}$ cases per person.\n$$p_{rate} = \\frac{r}{10{,}000}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $r$:\n$$p_{rate} = \\frac{0.7}{10{,}000} = 0.00007$$\nThis rate represents the proportion of the population expected to have the disorder.\n\nThe absolute expected number of affected individuals, $N$, in a total population $P$ is the product of the prevalence rate and the total population size:\n$$N = p_{rate} \\times P$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{rate}$ and the value of $P$:\n$$N = \\left(\\frac{0.7}{10{,}000}\\right) \\times (330 \\times 10^{6})$$\n$$N = (0.7 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (330 \\times 10^{6})$$\n$$N = 0.7 \\times 330 \\times 10^{(-4+6)}$$\n$$N = 231 \\times 10^{2}$$\n$$N = 23{,}100$$\nThus, the absolute expected number of affected individuals is $23{,}100$.\n\nNext, we determine the value of the indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{EU}}$.\nThe EU criterion for orphan designation is that the prevalence of the condition does not exceed $5$ in $10{,}000$ people.

We compare the numerical parts of the prevalence values:\n$$0.7 \\le 5$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the EU orphan designation threshold is met. The indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{EU}}$ is assigned the value $1$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EU}} = 1$$\n\nFinally, we determine the value of the indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{US}}$.\nThe US criterion for orphan designation is that the condition affects fewer than $200{,}000$ persons.

            "problem": "A biotechnology sponsor developing an orphan-designated therapy is planning a pivotal Phase 3 trial. Qualified orphan clinical testing expenses are eligible for a federal tax credit under the United States Internal Revenue Code. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in $2017$, the Orphan Drug Tax Credit rate was reduced from $50\\%$ to $25\\%$. Consider a profitable sponsor that can fully utilize both the credit and any associated tax deductions in the year incurred. Assume:\n- The corporate income tax rate is $t = 0.21$.\n- Qualified clinical testing expenses that do not receive a credit are fully tax-deductible in the year incurred.\n- The Internal Revenue Code’s “no double benefit” rule applies, so the tax deduction is reduced by the amount of any credit claimed.\n- Ignore all carrybacks, carryforwards, and any state taxes.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of a tax credit (a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability) and a tax deduction (a reduction in taxable income that yields a tax shield equal to the deduction multiplied by the tax rate), derive from first principles a general expression for the net after-tax cost of an eligible Phase 3 clinical spend of size $E$ when the credit rate is $c$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated by dissecting its components and assessing them against the required criteria.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Topic: Orphan-designated therapy, Phase 3 trial, federal tax credit.\n- Older credit rate: $50\\%$\n- Current credit rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $2017$: $c = 25\\%$ (This will be used as $c = 0.25$).\n- The sponsor is profitable and can fully utilize credits and deductions.\n- Corporate income tax rate: $t = 0.21$.\n- Qualified clinical testing expenses that do not receive a credit are fully tax-deductible.\n- \"No double benefit\" rule: The tax deduction is reduced by the amount of any credit claimed.\n- Simplifications: Ignore carrybacks, carryforwards, and state taxes.\n- Task 1: Derive a general expression for the net after-tax cost of an eligible spend of size $E$ with a credit rate $c$.\n- Task 2: Explain qualitatively how reducing the credit rate from $c = 0.50$ to $c = 0.25$ changes the breakeven pre-tax cost threshold for a trial, assuming a fixed expected after-tax benefit.\n- Task 3: Compute the net after-tax cost for an eligible spend of $E = 80$ million USD, with $c = 0.25$ and $t = 0.21$. Round to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in corporate finance and tax accounting, which are rule-based systems that can be modeled mathematically. The concepts of tax credits, tax deductions, and specific tax code provisions (Orphan Drug Tax Credit, \"no double benefit\") are factually accurate and based on the United States Internal Revenue Code. The problem is scientifically and factually sound within this domain.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary variables ($E$, $c$, $t$) and rules to derive the required formula and perform the calculation. The tasks are specific and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language. It is free of subjectivity or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided rules (e.g., how to calculate the deductible amount) are clear and consistent. The instruction to ignore certain complexities (carryforwards, state taxes) ensures the problem is solvable with the given data.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic. The tax rate and credit rate are accurate post-$2017$ reform. Calculating the after-tax cost of R&D investments is a standard and critical activity for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-structured, self-contained, and realistic problem in applied financial mathematics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $E$ be the total pre-tax qualified clinical testing expense.\nLet $c$ be the Orphan Drug Tax Credit rate.\nLet $t$ be the corporate income tax rate.\n\nThe net after-tax cost, which we will denote as $C_{net}$, is the initial expense minus any tax benefits. The tax benefits come from two sources: the tax credit and the tax deduction.\n\n1.  **Tax Credit**: A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of tax liability. The amount of the credit is calculated by applying the credit rate $c$ to the eligible expense $E$.\n    $$ \\text{Credit} = cE $$\n\n2.  **Tax Deduction and Tax Shield**: A tax deduction reduces taxable income. The problem states that the tax deduction is reduced by the amount of any credit claimed (the \"no double benefit\" rule). Therefore, the amount of the expense that is deductible is the total expense $E$ minus the portion on which the credit was claimed. Since the credit applies to the entire expense $E$, the value of the credit is $cE$. The rule is typically interpreted as reducing the deductible expense basis by the amount of the credit. Thus, the deductible amount is $E - cE$.\n    $$ \\text{Deductible Amount} = E - cE = E(1 - c) $$\n    The tax saving resulting from this deduction is called the tax shield. The tax shield is the deductible amount multiplied by the tax rate $t$.\n    $$ \\text{Tax Shield} = (E - cE)t = E(1-c)t $$\n\n3.  **Total Tax Benefit**: The total tax benefit is the sum of the tax credit and the tax shield.\n    $$ \\text{Total Benefit} = \\text{Credit} + \\text{Tax Shield} = cE + E(1-c)t $$\n\n4.  **Net After-Tax Cost ($C_{net}$)**: The net after-tax cost is the initial pre-tax expense $E$ minus the total tax benefit. This completes the derivation of the general expression required by the first part of the problem.\n    $$ C_{net} = E - \\text{Total Benefit} $$\n    $$ C_{net} = E - [cE + E(1-c)t] $$\n    We can simplify this expression by factoring out $E$:\n    $$ C_{net} = E [1 - (c + (1-c)t)] $$\n    $$ C_{net} = E [1 - c - t + ct] $$\n    This expression can be further factored:\n    $$ C_{net} = E [(1 - c) - t(1 - c)] $$\n    $$ C_{net} = E(1 - c)(1 - t) $$\n    This is the general expression for the net after-tax cost of an eligible spend $E$.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation of Breakeven Threshold\n\nThe breakeven point for an investment occurs when its cost equals its benefit. Let $B_{AT}$ represent the fixed, expected after-tax benefit from a successful drug approval. Let $E_{BE}$ be the breakeven pre-tax cost threshold for the trial. At breakeven, the net after-tax cost equals the after-tax benefit:\n$$ C_{net} = B_{AT} $$\nUsing our derived expression for $C_{net}$:\n$$ E_{BE}(1 - c)(1 - t) = B_{AT} $$\nWe can solve for the breakeven pre-tax cost threshold, $E_{BE}$:\n$$ E_{BE} = \\frac{B_{AT}}{(1 - c)(1 - t)} $$\nIn this equation, $B_{AT}$ and $t$ are considered fixed constants. The credit rate $c$ is the variable of interest, changing from the old rate $c_{old} = 0.50$ to the new rate $c_{new} = 0.25$.\n\nWhen the credit rate $c$ is reduced, the term $(1 - c)$ in the denominator increases. Since $(1-c)$ is in the denominator, an increase in its value causes the overall value of the fraction to decrease. Therefore, reducing the credit rate $c$ **lowers** the breakeven pre-tax cost threshold $E_{BE}$.\n\nQualitatively, the tax credit acts as a government subsidy that reduces the effective cost of R&D. A higher credit rate ($c = 0.50$) provides a larger subsidy, making more expensive projects (higher $E$) economically viable for a given expected future benefit ($B_{AT}$). When the subsidy is reduced (the credit rate drops to $c = 0.25$), the after-tax cost of any given project increases. To maintain profitability and meet the same breakeven condition against the fixed future benefit, the sponsor must now pursue less expensive projects. In effect, the threshold of what is considered an economically feasible pre-tax trial expenditure becomes lower.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nFinally, we compute the net after-tax cost for the specified spend under the new regulations.\nGiven:\n- Eligible spend: $E = 80$ million USD\n- Credit rate: $c = 0.25$\n- Tax rate: $t = 0.21$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$ C_{net} = E(1 - c)(1 - t) $$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$ C_{net} = 80 \\times (1 - 0.25)(1 - 0.21) $$\n$$ C_{net} = 80 \\times (0.75)(0.79) $$\n$$ C_{net} = 60 \\times 0.79 $$\n$$ C_{net} = 47.4 $$\nThe result is $47.4$ million United States dollars. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $47.4$ already has three significant figures.",
