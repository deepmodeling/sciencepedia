A common challenge is interpreting safety data when an adverse event of concern is very rare and zero events are observed even in a large cohort.

After $n=8{,}000$ distinct patients have been exposed, there are $0$ observed AEs of the specific outcome under surveillance.

Use the rare-event approximation that the binomial distribution with small $p$ and large $n$ is well approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = n p$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The problem statement provides all necessary data: a sample size of $n=8000$ patients, an observed event count of $k=0$ for a serious adverse event (AE), and the instruction to use a Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution. The task is to derive and calculate a one-sided $95\\%$ upper confidence bound for the event probability $p$, and to interpret the result in a pharmacovigilance context. The scenario and methods are standard in pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of AEs observed among $n$ exposed patients. The problem states that $X$ follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim B(n, p)$, where $p$ is the true but unknown probability of an AE for a single patient.\n\nFor rare events (small $p$) and a large number of trials (large $n$), the binomial distribution can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu)$, where the mean $\\mu$ is given by $\\mu = np$. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^k}{k!}$$\nIn this problem, we have observed $k=0$ events. The probability of observing exactly $0$ events, given a mean $\\mu$, is:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^0}{0!} = e^{-\\mu}$$\nsince $\\mu^0=1$ and by definition $0!=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of a one-sided $95\\%$ upper confidence bound, denoted as $p_U$. This bound is defined by the condition that the probability of observing $0$ events is equal to the significance level $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$, if the true event probability were $p_U$. Let $\\mu_U$ be the mean of the Poisson distribution corresponding to this upper bound, so $\\mu_U = n p_U$. The condition is thus:\n$$P(X=0 | \\mu=\\mu_U) = 0.05$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(X=0)$:\n$$e^{-\\mu_U} = 0.05$$\nTo solve for $\\mu_U$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(e^{-\\mu_U}) = \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$-\\mu_U = \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$\\mu_U = -\\ln(0.05)$$\nThis expression can be rewritten using logarithm properties as $\\mu_U = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right) = \\ln(20)$. The value $\\mu_U \\approx 2.9957$ is the basis for the \"Rule of Three\" in epidemiology, which provides a quick approximation for the upper limit of a $95\\%$ confidence interval when zero events are observed.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the upper bound on the probability, $p_U$, using the relationship $\\mu_U = n p_U$:\n$$p_U = \\frac{\\mu_U}{n}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_U$, we obtain the general formula derived from first principles:\n$$p_U = \\frac{-\\ln(0.05)}{n}$$\nWith the given sample size of $n=8000$, we can evaluate this bound:\n$$p_U = \\frac{-\\ln(0.05)}{8000}$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed as the expected number of AEs per $10{,}000$ exposed patients. This rate, which we can denote $R_{10k}$, is calculated by multiplying the per-patient probability $p_U$ by $10{,}000$:\n$$R_{10k} = 10{,}000 \\times p_U = 10{,}000 \\times \\frac{-\\ln(0.05)}{8000}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives:\n$$R_{10k} = \\frac{10{,}000}{8000} \\times (-\\ln(0.05)) = 1.25 \\times (-\\ln(0.05))$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$R_{10k} \\approx 1.25 \\times 2.99573227 \\approx 3.74466534$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, as requested, yields $3.74$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a brief explanation of the implications of this finding.\n\nThe calculated one-sided $95\\%$ upper confidence bound for the AE rate is $3.74$ per $10{,}000$ patients. This means that while no events were observed, we can be $95\\%$ confident that the true underlying AE rate is no greater than $3.74$ per $10{,}000$. The provisional decision rule considers adding a warning if the true incidence exceeds $1$ per $10{,}000$. Our confidence interval for the rate is $[0, 3.74]$ per $10{,}000$. Since this interval contains values greater than the threshold of $1$ per $10{,}000$, we cannot, with $95\\%$ confidence, rule out the possibility that the true AE rate is above this action threshold. The observation of zero events in $8{,}000$ patients is insufficient to provide assurance that the drug's risk is below the level of concern. Therefore, a decision to escalate a warning might be considered, or at a minimum, enhanced and continued surveillance would be strongly warranted.\n\nRegarding continuous sequential monitoring, the calculation of this bound assumes a fixed, predetermined sample size of $n=8000$. If safety data are reviewed repeatedly as they accumulate (e.g., after each block of $1000$ patients), this constitutes multiple statistical testing. Performing a test at a fixed $\\alpha=0.05$ level at each \"look\" inflates the overall Type I error rate (the probability of a false alarm) across the entire surveillance period to be much higher than $5\\%$. To maintain an overall $\\alpha$ of $0.05$, methods for sequential analysis must be employed, which use more stringent significance boundaries (e.g., Pocock or O'Brien-Fleming boundaries). Interpreting the bound calculated here as if it were from a fixed-sample study would be misleadingly optimistic early in surveillance; a proper sequential boundary for the same overall confidence level would be higher, reflecting the greater uncertainty at smaller sample sizes and correcting for the multiple looks.",

Let's compute each term separately.\n\nFor the exposed group ($A=1$):\n$$\nP(Y=1 \\mid A=1, H=1) = \\frac{P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=1) P(Y=1 \\mid A=1)}{P(H=1 \\mid A=1)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=1) \\times P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) = 0.50 \\times 0.10 = 0.05$.\nThe denominator, $P(H=1 \\mid A=1)$, is found using the law of total probability, marginalizing over $Y$:\n$$\nP(H=1 \\mid A=1) = P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=1)P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) + P(H=1 \\mid Y=0, A=1)P(Y=0 \\mid A=1)\n$$\nWe know $P(Y=0 \\mid A=1) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n$$\nP(H=1 \\mid A=1) = (0.50)(0.10) + (0.08)(0.90) = 0.05 + 0.072 = 0.122\n$$\nTherefore, the first term of the risk difference is:\n$$\nP(Y=1 \\mid A=1, H=1) = \\frac{0.05}{0.122} = \\frac{50}{122} = \\frac{25}{61}\n$$\n\nFor the unexposed group ($A=0$):\n$$\nP(Y=1 \\mid A=0, H=1) = \\frac{P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=0) P(Y=1 \\mid A=0)}{P(H=1 \\mid A=0)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=0) \\times P(Y=1 \\mid A=0) = 0.20 \\times 0.10 = 0.02$.\nThe denominator, $P(H=1 \\mid A=0)$, is found similarly:\n$$\nP(H=1 \\mid A=0) = P(H=1 \\mid Y=1, A=0)P(Y=1 \\mid A=0) + P(H=1 \\mid Y=0, A=0)P(Y=0 \\mid A=0)\n$$\nWe know $P(Y=0 \\mid A=0) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid A=0) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n$$\nP(H=1 \\mid A=0) = (0.20)(0.10) + (0.02)(0.90) = 0.02 + 0.018 = 0.038\n$$\nTherefore, the second term of the risk difference is:\n$$\nP(Y=1 \\mid A=0, H=1) = \\frac{0.02}{0.038} = \\frac{20}{38} = \\frac{10}{19}\n$$\n\nNow we can compute $\\text{RD}_{H=1}$:\n$$\n\\text{RD}_{H=1} = \\frac{25}{61} - \\frac{10}{19} = \\frac{25 \\times 19 - 10 \\times 61}{61 \\times 19} = \\frac{475 - 610}{1159} = -\\frac{135}{1159}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the signed collider bias, $\\text{Bias}$, which is the difference between the risk difference observed in the hospitalized-only cohort and the true risk difference.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\text{RD}_{H=1} - \\text{RD}_{\\text{true}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = -\\frac{135}{1159} - 0 = -\\frac{135}{1159}\n$$\nTo provide the numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} \\approx -0.11647972...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} \\approx -0.1165\n$$\nThis non-zero bias demonstrates how conditioning on a common effect (a collider) of two independent causes (exposure and the adverse event) can induce a spurious statistical association between them. In this case, it creates the false appearance of a protective effect of the drug among hospitalized patients.",
