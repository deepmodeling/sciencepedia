This is a core concept in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and welfare economics. The values provided are realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem statement is clear, and all necessary data for the calculation are provided: the amount of each payment ($C$), the number of payments ($n$), the timing of the payments (at the end of each year, i.e., an ordinary annuity), and the discount rate ($r$). A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, unbiased language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity).

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the present value ($PV$) of a series of future costs. The specified cost stream is a uniform series of payments made at the end of each period, which is defined as an ordinary annuity. The calculation will be based on first principles of discrete discounting.\n\nLet $C$ be the constant annual cost, $r$ be the annual discount rate, and $n$ be the total number of years over which the cost is incurred. The present value of a single cost $C$ paid at the end of year $t$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$PV_t = \\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}$$\n\nThe total present value of the entire cost stream is the sum of the present values of each of the $n$ individual payments. The payments are made at the end of years $t=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Annual cost $C = 1000$ USD.\n-   Annual discount rate $r = 0.03$.\n-   Number of payments $n = 5$.\n\nSubstituting these into the summation:\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^{t}}$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant cost $C$:\n\n$$PV = C \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t}$$\n\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{1}{1+r}$ and common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is given by $S_n = a \\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$.\n\nApplying this formula to our summation:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{n}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying the denominator: $1 - \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1+r-1}{1+r} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} $$\n\nThis yields the standard formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:\n\n$$PV = C \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} \\right]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this formula:\n$$C = 1000$$\n$$r = 0.03$$\n$$n = 5$$\n\n$$PV = 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV = 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right]$$\n\nFirst, calculate the term $(1.03)^{-5}$:\n$$(1.03)^{-5} \\approx 0.862608784$$\n\nNext, substitute this value back into the equation:\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - 0.862608784}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\left[ \\frac{0.137391216}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times 4.579707186$$\n$$PV \\approx 4579.707186$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $4579.707186$. The first four significant digits are $4, 5, 7, 9$. The fifth significant digit is $7$. Since $7 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit. Thus, $4579$ is rounded up to $4580$.\n\nThe present value of the cost stream is $4580$ USD.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a cost-utility analysis of three mutually exclusive interventions. The analysis is conducted from the health system payer perspective, with costs measured in United States dollars (USD) and effects in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The fundamental steps involve ordering the interventions by effectiveness, eliminating dominated alternatives, and then calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the remaining options.\n\nThe provided data for the three alternatives are:\n- Standard care ($A$): Cost $C_A = \\$8,000$, Effect $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs.\n- Add-on therapy ($B$): Cost $C_B = \\$12,500$, Effect $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs.\n- Alternative therapy ($C$): Cost $C_C = \\$14,000$, Effect $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n**1. Order Alternatives by Effectiveness**\nThe first step is to order the interventions from the least effective to the most effective, based on their expected QALYs.\n- $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs\n- $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs\n- $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs\n\nThe order of increasing effectiveness is $A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow B$. We can tabulate the alternatives in this order:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Alternative} & \\text{Cost } (C) & \\text{Effect } (E) \\\\\n\\hline\nA & \\$8,000 & 0.75 \\\\\nC & \\$14,000 & 0.79 \\\\\nB & \\$12,500 & 0.80 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**2. Identify Dominated Alternatives**\nNext, we must check for dominance. An alternative is strictly dominated if there is another alternative that is both more effective and less costly. An alternative is extendedly dominated if it has an ICER greater than that of a more effective alternative.\n\nLet's compare the costs and effects of the alternatives in their effectiveness order.\n- Compare Alternative $A$ and Alternative $C$: Alternative $C$ is more effective ($E_C > E_A$) and more costly ($C_C > C_A$). Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare Alternative $C$ and Alternative $B$: Alternative $B$ is more effective than Alternative $C$ ($E_B = 0.80 > E_C = 0.79$). At the same time, Alternative $B$ is less costly than Alternative $C$ ($C_B = \\$12,500 < C_C = \\$14,000$).\n\nSince Alternative $B$ provides a greater health benefit for a lower cost compared to Alternative $C$, Alternative $B$ strictly dominates Alternative $C$. A rational decision-maker would never choose Alternative $C$ when Alternative $B$ is available. Therefore, Alternative $C$ must be eliminated from further consideration.\n\n**3. Calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\nAfter removing the dominated Alternative $C$, we are left with two non-dominated alternatives: $A$ (Standard care) and $B$ (Add-on therapy).\n- Alternative $A$: $C_A = \\$8,000$, $E_A = 0.75$\n- Alternative $B$: $C_B = \\$12,500$, $E_B = 0.80$\n\nThe ICER is calculated for the more effective option ($B$) relative to the next less effective option ($A$). The formula for the ICER is the change in cost divided by the change in effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A}\n$$\n\nWe compute the incremental cost and incremental effect:\n- Incremental Cost ($\\Delta C$):\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_B - C_A = \\$12,500 - \\$8,000 = \\$4,500\n$$\n- Incremental Effect ($\\Delta E$):\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_B - E_A = 0.80 \\text{ QALYs} - 0.75 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.05 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\$4,500}{0.05 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$90,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\n\nThe result is an ICER of $90,000$ USD/QALY. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $90,000$ can be written in scientific notation to explicitly show this precision.\n$$\n90,000 = 9.000 \\times 10^4\n$$\nThis value represents the additional cost required to gain one additional quality-adjusted life year by choosing Add-on therapy ($B$) over Standard care ($A$).",
