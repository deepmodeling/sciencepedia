            "solution": "The problem as stated will be validated against the required criteria before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and conditions explicitly provided are:\n- A multicenter, Phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) is conducted.\n- The trial compares a new lipid-lowering drug against a placebo.\n- The outcome is a composite cardiovascular endpoint over a fixed follow-up period.\n- The observed event probability (risk) in the control (placebo) arm is $p_{0}=0.2$.\n- The observed event probability (risk) in the treatment arm is $p_{1}=0.14$.\n- The quantities to be computed are:\n    1. Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)\n    2. Relative Risk (RR)\n    3. Odds Ratio (OR)\n    4. Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for benefit\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and biostatistics, which are central to pharmacology and clinical trial analysis. The concepts of ARR, RR, OR, and NNT are standard, well-defined metrics for quantifying treatment effects. The provided risk values, $p_0=0.2$ and $p_1=0.14$, are plausible for a cardiovascular outcomes trial.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($p_0$ and $p_1$) to calculate the four requested metrics using their standard mathematical definitions. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It presents quantitative data and asks for the calculation of standard metrics without introducing any subjective or ambiguous elements.\n- **Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. The condition that the treatment reduces risk is confirmed by the data, as $p_1 < p_0$.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of four standard metrics used in evidence-based medicine to describe the outcome of a clinical trial. The given quantities are the risk in the control group, $p_0 = 0.2$, and the risk in the treatment group, $p_1 = 0.14$.\n\n1.  **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**\n    The ARR is the simple arithmetic difference in the event rates between the control and treatment groups. It quantifies the absolute decrease in risk attributable to the treatment. The definition is:\n    $$\n    \\text{ARR} = p_0 - p_1\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\text{ARR} = 0.2 - 0.14 = 0.06\n    $$\n\n2.  **Relative Risk (RR)**\n    The RR, also known as the risk ratio, is the ratio of the risk of an event in the treatment group to the risk in the control group. An RR less than $1$ indicates that the treatment reduces the risk. The definition is:\n    $$\n    \\text{RR} = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\text{RR} = \\frac{0.14}{0.2} = \\frac{14}{20} = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7\n    $$\n\n3.  **Odds Ratio (OR)**\n    The OR is the ratio of the odds of an event in the treatment group to the odds of an event in the control group. The odds of an event with probability $p$ is defined as $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\n    First, we calculate the odds for each group:\n    - Odds in the control group, $O_0$:\n      $$\n      O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.2}{1-0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n      $$\n    - Odds in the treatment group, $O_1$:\n      $$\n      O_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} = \\frac{0.14}{1-0.14} = \\frac{0.14}{0.86} = \\frac{14}{86} = \\frac{7}{43}\n      $$\n    The OR is the ratio of these odds:\n    $$\n    \\text{OR} = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} = \\frac{7/43}{1/4} = \\frac{7}{43} \\times 4 = \\frac{28}{43}\n    $$\n    As the problem requires an exact answer, the rational number $\\frac{28}{43}$ is the precise form.\n\n4.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n    The NNT represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome. For a treatment that is beneficial (i.e., reduces risk), the NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR. The definition is:\n    $$\n    \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}}\n    $$\n    Using the calculated value of ARR:\n    $$\n    \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.06} = \\frac{1}{6/100} = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3}\n    $$\n    Again, the exact fraction is the appropriate form for the answer.\n\nThe four required quantities, in the specified order $(\\text{ARR}, \\text{RR}, \\text{OR}, \\text{NNT})$, are $(0.06, 0.7, \\frac{28}{43}, \\frac{50}{3})$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and comparison of statistical power for a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) under two different sample size allocation schemes. It also asks for a justification of when an imbalanced allocation might be optimal.\n\nLet $\\mu_T$ and $\\mu_C$ be the true mean changes in systolic blood pressure for the treatment and control arms, respectively.

This defines the rejection region as:\n$$ |\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}} $$\n\nStatistical power ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. We evaluate power under a specific alternative hypothesis where the true mean difference is a clinically meaningful amount, $|\\mu_T - \\mu_C| = \\Delta$. Under this alternative, the distribution of the difference in sample means is:\n$$ \\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\Delta, \\sigma^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}\\right)\\right) $$\nPower is the probability that the observed difference falls into the rejection region, given this alternative distribution:\n$$ \\text{Power} = P\\left( \\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}} \\bigg| \\mu_T-\\mu_C = \\Delta \\right) + P\\left( \\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}} \\bigg| \\mu_T-\\mu_C = \\Delta \\right) $$\nTo compute these probabilities, we standardize the variable $\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C$ using its distribution under $H_A$. Let $Z'$ be a standard normal variable.\n$$ Z' = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) - \\Delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}} $$\nRearranging for $\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C$ and substituting into the inequalities for the rejection region:\n$$ \\text{Power} = P\\left( Z' > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}} \\right) + P\\left( Z' < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}} \\right) $$\nLet $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

The given parameters are $N=300$, $\\sigma=10$, $\\Delta=2$, and $\\alpha=0.05$. For $\\alpha=0.05$, the critical value is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$.\n\nCase 1: Equal allocation ($n_T = 150, n_C = 150$)\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{150} + \\frac{1}{150}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{150}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{75}} $$\nThe effect size argument for the power function is:\n$$ \\delta_1 = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}} = \\frac{2}{10 \\sqrt{1/75}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{75}}{10} = \\frac{\\sqrt{25 \\cdot 3}}{5} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{5} = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205 $$\nThe power for equal allocation is:\n$$ \\text{Power}_1 = \\Phi(\\sqrt{3} - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-\\sqrt{3} - 1.95996) $$\n$$ \\text{Power}_1 = \\Phi(1.73205 - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-1.73205 - 1.95996) $$\n$$ \\text{Power}_1 = \\Phi(-0.22791) + \\Phi(-3.69201) \\approx 0.40985 + 0.00011 = 0.40996 $$\n\nCase 2: Unequal allocation ($n_T = 200, n_C = 100$)\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+2}{200}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{200}} $$\nThe effect size argument is:\n$$ \\delta_2 = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}} = \\frac{2}{10 \\sqrt{3/200}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{200}}{10 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10 \\sqrt{2}}{10 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\approx 1.63299 $$\nThe power for unequal allocation is:\n$$ \\text{Power}_2 = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3} - 1.95996\\right) + \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3} - 1.95996\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Power}_2 = \\Phi(1.63299 - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-1.63299 - 1.95996) $$\n$$ \\text{Power}_2 = \\Phi(-0.32697) + \\Phi(-3.59295) \\approx 0.37189 + 0.00016 = 0.37205 $$\n\nThe absolute difference in power is:\n$$ |\\text{Power}_1 - \\text{Power}_2| = |0.40996 - 0.37205| = 0.03791 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the difference is $0.0379$.\n\nJustification for Optimal Allocation:\nStatistical power is a monotonically increasing function of the effect size argument, $|\\delta|$. To maximize power, we must maximize $|\\delta|$, which for fixed $\\Delta$ and $\\sigma$ is equivalent to minimizing the standard error of the mean difference, or equivalently, its variance:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) = \\sigma^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}\\right) $$\nWe analyze two optimization scenarios.\n\n1. Fixed Total Sample Size ($N$):\nThe objective is to minimize $V(n_T, n_C) = \\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}$ subject to the constraint $n_T + n_C = N$. We can express $n_C$ as $N - n_T$ and minimize the function of one variable:\n$$ V(n_T) = \\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{N - n_T} $$\nTaking the derivative with respect to $n_T$ and setting it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dn_T} = -\\frac{1}{n_T^2} + \\frac{1}{(N-n_T)^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{n_T^2} = \\frac{1}{(N-n_T)^2} \\implies n_T^2 = (N-n_T)^2 $$\nSince sample sizes must be positive, this implies $n_T = N - n_T$, which gives $2n_T = N$, or $n_T = N/2$. Consequently, $n_C = N/2$. The second derivative is positive, confirming a minimum. Thus, for a fixed total sample size and equal variances in both arms, statistical power is maximized with equal allocation ($n_T = n_C$). This explains why the $150/150$ allocation yielded higher power than the $200/100$ allocation.\n\n2. Fixed Total Cost ($C_0$):\nIn practice, the cost per subject may differ between arms. Let $c_T$ and $c_C$ be the costs per subject in the treatment and control arms, respectively. The total cost is fixed: $C_0 = c_T n_T + c_C n_C$. The optimization problem is to minimize the variance $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{n_T} + \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{n_C}$ subject to this cost constraint. (We generalize to possibly unequal variances $\\sigma_T^2, \\sigma_C^2$ for completeness).\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers, the Lagrangian function is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(n_T, n_C, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{n_T} + \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{n_C} + \\lambda(c_T n_T + c_C n_C - C_0) $$\nTaking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_T} = -\\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{n_T^2} + \\lambda c_T = 0 \\implies n_T^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{\\lambda c_T} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_C} = -\\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{n_C^2} + \\lambda c_C = 0 \\implies n_C^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{\\lambda c_C} $$\nDividing the first expression by the second:\n$$ \\frac{n_T^2}{n_C^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2 / (\\lambda c_T)}{\\sigma_C^2 / (\\lambda c_C)} = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2 c_C}{\\sigma_C^2 c_T} $$\nThe optimal allocation ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{n_T}{n_C} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_T^2 c_C}{\\sigma_C^2 c_T}} = \\frac{\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_C} \\sqrt{\\frac{c_C}{c_T}} $$\nThis shows that an imbalanced allocation is optimal if either the costs per arm or the outcome variances per arm are unequal. Specifically, to maximize power for a fixed budget, more subjects should be allocated to the arm that is less expensive or exhibits lower variance. If variances and costs are equal ($\\sigma_T = \\sigma_C$ and $c_T = c_C$), the ratio becomes $1$, leading back to equal allocation. The assumption in the problem was $\\sigma_T = \\sigma_C$, so in that context, imbalanced allocation is optimal if and only if $c_T \\neq c_C$.",

The log risk ratio is $y_i = \\ln(RR_i)$.\nThe variance of the log risk ratio, $v_i$, is estimated using the asymptotic formula for binomial data:\n$$v_i = \\frac{1}{a_i} - \\frac{1}{n_{iT}} + \\frac{1}{c_i} - \\frac{1}{n_{iC}}$$\nSince none of the event counts $a_i$ or $c_i$ are zero, no continuity correction is necessary.\n\n- **Study 1**:\n$y_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{24/200}{36/190}\\right) = \\ln(0.6333\\dots) \\approx -0.4564$\n$v_1 = \\frac{1}{24} - \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{36} - \\frac{1}{190} \\approx 0.05918$\n\n- **Study 2**:\n$y_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{15/150}{22/145}\\right) = \\ln(0.6590\\dots) \\approx -0.4169$\n$v_2 = \\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{1}{150} + \\frac{1}{22} - \\frac{1}{145} \\approx 0.09856$\n\n- **Study 3**:\n$y_3 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{40/300}{55/295}\\right) = \\ln(0.7151\\dots) \\approx -0.3353$\n$v_3 = \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{55} - \\frac{1}{295} \\approx 0.03646$\n\n- **Study 4**:\n$y_4 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{48/220}{28/210}\\right) = \\ln(1.6363\\dots) \\approx 0.4925$\n$v_4 = \\frac{1}{48} - \\frac{1}{220} + \\frac{1}{28} - \\frac{1}{210} \\approx 0.04724$\n\n- **Study 5**:\n$y_5 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{18/160}{27/155}\\right) = \\ln(0.6458\\dots) \\approx -0.4372$\n$v_5 = \\frac{1}{18} - \\frac{1}{160} + \\frac{1}{27} - \\frac{1}{155} \\approx 0.07989$\n\n**Step 2: Quantify heterogeneity**\n\nTo apply the DerSimonian-Laird method, we first need to quantify the between-study heterogeneity using Cochran's $Q$ statistic. This requires calculating fixed-effect weights, $w_i = 1/v_i$.\n\nThe fixed-effect weights are:\n$w_1 = 1/0.05918 \\approx 16.897$\n$w_2 = 1/0.09856 \\approx 10.146$\n$w_3 = 1/0.03646 \\approx 27.428$\n$w_4 = 1/0.04724 \\approx 21.168$\n$w_5 = 1/0.07989 \\approx 12.517$\n\nCochran's $Q$ is calculated as $Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i (y_i - \\hat{\\theta}_{FE})^2$, where $\\hat{\\theta}_{FE} = (\\sum w_i y_i) / (\\sum w_i)$ is the pooled estimate under a fixed-effect model. A more direct computational formula for $Q$ is:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i^2 - \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$\nCalculating the required sums:\n$\\sum w_i \\approx 88.158$\n$\\sum w_i y_i \\approx -16.188$\n$\\sum w_i y_i^2 \\approx 15.893$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $Q$:\n$$Q \\approx 15.893 - \\frac{(-16.188)^2}{88.158} \\approx 15.893 - 2.972 = 12.921$$\nThe degrees of freedom for $Q$ are $df = k-1 = 5-1=4$. Since $Q > 4$, there is evidence of heterogeneity.\n\nThe DerSimonian-Laird estimator for the between-study variance, $\\hat{\\tau}^2$, is given by:\n$$\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q - (k-1)}{C}\\right)$$\nwhere $C = \\sum w_i - \\frac{\\sum w_i^2}{\\sum w_i}$. We need $\\sum w_i^2 \\approx 1745.56$.\n$$C \\approx 88.158 - \\frac{1745.56}{88.158} \\approx 88.158 - 19.799 = 68.359$$\nNow we compute $\\hat{\\tau}^2$:\n$$\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\frac{12.921 - 4}{68.359} = \\frac{8.921}{68.359} \\approx 0.1305$$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the random-effects pooled estimate**\n\nUnder the random-effects model, the weights for each study, $w_i^*$, are adjusted to include the between-study variance:\n$$w_i^* = \\frac{1}{v_i + \\hat{\\tau}^2}$$\n- $w_1^* = 1/(0.05918 + 0.1305) \\approx 5.272$\n- $w_2^* = 1/(0.09856 + 0.1305) \\approx 4.366$\n- $w_3^* = 1/(0.03646 + 0.1305) \\approx 5.990$\n- $w_4^* = 1/(0.04724 + 0.1305) \\approx 5.626$\n- $w_5^* = 1/(0.07989 + 0.1305) \\approx 4.753$\n\nThe random-effects pooled log risk ratio, $\\hat{\\theta}_{RE}$, is the weighted average of the individual log risk ratios using these new weights:\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{RE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i^* y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i^*}$$\nCalculating the quantities:\n$\\sum w_i^* \\approx 26.007$\n$\\sum w_i^* y_i \\approx (5.272 \\times -0.4564) + \\dots + (4.753 \\times -0.4372) \\approx -5.546$\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{RE} \\approx \\frac{-5.546}{26.007} \\approx -0.21326$$\nThe pooled risk ratio, $RR_{RE}$, is obtained by back-transforming the pooled log risk ratio:\n$$RR_{RE} = \\exp(\\hat{\\theta}_{RE}) = \\exp(-0.21326) \\approx 0.80795$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the pooled risk ratio is $0.808$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the inconsistency statistic $I^2$**\n\nThe $I^2$ statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. It is calculated from $Q$:\n$$I^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q-(k-1)}{Q}\\right)$$\nUsing our values for $Q$ and $k$:\n$$I^2 = \\frac{12.921 - 4}{12.921} = \\frac{8.921}{12.921} \\approx 0.6904$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the inconsistency statistic $I^2$ is $0.690$.\n\nThe two required quantities are the pooled risk ratio ($RR_{RE}$) and the inconsistency statistic ($I^2$).\n- Pooled risk ratio: $0.808$\n- Inconsistency statistic $I^2$: $0.690$",
