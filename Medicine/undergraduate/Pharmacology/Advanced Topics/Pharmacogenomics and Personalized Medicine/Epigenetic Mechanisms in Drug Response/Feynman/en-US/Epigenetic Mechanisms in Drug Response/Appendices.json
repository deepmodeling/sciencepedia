            "problem": "A pharmacology laboratory is studying how epigenetic promoter methylation modulates the transcriptional response of ATP Binding Cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) to a chemotherapeutic exposure. Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) reports an average promoter methylation fraction $M$ (the fraction of CpG sites methylated in the promoter region, with $0 \\leq M \\leq 1$). Before exposure, the promoter methylation fraction is $M_{\\text{before}} = 0.25$. After a single drug exposure, WGBS shows a relative increase in promoter methylation of $0.20$, so that $M_{\\text{after}} = M_{\\text{before}} \\times (1 + 0.20)$. Assume that methylation represses transcription by recruiting methyl-CpG binding repressors so that the promoter alternates between an unbound (transcription-permissive) state and a bound (repressed) state. Under equilibrium binding with cooperative effects of methylated CpG sites, model the repressor occupancy with the Hill–Langmuir isotherm: the fraction of promoter in the bound state is $\\theta(M) = \\dfrac{(M/M_{50})^{n}}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}}$, where $M_{50}$ is the methylation level at half-maximal occupancy and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. Take $M_{50} = 0.30$ and $n = 3$. Assume that the gene’s mean transcriptional output $E(M)$ is proportional to the fraction of time the promoter is unbound by the repressor, with proportionality constant $E_{0}$ equal to the expression in the limit of zero methylation.\n\nUsing these principles, derive an expression for the fold-change in expression $F = \\dfrac{E(M_{\\text{after}})}{E(M_{\\text{before}})}$ in terms of $M_{\\text{before}}$, $M_{50}$, and $n$, and then evaluate $F$ numerically for the given values. Express the fold-change as a dimensionless decimal ratio and round your final answer to four significant figures.",

All conditions and data are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is a valid application of biophysical modeling to a pharmacological question. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in the transcriptional output of the ABCB1 gene following a drug-induced change in its promoter methylation level. We are given a model that connects the promoter methylation fraction, $M$, to gene expression, $E(M)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between gene expression and promoter state. The problem states that the mean transcriptional output $E(M)$ is proportional to the fraction of time the promoter is in the unbound, transcription-permissive state. The proportionality constant is $E_0$, which represents the maximal expression level when methylation is zero ($M=0$). The fraction of promoter in the bound (repressed) state is given by the Hill–Langmuir isotherm, $\\theta(M)$. Since the promoter can only be in one of two states, bound or unbound, the fraction of time it is unbound is $1 - \\theta(M)$.\n\nTherefore, the transcriptional output as a function of methylation is:\n$$\nE(M) = E_0 \\times (1 - \\theta(M))\n$$\n\nThe expression for $\\theta(M)$ is given as:\n$$\n\\theta(M) = \\frac{(M/M_{50})^{n}}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}}\n$$\nwhere $M_{50}$ is the methylation level at half-maximal repressor occupancy and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the unbound fraction gives:\n$$\n1 - \\theta(M) = 1 - \\frac{(M/M_{50})^{n}}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}} = \\frac{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n} - (M/M_{50})^{n}}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}} = \\frac{1}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}}\n$$\n\nThus, the expression for the mean transcriptional output is:\n$$\nE(M) = E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (M/M_{50})^{n}} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in expression, defined as $F = \\frac{E(M_{\\text{after}})}{E(M_{\\text{before}})}$. Using the expression for $E(M)$, we can write $F$ as:\n$$\nF = \\frac{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (M_{\\text{after}}/M_{50})^{n}} \\right)}{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (M_{\\text{before}}/M_{50})^{n}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe constant $E_0$ cancels, yielding the general expression for the fold-change:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1 + (M_{\\text{before}}/M_{50})^{n}}{1 + (M_{\\text{after}}/M_{50})^{n}}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the values of $M_{\\text{before}}$ and $M_{\\text{after}}$ from the problem statement. We are given:\n-   The initial promoter methylation fraction: $M_{\\text{before}} = 0.25$.\n-   A relative increase in methylation of $0.20$ after drug exposure.\n\nThe methylation fraction after exposure, $M_{\\text{after}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\nM_{\\text{after}} = M_{\\text{before}} \\times (1 + 0.20) = 0.25 \\times 1.20 = 0.30\n$$\n\nWe are also given the model parameters:\n-   The methylation level at half-maximal occupancy: $M_{50} = 0.30$.\n-   The Hill coefficient: $n = 3$.\n\nNow we can substitute these numerical values into the expression for the fold-change $F$.\n\nThe term for the \"before\" state in the numerator is:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{M_{\\text{before}}}{M_{50}}\\right)^{n} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.30}\\right)^{3} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{3} = 1 + \\frac{5^3}{6^3} = 1 + \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{216}{216} + \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{341}{216}\n$$\n\nThe term for the \"after\" state in the denominator is:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{M_{\\text{after}}}{M_{50}}\\right)^{n} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{0.30}{0.30}\\right)^{3} = 1 + (1)^{3} = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThis result is expected, as $M_{\\text{after}}$ equals $M_{50}$, the point of half-maximal effect.\n\nNow, we compute the fold-change $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\frac{341}{216}}{2} = \\frac{341}{216 \\times 2} = \\frac{341}{432}\n$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nF = \\frac{341}{432} \\approx 0.78935185...\n$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nF \\approx 0.7894\n$$\nThis result indicates that the transcriptional output has decreased to approximately $78.94\\%$ of its initial level due to the drug-induced increase in promoter methylation.",
