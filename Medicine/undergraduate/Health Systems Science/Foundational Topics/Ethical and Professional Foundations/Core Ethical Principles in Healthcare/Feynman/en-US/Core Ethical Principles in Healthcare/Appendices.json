            "problem": "A health system is considering implementing a new population-wide diagnostic screening test for a serious but treatable condition. The ethical assessment must be grounded in the principles of beneficence (promote benefit), nonmaleficence (minimize harm), respect for autonomy (ensure informed participation), and justice (allocate resources fairly). To evaluate net clinical value under harm minimization, model the following scenario using fundamental definitions from diagnostic testing and probability.\n\nAssume the test has sensitivity $S$ and specificity $C$. The screened population has size $N$, and the disease prevalence is $\\pi$. Each false positive is ethically assessed to impose an expected harm $h_{\\mathrm{fp}}$ due to anxiety and unnecessary follow-up. Each false negative imposes an expected harm $h_{\\mathrm{fn}}$ due to delayed treatment. Each true positive yields an expected benefit $b_{\\mathrm{tp}}$ due to prompt treatment, and each true negative yields an expected benefit $b_{\\mathrm{tn}}$ due to reassurance and avoidance of unnecessary care. Screening everyone incurs an opportunity cost of $r$ per person reflecting the justice principle of resource stewardship.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions of sensitivity ($S$), specificity ($C$), prevalence ($\\pi$), and the law of total probability, derive the expected numbers of false positives and false negatives in the screened population. Then, starting from the harm minimization and beneficence framework above, construct a single closed-form analytic expression for the net clinical value $V$ as a function of $S$, $C$, $N$, $\\pi$, $h_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, $h_{\\mathrm{fn}}$, $b_{\\mathrm{tp}}$, $b_{\\mathrm{tn}}$, and $r$, defined as total expected benefits minus total expected harms minus total resource costs.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of diagnostic test evaluation and health economics, well-posed with all necessary variables defined for a symbolic derivation, and objective in its language. The task is a formalizable mathematical exercise directly relevant to health systems science. It does not violate any criteria for invalidity.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the expected number of individuals in each of the four possible outcomes of the screening test, and then using these numbers to construct the net clinical value expression.\n\nLet $N$ be the total size of the screened population.\nLet $\\pi$ be the prevalence of the disease.\n\nThe number of individuals with the disease (Diseased, D+) is $N_D = N\\pi$.\nThe number of individuals without the disease (Healthy, H) is $N_H = N(1-\\pi)$.\n\nThe properties of the diagnostic test are given by its sensitivity $S$ and specificity $C$.\nSensitivity, $S$, is the probability that a person with the disease tests positive: $S = P(T+|D+)$.\nSpecificity, $C$, is the probability that a person without the disease tests negative: $C = P(T-|H)$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\nThe probability of a false negative (a diseased person testing negative) is $P(T-|D+) = 1 - S$.\nThe probability of a false positive (a healthy person testing positive) is $P(T+|H) = 1 - C$.\n\nUsing these probabilities, we can calculate the expected number of individuals in each of the four outcome categories:\n1.  **True Positives ($N_{\\mathrm{TP}}$)**: Diseased individuals who test positive.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{TP}} = N_D \\times P(T+|D+) = (N\\pi) \\times S = N\\pi S$$\n2.  **False Negatives ($N_{\\mathrm{FN}}$)**: Diseased individuals who test negative.

            "problem": "A critical care team is considering whether to continue invasive life support for a 78-year-old patient with refractory multi-organ failure. A validated prognostic model, calibrated in similar populations, estimates the probability of a clinically meaningful recovery (defined as regaining the ability to live at home with acceptable functional independence and willingness to accept the resulting health state) as $P(\\text{meaningful recovery}) = 0.02$, with a 95% credible interval of $[0.005, 0.03]$. If the patient recovers meaningfully, their expected remaining life-years are $4$ with an average health-related quality of life utility of $0.5$, yielding an expected 2 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), where a QALY is defined as a year of life adjusted by health-related quality on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health). Continuing invasive support for $7$ more days would consume one bed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and cost $\\$70{,}000$ in direct hospital expenditures.\n\nThere is one patient in the Emergency Department (ED), aged 58, who requires ICU-level care for septic shock and for whom clinicians estimate a $P(\\text{meaningful recovery}) = 0.6$ if admitted to the ICU now. If this second patient recovers meaningfully, their expected remaining life-years are $10$ with an average health-related quality of life utility of $0.8$, yielding 8 QALYs. The hospital has one ICU bed available, currently occupied by the first patient.\n\nThe first patient has an advance directive stating they would accept intensive treatments only if the chance of meaningful recovery is at least 5%, and otherwise prefer a transition to comfort-focused care.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid application of quantitative reasoning to a complex ethical dilemma in healthcare. It is grounded in the established principles of medical ethics and the tools of decision science and health economics, such as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness analysis. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data to construct and evaluate a decision threshold.\n\nThe core task is to determine a quantitative futility threshold, $\\alpha$, for the probability of meaningful recovery, below which continued invasive support for Patient 1 (P1) would be deemed futile. This threshold must integrate four core ethical principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.\n\nLet's analyze the situation based on the provided data and principles.\n\n**1. Principle of Autonomy:**\nThe patient's advance directive is the most direct expression of their autonomy. It states that intensive treatments should be pursued only if the chance of meaningful recovery is at least $5\\%$.\nThis provides a clear, patient-centered threshold. If we are to respect the patient's stated wishes, the threshold $\\alpha$ should be $0.05$.\n$P(\\text{meaningful recovery}) < 0.05 \\implies \\text{transition to comfort care}$.\nThe current estimated probability for P1 is $P_1 = 0.02$, which is less than the patient's stated minimum of $0.05$. Therefore, based on the principle of autonomy, treatment should be withdrawn.\n\n**2. Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence:**\nBeneficence is the duty to do good. The potential benefit to P1 is a recovery yielding $2$ QALYs. The expected benefit is the probability of recovery multiplied by the benefit if recovery occurs.\n$E[\\text{QALYs for P1}] = P_1 \\times (\\text{QALYs if recovered}) = 0.02 \\times 2 = 0.04$ QALYs.\nThis is a very low expected benefit.\nNonmaleficence is the duty to do no harm. Continuing invasive life support is burdensome and carries risks. Furthermore, forcing treatment on a patient who has explicitly refused it under these circumstances can be considered a harm (a violation of their personal integrity and autonomy).\n\n**3. Principle of Justice (Distributive Justice and Opportunity Cost):**\nJustice requires a fair allocation of scarce resources. The constrained resource here is the single ICU bed. The opportunity cost of continuing to use the bed for P1 is the forgone benefit to Patient 2 (P2), who is waiting in the Emergency Department.\nThe expected benefit for P2, if admitted, is:\n$E[\\text{QALYs for P2}] = P_2 \\times (\\text{QALYs if recovered}) = 0.6 \\times 8 = 4.8$ QALYs.\nComparing the expected benefits:\n- For P1: $0.04$ QALYs\n- For P2: $4.8$ QALYs\nThe expected benefit from giving the bed to P2 is $4.8 / 0.04 = 120$ times greater than the expected benefit of continuing to treat P1. The principle of justice, which considers the efficient and fair use of resources to maximize overall health benefit, provides a powerful argument for reallocating the bed to P2.\n\n**4. Societal Cost-Effectiveness Framework:**\nThe hospital policy endorses a cost-effectiveness benchmark of $\\$100,000$ per QALY. The cost of continuing treatment for P1 is $C = \\$70,000$. The cost per expected QALY gained is:\n$\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}}{E[\\text{QALYs}]} = \\frac{C}{P(\\text{recovery}) \\times 2}$\nFor the treatment to be considered cost-effective, ICER must be less than or equal to the willingness-to-pay threshold:\n$\\frac{\\$70,000}{P(\\text{recovery}) \\times 2} \\le \\$100,000$\nSolving for $P(\\text{recovery})$:\n$P(\\text{recovery}) \\ge \\frac{\\$70,000}{2 \\times \\$100,000} = \\frac{70,000}{200,000} = 0.35$\nThis framework suggests a futility threshold of $\\alpha = 0.35$ from a societal resource-use perspective. P1's actual probability of $0.02$ is far below this.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\nThe problem asks for the best threshold $\\alpha$ that integrates these considerations.\n- The patient's own threshold is $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- The societal cost-effectiveness threshold is $\\alpha = 0.35$.\n- The justice argument (opportunity cost) strongly favors reallocation, especially when P1's probability is as low as $0.02$.\n\nA robust ethical threshold should, whenever possible, align with the patient's own values. Here, the patient has provided an explicit threshold of $\\alpha=0.05$. This threshold respects autonomy. Conveniently, in this case, it also aligns with the principles of justice and cost-effectiveness. Since $0.02 < 0.05 < 0.35$, all frameworks point to the same conclusion: withdrawal of invasive support. Setting the threshold at $\\alpha=0.05$ honors the patient's directive as the primary guide, and is strongly supported by the considerations of justice, as continuing treatment for a probability below this patient-defined minimum incurs a massive and ethically indefensible opportunity cost.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Set $\\alpha = 0.05$ because the patient’s advance directive identifies $5\\%$ as the minimum acceptable probability, and justice considerations indicate that the opportunity cost of blocking an ICU bed for a patient with much higher expected benefit is ethically impermissible when $P(\\text{meaningful recovery})$ is below $0.05$.**\nThis option correctly identifies $\\alpha = 0.05$ from the patient's advance directive, thus respecting the principle of autonomy. It correctly links this patient-centered threshold to the principle of justice, arguing that the high opportunity cost becomes ethically decisive when the probability falls below the patient's own standard of what is acceptable. This represents an excellent integration of the required principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Set $\\alpha = 0.25$ based solely on the hospital’s societal cost-effectiveness benchmark of $\\$100{,}000$ per QALY and the $2$ QALYs at stake, since continuing care costs $\\$70{,}000$ and therefore any probability lower than $25\\%$ is not cost-effective.**\nThis option contains a mathematical error. As calculated above, the break-even probability for cost-effectiveness is $P=0.35$ or $35\\%$, not $25\\%$. The value $\\alpha=0.25$ is incorrect. Furthermore, its justification relies \"solely\" on a single framework, ignoring the explicit instruction to integrate the core ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Set $\\alpha = 0.01$ to avoid premature withdrawal, giving a conservative margin below the model’s point estimate, thereby prioritizing beneficence over autonomy and justice in the face of uncertainty.**\nThis option proposes a threshold of $\\alpha=0.01$. Since the patient's current probability is $P_1=0.02$, this threshold would lead to continuing treatment. This action directly violates the patient's advance directive (autonomy), which sets a minimum of $0.05$. It also ignores the enormous opportunity cost (justice). The justification of prioritizing \"beneficence\" is weak, as the expected benefit is a mere $0.04$ QALYs, and it neglects the maleficence of continuing a highly burdensome and unwanted intervention. This does not represent a balanced integration of principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Do not specify a numerical $\\alpha$ and instead rely on qualitative clinical judgment case-by-case because rigid thresholds are incompatible with individualized care and may be unjust in practice.**\nThis option refutes the premise of the question. The task is specifically to \"construct a quantitative futility threshold as an $\\alpha$\". While there is a valid ethical debate about the role of rigid rules versus clinical judgment, this response circumvents the analytical task required by the problem. It fails to engage with the provided quantitative data and decision frameworks as instructed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A provides the most ethically and quantitatively sound threshold by grounding it in the principle of autonomy and reinforcing it with the principle of justice, achieving the requested integration of values and frameworks.",

            "problem": "A respiratory pandemic surge has created a resource constraint in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). One ventilator is in use by Patient A, a 68-year-old with irreversible multi-organ failure, a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and a clinician-estimated survival probability of approximately 1% with continued ventilation over the next $48$ hours. Patient A is alert, has decisional capacity, and explicitly requests to remain on the ventilator. Two new patients, Patient B (34 years old) and Patient C (29 years old), present with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from a potentially reversible pneumonia. Based on current evidence and triage modeling, each has an estimated survival probability of approximately 85% if promptly ventilated within the next $2$ hours; without ventilation, both are expected to die within that window. No additional ventilators are available for at least $24$ hours. The hospital has enacted publicly transparent Crisis Standards of Care (CSC), with a triage policy that authorizes reallocation of life-sustaining equipment when expected benefit differences exceed a predetermined threshold and when due process, non-discrimination, and mitigation of harm (including immediate palliative measures) are ensured.\n\nA clinician proposes withdrawing the ventilator from Patient A to reallocate it sequentially to Patient B and Patient C, with the aim of saving $2$ lives. The clinician’s stated intention is to maximize overall survival consistent with the CSC triage policy; Patient A’s death is foreseen as a near-immediate consequence of withdrawal but is not the clinician’s goal. Consider the core ethical definitions: consequentialism (outcome-based evaluation of actions by their aggregate good), deontology (duty-based evaluation emphasizing respect for persons and not using individuals merely as a means), principlism (balancing autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice), and the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE), which requires, among other conditions, that the bad effect is not intended and is not the means to the good, and that proportionality and the absence of better alternatives are satisfied.\n\nWhich option best captures the moral permissibility of withdrawing Patient A’s ventilator to save Patients B and C under these frameworks, making explicit any double-effect considerations?\n\nA. Under consequentialism, withdrawal is morally permissible given the expected aggregate survival gains (approximately $2 \\times 0.85 = 1.70$ expected lives saved versus approximately $0.01$ for Patient A), particularly when trust risks are mitigated by a transparent CSC policy; under deontology, it is impermissible because it uses Patient A merely as a means and violates a duty to respect an autonomous refusal; under principlism, it is conditionally permissible if due process ensures justice, proportionality, and mitigation of harm (e.g., immediate palliation), and the DDE may justify only if Patient A’s death is not intended and not the means to the good, with proportionality and the absence of alternatives satisfied.\n\nB. Under consequentialism, it is impermissible because autonomy always overrides outcomes; under deontology, it is permissible because duty requires maximizing lives saved; under principlism, it is impermissible because beneficence never outweighs autonomy; and the DDE clearly permits since the good numerically outweighs the bad.\n\nC. Consequentialism permits only if Patient A’s survival probability is exactly $0$; deontology permits whenever a hospital policy authorizes the act; principlism permits unconditionally in public emergencies; and the DDE is irrelevant because intention does not matter in clinical ethics.\n\nD. Consequentialism is neutral because quantitative comparisons of outcomes across persons are inadmissible; deontology renders it impermissible only if Patient A is young; principlism requires a random lottery among all three patients; and the DDE forbids any act that hastens death regardless of intent.\n\nE. Consequentialism permits but only if the clinician explicitly intends Patient A’s death; deontology permits because withdrawing non-beneficial treatment never uses a person as a means; principlism is impermissible because justice applies only at the population level, not the bedside; and the DDE permits because the intention is to kill for a greater good.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated first by a systematic examination of its components and premises.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Resource Constraint:** $1$ ventilator is currently in use. No additional ventilators will be available for at least $24$ hours.\n- **Patient A:** Age $68$. Currently using the ventilator. Diagnosis: irreversible multi-organ failure. High Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Clinician-estimated survival probability is approximately $1\\%$ (i.e., $0.01$) with continued ventilation over the next $48$ hours. Patient is alert, has decisional capacity, and explicitly requests to remain on the ventilator.\n- **Patient B:** Age $34$.

Without ventilation, death is expected within $2$ hours.\n- **Institutional Policy:** The hospital has enacted publicly transparent Crisis Standards of Care (CSC). The CSC triage policy authorizes reallocation of life-sustaining equipment under the following conditions:\n    1.  Expected benefit differences exceed a predetermined threshold.\n    2.  Due process is ensured.\n    3.  Non-discrimination is ensured.\n    4.  Mitigation of harm (including immediate palliative measures) is ensured.\n- **Proposed Action:** Withdraw the ventilator from Patient A to reallocate it to Patients B and C.\n- **Stated Intention:** The clinician's goal is to maximize overall survival. Patient A's death is a foreseen consequence, but not the goal.\n- **Ethical Frameworks Defined:**\n    - **Consequentialism:** Evaluation based on maximizing aggregate good outcomes.\n    - **Deontology:** Duty-based evaluation, emphasizing respect for persons and not using individuals merely as a means.\n    - **Principlism:** Balancing the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.\n    - **Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE):** Requires that a bad effect is not intended, is not the means to the good, and that the act is proportional and the best alternative.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Soundness:** The scenario is medically and ethically sound. It represents a classic, albeit tragic, triage dilemma encountered in disaster medicine and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The medical terminology (SOFA score, hypoxemic respiratory failure) and survival probabilities are plausible for the described clinical conditions. The ethical frameworks provided are standard in bioethics. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear conflict between ethical principles, supported by specific data and contextual rules (the CSC policy). The question asks for an analysis of the moral permissibility under defined frameworks, for which a structured and meaningful answer can be derived.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is presented using objective, clinical language, avoiding sensationalism or bias. It defines the ethical terms to be used, ensuring a common basis for analysis.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information: the patients' conditions, the resource scarcity, the institutional framework (CSC), and the definitions of the ethical theories. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility:** The scenario is highly realistic and has been the subject of extensive ethical and policy debate in real-world health systems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, scientifically realistic, and objective problem in applied medical ethics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Analysis of the Ethical Dilemma\n\nThe proposed action is to withdraw the ventilator from Patient A and reallocate it to Patients B and C. We will analyze this action using the four provided ethical frameworks.\n\n**1. Consequentialist Analysis**\nConsequentialism evaluates an action based on its outcomes, aiming to produce the greatest good for the greatest number. In this context, the \"good\" is survival.\n-   **Status Quo (No Reallocation):** Patient A has an estimated survival probability of $1\\%$ or $0.01$. Patients B and C will not receive a ventilator and are expected to die, so their survival probability is $0$. The total expected number of survivors is $0.01$.\n-   **Proposed Action (Reallocation):** Patient A's ventilator is withdrawn, and their survival probability drops to $0$. Patients B and C are ventilated and each has an estimated survival probability of $85\\%$ or $0.85$. The total expected number of survivors is $0 + 0.85 + 0.85 = 1.70$.\n-   **Conclusion:** Since $1.70 > 0.01$, the action leading to $1.70$ expected survivors is strongly preferred over the status quo. A pure outcome-based consequentialist view would deem the reallocation morally permissible, and likely obligatory. The problem notes that the hospital's CSC policy is \"publicly transparent,\" which serves to mitigate secondary negative consequences like loss of public trust, further strengthening the consequentialist case for following the policy.\n\n**2. Deontological Analysis**\nDeontology focuses on duties, rules, and the intrinsic nature of an act, rather than its consequences. Key tenets include respecting persons as ends in themselves and not using them merely as means.\n-   **Duty to Patient A:** The clinician has a duty of care to Patient A, who is an existing patient. Patient A is capacitous and has explicitly requested to continue treatment. Withdrawing the ventilator against this request is a violation of Patient A's autonomy and the duty to honor their wishes.\n-   **Using as a Means:** The ventilator is made available for Patients B and C *by* taking it from Patient A. This action directly leads to the foreseeable death of Patient A for the benefit of others. This is a classic example of using one person (Patient A) merely as a means to an end (saving Patients B and C), which is a violation of the Kantian categorical imperative, a cornerstone of deontology.\n-   **Conclusion:** From a classical deontological perspective, the action is morally impermissible because it violates the duty to Patient A and treats them merely as a means to an end.\n\n**3. Principlist Analysis**\nPrinciplism involves balancing four principles: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n-   **Autonomy:** This principle supports Patient A's right to refuse the withdrawal of treatment. The proposed action violates Patient A's autonomy.\n-   **Nonmaleficence:** This principle (\"do no harm\") is violated with respect to Patient A, as the action will hasten their death.\n-   **Beneficence:** This principle (\"do good\") supports providing a significant benefit (chance at life) to Patients B and C, who would otherwise die.\n-   **Justice:** This principle, specifically distributive justice, concerns the fair allocation of scarce resources. In a public health emergency, justice often requires allocating resources to maximize benefit to the community. The CSC policy is a formal mechanism to enact this principle, ensuring the process is fair, transparent, non-discriminatory, and based on objective criteria (expected benefit).\n-   **Balancing:** In normal circumstances, autonomy and nonmaleficence would be given immense weight, likely making the action impermissible. However, the context is a public health emergency with declared CSC. In such crises, the balance often shifts. The principles of justice (fair allocation for maximal benefit) and beneficence (for the larger number) are elevated in importance. The action is therefore *conditionally permissible* under principlism, provided that the stringent procedural safeguards of the CSC policy (due process, harm mitigation via palliative care for Patient A, etc.) are strictly followed.\n\n**4. Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) Analysis**\nThe DDE assesses the permissibility of an action that has both a good and a bad effect. We test the action against the DDE's conditions:\n1.  **The act is good or neutral:** The act is \"reallocating a scarce medical resource.\" This can be considered morally neutral.\n2.  **The good effect is intended:** The clinician's stated intent is to save Patients B and C (good effect), not for Patient A to die (bad effect). This condition is met.\n3.  **The bad effect is not the means to the good effect:** This is the most problematic condition. The good effect (saving B and C) is achieved by using the ventilator. The ventilator is made available by removing it from Patient A. This removal is the direct cause of Patient A's death. It is difficult to separate the removal of the ventilator from the subsequent death of Patient A, and this removal is the necessary means to free up the ventilator. Therefore, many would argue Patient A's death (or the act that ensures it) is indeed the means to achieving the good effect. This condition is likely violated under a strict interpretation.\n4.  **Proportionality:** The good effect (saving two young people with a high chance of recovery) must be proportional to the bad effect (hastening the death of an older person with an extremely poor prognosis). The potential to save $1.70$ expected lives versus losing $0.01$ expected lives satisfies this condition.\n5.  **No better alternative:** The problem states no other ventilators are available. This condition is met.\n-   **Conclusion:** The DDE's applicability is highly questionable because of the third condition (the means). An ethical argument using the DDE would have to successfully argue that Patient A's death is a truly foreseen side effect, not the means. The analysis must acknowledge this critical point of contention.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under consequentialism, withdrawal is morally permissible given the expected aggregate survival gains (approximately $2 \\times 0.85 = 1.70$ expected lives saved versus approximately $0.01$ for Patient A), particularly when trust risks are mitigated by a transparent CSC policy; under deontology, it is impermissible because it uses Patient A merely as a means and violates a duty to respect an autonomous refusal; under principlism, it is conditionally permissible if due process ensures justice, proportionality, and mitigation of harm (e.g., immediate palliation), and the DDE may justify only if Patient A’s death is not intended and not the means to the good, with proportionality and the absence of alternatives satisfied.**\nThis option correctly summarizes the analysis under all four frameworks. It accurately calculates the consequentialist outcome, identifies the core deontological prohibitions, correctly frames the principlist approach as a conditional balancing act dependent on the CSC, and precisely identifies the key challenges and conditions for applying the DDE.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Under consequentialism, it is impermissible because autonomy always overrides outcomes; under deontology, it is permissible because duty requires maximizing lives saved; under principlism, it is impermissible because beneficence never outweighs autonomy; and the DDE clearly permits since the good numerically outweighs the bad.**\nThis option fundamentally misrepresents every framework. Consequentialism prioritizes outcomes, not autonomy. Deontology prioritizes duties and rules, not maximizing outcomes. Principlism involves balancing, and it is not true that one principle \"never\" outweighs another. The DDE has multiple conditions, not just proportionality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Consequentialism permits only if Patient A’s survival probability is exactly $0$; deontology permits whenever a hospital policy authorizes the act; principlism permits unconditionally in public emergencies; and the DDE is irrelevant because intention does not matter in clinical ethics.**\nThis option is incorrect on all counts. Consequentialism compares outcomes; the action is permissible if the outcome is better, not only if the alternative is zero. Deontology is not subservient to hospital policy; a policy can be immoral. Principlism is never unconditional. Intention is a critical concept in clinical ethics and is the cornerstone of the DDE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Consequentialism is neutral because quantitative comparisons of outcomes across persons are inadmissible; deontology renders it impermissible only if Patient A is young; principlism requires a random lottery among all three patients; and the DDE forbids any act that hastens death regardless of intent.**\nThis option is also deeply flawed. Consequentialism, by its nature, makes quantitative comparisons. Deontology's core principles are not typically age-dependent. Principlism does not universally require a lottery; other distributive justice schemes, like maximizing benefit, are also valid. The DDE is specifically designed to analyze, not categorically forbid, acts that hasten death.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Consequentialism permits but only if the clinician explicitly intends Patient A’s death; deontology permits because withdrawing non-beneficial treatment never uses a person as a means; principlism is impermissible because justice applies only at the population level, not the bedside; and the DDE permits because the intention is to kill for a greater good.**\nThis option inverts the logic of the frameworks. Consequentialism is indifferent to intention. Deontology would still grapple with the violation of autonomy, even if the treatment were deemed non-beneficial. Justice applies at both population (macro) and bedside (micro) levels. The DDE strictly forbids intending the bad effect (\"kill for a greater good\").\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
