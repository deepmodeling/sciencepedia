Any change in total spending ($S$) can be broken down into changes in average prices ($P$) and changes in the aggregate quantity of services ($Q$). This exercise  demonstrates how to use real-world aggregate data to isolate the \"quantity\" effect, which captures not just the number of services but also shifts in their complexity and technological sophistication.",

            "problem": "A state health authority is decomposing two-period spending growth into price and quantity drivers. Let total spending be $S$, the average price index be $P$, and the aggregate quantity index be $Q$, such that the accounting identity $S = P \\times Q$ holds. Assume the following empirically observed aggregates for two consecutive years: $S_0 = \\$1{,}000{,}000{,}000$, $S_1 = \\$1{,}200{,}000{,}000$, and the relevant health care price index rose by a factor of $1.15$ over the same interval. \n\nStarting from the fundamental relationship $S = \\sum_i p_i q_i$ over service categories $i$, and treating $P$ as an aggregate price index and $Q$ as an aggregate quantity index consistent with $S = P \\times Q$, derive the implied proportional change in quantity, defined as $(Q_1 - Q_0)/Q_0$, using only the information given. Then, articulate conceptually how residual growth attributed to $Q$ can arise from compositional mix changes (for example, shifts toward higher-intensity services, technology adoption, or coding intensity) even when service counts per capita may not change.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer for the implied proportional change in quantity as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard economic principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. It presents a formalizable problem in health systems science that admits a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the proportional change in an aggregate quantity index, followed by a conceptual explanation of the drivers of this change.\n\nLet $S$ represent total spending, $P$ represent an aggregate price index, and $Q$ represent an aggregate quantity index. The core accounting identity is given as:\n$$S = P \\times Q$$\nThis relationship must hold for both time periods, denoted by subscripts $0$ and $1$.\n$$S_0 = P_0 \\times Q_0$$\n$$S_1 = P_1 \\times Q_1$$\n\nThe givens are:\nInitial spending, $S_0 = \\$1,000,000,000$.\nFinal spending, $S_1 = \\$1,200,000,000$.\nThe price index ratio, $\\frac{P_1}{P_0} = 1.15$.\n\nThe objective is to find the proportional change in quantity, which is defined as $\\frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{Q_0}$. This expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} - 1$. To find this value, we first determine the ratio $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0}$.\n\nBy taking the ratio of the spending equations for the two periods, we get:\n$$\\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\frac{P_1 \\times Q_1}{P_0 \\times Q_0}$$\nThis can be rearranged to group the price and quantity ratios:\n$$\\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0}\\right)$$\nWe can solve for the quantity ratio, $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{S_1}{S_0}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe ratio of total spending is:\n$$\\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\frac{\\$1,200,000,000}{\\$1,000,000,000} = 1.2$$\nThe ratio of the price indices is given as $1.15$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the quantity ratio yields:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{1.2}{1.15}$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} \\approx 1.04347826...$$\nThe proportional change in quantity is then:\n$$\\frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{Q_0} = \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} - 1 \\approx 1.04347826... - 1 = 0.04347826...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $0.04348$.\n\nConceptually, the aggregate quantity index $Q$ is not a simple count of services. It is a value-weighted measure of service volume that reflects both the number of services and their relative resource intensity. The fundamental relationship for total spending is a sum over individual service categories $i$:\n$$S = \\sum_i p_i q_i$$\nwhere $p_i$ is the price of service $i$ and $q_i$ is the quantity of service $i$. The aggregate indices $P$ and $Q$ must be constructed such that their product equals this sum. For example, a Laspeyres quantity index is defined as $Q_L = \\frac{\\sum p_{i,0} q_{i,1}}{\\sum p_{i,0} q_{i,0}}$, which measures the change in quantities weighted by base-period prices.\n\nTherefore, the growth in $Q$ of approximately $4.35\\%$ that is not explained by the growth in the aggregate price index $P$ can arise from several factors related to compositional mix, even if the total number of services per capita remains constant. This residual is often referred to as growth in \"volume and intensity.\"\n\n$1$. **Compositional mix shifts:** The healthcare system may shift from providing a set of lower-cost services to a set of higher-cost, more resource-intensive services. For example, a shift from standard X-rays to more frequent use of MRI scans, or from general practitioner visits to specialist consultations. Even if the total number of encounters ($\\sum_i q_i$) is unchanged, if the mix shifts towards services that had a higher price in the base period ($p_{i,0}$), the numerator of a Laspeyres-type quantity index will increase, leading to a rise in $Q$.\n\n$2$. **Technology adoption:** The introduction and diffusion of new medical technologies (e.g., robotic surgery, new biologic drugs, advanced diagnostics) adds new, high-cost services to the mix. These services are resource-intensive and contribute significantly to the value-weighted quantity index $Q$, reflecting an increase in the \"intensity\" of care delivered.\n\n$3$. **Coding intensity:** This refers to the practice of billing for services using codes that represent higher complexity and reimbursement, a phenomenon sometimes called \"upcoding.\" From the perspective of the accounting identity, this appears as a shift in quantity from a lower-priced service category to a higher-priced one, thereby increasing the aggregate quantity index $Q$ without any actual change in the clinical services rendered. It is an administrative driver of measured quantity growth.\n\nIn summary, the aggregate quantity $Q$ represents the real resource use of the health system, and its growth can be driven by increases in the sheer number of services, but also by changes in the composition of those services toward a more intensive, complex, and expensive mix.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratios of post-change to baseline utilization and total spending for an ambulatory healthcare service, following an increase in the patient coinsurance rate.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the relationship between price and quantity demanded. The problem states that the service exhibits a constant uncompensated price elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon$, equal to $-0.2$. The price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the infinitesimal percentage change in quantity demanded, $Q$, to the infinitesimal percentage change in price, $P$. For a constant elasticity, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P} = \\frac{d(\\ln Q)}{d(\\ln P)} $$\nFor a non-infinitesimal change in price from $P_0$ to $P_1$, we integrate this expression:\n$$ \\int_{\\ln(Q_0)}^{\\ln(Q_1)} d(\\ln Q) = \\epsilon \\int_{\\ln(P_0)}^{\\ln(P_1)} d(\\ln P) $$\n$$ \\ln(Q_1) - \\ln(Q_0) = \\epsilon (\\ln(P_1) - \\ln(P_0)) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0}\\right) = \\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the relationship for the ratio of quantities:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)^{\\epsilon} $$\nThis is the standard formula derived from a constant-elasticity (or isoelastic) demand function of the form $Q(P) = A P^{\\epsilon}$, where $A$ is a constant scaling factor.\n\nThe problem states that the provider price is $100$ per unit. The initial coinsurance rate is $20\\%$, so the initial out-of-pocket price for the patient is $P_0 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20$. The coinsurance rate increases to $40\\%$, so the new out-of-pocket price is $P_1 = 0.40 \\times 100 = 40$. These values are consistent with the givens $P_0 = \\$20$ and $P_1 = \\$40$.\n\nThe ratio of the patient prices is:\n$$ \\frac{P_1}{P_0} = \\frac{\\$40}{\\$20} = 2 $$\nWe are given the price elasticity of demand $\\epsilon = -0.2$. Substituting these values into our derived equation for the utilization ratio:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = (2)^{-0.2} = (2)^{-1/5} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[5]{2}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} \\approx 0.87055056... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio of post-change to baseline utilization is $0.8706$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio of post-change to baseline total spending, $S_1/S_0$. Total spending $S$ is defined as the product of the fixed provider price, let's call it $P_{prov}$, and the utilization $Q$.\nThe provider price is constant at $P_{prov} = \\$100$.\nTherefore, baseline total spending is $S_0 = P_{prov} \\times Q_0 = 100 \\cdot Q_0$.\nPost-change total spending is $S_1 = P_{prov} \\times Q_1 = 100 \\cdot Q_1$.\n\nThe ratio of total spending is:\n$$ \\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\frac{100 \\cdot Q_1}{100 \\cdot Q_0} = \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} $$\nThis demonstrates that because the unit price paid to the provider is fixed, the ratio of total spending is identical to the ratio of utilization.\nThus,\n$$ \\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} \\approx 0.87055056... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio of post-change to baseline total spending is also $0.8706$.\n\nThe two required values are the ratio of utilization, $Q_1/Q_0$, and the ratio of total spending, $S_1/S_0$. Both are equal to $0.8706$ when rounded to four significant figures. The final answer must be presented as a row matrix.",
