This exercise  explores the foundational model of monopoly pricing to understand how a profit-maximizing hospital system sets prices. By deriving the optimal price and quantity, you will gain insight into how market power affects access and how pricing strategies respond to changes in operational costs and consumer price sensitivity.",

            "problem": "A single integrated hospital system is the sole provider of a standardized outpatient diagnostic test in a geographically isolated market. The system sets a uniform cash price $P$ for the test. Market demand for the test is linear and given in direct form by $Q = A - B P$, with parameters satisfying $A  0$ and $B  0$. The hospital’s technology yields constant marginal cost (MC) equal to $c$, with $0  c  \\frac{A}{B}$, and zero fixed cost (i.e., fixed cost equals $0$). Assume the hospital’s objective is to maximize economic profit.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of total revenue $R$, total cost $C$, and profit $\\pi$ (that is, $R = P \\times Q$, $C = c \\times Q$, and $\\pi = R - C$), and using only logically necessary steps that follow from these definitions and standard differentiability assumptions:\n\n1) Derive the monopoly price $P^{*}$ and the corresponding monopoly quantity $Q^{*}$ as explicit functions of $A$, $B$, and $c$.\n\n2) Using your expressions, determine how $P^{*}$ varies with $c$ and $B$ while holding $A$ fixed. State the signs of $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial c}$ and $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial B}$ and interpret these signs economically for this healthcare context in a sentence or two.\n\nExpress the final computed $P^{*}$ and $Q^{*}$ as closed-form symbolic expressions in terms of $A$, $B$, and $c$. No numerical rounding is required. Do not include units in the final expressions.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard microeconomic theory, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no violations of the validation criteria.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the economic profit, $\\pi$, of the hospital system. The core definitions are provided:\nTotal Revenue: $R = P \\times Q$\nTotal Cost: $C = c \\times Q$ (since fixed cost is zero)\nProfit: $\\pi = R - C$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for $R$ and $C$ into the profit function gives:\n$$ \\pi = (P \\times Q) - (c \\times Q) = (P - c) Q $$\nThis profit function depends on two variables, the price $P$ and the quantity $Q$. To perform the optimization, we must express profit as a function of a single variable. The market demand function, $Q = A - B P$, provides the necessary relationship. We substitute the expression for $Q$ into the profit function to express profit as a function of price, $\\pi(P)$:\n$$ \\pi(P) = (P - c)(A - B P) $$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$ \\pi(P) = A P - B P^2 - A c + B c P $$\nTo facilitate differentiation, we group the terms by powers of $P$:\n$$ \\pi(P) = -B P^2 + (A + B c) P - A c $$\nThis is a quadratic function of $P$. Given the constraint $B  0$, the coefficient of the $P^2$ term is negative ($-B  0$), which means the graph of $\\pi(P)$ is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum profit is located at the vertex of this parabola.\n\n1) To find the profit-maximizing price, $P^{*}$, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to $P$ and set it to zero. This is the first-order condition for a maximum.\n$$ \\frac{d\\pi}{dP} = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( -B P^2 + (A + B c) P - A c \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ -2 B P + (A + B c) = 0 $$\nSolving for $P$ gives the optimal monopoly price, $P^{*}$:\n$$ 2 B P = A + B c $$\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A + B c}{2 B} $$\nThis expression can also be written as $P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2}$. The problem statement provides the condition $c  \\frac{A}{B}$, which ensures that $P^{*}  c$, a necessary condition for profitable operation.\n\nTo find the corresponding monopoly quantity, $Q^{*}$, we substitute the optimal price $P^{*}$ back into the demand equation $Q = A - B P$:\n$$ Q^{*} = A - B \\left( P^{*} \\right) = A - B \\left( \\frac{A + B c}{2 B} \\right) $$\n$$ Q^{*} = A - \\frac{A + B c}{2} $$\n$$ Q^{*} = \\frac{2A - (A + B c)}{2} = \\frac{2A - A - B c}{2} $$\n$$ Q^{*} = \\frac{A - B c}{2} $$\nThe condition $c  \\frac{A}{B}$ is equivalent to $A  B c$, which ensures that the optimal quantity $Q^{*}$ is positive.\n\n2) Now we determine how the optimal price $P^{*}$ varies with the marginal cost $c$ and the demand parameter $B$. This requires calculating the partial derivatives of $P^{*}$ with respect to $c$ and $B$.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $P^{*}$ with respect to $c$, holding $A$ and $B$ constant:\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left( \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} \\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe sign of $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial c}$ is positive.\nEconomic Interpretation: An increase in the marginal cost of providing the test leads the monopolist to increase its price. Specifically, the hospital passes on exactly half of any marginal cost increase to its patients in the form of a higher price.\n\nSecond, we find the partial derivative of $P^{*}$ with respect to $B$, holding $A$ and $c$ constant:\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{A}{2} B^{-1} + \\frac{c}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial B} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} \\left( \\frac{A}{2} B^{-1} + \\frac{c}{2} \\right) = \\frac{A}{2} (-1) B^{-2} + 0 = -\\frac{A}{2B^2} $$\nGiven that $A  0$ and $B  0$ from the problem statement, both $A$ and $2B^2$ are positive quantities. Therefore, the sign of $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial B}$ is negative.\nEconomic Interpretation: The parameter $B$ measures the price sensitivity of demand. A larger value of $B$ means consumers are more responsive to price changes. If demand becomes more price-sensitive (i.e., $B$ increases), the hospital system will lower its price to retain customers and maximize profit.",
