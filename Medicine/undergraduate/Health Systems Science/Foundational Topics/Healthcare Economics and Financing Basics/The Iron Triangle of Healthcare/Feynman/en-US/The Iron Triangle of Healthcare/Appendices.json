            "problem": "A regional hospital analyzes drivers of total spending to understand trade-offs in the Iron Triangle of healthcare, where cost interacts with access and quality. The hospital’s baseline data show an average price per inpatient case of $P_{0} = \\$5{,}000$ and a case volume of $Q_{0} = 10{,}000$. A policy is implemented that increases reimbursement rates (affecting price) and expands access (affecting volume). After implementation, the average price rises by $10\\%$ and the number of cases rises by $5\\%$.\n\nUsing only the identity that total spending equals price times quantity, that is, $S = P \\times Q$, compute:\n1. The baseline total spending $S_{0}$.\n2. The post-policy total spending $S_{1}$.\n3. An exact decomposition of the total spending change $\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0}$ into two components: one attributable to the change in price and the other attributable to the change in quantity. Construct this decomposition by isolating the change due to price while holding quantity fixed at the baseline level, and then the change due to quantity at the new price level, without using any approximations.\n\nFinally, report the fraction of the total spending change attributable to the price change as a decimal (not a percentage). Round your final answer to four significant figures. Do not include any units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded in basic economic principles as applied to health systems, and well-posed. All necessary data and definitions are provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and decomposition of total healthcare spending, defined by the identity $S = P \\times Q$, where $S$ is total spending, $P$ is the average price per case, and $Q$ is the volume of cases.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline and post-policy values for price and quantity.\n\nThe baseline values are given as:\n- Average price per case, $P_{0} = 5000$.\n- Case volume, $Q_{0} = 10000$.\n\nThe problem states that after a policy implementation, the average price rises by $10\\%$ and the number of cases rises by $5\\%$. We can calculate the new price, $P_{1}$, and new quantity, $Q_{1}$, as follows:\n$$P_{1} = P_{0} \\times (1 + \\frac{10}{100}) = P_{0} \\times 1.10 = 5000 \\times 1.10 = 5500$$\n$$Q_{1} = Q_{0} \\times (1 + \\frac{5}{100}) = Q_{0} \\times 1.05 = 10000 \\times 1.05 = 10500$$\n\nNow, we can address the three parts of the problem.\n\n1.  Compute the baseline total spending, $S_{0}$.\nUsing the given identity, we have:\n$$S_{0} = P_{0} \\times Q_{0} = 5000 \\times 10000 = 50{,}000{,}000$$\n\n2.  Compute the post-policy total spending, $S_{1}$.\nUsing the calculated post-policy values:\n$$S_{1} = P_{1} \\times Q_{1} = 5500 \\times 10500 = 57{,}750{,}000$$\n\n3.  Decompose the total spending change, $\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0}$, into components attributable to price and quantity changes.\nThe total change in spending is:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0} = 57{,}750{,}000 - 50{,}000{,}000 = 7{,}750{,}000$$\n\nThe problem specifies a particular decomposition method. The change is to be separated into two components:\n- The component due to the change in price, holding quantity fixed at the baseline level ($Q_{0}$). Let's call this $\\Delta S_{P}$.\n- The component due to the change in quantity, evaluated at the new price level ($P_{1}$). Let's call this $\\Delta S_{Q}$.\n\nLet $\\Delta P = P_{1} - P_{0}$ and $\\Delta Q = Q_{1} - Q_{0}$.\n$\\Delta P = 5500 - 5000 = 500$.\n$\\Delta Q = 10500 - 10000 = 500$.\n\nThe price-attributable component is:\n$$\\Delta S_{P} = \\Delta P \\times Q_{0} = (P_{1} - P_{0}) \\times Q_{0} = 500 \\times 10000 = 5{,}000{,}000$$\n\nThe quantity-attributable component is:\n$$\\Delta S_{Q} = \\Delta Q \\times P_{1} = (Q_{1} - Q_{0}) \\times P_{1} = 500 \\times 5500 = 2{,}750{,}000$$\n\nTo verify this decomposition, we sum the components:\n$$\\Delta S_{P} + \\Delta S_{Q} = 5{,}000{,}000 + 2{,}750{,}000 = 7{,}750{,}000$$\nThis sum exactly equals the total change $\\Delta S$, confirming the validity of the specified decomposition method: $\\Delta S = \\Delta P \\cdot Q_{0} + \\Delta Q \\cdot P_{1}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the fraction of the total spending change attributable to the price change. This fraction is the ratio of the price component to the total change:\n$$\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\Delta S_{P}}{\\Delta S} = \\frac{5{,}000{,}000}{7{,}750{,}000}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction:\n$$\\frac{5{,}000{,}000}{7{,}750{,}000} = \\frac{500}{775} = \\frac{20 \\times 25}{31 \\times 25} = \\frac{20}{31}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{20}{31} \\approx 0.64516129...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.6452$.",

            "introduction": "While the previous exercise looked at past changes, this practice explores the inherent, forward-looking trade-offs in a system with a fixed budget. When cost is held constant, any decision to improve one dimension, such as access, may impact another, like quality. This hypothetical scenario uses the economic concept of the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT) to precisely quantify the opportunity cost of reallocating resources between access and quality improvement initiatives, illustrating the core tension of the Iron Triangle.

            "problem": "A health system operates on a fixed budget and faces the Iron Triangle of Healthcare, where improvements in one domain tend to require sacrifices in another when cost is held constant. Consider two measurable outputs: a normalized access index $A$ and a normalized quality index $Q$, both scaled so that one unit represents a standardized change in the respective domain. At the current operating point, the system can reallocate $1$ unit of budget in a way that, if devoted solely to access expansion (for example, opening new primary care slots), would increase $A$ by $0.1$, or if devoted solely to quality improvement (for example, staffing and training), would increase $Q$ by $0.08$. Assume the system is operating efficiently on its production possibility frontier for $(A,Q)$ under the fixed cost constraint, and the local trade-off is linear at the margin implied by these observed increments.\n\nUsing foundational definitions from production economics, compute the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT) between access $A$ and quality $Q$ implied by this reallocation, expressed as the change in $Q$ per unit change in $A$ at the margin. Provide your answer as a pure number. No rounding is required. Then, interpret the sign and magnitude of this MRT in terms of the trade-off between $A$ and $Q$ when cost is fixed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT) between the quality index ($Q$) and the access index ($A$), expressed as the change in $Q$ for a one-unit change in $A$. This is the slope of the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF), $\\frac{dQ}{dA}$, at the current operating point.\n\nThe problem states that the system is operating efficiently on its PPF with a fixed budget. This means that to increase the output of one good (e.g., access), resources must be diverted from the production of the other good (quality). The MRT quantifies this trade-off.\n\nWe are given the marginal productivity of the budget for each output. Let the budget be denoted by $B$.\n- The marginal product of budget with respect to access is $MP_A = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta B} = \\frac{0.1}{1} = 0.1$ units of access per unit of budget.\n- The marginal product of budget with respect to quality is $MP_Q = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta B} = \\frac{0.08}{1} = 0.08$ units of quality per unit of budget.\n\nThe slope of the PPF is the negative ratio of the marginal products of the input (budget) in producing the two outputs. To move along the PPF, a small amount of budget, $dB$, is reallocated from producing $Q$ to producing $A$. This means the budget for $A$ increases by $dB$ and the budget for $Q$ decreases by $dB$. The resulting changes in $A$ and $Q$ are:\n$$dA = MP_A \\cdot dB$$\n$$dQ = MP_Q \\cdot (-dB)$$\n\nThe MRT is the ratio of these changes:\n$$\\text{MRT}_{Q,A} = \\frac{dQ}{dA} = \\frac{MP_Q \\cdot (-dB)}{MP_A \\cdot dB} = -\\frac{MP_Q}{MP_A}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\text{MRT}_{Q,A} = -\\frac{0.08}{0.1} = -0.8$$\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is in terms of opportunity cost. The cost of producing one more unit of access is the amount of quality that must be given up.\n- To increase $A$ by $1$ unit requires $1/MP_A = 1/0.1 = 10$ units of budget.\n- Reallocating these $10$ units of budget from quality production results in a loss of quality equal to $10 \\times MP_Q = 10 \\times 0.08 = 0.8$ units of $Q$.\n- Thus, the change in $Q$ per unit change in $A$ is $-0.8$.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- **Sign:** The negative sign ($-0.8$) confirms the existence of a trade-off. Because the system is on the PPF (i.e., operating efficiently with a fixed budget), increasing access ($A$) necessitates a decrease in quality ($Q$).\n- **Magnitude:** The magnitude, $0.8$, is the opportunity cost of access in terms of quality. It means that to gain $1$ additional standardized unit of access, the health system must sacrifice $0.8$ standardized units of quality.",

            "introduction": "Effectively managing a health system requires moving beyond simply identifying trade-offs to actively finding an optimal balance between them. This practice presents a realistic dilemma faced by hospital administrators: how to set a target for bed occupancy. By modeling the cost of empty beds against the quality risks of overcrowding and patient delays, you will use marginal analysis to find the occupancy rate that minimizes total social loss, providing a concrete example of how to navigate the complex interdependencies of cost, access, and quality. ",
            "id": "4399649",
            "problem": "A regional acute-care hospital is attempting to set a target bed occupancy to balance the three aims of the iron triangle of healthcare (cost, access, quality). The hospital’s leadership accepts two widely observed, foundational facts: (1) as utilization approaches full capacity, average waiting time for service in queuing systems rises nonlinearly, which increases risks of delayed treatment and care errors; and (2) unoccupied staffed beds carry an opportunity cost due to staffing, fixed overhead, and unsold capacity. They want to formalize this trade-off using marginal analysis grounded in these facts.\n\nLet the occupancy proportion be $o \\in [0,1)$, defined as the ratio of average census to staffed bed capacity. Define the expected daily monetized quality harm from congestion and delay as $H(o)$ and the expected daily cost of idle capacity as $I(o)$. To capture the nonlinearity of delay risk as capacity saturates, the hospital adopts the functional form\n$H(o) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1\\right)$,\nwhich is zero at $o=0$ and rises rapidly as $o \\to 1$. To represent the cost of idle staffed beds, they adopt\n$I(o) = \\beta(1-o)$.\n\nThese specifications are anchored to measurable quantities for a hospital with $400$ staffed beds:\n- The expected cost of an unoccupied staffed bed-day is estimated at United States dollars (USD) $2{,}500$. Hence, when $1-o=1$ (all beds idle), the total daily idle capacity cost would be $\\beta = 400 \\times 2{,}500 = \\text{USD } 1{,}000{,}000$.\n- Based on observed associations between delayed care, healthcare-associated infections, and adverse outcomes, the organization’s monetization of expected quality harm yields $\\alpha = \\text{USD } 22{,}500$.\n\nAssume the hospital’s objective is to minimize the daily total expected social loss $L(o) = H(o) + I(o)$ over $o \\in [0,1)$. Using only the definitions above and standard marginal optimization logic, select the single best statement below that simultaneously (i) justifies the quality risks of high occupancy, and (ii) proposes the numerically optimal target occupancy.\n\nA. Set a target of $80\\%$ occupancy, because congestion effects begin at moderate utilization; at this point the marginal harm of delay and infection already equals the marginal cost of idle capacity.\n\nB. Set a target of $85\\%$ occupancy, because the optimal interior solution occurs where the marginal congestion harm equals the marginal cost of idle capacity; at this occupancy, nonlinear delay and infection risk are meaningfully contained without excessive idle bed cost.\n\nC. Set a target of $90\\%$ occupancy, because fixed costs are high and the harm from congestion rises roughly linearly; therefore, running closer to full maximizes efficiency without major quality compromise.\n\nD. Set a target of $95\\%$ occupancy, because maximizing access takes priority and any added delay or infection risk at very high occupancy is modest compared with the savings from minimizing idle capacity.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding the optimal bed occupancy proportion, $o$, that minimizes the total daily expected social loss, $L(o)$. The total loss is the sum of the quality harm from congestion, $H(o)$, and the cost of idle capacity, $I(o)$.\n\nThe total loss function is given by:\n$$L(o) = H(o) + I(o) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1\\right) + \\beta(1-o)$$\n\nTo find the value of $o$ that minimizes $L(o)$, we use standard marginal optimization. We take the first derivative of $L(o)$ with respect to $o$ and set it to zero. This first-order condition identifies the point where the marginal loss is zero.\n\nThe derivative of $L(o)$ with respect to $o$ is:\n$$\\frac{dL}{do} = \\frac{d}{do} \\left[ \\alpha\\left((1-o)^{-1} - 1\\right) \\right] + \\frac{d}{do} \\left[ \\beta(1-o) \\right]$$\n\nCalculating each term:\n- The derivative of the harm function $H(o)$ is the marginal harm of congestion:\n  $$\\frac{dH}{do} = \\alpha \\left[ (-1)(1-o)^{-2} \\cdot (-1) - 0 \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2}$$\n- The derivative of the idle cost function $I(o)$ is:\n  $$\\frac{dI}{do} = \\beta(-1) = -\\beta$$\n\nSetting the total derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{dL}{do} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} - \\beta = 0$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} = \\beta$. This has a clear economic interpretation: the optimal occupancy is achieved when the marginal harm from increasing occupancy (due to congestion) is exactly equal to the marginal benefit from increasing occupancy (the cost saving from one less idle bed, which is $\\beta$).\n\nNow, we solve for the optimal occupancy, $o_{\\text{opt}}$:\n$$(1-o_{\\text{opt}})^2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\n$$1-o_{\\text{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$\n(We take the positive root since $o1$, which means $1-o>0$.)\n$$o_{\\text{opt}} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the values for the parameters:\n- $\\alpha = 22{,}500$\n- $\\beta = 1{,}000{,}000$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $o_{\\text{opt}}$:\n$$o_{\\text{opt}} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{22{,}500}{1{,}000{,}000}} = 1 - \\sqrt{0.0225}$$\nThe square root of $0.0225$ is $0.15$ (since $15^2 = 225$).\n$$o_{\\text{opt}} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$$\n\nThe optimal target occupancy is $0.85$, or $85\\%$.\n\nTo ensure this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2L}{do^2} = \\frac{d}{do} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} - \\beta \\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{(1-o)^3}$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and $(1-o) > 0$ for $o \\in [0,1)$, the second derivative is always positive. This confirms that $L(o)$ is a convex function and $o=0.85$ is a unique global minimum.\n\nBased on this calculation, we can evaluate the given options:\n- A: Incorrect occupancy (80%).\n- B: Correct occupancy (85%) and correct justification (marginal harm equals marginal benefit/cost saving).\n- C: Incorrect occupancy (90%) and incorrect justification (harm is nonlinear, not linear).\n- D: Incorrect occupancy (95%) and incorrect justification (risk at high occupancy is very high, not modest).\n\nTherefore, option B is the single best statement.",
