This exercise introduces a core tool used to answer that question: the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). By calculating the ICER, you will learn how health economists and policymakers quantify the \"value for money\" of a new therapy, providing a systematic basis for coverage and resource allocation decisions .",

            "problem": "A United States not-for-profit integrated delivery system is evaluating a new antihypertensive therapy relative to usual care from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The comparative evaluation uses quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), where one quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) represents one year of life in perfect health. The new therapy yields an incremental effectiveness of $0.5$ QALYs and incurs an incremental cost of $\\$50{,}000$ in United States dollars (USD) relative to usual care. The health system applies a willingness-to-pay threshold of $\\$100{,}000$ per QALY when considering adoption of new technologies.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions from cost-effectiveness analysis in health systems science and first principles about ratios of incremental outcomes, compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the new therapy relative to usual care and determine whether it meets the stated threshold for adoption. Report only the numerical value of the ICER. Round your reported ICER to four significant figures and write it in scientific notation. Express the ICER in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of health economics, and well-posed. All necessary data for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a new antihypertensive therapy compared to usual care. The ICER is a fundamental concept in cost-effectiveness analysis, defined as the ratio of the change in costs to the change in health outcomes of one intervention relative to another. The formula for the ICER is:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{usual}}}{E_{\\text{new}} - E_{\\text{usual}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta C$ represents the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ represents the incremental effectiveness.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe incremental effectiveness of the new therapy, $\\Delta E$, is given as $0.5$ quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).\n$$\n\\Delta E = 0.5 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nThe incremental cost of the new therapy, $\\Delta C$, is given as $\\$50{,}000$ United States dollars (USD).\n$$\n\\Delta C = 50{,}000 \\text{ USD}\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the ICER formula yields:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{50{,}000 \\text{ USD}}{0.5 \\text{ QALYs}} = 100{,}000 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\nThe calculated ICER is exactly $100{,}000$ dollars per QALY.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine if the new therapy meets the health system's threshold for adoption. An intervention is generally considered cost-effective, and thus recommended for adoption, if its ICER is less than or equal to the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. The WTP threshold, which we can denote as $\\lambda$, represents the maximum amount a payer is willing to spend to gain one unit of health outcome (in this case, one QALY).\n\nThe problem states the WTP threshold is:\n$$\n\\lambda = 100{,}000 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\nWe compare the calculated ICER to the WTP threshold:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda\n$$\n$$\n100{,}000 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}} \\le 100{,}000 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\nThe condition is met, as the ICER is equal to the WTP threshold. Therefore, the new therapy meets the stated threshold for adoption from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical value of the ICER to be rounded to four significant figures and written in scientific notation. The calculated value is exactly $100{,}000$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $1.000 \\times 10^5$.",

This practice explores the financial mechanics of an Accountable Care Organization (ACO), a prominent model designed to shift incentives from the volume of services to the value of care.

            "problem": "An Accountable Care Organization (ACO) participates in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) with a per-beneficiary benchmark spending of $\\$10{,}000$ and observed per-beneficiary spending of $\\$9{,}500$ for the performance year. The Minimum Savings Rate (MSR) is $2\\%$, and the nominal shared savings rate is $50\\%$.

Express each amount in United States dollars per beneficiary and round your final numeric values to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be well-posed, internally consistent, and scientifically grounded within the domain of health systems science and quantitative health policy analysis. All necessary parameters are provided, and the relationships are explicitly defined. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the per-beneficiary shared savings for an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and the savings retained by the payer (Medicare) under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). The calculation is based on a set of defined rules and given financial and performance data.\n\nFirst, we define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement.\nLet $B$ be the per-beneficiary benchmark spending, given as $B = \\$10,000$.\nLet $O$ be the observed per-beneficiary spending, given as $O = \\$9,500$.\nLet $M$ be the Minimum Savings Rate (MSR), given as $M = 2\\% = 0.02$.\nLet $S_n$ be the nominal shared savings rate, given as $S_n = 50\\% = 0.50$.\nLet $q$ be the quality performance factor. The quality score is $87$ out of $100$, so the factor is $q = \\frac{87}{100} = 0.87$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the gross savings per beneficiary, denoted by $G$. This is the difference between the benchmark spending and the observed spending.\n$$\nG = B - O\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nG = \\$10,000 - \\$9,500 = \\$500\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine if the ACO is eligible for shared savings. Eligibility is contingent upon the calculated savings rate, $R_s$, meeting or exceeding the Minimum Savings Rate, $M$. The savings rate is the gross savings, $G$, expressed as a proportion of the benchmark spending, $B$.\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{G}{B}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{\\$500}{\\$10,000} = 0.05\n$$\nThis corresponds to a savings rate of $5\\%$. We compare this to the MSR, $M$. The eligibility condition is $R_s \\ge M$.\n$$\n0.05 \\ge 0.02\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the ACO is eligible for a portion of the savings. The problem specifies that \"savings are shared on the first dollar once the MSR is achieved,\" which confirms that the entire gross savings amount, $G$, is the basis for the sharing calculation.\n\nThe portion of savings distributed to the ACO is determined by an effective shared savings rate, $S_e$. This rate is calculated by multiplying the nominal shared savings rate, $S_n$, by the quality performance factor, $q$.\n$$\nS_e = S_n \\times q\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nS_e = 0.50 \\times 0.87 = 0.435\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the per-beneficiary shared savings amount distributed to the ACO, which we denote as $A_{\\text{ACO}}$. This is the product of the gross savings, $G$, and the effective shared savings rate, $S_e$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{ACO}} = G \\times S_e\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nA_{\\text{ACO}} = \\$500 \\times 0.435 = \\$217.5\n$$\n\nThe remaining portion of the gross savings is retained by the payer, Medicare. We denote this amount as $A_{\\text{Payer}}$. It is the difference between the total gross savings, $G$, and the amount distributed to the ACO, $A_{\\text{ACO}}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{Payer}} = G - A_{\\text{ACO}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nA_{\\text{Payer}} = \\$500 - \\$217.5 = \\$282.5\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numeric values to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated amount for the ACO, $A_{\\text{ACO}} = \\$217.5$, consists of the digits $2, 1, 7, 5$. This number has exactly four significant figures, so no rounding is needed.\nThe calculated amount for the payer, $A_{\\text{Payer}} = \\$282.5$, consists of the digits $2, 8, 2, 5$. This number also has exactly four significant figures, so no rounding is needed.\n\nThe per-beneficiary shared savings distributed to the ACO is $\\$217.5$, and the amount retained by Medicare is $\\$282.5$.",
