This exercise guides you through deriving the PMPM rate from the ground up, starting with the principle of actuarially fair pricing where expected revenue must cover expected costs plus administrative overhead.

            "problem": "A primary care group is negotiating a per member per month (PMPM) capitation with a regional payer. The group will cover a defined population over a one-year period, with monthly enrollment varying due to churn. The payer and group agree to use an actuarially fair pricing principle: expected premium revenue over the period should equal the expected total requirement to fund medical claims and administrative cost plus margin. Administrative cost plus margin is modeled as a fixed proportion of expected claims.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational definitions and facts:\n- Under capitation, if the PMPM rate is $r$ and the population accumulates $M$ member months over the period, the total premium revenue is $r \\times M$.\n- The expected total requirement equals expected claims plus administrative cost and margin.\n- Administrative cost plus margin is proportional to expected claims by a loading factor $\\ell$, so expected non-claim requirement is $\\ell \\times E[C]$, where $E[C]$ is expected annual claims cost for the defined population.\n- A member month is one enrolled member for one month; the total member months $M$ over a period is the sum of monthly enrollment counts.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive, from these base definitions, a closed-form expression for the PMPM capitation rate $r$ in terms of $E[C]$, $M$, and $\\ell$.\n2. Compute $M$ and then evaluate $r$ numerically for the following scenario. The expected annual claims cost is $E[C] = \\$13{,}750{,}000$, the loading factor is $\\ell = 0.145$, and monthly enrollment counts (January to December) are: $980$, $1000$, $1010$, $1025$, $1040$, $1055$, $1065$, $1070$, $1060$, $1050$, $1030$, $1005$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of actuarial science, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two tasks as specified in the problem statement. First, we derive a closed-form expression for the per member per month (PMPM) capitation rate, $r$. Second, we compute the total member months, $M$, and then calculate the numerical value of $r$ for the given scenario.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the PMPM Capitation Rate ($r$)\n\nThe derivation begins with the actuarially fair pricing principle stated in the problem: the expected premium revenue over the period must equal the expected total requirement to fund all costs. We can express this as an equation:\n\n$$\n\\text{Expected Premium Revenue} = \\text{Expected Total Requirement}\n$$\n\nWe will now formalize each side of this equation using the provided definitions.\n\n**Left-Hand Side: Expected Premium Revenue**\nThe problem states that for a PMPM rate of $r$ and a total of $M$ member months over the period, the total premium revenue is given by the product of these two quantities.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Premium Revenue} = r \\times M\n$$\n\n**Right-Hand Side: Expected Total Requirement**\nThe expected total requirement is defined as the sum of the expected medical claims cost and the administrative cost plus margin.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = \\text{Expected Claims} + (\\text{Admin Cost} + \\text{Margin})\n$$\nThe expected annual claims cost is given as $E[C]$. The administrative cost plus margin is modeled as a proportion of the expected claims, determined by a loading factor $\\ell$.\n$$\n\\text{Admin Cost} + \\text{Margin} = \\ell \\times E[C]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the total requirement yields:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = E[C] + \\ell \\times E[C]\n$$\nWe can factor out $E[C]$ from the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = (1 + \\ell) E[C]\n$$\n\n**Assembling the Equation and Solving for $r$**\nNow, we equate the expressions for revenue and a total requirement:\n$$\nr \\times M = (1 + \\ell) E[C]\n$$\nTo find the closed-form expression for the PMPM rate $r$, we isolate $r$ by dividing both sides of the equation by the total member months, $M$. This is permissible as $M$ represents a total count of enrolled members over time and must be positive.\n$$\nr = \\frac{(1 + \\ell) E[C]}{M}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the PMPM capitation rate $r$ in terms of the expected annual claims cost $E[C]$, the total member months $M$, and the loading factor $\\ell$.\n\n### Task 2: Numerical Calculation of $M$ and $r$\n\nWe are given the following values for the scenario:\n- Expected annual claims cost, $E[C] = \\$13,750,000$.\n- Loading factor, $\\ell = 0.145$.\n- Monthly enrollment counts for the one-year period (January to December): $980$, $1000$, $1010$, $1025$, $1040$, $1055$, $1065$, $1070$, $1060$, $1050$, $1030$, $1005$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute Total Member Months ($M$)**\nThe total member months $M$ is the sum of the monthly enrollment counts over the $12$-month period.\n$$\nM = 980 + 1000 + 1010 + 1025 + 1040 + 1055 + 1065 + 1070 + 1060 + 1050 + 1030 + 1005\n$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$\nM = 12390 \\text{ member months}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the PMPM Rate ($r$)**\nWe now substitute the numerical values for $E[C]$, $\\ell$, and the computed value of $M$ into the derived expression for $r$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{(1 + 0.145) \\times 13,750,000}{12390}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which represents the expected total requirement in dollars:\n$$\n(1 + 0.145) \\times 13,750,000 = 1.145 \\times 13,750,000 = 15,743,750\n$$\nNow, divide this total requirement by the total member months, $M$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{15,743,750}{12390}\n$$\n$$\nr \\approx 1270.6820016...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nr \\approx 1271\n$$\nThus, the PMPM capitation rate is approximately $\\$1271$.",

            "problem": "A health system participating in a retrospective bundled payment program for a defined episode of care agrees with the payer on a target episode price. In retrospective bundled payment, reconciliation compares the target price with actual episode spending to determine whether savings or losses occurred. If actual spending is below the target, the payer shares savings with the provider at a pre-specified gainsharing rate, provided quality thresholds are met. The provider then allocates the received shared savings across its participating entities according to a pre-agreed internal split.\n\nConsider a single surgical episode with target price set at $\\$28{,}000$ and actual episode spending equal to $\\$24{,}000$. The contract includes a gainsharing rate of $0.60$ for realized savings, and quality thresholds are met, so no penalties or withholds apply. The health system’s internal agreement specifies that the surgeon receives $0.40$ of any shared savings paid to the provider entity and the hospital receives $0.60$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of bundled payment reconciliation (savings are the positive difference between the target price and actual spending, and gainsharing pays the provider a fixed fraction of those savings), derive the reconciliation payment amount owed by the payer to the provider and then determine how that payment would be distributed between the surgeon and the hospital under the stated split.

Let $C$ be the predicted annual cost for an individual. The model is a linear combination of a baseline cost and costs associated with specific clinical conditions. Let $I_D$ be the indicator variable for diabetes and $I_{CHF}$ be the indicator variable for congestive heart failure.
