The Full-Time Equivalent, or FTE, provides a standardized unit to measure labor capacity by comparing an individual's work hours to a full-time standard. This practice will help you master the essential skill of aggregating FTEs from different groups of clinicians to determine the total capacity of a service line, a fundamental step in any workforce analysis .",

            "problem": "A health system's workforce planning team is quantifying the capacity of a single service line using the concept of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE). Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is defined as the ratio of an individual clinician's scheduled hours to the standard full-time hours for the same role, and aggregated FTE capacity for a service line is the total contribution of all clinicians' FTE values. The service line has two cohorts of clinicians: cohort $A$ has $120$ clinicians whose average FTE is $0.8$, and cohort $B$ has $30$ clinicians whose average FTE is $0.5$. Under the assumption that aggregate capacity is the sum of individual FTE contributions and that each cohort's reported average is the arithmetic mean of the FTEs within that cohort, compute the total FTE capacity for the service line.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single real number.

All necessary data and definitions for a unique solution are provided, and the premises are consistent with standard mathematical and administrative principles.\n\nLet $N_A$ be the number of clinicians in cohort $A$ and $N_B$ be the number of clinicians in cohort $B$. According to the problem statement, we have:\n$$ N_A = 120 $$\n$$ N_B = 30 $$\n\nLet $\\overline{\\text{FTE}}_A$ and $\\overline{\\text{FTE}}_B$ represent the average Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) for cohort $A$ and cohort $B$, respectively. The given values are:\n$$ \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_A = 0.8 $$\n$$ \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_B = 0.5 $$\n\nThe problem states that each cohort's reported average is the arithmetic mean of the FTEs within that cohort. The total FTE contribution for a cohort is the sum of the individual FTEs of its members. Let the total FTE for cohort $A$ be denoted as $\\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},A}$. From the definition of an arithmetic mean, we have:\n$$ \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_A = \\frac{\\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},A}}{N_A} $$\nTherefore, the total FTE for cohort $A$ can be calculated by multiplying the average FTE by the number of clinicians in the cohort:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},A} = N_A \\times \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_A $$\n\nSimilarly, for cohort $B$, the total FTE, denoted $\\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},B}$, is:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},B} = N_B \\times \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_B $$\n\nThe problem defines the aggregate FTE capacity for the service line, which we will denote as $\\text{FTE}_{\\text{service line}}$, as the sum of the individual FTE contributions from all clinicians. This is equivalent to summing the total FTE contributions from each cohort:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{service line}} = \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},A} + \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},B} $$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for the cohort totals into this equation:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{service line}} = (N_A \\times \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_A) + (N_B \\times \\overline{\\text{FTE}}_B) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the final answer.\nFor cohort $A$:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},A} = 120 \\times 0.8 = 96 $$\nFor cohort $B$:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{total},B} = 30 \\times 0.5 = 15 $$\n\nThe total FTE capacity for the service line is the sum of these two values:\n$$ \\text{FTE}_{\\text{service line}} = 96 + 15 = 111 $$\n\nThe total FTE capacity for the service line is $111$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary data and definitions to derive a unique, meaningful solution from first principles of probability theory. The core task is to compute the total expected number of chronic disease management visits, which can be accomplished using the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $N$ be the total size of the closed population, where $N = 200{,}000$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{HTN}}$ be the prevalence of hypertension, with $p_{\\mathrm{HTN}} = 0.30$.\nLet $s_{\\mathrm{HTN}}$ be the number of required annual visits for a person with hypertension, with $s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} = 3$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ be the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, with $p_{\\mathrm{DM}} = 0.12$.\nLet $s_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ be the number of required annual visits for a person with diabetes, with $s_{\\mathrm{DM}} = 4$.\n\nThe goal is to find the expected total number of visits per year for the entire population. Let us denote this quantity by $E[V_{\\text{total}}]$.\n\nWe begin by defining a random variable $X_i$ for each individual $i$ in the population (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$), representing the number of visits required by that individual per year. The total number of visits for the population is the sum of the visits for each individual:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of visits is the sum of the expected visits for each individual:\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nSince each individual is drawn from the same population, the expected number of visits is the same for all individuals. Let $E[X]$ represent the expected number of visits for a single, randomly selected individual. Then $E[X_i] = E[X]$ for all $i$, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = N \\cdot E[X]$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding $E[X]$. To do this, we introduce indicator random variables for a single individual:\nLet $I_{\\mathrm{HTN}}$ be an indicator variable such that $I_{\\mathrm{HTN}} = 1$ if the individual has hypertension, and $I_{\\mathrm{HTN}} = 0$ otherwise.\nLet $I_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ be an indicator variable such that $I_{\\mathrm{DM}} = 1$ if the individual has diabetes, and $I_{\\mathrm{DM}} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe problem states that required visits are additive. Thus, the total number of visits $X$ for a single individual is a linear combination of these indicator variables:\n$$X = s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} I_{\\mathrm{HTN}} + s_{\\mathrm{DM}} I_{\\mathrm{DM}}$$\n\nWe again apply the linearity of expectation to find $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = E[s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} I_{\\mathrm{HTN}} + s_{\\mathrm{DM}} I_{\\mathrm{DM}}] = s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} E[I_{\\mathrm{HTN}}] + s_{\\mathrm{DM}} E[I_{\\mathrm{DM}}]$$\n\nA fundamental property of an indicator variable is that its expected value is the probability of the event it indicates. The prevalence $p$ is defined as the proportion of individuals with the condition, which is the probability that a randomly chosen individual has that condition. Therefore:\n$$E[I_{\\mathrm{HTN}}] = P(\\text{individual has hypertension}) = p_{\\mathrm{HTN}}$$\n$$E[I_{\\mathrm{DM}}] = P(\\text{individual has diabetes}) = p_{\\mathrm{DM}}$$\n\nSubstituting these probabilities back into the expression for $E[X]$ yields:\n$$E[X] = s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} p_{\\mathrm{HTN}} + s_{\\mathrm{DM}} p_{\\mathrm{DM}}$$\n\nThis derivation for the expected visits of a single individual correctly makes no assumptions about the statistical relationship (e.g., independence or correlation) between hypertension and diabetes. The use of linearity of expectation elegantly bypasses the need for the joint probability $P(I_{\\mathrm{HTN}}=1, I_{\\mathrm{DM}}=1)$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $E[X]$ back into the equation for the total expected visits for the population:\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = N \\cdot (s_{\\mathrm{HTN}} p_{\\mathrm{HTN}} + s_{\\mathrm{DM}} p_{\\mathrm{DM}})$$\n\nNow we can insert the given numerical values to compute the final answer:\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = 200{,}000 \\cdot ((3) \\cdot (0.30) + (4) \\cdot (0.12))$$\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = 200{,}000 \\cdot (0.90 + 0.48)$$\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = 200{,}000 \\cdot (1.38)$$\n$$E[V_{\\text{total}}] = 276{,}000$$\n\nThe total expected number of chronic disease management visits required per year for this population is $276{,}000$.",

            "introduction": "This final practice problem presents a comprehensive scenario that mirrors the complexity of real-world hospital staffing. You will synthesize your understanding of FTEs and demand by translating a mandated nurse-to-patient ratio into a precise staffing plan. The exercise introduces the critical concepts of productive versus non-productive time, forcing you to calculate the number of staff required not just to be on payroll, but to be available for direct patient care at all times .",

            "problem": "A hospital inpatient unit with a continuous average census of $64$ patients must comply with a mandated direct-care registered nurse-to-patient ratio of $1$ nurse per $4$ patients at all times. The unit operates three identical 8-hour shifts per day. The organization defines one Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) as $40$ paid hours per week. On average, each FTE has a non-productive paid time fraction of $0.10$ (education, meetings, paid leave) and an unscheduled absenteeism fraction of $0.05$, both of which reduce the hours available for direct patient care. Assume these two fractions are non-overlapping and fully reduce productive hours available for direct care.\n\nThe current baseline staffing for bedside registered nurses on this unit is $70$ FTE.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in health workforce planning principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe objective is to compute the additional Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) required for a hospital unit to meet a mandated nurse-to-patient ratio. The calculation proceeds in a structured manner.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of direct-care registered nurses that must be on duty at all times. The unit has a continuous average census of $C = 64$ patients, and the mandated ratio is $1$ nurse for every $4$ patients.\nThe number of nurses required on duty, $N_{duty}$, is:\n$$N_{duty} = \\frac{\\text{Patient Census}}{\\text{Patients per Nurse}} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\text{ nurses}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of direct-care nursing hours required to staff the unit for an entire week. The unit operates continuously, which is $24$ hours a day, $7$ days a week. The problem states there are three $8$-hour shifts, confirming the $24$-hour coverage ($3 \\times 8 = 24$).\nThe total hours in a week, $H_{week}$, is:\n$$H_{week} = 24 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} = 168 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe total required direct-care nursing hours per week, $H_{required}$, is the product of the number of nurses needed on duty and the total hours in the week:\n$$H_{required} = N_{duty} \\times H_{week} = 16 \\times 168 = 2688 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nNow, we must determine the number of productive, direct-care hours that a single FTE provides per week. An FTE is defined as $H_{paid} = 40$ paid hours per week. However, not all paid hours are available for direct patient care. We are given a non-productive time fraction, $f_{np} = 0.10$, and an unscheduled absenteeism fraction, $f_a = 0.05$. These fractions are specified as non-overlapping and reduce the hours available for direct care.\nThe total fraction of paid time that is not productive for direct care is the sum of these two fractions:\n$$f_{non-productive\\_total} = f_{np} + f_a = 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15$$\nThe fraction of an FTE's time that is productive for direct care is therefore:\n$$f_{productive} = 1 - f_{non-productive\\_total} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$$\nThe number of productive direct-care hours provided by one FTE per week, $H_{productive}$, is:\n$$H_{productive} = H_{paid} \\times f_{productive} = 40 \\times 0.85 = 34 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nWith the total required direct-care hours and the productive hours per FTE, we can calculate the total number of FTEs required to staff the unit, $FTE_{required}$:\n$$FTE_{required} = \\frac{H_{required}}{H_{productive}} = \\frac{2688}{34} \\approx 79.05882...$$\n\nThe problem states that the current baseline staffing for the unit is $FTE_{current} = 70$. The question asks for the *additional* FTE required, $FTE_{additional}$, which is the difference between the required FTE and the current FTE:\n$$FTE_{additional} = FTE_{required} - FTE_{current} = 79.05882... - 70 = 9.05882...$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number is $9.05882...$. The first three significant figures are $9$, $0$, and $5$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$FTE_{additional\\_rounded} \\approx 9.06$$",
