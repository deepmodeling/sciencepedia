            "problem": "A primary care practice has implemented interprofessional team-based care. Over a one-month period, the practice director recorded whether pairs of team members engaged in at least one direct, bidirectional care-planning conversation per week. Treat the observed communication pattern as an undirected, unweighted simple graph. The seven team members are indexed as follows: $1$ Physician, $2$ Registered Nurse, $3$ Pharmacist, $4$ Social Worker, $5$ Physical Therapist, $6$ Care Coordinator, $7$ Behavioral Health Specialist. The adjacency matrix $A$ of the communication network is:\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nUsing standard definitions from Social Network Analysis (SNA), and interpreting this as a single undirected, unweighted, simple communication network:\n- Compute the network density, the degree centralization (Freeman’s degree centralization for undirected graphs), and the global clustering coefficient measured by transitivity (the fraction of connected triples that are closed).\n- Express each metric as a fraction in simplest terms, with no rounding.\n- Based on these values, briefly justify how the observed structure would be expected to relate to coordination efficiency and resilience in interprofessional collaboration (your justification should follow logically from the values and widely accepted properties of these metrics).\n\nYour final numerical answer must list the three metrics in the order: density, degree centralization, global clustering coefficient, as exact fractions in simplest terms.",
            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid upon review. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of graph theory and social network analysis, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and is expressed objectively. The adjacency matrix $A$ is symmetric with a zero diagonal, correctly representing an undirected, unweighted simple graph.\n\nLet the graph be $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of team members (nodes) and $E$ is the set of communication links (edges).\n\nFrom the problem statement, the number of nodes (team members) is $n=7$. The adjacency matrix $A$ is a $7 \\times 7$ matrix.\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe number of edges, $m$, can be found by summing the entries of the upper (or lower) triangle of the adjacency matrix.\n$$\nm = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} A_{ij} = (1+1+1+0+1+0) + (1+0+0+1+1) + (0+0+0+0) + (1+1+1) + (0+1) + (0) = 4+3+0+3+1+0 = 11\n$$\nAlternatively, using the handshaking lemma, $2m = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{deg}(v_i)$. The degree of each node $v_i$, $\\text{deg}(v_i)$, is the sum of the $i$-th row (or column) of $A$.\n$$\n\\text{deg}(v_1) = 4, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_2) = 4, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_3) = 2, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_4) = 4, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_5) = 2, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_6) = 3, \\quad \\text{deg}(v_7) = 3\n$$\nThe sum of degrees is $4+4+2+4+2+3+3=22$. Thus, $2m = 22$, which gives $m=11$.\n\n**1. Network Density ($\\Delta$)**\nNetwork density for an undirected simple graph is the ratio of the number of existing edges, $m$, to the maximum possible number of edges, which is $\\binom{n}{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Total possible edges} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times (7-1)}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{m}{\\binom{n}{2}} = \\frac{11}{21}\n$$\n\n**2. Degree Centralization ($C_D$)**\nFreeman's degree centralization for an undirected graph is given by the formula:\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} [\\text{deg}(v_{\\text{max}}) - \\text{deg}(v_i)]}{(n-1)(n-2)}\n$$\nThe degrees of the nodes are $\\{4, 4, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3\\}$. The maximum degree is $\\text{deg}(v_{\\text{max}}) = 4$.\nThe numerator is the sum of the differences between the maximum degree and each node's degree:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{7} [\\text{deg}(v_{\\text{max}}) - \\text{deg}(v_i)] = (4-4) + (4-4) + (4-2) + (4-4) + (4-2) + (4-3) + (4-3)\n$$\n$$\n= 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\n$$\nThe denominator is the maximum possible sum of degree differences, which occurs in a star graph with $n$ nodes.\n$$\n(n-1)(n-2) = (7-1)(7-2) = 6 \\times 5 = 30\n$$\nThe degree centralization is:\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\n\n**3. Global Clustering Coefficient (Transitivity, $T$)**\nTransitivity is the fraction of all connected triples of nodes (2-paths) that form triangles.\n$$\nT = \\frac{3 \\times (\\text{number of triangles})}{(\\text{number of connected triples})}\n$$\nThe number of connected triples is the sum of the number of pairs of neighbors for each node: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\binom{\\text{deg}(v_i)}{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Number of connected triples} = \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{2}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} \\times 3 + \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} \\times 2 + \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} \\times 2 = (6 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 2) = 18 + 2 + 6 = 26\n$$\nThe number of triangles can be enumerated by checking all combinations of three nodes. A set of nodes $\\{i,j,k\\}$ forms a triangle if $A_{ij}=1$, $A_{jk}=1$, and $A_{ki}=1$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\{1,2,3\\}$: $A_{12}=1$, $A_{13}=1$, $A_{23}=1$. This is a triangle.\n    \\item $\\{1,2,6\\}$: $A_{12}=1$, $A_{16}=1$, $A_{26}=1$. This is a triangle.\n    \\item $\\{1,4,6\\}$: $A_{14}=1$, $A_{16}=1$, $A_{46}=1$. This is a triangle.\n    \\item $\\{4,5,7\\}$: $A_{45}=1$, $A_{47}=1$, $A_{57}=1$. This is a triangle.\n\\end{itemize}\nA systematic check reveals these are the only 4 triangles in the network.\nSo, the number of triangles is $4$.\nThe global clustering coefficient (transitivity) is:\n$$\nT = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{26} = \\frac{12}{26} = \\frac{6}{13}\n$$\n\n**Justification for Coordination Efficiency and Resilience**\n\nThe calculated metrics provide insight into the network's function.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Density ($\\Delta = \\frac{11}{21} \\approx 0.52$)**: The network has a moderate density, indicating that about half of all possible communication links exist. This suggests a balance: the team is cohesive enough for information to circulate effectively but not so dense as to create an overwhelming communication burden on team members. This supports reasonably efficient coordination.\n    \\item **Degree Centralization ($C_D = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$)**: This value is low. A value of $1$ would indicate a star graph where one member is central to all communication. The low centralization signifies a decentralized, egalitarian communication structure. No single team member acts as a dominant hub or bottleneck. This structure is highly **resilient** because the removal of any single node (e.g., a team member is unavailable) will not fragment the network. For **efficiency**, this decentralized structure is beneficial for complex, collaborative tasks requiring input from multiple disciplines, as it facilitates parallel communication and avoids overloading a central coordinator.\n    \\item **Global Clustering Coefficient ($T = \\frac{6}{13} \\approx 0.46$)**: This value is moderately high, indicating a strong tendency for team members' collaborators to also collaborate with each other. This high degree of \"cliquishness\" promotes **efficiency** in coordination within small subgroups (the triangles). It fosters trust, shared understanding, and rapid information exchange for localized tasks. For example, the triangle $\\{1,2,3\\}$ (Physician, RN, Pharmacist) can coordinate efficiently on medication management. The overlaps between these clusters (e.g., node 1 participates in three triangles) act as crucial bridges, ensuring that these cohesive subgroups remain integrated within the broader team, which enhances overall network **resilience** by preventing siloing.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn summary, the observed structure with low centralization, moderate density, and high clustering supports a team that is likely both resilient to disruption and efficient at collaborative, complex care planning.\n\nThe three metrics, in the specified order, are: density $\\frac{11}{21}$, degree centralization $\\frac{1}{5}$, and global clustering coefficient $\\frac{6}{13}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established statistical method of Cohen's kappa, is well-posed with complete and consistent data, and is presented objectively.\n\nThe objective is to compute the pairwise Cohen’s kappa ($\\kappa$) for three raters—Physician (P), Registered Nurse (RN), and Clinical Pharmacist (CP)—and then find the arithmetic mean of these kappa values. The total number of handoffs rated is $n=200$.\n\nCohen’s kappa is a statistic that measures interrater agreement for categorical items, correcting for the agreement that is expected to occur by chance. The formula for kappa is:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} $$\nwhere $p_o$ is the empirically observed proportion of agreement, and $p_e$ is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement.\n\nFirst, we must construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table for each pair of raters from the given counts of the eight joint rating patterns: $(A, A, A): 80$; $(A, A, N): 30$; $(A, N, A): 20$; $(N, A, A): 15$; $(A, N, N): 25$; $(N, A, N): 20$; $(N, N, A): 10$; $(N, N, N): 0$.

This very low average kappa value suggests that, after correcting for chance, there is virtually no consistent agreement among the three professions regarding SBAR adherence, despite a moderately high raw agreement rate of $60\\%$.

            "problem": "An interprofessional primary care team uses two communication channels to coordinate patient care tasks: (i) synchronous clinician-to-clinician messaging that interrupts a clinician immediately and (ii) an asynchronous pooled task queue staffed by care coordinators. Incoming tasks arrive to the team as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ tasks per hour. A fraction $p$ of tasks are routed to synchronous messaging; the remaining fraction $(1-p)$ are routed to the asynchronous queue. The asynchronous queue is served first-come, first-served by a dedicated coordinator with exponential service times at rate $\\mu_a$ tasks per hour. Assume independence of arrivals and services and stationarity.\n\nDefine the following per-task harm/cost measures to capture the trade-offs relevant to team-based care:\n- Each synchronous message imposes an interruption cost of $c_I$ cost units per interruption on the interrupted clinician due to cognitive switching and flow disruption.\n- Each asynchronous task accumulates a waiting-time cost of $c_W$ cost units per task-hour of waiting in queue (excluding service time), representing risks such as care delays, workflow bottlenecks, and potential patient harm.\n\nAssume that synchronous messages do not wait and that their harm is entirely captured by the interruption cost $c_I$.

Express your final answer as the optimal fraction $p^{\\ast}$ (a unitless decimal between $0$ and $1$). Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Total incoming task rate: $\\lambda = 20$ tasks/hour, following a Poisson process.\n- Fraction of tasks routed to synchronous messaging: $p$.\n- Fraction of tasks routed to asynchronous queue: $1-p$.\n- Asynchronous queue service model: First-come, first-served with a single server.\n- Asynchronous queue service time: Exponential with rate $\\mu_a = 12$ tasks/hour.\n- Interruption cost for a synchronous message: $c_I = 2.5$ cost units per interruption.\n- Waiting-time cost for an asynchronous task: $c_W = 3$ cost units per task-hour of waiting in queue.\n- Waiting time for synchronous messages is zero.\n- The asynchronous queue is stable: $(1-p)\\lambda < \\mu_a$.\n- Arrivals and services are independent. The system is in a stationary state.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It is a standard optimization problem within the field of operations research, specifically using queueing theory. The model described for the asynchronous channel is a classical M/M/1 queue, characterized by Markovian (Poisson) arrivals and Markovian (exponential) service times. The cost function is a linear combination of costs associated with each communication channel, a common and rational approach in such models. The problem is well-posed: the objective function (total cost rate) is defined, the variable to be optimized ($p$) is identified, and the constraints are clearly stated (the range of $p$ and the stability of the queue). The language is objective and the parameters are defined precisely. All necessary information is provided.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of $p$, denoted $p^{\\ast}$, that minimizes the total expected cost rate, $C(p)$. The total cost rate is the sum of the cost rate from synchronous messages, $C_s(p)$, and the cost rate from asynchronous tasks, $C_a(p)$.\n\nThe rate of tasks arriving at the synchronous channel is $\\lambda_s = p\\lambda$. Each such task incurs a fixed cost of $c_I$. Therefore, the expected cost rate for the synchronous channel is:\n$$C_s(p) = \\lambda_s c_I = p\\lambda c_I$$\n\nThe asynchronous channel is modeled as an M/M/1 queue. The arrival rate to this queue is $\\lambda_a = (1-p)\\lambda$, and the service rate is $\\mu_a$. The problem states that this queue must be stable, which implies the condition $\\lambda_a < \\mu_a$. This establishes a constraint on $p$:\n$$(1-p)\\lambda < \\mu_a$$\n$$1-p < \\frac{\\mu_a}{\\lambda}$$\n$$p > 1 - \\frac{\\mu_a}{\\lambda}$$\nGiven the values $\\lambda = 20$ and $\\mu_a = 12$, the lower bound for $p$ is:\n$$p > 1 - \\frac{12}{20} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\nAlso, since $p$ is a fraction, $p \\le 1$. Thus, the feasible range for $p$ is $(0.4, 1]$.\n\nThe cost for the asynchronous channel is related to the waiting time in the queue, $W_q$. For a stable M/M/1 queue, the expected waiting time in the queue (excluding service time) for a task is given by:\n$$W_q = \\frac{\\lambda_a}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - \\lambda_a)}$$\nThe cost is $c_W$ per task-hour of waiting. The total expected cost rate from waiting is the product of the arrival rate $\\lambda_a$, the average waiting time per task $W_q$, and the cost per unit of waiting time $c_W$.\n$$C_a(p) = \\lambda_a W_q c_W = \\lambda_a \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_a}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - \\lambda_a)} \\right) c_W = \\frac{c_W \\lambda_a^2}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - \\lambda_a)}$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_a = (1-p)\\lambda$:\n$$C_a(p) = \\frac{c_W ((1-p)\\lambda)^2}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - (1-p)\\lambda)}$$\n\nThe total cost rate $C(p)$ is the sum of the two components:\n$$C(p) = C_s(p) + C_a(p) = p\\lambda c_I + \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2 (1-p)^2}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - (1-p)\\lambda)}$$\n\nTo minimize this cost, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of $C(p)$ with respect to $p$ and setting it to zero. To simplify the differentiation, let $x = 1-p$. The problem is then to minimize $C(x)$ for $x \\in [0, \\mu_a/\\lambda)$. Note that if $p \\to 1$, $x \\to 0$, and if $p \\to 1 - \\mu_a/\\lambda$, $x \\to \\mu_a/\\lambda$.\n$$C(x) = (1-x)\\lambda c_I + \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2 x^2}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)}$$\nNow, we differentiate $C(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (1-x)\\lambda c_I \\right) + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2 x^2}{\\mu_a(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\lambda c_I + \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2}{\\mu_a} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{\\mu_a - x\\lambda} \\right)$$\nUsing the quotient rule for the second term, where $u = x^2$ and $v = \\mu_a - x\\lambda$, so $u' = 2x$ and $v' = -\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = \\frac{(2x)(\\mu_a - x\\lambda) - (x^2)(-\\lambda)}{(\\mu_a-x\\lambda)^2} = \\frac{2x\\mu_a - 2x^2\\lambda + x^2\\lambda}{(\\mu_a-x\\lambda)^2} = \\frac{x(2\\mu_a - x\\lambda)}{(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the derivative of $C(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\lambda c_I + \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2}{\\mu_a} \\frac{x(2\\mu_a - x\\lambda)}{(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^2}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the optimal $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\lambda c_I = \\frac{c_W \\lambda^2}{\\mu_a} \\frac{x(2\\mu_a - x\\lambda)}{(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{c_I \\mu_a}{c_W \\lambda} = \\frac{x(2\\mu_a - x\\lambda)}{(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^2}$$\nThis equation must be solved for $x$. Let's define a dimensionless constant $K = \\frac{c_I \\mu_a}{c_W \\lambda}$.\n$$K (\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^2 = x(2\\mu_a - x\\lambda)$$\n$$K(\\mu_a^2 - 2x\\lambda\\mu_a + x^2\\lambda^2) = 2x\\mu_a - x^2\\lambda$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$(K\\lambda^2 + \\lambda)x^2 - (2K\\lambda\\mu_a + 2\\mu_a)x + K\\mu_a^2 = 0$$\n$$\\lambda(K\\lambda + 1)x^2 - 2\\mu_a(K\\lambda + 1)x + K\\mu_a^2 = 0$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\lambda = 20$, $\\mu_a = 12$, $c_I = 2.5$, $c_W = 3$.\n$$K = \\frac{2.5 \\times 12}{3 \\times 20} = \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5$$\nThe term $K\\lambda + 1 = 0.5 \\times 20 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$.\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n$$(20 \\times 11)x^2 - (2 \\times 12 \\times 11)x + (0.5 \\times 12^2) = 0$$\n$$220x^2 - 264x + 72 = 0$$\nDividing by the common factor $4$:\n$$55x^2 - 66x + 18 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{66 \\pm \\sqrt{(-66)^2 - 4(55)(18)}}{2(55)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{66 \\pm \\sqrt{4356 - 3960}}{110} = \\frac{66 \\pm \\sqrt{396}}{110}$$\n$$\\sqrt{396} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 11} = 6\\sqrt{11}$$\n$$x = \\frac{66 \\pm 6\\sqrt{11}}{110} = \\frac{6 \\pm 0.6\\sqrt{11}}{10} = 0.6 \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{55}$$\nThe two possible solutions for $x$ are:\n$$x_1 = 0.6 + \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{55} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = 0.6 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{55}$$\nThe stability condition for the queue is $\\lambda_a < \\mu_a$, which corresponds to $x\\lambda < \\mu_a$ or $x < \\mu_a/\\lambda = 12/20 = 0.6$. The solution $x_1$ is greater than $0.6$ and is therefore outside the feasible domain. The solution $x_2$ is less than $0.6$ and is the only valid stationary point in the domain.\n$$x^{\\ast} = 0.6 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{55}$$\nThe second derivative of $C(x)$ is $\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} = \\frac{2c_W \\lambda^2 \\mu_a}{(\\mu_a - x\\lambda)^3}$, which is positive for $x < \\mu_a/\\lambda$.
