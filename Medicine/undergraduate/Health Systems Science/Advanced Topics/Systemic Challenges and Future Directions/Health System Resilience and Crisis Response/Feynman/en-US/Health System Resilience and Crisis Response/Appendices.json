            "problem": "A regional health authority is stress-testing its emergency care network for crisis events. In a commonly used proxy in disaster risk analysis, system risk is modeled as the multiplicative combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability: risk $R$ is proportional to the concurrence of the stressor, the fraction of system assets exposed, and the susceptibility of those assets. Assume a normalized model in which each factor is scaled between $0$ and $1$, and define:\n- Hazard $H$ as the normalized annualized likelihood-severity of an extreme event,\n- Exposure $E$ as the proportion of critical system capacity subject to disruption,\n- Vulnerability $V$ as the conditional probability that exposed capacity fails given the hazard.\n\nUse the fundamental base that, under these assumptions, overall risk is represented by the product\n$$\nR = H \\cdot E \\cdot V,\n$$\nand that a mitigation action that reduces vulnerability by $\\Delta V$ (without altering $H$ or $E$) changes risk accordingly. Define the absolute risk reduction as $\\Delta R = R_{\\text{pre}} - R_{\\text{post}}$ and the cost-effectiveness ratio as cost per unit reduction in risk,\n$$\n\\text{CER} = \\frac{C}{\\Delta R}.\n$$\n\nSuppose the current assessment yields $H = 0.3$, $E = 0.6$, and $V = 0.5$.

The model provided is a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which is a fundamental and valid approach for modeling relaxation dynamics in various systems, including health services. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three tasks. I will address each sequentially.\n\nTask 1: Derive the closed-form trajectory $S(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of the service capacity $S(t)$ are governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda(g - S(t))\n$$\nwith the initial condition $S(0) = S_{0}(1-\\theta)$. This equation is separable. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{g - S} = \\lambda \\, dt\n$$\nThis is valid as long as $S(t) \\neq g$. Since the initial state $S(0) = S_{0}(1-\\theta)$ is generally not equal to the adaptive setpoint $g$, and continuity implies $S(t)$ will not instantaneously jump to $g$, we can integrate both sides.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{g - S} \\, dS = \\int \\lambda \\, dt\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n-\\ln|g - S| = \\lambda t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To solve for $S(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\ln|g - S| = -\\lambda t - C\n$$\n$$\n|g - S| = \\exp(-\\lambda t - C) = \\exp(-C) \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nLet a new constant $A = \\pm \\exp(-C)$. This allows us to remove the absolute value:\n$$\ng - S(t) = A \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nRearranging for $S(t)$ gives the general solution:\n$$\nS(t) = g - A \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nTo find the specific value of the constant $A$, we apply the initial condition $S(t=0) = S_{0}(1-\\theta)$:\n$$\nS(0) = g - A \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) = g - A \\exp(0) = g - A\n$$\nEquating this with the initial condition:\n$$\nS_{0}(1-\\theta) = g - A\n$$\n$$\nA = g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the general solution gives the closed-form trajectory for $S(t)$:\n$$\nS(t) = g - (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $S(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nTask 2: Compute the recovery time $\\tau$.\n\nThe recovery time $\\tau$ is defined as the time at which the service capacity returns to $95\\%$ of its original baseline value, i.e., $S(\\tau) = 0.95 S_{0}$. Using the expression for $S(t)$ derived in Task 1:\n$$\n0.95 S_{0} = g - (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)\n$$\nOur goal is to solve for $\\tau$. We rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n(g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) = g - 0.95 S_{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) = \\frac{g - 0.95 S_{0}}{g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\lambda \\tau = \\ln\\left(\\frac{g - 0.95 S_{0}}{g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{g - 0.95 S_{0}}{g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\left[\\frac{g - 0.95 S_{0}}{g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)}\\right]^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)}{g - 0.95 S_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $S_{0}=120$, $\\theta=0.4$, $g=135$, and $\\lambda=0.08$.\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the logarithm:\nThe initial post-shock capacity is $S(0) = S_{0}(1-\\theta) = 120(1 - 0.4) = 120(0.6) = 72$.\nThe target capacity for recovery is $0.95 S_{0} = 0.95 \\times 120 = 114$.\n\nNow, calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction within the logarithm:\nNumerator: $g - S_{0}(1-\\theta) = 135 - 72 = 63$.\nDenominator: $g - 0.95 S_{0} = 135 - 114 = 21$.\n\nSubstitute these values back into the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{0.08} \\ln\\left(\\frac{63}{21}\\right) = \\frac{1}{0.08} \\ln(3)\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.098612$:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1.098612}{0.08} \\approx 13.73265\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the recovery time is $\\tau \\approx 13.73$ days.\n\nTask 3: Determine the signs of partial derivatives and interpret the results.\n\nWe have the expression for the service capacity trajectory:\n$$\nS(t) = g - (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nWe need to find the signs of $\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial g}$ and $\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial \\lambda}$ for $t>0$ under the condition $g>S_{0}(1-\\theta)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivative with respect to the adaptive gain, $g$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial g} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial g} \\left[ g - g\\exp(-\\lambda t) + S_{0}(1-\\theta)\\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial g} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nFor $t>0$ and $\\lambda>0$, the term $\\lambda t$ is positive. Therefore, $0 < \\exp(-\\lambda t) < 1$. Consequently, the term $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is always positive.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial g} > 0 \\quad \\text{for } t>0\n$$\nInterpretation: A positive partial derivative means that increasing the adaptive setpoint $g$ increases the service capacity $S(t)$ at any time $t>0$. In the short term, a higher target $g$ provides a steeper initial recovery gradient. In the long term, as $t \\to \\infty$, $S(t) \\to g$, so a higher $g$ directly corresponds to a higher final steady-state capacity.\n\nSecond, let's find the partial derivative with respect to the recovery rate, $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left[ g - (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial \\lambda} = 0 - (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\cdot (\\exp(-\\lambda t) \\cdot (-t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial \\lambda} = t (g - S_{0}(1-\\theta)) \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nWe are given the condition $g > S_{0}(1-\\theta)$, which means the term $(g - S_{0}(1-\\theta))$ is positive. For $t>0$, the time $t$ is positive. The exponential term $\\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is also always positive. Therefore, the product of three positive terms is positive.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(t)}{\\partial \\lambda} > 0 \\quad \\text{for } t>0\n$$\nInterpretation: A positive partial derivative indicates that increasing the exponential recovery rate $\\lambda$ increases the service capacity $S(t)$ at any time $t>0$. A larger $\\lambda$ signifies a faster relaxation toward the setpoint $g$. This accelerates the recovery trajectory in the short term, meaning the system reaches any given capacity level (short of $g$) more quickly. The long-term capacity, which is $g$, is not affected by $\\lambda$, but a higher $\\lambda$ ensures this target is approached more rapidly.",

Consider the following crisis-response staffing model grounded in core definitions of coverage and capacity constraints and a well-tested linear approximation that models overtime as a primary driver of burnout risk.\n\nDefine decision variables for the Experienced cohort and the Float cohort as follows: for each cohort $i \\in \\{E, F\\}$ and each shift $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$, let $x_{i j}$ denote regular hours assigned and $y_{i j}$ denote overtime hours assigned on that shift.

Overtime-hour limits are $O_{E} = 4$ hours and $O_{F} = 4$ hours over the day.

The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical definitions and constraints. All terms are objective and clearly defined.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is complete, self-consistent, and contains no ambiguities or unrealistic data. It is a non-trivial optimization exercise.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Formulation of the Linear Program\n\nThe objective is to minimize the composite score $Z$. Let's expand the definition of $Z$:\n$$Z = w_1(y_{E1} + y_{F1}) + w_2(y_{E2} + y_{F2})$$\nSubstituting the given weights $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 3$:\n$$Z = 1(y_{E1} + y_{F1}) + 3(y_{E2} + y_{F2}) = y_{E1} + y_{F1} + 3y_{E2} + 3y_{F2}$$\n\nThe constraints, as specified, are:\n1.  **Coverage Constraints**:\n    - Day shift: $x_{E1} + x_{F1} + y_{E1} + y_{F1} \\ge 18$\n    - Night shift: $x_{E2} + x_{F2} + y_{E2} + y_{F2} \\ge 12$\n2.  **Regular-Hour Capacity Constraints**:\n    - Experienced cohort: $x_{E1} + x_{E2} \\le 14$\n    - Float cohort: $x_{F1} + x_{F2} \\le 10$\n3.  **Overtime-Hour Capacity Constraints**:\n    - Experienced cohort: $y_{E1} + y_{E2} \\le 4$\n    - Float cohort: $y_{F1} + y_{F2} \\le 4$\n4.  **Skill-Mix Constraint**:\n    - $x_{F2} \\le 4$\n5.  **Nonnegativity Constraints**:\n    - $x_{E1}, x_{E2}, x_{F1}, x_{F2} \\ge 0$\n    - $y_{E1}, y_{E2}, y_{F1}, y_{F2} \\ge 0$\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Linear Program\n\nThe objective function penalizes overtime hours, with night overtime being three times as costly as day overtime. To minimize $Z$, we should utilize regular hours as effectively as possible.\n\nLet's define total regular hours and overtime hours per shift:\n- Day regular hours: $X_1 = x_{E1} + x_{F1}$\n- Night regular hours: $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2}$\n- Day overtime hours: $Y_1 = y_{E1} + y_{F1}$\n- Night overtime hours: $Y_2 = y_{E2} + y_{F2}$\n\nThe objective function becomes: Minimize $Z = Y_1 + 3Y_2$.\n\nSince overtime is costly, we will only use it to meet demand not covered by regular hours. Thus, the coverage constraints will be met with equality by the sum of regular and overtime hours, unless regular hours alone exceed demand.\n$Y_1 = \\max(0, 18 - X_1)$\n$Y_2 = \\max(0, 12 - X_2)$\n\nThe total demand is $D_1 + D_2 = 18 + 12 = 30$ hours.\nThe total available regular hour capacity is $R_E + R_F = 14 + 10 = 24$ hours.\nSince total regular capacity ($24$ hours) is less than total demand ($30$ hours), overtime is unavoidable. The minimum total overtime required is $30 - 24 = 6$ hours. This occurs if and only if all $24$ regular hours are utilized. Any solution that uses fewer than $24$ regular hours will require more than $6$ hours of total overtime, which will likely increase the cost $Z$. Let's assume for optimality that we utilize all regular hours.\n\nThis implies:\n$x_{E1} + x_{E2} = 14$\n$x_{F1} + x_{F2} = 10$\nThe total regular hours are allocated completely, so $X_1 + X_2 = (x_{E1}+x_{E2}) + (x_{F1}+x_{F2}) = 14 + 10 = 24$.\nThe overtime hours must cover the remaining deficit:\n$Y_1 = 18 - X_1$\n$Y_2 = 12 - X_2$\nThe total overtime is $Y_1 + Y_2 = (18 - X_1) + (12 - X_2) = 30 - (X_1 + X_2) = 30 - 24 = 6$ hours.\n\nNow, we can express the objective function in terms of a single variable, for instance, the night-shift regular hours $X_2$:\n$X_1 = 24 - X_2$\n$Y_1 = 18 - (24 - X_2) = X_2 - 6$\n$Y_2 = 12 - X_2$\n$Z = Y_1 + 3Y_2 = (X_2 - 6) + 3(12 - X_2) = X_2 - 6 + 36 - 3X_2 = 30 - 2X_2$.\n\nTo minimize $Z$, we must maximize $X_2$, the number of regular hours assigned to the night shift, subject to all constraints.\nThis includes the regular hour constraints and the feasibility of the resulting overtime assignment.\n\nLet's determine the feasible range for $X_2$ under the condition that $X_1 + X_2 = 24$.\nA regular hour allocation $(x_{ij})$ is feasible if:\n1. $x_{E1} + x_{E2} = 14$\n2. $x_{F1} + x_{F2} = 10$\n3. $x_{F2} \\le 4$\n4. $x_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $i,j$.\n\nFrom these, we can determine the valid range for $X_2 = x_{E2}+x_{F2}$. We must be able to express $x_{ij}$ in terms of $X_2$ and satisfy the constraints. Let $X_2 = k$.\n$x_{E1} = 14 - x_{E2}$\n$x_{F1} = 10 - x_{F2}$\n$X_1 = x_{E1}+x_{F1} = (14-x_{E2}) + (10-x_{F2}) = 24 - (x_{E2}+x_{F2}) = 24-k$. This is consistent.\nWe must satisfy $x_{ij} \\ge 0$ and $x_{F2} \\le 4$.\nFrom $x_{F2} \\le 4$ and $x_{E2} = k - x_{F2}$, we have $x_{E2} \\ge k-4$.\nFrom $x_{E2} \\le 14$ (since $x_{E1} \\ge 0$), the maximum value for $X_2 = x_{E2}+x_{F2}$ is limited.\nLet's find the maximum possible value for $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2}$. To maximize this sum, we should maximize its components.\nMaximum $x_{F2}$ is $4$.\nMaximum $x_{E2}$ is $14$ (when $x_{E1}=0$).\nThis gives a theoretical max $X_2 = 14+4=18$.\nLet's check if $X_2=12$ is achievable. If $X_2 = 12$, then $X_1=12$.\nWe need to find $x_{ij}$ such that:\n$x_{E2}+x_{F2}=12$\n$x_{E1}+x_{F1}=12$\n$x_{E1}+x_{E2}=14$\n$x_{F1}+x_{F2}=10$\n$x_{F2} \\le 4$ and $x_{ij} \\ge 0$.\n\nFrom $x_{E2}+x_{F2}=12$ and $x_{F2} \\le 4$, we must have $x_{E2} \\ge 8$.\nFrom $x_{E1}+x_{E2}=14$, it follows that $x_{E1} = 14 - x_{E2} \\le 14 - 8 = 6$. So, $x_{E1} \\le 6$.\nFrom $x_{F1}+x_{F2}=10$, it follows that $x_{F1} = 10 - x_{F2}$. Since $x_{F2} \\le 4$, $x_{F1} \\ge 6$.\nWe must satisfy $x_{E1}+x_{F1}=12$ with $x_{E1} \\le 6$ and $x_{F1} \\ge 6$. The only solution is $x_{E1}=6$ and $x_{F1}=6$.\nThis gives a unique allocation for regular hours:\n- $x_{E1} = 6$\n- $x_{F1} = 6$\n- $x_{E2} = 14 - x_{E1} = 14 - 6 = 8$\n- $x_{F2} = 10 - x_{F1} = 10 - 6 = 4$\nThis allocation satisfies all regular hour constraints: $x_{E1}+x_{E2}=14$, $x_{F1}+x_{F2}=10$, $x_{F2}=4 \\le 4$, and all $x_{ij} \\ge 0$.\nSo, it is possible to have $X_2=12$.\n\nIf $X_2=12$, then $X_1=12$.\nThe required overtime is:\n$Y_1 = 18 - X_1 = 18 - 12 = 6$\n$Y_2 = 12 - X_2 = 12 - 12 = 0$\nThe objective function value would be $Z = Y_1 + 3Y_2 = 6 + 3(0) = 6$.\n\nWe must verify if this overtime plan ($Y_1=6, Y_2=0$) is feasible.\nWe need to find $y_{ij} \\ge 0$ such that:\n- $y_{E1} + y_{F1} = 6$\n- $y_{E2} + y_{F2} = 0 \\implies y_{E2}=0, y_{F2}=0$\n- $y_{E1} + y_{E2} \\le 4 \\implies y_{E1} + 0 \\le 4 \\implies y_{E1} \\le 4$\n- $y_{F1} + y_{F2} \\le 4 \\implies y_{F1} + 0 \\le 4 \\implies y_{F1} \\le 4$\n\nWe need to find $y_{E1}$ and $y_{F1}$ such that $y_{E1}+y_{F1}=6$ while $y_{E1} \\le 4$ and $y_{F1} \\le 4$.\nThis is feasible. For example, we can choose $y_{E1}=2, y_{F1}=4$ or $y_{E1}=3, y_{F1}=3$ or $y_{E1}=4, y_{F1}=2$.\nSince a feasible allocation exists for both regular and overtime hours, the value $Z=6$ is achievable.\n\nTo confirm this is the minimum, we must confirm that we cannot achieve $X_2 > 12$. If we could, $Z = 30-2X_2$ would be even smaller.\nLet's test if $X_2 > 12$ is possible.\nIf $X_2=12+\\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, then $X_1=12-\\epsilon$.\nThen we need $x_{E2}+x_{F2}=12+\\epsilon$. With $x_{F2}\\le 4$, we need $x_{E2} \\ge 8+\\epsilon$.\nThis implies $x_{E1}=14-x_{E2} \\le 14-(8+\\epsilon) = 6-\\epsilon$.\nAlso, $x_{F1}=10-x_{F2} \\ge 10-4=6$.\nWe need to satisfy $x_{E1}+x_{F1}=12-\\epsilon$.\nBut the sum of the maximum possible $x_{E1}$ ($6-\\epsilon$) and the minimum possible $x_{F1}$ ($6$) is $(6-\\epsilon)+6=12-\\epsilon$. This indicates that for a solution to exist, we must have $x_{E1}=6-\\epsilon$ and $x_{F1}=6$, which implies $x_{E2}=8+\\epsilon$ and $x_{F2}=4$.\nHowever, the required overtime would be $Y_1 = X_2-6 = (12+\\epsilon)-6 = 6+\\epsilon$ and $Y_2 = 12-X_2 = 12-(12+\\epsilon)=-\\epsilon$. But overtime cannot be negative, so $Y_2=\\max(0, -\\epsilon)=0$.\nThe problem is that the formula $Z = 30-2X_2$ is valid only for $6 \\le X_2 \\le 12$.\nFor $X_2 > 12$, $Y_1 = X_2-6$ and $Y_2=0$, so $Z = Y_1+3Y_2 = X_2-6+0=X_2-6$. This function increases with $X_2$.\nThe minimum of this branch is at its lowest valid point, $X_2=12$, where $Z=12-6=6$.\n\nTherefore, the function $Z(X_2)$ is minimized at $X_2=12$.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- For $X_2 \\in [6, 12]$, $Z(X_2) = 30-2X_2$, a decreasing function. Its minimum on this interval is at $X_2=12$, giving $Z=6$.\n- For $X_2 \\in (12, 14]$, $Z(X_2) = X_2-6$, an increasing function. Its minimum on this interval is approached as $X_2 \\to 12$, which is $Z=6$.\nThe analysis is more complex for $X_2 < 6$ and for ensuring overtime feasibility, but the logic holds that $X_2=12$ is the optimal point.\n\nThe minimal composite overtime-burnout score $Z$ is $6$.",
