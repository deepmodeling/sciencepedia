As each label inspection is an independent trial with two outcomes (defective or not defective) and a constant probability of defect, $p$, $X$ follows a binomial distribution.\n$$\nX \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)\n$$\nThe mean (expected value) and variance of this binomial random variable are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_X = E[X] = np\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_X^2 = \\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)\n$$\nThe sample proportion, denoted by $\\hat{p}$, is the statistic plotted on a $p$-chart. It is defined as the number of defects divided by the sample size:\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n}\n$$\nThe sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ has a mean and variance that can be derived from the properties of $X$. The mean of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n$$\nE[\\hat{p}] = E\\left[\\frac{X}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}E[X] = \\frac{1}{n}(np) = p\n$$\nThe variance of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{X}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{n^2}[np(1-p)] = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of $\\hat{p}$, known as the standard error of the proportion, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n$$\nAs per the problem statement, we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to approximate the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$. For a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normal, with the mean and variance derived above.\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\approx N\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)\n$$\nThe control limits for a Shewhart chart are conventionally set at a distance of $k$ standard deviations from the center line. For this problem, we use $k=3$. The center line (CL) of the $p$-chart is the expected value of the process proportion, which is $p$.\n$$\n\\text{CL} = p\n$$\nThe Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL) are therefore:\n$$\n\\text{UCL} = \\text{CL} + 3\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = p + 3\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{LCL} = \\text{CL} - 3\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = p - 3\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the general form of the control limits.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for the given parameters: $p=0.12$ and $n=100$.\nFirst, we verify the condition for the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The rule of thumb is that both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ should be greater than or equal to $5$.\n$$\nnp = 100 \\times 0.12 = 12\n$$\n$$\nn(1-p) = 100 \\times (1-0.12) = 100 \\times 0.88 = 88\n$$\nSince $12 \\ge 5$ and $88 \\ge 5$, the normal approximation is justified.\n\nThe center line is $\\text{CL} = p = 0.12$.\nThe standard deviation of the sample proportion is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.12(1-0.12)}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.12 \\times 0.88}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1056}{100}} = \\sqrt{0.001056} \\approx 0.03249615\n$$\nThe three-standard-deviation term is:\n$$\n3\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} \\approx 3 \\times 0.03249615 = 0.09748846\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the control limits:\n$$\n\\text{UCL} = 0.12 + 0.09748846 = 0.21748846\n$$\n$$\n\\text{LCL} = 0.12 - 0.09748846 = 0.02251154\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the LCL should be truncated at $0$ if it is negative. In this case, the calculated LCL ($0.02251154$) is positive, so no truncation is necessary.\n\nFinally, we round the limits to four significant figures.\nFor the UCL, $0.21748846...$, the first four significant figures are $2$, $1$, $7$, $4$. The fifth digit is $8$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{UCL} \\approx 0.2175\n$$\nFor the LCL, $0.02251154...$, the first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $5$, $1$. The fifth digit is $1$, so we do not round up.\n$$\n\\text{LCL} \\approx 0.02251\n$$\nThe final control limits are $\\text{LCL} = 0.02251$ and $\\text{UCL} = 0.2175$.",

Specific data patterns can signal that a process has fundamentally changed, for better or for worse.

            "problem": "A hospital emergency department is conducting a quality improvement test within the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle to reduce average patient triage time. Under the baseline, the daily mean triage time is approximately normally distributed with mean $\\mu = 40$ minutes and standard deviation $\\sigma = 8$ minutes. During the Do phase, a fast-track triage change is introduced. Over $3$ consecutive days, the observed daily mean triage times are $57$ minutes, $60$ minutes, and $55$ minutes, respectively. A control chart is maintained with a centerline at $\\mu$ and control limits consistent with Statistical Process Control (SPC) conventions. Two of the $3$ successive points exceed $\\mu + 2\\sigma = 56$ minutes and all three are on the same side of the centerline.\n\nUsing core definitions of common-cause versus special-cause variation, the assumption of approximate normality and independence under a stable process, and the Western Electric rules, determine whether the pattern constitutes a signal of special cause. Derive an approximate probability that a stable, in-control process would produce the pattern “$2$ of $3$ successive points beyond $+2\\sigma$ on the same side” purely by chance. Then, based on health systems science principles for the Act phase of the PDSA cycle, select the most appropriate action for this situation, given that the signal is in the undesired direction relative to the aim (triage times have increased).\n\nWhich option best reflects the appropriate Act phase decision?\n\nA. Treat the pattern as common-cause variation, make no specific changes, and immediately refresh the control limits to include the latest points before continuing the same test.\n\nB.

Consider any out-of-control signal as requiring a full halt of clinical operations and a comprehensive root-cause analysis before any further PDSA activity; suspend workflows until new limits are calculated.\n\nE. Defer action until there are $8$ consecutive points on the same side of the centerline, because only that pattern indicates a true shift; continue the current test unchanged for now.",
            "solution": "Begin from the core definitions in Statistical Process Control (SPC). Under a stable process with independent observations that are approximately normally distributed, a control chart with centerline at the process mean $\\mu$ and limits derived from the process standard deviation $\\sigma$ is used to distinguish common-cause variation from special-cause variation. Common-cause variation represents the inherent system variability, whereas special-cause variation indicates a nonrandom, assignable cause. The Western Electric rules are a well-tested set of criteria for detecting special-cause signals; one such rule is that “$2$ of $3$ successive points beyond $2\\sigma$ on the same side of the centerline” indicates special cause.\n\nIn the scenario, the baseline mean and standard deviation are $\\mu = 40$ minutes and $\\sigma = 8$ minutes, so $\\mu + 2\\sigma = 40 + 16 = 56$ minutes. The observed daily means over $3$ consecutive days are $57$ minutes, $60$ minutes, and $55$ minutes. Two of these ($57$ and $60$) exceed $56$ minutes, and all three are above the centerline $\\mu$, so the pattern matches “$2$ of $3$ beyond $+2\\sigma$ on the same side.” The question asks whether this should be considered special cause and to quantify how likely such a pattern would occur in an in-control process purely by chance.\n\nUnder the assumption of normality and independence, for a single observation $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$, the probability that $X$ exceeds $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ is\n$$\np = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z > 2\\right) = 1 - \\Phi(2) \\approx 0.0228,\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is a standard normal variable and $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. The probability that, in $3$ independent trials, exactly $2$ of the $3$ points exceed $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ is\n$$\n\\binom{3}{2} p^{2} (1-p),\n$$\nand the probability that all $3$ exceed $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ is\n$$\np^{3}.\n$$\nTherefore, the probability of the event “$2$ of $3$ successive points beyond $+2\\sigma$” on the upper side is\n$$\n\\binom{3}{2} p^{2} (1-p) + p^{3} = 3 p^{2} (1-p) + p^{3}.\n$$\nWith $p \\approx 0.0228$, compute\n$$\np^{2} \\approx (0.0228)^{2} \\approx 0.00051984,\\quad 1-p \\approx 0.9772,\n$$\n$$\n3 p^{2} (1-p) \\approx 3 \\times 0.00051984 \\times 0.9772 \\approx 3 \\times 0.000508 \\approx 0.001524,\n$$\n$$\np^{3} \\approx (0.0228)^{3} \\approx 0.0000119,\n$$\nso\n$$\n3 p^{2} (1-p) + p^{3} \\approx 0.001524 + 0.0000119 \\approx 0.001536.\n$$\nThus, the chance of observing “$2$ of $3$ beyond $+2\\sigma$” purely by common-cause variation on the upper side is approximately $0.1536\\%$. If one were considering “either side” (upper or lower), the chance would roughly double, to about $0.3072\\%$. Either way, this is rare and supports classification as special cause per the Western Electric rules.\n\nIn the PDSA framework (Plan-Do-Study-Act), the Act phase decisions depend on whether the special-cause signal is in the desired direction relative to the aim. Here, the aim is to reduce triage time, but the points are above the baseline and two exceed $+2\\sigma$, indicating deterioration in the undesired direction. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat this as special cause adverse to the aim, investigate attribution to the change (and context), and either abandon or adapt the change. Immediate recalculation of the centerline and limits is not recommended based on $3$ data points; recalibration is appropriate only after evidence of a sustained shift and stability at a new level. Clinical operations should not be halted; instead, the team should implement safe mitigations, reflect on learning, and plan the next PDSA cycle to address the observed causes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This recommends treating the pattern as common cause and refreshing control limits immediately. Given the calculated probability (approximately $0.001536$ on one side), the pattern is highly unlikely under common cause and matches a Western Electric special-cause rule. Refreshing limits to include special-cause points without understanding the cause can mask signals and is not appropriate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This identifies the pattern as a Western Electric special-cause signal and, because it is in the undesired direction, advises abandoning or adapting the change, investigating attribution, and not recalculating limits immediately, while planning the next cycle. This aligns with SPC and PDSA principles and is the appropriate action. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This asserts an approximate probability of $5\\%$ for two of three beyond $+2\\sigma$, which is a substantial overestimate; the correct probability is about $0.1536\\%$ on one side. It then suggests adopting the change despite an adverse signal. Both the probability and the recommended action are inappropriate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This prescribes halting clinical operations entirely upon an out-of-control signal, which is neither standard nor safe in health systems improvement. Quality improvement addresses processes while maintaining care; it does not mandate suspension of workflows. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This defers action until there are $8$ consecutive points on one side, a different rule that detects sustained shifts. The Western Electric “$2$ of $3$ beyond $2\\sigma$” rule is also valid for special cause, and ignoring it would miss an important signal, especially when adverse to the aim. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.",

            "introduction": "Effective improvement science requires not just knowing how to perform a calculation, but understanding which calculation is appropriate. A common pitfall is applying statistical methods from traditional research, like t-tests and p-values, to the iterative learning context of PDSA. This practice  presents a realistic scenario of this misuse, pushing you to critique the approach and articulate why time-series tools like run charts or control charts are epistemically better aligned with the goals of PDSA.",

            "problem": "An interprofessional team at a community hospital uses the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) method to reduce the percentage of patients who leave without being seen (LWBS) in the emergency department. In the first cycle, they standardize a triage script for intake nurses. They collect a baseline of $10$ days with a mean LWBS of $6.5\\%$, then run the change for $10$ subsequent days with a mean LWBS of $4.2\\%$. A team member runs a two-sample $t$-test treating the two periods as independent samples and reports a $p$-value of $p=0.03$. On this basis, the team proposes to declare the intervention successful and to spread it immediately to all hospital departments.\n\nYou are asked to critique this proposal by contrasting the epistemic goals of improvement work using PDSA with those of confirmatory hypothesis testing in biostatistics. Base your reasoning on core definitions: PDSA aims for rapid, iterative learning in a specific system using time-ordered data; confirmatory hypothesis testing aims to control prespecified error rates (for example, Type I error at $\\alpha=0.05$) to make generalizable inferences about population parameters under assumptions such as independent and identically distributed observations, fixed sampling plans, and pre-specified analyses.\n\nWhich option best reflects a correct critique of the proposed use of statistical significance and recommends an analysis approach aligned with PDSA’s epistemic goals?\n\nA. Because $p0.05$, the change caused a real reduction in LWBS; the correct next step in improvement is to implement and spread the intervention across departments.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a realistic scenario in health systems science that highlights the epistemological tension between the goals of quality improvement (represented by PDSA cycles) and the methods of traditional confirmatory biostatistics (represented by null hypothesis significance testing, or NHST). The definitions provided are correct and sufficient to proceed with a critical analysis.\n\nThe core of the issue is the application of a confirmatory statistical tool, the two-sample $t$-test, to a context of sequential, iterative learning. The team's conclusion is problematic for several fundamental reasons.\n\nFirst, the assumptions of the two-sample $t$-test are violated. The test requires the two samples to be independent. However, the data consist of $10$ consecutive days of a baseline period followed by $10$ consecutive days of an intervention period within the *same* system. This is time-series data, not two independent draws from separate populations. The LWBS percentage on a given day is likely correlated with the percentage on preceding days (autocorrelation), violating the independence assumption. Furthermore, the data points within each period are not guaranteed to be identically distributed. The underlying process may have its own trends or shifts unrelated to the intervention. Simply comparing the two means, $6.5\\%$ and $4.2\\%$, ignores the process behavior over time.\n\nSecond, there is a profound mismatch in epistemic goals, as the prompt directs us to consider.\n- The goal of the $t$-test and its associated $p$-value of $p=0.03$ is to make an inference about unknown population parameters and control long-run error rates (specifically, the Type I error rate, $\\alpha$). It is designed for confirmatory research, where a pre-specified hypothesis is tested with a fixed experimental design.\n- The goal of PDSA is rapid, iterative learning and improvement *within a specific, local context*. It is a framework for building knowledge sequentially, where each cycle informs the next. The aim is not to \"prove\" a hypothesis for a general population but to develop a sufficient degree of belief that a change is an improvement in the current system, justifying the next action (adopt, adapt, or abandon).\n\nThe team's proposal to declare success and spread the intervention based on a single $p$-value from a small, methodologically flawed pre/post comparison is a classic error of confounding the tools of research with the tools of improvement. The $p$-value, in this context, is a \"so-what\" statistic. It does not provide the right kind of information for the decision at hand.\n\nA more appropriate analysis, aligned with the goals of PDSA, would treat the data as a time series. The \"Study\" phase of PDSA should involve plotting the daily LWBS percentage over the entire $20$-day period on a run chart or a statistical process control (SPC) chart. This visualization allows the team to assess the process's stability during the baseline period and to look for evidence of a non-random change coinciding with the intervention. For example, a run chart would test for a shift in the process center-line (median), and a control chart would test if post-intervention data points fall outside control limits calculated from the baseline data. This approach focuses on understanding variation over time, which is the central tenet of quality improvement, rather than on a simple comparison of averages that discards crucial temporal information.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options based on this critique.\n\nA. Because $p0.05$, the change caused a real reduction in LWBS; the correct next step in improvement is to implement and spread the intervention across departments.\nThis option fully embraces the flawed reasoning. It incorrectly interprets the $p0.05$ threshold as proof of a causal effect and recommends premature, large-scale implementation. This ignores the methodological violations of the $t$-test and the iterative, local learning philosophy of PDSA. Spreading an intervention from a single emergency department to \"all hospital departments\" based on such flimsy evidence is reckless. **Incorrect**.\n\nB. In PDSA, short, adaptively collected pre/post samples and time-varying processes make null-hypothesis $p$-values poor evidence for learning; instead, articulate explicit predictions and examine time-ordered data with run charts or control charts to detect non-random signals while iterating changes locally.\nThis option provides a precisely correct critique. It identifies the key problems with using NHST in this context: small, sequential (adaptive) samples and the time-series nature of the process. It correctly proposes the alternative methodology that is aligned with PDSA's epistemic goals: making predictions (the \"Plan\" stage) and studying time-ordered data with appropriate tools (run charts or control charts) to learn about the system's response to a change. It also correctly emphasizes local iteration over premature spread. **Correct**.\n\nC. The primary problem is low statistical power; the team should delay making any changes until they can randomize patients and collect a much larger sample to achieve at least $80\\%$ power at $\\alpha=0.05$.\nThis option misdiagnoses the fundamental problem. The issue is not a lack of statistical power; it is the inappropriateness of the entire NHST framework for this purpose. This option suggests converting the improvement project into a formal randomized controlled trial (RCT). While RCTs are valuable for confirmatory research, their time and resource requirements are antithetical to the rapid, iterative nature of PDSA. The goal of PDSA is to learn and improve *now* in a specific context, not to wait for generalizable proof. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. To fix the misuse, retain $p$-values as the decision rule but apply a Bonferroni correction across PDSA cycles to control the family-wise Type I error rate while continuing to test sequentially.\nThis option attempts a statistical fix within the wrong paradigm. Applying a Bonferroni correction addresses the multiple comparisons problem that arises from sequential testing, but it does not fix the fundamental violations of the $t$-test's assumptions (e.g., independence) or the philosophical mismatch between NHST and PDSA. It grafts a layer of statistical rigor onto a foundationally inappropriate method, making it harder to detect changes without providing more meaningful insight for improvement. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Replace $p$-values with $95\\%$ confidence intervals for the pre/post difference; if the interval excludes $0$, the improvement is proven and ready to spread.\nThis option demonstrates a common misunderstanding. A $95\\%$ confidence interval that excludes the value $0$ for a difference in means is mathematically equivalent to obtaining a $p$-value less than $0.05$ from a two-sided $t$-test. Switching from a $p$-value to a confidence interval here is merely a change in presentation, not a change in the underlying statistical framework (NHST). It is subject to the same violations of assumptions and the same epistemological mismatch. It does not solve the core problem. **Incorrect**.",
