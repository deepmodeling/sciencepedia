            "problem": "A hospital’s medication-use process improvement team conducts a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to prioritize mitigations for patient-safety hazards. In FMEA, each hazard is rated on three ordinal scales from $1$ to $10$: severity ($1$ is negligible harm and $10$ is catastrophic harm), occurrence ($1$ is extremely rare and $10$ is very frequent), and detection ($1$ is very likely to be detected before causing harm and $10$ is very unlikely to be detected). Higher values indicate worse risk characteristics. The team has identified $4$ hazards, labeled $H_1$ through $H_4$, with the following current ratings, and has proposed one mitigation for each hazard with predicted post-mitigation ratings and estimated implementation effort (in person-hours):\n\n- $H_1$ (wrong-patient medication administration due to barcode scanner timeouts): current severity $S_1 = 9$, occurrence $O_1 = 3$, detection $D_1 = 7$. Proposed mitigation $M_1$: post-mitigation $S_1' = 9$, $O_1' = 2$, $D_1' = 4$, effort $E_1 = 40$ person-hours.\n- $H_2$ (alert fatigue leading to override of critical drug–drug interaction alerts): current severity $S_2 = 8$, occurrence $O_2 = 6$, detection $D_2 = 8$. Proposed mitigation $M_2$: post-mitigation $S_2' = 8$, $O_2' = 4$, $D_2' = 6$, effort $E_2 = 55$ person-hours.\n- $H_3$ (look-alike vials selected in an automated dispensing cabinet): current severity $S_3 = 7$, occurrence $O_3 = 5$, detection $D_3 = 6$. Proposed mitigation $M_3$: post-mitigation $S_3' = 7$, $O_3' = 3$, $D_3' = 3$, effort $E_3 = 25$ person-hours.\n- $H_4$ (milligram versus milliliter confusion in the order entry user interface): current severity $S_4 = 10$, occurrence $O_4 = 2$, detection $D_4 = 6$. Proposed mitigation $M_4$: post-mitigation $S_4' = 10$, $O_4' = 1$, $D_4' = 3$, effort $E_4 = 50$ person-hours.\n\nUsing standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis practice, do the following:\n- For each hazard $H_i$, calculate the risk priority number using the given severity, occurrence, and detection ratings.\n- For each proposed mitigation $M_i$, calculate the post-mitigation risk priority number and the expected absolute reduction in risk priority.\n- Define for each $i$ a benefit-per-effort ratio equal to the expected absolute reduction in risk priority divided by the effort $E_i$.\n\nPrioritize which single mitigation to implement first according to the following explicit criteria:\n$1)$ maximize the benefit-per-effort ratio; $2)$ if two or more mitigations tie on that ratio, choose the one with the larger pre-mitigation severity; $3)$ if still tied, choose the one with the larger pre-mitigation occurrence; $4)$ if still tied, choose the one with the larger pre-mitigation detection.\n\nWhat is the index $i$ of the hazard whose mitigation should be implemented first? Report only the integer $i$ as your final answer. No rounding is necessary and no units are required in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to prioritize one of four proposed mitigations ($M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4$) for four identified hazards ($H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$) based on a specific set of criteria derived from a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The process involves several calculations for each hazard and its proposed mitigation.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the pre-mitigation Risk Priority Number ($RPN_i$) for each hazard $H_i$. The $RPN$ is defined as the product of the severity ($S$), occurrence ($O$), and detection ($D$) ratings.\n$$RPN_i = S_i \\times O_i \\times D_i$$\nUsing the provided pre-mitigation data:\nFor hazard $H_1$, with $S_1 = 9$, $O_1 = 3$, and $D_1 = 7$:\n$$RPN_1 = 9 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 189$$\nFor hazard $H_2$, with $S_2 = 8$, $O_2 = 6$, and $D_2 = 8$:\n$$RPN_2 = 8 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 384$$\nFor hazard $H_3$, with $S_3 = 7$, $O_3 = 5$, and $D_3 = 6$:\n$$RPN_3 = 7 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 210$$\nFor hazard $H_4$, with $S_4 = 10$, $O_4 = 2$, and $D_4 = 6$:\n$$RPN_4 = 10 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 120$$\n\nNext, we calculate the post-mitigation Risk Priority Number ($RPN_i'$) for each proposed mitigation $M_i$. The formula remains the same, but uses the post-mitigation ratings ($S_i', O_i', D_i'$).\n$$RPN_i' = S_i' \\times O_i' \\times D_i'$$\nUsing the provided post-mitigation data:\nFor mitigation $M_1$, with $S_1' = 9$, $O_1' = 2$, and $D_1' = 4$:\n$$RPN_1' = 9 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 72$$\nFor mitigation $M_2$, with $S_2' = 8$, $O_2' = 4$, and $D_2' = 6$:\n$$RPN_2' = 8 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 192$$\nFor mitigation $M_3$, with $S_3' = 7$, $O_3' = 3$, and $D_3' = 3$:\n$$RPN_3' = 7 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 63$$\nFor mitigation $M_4$, with $S_4' = 10$, $O_4' = 1$, and $D_4' = 3$:\n$$RPN_4' = 10 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 30$$\n\nThe third step is to calculate the absolute reduction in the risk priority number, $\\Delta RPN_i$, for each mitigation.\n$$\\Delta RPN_i = RPN_i - RPN_i'$$\nFor $M_1$: $\\Delta RPN_1 = 189 - 72 = 117$.\nFor $M_2$: $\\Delta RPN_2 = 384 - 192 = 192$.\nFor $M_3$: $\\Delta RPN_3 = 210 - 63 = 147$.\nFor $M_4$: $\\Delta RPN_4 = 120 - 30 = 90$.\n\nThe fourth step is to calculate the benefit-per-effort ratio, $B_i$, for each mitigation. This is defined as the absolute reduction in $RPN$ divided by the implementation effort, $E_i$.\n$$B_i = \\frac{\\Delta RPN_i}{E_i}$$\nThe efforts are given as $E_1 = 40$, $E_2 = 55$, $E_3 = 25$, and $E_4 = 50$ person-hours.\nFor $M_1$: $B_1 = \\frac{117}{40} = 2.925$.\nFor $M_2$: $B_2 = \\frac{192}{55} \\approx 3.4909$.\nFor $M_3$: $B_3 = \\frac{147}{25} = 5.88$.\nFor $M_4$: $B_4 = \\frac{90}{50} = 1.8$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the specified prioritization criteria to determine which mitigation to implement first.\nCriterion $1$: Maximize the benefit-per-effort ratio, $B_i$.\nComparing the calculated ratios:\n$B_1 = 2.925$\n$B_2 \\approx 3.4909$\n$B_3 = 5.88$\n$B_4 = 1.8$\n\nThe maximum value is $B_3 = 5.88$. Since there is a unique maximum value, we do not need to apply the tie-breaking criteria (criteria $2$, $3$, and $4$).\n\nThe mitigation with the highest priority is $M_3$, which corresponds to hazard $H_3$. The problem asks for the index $i$ of this hazard. Therefore, the answer is $3$.",

Prior to BCMA, the observed wrong-drug administration error rate was $2$ errors per $10{,}000$ administrations. After BCMA adoption, workflows exhibit the following characteristics grounded in human factors engineering considerations:\n\n- Scanning compliance: on any given medication administration, the probability that the clinician performs a barcode scan is $0.85$.\n- Work-around behavior: conditional on scanning, the probability that a mismatch alert is overridden or the scan is otherwise bypassed (so that a mismatch is not acted upon) is $0.05$.\n- Technical and human detection effectiveness: conditional on scanning and not overriding, the probability that BCMA prevents a wrong-drug error that would have occurred without BCMA is $0.92$.\n\nAssume the following first-principles model:\n- The baseline wrong-drug error probability per administration is constant and equal to the pre-BCMA rate.\n- Scanning, override behavior, and prevention effectiveness are independent of the underlying occurrence of wrong-drug errors except through the prevention mechanism.\n- BCMA does not introduce new wrong-drug errors; when scanning is overridden or fails to prevent, the wrong-drug error risk remains at the baseline level.\n\nUsing only basic probability laws and these definitions, compute the expected absolute reduction in wrong-drug administration errors per $10{,}000$ administrations after adopting BCMA.
