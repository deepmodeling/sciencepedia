            "problem": "A primary care clinic is evaluating its intake process using Lean and Six Sigma principles. In the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) framework, a process analyst observes the end-to-end intake cycle time (from patient check-in start to readiness for clinician handoff) for five consecutive patients during a single, typical clinic session. The observed cycle times are $[6, 8, 7, 9, 6]$ minutes. In parallel, a structured observation identifies non-value-added elements: patients are routinely waiting while a medical assistant logs into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (login delay of about $1$ minute), staff walks to a shared hallway printer to retrieve labels (about $0.5$ minute of walking per patient), and insurance questions are asked twice due to a paper form and a later EHR field entry (duplicative questioning totaling about $1$ minute).\n\nStarting from the core definitions of value-added time, non-value-added time (waste), sample mean, and sample standard deviation, do the following:\n- Compute the sample mean of the observed intake cycle times.\n- Compute the sample standard deviation of the observed intake cycle times.\n- Identify at least two Lean waste categories that are consistent with the observation notes and justify your classification briefly.\n- Propose a single Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) hypothesis as a testable countermeasure aimed at reducing the intake cycle time that is feasible within one week.\n\nFor grading, report only the sample standard deviation as your final answer. Express the final standard deviation in minutes and round your final answer to $3$ significant figures. Do not include units in your final boxed answer. All intermediate computations and reasoning should be based on the stated definitions and observations and should remain consistent with Lean and Six Sigma methodology in healthcare operations.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of health systems science and industrial engineering (Lean, Six Sigma). It is well-posed, with a self-contained and consistent set of data and definitions sufficient for the required calculations and qualitative analysis. The language is objective and the scenario presented is realistic.\n\nThe problem asks for several computations and qualitative analyses based on a set of observed data for a clinic's intake process. The provided dataset for the cycle times is $X = \\{6, 8, 7, 9, 6\\}$ minutes. The sample size is $n=5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) of the observed intake cycle times. The sample mean is defined as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations.\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{6 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 6}{5} = \\frac{36}{5} = 7.2 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the sample standard deviation ($s$) of the observed intake cycle times. The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance ($s^2$), which measures the average squared deviation of each observation from the sample mean. The formula for the sample variance uses a denominator of $n-1$ to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance.\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\nWe first calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean, using $\\bar{x} = 7.2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (6 - 7.2)^2 + (8 - 7.2)^2 + (7 - 7.2)^2 + (9 - 7.2)^2 + (6 - 7.2)^2\n$$\n$$\n= (-1.2)^2 + (0.8)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (1.8)^2 + (-1.2)^2\n$$\n$$\n= 1.44 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 3.24 + 1.44 = 6.8\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the sample variance:\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{6.8}{n-1} = \\frac{6.8}{5-1} = \\frac{6.8}{4} = 1.7 \\text{ minutes}^2\n$$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{1.7} \\approx 1.30384048... \\text{ minutes}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\ns \\approx 1.30 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\nThird, we identify at least two Lean waste categories from the observation notes. Lean methodology identifies several types of waste (muda), commonly remembered with acronyms like TIMWOODS or DOWNTIME.\n1.  **Waiting**: The observation that patients wait while a medical assistant logs into the EHR system for about $1$ minute is a direct example of the waste of waiting. Time is lost when people or processes are idle.\n2.  **Transportation/Motion**: The staff's walk to a shared hallway printer (about $0.5$ minutes) is an example of unnecessary movement. This can be classified as the waste of Transportation (unnecessary movement of materials or people between processes) or Motion (unnecessary movement of people within a process). Given the walk is to a shared resource external to the immediate workspace, Transportation is an apt classification.\n3.  **Extra-Processing**: Asking for insurance information twice (once on paper, once in the EHR), totaling about $1$ minute, is a clear example of the waste of extra-processing. This involves performing more work than is necessary, including re-entering data, rework, and redundant approvals.\n\nFinally, we propose a single Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) hypothesis as a testable countermeasure. The PDSA cycle is a framework for iterative improvement. A good hypothesis must be specific, testable, and feasible. Targeting the EHR login delay is a rapidly testable change.\nA valid PDSA hypothesis would be: \"If we implement a new standard procedure where medical assistants log into the EHR system at the start of their clinic session and keep the session active, then we predict the average non-value-added time per patient intake will decrease by approximately $1$ minute, as measured by direct observation of the next $5$ patient intakes.\" This hypothesis proposes a small-scale, low-cost change (the \"Plan\"), outlines its implementation (the \"Do\"), and defines the expected outcome and measurement method (for the \"Study\" and \"Act\" phases).",

            "problem": "A hospital’s outpatient care pathway consists of three sequential steps: Step 1 (registration), Step 2 (clinical assessment), and Step 3 (treatment preparation). In the current state, the long-run sustainable capacities (patients completed per hour) are $[30, 20, 25]$ for Steps $1$, $2$, and $3$, respectively.

The concepts of capacity, throughput, arrival rate, and bottleneck are well-defined within this field.\n-   **Well-Posed**: All necessary data (capacities, arrival rate) and conditions (sequential process, steady state) are provided to calculate a unique solution for each part of the problem.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n-   **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. The arrival rate $\\lambda = 60$ is higher than any of the process capacities. This does not represent a contradiction, but rather a standard scenario of an overloaded system. In such cases, the work-in-progress queue before the system grows, but the system's output rate (throughput) remains stable and is dictated by its internal capacity, not the arrival rate. The problem's phrasing \"sustained throughput is constrained by the system’s bottleneck\" and \"sufficient Work in Progress\" correctly directs the analysis toward the system's capacity as the limiting factor.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis of the system's throughput proceeds from foundational principles of process flow.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the capacity of step $i$, defined as the maximum rate at which step $i$ can process units (patients per hour). Let $\\lambda$ be the rate at which units arrive at the system. Let $\\theta$ be the steady-state throughput of the system, defined as the long-run average rate at which the system completes and outputs finished units.\n\nFor a system of sequential steps in steady state, the principle of flow conservation dictates that the throughput must be the same through each step. The throughput $\\theta$ is subject to two fundamental constraints:\n$1$. The throughput of any given step cannot exceed its capacity. This implies that the overall system throughput cannot exceed the capacity of any of its constituent steps: $\\theta \\le C_i$ for all $i$. Consequently, the system throughput is limited by the minimum capacity in the sequence: $\\theta \\le \\min(C_1, C_2, C_3)$. This minimum capacity is defined as the system's bottleneck capacity, $C_{sys} = \\min(C_1, C_2, C_3)$.\n$2$. The throughput cannot exceed the rate of arrivals. If it did, the system would be creating outputs from inputs that do not exist, which is a physical impossibility. Thus, $\\theta \\le \\lambda$.\n\nCombining these two constraints, the realized steady-state throughput of the system is the maximum rate possible that satisfies both conditions:\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(\\lambda, C_{sys}) = \\min(\\lambda, C_1, C_2, C_3)\n$$\nThe problem states that there is \"sufficient Work in Progress (WIP) buffering,\" implying the system is never starved for work. This condition is met when the arrival rate is greater than or equal to the system's capacity ($\\lambda \\ge C_{sys}$). In this scenario, the system's throughput is determined solely by its bottleneck capacity: $\\theta = C_{sys}$.\n\n1) **Baseline System Throughput ($\\theta$) and Bottleneck Identification**\n\nThe capacities for the baseline system are given as $C_1 = 30$, $C_2 = 20$, and $C_3 = 25$ patients per hour. The arrival rate is $\\lambda = 60$ patients per hour.\n\nThe system's capacity is the minimum of the individual step capacities:\n$$\nC_{sys} = \\min(C_1, C_2, C_3) = \\min(30, 20, 25) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe steady-state throughput $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(\\lambda, C_{sys}) = \\min(60, 20) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe bottleneck is the step with the lowest capacity, which limits the entire system.\n-   Capacity of Step $1$: $C_1 = 30$\n-   Capacity of Step $2$: $C_2 = 20$\n-   Capacity of Step $3$: $C_3 = 25$\nThe minimum capacity is $20$ patients per hour, which corresponds to Step $2$.\n\nThus, for the baseline system:\n-   The steady-state throughput $\\theta$ is $20$ patients per hour.\n-   The bottleneck is Step $2$.\n\n2) **Improvement A: New Throughput $\\theta_A$**\n\nIn this scenario, the capacity of Step $1$ is increased from $30$ to $40$. The new set of capacities is $C'_{1} = 40$, $C_2 = 20$, and $C_3 = 25$.\n\nThe new system capacity, $C_{sys,A}$, is:\n$$\nC_{sys,A} = \\min(C'_{1}, C_2, C_3) = \\min(40, 20, 25) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe bottleneck remains Step $2$. The new throughput, $\\theta_A$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\min(\\lambda, C_{sys,A}) = \\min(60, 20) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nImproving a non-bottleneck step has no effect on the overall system throughput.\n\n3) **Improvement B: New Throughput $\\theta_B$**\n\nIn this scenario, the capacity of the original bottleneck (Step $2$) is increased from $20$ to $25$. The other steps are unchanged from the baseline. The new set of capacities is $C_1 = 30$, $C''_{2} = 25$, and $C_3 = 25$.\n\nThe new system capacity, $C_{sys,B}$, is:\n$$\nC_{sys,B} = \\min(C_1, C''_{2}, C_3) = \\min(30, 25, 25) = 25 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe bottleneck has now shifted. Both Step $2$ and Step $3$ have the minimum capacity and are co-bottlenecks. The new throughput, $\\theta_B$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\min(\\lambda, C_{sys,B}) = \\min(60, 25) = 25 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nImproving the bottleneck step has successfully increased the overall system throughput.\n\n4) **Ratio $\\rho$**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the ratio $\\rho = \\frac{\\theta_{B}}{\\theta_{A}}$.\nUsing the calculated throughputs:\n$$\n\\theta_A = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_B = 25 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. This gives $1.250$.",

A substantial proportion of outcomes will fall outside the acceptable limit. To improve capability, the hospital would need to either reduce the process mean (i.e., see patients faster on average) or decrease the process variation (i.e., make the door-to-provider time more consistent).\n\nThe final numerical value of $C_{pk}$ as a simplified fraction is $\\frac{8}{15}$.",
