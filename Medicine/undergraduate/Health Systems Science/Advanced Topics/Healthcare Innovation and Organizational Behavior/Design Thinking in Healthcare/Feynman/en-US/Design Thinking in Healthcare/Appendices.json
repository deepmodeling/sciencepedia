Before these insights can reliably guide the design process, we must ensure that the themes identified from them are consistent and not just the result of one researcher's subjective interpretation.

Two independent coders reviewed field notes and assigned each note to exactly one of three mutually exclusive thematic categories: access barrier ($\\mathcal{A}$), communication breakdown ($\\mathcal{C}$), or workflow friction ($\\mathcal{W}$). To ensure that the themes reflect a shared understanding rather than idiosyncratic coding, the team pre-specified a go/no-go criterion that the chance-corrected interrater reliability, quantified by Cohen’s kappa, must be at least $0.65$ to proceed to ideation.\n\nYou are given the $3 \\times 3$ contingency counts of coder decisions, where rows are coder $1$ labels and columns are coder $2$ labels.

The scenario described is a typical application of qualitative data analysis and reliability assessment in health systems science, a field related to STEM.

This requires the marginal totals for each category for each coder.\nLet $R_i$ be the total number of items coder $1$ assigned to category $i$ (row totals), and $C_j$ be the total number of items coder $2$ assigned to category $j$ (column totals).\n\nRow totals (Coder $1$):\n- $R_{\\mathcal{A}} = m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{A}} + m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C}} + m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{W}} = 35 + 5 + 2 = 42$\n- $R_{\\mathcal{C}} = m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{A}} + m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{C}} + m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{W}} = 4 + 28 + 3 = 35$\n- $R_{\\mathcal{W}} = m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{A}} + m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{C}} + m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{W}} = 1 + 6 + 16 = 23$\n\nColumn totals (Coder $2$):\n- $C_{\\mathcal{A}} = m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{A}} + m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{A}} + m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{A}} = 35 + 4 + 1 = 40$\n- $C_{\\mathcal{C}} = m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C}} + m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{C}} + m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{C}} = 5 + 28 + 6 = 39$\n- $C_{\\mathcal{W}} = m_{\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{W}} + m_{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{W}} + m_{\\mathcal{W},\\mathcal{W}} = 2 + 3 + 16 = 21$\n\nThe expected proportion of agreements for each category is the product of the marginal probabilities for that category.

No other concept has an $F$ score greater than or equal to $0.95$. Therefore, $C_1$ is **non-dominated**.\n\n- **$C_2(0.45, 0.85)$**: To be dominated, there must be a $C_j$ with $D_j \\ge 0.45$ and $F_j \\ge 0.85$ (and not equal). No concept satisfies both conditions simultaneously. For example, $C_9(0.83, 0.83)$ has $D_9 > D_2$ but $F_9 < F_2$. $C_1(0.20, 0.95)$ has $F_1 > F_2$ but $D_1 < D_2$. Therefore, $C_2$ is **non-dominated**.\n\n- **$C_3(0.60, 0.60)$**: Let's check for dominators. Consider $C_7(0.70, 0.80)$. We have $D_7 = 0.70 > 0.60 = D_3$ and $F_7 = 0.80 > 0.60 = F_3$. Thus, $C_7$ dominates $C_3$. Therefore, $C_3$ is **dominated**.\n\n- **$C_4(0.75, 0.55)$**: Consider $C_9(0.83, 0.83)$. We have $D_9 = 0.83 > 0.75 = D_4$ and $F_9 = 0.83 > 0.55 = F_4$. Thus, $C_9$ dominates $C_4$. Therefore, $C_4$ is **dominated**.\n\n- **$C_5(0.88, 0.50)$**: To be dominated, a concept $C_j$ must have $D_j \\ge 0.88$ and $F_j \\ge 0.50$. The only concept with $D_j \\ge 0.88$ is $C_6(0.92, 0.30)$, but $F_6 < F_5$. All other concepts have $D_j < 0.88$. Thus, no concept dominates $C_5$. Therefore, $C_5$ is **non-dominated**.\n\n- **$C_6(0.92, 0.30)$**: This concept has the highest $D$ score in the set ($D_6 = 0.92$). Any potential dominator $C_j$ would need to have $D_j \\ge 0.92$. Since no other concept satisfies this, $C_6$ cannot be dominated. Therefore, $C_6$ is **non-dominated**.\n\n- **$C_7(0.70, 0.80)$**: Consider $C_9(0.83, 0.83)$. We have $D_9 = 0.83 > 0.70 = D_7$ and $F_9 = 0.83 > 0.80 = F_7$. Thus, $C_9$ dominates $C_7$. Therefore, $C_7$ is **dominated**.\n\n- **$C_8(0.30, 0.40)$**: Consider $C_2(0.45, 0.85)$. We have $D_2 = 0.45 > 0.30 = D_8$ and $F_2 = 0.85 > 0.40 = F_8$. Thus, $C_2$ dominates $C_8$. (Note: $C_8$ is also dominated by $C_3, C_4, C_5, C_7, C_9$). Therefore, $C_8$ is **dominated**.\n\n- **$C_9(0.83, 0.83)$**: To be dominated, a concept $C_j$ must have $D_j \\ge 0.83$ and $F_j \\ge 0.83$. The concepts with $D_j \\ge 0.83$ are $C_5(0.88, 0.50)$ and $C_6(0.92, 0.30)$, but for both, their $F$ score is less than $0.83$. The concepts with $F_j \\ge 0.83$ are $C_1(0.20, 0.95)$ and $C_2(0.45, 0.85)$, but for both, their $D$ score is less than $0.83$. No concept satisfies both conditions. Therefore, $C_9$ is **non-dominated**.\n\nSummary of the analysis:\n- $C_1$: Non-dominated\n- $C_2$: Non-dominated\n- $C_3$: Dominated (by $C_7$ and $C_9$)\n- $C_4$: Dominated (by $C_9$)\n- $C_5$: Non-dominated\n- $C_6$: Non-dominated\n- $C_7$: Dominated (by $C_9$)\n- $C_8$: Dominated (by $C_2$, etc.)\n- $C_9$: Non-dominated\n\nThe set of non-dominated concepts that form the Pareto frontier is $\\{C_1, C_2, C_5, C_6, C_9\\}$.

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the application of a fundamental relationship from queueing theory, known as Little's Law. The problem specifies focusing on the waiting queue, for which the law states:\n$$L_q = \\lambda W_q$$\nwhere $L_q$ is the average number of entities in the queue (length of the queue), $\\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of entities into the queue, and $W_q$ is the average time an entity spends waiting in the queue.\n\nWe will apply this relationship to the system both before and after the intervention.\n\n**1. Before the Intervention (State 0)**\n\nThe given parameters for the initial state are:\n- Average arrival rate: $\\lambda_{0} = 24$ patients/hour.\n- Average number of patients in the queue: $L_{q,0} = 12$ patients.\n\nThe average waiting time before the intervention, $W_{q,0}$, can be calculated by rearranging Little's Law:\n$$W_{q,0} = \\frac{L_{q,0}}{\\lambda_{0}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$W_{q,0} = \\frac{12}{24} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nTo express this in minutes, we multiply by $60$:\n$$W_{q,0} = 0.5 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n**2. After the Intervention (State 1)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the new arrival rate to the physician queue, $\\lambda_1$. The problem states that a fraction $0.30$ of patients are diverted, so the new rate is:\n$$\\lambda_{1} = (1 - 0.30) \\lambda_{0} = 0.70 \\times 24 \\text{ patients/hour}$$\n$$\\lambda_{1} = 16.8 \\text{ patients/hour}$$\n\nThe other given parameter for the final state is:\n- Average number of patients in the queue: $L_{q,1} = 7$ patients.\n\nThe average waiting time after the intervention, $W_{q,1}$, is calculated using Little's Law again:\n$$W_{q,1} = \\frac{L_{q,1}}{\\lambda_{1}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the final state:\n$$W_{q,1} = \\frac{7}{16.8} \\text{ hours}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write $16.8$ as $\\frac{168}{10}$:\n$$W_{q,1} = \\frac{7}{\\frac{168}{10}} = \\frac{70}{168} \\text{ hours}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by $14$ ($70 = 5 \\times 14$ and $168 = 12 \\times 14$):\n$$W_{q,1} = \\frac{5}{12} \\text{ hours}$$\n\nTo express this in minutes:\n$$W_{q,1} = \\frac{5}{12} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 5 \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} = 25 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n**3. Change in Average Waiting Time**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the average waiting time, which is the new time minus the old time, $\\Delta W_q = W_{q,1} - W_{q,0}$.\n\nUsing the values in minutes:\n$$\\Delta W_q = 25 \\text{ minutes} - 30 \\text{ minutes} = -5 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nAlternatively, using the values in hours:\n$$\\Delta W_q = W_{q,1} - W_{q,0} = \\frac{5}{12} \\text{ hours} - 0.5 \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{12} - \\frac{6}{12} \\text{ hours} = -\\frac{1}{12} \\text{ hours}$$\nConverting this change to minutes:\n$$\\Delta W_q = -\\frac{1}{12} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = -5 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe result indicates a decrease of $5$ minutes in the average waiting time.\n\n**4. Final Answer Formatting**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact answer is $-5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $-5.000$.",
