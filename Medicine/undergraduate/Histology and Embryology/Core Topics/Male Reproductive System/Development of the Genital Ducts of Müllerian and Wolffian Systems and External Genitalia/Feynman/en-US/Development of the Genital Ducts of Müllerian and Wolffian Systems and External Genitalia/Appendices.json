            "problem": "In human embryogenesis, maintenance of the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts depends on androgen signaling primarily driven by testosterone, while virilization of the external genitalia depends on androgen signaling primarily driven by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The androgen receptor (AR) binds androgens reversibly, and downstream transcriptional activation of target genes requires AR-ligand complex formation and AR dimerization. Consider two simplified microenvironments, each dominated by a single androgen: a Wolffian duct microenvironment with testosterone only, and a genital tubercle microenvironment with DHT only.\n\nAssume rapid binding equilibrium, ligand excess over receptor, and classical mass-action behavior. The dissociation constant is defined by $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, where $[R]$ is the concentration of unbound receptor, $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of receptor-ligand complex. Let total receptor be $R_{t} = [R] + [RL]$, and define the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ as $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}}$.

Testosterone concentration, $C_{T} = 2.0$ nM.\n- **System 2 (Genital tubercle):** Ligand is dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dihydrotestosterone concentration, $C_{D} = 0.5$ nM.\n- **Biochemical Model:**\n  - Dissociation constant definition: $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, where $[R]$ is unbound receptor, $[L]$ is free ligand, and $[RL]$ is receptor-ligand complex concentration.\n  - Total receptor concentration: $R_{t} = [R] + [RL]$.\n  - Fractional occupancy: $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}}$.\n  - Transcriptional response: $G \\propto \\theta^{n}$.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - Androgen receptor dissociation constant for testosterone: $K_{d,T} = 1.0$ nM.\n  - Androgen receptor dissociation constant for dihydrotestosterone: $K_{d,D} = 0.2$ nM.\n  - Hill coefficient: $n = 2$.\n- **Assumptions:** Rapid binding equilibrium, ligand excess over receptor, classical mass-action behavior.\n- **Objective:**\n  1.

Round the final ratio to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on standard principles of receptor-ligand binding kinetics (using the law of mass action to define a dissociation constant) and dose-response modeling (using a Hill equation). These are fundamental and widely used concepts in pharmacology, biochemistry, and systems biology. The biological context—the differential roles and potencies of testosterone and DHT in male sexual differentiation—is factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions, equations, and numerical values to arrive at a unique solution. The steps required to solve the problem are clearly articulated.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). The assumptions, such as ligand excess, are standard simplifications in this type of modeling problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, in terms of the ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$.\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions:\n1. $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n2. $R_{t} = [R] + [RL]$\n3. $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}}$\n\nFrom the definition of $K_{d}$, we can express the concentration of unbound receptor, $[R]$, as:\n$$[R] = K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration, $R_{t}$:\n$$R_{t} = \\left(K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]$$\nWe can factor out the term $[RL]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$R_{t} = [RL] \\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1\\right)$$\nTo find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ simplifies the expression:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis is the general expression for fractional occupancy, also known as the Langmuir isotherm.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the two specified microenvironments.\n\nFor the testosterone-dominated Wolffian duct microenvironment, the ligand is testosterone (T). The ligand concentration is $[L] = C_{T} = 2.0$ nM, and the dissociation constant is $K_{d,T} = 1.0$ nM. The fractional occupancy of the androgen receptor, $\\theta_{T}$, is:\n$$\\theta_{T} = \\frac{C_{T}}{K_{d,T} + C_{T}} = \\frac{2.0 \\text{ nM}}{1.0 \\text{ nM} + 2.0 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{2.0}{3.0} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nFor the DHT-dominated genital tubercle microenvironment, the ligand is dihydrotestosterone (D). The ligand concentration is $[L] = C_{D} = 0.5$ nM, and the dissociation constant is $K_{d,D} = 0.2$ nM. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{D}$, is:\n$$\\theta_{D} = \\frac{C_{D}}{K_{d,D} + C_{D}} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ nM}}{0.2 \\text{ nM} + 0.5 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.7} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\n\nThe problem states that the transcriptional gene expression level, $G$, is proportional to $\\theta^{n}$, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient. We can write this as $G = k \\theta^{n}$ for some constant of proportionality $k$, which is assumed to be the same for both systems as it relates to downstream cellular machinery.\n\nWe need to compute the ratio of the transcriptional output in the DHT environment, $G_{D}$, to that in the testosterone environment, $G_{T}$.\n$$G_{D} = k \\theta_{D}^{n}$$\n$$G_{T} = k \\theta_{T}^{n}$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{G_{D}}{G_{T}} = \\frac{k \\theta_{D}^{n}}{k \\theta_{T}^{n}} = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_{D}}{\\theta_{T}}\\right)^{n}$$\nWe are given that the Hill coefficient is $n = 2$. Substituting the calculated values for $\\theta_{D}$, $\\theta_{T}$, and $n$:\n$$\\frac{G_{D}}{G_{T}} = \\left(\\frac{5/7}{2/3}\\right)^{2}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the ratio of the occupancies:\n$$\\frac{\\theta_{D}}{\\theta_{T}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{15}{14}$$\nNow, we square this ratio:\n$$\\frac{G_{D}}{G_{T}} = \\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{15^{2}}{14^{2}} = \\frac{225}{196}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{225}{196} \\approx 1.14795918...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.148$. This result indicates that despite the lower concentration of DHT ($0.5$ nM vs $2.0$ nM for T), its higher affinity for the androgen receptor (five times higher, as $K_{d,D}$ is one-fifth of $K_{d,T}$) combined with the cooperative nature of the transcriptional response ($n=2$) results in a slightly greater predicted gene expression level in the genital tubercle compared to the Wolffian duct.",

Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the developmental outcome of internal and external genitalia for a $46,XY$ embryo under three different scenarios of temporal mismatch ($\\Delta t$) between AMH and androgen action.\n\nThe key parameters of the model are:\n-   AMH pulse interval: $I_{\\mathrm{AMH}} = [8, 12]$ weeks.\n-   Androgen pulse interval: $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [t_{\\mathrm{A}} - 2, t_{\\mathrm{A}} + 2]$ weeks.\n-   The center of the androgen pulse is $t_{\\mathrm{A}} = t_{\\mathrm{AMH}} + \\Delta t = 10 + \\Delta t$.\n-   Critical window for Wolffian ducts: $W_{\\mathrm{W}} = [8, 12]$ weeks.\n-   Critical window for external genitalia: $W_{\\mathrm{E}} = [8, 14]$ weeks.\n\nThe criteria for development are:\n1.  **Müllerian Ducts:** The AMH pulse $I_{\\mathrm{AMH}} = [8, 12]$ has a $4$-week overlap with its critical window $[8, 12]$. The problem statement correctly simplifies this by stating that regression is expected. Thus, in all three cases, the **Müllerian ducts will be regressed**. Any option suggesting \"Persistent Müllerian ducts\" is incorrect.\n2.  **Wolffian Ducts:** Derivatives are present if the length of the intersection of the androgen pulse and its critical window is at least $1$ week. We must calculate the length of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cap W_{\\mathrm{W}}$.\n3.  **External Genitalia:** Virilization (male-typical) occurs if the length of the intersection of the androgen pulse and its critical window is at least $2$ weeks. We must calculate the length of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cap W_{\\mathrm{E}}$. If this condition is not met, the default development is female-typical.\n\nLet's analyze each case for $\\Delta t$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\Delta t = -3$ weeks**\n-   The center of the androgen pulse is $t_{\\mathrm{A}} = 10 + (-3) = 7$ weeks.\n-   The androgen pulse interval is $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [7 - 2, 7 + 2] = [5, 9]$ weeks.\n-   **Müllerian Ducts:** Regressed.\n-   **Wolffian Ducts:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [5, 9]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{W}} = [8, 12]$. The intersection is $[8, 9]$. The length of this interval is $9 - 8 = 1$ week. The criterion is an overlap of at least $1$ week. Since $1 \\geq 1$, the condition is met. **Wolffian derivatives will be present.**\n-   **External Genitalia:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [5, 9]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{E}} = [8, 14]$. The intersection is $[8, 9]$. The length of this interval is $1$ week. The criterion is an overlap of at least $2$ weeks. Since $1 < 2$, the condition is not met. **External genitalia will be female-typical.**\n-   **Conclusion for $\\Delta t = -3$:** Wolffian derivatives present, Müllerian ducts regressed, external genitalia female-typical.\n\n**Case 2: $\\Delta t = +1$ week**\n-   The center of the androgen pulse is $t_{\\mathrm{A}} = 10 + 1 = 11$ weeks.\n-   The androgen pulse interval is $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [11 - 2, 11 + 2] = [9, 13]$ weeks.\n-   **Müllerian Ducts:** Regressed.\n-   **Wolffian Ducts:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [9, 13]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{W}} = [8, 12]$. The intersection is $[9, 12]$. The length of this interval is $12 - 9 = 3$ weeks. Since $3 \\geq 1$, the condition is met. **Wolffian derivatives will be present.**\n-   **External Genitalia:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [9, 13]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{E}} = [8, 14]$. The intersection is $[9, 13]$. The length of this interval is $13 - 9 = 4$ weeks. Since $4 \\geq 2$, the condition is met. **External genitalia will be male-typical (virilized).**\n-   **Conclusion for $\\Delta t = +1$:** Wolffian derivatives present, Müllerian ducts regressed, external genitalia male-typical. This represents typical male development.\n\n**Case 3: $\\Delta t = +4$ weeks**\n-   The center of the androgen pulse is $t_{\\mathrm{A}} = 10 + 4 = 14$ weeks.\n-   The androgen pulse interval is $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [14 - 2, 14 + 2] = [12, 16]$ weeks.\n-   **Müllerian Ducts:** Regressed.\n-   **Wolffian Ducts:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [12, 16]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{W}} = [8, 12]$. The intersection is the single point $\\{12\\}$, which is an interval of length $0$. Since $0 < 1$, the condition is not met. **Wolffian derivatives will be absent.**\n-   **External Genitalia:** We evaluate the overlap of $I_{\\mathrm{A}} = [12, 16]$ with $W_{\\mathrm{E}} = [8, 14]$. The intersection is $[12, 14]$. The length of this interval is $14 - 12 = 2$ weeks. The criterion is an overlap of at least $2$ weeks. Since $2 \\geq 2$, the condition is met. **External genitalia will be male-typical (virilized).**\n-   **Conclusion for $\\Delta t = +4$:** Wolffian derivatives absent, Müllerian ducts regressed, external genitalia male-typical.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta t = -3$: Wolffian derivatives present; Müllerian ducts regressed; external genitalia female-typical due to insufficient androgenic overlap. $\\Delta t = +1$: Typical male internal and external genitalia. $\\Delta t = +4$: Wolffian derivatives absent; Müllerian ducts regressed; external genitalia male-typical.**\n-   The prediction for $\\Delta t = -3$ matches our derivation.\n-   The prediction for $\\Delta t = +1$ matches our derivation (\"Typical male\" is consistent with present Wolffian ducts, regressed Müllerian ducts, and male-typical external genitalia).\n-   The prediction for $\\Delta t = +4$ matches our derivation.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\Delta t = -3$: Wolffian derivatives absent; Müllerian ducts regressed; external genitalia female-typical. $\\Delta t = +1$: Persistent Müllerian ducts with otherwise male-typical features. $\\Delta t = +4$: Typical male internal and external genitalia.**\n-   The prediction for $\\Delta t = -3$ is incorrect.

The model's binary threshold for virilization (overlap $\\ge 2$ weeks) does not support a state of \"ambiguous.\" An overlap of $1$ week is insufficient, resulting in a female-typical outcome.\n-   The prediction for $\\Delta t = +1$ is incorrect. The overlap for external genitalia is $4$ weeks, which is well above the $2$-week threshold, leading to full virilization, not under-virilization.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the model's rules, only option A correctly describes the outcomes for all three scenarios.",

The problem is firmly rooted in established medical science.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The question asks for the most parsimonious explanation for a set of signs and symptoms, which is a standard task in differential diagnosis. The provided facts create a logical framework within which a unique and meaningful answer can be deduced.\n-   **Objective**: The clinical findings are described using precise, objective medical terminology. The foundational facts provide an unbiased basis for reasoning.\n\nThe problem statement is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, and ambiguities. It presents a complete set of information necessary to deduce a specific developmental anomaly.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided facts.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe objective is to identify a single perturbation that explains the coexistence of female internal ductal structures (uterus, fallopian tubes) with fully developed male internal ductal structures (epididymides, vasa deferentia) and external genitalia (penis, scrotum) in a $46,XY$ individual.\n\n1.  **Karyotype and Gonadal Development**: The $46,XY$ karyotype implies the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. According to the provided facts, this initiates testis differentiation at $t \\approx 6$ weeks. The presence of palpable gonads (testes) is consistent with this first step. These testes contain both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells.\n\n2.  **Müllerian Duct Development**: The paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper part of the vagina. In a typical male fetus, Sertoli cells secrete Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) between $t \\approx 8$ and $10$ weeks, which induces the regression of these ducts. The finding of a uterus and fallopian tube-like structures in this infant signifies that this regression did not occur. This points to a failure in the AMH signaling pathway during this critical developmental window. The cause could be absent or defective AMH secretion by Sertoli cells, or a defect in the AMH receptor on the Müllerian ducts themselves.\n\n3.  **Wolffian Duct Development**: The mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts develop into the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles under the influence of testosterone. According to the facts, Leydig cells secrete testosterone between $t \\approx 8$ and $12$ weeks, and this hormone acts via the Androgen Receptor (AR) to stimulate Wolffian duct differentiation. The presence of normal epididymides and vasa deferentia in this infant confirms that testosterone production by Leydig cells and Androgen Receptor function were both adequate during this period.\n\n4.  **External Genitalia and Prostate Development**: The external genitalia (penis, scrotum) and prostate are masculinized by Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) between $t \\approx 9$ and $12$ weeks. DHT is synthesized from testosterone by the enzyme $5\\alpha$-reductase and also acts via the Androgen Receptor. The presence of a normally formed penis, fused scrotum, and a prostate indicates that there was sufficient testosterone production, functional $5\\alpha$-reductase activity, and functional Androgen Receptor signaling during this critical window.\n\n5.  **Synthesis**:\n    -   The masculinization of Wolffian ducts and external genitalia was successful. This requires intact Leydig cell function (testosterone production), $5\\alpha$-reductase activity, and Androgen Receptor function.\n    -   The regression of Müllerian ducts failed. This requires a defect in the AMH pathway.\n    -   The most parsimonious explanation is a single-system defect. The androgen system appears completely functional. Therefore, the defect must be isolated to the AMH system. The perturbation must be an absence of AMH signaling during the $t \\in [8,10]$ week period. The normal testosterone level postnatally further supports the conclusion of intact Leydig cell function.\n\nThis clinical picture is characteristic of Persistent Müllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Transient absence of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) signaling restricted to $t \\in [8,10]$ weeks, with intact Leydig function and Androgen Receptor (AR) activity throughout**\n-   **Analysis**: This hypothesis perfectly aligns with the derived conclusion. A failure of AMH signaling during the specified timeframe would cause the persistence of the Müllerian ducts (uterus, tubes). Intact Leydig function and AR activity would ensure the normal development of Wolffian ducts (epididymides, vasa deferentia) and the complete masculinization of the external genitalia and prostate via testosterone and DHT. This single defect accounts for all the observed findings.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Complete Androgen Receptor (AR) deficiency throughout development**\n-   **Analysis**: This describes Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS). In a $46,XY$ individual, testes would produce AMH, causing Müllerian duct regression. No uterus or tubes would be present, which contradicts the findings. Furthermore, the lack of response to testosterone and DHT would cause the Wolffian ducts to regress and the external genitalia to develop as female. This contradicts the findings of intact vasa deferentia and a normal penis/scrotum.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $5\\alpha$-reductase deficiency restricting Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production during $t \\in [9,12]$ weeks**\n-   **Analysis**: In this condition, AMH action would be normal, leading to Müllerian duct regression. No uterus or tubes would be present, contradicting the findings. While testosterone-dependent Wolffian ducts would develop normally, the lack of DHT would result in severely undermasculinized external genitalia (e.g., micropenis, hypospadias, bifid scrotum) and an underdeveloped prostate. This contradicts the finding of normally formed male external genitalia and a visualized prostate.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Transient Leydig cell failure causing low testosterone during $t \\in [8,12]$ weeks, with intact AMH secretion**\n-   **Analysis**: Intact AMH secretion would cause Müllerian duct regression, so no uterus or tubes would be present, which contradicts the findings. Low testosterone during the critical window would lead to regression or hypoplasia of the Wolffian ducts and failure of external genitalia masculinization. This contradicts the findings of intact vasa deferentia and a normal penis/scrotum.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
