This positional information is often established by opposing gradients of signaling molecules called morphogens. This exercise models how the boundary between two distinct cellular domains can be determined by the point where concentrations of opposing signals, such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and WNT, are equal, providing a quantitative basis for understanding tissue patterning .",

            "problem": "During dorsal-ventral patterning that influences the early morphogenesis of the optic cup and otic vesicle, the developing neural tube establishes opposing morphogen gradients from the ventral floor plate and dorsal roof plate. Consider two morphogens: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Wingless/Integrated (WNT). In a one-dimensional approximation along the dorsal-ventral axis, let the coordinate $y$ measure distance from the ventral floor plate ($y=0$) to the dorsal roof plate ($y=h$). Under steady-state diffusion with first-order degradation, widely used models predict exponential concentration profiles with characteristic length constants. Assume SHH concentration satisfies $c_s(y)=c_0 \\exp(-y/\\lambda_s)$ and WNT concentration satisfies $c_w(y)=w_0 \\exp(-(h-y)/\\lambda_w)$, where $c_0$ and $w_0$ are ventral and dorsal source concentrations, respectively, and $\\lambda_s$ and $\\lambda_w$ are the corresponding decay length constants.\n\nDefine the boundary position $y^{*}$ as the location where the two signals are equal in concentration, that is, where $c_s(y^{*})=c_w(y^{*})$. Using first-principles reasoning rooted in steady-state diffusion-degradation in one dimension and the given functional forms, derive an expression for $y^{*}$ and then compute its numerical value for $c_0=w_0$, $\\lambda_s=100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda_w=150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $h=600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Express your final $y^{*}$ in micrometers and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the spatial coordinate $y^*$ at which the concentrations of two morphogens, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Wingless/Integrated (WNT), are equal. Subsequently, this expression is to be evaluated numerically using the provided parameters.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional representation of the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing neural tube, extending from the ventral floor plate at $y=0$ to the dorsal roof plate at $y=h$.\n\nThe concentration profile of SHH, originating from the ventral source, is given by:\n$$c_s(y) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\lambda_s}\\right)$$\nHere, $c_0$ is the source concentration at $y=0$, and $\\lambda_s$ is the characteristic decay length for SHH.\n\nThe concentration profile of WNT, originating from the dorsal source, is given by:\n$$c_w(y) = w_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h-y}{\\lambda_w}\\right)$$\nHere, $w_0$ is the source concentration at $y=h$, and $\\lambda_w$ is the characteristic decay length for WNT.\n\nThe boundary position $y^*$ is defined by the condition where the two concentrations are equal:\n$$c_s(y^*) = c_w(y^*)$$\n\nSubstituting the given functional forms into this equality yields:\n$$c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^*}{\\lambda_s}\\right) = w_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h-y^*}{\\lambda_w}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem provides the specific condition that the source concentrations are equal, i.e., $c_0 = w_0$. Applying this simplification, the equation becomes:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^*}{\\lambda_s}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h-y^*}{\\lambda_w}\\right)$$\n\nTo solve for $y^*$, we take the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, of both sides of the equation. Since the natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function, this simplifies the expression:\n$$\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^*}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{h-y^*}{\\lambda_w}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$-\\frac{y^*}{\\lambda_s} = -\\frac{h-y^*}{\\lambda_w}$$\n\nWe can multiply both sides by $-1$ to remove the negative signs:\n$$\\frac{y^*}{\\lambda_s} = \\frac{h-y^*}{\\lambda_w}$$\n\nNow, we perform algebraic manipulation to isolate $y^*$. We cross-multiply to clear the denominators:\n$$y^* \\lambda_w = (h-y^*) \\lambda_s$$\n$$y^* \\lambda_w = h \\lambda_s - y^* \\lambda_s$$\n\nNext, we gather all terms containing $y^*$ on one side of the equation:\n$$y^* \\lambda_w + y^* \\lambda_s = h \\lambda_s$$\n\nFactor out $y^*$:\n$$y^* (\\lambda_s + \\lambda_w) = h \\lambda_s$$\n\nFinally, we divide by $(\\lambda_s + \\lambda_w)$ to obtain the general expression for $y^*$ under the condition $c_0=w_0$:\n$$y^* = \\frac{h \\lambda_s}{\\lambda_s + \\lambda_w}$$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $h = 600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda_s = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\lambda_w = 150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. All units are in micrometers, so the resulting value for $y^*$ will also be in micrometers.\n$$y^* = \\frac{(600) (100)}{100 + 150}$$\n$$y^* = \\frac{60000}{250}$$\n$$y^* = \\frac{6000}{25}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$y^* = 240$$\nThe resulting value is $240\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures. The exact value is $240$. To express this unambiguously with three significant figures, we can write it in scientific notation as $2.40 \\times 10^2$.",

            "introduction": "The response of a cell to developmental signals is ultimately controlled by transcription factors regulating gene expression. This exercise delves into the molecular mechanism of dosage sensitivity using PAX6, a master regulator of eye development, as a model . By applying the Hill equation for cooperative binding, you can quantitatively understand why a reduction of this key protein to half its normal amount—a situation analogous to some genetic disorders—can cause a disproportionately large drop in downstream gene activation, leading to severe developmental defects.",

            "problem": "In the embryonic optic field, Paired Box Gene 6 (PAX6) is a dosage-sensitive transcription factor (TF) required for proper eye morphogenesis and early lens induction. Consider a single downstream target gene whose promoter contains cooperative PAX6 binding sites such that activation is governed by a standard Hill-type binding mechanism with Hill coefficient $n=2$. Assume the following foundational principles: (i) under equilibrium binding, the fractional occupancy of a cooperative site increases monotonically with TF concentration and saturates as the concentration becomes large, (ii) downstream target activation is proportional to fractional occupancy of the PAX6 binding sites, and (iii) the effective dissociation constant $K_d$ equals the baseline wild-type PAX6 concentration.\n\nNow suppose the PAX6 dosage is reduced to $0.5$ times the baseline concentration during a critical developmental window. Using the principles of cooperative binding and equilibrium occupancy, derive the fold-change in downstream target activation relative to baseline, defined as the ratio of the activation after reduction to the activation at baseline. Express your final result as a decimal or a fraction, with no units, and do not round unless necessary.",
            "solution": "The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a promoter with cooperative binding sites by a transcription factor is described by the Hill equation:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[TF]^n}{K_d^n + [TF]^n}\n$$\nwhere $[TF]$ is the concentration of the transcription factor, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, and $K_d$ is the effective dissociation constant (the concentration of TF that yields half-maximal occupancy).\n\nIn this specific problem, the transcription factor is PAX6, which we denote by $[P]$. The Hill coefficient is given as $n=2$. Thus, the fractional occupancy of the target gene's promoter is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[P]^2}{K_d^2 + [P]^2}\n$$\nAccording to Principle (ii), the activation of the downstream target gene, which we denote as $A$, is proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nA = c \\cdot \\theta = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]^2}{K_d^2 + [P]^2}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors such as the maximum transcription rate.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline (wild-type) activation, $A_{\\text{base}}$. Let the baseline concentration of PAX6 be $[P]_{\\text{base}}$. At this concentration, the activation is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{base}} = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]_{\\text{base}}^2}{K_d^2 + [P]_{\\text{base}}^2}\n$$\nThe problem states (Principle (iii)) that the effective dissociation constant $K_d$ is equal to the baseline concentration, i.e., $K_d = [P]_{\\text{base}}$.
