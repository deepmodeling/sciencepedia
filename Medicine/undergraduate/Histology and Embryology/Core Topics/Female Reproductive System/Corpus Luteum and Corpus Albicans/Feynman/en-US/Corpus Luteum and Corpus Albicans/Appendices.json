            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   **Genetic Model**: A female mouse line with a targeted deletion of the Luteinizing Hormone/Chorionic Gonadotropin Receptor ($LHCGR$), rendering the receptor nonfunctional in ovarian cells.\n*   **Experimental Intervention**: Administration of an exogenous Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ($hCG$) bolus designed to mimic the preovulatory Luteinizing Hormone ($LH$) surge.\n*   **Question**: Predict the ovarian phenotype, histological findings, and endocrine profile after the $hCG$ intervention.\n*   **Fundamental Principles for Reasoning**:\n    1.  The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) regulates pituitary secretion of $LH$ and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone ($FSH$). Ovarian steroid hormones Progesterone ($P_4$) and Estradiol ($E_2$) exert negative feedback on the axis.\n    2.  $LH$/$hCG$ function: Acts via $LHCGR$ on theca cells to stimulate androgen synthesis and on preovulatory granulosa cells to trigger ovulation, luteinization, and subsequent $P_4$ production from luteal cells.\n    3.  $FSH$ function: Acts via its receptor on granulosa cells to stimulate aromatase and follicular maturation.\n    4.  Corpus Luteum (CL) formation: Requires $LH$-receptor mediated luteinization of granulosa and theca cells.\n    5.  Corpus Albicans (CA) formation: Forms as the fibrous scar of a regressed corpus luteum.\n*   **Assumptions**:\n    1.  The knockout does not affect the $FSH$ receptor or $FSH$ secretion.\n    2.  The $hCG$ dose is pharmacologically adequate to fully engage any available $LHCGR$, if present.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed against the validation criteria:\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of reproductive endocrinology and molecular biology. The HPG axis, the roles of gonadotropins ($LH$, $FSH$) and steroid hormones ($E_2$, $P_4$), receptor-ligand interactions ($hCG$/$LHCGR$), and the use of knockout mouse models are all standard, factually correct concepts in the field.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a clearly defined biological system (an $Lhcgr$ knockout mouse), a specific perturbation ($hCG$ injection), and a request for a set of predictable outcomes based on provided first principles. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the given information.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or unverifiable. It is a standard \"thought experiment\" problem type common in biological sciences, requiring the application of foundational knowledge to a specific scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of the Predicted Outcome\n\nThe analysis will proceed by deducing the consequences of the nonfunctional $LHCGR$ based on the provided first principles.\n\n1.  **Baseline State of the $Lhcgr$ Knockout Mouse (Pre-Intervention)**:\n    *   **Follicular Development**: $FSH$ secretion and its receptor are intact. Therefore, $FSH$ can stimulate the growth of ovarian follicles and the proliferation of granulosa cells. Follicles can mature up to the antral stage.\n    *   **Steroidogenesis**: Normal production of estradiol ($E_2$) relies on the \"two-cell, two-gonadotropin\" model. $LH$, acting on the $LHCGR$ in theca cells, stimulates the production of androgens. These androgens then diffuse to the granulosa cells, where they are converted to $E_2$ by the enzyme aromatase, whose activity is stimulated by $FSH$. In the $Lhcgr$ knockout mouse, theca cells cannot respond to endogenous $LH$ due to the nonfunctional receptor. Consequently, androgen production is severely impaired. Without this androgen substrate, granulosa cells cannot synthesize significant amounts of $E_2$, despite having functional aromatase. Therefore, serum $E_2$ levels will be very low. Progesterone ($P_4$) is primarily a product of the post-ovulatory corpus luteum, so it will also be absent.\n    *   **HPG Axis Feedback**: The primary ovarian hormones providing negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary are $E_2$ and $P_4$. Since both are at very low levels, the negative feedback loop is broken. This lack of inhibition leads to a state of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, characterized by chronically elevated pituitary secretion of both $LH$ and $FSH$.\n    *   **Ovulation**: Ovulation cannot occur spontaneously because it requires an $LH$ surge acting on a functional $LHCGR$ on preovulatory follicles.\n\n2.  **Effect of the Exogenous $hCG$ Bolus**:\n    *   The hormone $hCG$ is a biological analog of $LH$ and exerts its effects by binding to and activating the $LHCGR$.\n    *   The core defect in this mouse model is a nonfunctional $LHCGR$.\n    *   Therefore, the administered $hCG$ bolus, despite being present at a pharmacologically adequate dose, will be unable to bind to its target receptor on the ovarian theca and granulosa cells. The $hCG$ will have no biological effect on the ovary.\n\n3.  **Predicted Post-Intervention Phenotype**:\n    *   **Ovulation and Luteinization**: Since the $hCG$ bolus cannot activate the $LHCGR$, it cannot trigger the downstream signaling cascades required for follicular rupture (ovulation) and the subsequent transformation of follicular cells into luteal cells (luteinization). Thus, ovulation will fail.\n    *   **Ovarian Histology**: The ovaries will continue to show the pre-interventional state: follicles will have developed to the antral stage under $FSH$ stimulation but will be arrested at that point, unable to ovulate. Consequently, the ovaries will contain numerous antral follicles but will be devoid of corpora lutea. Since the corpus albicans is the fibrous remnant of a regressed corpus luteum, there will also be an absence of corpora albicantia.\n    *   **Endocrine Profile**:\n        *   **Serum $P_4$**: Since there is no luteinization and no corpus luteum formation, there will be no significant source of $P_4$. Serum $P_4$ will remain markedly low.\n        *   **Serum $E_2$**: The fundamental defect in $E_2$ synthesis (lack of androgen substrate from theca cells) remains uncorrected. Serum $E_2$ will remain reduced.\n        *   **Pituitary $LH$ and $FSH$**: Because the $hCG$ injection does not lead to any production of feedback steroids ($E_2$, $P_4$), the lack of negative feedback on the HPG axis persists. Therefore, pituitary $LH$ and $FSH$ levels will remain elevated.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. No ovulation despite $hCG$; ovaries with enlarged antral follicles that fail to luteinize; absence of corpora lutea and thus absence of corpora albicantia; markedly low serum $P_4$, reduced serum $E_2$, and elevated pituitary $LH$ and $FSH$ due to diminished negative feedback.**\n    This statement perfectly aligns with every aspect of the derived prediction: failed ovulation, arrested follicular development, absence of corpora lutea and albicantia, and a hormonal profile of low steroids ($P_4$, $E_2$) and high gonadotropins ($LH$, $FSH$).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Successful ovulation with multiple corpora lutea; transient high serum $P_4$ followed by luteal regression yielding multiple corpora albicantia; near-normal pituitary $LH$ and $FSH$ after $P_4$ feedback.**\n    This describes the phenotype of a wild-type or superovulated animal. It is fundamentally incorrect because ovulation and corpus luteum formation are impossible without a functional $LHCGR$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Partial granulosa luteinization driven by $FSH$ despite absent $LHCGR$; small but functional corpora lutea; near-normal serum $E_2$ and $P_4$; suppressed pituitary $LH$ via intact feedback.**\n    The premise that $FSH$ can drive luteinization is inconsistent with the provided principles, which assign this role to $LH$/$LHCGR$. Consequently, no corpora lutea would form, and the downstream claims of near-normal steroids and suppressed gonadotropins are false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Failed ovulation, but theca paracrine compensation generates corpus albicans directly without a corpus luteum; low serum $P_4$ with high serum $E_2$ from persistent follicles.**\n    This option contains two critical biological falsehoods. First, a corpus albicans cannot form without a preceding corpus luteum; it is the scar tissue *from* a regressed corpus luteum. Second, serum $E_2$ would be low, not high, due to the lack of theca cell androgen production.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Successful ovulation producing hemorrhagic corpora lutea; serum $P_4$ remains low because of $LHCGR$ knockout; pituitary $LH$ is paradoxically elevated.**\n    This option is internally contradictory. Successful ovulation is mediated by $LHCGR$ and results in a corpus luteum that produces $P_4$. Claiming successful ovulation while also stating $P_4$ remains low due to the knockout is illogical. Ovulation itself would not occur.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The given cell diameters are biologically plausible for human granulosa lutein cells. The approximation of a cell as a sphere is a standard and acceptable simplification for such estimations.

A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in clear, precise, and unbiased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and free of the specified flaws. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in cell volume and a subsequent analysis of the scaling of subcellular components.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the fold-change in volume. The volume of a sphere, $V$, is given in terms of its radius, $r$, as:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\nThe radius $r$ is half of the diameter $d$, so $r = \\frac{d}{2}$. Substituting this into the volume formula gives the volume in terms of the diameter:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{d^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}d^3$$\nLet the initial state be denoted by the subscript $i$ and the final state by the subscript $f$. The initial volume $V_i$ and final volume $V_f$ are:\n$$V_i = \\frac{\\pi}{6}d_i^3$$\n$$V_f = \\frac{\\pi}{6}d_f^3$$\nThe fold-change in volume is defined as the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume, $\\frac{V_f}{V_i}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{V_f}{V_i} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_f^3}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_i^3} = \\left(\\frac{d_f}{d_i}\\right)^3$$\nThe given values are $d_i = 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $d_f = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Substituting these values into the fold-change expression:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\left(\\frac{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^3 = (2)^3 = 8$$\nThe volume of the granulosa cell increases by a factor of $8$ during hypertrophy.\n\nSecond, we analyze the scaling of intracellular organelle abundance. The problem postulates a constant volumetric number density of organelles. Let $N$ be the number of a specific type of organelle and $\\rho_N$ be their volumetric number density. By definition:\n$$\\rho_N = \\frac{N}{V}$$\nThe assumption is that this density is constant during hypertrophy, i.e., $\\rho_{N,i} = \\rho_{N,f}$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{N_i}{V_i} = \\frac{N_f}{V_f}$$\nRearranging this relationship to find the ratio of the final number of organelles to the initial number gives:\n$$\\frac{N_f}{N_i} = \\frac{V_f}{V_i}$$\nThis demonstrates that for the volumetric number density of organelles to remain constant, their total number must scale directly with the cell's volume. Since the volume increases by a fold-change of $8$, the total number of organelles must also increase by a factor of $8$. This is biologically necessary to maintain cellular function throughout the now much larger cytoplasmic volume.\n\nThird, we comment on the scaling of surface-area-limited structures relative to volume. The surface area, $A$, of a sphere is given by:\n$$A = 4\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi d^2$$\nThe fold-change in surface area is the ratio $\\frac{A_f}{A_i}$:\n$$\\frac{A_f}{A_i} = \\frac{\\pi d_f^2}{\\pi d_i^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_f}{d_i}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{30}{15}\\right)^2 = (2)^2 = 4$$\nWhile the volume increases by a factor of $8$ (scaling with $d^3$), the surface area increases by only a factor of $4$ (scaling with $d^2$). The surface-area-to-volume ratio, $\\frac{A}{V}$, therefore scales as:\n$$\\frac{A}{V} \\propto \\frac{d^2}{d^3} = \\frac{1}{d}$$\nAs the cell diameter $d$ doubles, the surface-area-to-volume ratio is halved. This creates a potential bottleneck for processes that depend on surface area, such as transport across the plasma membrane or protein synthesis on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A cell that increases its volume by $8$-fold must support a correspondingly larger metabolic load, but its surface area for exchange and synthesis has only increased $4$-fold. To overcome this limitation, hypertrophied cells like lutein cells must significantly increase the surface area of their functional membranes beyond that of a simple sphere, typically by developing extensive infoldings, microvilli, or a highly elaborate internal membrane network (such as the characteristically abundant smooth ER in steroid-producing lutein cells).",

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of reproductive biology, even while using simplifications (e.g., constant cycle length and ovulation probability) to create a mathematically tractable model. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected cumulative number of corpora albicantia formed between menarche and the present age. According to the problem statement, each ovulatory cycle results in one corpus luteum, which subsequently becomes one corpus albicans. Therefore, the number of corpora albicantia is identical to the number of ovulatory cycles. The problem thus reduces to finding the expected number of ovulatory cycles over the specified time period.\n\nFirst, we determine the total duration of time in which menstrual cycles have been occurring. This is the interval from menarche to the present age.\nLet $A_{current}$ be the current age and $A_{menarche}$ be the age at menarche.\nThe time interval, $\\Delta t$, in years is:\n$$ \\Delta t = A_{current} - A_{menarche} = 35 \\text{ years} - 13 \\text{ years} = 22 \\text{ years} $$\n\nNext, we convert this time interval into days, using the provided value of $365.25$ days per year.\n$$ \\text{Total days} = \\Delta t \\times 365.25 = 22 \\times 365.25 $$\n\nThe problem states that menstrual cycles are regular, with a length of $28$ days. The total number of cycles, $N$, that have occurred during this interval is the total number of days divided by the length of one cycle.\n$$ N = \\frac{22 \\times 365.25}{28} $$\n\nEach cycle is an independent event where ovulation may or may not occur. We can model this as a sequence of Bernoulli trials. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th cycle, for $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n$X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th cycle is ovulatory (resulting in a corpus albicans).\n$X_i = 0$ if the $i$-th cycle is anovulatory.\n\nThe probability of ovulation in any given cycle is given as $p = 0.85$.\nThus, $P(X_i = 1) = p = 0.85$.\nThe expected value of the indicator variable for a single cycle is:\n$$ E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p $$\n\nThe total number of corpora albicantia, $C$, is the sum of the outcomes of these $N$ trials:\n$$ C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i $$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected value of $C$, denoted $E[C]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$ E[C] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\nSince the trials are identically distributed, $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$.

For $7$, $1400/7=200$ and $61/7$ is not an integer, so $1461$ is not divisible by $7$. The sum of the digits of $1461$ is $1+4+6+1=12$, which is divisible by $3$, so $1461 = 3 \\times 487$. The prime factors of the numerator are $3, 11, 17, 487$.\nSince there are no common prime factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction $\\frac{273207}{1120}$ is irreducible.",
