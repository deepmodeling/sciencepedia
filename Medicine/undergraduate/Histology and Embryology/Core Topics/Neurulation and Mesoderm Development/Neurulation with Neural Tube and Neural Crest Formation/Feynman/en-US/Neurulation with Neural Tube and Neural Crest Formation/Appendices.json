            "problem": "A histological examination of an embryo presents three transverse sections taken at defined axial levels: a rostral hindbrain level ($R$), a mid-trunk thoracic level ($T$), and a caudal tailbud level ($C$). The embryo has approximately $N=18$ somite pairs, and all sections are stained to visualize epithelia and the midline mesoderm. The following geometric and cellular features are recorded.\n\nAt level $R$: The neuroepithelium forms a closed tube with a continuous central lumen of elliptical cross-section, the dorsal roof plate is thin, and an epithelial seam persists at the dorsal midline with a thickness of approximately $3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Immediately lateral to the dorsal midline, a small number of cells with a spindle-like morphology are observed separating from the dorsal neuroepithelium and occupying the subectodermal space. The notochord lies ventral to the tube, and paired somites flank the tube laterally.\n\nAt level $T$: Bilaterally symmetric neural folds are elevated and converging toward the dorsal midline. The angle between each fold and the horizontal plane is approximately $\\theta_T\\approx 70^\\circ$. The tips of the neural folds are separated by a gap of approximately $d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Wedge-shaped neuroepithelial cells are present at dorsolateral positions consistent with dorsolateral hingepoints. The overlying surface ectoderm is continuous across the dorsal surface.\n\nAt level $C$: A broad neural plate spans the dorsal surface with a central neural groove. The distance between the incipient fold apices is approximately $d_C\\approx 180\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Wedge-shaped neuroepithelial cells are present at the midline overlying the notochord, consistent with a medial hingepoint, but dorsolateral hingepoints are not yet well formed. The surface ectoderm is continuous and relatively flat.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions from histology and embryology as your base for reasoning. Neurulation is the transformation of the neural plate into the neural tube by bending at hingepoints (medial and dorsolateral), elevation and convergence of neural folds, and fusion at the dorsal midline to form the roof plate. In amniote embryos, neural tube closure initiates near the future cervical region and proceeds bidirectionally as a zipper toward both rostral (cranial) and caudal ends; the cranial neuropore generally closes before the caudal neuropore. After dorsal fusion, an epithelial seam forms transiently at the midline; neural crest cells, specified at the neural plate border, undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and delaminate from the dorsal neuroepithelium shortly after fusion to begin migration. The notochord lies ventral to the neural tube and contributes inductive signals but does not regress at neurulation stages.\n\nBased on the recorded tissue geometry at $R$, $T$, and $C$ and the known progression of closure, which option best infers the overall stage of neurulation and predicts the next imminent morphological change across these levels?\n\nA. The embryo is at the onset of neurulation; the next change will be cranial neuropore closure at level $R$.\n\nB. The closure wave has already passed rostrally and is approaching the trunk; the next change will be dorsal fusion of the neural folds at level $T$, forming a transient epithelial seam and enabling subsequent neural crest delamination there.\n\nC. The embryo has completed closure at $R$ and $T$; the next change will be caudal neuropore closure at level $C$ before any neural crest delamination occurs.\n\nD. The embryo remains in gastrulation; the next change will be formation of the notochord and initial neural plate specification rather than tube closure.\n\nE. The embryo is in mid-neurulation; the next change will be regression of the medial hingepoint at level $C$ prior to any dorsal fusion in the trunk.",
            "solution": "### Problem Statement Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data and definitions for a histological examination of an embryo:\n-   **Axial Levels:** Three transverse sections are taken at:\n    -   $R$: Rostral hindbrain level.\n    -   $T$: Mid-trunk thoracic level.\n    -   $C$: Caudal tailbud level.\n-   **Embryo Stage:** Approximately $N=18$ somite pairs.\n-   **Observations at Level $R$ (Rostral Hindbrain):**\n    -   The neuroepithelium is a closed tube with a continuous elliptical lumen.\n    -   The dorsal roof plate is thin.\n    -   A persistent epithelial seam at the dorsal midline has a thickness of approximately $3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    -   Spindle-like cells are separating from the dorsal neuroepithelium and occupying the subectodermal space.\n    -   The notochord is ventral to the tube, and paired somites are lateral.\n-   **Observations at Level $T$ (Mid-trunk Thoracic):**\n    -   Neural folds are elevated and converging, with an angle $\\theta_T\\approx 70^\\circ$ to the horizontal.\n    -   The gap between neural fold tips is $d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    -   Dorsolateral hingepoints (DLHPs) are present.\n    -   The overlying surface ectoderm is continuous.\n-   **Observations at Level $C$ (Caudal Tailbud):**\n    -   A broad neural plate with a central neural groove.\n    -   The distance between incipient fold apices is $d_C\\approx 180\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    -   A medial hingepoint (MHP) is present.\n    -   DLHPs are not yet well formed.\n-   **Foundational Principles:**\n    -   Neurulation is the process of transforming the neural plate into the neural tube via bending at hingepoints (medial and dorsolateral), fold elevation/convergence, and dorsal midline fusion.\n    -   In amniotes, neural tube closure begins near the future cervical region and proceeds bidirectionally.\n    -   The cranial neuropore typically closes before the caudal neuropore.\n    -   After fusion, a transient epithelial seam forms.\n    -   Neural crest cells (NCCs) undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and delaminate from the dorsal neuroepithelium shortly after fusion.\n    -   The notochord is ventral and inductive.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of neurulation, including the roles of MHP and DLHPs, the zippering closure mechanism, the formation of an epithelial seam post-fusion, and the subsequent delamination of neural crest cells, is entirely consistent with established principles of vertebrate embryology. The staging by somite count ($N=18$) is a standard method. The morphological features described (e.g., wedge-shaped cells at hingepoints, spindle-like migrating cells) are text-book accurate. The numerical values for tissue gaps and angles are plausible.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a snapshot of the embryo's state at three distinct points along the primary axis. Given the well-defined, directional nature of neurulation (\"zippering\"), these spatial data points can be used to infer the temporal sequence of events and predict the next immediate change. The question asks for a specific inference based on this data, for which a unique solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The problem statement is descriptive and uses precise, objective terminology (e.g., \"closed tube,\" \"gap of approximately $d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$,\" \"spindle-like morphology\"). It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The information is self-contained and consistent. The observed progression of neurulation from rostral to caudal (level $R$ is post-fusion, level $T$ is pre-fusion, level $C$ is early folding) perfectly matches the stated principle of bidirectional zippering closure originating from a more rostral initiation site.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a classic scenario for reasoning about the spatio-temporal dynamics of a developmental process. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires synthesizing the observations at the three axial levels ($R$, $T$, and $C$) with the known principles of neurulation to determine the embryo's overall developmental stage and predict the next imminent event.\n\n1.  **Analyze the State at Each Level:**\n    -   **Level $C$ (Caudal):** A broad neural plate ($d_C\\approx 180\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ separation) with an established medial hingepoint (MHP) but poorly formed dorsolateral hingepoints (DLHPs). This represents the earliest stage of neurulation among the three sections, where bending has initiated but fold elevation has not significantly progressed.\n    -   **Level $T$ (Trunk):** The neural folds are highly elevated ($\\theta_T\\approx 70^\\circ$) and on the verge of meeting at the dorsal midline, separated by a very small gap of $d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The presence of well-formed DLHPs is characteristic of this advanced stage of folding and convergence. This level is immediately prior to neural tube closure.\n    -   **Level $R$ (Rostral):** The neural tube is fully formed (\"closed tube\"). The presence of a thin \"epithelial seam\" indicates that fusion has occurred recently. The observation of \"spindle-like cells... separating from the dorsal neuroepithelium\" is the definitive histological sign of neural crest cell (NCC) delamination, which, according to the provided principles, occurs *shortly after* fusion. This is the most developmentally advanced state of the three sections.\n\n2.  **Establish the Spatio-Temporal Sequence:**\n    The developmental maturity of the three levels is $R > T > C$. This spatial arrangement confirms the \"zippering\" model of neurulation. A wave of closure initiated rostral to all these sites (e.g., in the cervical region), has already passed through the hindbrain (level $R$), and is now progressing down the trunk. The \"front\" of this closure wave is currently at the thoracic level ($T$), while the caudal end of the embryo (level $C$) is lagging far behind. The embryo is therefore in the middle of neurulation.\n\n3.  **Predict the Next Imminent Morphological Change:**\n    The next major morphological event will occur at the most advanced point of the progressing closure wave.\n    -   At level $R$, closure is complete and NCC delamination is underway. The subsequent events (NCC migration, differentiation) are more gradual processes.\n    -   At level $C$, the neural plate is still wide open. It must undergo significant elevation and convergence before fusion, which will take considerable time.\n    -   At level $T$, the neural folds are separated by a mere $d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The apposition and fusion of these folds is the most immediate, discrete morphological event set to occur in the entire system. Following this fusion, the conditions will be met for NCCs at this level to begin delamination.\n\nTherefore, the embryo is in mid-neurulation, and the next event will be the fusion of the neural folds at the thoracic level ($T$), establishing a closed tube and facilitating the subsequent delamination of local NCCs.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The embryo is at the onset of neurulation; the next change will be cranial neuropore closure at level $R$.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. The embryo is not at the onset of neurulation; it is well underway, as evidenced by the closed tube at level $R$ and advanced folds at level $T$. Furthermore, the tube at level $R$ (hindbrain) is already closed, so its closure cannot be the \"next change.\" Cranial neuropore closure would have preceded the state observed at $R$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The closure wave has already passed rostrally and is approaching the trunk; the next change will be dorsal fusion of the neural folds at level $T$, forming a transient epithelial seam and enabling subsequent neural crest delamination there.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement accurately describes the situation. The closed tube at $R$ shows the closure wave has passed rostrally. The highly elevated folds at $T$ show the wave is approaching the trunk. Given the small gap ($d_T\\approx 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), fusion at $T$ is the most imminent event. The consequences of this fusion—formation of an epithelial seam and subsequent NCC delamination—are correctly stated as per the provided principles.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The embryo has completed closure at $R$ and $T$; the next change will be caudal neuropore closure at level $C$ before any neural crest delamination occurs.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect on multiple counts. First, closure is not complete at level $T$; the folds are still unfused. Second, neural crest delamination is explicitly described as already occurring at level $R$. Third, the closure at level $C$ is a distant future event compared to the impending fusion at level $T$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The embryo remains in gastrulation; the next change will be formation of the notochord and initial neural plate specification rather than tube closure.**\n-   **Analysis:** This is incorrect. The presence of a neural plate, neural folds, a closed neural tube, and approximately $N=18$ somite pairs are all hallmarks of neurulation, a post-gastrulation stage. The problem states the notochord is already present.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. The embryo is in mid-neurulation; the next change will be regression of the medial hingepoint at level $C$ prior to any dorsal fusion in the trunk.**\n-   **Analysis:** While the embryo is indeed in mid-neurulation, the predicted next change is incorrect. The medial hingepoint is a crucial structure for initiating folding and does not \"regress\" at this stage. More importantly, fusion at level $T$ is far more imminent than any major morphological change at level $C$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

Use the following base concepts, which are broadly accepted and serve as starting points:\n\n- Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) coordinates polarized behaviors of cells within the plane of an epithelium, biasing cell intercalation and cytoskeletal tension along preferred axes.

            "solution": "### Problem Statement Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System:** A cohort of mouse embryos engineered to lack functional Van Gogh-like protein 2 (Vangl2).\n- **Definition 1:** Vangl2 is a core component of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway.\n- **Principle 1:** The PCP pathway coordinates polarized behaviors of cells within an epithelium, biasing cell intercalation and cytoskeletal tension along preferred axes.\n- **Application 1:** In the neural plate, PCP biases mediolateral cell intercalation, driving convergent extension that reduces tissue width $W$ (mediolateral dimension) and increases length $L$ (anteroposterior dimension).\n- **Principle 2:** Epithelial bending at hinge points is produced by apical constriction via actomyosin contractility.\n- **Relation 1:** Bending is characterized by curvature $\\kappa$ and bending moment $M$, satisfying $M = E I \\kappa$, where $E$ is the effective tissue elastic modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area.\n- **Mechanical Constraint 1:** For a given bending capacity, increasing the distance between the neural folds (larger $W$) increases the mechanical work needed to appose the folds.\n- **Principle 3:** Closure dynamics depend on the balance between anisotropic in-plane tension (mediolateral $\\sigma_{ML}$ relative to anteroposterior $\\sigma_{AP}$) and out-of-plane bending moments at the median hinge point (MHP) and dorsolateral hinge points (DLHPs).\n- **Assumption:** Vangl2 loss reduces mediolateral anisotropy such that $\\sigma_{ML}$ is effectively diminished relative to $\\sigma_{AP}$, with secondary effects on cell intercalation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of developmental biology and biomechanics. The role of the PCP pathway, and specifically core components like Vangl2, in regulating convergent extension during neurulation is a fundamental and well-documented concept. The mechanical principles described (apical constriction, bending moments, convergent extension) are standard models for epithelial morphogenesis. The described knockout experiment is a standard technique in developmental genetics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial condition (loss of Vangl2 function), a set of governing principles, and a specific question (predict the morphological phenotype). The provided information is sufficient to deduce a logical outcome. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived from the premises.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language (e.g., $W$, $L$, $\\kappa$, $\\sigma_{ML}$). It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires predicting the morphological phenotype of neurulation given the loss of function of Vangl2, a core PCP pathway protein. The solution is derived by tracing the consequences of this molecular defect through cellular and tissue-level mechanics, based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Initial Defect:** Loss of functional Vangl2.\n2.  **Molecular/Cellular Consequence:** As a core component of the PCP pathway, loss of Vangl2 disrupts the ability of cells to coordinate their polarity within the plane of the neural plate epithelium. The problem explicitly states this leads to reduced mediolateral anisotropy, a diminished $\\sigma_{ML}$, and impacts mediolateral cell intercalation.\n3.  **Impact on Convergent Extension:** The problem defines that PCP-driven mediolateral cell intercalation is the engine of convergent extension. Convergent extension is the process that actively reduces the mediolateral width $W$ of the neural plate while simultaneously increasing its anteroposterior length $L$. A defect in mediolateral cell intercalation directly implies a failure of convergent extension.\n4.  **Prediction of Neural Plate Geometry:** If convergent extension fails, the neural plate will not undergo its normal narrowing and lengthening. Consequently, it will remain wider than normal (increased $W$) and shorter than normal (decreased $L$). This results in a characteristic broad, stubby neural plate.\n5.  **Impact on Neural Fold Apposition:** The problem states that increasing the distance between the neural folds (a larger $W$) increases the mechanical work needed for their apposition. With a significantly widened neural plate, the dorsolateral hinge points (DLHPs), which form the crests of the neural folds, are much farther apart. Bringing these folds together requires overcoming greater tissue resistance over a larger distance.\n6.  **Impact on Hinge Point Bending:** While the primary defect is in convergent extension, the PCP pathway's role in organizing the cytoskeleton is global. Disorganized polarity can reasonably be expected to disrupt the highly coordinated process of apical constriction at the hinge points (MHP and DLHPs). Less effective or disorganized apical constriction would lead to a smaller bending moment $M$, and according to the relation $M = E I \\kappa$, a reduced curvature $\\kappa$. The hinge points would be shallower.\n7.  **Synthesis of Closure Dynamics:** The combination of a geometrically unfavorable wide plate (increased $W$) and mechanically inefficient bending (reduced $\\kappa$) creates an insurmountable barrier to neural tube closure. The neural folds will fail to elevate, bend, and fuse at the dorsal midline.\n8.  **Predicted Final Phenotype:** The failure of closure is not expected to be a localized event (like spina bifida occulta) because the underlying defect in convergent extension is a process that shapes the entire embryonic axis. Therefore, the failure to close will likely extend from the cranial region to the posterior end of the axis. This severe phenotype, characterized by a completely open neural tube along the entire body axis, is known as craniorachischisis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A widened neural plate (increased $W$), shortened anteroposterior axis (decreased $L$), reduced curvature $\\kappa$ at hinge points, slower or failed apposition of neural folds at initiation sites, and a continuous open neural axis consistent with craniorachischisis.**\n- This option accurately describes every consequence derived from the first principles. Failure of convergent extension leads to increased $W$ and decreased $L$. The increased distance between neural folds and potential defects in organized apical constriction lead to reduced $\\kappa$ and failed apposition. The global nature of the defect results in craniorachischisis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A narrowed neural plate (decreased $W$), elongated axis (increased $L$), increased curvature $\\kappa$ at hinge points, accelerated closure, and premature overfolding of the neural tube.**\n- This option describes the exact opposite of the predicted outcome. A narrowed width $W$ and increased length $L$ would result from *hyperactive* convergent extension, not a loss-of-function defect in the PCP pathway that drives it.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Normal neural plate width $W$ and length $L$, with exaggerated apical constriction at hinge points producing hypercurvature $\\kappa$ and a small-diameter neural tube (microcephaly-like phenotype) despite intact closure.**\n- This option incorrectly states that neural plate width $W$ and length $L$ would be normal. This contradicts the fundamental role of PCP in convergent extension. There is no basis to predict exaggerated apical constriction from a loss-of-function mutation that generally causes disorganization.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Isolated posterior spina bifida with normal cranial closure, arising solely from floor plate patterning defects independent of tissue-scale mechanics and planar polarity.**\n- This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, it proposes a localized defect (posterior spina bifida), whereas a defect in the core PCP machinery like Vangl2 causes a global defect along the axis. Second, it incorrectly decouples the phenotype from planar polarity and tissue mechanics, which are the very subjects of the problem and the primary function of Vangl2. Third, it misattributes the cause to floor plate patterning, which is primarily regulated by other signaling pathways (e.g., Sonic hedgehog).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A widened neural plate (increased $W$) but normal closure achieved by compensatory increases in apical constriction, yielding delayed yet complete neural tube closure without axis length defects.**\n- This option is internally inconsistent and biologically implausible in this context. While it correctly identifies the widened neural plate (increased $W$), it incorrectly suggests normal closure through a compensatory mechanism. Such compensation is highly unlikely to overcome the severe mechanical and geometric challenge of a very wide plate. Furthermore, it contradicts itself by positing a widened plate (failure of convergence) \"without axis length defects\" (implying normal extension), which violates the definition of convergent extension as a coupled process.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A simple model for the concentration from a single line source at $x_{source}$ is $C(x) = C_0 e^{-|x - x_{source}|/\\lambda}$, where $C_0$ is the source strength and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length.\n    -   According to Assumption (ii), the total concentration is the sum of the contributions from both sources:\n        $$[Shh](x) = C_0 e^{-|x - a|/\\lambda} + C_0 e^{-|x + a|/\\lambda}$$\n    -   Let's analyze the shape of this concentration profile. We are particularly interested in whether the peak concentration is at the midline ($x=0$) or at the locations of the sources ($x=\\pm a$).\n    -   The concentration at the midline ($x=0$) is:\n        $$[Shh](0) = C_0 e^{-|0 - a|/\\lambda} + C_0 e^{-|0 + a|/\\lambda} = C_0 e^{-a/\\lambda} + C_0 e^{-a/\\lambda} = 2C_0 e^{-a/\\lambda}$$\n    -   The concentration at one of the sources (e.g., $x=a$) is:\n        $$[Shh](a) = C_0 e^{-|a - a|/\\lambda} + C_0 e^{-|a + a|/\\lambda} = C_0 e^0 + C_0 e^{-2a/\\lambda} = C_0(1 + e^{-2a/\\lambda})$$\n    -   The problem states the critical condition $2a > \\lambda$, which implies $a > \\lambda/2$. We must determine if this leads to a central peak or a central trough. A trough exists at $x=0$ if $[Shh](0) < [Shh](a)$.\n        $$2C_0 e^{-a/\\lambda} < C_0(1 + e^{-2a/\\lambda})$$\n        $$2 e^{-a/\\lambda} < 1 + e^{-2a/\\lambda}$$\n        Let $y = e^{-a/\\lambda}$. The inequality becomes $2y < 1 + y^2$, which rearranges to $y^2 - 2y + 1 > 0$, or $(y-1)^2 > 0$.\n    -   This inequality is true for all $y \\neq 1$. Since $a > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$, we have $y = e^{-a/\\lambda} < 1$. Therefore, the inequality $(y-1)^2 > 0$ holds strictly.\n    -   This proves mathematically that the concentration at the midline, $[Shh](0)$, is lower than the concentration at the sources, $[Shh](\\pm a)$. The concentration profile thus has two peaks, located at $x=\\pm a$, and a local minimum (a trough) at the midline, $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Biological Consequences:**\n    -   **Cell Fate Specification (Assumption iii):** High [Shh] is required to induce floor plate identity. Since the concentration peaks are at $x=\\pm a$, two distinct regions of floor plate tissue will be induced, one overlying each heminotochord. The central region at $x=0$ will experience a low [Shh] and will not form a floor plate; instead, it will adopt a more dorsal or intermediate neural identity. This results in duplicated ventral midlines.\n    -   **Morphogenesis (Assumptions iii & iv):** High [Shh] also promotes the formation of the Medial Hinge Point (MHP), which acts as an anchor for ventral bending of the neural plate. The two peaks of Shh at $x=\\pm a$ will therefore induce two MHP-like structures. The neural plate will be anchored ventrally at these two lateral positions. Bending will initiate at these two points, causing the formation of two invaginating tubes. The tissue between the two anchors (around $x=0$) is not anchored ventrally and, being flanked by two downward-bending regions, is likely to remain as a flat or upwardly-buckled septum. This process leads to a \"split cord\" malformation, a condition known as diastematomyelia, where two hemicords are formed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A single, normal midline neural tube with one floor plate at $x=0$, because the two Shh sources sum to a single central maximum that restores a normal midline Shh peak and thus a single MHP.**\n-   **Analysis:** This is incorrect. As derived above, the condition $2a > \\lambda$ ensures that the two sources are too far apart for their signals to sum to a single central maximum. Instead, they create two lateral peaks and a central trough.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. A split cord with duplicated ventral midlines (two floor plates) aligned above $x=\\pm a$, separated by a persistent midline septum, because the two separated Shh sources create two lateral Shh peaks and a central trough, inducing two MHPs over the heminotochords while failing to anchor or induce an MHP at $x=0$.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option aligns perfectly with the derivation. The spatial separation of the Shh sources ($2a > \\lambda$) leads to two concentration peaks at $x=\\pm a$ and a trough at $x=0$. These peaks induce two floor plates and two MHP-like anchors, while the low central concentration fails to induce a central MHP. The mechanical consequence of two ventral anchors is the formation of two neural tubes, or a split cord.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. A global failure of neural tube closure resembling craniorachischisis, because splitting the notochord removes Shh influence from the neural plate altogether.**\n-   **Analysis:** This is factually incorrect based on the problem statement, which explicitly states that the heminotochords \"remain viable and continue to secrete Sonic hedgehog (Shh)\". The Shh signal is not removed; its spatial distribution is altered.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. A single neural tube that is dorsally ventralized, because the two Shh sources cancel at the midline, eliminating ventral identities centrally but producing a dorsal floor plate.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option contains multiple errors. Morphogen concentrations are additive (Assumption ii), they do not \"cancel\". The concept of a \"dorsal floor plate\" is a biological contradiction, as the floor plate is by definition the most ventral structure, induced by the highest concentration of the ventralizing signal, Shh.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Bilateral open neural folds that never fuse (bilateral spina bifida without duplication), because two anchors cause competing, equal and opposite bending moments that prevent any zippering.**\n-   **Analysis:** This misinterprets the consequence of having two anchors. The primary effect is not a cancellation of bending, but the induction of bending at two separate locations. This leads to the formation of two structures (duplication), not simply the failure of a single structure to form. While fusion defects might also occur, the cardinal phenotype resulting from two ventral organizing centers is duplication.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
