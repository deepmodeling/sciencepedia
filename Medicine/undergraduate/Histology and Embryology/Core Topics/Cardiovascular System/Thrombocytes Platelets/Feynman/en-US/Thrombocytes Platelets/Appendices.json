            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of human hematology, is well-posed, and uses objective, precise language. It provides a sufficient basis for a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe task is to identify the statement that correctly defines the formed elements of blood and provides their typical concentrations and relative proportions by count in a healthy adult.\n\n**1. Definition of Formed Elements**\nAs stated in the problem's premises, \"Peripheral blood consists of a liquid phase (plasma) and a cellular phase called formed elements\". It further clarifies that \"formed elements... include Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs; leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes)\". This definition is the standard in histology and physiology. Formed elements are the cellular and cell-fragment components suspended in the plasma.\n\n**2. Standard Reference Values for Formed Elements**\nStandard clinical reference values are typically given per microliter ($\\mu\\mathrm{L}$), which is equivalent to a cubic millimeter ($\\mathrm{mm}^3$). The problem requires these values to be expressed per liter ($\\mathrm{L}$). The conversion factor is $1 \\, \\mathrm{L} = 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n\n*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs):** The typical range is approximately $4.0$ to $5.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. A representative value used for general calculation is $\\sim 5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n    Converting to liters:\n    $$ (5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 5 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n\n*   **White Blood Cells (WBCs; Leukocytes):** The typical range is $4,000$ to $11,000 \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, which is $4$ to $11 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n    Converting to liters:\n    $$ (4 \\text{ to } 11 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 4 \\text{ to } 11 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{cells} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n\n*   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** The typical range is $150,000$ to $450,000 \\, \\mathrm{fragments} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, which is $150$ to $450 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n    Converting to liters:\n    $$ (150 \\text{ to } 450 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{fragments} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 150 \\text{ to } 450 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{fragments} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Proportions and Ratios**\nUsing representative mean values:\n*   RBCs: $5 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n*   WBCs: $7.5 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ (midpoint of $4$ and $11$)\n*   Platelets: $300 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ (midpoint of $150$ and $450$)\n\n**Ratio of RBCs to Platelets:**\n$$ \\frac{\\text{RBC count}}{\\text{Platelet count}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{12}}{300 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{12}}{3 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.7 $$\nThe ratio is approximately $17:1$. A range of $10:1$ to $20:1$ is a reasonable representation of the physiological variation. For example, using the lower limit for RBCs ($4 \\times 10^{12}$) and upper for platelets ($450 \\times 10^9$) gives a ratio of $\\frac{4000}{450} \\approx 8.9:1$. Using the upper limit for RBCs ($5.5 \\times 10^{12}$) and lower for platelets ($150 \\times 10^9$) gives $\\frac{5500}{150} \\approx 36.7:1$. The range $10-20:1$ covers the most typical scenarios.\n\n**Ratio of RBCs to WBCs:**\n$$ \\frac{\\text{RBC count}}{\\text{WBC count}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{12}}{7.5 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{5000}{7.5} \\approx 667 $$\nThe ratio is approximately $670:1$. The full physiological range would be from $\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{12}}{11 \\times 10^9} \\approx 364$ to $\\frac{5.5 \\times 10^{12}}{4 \\times 10^9} = 1375$. A range of $700-1200:1$, as suggested in one option, is a plausible, albeit not exhaustive, sub-range of these typical ratios.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.

Formed elements include plasma proteins and dissolved ions along with cells; typical counts per liter are RBCs $\\sim 5\\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, leukocytes $40$ to $110\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, and platelets $15$ to $45\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. By count, RBCs constitute less than $50\\%$ of formed elements.**\n*   **Definition:** Incorrect. It wrongly includes dissolved plasma components (proteins, ions) in the definition of formed elements.\n*   **Counts per liter:** The leukocyte count is too high by a factor of $10$. The platelet count is too low by a factor of $10$.\n*   **Proportions/Ratios:** The statement that RBCs are less than $50\\%$ by count is false.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Formed elements are RBCs, leukocytes, and platelets; typical counts per liter are RBCs $\\sim 5\\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, leukocytes $0.4$ to $1.1\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, and platelets $1.5$ to $4.5\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. By count, platelets and leukocytes are rare relative to RBCs by about $10^{3}:1$.**\n*   **Definition:** Correct.\n*   **Counts per liter:** The leukocyte count is too low by a factor of $10$. The platelet count is too low by a factor of $100$.\n*   **Proportions/Ratios:** The statement lumping platelets and leukocytes together into a single ratio of $10^3:1$ relative to RBCs is imprecise and inaccurate. The RBC:WBC ratio is on this order of magnitude ($\\sim 700:1$), but the RBC:platelet ratio is much smaller ($\\sim 17:1$).\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Formed elements are RBCs, leukocytes, and platelets; typical reference counts per microliter are RBCs $\\sim 5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, leukocytes $4$ to $11\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, and platelets $150$ to $450\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. By count, RBCs are approximately $99\\%$ of formed elements.**\n*   **Definition:** Correct.\n*   **Counts:** The numerical values are correct for the units provided ($\\mu\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$). However, the question explicitly asks for counts \"per liter\". This option fails to provide the answer in the requested units.\n*   **Proportions/Ratios:** The statement that RBCs constitute approximately $99\\%$ of formed elements by count is incorrect. This high percentage is only achieved if platelets are excluded from the total count.\n    Total count (using mean values per $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$): $(5 \\times 10^6)_{\\text{RBC}} + (300 \\times 10^3)_{\\text{platelet}} + (7.5 \\times 10^3)_{\\text{WBC}} = 5,307,500$.\n    RBC fraction: $\\frac{5 \\times 10^6}{5,307,500} \\approx 0.942$, or $94.2 \\%$. This is not \"approximately $99\\%$\". The $99\\%$ figure is a common error resulting from ignoring platelets.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option A correctly provides the definition, counts per liter, and proportional relationships.",

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n-   **Preparation:** A peripheral blood smear is prepared using a spreader slide at an angle of approximately $30^{\\circ}$–$40^{\\circ}$.\n-   **Staining:** Wright-Giemsa stain is used.\n    -   It contains an acidic dye (eosin Y) that binds basic cytoplasmic components.\n    -   It contains a basic dye (methylene blue and its oxidation products, azure) that binds acidic nuclear material.\n-   **Smear Structure:** The smear has a gradient in film thickness, $h(x)$, which decreases from a thick end to a feathered edge.\n-   **Cell Morphology (RBC):**\n    -   Red blood cells (RBCs) are biconcave discs.\n    -   Diameter, $d \\approx 7$–$8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    -   Rim thickness, $t_r \\approx 2$–$3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    -   Central thickness, $t_c \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   **Optimal RBC Appearance:**\n    -   Exhibit a central pallor of about $1/3$ their diameter.\n    -   The periphery is more intensely eosinophilic (pink-salmon) than the center due to higher hemoglobin concentration at the rim.\n-   **Physical Principle of Spreading:**\n    -   An advancing meniscus causes spatial segregation of blood elements.\n    -   The largest cells tend to lag.\n    -   The smallest particles tend to be carried further forward.\n-   **Objective:** Identify the correct region for:\n    1.  Red cell morphology analysis.\n    2.  White blood cell (WBC) differential analysis.\n    3.  Platelet estimation.\n-   **Constraint:** The platelet distribution can be biased by the spreading process.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of hematology and laboratory medicine. The description of manual blood smear preparation, the mechanism of Wright-Giemsa staining (a Romanowsky stain), the morphology of red blood cells, and the characteristics of an optimal smear for microscopic evaluation are all factually correct. The physical principle of particle segregation in a drying thin film (the \"snowplow effect\"), where smaller particles (platelets) are pushed toward the advancing edge of the meniscus, is a well-documented phenomenon that creates a known-artifact in manual smears.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the identification of a specific region on the smear and a justification based on the provided principles. A single, standard, and correct answer exists based on best practices in clinical laboratory science, which are themselves derived from these principles.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated objectively, using precise technical language and quantitative descriptions (e.g., cell dimensions, spreader angle). The term \"optimal\" is not subjective but refers to the technically correct zone that yields diagnostically reliable and accurate results, as defined by standard laboratory protocols.\n\nNo flaws are detected. The problem is a valid application of physical and biological principles to a standard diagnostic procedure.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to identify the optimal zone for microscopic evaluation of a peripheral blood smear. A properly made smear has three distinct regions: the thick end (origin), the body (monolayer), and the feathered edge.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Smear Regions:**\n    -   **Thick End:** Here, the film thickness $h(x)$ is much greater than the cell diameters. Cells are crowded and piled on top of each other, often forming rouleaux (stacks of RBCs). Due to the thickness, stain penetration is poor, and morphological details are obscured. This region is unsuitable for any quantitative or qualitative assessment.\n    -   **Feathered Edge:** Here, the film thickness $h(x) \\to 0$. The shear forces from the spreader slide are maximal in this region. As a result, RBCs are distorted, flattened, and lose their biconcave shape. This artifactually eliminates the central pallor, making them appear as spherocytes. Cells can also be stretched into teardrop or other bizarre shapes. WBCs may be damaged or spread too thinly, distorting nuclear and cytoplasmic features. This region is also unsuitable for accurate morphological assessment.\n    -   **Monolayer Zone:** This is the transitional region between the thick end and the feathered edge. Here, the film thickness is ideal, such that cells are spread into a single layer. The RBCs are close, sometimes lightly touching, but not significantly overlapping. In this zone, RBCs retain their natural biconcave-disc morphology, which under the microscope translates to the characteristic appearance described: a pink-salmon colored cell with a central pallor approximately $1/3$ of the cell's diameter. WBCs are also well-preserved, with clear nuclear and cytoplasmic detail, allowing for accurate identification and differential counting. This is the universally accepted optimal zone for RBC and WBC evaluation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Particle Distribution (Platelets):**\n    -   The problem states a key physical principle: \"the smallest particles to be carried further forward\". Platelets (thrombocytes), with a diameter of $2$–$4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, are the smallest formed elements in the blood.\n    -   During the spreading process, the advancing meniscus of the blood drop acts like a \"snowplow,\" pushing these smaller, lighter particles ahead of the larger, heavier cells (RBCs and especially WBCs).\n    -   This physical process results in a non-uniform distribution of platelets. Their concentration is artificially low in the thick end and body of the smear and artificially high at the extreme feathered edge.\n    -   Therefore, performing a platelet estimate at the feathered edge would capture this artificially high concentration, leading to a significant **overestimation** of the true platelet count. To obtain a representative estimate, one must count platelets in the same optimal monolayer zone used for RBC/WBC analysis, where the distribution, while not perfectly uniform, is most representative of the patient's blood. Counting is typically averaged over $5$–$10$ oil-immersion fields in this zone.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The optimal zone for analysis is the monolayer, located just proximal to (before) the feathered edge. This zone is ideal for RBC and WBC morphology. For platelet estimation, this same zone must be used, and the extreme feathered edge must be avoided to prevent artifactual overestimation.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The optimal monolayer lies just proximal to the feathered edge, where RBCs lightly touch but do not overlap, each showing a central pallor near $1/3$ of $d$, and WBC nuclear detail is crisp; platelet estimates should be made in this monolayer zone rather than at the feathered edge because the advancing meniscus preferentially carries smaller particles forward, concentrating platelets at the edge and causing overestimation there.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies the location of the optimal monolayer (\"just proximal to the feathered edge\"). It accurately describes the ideal appearance of RBCs (\"lightly touch but do not overlap,\" \"central pallor near $1/3$ of $d$\") and WBCs (\"nuclear detail is crisp\"). It also correctly explains the physics of platelet distribution (\"advancing meniscus preferentially carries smaller particles forward\") and the consequence of this phenomenon (\"concentrating platelets at the edge and causing overestimation there\"). It correctly concludes that platelet estimation should be done in the monolayer, not the edge.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The optimal monolayer lies in the thick central region where RBCs form rouleaux, minimizing shear artifacts; platelet estimates should be performed at the feathered edge because platelets are evenly distributed across the smear.**\n-   **Analysis:** The \"thick central region where RBCs form rouleaux\" is unsuitable for evaluation due to cell overlap. While shear is indeed minimal, morphology is unreadable. The claim that \"platelets are evenly distributed\" directly contradicts the physical principle stated in the problem.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The optimal monolayer is the extreme feathered edge where RBCs are elongated and teardrop-shaped from shear, and central pallor is minimal; platelet estimation should be performed at the edge to include more platelets and improve statistical precision.**\n-   **Analysis:** The \"extreme feathered edge\" is a zone of cellular artifact and distortion, not the optimal monolayer. The description of RBCs (\"elongated and teardrop-shaped\") confirms this. Counting platelets in a region of known artificial concentration does not \"improve statistical precision\"; it introduces a large systematic error (bias), leading to an inaccurate result (overestimation).\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The optimal monolayer is wherever WBC density is highest, independent of RBC overlap, since nuclear contrast is maximal; platelet estimation should be performed where platelet clumps are visible to avoid undercounting.**\n-   **Analysis:** WBCs are also distributed unevenly, often congregating at the edges. Evaluating them \"independent of RBC overlap\" is improper practice; the context of surrounding RBCs is crucial, and significant overlap indicates an unreadable area. Counting platelets where clumps are visible is incorrect; clumps are themselves artifacts and will lead to a grossly inaccurate, non-representative estimate. The presence of clumps should be noted, but the quantitative estimate must be made in an area of even distribution.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The optimal monolayer is the uniform pale-blue region where RBCs show homogeneous coloration without central pallor; platelet estimation should be performed at the thick end because platelets are lost toward the feathered edge, leading to underestimation there.**\n-   **Analysis:** Properly stained RBCs are eosinophilic (pink-salmon), not \"pale-blue\". The absence of central pallor indicates cellular artifact (e.g., spherocytosis or flattening at the feathered edge). This is not the optimal zone. The physics of platelet distribution is misrepresented; platelets are not \"lost toward the feathered edge\" but are pushed toward it. Counting in the thick end is impossible due to overlap and would lead to underestimation, but the reasoning provided is flawed.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder, and provides a set of clinical laboratory data to be interpreted based on fundamental principles of platelet physiology.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Profile:** $22$-year-old with lifelong mucocutaneous bleeding.\n-   **Sample:** Peripheral blood platelet-rich plasma (PRP), adjusted to a platelet count of $250 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$.\n-   **Flow Cytometry Data:**\n    -   Glycoprotein Ib (GPIb; CD42b) expression: $5\\%$ of control.\n    -   Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) expression: $95\\%$ of control.\n-   **Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) Data:**\n    -   Ristocetin ($1.2\\,\\text{mg/mL}$): No agglutination.\n    -   Higher ristocetin concentrations: No restoration of agglutination.\n    -   Collagen (standard dose): Normal aggregation.\n-   **Mixing Study:** Patient PRP mixed $1{:}1$ with normal platelet-poor plasma (PPP) results in a continued absence of response to ristocetin.\n-   **Fundamental Principles:**\n    1.  von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds to GPIb, mediating shear-dependent adhesion.\n    2.  Collagen binds to GPVI, mediating adhesion and signaling.\n    3.  Ristocetin induces vWF–GPIb–dependent platelet agglutination.\n    4.  Collagen induces GPVI-dependent activation and aggregation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the well-established principles of hematology and platelet biology. The described tests (LTA, flow cytometry), receptors (GPIb, GPVI), ligands (vWF, collagen), and clinical presentation are standard in the diagnosis of inherited platelet disorders. All statements are factually and scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent data and a clear set of fundamental principles to allow for a logical deduction of a single, most likely diagnosis from the given options.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical, and quantitative terms (e.g., receptor expression percentages, agonist concentrations), free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question that can be solved by applying the provided principles to the given data. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe task is to identify the inherited defect that explains the full set of laboratory findings. We will analyze the data in light of the provided fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Ristocetin Agglutination and Mixing Study:** The provided principle states that ristocetin induces vWF–GPIb–dependent platelet agglutination. An absent response implies a defect in this axis. The potential culprits are:\n    a. A deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet receptor GPIb.\n    b. A deficiency or dysfunction of the plasma protein von Willebrand factor (vWF).\n    The mixing study is a critical differentiator. In this study, the patient's platelets (from PRP) are mixed with normal plasma (from PPP), which contains a normal concentration of functional vWF. The fact that the absent response to ristocetin is *not* corrected upon addition of normal plasma definitively rules out a plasma vWF deficiency. The defect must be intrinsic to the patient's platelets.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Flow Cytometry:** Flow cytometry directly quantifies the surface expression of platelet receptors. The data shows a severe reduction in GPIb expression ($5\\%$ of control) but normal expression of GPVI ($95\\%$ of control). This finding powerfully corroborates the conclusion from the mixing study: the platelet-intrinsic defect is a deficiency of the GPIb receptor.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Collagen Aggregation:** The principles state that collagen induces GPVI-dependent activation and aggregation. The patient's platelets exhibit normal aggregation in response to collagen. This is consistent with the normal GPVI expression ($95\\%$ of control) found by flow cytometry. It also implies that the signaling pathways downstream of receptor activation, including the function of integrin $\\alpha_{IIb}\\beta_3$ (GPIIb/IIIa) required for platelet-platelet aggregation, are intact.\n\n4.  **Synthesis:** The patient's data collectively point to a single, consistent diagnosis: a severe deficiency of the platelet surface receptor GPIb. This explains:\n    -   The lifelong bleeding history (as GPIb is essential for initial platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury).\n    -   The low GPIb expression on flow cytometry.\n    -   The absent agglutination to ristocetin (which requires GPIb).\n    -   The failure of the mixing study to correct the ristocetin defect (as the platelet receptor itself is missing).\n    -   The normal aggregation to collagen (as the GPVI receptor and downstream pathways are unaffected).\nThis specific constellation of findings is the hallmark of Bernard–Soulier syndrome.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. Bernard–Soulier syndrome due to deficiency of the GPIb-IX-V complex:** This syndrome is defined by a genetic defect causing a quantitative or qualitative deficiency in the GPIb-IX-V complex. This perfectly matches our derived conclusion. The deficiency of GPIb explains the low flow cytometry result, the absent ristocetin-induced agglutination, and the uncorrected mixing study. The normal collagen response is also expected. This is the most likely diagnosis.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Glanzmann thrombasthenia due to deficiency of integrin $\\alpha_{\\text{IIb}}\\beta_3$ (GPIIb/IIIa):** This disorder affects the final step of aggregation. Patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia would show absent or severely impaired aggregation to *all* major agonists, including collagen. This contradicts the finding of normal collagen aggregation in the patient. Furthermore, GPIb expression and ristocetin-induced agglutination are typically normal in this condition, which also contradicts the patient's data.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Isolated platelet GPVI deficiency:** In this condition, GPVI expression would be deficient, leading to an absent or impaired aggregation response to collagen. The patient's data shows normal GPVI expression ($95\\%$) and normal collagen aggregation. This option is directly contradicted by the evidence.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Severe von Willebrand disease (type $3$) with absent plasma von Willebrand factor:** This is a deficiency in the plasma protein vWF, not a platelet receptor. While it would cause absent ristocetin agglutination, the defect would be corrected in the mixing study upon addition of normal plasma containing vWF. The problem explicitly states the defect was not corrected. Additionally, platelet GPIb expression would be normal in vWD, contrary to the patient's $5\\%$ level.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Platelet storage pool disease (dense granule deficiency):** This disorder affects the release of secondary agonists (like ADP) from dense granules, which are needed to sustain and amplify the aggregation response. It typically results in an impaired \"second wave\" of aggregation but not a complete absence of initial response to strong agonists. Critically, ristocetin-induced agglutination (which is vWF-GPIb binding and not dependent on granule release) is normal. This contradicts the absent ristocetin response in the patient. Platelet receptor expression is also normal.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
