Before the coronary circulation is established, the myocardium must receive oxygen directly by diffusion from the blood it pumps.

            "problem": "The heart wall consists of the endocardium (a luminal endothelial lining with subendothelial connective tissue), the myocardium (the contractile muscular layer), and the epicardium (the visceral pericardium). In early embryonic development, before coronary vasculature is functional, oxygen delivery to the myocardium is largely diffusion-limited from the ventricular lumen across the endocardium. Trabeculation of the inner myocardial surface (trabeculae carneae) increases the interface area between the endocardium and the lumen and is thought to enhance oxygenation.\n\nAssume diffusion-limited oxygen delivery obeys Fick’s first law, and that in the embryonic setting the diffusion coefficient $D$, the oxygen concentration difference $\\Delta C$ across the boundary, and the effective diffusion path length $\\delta$ at the endocardial interface are uniform and identical between two configurations of the same myocardial region:\n- A smooth-walled configuration with a planar endocardial surface.\n- A trabeculated configuration in which the endocardial surface bears identical cylindrical trabeculae.\n\nConsider an idealized myocardial slab of base area $W \\times L$ and thickness $T$ with the following parameters: $W = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $L = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $T = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

It is free of subjective language or opinion.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The setup is self-contained and consistent. The information provided is sufficient to determine a unique numerical answer.

It is a standard application of linear elasticity theory to a biomechanical system, is well-posed with sufficient data, and is scientifically grounded.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of stress distributions in a thick-walled spherical shell, a qualitative argument based on the result, and a quantitative calculation. We begin with the principles of continuum mechanics under conditions of spherical symmetry.\n\nFor a static, spherically symmetric body with no body forces, the only non-trivial equation of equilibrium (Cauchy's equation) in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{r}}{dr} + \\frac{2}{r}(\\sigma_{r} - \\sigma_{t}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{r}$ is the radial stress and $\\sigma_{t} = \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\phi}$ is the circumferential or hoop stress.\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation for an elastic material can be shown to have the form:\n$$\n\\sigma_{r}(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(r) = A + \\frac{B}{2r^3}\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.

Stress is defined as positive for tension, so the compressive effect of pressure corresponds to a negative stress.\n1.  At the inner radius $r=a$: $\\sigma_{r}(a) = -p_{i}$\n2.  At the outer radius $r=b$: $\\sigma_{r}(b) = -p_{o}$\n\nApplying these conditions to the equation for $\\sigma_{r}(r)$:\n1.  $-p_{i} = A - \\frac{B}{a^3}$\n2.  $-p_{o} = A - \\frac{B}{b^3}$\n\nWe solve this system of two linear equations for $A$ and $B$.

We use the given approximation $p_{o} \\approx 0$. Setting $p_{o}=0$, the constant expressions simplify to:\n$$\nA = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\frac{p_{i}a^3 b^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\nThe hoop stress $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(r) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} + \\frac{p_{i}a^3 b^3}{2(b^3 - a^3)r^3} = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2r^3}\\right)\n$$\nTo determine how $\\sigma_{t}$ varies with the radius $r$, we examine its derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{t}}{dr} = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left( \\frac{b^3}{2} \\right) \\left( -3r^{-4} \\right) = -\\frac{3 p_{i}a^3 b^3}{2(b^3 - a^3)r^4}\n$$\nGiven that $p_{i}>0$, $b>a>0$, and $r>0$, every term in this expression is positive except for the leading negative sign. Thus, $\\frac{d\\sigma_{t}}{dr} < 0$ for all $r \\in [a, b]$. This signifies that $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the radius $r$.\n\nConsequently, the maximum hoop stress occurs at the minimum radius, $r=a$ (the endocardial side), and the minimum hoop stress occurs at the maximum radius, $r=b$ (the epicardial side).\nFrom a biomechanical and histological perspective, mechanical stress is a potent stimulus for tissue growth and remodeling (a concept often generalized as Wolff's Law). The region of a structure bearing the highest load must be the most robust. Since the tensile hoop stress is greatest at the inner wall and decreases progressively towards the outer wall, the majority of the wall's structural material is required near the inside. This rationalizes the observation that the myocardium, the thick contractile muscle layer, constitutes the bulk of the heart wall's thickness. The endocardium (inner lining) and epicardium (outer covering) are thin layers whose primary functions are not load-bearing, whereas the thick myocardium is optimally placed to bear the high stresses generated by blood pressure.\n\nFinally, we quantify the stress gradient by computing the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{t}(a)}{\\sigma_{t}(b)}$. Using the simplified expression for $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ with $p_{o}=0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(a) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(b) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2b^3}\\right) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right)}{\\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}}{\\frac{3}{2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{b^3}{3a^3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^3\\right)\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values $a=1.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $b=3.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$. The ratio of the radii is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = 2\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2 + 2^3\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}(2 + 8) = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nThis is the final exact value for the ratio.",

This result highlights that diffusion is a relatively slow process for supplying oxygen over the scale of the subendocardial thickness. The subendocardium is the most distal region relative to the epicardial coronary arteries and is subjected to high intramyocardial pressure during systole, which impedes blood flow. During periods of reduced perfusion (e.g., due to coronary artery disease or tachycardia), the oxygen supply to the subendocardium becomes critically limited. The relatively long diffusion time demonstrates that if perfusion through local capillaries is compromised, diffusion from the ventricular lumen or more distant patent vessels cannot adequately compensate for the high metabolic demand of the cardiomyocytes in this region, thus explaining its particular vulnerability to ischemia compared to the better-perfused myocardium and epicardium.",
