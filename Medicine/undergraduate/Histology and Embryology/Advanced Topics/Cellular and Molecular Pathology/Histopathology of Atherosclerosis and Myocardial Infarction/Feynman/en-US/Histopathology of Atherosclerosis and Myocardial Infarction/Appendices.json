            "problem": "A mechanobiology-based description of adaptive intimal remodeling identifies circumferential (hoop) stress as a primary stimulus for non-atherosclerotic intimal thickening, in which intimal smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix accumulate to reduce wall stress. For a thin-walled cylindrical vessel, the circumferential stress is given by Laplace’s law, where stress increases with internal pressure and radius, and decreases with wall thickness. Consider the proximal ascending aorta and a proximal epicardial coronary artery in an adult at steady mean arterial pressure. Assume the same transmural pressure $P$ acts on both vessels. The proximal ascending aorta has radius $r_{a} = 12\\,\\text{mm}$ and wall thickness $t_{a} = 2.5\\,\\text{mm}$. The proximal coronary artery has radius $r_{c} = 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$ and wall thickness $t_{c} = 0.4\\,\\text{mm}$. Using Laplace’s law for thin-walled cylinders,\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P\\,r}{2\\,t},$$\ncompute the ratio of circumferential wall stress in the aorta to that in the coronary artery, namely $\\sigma_{a}/\\sigma_{c}$. Round your final ratio to four significant figures and express it as a pure number with no units. Then, based on this comparison and the mechanistic role of wall stress in triggering adaptive intimal thickening, infer which vessel segment is more predisposed to adaptive intimal thickening and briefly justify why in your reasoning.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratio of circumferential wall stress between the proximal ascending aorta and a proximal epicardial coronary artery, followed by an inference regarding the predisposition to adaptive intimal thickening based on a provided mechanobiological principle.\n\nFirst, we establish the expressions for the circumferential stress in each vessel using the provided formula based on Laplace's law for thin-walled cylinders, which is given as:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{P\\,r}{2\\,t} $$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the circumferential stress, $P$ is the transmural pressure, $r$ is the vessel radius, and $t$ is the wall thickness. It is pertinent to note that the standard formula for circumferential (hoop) stress in a thin-walled cylinder is $\\sigma = \\frac{P\\,r}{t}$, while the given formula $\\sigma = \\frac{P\\,r}{2\\,t}$ corresponds to the stress in a thin-walled sphere or the axial stress in a cylinder. However, the problem explicitly instructs the use of this specific formula. As we will see, the factor of $2$ cancels when computing the ratio, so the choice of formula does not affect the final numerical outcome of the ratio.\n\nLet the subscript $a$ denote the aorta and $c$ denote the coronary artery. The given parameters are:\nFor the aorta: radius $r_{a} = 12\\,\\text{mm}$ and wall thickness $t_{a} = 2.5\\,\\text{mm}$.\nFor the coronary artery: radius $r_{c} = 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$ and wall thickness $t_{c} = 0.4\\,\\text{mm}$.\nThe transmural pressure $P$ is assumed to be the same for both vessels.\n\nThe circumferential stress in the aorta, $\\sigma_{a}$, is:\n$$ \\sigma_{a} = \\frac{P\\,r_{a}}{2\\,t_{a}} $$\nThe circumferential stress in the coronary artery, $\\sigma_{c}$, is:\n$$ \\sigma_{c} = \\frac{P\\,r_{c}}{2\\,t_{c}} $$\n\nWe are tasked with computing the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}}$. We can write this as:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = \\frac{\\frac{P\\,r_{a}}{2\\,t_{a}}}{\\frac{P\\,r_{c}}{2\\,t_{c}}} $$\nThe common terms $P$ and $2$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = \\frac{r_{a}}{t_{a}} \\cdot \\frac{t_{c}}{r_{c}} = \\frac{r_{a}t_{c}}{t_{a}r_{c}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the simplified expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = \\frac{(12\\,\\text{mm})(0.4\\,\\text{mm})}{(2.5\\,\\text{mm})(1.5\\,\\text{mm})} $$\nNote that the units ($\\text{mm}$) cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless ratio as required.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = \\frac{12 \\times 0.4}{2.5 \\times 1.5} = \\frac{4.8}{3.75} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = 1.28 $$\nThe problem requires the final ratio to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $1.28$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $1.280$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to infer which vessel is more predisposed to adaptive intimal thickening. The problem states that \"circumferential (hoop) stress as a primary stimulus for non-atherosclerotic intimal thickening, in which intimal smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix accumulate to reduce wall stress.\"\nOur calculation has shown that:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{\\sigma_{c}} = 1.280 $$\nThis implies that $\\sigma_{a} = 1.280 \\times \\sigma_{c}$, meaning the circumferential wall stress in the aorta is $28\\%$ higher than in the coronary artery under the given conditions.\nAccording to the provided mechanobiological principle, higher wall stress is the stimulus for adaptive intimal thickening. Therefore, the vessel segment with the higher stress is more predisposed to this remodeling process.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the proximal ascending aorta, which experiences a greater circumferential wall stress, is more predisposed to adaptive intimal thickening than the proximal epicardial coronary artery. The justification is that the stimulus for the thickening, as defined by the problem, is the magnitude of the circumferential stress, which is demonstrably greater in the aorta.",
