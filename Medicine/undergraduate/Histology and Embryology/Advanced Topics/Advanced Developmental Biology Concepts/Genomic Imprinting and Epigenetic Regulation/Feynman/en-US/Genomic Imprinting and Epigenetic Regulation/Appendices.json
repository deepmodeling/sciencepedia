Consider a germline DMR during oocyte growth where de novo DNA methylation is catalyzed by De novo DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, and demethylation is negligible over the relevant time scale. Assume a very large population of equivalent cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within the DMR that are initially unmethylated and behave independently.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** A population of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within a germline differentially methylated region (DMR).\n- **Process:** Irreversible de novo DNA methylation, where unmethylated sites become methylated.\n- **Initial Condition:** At time $t=0$, all CpG sites are unmethylated.\n- **Rate Law:** The process follows first-order kinetics with a constant hazard (per-site rate) $k$ per unit time.\n- **Assumptions:**\n    1. The population of CpG sites is very large and all sites are equivalent.\n    2. Sites behave independently.\n    3. Demethylation (the reverse reaction) is negligible.\n- **Objective:** Derive a closed-form analytic expression for $M(t)$, the fraction of CpG sites that are methylated, as a function of $k$ and $t$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a simplified but mechanistically valid model of enzymatic kinetics applied to DNA methylation. The assumption of an irreversible first-order reaction is a standard and appropriate model for many biological processes where the substrate concentration (unmethylated sites) is the limiting factor and enzyme activity is constant. This is a classical problem in chemical kinetics and biophysics. The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial condition ($M(0)=0$) and defines the rate of change through a constant hazard, which allows for the formulation and solution of a differential equation. The information is sufficient to find a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms without subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe process described is an irreversible first-order reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Unmethylated Site} \\xrightarrow{k} \\text{Methylated Site}\n$$\nLet $U(t)$ be the fraction of CpG sites that are unmethylated at time $t$, and let $M(t)$ be the fraction of sites that are methylated at time $t$. Since each site can only be in one of these two states, the sum of the fractions must be unity:\n$$\nU(t) + M(t) = 1\n$$\nThe problem states that the methylation process has a constant hazard $k$. This means that the rate of decrease of the unmethylated fraction is directly proportional to the currently available unmethylated fraction. This relationship can be expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dU(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot U(t)\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the fraction of unmethylated sites decreases over time.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we use the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{U} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The integration on the left side is from the initial fraction of unmethylated sites, $U(0)$, to the fraction at time $t$, $U(t)$. The integration on the right side is from the initial time, $t=0$, to time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{U(0)}^{U(t)} \\frac{1}{U'} dU' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe problem states that initially all sites are unmethylated. Therefore, the initial condition is $U(0) = 1$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{U(t)} \\frac{1}{U'} dU' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln(U')]_{1}^{U(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(U(t)) - \\ln(1) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(U(t)) = -kt\n$$\nTo find $U(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of CpG sites that remain unmethylated at time $t$. The problem, however, asks for the fraction of sites that are methylated, $M(t)$. Using the conservation relationship $U(t) + M(t) = 1$, we can solve for $M(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = 1 - U(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $U(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the fraction of methylated CpG sites as a function of the rate constant $k$ and time $t$.\nA check of the boundary conditions confirms the validity of the result. At $t=0$, $M(0) = 1 - \\exp(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$, which correctly reflects the initial state of no methylation. As $t \\to \\infty$, $M(t) \\to 1 - 0 = 1$, which correctly reflects that all sites will eventually become methylated in this irreversible process.",

The objective is to calculate a specific quantity, the expected value of a fraction, for which a unique solution can be derived.\n    *   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, unbiased scientific language.\n\n3.  **Verdict and Action:** The problem is valid. We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nLet us consider a single CpG site that is methylated at the beginning, before any divisions (at an abstract time $t=0$). We want to calculate the probability that this site has lost its methylation by the end of the $n$-th division.\n\nLet $M_k$ be the event that the site is still methylated after $k$ divisions.\nLet $U_k$ be the event that the site is unmethylated after $k$ divisions.\n\nThe initial condition is that the site is methylated, so the probability of it being methylated at $k=0$ is $1$:\n$$P(M_0) = 1$$\n\nThe problem states that the per-division failure probability is $e$. This is the probability of a transition from a methylated state to an unmethylated state during one division. Therefore, the probability of successfully maintaining methylation through one division is the complement, $1-e$.\nGiven that a site is methylated before a division (at step $k-1$), the probabilities for its state after the division (at step $k$) are:\n-   Probability of losing methylation: $P(U_k | M_{k-1}) = e$\n-   Probability of maintaining methylation: $P(M_k | M_{k-1}) = 1-e$\n\nThe problem specifies that the unmethylated state is absorbing. If a site is unmethylated, it remains unmethylated in all subsequent divisions:\n$$P(U_k | U_{k-1}) = 1$$\n\nWe are interested in the fraction of sites that have lost methylation at least once by the end of division $n$. Due to the absorbing nature of the unmethylated state, a site having lost methylation \"at least once\" is equivalent to the site being in an unmethylated state after the $n$-th division. Thus, we need to calculate $P(U_n)$.\n\nThe events $M_n$ and $U_n$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Therefore, their probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$P(U_n) + P(M_n) = 1$$\nThis allows us to find $P(U_n)$ by first calculating $P(M_n)$, the probability that the site remains methylated after $n$ divisions.\n$$P(U_n) = 1 - P(M_n)$$\n\nFor a site to be methylated after $n$ divisions ($M_n$), it must have successfully maintained its methylation through all $n$ consecutive divisions. Since the process for each division is independent, the probability of this sequence of events is the product of the individual probabilities for each division.\n\nThe probability of remaining methylated after the first division is:\n$$P(M_1) = P(M_1 | M_0) P(M_0) = (1-e) \\times 1 = 1-e$$\n\nThe probability of remaining methylated after the second division is:\n$$P(M_2) = P(M_2 | M_1) P(M_1) = (1-e) \\times (1-e) = (1-e)^2$$\n\nBy induction, the probability of a site remaining continuously methylated after $n$ divisions is:\n$$P(M_n) = (1-e)^n$$\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a single site has lost its methylation by the end of division $n$:\n$$P(U_n) = 1 - P(M_n) = 1 - (1-e)^n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected fraction* of sites that have lost methylation. Consider a large population of $N$ such CpG sites, all behaving independently and identically according to the probabilities derived above. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th site ($i=1, \\dots, N$), such that $X_i=1$ if the site has lost methylation after $n$ divisions, and $X_i=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe probability of $X_i=1$ is $P(U_n)$, which we found to be $1 - (1-e)^n$.\nThe expected value of this indicator variable is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = 1 - (1-e)^n$$\n\nThe fraction of sites that have lost methylation is the random variable $F_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\nThe expected fraction is the expected value of $F_n$. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[F_n] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince all sites are identical, $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$.\n$$E[F_n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (1 - (1-e)^n) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot N \\cdot (1 - (1-e)^n) = 1 - (1-e)^n$$\n\nThus, the expected fraction of sites that have lost methylation is equal to the probability of a single site losing methylation. This is a direct consequence of the Law of Large Numbers. The final result is a closed-form analytic expression solely in terms of $e$ and $n$.",

            "problem": "A single imprinted autosomal locus contains a gene, denoted $G$, that is normally expressed only from the paternally derived allele in somatic tissues, while the maternally derived allele is silenced by cytosine methylation marks acquired during oogenesis. An upstream imprinting center (IC) controls the parent-of-origin-specific methylation state. A heterozygous microdeletion in the imprinting center (denote the deleted allele as $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$) abolishes proper imprint establishment on that chromosome in the carrier’s germline, such that when transmitted through spermatogenesis the $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$ allele remains in a non-expressing, maternal-like state and cannot activate $G$. Assume proper imprint erasure and resetting in all gametes, no trans-allelic rescue, and no effects in trans on the homologous chromosome.\n\nConsider an unaffected father and an unaffected mother.

The father is phenotypically unaffected; if he is a heterozygous carrier, his $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$ allele must reside on his maternally derived chromosome in his soma, leaving his paternally derived allele active. Because the locus is autosomal, Mendelian segregation applies. For any child of a heterozygous carrier father, each conception independently receives the paternal $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$ allele with probability $1/2$, in which case the child’s paternally derived allele fails to express $G$ while the maternally derived allele is physiologically silenced, leading to disease.

The scenario described is a classic example of genomic imprinting and its inheritance, making it a valid problem in genetics and probability theory.\n\nThis problem requires the use of Bayesian inference to update our belief about the father's genetic status based on the phenotypes of his first two children. We will then use this updated belief to predict the probability of the third child being affected.\n\nLet $H_C$ be the hypothesis that the father is a heterozygous carrier of the imprinting center microdeletion ($\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$).\nLet $H_N$ be the hypothesis that the father is not a carrier.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the prior probabilities for these hypotheses are:\n$P(H_C) = p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$P(H_N) = 1 - p = 1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.9999$\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a child is affected with the imprinting disorder, and $U$ be the event that a child is unaffected. We need to determine the conditional probabilities of these events given the father's status.\n\nThe problem states: \"for any child of a heterozygous carrier father, each conception independently receives the paternal $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$ allele with probability $1/2$, in which case the child’s paternally derived allele fails to express $G$... leading to disease.\" This phrasing defines the risk for a child of a carrier father.\nIt also states: \"If the father is not a carrier, disease can still arise in a child due to a rare de novo epimutation... with probability $\\mu$\". This phrasing establishes a separate, mutually exclusive cause of the disease. Therefore, we model the problem as follows:\n\nIf the father is a carrier ($H_C$ is true):\nThe child is affected if and only if they inherit the $\\mathrm{IC}\\Delta$ allele.\nThe probability of a child being affected is $P(A|H_C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of a child being unaffected is $P(U|H_C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIf the father is not a carrier ($H_N$ is true):\nThe child is affected only if a de novo epimutation occurs.\nThe probability of a child being affected is $P(A|H_N) = \\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nThe probability of a child being unaffected is $P(U|H_N) = 1 - \\mu$.\n\nLet $E$ be the evidence provided: the first child was affected ($A_1$) and the second child was unaffected ($U_2$). Since each conception is an independent event, the probability of this specific evidence, conditional on the father's status, is:\n$P(E|H_C) = P(A_1|H_C) \\times P(U_2|H_C) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$P(E|H_N) = P(A_1|H_N) \\times P(U_2|H_N) = \\mu \\times (1 - \\mu)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the father is a carrier, given the evidence $E$. Let this be $P(H_C|E)$.\n$P(H_C|E) = \\frac{P(E|H_C)P(H_C)}{P(E)}$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of the evidence, calculated using the law of total probability:\n$P(E) = P(E|H_C)P(H_C) + P(E|H_N)P(H_N)$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(H_C|E)$:\n$P(H_C|E) = \\frac{P(E|H_C)p}{P(E|H_C)p + P(E|H_N)(1-p)}$\n$P(H_C|E) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}p}{\\frac{1}{4}p + \\mu(1-\\mu)(1-p)}$\n\nNow we want to find the probability that the third child will be affected, $P(A_3|E)$. We again use the law of total probability, conditioning on the hypotheses $H_C$ and $H_N$, but using their posterior probabilities:\n$P(A_3|E) = P(A_3|H_C, E)P(H_C|E) + P(A_3|H_N, E)P(H_N|E)$\nGiven the father's status ($H_C$ or $H_N$), the outcome of the third child is independent of the outcomes of the first two children. Therefore, $P(A_3|H_C, E) = P(A_3|H_C) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(A_3|H_N, E) = P(A_3|H_N) = \\mu$.

The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth.\n$0.3571571069 \\approx 0.3572$\n\nThus, the probability that the third child will be affected is approximately $0.3572$.",
