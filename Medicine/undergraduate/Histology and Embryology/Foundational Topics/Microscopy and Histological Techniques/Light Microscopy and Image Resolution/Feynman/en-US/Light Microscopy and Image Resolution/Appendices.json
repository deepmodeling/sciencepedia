            "problem": "In a histology imaging setup using light microscopy, consider a high-angle objective that collects rays within a specimen-side half-angle of $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$. The objective is first operated in air and then with immersion oil matched to the cover glass. Use only core optics principles—Snell’s law and the definition of refractive index—to explain how the acceptance of high-angle rays depends on the medium in which the specimen is situated. Starting from those principles, derive the dependence of the objective’s Numerical Aperture (NA) on the specimen-side half-angle and refractive index, where Numerical Aperture (NA) is the dimensionless quantity characterizing angular acceptance at the specimen. Then, for a specimen medium of air with refractive index $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$ and immersion oil with refractive index $n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$ (both at a central green wavelength used in histology), compute the values of $\\mathrm{NA}$ in air and in oil for the given half-angle $\\theta$, and quantify the fractional increase in $\\mathrm{NA}$ when switching from air to oil, defined as\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} - \\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}.$$\nUse degrees for all angles.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. The premises are scientifically sound and consistent with established principles of optics and microscopy. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe primary task is to explain the role of the immersion medium in collecting high-angle rays, derive the expression for Numerical Aperture ($\\mathrm{NA}$), and compute the $\\mathrm{NA}$ for air and oil immersions, along with the fractional increase.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Specimen-side half-angle of acceptance: $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$\n- Refractive index of air: $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$\n- Refractive index of immersion oil: $n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$\n\nThe quantities to be computed are:\n1.  $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}$\n2.  $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}}$\n3.  The fractional increase, defined as $\\frac{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} - \\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}$\n\nEach numerical result must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Part 1: Explanation of High-Angle Ray Acceptance**\n\nThe acceptance of high-angle rays by a microscope objective is governed by Snell's law of refraction, which describes how light bends when it passes from a medium with refractive index $n_1$ to a medium with refractive index $n_2$. The law is stated as:\n$$n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$$\nwhere $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of the ray with respect to the normal of the interface in their respective media.\n\nIn a typical histology setup, light emanates from a specimen mounted on a glass slide and covered by a glass coverslip. Let the refractive index of the glass be $n_{\\text{glass}}$. Light rays from the specimen must pass through the coverslip and the medium between the coverslip and the objective's front lens.\n\nCase 1: Air Medium (Dry Objective)\nThe light ray travels from the glass coverslip ($n_1 = n_{\\text{glass}}$) into air ($n_2 = n_{\\text{air}}$). Since $n_{\\text{glass}} > n_{\\text{air}}$, the ray will bend away from the normal upon entering the air. According to Snell's law, $\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin(\\theta_1)$. A physical ray cannot have an angle of refraction $\\theta_2 > 90^{\\circ}$, which implies $\\sin(\\theta_2) \\le 1$. This sets a limit on the incident angle $\\theta_1$. If the angle of incidence in the glass exceeds a certain critical angle, $\\theta_c$, the ray will not be refracted into the air but will instead undergo total internal reflection (TIR). This critical angle is found by setting $\\theta_2 = 90^{\\circ}$:\n$$n_{\\text{glass}} \\sin(\\theta_c) = n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = n_{\\text{air}}$$\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{glass}}}\\right)$$\nUsing the fact that immersion oil is matched to the glass, we can approximate $n_{\\text{glass}} \\approx n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$. The critical angle at the glass-air interface is thus:\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1.000}{1.515}\\right) \\approx \\arcsin(0.6590) \\approx 41.22^{\\circ}$$\nAny ray approaching the coverslip-air interface from within the glass at an angle greater than approximately $41.22^{\\circ}$ is lost and cannot be collected by the objective. This severely limits the effective cone of light that a dry objective can accept.\n\nCase 2: Oil Immersion\nWhen immersion oil is used, the medium between the coverslip and the objective lens has a refractive index $n_{\\text{oil}}$ that is deliberately chosen to be very close to that of the glass ($n_{\\text{oil}} \\approx n_{\\text{glass}}$). In this case, $n_1 \\approx n_2$, and Snell's law ($n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$) implies that $\\sin(\\theta_1) \\approx \\sin(\\theta_2)$, so $\\theta_1 \\approx \\theta_2$. The light rays pass from the glass into the oil essentially without deviation. There is no critical angle, and total internal reflection does not occur at this interface. Consequently, high-angle rays that would have been lost in the air-gap system can now enter the objective. This is how oil immersion enables the acceptance of a much wider cone of light from the specimen.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Numerical Aperture (NA) Dependence**\n\nThe Numerical Aperture ($\\mathrm{NA}$) is defined as the quantity that characterizes the range of angles over which an objective can accept light. As established by Snell's law, for a ray crossing a series of parallel interfaces (e.g., from specimen medium to coverslip to immersion medium to front lens), the quantity $n \\sin(\\theta)$ is an optical invariant.\n$$n_{\\text{specimen}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{specimen}}) = n_{\\text{coverslip}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{coverslip}}) = n_{\\text{medium}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{medium}}) = n_{\\text{lens}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{lens}})$$\nThe objective's physical construction (the diameter of its entrance pupil and its focal length) imposes a maximum angle for a ray within its internal lens system. This, in turn, dictates the maximum value of the invariant $n \\sin(\\theta)$ that the entire system can handle. The light-gathering power and the ultimate resolution of the microscope are directly proportional to this invariant. It is therefore logical to define this quantity, as measured in the specimen-side medium, as the Numerical Aperture.\n\nThe dependence is thus established: let $n$ be the refractive index of the medium between the specimen/coverslip and the objective, and let $\\theta$ be the half-angle of the maximum cone of light accepted by the objective from a point on the optical axis. The Numerical Aperture is defined as:\n$$\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin(\\theta)$$\nThis definition encapsulates the combined effect of the medium's refractive index and the objective's angular acceptance on its light-gathering and resolving power.\n\n**Part 3: Computations**\n\nWe are given $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$, $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$, and $n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$.\n\n1.  **Numerical Aperture in Air ($\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}$)**\n    Using the derived formula:\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} = n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta) = 1.000 \\times \\sin(70^{\\circ})$$\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} \\approx 1.000 \\times 0.93969262...$$\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} \\approx 0.93969262...$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} = 0.9397$.\n\n2.  **Numerical Aperture in Oil ($\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}}$)**\n    Similarly, for the oil immersion case:\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} = n_{\\text{oil}} \\sin(\\theta) = 1.515 \\times \\sin(70^{\\circ})$$\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} \\approx 1.515 \\times 0.93969262...$$\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} \\approx 1.423533...$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} = 1.424$. It is important to note that an objective must be specifically designed for a given immersion medium. We assume here that the objective's mechanical and optical design can physically accommodate a $70^{\\circ}$ half-angle in both media. The value $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} \\approx 0.940$ is at the practical limit for dry objectives, while $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} \\approx 1.42$ is a typical value for a high-performance oil-immersion objective.\n\n3.  **Fractional Increase in NA**\n    The fractional increase is defined as:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} - \\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}$$\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\mathrm{NA}$:\n    $$\\frac{n_{\\text{oil}}\\sin(\\theta) - n_{\\text{air}}\\sin(\\theta)}{n_{\\text{air}}\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{(n_{\\text{oil}} - n_{\\text{air}})\\sin(\\theta)}{n_{\\text{air}}\\sin(\\theta)}$$\n    Since $\\sin(70^{\\circ}) \\neq 0$, it cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n    $$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{n_{\\text{oil}} - n_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{air}}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{1.515 - 1.000}{1.000} = \\frac{0.515}{1.000} = 0.515$$\n    As a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.5150$.\n\nThe three requested quantities are $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}$, $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}}$, and the fractional increase.",

Round your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main parts: (1) derivation of the lateral resolution based on diffraction theory, (2) calculation of the effective sampling interval at the specimen plane, and (3) evaluation of sampling adequacy using the defined factor $S$.\n\n**1. Lateral Resolution ($d$)**\n\nThe theoretical limit of resolution in a microscope is imposed by the diffraction of light. A point source in the specimen plane is not imaged as a perfect point but as a diffraction pattern known as the Airy disk, which consists of a central bright spot surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The problem directs us to start from diffraction by a circular aperture, which is the physical basis of the Airy pattern.\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable when the center of the Airy disk of one source is directly over the first minimum (the first dark ring) of the Airy disk of the other. The lateral distance from the center of the Airy disk to its first minimum defines the lateral resolution, $d$.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the angular position $\\theta$ of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta) = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda'}{D} $$\nwhere $\\lambda'$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture. In microscopy, the objective's front lens acts as the aperture. The numerical aperture ($NA$) of the objective is defined as $NA = n \\sin(\\alpha)$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the immersion medium and $\\alpha$ is the half-angle of the cone of light accepted by the objective. The resolution is determined in the object space, where the wavelength is $\\lambda_m = \\lambda/n$ (assuming $\\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength). A rigorous derivation in Fourier optics shows that the lateral resolution $d$ can be expressed directly in terms of the vacuum wavelength $\\lambda$ and the numerical aperture $NA$:\n$$ d = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{NA} $$\nThis is the standard formula for lateral resolution based on the Rayleigh criterion.\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\lambda = 520\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$NA = 1.40$\n\nThe expected lateral resolution is:\n$$ d = \\frac{0.61 \\times 520\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1.40} = \\frac{317.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1.40} \\approx 226.5714\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nWe will retain this value for subsequent calculations. The target vesicle, with a diameter $w = 250\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, is larger than this resolution limit, implying it can be resolved as an extended object rather than just a diffraction-limited spot.\n\n**2. Effective Sampling Interval ($p_{\\text{eff}}$)**\n\nThe camera sensor consists of a grid of pixels. To determine the sampling interval in the context of the specimen, we must project the camera pixel size back through the microscope's magnification to the specimen plane. The effective pixel size at the specimen plane, $p_{\\text{eff}}$, is the camera pixel size, $p_{\\text{cam}}$, divided by the total magnification, $M$.\n\nFirst, we convert the camera pixel size to nanometers for consistency:\n$p_{\\text{cam}} = 6.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 6.5 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 6500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$p_{\\text{cam}} = 6500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$M = 60$\n\nThe effective sampling interval at the specimen plane is:\n$$ p_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{cam}}}{M} = \\frac{6500\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{60} \\approx 108.3333\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n\n**3. Nyquist Sampling Adequacy Factor ($S$)**\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem requires that, to accurately represent a signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal. In spatial terms, this means the sampling interval must be at most half the period of the finest detail to be captured. The finest resolvable detail is on the order of the resolution limit, $d$. A common criterion for adequate sampling is that the effective pixel size, $p_{\\text{eff}}$, should be at most half the resolution limit: $p_{\\text{eff}} \\le d/2$.\n\nThe problem defines a specific dimensionless Nyquist sampling adequacy factor, $S$, as the ratio of the expected lateral resolution to twice the effective specimen-plane pixel size.\n$$ S = \\frac{d}{2 p_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nThis factor directly evaluates the sampling criterion. If $S \\ge 1$, then $d \\ge 2 p_{\\text{eff}}$, or $p_{\\text{eff}} \\le d/2$, and the sampling is considered adequate (or better) according to the Nyquist criterion.\n\nUsing the calculated values for $d$ and $p_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ S = \\frac{226.5714\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2 \\times 108.3333\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{226.5714}{216.6666} \\approx 1.045714 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ S \\approx 1.05 $$\nSince $S > 1$, the sampling is adequate to capture the diffraction-limited details provided by this objective and wavelength combination.",
