This process begins with the reversible binding of adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, on adjacent cells. To move from a qualitative description to a quantitative model, we can use concepts from physical chemistry, like the dissociation constant ($K_d$), to describe binding affinity. This exercise  will guide you in deriving and applying the fundamental relationship between ligand concentration, binding affinity, and the fraction of engaged receptors, providing a quantitative basis for understanding the strength of cell-cell adhesion.",

            "problem": "Epithelial adherens junctions rely on the trans interaction of E-cadherin molecules across adjacent cells. Consider a simplified, scientifically realistic model in which each E-cadherin binding site on cell A engages in a one-to-one ($1{:}1$) reversible binding interaction with an E-cadherin binding partner on cell B across the intercellular cleft. Assume the interface can be modeled as a well-mixed compartment in which the opposing cell’s available E-cadherin binding sites constitute an effective ligand pool of concentration $[L]$. The binding reaction is $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$, where $R$ denotes an unbound cadherin site on cell A, $L$ denotes a binding-competent cadherin on cell B, and $RL$ denotes the trans bond. The apparent dissociation constant is $K_d = 50$ nM, reflecting the effective affinity under junctional confinement. The ligand concentration is $[L] = 200$ nM.\n\nStarting only from the definition of the dissociation constant and the definition of fractional occupancy, derive an expression for the fraction $f$ of E-cadherin sites on cell A engaged in trans binding at equilibrium, and then evaluate $f$ for $K_d = 50$ nM and $[L] = 200$ nM. State any minimal assumptions you use and ensure they are consistent with the biological setting. Express the final fraction as a decimal number without units.

            "introduction": "Beyond simply holding cells together, junctions perform critical physiological roles. Tight junctions, for example, create a selective barrier in epithelial tissues, regulating the passage of ions and solutes through the paracellular space. This barrier function can be measured electrically as Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER). This practice  illustrates how the principles of simple electrical circuits can model this biological system, allowing you to predict how changes in the abundance of a specific molecular component—the pore-forming protein claudin-2—directly impact a vital tissue-level property.",

Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) is measured across the monolayer as a lumped property arising from two independent pathways from the apical to basolateral compartment: a transcellular path through the apical and basolateral membranes, and a paracellular path through tight junction pores. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) Ohm’s law, where current equals voltage divided by resistance, applies to each pathway; (ii) independent parallel pathways add as conductances; and (iii) for claudin-2 pores, the paracellular resistance scales inversely with the number of open channels, so that $R_{\\mathrm{para}} \\propto 1/N$, where $N$ is the number of paracellular channels.\n\nAt baseline, the measured TEER is $R_{\\mathrm{tot},0} = 500\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and the transcellular resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem describes the total transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as arising from two independent pathways, the transcellular and paracellular pathways, which act as parallel electrical elements. According to the provided foundational fact (ii), independent parallel pathways add as conductances. Conductance, $G$, is the reciprocal of resistance, $R$, such that $G = 1/R$. Therefore, the total conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the transcellular conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, and the paracellular conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{para}}$.\n\n$$G_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_{\\mathrm{trans}} + G_{\\mathrm{para}}$$\n\nIn terms of resistance, this relationship is expressed as:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{trans}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{para}}}$$\n\nWe are given the baseline total resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{tot},0} = 500\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and the constant transcellular resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

The fractional decrease, $D_f$, is defined as the change in resistance divided by the initial resistance:\n\n$$D_f = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot},0} - R_{\\mathrm{tot},1}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot},0}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for the initial and final total resistances:\n\n$$D_f = \\frac{500\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2} - \\frac{2000}{7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{500\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n\n$$D_f = 1 - \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot},1}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot},0}} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{2000}{7}}{500} = 1 - \\frac{2000}{7 \\times 500} = 1 - \\frac{4}{7}$$\n\n$$D_f = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we compute the value of $3/7$:\n\n$$D_f = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4285714...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.4286$.",
