A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation of the resting membrane potential, $V_m$, begins with the Nernst-Planck equation for the flux of an ionic species $i$ across a membrane of thickness $L$:\n$$J_{i} = -D_{i}\\left(\\frac{dC_{i}}{dx} + \\frac{z_{i}F}{RT}\\,C_{i}\\,\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)$$\nUnder the constant-field approximation, the electric field $E = -d\\phi/dx$ is constant. Across the membrane from inside ($x=0$) to outside ($x=L$), the potential changes linearly. We define the membrane potential as $V_m = \\phi_{in} - \\phi_{out} = \\phi(0) - \\phi(L)$. Thus, the electric field is $E = - ( \\phi(L) - \\phi(0) ) / L = (\\phi(0) - \\phi(L)) / L = V_m/L$. This implies $d\\phi/dx = -V_m/L$, which is not quite right. Conventionally, we set $\\phi(0) = V_m$ and $\\phi(L) = 0$, so $d\\phi/dx = (\\phi(L) - \\phi(0)) / L = -V_m/L$. Let's use this. The Nernst-Planck equation becomes:\n$$J_{i} = -D_{i}\\left(\\frac{dC_{i}}{dx} - \\frac{z_{i}F V_m}{RTL}\\,C_{i}\\right)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $C_i(x)$. At steady state, $J_i$ is constant. Rearranging the equation:\n$$\\frac{dC_{i}}{dx} - \\frac{z_{i}F V_m}{RTL}\\,C_{i} = -\\frac{J_i}{D_i}$$\nThis can be solved by integrating across the membrane from $x=0$ to $x=L$. A more direct path to the GHK flux equation is to solve for $J_i$. By rearranging, we get:\n$$J_i dx = -D_i dC_i + \\frac{D_i z_i F V_m}{RTL} C_i dx$$\nSolving this ODE for $C_i(x)$ with boundary conditions $C_i(0)=C_{i,in}$ and $C_i(L)=C_{i,out}$ and then solving for the constant flux $J_i$ yields the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation:\n$$J_{i} = -P_{i} \\frac{z_i F V_m}{RT} \\frac{C_{i,in} - C_{i,out}\\exp(-z_i F V_m / RT)}{1 - \\exp(-z_i F V_m / RT)}$$\nHere, the **permeability** $P_i$ arises from the integration and is defined as $P_i = D_i/L$. It represents the diffusion coefficient of the ion scaled by the membrane thickness.\n\nThe electric current density for species $i$ is $I_i = z_i F J_i$. The condition for the resting state is that the net current is zero: $\\sum_i I_i = 0$.\n$$I_{net} = I_K + I_{Na} + I_{Cl} = 0$$\nLet's define a dimensionless potential $\\beta = \\frac{F V_m}{RT}$. The current for each ion is:\n$I_K = -P_K \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}]_i - [\\mathrm{K}]_o \\exp(-\\beta)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta)}$ since $z_K = +1$.\n$I_{Na} = -P_{Na} \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o \\exp(-\\beta)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta)}$ since $z_{Na} = +1$.\n$I_{Cl} = -P_{Cl} \\frac{(-1)^2 F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}]_i - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o \\exp(\\beta)}{1 - \\exp(\\beta)}$ since $z_{Cl} = -1$.\n\nTo simplify the chloride term, we multiply its fractional part by $\\frac{-\\exp(-\\beta)}{-\\exp(-\\beta)}$:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}]_i - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o \\exp(\\beta)}{1 - \\exp(\\beta)} \\times \\frac{-\\exp(-\\beta)}{-\\exp(-\\beta)} = \\frac{-[\\mathrm{Cl}]_i \\exp(-\\beta) + [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o \\exp(\\beta)\\exp(-\\beta)}{-\\exp(-\\beta) + 1} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}]_o - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i \\exp(-\\beta)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta)}$$\nNow, setting $\\sum_i I_i = 0$ and assuming $V_m \\neq 0$:\n$$P_K ([\\mathrm{K}]_i - [\\mathrm{K}]_o \\exp(-\\beta)) + P_{Na} ([\\mathrm{Na}]_i - [\\mathrm{Na}]_o \\exp(-\\beta)) + P_{Cl} ([\\mathrm{Cl}]_o - [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i \\exp(-\\beta)) = 0$$\nWe group terms with and without $\\exp(-\\beta)$:\n$$P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_i + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_i + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o = (P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_o + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_o + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i) \\exp(-\\beta)$$\nSolving for $\\exp(-\\beta)$:\n$$\\exp(-\\beta) = \\frac{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_i + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_i + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o}{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_o + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_o + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm and solving for $V_m$:\n$$-\\beta = -\\frac{F V_m}{RT} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_i + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_i + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o}{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_o + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_o + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i}\\right)$$\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_o + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_o + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i}{P_K [\\mathrm{K}]_i + P_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_i + P_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o}\\right)$$\nThis is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation, which completes the first part of the task.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem provides relative baseline permeabilities $P_{\\mathrm{K}}:P_{\\mathrm{Na}}:P_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 1:0.05:0.45$. We can set a reference permeability, for instance $P_K=1$, so $P_{Na}=0.05$ and $P_{Cl}=0.45$. A vasodilatory stimulus increases $P_K$ by a factor of $3$. The new permeabilities, denoted with a prime, are:\n$P'_{K} = 3 \\times P_K = 3 \\times 1 = 3$\n$P'_{Na} = P_{Na} = 0.05$\n$P'_{Cl} = P_{Cl} = 0.45$\n\nThe given concentrations are:\n$[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{o} = 5\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} = 145\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o} = 110\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n$[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{i} = 140\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the GHK equation. Let's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the argument of the logarithm. Let the argument be $A = N/D$.\nNumerator:\n$N = P'_K [\\mathrm{K}]_o + P'_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_o + P'_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_i$\n$N = (3)(5) + (0.05)(145) + (0.45)(10) = 15 + 7.25 + 4.5 = 26.75$\n\nDenominator:\n$D = P'_K [\\mathrm{K}]_i + P'_{Na} [\\mathrm{Na}]_i + P'_{Cl} [\\mathrm{Cl}]_o$\n$D = (3)(140) + (0.05)(15) + (0.45)(110) = 420 + 0.75 + 49.5 = 470.25$\n\nThe argument of the logarithm is $A = \\frac{26.75}{470.25} \\approx 0.056885$.\n\nNow we calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$. The problem requires the final answer in millivolts ($mV$).\n$R \\approx 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$F \\approx 96485\\ \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.02671\\ \\mathrm{V} = 26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\n\nThe new resting membrane potential $V'_m$ is:\n$V'_m = \\left(\\frac{RT}{F}\\right) \\ln(A) = (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{26.75}{470.25}\\right)$\n$V'_m \\approx (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\times \\ln(0.056885)$\n$V'_m \\approx (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\times (-2.86675)$\n$V'_m \\approx -76.575\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$V'_m = -76.6\\ \\mathrm{mV}$",

A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires analyzing the effect of the combined inhibition on each contractile stimulus independently. The core of the problem is to identify the sources of activator $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ for each stimulus and determine how the inhibitors affect these sources. The inhibitors are a selective blocker of $L$-type voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels and a selective inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC).\n\n**1. Analysis of the $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-Evoked Contraction:**\nHigh extracellular potassium chloride concentration (e.g., $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$) reduces the electrochemical gradient for $\\mathrm{K^+}$ efflux across the cell membrane. As the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle cells is largely determined by $\\mathrm{K^+}$ permeability, this change leads to membrane depolarization.\n\nAccording to the provided Principle 2, \"Depolarization-induced $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx in many smooth muscles occurs primarily through $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels.\" This process is known as electromechanical coupling. The subsequent rise in $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ activates the CaM/MLCK pathway, leading to contraction.\n\nThe experimental intervention includes a selective blocker of $L$-type voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels. This agent will directly inhibit the primary pathway for $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ entry in response to KCl-induced depolarization. The PLC inhibitor is irrelevant to this mechanism. By blocking the principal source of activator $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the contraction induced by $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl will be abolished or, at minimum, nearly abolished.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Phenylephrine-Evoked Contraction:**\nPhenylephrine is an $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor agonist. According to Principle 3, these receptors couple to $\\mathrm{G_q}$ proteins, which activate PLC. PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol $4,5$-bisphosphate ($\\mathrm{PIP_2}$) into two second messengers: inositol $1,4,5$-trisphosphate ($\\mathrm{IP_3}$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). $\\mathrm{IP_3}$ binds to its receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggering the release of stored $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ into the cytosol. This is the pharmacomechanical coupling pathway and represents one major source of activator $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n\nIn many vascular smooth muscles, $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic stimulation also induces a sustained contractile phase that depends on the influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. This influx can occur through receptor-operated channels or through voltage-gated $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels that open in response to agonist-induced depolarization. Therefore, phenylephrine-induced contraction typically relies on two sources of $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$: release from the SR and influx from the extracellular space, with the latter often being crucial for the sustained component of the contraction.\n\nThe experimental intervention combines a PLC inhibitor and an $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channel blocker.\n*   The PLC inhibitor blocks the production of $\\mathrm{IP_3}$, thereby preventing $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ release from the SR.\n*   The $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channel blocker prevents $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx through these channels.\n\nBy blocking both the SR release pathway (via PLC inhibition) and the major influx pathway (via $L$-type channel blockade), the combined treatment effectively eliminates the two principal mechanisms by which phenylephrine elevates $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$. Consequently, the contraction evoked by phenylephrine will also be abolished or nearly abolished.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined pharmacologic treatment is expected to abolish (or nearly abolish) the contractile responses to both $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl and phenylephrine, as the drug combination targets the primary $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ mobilization pathways for both stimuli.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Phenylephrine-evoked contraction is nearly abolished; $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-evoked contraction is abolished.**\nThis statement aligns precisely with the derivation. The KCl-evoked contraction depends on $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels, which are blocked. The phenylephrine-evoked contraction depends on both PLC-mediated SR release and $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ influx; both pathways are blocked by the combined treatment.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Phenylephrine-evoked contraction is largely preserved due to SR release; $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-evoked contraction is abolished.**\nThe prediction for the KCl contraction is correct. However, the prediction for the phenylephrine contraction is incorrect. Contraction cannot be \"preserved due to SR release\" because the PLC inhibitor specifically blocks the production of $\\mathrm{IP_3}$, which is required for this release.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Phenylephrine-evoked contraction is abolished; $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-evoked contraction is only modestly reduced due to residual $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ entry through non-$L$-type channels.**\nThe prediction for the phenylephrine contraction is correct. However, the prediction for the KCl contraction is inconsistent with the provided Principle 2, which states that influx occurs *primarily* through $L$-type channels. Blocking the primary pathway would lead to near-abolition, not a \"modest reduction\". While minor non-$L$-type channel contributions might exist, \"abolished\" (as in option A) is a more accurate description of the effect of blocking the main pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both phenylephrine- and $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-evoked contractions are largely unaffected because MLCK can be activated independently of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-CaM under these conditions.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Principle 1 explicitly states that contraction **requires** increased $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ to activate MLCK. While $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-sensitization pathways exist (e.g., Rho-kinase inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase), they modulate the response to a given $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ level; they do not provide a $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-independent mechanism for activating MLCK. Since the inhibitors block the rise in $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, contraction must be affected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Phenylephrine-evoked contraction is reduced but persists due to DAG-mediated PKC activation; $60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ KCl-evoked contraction is unchanged because PLC is not involved in depolarization-induced responses.**\nThis statement contains two errors. First, the KCl-evoked contraction will not be \"unchanged\"; it will be abolished by the $L$-type $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channel blocker, an effect this option ignores. Second, the PLC inhibitor prevents the formation of DAG, so there can be no \"DAG-mediated PKC activation\". Furthermore, PKC-mediated sensitization would still require a permissive level of $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ to produce force, and the primary sources of $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ are blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "The level of intracellular calcium ($[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$) is the primary determinant of smooth muscle contraction, but it's not the whole story. The contractile apparatus can be \"sensitized\" or \"desensitized\" to $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, allowing for a more nuanced regulation of force. This exercise delves into the crucial concept of calcium sensitization by exploring how signaling pathways can inhibit myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), thereby increasing force at a given $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$. Understanding this modulation via enzymes like Rho-kinase (ROCK) is key to comprehending the fine-tuning of vascular tone in both health and disease. ",

            "problem": "An isolated ring of vascular smooth muscle from a small artery is mounted in an organ bath at $37\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and equilibrated in physiological saline solution under a preload that gives low basal tone. After stabilization, the tissue is exposed to a selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype $3$ ($M_3$) agonist at $1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and, simultaneously, to a Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor at a concentration titrated previously to suppress $\\ge 80\\%$ of ROCK activity. Predict the net steady-state change in active force relative to baseline and relative to $M_3$ agonist alone, and choose the best option below. Your justification should be based on first principles of smooth muscle contraction: cross-bridge cycling requires phosphorylation of the $20\\,\\text{kDa}$ myosin regulatory light chain by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in proportion to cytosolic free calcium concentration $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, and relaxation follows dephosphorylation by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Consider how $M_3$ receptor signaling and ROCK activity modulate these processes through well-established pathways, including but not limited to phospholipase C (PLC), inositol $1,4,5$-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$), diacylglycerol (DAG), protein kinase C (PKC), and MLCP regulatory subunits.\n\nWhich outcome is most consistent with these mechanisms?\n\nA. A strong contraction comparable to $M_3$ agonist alone, because $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevates MLCK activity and ROCK inhibition does not affect force.\n\nB. A contraction that is clearly smaller than with $M_3$ agonist alone but still above baseline, because $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$-dependent MLCK activation is intact while ROCK-dependent calcium sensitization via MLCP inhibition is reduced.\n\nC. A net relaxation below baseline, because ROCK inhibition removes all phosphorylation of myosin light chains despite $M_3$-induced $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevation.\n\nD. No measurable change in force relative to $M_3$ agonist alone, because $M_3$ signaling and ROCK act on distinct molecular targets with no convergence on myosin regulation.\n\nE. An initial brief contraction followed by relaxation to baseline, because $M_3$ depletes sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and ROCK inhibition prevents any sustained tone.",
            "solution": "To predict the net effect, begin from the core regulatory scheme for smooth muscle cross-bridge cycling. Active force depends on the fraction of cycling myosin heads, which is controlled by phosphorylation of the $20\\,\\text{kDa}$ myosin regulatory light chain ($\\text{MLC}_{20}$). Phosphorylation of $\\text{MLC}_{20}$ is catalyzed by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), whose activity increases with cytosolic free calcium concentration $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ via calcium-calmodulin binding. Dephosphorylation is catalyzed by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Thus, for a given time, the steady-state fraction of phosphorylated $\\text{MLC}_{20}$ (and hence force, $F$) reflects the balance between MLCK-mediated phosphorylation (which scales with $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$) and MLCP-mediated dephosphorylation (which can be modulated by signaling pathways independent of $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$).\n\nMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype $3$ ($M_3$) couples predominantly to $G_q$, activating phospholipase C (PLC). PLC generates inositol $1,4,5$-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). $\\text{IP}_3$ opens $\\text{IP}_3$ receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, raising $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ and thereby increasing MLCK activity. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which can phosphorylate CPI-17, an inhibitory protein that suppresses MLCP, thereby producing calcium sensitization (an increase in force at a given $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$). Independently, the small GTPase RhoA and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) increase calcium sensitization by phosphorylating the MLCP regulatory subunit MYPT1, decreasing MLCP activity. Therefore, with $M_3$ agonist alone, two sets of processes increase force: (i) elevated $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ activates MLCK, and (ii) MLCP is inhibited via PKC/CPI-17 and ROCK/MYPT1, both increasing the fraction of phosphorylated $\\text{MLC}_{20}$.\n\nWhen a ROCK inhibitor suppresses $\\ge 80\\%$ of ROCK activity, the ROCK-mediated inhibition of MLCP via MYPT1 phosphorylation is markedly reduced. That increases MLCP activity, lowering calcium sensitization. However, the $M_3$-induced rise in $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ and MLCK activation persists, and PKC-mediated MLCP inhibition via CPI-17 may still operate because ROCK inhibition does not block PKC directly. Consequently, the co-application produces a steady-state with less $\\text{MLC}_{20}$ phosphorylation than $M_3$ agonist alone (because MLCP is less inhibited), but more than baseline (because $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ is elevated and MLCK remains active). Thin filament regulatory effects (e.g., PKC-mediated modulation of caldesmon and calponin) can also contribute to sustained tone under $M_3$ stimulation, and these are not abolished by ROCK inhibition. Therefore, the net force is expected to be reduced compared with $M_3$ alone, yet still increased above baseline.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. A strong contraction comparable to $M_3$ agonist alone, because $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevates MLCK activity and ROCK inhibition does not affect force. Verdict: Incorrect. ROCK inhibition affects calcium sensitization by disinhibiting MLCP; the fraction of phosphorylated $\\text{MLC}_{20}$ and thus force would decrease relative to $M_3$ alone.\n\nB. A contraction that is clearly smaller than with $M_3$ agonist alone but still above baseline, because $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$-dependent MLCK activation is intact while ROCK-dependent calcium sensitization via MLCP inhibition is reduced. Verdict: Correct. This integrates the continued MLCK activation from elevated $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ with diminished MLCP inhibition when ROCK is blocked, yielding reduced sensitization and a force between baseline and $M_3$-alone.\n\nC. A net relaxation below baseline, because ROCK inhibition removes all phosphorylation of myosin light chains despite $M_3$-induced $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevation. Verdict: Incorrect. ROCK inhibition does not remove MLCK-mediated phosphorylation; $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ elevation by $M_3$ persists, so force should not drop below baseline.\n\nD. No measurable change in force relative to $M_3$ agonist alone, because $M_3$ signaling and ROCK act on distinct molecular targets with no convergence on myosin regulation. Verdict: Incorrect. Both pathways converge on MLCP/MLCK balance and thereby on $\\text{MLC}_{20}$ phosphorylation; ROCK inhibition reduces calcium sensitization.\n\nE. An initial brief contraction followed by relaxation to baseline, because $M_3$ depletes sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and ROCK inhibition prevents any sustained tone. Verdict: Incorrect. Although $\\text{IP}_3$-mediated release can be transient, sustained $M_3$ stimulation typically maintains tone through receptor-operated and store-operated calcium entry and PKC-mediated mechanisms; ROCK inhibition reduces sensitization but does not abolish all sustained pathways.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is a reduced contraction relative to $M_3$ alone, still above baseline.",
