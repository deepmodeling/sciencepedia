Its interval, $I_a$, is given by:\n$$I_a = [0, \\min(L_a, L_h)]$$\nSubstituting the values for $L_a$ and $L_h$:\n$$I_a = [0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, \\min(1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m})] = [0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}]$$\n\nThe thick filament is centered at the $M$-line and extends toward the $Z$-line. Its interval, $I_m$, is given by:\n$$I_m = [L_h - L_m, L_h]$$\nSubstituting the values for $L_h$ and $L_m$:\n$$I_m = [0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}] = [0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}]$$\n\nThe cross-bridge overlap length, $L_{ov}$, is the length (Lebesgue measure) of the intersection of these two intervals, $I_a \\cap I_m$.\n$$I_{ov} = I_a \\cap I_m = [0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}] \\cap [0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}]$$\nThe resulting intersection is:\n$$I_{ov} = [0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}]$$\nThe length of this interval is:\n$$L_{ov} = 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nNow, we compute the fractional cross-bridge overlap, $f$, which is defined as the ratio of the overlap length to the thick filament half-length, $L_m$:\n$$f = \\frac{L_{ov}}{L_m} = \\frac{0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 1$$\n\nFinally, we determine the relative active tension, $T_{\\text{rel}}$. The problem states that $T_{\\text{rel}}$ is directly proportional to $f$ ($T_{\\text{rel}} = k \\cdot f$) and is normalized such that its maximum possible value is $1$.\n\nTo find the normalization constant $k$, we must find the maximum possible value of $f$, denoted $f_{\\max}$. The fractional overlap $f$ is maximal when the overlap length $L_{ov}$ is maximal. Based on the sliding filament model described, the maximum possible overlap between a thin filament of length $L_a$ and a thick filament of half-length $L_m$ (without a bare zone) occurs when the thick filament is fully overlapped by the thin filament. This maximum overlap length, $L_{ov, \\max}$, is equal to the length of the cross-bridge bearing region of the thick filament, which is $L_m$.\n$$L_{ov, \\max} = L_m = 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nThis maximal overlap occurs for any half-sarcomere length $L_h$ such that $L_m \\le L_h \\le L_a$. In our case, $L_h=0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ falls within this range ($0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\le 0.9\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\le 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$).\n\nThe maximum fractional overlap is therefore:\n$$f_{\\max} = \\frac{L_{ov, \\max}}{L_m} = \\frac{L_m}{L_m} = 1$$\nThe normalization condition states that $\\max(T_{\\text{rel}}) = 1$. Since $T_{\\text{rel}} = k \\cdot f$, we have:\n$$\\max(T_{\\text{rel}}) = k \\cdot f_{\\max} = k \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nThis implies that the proportionality constant $k$ is $1$. Therefore, the relationship is simply $T_{\\text{rel}} = f$.\n\nFor the given sarcomere length, we calculated $f=1$. Thus, the relative active tension is:\n$$T_{\\text{rel}} = 1$$\n\nThe two dimensionless numbers requested are $f$ and $T_{\\text{rel}}$.",

It also states that \"Maximal isometric tendon force equals the specific tension multiplied by the PCSA aligned with the tendon axis\". Let's call this quantity $PCSA_{eff}$ to distinguish it from the standard definition.\nFrom standard biomechanics, the total force generated by the fibers along their own axes is $F_{fibers} = \\sigma_{spec} \\cdot PCSA_{std}$, where $PCSA_{std}$ is the total cross-sectional area of all fibers perpendicular to their long axes. The force transmitted to the tendon is the component of this force along the tendon's line of action:\n$$ F_{tendon} = F_{fibers} \\cos(\\alpha) = (\\sigma_{spec} \\cdot PCSA_{std}) \\cos(\\alpha) $$\nThe problem defines force as $F_{tendon} = \\sigma_{spec} \\cdot PCSA_{eff}$. Comparing these two expressions, we see the relationship:\n$$ PCSA_{eff} = PCSA_{std} \\cdot \\cos(\\alpha) $$\nThe standard PCSA ($PCSA_{std}$) is related to the muscle volume ($V$) and mean fiber length ($L_f$) by the approximation $V \\approx PCSA_{std} \\cdot L_f$. Thus, $PCSA_{std} = V/L_f$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $PCSA_{eff}$ and using the given formula for volume, $V = m/\\rho$, we get the formula for the PCSA requested in the problem:\n$$ \\text{PCSA} = \\frac{V}{L_f} \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{m}{\\rho L_f} \\cos(\\alpha) $$\nNow, we substitute the given values.

The distinction is fundamental. The role of nifedipine as a DHPR antagonist is well-established. The stated assumptions—negligible contribution of $Ca^{2+}$ influx to the global calcium transient and constant SR load for a single twitch—are standard simplifying assumptions in physiological modeling of this process. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary conditions to deduce a unique answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative change in peak cytosolic calcium transient amplitude and peak twitch force after the application of nifedipine under a specific set of conditions and assumptions.\n\nLet $A$ denote the peak amplitude of the cytosolic free calcium ($[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$) transient. The total calcium rise is the sum of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ($A_{SR}$) and calcium entering from the extracellular space through $Ca_v1.1$ channels ($A_{ext}$).\n$$ A = A_{SR} + A_{ext} $$\nThe problem states that extracellular calcium entry contributes negligibly to the cytosolic calcium rise. In the context of this idealized problem, \"negligible\" is interpreted to mean that its contribution can be taken as zero relative to the SR contribution.\n$$ A_{ext} \\approx 0 $$\nTherefore, the peak calcium amplitude is effectively determined solely by the release from the SR.\n$$ A \\approx A_{SR} $$\n\nExcitation-contraction coupling in adult skeletal muscle is initiated by the depolarization of the T-tubule membrane, which causes a conformational change in the DHPR ($Ca_v1.1$). This receptor functions primarily as a voltage sensor. This conformational change is transmitted mechanically to the $RyR1$ channel in the adjacent SR membrane, causing it to open and release $Ca^{2+}$ into the cytosol. This is the primary trigger for the calcium transient.\n\nThe problem states that the applied dihydropyridine antagonist \"leaves the voltage-sensor conformational change and its mechanical coupling to $RyR1$ unaltered.\" This is the crucial premise. Since the trigger for $RyR1$ opening (the mechanical signal from the DHPR) is unchanged, the opening of the $RyR1$ channels will be the same in the control condition and with the drug.\n\nFurthermore, Assumption 2 states that we ignore any changes in SR calcium content. This means the driving force for $Ca^{2+}$ flux through the opened $RyR1$ channels is also the same. Therefore, the amount of calcium released from the SR is unchanged by the drug.\n$$ A_{SR, \\text{drug}} = A_{SR, \\text{control}} $$\n\nCombining these facts, we can determine the ratio of the peak calcium amplitudes.\nFor the control case:\n$$ A_{\\text{control}} = A_{SR, \\text{control}} + A_{ext, \\text{control}} $$\nFor the drug case:\n$$ A_{\\text{drug}} = A_{SR, \\text{drug}} + A_{ext, \\text{drug}} $$\nThe drug reduces the ionic calcium current to $0.10$ of its control value. The calcium entry contribution, $A_{ext}$, is proportional to this current. Thus:\n$$ A_{ext, \\text{drug}} = 0.10 \\cdot A_{ext, \\text{control}} $$\nApplying the \"negligible contribution\" assumption ($A_{ext} \\approx 0$), we have:\n$$ A_{\\text{control}} \\approx A_{SR, \\text{control}} $$\n$$ A_{\\text{drug}} \\approx A_{SR, \\text{drug}} $$\nSince $A_{SR, \\text{drug}} = A_{SR, \\text{control}}$, it follows that $A_{\\text{drug}} \\approx A_{\\text{control}}$. For an idealized model as presented, this approximation becomes an equality.\n$$ A_{\\text{drug}} = A_{\\text{control}} $$\nThe ratio of the peak cytosolic calcium transient amplitudes is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{A_{\\text{drug}}}{A_{\\text{control}}} = 1 $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the effect on peak twitch force, $F$. Assumption 3 states that peak twitch force scales proportionally with the peak cytosolic calcium transient amplitude. This can be written as:\n$$ F = k \\cdot A $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors like myofilament calcium sensitivity, which are assumed to be unchanged.\n\nThe ratio of the peak twitch forces is then:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{drug}}}{F_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot A_{\\text{drug}}}{k \\cdot A_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{drug}}}{A_{\\text{control}}} $$\nSubstituting the result for the calcium amplitude ratio:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{drug}}}{F_{\\text{control}}} = 1 $$\n\nThe nifedipine reduces the L-type $Ca^{2+}$ current, but because this current's contribution to the cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ transient is negligible for activating contraction in adult skeletal muscle, and because the drug does not affect the primary voltage-sensing and mechanical coupling function of the DHPR, there is no change in either the peak calcium transient or the resulting peak twitch force under the stated assumptions.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of these two ratios.",
