Consider an axial computed tomography series used for radiomics, where the region of interest (ROI) is provided as a binary mask with exactly $N_{v} = 23{,}000$ voxels labeled as part of the ROI. The DICOM PixelSpacing attribute (tag $(0028,0030)$) indicates an in-plane spacing of $[0.7, 0.7]$ millimeters, and the SliceThickness attribute (tag $(0018,0050)$) is $2$ millimeters.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The premises are consistent with standard practices in the field of radiomics and medical imaging.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the total volume of a Region of Interest (ROI) from a computed tomography (CT) scan. The total volume, $V_{\\text{ROI}}$, is the product of the number of voxels in the ROI, $N_v$, and the volume of a single voxel, $V_{\\text{voxel}}$.\n$$V_{\\text{ROI}} = N_v \\times V_{\\text{voxel}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that a voxel is to be modeled as a right rectangular prism. The fundamental geometric definition for the volume of such a prism is the product of its three orthogonal edge lengths.\n$$V_{\\text{prism}} = l_1 \\times l_2 \\times l_3$$\n\nThese edge lengths are given by the DICOM attributes for physical spacing. Let the in-plane physical spacing along the row and column directions be denoted by $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, respectively. These correspond to the two values in the `PixelSpacing` attribute. Let the through-plane physical spacing be denoted by $\\Delta z$, which corresponds to the `SliceThickness` attribute.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- In-plane spacing (from `PixelSpacing`): $\\Delta x = 0.7 \\text{ mm}$ and $\\Delta y = 0.7 \\text{ mm}$.\n- Through-plane spacing (from `SliceThickness`): $\\Delta z = 2 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume the voxel edge lengths are equal to these physical spacings. This is a standard convention in medical imaging for orthogonal acquisitions, where the voxel fills the space defined by these center-to-center and slice-to-slice distances.\n\nFirst, as requested, we derive the general expression for the volume of a single voxel, $V_{\\text{voxel}}$, in terms of these DICOM-derived parameters.\n$$V_{\\text{voxel}} = \\Delta x \\times \\Delta y \\times \\Delta z$$\nThis formula connects the DICOM metadata to the physical volume of a single image element.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values to calculate the volume of one voxel in cubic millimeters.\n$$V_{\\text{voxel}} = (0.7 \\text{ mm}) \\times (0.7 \\text{ mm}) \\times (2 \\text{ mm})$$\n$$V_{\\text{voxel}} = 0.49 \\text{ mm}^2 \\times 2 \\text{ mm} = 0.98 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThe total number of voxels in the ROI is given as $N_v = 23000$.\nWe can now compute the total volume of the ROI, $V_{\\text{ROI}}$, in cubic millimeters.\n$$V_{\\text{ROI}} = N_v \\times V_{\\text{voxel}} = 23000 \\times 0.98 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n$$V_{\\text{ROI}} = 22540 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThe final part of the problem requires expressing this volume in cubic centimeters ($\\text{cm}^3$). The conversion between millimeters and centimeters is $1 \\text{ cm} = 10 \\text{ mm}$. For volumetric units, we must cube this conversion factor:\n$$1 \\text{ cm}^3 = (10 \\text{ mm})^3 = 1000 \\text{ mm}^3$$\nTo convert $V_{\\text{ROI}}$ from $\\text{mm}^3$ to $\\text{cm}^3$, we divide by $1000$.\n$$V_{\\text{ROI}} = \\frac{22540 \\text{ mm}^3}{1000 \\frac{\\text{mm}^3}{\\text{cm}^3}} = 22.54 \\text{ cm}^3$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $22.54$, already consists of exactly four significant figures (the digits $2$, $2$, $5$, and $4$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe final ROI volume is $22.54 \\text{ cm}^3$.",

            "problem": "In quantitative image analysis known as radiomics, a typical workflow proceeds from image acquisition through segmentation to preprocessing and feature extraction. During preprocessing, intensity discretization is often performed to stabilize texture features such as those derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. Consider a region of interest (ROI, region of interest) segmented on a computed tomography image where intensities are measured in Hounsfield Unit (HU, Hounsfield Unit). In fixed bin width discretization, intensities within the ROI are partitioned into contiguous bins, each of width $w$, covering the range from the minimum intensity $I_{\\min}$ to the maximum intensity $I_{\\max}$. Bins are defined as left-inclusive and right-exclusive intervals, except that the last bin is left-inclusive and right-inclusive to ensure inclusion of $I_{\\max}$.

No rounding instructions are necessary because the result is exactly integral. Provide both values together as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the field of radiomics, presenting a well-posed and objective problem in quantitative image analysis. All necessary data and definitions for intensity discretization are provided, and the setup is internally consistent and physically realistic.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of expressions for the number of bins $N$ and the bin index $b$ for a given intensity $g$, based on a fixed bin width discretization scheme. The parameters are the minimum intensity $I_{\\min}$, maximum intensity $I_{\\max}$, and the bin width $w$. The bins are defined as left-inclusive and right-exclusive intervals, with indexing starting at $1$. A special condition is that the last bin is made right-inclusive to contain $I_{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the total number of bins, $N$.\nThe total range of intensities to be discretized is $\\Delta I = I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}$.\nThe bins are generated by partitioning this range into segments of width $w$. The bin edges can be thought of as a sequence starting at $I_{\\min}$, with subsequent edges at $I_{\\min} + w$, $I_{\\min} + 2w$, and so on.\nThe number of bins required is the number of intervals of width $w$ necessary to cover the entire span $\\Delta I$.\nLet's consider the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w}$ is not an integer.\nLet $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w} = K + \\delta$, where $K$ is an integer and $0 < \\delta < 1$. This means the range spans $K$ full bins and a fraction of another. Thus, a total of $K+1$ bins are required. This is equivalent to $\\lceil \\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w} \\rceil$. For example, if the range is $10$ and width is $3$, $\\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33$. We need $4$ bins: $[0,3), [3,6), [6,9), [9,10]$. $\\lceil 3.33 \\rceil = 4$.\n\nCase 2: $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w}$ is an integer, say $K$.\nThis means the total range is exactly divisible into $K$ intervals of width $w$. The sequence of bins according to the left-inclusive, right-exclusive rule $[...)$ would be:\nBin 1: $[I_{\\min}, I_{\\min} + w)$\nBin 2: $[I_{\\min} + w, I_{\\min} + 2w)$\n...\nBin $K$: $[I_{\\min} + (K-1)w, I_{\\min} + Kw)$.\nSince $I_{\\max} - I_{\\min} = Kw$, we have $I_{\\max} = I_{\\min} + Kw$. The final bin, Bin $K$, has an interval $[..., I_{\\max})$. This excludes the value $I_{\\max}$. The problem states that the last bin must be right-inclusive to ensure $I_{\\max}$ is included. Following the most standard interpretation for this process, the \"last bin\" in the sequence, which is Bin $K$, is the one whose interval is modified to be closed on the right. So, the interval for Bin $K$ becomes $[I_{\\min} + (K-1)w, I_{\\max}]$. The total number of bins is $K$. The ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ for an integer $x$ is $x$. So, in this case, $N = K = \\lceil \\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w} \\rceil$.\n\nIn both cases, the number of bins $N$ is correctly given by the ceiling function.\n$$N = \\left\\lceil \\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the bin index $b$ for a voxel with intensity $g$, where $I_{\\min} \\le g \\le I_{\\max}$. The bin index $b$ starts from $1$.\nFor any bin $b$ (except possibly the last one), an intensity $g$ falls into it if it satisfies the condition:\n$$I_{\\min} + (b-1)w \\le g < I_{\\min} + bw$$\nThis inequality is valid because bins are left-inclusive and right-exclusive, and the $b$-th bin starts at the position offset by $b-1$ widths from $I_{\\min}$.\nWe can solve for $b$:\n$$(b-1)w \\le g - I_{\\min} < bw$$\n$$b-1 \\le \\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w} < b$$\nThis shows that $b-1$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w}$. This is the definition of the floor function, $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$.\n$$b-1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w} \\right\\rfloor$$\nTherefore, the bin index is:\n$$b(g) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\nThis formula correctly assigns an index for any $g$ that is not on the upper boundary of the very last bin. A special consideration is needed for $g=I_{\\max}$ in the specific case where $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w}$ is an integer, say $K$. In this scenario, $N=K$, but the formula would yield $b(I_{\\max}) = \\lfloor K \\rfloor + 1 = K+1$, which is out of bounds. The correct index for $I_{\\max}$ is always $N$. A general expression that handles this edge case is $b(g) = \\min(N, \\lfloor \\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w} \\rfloor + 1)$. However, for any $g < I_{\\max}$, or for $g=I_{\\max}$ when $\\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w}$ is not an integer, the simpler formula holds. Since the problem asks to evaluate $b$ for an intensity $g$ that is not $I_{\\max}$, the simpler expression is sufficient for the calculation part.\n\nNow we evaluate these expressions for the given values:\n$I_{\\min} = -150$ HU\n$I_{\\max} = 250$ HU\n$w = 25$ HU\n$g = 37$ HU\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of bins, $N$:\n$$N = \\left\\lceil \\frac{I_{\\max} - I_{\\min}}{w} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{250 - (-150)}{25} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{400}{25} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 16 \\rceil$$\nSince $16$ is an integer, $\\lceil 16 \\rceil = 16$.\nSo, the number of bins is $N = 16$.\n\nNext, we calculate the bin index $b$ for the intensity $g = 37$:\n$$b = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{g - I_{\\min}}{w} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{37 - (-150)}{25} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{187}{25} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$\nPerforming the division: $\\frac{187}{25} = 7.48$.\n$$b = \\lfloor 7.48 \\rfloor + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$$\nSo, the bin index for an intensity of $37$ HU is $b=8$.\n\nThe final values are $N=16$ and $b=8$. Both are integers as required.",

This latter effect is a direct consequence of Jensen's inequality for the convex function $f(x)=x^2$.\n\n**3.
