This practice delves into the statistical origins of random coincidences, which are a primary source of noise in PET images. By modeling the detection of single photons as independent Poisson processes, you will derive the classic formula for the random coincidence rate, gaining a crucial understanding of how system parameters like detector activity and the coincidence timing window contribute to image degradation .",

            "problem": "In Positron Emission Tomography (PET), consider two opposing detectors labeled $i$ and $j$. Let the measured singles rates (counts per unit time) be $S_i$ and $S_j$, respectively, and assume these singles streams represent independent realizations of stationary Poisson processes. The system declares a coincidence whenever the absolute time difference between a detection in detector $i$ and a detection in detector $j$ is less than or equal to a fixed coincidence window $\\tau$, that is, whenever $|t_i - t_j| \\le \\tau$. A random coincidence is defined as any such declared coincidence arising from detections that do not originate from the same positron annihilation event.\n\nStarting only from the defining property of a stationary Poisson process—that the expected number of events in any interval of length $L$ equals the process rate multiplied by $L$—derive an analytic expression for the expected random coincidence rate $R_{ij}$ between detectors $i$ and $j$ in terms of $S_i$, $S_j$, and $\\tau$. Clearly state the assumptions required for the validity of your expression, and explain the origin of any multiplicative factors in your result.

            "solution": "We model the singles streams in detectors $i$ and $j$ as independent stationary Poisson processes with rates $S_i$ and $S_j$, respectively. By the defining property of a stationary Poisson process, the expected number of events from detector $j$ in any time interval of length $L$ is $S_j L$, and similarly for detector $i$ with rate $S_i$.\n\nA random coincidence is declared whenever there exists a pair of events, one from detector $i$ and one from detector $j$, whose timestamps satisfy $|t_i - t_j| \\le \\tau$. To compute the expected rate $R_{ij}$ of such pairs, we proceed by conditioning on events in detector $i$ and counting expected partner events in detector $j$.\n\nConsider a single event in detector $i$ occurring at time $t$. The set of times in detector $j$ that produce a declared coincidence with this event is the interval $[t - \\tau, t + \\tau]$, which has length $2\\tau$. For a stationary Poisson process in detector $j$ with rate $S_j$, the expected number of events in this interval is\n$$\n\\text{Expected number from detector } j \\text{ in } [t - \\tau, t + \\tau] = S_j \\cdot (2\\tau) = 2\\tau S_j.\n$$\nThis quantity includes the possibility of more than one event occurring in the interval; however, for a Poisson process the expected number in any interval is additive, and this expectation is exact.\n\nNow, the expected number of such $i$-events per unit time is $S_i$. Therefore, the expected total number of $i$–$j$ pairs per unit time that satisfy the coincidence criterion is the product of the expected number of $i$-events per unit time and the expected number of $j$-events in the coincidence interval around each $i$-event:\n$$\nR_{ij} = S_i \\cdot (2\\tau S_j) = 2\\tau S_i S_j.\n$$\nThis derivation counts each $i$–$j$ pair exactly once by anchoring the counting to events in detector $i$; no double counting occurs because each pair is associated with one $i$-event and one $j$-event. The factor $2$ arises from the symmetric coincidence condition $|t_i - t_j| \\le \\tau$, which corresponds to an interval of length $2\\tau$ around each anchor event.\n\nAssumptions and conditions for validity:\n- Independence: The singles in detectors $i$ and $j$ are independent Poisson processes, implying no temporal correlation between the streams aside from true coincidences, which are excluded by the definition of random coincidences.\n- Stationarity: The rates $S_i$ and $S_j$ are constant over the time scale of interest, so the expected counts scale linearly with interval length.\n- Well-defined coincidence model: The system declares a coincidence for any pair with $|t_i - t_j| \\le \\tau$, implying an effective acceptance interval of length $2\\tau$ around each anchor event.\n- Throughput and dead time: The measured singles rates $S_i$ and $S_j$ already reflect any dead-time and pile-up effects; the derivation assumes that the system can register all potential random coincidences implied by these measured rates (no additional saturation or veto logic that would suppress pairs).\n- Timing resolution: Jitter or finite timing resolution that broadens the effective coincidence criterion can be absorbed into an effective window $\\tau$; the result depends on the window used operationally for declaring coincidences.\n\nUnder these standard Positron Emission Tomography principles, the expected random coincidence rate is given by\n$$\nR_{ij} = 2\\tau S_i S_j.\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the minimum crystal thickness $t$ that satisfies two constraints: a minimum detection efficiency and a maximum tangential blur. We will formulate each constraint as an inequality for $t$.\n\n**Constraint 1: Detection Efficiency**\nThe probability that a photon travels a distance $t$ through the crystal without interacting is given by the transmission probability, $P_{trans}$. According to the Beer-Lambert law, this is:\n$$ P_{trans} = \\frac{I(t)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu t) $$\nA photon is considered detected if it interacts at least once.

This gives our first inequality:\n$$ \\eta(t) \\ge 0.85 $$\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-\\mu t) \\ge 0.85 $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\mu t) \\le 0.15 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\mu t \\le \\ln(0.15) $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$ \\mu t \\ge -\\ln(0.15) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.15}\\right) $$\nThis sets a lower bound on the crystal thickness $t$:\n$$ t \\ge \\frac{-\\ln(0.15)}{\\mu} $$\nLet's call this minimum thickness required for efficiency $t_{min,\\eta}$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Tangential RMS Blur**\nThe problem states that the interaction depth, let's call it the random variable $X$, is uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, t]$. The probability density function (PDF) is:\n$$ p(x) = \\frac{1}{t} \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [0, t] $$\nThe RMS depth uncertainty is the standard deviation of this distribution, $\\sigma_x$. First, we find the variance, $\\sigma_x^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$.\nThe mean (expected value) of $X$ is:\n$$ E[X] = \\int_0^t x p(x) dx = \\int_0^t x \\frac{1}{t} dx = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^t = \\frac{t^2}{2t} = \\frac{t}{2} $$\nThe expected value of $X^2$ is:\n$$ E[X^2] = \\int_0^t x^2 p(x) dx = \\int_0^t x^2 \\frac{1}{t} dx = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^t = \\frac{t^3}{3t} = \\frac{t^2}{3} $$\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_x^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = \\frac{t^2}{3} - \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{t^2}{3} - \\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{4t^2 - 3t^2}{12} = \\frac{t^2}{12} $$\nThe RMS depth uncertainty (standard deviation) is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{t^2}{12}} = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{t}{2\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThe tangential blur, $\\sigma_{tan}$, is this uncertainty projected by the incidence angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\sigma_{tan} = \\sigma_x \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{t}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\tan(\\theta) $$\nThis blur must not exceed $\\sigma_{tan,max} = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$ at the worst-case angle $\\theta_{max} = 15^{\\circ}$.

            "solution": "The core principle of time-of-flight (TOF) PET is to use the difference in arrival times of the two annihilation photons to better estimate the position of the annihilation event along the line of response (LOR). Let the LOR be a one-dimensional coordinate axis. Let the midpoint between the two detectors be the origin, $x=0$. An annihilation event occurs at an unknown position $x$ along this axis.\n\nWhen the event occurs at $x$, one photon travels a distance $d_1$ to the first detector, and the other photon travels a distance $d_2$ to the second detector. The position $x$ represents the displacement from the center of the LOR. This displacement means one photon's path is shortened by a length $|x|$ and the other's is lengthened by the same amount, relative to an event at the center. Therefore, the difference in the path lengths traveled by the two photons is $\\Delta l = 2|x|$. For simplicity, we define the sign of $x$ such that the path difference is $\\Delta l = 2x$.\n\nThe two photons are created simultaneously and travel at the speed of light, $c$. The difference in their arrival times at the detectors, $\\Delta t$, is directly proportional to the path length difference:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta l}{c} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta l$, we get:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{2x}{c} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to find the position of the event, $x$, based on the measured time difference, $\\Delta t$:\n$$ x = \\frac{c}{2} \\Delta t $$\nThis equation represents the mapping from the measured timing difference to the event's spatial position along the LOR.\n\nThe problem states that the measurement of $\\Delta t$ is subject to a timing uncertainty, which is modeled as a Gaussian random variable with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $FWHM_t$. Since the relationship between $x$ and $\\Delta t$ is linear, the resulting uncertainty in the position, $x$, will also follow a Gaussian distribution. The uncertainty in position, characterized by its FWHM, $FWHM_x$, is related to the timing uncertainty $FWHM_t$ by the same linear factor:\n$$ FWHM_x = \\frac{c}{2} FWHM_t $$\nThis is the derived mapping from timing uncertainty to spatial uncertainty along the LOR.\n\nNext, we must derive the relationship between the FWHM and the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, for a Gaussian distribution.
