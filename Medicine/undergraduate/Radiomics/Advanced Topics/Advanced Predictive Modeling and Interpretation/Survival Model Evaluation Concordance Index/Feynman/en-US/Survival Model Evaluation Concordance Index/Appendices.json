Let the survival time be a nonnegative random variable $T$, and the censoring time be $C$, with observed time $Y = \\min\\{T, C\\}$ and event indicator $\\Delta = \\mathbf{1}\\{T \\leq C\\}$. The model outputs a scalar risk score $r(\\mathbf{x})$ such that the hazard function $h(t \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ is monotonically increasing in $r(\\mathbf{x})$, consistent with proportional hazards where $h(t \\mid \\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\exp(r(\\mathbf{x}))$. The concordance index (C-index) is defined as the probability that, for a randomly drawn admissible pair of individuals where the shorter observed time corresponds to an event, the individual with the shorter observed event time has a larger predicted risk score.\n\nYou are given three patients with predicted risk scores $\\mathbf{r} = [0.2, 1.1, -0.4]$, observed times $\\mathbf{Y} = [3, 2, 5]$, and event indicators $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} = [1, 1, 0]$. Using only the foundational definitions above and the admissible-pair logic for right-censored data, compute the C-index for this cohort by explicitly determining which pairs are admissible and whether they are concordant or discordant under the ordering implied by the risk scores. Assume no ties in risk scores or observed times occur; if a tie were to occur in the risk scores within an admissible pair, it would contribute one-half toward concordance.\n\nIn addition, provide a principled interpretation of what discordant pairs imply for model calibration versus discrimination in survival prediction, grounded in the definitions of $T$, $C$, $Y$, $\\Delta$, and risk-based hazard ordering.\n\nExpress the final C-index as a single real number.

            "solution": "The objective is to compute the concordance index (C-index) from first principles for right-censored survival data under a Deep Neural Survival (DeepSurv) risk model. We begin from core survival analysis definitions and the monotonic relationship between the predicted risk score and the hazard.\n\nLet $T$ be the true survival time and $C$ be the censoring time. The observed time is $Y = \\min\\{T, C\\}$ and the event indicator is $\\Delta = \\mathbf{1}\\{T \\leq C\\}$. A predicted risk score $r(\\mathbf{x})$ is used to produce a hazard ordering where higher $r(\\mathbf{x})$ implies a higher hazard $h(t \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ and thus a tendency toward shorter event times. The concordance index is the probability that the ordering of risk scores agrees with the ordering of observed event times for admissible pairs. An admissible pair $(i, j)$ under right censoring is defined by the following logic: the pair is included if the shorter observed time corresponds to an event, namely if $Y_i  Y_j$ and $\\Delta_i = 1$, or $Y_j  Y_i$ and $\\Delta_j = 1$. Pairs where the minimum observed time is censored are not admissible because the true ordering of event times is unknown in that case.\n\nA pair is concordant if the subject with the shorter observed event time has a larger risk score. A pair is discordant if the subject with the shorter observed event time has a smaller risk score. Ties in risk scores within admissible pairs contribute one-half to concordance, but here no ties occur.\n\nWe are given three subjects:\n- Subject $1$: $r_1 = 0.2$, $Y_1 = 3$, $\\Delta_1 = 1$.\n- Subject $2$: $r_2 = 1.1$, $Y_2 = 2$, $\\Delta_2 = 1$.\n- Subject $3$: $r_3 = -0.4$, $Y_3 = 5$, $\\Delta_3 = 0$.\n\nWe enumerate all unordered pairs $\\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\\}$ and test admissibility and concordance.\n\n1. Pair $(1, 2)$: Compare observed times $Y_1 = 3$ and $Y_2 = 2$. The shorter time is $Y_2 = 2$ with $\\Delta_2 = 1$, so the pair is admissible. Concordance requires that the subject with the shorter event time (subject $2$) has a larger risk score. We check $r_2$ versus $r_1$: $r_2 = 1.1$ and $r_1 = 0.2$, so $r_2 > r_1$. This pair is concordant.\n\n2. Pair $(1, 3)$: Compare $Y_1 = 3$ and $Y_3 = 5$. The shorter time is $Y_1 = 3$ with $\\Delta_1 = 1$, so the pair is admissible. Concordance requires that subject $1$ has a larger risk score than subject $3$. We check $r_1$ versus $r_3$: $r_1 = 0.2$ and $r_3 = -0.4$, so $r_1 > r_3$. This pair is concordant.\n\n3. Pair $(2, 3)$: Compare $Y_2 = 2$ and $Y_3 = 5$. The shorter time is $Y_2 = 2$ with $\\Delta_2 = 1$, so the pair is admissible. Concordance requires that subject $2$ has a larger risk score than subject $3$. We check $r_2$ versus $r_3$: $r_2 = 1.1$ and $r_3 = -0.4$, so $r_2 > r_3$. This pair is concordant.\n\nAll three admissible pairs are concordant. Therefore, the C-index is the fraction of concordant admissible pairs:\n$$\n\\text{C-index} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{number of concordant admissible pairs}}{\\text{number of admissible pairs}} \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{3} \\;=\\; 1.\n$$\n\nInterpretation of discordant pairs in relation to calibration and discrimination: A discordant pair arises when the subject with the shorter observed event time has a lower predicted risk score, i.e., the model’s risk ordering disagrees with the observed event-time ordering for an admissible pair. Such discordance directly indicates an error in discrimination, because discrimination measures the model’s ability to correctly rank-order risks consistent with event times (larger $r(\\mathbf{x})$ should correspond to smaller $T$ when $\\Delta = 1$ for the shorter observed time). Calibration, by contrast, concerns the agreement between predicted absolute risks or hazard levels and observed outcome frequencies over time; it requires that the numerical scale of predictions matches observed probabilities or rates. A model can be well calibrated yet exhibit poor discrimination (many discordant pairs), or be poorly calibrated yet maintain good discrimination (few discordant pairs). In this dataset, the absence of discordant pairs implies perfect discrimination for these subjects, but it does not in itself guarantee perfect calibration of the absolute risk scale.\n\nThus, the computed C-index is $1$.",
