It uses standard, non-controversial definitions from epidemiology. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The data are hypothetical but plausible. The problem is a straightforward application of core epidemiological principles designed to highlight the distinction between proportionate mortality and absolute risk, which is a key concept. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core epidemiologic definition of Proportionate Mortality ($PM$) for a specific cause is the number of deaths from that cause in a given period divided by the total number of deaths from all causes in the same period. The formula is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{cause}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause}}{\\text{Total number of deaths from all causes}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total number of deaths ($D_{\\text{total}}$) for each municipality.\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$:\nThe total number of deaths, $D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}}$, is the sum of deaths from all listed causes:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}} = D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{can},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{inj},\\mathcal{A}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}} = 120 + 80 + 50 + 50 = 300\n$$\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$:\nThe total number of deaths, $D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}}$, is the sum of deaths from all listed causes:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}} = D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{can},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{inj},\\mathcal{B}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}} = 600 + 300 + 200 + 100 = 1200\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the required Proportionate Mortality values for each task.\n\n**Task 1: Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease**\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$, the Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease ($PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{50}{300} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.16666...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.1667$.\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$, the Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease ($PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{200}{1200} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.16666...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = 0.1667$.\n\n**Task 2: Proportionate Mortality for cardiovascular disease**\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$, the Proportionate Mortality for cardiovascular disease ($PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{120}{300} = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\n$$\nTo express $0.4$ with four significant figures, we write it as $0.4000$.\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$, the Proportionate Mortality for cardiovascular disease ($PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{600}{1200} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nTo express $0.5$ with four significant figures, we write it as $0.5000$.\n\n**Task 3: Qualitative determination**\n\nThis task is for conceptual understanding. The absolute risk of death from a cause (or the cause-specific mortality rate) is defined as the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total population size.\n$$\n\\text{Absolute Risk}_{\\text{cause}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause}}{\\text{Total population}}\n$$\nLet's compute the absolute risk for infectious death in each municipality.\nFor $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\n\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}}{N_{\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{50}{50{,}000} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001\n$$\nFor $\\mathcal{B}$:\n$$\n\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}}{N_{\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{200}{600{,}000} = \\frac{2}{6000} = \\frac{1}{3000} \\approx 0.000333\n$$\nWe observe that $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = 1/6$, but $\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} \\neq \\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}$. The risk of dying from an infectious disease is three times higher in Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$ than in Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, identical Proportionate Mortality does not imply identical absolute risk. This is because $PM$ is a ratio of deaths-to-deaths and is independent of the population size, whereas absolute risk is a ratio of deaths-to-population and directly measures the risk to an individual in that population.\n\nFinal computed values for reporting, rounded to four significant figures:\n- $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.1667$\n- $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = 0.1667$\n- $PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.4000$\n- $PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}} = 0.5000$\n\nThese values will be placed in the final answer box in the specified order.",

            "problem": "An acute respiratory infection spreads through a region over a single surveillance month. The population is stratified into $2$ age groups: children (ages $0$–$17$) and older adults (ages $\\ge 65$ years). For this month, suppose the following are the true infection and death counts due to the infection in each age group: children have $I_{C} = 8000$ infections with $D_{C} = 8$ deaths attributed to this infection, and older adults have $I_{O} = 2000$ infections with $D_{O} = 120$ deaths attributed to this infection. During this month, all deaths due to the infection are completely ascertained by vital records (death ascertainment probability equal to $1$ in both age groups), but infections are under-ascertained. Specifically, the probability that an infection is detected and reported as a case (the ascertainment probability) is $\\pi_{C} = 0.30$ for children and $\\pi_{O} = 0.70$ for older adults.

These are core concepts in infectious disease surveillance. The scenario of differential ascertainment by age is realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a specific, calculable quantity (multiplicative bias for the older adult CFR) and provides all necessary data to compute it. The question is unambiguous. The information about children and all-cause mortality represents contextual data that one must correctly identify as not being necessary for the specific calculation requested, a common feature of well-posed problems designed to test conceptual understanding.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n-   **No Flaws**: The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not missing essential data, and does not contain contradictions. The values are plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the multiplicative bias in the observed case-fatality ratio (CFR) for older adults. The multiplicative bias is defined as the ratio of the observed measure to the true measure.\n\nLet $CFR_{true,O}$ be the true case-fatality ratio for older adults and $CFR_{obs,O}$ be the observed case-fatality ratio for the same group. The multiplicative bias, $B$, is given by:\n$$B = \\frac{CFR_{obs,O}}{CFR_{true,O}}$$\n\nFirst, we define the true CFR for older adults. This is the ratio of the true number of deaths due to the infection, $D_{O}$, to the true number of infections, $I_{O}$.\n$$CFR_{true,O} = \\frac{D_{O}}{I_{O}}$$\n\nNext, we define the observed CFR for older adults. This is the ratio of the observed number of deaths, $D_{obs,O}$, to the observed number of cases (detected infections), $I_{obs,O}$.\n$$CFR_{obs,O} = \\frac{D_{obs,O}}{I_{obs,O}}$$\n\nWe must determine the observed counts based on the true counts and the given ascertainment probabilities.\n\nThe problem states that \"all deaths due to the infection are completely ascertained,\" meaning the death ascertainment probability is $1$. Therefore, the observed number of deaths is equal to the true number of deaths:\n$$D_{obs,O} = D_{O} \\times 1 = D_{O}$$\n\nThe problem states that infections are under-ascertained. The probability that an infection in an older adult is detected and reported as a case is the ascertainment probability $\\pi_{O}$. Thus, the observed number of cases is the true number of infections multiplied by this probability:\n$$I_{obs,O} = I_{O} \\times \\pi_{O}$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the observed CFR in terms of the true counts and the ascertainment probability:\n$$CFR_{obs,O} = \\frac{D_{O}}{I_{O} \\times \\pi_{O}}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $CFR_{true,O}$ and $CFR_{obs,O}$ into the formula for the multiplicative bias $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{\\frac{D_{O}}{I_{O} \\times \\pi_{O}}}{\\frac{D_{O}}{I_{O}}}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$B = \\left( \\frac{D_{O}}{I_{O} \\times \\pi_{O}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{I_{O}}{D_{O}} \\right)$$\n$$B = \\frac{D_{O} \\times I_{O}}{D_{O} \\times I_{O} \\times \\pi_{O}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{1}{\\pi_{O}}$$\n\nThe derivation shows that the multiplicative bias in the CFR is the reciprocal of the case ascertainment probability, under the assumption that death ascertainment is complete ($100\\%$). The information regarding the children's group ($I_C, D_C, \\pi_C$) and the all-cause mortality data are extraneous to this specific calculation and are not used.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the bias for older adults using the given value $\\pi_{O} = 0.70$.\n$$B = \\frac{1}{0.70} = \\frac{1}{7/10} = \\frac{10}{7}$$\n$$B \\approx 1.4285714...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$B \\approx 1.429$$\nThe observed case-fatality ratio is, therefore, approximately $1.429$ times the true case-fatality ratio for older adults.",
