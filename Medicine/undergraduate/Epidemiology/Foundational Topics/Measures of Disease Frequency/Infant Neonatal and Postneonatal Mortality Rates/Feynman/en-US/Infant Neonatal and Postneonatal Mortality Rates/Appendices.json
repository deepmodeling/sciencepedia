            "problem": "A closed birth cohort in a low-mortality setting is followed with complete ascertainment of vital status through age five years. There are $10{,}000$ live births. Within three mutually exclusive and exhaustive age intervals, the observed counts of deaths are: $250$ deaths in the neonatal period (0–27 days), $150$ deaths in the post-neonatal period (from 28 days to under one year), and $100$ deaths in early childhood (12–59 months).\n\nStarting only from the core epidemiologic definitions that a mortality rate for a defined age interval in a birth cohort equals the number of deaths in that interval divided by the number of live births, and that the survival probability across disjoint age intervals equals the product of the interval-specific survival probabilities, compute the following:\n\n- The Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The under-five survival probability to age five years as a decimal, using the product of conditional interval survivals derived from the observed deaths.\n\nThen demonstrate internal consistency by showing that the under-five mortality probability equals one minus the under-five survival probability, and that when expressed per $1{,}000$ this equals the computed U5MR.\n\nExpress NMR, IMR, and U5MR per $1{,}000$ live births, and the survival probability as a unitless decimal. Round all four quantities to four significant figures. Provide your final answer as a single row matrix in the order $\\big[$NMR, IMR, U5MR, under-five survival probability$\\big]$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, and provides all necessary data and definitions to proceed with a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe are given the following information for a closed birth cohort:\n- Number of live births: $N_{LB} = 10,000$.\n- Neonatal deaths (0–27 days): $d_N = 250$.\n- Post-neonatal deaths (from 28 days to under one year): $d_{PN} = 150$.\n- Early childhood deaths (12–59 months): $d_C = 100$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of four quantities: the Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR), and the under-five survival probability ($S_{U5}$). It also requires a demonstration of internal consistency. All final numerical values must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nFirst, we compute the mortality rates per $1,000$ live births based on the provided definition: rate = (number of deaths in interval) / (number of live births).\n\n1.  **Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)**\n    The NMR is based on deaths occurring in the neonatal period (0–27 days).\n    The number of neonatal deaths is $d_N = 250$.\n    The NMR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{NMR} = \\frac{d_N}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{250}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.025 \\times 1,000 = 25\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $25.00$.\n\n2.  **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**\n    The IMR is based on deaths occurring in the first year of life (infancy), which includes both the neonatal and post-neonatal periods.\n    The total number of infant deaths is $d_I = d_N + d_{PN} = 250 + 150 = 400$.\n    The IMR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{IMR} = \\frac{d_I}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{400}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.04 \\times 1,000 = 40\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $40.00$.\n\n3.  **Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR)**\n    The U5MR is based on all deaths occurring before the age of five years (0–59 months). This includes all three specified age intervals.\n    The total number of under-five deaths is $d_{U5} = d_N + d_{PN} + d_C = 250 + 150 + 100 = 500$.\n    The U5MR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{U5MR} = \\frac{d_{U5}}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{500}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.05 \\times 1,000 = 50\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $50.00$.\n\nNext, we compute the under-five survival probability by calculating the product of conditional survival probabilities for each disjoint age interval, as instructed. This is a life-table method. Let $p_i$ be the conditional probability of surviving interval $i$.\n\n-   **Interval 1 (Neonatal):** The number of children at risk at the start is $N_1 = N_{LB} = 10,000$. The number of deaths is $d_1 = 250$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_1 = 1 - \\frac{d_1}{N_1} = 1 - \\frac{250}{10,000} = \\frac{9,750}{10,000}$.\n\n-   **Interval 2 (Post-neonatal):** The number of children at risk at the start is the number who survived the neonatal period, $N_2 = N_1 - d_1 = 10,000 - 250 = 9,750$. The number of deaths is $d_2 = 150$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_2 = 1 - \\frac{d_2}{N_2} = 1 - \\frac{150}{9,750} = \\frac{9,600}{9,750}$.\n\n-   **Interval 3 (Early childhood):** The number of children at risk at the start is the number who survived infancy, $N_3 = N_2 - d_2 = 9,750 - 150 = 9,600$. The number of deaths is $d_3 = 100$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_3 = 1 - \\frac{d_3}{N_3} = 1 - \\frac{100}{9,600} = \\frac{9,500}{9,600}$.\n\n4.  **Under-Five Survival Probability ($S_{U5}$)**\n    The overall probability of surviving to age five is the product of the conditional survival probabilities for each interval:\n    $$\n    S_{U5} = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times p_3 = \\frac{9,750}{10,000} \\times \\frac{9,600}{9,750} \\times \\frac{9,500}{9,600}\n    $$\n    The terms cancel, leaving:\n    $$\n    S_{U5} = \\frac{9,500}{10,000} = 0.95\n    $$\n    This result is equivalent to the total number of survivors at age five ($10,000 - 500 = 9,500$) divided by the initial number of live births.\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9500$.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate internal consistency as requested.\nThe under-five mortality probability, $Q_{U5}$, is the total number of deaths before age five divided by the number of live births:\n$$\nQ_{U5} = \\frac{d_{U5}}{N_{LB}} = \\frac{500}{10,000} = 0.05\n$$\nThe first consistency check is to show that this equals one minus the survival probability:\n$$\n1 - S_{U5} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 = Q_{U5}\n$$\nThis identity holds, confirming consistency.\n\nThe second consistency check is to show that the U5MR is equivalent to the under-five mortality probability expressed per $1,000$:\n$$\nQ_{U5} \\times 1,000 = 0.05 \\times 1,000 = 50\n$$\nThis value of $50$ is identical to the U5MR of $50$ per $1,000$ live births calculated earlier. This also confirms consistency.\n\nThe four required quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   NMR: $25.00$\n-   IMR: $40.00$\n-   U5MR: $50.00$\n-   Under-five survival probability: $0.9500$",

            "introduction": "Beyond simply calculating a rate, a key task in epidemiology is to compare rates across different populations to identify disparities.

            "problem": "An epidemiologist seeks to estimate the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), defined as the expected number of infant deaths per $1{,}000$ live births, and to quantify a rate ratio by residence (rural versus urban). Consider a single county-year with two strata: urban and rural. In the urban stratum there were $B_{0} = 40{,}000$ live births and $D_{0} = 180$ infant deaths. In the rural stratum there were $B_{1} = 12{,}000$ live births and $D_{1} = 84$ infant deaths. Assume infant deaths are rare and occur independently across births within each stratum.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of a rate and a count model with independent events, formulate a Poisson regression for the infant death counts $D_{i}$ with an offset $\\log(B_{i})$ and a single binary covariate $R_{i}$ that equals $1$ for rural and $0$ for urban. Explicitly write the mean structure for $D_{i}$, identify how the IMR and the rural-to-urban rate ratio are represented in the model parameters, and justify the Poisson variance assumption in this context using first principles.\n\nThen, using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) under the specified model, derive a closed-form estimator for the rural-to-urban rate ratio and compute its numerical value from the data provided. Report the rural-to-urban rate ratio as a decimal (no percent sign), rounded to four significant figures. Do not report any other quantity as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiological methods, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its language. It presents a standard scenario for the application of Poisson regression to count data.\n\nThe problem asks for the formulation and application of a Poisson regression model to estimate a rate ratio from infant mortality data. Let $D_i$ be the number of infant deaths and $B_i$ be the number of live births for stratum $i$, where $i=0$ for urban and $i=1$ for rural.\n\nFirst, we formulate the Poisson regression model. The number of deaths $D_i$ in stratum $i$ is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, $D_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_i)$, where $\\mu_i$ is the expected number of deaths in stratum $i$. The expected number of deaths is the product of the infant mortality rate $\\lambda_i$ (deaths per live birth) and the number of live births $B_i$. Thus, the mean structure for the count is $\\mu_i = \\mathbb{E}[D_i] = \\lambda_i B_i$.\n\nThe Poisson regression model specifies a relationship between the rate $\\lambda_i$ and the covariates using a log-link function. The covariate $R_i$ is a binary indicator, with $R_0 = 0$ for the urban stratum and $R_1 = 1$ for the rural stratum. The model for the rate is given by:\n$$ \\log(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 R_i $$\nThis is the linear predictor for the rate. To model the count $D_i$, we incorporate the number of births $B_i$ as an exposure variable. The standard way to do this in a Poisson GLM is with an offset term. The model for the expected count $\\mu_i$ is:\n$$ \\log(\\mu_i) = \\log(\\lambda_i B_i) = \\log(\\lambda_i) + \\log(B_i) $$\nSubstituting the linear predictor for $\\log(\\lambda_i)$, we get the full model equation:\n$$ \\log(\\mathbb{E}[D_i]) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 R_i + \\log(B_i) $$\nThe term $\\log(B_i)$ is the offset. From this, the mean structure for $D_i$ is explicitly:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[D_i] = \\mu_i = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 R_i + \\log(B_i)) = B_i \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 R_i) $$\n\nNext, we identify how the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the rate ratio are represented by the model parameters. The IMR is defined per $1,000$ live births, so $IMR_i = 1000 \\times \\lambda_i$.\nFor the urban stratum ($i=0$, $R_0=0$):\nThe rate is $\\lambda_0 = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 0) = \\exp(\\beta_0)$.\nThe Urban IMR is $1000 \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_0)$.\nFor the rural stratum ($i=1$, $R_1=1$):\nThe rate is $\\lambda_1 = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 1) = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$.\nThe Rural IMR is $1000 \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$.\nThe rural-to-urban rate ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the rural rate to the urban rate:\n$$ RR = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)}{\\exp(\\beta_0)} = \\exp(\\beta_1) $$\nThus, the parameter $\\beta_1$ represents the log-rate-ratio, and $\\exp(\\beta_1)$ is the rate ratio itself.\n\nThe justification for the Poisson variance assumption stems from first principles. Each of the $B_i$ births is an independent Bernoulli trial, where infant death is a \"success\" with a small probability $p_i$. The total number of deaths $D_i$ therefore follows a Binomial distribution, $D_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=B_i, p=p_i)$. The mean of this distribution is $\\mathbb{E}[D_i] = B_i p_i$, and the variance is $\\text{Var}(D_i) = B_i p_i (1-p_i)$. The problem states that infant deaths are rare events, which implies that the probability $p_i$ is very close to zero ($p_i \\ll 1$). In this case, the factor $(1-p_i) \\approx 1$, and the variance becomes $\\text{Var}(D_i) \\approx B_i p_i = \\mathbb{E}[D_i]$. The property that the variance equals the mean is the defining characteristic of the Poisson distribution. This Poisson approximation to the Binomial distribution is highly accurate when the number of trials ($B_i$) is large and the event probability ($p_i$) is small, both of which are true in this context.\n\nTo find the estimator for the rate ratio, we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The likelihood function $L$ for the two independent strata is the product of their Poisson probabilities:\n$$ L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1; D_0, D_1) = \\frac{\\mu_0^{D_0} \\exp(-\\mu_0)}{D_0!} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_1^{D_1} \\exp(-\\mu_1)}{D_1!} $$\nThe log-likelihood function $\\ell$, ignoring constant terms in $D_i!$, is:\n$$ \\ell(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = D_0 \\log(\\mu_0) - \\mu_0 + D_1 \\log(\\mu_1) - \\mu_1 $$\nSubstitute $\\mu_0 = B_0 \\exp(\\beta_0)$ and $\\mu_1 = B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$:\n$$ \\ell(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = D_0 \\log(B_0 \\exp(\\beta_0)) - B_0 \\exp(\\beta_0) + D_1 \\log(B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)) - B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) $$\n$$ \\ell(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = D_0(\\log(B_0) + \\beta_0) - B_0 \\exp(\\beta_0) + D_1(\\log(B_1) + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1) - B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) $$\nTo find the MLEs $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, we set the partial derivatives of $\\ell$ to zero.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\beta_1} = D_1 - B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\beta_0} = D_0 - B_0 \\exp(\\beta_0) + D_1 - B_1 \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) = 0 $$\nFrom the first score equation (for $\\beta_1$), we get $D_1 = B_1 \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1)$.\nSubstituting this into the second score equation gives $D_0 - B_0 \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0) + D_1 - D_1 = 0$, which simplifies to $D_0 = B_0 \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\nFrom these two results, we get the MLEs for the rates:\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda}_0 = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\frac{D_0}{B_0} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda}_1 = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{D_1}{B_1} $$\nThe MLE for the rate ratio, $\\widehat{RR}$, is $\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$. We can find this by dividing the two expressions:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1)}{\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)} = \\frac{D_1/B_1}{D_0/B_0} $$\nThis shows that the MLE of the rate ratio is simply the ratio of the observed empirical rates.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $D_0 = 180$, $B_0 = 40,000$, $D_1 = 84$, and $B_1 = 12,000$.\nThe estimated urban rate is $\\hat{\\lambda}_0 = \\frac{180}{40000} = 0.0045$.\nThe estimated rural rate is $\\hat{\\lambda}_1 = \\frac{84}{12000} = 0.007$.\nThe estimated rate ratio is:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{0.007}{0.0045} = \\frac{7/1000}{4.5/1000} = \\frac{7}{4.5} = \\frac{14}{9} \\approx 1.5555... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the rural-to-urban rate ratio is $1.556$.",

Substituting this gives:\n$$\nL_{\\text{obs}} = L_{\\text{true}} + S_{\\text{true}}(1 - \\pi_{SS}) - E_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{ES} = L_{\\text{true}} + S_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{SE} - E_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{ES}\n$$\nThis formula correctly reflects that $L_{\\text{obs}}$ equals $L_{\\text{true}}$ plus the number of stillbirths misclassified as live (and then early neonatal deaths), minus the number of early neonatal deaths misclassified as stillbirths.\n\nThe observed number of infant deaths, $D_{\\text{obs}}$, is the sum of observed early neonatal deaths, $E_{\\text{rec}}$, and the correctly ascertained post-neonatal deaths, $P_{\\text{true}}$.\n$$\nD_{\\text{obs}} = E_{\\text{rec}} + P_{\\text{true}}\n$$\nThe number of recorded early neonatal deaths, $E_{\\text{rec}}$, is the sum of true stillbirths misclassified as early neonatal deaths and true early neonatal deaths recorded correctly.\n$$\nE_{\\text{rec}} = S_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{SE} + E_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{EE}\n$$\nSo, the total observed infant deaths are:\n$$\nD_{\\text{obs}} = S_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{SE} + E_{\\text{true}} \\pi_{EE} + P_{\\text{true}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to find $L_{\\text{obs}}$ and $D_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$S_{\\text{true}} = 3,000$, $\\pi_{SE} = 0.15$, $\\pi_{ES} = 0.10$, $\\pi_{EE} = 0.90$.\n$$\nL_{\\text{obs}} = 100,000 + (3,000 \\times 0.15) - (1,500 \\times 0.10)\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\text{obs}} = 100,000 + 450 - 150 = 100,300\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{obs}} = (3,000 \\times 0.15) + (1,500 \\times 0.90) + 500\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{obs}} = 450 + 1,350 + 500 = 2,300\n$$\nThe observed IMR is then:\n$$\n\\text{IMR}_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{obs}}}{L_{\\text{obs}}} \\times 1000 = \\frac{2,300}{100,300} \\times 1000\n$$\n$$\n\\text{IMR}_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 22.93120638\n$$\nFinally, we compute the absolute bias, $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\text{IMR}_{\\text{obs}} - \\text{IMR}_{\\text{true}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 22.93120638 - 20 = 2.93120638\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx 2.931\n$$\nThis positive bias indicates that the misclassification leads to an overestimation of the Infant Mortality Rate. This is because the number of stillbirths misclassified as early neonatal deaths ($450$) is greater than the number of early neonatal deaths misclassified as stillbirths ($150$), causing a net inflation of both the numerator (infant deaths) and the denominator (live births), but the relative effect on the rate is positive.",
