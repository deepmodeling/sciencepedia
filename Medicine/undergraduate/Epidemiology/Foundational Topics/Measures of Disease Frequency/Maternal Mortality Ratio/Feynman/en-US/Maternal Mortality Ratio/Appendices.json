            "problem": "A health surveillance system records maternal deaths in a defined population over a fixed period, with the count modeled as a Poisson random variable. Let the number of maternal deaths be $D \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the expected number of maternal deaths in the period. The total number of live births over the same period, denoted $B$, is known without error. The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is defined as the expected number of maternal deaths per $K$ live births, namely $m = (\\lambda/B)\\times K$, where $K$ is a positive scaling constant (e.g., $K = 100{,}000$).\n\nStarting only from the definition of a Poisson random variable, the definition of the Maternal Mortality Ratio, and standard properties of cumulative distribution functions and their inverses, derive an exact two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for the true Maternal Mortality Ratio $m$ based on a single observed count $D=d$. Your derivation should:\n- Explicitly invert appropriate tail probabilities for the Poisson distribution to obtain limits for $\\lambda$.\n- Use only foundational relationships between the Poisson, Gamma, and Chi-square distributions that follow from their definitions.\n- Transform the interval for $\\lambda$ to an interval for $m$ using the fact that $B$ and $K$ are known constants.\n\nState your final answer as a single analytic expression for the lower and upper confidence limits for $m$ in terms of $d$, $B$, $K$, and $\\alpha$, using standard quantile notation for the Chi-square distribution where necessary.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard statistical and epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively phrased. The task is to derive an exact two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for the Maternal Mortality Ratio, $m$.\n\nLet the number of observed maternal deaths be $D$, which is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$, denoted as $D \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$. An observation $D=d$ is made. The Maternal Mortality Ratio ($m$) is defined as a scaled version of the unknown parameter $\\lambda$: $m = \\frac{K}{B} \\lambda$, where $B$ (number of live births) and $K$ (scaling constant) are known positive constants.\n\nThe construction of an exact $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\lambda$, denoted $[\\lambda_L, \\lambda_U]$, is based on the Clopper-Pearson method, which inverts the tail probabilities of the distribution of the sufficient statistic $D$. The lower and upper limits are the values of $\\lambda$ that place the observed count $d$ at the edge of the respective tail regions. Specifically, the limits are defined by the following two equations:\n$1$. For the lower limit $\\lambda_L$: The probability of observing a count as extreme or more extreme than $d$ in the upper tail is $\\alpha/2$.\n$$P(D \\ge d | \\lambda = \\lambda_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\n$2$. For the upper limit $\\lambda_U$: The probability of observing a count as extreme or more extreme than $d$ in the lower tail is $\\alpha/2$.\n$$P(D \\le d | \\lambda = \\lambda_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\n\nWe will solve these two equations for $\\lambda_L$ and $\\lambda_U$ by leveraging the fundamental relationship between the Poisson, Gamma, and Chi-square distributions.\n\nFirst, let's derive the lower limit, $\\lambda_L$. The equation is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=d}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda_L} \\lambda_L^k}{k!} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nA foundational identity connects the tail probability of a Poisson distribution to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Gamma distribution. For an integer $d>0$, the event that the number of events in an interval is at least $d$ is equivalent to the event that the waiting time for the $d$-th event is less than or equal to the length of the interval. This provides the identity:\n$$ P(D \\ge d | \\lambda) = P(G_d \\le \\lambda) $$\nwhere $G_d$ is a random variable following a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k=d$ and scale parameter $\\theta=1$, denoted $G_d \\sim \\text{Gamma}(d, 1)$.\nApplying this identity, the equation for $\\lambda_L$ becomes:\n$$ P(G_d \\le \\lambda_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nNext, we use the relationship between the Gamma distribution and the Chi-square ($\\chi^2$) distribution. If a random variable $X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(k, \\theta)$, then the variable $2X/\\theta \\sim \\chi^2_{2k}$, a Chi-square distribution with $2k$ degrees of freedom. In our case, $G_d \\sim \\text{Gamma}(d, 1)$, so $2G_d \\sim \\chi^2_{2d}$. We can rewrite the probability statement in terms of this Chi-square variable:\n$$ P(2G_d \\le 2\\lambda_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nLet $Y \\sim \\chi^2_{2d}$. The equation is $P(Y \\le 2\\lambda_L) = \\alpha/2$. By definition of a quantile, $2\\lambda_L$ is the value such that the cumulative probability up to that point is $\\alpha/2$. This is the $(\\alpha/2)$-th quantile of the $\\chi^2_{2d}$ distribution. Using the notation $\\chi^2_{\\nu, p}$ for the $p$-th quantile of the $\\chi^2$ distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom, we have:\n$$ 2\\lambda_L = \\chi^2_{2d, \\alpha/2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_L = \\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2_{2d, \\alpha/2} $$\nFor the case $d=0$, the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution is $0$, which corresponds to a $\\chi^2_0$ distribution. This is a degenerate distribution with a point mass at $0$. Thus, $\\chi^2_{0, p} = 0$ for any $p>0$, so $\\lambda_L=0$ when $d=0$, which is the correct and standard lower bound.\n\nSecond, let's derive the upper limit, $\\lambda_U$. The defining equation is:\n$$ P(D \\le d | \\lambda = \\lambda_U) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda_U} \\lambda_U^k}{k!} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nAnother fundamental identity relates the Poisson CDF to the survival function of a Gamma distribution:\n$$ P(D \\le d | \\lambda) = P(H_{d+1} > \\lambda) $$\nwhere $H_{d+1}$ is a random variable following a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k=d+1$ and scale parameter $\\theta=1$, denoted $H_{d+1} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(d+1, 1)$.\nThe equation for $\\lambda_U$ thus becomes:\n$$ P(H_{d+1} > \\lambda_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ P(H_{d+1} \\le \\lambda_U) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nAgain, we transform the Gamma variable to a Chi-square variable. Since $H_{d+1} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(d+1, 1)$, it follows that $2H_{d+1} \\sim \\chi^2_{2(d+1)}$. The probability statement becomes:\n$$ P(2H_{d+1} \\le 2\\lambda_U) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nLet $Z \\sim \\chi^2_{2(d+1)}$. The equation is $P(Z \\le 2\\lambda_U) = 1 - \\alpha/2$. By definition, $2\\lambda_U$ is the $(1 - \\alpha/2)$-th quantile of the $\\chi^2_{2(d+1)}$ distribution:\n$$ 2\\lambda_U = \\chi^2_{2(d+1), 1-\\alpha/2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_U = \\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2_{2(d+1), 1-\\alpha/2} $$\n\nHaving found the exact $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\lambda$ as $[\\lambda_L, \\lambda_U]$, we now transform this to an interval for the MMR, $m$. The relationship is $m = \\frac{K}{B} \\lambda$. Since $K$ and $B$ are positive constants, the transformation is monotonic and linear. Therefore, the confidence limits for $m$, denoted $[m_L, m_U]$, are found by applying the same transformation to $\\lambda_L$ and $\\lambda_U$:\n$$ m_L = \\frac{K}{B} \\lambda_L = \\frac{K}{2B} \\chi^2_{2d, \\alpha/2} $$\n$$ m_U = \\frac{K}{B} \\lambda_U = \\frac{K}{2B} \\chi^2_{2(d+1), 1-\\alpha/2} $$\nThis constitutes the exact two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for the Maternal Mortality Ratio $m$.",

To find the extrema of $p$, we must find the extrema of the ratio $\\frac{c_1}{c_T}$ over the specified rectangular domain.\n\nTo maximize the ratio $\\frac{c_1}{c_T}$, we must maximize the numerator $c_1$ and minimize the denominator $c_T$. The maximum value for $c_1$ is $c_{1,\\max}$, and the minimum value for $c_T$ is $c_{T,\\min}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_T}\\right)_{\\max} = \\frac{c_{1,\\max}}{c_{T,\\min}} $$\nTo minimize the ratio $\\frac{c_1}{c_T}$, we must minimize the numerator $c_1$ and maximize the denominator $c_T$. The minimum value for $c_1$ is $c_{1,\\min}$, and the maximum value for $c_T$ is $c_{T,\\max}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_T}\\right)_{\\min} = \\frac{c_{1,\\min}}{c_{T,\\max}} $$\nSubstituting these extrema into the expression for the proportional change $p$, we obtain the minimum and maximum possible proportional changes, $p_{\\min}$ and $p_{\\max}$:\n$$ p_{\\min} = r_{\\text{obs}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_T}\\right)_{\\min} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{D_T^{\\text{obs}} / B_T}{D_1^{\\text{obs}} / B_1} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{c_{1,\\min}}{c_{T,\\max}} - 1 $$\n$$ p_{\\max} = r_{\\text{obs}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_T}\\right)_{\\max} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{D_T^{\\text{obs}} / B_T}{D_1^{\\text{obs}} / B_1} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{c_{1,\\max}}{c_{T,\\min}} - 1 $$\nA decline in MMR from year $1$ to year $T$ corresponds to a proportional change less than $0$. The observed decline is considered robust to underreporting if, even under the worst-case scenario for the adjustment, the proportional change remains negative. The worst-case scenario (i.e., the one that most counteracts the decline) is the one that yields the maximum proportional change, $p_{\\max}$. Therefore, the robustness condition is simply:\n$$ p_{\\max} < 0 $$\nThe computational procedure for each study population is as follows:\n1.  Extract the initial and final year birth and death counts: $B_1, D_1^{\\text{obs}}, B_T, D_T^{\\text{obs}}$.\n2.  Extract the bounds for the completeness intervals: $c_{1,\\min}, c_{1,\\max}, c_{T,\\min}, c_{T,\\max}$.\n3.  Calculate $r_{\\text{obs}} = (D_T^{\\text{obs}} / B_T) / (D_1^{\\text{obs}} / B_1)$.\n4.  Calculate $p_{\\min}$ and $p_{\\max}$ using the derived formulas above.\n5.  Determine the boolean robustness indicator by checking if $p_{\\max} < 0$.\n6.  Round $p_{\\min}$ and $p_{\\max}$ to $6$ decimal places and report the triplet $[p_{\\min}, p_{\\max}, \\text{robustness}]$. This procedure is applied systematically to all provided test cases.",
