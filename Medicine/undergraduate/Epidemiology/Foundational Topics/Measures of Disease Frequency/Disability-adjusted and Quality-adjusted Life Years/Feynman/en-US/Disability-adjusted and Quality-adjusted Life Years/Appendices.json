It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and public health metrics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for the calculation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($DALYs$), a standard health metric, based on provided data for fatal and non-fatal disease burden. The assumptions of no time discounting and no age-weighting simplify the standard $DALY$ formula to a direct summation, making the problem tractable and well-defined.\n\nThe total $DALYs$ for a given condition in a population is the sum of the Years of Life Lost ($YLL$) due to premature mortality and the Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$) due to the non-fatal health consequences of the condition.\n$$DALYs = YLL + YLD$$\nWe will calculate each component separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the $YLL$. The $YLL$ is calculated by summing, over all age groups, the number of deaths in each group ($D_i$) multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death for that group ($L_i$). The problem provides data for $6$ age groups.\nThe formula for $YLL$ is:\n$$YLL = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} D_i L_i$$\nWe are given the following data for deaths and life expectancy:\n- Age group $1$ ($0$–$4$ years): $D_{1} = 120$ deaths, $L_{1} = 84.0$ years.\n- Age group $2$ ($5$–$14$ years): $D_{2} = 50$ deaths, $L_{2} = 76.5$ years.\n- Age group $3$ ($15$–$44$ years): $D_{3} = 800$ deaths, $L_{3} = 57.5$ years.\n- Age group $4$ ($45$–$64$ years): $D_{4} = 1600$ deaths, $L_{4} = 33.0$ years.\n- Age group $5$ ($65$–$84$ years): $D_{5} = 3000$ deaths, $L_{5} = 12.5$ years.\n- Age group $6$ ($\\geq 85$ years): $D_{6} = 2200$ deaths, $L_{6} = 4.5$ years.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $YLL$:\n$$YLL = (120 \\times 84.0) + (50 \\times 76.5) + (800 \\times 57.5) + (1600 \\times 33.0) + (3000 \\times 12.5) + (2200 \\times 4.5)$$\n$$YLL = 10080 + 3825 + 46000 + 52800 + 37500 + 9900$$\n$$YLL = 160105 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, we compute the $YLD$. For a prevalence-based calculation, $YLD$ is the sum of the products of the prevalent person-years ($P_j$) for each non-fatal health state (sequela $j$) and its corresponding disability weight ($w_j$). The disability weight is a value between $0$ (perfect health) and $1$ (equivalent to death).\nThe formula for $YLD$ is:\n$$YLD = \\sum_{j} P_j w_j$$\nWe are given the following data for four mutually exclusive sequelae:\n- Sequela A: $P_{A} = 200000$ person-years, $w_{A} = 0.05$.\n- Sequela B: $P_{B} = 80000$ person-years, $w_{B} = 0.20$.\n- Sequela C: $P_{C} = 25000$ person-years, $w_{C} = 0.50$.\n- Sequela D: $P_{D} = 10000$ person-years, $w_{D} = 0.35$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $YLD$:\n$$YLD = (200000 \\times 0.05) + (80000 \\times 0.20) + (25000 \\times 0.50) + (10000 \\times 0.35)$$\n$$YLD = 10000 + 16000 + 12500 + 3500$$\n$$YLD = 42000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, the total $DALYs$ are the sum of $YLL$ and $YLD$:\n$$DALYs = YLL + YLD = 160105 + 42000 = 202105$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

It uses standard metrics like prevalence, disability weights, and YLD, all central to burden of disease calculations. The multiplicative model for comorbidity and the use of the inclusion-exclusion principle are standard, well-tested methodologies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. All necessary data points ($N$, prevalences, disability weights) and methodological definitions (comorbidity model, YLD calculation) are provided. The objective is to compute a single, uniquely determined numerical value. The given prevalences are internally consistent (e.g., $p_{ABC} \\leq p_{AB} \\leq p_{A}$, which holds for the given values: $0.02 \\leq 0.06 \\leq 0.18$).\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally complete, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total one-year Years Lived with Disability (YLD) is the sum, over all individuals in the population, of the disability weight they experience multiplied by the duration of the disability, which is $1$ year for all cases here. A more practical approach is to partition the population into mutually exclusive health states, calculate the number of people in each state, and sum the YLD contributions from each state.\n\nThe total YLD is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = \\sum_{j} N_{j} \\times w_{j} \\times T_{j} $$\nwhere the sum is over all distinct health states $j$, $N_j$ is the number of people in state $j$, $w_j$ is the disability weight for state $j$, and $T_j$ is the time lived in that state. Here, $T_j = 1$ year for all states, and $N_j = N \\times p_j$, where $p_j$ is the prevalence of the mutually exclusive state $j$.\n\nThe health states are: having only condition $A$, only $B$, only $C$; having only $A$ and $B$; only $A$ and $C$; only $B$ and $C$; and having all three $A$, $B$, and $C$. The state of being perfectly healthy has a disability weight of $0$ and thus does not contribute to the YLD total.\n\n**1. Calculate Prevalences of Mutually Exclusive Health States**\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the prevalence of each mutually exclusive health state from the given overall prevalences. Let $p_{A \\text{ only}}$, $p_{B \\text{ only}}$, etc., denote the prevalences of these states.\n\n- Prevalence of having only condition $A$:\n$p_{A \\text{ only}} = p_{A} - p_{AB} - p_{AC} + p_{ABC} = 0.18 - 0.06 - 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.09$\n\n- Prevalence of having only condition $B$:\n$p_{B \\text{ only}} = p_{B} - p_{AB} - p_{BC} + p_{ABC} = 0.12 - 0.06 - 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.04$\n\n- Prevalence of having only condition $C$:\n$p_{C \\text{ only}} = p_{C} - p_{AC} - p_{BC} + p_{ABC} = 0.10 - 0.05 - 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.03$\n\n- Prevalence of having only conditions $A$ and $B$:\n$p_{AB \\text{ only}} = p_{AB} - p_{ABC} = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04$\n\n- Prevalence of having only conditions $A$ and $C$:\n$p_{AC \\text{ only}} = p_{AC} - p_{ABC} = 0.05 - 0.02 = 0.03$\n\n- Prevalence of having only conditions $B$ and $C$:\n$p_{BC \\text{ only}} = p_{BC} - p_{ABC} = 0.04 - 0.02 = 0.02$\n\n- Prevalence of having all three conditions $A$, $B$, and $C$ is given directly:\n$p_{ABC} = 0.02$\n\n**2. Calculate Disability Weights for Comorbid States**\nThe problem specifies an \"independent multiplicative loss of full health\". This implies that for co-occurring conditions, the combined disability weight $w_{comb}$ is calculated from the remaining health levels ($1 - w_i$).\n$$ w_{comb} = 1 - \\prod_{i \\in \\text{set of conditions}} (1 - w_i) $$\nGiven weights: $w_A = 0.30$, $w_B = 0.20$, $w_C = 0.15$.\n\n- Disability weight for comorbidity of $A$ and $B$:\n$w_{AB} = 1 - (1 - w_A)(1 - w_B) = 1 - (1 - 0.30)(1 - 0.20) = 1 - (0.70)(0.80) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44$\n\n- Disability weight for comorbidity of $A$ and $C$:\n$w_{AC} = 1 - (1 - w_A)(1 - w_C) = 1 - (1 - 0.30)(1 - 0.15) = 1 - (0.70)(0.85) = 1 - 0.595 = 0.405$\n\n- Disability weight for comorbidity of $B$ and $C$:\n$w_{BC} = 1 - (1 - w_B)(1 - w_C) = 1 - (1 - 0.20)(1 - 0.15) = 1 - (0.80)(0.85) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32$\n\n- Disability weight for comorbidity of $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n$w_{ABC} = 1 - (1 - w_A)(1 - w_B)(1 - w_C) = 1 - (0.70)(0.80)(0.85) = 1 - (0.56)(0.85) = 1 - 0.476 = 0.524$\n\n**3. Calculate Total YLD**\nTotal YLD is the sum of YLDs from each mutually exclusive health state, over the population $N = 250,000$ and time $T = 1$ year.\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = N \\times T \\times \\sum_{j} (p_j \\times w_j) $$\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = 250,000 \\times 1 \\times [ (p_{A \\text{ only}} \\times w_A) + (p_{B \\text{ only}} \\times w_B) + (p_{C \\text{ only}} \\times w_C) + (p_{AB \\text{ only}} \\times w_{AB}) + (p_{AC \\text{ only}} \\times w_{AC}) + (p_{BC \\text{ only}} \\times w_{BC}) + (p_{ABC} \\times w_{ABC}) ] $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = 250,000 \\times [ (0.09 \\times 0.30) + (0.04 \\times 0.20) + (0.03 \\times 0.15) + (0.04 \\times 0.44) + (0.03 \\times 0.405) + (0.02 \\times 0.32) + (0.02 \\times 0.524) ] $$\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = 250,000 \\times [ 0.027 + 0.008 + 0.0045 + 0.0176 + 0.01215 + 0.0064 + 0.01048 ] $$\nThe sum of the terms in the bracket is the population's average disability burden per person-year.\n$$ \\text{Sum} = 0.08613 $$\n$$ \\text{Total YLD} = 250,000 \\times 0.08613 = 21,532.5 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\n**4.
