To move beyond a purely theoretical understanding, this exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to quantify the magnitude of confounding bias.

            "problem": "A prospective cohort study examines the relationship between a binary exposure $E$ (exposed versus unexposed) and a binary outcome $Y$ (event versus no event). There exists a binary confounder $C$ that is differentially distributed across exposure groups and affects the outcome multiplicatively. Let $P(C=1 \\mid E=1) = 0.60$ and $P(C=1 \\mid E=0) = 0.20$. The risk of $Y$ in the unexposed without the confounder is $R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=0) = 0.05$. The confounder increases the risk of $Y$, and there is no interaction between $E$ and $C$ on the relative risk scale. Specifically, the relative risk for $Y$ comparing subjects with $C=1$ to those with $C=0$ is constant within strata of $E$, given by $RR_{YC} = \\frac{R(Y=1 \\mid E, C=1)}{R(Y=1 \\mid E, C=0)} = 3.0$.\n\nAssume there is no causal effect of $E$ on $Y$ (the true relative risk of $E$ on $Y$ is $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the signed confounding bias, $B$, for an observed relative risk, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$. The bias is defined as $B = RR_{\\text{obs}} - RR_{\\text{true}}$. We are given that the true relative risk, $RR_{\\text{true}}$, is $1$. The observed relative risk is the marginal (crude) risk ratio comparing the exposed group to the unexposed group.\n\nLet $E$ be the binary exposure variable, where $E=1$ for exposed and $E=0$ for unexposed. Let $Y$ be the binary outcome variable, where $Y=1$ for an event and $Y=0$ for no event. Let $C$ be the binary confounder, where $C=1$ for presence and $C=0$ for absence of the confounder.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  Prevalence of the confounder in the exposed group: $P(C=1 \\mid E=1) = 0.60$.\n2.  Prevalence of the confounder in the unexposed group: $P(C=1 \\mid E=0) = 0.20$.\n3.  Risk of the outcome in the unexposed group without the confounder: $R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=0) = 0.05$.\n4.  The relative risk of the outcome associated with the confounder is constant across exposure strata: $RR_{YC} = \\frac{R(Y=1 \\mid E, C=1)}{R(Y=1 \\mid E, C=0)} = 3.0$.\n5.  There is no causal effect of the exposure on the outcome, meaning the true, stratum-specific relative risk is unity: $RR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{R(Y=1 \\mid E=1, C)}{R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C)} = 1$. The condition of no interaction on the relative risk scale implies this value is constant across strata of $C$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate $B = RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1$, where $RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{R(Y=1 \\mid E=1)}{R(Y=1 \\mid E=0)}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the four stratum-specific risks, denoted as $R_{ec} = R(Y=1 \\mid E=e, C=c)$.\nThe baseline risk is given:\n$R_{00} = R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=0) = 0.05$.\n\nUsing the true relative risk $RR_{\\text{true}}=1$, we find the risk for the exposed group without the confounder:\n$R_{10} = R(Y=1 \\mid E=1, C=0) = R_{00} \\times RR_{\\text{true}} = 0.05 \\times 1 = 0.05$.\n\nUsing the relative risk associated with the confounder, $RR_{YC}=3.0$, we find the risks for subjects with the confounder. For the unexposed group:\n$R_{01} = R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=1) = R_{00} \\times RR_{YC} = 0.05 \\times 3.0 = 0.15$.\n\nFor the exposed group:\n$R_{11} = R(Y=1 \\mid E=1, C=1) = R_{10} \\times RR_{YC} = 0.05 \\times 3.0 = 0.15$.\nThis is consistent with $RR_{\\text{true}}=1$ for the $C=1$ stratum, as $R_{11}/R_{01} = 0.15/0.15 = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the marginal risks for the exposed and unexposed groups using the law of total probability. The marginal risk in a group is the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks, where the weights are the prevalences of the confounder in that group.\n\nThe marginal risk in the unexposed group, $R_0 = R(Y=1 \\mid E=0)$, is:\n$$R_0 = R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=0)P(C=0 \\mid E=0) + R(Y=1 \\mid E=0, C=1)P(C=1 \\mid E=0)$$\nWe are given $P(C=1 \\mid E=0) = 0.20$, so $P(C=0 \\mid E=0) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_0 = R_{00} \\times (1 - P(C=1 \\mid E=0)) + R_{01} \\times P(C=1 \\mid E=0)$$\n$$R_0 = (0.05)(0.80) + (0.15)(0.20)$$\n$$R_0 = 0.04 + 0.03 = 0.07$$\n\nSimilarly, the marginal risk in the exposed group, $R_1 = R(Y=1 \\mid E=1)$, is:\n$$R_1 = R(Y=1 \\mid E=1, C=0)P(C=0 \\mid E=1) + R(Y=1 \\mid E=1, C=1)P(C=1 \\mid E=1)$$\nWe are given $P(C=1 \\mid E=1) = 0.60$, so $P(C=0 \\mid E=1) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_1 = R_{10} \\times (1 - P(C=1 \\mid E=1)) + R_{11} \\times P(C=1 \\mid E=1)$$\n$$R_1 = (0.05)(0.40) + (0.15)(0.60)$$\n$$R_1 = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11$$\n\nNow, we can compute the observed relative risk, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{0.11}{0.07} = \\frac{11}{7}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the signed confounding bias, $B$:\n$$B = RR_{\\text{obs}} - RR_{\\text{true}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{11}{7} - 1 = \\frac{11}{7} - \\frac{7}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}$$\n\nTo provide the numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n$$B = \\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.57142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5714$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond confounding, another major threat to the validity of an epidemiological study is selection bias, which occurs when the process of selecting participants into the study is related to both the exposure and the outcome. This practice problem illustrates a classic form of selection bias known as Berkson's bias, often encountered in hospital-based case-control studies. You will see how a seemingly reasonable choice of controls can lead to a dramatically incorrect conclusion, even reversing the direction of an association .",
            "id": "4617319",
            "problem": "A research team is designing a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the association between an exposure and a disease. Let the binary exposure be denoted by $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and the binary disease be denoted by $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Let $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate hospital admission during the study period. Cases are defined as hospital patients with $D=1$ and controls are other hospital patients with $D=0$. The team is aware of Berkson’s bias, which can arise when hospital controls have admission probabilities that depend on exposure.\n\nIn the source population, suppose the disease risks are $P(D=1 \\mid E=1)=0.06$ and $P(D=1 \\mid E=0)=0.03$, and cases with the disease ($D=1$) are admitted to the hospital with equal probability regardless of exposure, i.e., $P(S=1 \\mid D=1, E=1)=1$ and $P(S=1 \\mid D=1, E=0)=1$. However, among non-diseased individuals ($D=0$), admission depends on exposure due to unrelated conditions: $P(S=1 \\mid D=0, E=1)=0.20$ and $P(S=1 \\mid D=0, E=0)=0.05$.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of the Odds Ratio (OR) as the ratio of odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls, and from the rules of probability (including Bayes’ rule), derive the hospital-based observed odds ratio, $OR_{\\text{obs}}$, in this setting. In your derivation, explicitly identify how the differential admission probabilities among hospital controls generate Berkson’s bias and determine its direction relative to the true source-population odds ratio.\n\nProvide your final answer as the exact value of $OR_{\\text{obs}}$ (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the observed odds ratio ($OR_{\\text{obs}}$) in a hospital-based case-control study and an analysis of Berkson's bias. We will proceed by first calculating the true odds ratio in the source population, then deriving the observed odds ratio using the provided admission probabilities, and finally comparing the two to characterize the bias.\n\nLet the variables be defined as given:\n- $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for exposure status.\n- $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for disease status.\n- $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for hospital admission status.\n\nThe given probabilities are:\n- $P(D=1 \\mid E=1) = 0.06$\n- $P(D=1 \\mid E=0) = 0.03$\n- $P(S=1 \\mid D=1, E=1) = 1$\n- $P(S=1 \\mid D=1, E=0) = 1$\n- $P(S=1 \\mid D=0, E=1) = 0.20$\n- $P(S=1 \\mid D=0, E=0) = 0.05$\n\nFrom these, we can derive the probabilities of being non-diseased:\n- $P(D=0 \\mid E=1) = 1 - P(D=1 \\mid E=1) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$\n- $P(D=0 \\mid E=0) = 1 - P(D=1 \\mid E=0) = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$\n\nFirst, let us calculate the true odds ratio ($OR_{\\text{true}}$) in the source population. This is the ratio of the odds of disease among the exposed to the odds of disease among the unexposed.\n$$OR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{P(D=1 \\mid E=1) / P(D=0 \\mid E=1)}{P(D=1 \\mid E=0) / P(D=0 \\mid E=0)}$$\nSubstituting the given and derived values:\n$$OR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{0.06 / 0.94}{0.03 / 0.97} = \\frac{0.06 \\times 0.97}{0.03 \\times 0.94} = 2 \\times \\frac{0.97}{0.94} = \\frac{1.94}{0.94} = \\frac{194}{94} = \\frac{97}{47}$$\nThe true odds ratio is greater than $1$, indicating a positive association between the exposure and the disease in the source population.\n\nNext, we derive the observed odds ratio ($OR_{\\text{obs}}$) from the hospital-based study. The problem defines this as the ratio of the odds of exposure among hospital cases to the odds of exposure among hospital controls.\n- Hospital cases are individuals with $D=1$ and $S=1$.\n- Hospital controls are individuals with $D=0$ and $S=1$.\n\nThe observed odds ratio is:\n$$OR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=1, S=1)}{\\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=0, S=1)} = \\frac{P(E=1 \\mid D=1, S=1) / P(E=0 \\mid D=1, S=1)}{P(E=1 \\mid D=0, S=1) / P(E=0 \\mid D=0, S=1)}$$\n\nWe need to find the odds of exposure for cases and controls within the hospital population ($S=1$). We use Bayes' rule to relate these conditional probabilities to the given probabilities. For a given disease status $D$, the odds of exposure among hospitalized individuals is:\n$$ \\frac{P(E=1 \\mid D, S=1)}{P(E=0 \\mid D, S=1)} = \\frac{P(S=1 \\mid E=1, D) P(E=1, D) / P(S=1, D)}{P(S=1 \\mid E=0, D) P(E=0, D) / P(S=1, D)} $$\n$$ = \\frac{P(S=1 \\mid E=1, D) P(D \\mid E=1) P(E=1)}{P(S=1 \\mid E=0, D) P(D \\mid E=0) P(E=0)} $$\nLet $p_e = P(E=1)$ be the prevalence of exposure in the source population, so $P(E=0) = 1-p_e$. The expression for the odds of exposure becomes:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D, S=1) = \\frac{P(S=1 \\mid E=1, D) P(D \\mid E=1)}{P(S=1 \\mid E=0, D) P(D \\mid E=0)} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} $$\n\nFor the hospital cases ($D=1, S=1$):\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=1, S=1) = \\frac{P(S=1 \\mid E=1, D=1) P(D=1 \\mid E=1)}{P(S=1 \\mid E=0, D=1) P(D=1 \\mid E=0)} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=1, S=1) = \\frac{(1)(0.06)}{(1)(0.03)} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} = 2 \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} $$\n\nFor the hospital controls ($D=0, S=1$):\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=0, S=1) = \\frac{P(S=1 \\mid E=1, D=0) P(D=0 \\mid E=1)}{P(S=1 \\mid E=0, D=0) P(D=0 \\mid E=0)} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} $$\nSubstituting the given and derived values:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E=1 \\mid D=0, S=1) = \\frac{(0.20)(0.94)}{(0.05)(0.97)} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} = \\frac{0.188}{0.0485} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e} $$\n\nNow, we calculate $OR_{\\text{obs}}$ by taking the ratio of these two odds. The term $\\frac{p_e}{1-p_e}$ cancels out, showing that the result is independent of the exposure prevalence in the source population.\n$$ OR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e}}{\\frac{0.188}{0.0485} \\times \\frac{p_e}{1-p_e}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{0.188}{0.0485}} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.0485}{0.188} = \\frac{0.097}{0.188} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$ OR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{97 \\times 10^{-3}}{188 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{97}{188} $$\nSince $97$ is a prime number and $188 = 2 \\times 94$ is not a multiple of $97$, this fraction is irreducible.\n\nFinally, we analyze the bias. The true odds ratio is $OR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{97}{47} \\approx 2.06$, indicating that the exposure is a risk factor for the disease. The observed odds ratio is $OR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{97}{188} \\approx 0.52$, which spuriously suggests that the exposure is protective.\n\nThis discrepancy is a result of Berkson's bias, a form of selection bias. The bias arises because admission to the hospital (selection into the study) is associated with the exposure, but this association differs between cases and controls.\nThe relationship between the observed and true odds ratio can be explicitly stated as:\n$$ OR_{\\text{obs}} = \\left( \\frac{P(S=1|D=1,E=1)/P(S=1|D=1,E=0)}{P(S=1|D=0,E=1)/P(S=1|D=0,E=0)} \\right) \\times OR_{\\text{true}} $$\nLet's calculate the bias factor in the parentheses:\n- For cases ($D=1$), the ratio of admission probabilities is $\\frac{P(S=1|D=1,E=1)}{P(S=1|D=1,E=0)} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n- For controls ($D=0$), the ratio of admission probabilities is $\\frac{P(S=1|D=0,E=1)}{P(S=1|D=0,E=0)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.05} = 4$.\n\nThe bias factor is $\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\nTherefore, $OR_{\\text{obs}} = 0.25 \\times OR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{97}{47} = \\frac{97}{188}$. This is consistent with our direct calculation.\n\nThe differential admission probability for the control group is the source of the bias. Un-diseased individuals with the exposure ($E=1, D=0$) are four times more likely to be hospitalized than un-diseased individuals without the exposure ($E=0, D=0$). This leads to an over-representation of exposed individuals in the hospital-based control group compared to the source population of non-diseased individuals. This inflation of exposure prevalence among controls artificially drives the observed odds ratio down, creating a spurious protective effect and reversing the direction of the true association. The direction of the bias is towards the null and beyond, from a risk factor ($OR > 1$) to a protective factor ($OR < 1$).",

            "solution": "We start from fundamental definitions in causal graphical models. In a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a path between variables $X$ and $Y$ is “backdoor” if it starts with an arrow into $X$. A set of variables $S$ satisfies the backdoor criterion for the effect of $X$ on $Y$ if $S$ blocks all backdoor paths from $X$ to $Y$ and does not include any descendants of $X$. Blocking uses d-separation: conditioning on a non-collider blocks a path; conditioning on a collider opens a path only if we condition on the collider or its descendant. The total effect of $X$ on $Y$ should include all directed causal pathways from $X$ to $Y$. The controlled direct effect (CDE) of $X$ on $Y$ with respect to $M$ aims to remove the mediated pathway through $M$, which in an observational analysis corresponds to conditioning on $M$ at a fixed value and still blocking any backdoor confounding.\n\nGiven the DAG with edges $C \\rightarrow X$, $C \\rightarrow Y$, $X \\rightarrow M$, and $M \\rightarrow Y$, enumerate the relevant paths from $X$ to $Y$:\n\n- The causal (frontdoor) path $X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$ carries part or all of the effect via the mediator $M$.\n- The backdoor path $X \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow Y$ represents confounding due to $C$.\n\nThere are no colliders among $X$, $Y$, $C$, and $M$ in the specified structure, and $M$ is a descendant of $X$.\n\nFor the total effect:\n- We must block backdoor confounding while preserving the causal pathway $X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$. The minimal set that blocks the backdoor path $X \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow Y$ is $\\{C\\}$ because conditioning on $C$ d-separates $X$ and $Y$ along that path. Including $M$ is not appropriate under the backdoor criterion because $M$ is a descendant of $X$; conditioning on a descendant of $X$ can bias total effect estimation by blocking part of the effect and, in more complex DAGs, by creating spurious associations. Therefore, for the total effect, the minimal sufficient adjustment set is $\\{C\\}$.\n\nFor the controlled direct effect:\n- The goal is to remove the mediated pathway through $M$ while still addressing confounding. In an observational analysis, conditioning on $M$ removes the path $X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$ (because conditioning on $M$ blocks that directed path by fixing $M$), and conditioning on $C$ blocks the backdoor path $X \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow Y$. The minimal set that accomplishes both is $\\{C, M\\}$.

Total effect: $\\{\\}$; Direct effect: $\\{M\\}$. For the total effect, adjusting for no variables leaves the confounding path $X \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow Y$ open, leading to confounded estimation. For the direct effect, adjusting only for $M$ blocks the mediator pathway but leaves the confounding path through $C$ open; the resulting estimate is confounded. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Total effect: $\\{M\\}$; Direct effect: $\\{C, M\\}$. For the total effect, adjusting for $M$ blocks the causal path $X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$, removing mediated effects and biasing the total effect estimate; additionally, it fails to block the backdoor path $X \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow Y$. For the direct effect, $\\{C, M\\}$ is appropriate, but the first component is incorrect, so the pair is not correct. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Total effect: $\\{C\\}$; Direct effect: $\\{\\}$.
