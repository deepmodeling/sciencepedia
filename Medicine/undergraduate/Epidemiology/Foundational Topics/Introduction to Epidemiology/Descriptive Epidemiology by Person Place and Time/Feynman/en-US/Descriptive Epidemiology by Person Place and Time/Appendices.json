A foundational skill is calculating these rates, but a crucial lesson is understanding the dangers of oversimplification. This first practice  illustrates Simpson's Paradox, a fascinating statistical phenomenon where a trend observed within separate groups reverses when the groups are combined, demonstrating how ignoring a key variable like age can lead to entirely wrong conclusions.",

            "problem": "A cohort study is conducted in a single metropolitan area over $1$ continuous year to assess the incidence of a respiratory condition among two occupational person-groups: manual laborers and office workers. The study reports fully stratified data by age stratum. Person-time is recorded in person-years (PY), defined as the sum over individuals of time-at-risk contributions during the $1$-year window. The research team intends to compare the two groups on an overall (marginal) incidence rate but emphasizes that the comparison should be constructed from first principles of descriptive epidemiology by person, place, and time.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of incidence rate, additivity of incident counts over disjoint strata, and additivity of person-time over disjoint strata, derive a symbolic expression for the overall incidence rate in a group as a function of its stratum-specific quantities. Then, using the derived procedure, compute the aggregated rate ratio comparing manual laborers to office workers.\n\nData for incident case counts and person-time by age stratum are:\n\n- Office workers: Young ($18$–$39$): cases $= 1$, PY $= 1000$; Middle-aged ($40$–$64$): cases $= 25$, PY $= 5000$; Older ($\\geq 65$): cases $= 100$, PY $= 10000$.\n- Manual laborers: Young ($18$–$39$): cases $= 12$, PY $= 10000$; Middle-aged ($40$–$64$): cases $= 30$, PY $= 5000$; Older ($\\geq 65$): cases $= 12$, PY $= 1000$.\n\nLet the overall incidence rate in group $g$ be denoted $r_{g}$, the stratum-specific incident counts by $y_{g j}$, and the stratum-specific person-time by $T_{g j}$, where $j$ indexes the age strata. After deriving the general expression for $r_{g}$ in terms of $\\{y_{g j}, T_{g j}\\}$, apply it to compute the aggregated rate ratio $RR = r_{\\text{Manual}} / r_{\\text{Office}}$.

The scenario, data, and requested calculations are standard and realistic. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Overall Incidence Rate\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a symbolic expression for the overall incidence rate in a group, $r_g$, starting from first principles.\n\nThe incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases of a disease occurring in a specified population over a specified period of time, divided by the total person-time of observation for that population. The overall, or crude, incidence rate for a group $g$ is denoted $r_g$. It is calculated as the total number of incident cases in group $g$, let's call this $Y_g$, divided by the total person-time at risk for group $g$, which we can call $T_g$.\n$$r_g = \\frac{Y_g}{T_g}$$\nThe problem states that the study data are fully stratified by age, with index $j$ representing the strata. It also states that incident counts and person-time are additive over disjoint strata. This is a fundamental principle in epidemiology: the total number of cases in a group is the sum of the cases in all its disjoint subgroups (strata), and likewise for person-time.\n\nGiven the stratum-specific incident counts $y_{gj}$ and stratum-specific person-time $T_{gj}$, the total number of cases $Y_g$ and total person-time $T_g$ for group $g$ are obtained by summing over all strata $j$:\n$$Y_g = \\sum_{j} y_{gj}$$\n$$T_g = \\sum_{j} T_{gj}$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the definition of the overall incidence rate $r_g$ yields the required symbolic expression:\n$$r_g = \\frac{\\sum_{j} y_{gj}}{\\sum_{j} T_{gj}}$$\nThis formula represents the overall (aggregated or crude) incidence rate for a group as a function of its stratum-specific quantities.\n\n### Computation of the Aggregated Rate Ratio\n\nThe next step is to apply this derived formula to the provided data for the two groups, office workers and manual laborers, and then compute the aggregated rate ratio $RR$.\n\nLet the groups be denoted $g = \\text{Office}$ and $g = \\text{Manual}$. Let the strata be indexed by $j=1$ (Young), $j=2$ (Middle-aged), and $j=3$ (Older).\n\nFor the office workers group, the overall incidence rate $r_{\\text{Office}}$ is:\n$$r_{\\text{Office}} = \\frac{y_{\\text{Office}, 1} + y_{\\text{Office}, 2} + y_{\\text{Office}, 3}}{T_{\\text{Office}, 1} + T_{\\text{Office}, 2} + T_{\\text{Office}, 3}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$r_{\\text{Office}} = \\frac{1 + 25 + 100}{1000 + 5000 + 10000} = \\frac{126}{16000}$$\n\nFor the manual laborers group, the overall incidence rate $r_{\\text{Manual}}$ is:\n$$r_{\\text{Manual}} = \\frac{y_{\\text{Manual}, 1} + y_{\\text{Manual}, 2} + y_{\\text{Manual}, 3}}{T_{\\text{Manual}, 1} + T_{\\text{Manual}, 2} + T_{\\text{Manual}, 3}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$r_{\\text{Manual}} = \\frac{12 + 30 + 12}{10000 + 5000 + 1000} = \\frac{54}{16000}$$\n\nThe aggregated rate ratio, $RR$, is the ratio of the overall incidence rate in the manual laborer group to that in the office worker group:\n$$RR = \\frac{r_{\\text{Manual}}}{r_{\\text{Office}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated rates:\n$$RR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{54}{16000}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{126}{16000}\\right)}$$\nThe common denominator of $16000$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to the ratio of the total case counts:\n$$RR = \\frac{54}{126}$$\nTo express this fraction in lowest terms, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator.\nBoth $54$ and $126$ are even, so dividing by $2$:\n$$RR = \\frac{54 \\div 2}{126 \\div 2} = \\frac{27}{63}$$\nBoth $27$ and $63$ are multiples of $9$:\n$$RR = \\frac{27 \\div 9}{63 \\div 9} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{3}{7}$ is in lowest terms as $3$ and $7$ are prime numbers.",

The core of the analysis is to compare the crude secular trend with the age-adjusted trend to understand the impact of a changing population age structure, a phenomenon known as confounding. We will proceed by rigorously applying the definitions of crude and age-adjusted incidence rates.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age stratum, where $i=1$ for ages $0$–$39$, $i=2$ for ages $40$–$64$, and $i=3$ for ages $\\geq 65$. Let $y$ denote the year, either $2005$ or $2025$.\nLet $C_{i,y}$ be the number of incident cases in stratum $i$ and year $y$.\nLet $N_{i,y}$ be the mid-year population in stratum $i$ and year $y$.\nThe provided data is as follows:\nFor year $y=2005$:\n$C_{1,2005} = 300$, $N_{1,2005} = 600,000$\n$C_{2,2005} = 600$, $N_{2,2005} = 300,000$\n$C_{3,2005} = 800$, $N_{3,2005} = 100,000$\n\nFor year $y=2025$:\n$C_{1,2025} = 160$, $N_{1,2025} = 400,000$\n$C_{2,2025} = 560$, $N_{2,2025} = 350,000$\n$C_{3,2025} = 1,600$, $N_{3,2025} = 250,000$\n\nAll rates are to be expressed per $100,000$ person-years.\n\n### 1. Crude Incidence Rates\n\nThe crude incidence rate ($CIR_y$) for a specific year is the total number of new cases divided by the total mid-year population, multiplied by $100,000$.\n$$CIR_y = \\frac{\\sum_{i} C_{i,y}}{\\sum_{i} N_{i,y}} \\times 100,000$$\n\nFor year $2005$:\nTotal cases: $C_{2005} = \\sum_{i} C_{i,2005} = 300 + 600 + 800 = 1,700$.\nTotal population: $N_{2005} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,2005} = 600,000 + 300,000 + 100,000 = 1,000,000$.\nThe crude incidence rate for $2005$ is:\n$$CIR_{2005} = \\frac{1,700}{1,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 170 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nFor year $2025$:\nTotal cases: $C_{2025} = \\sum_{i} C_{i,2025} = 160 + 560 + 1,600 = 2,320$.\nTotal population: $N_{2025} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,2025} = 400,000 + 350,000 + 250,000 = 1,000,000$.\nThe crude incidence rate for $2025$ is:\n$$CIR_{2025} = \\frac{2,320}{1,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 232 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\nBased on crude rates, the incidence appears to have increased from $170$ to $232$ per $100,000$ between $2005$ and $2025$.\n\n### 2. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates\n\nTo account for the change in the age distribution of the population, we use direct standardization. This involves calculating what the crude rate would have been in each year if the populations had a \"standard\" age structure.\n\nFirst, we define the standard population as the sum of the populations from both years for each age stratum. Let $N_{i,std}$ be the standard population for stratum $i$.\n$$N_{1,std} = N_{1,2005} + N_{1,2025} = 600,000 + 400,000 = 1,000,000$$\n$$N_{2,std} = N_{2,2005} + N_{2,2025} = 300,000 + 350,000 = 650,000$$\n$$N_{3,std} = N_{3,2005} + N_{3,2025} = 100,000 + 250,000 = 350,000$$\nThe total standard population is $N_{std} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,std} = 1,000,000 + 650,000 + 350,000 = 2,000,000$.\n\nNext, we compute the age-specific incidence rates ($ASIR_{i,y}$) for each stratum and year.\n$$ASIR_{i,y} = \\frac{C_{i,y}}{N_{i,y}}$$\nFor year $2005$:\n$ASIR_{1,2005} = \\frac{300}{600,000} = 0.0005$\n$ASIR_{2,2005} = \\frac{600}{300,000} = 0.0020$\n$ASIR_{3,2005} = \\frac{800}{100,000} = 0.0080$\n\nFor year $2025$:\n$ASIR_{1,2025} = \\frac{160}{400,000} = 0.0004$\n$ASIR_{2,2025} = \\frac{560}{350,000} = 0.0016$\n$ASIR_{3,2025} = \\frac{1,600}{250,000} = 0.0064$\n\nThe age-adjusted incidence rate ($AAIR_y$) is the sum of the expected number of cases in each stratum of the standard population, divided by the total standard population, and multiplied by $100,000$. The expected cases for a given year $y$ are calculated by applying its $ASIRs$ to the standard population strata.\n$$AAIR_y = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (ASIR_{i,y} \\times N_{i,std})}{\\sum_{i} N_{i,std}} \\times 100,000$$\n\nFor year $2005$:\nExpected cases $E_{2005} = (0.0005 \\times 1,000,000) + (0.0020 \\times 650,000) + (0.0080 \\times 350,000)$\n$E_{2005} = 500 + 1,300 + 2,800 = 4,600$\n$$AAIR_{2005} = \\frac{4,600}{2,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 230 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nFor year $2025$:\nExpected cases $E_{2025} = (0.0004 \\times 1,000,000) + (0.0016 \\times 650,000) + (0.0064 \\times 350,000)$\n$E_{2025} = 400 + 1,040 + 2,240 = 3,680$\n$$AAIR_{2025} = \\frac{3,680}{2,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 184 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nAfter adjusting for age, the incidence rate has actually decreased from $230$ to $184$ per $100,000$. The initial crude rate increase was misleading because the population of City Delta aged significantly between $2005$ and $2025$. The proportion of the population in the highest-risk age group ($\\geq 65$) increased from $10\\%$ ($100,000/1,000,000$) to $25\\%$ ($250,000/1,000,000$). Since incidence increases with age, this demographic shift inflated the crude rate for $2025$, masking a true decline in age-specific risk.\n\n### 3. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio\n\nThe age-adjusted incidence rate ratio ($IRR_{adj}$) compares the age-adjusted rates of $2025$ to $2005$.\n$$IRR_{adj} = \\frac{AAIR_{2025}}{AAIR_{2005}}$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$IRR_{adj} = \\frac{184}{230}$$\nThe calculation simplifies to:\n$$IRR_{adj} = \\frac{ \\frac{E_{2025}}{N_{std}} \\times 100,000 }{ \\frac{E_{2005}}{N_{std}} \\times 100,000 } = \\frac{E_{2025}}{E_{2005}} = \\frac{3,680}{4,600} = \\frac{368}{460} = \\frac{184}{230} = \\frac{92}{115} = 0.8$$\nThe result is exactly $0.8$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. This gives $0.8000$.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the ratio of the age-specific rates ($ASIR_{i,2025} / ASIR_{i,2005}$) is constant across all age strata:\n$0.0004/0.0005 = 0.8$\n$0.0016/0.0020 = 0.8$\n$0.0064/0.0080 = 0.8$\nWhen this condition of a constant rate ratio holds (no effect modification by age), the directly adjusted rate ratio will be equal to this common stratum-specific rate ratio, which is $0.8$.\nThe final answer is the decimal value of this ratio, expressed to four significant figures.",

The peak of this adjusted curve is the maximum value in this sequence.\n$$ \\text{Peak}_{adj\\_onset} = \\max(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, \\frac{3}{0.95}, 2.5) = 6 $$\n\nSecond, we construct the epidemic curve by report date. Let $N_{report}(T_R)$ be the number of cases reported on calendar day $T_R$. For each case, the report date is $T_R = t + \\delta$, where $t$ is the onset day and $\\delta$ is the reporting delay. We calculate the report date for every case in the line list:\n- Onset $1$, delays $\\{2, 1\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{3, 2\\}$\n- Onset $2$, delays $\\{0, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{2, 3, 5\\}$\n- Onset $3$, delays $\\{1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{4, 3, 4, 5\\}$\n- Onset $4$, delays $\\{1, 2, 0, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{5, 6, 4, 5, 7\\}$\n- Onset $5$, delays $\\{1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8\\}$\n- Onset $6$, delays $\\{2, 1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 7, 6, 7, 8\\}$\n- Onset $7$, delays $\\{1, 2, 2, 0\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 9, 9, 7\\}$\n- Onset $8$, delays $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 9, 10\\}$\n- Onset $9$, delays $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$\n- Onset $10$, delays $\\{1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{11, 12\\}$\n\nWe tally the number of cases for each report date $T_R$:\n- $N_{report}(1) = 0$\n- $N_{report}(2) = 2$\n- $N_{report}(3) = 3$\n- $N_{report}(4) = 3$\n- $N_{report}(5) = 5$\n- $N_{report}(6) = 5$\n- $N_{report}(7) = 5$\n- $N_{report}(8) = 5$\n- $N_{report}(9) = 3$\n- $N_{report}(10) = 2$\n- $N_{report}(11) = 2$\n- $N_{report}(12) = 2$\nThe epidemic curve by report date has a peak daily incidence of $5$ cases, which occurs on days $5, 6, 7,$ and $8$.\n$$ \\text{Peak}_{report} = 5 $$\n\nThird, we compute the required ratio of the peak of the adjusted onset curve to the peak of the report date curve.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Peak}_{adj\\_onset}}{\\text{Peak}_{report}} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 $$\nThe calculated ratio is $1.2$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, which is $1.200$.",
