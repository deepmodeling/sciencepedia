Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when a specific alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) is true.\n\n**1. Define Hypotheses and Parameters**\nThe null and alternative hypotheses are:\n$$H_0: p_1 = p_2$$\n$$H_A: p_1 \\neq p_2$$\nThe given parameters for the power calculation are:\n- True proportion in the intervention arm: $p_1 = 0.25$\n- True proportion in the control arm: $p_2 = 0.20$\n- Sample size per arm: $n_1 = n_2 = 500$\n- Significance level: $\\alpha = 0.05$\n\n**2. Determine the Rejection Region under the Null Hypothesis**\nThe test is based on the difference in sample proportions, $D = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$. Under the CLT, $D$ is approximately normally distributed.\n\nUnder $H_0$, the expected value of the difference is $E[D|H_0] = p_1 - p_2 = 0$. The variance of $D$ under $H_0$ is calculated assuming a common proportion, which the problem specifies to be $p_0$.\nLet's first calculate $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{n_1 p_1 + n_2 p_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \\frac{500(0.25) + 500(0.20)}{500 + 500} = \\frac{125 + 100}{1000} = \\frac{225}{1000} = 0.225$$\nThe standard error of the difference under the null hypothesis, $SE_0$, is:\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}$$\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{0.225(1-0.225)\\left(\\frac{1}{500} + \\frac{1}{500}\\right)} = \\sqrt{0.225(0.775)\\left(\\frac{2}{500}\\right)}$$\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{0.174375 \\times 0.004} = \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\nFor a two-sided test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$. The standard value used is approximately $1.96$. Using a more precise value, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.959964$.\nThe null hypothesis is rejected if the absolute value of the observed difference is greater than a critical threshold, $C$:\n$$|\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2| > z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0$$\nSo the rejection region is defined by two critical values:\n$$C_{upper} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0 \\approx 1.959964 \\times \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\n$$C_{lower} = -z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0 \\approx -1.959964 \\times \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\n\n**3. Characterize the Distribution under the Alternative Hypothesis**\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, the true proportions are $p_1 = 0.25$ and $p_2 = 0.20$.\nThe distribution of the difference $D = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ is approximately normal with:\n- Mean: $\\mu_A = E[D|H_A] = p_1 - p_2 = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05$\n- Standard Error ($SE_A$):\n$$SE_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$\n$$SE_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.25(0.75)}{500} + \\frac{0.20(0.80)}{500}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1875}{500} + \\frac{0.16}{500}}$$\n$$SE_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.3475}{500}} = \\sqrt{0.000695}$$\nSo, under $H_A$, we have $(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\sim N(\\mu_A = 0.05, SE_A^2 = 0.000695)$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Statistical Power**\nPower is the probability of the test statistic falling in the rejection region, given that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n$$\\text{Power} = P(D > C_{upper} | H_A) + P(D < C_{lower} | H_A)$$\nTo calculate these probabilities, we standardize the critical values $C_{upper}$ and $C_{lower}$ using the distribution under $H_A$:\n$$Z_{upper} = \\frac{C_{upper} - \\mu_A}{SE_A} = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} SE_0 - \\mu_A}{SE_A} = \\frac{1.959964 \\sqrt{0.0006975} - 0.05}{\\sqrt{0.000695}}$$\n$$Z_{lower} = \\frac{C_{lower} - \\mu_A}{SE_A} = \\frac{-z_{\\alpha/2} SE_0 - \\mu_A}{SE_A} = \\frac{-1.959964 \\sqrt{0.0006975} - 0.05}{\\sqrt{0.000695}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$SE_0 = \\sqrt{0.0006975} \\approx 0.0264098$\n$SE_A = \\sqrt{0.000695} \\approx 0.0263629$\n$\\mu_A = 0.05$\n$z_{\\alpha/2} \\approx 1.959964$\n\nThe numerator for $Z_{upper}$ is $(1.959964 \\times 0.0264098) - 0.05 \\approx 0.0517623 - 0.05 = 0.0017623$.\nThe numerator for $Z_{lower}$ is $(-1.959964 \\times 0.0264098) - 0.05 \\approx -0.0517623 - 0.05 = -0.1017623$.\n\n$$Z_{upper} \\approx \\frac{0.0017623}{0.0263629} \\approx 0.066848$$\n$$Z_{lower} \\approx \\frac{-0.1017623}{0.0263629} \\approx -3.85999$$\nThe power is the sum of the probabilities in the tails of the standard normal distribution:\n$$\\text{Power} = P(Z > 0.066848) + P(Z < -3.85999)$$\nwhere $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. Let $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n$$\\text{Power} = (1 - \\Phi(0.066848)) + \\Phi(-3.85999)$$\nUsing a standard normal CDF calculator:\n$\\Phi(0.066848) \\approx 0.52664$\n$\\Phi(-3.85999) \\approx 0.000057$\n\n$$\\text{Power} \\approx (1 - 0.52664) + 0.000057 = 0.47336 + 0.000057 = 0.473417$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.4734$.",
