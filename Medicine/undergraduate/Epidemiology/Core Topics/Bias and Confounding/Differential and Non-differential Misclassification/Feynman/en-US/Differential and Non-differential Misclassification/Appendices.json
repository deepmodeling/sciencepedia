However, these metrics don't tell the whole story. In practice, we often need to know the probability that a classification is correct, which is where Positive and Negative Predictive Values ($PPV$ and $NPV$) become crucial.

Field classification is performed via a questionnaire yielding an observed exposure $\\tilde{X} \\in \\{0,1\\}$. A validation substudy shows that this questionnaire has sensitivity $Se_X$ and specificity $Sp_X$ for classifying exposure relative to the biomarker gold standard, and that these properties do not differ by disease status (non-differential misclassification with respect to disease).

The non-differential nature of the misclassification is a key assumption that simplifies the analysis to the population level, as specified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to compute the positive predictive value ($PPV_X$) and the negative predictive value ($NPV_X$) of the exposure questionnaire. These are conditional probabilities that we will derive using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let us formally define the given parameters:\n-   Prevalence of true exposure: $P(X=1) = 0.30$.\n-   From this, the prevalence of true non-exposure is: $P(X=0) = 1 - P(X=1) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n-   Sensitivity of the questionnaire: $Se_X = P(\\tilde{X}=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.85$. This is the probability of being classified as exposed, given one is truly exposed.\n-   Specificity of the questionnaire: $Sp_X = P(\\tilde{X}=0 \\mid X=0) = 0.90$. This is the probability of being classified as unexposed, given one is truly unexposed.\n\nWe also need the probabilities of incorrect classification:\n-   The false negative rate is $P(\\tilde{X}=0 \\mid X=1) = 1 - Se_X = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n-   The false positive rate is $P(\\tilde{X}=1 \\mid X=0) = 1 - Sp_X = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV_X$)**\n\nThe positive predictive value is the probability that a subject is truly exposed given that they are classified as exposed, $PPV_X = P(X=1 \\mid \\tilde{X}=1)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$ PPV_X = P(X=1 \\mid \\tilde{X}=1) = \\frac{P(\\tilde{X}=1 \\mid X=1) P(X=1)}{P(\\tilde{X}=1)} $$\nThe term in the numerator is the joint probability $P(\\tilde{X}=1, X=1)$. The denominator, $P(\\tilde{X}=1)$, is the overall probability of being classified as exposed, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(\\tilde{X}=1) = P(\\tilde{X}=1 \\mid X=1) P(X=1) + P(\\tilde{X}=1 \\mid X=0) P(X=0) $$\nSubstituting the definitions for sensitivity and specificity:\n$$ P(\\tilde{X}=1) = (Se_X) \\cdot P(X=1) + (1 - Sp_X) \\cdot P(X=0) $$\nThus, the full expression for $PPV_X$ is:\n$$ PPV_X = \\frac{Se_X \\cdot P(X=1)}{Se_X \\cdot P(X=1) + (1 - Sp_X) \\cdot (1 - P(X=1))} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ PPV_X = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.30)} $$\n$$ PPV_X = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + (0.10)(0.70)} $$\n$$ PPV_X = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.070} $$\n$$ PPV_X = \\frac{0.255}{0.325} \\approx 0.78461538... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV_X = 0.7846$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV_X$)**\n\nThe negative predictive value is the probability that a subject is truly unexposed given that they are classified as unexposed, $NPV_X = P(X=0 \\mid \\tilde{X}=0)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV_X = P(X=0 \\mid \\tilde{X}=0) = \\frac{P(\\tilde{X}=0 \\mid X=0) P(X=0)}{P(\\tilde{X}=0)} $$\nThe term in the numerator is the joint probability $P(\\tilde{X}=0, X=0)$. The denominator, $P(\\tilde{X}=0)$, is the overall probability of being classified as unexposed. Using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(\\tilde{X}=0) = P(\\tilde{X}=0 \\mid X=0) P(X=0) + P(\\tilde{X}=0 \\mid X=1) P(X=1) $$\nSubstituting the definitions for sensitivity and specificity:\n$$ P(\\tilde{X}=0) = (Sp_X) \\cdot P(X=0) + (1 - Se_X) \\cdot P(X=1) $$\nThus, the full expression for $NPV_X$ is:\n$$ NPV_X = \\frac{Sp_X \\cdot P(X=0)}{Sp_X \\cdot P(X=0) + (1 - Se_X) \\cdot P(X=1)} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ NPV_X = \\frac{(0.90)(0.70)}{(0.90)(0.70) + (1 - 0.85)(0.30)} $$\n$$ NPV_X = \\frac{0.630}{0.630 + (0.15)(0.30)} $$\n$$ NPV_X = \\frac{0.630}{0.630 + 0.045} $$\n$$ NPV_X = \\frac{0.630}{0.675} \\approx 0.93333333... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV_X = 0.9333$.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe positive predictive value, $PPV_X \\approx 0.7846$, means that among individuals classified as exposed by the questionnaire, only about $78.5\\%$ are truly exposed. The remaining $21.5\\%$ are false positives. The negative predictive value, $NPV_X \\approx 0.9333$, means that among individuals classified as unexposed, about $93.3\\%$ are truly unexposed. The remaining $6.7\\%$ are false negatives.\n\nThese calculations demonstrate a critical principle: the predictive value of a test (or classification instrument) depends not only on its intrinsic properties ($Se_X$ and $Sp_X$) but also on the prevalence of the condition ($P(X=1)$) in the population being tested. In this case, because the exposure is relatively uncommon ($30\\%$), a positive test result is less reliable ($PPV_X = 0.7846$) than a negative test result ($NPV_X = 0.9333$), even with respectable sensitivity and specificity. This illustrates the impact of non-differential misclassification on the \"purity\" of the classified exposure groups.",

It provides all necessary information to compute the observed Relative Risk under conditions of non-differential outcome misclassification.\n\nThe objective is to compute the observed Relative Risk, denoted as $RR^{*}$, which is defined as the ratio of the observed risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the observed risk in the unexposed group. The observed outcome is denoted by $Y^{*}$, while the true outcome is $Y$. The exposure is $X$. The observed Relative Risk is given by the formula:\n$$RR^{*} = \\frac{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1)}{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0)}$$\n\nWe are given the following information:\nThe true risk in the exposed group: $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.20$.\nThe true risk in the unexposed group: $P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.10$.\nFrom these, we can also determine the probability of not having the true outcome:\n$P(Y=0 \\mid X=1) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n$P(Y=0 \\mid X=0) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe outcome classification is imperfect, characterized by:\nSensitivity: $Se_{Y} = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 0.80$.\nSpecificity: $Sp_{Y} = P(Y^{*}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive classification:\n$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - P(Y^{*}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - Sp_{Y} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem states that the outcome misclassification is non-differential, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of the outcome measurement do not depend on the exposure status $X$. That is, $P(Y^{*} \\mid Y, X=1) = P(Y^{*} \\mid Y, X=0) = P(Y^{*} \\mid Y)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator of $RR^{*}$, the observed risk in the exposed group, $P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1)$. We use the law of total probability, conditioning on the true outcome status $Y$.\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1, X=1)P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) + P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0, X=1)P(Y=0 \\mid X=1)$$\nDue to the non-differential misclassification assumption, we can simplify the conditional probabilities of the observed outcome:\n$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1, X=1) = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1) = Se_{Y}$.\n$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0, X=1) = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - Sp_{Y}$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for the observed risk in the exposed:\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1) = Se_{Y} \\cdot P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) + (1-Sp_{Y}) \\cdot P(Y=0 \\mid X=1)$$\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1) = (0.80)(0.20) + (1-0.90)(0.80)$$\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.16 + (0.10)(0.80) = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator of $RR^{*}$, the observed risk in the unexposed group, $P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0)$. We apply the same logic.\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1, X=0)P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) + P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0, X=0)P(Y=0 \\mid X=0)$$\nAgain, using the non-differential misclassification assumption:\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0) = Se_{Y} \\cdot P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) + (1-Sp_{Y}) \\cdot P(Y=0 \\mid X=0)$$\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0) = (0.80)(0.10) + (1-0.90)(0.90)$$\n$$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.08 + (0.10)(0.90) = 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.17$$\n\nFinally, we compute the observed Relative Risk, $RR^{*}$, by taking the ratio of the two observed risks.\n$$RR^{*} = \\frac{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1)}{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0)} = \\frac{0.24}{0.17}$$\nTo express this as an exact reduced fraction, we write the decimal values as fractions:\n$$RR^{*} = \\frac{24/100}{17/100} = \\frac{24}{17}$$\nThe numbers $24$ and $17$ are coprime (since $17$ is a prime number and it does not divide $24$), so the fraction is already in its simplest form. The true Relative Risk was $RR = 0.20 / 0.10 = 2$. The observed Relative Risk is $RR^{*} = 24/17 \\approx 1.41$, which demonstrates the characteristic bias towards the null value of $1$ for non-differential misclassification of a binary outcome.",

Let $D$ denote the disease status ($D=1$ for cases, $D=0$ for controls).\n\nThe observed odds ratio, $OR_{obs}$, is defined by the observed prevalences of exposure among cases ($p'_1$) and controls ($p'_0$):\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{p'_1 / (1-p'_1)}{p'_0 / (1-p'_0)}$$\nwhere $p'_1 = P(X'=1|D=1)$ and $p'_0 = P(X'=1|D=0)$.\n\nOur task is to compute $p'_1$ and $p'_0$ using the given true prevalences and misclassification parameters.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed prevalence of exposure among cases, $p'_1$. Using the law of total probability, we can express $p'_1$ as:\n$$p'_1 = P(X'=1|D=1) = P(X'=1|X=1, D=1)P(X=1|D=1) + P(X'=1|X=0, D=1)P(X=0|D=1)$$\n\nWe identify each term from the problem statement:\n- $P(X=1|D=1)$ is the true prevalence among cases, $p_1 = 0.5$.\n- $P(X=0|D=1) = 1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n- $P(X'=1|X=1, D=1)$ is the sensitivity among cases, $Se_{X,1} = 0.9$.\n- $P(X'=1|X=0, D=1)$ is the probability of a false positive among cases.
