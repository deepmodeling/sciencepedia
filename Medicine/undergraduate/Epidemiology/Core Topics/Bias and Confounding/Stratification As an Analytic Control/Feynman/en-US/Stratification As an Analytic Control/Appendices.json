            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard epidemiological problem concerning confounding and stratification, using established definitions and methods. All necessary data are provided, and the questions are unambiguous.\n\nWe are given data from a case-control study, stratified by a variable $C$. Let $i$ be the stratum index, where $i=0$ for $C=0$ (mild) and $i=1$ for $C=1$ (severe). For each stratum $i$, the data can be arranged in a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n\n|             | Cases ($D=1$) | Non-cases ($D=0$) |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Exposed ($A=1$) | $a_i$         | $b_i$             |\n| Unexposed ($A=0$) | $c_i$         | $d_i$             |\n\nThe sample odds ratio for stratum $i$ is given by $OR_i = \\frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i}$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the stratum-specific odds ratios.**\n\nFor stratum $C=0$ (mild):\nThe cell counts are $a_0 = 2$, $b_0 = 48$, $c_0 = 24$, and $d_0 = 276$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is:\n$$OR_{C=0} = \\frac{a_0 d_0}{b_0 c_0} = \\frac{2 \\times 276}{48 \\times 24} = \\frac{552}{1152} \\approx 0.4792$$\nAn odds ratio of approximately $0.48$ suggests that in the mild severity group, the exposure $A$ is associated with a reduction in the odds of the outcome $D$.\n\nFor stratum $C=1$ (severe):\nThe cell counts are $a_1 = 270$, $b_1 = 180$, $c_1 = 35$, and $d_1 = 15$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is:\n$$OR_{C=1} = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{270 \\times 15}{180 \\times 35} = \\frac{4050}{6300} = \\frac{9}{14} \\approx 0.6429$$\nAn odds ratio of approximately $0.64$ suggests that in the severe severity group, the exposure $A$ is also associated with a reduction in the odds of the outcome $D$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the crude odds ratio.**\n\nTo find the crude odds ratio, we collapse the data by summing the cell counts across both strata.\n$a_{crude} = a_0 + a_1 = 2 + 270 = 272$\n$b_{crude} = b_0 + b_1 = 48 + 180 = 228$\n$c_{crude} = c_0 + c_1 = 24 + 35 = 59$\n$d_{crude} = d_0 + d_1 = 276 + 15 = 291$\n\nThe crude $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n\n|             | Cases ($D=1$) | Non-cases ($D=0$) |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Exposed ($A=1$) | $272$         | $228$             |\n| Unexposed ($A=0$) | $59$          | $291$             |\n\nThe crude odds ratio is:\n$$OR_{crude} = \\frac{a_{crude} d_{crude}}{b_{crude} c_{crude}} = \\frac{272 \\times 291}{228 \\times 59} = \\frac{79152}{13452} \\approx 5.884$$\n\n**Step 3: Demonstrate the reversal of association.**\n\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are $OR_{C=0} \\approx 0.48$ and $OR_{C=1} \\approx 0.64$. Both are less than $1$, indicating a protective association between exposure $A$ and outcome $D$ within each stratum.\nHowever, the crude odds ratio is $OR_{crude} \\approx 5.88$, which is much greater than $1$. This indicates a strong harmful association.\nThe direction of the association is reversed when the data are collapsed and the stratifying variable $C$ is ignored. This phenomenon is an example of Simpson's Paradox, which arises due to confounding.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio.**\n\nThe Mantel–Haenszel estimator for the common odds ratio across strata is given by:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}}$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$ ($n_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$).\n\nFor stratum $C=0$:\n$n_0 = 2 + 48 + 24 + 276 = 350$.\n$\\frac{a_0 d_0}{n_0} = \\frac{2 \\times 276}{350} = \\frac{552}{350}$.\n$\\frac{b_0 c_0}{n_0} = \\frac{48 \\times 24}{350} = \\frac{1152}{350}$.\n\nFor stratum $C=1$:\n$n_1 = 270 + 180 + 35 + 15 = 500$.\n$\\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} = \\frac{270 \\times 15}{500} = \\frac{4050}{500}$.\n$\\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} = \\frac{180 \\times 35}{500} = \\frac{6300}{500}$.\n\nNow, we compute $OR_{MH}$:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{552}{350} + \\frac{4050}{500}}{\\frac{1152}{350} + \\frac{6300}{500}} = \\frac{\\frac{552 \\times 10 + 4050 \\times 7}{3500}}{\\frac{1152 \\times 10 + 6300 \\times 7}{3500}} = \\frac{5520 + 28350}{11520 + 44100} = \\frac{33870}{55620} = \\frac{3387}{5562}$$\n$$OR_{MH} \\approx 0.60898957...$$\nThe Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio provides a summary measure of association, adjusted for the confounding effects of $C$. Its value is consistent with the stratum-specific odds ratios.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_{MH} \\approx 0.6090$.\n\n**Step 5: Explain the reversal using probabilities of C.**\n\nThe reversal is due to $C$ being a confounder. A confounder is a variable associated with both the exposure ($A$) and the outcome ($D$) that distorts the $A-D$ relationship when it is not controlled for.\n1.  **Association between $C$ and $A$ (Exposure):** We compute the probability of being in the severe stratum ($C=1$) given exposure status.\n    -   Total number of exposed subjects ($A=1$): $(a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1) = (2+48) + (270+180) = 50 + 450 = 500$.\n    -   Number of exposed subjects in stratum $C=1$: $a_1 + b_1 = 270 + 180 = 450$.\n    -   $P(C=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{450}{500} = 0.9$.\n    -   Total number of unexposed subjects ($A=0$): $(c_0 + d_0) + (c_1 + d_1) = (24+276) + (35+15) = 300 + 50 = 350$.\n    -   Number of unexposed subjects in stratum $C=1$: $c_1 + d_1 = 35 + 15 = 50$.\n    -   $P(C=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{50}{350} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.143$.\nThere is a strong association between $C$ and $A$: exposed individuals are far more likely to be in the severe stratum ($90\\%$) than unexposed individuals ($14.3\\%$).\n\n2.  **Association between $C$ and $D$ (Outcome):** Within each level of exposure, the risk of outcome $D$ is much higher in stratum $C=1$.\n    -   Among exposed ($A=1$): The odds of disease are $\\frac{a_1}{b_1} = \\frac{270}{180} = 1.5$ for $C=1$, versus $\\frac{a_0}{b_0} = \\frac{2}{48} \\approx 0.042$ for $C=0$.\n    -   Among unexposed ($A=0$): The odds of disease are $\\frac{c_1}{d_1} = \\frac{35}{15} \\approx 2.33$ for $C=1$, versus $\\frac{c_0}{d_0} = \\frac{24}{276} \\approx 0.087$ for $C=0$.\nIn both cases, individuals in the severe stratum ($C=1$) have a much higher odds of being a case.\n\n**Conclusion on Reversal:** The crude analysis is misleading because it compares a largely severe-stratum exposed group with a largely mild-stratum unexposed group. The high risk of disease in the crude exposed group is primarily driven by the fact that $90\\%$ of them are in the high-risk 'severe' stratum, not by a harmful effect of the exposure itself. Stratification controls for this imbalance, revealing the true, protective nature of the exposure within each stratum. The large difference between $P(C=1 \\mid A=1)$ and $P(C=1 \\mid A=0)$ is the quantitative source of this confounding.\n\nThe final answer required is the Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio, rounded to four significant figures.\n$OR_{MH} = \\frac{3387}{5562} \\approx 0.6090$.",

We proceed with a step-by-step solution.\n\nAn effect measure $M$ for the association between an exposure $A$ and an outcome $Y$ is said to be collapsible over a third variable $C$ if the marginal (crude) measure of association is equal to a weighted average of the stratum-specific measures of association, where stratification is by $C$. If the stratum-specific measures are constant across strata, collapsibility requires the marginal measure to be equal to this common conditional measure. For the Risk Difference ($RD$), this means the marginal risk difference, $RD_{\\text{marg}}$, must be a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences, $RD(c)$. In words, this implies that the overall risk difference in the population is an unbiased summary of the risk differences observed within subgroups defined by the covariate $C$. The marginal effect is not distorted by ignoring the covariate $C$, a situation which is not true for non-collapsible measures like the Odds Ratio, even when $C$ is not a confounder.\n\nStratification is an analytic technique used to control for confounding by examining the exposure-outcome association within levels (strata) of a potential confounding variable. In this problem, the exposure $A$ is randomized and is thus independent of the baseline covariate $C$, which can be denoted as $A \\perp C$. This independence is the key condition that guarantees collapsibility for the Risk Difference. To demonstrate this, we use the law of total probability. The marginal risk in an exposure group $A=a$ is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid A=a) = \\sum_{c \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid A=a, C=c) P(C=c \\mid A=a)$$\nThe marginal Risk Difference, $RD_{\\text{marg}}$, is defined as the difference between the marginal risks in the exposed ($A=1$) and unexposed ($A=0$) groups:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid A=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression from the law of total probability gives:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = \\left( \\sum_{c} P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=c) P(C=c \\mid A=1) \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{c} P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=c) P(C=c \\mid A=0) \\right)$$\nBecause exposure $A$ is independent of covariate $C$ ($A \\perp C$), the distribution of $C$ is the same in both exposure groups, i.e., $P(C=c \\mid A=1) = P(C=c \\mid A=0) = P(C=c)$. Let's denote the weight for stratum $c$ as $w_c = P(C=c)$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = \\left( \\sum_{c} P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=c) w_c \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{c} P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=c) w_c \\right)$$\nBy linearity of summation, we can combine the terms:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = \\sum_{c} \\left[ P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=c) - P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=c) \\right] w_c$$\nThe term inside the brackets is precisely the stratum-specific risk difference, $RD(c)$. Therefore:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = \\sum_{c} RD(c) P(C=c)$$\nThis equation shows that the marginal risk difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences, with weights given by the prevalence of each stratum $P(C=c)$, which do not depend on the exposure $A$. This formally demonstrates why the Risk Difference is collapsible over a covariate $C$ when $A$ is not associated with $C$.\n\nWe now compute the required quantities using the provided data.\nThe stratum-specific risks, denoted $P(Y=1 \\mid A=a, C=c)$, are calculated as the number of events divided by the number of individuals in each stratum.\nFor stratum $C=0$:\n- Risk among exposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=0) = \\frac{30}{300} = 0.1$\n- Risk among unexposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=0) = \\frac{6}{300} = 0.02$\nFor stratum $C=1$:\n- Risk among exposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1) = \\frac{50}{200} = 0.25$\n- Risk among unexposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1) = \\frac{26}{200} = 0.13$\n\nThe stratum-specific risk differences, $RD(c) = P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=c) - P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=c)$, are:\n- For stratum $C=0$: $RD(0) = 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08$\n- For stratum $C=1$: $RD(1) = 0.25 - 0.13 = 0.12$\n\nThe marginal risks, $P(Y=1 \\mid A=a)$, are calculated by pooling data across the strata of $C$.\n- Total in exposed group ($A=1$): $300 + 200 = 500$\n- Total events in exposed group: $30 + 50 = 80$\n- Marginal risk among exposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{80}{500} = 0.16$\n- Total in unexposed group ($A=0$): $300 + 200 = 500$\n- Total events in unexposed group: $6 + 26 = 32$\n- Marginal risk among unexposed: $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{32}{500} = 0.064$\n\nThe algebraic proof requested in task 4 was provided in the second paragraph as the core of the explanation for collapsibility. It demonstrates that $RD_{\\text{marg}} = \\sum_{c} RD(c) P(C=c)$ under the condition $A \\perp C$.\n\nFinally, we compute the marginal Risk Difference, $RD_{\\text{marg}}$, for the entire cohort.\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid A=0)$$\nUsing the calculated marginal risks:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = 0.16 - 0.064 = 0.096$$\n\nAs a verification, we can compute this using the weighted average formula derived earlier. The weights are the proportions of the total population in each stratum of $C$.\n- Total population $N = 300+300+200+200 = 1000$.\n- Proportion in stratum $C=0$: $P(C=0) = \\frac{300+300}{1000} = \\frac{600}{1000} = 0.6$\n- Proportion in stratum $C=1$: $P(C=1) = \\frac{200+200}{1000} = \\frac{400}{1000} = 0.4$\nWeighted average of stratum-specific RDs:\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = RD(0)P(C=0) + RD(1)P(C=1) = (0.08)(0.6) + (0.12)(0.4)$$\n$$RD_{\\text{marg}} = 0.048 + 0.048 = 0.096$$\nThe result is consistent.",
