It is not trivial, as it requires a correct understanding and application of rate-based calculations and unit conversions in an epidemiological context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total expected number of deaths, $E$, in a study cohort by applying age-specific mortality rates from an external standard population. This is the foundational calculation for indirect age standardization, which leads to the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR).\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i$. For each stratum $i$, we are given the person-time of the study cohort, $T_i$, and the mortality rate of the standard population, $R_i$.\n\nThe fundamental definition of an incidence rate, $r$, is the number of events, $D$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $T$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{D}{T}\n$$\nRearranging this equation, the number of events is the product of the rate and the person-time:\n$$\nD = r \\times T\n$$\nTo calculate the *expected* number of deaths in the study cohort, we apply the standard population's stratum-specific rates to the study cohort's stratum-specific person-time. Thus, for each stratum $i$, the expected number of deaths, $E_i$, is:\n$$\nE_i = r_{S,i} \\times T_i\n$$\nwhere $r_{S,i}$ is the standard mortality rate for stratum $i$ and $T_i$ is the study cohort's person-time in that stratum.\n\nA critical step is to ensure dimensional consistency. The person-time, $T_i$, is given in units of person-years. The standard rates, $R_i$, are given per $100,000$ person-years. To correctly calculate $E_i$ as a dimensionless count of deaths, the rate $r_{S,i}$ must be expressed in units of (deaths per person-year).\n\nThe given standard rate $R_i$ represents deaths per $100,000$ person-years. To convert this to a rate per single person-year, we must divide by $100,000$:\n$$\nr_{S,i} \\left( \\frac{\\text{deaths}}{\\text{person-year}} \\right) = \\frac{R_i \\left( \\frac{\\text{deaths}}{100,000 \\text{ person-years}} \\right)}{100,000}\n$$\nSo, the formula for the expected number of deaths in stratum $i$ becomes:\n$$\nE_i = \\left( \\frac{R_i}{100,000} \\right) \\times T_i\n$$\nThe total expected number of deaths, $E$, is the sum of the expected deaths across all age strata:\n$$\nE = \\sum_i E_i = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{R_i \\times T_i}{100,000} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression correctly derives the total expected deaths by applying the unit conversion to ensure $E$ is on the count scale.\n\nNow we can compute the numerical value of $E$ using the provided data.\nLet's calculate the product $R_i \\times T_i$ for each stratum $i$:\n- **Age $20$–$39$ ($i=1$)**: $R_1 = 35$, $T_1 = 12,500$.\n  $E_1 = \\frac{35 \\times 12,500}{100,000} = \\frac{437,500}{100,000} = 4.375$\n- **Age $40$–$59$ ($i=2$)**: $R_2 = 120$, $T_2 = 9,100$.\n  $E_2 = \\frac{120 \\times 9,100}{100,000} = \\frac{1,092,000}{100,000} = 10.92$\n- **Age $60$–$79$ ($i=3$)**: $R_3 = 450$, $T_3 = 4,800$.\n  $E_3 = \\frac{450 \\times 4,800}{100,000} = \\frac{2,160,000}{100,000} = 21.6$\n- **Age $\\geq 80$ ($i=4$)**: $R_4 = 2,000$, $T_4 = 1,300$.\n  $E_4 = \\frac{2,000 \\times 1,300}{100,000} = \\frac{2,600,000}{100,000} = 26.0$\n\nThe total expected number of deaths is the sum of these stratum-specific expected deaths:\n$$\nE = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 4.375 + 10.92 + 21.6 + 26.0 = 62.895\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number is $62.895$. The first four significant figures are $6, 2, 8, 9$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit. Thus, $62.895$ rounds to $62.90$.",

Although Standard B has higher rates in younger and middle ages (for example, $0.0012$ versus $0.0008$ in ages $0$–$44$), the net increase in expected deaths from these younger and middle groups ($+16$ in ages $0$–$44$, $+7.5$ in ages $45$–$64$, and $+12$ in ages $65$–$74$) is $+35.5$, which is smaller than the $+60$ difference in the oldest group favoring Standard A. Consequently, $E^{(A)}$ exceeds $E^{(B)}$ by $323.5 - 299.0 = 24.5$, making $\\text{SMR}^{(A)}$ smaller than $\\text{SMR}^{(B)}$ because the same $O$ is divided by a larger $E$ under Standard A.\n\nStep 4: Report the ratio of SMRs, $\\text{SMR}^{(A)} \\div \\text{SMR}^{(B)}$.\nAlgebraically,\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{SMR}^{(A)}}{\\text{SMR}^{(B)}} \\;=\\; \\frac{O/E^{(A)}}{O/E^{(B)}} \\;=\\; \\frac{E^{(B)}}{E^{(A)}} \\;=\\; \\frac{299.0}{323.5}.\n$$\nCompute and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{299.0}{323.5} \\;\\approx\\; 0.9243.\n$$\nThus, the ratio of SMRs is $0.9243$ (to four significant figures), indicating that using Standard A yields an SMR about $7.57\\%$ lower relative to Standard B, driven mainly by the higher oldest-age mortality rate in Standard A interacting with the study’s older stratum size.",
