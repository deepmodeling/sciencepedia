Among sampled cases, the number exposed is $a=45$ and unexposed is $b=55$. Among sampled controls, the number exposed is $c=30$ and unexposed is $d=70$. Use only foundational definitions and large-sample properties to proceed: the odds among a group is defined as the probability of exposure divided by the probability of non-exposure in that group, and the odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds in cases to the odds in controls. Assume the natural logarithm of the sample odds ratio is approximately normally distributed in large samples and construct a Wald-type confidence interval on the natural log scale.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using the counts $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, compute the odds ratio as the ratio of exposure odds among cases to exposure odds among controls.\n2. Using large-sample normal approximation on the natural logarithm scale, compute a $95$ percent confidence interval for the natural logarithm of the odds ratio. Do not transform the interval back to the original scale.\n3. In one sentence, interpret the magnitude and direction of the estimated association in terms of etiologic association. In one additional sentence, name one strength and one limitation of the case-control design that affect how this estimate should be interpreted.\n\nReport the final numeric result as a single row matrix containing three entries in the following order: the odds ratio, the lower bound of the $95$ percent confidence interval for the natural logarithm of the odds ratio, and the upper bound of the $95$ percent confidence interval for the natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

The point estimate for this parameter is $\\ln(\\hat{OR})$.\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{OR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{21}{11}\\right) \\approx 0.646627 $$\nThe large-sample approximation for the standard error of $\\ln(\\hat{OR})$ is given by Woolf's method:\n$$ SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}} $$\nSubstituting the cell counts:\n$$ SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{45} + \\frac{1}{55} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{70}} $$\n$$ SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] \\approx \\sqrt{0.022222... + 0.018181... + 0.033333... + 0.014285...} $$\n$$ SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] \\approx \\sqrt{0.088023...} \\approx 0.296686 $$\nThe formula for a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(OR)$ is:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{OR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, and the corresponding critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe margin of error is:\n$$ E = z_{0.975} \\times SE[\\ln(\\hat{OR})] \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.296686 \\approx 0.581505 $$\nThe lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are:\nLower Bound: $LCL = \\ln(\\hat{OR}) - E \\approx 0.646627 - 0.581505 = 0.065122$\nUpper Bound: $UCL = \\ln(\\hat{OR}) + E \\approx 0.646627 + 0.581505 = 1.228132$\nRounding each bound to three significant figures:\n$$ LCL \\approx 0.0651 $$\n$$ UCL \\approx 1.23 $$\nThus, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(OR)$ is approximately $(0.0651, 1.23)$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Results**\n\nThe estimated odds ratio of approximately $1.91$ indicates that the odds of exposure to the workplace solvent were about $91\\%$ higher among cases with the chronic respiratory disease than among the hospital-based controls, which suggests a positive etiologic association.

            "problem": "A case-control study is conducted to investigate the association between an exposure and a disease, with stratification by a potential confounder. The study design samples on disease status: cases (individuals with the disease) and controls (individuals without the disease). Two strata are defined by the confounder. For each stratum, the observed counts are:\n\n- Stratum $1$: exposed cases $a_{1} = 120$, exposed controls $b_{1} = 90$, unexposed cases $c_{1} = 80$, unexposed controls $d_{1} = 210$.\n- Stratum $2$: exposed cases $a_{2} = 60$, exposed controls $b_{2} = 40$, unexposed cases $c_{2} = 140$, unexposed controls $d_{2} = 260$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions that in a case-control design the odds of exposure among cases is the ratio of exposed cases to unexposed cases and the odds of exposure among controls is the ratio of exposed controls to unexposed controls, derive the stratum-specific odds ratios for Stratum $1$ and Stratum $2$ in terms of the cell counts $(a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}, d_{i})$.

This method provides a pooled estimate that is adjusted for the confounding effects of the stratifying variable. The estimator is constructed as a weighted average, not of the stratum-specific odds ratios themselves, but of the cell counts contributing to them.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the common odds ratio, $OR_{MH}$, for $k$ strata is given by the formula:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i d_i}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i c_i}{N_i}} $$\nwhere $N_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$. Each stratum's contribution to the overall numerator ($a_i d_i$) and denominator ($b_i c_i$) is weighted by the inverse of the total stratum size, $1/N_i$. This weighting scheme gives more influence to strata with more information (i.e., smaller variance).\n\nNow, we compute this value for the given data ($k=2$).\nFirst, calculate the total size $N_i$ for each stratum:\nFor Stratum $1$: $N_1 = 120 + 90 + 80 + 210 = 500$.\nFor Stratum $2$: $N_2 = 60 + 40 + 140 + 260 = 500$.\n\nNext, calculate the weighted components for the numerator and denominator sums:\nFor Stratum $1$:\nNumerator component: $\\frac{a_1 d_1}{N_1} = \\frac{120 \\times 210}{500} = \\frac{25200}{500} = 50.4$.\nDenominator component: $\\frac{b_1 c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{90 \\times 80}{500} = \\frac{7200}{500} = 14.4$.\n\nFor Stratum $2$:\nNumerator component: $\\frac{a_2 d_2}{N_2} = \\frac{60 \\times 260}{500} = \\frac{15600}{500} = 31.2$.\nDenominator component: $\\frac{b_2 c_2}{N_2} = \\frac{40 \\times 140}{500} = \\frac{5600}{500} = 11.2$.\n\nFinally, compute the pooled odds ratio by summing these components:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{50.4 + 31.2}{14.4 + 11.2} = \\frac{81.6}{25.6} = 3.1875 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $3.188$.\n\n**Discussion of Conditions for Pooling**\n\nThe appropriateness of pooling stratum-specific estimates into a single summary measure, such as the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, rests on fundamental principles of confounding control and the absence of effect modification.\n\n1.  **Homogeneity of the Odds Ratio (Absence of Effect Modification):** The most critical assumption for pooling is that the odds ratio is constant, or homogeneous, across all strata. The stratifying variable should not be an \"effect modifier\". Effect modification (or interaction) is present when the magnitude or direction of the association between the exposure and the disease differs across levels of the stratifying variable. If the stratum-specific odds ratios (e.g., $OR_1$ and $OR_2$) are meaningfully different, it indicates that the effect of the exposure on the disease depends on the stratum. In such a case, pooling the estimates into a single number would be scientifically invalid and misleading, as it would obscure this important finding. The appropriate action would be to report the stratum-specific odds ratios separately and conclude that the stratifying variable modifies the effect of the exposure. Formal statistical tests, such as the Breslow-Day test or a likelihood-ratio test for an interaction term in a logistic regression model, are used to assess this homogeneity assumption. For this problem, we were explicitly instructed to assume a common odds ratio.\n\n2.  **Control of Confounding:** The primary purpose of stratification and pooling is to control for confounding. A confounder is a variable associated with both the exposure and the outcome that can distort the apparent relationship between them. By calculating the odds ratio within each stratum of the confounder, its effect is held constant. If the crude (unstratified) odds ratio is substantially different from the (homogeneous) stratum-specific odds ratios, confounding is present. The pooled estimator, $OR_{MH}$, provides a summary measure of association that is statistically adjusted for the effect of the confounder. It represents a more accurate estimate of the true exposure-disease relationship than the crude odds ratio.\n\nIn summary, pooling is appropriate to obtain a single, adjusted measure of association in the presence of confounding, but only when the assumption of a homogeneous effect across strata is tenable.",
