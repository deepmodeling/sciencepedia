By isolating infected individuals before they can transmit the pathogen, we break chains of infection. This first exercise allows us to quantify this race against time. We will use a mathematical model of an individual's infectiousness over time—the generation interval—to calculate the exact fraction of potential onward transmissions that are prevented by isolating a contact at a fixed delay .",

            "problem": "Consider a pathogen for which the time from an infected individual’s infection to the infection of one of their secondary cases (the generation interval) is modeled by a Weibull distribution. Let the probability density function be $g(t)$ with shape parameter $k$ and scale parameter $\\lambda$, so that for $t \\ge 0$ the density is $g(t) = \\frac{k}{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k-1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k}\\right)$ and $g(t)=0$ for $t<0$. Assume that the instantaneous infectiousness profile of an infected individual is proportional to $g(t)$ and that the expected number of secondary infections generated at time $t$ after infection is $R_0 g(t)$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number (R0). Suppose a contact tracing strategy isolates infected contacts at a fixed delay $d$ after their infection, after which their infectiousness is reduced to zero immediately and completely.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and standard properties of probability distributions, derive from first principles an expression for the expected fraction of onward transmissions prevented by this isolation-at-delay policy in terms of $g(t)$ and then evaluate it for a Weibull generation interval. Finally, compute the numerical value of this fraction for $k = 2.3$, $\\lambda = 5.2$ days, and $d = 3.0$ days.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in theoretical epidemiology that can be solved from first principles.\n\nThe expected number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual at time $t$ after their own infection is given by the infectiousness profile, which is stated to be $R_0 g(t)$. Here, $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number and $g(t)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the generation interval.\n\nFirst, we establish the total expected number of secondary infections, $N_{total}$, from a single case in the absence of any intervention. This is obtained by integrating the infectiousness profile over all time:\n$$\nN_{total} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R_0 g(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the generation interval PDF $g(t)$ is zero for $t < 0$. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n$$\nN_{total} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_0 g(t) \\, dt = R_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt\n$$\nBy definition, the integral of any probability density function over its entire domain is equal to $1$. Thus, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt = 1$. This confirms that the total expected number of secondary cases is $R_0$, which is consistent with the definition of the basic reproduction number.\n$$\nN_{total} = R_0 \\times 1 = R_0\n$$\nNext, we consider the effect of the contact tracing policy. The policy isolates the infected individual at a fixed delay $d$ after their infection, at which point their infectiousness immediately and completely becomes zero. This means that all transmissions that would have occurred at any time $t > d$ are prevented.\n\nThe expected number of prevented transmissions, $N_{prevented}$, is the integral of the infectiousness profile over the time period when transmission is blocked, i.e., from $t=d$ to infinity:\n$$\nN_{prevented} = \\int_{d}^{\\infty} R_0 g(t) \\, dt = R_0 \\int_{d}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction of onward transmissions prevented. This fraction, which we denote as $F_{prevented}$, is the ratio of the expected number of prevented transmissions to the total expected number of transmissions:\n$$\nF_{prevented} = \\frac{N_{prevented}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{R_0 \\int_{d}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt}{R_0}\n$$\nThe $R_0$ terms cancel, yielding a general expression for the fraction of transmissions prevented that depends only on the generation interval distribution and the delay to isolation:\n$$\nF_{prevented} = \\int_{d}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThis integral represents the probability that a transmission event occurs after time $d$. It is the complement of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) evaluated at $d$. If we define the CDF as $G(t) = \\int_0^t g(\\tau) \\, d\\tau$, then the fraction prevented is $1 - G(d)$. This is also known as the survival function, $S(d)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given Weibull distribution. The PDF is:\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{k}{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k-1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nTo find the fraction prevented, we must evaluate $F_{prevented} = \\int_{d}^{\\infty} g(t) \\, dt$. It is often simpler to first find the CDF, $G(d) = \\int_0^d g(t) \\, dt$, and then compute $1 - G(d)$.\n$$\nG(d) = \\int_0^d \\frac{k}{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k-1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nWe use the substitution $u = (t/\\lambda)^k$. Then the differential is $du = \\frac{k}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)^{k-1} dt$. The limits of integration change from $t=0$ and $t=d$ to $u=(0/\\lambda)^k = 0$ and $u=(d/\\lambda)^k$, respectively.\n$$\nG(d) = \\int_0^{(d/\\lambda)^k} \\exp(-u) \\, du = \\left[-\\exp(-u)\\right]_0^{(d/\\lambda)^k} = -\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)^k\\right) - (-\\exp(0)) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)^k\\right)\n$$\nThe fraction of transmissions prevented is therefore:\n$$\nF_{prevented} = 1 - G(d) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)^k\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)^k\\right)\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the fraction of onward transmissions prevented.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters: shape parameter $k = 2.3$, scale parameter $\\lambda = 5.2$ days, and isolation delay $d = 3.0$ days. The units of $\\lambda$ and $d$ are consistent, so their ratio is dimensionless.\n$$\nF_{prevented} = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{3.0}{5.2}\\right)^{2.3}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the exponent:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3.0}{5.2}\\right) \\approx 0.57692307...\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3.0}{5.2}\\right)^{2.3} \\approx (0.57692307...)^{2.3} \\approx 0.28225155...\n$$\nNow, we compute the exponential of the negative of this value:\n$$\nF_{prevented} = \\exp(-0.28225155...) \\approx 0.754090...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.7541$.

The condition for control is that the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is reduced to at most $1$. We will derive an expression for $R_e$ under the specified contact tracing strategy and then solve for the value of the tracing coverage $p$ that satisfies $R_e=1$. This value will be the critical coverage $p_c$.\n\nThe effective reproduction number $R_e$ is the average number of secondary infections generated by a single infected individual in the presence of the intervention.
