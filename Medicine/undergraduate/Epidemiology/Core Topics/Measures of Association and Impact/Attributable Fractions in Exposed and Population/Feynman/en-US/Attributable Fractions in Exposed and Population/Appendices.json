By calculating the Attributable Fraction in the Exposed ($AF_e$), we can answer the fundamental question: what proportion of the disease in the exposed group would be prevented if the exposure were removed? This practice builds a solid foundation by deriving the formula from first principles and connecting it to other key measures like the risk ratio and risk difference. ",

            "problem": "A university conducted a one-year cohort study to evaluate whether frequent use of electronic cigarettes is associated with acute bronchitis among students. Let $R$ denote the cumulative incidence (risk) of disease over the fixed follow-up period, with $R_e$ the risk among the exposed and $R_u$ the risk among the unexposed. The observed data show $R_e = 0.20$ and $R_u = 0.10$. The attributable fraction in the exposed (AF_e) is the proportion of cases among the exposed that would not have occurred during the study period if the exposure had been eliminated, under the assumptions of exchangeability and a well-defined exposure. The risk ratio (RR) is the ratio of risks $R_e$ to $R_u$, and the risk difference (RD) is the absolute difference in risks.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of risk, and the conceptual definition of the attributable fraction in the exposed as the proportion of exposed cases that are due to the exposure, derive from first principles an expression for $AF_e$, compute its numerical value using the given $R_e$ and $R_u$, interpret the result in words, and express $AF_e$ in terms of the risk ratio ($RR$) and the risk difference ($RD$).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and phrased objectively. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles of the attributable fraction in the exposed, $AF_e$, its computation, interpretation, and its expression in terms of other standard epidemiological measures.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Expression for $AF_e$**\n\nThe attributable fraction in the exposed, $AF_e$, is conceptually defined as the proportion of incident cases in the exposed group that are attributable to the exposure itself. To formalize this, we rely on the counterfactual framework and the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption posits that, had the exposed group not been exposed, their risk of disease would have been equal to the risk observed in the unexposed group, $R_u$.\n\nLet $R_e$ be the risk of disease in the exposed group. This is the total observed incidence from all causes.\nLet $R_u$ be the risk of disease in the unexposed group. Under the assumption of exchangeability, $R_u$ represents the \"background\" or \"baseline\" risk that would exist in any group, regardless of exposure status.\n\nThe risk in the exposed group, $R_e$, can thus be seen as the sum of two components:\n-   The background risk that would have occurred even without the exposure, which is equal to $R_u$.\n-   The excess risk that is specifically due to the exposure. This quantity is the risk difference, $RD = R_e - R_u$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *proportion* of cases among the exposed that are attributable to the exposure. This is the ratio of the excess risk to the total risk in the exposed group.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{\\text{Risk due to exposure}}{\\text{Total risk in the exposed}}\n$$\nSubstituting the corresponding quantities:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThis expression is the formal definition of the attributable fraction in the exposed, derived directly from its conceptual meaning.\n\n2.  **Numerical Calculation of $AF_e$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the cumulative incidences (risks):\n-   Risk in the exposed, $R_e = 0.20$\n-   Risk in the unexposed, $R_u = 0.10$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{0.20 - 0.10}{0.20} = \\frac{0.10}{0.20} = 0.5\n$$\n\n3.  **Interpretation of the Result**\n\nAn $AF_e$ value of $0.5$, or $50\\%$, carries a specific meaning in the context of this study. It means that among the university students who frequently use electronic cigarettes, we can attribute $50\\%$ of the acute bronchitis cases to their e-cigarette use. Phrased from a public health perspective, assuming the observed association is causal and all assumptions hold, eliminating frequent e-cigarette use in this student population would have prevented $50\\%$ of the bronchitis cases that occurred in the exposed group during the one-year follow-up period.\n\n4.  **Expressing $AF_e$ in Terms of Risk Ratio ($RR$) and Risk Difference ($RD$)**\n\nThe problem also requires expressing $AF_e$ in terms of the risk ratio ($RR$) and the risk difference ($RD$).\n\nThe definitions given are:\n-   Risk Ratio: $RR = \\frac{R_e}{R_u}$\n-   Risk Difference: $RD = R_e - R_u$\n\n**Expression in terms of $RR$**:\nWe start with the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression by dividing both terms in the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e}{R_e} - \\frac{R_u}{R_e} = 1 - \\frac{R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{R_u}{R_e}$ is the reciprocal of the risk ratio, $RR$. That is, $\\frac{1}{RR} = \\frac{R_u}{R_e}$.\nSubstituting this relationship into the equation for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = 1 - \\frac{1}{RR}\n$$\nThis can also be written as a single fraction:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{RR - 1}{RR}\n$$\n\n**Expression in terms of $RD$**:\nWe again start with the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThe numerator, $R_e - R_u$, is by definition the risk difference, $RD$.\nTherefore, we can directly substitute $RD$ into the numerator:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{RD}{R_e}\n$$\nThis expression relates $AF_e$ to the risk difference, but it is not expressed purely in terms of $RD$, as it also requires the value of the risk in the exposed, $R_e$. An expression for $AF_e$ purely in terms of $RR$ and $RD$ is not possible, as it would reduce back to the expression involving only $RR$. The two formulas derived, $AF_e = \\frac{RR-1}{RR}$ and $AF_e = \\frac{RD}{R_e}$, are the standard forms relating $AF_e$ to these other measures of association and impact.",

Suppose the unexposed group has a constant baseline risk $r_0$, and the exposed group has a constant risk $r_1$ such that the relative risk $RR$ is defined by $RR = r_1 / r_0$. Assume this $RR$ is homogeneous across the population.\n\nStarting from the definitions of relative risk, exposure prevalence, and the population-average risk as a mixture of exposed and unexposed risks, do the following:\n\n1. Derive the population-average risk when the exposure prevalence is $p_e$.\n2. Define the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) as the proportionate reduction in the population-average risk that would be achieved if the exposure were fully removed (i.e., the counterfactual prevalence is $0$), and express it in terms of $p_e$, $RR$, and $r_0$.\n3.

All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation followed by a calculation. We will proceed step-by-step.\n\n**1. Derivation of the population-average risk ($R_{pop}$)**\n\nThe total population is partitioned into two groups: the exposed group, which constitutes a proportion $p_e$ of the population, and the unexposed group, which constitutes the remaining proportion $1 - p_e$. The risk of the outcome in the exposed group is $r_1$, and the risk in the unexposed group is $r_0$.\n\nThe population-average risk, denoted as $R_{pop}$, is the weighted average of the risks in these two subgroups, where the weights are the proportions of the population in each group.\n$$\nR_{pop} = p_e \\cdot r_1 + (1 - p_e) \\cdot r_0\n$$\nWe are given the definition of the relative risk, $RR$, as the ratio of the risk in the exposed to the risk in the unexposed:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{r_1}{r_0}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the risk in the exposed group, $r_1$, in terms of the baseline risk, $r_0$, and the relative risk, $RR$:\n$$\nr_1 = RR \\cdot r_0\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $r_1$ into the equation for $R_{pop}$:\n$$\nR_{pop} = p_e \\cdot (RR \\cdot r_0) + (1 - p_e) \\cdot r_0\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $r_0$:\n$$\nR_{pop} = r_0 \\left[ p_e \\cdot RR + (1 - p_e) \\right]\n$$\nRearranging the terms inside the brackets gives the final expression for the population-average risk:\n$$\nR_{pop} = r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression gives the population-average risk in terms of the baseline risk $r_0$, the exposure prevalence $p_e$, and the relative risk $RR$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportionate reduction in the population-average risk that would occur if the exposure were completely eliminated from the population. In this counterfactual scenario, the exposure prevalence becomes $0$.\n\nWhen the exposure is eliminated, the entire population becomes unexposed, and thus every individual has the baseline risk $r_0$. The counterfactual population-average risk, which we can denote $R_{counterfactual}$, is therefore equal to $r_0$.\n$$\nR_{counterfactual} = r_0\n$$\nThe PAF is the proportionate change from the current risk ($R_{pop}$) to this counterfactual risk, calculated as:\n$$\nPAF = \\frac{R_{pop} - R_{counterfactual}}{R_{pop}} = \\frac{R_{pop} - r_0}{R_{pop}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{pop}$ derived in the first part:\n$$\nPAF = \\frac{r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right] - r_0}{r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right]}\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero baseline risk ($r_0 \\neq 0$), we can cancel $r_0$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nPAF = \\frac{\\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right] - 1}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator yields the final expression for PAF, which is independent of the baseline risk $r_0$:\n$$\nPAF = \\frac{p_e(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Potential Impact Fraction (PIF)**\n\nThe Potential Impact Fraction (PIF) is a generalization of the PAF. It is defined as the proportionate reduction in the population-average risk that would be achieved if the exposure prevalence were reduced from its current level $p_e$ to a new, lower level $p_e^*$.\n\nThe current population risk is $R_{pop} = r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right]$.\nThe counterfactual population risk, corresponding to the new prevalence $p_e^*$, is found by substituting $p_e^*$ for $p_e$ in the formula for population risk:\n$$\nR_{pop}^* = r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e^*(RR - 1) \\right]\n$$\nThe PIF is the proportionate change from the current risk to this new counterfactual risk:\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{R_{pop} - R_{pop}^*}{R_{pop}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{pop}$ and $R_{pop}^*$:\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right] - r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e^*(RR - 1) \\right]}{r_0 \\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right]}\n$$\nAgain, we can cancel the common factor $r_0$ (assuming $r_0 \\neq 0$):\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{\\left[ 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right] - \\left[ 1 + p_e^*(RR - 1) \\right]}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{1 + p_e(RR - 1) - 1 - p_e^*(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{p_e(RR - 1) - p_e^*(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nFactoring out the term $(RR - 1)$ in the numerator gives the final expression for PIF:\n$$\nPIF = \\frac{(p_e - p_e^*)(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nNote that if we set $p_e^* = 0$, the PIF expression reduces to the PAF expression, as expected.\n\n**Evaluation of the ratio PIF/PAF**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $PIF/PAF$ for the given scenario. First, let's find the symbolic expression for this ratio using the formulas derived above.\n$$\n\\frac{PIF}{PAF} = \\frac{\\frac{(p_e - p_e^*)(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}}{\\frac{p_e(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}}\n$$\nAssuming $RR \\neq 1$, the term $(RR-1)$ is non-zero. The problem gives $RR=1.8$, so this holds. The denominator term $1 + p_e(RR - 1)$ is also non-zero and can be canceled from the numerator and denominator of the larger fraction. This leaves a simplified expression:\n$$\n\\frac{PIF}{PAF} = \\frac{p_e - p_e^*}{p_e} = 1 - \\frac{p_e^*}{p_e}\n$$\nThis result shows that the ratio of the PIF to the PAF depends only on the initial and counterfactual prevalences, not on the relative risk or baseline risk.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $p_e = 0.40$ and $p_e^* = 0.20$.\n$$\n\\frac{PIF}{PAF} = \\frac{0.40 - 0.20}{0.40} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40}\n$$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{PIF}{PAF} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe ratio $PIF/PAF$ for this scenario is $\\frac{1}{2}$.",
