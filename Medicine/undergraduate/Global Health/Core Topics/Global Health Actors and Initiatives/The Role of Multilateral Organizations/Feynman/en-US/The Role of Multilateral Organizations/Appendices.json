            "problem": "Consider two neighboring countries indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ that choose per-capita infectious disease surveillance intensity $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $x_i = 1$ represents fully funding a recommended surveillance package and $x_i = 0$ represents no funding. The per-capita resource cost borne by the investing country is $c = 5$ dollars. The surveillance generates a purely external per-capita benefit $b = 8$ dollars that accrues to the neighbor (through reduced cross-border outbreak risk), and the investing country’s own direct per-capita benefit from its own surveillance is $0$. Assume identical countries and that per-capita values are additive across countries.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Externality: An action by one country ($x_i$) yields a per-capita benefit $b$ to the other country $j \\neq i$, and no internal per-capita benefit to country $i$.\n- Nash equilibrium in a binary-action game: Each country chooses $x_i$ to maximize its own per-capita payoff given the other’s choice $x_j$.\n- Social planner’s optimum: Choose $(x_1,x_2)$ to maximize the sum of per-capita payoffs across the two countries.\n\nA multilateral organization such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group (World Bank), or the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) can offer a uniform per-capita subsidy $s$ to any country that invests ($x_i = 1$). Under such a subsidy, a country’s per-capita payoff becomes its original payoff plus $s$ if it invests.\n\nUsing these foundations, determine:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure its scientific and logical soundness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Countries: indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n-   Action space for each country $i$: $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $x_i=1$ is investment and $x_i=0$ is no investment.\n-   Per-capita cost of investment for the investing country: $c = 5$ dollars.\n-   Per-capita external benefit to the neighbor country: $b = 8$ dollars.\n-   Direct per-capita benefit to the investing country: $0$.\n-   Payoff function for country $i$: $U_i(x_i, x_j) = b \\cdot x_j - c \\cdot x_i$ for $j \\neq i$.\n-   Social planner's objective: Maximize the sum of payoffs, $W(x_1, x_2) = U_1(x_1, x_2) + U_2(x_1, x_2)$.\n-   Subsidy: A uniform per-capita subsidy $s$ is given to any country that invests ($x_i=1$). The subsidized payoff is $U_i^s(x_i, x_j) = U_i(x_i, x_j) + s \\cdot x_i$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard application of game theory to a public goods problem with externalities, a well-established model in economics and public policy analysis. The concepts of Nash equilibrium, social optimum, and corrective subsidies are fundamental to this field. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters ($b$, $c$) and objective functions defined. The premises are logically consistent and do not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. The setup is well-posed and allows for a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\n\nFirst, we formalize the per-capita payoff function for country $i$ based on its action $x_i$ and its neighbor's action $x_j$ (where $j \\neq i$). The benefit for country $i$ is $b \\cdot x_j$ and its cost is $c \\cdot x_i$.\n$$U_i(x_i, x_j) = b x_j - c x_i$$\nWe are given the values $b=8$ and $c=5$.\n\n**1. The Social Planner’s Optimum, $x^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe social planner's objective is to choose $(x_1, x_2)$ to maximize the total per-capita welfare, $W(x_1, x_2)$, which is the sum of the individual payoffs:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = U_1(x_1, x_2) + U_2(x_1, x_2) = (b x_2 - c x_1) + (b x_1 - c x_2)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = (b-c)x_1 + (b-c)x_2$$\nSubstituting the given values $b=8$ and $c=5$:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = (8-5)x_1 + (8-5)x_2 = 3x_1 + 3x_2$$\nTo maximize this welfare function, the planner should choose the largest possible values for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the action space for each country is $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the maximum value for each is $1$.\nThe socially optimal strategy profile is therefore $(x_1, x_2) = (1,1)$.\nThe problem asks for the symmetric per-capita surveillance investment in this optimum, which is $x^{\\ast}$.\n$$x^{\\ast} = 1$$\n\n**2. The Nash Equilibrium without Subsidy, $x^{N}$**\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each country chooses its action to maximize its own payoff, given the other country's action. We determine the best response for country $i$ to any choice $x_j$ by country $j$. Country $i$ chooses $x_i$ to maximize $U_i(x_i, x_j) = b x_j - c x_i$.\n\nLet's fix the action of country $j$, $x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and compare the payoffs for country $i$:\n-   If country $i$ chooses to invest ($x_i=1$), its payoff is $U_i(1, x_j) = b x_j - c$.\n-   If country $i$ chooses not to invest ($x_i=0$), its payoff is $U_i(0, x_j) = b x_j - c(0) = b x_j$.\n\nComparing the two possible payoffs for country $i$:\n$$b x_j - c < b x_j$$\nThis inequality holds because $c=5 > 0$. This means that for any action taken by country $j$, country $i$ will always achieve a strictly higher payoff by choosing not to invest ($x_i=0$). Therefore, $x_i=0$ is a strictly dominant strategy.\nSince the game is symmetric, $x_2=0$ is also the dominant strategy for country $2$. The unique Nash equilibrium is the one where both countries play their dominant strategy: $(x_1, x_2) = (0,0)$.\nThe symmetric investment level in the Nash equilibrium is $x^N$.\n$$x^{N} = 0$$\n\n**3. The Minimum Uniform Per-Capita Subsidy, $s^{\\min}$**\n\nA multilateral organization offers a subsidy $s$ to any country that invests. The new payoff function for country $i$, denoted $U_i^s$, becomes:\n$$U_i^s(x_i, x_j) = (b x_j - c x_i) + s x_i = b x_j + (s-c)x_i$$\nWe want to find the minimum subsidy $s$ that makes the socially optimal outcome $(x_1, x_2)=(1,1)$ a Nash equilibrium. For $(1,1)$ to be a Nash equilibrium, neither country must have an incentive to unilaterally deviate. We check the condition for country $i$, assuming country $j$ plays $x_j=1$. Country $i$ must prefer to play $x_i=1$ over deviating to $x_i=0$.\nThe condition is:\n$$U_i^s(1,1) \\geq U_i^s(0,1)$$\nLet's calculate the payoffs:\n-   Payoff for not deviating (playing $x_i=1$): $U_i^s(1,1) = b(1) + (s-c)(1) = b+s-c$.\n-   Payoff for deviating (playing $x_i=0$): $U_i^s(0,1) = b(1) + (s-c)(0) = b$.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$b+s-c \\geq b$$\n$$s-c \\geq 0$$\n$$s \\geq c$$\nGiven that the cost is $c=5$, the subsidy must satisfy $s \\geq 5$.\nThe minimum subsidy $s^{\\min}$ required is the smallest value that satisfies this condition.\n$$s^{\\min} = 5$$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(x^{\\ast}, x^{N}, s^{\\min})$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the selection of a portfolio of health interventions to maximize the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, subject to a fixed budget. The methodology to be used is incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (ICEA).\n\nFirst, we must define the set of possible strategies to be evaluated. The problem states there are three mutually independent and indivisible interventions. This means we can choose any combination of these interventions. The set of all possible strategies are the potential portfolios. We must first identify all portfolios that are feasible within the budget constraint of $B = \\$70,000$.\n\nLet the interventions be A, B, and C, with their respective cost ($C$) and effect ($D$, in DALYs averted) pairs:\n- Intervention A: $(C_A, D_A) = (\\$50,000, 1,000)$\n- Intervention B: $(C_B, D_B) = (\\$30,000, 300)$\n- Intervention C: $(C_C, D_C) = (\\$40,000, 600)$\n\nThe feasible portfolios (including the null portfolio of doing nothing) are those whose total cost does not exceed $B = \\$70,000$:\n1.  **Portfolio 0**: No interventions. Total cost $C_0 = \\$0$, total effect $D_0 = 0$.\n2.  **Portfolio B**: Intervention B only. Total cost $C_B = \\$30,000$, total effect $D_B = 300$.\n3.  **Portfolio C**: Intervention C only. Total cost $C_C = \\$40,000$, total effect $D_C = 600$.\n4.  **Portfolio A**: Intervention A only. Total cost $C_A = \\$50,000$, total effect $D_A = 1,000$.\n5.  **Portfolio BC**: Interventions B and C. Total cost $C_{BC} = C_B + C_C = \\$30,000 + \\$40,000 = \\$70,000$. Total effect $D_{BC} = D_B + D_C = 300 + 600 = 900$.\n\nOther combinations such as $\\{A, B\\}$, $\\{A, C\\}$, and $\\{A, B, C\\}$ are not feasible as their total costs ($C_{AB} = \\$80,000$, $C_{AC} = \\$90,000$, $C_{ABC} = \\$120,000$) exceed the $\\$70,000$ budget.\n\nThe core of the ICEA is to treat these feasible portfolios as mutually exclusive options and construct an efficient expansion path by eliminating dominated ones.\n\n**Step 1: Order portfolios by cost and eliminate strongly dominated options.**\nThe portfolios, ordered by increasing cost, are:\n- $P_0: (C, D) = (\\$0, 0)$\n- $P_B: (C, D) = (\\$30,000, 300)$\n- $P_C: (C, D) = (\\$40,000, 600)$\n- $P_A: (C, D) = (\\$50,000, 1,000)$\n- $P_{BC}: (C, D) = (\\$70,000, 900)$\n\nA portfolio is strongly (or simply) dominated if another portfolio is both less costly and more effective. Let us compare each portfolio to others. Upon inspection, we compare portfolio $P_{BC}$ with $P_A$:\n- Cost: $C_{BC} = \\$70,000 > C_A = \\$50,000$.\n- Effect: $D_{BC} = 900 < D_A = 1,000$.\nPortfolio $P_{BC}$ is more expensive and less effective than portfolio $P_A$. Therefore, $P_{BC}$ is strongly dominated and must be removed from consideration.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate extendedly dominated options.**\nOur remaining set of non-dominated portfolios, ordered by cost, is $\\{P_0, P_B, P_C, P_A\\}$. An option is extendedly dominated if it is less cost-effective than a combination of other options. This is identified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for successive pairs of options. The ICER must strictly increase along the efficient expansion path. The ICER between two portfolios $P_i$ and $P_j$ (with $C_j > C_i$) is given by $ICER = \\frac{C_j - C_i}{D_j - D_i}$.\n\nLet's compute the ICERs for the sequence $P_0 \\to P_B \\to P_C \\to P_A$.\n- **ICER for $P_B$ vs $P_0$**:\n$$ICER_{B,0} = \\frac{C_B - C_0}{D_B - D_0} = \\frac{\\$30,000 - \\$0}{300 - 0} = \\$100 \\text{ per DALY}$$\n- **ICER for $P_C$ vs $P_B$**:\n$$ICER_{C,B} = \\frac{C_C - C_B}{D_C - D_B} = \\frac{\\$40,000 - \\$30,000}{600 - 300} = \\frac{\\$10,000}{300} \\approx \\$33.33 \\text{ per DALY}$$\nSince $ICER_{C,B} < ICER_{B,0}$, the sequence of ICERs is not increasing. This indicates the presence of extended dominance. Portfolio $P_B$ is extendedly dominated because the move from $P_0$ to $P_C$ is more cost-effective (ICER = $\\frac{\\$40,000}{600} \\approx \\$66.67$ per DALY) than the move from $P_0$ to $P_B$ (ICER = $\\$100$ per DALY). Thus, we eliminate $P_B$.\n\nOur remaining set of portfolios is now $\\{P_0, P_C, P_A\\}$, ordered by cost. Let's re-calculate the ICERs for the new sequence $P_0 \\to P_C \\to P_A$.\n- **ICER for $P_C$ vs $P_0$**:\n$$ICER_{C,0} = \\frac{C_C - C_0}{D_C - D_0} = \\frac{\\$40,000 - \\$0}{600 - 0} \\approx \\$66.67 \\text{ per DALY}$$\n- **ICER for $P_A$ vs $P_C$**:\n$$ICER_{A,C} = \\frac{C_A - C_C}{D_A - D_C} = \\frac{\\$50,000 - \\$40,000}{1,000 - 600} = \\frac{\\$10,000}{400} = \\$25 \\text{ per DALY}$$\nAgain, the ICER decreases ($ICER_{A,C} < ICER_{C,0}$). This indicates that $P_C$ is also extendedly dominated. The move from $P_0$ to $P_A$ has an ICER of $\\frac{\\$50,000}{1,000} = \\$50$ per DALY, which is more cost-effective than the move from $P_0$ to $P_C$ (ICER $\\approx \\$66.67$ per DALY). Thus, we eliminate $P_C$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the final efficient expansion path.**\nAfter eliminating all dominated and extendedly dominated portfolios, the only remaining efficient options are $P_0$ (doing nothing) and $P_A$ (funding only intervention A). The efficient expansion path consists of the sequence $P_0 \\to P_A$.\n\nThis path signifies that for any level of budget, the only efficient choices are to fund nothing (if the budget is less than $\\$50,000$) or to fund portfolio A (if the budget is $\\$50,000$ or more). All other portfolios or combinations represent an inefficient use of resources.\n\n**Step 4: Select the optimal portfolio for the given budget.**\nThe specified budget is $B = \\$70,000$. According to the efficient expansion path, since the budget is sufficient to fund portfolio $P_A$ (which costs $C_A = \\$50,000$), this is the optimal choice. After funding $P_A$, the remaining budget is $\\$70,000 - \\$50,000 = \\$20,000$, which is insufficient to fund any of the other interventions (B costs $\\$30,000$ and C costs $\\$40,000$).\n\nTherefore, the portfolio that maximizes DALYs averted under the budget constraint, following the principles of incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, is portfolio A. The total DALYs averted by this portfolio is $D_A$.\n\nTotal DALYs averted = $1,000$.",
