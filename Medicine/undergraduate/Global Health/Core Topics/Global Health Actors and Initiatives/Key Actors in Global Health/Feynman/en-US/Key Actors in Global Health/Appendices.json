            "problem": "A multilateral funder such as the Global Fund to Fight Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) uses needs-based principles to allocate tuberculosis resources among countries, which is consistent with policy guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO). Under a widely used needs-based principle, to compare two countries as the only actors competing for a fixed tuberculosis envelope, each country is assigned a weight that increases with disease burden and decreases with income per capita. The normalized share for a country is then the ratio of its weight to the sum of weights across the considered countries, which ensures the shares sum to one.\n\nConsider two countries, Country $1$ and Country $2$, with tuberculosis disease burdens $b_1$ and $b_2$ measured as annual incident cases, and incomes per capita $y_1$ and $y_2$ measured in United States dollars (USD). The needs-based weight for each country is constructed to be directly proportional to $b$ and inversely proportional to $y$. Compute the normalized allocation share for Country $1$ when $b_1 = 200{,}000$, $y_1 = 1{,}500$, $b_2 = 50{,}000$, and $y_2 = 4{,}000$.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe weight for a country, $W$, is defined as being directly proportional to its disease burden, $b$, and inversely proportional to its income per capita, $y$. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\nW \\propto \\frac{b}{y}\n$$\nWe can introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that the weight for any country $i$ is given by the equation:\n$$\nW_i = k \\frac{b_i}{y_i}\n$$\nThe problem considers two countries, Country $1$ and Country $2$. Their respective weights, $W_1$ and $W_2$, are:\n$$\nW_1 = k \\frac{b_1}{y_1}\n$$\n$$\nW_2 = k \\frac{b_2}{y_2}\n$$\nThe normalized allocation share for Country $1$, denoted as $S_1$, is the ratio of its weight to the sum of the weights of both countries:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{W_1}{W_1 + W_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $W_1$ and $W_2$ into the equation for $S_1$:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{k \\frac{b_1}{y_1}}{k \\frac{b_1}{y_1} + k \\frac{b_2}{y_2}}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality, $k$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This demonstrates that the specific value of $k$ is not required to determine the normalized shares.\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{b_1}{y_1}}{\\frac{b_1}{y_1} + \\frac{b_2}{y_2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $b_1 = 200,000$\n-   $y_1 = 1,500$\n-   $b_2 = 50,000$\n-   $y_2 = 4,000$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{b}{y}$ for each country.\nFor Country $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{b_1}{y_1} = \\frac{200,000}{1,500} = \\frac{2,000}{15} = \\frac{400}{3}\n$$\nFor Country $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{b_2}{y_2} = \\frac{50,000}{4,000} = \\frac{50}{4} = \\frac{25}{2}\n$$\nNext, we substitute these values back into the expression for $S_1$:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{400}{3}}{\\frac{400}{3} + \\frac{25}{2}}\n$$\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $6$:\n$$\n\\frac{400}{3} + \\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{400 \\times 2}{6} + \\frac{25 \\times 3}{6} = \\frac{800}{6} + \\frac{75}{6} = \\frac{875}{6}\n$$\nNow, the expression for $S_1$ becomes:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{400}{3}}{\\frac{875}{6}}\n$$\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{400}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{875} = \\frac{400 \\times 2}{875} = \\frac{800}{875}\n$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by $25$.\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{800 \\div 25}{875 \\div 25} = \\frac{32}{35}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. We perform the division:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{32}{35} \\approx 0.9142857...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant figure. The first four significant figures are $9, 1, 4, 2$. The fifth significant figure is $8$. Since $8 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nS_1 \\approx 0.9143\n$$\nThus, the normalized allocation share for Country $1$ is approximately $0.9143$.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nLet $C$ be the number of Community Health Workers (CHWs). The problem requires finding the minimum integer value of $C$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the total annual service requirement for the catchment. This is the total number of contacts needed for the entire population in one year.\nLet $R_{total}$ be the total annual service requirement.\n$$R_{total} = N \\times r$$\nwhere $N$ is the population size and $r$ is the per-capita target contact rate.\n\nNext, we formalize the total annual service capacity provided by the CHWs. This is the total number of contacts that $C$ CHWs can deliver in one year.\nLet $S_{total}$ be the total annual service capacity.\n$$S_{total} = C \\times m$$\nwhere $m$ is the annual productivity of a single CHW.\n\nThe core planning principle is that the service capacity must meet or exceed the service requirement. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$S_{total} \\ge R_{total}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_{total}$ and $R_{total}$:\n$$C \\times m \\ge N \\times r$$\n\nWe need to solve for $C$:\n$$C \\ge \\frac{N \\times r}{m}$$\n\nThe problem states that fractional workers are not possible and asks for the smallest whole-number headcount. This means $C$ must be an integer. The smallest integer $C$ that satisfies the inequality $C \\ge \\frac{N \\times r}{m}$ is given by the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side. The ceiling function, denoted $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\nTherefore, the minimal required number of CHWs, $C_{min}$, is:\n$$C_{min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{N \\times r}{m} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this formula:\n- $N = 10000$\n- $r = 4$ contacts per person per year\n- $m = 2000$ contacts per year\n\n$$C_{min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{10000 \\times 4}{2000} \\right\\rceil$$\nFirst, we calculate the value of the fraction:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\times 4}{2000} = \\frac{40000}{2000} = 20$$\nThe calculation is exact.\n\nApplying the ceiling function to this result:\n$$C_{min} = \\lceil 20 \\rceil$$\nSince $20$ is already an integer, its ceiling is $20$.\n$$C_{min} = 20$$\n\nThus, the smallest whole-number headcount of CHWs required to meet the service demand is $20$.",
