            "problem": "In a district implementing the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), a randomized, two-arm study follows two cohorts over the same fixed time period to assess protection against a vaccine-preventable respiratory infection confirmed by laboratory testing. Assume the cohorts are closed (no loss to follow-up), exposures are comparable, and disease risk is accumulated over the period without competing risks. Let the cumulative incidence over the fixed period be called the attack rate. Starting from the definition of vaccine efficacy (VE) as $VE = 1 - \\text{RR}$, where $\\text{RR}$ denotes the Relative Risk (RR), and using the standard definition of $\\text{RR}$ in terms of risks, derive an expression that relates $VE$ to the attack rates observed in the vaccine and control arms. Then compute $VE$ given observed cumulative incidences (attack rates) of $10/1000$ in the vaccine arm and $40/1000$ in the control arm over the follow-up period. Express your final $VE$ value as a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures, and do not use the percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed, and objective. We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to derive an expression for vaccine efficacy ($VE$) in terms of attack rates, and second, to compute its numerical value based on the provided data.\n\nLet $AR_v$ be the attack rate in the vaccinated cohort and $AR_u$ be the attack rate in the control (unvaccinated) cohort. The problem states that the attack rate is defined as the cumulative incidence over the fixed study period. In epidemiology, cumulative incidence is a measure of risk. Therefore, $AR_v$ is the risk of developing the infection in the vaccinated group, and $AR_u$ is the risk of developing the infection in the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe Relative Risk ($\\text{RR}$) is a measure of the association between an exposure (vaccination, in this case) and an outcome (infection). It is defined as the ratio of the risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. In the context of vaccine studies, this is the ratio of the risk in the vaccinated group to the risk in the unvaccinated group.\n\n$$ \\text{RR} = \\frac{\\text{Risk in vaccinated group}}{\\text{Risk in unvaccinated group}} = \\frac{AR_v}{AR_u} $$\n\nThe problem provides the definition of Vaccine Efficacy ($VE$) as:\n\n$$ VE = 1 - \\text{RR} $$\n\nTo derive the expression relating $VE$ to the attack rates, we substitute the definition of $\\text{RR}$ in terms of $AR_v$ and $AR_u$ into the equation for $VE$.\n\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{AR_v}{AR_u} $$\n\nThis is the general expression for vaccine efficacy based on the attack rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we are asked to compute the value of $VE$ given the observed attack rates from the study. The provided data are:\n-   Attack rate in the vaccine arm: $AR_v = \\frac{10}{1000}$\n-   Attack rate in the control arm: $AR_u = \\frac{40}{1000}$\n\nFirst, we express these attack rates as decimal fractions:\n$$ AR_v = \\frac{10}{1000} = 0.01 $$\n$$ AR_u = \\frac{40}{1000} = 0.04 $$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived formula for $VE$:\n\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{0.01}{0.04} $$\n\nWe calculate the ratio of the attack rates:\n\n$$ \\frac{0.01}{0.04} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the value of $VE$:\n\n$$ VE = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.75$. To express this with four significant figures, we append two trailing zeros.\n\n$$ VE = 0.7500 $$",

            "problem": "A country implementing the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) seeks to eliminate measles using a single-dose vaccine that acts in a \"leaky\" manner: vaccinated individuals remain susceptible but with susceptibility multiplicatively reduced by a factor equal to the vaccine efficacy. Assume a closed, homogeneously mixing population with no waning immunity, no demographic turnover during the epidemic time scale, and no behavioral change. The basic reproduction number is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a single typical infectious case in a wholly susceptible population, denoted by $R_{0}$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Model:** A closed, homogeneously mixing population.\n- **Assumptions:** No waning immunity, no demographic turnover, no behavioral change.\n- **Vaccine Type:** Single-dose, \"leaky\" action.\n- **Vaccine Efficacy ($VE$):** For vaccinated individuals, susceptibility is multiplied by a factor of $(1-VE)$ compared to unvaccinated individuals.\n- **Vaccination Coverage ($p$):** The fraction of the population vaccinated.\n- **Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$):** The average number of secondary infections from a single infectious case in a fully susceptible population.\n- **Effective Reproduction Number ($R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$):** The average number of secondary infections in a population with vaccination.\n- **Elimination Condition:** $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}  1$.\n- **Specific Values:** For measles, $R_0 = 15$ and $VE = 0.95$.\n- **Required Output:** Derive the condition for $p$ in terms of $R_0$ and $VE$, then compute the minimum vaccination coverage for the given values, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a standard exercise in mathematical epidemiology.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The concepts of $R_0$, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy (in both \"leaky\" and \"all-or-nothing\" models), and the elimination threshold ($R_{\\mathrm{eff}}  1$) are fundamental principles in infectious disease dynamics. The assumptions (closed population, homogeneous mixing) are standard for creating a baseline tractable model. The provided values for measles are consistent with epidemiological literature.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions, variables, and constants to derive a unique analytical expression and compute a specific numerical value.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The phrase \"multiplicatively reduced by a factor equal to the vaccine efficacy\" is potentially ambiguous but is immediately and unequivocally clarified by \"so vaccinated individuals have susceptibility multiplied by $(1-VE)$\".\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual in a population where everyone is susceptible. The effective reproduction number, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is a modification of this value that accounts for the reduced average susceptibility of the population due to interventions like vaccination. It can be expressed as:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0 \\times \\bar{s}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{s}$ is the average susceptibility of the population relative to a completely susceptible population (where $\\bar{s}=1$).\n\nThe population is divided into two mutually exclusive groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccinated.\nThe fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is $(1-p)$. By definition, their relative susceptibility is $1$.\nThe fraction of the population that is vaccinated is $p$. The problem states the vaccine is \"leaky,\" and the susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is reduced by the vaccine efficacy, $VE$. Therefore, their relative susceptibility is $(1 - VE)$.\n\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $\\bar{s}$, is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of these two groups, where the weights are the fractions of the population in each group:\n$$\n\\bar{s} = (1 - p) \\times 1 + p \\times (1 - VE)\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\n\\bar{s} = 1 - p + p - p \\cdot VE = 1 - p \\cdot VE\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\bar{s}$ back into the equation for $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0 (1 - p \\cdot VE)\n$$\nThe condition for elimination of the disease is that the effective reproduction number must be less than $1$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{eff}}  1\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ gives the inequality:\n$$\nR_0 (1 - p \\cdot VE)  1\n$$\nTo find the required vaccination coverage $p$, we solve this inequality for $p$:\n$$\n1 - p \\cdot VE  \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}  p \\cdot VE\n$$\n$$\np > \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{VE}\n$$\nThis is the general condition on the vaccination coverage $p$ required to achieve elimination. The minimum vaccination coverage, which we can denote as $p_c$ (for critical coverage), is the value at the boundary of this inequality:\n$$\np_c = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{VE}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for $p_c$ using the given parameters for measles: $R_0 = 15$ and $VE = 0.95$.\n$$\np_c = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{15}}{0.95}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{14}{15}\n$$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$\np_c = \\frac{\\frac{14}{15}}{0.95} = \\frac{14}{15 \\times 0.95}\n$$\nNow, we compute the denominator:\n$$\n15 \\times 0.95 = 15 \\times \\left(1 - 0.05\\right) = 15 - (15 \\times 0.05) = 15 - 0.75 = 14.25\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum coverage is:\n$$\np_c = \\frac{14}{14.25}\n$$\nTo find the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$\np_c \\approx 0.98245614...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 8, 2, 4$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\np_c \\approx 0.9825\n$$\nThus, a minimum of $98.25\\%$ of the population must be vaccinated to eliminate measles under these model assumptions.",
