            "problem": "A national adolescent mental health program is implemented with the goal of reducing mortality due to suicide among adolescents. The baseline adolescent suicide mortality is $8$ deaths per $100{,}000$ adolescents per year. The adolescent population is $5 \\times 10^{6}$, and program evaluation after one year indicates a uniform $20$ percent reduction in the adolescent suicide mortality rate across the entire adolescent population, with no change in population size during the year.\n\nUsing only the core epidemiological definitions of mortality rate (events per $100{,}000$ persons per year), population count, and relative reduction, derive from first principles the expected number of adolescent lives saved in that year by the program. Clearly state your assumptions and intermediate steps grounded in these definitions. Express your final answer as a count (no units).

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for correctness, consistency, and scientific grounding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and conditions provided in the problem statement are:\n- Baseline adolescent suicide mortality rate: $8$ deaths per $100{,}000$ adolescents per year.\n- Adolescent population size: $5 \\times 10^{6}$.\n- Program-induced reduction in mortality rate: a uniform $20$ percent.\n- Time period for evaluation: one year.\n- Assumption: The population size remains constant over the year.\n- Task: Derive the expected number of adolescent lives saved in that year from first principles.\n- First principles are defined as the core epidemiological definitions of mortality rate, population count, and relative reduction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the specified criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard, well-defined concepts in epidemiology and public health (mortality rate, population, relative risk reduction). The values provided are plausible for a national-level program. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data (baseline rate, population size, percentage reduction) to calculate a unique solution. The objective is clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using quantitative, objective language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and its constraints are consistent. The assumption of a constant population size over a single year is a standard simplification in such calculations and does not introduce a contradiction.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is a realistic application of epidemiological principles to evaluate a public health intervention.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nLet the following variables represent the quantities involved:\n- $P$: The total adolescent population.\n- $R_{0}$: The baseline mortality rate per $100{,}000$ persons per year.\n- $p$: The fractional reduction in the mortality rate.\n- $k$: The population scaling factor for the rate, which is $100{,}000$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- $P = 5 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $R_{0} = 8$\n- $p = 20\\% = 0.20$\n- $k = 100{,}000 = 10^{5}$\n\nFrom first principles, the mortality rate $R$ is defined as the number of deaths, $N$, in a given population $P$ over a specific period, scaled by the factor $k$:\n$$R = \\frac{N}{P} \\times k$$\nFrom this definition, the expected number of deaths $N$ for a given rate $R$ and population $P$ can be calculated as:\n$$N = \\frac{R \\times P}{k}$$\nLet $N_{0}$ be the expected number of deaths at the baseline mortality rate $R_{0}$.\n$$N_{0} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times P}{k}$$\nLet $R_{1}$ be the new mortality rate after the program's implementation. The problem states a reduction of $p$, so the new rate is:\n$$R_{1} = R_{0} \\times (1 - p)$$\nThe expected number of deaths at this new rate, $N_{1}$, is:\n$$N_{1} = \\frac{R_{1} \\times P}{k} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times (1 - p) \\times P}{k}$$\nThe number of lives saved, $L_{s}$, is the difference between the expected number of deaths without the program and the expected number of deaths with the program.\n$$L_{s} = N_{0} - N_{1}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{0}$ and $N_{1}$:\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times P}{k} - \\frac{R_{0} \\times (1 - p) \\times P}{k}$$\nFactoring out the common terms $\\frac{R_{0} \\times P}{k}$:\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times P}{k} \\left[ 1 - (1 - p) \\right]$$\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times P}{k} (1 - 1 + p)$$\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{R_{0} \\times P \\times p}{k}$$\nThis final expression represents the number of lives saved derived from the initial definitions. It is the total population-scaled reduction in mortality.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n$$P = 5 \\times 10^{6}$$\n$$R_{0} = 8$$\n$$p = 0.20$$\n$$k = 10^{5}$$\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{8 \\times (5 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.20}{10^{5}}$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{8 \\times 5 \\times 0.20 \\times 10^{6}}{10^{5}}$$\n$$L_{s} = (8 \\times 5 \\times 0.20) \\times \\frac{10^{6}}{10^{5}}$$\n$$L_{s} = (40 \\times 0.20) \\times 10^{6-5}$$\n$$L_{s} = 8 \\times 10^{1}$$\n$$L_{s} = 80$$\nThe expected number of adolescent lives saved in that year by the program is $80$. Since this result is an integer, no rounding is required.",

Understanding this concept is fundamental for designing and implementing effective and ethical screening programs.",

Report the PPV as a decimal fraction, not a percent, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that an adolescent has the mental health condition.\n- $D^c$: The event that an adolescent does not have the condition.\n- $T^+$: The event that the screening questionnaire result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the screening questionnaire result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be translated into probabilistic statements:\n1.  The prevalence of the condition, $P(D)$, is given as $0.05$.\n    $$ P(D) = 0.05 $$\n    From this, the probability of not having the condition is:\n    $$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 $$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the person has the condition.\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.7 $$\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the person does not have the condition.\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95 $$\n    From specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the person does not have the condition.\n    $$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe objective is to derive and compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that an adolescent truly has the condition given that they have a positive test result, denoted as $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to find this conditional probability. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of a positive test result in the population. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which considers both true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write this as:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem gives the full formula for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\n\nThis expression for PPV is derived using only the core definitions of probability and Bayes' theorem.
