            "problem": "A country is designing a contributory Social Health Insurance (SHI) scheme financed by a flat payroll contribution rate. Let the expected per capita health expenditure be $c$ (treated as a positive constant), the number of covered persons be $N$ (treated as a positive constant), and the total formal wage base subject to contributions be $W$ (assumed strictly positive). Assume the scheme targets budget balance in expectation such that total expected revenues equal total expected expenditures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a payroll contribution rate, $\\tau$, for a Social Health Insurance (SHI) scheme and the calculation of its elasticity with respect to the total formal wage base, $W$. The derivation proceeds from first principles based on the provided definitions and the condition of expected budget balance.\n\nFirst, we formalize the components of the budget identity.\nThe total expected expenditures, $E_{total}$, are the product of the expected per capita health expenditure, $c$, and the number of covered persons, $N$.\n$$E_{total} = cN$$\nThe total expected revenues, $R_{total}$, are the product of the flat payroll contribution rate, $\\tau$, and the total formal wage base, $W$.\n$$R_{total} = \\tau W$$\nThe scheme targets an expected budget balance, which implies that total expected revenues must equal total expected expenditures.\n$$R_{total} = E_{total}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for revenues and expenditures into this identity gives the core budget equation:\n$$\\tau W = cN$$\nTo find the payroll contribution rate $\\tau$ that achieves this balance, we solve for $\\tau$ by dividing both sides by $W$ (which is strictly positive).\n$$\\tau = \\frac{cN}{W}$$\nThis expression gives the contribution rate $\\tau$ as a function of the per capita cost $c$, the covered population $N$, and the wage base $W$.\n\nNext, we find the sensitivity of $\\tau$ to the formal wage base $W$, defined by the elasticity $E_W$:\n$$E_{W} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial W}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTo compute $E_W$, we first need the partial derivative of $\\tau$ with respect to $W$. Treating $c$ and $N$ as constants, we can express $\\tau$ as a power function of $W$:\n$$\\tau(W) = (cN) W^{-1}$$\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we find the derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial W} = -cNW^{-2} = -\\frac{cN}{W^2}$$\nNow, we substitute both the derivative and the original expression for $\\tau$ into the elasticity formula:\n$$E_{W} = \\left(-\\frac{cN}{W^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{W}{\\frac{cN}{W}}\\right)$$\nWe simplify the second term in the product:\n$$\\frac{W}{\\frac{cN}{W}} = W \\cdot \\frac{W}{cN} = \\frac{W^2}{cN}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E_W$:\n$$E_{W} = \\left(-\\frac{cN}{W^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{W^2}{cN}\\right)$$\nThe terms $(cN)$ and $W^2$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n$$E_W = -1$$\nThe elasticity of the payroll contribution rate $\\tau$ with respect to the wage base $W$ is a constant value of $-1$. This signifies that a 1% increase in the wage base allows for a 1% decrease in the contribution rate to maintain budget balance, holding other factors constant.

            "problem": "Consider a single-payer health insurance market operating under community rating, where a single premium $p$ is charged to all enrollees regardless of risk type. The population is composed of two actuarially distinct risk types: a low-risk type with expected annual health care cost $c_{L}$ and a high-risk type with expected annual health care cost $c_{H}$. Among those who enroll, the share of low-risk individuals is $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and the share of high-risk individuals is $1-\\alpha$. Assume zero administrative loading and zero profits, and that insurers must satisfy a break-even constraint based on the expected cost of the enrolled pool.\n\nUsing the definitions of actuarial fairness and the break-even constraint (expected revenue equals expected cost in expectation), derive the community-rated break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$ as a function of $\\alpha$, $c_{L}$, and $c_{H}$. Then, under the assumption $c_{L}<c_{H}$, use first principles to explain the direction of adverse selection pressure on low-risk enrollment by analyzing how $p^{\\ast}$ changes as $\\alpha$ varies. Your explanation should be based on the sign of the appropriate derivative and its interpretation in terms of incentives.\n\nExpress the premium $p^{\\ast}$ in monetary units consistent with $c_{L}$ and $c_{H}$ (e.g., dollars). Provide your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $p^{\\ast}$; do not include units in your boxed final answer.",
            "solution": "This problem requires us to derive the break-even community-rated premium, $p^{\\ast}$, and then analyze the adverse selection pressure on low-risk individuals.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Break-Even Premium ($p^{\\ast}$)**\n\nThe insurer operates under a break-even constraint, meaning expected revenue must equal expected cost. There are no profits or administrative loads.\n\n-   The expected revenue per enrollee is the community-rated premium, $p$.\n-   The expected cost per enrollee, $E[c]$, is the weighted average of the costs of the two risk types in the pool. With a share $\\alpha$ of low-risk individuals (cost $c_L$) and a share $1-\\alpha$ of high-risk individuals (cost $c_H$), the expected cost is:\n    $$E[c] = \\alpha \\cdot c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot c_{H}$$\n\nSetting revenue equal to cost gives the break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\alpha c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) c_{H}$$\n\n**2. Analysis of Adverse Selection Pressure**\n\nTo understand the adverse selection pressure, we examine how the premium $p^{\\ast}$ changes as the proportion of low-risk individuals, $\\alpha$, changes. We do this by taking the first derivative of $p^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, rewrite the premium function:\n$$p^{\\ast}(\\alpha) = \\alpha c_{L} + c_{H} - \\alpha c_{H} = \\alpha (c_{L} - c_{H}) + c_{H}$$\n\nNow, differentiate with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha} = c_{L} - c_{H}$$\n\nGiven the assumption that low-risk individuals are less costly ($c_L  c_H$), the term $(c_L - c_H)$ is negative. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}  0$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe negative derivative means that the break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$ is a decreasing function of $\\alpha$. If low-risk individuals leave the pool, $\\alpha$ decreases, which in turn forces the premium $p^{\\ast}$ to increase for everyone remaining.\n\nThis creates adverse selection pressure. In a community-rated pool, the premium $p^{\\ast}$ will always be higher than the low-risk cost ($p^{\\ast} > c_L$) and lower than the high-risk cost ($p^{\\ast}  c_H$). Low-risk individuals are thus overcharged relative to their expected cost and have a financial incentive to exit the market. As they exit, $\\alpha$ falls, $p^{\\ast}$ rises, and the insurance becomes an even worse deal for the remaining low-risk individuals, potentially leading to a \"death spiral\" where the market unravels.",

            "problem": "A national single-payer health insurer is evaluating two preventive interventions against current standard care using a cost-effectiveness decision rule based on a willingness-to-pay threshold per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY).

Check for Dominance**\n\nThe interventions are ordered by increasing effectiveness: Standard Care, Intervention $\\mathcal{A}$, Intervention $\\mathcal{B}$.\n-   No intervention is strictly dominated, as higher effectiveness comes with higher cost.\n-   We must check for **extended dominance**. This occurs if the ICER of a more effective option relative to an intermediate one is lower than the ICER of the intermediate option relative to the baseline. We calculate the ICER of $\\mathcal{B}$ vs. $\\mathcal{A}$:\n    $$ICER_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{\\Delta C_{\\mathcal{B}} - \\Delta C_{\\mathcal{A}}}{\\Delta Q_{\\mathcal{B}} - \\Delta Q_{\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{\\$8,000 - \\$5,000}{0.4 - 0.2} = \\frac{\\$3,000}{0.2} = \\$15,000 \\text{ per QALY}$$\n-   Since $ICER_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} (\\$15,000)  ICER_{\\mathcal{A} \\text{ vs } S} (\\$25,000)$, intervention $\\mathcal{A}$ is eliminated by extended dominance. The efficient pathway is directly from standard care to intervention $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n**3.

The relevant ICER is $ICER_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } S} = \\$20,000$ per QALY.\n-   The insurer's willingness-to-pay threshold is $\\lambda = \\$30,000$ per QALY.\n-   Since $ICER_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } S}  \\lambda$, intervention $\\mathcal{B}$ is considered cost-effective and is the efficient choice.\n\n**4. Calculate Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB)**\n\nThe final step is to compute the INMB of the efficient intervention ($\\mathcal{B}$) relative to the alternative intervention ($\\mathcal{A}$) using the formula:\n$$INMB_{i \\text{ vs } j} = \\lambda \\times (Q_i - Q_j) - (C_i - C_j)$$\n\n$$INMB_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} = \\lambda \\times (\\Delta Q_{\\mathcal{B}} - \\Delta Q_{\\mathcal{A}}) - (\\Delta C_{\\mathcal{B}} - \\Delta C_{\\mathcal{A}})$$\n$$INMB_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} = \\$30,000 \\times (0.4 - 0.2) - (\\$8,000 - \\$5,000)$$\n$$INMB_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} = \\$30,000 \\times 0.2 - \\$3,000$$\n$$INMB_{\\mathcal{B} \\text{ vs } \\mathcal{A}} = \\$6,000 - \\$3,000 = \\$3,000$$\n\nThe incremental net monetary benefit of choosing $\\mathcal{B}$ over $\\mathcal{A}$ is $3,000.",
