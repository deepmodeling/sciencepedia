            "problem": "A district health manager is evaluating immunization continuity in line with the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach articulated by the Alma-Ata Declaration, which emphasizes equitable access and continuity of essential services such as routine immunization. A key indicator used is the dropout between the first and third doses of the Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) vaccine. By definition, coverage for a given dose is the proportion of the target cohort that received that dose, and the DTP1-to-DTP3 dropout is the proportion of those who started the series (received DTP1) who did not complete the third dose (received DTP3).\n\nThe district has 2 subdistricts with the following end-of-year summaries for surviving infants within the catchment:\n- Subdistrict A: target cohort size $N_{A} = 8{,}000$, DTP1 coverage $C_{1,A} = 0.95$, DTP3 coverage $C_{3,A} = 0.88$.\n- Subdistrict B: target cohort size $N_{B} = 2{,}000$, DTP1 coverage $C_{1,B} = 0.75$, DTP3 coverage $C_{3,B} = 0.60$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of coverage (recipients divided by target cohort) and dropout (proportion of starters who did not complete), compute the district-level DTP1-to-DTP3 dropout as a single decimal fraction based on the implied counts, not by averaging percentages. The Ministry of Health classifies retention as adequate if dropout is less than $0.10$.\n\nRound your answer to $4$ significant figures and express it as a pure number (no percentage sign). Then, based on this value and the threshold, briefly state whether retention is adequate or needs attention. Your final numeric answer should be only the dropout value.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and objectivity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data and definitions:\n- Definition of coverage: The proportion of the target cohort that received a given dose.\n- Definition of DTP1-to-DTP3 dropout: The proportion of those who started the series (received DTP1) who did not complete the third dose.\n- Subdistrict A:\n  - Target cohort size: $N_{A} = 8{,}000$\n  - DTP1 coverage: $C_{1,A} = 0.95$\n  - DTP3 coverage: $C_{3,A} = 0.88$\n- Subdistrict B:\n  - Target cohort size: $N_{B} = 2{,}000$\n  - DTP1 coverage: $C_{1,B} = 0.75$\n  - DTP3 coverage: $C_{3,B} = 0.60$\n- Calculation method: The district-level dropout must be computed based on implied counts, not by averaging percentages.\n- Evaluation threshold: Retention is adequate if dropout is less than $0.10$.\n- Required output format: The final dropout value should be a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses standard, well-defined epidemiological metrics (coverage, dropout rate) central to public health program evaluation, particularly in immunization, as framed by the principles of the Alma-Ata Declaration. The definitions provided are standard in the field. The premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides all necessary data ($N_A$, $N_B$, $C_{1,A}$, $C_{3,A}$, $C_{1,B}$, $C_{3,B}$) and explicitly defines the quantities to be calculated. The instruction to use \"implied counts, not by averaging percentages\" removes any ambiguity about the aggregation method, ensuring a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjective or opinion-based language. The threshold for \"adequate\" retention is given as an objective criterion.\n- **Internal Consistency**: The data are consistent. For both subdistricts, the DTP1 coverage is greater than the DTP3 coverage ($0.95 > 0.88$ for A, and $0.75 > 0.60$ for B), which is logically necessary, as the number of children receiving a third dose cannot exceed the number who received the first.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective question rooted in standard public health analysis. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the district-level DTP1-to-DTP3 dropout rate. The problem specifies that this calculation must be based on the absolute number of children, not on an average of the subdistrict dropout percentages.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of children who received the DTP1 and DTP3 doses in each subdistrict. The number of recipients is the product of the coverage rate and the target cohort size.\n\nFor Subdistrict A:\nNumber of children receiving DTP1:\n$$n_{1,A} = C_{1,A} \\times N_{A} = 0.95 \\times 8{,}000 = 7{,}600$$\nNumber of children receiving DTP3:\n$$n_{3,A} = C_{3,A} \\times N_{A} = 0.88 \\times 8{,}000 = 7{,}040$$\n\nFor Subdistrict B:\nNumber of children receiving DTP1:\n$$n_{1,B} = C_{1,B} \\times N_{B} = 0.75 \\times 2{,}000 = 1{,}500$$\nNumber of children receiving DTP3:\n$$n_{3,B} = C_{3,B} \\times N_{B} = 0.60 \\times 2{,}000 = 1{,}200$$\n\nNext, we aggregate these counts to obtain the total numbers for the entire district.\nTotal number of children in the district who received DTP1 (the \"starters\"):\n$$n_{1,Total} = n_{1,A} + n_{1,B} = 7{,}600 + 1{,}500 = 9{,}100$$\nTotal number of children in the district who received DTP3 (the \"completers\"):\n$$n_{3,Total} = n_{3,A} + n_{3,B} = 7{,}040 + 1{,}200 = 8{,}240$$\n\nThe dropout rate is defined as the proportion of children who started the DTP series but did not complete it. The number of dropouts is the difference between the number of starters and the number of completers.\nNumber of dropouts:\n$$n_{dropout} = n_{1,Total} - n_{3,Total} = 9{,}100 - 8{,}240 = 860$$\n\nThe district-level dropout rate, $D_{District}$, is the number of dropouts divided by the total number of starters.\n$$D_{District} = \\frac{n_{1,Total} - n_{3,Total}}{n_{1,Total}} = \\frac{860}{9{,}100}$$\n\nNow, we compute the decimal value:\n$$D_{District} = \\frac{860}{9{,}100} \\approx 0.0945054945...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first significant figure is $9$, followed by $4$, $5$, and $0$. The subsequent digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the last significant digit.\n$$D_{District} \\approx 0.09451$$\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the Ministry of Health's threshold of $0.10$.\nSince $0.09451  0.10$, the district's immunization retention is classified as adequate.\nThe final numeric answer is the dropout value itself.",

Let us define the given quantities symbolically:\n- $N_{enc}$: Total number of outpatient encounters $= 300$.\n- $N_{med}$: Total number of medicines prescribed $= 585$.\n- $N_{gen}$: Total number of medicines prescribed by generic name $= 525$.\n- $N_{abx}$: Number of encounters with at least one antibiotic prescribed $= 210$.\n\nEach indicator will be calculated according to its definition and then rounded to three significant figures.\n\n**1. Average number of medicines per encounter ($I_1$)**\nThis indicator is defined as the total number of medicines prescribed divided by the total number of outpatient encounters.\n$$I_1 = \\frac{N_{med}}{N_{enc}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_1 = \\frac{585}{300} = 1.95$$\nThe result, $1.95$, already has exactly three significant figures ($1$, $9$, and $5$). No rounding is necessary.\nThis value of $1.95$ is above the WHO-referenced target range of $1.6$ to $1.8$, suggesting potential over-prescription.\n\n**2. Proportion of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed ($I_2$)**\nThis indicator is defined as the number of encounters in which an antibiotic was prescribed divided by the total number of outpatient encounters.\n$$I_2 = \\frac{N_{abx}}{N_{enc}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_2 = \\frac{210}{300} = 0.7$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.7$ has only one significant figure. To express this with three significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$I_2 \\approx 0.700$$\nThis value of $0.700$ is substantially higher than the WHO-referenced target range of $0.20$ to $0.30$, indicating significant over-prescription of antibiotics.\n\n**3. Proportion of medicines prescribed by generic name ($I_3$)**\nThis indicator is defined as the total number of medicines prescribed by generic name divided by the total number of medicines prescribed.\n$$I_3 = \\frac{N_{gen}}{N_{med}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_3 = \\frac{525}{585}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$I_3 \\approx 0.897435897...$$\nTo round this to three significant figures, we examine the first four significant digits: $8$, $9$, $7$, and $4$. Since the fourth digit ($4$) is less than $5$, we round down, keeping the third digit as is.\n$$I_3 \\approx 0.897$$\nThis value of $0.897$ is below the ideal WHO-referenced target of $1.00$ (which represents $100\\%$ generic prescribing), but it indicates a relatively high rate of generic prescribing.\n\nThe three computed indicators, rounded to three significant figures and presented in the specified order, are $1.95$, $0.700$, and $0.897$.",
