            "introduction": "The duration of a patent is the cornerstone of the intellectual property system for pharmaceuticals, defining the period of market exclusivity. While the TRIPS Agreement sets a baseline, many free trade agreements introduce 'TRIPS-Plus' provisions that can extend this term, such as compensating for delays in regulatory approval. This exercise  will allow you to calculate the precise length of a patent term by applying these rules, providing a concrete understanding of how legal clauses translate into real-world timelines for market access.",

            "problem": "A country that is party to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is implementing a hypothetical Free Trade Agreement (FTA) obligation for pharmaceutical patents. Under TRIPS, the minimum patent term is $20$ years from the filing date. The FTA obligation states that, for pharmaceuticals, if the regulatory authority’s marketing approval review exceeds a statutory benchmark of $1$ year (with no applicant-caused delay), the patent term shall be restored by the portion of the review beyond the $1$-year benchmark, up to a maximum of $3$ years. Assume the Gregorian calendar leap year rules: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by $4$, except years divisible by $100$ are not leap years unless they are divisible by $400$.\n\nA pharmaceutical patent is filed on $2007$-$06$-$15$. The marketing authorization application for the patented drug is submitted on $2018$-$01$-$01$ and approval is granted on $2021$-$01$-$01$. There is no applicant-caused delay.\n\nUsing the TRIPS $20$-year-from-filing rule and the FTA’s restoration condition as described, compute the total number of days from the filing date to the restored patent term end date. Express your final answer as a number of days. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it presents a well-defined mathematical calculation based on a clear and consistent set of axiomatic rules. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, admitting a unique numerical solution. The process to solve it involves date and duration calculations.\n\nThe solution is derived in four main steps:\n1.  Determine the base patent term expiration date.\n2.  Calculate the duration of the patent term restoration.\n3.  Determine the final, restored patent expiration date.\n4.  Compute the total number of days from the filing date to the restored expiration date.\n\nFirst, we establish the base patent term. The patent was filed on the date $D_{\\text{file}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. According to TRIPS, the minimum patent term is $T_{\\text{base}} = 20$ years from the filing date. Therefore, the base patent expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,base}}$, is calculated as:\n$$D_{\\text{expire,base}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15 + 20 \\text{ years} = 2027\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the patent term restoration. The regulatory review period for marketing authorization began on the submission date, $D_{\\text{submit}} = 2018\\text{-}01\\text{-}01$, and concluded on the approval date, $D_{\\text{approve}} = 2021\\text{-}01\\text{-}01$. The duration of this review, $T_{\\text{review}}$, is the interval between these two dates:\n$$T_{\\text{review}} = D_{\\text{approve}} - D_{\\text{submit}} = (2021\\text{-}01\\text{-}01) - (2018\\text{-}01\\text{-}01) = 3 \\text{ years}$$\nThe statutory benchmark for the review process is given as $T_{\\text{benchmark}} = 1$ year. The restoration is granted for the portion of the review period that exceeds this benchmark. This eligible restoration period, $T_{\\text{eligible}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\text{eligible}} = T_{\\text{review}} - T_{\\text{benchmark}} = 3 \\text{ years} - 1 \\text{ year} = 2 \\text{ years}$$\nThe FTA specifies a maximum restoration period of $T_{\\text{max\\_restore}} = 3$ years. The actual restoration granted, $T_{\\text{restore}}$, is the minimum of the eligible period and the maximum allowed period:\n$$T_{\\text{restore}} = \\min(T_{\\text{eligible}}, T_{\\text{max\\_restore}}) = \\min(2 \\text{ years}, 3 \\text{ years}) = 2 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThird, we determine the restored patent expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,restored}}$. This is found by adding the restoration period to the base expiration date:\n$$D_{\\text{expire,restored}} = D_{\\text{expire,base}} + T_{\\text{restore}} = 2027\\text{-}06\\text{-}15 + 2 \\text{ years} = 2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of days from the filing date, $D_{\\text{file}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$, to the restored expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,restored}} = 2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. The total duration in years is $2029 - 2007 = 22$ years. To convert this duration into days, we must account for leap years, which have $366$ days instead of the standard $365$.\n\nAccording to the Gregorian calendar rule provided, a leap year occurs if the year is divisible by $4$, unless it is divisible by $100$ but not by $400$. We must count the number of leap days (February $29$) that fall within the period from $2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$ to $2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. The leap years in this interval are:\n$2008$, $2012$, $2016$, $2020$, $2024$, and $2028$.\nNone of these years are divisible by $100$. Thus, there are $N_{\\text{leap}} = 6$ leap years during the patent term. The total duration spans $N_{\\text{total}} = 22$ years. The number of non-leap years is $N_{\\text{non-leap}} = N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{leap}} = 22 - 6 = 16$.\n\nThe total number of days, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the days in all the non-leap and leap years:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (N_{\\text{non-leap}} \\times 365) + (N_{\\text{leap}} \\times 366)$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (16 \\times 365) + (6 \\times 366)$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 5840 + 2196 = 8036$$\nAn equivalent calculation is to take the number of days in $22$ standard years and add the number of extra days from the $6$ leap years:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (22 \\times 365) + 6 = 8030 + 6 = 8036$$\nThe total duration of the patent from the filing date to the restored end date is $8036$ days.",

            "introduction": "Market exclusivity for a new drug is not always determined by a single patent. Pharmaceutical innovators can also benefit from Regulatory Data Exclusivity (RDE), which protects their clinical trial data from being used by generic competitors for a certain period.

Express your final answer in years. No rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A pharmaceutical product's patent runs for $20$ years from the date of filing.\n- Regulatory data exclusivity (RDE) runs for $8$ years from the date of marketing approval.\n- The patent application is filed at time $t=0$ years.\n- Marketing approval occurs at time $t=6$ years.\n- The patent protection interval is given as $t=0$ to $t=20$.\n- The RDE interval is given as $t=6$ to $t=14$.\n- The task is to determine the duration in years during which both protections are simultaneously in force.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is subjected to a rigorous validation check.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the fields of intellectual property law and regulatory science as they apply to pharmaceuticals. While not a problem of natural science, it is structured as a formal, logical problem involving the analysis of time intervals, which is a valid mathematical exercise. The premises are consistent with real-world regulatory frameworks like TRIPS.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two clearly defined time intervals and asks for the length of their intersection. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is unambiguous. A unique and stable solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language, free of subjectivity or opinion.\n- **Consistency Check**: The givens are internally consistent. A patent term of $20$ years from filing at $t=0$ correctly yields the interval $[0, 20]$. An RDE term of $8$ years from marketing approval at $t=6$ correctly yields the interval starting at $t=6$ and ending at $t = 6 + 8 = 14$, which is the interval $[6, 14]$. The provided intervals are therefore consistent with the definitions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires finding the duration of the period during which two forms of legal protection, patent protection and regulatory data exclusivity (RDE), are concurrently active. This is a mathematical problem of determining the length of the intersection of two closed intervals on the time axis.\n\nLet $t$ represent time in years, with the patent filing date as the origin, $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we formally define the time intervals for each protection based on the provided data.\nLet $I_P$ be the interval of time during which the patent is in force. The patent is filed at $t=0$ and has a term of $20$ years. Therefore, the interval is:\n$$I_P = [0, 20]$$\n\nLet $I_{RDE}$ be the interval of time during which RDE is in force. RDE begins at the date of marketing approval, $t=6$, and lasts for $8$ years. Therefore, the interval is:\n$$I_{RDE} = [6, 6+8] = [6, 14]$$\n\nThe period during which both protections are simultaneously in force is the intersection of these two intervals, denoted as $I_{\\text{overlap}}$.\n$$I_{\\text{overlap}} = I_P \\cap I_{RDE}$$\n\nWe calculate the intersection of the two intervals:\n$$I_{\\text{overlap}} = [0, 20] \\cap [6, 14]$$\n\nFor two general closed intervals $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$, their intersection is given by $[\\max(a, c), \\min(b, d)]$. This new interval is non-empty if and only if $\\max(a, c) \\le \\min(b, d)$.\n\nApplying this to our specific intervals, we have:\n- The start of the overlap period is $\\max(0, 6) = 6$.\n- The end of the overlap period is $\\min(20, 14) = 14$.\n\nThus, the interval of simultaneous protection is:\n$$I_{\\text{overlap}} = [6, 14]$$\n\nThe question asks for the duration of this period. The duration, $\\Delta t$, of an interval $[t_{\\text{start}}, t_{\\text{end}}]$ is calculated as $t_{\\text{end}} - t_{\\text{start}}$.\nFor our overlap interval, the duration is:\n$$\\Delta t = 14 - 6 = 8$$\n\nThe duration during which both protections are simultaneously in force is $8$ years.",

            "introduction": "The TRIPS Agreement, while establishing strong IP standards, also contains crucial 'flexibilities' designed to protect public health. One of the most powerful of these is the compulsory license, which allows a government to authorize the production of a patented product without the consent of the patent holder. This exercise  provides a powerful, quantitative look at the real-world impact of such a license, translating a legal mechanism directly into the number of additional patients that can be treated within a fixed healthcare budget.",

            "problem": "A national health program in a low-income country uses a compulsory license under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to procure a patented antiretroviral medicine as a generic. The pre-license price per full treatment course is $600$, and the post-license generic price per course is $60$. The health ministry has a fixed budget of $12{,}000{,}000$ for this medicine for the year. Procurement requires an additional overhead equal to $0.10$ of the value of medicines purchased (covering shipping, quality assurance, and distribution), and this overhead must be paid from the same fixed budget. Each patient requires exactly $1$ full course, and partial courses cannot be purchased. Assume every purchased course is administered to a distinct patient.\n\nStarting from core budget-constraint principles and without using any pre-provided formulas, determine the maximum number of patients who can be fully treated under the compulsory license scenario described above.

The total procurement cost consists of the medicine cost plus the overhead on that cost. Therefore, the total cost $C_{\\text{total}}$ is\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = N P + o(N P) = N P(1 + o).\n$$\nThe budget constraint requires\n$$\nN P(1 + o) \\leq B.\n$$\nSince only whole courses can be purchased, the maximal feasible $N$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $B / (P(1 + o))$:\n$$\nN_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{B}{P(1 + o)} \\right\\rfloor.\n$$\nSubstitute the given quantities: $B = 12{,}000{,}000$, $P = 60$, and $o = 0.10$.
