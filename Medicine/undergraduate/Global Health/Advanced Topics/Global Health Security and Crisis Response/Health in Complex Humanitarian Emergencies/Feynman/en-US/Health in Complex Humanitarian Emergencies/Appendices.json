This foundational practice  hones your analytical skills by challenging you to apply the formal definition of a Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE) to a realistic, data-rich field scenario.

            "problem": "A national public health authority and a United Nations coordination cell receive converging reports from multiple districts affected by armed conflict. Situation monitoring over the last $4$ weeks shows the following: approximately $300{,}000$ persons have been displaced across internal and cross-border routes; routine weekly facility status dashboards indicate that more than $40\\%$ of primary health care facilities are non-functional or closed due to staff flight, supply chain disruption, and direct attacks; and field teams report widespread insecurity, including armed checkpoints and sporadic shelling, that regularly prevents humanitarian teams and civilians from accessing services. There are no reliable crude mortality rate estimates yet because recent surveys were interrupted, but sentinel surveillance of notifiable diseases is only partially operational. No formal international appeal has yet been issued by the national government, which is internally divided.\n\nUsing foundational definitions widely adopted in global health and humanitarian practice, a complex humanitarian emergency (CHE) is a severe humanitarian crisis resulting from a breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife, characterized by multi-causal drivers and a collapse or severe disruption of essential services, large-scale population displacement, and insecurity that impedes access, typically requiring a multi-sectoral and often international response. The crude mortality rate (CMR) threshold of approximately $1$ death per $10{,}000$ persons per $\\text{day}$ is commonly used to flag acute excess mortality but is not, by itself, the sole determinant of whether a crisis is a CHE.\n\nBased only on the evidence provided and applying the CHE classification framework grounded in these core definitions, which option best classifies the situation and correctly identifies the decisive indicators for that classification?\n\nA.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following data, conditions, and definitions:\n*   **Timeframe:** Situation monitoring over the last $4$ weeks.\n*   **Population Displacement:** Approximately $300,000$ persons have been displaced across internal and cross-border routes.\n*   **Health System Status:** More than $40\\%$ of primary health care facilities are non-functional or closed.\n*   **Reasons for Health System Dysfunction:** Staff flight, supply chain disruption, and direct attacks.\n*   **Security Situation:** Widespread insecurity, including armed checkpoints and sporadic shelling, regularly prevents humanitarian teams and civilians from accessing services.\n*   **Mortality Data:** No reliable crude mortality rate (CMR) estimates are available. Recent surveys were interrupted.\n*   **Disease Surveillance:** Sentinel surveillance of notifiable diseases is only partially operational.\n*   **Political Context:** The national government is internally divided.\n*   **International Appeal:** No formal international appeal has been issued by the national government.\n*   **Definition of Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE):** A severe humanitarian crisis resulting from a breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife, characterized by multi-causal drivers and a collapse or severe disruption of essential services, large-scale population displacement, and insecurity that impedes access, typically requiring a multi-sectoral and often international response.\n*   **Role of Crude Mortality Rate (CMR):** The CMR threshold of approximately $1$ death per $10,000$ persons per day is commonly used to flag acute excess mortality but is not, by itself, the sole determinant of whether a crisis is a CHE.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is to be evaluated for validity.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set within the field of global health and humanitarian aid. The definitions, such as that for a CHE, and indicators, like CMR, displacement figures, and health system functionality, are standard and well-established in this field. The scenario described is a realistic representation of an emerging crisis in a conflict-affected region. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific definition and a set of observational data. It asks for a classification based on applying the former to the latter. The information is sufficient to perform this classification, and the question is structured to lead to a unique conclusion among the options. The explicit clarification on the role of CMR data prevents ambiguity. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is descriptive and factual, presenting situation reports and established definitions without subjective or emotional loading. The question asks for an objective application of a classification framework.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. All terms are either commonly understood in the domain or explicitly defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine if the described situation constitutes a Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE) based *only* on the provided definition and evidence.\n\nThe provided definition of a CHE has several key components:\n1.  **Causal Factor:** A breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife.\n2.  **Core Characteristics:**\n    a. A collapse or severe disruption of essential services.\n    b. Large-scale population displacement.\n    c. Insecurity that impedes access.\n3.  **Typical Requirement:** A multi-sectoral and often international response.\n\nLet us systematically evaluate the provided evidence against this definition.\n\n1.  **Causal Factor:** The situation occurs in districts \"affected by armed conflict.\" The government is \"internally divided,\" and the health system is collapsing due to \"direct attacks,\" among other reasons. This evidence strongly supports the predicate of a \"breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife.\"\n\n2.  **Core Characteristics:**\n    *   **a. Severe disruption of essential services:** The report states that \"more than $40\\%$ of primary health care facilities are non-functional or closed\" due to \"supply chain disruption\" and \"direct attacks.\" The closure of such a large fraction of a critical service like primary health care constitutes a \"severe disruption of essential services.\"\n    *   **b. Large-scale population displacement:** The report indicates \"approximately $300,000$ persons have been displaced.\" A displacement of this magnitude is unambiguously \"large-scale.\"\n    *   **c. Insecurity that impedes access:** The reports mention \"widespread insecurity, including armed checkpoints and sporadic shelling, that regularly prevents humanitarian teams and civilians from accessing services.\" This statement directly and explicitly satisfies the criterion of \"insecurity that impedes access.\"\n\n3.  **Typical Requirement:** The definition notes that a CHE \"typically requir[es]\" an international response. The current situation, with a collapsing health system, large-scale displacement, and a divided national government, clearly points to a need for a response that exceeds national capacity, thereby fitting this description. The absence of a formal *request* for aid does not negate the *need* for it.\n\n**Intermediate Conclusion:** The situation described in the problem statement meets all the core definitional criteria for a Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE). The decisive indicators are the multiple, converging pieces of evidence that align directly with the definition: the context of conflict, large-scale displacement, severe service disruption, and access constraints due to insecurity.\n\nThe problem also explicitly states that the CMR threshold of $1$ death per $10,000$ persons per day \"is not, by itself, the sole determinant of whether a crisis is a CHE.\" Therefore, the absence of reliable CMR data does not preclude the classification of the situation as a CHE, especially when other core indicators are so strongly present.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The situation meets CHE criteria; decisive indicators are the scale of displacement (approximately $300,000$ persons), sustained health system dysfunction (weekly closures exceeding $40\\%$), and widespread insecurity constraining access to services and response.**\nThis option correctly concludes that the situation meets the CHE criteria. It also correctly identifies the key pieces of evidence provided in the scenario—displacement, health system disruption, and insecurity impeding access—as the decisive indicators that map directly onto the multi-part definition of a CHE. This aligns perfectly with the derivation above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The situation does not meet CHE criteria because, without verified CMR exceeding $1/10,000/\\text{day}$, the classification cannot be made regardless of displacement, facility closures, or insecurity.**\nThis option is factually incorrect according to the problem's own framework. The problem explicitly states that the CMR threshold is \"not, by itself, the sole determinant.\" This option incorrectly elevates the CMR criterion to be a necessary condition for classification, which is a direct contradiction of the provided text.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The situation meets CHE criteria, but the only decisive indicator is the number of displaced persons; health facility closures and insecurity are not decisive for classification.**\nThis option correctly concludes that the situation is a CHE but incorrectly minimizes the importance of other indicators. The definition of a CHE is explicitly multi-causal and multi-characteristic, including \"collapse or severe disruption of essential services\" and \"insecurity that impedes access\" as core components on par with displacement. To claim that only displacement is decisive is to ignore the explicit, multi-faceted definition provided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The situation does not meet CHE criteria because facility closures must exceed $50\\%$ to count as severe health system disruption; closures above $40\\%$ are insufficient.**\nThis option introduces an arbitrary threshold ($>50\\%$) that is not mentioned anywhere in the problem statement. The term \"severe disruption\" is not defined by a precise numerical cutoff in the text. Given the context of \"direct attacks\" and \"supply chain disruption,\" the reported closure of \"more than $40\\%$\" of facilities is a sufficiently strong piece of evidence for \"severe disruption.\" This option invents an unsupported rule to invalidate the conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The situation meets CHE criteria only if a formal international appeal is issued; without a formal request, the classification cannot be applied despite displacement and insecurity.**\nThis option conflates the objective reality of a crisis with the political act of requesting aid. TheCHE definition states that such a crisis \"typically requir[es]\" an international response, describing an inherent characteristic of the situation (i.e., its scale exceeds national capacity), not a procedural prerequisite for its classification. A crisis is defined by the conditions on the ground, not by diplomatic declarations. In fact, the \"internally divided\" government's failure to issue an appeal is further evidence of the \"breakdown of authority\" central to the CHE definition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that correctly classifies the situation and accurately identifies the decisive evidence based on the provided framework is A.",

            "problem": "In a sudden-onset complex humanitarian emergency, a field primary care clinic is established to serve a displaced population of $10000$ people. Surveillance from similar settings indicates an average consultation rate of $1$ consultation per person per month. Each clinical consultation takes $10$ minutes of provider time. The clinic is planned to operate every day of a $30$-day month, with providers scheduled in $8$-hour shifts. Assume demand is evenly distributed across operating days and that an absenteeism rate of $0.20$ reduces available provider time proportionally (for example, due to illness, insecurity, or transport disruptions common in such emergencies). Using only these assumptions and definitions of flow and capacity, compute the required number of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) clinicians on duty per $8$-hour shift needed to meet demand. Express the final result as the number of FTE clinicians and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the number of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) clinicians required per $8$-hour shift to meet the healthcare demand of a displaced population. The solution is found by balancing the total required provider time (demand) with the total available effective provider time (capacity).\n\nFirst, we define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- Population size: $P = 10000$\n- Consultation rate: $R = 1$ consultation per person per month\n- Time per consultation: $T_{\\text{consult}} = 10$ minutes\n- Duration of the period: $D = 30$ days\n- Shift length: $L_{\\text{shift}} = 8$ hours\n- Absenteeism rate: $r_a = 0.20$\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total demand for clinical services in terms of provider time over the entire month.\n\nTotal number of consultations per month, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the population size and the consultation rate:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = P \\times R = 10000 \\text{ people} \\times 1 \\frac{\\text{consultation}}{\\text{person} \\cdot \\text{month}} = 10000 \\frac{\\text{consultations}}{\\text{month}}$$\n\nThe total demand for provider time per month, $T_{\\text{demand, month}}$, is the total number of consultations multiplied by the time required for each consultation:\n$$T_{\\text{demand, month}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times T_{\\text{consult}} = 10000 \\frac{\\text{consultations}}{\\text{month}} \\times 10 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{consultation}} = 100000 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{month}}$$\n\nNext, we determine the daily demand. The problem states that the demand is evenly distributed across the $D=30$ operating days of the month. Therefore, the demand for provider time per day, $T_{\\text{demand, day}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\text{demand, day}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{demand, month}}}{D} = \\frac{100000 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{10000}{3} \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the number of clinicians per $8$-hour shift. We assume that the clinic's daily operations are covered by a single shift, meaning the entire daily demand must be met during one $8$-hour period. Thus, the demand per shift, $T_{\\text{demand, shift}}$, is equal to the daily demand:\n$$T_{\\text{demand, shift}} = \\frac{10000}{3} \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{shift}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the capacity, which is the effective time a single FTE clinician can provide during one shift. The scheduled duration of a shift is $L_{\\text{shift}} = 8$ hours. In minutes, this is:\n$$T_{\\text{shift, scheduled}} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{hour}} = 480 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nHowever, the available time is reduced by an absenteeism rate of $r_a = 0.20$. This means that, on average, only a fraction $(1 - r_a)$ of the scheduled time is effectively worked. The effective time provided by one scheduled FTE per shift, $T_{\\text{effective, FTE}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\text{effective, FTE}} = T_{\\text{shift, scheduled}} \\times (1 - r_a) = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\times (1 - 0.20) = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\times 0.80 = 384 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nTo meet the demand, the total effective capacity provided by all clinicians on shift must equal the total demand for that shift. Let $N_{\\text{FTE}}$ be the required number of FTE clinicians to be scheduled per shift. The total capacity is $N_{\\text{FTE}} \\times T_{\\text{effective, FTE}}$. Setting capacity equal to demand:\n$$N_{\\text{FTE}} \\times T_{\\text{effective, FTE}} = T_{\\text{demand, shift}}$$\nWe can now solve for $N_{\\text{FTE}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{FTE}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{demand, shift}}}{T_{\\text{effective, FTE}}} = \\frac{\\frac{10000}{3} \\text{ minutes}}{384 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{10000}{3 \\times 384}$$\n$$N_{\\text{FTE}} = \\frac{10000}{1152}$$\n\nPerforming the final calculation:\n$$N_{\\text{FTE}} \\approx 8.680555...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $8$, $6$, and $8$. The fourth digit is $0$, so we round down.\n$$N_{\\text{FTE}} \\approx 8.68$$\nThus, approximately $8.68$ FTE clinicians must be scheduled per shift to meet the expected demand, accounting for absenteeism.",

This advanced practice  moves beyond simple clinical triage to explore how ethical frameworks can be systematically operationalized.

            "problem": "A sudden escalation of conflict has displaced thousands into a remote valley, creating a complex humanitarian emergency with disrupted infrastructure, insecurity, and scarce medical capacity. A mobile field team must allocate a limited number of daily evacuation slots to medical referrals. To align with impartiality (anonymity) and equity in global health prioritization, the team commits to a fairness-adjusted priority score that depends only on three measurable characteristics of each patient: clinically assessed severity, structural vulnerability, and access barriers.\n\nFoundational base and axioms:\n- Severity, denoted by $s \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, is a monotonically increasing measure of expected near-term health benefit from evacuation (e.g., expected reduction in mortality risk if evacuated).\n- Vulnerability, denoted by $v \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, is an index of structural disadvantage (e.g., exposure, deprivation, exclusion) that should increase the social marginal value of a unit of health benefit. The social value weight has a constant elasticity with respect to $v$, governed by a nonnegative parameter $\\eta$ (inequality aversion). Impartiality requires the same functional relationship for all individuals with the same $v$.\n- Access barrier, denoted by $b \\in [0,\\infty)$, is a measure of impediments to timely access (e.g., travel time in hazardous conditions, checkpoint delays), which reduces the effective feasibility of realizing the benefit. The penalty factor is strictly decreasing in $b$, normalized so that it equals $1$ at $b=0$, and has a first-order sensitivity $-\\lambda$ at $b=0$ for some $\\lambda>0$. Impartiality requires the same functional relationship for all individuals with the same $b$.\n- Independence (separability): conditional on $(s,v,b)$, other identity-irrelevant features do not affect priority; the effects of $s$, $v$, and $b$ combine without cross-terms. Scale invariance in the clinical scale of $s$ implies that multiplying all $s$ by a positive constant does not change rankings.\n\nTask:\n1) Using only these axioms and well-tested principles from social welfare analysis in health (monotonicity in $s$, constant elasticity of social weights in $v$, and a normalized, locally linear barrier penalty), derive the simplest multiplicative functional form for a fairness-adjusted priority score $F(s,v,b)$ that is strictly increasing in $s$ and $v$, strictly decreasing in $b$, homogeneous of degree $1$ in $s$, has constant elasticity $\\eta$ with respect to $v$, and satisfies $F(s,v,0)=s$ when $\\eta=0$ and the barrier sensitivity at $b=0$ is $-\\lambda$.\n\n2) Consider three patients with the following characteristics:\n- Patient $1$: severity $s_{1}=8$, vulnerability $v_{1}=1.2$, access barrier $b_{1}=0.2$.\n- Patient $2$: severity $s_{2}=6$, vulnerability $v_{2}=1.8$, access barrier $b_{2}=0.6$.\n- Patient $3$: severity $s_{3}=7$, vulnerability $v_{3}=1.4$, access barrier $b_{3}=0.3$.\n\nLet $\\lambda=1$. Under two distributional weight schemes reflecting different ethical stances:\n- Scheme A: $\\eta=0$ (impartiality without distributional emphasis).\n- Scheme B: $\\eta=2$ (strong inequality aversion increasing weights for higher $v$).\n\nCompute the fairness-adjusted priority scores for each patient under Scheme A and Scheme B, and determine the ranking from highest to lowest priority under each scheme.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- No rounding is required.\n- Report your final answer as a single row matrix containing six integers: the three patient indices in descending priority order under Scheme A, followed immediately by the three indices in descending priority order under Scheme B. For example, if Scheme A ranks patients $2,1,3$ and Scheme B ranks $1,3,2$, then the final answer should be $\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in principles of health economics and social welfare theory, mathematically well-posed with a set of consistent and sufficient constraints for deriving a unique functional form, and objective in its language and structure. All provided information is formalizable into a solvable mathematical problem.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Priority Score Function $F(s,v,b)$**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the simplest multiplicative functional form for the priority score $F(s,v,b)$, which depends on severity $s$, vulnerability $v$, and access barrier $b$.\n\n$1$. **Multiplicative Separability**: The axiom of independence (separability) without cross-terms implies that the function $F(s,v,b)$ can be written as a product of functions of each variable:\n$$F(s,v,b) = G_s(s) \\cdot G_v(v) \\cdot G_b(b)$$\n\n$2$. **Severity Component $G_s(s)$**: The score is required to be homogeneous of degree $1$ in $s$. This means $F(cs, v, b) = c F(s, v, b)$ for any constant $c>0$. Applying this to the separable form:\n$$G_s(cs) \\cdot G_v(v) \\cdot G_b(b) = c \\cdot G_s(s) \\cdot G_v(v) \\cdot G_b(b)$$\nThis simplifies to $G_s(cs) = c G_s(s)$, which is the definition of a homogeneous function of degree $1$. The simplest function satisfying this property is a direct proportionality, $G_s(s) = k \\cdot s$ for some constant $k$. Since the final ranking is unaffected by a global scaling constant, we can set $k=1$ without loss of generality. This choice will be confirmed by the normalization condition later. Thus, we set:\n$$G_s(s) = s$$\n\n$3$. **Vulnerability Component $G_v(v)$**: The social value weight is defined to have a constant elasticity with respect to vulnerability $v$, with the elasticity given by the parameter $\\eta \\ge 0$. The elasticity of $F$ with respect to $v$ is given by $E_v(F) = \\frac{v}{F} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v}$. For our separable form, this elasticity is identical to the elasticity of $G_v(v)$:\n$$E_v(F) = \\frac{v}{G_s(s)G_v(v)G_b(b)} \\left( G_s(s)G_v'(v)G_b(b) \\right) = \\frac{v G_v'(v)}{G_v(v)}$$\nWe are given that this elasticity is constant and equal to $\\eta$:\n$$\\frac{v G_v'(v)}{G_v(v)} = \\eta$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation: $\\frac{dG_v}{G_v} = \\eta \\frac{dv}{v}$. Integrating both sides yields $\\ln(G_v) = \\eta \\ln(v) + C_0$, which exponentiates to $G_v(v) = \\exp(C_0) \\cdot v^\\eta = A \\cdot v^\\eta$, where $A$ is an integration constant.\n\n$4$. **Access Barrier Component $G_b(b)$**: The penalty factor $G_b(b)$ must satisfy three conditions:\n(i) It is strictly decreasing in $b$.\n(ii) It is normalized such that $G_b(0) = 1$.\n(iii) It has a first-order sensitivity of $-\\lambda$ at $b=0$, meaning $G_b'(0) = -\\lambda$.\n\nThe requirement for the \"simplest\" functional form that is also consistent with \"well-tested principles\" points towards an exponential decay function, which is common in such models. A linear form like $G_b(b) = 1 - \\lambda b$ would satisfy (ii) and (iii) but would not be strictly decreasing for all $b \\in [0, \\infty)$ and could become negative, which is nonsensical for a multiplicative factor. The simplest well-behaved function is $G_b(b) = \\exp(-\\lambda b)$. Let's verify:\n(i) For $\\lambda > 0$, $G_b(b)$ is strictly decreasing.\n(ii) $G_b(0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n(iii) $G_b'(b) = -\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda b)$, so $G_b'(0) = -\\lambda \\exp(0) = -\\lambda$.\nAll conditions are met.\n\n$5$. **Combining and Normalizing**: Combining the components, the score function is:\n$$F(s,v,b) = s \\cdot (A \\cdot v^\\eta) \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda b)$$\nWe use the final condition to determine the constant $A$: $F(s,v,0) = s$ when $\\eta=0$.\nSubstituting $b=0$ and $\\eta=0$ into our function:\n$$F(s,v,0) = s \\cdot (A \\cdot v^0) \\cdot \\exp(0) = s \\cdot A \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = A s$$\nFor this to equal $s$, we must have $A=1$.\n\nThe derived functional form for the fairness-adjusted priority score is:\n$$F(s,v,b) = s v^{\\eta} \\exp(-\\lambda b)$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation and Ranking**\n\nWe apply this formula to the three patients with the given parameters.\nPatient data:\n- Patient $1$: $s_{1}=8$, $v_{1}=1.2$, $b_{1}=0.2$.\n- Patient $2$: $s_{2}=6$, $v_{2}=1.8$, $b_{2}=0.6$.\n- Patient $3$: $s_{3}=7$, $v_{3}=1.4$, $b_{3}=0.3$.\nParameter $\\lambda=1$.\n\n**Scheme A: Impartiality without distributional emphasis ($\\eta=0$)**\nThe priority score formula simplifies to $F(s,v,b) = s v^{0} \\exp(-b) = s \\exp(-b)$.\n- Patient $1$: $F_{1,A} = 8 \\exp(-1 \\cdot 0.2) = 8 \\exp(-0.2) \\approx 8 \\times 0.8187 = 6.550$\n- Patient $2$: $F_{2,A} = 6 \\exp(-1 \\cdot 0.6) = 6 \\exp(-0.6) \\approx 6 \\times 0.5488 = 3.293$\n- Patient $3$: $F_{3,A} = 7 \\exp(-1 \\cdot 0.3) = 7 \\exp(-0.3) \\approx 7 \\times 0.7408 = 5.186$\n\nComparing the scores: $6.550 > 5.186 > 3.293$, so $F_{1,A} > F_{3,A} > F_{2,A}$.\nThe priority ranking for Scheme A is Patient $1$, Patient $3$, Patient $2$.\n\n**Scheme B: Strong inequality aversion ($\\eta=2$)**\nThe priority score formula is $F(s,v,b) = s v^{2} \\exp(-b)$.\n- Patient $1$: $F_{1,B} = 8 \\cdot (1.2)^{2} \\cdot \\exp(-0.2) = 8 \\cdot 1.44 \\cdot \\exp(-0.2) = 11.52 \\exp(-0.2) \\approx 11.52 \\times 0.8187 = 9.431$\n- Patient $2$: $F_{2,B} = 6 \\cdot (1.8)^{2} \\cdot \\exp(-0.6) = 6 \\cdot 3.24 \\cdot \\exp(-0.6) = 19.44 \\exp(-0.6) \\approx 19.44 \\times 0.5488 = 10.671$\n- Patient $3$: $F_{3,B} = 7 \\cdot (1.4)^{2} \\cdot \\exp(-0.3) = 7 \\cdot 1.96 \\cdot \\exp(-0.3) = 13.72 \\exp(-0.3) \\approx 13.72 \\times 0.7408 = 10.167$\n\nTo formally compare without approximation, we can compare the logarithms of the scores:\n$\\ln(F_{1,B}) = \\ln(11.52) - 0.2 \\approx 2.444 - 0.2 = 2.244$\n$\\ln(F_{2,B}) = \\ln(19.44) - 0.6 \\approx 2.967 - 0.6 = 2.367$\n$\\ln(F_{3,B}) = \\ln(13.72) - 0.3 \\approx 2.619 - 0.3 = 2.319$\nThe comparison $\\ln(F_{2,B}) > \\ln(F_{3,B}) > \\ln(F_{1,B})$ implies $F_{2,B} > F_{3,B} > F_{1,B}$.\nThe priority ranking for Scheme B is Patient $2$, Patient $3$, Patient $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix of the patient indices in descending order of priority.\n- Scheme A ranking: $(1, 3, 2)$\n- Scheme B ranking: $(2, 3, 1)$\nThis combines to form the final matrix.",
