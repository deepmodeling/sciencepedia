The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMRate) is defined as the frequency of maternal deaths per unit of person-time among women of reproductive age, specifically women aged $15$ to $49$ years. The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is defined as the frequency of maternal deaths per number of live births in the same period. Over a one-year interval, the system records $15$ maternal deaths, a total exposure of $1{,}000{,}000$ woman-years contributed by women aged $15$ to $49$, and $500{,}000$ live births.

The definitions provided for Maternal Mortality Rate (MMRate) and Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) are standard and correct within the fields of demography, epidemiology, and public health. The calculation requested is a direct application of these fundamental definitions.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data ($D_m$, $T_p$, $B_L$) and precise definitions to compute the two requested metrics. The scaling factors ($100{,}000$) and rounding instructions are clear, leading to a unique solution.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective or biased language.\n-   **Flaw Assessment:** The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and its data, while representing high fertility, are not physically impossible or contradictory for a hypothetical calculation exercise. The structure is clear, and the task is a standard, non-trivial calculation in its field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by applying the provided definitions and data. Let $D_m$ be the number of maternal deaths, $T_p$ be the total person-time of exposure in woman-years, and $B_L$ be the number of live births.\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $D_m = 15$\n-   $T_p = 1{,}000{,}000$ woman-years\n-   $B_L = 500{,}000$ live births\n\n**1. Calculation of Maternal Mortality Rate (MMRate)**\n\nThe MMRate is defined as the number of maternal deaths per unit of person-time. To express this per $100{,}000$ woman-years, the raw rate is multiplied by $100{,}000$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$\n\\text{MMRate} = \\frac{D_m}{T_p} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{MMRate} = \\frac{15}{1{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\n\nThe calculation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{MMRate} = 15 \\times \\frac{100{,}000}{1{,}000{,}000} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 1.5\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The value $1.5$ is written as $1.50$ to reflect this precision.\nSo, $\\text{MMRate} = 1.50$ per $100{,}000$ woman-years.\n\n**2. Calculation of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**\n\nThe MMR is defined as the number of maternal deaths per number of live births. To express this per $100{,}000$ live births, the raw ratio is multiplied by $100{,}000$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = \\frac{D_m}{B_L} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = \\frac{15}{500{,}000} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\n\nThe calculation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = 15 \\times \\frac{100{,}000}{500{,}000} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 3\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The value $3$ is written as $3.00$ to reflect this precision.\nSo, $\\text{MMR} = 3.00$ per $100{,}000$ live births.\n\n**3. Final Answer Assembly**\n\nThe problem asks for the pair $\\big(\\text{MMRate}, \\text{MMR}\\big)$. Using the computed and correctly rounded values, the pair is $\\big(1.50, 3.00\\big)$.",

Seemingly objective indicators like the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) can vary significantly depending on the precise definitions used for events like a 'live birth'. This practical exercise  demonstrates the importance of data quality and definitional consistency by exploring how reclassifying borderline cases based on WHO standards can impact a national IMR estimate, reinforcing the need for careful data scrutiny.",

            "problem": "A national registry seeks to assess the robustness of its Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) estimates to alternative definitions of live birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a live birth as any complete expulsion or extraction from the mother, irrespective of gestational age, that after such separation shows any evidence of life (breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscles). The registry has historically applied a stricter viability criterion, under which some borderline cases with minimal signs of life were recorded as stillbirths. To test robustness, the registry retrospectively reclassifies these borderline cases as live births according to the WHO definition and updates infant death counts accordingly.\n\nIn a recent year, the registry recorded the following under its strict criterion:\n- Live births: $48{,}200$\n- Deaths of infants before reaching age $1$ year: $2{,}310$\n\nA retrospective clinical audit identified $530$ borderline cases that had at least one sign of life but were recorded as stillbirths under the strict criterion. Subsequent follow-up established that among these $530$ cases:\n- $370$ died within the first day after birth (age $< 24$ hours),\n- $90$ died between day $1$ and month $11$ (age $< 1$ year),\n- $70$ survived beyond age $1$ year.\n\nUnder the WHO live birth definition, treat all $530$ borderline cases as live births, and treat those who died before age $1$ year among them as infant deaths.\n\nCompute the absolute change in the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) that results from adopting the WHO definition instead of the strict criterion. Express your final result in deaths per $1{,}000$ live births and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the absolute change in the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) after reclassifying a set of borderline cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of a live birth. The IMR is defined as the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per $1,000$ live births in a given year. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{IMR} = \\frac{\\text{Number of infant deaths}}{\\text{Number of live births}} \\times 1000 $$\n\nFirst, we establish the values under the initial, strict criterion. Let $N_{LB,S}$ be the number of live births and $N_{ID,S}$ be the number of infant deaths recorded under this criterion.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$N_{LB,S} = 48200$\n$N_{ID,S} = 2310$\n\nThe IMR under the strict criterion, $\\text{IMR}_S$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{IMR}_S = \\frac{N_{ID,S}}{N_{LB,S}} \\times 1000 = \\frac{2310}{48200} \\times 1000 $$\n\nNext, we determine the updated figures under the WHO definition. A retrospective audit reclassifies $530$ borderline cases as live births. Let this number be $N_{BC}$.\n$N_{BC} = 530$\nThese cases must be added to the count of live births. The new total number of live births, $N_{LB,W}$, is:\n$$ N_{LB,W} = N_{LB,S} + N_{BC} = 48200 + 530 = 48730 $$\n\nAmong these $530$ reclassified cases, some resulted in deaths before the age of one year. These must be added to the infant death count. The number of such deaths, $N_{ID,BC}$, is the sum of those who died within the first day and those who died between day $1$ and month $11$:\n$N_{ID,BC} = 370 + 90 = 460$\nThe new total number of infant deaths, $N_{ID,W}$, is:\n$$ N_{ID,W} = N_{ID,S} + N_{ID,BC} = 2310 + 460 = 2770 $$\nNote that the $70$ cases who survived beyond age $1$ year are correctly included in the new live birth count but do not contribute to the new infant death count. The consistency check is $370 + 90 + 70 = 530$.\n\nThe IMR under the WHO definition, $\\text{IMR}_W$, is calculated using the updated totals:\n$$ \\text{IMR}_W = \\frac{N_{ID,W}}{N_{LB,W}} \\times 1000 = \\frac{2770}{48730} \\times 1000 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute change in the IMR, which we denote as $\\Delta\\text{IMR}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\text{IMR} = |\\text{IMR}_W - \\text{IMR}_S| $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each IMR:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{IMR} = \\left| \\left(\\frac{2770}{48730} \\times 1000\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2310}{48200} \\times 1000\\right) \\right| $$\nWe can factor out the $1000$:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{IMR} = 1000 \\times \\left| \\frac{2770}{48730} - \\frac{2310}{48200} \\right| $$\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations:\n$$ \\frac{2310}{48200} \\approx 0.04792531 $$\n$$ \\frac{2770}{48730} \\approx 0.05684383 $$\n$$ \\text{IMR}_S \\approx 47.92531 $$\n$$ \\text{IMR}_W \\approx 56.84383 $$\nThe absolute change is:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{IMR} = |56.84383 - 47.92531| \\approx 8.91852 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $8.91852...$ are $8$, $9$, $1$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit. Therefore, $8.918$ is rounded to $8.919$.\n\nThe absolute change in the Infant Mortality Rate is $8.919$ deaths per $1,000$ live births.",

These are fundamental concepts in public health and biostatistics. The data, while hypothetical, are plausible. The methodology is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary data are provided: age-specific rates for both countries and the distribution of the standard population.

A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is presented using precise, quantitative language, free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing data, unrealistic conditions). It is a standard, formalizable statistics problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe method of direct standardization is used to compare rates between populations with different underlying structures (in this case, age structures of live births). The age-standardized MMR ($\\text{SMMR}$) is a weighted average of the age-specific MMRs ($M_i$), where the weights are derived from the standard population's distribution of live births.\n\nThe formula for the age-standardized MMR is given by:\n$$ \\text{SMMR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (\\text{Expected Deaths}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (\\text{Standard Population}_i)} \\times 100{,}000 $$\nThe expected number of deaths in age group $i$ is calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rate of the country to the number of live births in the standard population for that age group. The age-specific rate, $r_i$, is $M_i / 100{,}000$. Thus, expected deaths in group $i$ is $r_i \\times W_{S,i} = \\frac{M_i}{100{,}000} \\times W_{S,i}$.\nThe total expected deaths is $\\sum_i \\frac{M_i \\times W_{S,i}}{100{,}000}$. The total standard population is $\\sum_i W_{S,i}$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for $\\text{SMMR}$:\n$$ \\text{SMMR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{M_i \\times W_{S,i}}{100{,}000}}{\\sum_{i} W_{S,i}} \\times 100{,}000 $$\nThis simplifies to a weighted mean of the age-specific MMRs:\n$$ \\text{SMMR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (M_i \\times W_{S,i})}{\\sum_{i} W_{S,i}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the total number of live births in the standard population, $W_{S,\\text{total}}$:\n$$ W_{S,\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} W_{S,i} = 120{,}000 + 260{,}000 + 280{,}000 + 200{,}000 + 100{,}000 + 35{,}000 + 5{,}000 $$\n$$ W_{S,\\text{total}} = 1{,}000{,}000 $$\nNext, we calculate the age-standardized MMR for Country A ($\\text{SMMR}_A$).
