            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe fundamental principle of magnetic resonance is that a nuclear spin with a magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ placed in a static magnetic field $\\vec{B_0}$ experiences a torque that causes it to precess about the direction of the field. The angular frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by the Larmor equation. The problem states this relationship as a proportionality between the angular frequency, $\\omega$, and the applied field magnitude, $B_0$.\n\nThe Larmor equation is:\n$$ \\omega = \\gamma B_0 $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant specific to the nucleus. The frequency in hertz, $f$, is related to the angular frequency by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Substituting this into the Larmor equation gives:\n$$ 2\\pi f = \\gamma B_0 $$\nSolving for the resonance frequency $f$ yields:\n$$ f = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\right) B_0 $$\nThis equation explicitly demonstrates the linear dependence of the resonance frequency $f$ on the magnetic field magnitude $B_0$. The constant of proportionality is $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}$, which is often cited as the gyromagnetic ratio in units of $\\mathrm{Hz/T}$.\n\nNext, we compute the proton resonance frequencies at the specified magnetic field strengths using the provided value for the proton's gyromagnetic ratio, $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} = 42.577\\,\\mathrm{MHz/T}$.\n\nFor a field of $B_0 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$:\n$$ f_{1.5\\mathrm{T}} = \\left(42.577\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{MHz}}{\\mathrm{T}}\\right) \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 63.8655\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $$\n\nFor a field of $B_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{T}$:\n$$ f_{3\\mathrm{T}} = \\left(42.577\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{MHz}}{\\mathrm{T}}\\right) \\times (3\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 127.731\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $$\n\nFor a field of $B_0 = 7\\,\\mathrm{T}$:\n$$ f_{7\\mathrm{T}} = \\left(42.577\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{MHz}}{\\mathrm{T}}\\right) \\times (7\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 298.039\\,\\mathrm{MHz} $$\n\nThe chemical shift, $\\delta$, in parts per million ($\\mathrm{ppm}$), is a measure of the change in resonance frequency of a nucleus due to its local chemical environment relative to a reference frequency, $f_{\\text{ref}}$. It is defined as:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{f - f_{\\text{ref}}}{f_{\\text{ref}}} \\times 10^6 $$\nHere, $f_{\\text{ref}}$ is the nominal Larmor frequency of the spectrometer, determined by the main magnetic field $B_0$.\n\nThe spectral separation in hertz, $\\Delta\\nu$, between two resonances at frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ is simply $\\Delta\\nu = f_1 - f_2$. The difference in their chemical shifts, $\\Delta\\delta$, is:\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = \\delta_1 - \\delta_2 = \\left(\\frac{f_1 - f_{\\text{ref}}}{f_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10^6 - \\left(\\frac{f_2 - f_{\\text{ref}}}{f_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10^6 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = \\frac{f_1 - f_2}{f_{\\text{ref}}} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{f_{\\text{ref}}} \\times 10^6 $$\nTo derive an expression for the spectral separation $\\Delta\\nu$ in hertz, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\Delta\\delta \\times f_{\\text{ref}} \\times 10^{-6} $$\nSince $f_{\\text{ref}}$ is the Larmor frequency at the field $B_0$, we can substitute $f_{\\text{ref}} = (\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}) B_0$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\Delta\\delta \\times \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 \\right) \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThis shows that for a fixed chemical shift difference $\\Delta\\delta$ (in $\\mathrm{ppm}$), the frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength $B_0$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this separation for a chemical shift difference of $\\Delta\\delta = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ at a magnetic field of $B_0 = 7\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\nThe reference frequency at $7\\,\\mathrm{T}$ is $f_{\\text{ref}} = f_{7\\mathrm{T}} = 298.039\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 298.039 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nUsing the formula for $\\Delta\\nu$:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) \\times (298.039\\,\\mathrm{MHz}) \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThe 'ppm' unit implicitly includes the $10^{-6}$ factor, so we can write:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = 3.0 \\times (298.039 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = 3.0 \\times 298.039\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = 894.117\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta\\nu \\approx 894.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$",

This finite observation window fundamentally limits the achievable frequency resolution of the resulting spectrum. We can model this process by considering the observed signal, $s_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$, as the product of an ideal, infinitely long signal, $s_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(t)$, and a rectangular window function, $w(t)$.\n\nThe ideal signal is a single-frequency component at $f_0$, represented as $s_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(t) = A \\exp(i 2\\pi f_0 t)$.

The derivation will be based on the fundamental principles of slice selection and chemical shift in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS), as provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the slice thickness $t$, the slice-selection gradient $G_s$, and the radiofrequency (RF) excitation bandwidth $\\mathrm{BW}_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. The slice-selection gradient imposes a linear relationship between the Larmor frequency and the spatial position along the gradient direction, which is the $z$-axis in this case.
