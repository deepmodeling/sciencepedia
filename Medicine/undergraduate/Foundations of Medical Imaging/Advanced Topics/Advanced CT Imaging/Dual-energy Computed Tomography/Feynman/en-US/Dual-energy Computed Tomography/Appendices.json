            "problem": "A fundamental approach in Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (CT) for K-edge contrast agent imaging is to form a material-selective image by linearly combining two log-transformed measurements acquired at distinct effective photon energies on either side of the K-edge of the agent. Consider a protocol designed for iodine (K-edge at approximately $33.2$ $\\mathrm{keV}$) using two quasi-monoenergetic effective beams at $E_{L} = 32$ $\\mathrm{keV}$ and $E_{H} = 36$ $\\mathrm{keV}$. For a single ray through a uniform medium, let the detected photon counts be $N_{E}$ and the incident counts be $N_{E}^{0}$, where $E \\in \\{L,H\\}$. Assume an ideal detector, negligible scatter, and that each beam is sufficiently narrowband to be modeled as monochromatic for the purposes of attenuation.\n\nYou plan to construct a water-suppressed iodine image by forming a linear combination of line integrals\n$$\nc = d_{H} - w\\, d_{L},\n$$\nwhere $d_{E}$ denotes the line integral of the linear attenuation coefficient along the ray at energy $E$, and $w$ is a scalar weight chosen so that the contribution of water is canceled for any water thickness along the ray. As a calibration step, you measure transmissions through a $t_{w} = 10$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ thick water phantom, obtaining the following mean detected counts and incident counts:\n- $N_{L}^{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$, $N_{L}^{w} = 1.2 \\times 10^{5}$ at $E_{L} = 32$ $\\mathrm{keV}$;\n- $N_{H}^{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$, $N_{H}^{w} = 2.4 \\times 10^{5}$ at $E_{H} = 36$ $\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nStarting from the Beer–Lambert law and the definition of $d_{E}$, derive the expression for $w$ that ensures $c=0$ for a ray passing through water only, evaluate $w$ using the given measurements, and report its value. Express your final result as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a weighting factor $w$ used in a dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) water-suppression algorithm. The derivation begins with the Beer–Lambert law, which describes the attenuation of monochromatic radiation as it passes through a material.\n\nAccording to the Beer–Lambert law, the relationship between the incident photon counts $N_{E}^{0}$ and the detected photon counts $N_{E}$ after passing through a material is given by:\n$$\nN_{E} = N_{E}^{0} \\exp(-d_{E})\n$$\nwhere $E$ represents the photon energy (either $E_L$ for low energy or $E_H$ for high energy), and $d_{E}$ is the line integral of the linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu(\\vec{r}, E)$ along the ray path.\n\nTo proceed, we must first express the line integral $d_{E}$ in terms of the measurable photon counts. By rearranging the Beer–Lambert law, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{E}}{N_{E}^{0}} = \\exp(-d_{E})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{E}}{N_{E}^{0}}\\right) = -d_{E}\n$$\nTherefore, the line integral $d_{E}$ can be calculated from the measurements as:\n$$\nd_{E} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{E}}{N_{E}^{0}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{E}^{0}}{N_{E}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines a water-suppressed iodine image signal, $c$, as a linear combination of the line integrals from the high-energy ($d_H$) and low-energy ($d_L$) scans:\n$$\nc = d_{H} - w\\, d_{L}\n$$\nThe weight $w$ is chosen such that the contribution from water is canceled. This means that for a ray passing exclusively through water, the signal $c$ must be equal to zero. Let $d_{H}^{w}$ and $d_{L}^{w}$ be the line integrals for a ray passing through the water phantom. The condition for water cancellation is:\n$$\nc_{\\text{water}} = d_{H}^{w} - w\\, d_{L}^{w} = 0\n$$\nFrom this condition, we can derive the expression for the weight $w$:\n$$\nd_{H}^{w} = w\\, d_{L}^{w}\n$$\n$$\nw = \\frac{d_{H}^{w}}{d_{L}^{w}}\n$$\nThis shows that $w$ is the ratio of the line integrals of water at the two energies.
