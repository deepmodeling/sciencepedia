All provided parameters ($w = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $f_{0} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, $c = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$) are physically realistic for medical ultrasound. The problem is based on fundamental principles of diffraction theory and Fourier acoustics. It is complete, internally consistent, and free of ambiguity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts: first, the derivation of the analytical expression for the element factor; second, the numerical evaluation for the given parameters; and third, a discussion of its physical implications.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  The problem is one-dimensional. The transducer element is assumed to be of infinite extent in the elevation (out-of-plane) direction, so diffraction is only considered in the lateral (azimuthal) plane.\n2.  The analysis is performed under Fraunhofer (far-field) conditions. This presumes the observation points are at a distance $R$ from the aperture such that $R \\gg \\frac{w^2}{\\lambda}$, where $w$ is the aperture width and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n3.  The propagation medium (tissue) is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and lossless.\n4.  The vibrating element surface has a uniform velocity distribution, acting as a rectangular piston source.\n5.  The analysis is performed for a continuous wave at a single frequency $f_0$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Element Factor Expression**\n\nThe problem states that the far-field angular pressure spectrum is proportional to the spatial Fourier transform of the aperture velocity distribution. We begin by defining the aperture function, $A(x)$, for a uniformly excited rectangular element of width $w$ centered at the origin ($x=0$).\n$$\nA(x) = v_0 \\cdot \\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{w}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $v_0$ is the constant velocity amplitude and $\\text{rect}(u)$ is 1 for $|u| \\le 1/2$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe far-field pressure amplitude pattern, $P(\\theta)$, as a function of the observation angle $\\theta$ is proportional to the Fourier transform of $A(x)$ evaluated at the spatial frequency $f_x = \\sin(\\theta)/\\lambda$.\n$$\nP(\\theta) \\propto \\mathcal{F}\\{A(x)\\}(f_x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(x) e^{-j 2\\pi f_x x} dx\n$$\nUsing the standard Fourier transform pair $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\text{rect}(x/w)\\} = w \\cdot \\text{sinc}(w f_x)$, where the normalized sinc function is defined as $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{A(x)\\}(f_x) = v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}(w f_x)\n$$\nSubstituting $f_x = \\sin(\\theta)/\\lambda$ and $\\lambda = c/f_0$:\n$$\nP(\\theta) \\propto v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{w \\sin(\\theta)}{\\lambda}\\right) = v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{w f_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right)\n$$\nThe element factor, $EF(\\theta)$, is the magnitude of this pressure pattern, normalized to its maximum value, which occurs at broadside ($\\theta=0$). At $\\theta=0$, the argument of the sinc function is 0. Since $\\text{sinc}(0)=1$, the maximum value is proportional to $v_0 w$.\nNormalizing by this maximum value gives the element factor magnitude:\n$$\nEF(\\theta) = \\left| \\frac{v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{w f_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right)}{v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}(0)} \\right| = \\left| \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{w f_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the element factor magnitude.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $EF(\\theta)$ for the following parameters:\n- Angle: $\\theta = 30^\\circ$\n- Element width: $w = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Center frequency: $f_0 = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 7.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- Speed of sound: $c = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the argument of the sinc function, let's call it $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{w f_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\n$$\nWe use $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$. All other values are substituted in base SI units.\n$$\nu = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (7.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) (0.5)}{1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{750}{1540} = \\frac{75}{154}\n$$\nNumerically, $u \\approx 0.487013$ (dimensionless).\n\nNow, we evaluate the element factor magnitude, which is $|\\text{sinc}(u)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}\\right|$:\n$$\nEF(30^\\circ) = \\left| \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{75}{154}\\right) \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\pi \\cdot \\frac{75}{154}\\right)}{\\pi \\cdot \\frac{75}{154}} \\right|\n$$\nThe argument of the sine function is $\\pi u \\approx 3.14159 \\times 0.487013 \\approx 1.529995\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n$$\nEF(30^\\circ) \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\sin(1.529995)}{1.529995} \\right| \\approx \\left| \\frac{0.999238}{1.529995} \\right| \\approx 0.65310\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the element factor magnitude is $0.653$.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of Impact on Sensitivity**\n\nThe element factor, $EF(\\theta)$, represents the intrinsic directional sensitivity of a single element of the array. The overall beam pattern of a complete array is the product of the element factor and the array factor (which arises from the geometric arrangement and electronic phasing of all elements). The element factor thus acts as a modulating envelope on the array factor.\n\nOur calculation shows that at an angle of $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the element factor magnitude is $EF(30^\\circ) \\approx 0.653$. This has direct consequences for the array's off-axis sensitivity:\n\n- **Amplitude Consideration:** The pressure amplitude of a wave transmitted or received at a $30^\\circ$ angle is weighted by this factor. This means the pressure amplitude of any signal, whether transmitted or received, at this angle is attenuated to approximately $65.3\\%$ of the maximum amplitude observed at broadside ($\\theta=0^\\circ$). This directly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio for targets located at this angle.\n\n- **Intensity Consideration:** Acoustic intensity is proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude ($I \\propto p^2$). Therefore, the intensity of the signal at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is reduced by a factor of $(EF(30^\\circ))^2$.\n$$\n\\text{Intensity Reduction Factor} = (0.653)^2 \\approx 0.426\n$$\nThis means that the acoustic power transmitted toward, or received from, the $30^\\circ$ direction is only about $42.6\\%$ of the power at broadside. In decibels, this corresponds to an intensity drop of $10 \\log_{10}(0.426) \\approx -3.7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the element factor imposes a fundamental limitation on the useful field of view of a linear array. As the beam is steered further off-axis, the signal strength drops significantly due to this single-element diffraction effect, degrading image quality and limiting the effective steering range, independent of other effects like grating lobes.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the condition for avoiding first-order grating lobes and a subsequent calculation of the maximum steering angle.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Grating Lobe Equation**\n\nWe begin from first principles. Consider a linear array of transducer elements (rows) in the elevational direction. Let the center-to-center distance, or pitch, between adjacent rows be $p_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n\nTo steer the ultrasound beam to an angle $\\theta_{0}$ relative to the array normal (broadside), a time delay is applied to the signals for each successive row. For constructive interference in the far field at angle $\\theta_{0}$, the wavefronts from all rows must be in phase. The path difference for a wave traveling from an adjacent row to a distant point at angle $\\theta_{0}$ is $p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta_{0})$. To compensate for this path difference, an electronic time delay $\\Delta t$ is introduced, which corresponds to a phase shift $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{steer}}$. This steering phase shift must exactly cancel the phase shift caused by the path length difference along the direction $\\theta_{0}$. The phase shift due to the path difference is $k p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta_{0})$, where $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{0}$ is the wavenumber and $\\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of the ultrasound.\nTherefore, the applied steering phase shift between adjacent rows is $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{steer}} = k p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta_{0})$.\n\nNow, consider the total phase difference, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{total}}$, between waves from two adjacent rows arriving at a far-field point at a general angle $\\theta$. This total phase difference is the sum of the phase shift due to the path difference for angle $\\theta$ and the applied electronic steering phase shift (with a negative sign, as it is a delay).\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{total}}(\\theta) = k p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta) - \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{steer}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{steer}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{total}}(\\theta) = k p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta) - k p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sin(\\theta_{0}) = \\frac{2\\pi p_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\lambda_{0}} (\\sin(\\theta) - \\sin(\\theta_{0})) $$\nConstructive interference, which results in the main lobe and grating lobes of the array factor, occurs when this total phase difference is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. Let $m$ be an integer ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$).\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{total}}(\\theta_{m}) = 2\\pi m $$\nwhere $\\theta_{m}$ are the angles of the interference maxima.\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi p_{\\mathrm{e}}}{\\lambda_{0}} (\\sin(\\theta_{m}) - \\sin(\\theta_{0})) = 2\\pi m $$\nDividing by $2\\pi$ and rearranging gives the grating lobe equation:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{m}) = \\sin(\\theta_{0}) + m \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} $$\nThe main lobe corresponds to $m=0$, for which $\\sin(\\theta_{0}) = \\sin(\\theta_{0})$. The first-order grating lobes correspond to $m = \\pm 1$.\n\n**2. Condition to Avoid Visible Grating Lobes**\n\nA lobe is in the \"visible region\" if its angle $\\theta_{m}$ is real, which corresponds to $|\\sin(\\theta_{m})| \\leq 1$. To guarantee that no first-order grating lobe falls into the visible region, we must ensure that $|\\sin(\\theta_{\\pm 1})|  1$.\n\nThis gives two conditions:\n1.  For $m=1$: $|\\sin(\\theta_{0}) + \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}|  1$\n2.  For $m=-1$: $|\\sin(\\theta_{0}) - \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}|  1$\n\nLet's analyze these conditions for a steering angle magnitude $|\\theta_{0}|$.\nWhen steering to a positive angle, $\\theta_{0}  0$, $\\sin(\\theta_{0})$ is positive. The $m=-1$ lobe at $\\sin(\\theta_{-1}) = \\sin(\\theta_{0}) - \\lambda_{0}/p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ moves closer to the visible region. To prevent it from entering, we require its location to be less than $-1$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{0}) - \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}  -1 \\implies \\sin(\\theta_{0}) + 1  \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} $$\nWhen steering to a negative angle, $\\theta_{0}  0$, $\\sin(\\theta_{0})$ is negative. The $m=1$ lobe at $\\sin(\\theta_{+1}) = \\sin(\\theta_{0}) + \\lambda_{0}/p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ moves closer to the visible region. To prevent it from entering, we require its location to be greater than $+1$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{0}) + \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}  1 \\implies \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}  1 - \\sin(\\theta_{0}) $$\nSince $\\sin(\\theta_{0}) = -|\\sin(\\theta_{0})|$ for $\\theta_{0}  0$, this becomes $\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}  1 + |\\sin(\\theta_{0})|$.\nIn terms of the steering angle magnitude $|\\theta_{0}|$, both cases lead to the same, most restrictive condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}  1 + \\sin(|\\theta_{0}|) $$\nThis is the derived condition that guarantees no first-order elevational grating lobe falls into the visible region for a steering magnitude of $|\\theta_{0}|$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Largest Steering Magnitude**\n\nWe first calculate the necessary physical parameters.\nThe wavelength $\\lambda_{0}$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_{0} = \\frac{c}{f_{0}} = \\frac{1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 6.16 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.616\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe elevational pitch $p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is determined from the total aperture width $W_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and the number of rows $N_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The width $W_{\\mathrm{e}}$ spans $N_{\\mathrm{e}}-1$ intervals.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{e}}}{N_{\\mathrm{e}} - 1} = \\frac{2.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{5 - 1} = \\frac{2.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{4} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe ratio $\\lambda_{0}/p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} = \\frac{0.616\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.55\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 1.12 $$\nThe largest steering magnitude, let's call it $\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is found at the boundary of our derived condition:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} - 1 $$\nPlugging in the calculated value for the ratio:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}) = 1.12 - 1 = 0.12 $$\nThe largest steering magnitude is therefore:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\arcsin(0.12) $$\nTo express this in degrees, we convert from radians:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\arcsin(0.12) \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} \\approx 6.8906^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the largest steering magnitude is $6.89^{\\circ}$.",

The solution requires first deriving a general expression for the beamwidth of a focused, uniformly illuminated aperture, and then applying this expression to the specific parameters of the problem.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship for the $-6\\,\\text{dB}$ beamwidth in the focal plane. The problem states that the field in the focal (Fraunhofer) region is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture function. Let us consider a one-dimensional, uniformly illuminated rectangular aperture of width $W$, centered at the origin.

The focal length is the same for both: $F = f_e = 60\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n1.  **Elevational Beamwidth ($BW_e$)**:\n    The elevational aperture width is the element height, $W_e = h = 14\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    The elevational focal length is $F_e = 60\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    Using the derived formula:\n    $$BW_e = \\kappa \\frac{\\lambda F_e}{W_e} \\approx 1.20671 \\times \\frac{(0.308\\,\\text{mm})(60\\,\\text{mm})}{14\\,\\text{mm}} = 1.20671 \\times \\frac{18.48}{14}\\,\\text{mm} = 1.20671 \\times 1.32\\,\\text{mm} \\approx 1.59286\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\n2.  **Azimuthal Beamwidth ($BW_a$)**:\n    The azimuthal aperture consists of $N = 64$ elements with pitch $p = 0.30\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    The azimuthal aperture width is $W_a = N \\times p = 64 \\times 0.30\\,\\text{mm} = 19.2\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    The azimuthal focal length is $F_a = 60\\,\\text{mm}$.\n    Using the derived formula:\n    $$BW_a = \\kappa \\frac{\\lambda F_a}{W_a} \\approx 1.20671 \\times \\frac{(0.308\\,\\text{mm})(60\\,\\text{mm})}{19.2\\,\\text{mm}} = 1.20671 \\times \\frac{18.48}{19.2}\\,\\text{mm} = 1.20671 \\times 0.9625\\,\\text{mm} \\approx 1.16147\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$ of the elevational to azimuthal beamwidths:\n$$R = \\frac{BW_e}{BW_a} = \\frac{\\kappa \\frac{\\lambda F_e}{W_e}}{\\kappa \\frac{\\lambda F_a}{W_a}}$$\nSince the focal lengths are equal ($F_e = F_a$), the terms $\\kappa$, $\\lambda$, and $F$ cancel out, simplifying the ratio to the inverse ratio of the aperture widths:\n$$R = \\frac{W_a}{W_e} = \\frac{19.2\\,\\text{mm}}{14\\,\\text{mm}} = \\frac{19.2}{14} = \\frac{48}{35} \\approx 1.37142857...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 1.37$$\nThis result indicates that the beam is narrower in the azimuthal dimension than in the elevational dimension at the focus, which is expected since the azimuthal aperture ($19.2\\,\\text{mm}$) is wider than the elevational aperture ($14\\,\\text{mm}$).",
