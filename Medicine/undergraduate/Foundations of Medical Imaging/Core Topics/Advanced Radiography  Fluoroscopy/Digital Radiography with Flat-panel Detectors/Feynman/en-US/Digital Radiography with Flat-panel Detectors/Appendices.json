While quantum noise from the X-ray photons themselves is an unavoidable aspect of the imaging process, electronic noise is a property of the readout system. This exercise explores the crucial interplay between these two noise sources by calculating the \"knee\" exposure—the point at which quantum noise variance equals electronic noise variance . Understanding this threshold is essential for characterizing the lower limit of a detector's useful dynamic range and its suitability for low-dose imaging applications.",
