            "introduction": "In medical imaging, radiation dose is not merely a risk to be minimized, but a necessary ingredient for forming a clear image. The relationship between dose and image quality is governed by quantum statistics, where a higher number of X-ray photons generally leads to a less \"noisy\" image. This practice problem delves into this crucial trade-off by calculating the improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when dose is increased, illustrating the core principle that SNR is proportional to the square root of the number of detected photons under quantum-limited conditions .",

            "problem": "A pulsed fluoroscopy system using an indirect flat-panel detector is operated under two exposure settings for a constant patient-equivalent phantom. The detector entrance exposure per pulse is increased from $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{Gy}$ to $4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{Gy}$ by adjusting the tube current, while maintaining constant beam quality (tube potential and filtration), source-to-image distance, and field of view. Assume the following conditions hold over this range: (i) the number of detected X-ray quanta per pulse at the detector follows Poisson statistics, (ii) the detector response is linear in the number of detected quanta, and (iii) electronic and anatomical noise are negligible compared to quantum noise, so the system is quantum-limited. Using only the definition of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as the ratio of mean signal to the standard deviation of noise, properties of Poisson statistics, and linearity of detection, determine the factor by which the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improves when increasing the detector entrance exposure from $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{Gy}$ to $4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{Gy}$. Express your answer as a dimensionless factor and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to find the factor by which the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improves when the detector entrance exposure is increased from $E_1$ to $E_2$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of X-ray quanta detected by the flat-panel detector per pulse. The problem states that the beam quality, source-to-image distance, and field of view are constant. Under these conditions, the detector entrance exposure, $E$, is directly proportional to the mean number of detected quanta, $\\bar{N}$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$ \\bar{N} = c \\cdot E $$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the X-ray spectrum, detector area, and detector quantum efficiency, all of which are constant in this problem.\n\nAccording to assumption (i), $N$ follows Poisson statistics. A key property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. Therefore, the standard deviation of the number of detected quanta, $\\sigma_N$, is the square root of the mean:\n$$ \\sigma_N = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}} $$\n\nLet $S$ be the signal output from the detector. According to assumption (ii), the detector response is linear, so we can write:\n$$ S = g \\cdot N $$\nwhere $g$ is the detector gain, a constant that converts the number of detected quanta into a signal value (e.g., an analog-to-digital unit, or ADU).\n\nThe mean signal, $\\bar{S}$, is the \"Signal\" component of the SNR. It is given by:\n$$ \\bar{S} = E[S] = E[gN] = gE[N] = g\\bar{N} $$\nwhere $E[...]$ denotes the expectation operator.\n\nAccording to assumption (iii), the system is quantum-limited. This means the total noise is dominated by the quantum noise, which arises from the statistical fluctuations in $N$. The \"Noise\" component of the SNR is the standard deviation of the signal, $\\sigma_S$:\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = \\text{Var}(S) = \\text{Var}(gN) = g^2 \\text{Var}(N) = g^2 \\sigma_N^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_S = \\sqrt{g^2 \\sigma_N^2} = g \\sigma_N $$\nwhere $\\text{Var}(...)$ denotes the variance operator.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the SNR using its definition:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{mean signal}}{\\text{standard deviation of noise}} = \\frac{\\bar{S}}{\\sigma_S} $$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\bar{S}$ and $\\sigma_S$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{g\\bar{N}}{g\\sigma_N} = \\frac{\\bar{N}}{\\sigma_N} $$\nUsing the Poisson statistics property $\\sigma_N = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}}$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{N}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{N}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}} $$\nThis fundamental result shows that for a quantum-limited imaging system, the SNR is equal to the square root of the mean number of detected quanta.\n\nTo find how SNR relates to exposure $E$, we substitute $\\bar{N} = cE$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\sqrt{cE} $$\nThis shows that the SNR is proportional to the square root of the detector entrance exposure: $\\text{SNR} \\propto \\sqrt{E}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the improvement factor by taking the ratio of the SNR at exposure $E_2$ to the SNR at exposure $E_1$.
