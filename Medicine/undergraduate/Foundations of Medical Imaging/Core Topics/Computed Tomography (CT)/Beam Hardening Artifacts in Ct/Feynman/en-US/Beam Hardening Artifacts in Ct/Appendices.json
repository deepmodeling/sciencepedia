This exercise delves into the foundational reason for beam hardening: the energy-dependence of X-ray attenuation.

Let the energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficient of a homogeneous material be $\\mu(E)$, with $E$ the photon energy. A reconstructed voxel is assigned a value in Hounsfield Units (HU), defined relative to water as $HU = 1000\\,(\\mu - \\mu_w)/\\mu_w$, where $\\mu_w$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of water at the same effective energy.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of X-ray physics and computed tomography, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of Hounsfield Units (HU) at different energies, the average rate of change of HU for bone, and an interpretation of this result in the context of beam hardening artifacts.\n\nThe Hounsfield Unit scale is defined as:\n$$ HU = 1000 \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_w}{\\mu_w} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material of interest and $\\mu_w$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of water. It is crucial to recognize that this definition is inherently energy-dependent, as both $\\mu$ and $\\mu_w$ are functions of the photon energy $E$. Therefore, a more precise definition is:\n$$ HU(E) = 1000 \\frac{\\mu(E) - \\mu_w(E)}{\\mu_w(E)} $$\n\n**Task 1: Compute $HU_w(E)$ and $HU_b(E)$ at $E \\in \\{50, 60, 80\\}\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.**\n\nFirst, for water, the material itself is the reference. Thus, we set $\\mu(E) = \\mu_w(E)$ in the HU definition.\n$$ HU_w(E) = 1000 \\frac{\\mu_w(E) - \\mu_w(E)}{\\mu_w(E)} = 1000 \\frac{0}{\\mu_w(E)} = 0 $$\nBy definition, the HU value for water is always $0$, regardless of the energy. Therefore, $HU_w(50) = 0$, $HU_w(60) = 0$, and $HU_w(80) = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the HU values for cortical bone, $HU_b(E)$, using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- At $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$: $\\mu_w(50) = 0.229\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\mu_b(50) = 0.70\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- At $E = 60\\,\\mathrm{keV}$: $\\mu_w(60) = 0.206\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\mu_b(60) = 0.52\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- At $E = 80\\,\\mathrm{keV}$: $\\mu_w(80) = 0.172\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\mu_b(80) = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nAt $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$:\n$$ HU_b(50) = 1000 \\frac{\\mu_b(50) - \\mu_w(50)}{\\mu_w(50)} = 1000 \\frac{0.70 - 0.229}{0.229} = 1000 \\frac{0.471}{0.229} \\approx 2056.77 $$\n\nAt $E = 60\\,\\mathrm{keV}$:\n$$ HU_b(60) = 1000 \\frac{\\mu_b(60) - \\mu_w(60)}{\\mu_w(60)} = 1000 \\frac{0.52 - 0.206}{0.206} = 1000 \\frac{0.314}{0.206} \\approx 1524.27 $$\n\nAt $E = 80\\,\\mathrm{keV}$:\n$$ HU_b(80) = 1000 \\frac{\\mu_b(80) - \\mu_w(80)}{\\mu_w(80)} = 1000 \\frac{0.36 - 0.172}{0.172} = 1000 \\frac{0.188}{0.172} \\approx 1093.02 $$\nAs expected, the calculated HU value for bone decreases as the effective energy of the X-ray beam increases.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the average rate of change of the HU of cortical bone.**\n\nThe average rate of change of $HU_b$ with respect to energy $E$ over the interval $[50\\,\\mathrm{keV}, 80\\,\\mathrm{keV}]$ is given by the finite difference formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta HU_b}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{HU_b(80) - HU_b(50)}{80\\,\\mathrm{keV} - 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}} $$\nUsing the values calculated in Task 1:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta HU_b}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{1093.023... - 2056.768...}{30\\,\\mathrm{keV}} = \\frac{-963.745...}{30\\,\\mathrm{keV}} \\approx -32.1248\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{HU}}{\\mathrm{keV}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the average rate of change is $-32.12\\,\\mathrm{HU}/\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\n**Task 3: Discuss the clinical implications.**\n\nThe negative sign of the calculated rate, $\\frac{\\Delta HU_b}{\\Delta E} < 0$, is the critical finding. It quantitatively demonstrates that as the energy ($E$) of the X-ray photons increases, the measured Hounsfield Unit value ($HU_b$) for cortical bone decreases.\n\nThis phenomenon is the direct cause of **beam hardening artifacts** in CT. A CT scanner emits a polychromatic (multi-energy) X-ray beam. According to the Beer-Lambert law, lower-energy photons are attenuated more readily than higher-energy photons. As the beam traverses tissue, especially dense tissue like bone, it is \"hardened\"—its average energy increases.\n\nThe clinical implications are as follows:\n1.  **Cupping Artifact:** In an image of a uniform object, like a cylindrical phantom, the X-ray beam travels a longer path through the center than the periphery. The beam is therefore more hardened at the center. This increase in effective energy causes the reconstructed HU values at the center to be erroneously lower than at the edges, creating a \"cupped\" or dish-shaped HU profile.\n2.  **Streak Artifacts:** When the beam passes between two high-density objects (e.g., the petrous bones in the head), the beam path is subject to extreme hardening. The reconstruction algorithm, which typically assumes a monoenergetic beam, misinterprets the resulting lower signal as being caused by less dense material. This manifests as dark streaks or bands of artificially low HU values between the dense objects.\n\nThe large magnitude of the rate (approximately $-32$ HU per keV) indicates that bone HU values are highly sensitive to changes in the beam's effective energy. A modest shift of a few keV in the spectrum's mean energy, which is common during transit through the body, can cause the HU value of bone to change by over $100$ HU, a significant measurement error that leads to pronounced artifacts and potential diagnostic inaccuracies. This energy dependence is a fundamental challenge in quantitative CT and is mitigated by various techniques, including filtration, software corrections, and dual-energy CT.",

It provides a clear, self-contained, and scientifically sound basis for analyzing the beam hardening artifact. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core physical principle is **beam hardening**. A polychromatic X-ray beam is composed of photons with a range of energies. As the beam passes through matter, lower-energy photons are attenuated more readily than higher-energy photons (since, for the energies in question, the linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu(E)$ is a decreasing function of energy $E$). Consequently, the transmitted beam has a higher average energy than the incident beam—it has been \"hardened\".\n\nThe degree of hardening depends on the path length and the attenuating properties of the material traversed. Paths through more highly attenuating materials (like bone) or longer paths will result in a more hardened beam.\n\nWe can quantify the degree of hardening by calculating the effective energy, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, of the transmitted beam for each of the three defined rays. A physically meaningful definition of effective energy is the mean energy of the photons in the transmitted spectrum. The intensity of photons with energy $E_i$ after traversing the path is $I_i = p_i \\exp(-\\int \\mu(E_i) dl)$. The effective energy is then:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_i E_i I_i}{\\sum_i I_i} = \\frac{E_1 p_1 \\exp(-L_1) + E_2 p_2 \\exp(-L_2)}{p_1 \\exp(-L_1) + p_2 \\exp(-L_2)}\n$$\nwhere $L_i = \\sum_m \\mu_m(E_i) L_m$ is the total line integral of attenuation at energy $E_i$.\n\nThe initial (unattenuated) intensity is $I_0 = p_1 + p_2 = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0$.\n\n**1. Calculation of Effective Energies**\n\nLet's calculate the line integrals and effective energies for each ray.\n-   $\\mu_{b1} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\mu_{b2} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $\\mu_{w1} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\mu_{w2} = 0.17\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $t_b = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $g = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\n**Central Ray:** Path through $2t_b = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of bone and $g = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of water.\n-   Line integral at $E_1$: $\\Lambda_1^{\\mathrm{cen}} = \\mu_{b1}(2t_b) + \\mu_{w1}(g) = (0.50)(4) + (0.20)(2) = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4$.\n-   Line integral at $E_2$: $\\Lambda_2^{\\mathrm{cen}} = \\mu_{b2}(2t_b) + \\mu_{w2}(g) = (0.30)(4) + (0.17)(2) = 1.2 + 0.34 = 1.54$.\n-   Transmitted intensity components: $I_1^{\\mathrm{cen}} = 0.6 e^{-2.4} \\approx 0.0544$, $I_2^{\\mathrm{cen}} = 0.4 e^{-1.54} \\approx 0.0858$.\n-   Total transmitted intensity: $I_{\\mathrm{cen}} = I_1^{\\mathrm{cen}} + I_2^{\\mathrm{cen}} \\approx 0.1402$.\n-   Effective energy: $E_{\\mathrm{eff,central}} = \\frac{(60\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.0544) + (100\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.0858)}{0.1402} \\approx \\frac{3.264 + 8.58}{0.1402} \\approx 84.48\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\n**Peripheral Ray:** Path through $t_b = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of bone.\n-   Line integral at $E_1$: $\\Lambda_1^{\\mathrm{per}} = \\mu_{b1}(t_b) = (0.50)(2) = 1.0$.\n-   Line integral at $E_2$: $\\Lambda_2^{\\mathrm{per}} = \\mu_{b2}(t_b) = (0.30)(2) = 0.6$.\n-   Transmitted intensity components: $I_1^{\\mathrm{per}} = 0.6 e^{-1.0} \\approx 0.2207$, $I_2^{\\mathrm{per}} = 0.4 e^{-0.6} \\approx 0.2195$.\n-   Total transmitted intensity: $I_{\\mathrm{per}} = I_1^{\\mathrm{per}} + I_2^{\\mathrm{per}} \\approx 0.4402$.\n-   Effective energy: $E_{\\mathrm{eff,peripheral}} = \\frac{(60\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.2207) + (100\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.2195)}{0.4402} \\approx \\frac{13.242 + 21.95}{0.4402} \\approx 79.95\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\n**Gap-only Ray:** Path through $g = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of water.\n-   Line integral at $E_1$: $\\Lambda_1^{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\mu_{w1}(g) = (0.20)(2) = 0.4$.\n-   Line integral at $E_2$: $\\Lambda_2^{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\mu_{w2}(g) = (0.17)(2) = 0.34$.\n-   Transmitted intensity components: $I_1^{\\mathrm{gap}} = 0.6 e^{-0.4} \\approx 0.4022$, $I_2^{\\mathrm{gap}} = 0.4 e^{-0.34} \\approx 0.2847$.\n-   Total transmitted intensity: $I_{\\mathrm{gap}} = I_1^{\\mathrm{gap}} + I_2^{\\mathrm{gap}} \\approx 0.6869$.\n-   Effective energy: $E_{\\mathrm{eff,gap}} = \\frac{(60\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.4022) + (100\\,\\mathrm{keV})(0.2847)}{0.6869} \\approx \\frac{24.132 + 28.47}{0.6869} \\approx 76.58\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\n**Ordering of Effective Energies**:\nFrom the calculations, $84.48\\,\\mathrm{keV} > 79.95\\,\\mathrm{keV} > 76.58\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\nThus, the ordering is $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}}$. This confirms that the beam is hardened most by the path through the most bone.\n\n**2. Explanation of the Dark Band Artifact**\n\nA monoenergetic reconstruction algorithm assumes that the measured projection data, $P = -\\ln(I/I_0)$, is linearly proportional to the line integral of attenuation, i.e., $P = \\mu_0 L$. However, for a polychromatic beam, this relationship is non-linear. The measured projection is $P(L) = -\\ln(p_1 e^{-\\mu_1 L} + p_2 e^{-\\mu_2 L})$. Due to the concavity of the logarithm function, $P(L_A + L_B) < P(L_A) + P(L_B)$.\n\nThis means the total attenuation measured for a thick object is less than the sum of the attenuations of its constituent parts measured separately. The central ray passes through the most attenuating path ($2t_b$ bone + $g$ water). Due to significant beam hardening, its measured projection value, $P_{\\mathrm{central}} = -\\ln(I_{\\mathrm{cen}}/I_0) \\approx 1.96$, is less than what a linear model would predict. The monoenergetic reconstruction algorithm interprets this lower-than-expected projection value as if the total amount of material along that ray is less than it actually is. This is what is meant by \"underestimated line integrals\".\n\nDuring reconstruction (e.g., via Filtered Backprojection), this \"attenuation deficit\" from the central ray is distributed or smeared back along the entire ray path. The algorithm attributes high attenuation to the bone slabs. To reconcile the total underestimated line integral, it must assign an artificially low (or even negative) attenuation value to the interspace region. This results in the reconstruction of lower Hounsfield units in the gap between the slabs, which appears as a dark band.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Low-energy photons are preferentially absorbed in bone, so rays crossing more bone are spectrally hardened and have larger effective energy. Because the monoenergetic inversion uses a single $\\mu(E_0)$, the hardened central-ray measurements map to underestimated line integrals; Filtered Backprojection (FBP) spreads this negative bias into the interspace, producing a dark band. The effective energies satisfy $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}}$.**\n\n-   **Explanation**: This accurately describes the physics of beam hardening, its effect on the measured projections (\"underestimated line integrals\"), and the mechanism by which FBP creates the dark band artifact (\"spreads this negative bias\"). This reasoning is sound and aligns with our derivation.\n-   **Energy Ordering**: The stated ordering $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}}$ matches our calculations.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Scatter from the slabs adds a uniform offset to rays near the gap, raising measured intensity and creating a dark band. The effective energies satisfy $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}}$.**\n\n-   **Explanation**: While scatter can cause artifacts, it is not part of the physical model specified by the problem, which is based on the polychromatic Beer-Lambert law for primary photons. The question asks for an explanation from the \"first principles\" provided.\n-   **Energy Ordering**: The stated ordering is incorrect, as established by our calculations.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Exponential attenuation is linear in material thickness, so the sum of two slab attenuations exactly equals that of one slab plus the gap; therefore any band is purely due to edge enhancement in the ramp filter. The effective energies satisfy $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} = E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}} = E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}}$.**\n\n-   **Explanation**: The premise \"Exponential attenuation is linear in material thickness\" is false for a polychromatic beam, which is the entire basis of the problem. This non-linearity is the cause of the artifact, not merely an effect of the ramp filter.\n-   **Energy Ordering**: The claim that all effective energies are equal is false. This would imply no differential beam hardening, which contradicts the physics.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Detector response saturates only for rays through the gap, biasing the reconstruction there. The effective energies satisfy $E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,peripheral}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,central}} > E_{\\mathrm{eff,\\,gap}}$.**\n\n-   **Explanation**: Detector saturation occurs at very high intensities. The ray through the gap is the least attenuated and thus has the highest intensity, so it is the most likely to cause saturation. However, saturation would lead to a reported intensity that is *lower* than the true value, causing an *overestimation* of attenuation and a *bright* artifact, not a dark band. Furthermore, detector saturation is not part of the provided model.\n-   **Energy Ordering**: The stated ordering is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

The phenomenon described, \"cupping\" due to beam hardening, is a well-known artifact in CT.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters, equations, and a key approximation (truncation of the cumulant expansion) to uniquely determine the desired quantity. The given parameters are physically plausible for water attenuation in the diagnostic X-ray energy range.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a rigorous, self-contained physics problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe goal is to compute the Hounsfield Units at the center of the reconstructed image, $\\mathrm{HU}(r=0)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{HU}(0) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\tilde{f}(0) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the reference attenuation, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} = w_{1}\\mu_{1} + w_{2}\\mu_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.022) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.018) = 0.011 + 0.009 = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1} $$\nNext, we must determine the reconstructed attenuation at the center, $\\tilde{f}(0)$. The formula for $\\tilde{f}(r)$ at $r=0$ is:\n$$ \\tilde{f}(0) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p(s)}{\\mathrm{d}s}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{s} $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we need an expression for the projection $p(s)$ and its derivative. The problem states that $p(s)$ can be approximated by truncating its cumulant expansion in powers of the path length $L(s)$ after the quadratic term. The projection is $p(s) = -\\ln(I(s))$ since $I_0 = 1$. The expansion of $p(L)$ around $L=0$ is:\n$$ p(L) \\approx p(0) + p'(0)L + \\frac{1}{2}p''(0)L^2 $$\nWe calculate the coefficients:\n$p(L) = -\\ln(w_1 \\exp(-\\mu_1 L) + w_2 \\exp(-\\mu_2 L))$.\nAt $L=0$, $p(0) = -\\ln(w_1+w_2) = -\\ln(1) = 0$.\nThe first derivative:\n$p'(L) = -\\frac{-w_1\\mu_1 \\exp(-\\mu_1 L) - w_2\\mu_2 \\exp(-\\mu_2 L)}{w_1 \\exp(-\\mu_1 L) + w_2 \\exp(-\\mu_2 L)}$.\nAt $L=0$, $p'(0) = \\frac{w_1\\mu_1 + w_2\\mu_2}{w_1+w_2} = w_1\\mu_1 + w_2\\mu_2 = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\nThis confirms the problem's definition of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ as the small-thickness limit.\n\nThe second derivative $p''(L)$ at $L=0$ is given by $-\\sigma_{\\mu}^2$, where $\\sigma_{\\mu}^2$ is the variance of the attenuation coefficients:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i \\mu_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i \\mu_i\\right)^2 = (w_1\\mu_1^2 + w_2\\mu_2^2) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}^2 $$\nThe truncated expansion for the projection is thus:\n$$ p(L) \\approx \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} L - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 L^2 $$\nSubstituting $L(s) = 2\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}$:\n$$ p(s) \\approx \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} (2\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 (2\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2})^2 $$\n$$ p(s) \\approx 2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2} - 2\\sigma_{\\mu}^2(R^2 - s^2) $$\nNow, we differentiate $p(s)$ with respect to $s$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p(s)}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\approx 2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{-s}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}}\\right) - 2\\sigma_{\\mu}^2(-2s) = -\\frac{2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} s}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}} + 4\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 s $$\nWe substitute this into the expression for $\\tilde{f}(0)$:\n$$ \\tilde{f}(0) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} \\left( -\\frac{2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}} + 4\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe integral is split into two parts:\n$$ \\tilde{f}(0) = \\frac{2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}} - \\frac{4\\sigma_{\\mu}^2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} \\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe first integral is a standard form: $\\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}} = \\arcsin(\\frac{s}{R})$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\sqrt{R^2 - s^2}} = \\left[\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{s}{R}\\right)\\right]_0^R = \\arcsin(1) - \\arcsin(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThe second integral is trivial: $\\int_{0}^{R} \\mathrm{d}s = R$.\nSubstituting these results back:\n$$ \\tilde{f}(0) = \\frac{2\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\frac{4\\sigma_{\\mu}^2}{\\pi}(R) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{4R}{\\pi}\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 $$\nThis expression shows the \"cupping\" artifact: the reconstructed value at the center, $\\tilde{f}(0)$, is lower than the ideal value $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ by a term proportional to the object radius $R$ and the spectral variance $\\sigma_{\\mu}^2$.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\sigma_{\\mu}^2$ with the given values:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(0.022)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.018)^2\\right) - (0.020)^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.000484) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.000324) - 0.000400 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = 0.000242 + 0.000162 - 0.000400 = 0.000404 - 0.000400 = 0.000004 = 4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2} $$\nNow we can find the difference $\\tilde{f}(0) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$:\n$$ \\tilde{f}(0) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} = -\\frac{4R}{\\pi}\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = -\\frac{4(50\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{\\pi}(4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}) = -\\frac{200}{\\pi}(4 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1} = -\\frac{800}{\\pi} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute the HU value at the center:\n$$ \\mathrm{HU}(0) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\tilde{f}(0) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = 1000 \\times \\frac{-\\frac{800}{\\pi} \\times 10^{-6}}{0.020} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{HU}(0) = 1000 \\times \\frac{-\\frac{800}{\\pi} \\times 10^{-6}}{2 \\times 10^{-2}} = 1000 \\times \\left(-\\frac{400}{\\pi} \\times 10^{-4}\\right) = -\\frac{40}{\\pi} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathrm{HU}(0) = -\\frac{40}{\\pi} \\approx -12.732395... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $-12.7$.",
