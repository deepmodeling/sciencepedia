The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Concentration of gadoterate meglumine vial: $C = 0.5$ millimoles per milliliter (mmol/mL).\n- Prescribed dose: $D = 0.1$ millimoles per kilogram (mmol/kg).\n- Patient's body mass: $m = 70$ kilograms (kg).\n- Definition (i): A dose ($D$) in millimoles per kilogram is defined as the total amount of substance administered ($A$) in millimoles divided by the patient’s mass ($m$) in kilograms.\n- Definition (ii): A solution's concentration ($C$) in millimoles per milliliter is defined as the amount of solute ($A$) in millimoles divided by the solution's volume ($V$) in milliliters.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of chemistry (concentration) and pharmacology (dosing), which are standard practices in medicine, particularly in medical imaging fields like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The values provided for dose, concentration, and patient mass are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated, provides all necessary data and definitions, and asks for a specific, calculable quantity (injection volume).

It represents a a standard, formalizable calculation encountered in clinical practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires two parts: first, deriving a general expression for the injection volume, and second, evaluating this expression for the given numerical values.\n\nLet the required injection volume be $V$, expressed in milliliters (mL).\nLet the total amount of the GBCA to be administered be $A$, expressed in millimoles (mmol).\nLet the patient's body mass be $m$, expressed in kilograms (kg).\nLet the prescribed dose be $D$, expressed in millimoles per kilogram (mmol/kg).\nLet the concentration of the GBCA solution be $C$, expressed in millimoles per milliliter (mmol/mL).\n\nFrom the provided definitions, we can write two fundamental equations:\n1.

A paramagnetic GBCA modifies $R_{1}$ by an amount that, in the dilute regime and fast water-exchange conditions, is proportional to its molar concentration $C$, with proportionality constant given by the longitudinal relaxivity $r_{1}$, which is defined as the slope of the $R_{1}$ versus $C$ relation under those conditions.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetic resonance imaging, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to first derive an expression for the Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent (GBCA) concentration $C(t)$ and then compute its numerical value at a specific time point using the provided data.\n\nThe problem states that the total longitudinal relaxation rate, $R_1$, is the sum of independent relaxation pathways. At any time $t$ after the injection of the contrast agent, the measured relaxation rate $R_1(t)$ is the sum of the baseline relaxation rate of the tissue, $R_{1,0}$, and the contribution from the contrast agent, $\\Delta R_1(t)$. This can be written as:\n$$R_1(t) = R_{1,0} + \\Delta R_1(t)$$\nThe problem defines the baseline concentration of the GBCA as zero, so $R_{1,0}$ represents the relaxation rate of the tissue in the absence of the contrast agent.\n\nThe problem also states that the change in the relaxation rate, $\\Delta R_1(t)$, is proportional to the molar concentration of the GBCA, $C(t)$, with the proportionality constant being the longitudinal relaxivity, $r_1$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\\Delta R_1(t) = r_1 C(t)$$\nThis linear relationship is valid in the dilute regime and under fast water-exchange conditions, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nBy substituting the second equation into the first, we obtain an expression relating the total relaxation rate to the concentration:\n$$R_1(t) = R_{1,0} + r_1 C(t)$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $C(t)$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$r_1 C(t) = R_1(t) - R_{1,0}$$\n$$C(t) = \\frac{R_1(t) - R_{1,0}}{r_1}$$\n\nThe problem defines the longitudinal relaxation rate $R_1$ as the reciprocal of the longitudinal relaxation time $T_1$, i.e., $R_1 \\equiv 1/T_1$. We can therefore substitute this definition into the expression for $C(t)$. The relaxation rate at time $t$ is $R_1(t) = 1/T_1(t)$, and the baseline relaxation rate is $R_{1,0} = 1/T_{1,0}$. The expression for the concentration becomes:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_1(t)} - \\frac{1}{T_{1,0}}}{r_1}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the GBCA concentration $C(t)$ as a function of the measured $T_1(t)$, the baseline $T_{1,0}$, and the known relaxivity $r_1$.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of the concentration at $t = 60~\\mathrm{s}$, denoted as $C(60~\\mathrm{s})$, using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- Baseline longitudinal relaxation time: $T_{1,0} = 1200~\\mathrm{ms}$\n- Post-contrast longitudinal relaxation time at $t=60~\\mathrm{s}$: $T_1(60~\\mathrm{s}) = 500~\\mathrm{ms}$\n- GBCA longitudinal relaxivity: $r_1 = 4.5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}$\n\nThe units of relaxivity $r_1$ are given in terms of seconds ($s$), so we must convert the relaxation times from milliseconds ($ms$) to seconds ($s$) to ensure dimensional consistency.\n$1~\\mathrm{s} = 1000~\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$T_{1,0} = 1200~\\mathrm{ms} = 1.2~\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_1(60~\\mathrm{s}) = 500~\\mathrm{ms} = 0.5~\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow we substitute these numerical values into the derived expression for $C(t)$ at $t = 60~\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_1(60~\\mathrm{s})} - \\frac{1}{T_{1,0}}}{r_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{0.5~\\mathrm{s}} - \\frac{1}{1.2~\\mathrm{s}}}{4.5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the relaxation rates in the numerator:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.5~\\mathrm{s}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{1.2~\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{6/5}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{5}{6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.8333...~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for concentration:\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{2.0~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} - \\frac{5}{6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{4.5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}}$$\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{12}{6} - \\frac{5}{6}\\right)~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{4.5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{4.5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}}$$\n\nThe units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving units of $\\mathrm{mM}^{-1}$ in the denominator, which results in units of $\\mathrm{mM}$ for the concentration, as expected.\n\nNow, we compute the final numerical value:\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{7/6}{4.5}~\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{7/6}{9/2}~\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{7}{6} \\times \\frac{2}{9}~\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{14}{54}~\\mathrm{mM} = \\frac{7}{27}~\\mathrm{mM}$$\n\nTo obtain a decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{7}{27} \\approx 0.259259259...~\\mathrm{mM}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$C(60~\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 0.259~\\mathrm{mM}$$",

Let's model the evolution of the longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ over one repetition time, $TR$.\n\nLet $M_{z}^{-}$ be the longitudinal magnetization just before an RF pulse and $M_{z}^{+}$ be the magnetization just after the pulse. The RF pulse with flip angle $\\alpha$ rotates the magnetization, so the component remaining along the z-axis is:\n$$\nM_{z}^{+} = M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha\n$$\nFollowing the pulse, the longitudinal magnetization recovers towards its equilibrium value $M_0$ over the time interval $TR$. The governing equation is given as $M_{z}(\\Delta t) = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}(0))\\exp(-\\Delta t/T_{1})$. Here, the initial magnetization is $M_{z}(0) = M_{z}^{+}$ and the time interval is $\\Delta t = TR$. At the end of this interval, the magnetization will be equal to the magnetization before the next pulse, $M_z^{-}$. This is the steady-state condition.\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}^{+}) \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nSubstituting $M_{z}^{+} = M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha$ into the steady-state recovery equation:\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha) \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nWe need to solve this equation for $M_{z}^{-}$. Let's expand the right side:\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} - M_{0} \\exp(-TR/T_{1}) + M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nNow, we group terms containing $M_{z}^{-}$:\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} - M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1}) = M_{0} (1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1}))\n$$\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} (1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})) = M_{0} (1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1}))\n$$\nSolving for $M_{z}^{-}$ gives the steady-state longitudinal magnetization just before the RF pulse:\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}{1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}\n$$\nThe problem states that the transverse signal, $S$, is proportional to the available longitudinal magnetization just before the pulse, $M_{z}^{-}$, times $\\sin\\alpha$. Thus, the signal as a function of the flip angle $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\nS(\\alpha) \\propto M_{z}^{-} \\sin\\alpha = M_{0} \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1})) \\sin\\alpha}{1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}\n$$\nTo find the optimal flip angle, $\\alpha_{opt}$, that maximizes this signal, we need to take the derivative of $S(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and set it to zero. The terms $M_{0}$ and $(1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1}))$ are constant with respect to $\\alpha$, so we only need to maximize the function:\n$$\nf(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}\n$$\nFor simplification, let $E_{1} = \\exp(-TR/T_{1})$. Then $f(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{1 - E_{1} \\cos\\alpha}$.\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{(\\cos\\alpha)(1 - E_{1} \\cos\\alpha) - (\\sin\\alpha)(E_{1} \\sin\\alpha)}{(1 - E_{1} \\cos\\alpha)^2}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero means the numerator must be zero:\n$$\n(\\cos\\alpha)(1 - E_{1} \\cos\\alpha) - (\\sin\\alpha)(E_{1} \\sin\\alpha) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\alpha - E_{1} \\cos^2\\alpha - E_{1} \\sin^2\\alpha = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $E_1$ and using the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha = 1$:\n$$\n\\cos\\alpha - E_{1}(\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\alpha - E_{1}(1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\alpha = E_{1}\n$$\nThis gives the condition for the optimal flip angle, known as the Ernst angle. Substituting back $E_1 = \\exp(-TR/T_1)$, we get:\n$$\n\\cos(\\alpha_{opt}) = \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nThe optimal flip angle is therefore:\n$$\n\\alpha_{opt} = \\arccos\\left(\\exp(-TR/T_{1})\\right)\n$$\nThis is the general analytical expression for the optimal flip angle as a function of $TR$ and $T_{1}$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the new optimal flip angle for the post-contrast tissue with $T_{1,\\text{post}} = 400$ ms and a repetition time of $TR = 5$ ms.
