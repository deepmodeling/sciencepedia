A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed in three parts, corresponding to the three quantities requested.\n\n**1. Total Amplitude Attenuation in Decibels**\n\nThe frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$, is given in units of decibels per unit length per unit frequency. The total attenuation, $A_{\\text{dB}}$, along a path of length $L$ for a wave of frequency $f$ is therefore the product of these three quantities:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = \\alpha \\times f \\times L\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n-   $\\alpha = 0.3\\,\\text{dB}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\\,\\text{MHz}^{-1}$\n-   $f = 2\\,\\text{MHz}$\n-   $L = 3\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nThe total attenuation in decibels is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = (0.3\\,\\text{dB}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\\,\\text{MHz}^{-1}) \\times (2\\,\\text{MHz}) \\times (3\\,\\text{cm}) = 1.8\\,\\text{dB}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed with four significant figures. Therefore, we write the total attenuation as $1.800\\,\\text{dB}$.\n\n**2. Amplitude Reduction Factor**\n\nThe decibel scale for an amplitude quantity, such as pressure ($P$), relates the initial pressure ($P_{\\text{initial}}$) to the final, attenuated pressure ($P_{\\text{final}}$) by the following formula:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{initial}}}{P_{\\text{final}}} \\right)\n$$\nIn our context, $P_{\\text{initial}}$ is the pressure measured in water, $P_r$, and $P_{\\text{final}}$ is the derated pressure in tissue, $P_{r.3}$. The amplitude reduction factor, let's call it $R$, is the ratio of the derated amplitude to the in-water amplitude:\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{r.3}}{P_r}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the decibel formula to solve for this ratio. First, note that $\\frac{P_{r.3}}{P_r}$ is the reciprocal of $\\frac{P_r}{P_{r.3}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} \\right) = -20 \\log_{10}(R)\n$$\nSolving for $R$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(R) = -\\frac{A_{\\text{dB}}}{20}\n$$\n$$\nR = 10^{-\\frac{A_{\\text{dB}}}{20}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $A_{\\text{dB}} = 1.8$:\n$$\nR = 10^{-\\frac{1.8}{20}} = 10^{-0.09}\n$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\nR \\approx 0.8128305...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the amplitude reduction factor is $0.8128$. This is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n**3. Derated Peak Rarefactional Pressure ($P_{r.3}$)**\n\nThe derated peak rarefactional pressure, $P_{r.3}$, is obtained by applying the amplitude reduction factor $R$ to the pressure measured in water, $P_r$.\n$$\nP_{r.3} = R \\times P_r\n$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $R$ for precision and the given value of $P_r = 1.2\\,\\text{MPa}$:\n$$\nP_{r.3} = (0.8128305...) \\times (1.2\\,\\text{MPa})\n$$\n$$\nP_{r.3} \\approx 0.9753966...\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nP_{r.3} = 0.9754\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThis value, $P_{r.3}$, is the pressure used in the calculation of the Mechanical Index, which is defined as $\\text{MI} = \\frac{P_{r.3}}{\\sqrt{f}}$, where $P_{r.3}$ is in $\\text{MPa}$ and $f$ is in $\\text{MHz}$.\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   Total attenuation: $1.800\\,\\text{dB}$\n-   Amplitude reduction factor: $0.8128$\n-   Derated pressure $P_{r.3}$: $0.9754\\,\\text{MPa}$",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, resting on the standard definitions of intensity metrics used in ultrasound safety assessment. All necessary information is provided, and the requested tasks are logically sequential and solvable. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires three parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between Spatial-Peak Temporal-Average Intensity ($\\mathrm{ISPTA}$) and Spatial-Peak Pulse-Average Intensity ($\\mathrm{ISPPA}$); second, a numerical calculation of $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$; and third, a qualitative discussion of the implication for the Thermal Index ($\\mathrm{TI}$).\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Relationship**\n\nWe begin with the definitions provided in the problem statement. The Spatial-Peak Temporal-Average Intensity, $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$, is the intensity averaged over one full period, $T$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} I(t)\\,dt\n$$\nwhere $I(t)$ is the instantaneous intensity at the spatial peak.\n\nThe period from $t=0$ to $t=T$ consists of two intervals: the transmit \"on-time\" of duration $\\tau$, and the \"off-time\" of duration $T-\\tau$. We can split the integral over the full period into integrals over these two intervals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} I(t)\\,dt = \\int_{\\text{on}} I(t)\\,dt + \\int_{\\text{off}} I(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThe problem states that we assume negligible acoustic emission during the receive intervals, which means the intensity during the \"off-time\" is approximately zero: $I(t) \\approx 0$ for $t \\in \\text{off-time}$. Consequently, the integral over the off-time is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text{off}} I(t)\\,dt \\approx 0\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the total integral, we find that the total energy deposited over one period is effectively the energy deposited during the pulse \"on-time\":\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} I(t)\\,dt = \\int_{\\text{on}} I(t)\\,dt\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this result into the definition of $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{\\text{on}} I(t)\\,dt\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of the Spatial-Peak Pulse-Average Intensity, $\\mathrm{ISPPA}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPPA} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\int_{\\text{on}} I(t)\\,dt\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the integral over the \"on-time\" in terms of $\\mathrm{ISPPA}$ and the pulse duration $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text on} I(t)\\,dt = \\mathrm{ISPPA} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for the integral back into our equation for $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\frac{1}{T}(\\mathrm{ISPPA} \\cdot \\tau)\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\mathrm{ISPPA} \\cdot \\frac{\\tau}{T}\n$$\nFinally, we use the definition of the duty cycle, $\\delta = \\frac{\\tau}{T}$, to arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\mathrm{ISPPA} \\cdot \\delta\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\mathrm{ISPPA} = 100~\\mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$\n$\\delta = 0.005$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = (100~\\mathrm{W/cm^{2}}) \\cdot (0.005)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} = 0.5~\\mathrm{W/cm^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.5$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.500$.\nThus, the numerical value is $0.500~\\mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Implication for the Thermal Index (TI)**\n\nThe Thermal Index ($\\mathrm{TI}$) is a metric designed to estimate the potential for temperature increase in tissue due to ultrasound exposure. Tissue heating is primarily caused by the absorption of acoustic energy over time. The rate of energy deposition per unit area is given by the temporal-average intensity, $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$. Therefore, for a given tissue type and beam geometry, the rate of temperature rise is directly related to $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$.\n\nThe problem defines $\\mathrm{TI}$ as the ratio of the estimated acoustic power to the power needed to produce a $1~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ temperature rise. Since acoustic power is the intensity multiplied by the beam area ($P = I \\cdot A$), and we are assuming all other conditions (like beam area) are constant, the acoustic power is directly proportional to the temporal-average intensity.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Power} \\propto \\mathrm{ISPTA}\n$$\nTherefore, the Thermal Index is also proportional to $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TI} \\propto \\mathrm{ISPTA}\n$$\nWe are asked to consider the effect of increasing the duty cycle, $\\delta$, while holding the pulse-average intensity, $\\mathrm{ISPPA}$, constant. From our derived relationship, $\\mathrm{ISPTA} = \\mathrm{ISPPA} \\cdot \\delta$.\nIf $\\mathrm{ISPPA}$ is held constant, then $\\mathrm{ISPTA}$ is directly proportional to $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ISPTA} \\propto \\delta \\quad (\\text{for constant } \\mathrm{ISPPA})\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{TI} \\propto \\mathrm{ISPTA}$, it follows that:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TI} \\propto \\delta \\quad (\\text{for constant } \\mathrm{ISPPA})\n$$\nQualitatively, this means that increasing the duty cycle, while keeping the intensity during each pulse constant, results in a greater overall energy deposition over time. A larger duty cycle implies that the ultrasound beam is \"on\" for a larger fraction of the time, leading to a higher temporal-average intensity. This increased average power delivery leads to a proportionally higher estimated temperature rise and, consequently, a higher Thermal Index. This highlights a fundamental trade-off in ultrasound imaging: system settings that increase the duty cycle (e.g., to improve Doppler sensitivity) can increase the thermal bioeffects risk.",
