This can be found by comparing the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the two designs.\n\n**1. Matched Filter SNR**\nFor a signal received in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the maximum achievable SNR is given by the output of a matched filter:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}_r}{N_0} $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{E}_r$ is the energy of the received echo pulse (defined here as pressure-squared energy, $\\int p_r(t)^2 dt$) and $N_0$ is the two-sided noise power spectral density.\n\n**2.

For a Gaussian pulse, $\\mathcal{E}_t \\propto P_0^2 \\Delta t$.\nThe pulse duration $\\Delta t$ and spectral bandwidth $\\Delta f$ (both defined as FWHM) are linked by the time-bandwidth product for a transform-limited Gaussian pulse:\n$$ \\Delta t \\cdot \\Delta f = \\frac{4\\ln(2)}{\\pi} \\implies \\Delta t = \\frac{4\\ln(2)}{\\pi \\Delta f} $$\nThe fractional bandwidth is $FBW = \\Delta f / f_0$, so $\\Delta f = FBW \\cdot f_0$.

Received Energy and SNR**\nThe received energy $\\mathcal{E}_r$ is the transmitted energy reduced by reflection and attenuation. Since the propagation path and reflection coefficient are the same for both designs, $\\mathcal{E}_r \\propto \\mathcal{E}_t$. With a fixed drive pressure $P_0$, the SNR for each design is therefore also inversely proportional to its fractional bandwidth:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} \\propto \\frac{1}{FBW} $$\n\n**4.

Since the drive limit is identical, the transmitted pulse from B cannot be made stronger. The only way to improve its SNR is to have a more sensitive receiver, i.e., one with a lower noise floor (lower $N_0$).\nThe dynamic range (DR) of a system is the ratio of the maximum possible signal to the minimum detectable signal, which is limited by the noise floor. Thus, $DR \\propto 1/(\\text{Noise Power})$. To make $\\mathrm{SNR}_B = \\mathrm{SNR}_A$, the noise power for system B must be reduced by a factor of 1.5.
