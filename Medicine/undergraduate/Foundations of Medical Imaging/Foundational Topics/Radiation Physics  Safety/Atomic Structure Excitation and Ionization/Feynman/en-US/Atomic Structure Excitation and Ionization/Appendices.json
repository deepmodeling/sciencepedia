Characteristic X-rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled by an electron from a higher shell, and the resulting photon carries away the energy difference.

It presents a standard problem in atomic physics with direct applications to medical imaging technology. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the emission of characteristic X-rays is the conservation of energy. When an atom has a vacancy in an inner electronic shell, it is in an excited, high-energy state. It can de-excite by an electron from a higher-energy (less tightly bound) outer shell transitioning to fill the inner-shell vacancy. The excess energy is released as a photon. The energy of this emitted photon, $E_{\\text{photon}}$, is equal to the difference between the binding energy of the electron's initial shell (which corresponds to the shell with the vacancy) and the binding energy of the electron's final shell (the outer shell from which the electron originated). Let $E_{BE, \\text{inner}}$ be the binding energy of the inner shell with the vacancy and $E_{BE, \\text{outer}}$ be the binding energy of the outer shell supplying the electron. The photon energy is given by:\n$$E_{\\text{photon}} = E_{BE, \\text{inner}} - E_{BE, \\text{outer}}$$\nBinding energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a shell to infinity. Therefore, a more tightly bound electron in an inner shell has a higher binding energy.\n\n1.

This means an electron from the $L2$ subshell ($2p_{1/2}$) fills the vacancy in the $K$ shell ($1s_{1/2}$). The inner shell is $K$ and the outer shell is $L2$.\n$$E_{K\\alpha_{2}} = E_{K} - E_{L2}$$\n\n2.

This will be done using the provided hydrogenic model for atomic energy levels.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. The energy of a photon, $E_{\\text{photon}}$, emitted during an electronic transition is equal to the difference between the initial energy state, $E_{i}$, and the final energy state, $E_{f}$, of the electron:\n$$E_{\\text{photon}} = E_{i} - E_{f}$$\nThe problem provides a hydrogenic model for the one-electron orbital energies:\n$$E_{n} = -R_{E}\\,\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}}{n^{2}}$$\nwhere $R_{E}$ is the Rydberg energy, $n$ is the principal quantum number, and $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective nuclear charge.\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted from a transition between an initial state $n_i$ and a final state $n_f$ would naively be $E_{n_i} - E_{n_f}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fraction of incident photons with energies greater than the K-edge, $f_{\\text{above}}$, is defined as the ratio of the number of photons with energy above $E_{K}$ to the total number of photons in the spectrum. The number of photons within any energy interval is obtained by integrating the differential photon number spectral density, $n(E)$, over that interval.\n\nThe problem states that $n(E)$ is proportional to $\\frac{E_{\\max} - E}{E}$. Let the proportionality constant be $C$. Thus, the spectral density is:\n$$n(E) = C \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right)$$\nThe total number of photons in the effective energy interval $[E_{\\min}, E_{\\max}]$ is $N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} n(E) \\, dE = \\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} C \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE$$\nThe number of photons with energies above the K-edge, $N_{\\text{above}}$, is found by integrating from $E_K$ to $E_{\\max}$:\n$$N_{\\text{above}} = \\int_{E_K}^{E_{\\max}} n(E) \\, dE = \\int_{E_K}^{E_{\\max}} C \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE$$\nThe desired fraction, $f_{\\text{above}}$, is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$f_{\\text{above}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{above}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\int_{E_K}^{E_{\\max}} C \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE}{\\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} C \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE}$$\nThe proportionality constant $C$ is non-zero and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This cancellation is justified because we are calculating a relative fraction. The assumption of constant detector efficiency over the energy range also means that the fraction of *detected* counts would be identical to this fraction of incident photons, as any constant efficiency factor would similarly cancel.\n\nWe now evaluate the definite integrals. The indefinite integral of the function is:\n$$\\int \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE = E_{\\max} \\ln(E) - E + \\text{const.}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator integral (for $N_{\\text{above}}$):\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{E_K}^{E_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE &= \\left[ E_{\\max} \\ln(E) - E \\right]_{E_K}^{E_{\\max}} \\\\\n&= (E_{\\max} \\ln(E_{\\max}) - E_{\\max}) - (E_{\\max} \\ln(E_K) - E_K) \\\\\n&= E_{\\max} (\\ln(E_{\\max}) - \\ln(E_K)) - (E_{\\max} - E_K) \\\\\n&= E_{\\max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_K}\\right) - (E_{\\max} - E_K)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator integral (for $N_{\\text{total}}$):\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\max}}{E} - 1 \\right) \\, dE &= \\left[ E_{\\max} \\ln(E) - E \\right]_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} \\\\\n&= (E_{\\max} \\ln(E_{\\max}) - E_{\\max}) - (E_{\\max} \\ln(E_{\\min}) - E_{\\min}) \\\\\n&= E_{\\max} (\\ln(E_{\\max}) - \\ln(E_{\\min})) - (E_{\\max} - E_{\\min}) \\\\\n&= E_{\\max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_{\\min}}\\right) - (E_{\\max} - E_{\\min})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe expression for the fraction $f_{\\text{above}}$ is therefore:\n$$f_{\\text{above}} = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_K}\\right) - (E_{\\max} - E_K)}{E_{\\max} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{E_{\\min}}\\right) - (E_{\\max} - E_{\\min})}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $E_{\\max} = 70$ keV, $E_K = 33$ keV, and $E_{\\min} = 15$ keV. The energy units (keV) are consistent and will cancel in all ratios and terms, so we can use the pure numbers.\n$$f_{\\text{above}} = \\frac{70 \\ln\\left(\\frac{70}{33}\\right) - (70 - 33)}{70 \\ln\\left(\\frac{70}{15}\\right) - (70 - 15)}$$\n$$f_{\\text{above}} = \\frac{70 \\ln\\left(\\frac{70}{33}\\right) - 37}{70 \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) - 55}$$\nCalculating the values:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{70}{33}\\right) \\approx \\ln(2.1212...) \\approx 0.751991$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) \\approx \\ln(4.6666...) \\approx 1.540445$$\nSubstitute these into the expression for $f_{\\text{above}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{above}} \\approx \\frac{70 \\times 0.751991 - 37}{70 \\times 1.540445 - 55}$$\n$$f_{\\text{above}} \\approx \\frac{52.63937 - 37}{107.83115 - 55}$$\n$$f_{\\text{above}} \\approx \\frac{15.63937}{52.83115} \\approx 0.296024$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $f_{\\text{above}} = 0.296$.\n\nThe physical implication of this result ($f_{\\text{above}} \\approx 0.296$) is that approximately $29.6\\%$ of the photons in the filtered x-ray beam have energies above the iodine K-edge. This means that nearly $30\\%$ of the photons are available to interact with iodine via the K-shell photoelectric effect, which is the interaction responsible for the sharp increase in x-ray attenuation that defines the K-edge. The remaining fraction, $1 - f_{\\text{above}} \\approx 70.4\\%$, consists of photons with energies below the K-edge. K-edge imaging relies on measuring the significant difference in attenuation for photons just above versus just below the K-edge. The fact that the below-edge photons are more than twice as numerous as the above-edge photons in this spectrum has important consequences for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the iodine-specific signal. While a fraction of $\\approx 0.3$ is substantial enough to make K-edge imaging feasible, it highlights the challenge of optimizing x-ray spectra to maximize the number of useful photons in the narrow energy window around the K-edge while managing overall patient dose.",
