            "problem": "In the foundations of medical imaging, ionizing radiation deposits energy in tissue measured by absorbed dose $D$ in $\\mathrm{Gy}$ (gray). Deterministic effects (for example, radiation-induced skin injury) exhibit threshold-like behavior in severity as a function of dose, while stochastic effects (for example, radiation-induced cancer) are characterized by probabilities that increase with dose without a threshold. Consider the following models consistent with these qualitative principles:\n- A deterministic severity index for skin injury is modeled by a sigmoidal function $S(D)$ given by $S(D)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\big(-3(D-2)\\big)}$, where $D$ is in $\\mathrm{Gy}$.\n- A stochastic cancer risk follows a linear no-threshold model $P(D)=\\alpha D$ with slope $\\alpha=\\;0.05$ per $\\mathrm{Gy}$, appropriate for diagnostic X-ray photons where the radiation weighting factor $w_{R}=1$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and models, compute the severity $S(D_{1})$ at $D_{1}=3\\,\\mathrm{Gy}$ and the stochastic probability $P(D_{2})$ at $D_{2}=0.1\\,\\mathrm{Gy}$. To quantitatively compare deterministic severity at a high dose with stochastic probability at a lower dose, calculate the ratio $R=\\frac{S(D_{1})}{P(D_{2})}$.

The validation process confirms that the problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe deterministic severity index for skin injury is given by the sigmoidal function:\n$$S(D) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3(D-2))}$$\nwhere $D$ is the absorbed dose in $\\mathrm{Gy}$. We are asked to compute the severity $S(D_1)$ at a dose of $D_1 = 3\\,\\mathrm{Gy}$. Substituting this value into the function, we get:\n$$S(D_1) = S(3) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3(3-2))}$$\n$$S(3) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3(1))}$$\n$$S(3) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3)}$$\n\nThe stochastic cancer risk is described by the linear no-threshold model:\n$$P(D) = \\alpha D$$\nwhere the slope is given as $\\alpha = 0.05$ per $\\mathrm{Gy}$. We need to compute the probability $P(D_2)$ at a dose of $D_2 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{Gy}$.

Using the expressions derived above:\n$$R = \\frac{S(3)}{P(0.1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3)}}{0.005}$$\n$$R = \\frac{1}{0.005 \\times (1 + \\exp(-3))}$$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we first evaluate the denominator. The value of $\\exp(-3)$ is approximately $0.049787$.\n$$1 + \\exp(-3) \\approx 1 + 0.049787 = 1.049787$$\nNow, we calculate the denominator of the expression for $R$:\n$$0.005 \\times (1 + \\exp(-3)) \\approx 0.005 \\times 1.049787 = 0.0052489$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0052489} \\approx 190.5148$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem statement requires the calculation of equivalent and effective doses based on given absorbed doses and weighting factors, which is a standard procedure in medical physics.\n\nThe fundamental quantities are defined as follows:\n1.  **Absorbed Dose ($D_T$)**: The mean energy deposited by ionizing radiation per unit mass of a tissue or organ $T$. It is measured in grays (Gy), where $1 \\text{ Gy} = 1 \\text{ J/kg}$.\n2.  **Equivalent Dose ($H_T$)**: The absorbed dose in a tissue or organ $T$ adjusted for the biological effectiveness of the type of radiation.
