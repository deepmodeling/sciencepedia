The test involves imaging a specialized target with a perfectly sinusoidal intensity pattern of a specific spatial frequency. The contrast of the target itself, defined as the modulation of its intensity, is known to be precisely 0.90.\n\nThe lens system projects an image of this target onto a sensor. An analysis of the captured digital image shows that the intensity pattern is still sinusoidal, but its amplitude is reduced. The brightest parts of the image pattern have a normalized intensity of 0.80, and the darkest parts have a normalized intensity of 0.20.\n\nThe quality of an imaging system at a given spatial frequency is quantified by its Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), which measures how effectively the system transfers the modulation (contrast) from the object to the image.\n\nCalculate the value of the MTF for this lens system at the spatial frequency of the test target.

Let's call this $M_{object}$.\n$$M_{object} = 0.90$$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the modulation of the image formed by the lens system. The problem gives the maximum and minimum intensities in the image. Let's denote them as $I_{max, image}$ and $I_{min, image}$.\n$$I_{max, image} = 0.80$$\n$$I_{min, image} = 0.20$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the image modulation, $M_{image}$, using the formula for modulation:\n$$M_{image} = \\frac{I_{max, image} - I_{min, image}}{I_{max, image} + I_{min, image}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{image} = \\frac{0.80 - 0.20}{0.80 + 0.20} = \\frac{0.60}{1.00} = 0.60$$\n\nThe Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at a given spatial frequency is the ratio of the image modulation to the object modulation at that same frequency.\n$$MTF = \\frac{M_{image}}{M_{object}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the values we have for $M_{image}$ and $M_{object}$:\n$$MTF = \\frac{0.60}{0.90}$$\n$$MTF = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$$MTF = 0.6666...$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$MTF \\approx 0.667$$",

The detector pixels integrate the optical signal over a top-hat aperture of width $p$ (a spatial averaging over the interval $[-p/2,p/2]$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the modulation transfer function (MTF) for a composite linear shift-invariant (LSI) imaging system and the subsequent calculation of the spatial frequency at which this MTF drops to $50\\%$ of its maximum value.\n\nThe system is a cascade of two independent LSI components: an optical blur and a detector pixel aperture. In an LSI system, the overall point spread function (PSF), denoted $h_{sys}(x)$, is the convolution of the individual component PSFs. Let $h_{blur}(x)$ be the PSF of the optical blur and $h_{pixel}(x)$ be the PSF corresponding to the detector aperture effect. The system PSF is then:\n$$h_{sys}(x) = h_{blur}(x) * h_{pixel}(x)$$\nwhere $*$ denotes the convolution operation.\n\nAccording to the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Fourier transforms. In this context, the Optical Transfer Function (OTF) is defined as the Fourier transform of the PSF. Therefore, the system OTF, $OTF_{sys}(f)$, is the product of the component OTFs:\n$$OTF_{sys}(f) = OTF_{blur}(f) \\cdot OTF_{pixel}(f)$$\nThe Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is the magnitude of the OTF, $MTF(f) = |OTF(f)|$. For our system, this means:\n$$MTF_{sys}(f) = |OTF_{blur}(f)| \\cdot |OTF_{pixel}(f)|$$\n\nWe will now derive the OTF for each component using the specified Fourier transform convention: $\\mathcal{F}\\{u(x)\\}(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x)\\,\\exp(-i\\,2\\pi f x)\\,dx$.\n\n1.  **OTF of the Gaussian Blur**\n\nThe PSF for the optical blur is given as a Gaussian function:\n$$h_{blur}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$$\nTo find its OTF, we compute its Fourier transform:\n$$OTF_{blur}(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h_{blur}(x)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\exp(-i\\,2\\pi f x)\\,dx$$\nThis is a standard Fourier transform pair. The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. The integral evaluates to:\n$$OTF_{blur}(f) = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2}f^{2}\\right)$$\nThis function is real and always positive, so its magnitude is the function itself:\n$$MTF_{blur}(f) = |OTF_{blur}(f)| = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2}f^{2}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **OTF of the Pixel Aperture**\n\nThe detector pixel is described as performing a spatial averaging over an interval of width $p$, from $-p/2$ to $p/2$. This operation is equivalent to a convolution with a normalized rectangular function, which is the PSF of the pixel aperture:\n$$h_{pixel}(x) = \\frac{1}{p}\\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{p}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\text{rect}(z) = 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1/2$ and $0$ otherwise. The normalization factor $1/p$ ensures that the integral of the PSF is unity. The OTF is the Fourier transform of this PSF:\n$$OTF_{pixel}(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{p}\\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{p}\\right)\\right\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{p}\\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{p}\\right) \\exp(-i\\,2\\pi f x)\\,dx$$\n$$OTF_{pixel}(f) = \\frac{1}{p} \\int_{-p/2}^{p/2} \\exp(-i\\,2\\pi f x)\\,dx$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$OTF_{pixel}(f) = \\frac{1}{p} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-i\\,2\\pi f x)}{-i\\,2\\pi f} \\right]_{-p/2}^{p/2} = \\frac{1}{p(-i\\,2\\pi f)} \\left( \\exp(-i\\pi fp) - \\exp(i\\pi fp) \\right)$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\sin(\\theta) = (\\exp(i\\theta) - \\exp(-i\\theta))/(2i)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$OTF_{pixel}(f) = \\frac{1}{\\pi fp} \\frac{\\exp(i\\pi fp) - \\exp(-i\\pi fp)}{2i} = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi fp)}{\\pi fp}$$\nThis function is the (normalized) sinc function, which we can denote as $\\mathrm{sinc}(fp)$. This function is real, so its magnitude is its absolute value:\n$$MTF_{pixel}(f) = |OTF_{pixel}(f)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi fp)}{\\pi fp}\\right|$$\n\n3.  **Composite System MTF**\n\nCombining the results, the composite system MTF is:\n$$MTF_{sys}(f) = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2}f^{2}\\right) \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi fp)}{\\pi fp}\\right|$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the MTF of the composite system.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Spatial Frequency $f_{50}$**\n\nWe are asked to find the spatial frequency $f_{50}$ at which the MTF falls to $0.5$ of its zero-frequency value. First, we confirm the zero-frequency value:\n$$MTF_{sys}(0) = \\lim_{f\\to 0} \\left( \\exp\\left(-2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2}f^{2}\\right) \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\pi fp)}{\\pi fp}\\right| \\right) = \\exp(0) \\cdot |1| = 1$$\nThus, we need to solve the equation $MTF_{sys}(f_{50}) = 0.5$.\nWe are interested in the frequency $f_{50}>0$. The sinc function term is positive for frequencies below its first zero, which occurs at $\\pi f p = \\pi$, or $f = 1/p$. For the given parameters, this is $f = 1/0.15 \\approx 6.67$ cyc/mm. We expect $f_{50}$ to be in this range, so we can drop the absolute value.\nThe equation to solve is:\n$$\\exp\\left(-2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2}f_{50}^{2}\\right) \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f_{50}p)}{\\pi f_{50}p} = 0.5$$\nWe substitute the given values: $\\sigma = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $p = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$2\\pi^{2}\\sigma^{2} = 2\\pi^{2}(0.06)^{2} = 0.0072\\pi^{2}$$\n$$\\pi p = 0.15\\pi$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\\exp\\left(-0.0072\\pi^{2}f_{50}^{2}\\right) \\frac{\\sin(0.15\\pi f_{50})}{0.15\\pi f_{50}} = 0.5$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $f_{50}$ and must be solved numerically. Let's define the function $G(f) = \\exp(-0.0072\\pi^{2}f^{2}) \\frac{\\sin(0.15\\pi f)}{0.15\\pi f} - 0.5$. We are looking for the root $f_{50}$ of $G(f)=0$.\nBy using a numerical solver (such as Newton's method or a bisection algorithm), we can find the root. Let us test a value, for instance $f = 2.5$:\n$$G(2.5) = \\exp(-0.0072\\pi^{2}(2.5)^{2}) \\frac{\\sin(0.15\\pi(2.5))}{0.15\\pi(2.5)} - 0.5$$\n$$G(2.5) = \\exp(-0.44413) \\frac{\\sin(1.1781)}{1.1781} - 0.5 \\approx (0.6413)(0.7843) - 0.5 \\approx 0.5031 - 0.5 = 0.0031$$\nThis is very close to zero, suggesting $f_{50}$ is slightly larger than $2.5$.\nTesting $f = 2.51$:\n$$G(2.51) = \\exp(-0.0072\\pi^{2}(2.51)^{2}) \\frac{\\sin(0.15\\pi(2.51))}{0.15\\pi(2.51)} - 0.5$$\n$$G(2.51) = \\exp(-0.44768) \\frac{\\sin(1.1828)}{1.1828} - 0.5 \\approx (0.6391)(0.7826) - 0.5 \\approx 0.49997 - 0.5 = -0.00003$$\nThe root clearly lies between $2.50$ and $2.51$. A more precise numerical solution yields $f_{50} \\approx 2.50995$ cyc/mm.\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$f_{50} \\approx 2.51\\,\\text{cyc/mm}$$",
