The image is reconstructed by padding k-space with zeros to a $256\\times 256$ grid prior to inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). Consider the principles that in Cartesian MRI the k-space sampling interval is $\\Delta k = 1/F$ and the maximum sampled spatial frequency magnitude is $k_{\\max} = (N_{\\text{acq}}/2)\\,\\Delta k = N_{\\text{acq}}/(2F)$ along each axis, where $N_{\\text{acq}}$ is the number of acquired samples along that axis.

Zero-filling increases true resolution from $F/192$ to $F/256$ and reduces Gibbs ringing amplitude by $25\\%$ due to smoothing; the ringing spatial period in millimeters decreases correspondingly.\n\nB.

The problem states $k_{\\max} = N_{\\text{acq}}/(2F)$. Since the acquisition uses $N_{\\text{acq}} = 192$ samples, the value of $k_{\\max}$ is fixed by the acquisition. Zero-filling pads the k-space matrix with zeros but does not add any new, non-zero data at higher spatial frequencies. Therefore, $k_{\\max}$ and the true spatial resolution (which is inversely related to $k_{\\max}$ and defines the width of the Point Spread Function, PSF) remain unchanged. The nominal resolution is $F/192$.\n\n2.  **Displayed Pixel Size**: The pixel size in the reconstructed image is given by the Field of View (FOV) divided by the reconstruction matrix size, $N_{\\text{recon}}$. The FOV, $F$, is fixed. By padding to a $256\\times 256$ grid, $N_{\\text{recon}}$ becomes 256. Thus, the displayed pixel size decreases from $F/192$ to $F/256$. This process is an interpolation, making the image appear smoother but does not add real detail.\n\n3.  **Gibbs Ringing**: This artifact is caused by the sharp truncation of k-space data at $k_{\\max}$.\n    -   **Amplitude**: The amplitude of the ringing (the characteristic overshoot of ~9% at a step edge) is a fundamental consequence of this sharp truncation (the Gibbs phenomenon) and is not affected by zero-filling.\n    -   **Appearance**: The spatial period of the ringing in physical units (e.g., mm) is determined by $k_{\\max}$ and is therefore unchanged. However, since the pixel size has decreased, this constant physical period is now sampled by more pixels. The number of pixels spanning one period of the ringing increases from what it would have been on a $192\\times 192$ grid. The ratio of the new number of pixels per period to the old is $(F/192) / (F/256) = 256/192 = 4/3$.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n-   Option A is incorrect because true resolution does not increase and ringing amplitude is not reduced.\n-   Option C is incorrect as it confuses Gibbs ringing with aliasing and misstates the effect on pixel size.\n-   Option D is incorrect as it confuses zero-filling with apodization.\n-   Option E is incorrect because true resolution does not improve and ringing amplitude does not increase.\n\nOption B correctly summarizes all these points: true resolution is unchanged, displayed pixel size is reduced, Gibbs ringing amplitude is unchanged, and the ringing is \"stretched\" over more pixels.",

Case 2 removes wrap-around.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fourier-based imaging, specifically as applied in MRI. The concepts of k-space, field-of-view, spatial resolution, and wrap-around (aliasing) are central to the field. The provided mathematical relationship is the standard definition of the Fourier transform.\n\nLet us analyze the relationships between the sampling parameters and the image properties based on the principles of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is the discrete equivalent of the continuous transform mentioned.\n\n1.  **Field-of-View (FOV) and Wrap-around:** Uniform sampling in the frequency domain (k-space) with an interval $\\Delta k$ results in a periodic replication in the conjugate spatial domain ($x$-domain). The period of this replication defines the Field-of-View (FOV) of the reconstructed image. The relationship is $\\mathrm{FOV} = 1/\\Delta k$. Wrap-around aliasing occurs if the extent of the object, $L_{obj}$, exceeds the FOV. The condition to avoid wrap-around is $L_{obj} \\le \\mathrm{FOV}$, which is equivalent to the Nyquist criterion for k-space sampling: $\\Delta k \\le 1/L_{obj}$.\n\n2.  **Spatial Resolution:** The spatial resolution, or more precisely the pixel/grid spacing $\\Delta x$ in the reconstructed image, is determined by the total extent of the k-space data acquisition, $k_{span} = N \\Delta k$. The relationship is $\\Delta x = 1/k_{span} = 1/(N \\Delta k)$. This can also be seen as $\\Delta x = \\mathrm{FOV}/N$. Improving spatial resolution means decreasing $\\Delta x$.\n\nLet's check the numerical consistency of the problem statement.\n-   **Initial State:** $N_0 = 256$, $\\Delta k_0 = 1/32\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   The initial FOV is $\\mathrm{FOV}_0 = 1/\\Delta k_0 = 1 / (1/32\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = 32\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   The object extent is $L_{obj} = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   Since $L_{obj} > \\mathrm{FOV}_0$, the object is larger than the field of view. This correctly predicts that wrap-around aliasing must be present in the initial state.\n\n-   **Analysis of Case 1:** Parameters are $N_1 = 512$, $\\Delta k_1 = 1/32\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   The new FOV is $\\mathrm{FOV}_1 = 1/\\Delta k_1 = 1 / (1/32\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = 32\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   Since the FOV is unchanged and is still smaller than the object extent ($32\\,\\mathrm{cm} < 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), wrap-around **must persist**. This matches the observed outcome.\n    -   The initial grid spacing was $\\Delta x_0 = 1/(N_0 \\Delta k_0) = 1/(256 \\times 1/32) = 1/8\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.125\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   The new grid spacing is $\\Delta x_1 = 1/(N_1 \\Delta k_1) = 1/(512 \\times 1/32) = 1/16\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.0625\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   Since $\\Delta x_1 < \\Delta x_0$, the grid spacing has decreased, which corresponds to an **improvement in spatial resolution**. This also matches the observed outcome.\n\n-   **Analysis of Case 2:** Parameters are $N_2 = 256$, $\\Delta k_2 = 1/48\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   The new FOV is $\\mathrm{FOV}_2 = 1/\\Delta k_2 = 1 / (1/48\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = 48\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    -   Now, the FOV is larger than the object extent ($\\mathrm{FOV}_2 = 48\\,\\mathrm{cm} > L_{obj} = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$). The condition to avoid aliasing is met. Therefore, wrap-around is **removed**. This matches the observed outcome.\n\nThe problem statement, including the described cases and their outcomes, is fully consistent with the fundamental principles of Fourier imaging. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The analysis will proceed to evaluate the provided options.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the duality of the Fourier transform. The sampling interval in one domain determines the period (extent) in the conjugate domain, while the total sampled width in one domain determines the resolution (grid spacing) in the conjugate domain.\n\n-   k-space sampling interval $\\Delta k$ determines image-space period/extent (FOV): $\\mathrm{FOV} = 1/\\Delta k$.\n-   k-space sampling extent $k_{span} = N \\Delta k$ determines image-space resolution/grid spacing: $\\Delta x = 1/(N \\Delta k)$.\n\nWrap-around is a spatial aliasing artifact caused by the object extending beyond the FOV. To eliminate it, the FOV must be increased to be at least as large as the object. This requires reducing the k-space sampling interval $\\Delta k$.\n\nSpatial resolution is the ability to distinguish fine details. In the context of a discrete grid, it is limited by the grid spacing $\\Delta x$. To improve resolution (i.e., decrease $\\Delta x$), one must increase the total k-space coverage, $N \\Delta k$.\n\nWith this framework, let us evaluate the options:\n\n**A. Reducing $\\Delta k$ increases the period of the implicit periodic extension in the image domain, allowing the object’s support to fit within a single period and eliminating wrap-around; increasing $N$ at fixed $\\Delta k$ only decreases the image grid spacing $\\Delta x$ (improving resolution) without changing that period, so wrap-around persists if it was present.**\n\n-   This statement correctly identifies that the \"period of the implicit periodic extension\" is the FOV, and its value is $1/\\Delta k$.\n-   It correctly states that reducing $\\Delta k$ increases this period (FOV), which is the mechanism for eliminating wrap-around, matching the observation in Case 2. In our analysis, reducing $\\Delta k$ to $1/48\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ increased the FOV to $48\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which successfully encompassed the $40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ object.\n-   It correctly states that increasing $N$ at a fixed $\\Delta k$ decreases the grid spacing $\\Delta x$, thereby improving resolution. Our analysis for Case 1 showed $\\Delta x$ decreased from $0.125\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ to $0.0625\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n-   It correctly states that this change (increasing $N$) does not alter the period (FOV), and thus wrap-around persists if the object was initially larger than the FOV. Our analysis for Case 1 showed the FOV remained $32\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and wrap-around persisted.\n-   This option provides a complete and accurate explanation for all observations.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increasing $N$ at fixed $\\Delta k$ increases the maximum sampled spatial frequency $k_{\\max}$ enough to satisfy the Nyquist criterion for the object, thereby removing wrap-around; reducing $\\Delta k$ merely increases resolution and cannot affect aliasing.**\n\n-   This statement incorrectly associates wrap-around with the Nyquist criterion as applied to $k_{\\max}$. Wrap-around is aliasing in the *spatial* domain due to undersampling in the *k-space* domain. The relevant criterion is $\\Delta k \\le 1/L_{obj}$. Increasing $k_{\\max}$ (by increasing $N$) improves resolution, but does not affect the aliasing condition which depends on $\\Delta k$.\n-   The claim that increasing $N$ removes wrap-around is directly contradicted by the observed outcome in Case 1.\n-   The claim that reducing $\\Delta k$ \"merely increases resolution\" is false. For a fixed $N$, reducing $\\Delta k$ *worsens* resolution (increases $\\Delta x = 1/(N\\Delta k)$).\n-   The claim that reducing $\\Delta k$ \"cannot affect aliasing\" is also false; it is the primary method to affect and eliminate aliasing.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Wrap-around is caused by insufficient $k_{\\max}$, so increasing $N$ at fixed $\\Delta k$ removes it by extending the sampled bandwidth, whereas reducing $\\Delta k$ does not change aliasing unless $N$ is simultaneously increased.**\n\n-   This statement incorrectly identifies the cause of wrap-around. It is caused by $\\Delta k$ being too large (insufficient sampling density), not by insufficient $k_{\\max}$ (insufficient bandwidth/coverage). Insufficient $k_{\\max}$ leads to blurring (poor resolution).\n-   The conclusion that increasing $N$ removes wrap-around is factually wrong, as per the outcome of Case 1.\n-   The claim that reducing $\\Delta k$ does not change aliasing is also factually wrong. It is precisely what removes aliasing in Case 2.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Wrap-around arises from time-domain sampling effects, so changing $\\Delta k$ (a frequency-domain parameter) does not influence aliasing; increasing $N$ fixes the artifact by enlarging the reconstructed image extent.**\n\n-   While sampling in k-space occurs over time, the direct cause of spatial wrap-around is the k-space sampling interval $\\Delta k$. The statement that changing $\\Delta k$ \"does not influence aliasing\" is fundamentally wrong.\n-   The statement that \"increasing $N$ fixes the artifact by enlarging the reconstructed image extent\" is also incorrect. The \"reconstructed image extent\" is the FOV ($1/\\Delta k$). Increasing $N$ while keeping $\\Delta k$ fixed does *not* change the FOV. It only increases the number of pixels within that FOV.\n-   This statement contradicts both the principles of Fourier imaging and the observed outcomes.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only statement that correctly and completely explains the observed phenomena based on the fundamental principles of MRI and Fourier analysis is A.",
