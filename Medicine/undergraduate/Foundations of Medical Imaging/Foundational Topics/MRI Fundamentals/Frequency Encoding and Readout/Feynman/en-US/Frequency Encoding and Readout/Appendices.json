In reality, tissues like fat and water resonate at slightly different frequencies due to a phenomenon called chemical shift.

            "problem": "A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system acquires a two-dimensional gradient-echo image of a rectangular phantom composed of two semi-infinite regions separated by a sharp, vertical interface: the left half is predominantly fat and the right half is predominantly water. The static magnetic field is $B_0$, and the transmitter/receiver center frequency is tuned to water. The readout (frequency-encoding) gradient is applied along the $x$-axis, with the positive gradient polarity defined such that the instantaneous Larmor frequency increases toward $+x$ (left-to-right on the display). The chemical shift between bulk fat and bulk water is approximately $\\delta \\approx 3.5$ parts per million, so fat resonates at a lower frequency than water by $\\Delta f \\approx \\delta f_0$, where $f_0 = \\gamma B_0 / (2\\pi)$ and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Imaging System:** Two-dimensional gradient-echo MRI.\n-   **Object (Phantom):** Rectangular, composed of two semi-infinite regions separated by a sharp, vertical interface.\n    -   Left half ($x<0$): Predominantly fat.\n    -   Right half ($x>0$): Predominantly water.\n-   **Magnetic Field:** Static field is $B_0$.\n-   **RF System:** Transmitter/receiver center frequency is tuned to the resonance of water.\n-   **Readout Gradient (Initial Polarity):** Applied along the $x$-axis, $G_x$. Positive polarity means the Larmor frequency increases toward $+x$ (left-to-right).\n-   **Chemical Shift:** The shift between bulk fat and bulk water is $\\delta \\approx 3.5$ parts per million (ppm).\n-   **Frequency Difference:** Fat resonates at a lower frequency than water by $\\Delta f \\approx \\delta f_0$.\n-   **Larmor Frequency:** $f_0 = \\frac{\\gamma B_0}{2\\pi}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The frequency at a position $x$ under a gradient $G_x$ is $f(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}(B_0 + x G_x)$.\n-   **Reconstruction Rule:** The system maps a measured signal frequency $f_{meas}$ to an image position $x_{image}$ assuming the signal is from on-resonance water.\n-   **Question:** Determine the qualitative black-white banding pattern (Type 1 chemical shift artifact) at the fat-water interface and how reversing the readout gradient polarity changes the physical location of the bands.\n-   **Assumptions:** Typical $T_2^*$ decay and echo time for gradient-echo. The interface is sharp compared to pixel size. The bandwidth per pixel is finite.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, including the Larmor equation, the phenomenon of chemical shift between fat and water, and the mechanism of spatial encoding using magnetic field gradients. The value of $\\delta \\approx 3.5$ ppm is the standard, accepted value. All principles are correct and well-established in physics and medical imaging.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear physical setup and a specific question. The initial conditions (gradient polarity, phantom geometry) are defined, and the task is to predict a known physical effect based on these conditions. The use of a semi-infinite phantom is a common idealization in physics problems to study boundary effects. Although this idealization, when taken literally, produces only one half of the complete artifact (a dark band but no bright band, or vice versa), the phrasing \"black-white banding pattern\" strongly implies that the question is about the canonical artifact pair. This requires interpreting the single interface as representative of one boundary of a finite object, a standard pedagogical approach. Given this reasonable interpretation, the problem is well-posed and has a unique, meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous claims. All terms are standard within the field of MRI physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **VALID**. It is a standard conceptual problem in MRI physics. The solution proceeds by deriving the spatial misregistration from first principles and analyzing its consequences at a boundary.\n\n## DERIVATION & SOLUTION\n\n### First Principles\n1.  **Larmor Frequency:** In a magnetic field $B$, the Larmor frequency is $f = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2\\pi}$. With a static field $B_0$ and a linear readout gradient $G_x$ along the $x$-axis, the total field is $B(x) = B_0 + x G_x$. The position-dependent Larmor frequency is $f(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}(B_0 + x G_x) = f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x$, where $f_0$ is the Larmor frequency in the absence of the gradient.\n\n2.  **Chemical Shift:** Due to different electronic environments, fat protons are shielded more than water protons. They experience a slightly weaker local field and thus resonate at a lower frequency. The frequency of water at $x$ is $f_W(x) = f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x$. The frequency of fat at the same position $x$ is $f_F(x) = (f_0 - \\Delta f) + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x$, where $\\Delta f > 0$ is the chemical shift frequency difference.\n\n3.  **Spatial Encoding and Reconstruction:** The MRI system is tuned to water, meaning it assumes any received signal with frequency $f_{meas}$ originates from water. It calculates the image position $x_{image}$ by inverting the Larmor relation for water:\n    $$f_{meas} = f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x_{image} \\implies x_{image} = \\frac{f_{meas} - f_0}{\\gamma G_x / (2\\pi)}$$\n    The term $BW_{spatial} = \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi}$ represents the frequency change per unit distance (Hz/m).\n\n### Spatial Misregistration of Fat\nLet's find the apparent position $x_{image}$ for fat protons located at a true physical position $x_{true}$. The measured frequency is $f_{meas} = f_F(x_{true}) = (f_0 - \\Delta f) + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x_{true}$. Plugging this into the reconstruction formula:\n$$x_{image} = \\frac{\\left( (f_0 - \\Delta f) + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x_{true} \\right) - f_0}{\\gamma G_x / (2\\pi)} = \\frac{-\\Delta f + \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} x_{true}}{\\gamma G_x / (2\\pi)} = x_{true} - \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\gamma G_x / (2\\pi)}$$\nThe fat signal is displaced by an amount $\\Delta x_{shift}$:\n$$\\Delta x_{shift} = - \\frac{\\Delta f}{BW_{spatial}} = - \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\gamma G_x / (2\\pi)}$$\nSince $\\Delta f > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the sign of the shift $\\Delta x_{shift}$ is opposite to the sign of the gradient $G_x$. Fat, having a lower intrinsic frequency, is always shifted in the direction of lower frequency along the readout axis.\n\n### Banding Pattern Analysis\nTo produce both a bright (signal pile-up) and a dark (signal void) band, we must consider a finite object, as this creates two distinct interfaces. Let's model a finite fat-containing structure surrounded by water, which is the canonical case for illustrating the artifact pair.\n\n**Case 1: Initial Polarity ($G_x > 0$)**\n-   **Frequency Direction:** The frequency increases towards $+x$ (left-to-right). The $-x$ direction is the low-frequency direction, and the $+x$ direction is the high-frequency direction.\n-   **Fat Shift:** Since $G_x > 0$, the shift $\\Delta x_{shift}$ is negative. Fat is shifted in the $-x$ direction (to the left, toward lower frequency).\n-   **Artifact Formation (at the boundaries of a finite fat object):**\n    -   **Low-Frequency Boundary:** At the boundary where fat meets water on the low-frequency side (e.g., a [Water | Fat] interface), the fat signal is shifted onto the adjacent water signal's location. This superposition of signals results in a **bright band** on the low-frequency side of the fat object.\n    -   **High-Frequency Boundary:** At the boundary where fat meets water on the high-frequency side (e.g., a [Fat | Water] interface), the fat signal is shifted away from the water. This creates a signal void between the apparent end of the fat and the start of the water. This results in a **dark band** on the high-frequency side of the fat object.\n-   **Summary for $G_x > 0$:** A bright band appears on the physical side corresponding to the low-frequency direction, and a dark band appears on the physical side corresponding to the high-frequency direction.\n\n**Case 2: Reversed Polarity ($G_x < 0$)**\n-   **Frequency Direction:** The frequency now decreases towards $+x$. The $+x$ direction is the new low-frequency direction, and the $-x$ direction is the new high-frequency direction.\n-   **Fat Shift:** Since $G_x < 0$, the shift $\\Delta x_{shift}$ is positive. Fat is shifted in the $+x$ direction (to the right, toward the new lower frequency).\n-   **Artifact Formation:** The identities of the bands are invariant with respect to the frequency direction: the bright band is always on the low-frequency side of the object, and the dark band is always on the high-frequency side.\n    -   **Bright Band (Low-Frequency Side):** This band now appears on the physical side corresponding to the new low-frequency direction, which is the $+x$ (right) side.\n    -   **Dark Band (High-Frequency Side):** This band now appears on the physical side corresponding to the new high-frequency direction, which is the $-x$ (left) side.\n-   **Conclusion on Reversal:** Reversing the readout gradient polarity reverses the physical directions of \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\". Consequently, the bright and dark bands **swap their physical positions** from one side of the object to the other.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A bright band appears on the low-frequency side of the interface and a dark band on the high-frequency side; reversing the readout polarity swaps the bands to the opposite physical sides of the boundary.**\n-   This statement accurately describes the canonical Type 1 chemical shift artifact for a fat-containing object. The bright band (pile-up) is on the side of the object in the low-frequency direction, and the dark band (void) is on the side in the high-frequency direction. As derived, reversing the gradient polarity flips the physical meaning of \"low-frequency\" and \"high-frequency\" directions, causing the bands to trade physical sides.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A dark band appears on the low-frequency side and a bright band on the high-frequency side; reversing the readout polarity does not change band sidedness because only phase encoding is affected.**\n-   The first clause describes the artifact for a water-containing object within fat, which is the reverse of the standard example. The second clause is factually incorrect. Reversing the readout gradient directly alters the frequency-to-position mapping, which is the cause of the artifact. It has no primary effect on phase encoding. This reversal critically changes the physical location of the artifact.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Symmetric dark–dark bands form on both sides of the interface due to intravoxel opposed-phase cancellation; reversing the readout polarity leaves the pattern unchanged.**\n-   This describes the Type 2 chemical shift artifact (India ink artifact), not the Type 1 artifact (spatial misregistration) requested in the problem. Type 2 artifact arises from the phase difference between fat and water signals at the echo time ($TE$), leading to signal loss in voxels containing both. The problem explicitly asks about spatial misregistration along the readout axis.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Banding occurs only along the phase-encoding axis; reversing the readout polarity merely reorders sampled lines in $k$-space and does not alter the spatial locations of the bands at the interface.**\n-   Type 1 chemical shift artifact is a phenomenon of the frequency-encoding (readout) axis, not the phase-encoding axis. The frequency difference $\\Delta f$ causes a mis-mapping specifically in the direction where frequency is used to encode position. The second clause is also incorrect; reversing the readout gradient fundamentally alters the spatial mapping and thus the location of the bands.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Select all that apply.\n\nA. Swapping the frequency- and phase-encoding directions reorients the direction along which fat–water misregistration appears, because the position–frequency mapping used for reconstruction changes axis; this is advisable when critical fat–water interfaces (such as the optic nerve sheath) lie perpendicular to the original frequency-encoding axis, provided that motion along the new phase-encoding axis is minimal.\n\nB. Swapping the frequency- and phase-encoding directions reduces out-of-phase (so-called Type 2) chemical shift dark rims by altering the echo time, thereby minimizing fat–water cancellation at boundaries.\n\nC. For a given field strength, the magnitude of fat–water spatial displacement in millimeters is independent of the readout bandwidth per pixel, so swapping encoding directions is equally effective regardless of receiver bandwidth.\n\nD.

Consequently, the fat–water misregistration (type 1 chemical shift artifact) will appear along the new frequency-encoding axis, effectively reorienting the bright/dark band relative to anatomy. This can move the artifact away from a critical boundary if the boundary’s orientation is unfavorable in the original configuration. However, the trade-off is that the new phase-encoding axis becomes more susceptible to motion-induced phase errors and associated ghosting; thus the swap is advisable only when motion along the new phase direction is limited or controllable.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA. This statement asserts that swapping reorients the direction of misregistration and is advisable when important fat–water interfaces are compromised in the original setup, assuming minimal motion along the new phase-encoding axis. From the derivation, the artifact direction is set by the frequency-encoding axis because the frequency–position mapping occurs there. Swapping axes therefore moves the artifact to the new readout direction. This can indeed move chemical shift bands away from a boundary such as the optic nerve sheath if the original readout direction caused the band to overlap that boundary. The proviso about motion along the new phase direction is appropriate, as phase-encoding is motion-sensitive. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims that swapping reduces out-of-phase (Type 2) chemical shift by altering the echo time. Swapping encoding axes does not, by itself, change the echo time $TE$; Type 2 chemical shift (fat–water cancellation) depends on the relative phase at $TE$, which is set by timing and field strength, not by which axis is designated readout or phase-encode. Therefore, swapping does not reduce Type 2 artifacts unless $TE$ is also changed. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This claims independence of the displacement magnitude from readout bandwidth per pixel. From the derivation, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{pix}} = \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{chem}} / BW_{\\mathrm{pix}}$ and $\\Delta x = \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_x / BW_{\\mathrm{read}}$, so increasing bandwidth per pixel decreases the displacement; it is not independent. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This connects field strength to increased frequency separation and hence increased pixel shift for fixed bandwidth per pixel. Since $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\propto f_0 \\propto B_0$, doubling $B_0$ doubles $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. For fixed $BW_{\\mathrm{pix}}$, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{pix}}$ increases proportionally. Thus the impact of swapping (to redirect the artifact away from boundaries) can be greater at $3\\,\\mathrm{T}$ than at $1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. This cautions against swapping when the new phase-encoding axis aligns with substantial periodic motion because of ghosting. Phase-encoding is sensitive to motion-induced phase inconsistencies across repetitions, which produce ghosts along the phase-encode axis. Aligning that axis with respiration or pulsation commonly worsens ghosting. Therefore, even if chemical shift bands are moved, overall diagnostic quality may degrade. Verdict: Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A, D, and E.",

With constant $G_x$, the flat-top duration needed to traverse this width is\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{flat}} = \\frac{2 k_{x,\\max}}{(\\gamma/(2\\pi))\\, G_x} = \\frac{4\\pi \\, k_{x,\\max}}{\\gamma \\, G_x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, G_x \\, \\delta x}.\n$$\nThe gradient ramps are limited by the maximum slew rate $S_{\\max}$, so the time to ramp from $0$ to $G_x$ is\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{ramp}} = \\frac{G_x}{S_{\\max}},\n$$\nand the total readout duration, including both ramps and the flat-top, is\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{tot}}(G_x) = 2\\, t_{\\mathrm{ramp}} + T_{\\mathrm{flat}} = \\frac{2 G_x}{S_{\\max}} + \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, G_x \\, \\delta x}.\n$$\nIf there were no constraints on $G_x$, the optimal $G_x$ minimizing $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}(G_x)$ is obtained by differentiating with respect to $G_x$ and setting to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{d G_x} = \\frac{2}{S_{\\max}} - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, \\delta x} \\frac{1}{G_x^{2}} = 0\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\nG_{x,\\mathrm{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\, S_{\\max}}{\\gamma \\, \\delta x}}.\n$$\nHowever, there are two hard upper bounds on $G_x$:\n- The hardware amplitude limit $G_{\\max}$.\n- The Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) maximum sampling rate $f_{s,\\max}$, which imposes a minimum dwell time $\\Delta t_{\\min} = 1/f_{s,\\max}$. The field-of-view sampling condition requires $\\Delta t = 2\\pi/(\\gamma G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x) \\ge \\Delta t_{\\min}$, equivalently\n$$\nG_x \\le G_{\\mathrm{ADC}} \\equiv \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{FOV}_x \\, \\Delta t_{\\min}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the feasible $G_x$ must satisfy $0 < G_x \\le \\min(G_{\\max}, G_{\\mathrm{ADC}})$. The minimizing choice is\n$$\nG_x^{\\star} = \n\\begin{cases}\nG_{x,\\mathrm{opt}}, & \\text{if } G_{x,\\mathrm{opt}} \\le \\min(G_{\\max}, G_{\\mathrm{ADC}}),\\\\\n\\min(G_{\\max}, G_{\\mathrm{ADC}}), & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow evaluate numerically. First convert given quantities to consistent units and compute derived values:\n- $\\mathrm{FOV}_x = 240 \\text{ mm} = 0.240 \\text{ m}$.\n- $\\delta x = \\mathrm{FOV}_x/256 = 0.240/256 = 0.0009375 \\text{ m}$.\n- $G_{\\max} = 35 \\text{ mT/m} = 0.035 \\text{ T/m}$.\n- $S_{\\max} = 150 \\text{ T/m/s}$.\n- $f_{s,\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ Hz} \\Rightarrow \\Delta t_{\\min} = 1/f_{s,\\max} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}$.\n- $\\gamma = 2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ rad s}^{-1}\\text{T}^{-1}$.\n\nCompute the unconstrained optimum:\n$$\nG_{x,\\mathrm{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\, S_{\\max}}{\\gamma \\, \\delta x}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\times 150}{\\left(2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}\\right) \\times 0.0009375}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{150}{2 \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6} \\times 0.0009375}}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\gamma \\, \\delta x = \\left(2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}\\right) \\times 0.0009375 \\approx 2.50817 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ s}^{-1}\\text{T}^{-1},\n$$\nso\n$$\nG_{x,\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\times 150}{2.50817 \\times 10^{5}}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.878 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 4.333 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ T/m}.\n$$\nNext, compute the ADC-imposed bound:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{ADC}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{FOV}_x \\, \\Delta t_{\\min}}\n= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\left(2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}\\right) \\times 0.240 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}}\n= \\frac{1}{42.58 \\times 10^{6} \\times 0.240 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{ADC}} \\approx \\frac{1}{20.4384} \\text{ T/m} \\approx 4.891 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ T/m}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nG_{x,\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx 0.04333 \\text{ T/m}, \\quad G_{\\max} = 0.035 \\text{ T/m}, \\quad G_{\\mathrm{ADC}} \\approx 0.04891 \\text{ T/m}.\n$$\nThe feasible maximum is $\\min(G_{\\max}, G_{\\mathrm{ADC}}) = 0.035 \\text{ T/m}$, which is less than $G_{x,\\mathrm{opt}}$. Thus the minimizing feasible choice is\n$$\nG_x^{\\star} = G_{\\max} = 0.035 \\text{ T/m}.\n$$\nWith this $G_x^{\\star}$, the dwell time from the field-of-view condition is\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, G_x^{\\star} \\, \\mathrm{FOV}_x}\n= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\left(2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}\\right)\\times 0.035 \\times 0.240}\n\\approx 2.795 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s},\n$$\nwhich satisfies $\\Delta t \\ge \\Delta t_{\\min}$, as required.\n\nThe flat-top duration can be found either from $T_{\\mathrm{flat}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\, G_x^{\\star} \\, \\delta x}$ or equivalently $T_{\\mathrm{flat}} = N \\Delta t$ with $N = \\mathrm{FOV}_x/\\delta x = 256$. Using the latter for numerical consistency,\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{flat}} = 256 \\times 2.795 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s} \\approx 7.155 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s} = 0.7155 \\text{ ms}.\n$$\nThe slew-limited ramp time is\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{ramp}} = \\frac{G_x^{\\star}}{S_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.035}{150} \\text{ s} \\approx 2.333 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s} = 0.2333 \\text{ ms}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total readout duration is\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2\\, t_{\\mathrm{ramp}} + T_{\\mathrm{flat}} \\approx 2 \\times 0.2333 \\text{ ms} + 0.7155 \\text{ ms} \\approx 1.182 \\text{ ms}.\n$$\nRounded to $4$ significant figures and expressed in milliseconds, the minimum achievable total readout duration is $1.182 \\text{ ms}$.",
