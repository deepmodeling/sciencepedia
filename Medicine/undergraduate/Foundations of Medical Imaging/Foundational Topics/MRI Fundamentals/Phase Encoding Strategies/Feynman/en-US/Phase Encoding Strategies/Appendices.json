Calculate the Required Gradient Area**\n\nThe change in the $k$-space position, $\\Delta k_y$, over the duration $T$ of the gradient blip is given by the integral of the gradient waveform, scaled by the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\Delta k_y = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{T} G_y(t) \\, dt $$\nThe integral term represents the area of the gradient blip, which we denote as $A_{blip}$.\n$$ A_{blip} = \\int_{0}^{T} G_y(t) \\, dt $$\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta k_y = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} A_{blip} $$\nThe problem requires a $k$-space increment that corresponds to the reciprocal of the field of view in the phase-encode direction, $\\text{FOV}_y$:\n$$ \\Delta k_y = \\frac{1}{\\text{FOV}_y} $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta k_y$, we can solve for the required area $A_{blip}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\text{FOV}_y} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} A_{blip} \\implies A_{blip} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\cdot \\text{FOV}_y} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $\\gamma = 2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{rad}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\ \\text{T}^{-1}$ and $\\text{FOV}_y = 0.24\\ \\text{m}$:\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{2\\pi}{(2\\pi \\times 42.58 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.24} = \\frac{1}{(42.58 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.24} \\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{1}{10219200} \\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 9.7855 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n\n**2. Feasibility Check**\n\nWe must verify if the required area $A_{blip}$ is within the allowed budget $A_{\\text{budget}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$.\nSince $A_{blip} \\approx 9.7855 \\times 10^{-8}  1.2 \\times 10^{-7}$, the required area is less than the budget. The design is therefore feasible.\n\n**3. Determine the Time-Optimal Waveform Shape**\n\nA time-optimal gradient pulse that starts and ends at zero amplitude to achieve a specific area is one that utilizes the maximum slew rate, $S_{\\max}$. The shape will be either a triangle (if the peak amplitude is less than $G_{\\max}$) or a trapezoid (if the peak amplitude is clipped at $G_{\\max}$).\n\nTo determine which case applies, we compute the area of a triangular pulse that ramps up to $G_{\\max}$ at $S_{\\max}$ and immediately ramps down at $-S_{\\max}$. The time to ramp up is $t_{ramp} = G_{\\max}/S_{\\max}$. The area of such a minimal-duration, maximal-amplitude triangular pulse, $A_{triangle}$, is:\n$$ A_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\text{base}) \\cdot (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (2 t_{ramp}) \\cdot G_{\\max} = \\frac{G_{\\max}}{S_{\\max}} \\cdot G_{\\max} = \\frac{G_{\\max}^2}{S_{\\max}} $$\nSubstituting the hardware limits, $G_{\\max} = 0.04\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$ and $S_{\\max} = 150\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$ A_{triangle} = \\frac{(0.04)^2}{150} = \\frac{0.0016}{150} \\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 1.0667 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nWe compare the required area $A_{blip}$ with $A_{triangle}$:\n$$ A_{blip} \\approx 9.7855 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ A_{triangle} \\approx 1.0667 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nSince $A_{blip}  A_{triangle}$, the gradient blip will not reach the maximum amplitude $G_{\\max}$. The time-optimal shape is therefore a symmetric triangle.\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimal Duration**\n\nFor a symmetric triangular pulse of total duration $T$, the gradient ramps to a peak amplitude $G_{peak}$ in time $T/2$ and back to zero in the subsequent time $T/2$. The slew rate is constant during the ramps, so $S_{\\max} = G_{peak} / (T/2)$, which implies $G_{peak} = S_{\\max} T / 2$.\nThe area of this triangle is given by:\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\text{base}) \\cdot (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot T \\cdot G_{peak} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_{peak}$:\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot T \\cdot \\left(\\frac{S_{\\max} T}{2}\\right) = \\frac{S_{\\max} T^2}{4} $$\nWe can now solve for the minimal duration, $T_{min} = T$:\n$$ T_{min}^2 = \\frac{4 A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}} \\implies T_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{blip}$ and the value of $S_{\\max}$:\n$$ T_{min} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1/(10219200)}{150}} \\ \\text{s} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10219200 \\times 150}} \\ \\text{s} $$\n$$ T_{min} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1532880000}} \\ \\text{s} \\approx 5.108063 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the duration in milliseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ T_{min} \\approx (5.108063 \\times 10^{-5}) \\ \\text{s} \\times \\left(\\frac{1000 \\ \\text{ms}}{1 \\ \\text{s}}\\right) = 0.05108063 \\ \\text{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal duration is $0.05108\\ \\text{ms}$.",

The number of phase-encode lines, $N_{\\text{pe}}$, is the number of discrete steps taken to cover the $k$-space extent:\n    $$N_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{2k_{y,\\max}}{\\Delta k_y}$$\n    By substituting the expressions for $FOV_y$ and $\\Delta y$, we can express $N_{\\text{pe}}$ as:\n    $$N_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{1/\\Delta y}{1/FOV_y} = \\frac{FOV_y}{\\Delta y}$$\n4.  For a single-shot EPI acquisition, a full $k$-space dataset is acquired in a single echo train. The total readout duration, $T_{\\text{readout}}$, is the product of the number of phase-encode lines and the time between echoes (echo spacing, $T_{\\text{esp}}$):\n    $$T_{\\text{readout}} = N_{\\text{pe}} \\times T_{\\text{esp}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of phase-encode lines for the baseline scan, $N_{\\text{pe},0}$.\nThe given baseline parameters are $FOV_{y,0} = 0.24 \\ \\text{m}$ and $\\Delta y_0 = 1.0 \\ \\text{mm} = 0.001 \\ \\text{m}$.\n$$N_{\\text{pe},0} = \\frac{FOV_{y,0}}{\\Delta y_0} = \\frac{0.24 \\ \\text{m}}{0.001 \\ \\text{m}} = 240$$\n\nNext, we determine the new number of phase-encode lines, $N_{\\text{pe},1}$.\nThe problem states that the redesign maintains the same spatial resolution, $\\Delta y_1 = \\Delta y_0$.

Let's denote them as $y_a = -6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $y_b = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up and Solve the SENSE Equations\nThe signal measured in each coil at the aliased location $\\tilde{y}$ is the sum of the true signals from the aliasing locations, weighted by the respective coil sensitivities. Let $\\rho(y_a)$ and $\\rho(y_b)$ be the true object magnetizations at locations $y_a$ and $y_b$. The SENSE equations are:\n$$ s_1(\\tilde{y}) = c_1(y_a) \\rho(y_a) + c_1(y_b) \\rho(y_b) $$\n$$ s_2(\\tilde{y}) = c_2(y_a) \\rho(y_a) + c_2(y_b) \\rho(y_b) $$\nIn matrix form, this is $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\rho}$, where:\n$$ \\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} s_1(\\tilde{y}) \\\\ s_2(\\tilde{y}) \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1(y_a)  c_1(y_b) \\\\ c_2(y_a)  c_2(y_b) \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho(y_a) \\\\ \\rho(y_b) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe solution is $\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\mathbf{s}$.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Values and Calculate\nSubstitute the given values into the matrices:\n$$ \\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\\\ 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, find the inverse of the sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{C})} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -1.0  1.0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(\\mathbf{C}) = (1.0)(-0.5) - (0.5)(1.0) = -0.5 - 0.5 = -1.0$.\n$$ \\mathbf{C}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-1.0} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -1.0  1.0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -1.0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, solve for the unaliased magnetizations $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\\\ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -1.0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\\\ 1.0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = (0.5)(3.0) + (0.5)(1.0) = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0 $$\n$$ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = (1.0)(3.0) + (-1.0)(1.0) = 3.0 - 1.0 = 2.0 $$\nThe unaliased object magnetization at location $y=4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ is $2.0\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe question asks for the value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 2.000\\,\\mathrm{a.u.} $$",
