For each index case, the time of symptom onset is standardized to $t=0$ hours, and all subsequent timestamps are recorded as hours since onset. The dataset below lists, for each index case, the interview time and the quarantine times for all identified contacts (all times in hours since onset):\n- Index case $I_{1}$: interview at $20$; contacts quarantined at $44$, $60$.\n- Index case $I_{2}$: interview at $36$; contacts quarantined at $40$, $52$, $90$.\n- Index case $I_{3}$: interview at $18$; contact quarantined at $30$.\n- Index case $I_{4}$: interview at $60$; contacts quarantined at $72$, $110$.\n- Index case $I_{5}$: interview at $24$; contacts quarantined at $46$, $48$.\n\nUsing the core definitions that (i) the total delay for a contact is the elapsed time from the associated index case’s symptom onset to that contact’s quarantine, (ii) the median is the $50$th percentile of the empirical distribution, and (iii) a proportion is the count of events meeting a criterion divided by the total count, do the following:\n1.

The total delay is defined as the time from symptom onset ($t=0$) to quarantine. The interview times are extraneous for this calculation.\n\nThe set of quarantine times, in hours, for all contacts is:\n$\\{44, 60, 40, 52, 90, 30, 72, 110, 46, 48\\}$\n\nThe total number of contacts is $N = 2+3+1+2+2 = 10$.\n\n**1. Compute the median total delay ($M$) in days.**\nTo find the median, the data must be sorted in ascending order:\n$\\{30, 40, 44, 46, 48, 52, 60, 72, 90, 110\\}$\n\nSince there is an even number of data points ($N=10$), the median is the arithmetic mean of the two central values, which are the $N/2 = 5$th and $(N/2)+1 = 6$th values in the sorted list.\nThe $5$th value is $48$ hours.\nThe $6$th value is $52$ hours.\n\nThe median delay in hours is:\n$$ \\text{Median}_{\\text{hours}} = \\frac{48 + 52}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ hours} $$\n\nThe problem requires the median to be expressed in days. There are $24$ hours in a day.\n$$ M = \\frac{50 \\text{ hours}}{24 \\text{ hours/day}} = \\frac{50}{24} \\text{ days} = \\frac{25}{12} \\text{ days} $$\n\n**2. Compute the proportion of contacts with delay $\\le 48$ hours ($P$).**\nWe inspect the sorted list of total delays: $\\{30, 40, 44, 46, 48, 52, 60, 72, 90, 110\\}$.\nWe count the number of contacts, $k$, whose quarantine time is less than or equal to $48$ hours.\nThe values satisfying this criterion are $\\{30, 40, 44, 46, 48\\}$.\nThe count is $k=5$.\n\nThe total number of contacts is $N=10$. The proportion $P$ is:\n$$ P = \\frac{k}{N} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 $$\n\n**3. Compute the composite compliance margin ($S$).**\nThe formula for $S$ is given as:\n$$ S \\equiv \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{T_{m}-M}{T_{m}},\\,\\frac{P-P_{t}}{P_{t}}\\right) $$\nThe given target values are $T_{m} = 3.0$ days and $P_{t} = 0.75$.\nWe have calculated $M = \\frac{25}{12}$ days and $P = 0.5$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the relative margin for the median delay:\n$$ \\frac{T_{m}-M}{T_{m}} = \\frac{3.0 - \\frac{25}{12}}{3.0} = \\frac{\\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12}}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{12}}{3} = \\frac{11}{36} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the relative margin for the proportion:\n$$ \\frac{P-P_{t}}{P_{t}} = \\frac{0.5 - 0.75}{0.75} = \\frac{-0.25}{0.75} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nNow, we find the minimum of these two values for $S$:\n$$ S = \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{11}{36}, -\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nTo compare these values, we can express them as decimals.\n$$ \\frac{11}{36} \\approx 0.30555... $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{3} \\approx -0.33333... $$\nClearly, the negative value is smaller.\n$$ S = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ S = -0.333333... \\approx -0.3333 $$\nThis value indicates that the program missed its targets, and the worst-performing metric was the proportion of contacts quarantined within $48$ hours, which was $33.33\\%$ below its target.",

            "problem": "A public health team is implementing contact tracing and quarantine for a respiratory infection. Let the time from onset to secondary transmission (TOST) be modeled as a random variable $T$ measured in days relative to the index case’s symptom onset, with $T<0$ indicating pre-symptomatic transmission and $T>0$ indicating post-onset transmission. Assume the following scientifically consistent and empirically plausible features:\n\n- Exactly $30\\%$ of all transmission occurs pre-symptom onset, that is, $\\Pr(T<0)=0.30$.\n- Conditional on $T\\geq 0$, the post-onset TOST follows a Gamma distribution with shape $k=2$ and scale $\\theta=2$ days, with probability density function\n$$\nf_{\\text{post}}(t)=\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\,\\theta^{k}}\\,t^{k-1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\theta}\\right),\\quad t\\geq 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the Gamma function.\n- Quarantine of exposed contacts occurs at exactly $t_q=2$ days after the index case’s symptom onset and is perfectly effective and immediate at preventing any transmission that would have occurred after $t_q$.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of probability and the given distributional assumptions, derive from first principles and compute the proportion of total transmission averted by quarantine at $t_q=2$ days.

The quarantine is implemented at time $t_q = 2$ days relative to symptom onset and is perfectly effective. This means any transmission event that would have occurred at a time $T > t_q$ is averted. Therefore, the goal is to compute the probability $\\Pr(T > t_q)$, where $T$ is the random variable representing the time of transmission.\n\nFirst, we must establish the full probability distribution of $T$. The problem states that $T$ describes the time from onset to secondary transmission. The distribution is of a mixed type.\nThe problem provides the probability of pre-symptomatic transmission:\n$$\n\\Pr(T < 0) = 0.30\n$$\nSince the total probability must be $1$, the probability of transmission at or after symptom onset is:\n$$\n\\Pr(T \\geq 0) = 1 - \\Pr(T < 0) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70\n$$\n\nWe want to find the proportion of averted transmission, which is $\\Pr(T > t_q)$, with $t_q = 2$. We can express this probability using the law of total probability, conditioning on whether transmission is pre-symptomatic ($T < 0$) or not ($T \\geq 0$):\n$$\n\\Pr(T > t_q) = \\Pr(T > t_q | T < 0)\\Pr(T < 0) + \\Pr(T > t_q | T \\geq 0)\\Pr(T \\geq 0)\n$$\nLet's analyze each term. We are given $t_q = 2$ days. The condition $T > t_q$ means $T > 2$. The event $T > 2$ and the event $T < 0$ are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability of their intersection is $0$, which implies that the conditional probability $\\Pr(T > 2 | T < 0)$ is $0$.\nPlugging this into the equation, we get:\n$$\n\\Pr(T > 2) = (0) \\cdot \\Pr(T < 0) + \\Pr(T > 2 | T \\geq 0)\\Pr(T \\geq 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(T > 2) = \\Pr(T > 2 | T \\geq 0) \\cdot (0.70)\n$$\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the conditional probability $\\Pr(T > 2 | T \\geq 0)$.

The goal is to maximize the expected number of infections prevented by timely tracing and quarantine. Use the following foundational definitions from preventive medicine and infectious disease epidemiology as the starting point of your derivation.\n\n- The expected number of secondary infections that would occur without intervention from a given index case equals the product of the number of close contacts and the baseline secondary attack rate. If an intervention reaches a contact before they become infectious, and the contact adheres to quarantine, transmission from that contact is reduced by a multiplicative efficacy factor.\n- For a case of type $i$, let $c_i$ denote the expected number of close contacts, $a_i$ the baseline secondary attack rate to those contacts in the absence of intervention, $u_i$ the probability that tracing reaches a contact in time to reduce onward transmission, and $r_i$ the multiplicative reduction in transmission due to quarantine or isolation given timely tracing. Assume independence across contacts and that the expected infections prevented from a case are additive across contacts.\n\nTask 1. Starting from these definitions, derive an expression for the expected infections prevented per traced case of type $i$ in terms of $c_i$, $a_i$, $u_i$, and $r_i$. Then, define decision variables and formulate a mathematical optimization problem that maximizes the total expected infections prevented by allocating tracing effort across the three case types, subject to a total tracer-time (staffing) constraint and availability constraints on the number of cases of each type.

It is scientifically grounded in epidemiological modeling, well-posed as a mathematical optimization problem, and objectively stated.

This case has an expected number of $c_i$ close contacts.\nThe baseline secondary attack rate is $a_i$, which represents the probability that a close contact will be infected by the index case in the absence of any intervention.\nWithout intervention, the total expected number of secondary infections from this single index case is the product of the number of contacts and the attack rate: $E_{\\text{baseline}} = c_i a_i$.\n\nWhen contact tracing is performed for this case, we attempt to reach its $c_i$ contacts.\nFor any single contact, there are two outcomes regarding the tracing effort:\n1.  The contact is reached in time to reduce onward transmission. This occurs with probability $u_i$.\n2.  The contact is not reached in time. This occurs with probability $1-u_i$.\n\nThe problem states that if a contact is reached in time, the transmission is reduced by a multiplicative factor $r_i$. This means a fraction $r_i$ of the potential transmission is prevented. The number of infections from this single contact is $a_i$. Therefore, the number of infections *prevented* for this single contact, given timely tracing, is $a_i r_i$.\n\nThe *expected* number of infections prevented *for a single contact* is the value of the prevention ($a_i r_i$) multiplied by the probability of it occurring ($u_i$):\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, per contact}} = u_i \\cdot (a_i r_i) + (1-u_i) \\cdot 0 = a_i u_i r_i$$\nSince there are $c_i$ independent contacts for a case of type $i$, and the expected values are additive, the total expected number of infections prevented per traced case of type $i$ is the sum of the expected preventions over all contacts.\nLet $v_i$ be this value.\n$$v_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{c_i} E_{\\text{prevented, per contact}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c_i} a_i u_i r_i = c_i a_i u_i r_i$$\n\n**Optimization Problem Formulation**\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total expected infections prevented, subject to constraints on tracer time and the number of available cases.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nLet $x_i$ be the number of cases of type $i$ that are traced, where $i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}$. The problem specifies that cases are indivisible, so $x_i$ must be a non-negative integer.\n\n**Objective Function:**\nThe total expected infections prevented, $Z$, is the sum of the infections prevented from each type of case traced, multiplied by the number of cases of that type that are traced.\n$$ \\text{Maximize } Z = v_A x_A + v_B x_B + v_C x_C $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_i$:\n$$ \\text{Maximize } Z = (c_A a_A u_A r_A) x_A + (c_B a_B u_B r_B) x_B + (c_C a_C u_C r_C) x_C $$\n\n**Constraints:**\n1.  **Total Tracer-Time Constraint:** The total time spent must not exceed the available budget of $H$ hours.

The maximum number of type $A$ cases we can trace is limited by the total time $H = 65$ and the availability $N_A = 60$.\nThe time constraint is $2 x_A \\le 65$, which implies $x_A \\le 32.5$. As $x_A$ must be an integer, $x_A \\le 32$. This is within the availability limit ($32 \\le 60$).\nLet's select $x_A = 32$.\n- Time used: $32 \\times t_A = 32 \\times 2 = 64$ hours.\n- Time remaining: $65 - 64 = 1$ hour.\n- Value generated from type A: $32 \\times v_A = 32 \\times 0.96 = 30.72$.\n\n**Step 2: Allocate remaining time**\nWe have $1$ hour of tracer time left to allocate between type $B$ and type $C$ cases. We must solve a smaller knapsack problem for the remaining $1$ hour.\n$$ \\text{Maximize } 0.20 x_B + 0.192 x_C $$\nSubject to:\n$$ 1 x_B + 0.75 x_C \\le 1 $$\nThe possible integer solutions are:\n- Option 1: Choose one case of type $B$. Set $x_B = 1, x_C = 0$.\n  - Time used: $1 \\times 1 = 1$ hour. This fits the budget.\n  - Value added: $1 \\times v_B = 0.20$.\n- Option 2: Choose one case of type $C$. Set $x_B = 0, x_C = 1$.\n  - Time used: $1 \\times 0.75 = 0.75$ hours. This fits the budget.\n  - Value added: $1 \\times v_C = 0.192$.\n- Option 3: Choose zero cases. $x_B=0, x_C=0$. Value added is $0$.\n\nComparing the options, choosing one case of type $B$ provides the highest additional value ($0.20 > 0.192$). Thus, we set $x_B = 1$ and $x_C = 0$.\n\n**Final Allocation:**\nThe resulting allocation is $x_A = 32$, $x_B = 1$, $x_C = 0$.\n- Total time used: $(32 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0.75) = 64 + 1 + 0 = 65$ hours.\n- Total expected infections prevented: $(32 \\times 0.96) + (1 \\times 0.20) + (0 \\times 0.192) = 30.72 + 0.20 = 30.92$.\n\nThis greedy-with-correction approach is robust for this problem structure. Any alternative allocation, such as tracing fewer type $A$ cases to free up time for more of types $B$ and $C$, would result in a lower total value because type $A$ is significantly more efficient per hour. For instance, swapping one case of type $A$ (cost $2$ hours, value $0.96$) for two cases of type $B$ (cost $2$ hours, value $2 \\times 0.20 = 0.40$) results in a net loss of value.\n\nThe optimal integer allocation is $(x_A, x_B, x_C) = (32, 1, 0)$.",
