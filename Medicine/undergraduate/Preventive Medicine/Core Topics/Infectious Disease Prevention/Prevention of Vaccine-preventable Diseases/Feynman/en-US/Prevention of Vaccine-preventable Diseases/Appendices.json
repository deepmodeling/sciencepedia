            "problem": "A city plans to prevent measles transmission through vaccination. Assume a large, randomly mixing population without demographic turnover during the relevant time frame. The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) of measles is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. The effective reproduction number ($R_e$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections in a partially immune population and must satisfy $R_e  1$ to ensure herd immunity (population-level interruption of sustained transmission). Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) against infection is defined as the probability that a vaccinated individual becomes immune to infection, and individuals who do not develop immunity after vaccination remain fully susceptible. If a proportion $V$ of the population receives the vaccine, the fraction susceptible after vaccination is assumed to be $1 - \\mathrm{VE}\\cdot V$ under random mixing.\n\nStarting from these definitions and conditions, derive the minimal vaccination proportion $V_{\\min}$ required for herd immunity as a function of $R_0$ and $\\mathrm{VE}$. Then, using $R_0 = 15$ and $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$, compute $V_{\\min}$ as a decimal. Finally, quantify sensitivity to a $5$ percentage-point absolute reduction in $\\mathrm{VE}$ (i.e., from $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$ to $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.90$) by computing the new minimal vaccination proportion under $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.90$. Round each computed proportion to three significant figures and express your answers as decimals with no percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, internally consistent, and well-posed. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined as the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$.\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\nFor herd immunity to be achieved and transmission to be interrupted, the effective reproduction number must be less than $1$.\n$$R_e  1$$\nSubstituting the first equation into this inequality gives the condition for the susceptible fraction:\n$$R_0 \\cdot s  1 \\implies s  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThe problem provides a model for how the susceptible fraction $s$ depends on the vaccination proportion $V$ and the vaccine effectiveness $\\mathrm{VE}$. The proportion of the population that is vaccinated is $V$. Of this group, a fraction $\\mathrm{VE}$ becomes immune. Thus, the proportion of the total population that is vaccinated and immune is $\\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$. The fraction of the population that remains susceptible, $s$, is therefore $1$ minus the fraction that is immune due to vaccination.\n$$s = 1 - \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\nThis assumes that the entire population is initially susceptible and that immunity is conferred only through vaccination.\n\nTo find the required vaccination coverage, we substitute this expression for $s$ into the herd immunity condition:\n$$1 - \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nWe must solve this inequality for $V$.\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}  \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\n$$\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}  \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\nAssuming $\\mathrm{VE}  0$, we can divide by $\\mathrm{VE}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$V  \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}}$$\nThe minimal vaccination proportion, $V_{\\min}$, required to achieve herd immunity is the lower bound of this inequality.\n$$V_{\\min} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}}$$\nThis equation provides the minimal vaccination proportion as a function of the basic reproduction number and vaccine effectiveness.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $V_{\\min}$ using the given parameters for measles: $R_0 = 15$ and $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$.\n$$V_{\\min} = \\frac{15 - 1}{15 \\cdot 0.95} = \\frac{14}{14.25}$$\n$$V_{\\min} \\approx 0.982456...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal vaccination proportion is $0.982$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the sensitivity to a $5$ percentage-point absolute reduction in $\\mathrm{VE}$. The new vaccine effectiveness is $\\mathrm{VE}_{\\text{new}} = 0.95 - 0.05 = 0.90$.

This result signifies that, under the model's assumptions, if the vaccine effectiveness drops to $0.90$, herd immunity becomes unattainable for an infectious agent with $R_0 = 15$, regardless of vaccination coverage.\n\nThe two computed values are therefore $0.982$ and $1.04$.",

            "problem": "A public health team is evaluating measles transmission potential in a closed, homogeneously mixing community.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed, providing sufficient and consistent information for a valid solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle for analyzing disease transmission in a partially immune population is the relationship between the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the effective reproduction number, $R_e$. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the average number of secondary infections caused by a single typical infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the analogous quantity in a population that is not fully susceptible due to immunity.\n\nThe value of $R_e$ is directly proportional to the fraction of the population that is susceptible to the infection. Let this fraction be denoted by $s$. The relationship is given by:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\n\nThe problem is to determine the value of $s$ for the given community. The population is characterized by a vaccination coverage, which we denote as $p_v$, and a vaccine efficacy, $VE$. The provided values are $p_v = 0.88$ and $VE = 0.93$. The problem states to assume negligible immunity from prior infections. Therefore, susceptibility in the population is only reduced by vaccination.\n\nWe can partition the total population into two groups: those who are vaccinated and those who are not.\n\n1.  The proportion of the population that is **unvaccinated** is $1 - p_v$. Since there is no other source of immunity, this entire group is susceptible to infection.\n    Their contribution to the total susceptible proportion is $1 - p_v$.\n\n2.  The proportion of the population that is **vaccinated** is $p_v$. The vaccine is not perfectly effective. The vaccine efficacy, $VE$, is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are successfully protected from infection. Consequently, the proportion of vaccinated individuals who remain susceptible despite vaccination (i.e., vaccine failures) is $1 - VE$.\n    The contribution of this group to the total susceptible proportion is the fraction of people who are vaccinated multiplied by the fraction of those vaccinations that fail to confer protection: $p_v \\cdot (1 - VE)$.\n\nThe total proportion of susceptible individuals, $s$, is the sum of the susceptible proportions from both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated groups:\n$$s = (1 - p_v) + p_v \\cdot (1 - VE)$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression algebraically to see an equivalent form:\n$$s = 1 - p_v + p_v - p_v \\cdot VE = 1 - p_v \\cdot VE$$\nThis second form shows that the susceptible proportion is $1$ minus the proportion of the total population that is successfully immunized by the vaccine, which is $p_v \\cdot VE$. We will proceed with the first expression as it more explicitly builds from the subpopulations.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the expression for $s$:\n$p_v = 0.88$\n$VE = 0.93$\n\n$$s = (1 - 0.88) + 0.88 \\cdot (1 - 0.93)$$\n$$s = 0.12 + 0.88 \\cdot (0.07)$$\n$$s = 0.12 + 0.0616$$\n$$s = 0.1816$$\n\nSo, the proportion of the population susceptible to measles is $0.1816$, or $18.16\\%$.\n\nNext, we compute the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, using the given basic reproduction number for measles, $R_0 = 15$.\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\n$$R_e = 15 \\cdot 0.1816$$\n$$R_e = 2.724$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R_e \\approx 2.72$$\n\nFinally, we must assess whether herd immunity is achieved and comment on the outbreak potential. Herd immunity is achieved when the effective reproduction number is less than $1$, i.e., $R_e  1$. This condition ensures that, on average, an infected individual transmits the infection to less than one other person, causing the outbreak to die out.\n\nIn this community, the calculated effective reproduction number is $R_e \\approx 2.72$. Since $R_e  1$, herd immunity has not been achieved. With an effective reproduction number significantly greater than $1$, the introduction of a measles case into this community would be expected to lead to sustained community transmission and a significant outbreak, as each case generates an average of $2.72$ new cases.",
