By working through this scenario, you will learn how to aggregate ward-level data to calculate a hospital-wide rate and evaluate the impact of a stewardship intervention, a core skill for hospital epidemiology and quality improvement .",

            "problem": "A tertiary care hospital is evaluating the effect of a newly implemented antimicrobial stewardship intervention that combines prospective audit with feedback and bedside prescriber engagement. Over the prior year, the hospitalwide Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days was consistently $650$. In the first full month after implementation, the stewardship team compiles ward-level counts of antibiotic exposure and census. The three largest wards report the following monthly totals: Adult Medicine: $1600$ antibiotic days and $3400$ patient-days; Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU): $1200$ antibiotic days and $1800$ patient-days; Pediatrics: $2400$ antibiotic days and $4800$ patient-days. For surveillance and benchmarking, epidemiology programs use DOT per $1000$ patient-days as a rate measure that normalizes antibiotic exposure by census. Using the standard epidemiologic definition of Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days, compute the hospitalwide DOT for the post-intervention month by aggregating across wards, and then, relative to the baseline value of $650$, compute the fractional reduction attributable to the intervention. Round your final fractional reduction to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a decimal (no percent sign).",
            "solution": "The primary metric is the Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days, which we will denote as $R$. This rate is defined as the total number of days a patient receives at least one dose of an antibiotic (antibiotic days, $D$) divided by the total number of days patients were in the hospital (patient-days, $P$), normalized by a factor of $1000$. The formula is:\n$$R = \\left( \\frac{D}{P} \\right) \\times 1000$$\n\nThe problem provides the baseline (pre-intervention) hospitalwide rate, which we denote as $R_{pre}$:\n$$R_{pre} = 650 \\text{ DOT per 1000 patient-days}$$\n\nAfter the intervention, data are provided for three specific hospital wards:\n1. Adult Medicine: $D_{med} = 1600$ antibiotic days, $P_{med} = 3400$ patient-days.\n2. Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU): $D_{ICU} = 1200$ antibiotic days, $P_{ICU} = 1800$ patient-days.\n3. Pediatrics: $D_{peds} = 2400$ antibiotic days, $P_{peds} = 4800$ patient-days.\n\nTo compute the post-intervention hospitalwide DOT, we must first aggregate the data across all provided wards. The total antibiotic days, $D_{total}$, is the sum of the antibiotic days from each ward.\n$$D_{total} = D_{med} + D_{ICU} + D_{peds}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{total} = 1600 + 1200 + 2400 = 5200 \\text{ antibiotic days}$$\n\nSimilarly, the total patient-days, $P_{total}$, is the sum of the patient-days from each ward.\n$$P_{total} = P_{med} + P_{ICU} + P_{peds}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{total} = 3400 + 1800 + 4800 = 10000 \\text{ patient-days}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the post-intervention hospitalwide DOT rate, $R_{post}$, using these aggregated totals.\n$$R_{post} = \\left( \\frac{D_{total}}{P_{total}} \\right) \\times 1000$$\n$$R_{post} = \\left( \\frac{5200}{10000} \\right) \\times 1000 = 0.52 \\times 1000 = 520 \\text{ DOT per 1000 patient-days}$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the fractional reduction, $F$, attributable to the intervention. The fractional reduction is the change in the rate divided by the original (baseline) rate.\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{Change in rate}}{\\text{Original rate}} = \\frac{R_{pre} - R_{post}}{R_{pre}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $R_{pre}$ and $R_{post}$:\n$$F = \\frac{650 - 520}{650} = \\frac{130}{650}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$F = \\frac{13}{65} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact decimal value is $0.2$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$F = 0.2000$$\nThis represents the fractional reduction in antimicrobial use.",

            "introduction": "Effective stewardship requires not only tracking antibiotic use but also making smarter decisions for individual patients, a practice known as diagnostic stewardship. This exercise uses Bayes' theorem to demonstrate how to properly interpret the result of a modern diagnostic test, like a rapid PCR, in the context of your clinical suspicion. Mastering this allows you to quantify how a test result should change your certainty of infection, moving beyond a simple \"positive\" or \"negative\" to a more nuanced, evidence-based clinical judgment .",

The rapid test has sensitivity $0.95$ and specificity $0.98$. In a cohort of patients with compatible clinical syndromes and epidemiologic risk, the clinical team estimates the pretest probability (prior probability) of true infection with the target pathogen as $0.20$. A patient from this cohort returns a positive result on the rapid PCR.\n\nStarting from the definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities, and using Bayes’ theorem and the law of total probability as foundational principles, derive the expression for the post-test probability of true infection given a positive test. Then compute its value for the parameters above.\n\nReport your final numeric answer as a decimal between $0$ and $1$, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "Let $I$ be the event that a patient has the true infection, and let $I^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have the infection. Let $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The pre-test probability of infection is the prior probability, $P(I) = 0.20$.\n- The probability of not being infected is therefore $P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient is infected: $P(T^+ | I) = 0.95$.\n- Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient is not infected: $P(T^- | I^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result given that the patient is not infected (the false positive rate). This is the complement of specificity:\n$$ P(T^+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T^- | I^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 $$\n\nThe goal is to find the post-test probability of true infection given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(I | T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability $P(I | T^+)$ to its inverse $P(T^+ | I)$:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated for the entire cohort by applying the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the patient is infected and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient is not infected but tests positive).\nThe law of total probability allows us to expand $P(T^+)$ as follows:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap I) + P(T^+ \\cap I^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expansion for $P(T^+)$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem. This yields the full expression for the post-test probability, derived from the foundational principles as required:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c)} $$\nThis expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is composed entirely of the quantities defined at the outset: sensitivity, specificity (via its complement), and pre-test probability.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression:\n- $P(T^+ | I) = 0.95$\n- $P(I) = 0.20$\n- $P(T^+ | I^c) = 0.02$\n- $P(I^c) = 0.80$\n\nThe numerator represents the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$ P(T^+ | I) P(I) = (0.95) \\times (0.20) = 0.19 $$\n\nThe denominator's second term represents the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$ P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c) = (0.02) \\times (0.80) = 0.016 $$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.19 + 0.016 = 0.206 $$\n\nFinally, the post-test probability of infection is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total positive probability:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{0.19}{0.206} $$\n$$ P(I | T^+) \\approx 0.922330097... $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get $0.9223$.",

This practice delves into the pharmacodynamics of time-dependent antibiotics, such as the widely used beta-lactams, by calculating the duration the drug concentration remains above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). This calculation illustrates how fundamental pharmacokinetic properties like drug half-life directly inform the effectiveness of a chosen dosing schedule against a target pathogen .",

Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent killing, and an important target is the time that the free plasma concentration remains above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Assume a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. Immediately after each dose, the plasma concentration instantaneously reaches a peak value of $C_{0}=20$ mg/L. The elimination half-life is $t_{1/2}=2$ hours, and the pathogen has $MIC=4$ mg/L. Define $TMIC$ as the duration (in hours) within a single dosing interval $[0,\\tau]$ for which the concentration is at or above $MIC$. Using only fundamental pharmacokinetic principles of first-order elimination and the definition of half-life, compute $TMIC$ for a single dosing interval of $\\tau=6$ hours. Express your answer in hours and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The concentration of the drug in the plasma, $C(t)$, at a time $t$ after the dose is administered follows first-order elimination kinetics, described by the equation:\n    $$C(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-k_{e} t)$$\n    where $C_{0}$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$ and $k_{e}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\n    The problem provides the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, which is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease by half. We can use this definition to find the relationship between $t_{1/2}$ and $k_{e}$. At $t = t_{1/2}$, the concentration is $C(t_{1/2}) = C_{0}/2$.\n    $$ \\frac{C_{0}}{2} = C_{0} \\exp(-k_{e} t_{1/2}) $$\n    Dividing by $C_{0}$ gives:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{e} t_{1/2}) $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{e} t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ -\\ln(2) = -k_{e} t_{1/2} $$\n    Solving for $k_{e}$ yields:\n    $$ k_{e} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\n    Using the given value $t_{1/2} = 2$ hours, the elimination rate constant is:\n    $$ k_{e} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2} \\text{ hours}^{-1} $$\n    The parameter of interest, $TMIC$, is the duration for which the drug concentration $C(t)$ is greater than or equal to the $MIC$.

Let this time be $t_{MIC}$.\n    $$ MIC = C(t_{MIC}) = C_{0} \\exp(-k_{e} t_{MIC}) $$\n    Since the concentration starts above the $MIC$ (as $C_{0} = 20 \\text{ mg/L}  MIC = 4 \\text{ mg/L}$) and decreases monotonically, the time the concentration is above the $MIC$ is precisely this value $t_{MIC}$.
