In real-world cohort studies, this is complicated by participants entering the study at different times and leaving due to the event of interest, loss to follow-up, or the study's end.

            "problem": "A prospective cohort is established to study the incidence of a health outcome. Participants enter the risk set at their first eligible observation time and contribute person-time until the earliest of outcome occurrence, loss to follow-up (LTFU), or administrative censoring. Using the conceptual framework in which person-time is the accumulated duration that each participant remains a member of the risk set, compute the total person-time contributed by the cohort under staggered entry and multiple exit mechanisms.\n\nThe cohort start is at time $t=0$ months, and the administrative censoring time is $T_{c}=36$ months. For each participant $P_{i}$, the entry time $E_{i}$ and exit time $X_{i}$ (with exit reason) are given in months since cohort start:\n\n- Participant $P_{1}$: $E_{1}=0$; outcome event at $X_{1}=20$.\n- Participant $P_{2}$: $E_{2}=6$; LTFU at $X_{2}=22$.\n- Participant $P_{3}$: $E_{3}=12$; no event by $X_{3}=40$ (remains under observation until administrative censoring).\n- Participant $P_{4}$: $E_{4}=18$; outcome event at $X_{4}=33$.\n- Participant $P_{5}$: $E_{5}=24$; LTFU at $X_{5}=30$.\n\nAssume that no participant experiences the outcome before entry and that person-time accrues only while a participant is in the risk set.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of total person-time for a cohort of five participants in a prospective study. The fundamental principle is that person-time is the sum of the durations each individual participant remains at risk for the outcome. The period at risk for each participant begins at their entry time and ends at the earliest of three possible events: occurrence of the health outcome, loss to follow-up (LTFU), or administrative censoring.\n\nThe given parameters are the administrative censoring time $T_c = 36$ months, and for each participant $i$, an entry time $E_i$ and an exit time $X_i$ with an associated reason. The per-participant contribution to person-time, denoted $PT_i$, is the time interval between their entry into the risk set and their exit from it.\n\nThe starting point of the observation interval for participant $i$ is their entry time, $E_i$.\nThe end point of the observation interval for participant $i$, which we can denote $t_{end, i}$, is determined by the minimum of their specified exit time $X_i$ (due to an event or LTFU) and the administrative censoring time $T_c$. This is because a participant's contribution to person-time cannot extend beyond the end of the study at $T_c$.\n\nThe formula for the person-time contribution of participant $i$ is therefore:\n$$PT_i = t_{end, i} - E_i = \\min(X_i, T_c) - E_i$$\n\nWe will apply this formula to each participant.\n\nParticipant $P_1$:\nEntry time $E_1 = 0$ months.\nExit due to an outcome event at $X_1 = 20$ months.\nThe end of follow-up is $\\min(X_1, T_c) = \\min(20, 36) = 20$ months.\nThe person-time for $P_1$ is:\n$$PT_1 = 20 - 0 = 20 \\text{ months}$$\n\nParticipant $P_2$:\nEntry time $E_2 = 6$ months.\nExit due to LTFU at $X_2 = 22$ months.\nThe end of follow-up is $\\min(X_2, T_c) = \\min(22, 36) = 22$ months.\nThe person-time for $P_2$ is:\n$$PT_2 = 22 - 6 = 16 \\text{ months}$$\n\nParticipant $P_3$:\nEntry time $E_3 = 12$ months.\nThis participant had no event and was still under observation at $X_3 = 40$ months. However, the study concludes at the administrative censoring time $T_c = 36$ months. Therefore, this participant is administratively censored at $T_c$.\nThe end of follow-up is $\\min(X_3, T_c) = \\min(40, 36) = 36$ months.\nThe person-time for $P_3$ is:\n$$PT_3 = 36 - 12 = 24 \\text{ months}$$\n\nParticipant $P_4$:\nEntry time $E_4 = 18$ months.\nExit due to an outcome event at $X_4 = 33$ months.\nThe end of follow-up is $\\min(X_4, T_c) = \\min(33, 36) = 33$ months.\nThe person-time for $P_4$ is:\n$$PT_4 = 33 - 18 = 15 \\text{ months}$$\n\nParticipant $P_5$:\nEntry time $E_5 = 24$ months.\nExit due to LTFU at $X_5 = 30$ months.\nThe end of follow-up is $\\min(X_5, T_c) = \\min(30, 36) = 30$ months.\nThe person-time for $P_5$ is:\n$$PT_5 = 30 - 24 = 6 \\text{ months}$$\n\nThe total person-time for the cohort in months, $PT_{\\text{total, months}}$, is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$PT_{\\text{total, months}} = PT_1 + PT_2 + PT_3 + PT_4 + PT_5$$\n$$PT_{\\text{total, months}} = 20 + 16 + 24 + 15 + 6 = 81 \\text{ person-months}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed in person-years.

A common conceptual error is to continue counting person-time after a non-recurrent event has occurred, even though the individual is no longer at risk.

            "problem": "A cohort study in preventive medicine is assembled to estimate the incidence rate of a non-recurrent clinical event (for example, a first myocardial infarction). By design, each participant is intended to be observed for up to $24$ months ($2$ years). The fundamental definition to use is that the incidence rate is the ratio of the number of incident events to the total person-time at risk. A person contributes person-time only while at risk; after a non-recurrent event they are no longer at risk for another occurrence of the same event.\n\nEight participants are observed with the following outcomes and follow-up patterns (times are exact):\n- Participant $\\mathrm{A}$: event at $3$ months; remains under observation to $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{B}$: event at $9$ months; remains under observation to $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{C}$: event at $18$ months; remains under observation to $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{D}$: no event; observed for $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{E}$: event at $1$ month; remains under observation to $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{F}$: no event; lost to follow-up at $12$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{G}$: event at $20$ months; remains under observation to $24$ months.\n- Participant $\\mathrm{H}$: no event; observed for $24$ months.\n\nSuppose an analyst mistakenly includes all observed time, including time after the non-recurrent event, in the denominator for person-time when computing the incidence rate. Using only the core definition of incidence rate and the fact that person-time accrues only while at risk (the post-event time does not accrue for a non-recurrent outcome), compute the proportional underestimation caused by this mistake. The proportional underestimation is the fraction by which the erroneously computed incidence rate is lower than the correctly computed incidence rate.\n\nConvert months to years (using $12$ months $=$ $1$ year) when summing person-time.

            "solution": "The objective is to compute the proportional underestimation of an incidence rate due to an error in calculating the total person-time at risk. The proportional underestimation, denoted as $PU$, is the fraction by which the erroneously computed rate is lower than the correctly computed rate. It is defined as:\n$$\nPU = \\frac{IR_{correct} - IR_{erroneous}}{IR_{correct}}\n$$\nwhere $IR_{correct}$ is the correct incidence rate and $IR_{erroneous}$ is the erroneous rate.\n\nThe incidence rate, $IR$, is defined as the number of new events, $N_{events}$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n$$\nIR = \\frac{N_{events}}{PT}\n$$\nThus, we can write the correct and erroneous rates as:\n$$\nIR_{correct} = \\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{correct}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad IR_{erroneous} = \\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{erroneous}}\n$$\nThe numerator, $N_{events}$, is the same in both calculations because the error is only in the denominator. Substituting these expressions into the formula for $PU$ gives:\n$$\nPU = \\frac{\\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{correct}} - \\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{erroneous}}}{\\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{correct}}} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{erroneous}}}{\\frac{N_{events}}{PT_{correct}}} = 1 - \\frac{PT_{correct}}{PT_{erroneous}}\n$$\nThis simplified expression shows that the proportional underestimation depends only on the ratio of the correct to the erroneous person-time. We can perform the calculations using person-months.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of incident events, $N_{events}$. Based on the provided data, participants $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{B}$, $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{E}$, and $\\mathrm{G}$ experienced the event.\n$$\nN_{events} = 5\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the correct total person-time at risk, $PT_{correct}$. A person contributes time to this total only while they are at risk.
