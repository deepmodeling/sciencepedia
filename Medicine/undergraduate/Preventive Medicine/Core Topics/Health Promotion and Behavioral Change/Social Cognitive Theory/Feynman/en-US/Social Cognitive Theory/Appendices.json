            "problem": "A preventive medicine program implements weekly sessions designed to improve participants' self-efficacy for engaging in regular physical activity. According to Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), self-efficacy is influenced by mastery experiences, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and physiological states, and changes arise through triadic reciprocal determinism among personal factors, behavior, and environment. Consider a participant whose self-efficacy, denoted by $E_t$, is measured once per week and scaled to the interval $[0,1]$, where $E_t = 1$ represents full confidence and $E_t = 0$ represents no confidence.\n\nAssume the following modeling principle derived from core SCT constructs and standard behavioral change modeling: under a constant weekly intervention environment, the weekly change in self-efficacy is proportional to its remaining “headroom” to full confidence. That is, the incremental effect per week is proportional to $1 - E_t$ with proportionality parameter $k$ that captures the strength of weekly mastery reinforcement and vicarious experience in a stable program. Use this principle to derive a first-order linear recurrence for $E_t$, then solve it in closed form.\n\nFor a participant with initial self-efficacy $E_0 = 0.4$ and a weekly proportionality parameter $k = 0.1$, compute the self-efficacy after $8$ weeks, $E_8$. Round your answer to four significant figures and express it as a decimal without a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and solution of a first-order linear recurrence relation to model the change in a participant's self-efficacy, $E_t$, over time. The model is based on a principle derived from Social Cognitive Theory.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  Self-efficacy at week $t$ is denoted by $E_t$, scaled to the interval $[0, 1]$.\n2.  The weekly change in self-efficacy, $E_{t+1} - E_t$, is proportional to the \"headroom\" to full confidence, which is $1 - E_t$.\n3.  The proportionality parameter is $k$.\n4.  The initial self-efficacy is $E_0 = 0.4$.\n5.  The proportionality parameter is $k = 0.1$.\n6.  The task is to compute $E_8$ and round the result to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded as a simplified mathematical model of a behavioral theory concept. It is a common approach in quantitative psychology and behavioral science to use first-order linear models to approximate dynamic processes. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to derive and solve the model. The parameters are physically realistic within the model's context. The problem is objective and contains no contradictory information. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core modeling principle states that the change in self-efficacy from week $t$ to week $t+1$ is proportional to the difference between the maximum possible efficacy ($1$) and the current efficacy ($E_t$). We can write this relationship mathematically. The change in self-efficacy is $\\Delta E_t = E_{t+1} - E_t$. The \"headroom\" is $1 - E_t$. The proportionality is expressed as:\n$$E_{t+1} - E_t = k(1 - E_t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the proportionality constant. This is a first-order linear recurrence relation. We can rearrange it to express $E_{t+1}$ explicitly in terms of $E_t$:\n$$E_{t+1} = E_t + k(1 - E_t)$$\n$$E_{t+1} = E_t - k E_t + k$$\n$$E_{t+1} = (1-k)E_t + k$$\nThis is the recurrence relation for $E_t$. It is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation of the form $x_{n+1} = a x_n + b$, with $a = 1-k$ and $b=k$.\n\nTo find a closed-form solution for $E_t$, we first find the fixed point (or equilibrium state) $E^*$ of the recurrence. The fixed point is the value of $E_t$ for which $E_{t+1} = E_t = E^*$.\n$$E^* = (1-k)E^* + k$$\n$$E^* - (1-k)E^* = k$$\n$$E^*(1 - (1-k)) = k$$\n$$E^*k = k$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 0$, the fixed point is $E^* = 1$. This means that as $t \\to \\infty$, the self-efficacy approaches full confidence, which is consistent with the model's premise of continuous improvement.\n\nNow, we define a new variable, $D_t$, as the difference between the self-efficacy at time $t$ and the fixed point: $D_t = E_t - E^* = E_t - 1$. We can express the recurrence in terms of $D_t$:\n$$D_{t+1} = E_{t+1} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{t+1}$:\n$$D_{t+1} = \\left( (1-k)E_t + k \\right) - 1$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)E_t - (1-k)$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)(E_t - 1)$$\nSince $D_t = E_t - 1$, we have:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)D_t$$\nThis is a simple geometric progression. The solution is $D_t = D_0 (1-k)^t$.\nSubstituting back $D_t = E_t - 1$ and $D_0 = E_0 - 1$, we get:\n$$E_t - 1 = (E_0 - 1)(1-k)^t$$\nSolving for $E_t$ gives the closed-form solution:\n$$E_t = 1 + (E_0 - 1)(1-k)^t$$\n$$E_t = 1 - (1-E_0)(1-k)^t$$\n\nThe problem provides the specific values $E_0 = 0.4$ and $k=0.1$. We are asked to compute the self-efficacy after $8$ weeks, which corresponds to $t=8$.\nWe substitute these values into the closed-form solution:\n$$E_8 = 1 - (1 - 0.4)(1 - 0.1)^8$$\n$$E_8 = 1 - (0.6)(0.9)^8$$\nNow, we must compute the value of $(0.9)^8$:\n$$(0.9)^2 = 0.81$$\n$$(0.9)^4 = (0.81)^2 = 0.6561$$\n$$(0.9)^8 = (0.6561)^2 = 0.43046721$$\nNext, substitute this value back into the expression for $E_8$:\n$$E_8 = 1 - 0.6 \\times 0.43046721$$\n$$E_8 = 1 - 0.258280326$$\n$$E_8 = 0.741719674$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $7$ (in the tenths place). The first four significant figures are $7, 4, 1, 7$. The fifth significant digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\n$$E_8 \\approx 0.7417$$",

            "problem": "A public health department is designing a program to increase uptake of at-home colorectal cancer screening using the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). The team is choosing between two interventions: (i) a Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) package that uses peer modeling videos and mastery-based coaching to increase perceived capability and vicarious learning; and (ii) a choice-architecture nudge that mails a kit by default, schedules a return pickup unless the person opts out, and removes extraneous steps. The department wants to decide which intervention better fits each subpopulation and to articulate the mechanism by which each intervention operates.\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) posits that behavior is shaped by reciprocal determinism among personal cognitive factors (for example, self-efficacy), behavioral capabilities, and environmental influences (for example, observational learning). Self-efficacy is the conviction that one can execute the behavior required to produce desired outcomes; observational learning creates vicarious reinforcement and guides performance via modeling; outcome expectancies represent anticipated benefits; and perceived barriers act as costs. \n- In behavioral decision making, a person initiates a preventive behavior when the net drive to act exceeds the status quo. Let the net drive be a monotone function of expected benefits minus costs, modulated by attention and default bias. A simple representation is that action is expected when a composite index $G$ satisfies $G > 0$, where\n$G = O \\cdot E - (B + c) + \\alpha M + \\delta D$,\nwith $O$ as outcome expectancy, $E$ as self-efficacy, $B$ as perceived structural barriers, $c$ as frictional hassle costs, $M$ as exposure to credible peer modeling, and $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ as whether the action is the default. The parameters $ \\alpha $ and $ \\delta $ capture the marginal influence of modeling and default status, respectively. This index is intended to reflect well-tested facts: higher $E$ and $M$ increase the likelihood of initiation in SCT; default status and reduced friction increase initiation through choice architecture.\n\nTwo subpopulations are characterized as follows, with common parameters $ \\alpha = 0.5 $ and $ \\delta = 0.05 $:\n\n- Subpopulation $X$ (low capability, high barriers): $O_X = 0.8$, $E_X = 0.3$, $B_X = 0.5$, $c_X = 0.3$, $M_X = 0.6$, $D_X = 0$. The SCT package increases self-efficacy and modeling exposure by $ \\Delta E_X = 0.4 $ and $ \\Delta M_X = 0.2 $. The nudge reduces friction by $ \\Delta c_X = -0.2 $ and sets the action as the default so $D_X' = 1$.\n- Subpopulation $Y$ (adequate capability, high friction/forgetfulness): $O_Y = 0.8$, $E_Y = 0.7$, $B_Y = 0.2$, $c_Y = 0.4$, $M_Y = 0.3$, $D_Y = 0$. The SCT package increases $ \\Delta E_Y = 0.1 $ and $ \\Delta M_Y = 0.1 $. The nudge reduces friction by $ \\Delta c_Y = -0.3 $ and sets $D_Y' = 1$.\n\nBased on these definitions and data, which option best differentiates the mechanisms and correctly identifies when each intervention is expected to drive preventive behavior change?\n\nA. In subpopulation $X$, the SCT package should outperform the nudge because increasing $E$ and $M$ addresses the primary barrier of low perceived capability; in subpopulation $Y$, the nudge should outperform the SCT package because defaults and friction reduction address present-bias and hassle when $E$ is already adequate.\n\nB. Nudges will outperform the SCT package in both subpopulations because defaults always guarantee action regardless of $E$, $M$, or $B$.\n\nC. The SCT package will outperform nudges in both subpopulations because observational learning is inherently stronger than changes in choice architecture.\n\nD. In subpopulation $X$, the nudge should outperform the SCT package because defaults reduce barriers; in subpopulation $Y$, the SCT package should outperform the nudge because increasing $E$ matters more than friction.\n\nE. Both interventions primarily operate by increasing $O$, so their effectiveness is the same across subpopulations.",
