This process is famously visualized by the Stephan curve, which models the rapid drop in pH into a demineralizing zone and the subsequent slow recovery buffered by saliva.

            "problem": "A patient performs a single oral rinse with $10$ g sucrose, leading to an acidogenic challenge in dental plaque. In preventive medicine, the time that plaque acidity remains below the critical threshold for hydroxyapatite dissolution is a proxy for demineralization risk. Assume the following simplified Stephan curve model for plaque acidity ($\\mathrm{pH}$) after the rinse, based on well-tested observations of plaque response:\n- Baseline plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $7.0$ at time $t=0$ minutes.\n- The plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ declines approximately linearly to a nadir at $\\mathrm{pH}=4.8$ at $t=5$ minutes.\n- After $t=5$ minutes, recovery toward baseline follows first-order kinetics governed by salivary buffering, so that the $\\mathrm{pH}$ approaches $7.0$ exponentially with time constant $\\tau=20$ minutes.\n\nUse the critical threshold $\\mathrm{pH}=5.5$ for net enamel demineralization and model the plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ piecewise as follows:\n- For $0 \\leq t \\leq 5$, let $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$ be a linear interpolation between $7.0$ at $t=0$ and $4.8$ at $t=5$.\n- For $t \\geq 5$, let $\\mathrm{pH}(t)=7.0 - \\Delta \\exp\\!\\big(-(t-5)/\\tau\\big)$, where $\\Delta$ is the drop from baseline at $t=5$ and $\\tau=20$ minutes.\n\nStarting from these definitions and first-order kinetics for recovery, derive and compute the total duration during which $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$ is strictly below $5.5$ following the rinse.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated by first extracting the given information and then assessing its scientific grounding, well-posedness, and objectivity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A patient performs a single oral rinse with $10$ g sucrose.\n- Baseline plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $7.0$ at time $t=0$ minutes.\n- Plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ declines linearly to a nadir of $\\mathrm{pH}=4.8$ at $t=5$ minutes.\n- For $t \\geq 5$ minutes, plaque $\\mathrm{pH}$ recovery follows first-order kinetics approaching $7.0$ with a time constant $\\tau=20$ minutes.\n- The critical threshold for net enamel demineralization is $\\mathrm{pH}=5.5$.\n- Model for plaque acidity, $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$:\n  - For $0 \\leq t \\leq 5$, $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$ is a linear interpolation between $7.0$ at $t=0$ and $4.8$ at $t=5$.\n  - For $t \\geq 5$, $\\mathrm{pH}(t)=7.0 - \\Delta \\exp\\!\\big(-(t-5)/\\tau\\big)$, where $\\Delta$ is the drop from baseline at $t=5$ and $\\tau=20$ minutes.\n- The task is to compute the total duration during which $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$ is strictly below $5.5$.\n- The final answer should be in minutes, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a simplified Stephan curve, a standard concept in cariology used to model the change in plaque pH after a sucrose challenge. The given values for baseline pH ($7.0$), pH nadir ($4.8$), recovery time, and the critical pH for enamel demineralization ($5.5$) are all well-established and consistent with clinical and experimental data in preventive dentistry. The model, employing a linear decrease followed by an exponential recovery (first-order kinetics), is a legitimate and common simplification for such a biological system. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The piecewise function for $\\mathrm{pH}(t)$ is explicitly defined, and all necessary parameters are provided. The question asks for the total time duration for which $\\mathrm{pH}(t)  5.5$, which is a clearly defined mathematical task leading to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution requires finding the total time interval during which the plaque acidity is below the critical threshold of $\\mathrm{pH}=5.5$. We must analyze the two phases of the $\\mathrm{pH}$ curve as defined.\n\n**Phase 1: Linear pH decline ($0 \\leq t \\leq 5$ minutes)**\n\nThe pH is modeled as a linear function of time $t$ between the points $(t_0, \\mathrm{pH}_0) = (0, 7.0)$ and $(t_n, \\mathrm{pH}_n) = (5, 4.8)$. The equation for this line is:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}(t) = \\mathrm{pH}_0 + \\frac{\\mathrm{pH}_n - \\mathrm{pH}_0}{t_n - t_0} (t - t_0) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}(t) = 7.0 + \\frac{4.8 - 7.0}{5 - 0} (t - 0) = 7.0 - \\frac{2.2}{5} t = 7.0 - 0.44t $$\nWe need to find the time $t_1$ at which the pH first drops to the critical value of $5.5$.\n$$ 5.5 = 7.0 - 0.44t_1 $$\n$$ 0.44t_1 = 7.0 - 5.5 $$\n$$ 0.44t_1 = 1.5 $$\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{1.5}{0.44} = \\frac{150}{44} = \\frac{75}{22} \\text{ minutes} $$\nSince at $t=5$ minutes, $\\mathrm{pH}(5)=4.8$, which is less than $5.5$, the pH is below the critical threshold for the entire interval from $t_1$ to $t=5$. The duration of this first period is:\n$$ D_1 = 5 - t_1 = 5 - \\frac{75}{22} = \\frac{110 - 75}{22} = \\frac{35}{22} \\text{ minutes} $$\n\n**Phase 2: Exponential pH recovery ($t \\geq 5$ minutes)**\n\nFor $t \\geq 5$, the pH is modeled by the equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}(t) = 7.0 - \\Delta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-5}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe parameter $\\Delta$ is the drop from the baseline pH ($7.0$) to the nadir pH ($4.8$) at $t=5$.\n$$ \\Delta = 7.0 - 4.8 = 2.2 $$\nThe time constant is given as $\\tau = 20$ minutes. So, the equation for this phase is:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}(t) = 7.0 - 2.2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-5}{20}\\right) $$\nWe need to find the time $t_2$ at which the pH recovers back to the critical value of $5.5$.\n$$ 5.5 = 7.0 - 2.2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2-5}{20}\\right) $$\n$$ 2.2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2-5}{20}\\right) = 7.0 - 5.5 $$\n$$ 2.2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2-5}{20}\\right) = 1.5 $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_2-5}{20}\\right) = \\frac{1.5}{2.2} = \\frac{15}{22} $$\nTo solve for $t_2$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{t_2-5}{20} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{22}\\right) $$\n$$ t_2 - 5 = -20 \\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{22}\\right) = 20 \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{15}{22}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = 20 \\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{15}\\right) $$\nThe duration of the second period, during which the pH is below $5.5$, starts at $t=5$ and ends at $t_2$. This duration is:\n$$ D_2 = t_2 - 5 = 20 \\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{15}\\right) \\text{ minutes} $$\n\n**Total Duration**\n\nThe total duration $D_{total}$ during which the plaque pH is strictly below $5.5$ is the sum of the durations from both phases:\n$$ D_{total} = D_1 + D_2 $$\nThe total time interval is $(t_1, t_2)$, so the duration is also $t_2 - t_1$. Let's verify this using $D_1$ and $D_2$:\n$$ D_{total} = (5 - t_1) + (t_2 - 5) = t_2 - t_1 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D_1$ and $D_2$:\n$$ D_{total} = \\frac{35}{22} + 20 \\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{15}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$$ \\frac{35}{22} \\approx 1.590909... $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{15}\\right) \\approx \\ln(1.466666...) \\approx 0.3829916... $$\n$$ D_{total} \\approx 1.590909... + 20 \\times (0.3829916...) $$\n$$ D_{total} \\approx 1.590909... + 7.659832... $$\n$$ D_{total} \\approx 9.250741... \\text{ minutes} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ D_{total} \\approx 9.251 \\text{ minutes} $$\nThis is the total duration that the enamel is at risk of demineralization.",

The assumptions of homogeneity and uniform distribution are explicitly stated, which is necessary for the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the mass of fluoride, $m_F$, that remains intra-orally after brushing. This mass is the product of the mass of toothpaste retained in the mouth, $m_{TP, retained}$, and the mass fraction of fluoride in the toothpaste.\n\nFirst, we determine the mass of toothpaste retained. The initial mass of the toothpaste application is $m_{TP} = 1.0$ g. The retention fraction is given as $R = 30\\%$, which is equivalent to a dimensionless factor of $0.30$.\nThe mass of toothpaste retained is:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = R \\times m_{TP}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = 0.30 \\times 1.0 \\text{ g} = 0.30 \\text{ g}$$\n\nNext, we address the fluoride concentration, $C_F$. The problem states the concentration is $1450$ ppm by mass and requires the use of the definition $1 \\text{ ppm} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mg solute}}{1 \\text{ kg mixture}}$.\nTherefore, a concentration of $1450$ ppm fluoride is equivalent to:\n$$C_F = 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}}{\\text{kg toothpaste}}$$\nThe mass of fluoride, $m_F$, in a given mass of toothpaste, $m_{TP, retained}$, is calculated by multiplying the mass of the toothpaste by its fluoride concentration. For this calculation to be dimensionally consistent, the mass of the toothpaste must be expressed in kilograms (kg) to match the units of the concentration term.\n\nWe convert the mass of retained toothpaste from grams (g) to kilograms (kg), knowing that $1 \\text{ kg} = 1000 \\text{ g}$:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = 0.30 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ kg}}{1000 \\text{ g}} = 0.00030 \\text{ kg} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of fluoride delivered, $m_{F, delivered}$, which is the mass of fluoride present in the retained toothpaste:\n$$m_{F, delivered} = C_F \\times m_{TP, retained}$$\nSubstituting the values for concentration and retained mass:\n$$m_{F, delivered} = \\left( 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}}{\\text{kg toothpaste}} \\right) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg toothpaste})$$\nThe unit of 'kg toothpaste' cancels, leaving the result in milligrams (mg) of fluoride, as required.\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 1450 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 4350 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 0.435 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.435$ already has three significant figures (the digits $4$, $3$, and $5$).\n\nThus, the fluoride dose delivered per brushing under the specified conditions is $0.435$ mg.",

The problem provides:\n$$CI_{unsealed} = 12\\% = 0.12$$\nThe efficacy, $E$, is given as $60\\%$, or $0.60$. Efficacy is defined as the proportional reduction in cumulative incidence in the treated group relative to the control group. This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$E = \\frac{CI_{unsealed} - CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}}$$\nThis quantity is also known as the Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$). We can use this relationship to find the cumulative incidence in the sealed group, $CI_{sealed}$.\n$$E = 1 - \\frac{CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}}$$\nRearranging for $CI_{sealed}$:\n$$\\frac{CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}} = 1 - E$$\n$$CI_{sealed} = CI_{unsealed} \\times (1 - E)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$CI_{sealed} = 0.12 \\times (1 - 0.60) = 0.12 \\times 0.40 = 0.048$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the absolute difference in the risk (cumulative incidence) between the control and intervention groups.\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} - CI_{sealed}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $CI_{sealed}$:\n$$ARR = 0.12 - 0.048 = 0.072$$\nAlternatively, by substituting the expression for $CI_{sealed}$ into the $ARR$ formula, we can express $ARR$ in terms of $CI_{unsealed}$ and $E$:\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} - (CI_{unsealed} \\times (1 - E)) = CI_{unsealed} - CI_{unsealed} + (CI_{unsealed} \\times E)$$\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} \\times E$$\nUsing this direct formula:\n$$ARR = 0.12 \\times 0.60 = 0.072$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $0.072$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ARR_{rounded} = 0.0720$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. The problem specifies using the *exact* $ARR$ for this calculation.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the exact value $ARR = 0.072$:\n$$NNT_{exact} = \\frac{1}{0.072} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{72}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{72}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{1000}{72} = \\frac{500}{36} = \\frac{250}{18} = \\frac{125}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $13.888...$\nThe problem requires the $NNT$ to be reported as the least integer greater than or equal to this exact value. This is equivalent to applying the ceiling function.\n$$NNT_{final} = \\lceil NNT_{exact} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{125}{9} \\rceil = \\lceil 13.888... \\rceil = 14$$\nThus, one would need to apply sealants to $14$ children to prevent one case of occlusal caries over a $2$-year period.\n\nThe two requested values are the absolute risk reduction ($0.0720$) and the Number Needed to Treat ($14$).",
