            "introduction": "Accurate growth assessment for infants born preterm is a cornerstone of pediatric preventive care. Because these infants follow a different developmental trajectory, we must first calculate their 'corrected age' to compare them to the appropriate reference standards. This exercise will guide you through this crucial first step, and then have you apply the powerful Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method to calculate a length-for-age z-score, a key indicator of a child's growth status .",

            "problem": "A preterm infant was born at a gestational age of $32$ weeks and presents to clinic at a chronological age of $16$ weeks for growth monitoring. The infant’s recumbent length is measured as $58$ centimeters. Consistent with preventive medicine principles in child health, monitoring should be based on corrected age for preterm infants until at least $104$ weeks ($2$ years). The applicable length-for-age reference at the corrected age provides Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) parameters: $L=-0.1$, $M=60.5$, and $S=0.04$.\n\nUsing the corrected age approach for preterm infants, compute:\n- the corrected age in weeks, and\n- the length-for-age $z$-score using the LMS method with the provided $L$, $M$, and $S$ parameters and the measured length.\n\nRound both the corrected age and the $z$-score to three significant figures. Express the corrected age in weeks and the $z$-score as a decimal. Provide your final answer as two values in the order (corrected age in weeks, $z$-score).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities for a preterm infant: the corrected age and the length-for-age z-score. The solution will proceed in two parts, addressing each calculation systematically.\n\nFirst, we determine the infant's corrected age. The corrected age, also known as adjusted age, is a critical metric in pediatric preventive medicine for assessing the growth of preterm infants. It is calculated by subtracting the duration of prematurity from the infant's chronological age. A standard full-term gestation is considered to be $40$ weeks.\n\nThe degree of prematurity is the difference between the standard full-term gestation and the infant's gestational age at birth. The given data are:\n- Gestational age at birth: $32$ weeks.\n- Chronological age at visit: $16$ weeks.\n\nWe calculate the prematurity as follows:\n$$\n\\text{Prematurity} = (\\text{Full-term gestation}) - (\\text{Gestational age at birth})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Prematurity} = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 32 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\nNext, we use the prematurity to find the corrected age:\n$$\n\\text{Corrected Age} = (\\text{Chronological Age}) - (\\text{Prematurity})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Corrected Age} = 16 \\text{ weeks} - 8 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that this result should be rounded to three significant figures. To express the integer $8$ with three significant figures, we write it as $8.00$. Thus, the corrected age is $8.00$ weeks.\n\nSecond, we compute the length-for-age z-score using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method. The z-score quantifies the deviation of an individual measurement from the population median in units of standard deviation. The formula for the z-score ($Z$) when the box-cox transformation parameter $L$ is not equal to zero is:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1}{L \\cdot S}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $Y$ is the measured value (recumbent length).\n- $L$ (Lambda) is the skewness parameter of the data distribution.\n- $M$ (Mu) is the median value of the measurement in the reference population.\n- $S$ (Sigma) is the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Measured recumbent length, $Y = 58$ cm.\n- LMS parameters: $L = -0.1$, $M = 60.5$ cm, and $S = 0.04$.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{Y}{M}$ is dimensionless because both $Y$ and $M$ are in the same units (cm). We substitute the given values into the z-score formula:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{58}{60.5}\\right)^{-0.1} - 1}{(-0.1) \\cdot (0.04)}\n$$\nWe proceed with the calculation step-by-step. First, the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{Y}{M} = \\frac{58}{60.5} \\approx 0.958677686\n$$\nNext, we raise this ratio to the power of $L$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L \\approx (0.958677686)^{-0.1} \\approx 1.00424570\n$$\nThe numerator of the z-score expression is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1 \\approx 1.00424570 - 1 = 0.00424570\n$$\nThe denominator is the product of $L$ and $S$:\n$$\nL \\cdot S = (-0.1) \\cdot (0.04) = -0.004\n$$\nFinally, we compute the z-score by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{0.00424570}{-0.004} \\approx -1.061425\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the z-score to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $0$, and $6$. Therefore, the z-score is approximately $-1.06$.\n\nIn summary, the corrected age for the infant is $8.00$ weeks, and the corresponding length-for-age z-score is $-1.06$.",

Standardized tools like the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ-3) provide a structured way to screen for potential delays.

            "problem": "A community clinic uses the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition (ASQ-3) in its preventive medicine program for child health, focusing on growth monitoring and developmental screening. In the ASQ-3, each domain has six items scored as follows: a caregiver response of \"Yes\" is scored as $10$ points, \"Sometimes\" is scored as $5$ points, and \"Not yet\" is scored as $0$ points. The domain score is the sum of the six item scores. For decision-making, the clinic defines a child as screening positive for potential delay in a domain if the domain score is strictly less than the domain’s decision threshold for the child’s assessed age.\n\nThe clinic corrects for prematurity until $24$ months using the standard definition: corrected age is obtained by subtracting the number of weeks born early from the chronological age, with $4$ weeks equated to $1$ month for this purpose. To avoid discontinuities between ASQ-3 age-specific forms, the clinic models a continuous decision threshold by linear interpolation between the two bracketing published age-specific cutoffs for that domain.\n\nA child presents for screening at a chronological age of $22$ months and was born at a gestational age of $36$ weeks. The domain being evaluated is Communication. The published cutoffs for the Communication domain are $20.0$ points at $18$ months and $27.0$ points at $24$ months. The caregiver’s responses for the six items in this domain are:\n- Item $1$: \"Yes\"\n- Item $2$: \"Sometimes\"\n- Item $3$: \"Not yet\"\n- Item $4$: \"Sometimes\"\n- Item $5$: \"Yes\"\n- Item $6$: \"Not yet\"\n\nUsing only the core definitions above and the linearity of interpolation, compute:\n$1)$ the corrected age in months, \n$2)$ the interpolated decision threshold at that corrected age, \n$3)$ the domain score, and \n$4)$ whether the child screens positive in this domain (recall that a score strictly less than the threshold indicates a positive screen).\n\nReport as your final answer the margin $M$ in points, defined by $M = S - T$, where $S$ is the domain score and $T$ is the interpolated decision threshold at the corrected age.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds from core definitions of corrected age, ASQ-3 scoring, and linear interpolation.\n\nFirst, compute the corrected age. The child’s chronological age is $22$ months. The child was born at $36$ weeks’ gestation, which is $40 - 36 = 4$ weeks early. Using the standard correction until $24$ months and taking $4$ weeks as $1$ month, the corrected age is:\n$$22 \\text{ months} - \\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{4 \\text{ weeks per month}} = 22 - 1 = 21 \\text{ months}.$$\nHence, the corrected age is $21$ months.\n\nSecond, compute the interpolated decision threshold $T$ at $21$ months by linear interpolation between the published cutoffs at $18$ and $24$ months. Let the cutoff at $18$ months be $C_{18} = 20.0$ points and at $24$ months be $C_{24} = 27.0$ points. Linear interpolation over the interval from $18$ to $24$ months gives:\n$$T = C_{18} + \\frac{21 - 18}{24 - 18}\\left(C_{24} - C_{18}\\right) = 20.0 + \\frac{3}{6}\\left(27.0 - 20.0\\right).$$\nCompute the difference in cutoffs:\n$$27.0 - 20.0 = 7.0.$$\nCompute the fraction:\n$$\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\nThus,\n$$T = 20.0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 7.0 = 20.0 + 3.5 = 23.5.$$\n\nThird, compute the domain score $S$ from the six item responses using the ASQ-3 scoring rules.

The child screens positive for potential delay if $S < T$. Compute the margin $M$:\n$$M = S - T = 30 - 23.5 = 6.5.$$\nSince $M \\ge 0$, equivalently $30 \\ge 23.5$, the child does not screen positive in this domain.\n\nPer the instruction, report the exact value of $M$ in points.
