This exercise uses Bayes' theorem to demonstrate a crucial, often counter-intuitive, statistical reality: the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) of a test is profoundly influenced by the disease prevalence in the tested population.

            "problem": "A primary care network is evaluating a new screening test for an asymptomatic condition associated with substantial risk of overdiagnosis and iatrogenic harm if false positives are treated. In the proposed program, individuals from a low-risk population are tested. Let the pretest probability of disease (equivalently, the prevalence in this tested population) be $\\pi$, the test sensitivity be $Se$, and the test specificity be $Sp$. In this context, the posterior probability of true disease given a positive test result is the positive predictive value (PPV), which, by definition, is the probability that an individual truly has the disease conditional on a positive result. \n\nUsing only the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes' theorem, derive an expression for the posterior probability of disease after a positive test in terms of $\\pi$, $Se$, and $Sp$, and then evaluate it for the following scientifically plausible parameters for a low-prevalence screening context relevant to quaternary prevention: $\\pi = 0.01$, $Se = 0.85$, and $Sp = 0.95$. \n\nReport the posterior probability as a decimal (not a percentage).

In probability notation, this is $P(D|T+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D) P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need to find an expression for the denominator, $P(T+)$, the overall probability of a positive test. We can use the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease status:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) + P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have most of the terms, but we need $P(T+|D^c)$, which is the false positive rate, and $P(D^c)$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n- The false positive rate, $P(T+|D^c)$, is the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual. Since specificity is the probability of a negative test in a disease-free individual, $Sp = P(T-|D^c)$, the false positive rate is its complement: $P(T+|D^c) = 1 - P(T-|D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nNow we substitute these back into the expression for $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expanded denominator back into Bayes' theorem to get the full formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D|T+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe are given the following values:\n- Prevalence: $\\pi = 0.01$\n- Sensitivity: $Se = 0.85$\n- Specificity: $Sp = 0.95$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.01)}{(0.85)(0.01) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.01)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0085}{0.0085 + (0.05)(0.99)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0085}{0.0085 + 0.0495}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0085}{0.058}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.146551724...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the posterior probability of disease is:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1466$$",

Quaternary prevention emphasizes minimizing harm from overmedicalization by quantifying expected harm and redesigning processes to reduce it. Consider the following cascade for an individual with a false positive:\n\n- A non-invasive imaging study is ordered with probability $0.75$, and it produces a disutility of $0.0008$ Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) loss.\n- If imaging is performed, a fine-needle biopsy is recommended with conditional probability $0.40$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general symbolic expression for the expected harm per false positive in a medical cascade and its subsequent numerical evaluation. This is an application of probability theory, specifically the concept of expected value.\n\nLet the set of possible actions that cause harm (disutility) be indexed by $k$, where $k$ represents an action such as imaging, biopsy, etc. For each action $k$, let $H_k$ be the constant value of the disutility, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Let $X_k$ be an indicator random variable such that $X_k=1$ if action $k$ occurs and $X_k=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe total harm, $H_{\\text{total}}$, is a random variable representing the sum of all disutilities from actions that are performed for a given individual with a false positive result. It is defined as:\n$$H_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_k H_k X_k$$\nThe problem asks for the expected harm, which is the expected value of this random variable, $E[H_{\\text{total}}]$.\n\nAs per the problem statement, we use the property of linearity of expectation, which states that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$E[H_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\sum_k H_k X_k\\right] = \\sum_k E[H_k X_k]$$\nSince each $H_k$ is a deterministic constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$E[H_{\\text{total}}] = \\sum_k H_k E[X_k]$$\nThe expected value of an indicator variable $X_k$ is, by definition, the probability of the event it indicates. Let $A_k$ be the event that action $k$ occurs. Then, $E[X_k] = (1) \\cdot P(X_k=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_k=0) = P(A_k)$.\nThus, the total expected harm is the sum of each harm value multiplied by the unconditional probability of its occurrence:\n$$E[H_{\\text{total}}] = \\sum_k H_k P(A_k)$$\nLet us define the events and their probabilities based on the problem statement.\n- $A_{\\text{Img}}$: A non-invasive imaging study is ordered.\n- $A_{\\text{Bio}}$: A fine-needle biopsy is performed.\n- $A_{\\text{Comp}}$: A minor local complication occurs.\n- $A_{\\text{Sed}}$: A sedation-related adverse effect occurs.\n- $A_{\\text{Surg}}$: Unnecessary surgery is performed.\n- $A_{\\text{Med}}$: A prophylactic medication course is initiated.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities and harms:\n- $P(A_{\\text{Img}}) = P_{\\text{Img}} = 0.75$ with harm $H_{\\text{Img}} = 0.0008$.\n- $P(A_{\\text{Bio}} | A_{\\text{Img}}) = P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} = 0.40$ with harm $H_{\\text{Bio}} = 0.008$.\n- $P(A_{\\text{Comp}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Comp|Bio}} = 0.10$ with harm $H_{\\text{Comp}} = 0.003$.\n- $P(A_{\\text{Sed}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Sed|Bio}} = 0.03$ with harm $H_{\\text{Sed}} = 0.02$.\n- $P(A_{\\text{Surg}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Surg|Bio}} = 0.02$ with harm $H_{\\text{Surg}} = 0.25$.\n- $P(A_{\\text{Med}}) = P_{\\text{Med}} = 0.20$ with harm $H_{\\text{Med}} = 0.004$.\n\nThe problem states that conditional probabilities multiply along the cascade. This allows us to find the unconditional probabilities $P(A_k)$ for each action.\nThe probability of biopsy occurring, $P(A_{\\text{Bio}})$, requires that imaging has first occurred, so $A_{\\text{Bio}} \\subseteq A_{\\text{Img}}$ is implied.\n$$P(A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P(A_{\\text{Bio}} \\cap A_{\\text{Img}}) = P(A_{\\text{Bio}} | A_{\\text{Img}}) P(A_{\\text{Img}}) = P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}$$\nSimilarly, complications, sedation effects, and surgery occur only if a biopsy is performed ($A_{\\text{Comp}} \\subseteq A_{\\text{Bio}}$, $A_{\\text{Sed}} \\subseteq A_{\\text{Bio}}$, $A_{\\text{Surg}} \\subseteq A_{\\text{Bio}}$).\n$$P(A_{\\text{Comp}}) = P(A_{\\text{Comp}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) P(A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Comp|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}$$\n$$P(A_{\\text{Sed}}) = P(A_{\\text{Sed}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) P(A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Sed|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}$$\n$$P(A_{\\text{Surg}}) = P(A_{\\text{Surg}} | A_{\\text{Bio}}) P(A_{\\text{Bio}}) = P_{\\text{Surg|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}$$\nThe medication path is independent of the others, so its probability $P(A_{\\text{Med}})$ is given directly.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for expected harm gives the general symbolic expression:\n$$E[H_{\\text{total}}] = H_{\\text{Img}}P_{\\text{Img}} + H_{\\text{Bio}}(P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}) + H_{\\text{Comp}}(P_{\\text{Comp|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}) + H_{\\text{Sed}}(P_{\\text{Sed|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}) + H_{\\text{Surg}}(P_{\\text{Surg|Bio}} P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} P_{\\text{Img}}) + H_{\\text{Med}}P_{\\text{Med}}$$\nThis can be factored to clarify the structure of the harm pathways:\n$$E[H_{\\text{total}}] = P_{\\text{Img}} \\left( H_{\\text{Img}} + P_{\\text{Bio|Img}} \\left[ H_{\\text{Bio}} + P_{\\text{Comp|Bio}}H_{\\text{Comp}} + P_{\\text{Sed|Bio}}H_{\\text{Sed}} + P_{\\text{Surg|Bio}}H_{\\text{Surg}} \\right] \\right) + P_{\\text{Med}}H_{\\text{Med}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values to evaluate this expression.\nThe expected harm from the independent medication pathway is:\n$$E[\\text{Harm}_{\\text{Med}}] = P_{\\text{Med}}H_{\\text{Med}} = 0.20 \\times 0.004 = 0.0008$$\nFor the imaging and biopsy pathway, we first calculate the expected harm originating from a biopsy and its subsequent events.
