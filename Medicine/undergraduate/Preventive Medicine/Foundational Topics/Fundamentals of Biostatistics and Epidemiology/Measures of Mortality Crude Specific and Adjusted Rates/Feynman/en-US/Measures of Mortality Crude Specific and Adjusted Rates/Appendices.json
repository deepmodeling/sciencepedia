This exercise goes back to first principles, asking you to derive this rate not just as a simple fraction, but as a measure of death intensity based on person-time at risk. Mastering this foundational calculation is the essential first step in understanding and communicating the burden of mortality in a community.",

            "problem": "An urban health department aims to report the crude mortality rate for a single calendar year as a measure of death intensity in the population. Use only the following core definitions: a rate is the number of events per unit of person-time, and for a one-year reporting period in a relatively stable population, the mid-year population approximates the average population at risk so that one person contributes approximately one person-year over the year. The department recorded $D = 3{,}834$ deaths during the year, and the mid-year population was $N = 456{,}000$ persons.\n\nStarting from these definitions and reasoning from first principles, derive the quantity that represents the crude mortality rate per $100{,}000$ person-years for this one-year period, and compute its numerical value. Then, interpret this quantity as a death intensity in terms of expected deaths per person-year. Express the final numerical rate in units of “per $100{,}000$ person-years” and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "We begin by establishing the fundamental definition of a mortality rate. As stated, a rate is the number of events occurring over a specified period divided by the total person-time at risk during that period. In this context, the event is death. Let $R$ denote the crude mortality rate.\n\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}$$\n\nThe number of events, which are deaths, is given as $D = 3,834$.\n\nThe total person-time at risk must be calculated. The problem states that for a one-year reporting period in a relatively stable population, the mid-year population can be used to approximate the average population at risk. Each individual in this average population is assumed to contribute one person-year of observation time. The mid-year population is given as $N = 456,000$ persons.\n\nTherefore, the total person-time at risk for the one-year period is approximated as:\n$$\\text{Total person-time} \\approx N \\times 1 \\, \\text{year} = 456,000 \\, \\text{person-years}$$\n\nUsing this approximation, the crude mortality rate, $R$, which represents the death intensity per person-year, can be expressed as the ratio of the total number of deaths, $D$, to the total person-years at risk, approximated by $N$.\n\n$$R = \\frac{D}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R = \\frac{3,834}{456,000} \\, \\frac{\\text{deaths}}{\\text{person-year}}$$\n\nThis quantity $R$ is the death intensity, representing the expected number of deaths per person per year.\n\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $100,000$ person-years. To convert the rate from per person-year to per $100,000$ person-years, we must multiply by a scaling factor of $100,000$. Let this scaled rate be denoted by $R_{100k}$.\n\n$$R_{100k} = R \\times 100,000 = \\frac{D}{N} \\times 100,000$$\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values to compute the final rate:\n$$R_{100k} = \\frac{3,834}{456,000} \\times 100,000$$\n$$R_{100k} = 840.78947368...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four digits of the result are $8$, $4$, $0$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit. The digit $7$ becomes $8$.\n\n$$R_{100k} \\approx 840.8$$\n\nThe interpretation of this quantity is that for every $100,000$ person-years of time experienced by the population, there were approximately $840.8$ deaths during the specified calendar year. Alternatively, in a hypothetical stable population of exactly $100,000$ people, one would expect approximately $840.8$ deaths over the course of one year. This normalized rate allows for comparison of mortality between populations of different sizes. The underlying death intensity, $R \\approx 0.008408$, signifies that an average individual in this population has an approximate risk of death of $0.008408$ during one year.",

In preventive medicine, the crude mortality rate is defined as the total number of deaths divided by the total person-time at risk, typically expressed per a fixed base.

An adjusted rate, under direct age standardization, is computed by applying the study population’s age-specific mortality experience to the age distribution of a separate standard population to remove confounding by age. \n\nConsider the following study population age-specific mortality rates, each expressed as deaths per $100{,}000$ person-years:\n- Ages $0$–$14$: $30$\n- Ages $15$–$44$: $90$\n- Ages $45$–$64$: $400$\n- Ages $65$–$74$: $1200$\n- Ages $\\geq 75$: $5000$\n\nA standard population has the following age distribution (counts of persons):\n- Ages $0$–$14$: $220{,}000$\n- Ages $15$–$44$: $360{,}000$\n- Ages $45$–$64$: $220{,}000$\n- Ages $65$–$74$: $120{,}000$\n- Ages $\\geq 75$: $80{,}000$\n\nUsing only the core definitions stated above and the data provided, compute the directly age-standardized all-cause mortality rate for the study population with respect to this standard population.

Calculate Crude Mortality Rates (CMR)**\nThe crude mortality rate is the total number of deaths divided by the total population, expressed per $1{,}000$ persons. First, we find the number of deaths in each city.\n\n*   **City Delta:**\n    *   Adult deaths: $95{,}000 \\text{ persons} \\times \\frac{3 \\text{ deaths}}{1{,}000 \\text{ persons}} = 285$ deaths\n    *   Senior deaths: $5{,}000 \\text{ persons} \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ deaths}}{1{,}000 \\text{ persons}} = 150$ deaths\n    *   Total deaths: $285 + 150 = 435$\n    *   CMR: $\\frac{435 \\text{ deaths}}{100{,}000 \\text{ persons}} \\times 1{,}000 = 4.35$ per $1{,}000$\n\n*   **City Sigma:**\n    *   Adult deaths: $70{,}000 \\text{ persons} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ deaths}}{1{,}000 \\text{ persons}} = 140$ deaths\n    *   Senior deaths: $30{,}000 \\text{ persons} \\times \\frac{25 \\text{ deaths}}{1{,}000 \\text{ persons}} = 750$ deaths\n    *   Total deaths: $140 + 750 = 890$\n    *   CMR: $\\frac{890 \\text{ deaths}}{100{,}000 \\text{ persons}} \\times 1{,}000 = 8.90$ per $1{,}000$\n\n**2.
