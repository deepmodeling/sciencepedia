            "introduction": "Understanding morbidity begins with the concept of risk, and cumulative incidence is our most direct measure of the average risk of developing a disease over a specific time period. This first exercise  presents an idealized scenario of a closed cohort, which is a population where no new members are added and none are lost over time. By working within this clear framework, you can master the fundamental calculation of risk as the proportion of susceptible individuals who develop the disease, providing a solid foundation for more complex scenarios.",

            "problem": "A health department enrolls a closed cohort of $5{,}000$ disease-free adults at baseline and observes them for $5$ years. The cohort remains closed with complete follow-up for the entire $5$-year period: no individuals enter or leave, there are no losses to follow-up, and every incident case is ascertained. During the follow-up, exactly $450$ individuals experience their first-ever diagnosis of the disease of interest. Using the core definition that risk over a specified period in a closed cohort with complete follow-up is the probability that an initially disease-free individual develops the disease in that period, which in finite cohorts is estimated by the observed proportion of initially disease-free individuals who become incident cases during that period, compute the cumulative incidence over $5$ years and interpret the result as a risk for an initially disease-free individual in this cohort over the $5$-year period. Express your numerical answer as a decimal proportion and round to four significant figures. No units are required in the final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation and interpretation of the cumulative incidence of a disease in a closed cohort over a specified period. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and the scenario, while idealized, is a standard model for teaching fundamental epidemiological concepts.\n\nThe core definition provided in the problem statement for risk in a closed cohort with complete follow-up is that it is estimated by the proportion of initially disease-free individuals who become new (incident) cases during the observation period. This is the definition of cumulative incidence, often denoted as $CI$.\n\nThe formula for cumulative incidence is:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases of the disease during a specified period}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}$$\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided in the problem:\nThe number of individuals initially at risk, meaning they are disease-free at the start of the study (baseline), is $N_0$.\n$$N_0 = 5{,}000$$\nThe number of new (incident) cases that develop during the $5$-year follow-up period is $I$.\n$$I = 450$$\nThe duration of the follow-up period is $T = 5$ years.\n\nThe problem specifies a closed cohort with complete follow-up. This is a critical condition. \"Closed cohort\" means no new individuals enter the study after it begins. \"Complete follow-up\" means all individuals who started the study are accounted for at the end of the period, with their disease status known. In this idealized scenario, the initial population at risk, $N_0$, is the correct denominator for the entire period.\n\nUsing the formula for cumulative incidence, we can substitute the given values:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = \\frac{I}{N_0} = \\frac{450}{5{,}000}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = 0.09$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.09$. To express this with four significant figures, we must add three trailing zeros. The first significant figure is the $9$, and the three subsequent zeros are also significant. Therefore, we write the result as:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = 0.09000$$\n\nThe interpretation of this result, as requested, is that the cumulative incidence represents the average risk for an individual member of the cohort. An individual who was disease-free at the beginning of the $5$-year study period had a $0.09000$ probability (or a $9.000\\%$ chance) of developing the disease during that $5$-year span. This quantifies the risk of becoming an incident case for the population under study over the specified time frame.",

            "introduction": "The accuracy of any morbidity measure, such as prevalence, depends directly on the accuracy of our case detection methods.

This exercise  introduces the crucial concepts of test sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$) and guides you through correcting an observed prevalence for test misclassification. Mastering this technique is essential for producing more scientifically valid estimates of disease burden from screening data.",

The provided numerical values for sensitivity, specificity, and observed positive proportion are realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be a binary random variable representing the true disease status, where $D=1$ indicates the presence of the chronic infection (diseased) and $D=0$ indicates its absence (not diseased). Let $T$ be a binary random variable for the diagnostic test result, where $T=1$ is a positive test and $T=0$ is a negative test.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantities:\n- The observed proportion of positive test results, which is the empirical estimate of the probability $\\Pr(T=1)$. Let us denote this as $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} = 0.12$.\n- The test sensitivity, $Se = \\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=1) = 0.85$.

This is the probability that a truly non-diseased individual tests negative.\n\nThe quantity to be estimated is the true prevalence, $P = \\Pr(D=1)$.\n\nThe law of total probability allows us to express the probability of a positive test, $\\Pr(T=1)$, by conditioning on the disease status:\n$$\n\\Pr(T=1) = \\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=1)\\Pr(D=1) + \\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=0)\\Pr(D=0)\n$$\nWe can substitute the known definitions into this equation.\n- $\\Pr(T=1)$ is the quantity estimated by $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}}$.\n- $\\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=1)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n- $\\Pr(D=1)$ is the true prevalence, $P$.\n- $\\Pr(D=0) = 1 - \\Pr(D=1) = 1-P$.\n- $\\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=0)$ is the false positive rate. This is complementary to the specificity: $\\Pr(T=1 \\mid D=0) = 1 - \\Pr(T=0 \\mid D=0) = 1-Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the law of total probability gives the expression for the observed positive proportion in terms of the true prevalence and test parameters:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1-Sp) \\cdot (1-P))\n$$\nThis is the required expression.

For the estimated prevalence $P$ to be a scientifically meaningful probability, it must lie in the interval $[0, 1]$.\n$1$. The denominator $Se+Sp-1$ must not be zero. The sum $Se+Sp$ is a measure of the test's total diagnostic accuracy. If $Se+Sp=1$, the test is uninformative (equivalent to a random guess), and the prevalence cannot be determined from the test data. A useful test must have $Se+Sp>1$.\n$2$. Assuming an informative test where $Se+Sp-1 > 0$, the condition $P \\ge 0$ requires that the numerator be non-negative: $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} - (1-Sp) \\ge 0$, which implies $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} \\ge 1-Sp$. The observed positive proportion must be at least as large as the false-positive rate.\n$3$. The condition $P \\le 1$ requires $\\frac{\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} - (1-Sp)}{Se + Sp - 1} \\le 1$. This simplifies to $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} - 1 + Sp \\le Se + Sp - 1$, which gives $\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} \\le Se$. The observed positive proportion cannot exceed the sensitivity.\nIn summary, for the corrected estimate $P$ to be physically meaningful ($0 \\le P \\le 1$), the observed data must satisfy $1-Sp \\le \\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} \\le Se$.\n\nNow, we compute the corrected prevalence using the provided values:\n$\\hat{P}_{\\text{obs}} = 0.12$\n$Se = 0.85$\n$Sp = 0.95$\n\nFirst, check the constraints:\nThe false positive rate is $1-Sp = 1-0.95 = 0.05$.\nThe sensitivity is $Se = 0.85$.\nThe required condition is $0.05 \\le 0.12 \\le 0.85$, which is true. Therefore, a meaningful prevalence estimate between $0$ and $1$ can be calculated.\n\nSubstitute the values into the derived formula for $P$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{0.12 - (1-0.95)}{0.85 + 0.95 - 1}\n$$\n$$\nP = \\frac{0.12 - 0.05}{1.80 - 1}\n$$\n$$\nP = \\frac{0.07}{0.80}\n$$\n$$\nP = 0.0875\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.0875$ already has exactly three significant figures (the digits $8$, $7$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe corrected prevalence estimate is $0.0875$.",
