            "problem": "A health promotion planner is designing an intervention to increase regular exercise among adults using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) posits that behavioral intention is determined jointly by three constructs: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. In preventive medicine, when these constructs are measured on standardized scales in the unit interval and combined under an additive, linear multi-attribute utility framework that satisfies independence and monotonicity, the operational intention index is formed by aggregating each construct according to its empirical importance weight.\n\nGiven standardized assessments for a target individual of attitude $A=0.7$, subjective norm $\\mathrm{SN}=0.5$, and perceived behavioral control $\\mathrm{PBC}=0.6$, and empirically estimated importance weights $w_a=0.5$, $w_s=0.2$, and $w_p=0.3$, compute the individual’s intention index to exercise under the additive model described. Express your final result as a dimensionless decimal.\n\nThen, based on the computed value and the weights provided, explain which single construct offers the greatest marginal leverage for increasing the intention index and why, in terms of the additive model’s structure. Your final numeric answer should be the computed intention index; the interpretive component does not require a numeric response.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a standard framework in health psychology and preventive medicine. The operationalization of the theory as a linear additive model is a well-established and mathematically consistent approach. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution without contradictions.\n\nThe problem states that the behavioral intention index, which we shall denote as $I$, is determined by an additive, linear aggregation of three constructs: attitude ($A$), subjective norm ($\\mathrm{SN}$), and perceived behavioral control ($\\mathrm{PBC}$). Each construct is multiplied by its corresponding empirical importance weight ($w_a$, $w_s$, $w_p$). This description formalizes to the following weighted sum model:\n$$\nI = w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}\n$$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Attitude score: $A=0.7$\n- Subjective norm score: $\\mathrm{SN}=0.5$\n- Perceived behavioral control score: $\\mathrm{PBC}=0.6$\n- Attitude weight: $w_a=0.5$\n- Subjective norm weight: $w_s=0.2$\n- Perceived behavioral control weight: $w_p=0.3$\n\nIt is noted that the scores are standardized on the unit interval, which is consistent with the provided values $0.7$, $0.5$, and $0.6$. The weights are positive and sum to unity: $w_a + w_s + w_p = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 1.0$, which is characteristic of importance weights in a properly constituted linear multi-attribute utility model.\n\nTo compute the individual's intention index $I$, we substitute the given values into the model equation:\n$$\nI = (0.5)(0.7) + (0.2)(0.5) + (0.3)(0.6)\n$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$\nI = 0.35 + 0.10 + 0.18\n$$\n\nSumming the terms yields the final value for the intention index:\n$$\nI = 0.63\n$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to identify which single construct offers the greatest marginal leverage for increasing the intention index. In the context of the given linear model, \"marginal leverage\" corresponds to the rate of change of the intention index $I$ with respect to a change in one of the constructs, holding the others constant. This is mathematically represented by the partial derivative of $I$ with respect to each construct.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n1.  The marginal leverage of attitude ($A$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_a\n    $$\n2.  The marginal leverage of subjective norm ($\\mathrm{SN}$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\mathrm{SN}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathrm{SN}}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_s\n    $$\n3.  The marginal leverage of perceived behavioral control ($\\mathrm{PBC}$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\mathrm{PBC}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathrm{PBC}}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_p\n    $$\n\nFrom the structure of this additive model, the marginal impact of each construct on the intention index is precisely its importance weight. To determine which construct offers the greatest leverage, we compare the values of these weights:\n- $w_a = 0.5$\n- $w_s = 0.2$\n- $w_p = 0.3$\n\nComparing these values, we find that $w_a > w_p > w_s$. The weight for attitude, $w_a=0.5$, is the largest. Therefore, attitude ($A$) offers the greatest marginal leverage. This means that for a given unit increase in any single construct's score (assuming the score is not already at its maximum of $1$), an increase in attitude will produce the largest corresponding increase in the intention index ($I$). Specifically, a $0.1$ point increase in attitude score would increase the intention index by $0.1 \\times 0.5 = 0.05$, whereas the same increase in perceived behavioral control would raise the index by only $0.1 \\times 0.3 = 0.03$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding with a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and definitions are provided verbatim:\n- Baseline $1$-year risk of a preventable adverse event: $p_0 = 0.20$\n- Post-intervention $1$-year risk: $p_1 = 0.15$\n- Assumption: Independence of individual outcomes.\n- Assumption: Stable average effect across treated individuals.\n- Definition: Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), $ARR = p_0 - p_1$.\n- Principle: The expected number of events prevented when treating $n$ individuals is $n \\times ARR$.\n- Definition: The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the smallest positive real number $n$ such that the expected number of events prevented equals $1$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated for validity based on the provided information.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem employs standard, foundational concepts from epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The terms risk ($p_0$, $p_1$), Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), and Number Needed to Treat (NNT) are central to the quantitative assessment of public health interventions. The formulas and relationships described ($ARR = p_0 - p_1$ and $NNT = 1/ARR$) are correct and universally accepted definitions in the field. The provided probabilities ($0.20$ and $0.15$) are demographically plausible for a high-risk group and a moderately effective lifestyle intervention. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n- **Well-Posed and Objective**: The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective, precise, and devoid of ambiguity or subjective claims. The question is clearly stated and the path to the solution is logically determined by the given principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, and structured to permit a unique, unambiguous solution. We may therefore proceed with the formal derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), which quantifies the effort required by an intervention to prevent a single adverse outcome.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant quantities based on the problem statement.\nLet $p_0$ represent the baseline probability of an adverse event occurring in a $1$-year period for an individual in the target cohort.\n$$p_0 = 0.20$$\nLet $p_1$ represent the probability of an adverse event in the same period for an individual who has received the lifestyle intervention.\n$$p_1 = 0.15$$\n\nThe problem defines the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) as the difference between the baseline and post-intervention risks. The ARR represents the proportion of individuals for whom an adverse event is averted due to the intervention.\n$$ARR = p_0 - p_1$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05$$\nThis result, $ARR = 0.05$, signifies that the intervention reduces the absolute risk of an adverse event by $5$ percentage points.\n\nNext, we address the concept of expected event counts. For a single individual receiving the treatment, the reduction in event probability is simply the ARR. Under the assumption of independent outcomes for each individual, the linearity of expectation allows us to state that for a group of $n$ treated individuals, the total expected number of events prevented, denoted $E[\\text{prevented}]$, is the product of $n$ and the ARR.\n$$E[\\text{prevented}] = n \\times ARR$$\nThe problem defines the NNT as the specific number of individuals, $n$, that must be treated for the expected number of prevented events to equal $1$. We set up the equation based on this definition:\n$$E[\\text{prevented}] = 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for the expected number of events prevented:\n$$n \\times ARR = 1$$\nThis equation defines $n$ as the NNT. We can solve for NNT by rearranging the equation:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.05}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$NNT = 20$$\nThe calculation yields an exact integer. Therefore, rounding is not required. The Number Needed to Treat is $20$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe result, $NNT = 20$, has a direct and practical interpretation for health promotion planning. It signifies that, on average, $20$ individuals from the at-risk cohort must participate in the lifestyle-focused program for a $1$-year period to prevent one adverse event that would have occurred without the intervention.\n\nThis metric is crucial for program scale-up and resource allocation. For instance, if the municipal health department aims to prevent $100$ adverse events in the community per year, they can use the NNT to estimate the required program capacity. They would need to recruit and successfully deliver the program to $NNT \\times 100 = 20 \\times 100 = 2000$ individuals. The NNT thus bridges the gap between a statistical measure of effect (ARR) and the operational logistics of public health practice, enabling tangible projections for budgeting, staffing, and outreach efforts. It is a critical tool for communicating the practical yield of an intervention to policymakers and stakeholders.",

            "introduction": "In the real world of public health, resources are always limited, meaning an effective intervention must also be efficient. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a systematic method for evaluating if an intervention's health benefits justify its costs compared to an alternative.

            "problem": "A public health department is considering a community-based lifestyle counseling program for adults at elevated cardiovascular risk. In preventive medicine, a core principle of health promotion is to prioritize interventions that yield the greatest health gain per unit of resource expended. Under a payer perspective and a one-year time horizon, the department estimates the expected per-participant cost and the expected per-participant health gain, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), for two strategies: the new counseling program and current practice (brief advice with referral). The expected costs are $C_1$ for the counseling program and $C_0$ for current practice, and the expected health gains are $E_1$ and $E_0$, respectively. The fundamental definitions for cost-effectiveness require that incremental quantities be computed as differences between the intervention and the comparator: incremental cost is the change in expected cost attributable to choosing the intervention over the comparator, and incremental effect is the change in expected QALYs attributable to that choice. The ratio of these incremental quantities represents the resources required to obtain one additional unit of health gain and is the basis for determining whether the intervention is efficient relative to a specified willingness-to-pay threshold for health gains.\n\nUse the following data, which are scientifically plausible for a one-year program in this setting: $C_1$ is $1{,}200$ United States dollars (USD), $C_0$ is $800$ USD, $E_1$ is $0.05$ QALYs, and $E_0$ is $0.02$ QALYs.
