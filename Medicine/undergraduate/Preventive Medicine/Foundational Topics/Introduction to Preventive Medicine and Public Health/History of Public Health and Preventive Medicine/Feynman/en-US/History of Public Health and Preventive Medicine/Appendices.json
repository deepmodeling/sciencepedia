Pioneers like John Graunt began systematically analyzing civic records, or \"Bills of Mortality,\" to understand patterns of life and death in populations. This exercise transports you back to that era, challenging you to compute fundamental demographic measures from hypothetical parish data . By calculating crude and age-specific death rates and then performing an indirect standardization, you will grapple with a foundational problem in epidemiology: how to make fair comparisons of health outcomes between populations with different age structures.",

            "problem": "A parish register from the late 17th-century records age-specific death counts over a single calendar year, along with a mid-year population enumeration by age group. Assume a closed population over the year (no major in- or out-migration) and no catastrophic epidemic that year, so that the mid-year population approximates the total person-time at risk over the year. Using only core definitions of mortality measures (events divided by person-time at risk) and the idea of indirect standardization (comparing observed deaths to the deaths expected if the study population experienced a specified set of age-specific rates), complete the following.\n\nData for the parish (age groups, mid-year population, and observed deaths over 1 year):\n- Ages $0$–$4$: population $n_{1} = 120$, observed deaths $d_{1} = 20$.\n- Ages $5$–$14$: population $n_{2} = 260$, observed deaths $d_{2} = 4$.\n- Ages $15$–$44$: population $n_{3} = 420$, observed deaths $d_{3} = 9$.\n- Ages $45$–$64$: population $n_{4} = 180$, observed deaths $d_{4} = 12$.\n- Ages $\\geq 65$: population $n_{5} = 70$, observed deaths $d_{5} = 14$.\n\nA contemporaneous standard population provides the following age-specific death rates per $1{,}000$ persons per year:\n- Ages $0$–$4$: $r_{1}^{\\ast} = 180$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n- Ages $5$–$14$: $r_{2}^{\\ast} = 6$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n- Ages $15$–$44$: $r_{3}^{\\ast} = 12$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n- Ages $45$–$64$: $r_{4}^{\\ast} = 28$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n- Ages $\\geq 65$: $r_{5}^{\\ast} = 90$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n\nTasks:\n- Compute the crude death rate (Crude Death Rate (CDR)) for the parish for the year, expressed per $1{,}000$ persons per year.\n- Compute the age-specific death rate (Age-Specific Death Rate (ASDR)) for each age group, expressed per $1{,}000$ persons per year.\n- Using indirect standardization, compute the standardized mortality ratio (Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)) by comparing the parish’s observed total deaths to the total expected deaths obtained by applying the standard age-specific death rates to the parish’s age distribution.\n\nExpress all rates in units of per $1{,}000$ persons per year. Express the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) as a unitless decimal (not a percentage). Round the SMR to four significant figures. Report only the SMR as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data provided for the parish are:\n- Age group $1$ ($0$–$4$ years): mid-year population $n_{1} = 120$, observed deaths $d_{1} = 20$.\n- Age group $2$ ($5$–$14$ years): mid-year population $n_{2} = 260$, observed deaths $d_{2} = 4$.\n- Age group $3$ ($15$–$44$ years): mid-year population $n_{3} = 420$, observed deaths $d_{3} = 9$.\n- Age group $4$ ($45$–$64$ years): mid-year population $n_{4} = 180$, observed deaths $d_{4} = 12$.\n- Age group $5$ ($\\geq 65$ years): mid-year population $n_{5} = 70$, observed deaths $d_{5} = 14$.\n\nThe standard population provides the following age-specific death rates ($r_{i}^{\\ast}$) per $1,000$ persons per year:\n- Age group $1$: $r_{1}^{\\ast} = 180$.\n- Age group $2$: $r_{2}^{\\ast} = 6$.\n- Age group $3$: $r_{3}^{\\ast} = 12$.\n- Age group $4$: $r_{4}^{\\ast} = 28$.\n- Age group $5$: $r_{5}^{\\ast} = 90$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Crude Death Rate (CDR), Age-Specific Death Rates (ASDRs), and the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for the parish, with the SMR being the final reported answer.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it uses fundamental concepts of epidemiology and demography (CDR, ASDR, SMR, indirect standardization). The use of a mid-year population as an estimate for person-years at risk in a closed-population context is a standard and valid approximation. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data are provided to calculate the requested quantities via established formulas, leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data are numerically consistent and plausible for a pre-modern population. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the necessary aggregate values and intermediate rates, culminating in the calculation of the SMR.\n\n**1. Total Population and Total Observed Deaths in the Parish**\nThe total population of the parish, $N$, is the sum of the populations of the age groups:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} n_{i} = n_{1} + n_{2} + n_{3} + n_{4} + n_{5} = 120 + 260 + 420 + 180 + 70 = 1050$$\nThe total number of observed deaths in the parish, $D_{\\text{obs}}$, is the sum of the deaths in the age groups:\n$$D_{\\text{obs}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} d_{i} = d_{1} + d_{2} + d_{3} + d_{4} + d_{5} = 20 + 4 + 9 + 12 + 14 = 59$$\n\n**2. Crude Death Rate (CDR)**\nThe CDR is the total number of deaths per $1,000$ persons in the total population.\n$$\\text{CDR} = \\frac{D_{\\text{obs}}}{N} \\times 1000 = \\frac{59}{1050} \\times 1000 \\approx 56.19 \\text{ per } 1000$$\n\n**3. Age-Specific Death Rates (ASDRs)**\nThe ASDR for each age group $i$, denoted $\\text{ASDR}_{i}$, is the number of deaths in that group per $1,000$ persons in the same group.\n$$\\text{ASDR}_{i} = \\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}} \\times 1000$$\n- For ages $0$–$4$: $\\text{ASDR}_{1} = \\frac{20}{120} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1000 \\approx 166.67$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $5$–$14$: $\\text{ASDR}_{2} = \\frac{4}{260} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{65} \\times 1000 \\approx 15.38$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $15$–$44$: $\\text{ASDR}_{3} = \\frac{9}{420} \\times 1000 = \\frac{3}{140} \\times 1000 \\approx 21.43$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $45$–$64$: $\\text{ASDR}_{4} = \\frac{12}{180} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{15} \\times 1000 \\approx 66.67$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $\\geq 65$: $\\text{ASDR}_{5} = \\frac{14}{70} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1000 = 200$ per $1000$.\n\n**4. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)**\nThe SMR is calculated using indirect standardization. It is the ratio of the total observed deaths to the total expected deaths.\n$$\\text{SMR} = \\frac{D_{\\text{obs}}}{D_{\\text{exp}}}$$\nThe expected number of deaths, $D_{\\text{exp}}$, is calculated by applying the age-specific death rates from the standard population ($r_{i}^{\\ast}$) to the parish's population distribution ($n_{i}$). The standard rates $r_{i}^{\\ast}$ are given per $1,000$ persons, so they must be converted to proportions by dividing by $1000$. The expected deaths for each group, $e_{i}$, is $n_{i} \\times (r_{i}^{\\ast} / 1000)$.\n$$D_{\\text{exp}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} e_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\left( n_{i} \\times \\frac{r_{i}^{\\ast}}{1000} \\right)$$\n- Expected deaths for ages $0$–$4$: $e_{1} = 120 \\times \\frac{180}{1000} = 120 \\times 0.180 = 21.6$.\n- Expected deaths for ages $5$–$14$: $e_{2} = 260 \\times \\frac{6}{1000} = 260 \\times 0.006 = 1.56$.\n- Expected deaths for ages $15$–$44$: $e_{3} = 420 \\times \\frac{12}{1000} = 420 \\times 0.012 = 5.04$.\n- Expected deaths for ages $45$–$64$: $e_{4} = 180 \\times \\frac{28}{1000} = 180 \\times 0.028 = 5.04$.\n- Expected deaths for ages $\\geq 65$: $e_{5} = 70 \\times \\frac{90}{1000} = 70 \\times 0.090 = 6.3$.\n\nThe total expected deaths is the sum of these values:\n$$D_{\\text{exp}} = 21.6 + 1.56 + 5.04 + 5.04 + 6.3 = 39.54$$\nNow, the SMR can be computed:\n$$\\text{SMR} = \\frac{D_{\\text{obs}}}{D_{\\text{exp}}} = \\frac{59}{39.54} \\approx 1.492159838...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the SMR to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{SMR} \\approx 1.492$$\nThis SMR value indicates that the parish experienced approximately $49.2\\%$ more deaths than would have been expected if it had the same age-specific mortality rates as the standard population.",

Consider the following aggregated household-level data collected over the same outbreak period, with household assignment fixed and cholera case ascertainment complete.

The population attributable fraction for contaminated water exposure in the combined population.\n\nExpress all three answers as exact values in simplest fractional form or exact rational numbers; do not use percentage signs and do not round. Report the final answers in the order listed above.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is based on a foundational episode in the history of epidemiology and uses standard, well-defined metrics. All data required for the calculations are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a solution is presented forthwith.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three fundamental epidemiologic measures of association and impact: the risk difference, the risk ratio, and the population attributable fraction. We are given data for two populations: an exposed group receiving contaminated water from the Southwark and Vauxhall (SV) company, and an unexposed group receiving cleaner water from the Lambeth (L) company.\n\nLet $N_{SV}$ be the number of residents served by Southwark and Vauxhall, and $D_{SV}$ be the number of cholera deaths in that group.\nLet $N_{L}$ be the number of residents served by Lambeth, and $D_{L}$ be the number of cholera deaths in that group.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Exposed group (SV): $N_{SV} = 40,000$, $D_{SV} = 1,000$.\n- Unexposed group (L): $N_{L} = 30,000$, $D_{L} = 100$.\n\nThe risk, or incidence proportion, is the number of new cases (deaths) in a specified period divided by the number of individuals at risk at the beginning of that period.\n\nThe risk in the exposed group, $R_{E}$, is the risk among those served by Southwark and Vauxhall:\n$$R_{E} = \\frac{D_{SV}}{N_{SV}} = \\frac{1,000}{40,000} = \\frac{1}{40}$$\n\nThe risk in the unexposed group, $R_{U}$, is the risk among those served by Lambeth:\n$$R_{U} = \\frac{D_{L}}{N_{L}} = \\frac{100}{30,000} = \\frac{1}{300}$$\n\nWith these fundamental quantities calculated, we can now compute the three requested measures.\n\n1.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\n    The risk difference, also known as the attributable risk, is the absolute difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups. It quantifies the excess risk of the outcome (death) that is attributable to the exposure.\n    $$RD = R_{E} - R_{U}$$\n    Substituting the calculated risks:\n    $$RD = \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{1}{300}$$\n    To subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of $40$ and $300$. The $LCM(40, 300) = 600$.\n    $$RD = \\frac{15}{600} - \\frac{2}{600} = \\frac{13}{600}$$\n    The risk difference is $\\frac{13}{600}$.\n\n2.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**\n    The risk ratio, also known as the relative risk, is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It quantifies the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome.\n    $$RR = \\frac{R_{E}}{R_{U}}$$\n    Substituting the calculated risks:\n    $$RR = \\frac{\\frac{1}{40}}{\\frac{1}{300}} = \\frac{300}{40} = \\frac{30}{4} = \\frac{15}{2}$$\n    The risk ratio is $\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\n    The population attributable fraction is the proportion of new cases in the total population that can be attributed to the exposure. It is calculated using the total population risk ($R_{T}$) and the risk in the unexposed group ($R_{U}$).\n    $$PAF = \\frac{R_{T} - R_{U}}{R_{T}}$$\n    First, we must calculate the total population risk, $R_{T}$. The total population is $N_{T} = N_{SV} + N_{L} = 40,000 + 30,000 = 70,000$. The total number of deaths is $D_{T} = D_{SV} + D_{L} = 1,000 + 100 = 1,100$.\n    The total population risk is therefore:\n    $$R_{T} = \\frac{D_{T}}{N_{T}} = \\frac{1,100}{70,000} = \\frac{11}{700}$$\n    Now we can calculate the PAF:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{11}{700} - \\frac{1}{300}}{\\frac{11}{700}}$$\n    First, we calculate the numerator: $\\frac{11}{700} - \\frac{1}{300}$. The common denominator is $LCM(700, 300) = 2,100$.\n    $$\\frac{11 \\times 3}{2,100} - \\frac{1 \\times 7}{2,100} = \\frac{33 - 7}{2,100} = \\frac{26}{2,100} = \\frac{13}{1,050}$$\n    Now, we complete the PAF calculation:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{13}{1,050}}{\\frac{11}{700}} = \\frac{13}{1,050} \\times \\frac{700}{11} = \\frac{13 \\times 700}{1,050 \\times 11}$$\n    Simplifying the fraction:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{13 \\times 70}{105 \\times 11} = \\frac{13 \\times (35 \\times 2)}{(35 \\times 3) \\times 11} = \\frac{13 \\times 2}{3 \\times 11} = \\frac{26}{33}$$\n    The population attributable fraction is $\\frac{26}{33}$.\n\nThe three requested values are the risk difference of $\\frac{13}{600}$, the risk ratio of $\\frac{15}{2}$, and the population attributable fraction of $\\frac{26}{33}$.",

Public debates over vaccine safety are not new, and addressing them requires clear, quantitative communication. This exercise uses a historical scenario to introduce two powerful tools from evidence-based medicine: the Number Needed to Benefit ($NNTB$) and the Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$) . By computing and comparing these metrics, you will learn a simple yet profound method for evaluating the net benefit of a public health program and framing risk-benefit discussions.",

Using only the core definitions of absolute risk and event rates in evidence-based preventive medicine, determine the ratio $R$ of the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) to the Number Needed to Benefit (NNTB) implied by these rates.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on established principles of preventive medicine.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R = \\frac{\\text{NNH}}{\\text{NNTB}}$, where NNH is the Number Needed to Harm and NNTB is the Number Needed to Benefit. These metrics are fundamental in evidence-based medicine for comparing the positive and negative effects of an intervention.\n\nFirst, we define the Number Needed to Benefit (NNTB). The NNTB is the average number of patients who must be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The problem states that the expected benefit is \"$1$ smallpox death averted per $1{,}000$ vaccinations\". This rate can be interpreted directly as the Absolute Risk Reduction for death due to smallpox, attributable to the vaccine under these conditions.\nLet $P_{benefit}$ be the probability of the benefit (averting a death) per vaccination.\n$$P_{benefit} = \\text{ARR} = \\frac{1}{1{,}000}$$\nThe NNTB is then calculated as the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$\\text{NNTB} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1{,}000}} = 1{,}000$$\nThis means that, on average, $1{,}000$ people must be vaccinated to prevent one death from smallpox.\n\nNext, we define the Number Needed to Harm (NNH). The NNH is the average number of individuals who must be exposed to a risk factor (in this case, the vaccine) to cause one additional harmful event. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) of the adverse event. The problem states that the risk of a serious vaccine-related adverse event is \"$1$ per $100{,}000$ vaccinations\". This rate represents the Absolute Risk Increase for a serious adverse event.\nLet $P_{harm}$ be the probability of a serious adverse event per vaccination.\n$$P_{harm} = \\text{ARI} = \\frac{1}{100{,}000}$$\nThe NNH is calculated as the reciprocal of the ARI:\n$$\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARI}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{100{,}000}} = 100{,}000$$\nThis means that, on average, for every $100{,}000$ people vaccinated, one serious adverse event is expected to occur.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the NNH to the NNTB. We can now compute this ratio using the values derived above.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{NNH}}{\\text{NNTB}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for NNH and NNTB:\n$$R = \\frac{100{,}000}{1{,}000}$$\n$$R = 100$$\nThis ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as both NNH and NNTB have units of \"individuals per event\", which cancel out. The value of $R=100$ indicates that the number of people one needs to vaccinate to cause one serious harm is $100$ times greater than the number of people one needs to vaccinate to prevent one death.",
