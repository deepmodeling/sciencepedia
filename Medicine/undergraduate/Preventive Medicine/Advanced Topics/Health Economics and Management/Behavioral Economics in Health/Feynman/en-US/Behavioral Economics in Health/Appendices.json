            "introduction": "Understanding why individuals delay beneficial health actions, like getting a flu shot, is a central challenge in preventive medicine. The quasi-hyperbolic discounting model provides a powerful mathematical framework for explaining this procrastination through the concept of present bias, where the parameter $\\beta$ captures our tendency to overvalue immediate rewards relative to all future rewards. This exercise  will guide you through calculating the decision-making process of a 'naive' individual—one who is unaware of their own bias—to reveal the predictable gap between their intentions and their actions.",

            "problem": "Consider a single preventive action (a seasonal influenza vaccination) evaluated by a present-biased decision maker in the sense of quasi-hyperbolic discounting. The preventive action can be taken at two discrete decision points: today at time $t=0$ or next week at time $t=1$. If taken at either $t=0$ or $t=1$, the action reduces an expected illness cost by $7$ that would otherwise be incurred one month from now, which we treat as four weeks ahead at time $t=4$. The monetary cost of the vaccination is $5$ paid at the time it is taken. Assume a commonly used quasi-hyperbolic time preference structure with parameters $(\\beta,\\delta)=(0.7,0.99)$, where immediate outcomes at the evaluation time are weighted by $1$, and all outcomes strictly in the future from the evaluation time are weighted by $\\beta \\delta^{t}$, with $t$ denoting the number of weeks ahead from the evaluation point. The agent is naive with respect to present bias: when planning today about what they will do next week, they fail to anticipate that next week they will still apply present-biased weighting, and instead forecast that their future self will evaluate delayed outcomes with $\\beta=1$.\n\nUsing these foundations, do the following:\n1. From the standpoint of $t=0$, compute the discounted net utility difference between vaccinating now versus not vaccinating now, and infer the predicted choice today, denoted by the indicator $x_{0}$, where $x_{0}=1$ if the agent vaccinates today and $x_{0}=0$ otherwise.\n2. From the standpoint of $t=0$, compute the naive agent’s stated plan for next week, denoted by the indicator $p_{1}$, where $p_{1}=1$ if the agent says they will vaccinate at $t=1$ (conditional on not having vaccinated at $t=0$), and $p_{1}=0$ otherwise. In forming this plan from $t=0$, use the naive assumption that next week’s evaluation will apply $\\beta=1$ to outcomes beyond $t=1$.\n3. Determine whether dynamic inconsistency arises by comparing the plan $p_{1}$ to the actual next-week choice $x_{1}$ that would be made at $t=1$ under present-biased evaluation with $(\\beta,\\delta)=(0.7,0.99)$. Quantify this as $\\Delta=|p_{1}-x_{1}|$, where $\\Delta=1$ indicates a planning–doing mismatch and $\\Delta=0$ indicates consistency.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single row matrix $\\big(x_{0},\\,p_{1},\\,\\Delta\\big)$ using the LaTeX pmatrix environment. No rounding is required, and no units are to be included in the final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a decision-making process under the framework of quasi-hyperbolic discounting with naive present bias. We are given the quasi-hyperbolic preference parameters $(\\beta, \\delta) = (0.7, 0.99)$. The utility of a stream of outcomes $(c_{\\tau}, c_{\\tau+1}, \\dots)$ evaluated at time $\\tau$ is given by $U_{\\tau} = u(c_{\\tau}) + \\beta \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\delta^k u(c_{\\tau+k})$. In this problem, the utility $u(c)$ is simply the monetary value $c$.\n\nThe decision maker must choose whether to take a preventive action (vaccination) at time $t=0$ or at time $t=1$. The vaccination has a cost of $5$ paid at the time of action and provides a delayed benefit of $7$ at time $t=4$.\n\nWe will solve the problem in three sequential steps as requested.\n\n**1. The choice at time $t=0$, denoted by $x_0$**\n\nAt time $t=0$, the agent decides between vaccinating immediately or waiting. We must compare the discounted utility of these two options from the perspective of $t=0$.\n\nThe utility of vaccinating at $t=0$ involves an immediate cost of $5$ and a future benefit of $7$ at $t=4$. The time delay for the benefit is $4$ weeks.\nThe discounted utility is:\n$$U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^{4-0}(7) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^4 (7)$$\n\nIf the agent does not vaccinate at $t=0$, they will reconsider at $t=1$. To evaluate the \"wait\" option, a naive agent at $t=0$ must forecast what they will do at $t=1$. The agent's naivete means they believe their future self at $t=1$ will evaluate outcomes using $\\beta=1$.\n\nLet's determine this predicted choice at $t=1$. From the perspective of $t=1$, a cost of $5$ would be immediate, and the benefit of $7$ would be at $t=4$, which is $4-1=3$ weeks away. The predicted utility of vaccinating at $t=1$, as seen from $t=0$, is:\n$$U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} (\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + (1) \\cdot \\delta^{4-1} (7) = -5 + \\delta^3 (7)$$\nThe alternative is not vaccinating at all, which yields a utility of $0$. The agent plans to vaccinate if $U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} > 0$.\nSubstituting $\\delta=0.99$:\n$$U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} = -5 + (0.99)^3 (7) = -5 + (0.970299)(7) = -5 + 6.792093 = 1.792093$$\nSince $1.792093 > 0$, the agent at $t=0$ predicts they will choose to vaccinate at $t=1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the utility of this plan (waiting and vaccinating at $t=1$) from the standpoint of $t=0$. This plan involves a cost of $5$ at $t=1$ and a benefit of $7$ at $t=4$. Both are future outcomes from the $t=0$ perspective.\n$$U_0(\\text{wait}) = \\beta \\delta^{1-0}(-5) + \\beta \\delta^{4-0}(7) = -5\\beta\\delta + 7\\beta\\delta^4$$\n\nTo determine the choice $x_0$, we compare $U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0)$ and $U_0(\\text{wait})$. The agent will wait if $U_0(\\text{wait}) > U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0)$.\nComparing the two utility expressions:\n$$-5\\beta\\delta + 7\\beta\\delta^4 > -5 + 7\\beta\\delta^4$$\nThis inequality simplifies to:\n$$-5\\beta\\delta > -5$$\nDividing by $-5$ and reversing the inequality sign:\n$$\\beta\\delta < 1$$\nUsing the given parameters, $\\beta\\delta = (0.7)(0.99) = 0.693$.\nSince $0.693 < 1$, the inequality holds. The agent prefers to wait.\nTherefore, the choice at $t=0$ is not to vaccinate. We have $x_0 = 0$.\n\n**2. The stated plan for next week, denoted by $p_1$**\n\nAs part of the analysis for the $t=0$ decision, we determined the agent's plan for $t=1$. This plan is based on the naive forecast that the future self will act with $\\beta=1$. We calculated the predicted utility of vaccinating at $t=1$ to be:\n$$U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} = -5 + \\delta^3 (7) \\approx 1.792 > 0$$\nSince the agent predicts that taking the action at $t=1$ yields a positive utility compared to the alternative of $0$, their plan is to vaccinate.\nThus, the stated plan for next week is $p_1 = 1$.\n\n**3. Dynamic inconsistency, quantified by $\\Delta = |p_1 - x_1|$**\n\nTo determine if there is dynamic inconsistency, we must find the agent's *actual* choice at $t=1$, denoted by $x_1$, and compare it to the plan $p_1$.\n\nAt time $t=1$, the agent re-evaluates the decision using their true present-biased preferences, with $\\beta = 0.7$. The choice is between vaccinating at $t=1$ or not.\n\nThe utility of vaccinating at $t=1$, evaluated from the perspective of $t=1$, involves an immediate cost of $5$ and a future benefit of $7$ at a delay of $3$ weeks.\n$$U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^{4-1}(7) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^3 (7)$$\nThe alternative is not to vaccinate, which has a utility of $0$. The agent will vaccinate if $U_1 > 0$.\nSubstituting the parameters $(\\beta, \\delta) = (0.7, 0.99)$:\n$$U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + (0.7)(0.99)^3(7) = -5 + (0.7)(0.970299)(7) = -5 + 4.7544651 = -0.2455349$$\nSince $U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) < 0$, the agent will choose not to vaccinate when the time actually comes.\nTherefore, the actual choice at $t=1$ is $x_1 = 0$.\n\nThe plan-doing mismatch is measured by $\\Delta$. The plan was $p_1=1$ and the actual choice is $x_1=0$.\n$$\\Delta = |p_1 - x_1| = |1 - 0| = 1$$\nA value of $\\Delta = 1$ indicates that dynamic inconsistency has occurred. The agent procrastinates, failing to follow through on their earlier plan.\n\nIn summary, the results are:\n- The choice today is $x_0 = 0$.\n- The plan for next week is $p_1 = 1$.\n- The dynamic inconsistency measure is $\\Delta = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(x_0, p_1, \\Delta)$.",

            "introduction": "The effectiveness of public health communication often depends not just on what information is conveyed, but how it is presented. This phenomenon, known as the framing effect, demonstrates that logically equivalent messages can lead to vastly different choices by altering risk perception. In this practice , you will apply a simple linear model to quantify how shifting from a percentage-based to a frequency-based risk format can change preventive screening uptake, a key skill in designing effective health campaigns.",
            "id": "4504421",
            "problem": "A public health agency is designing messages to inform adults about a preventive screening test that has a false positive rate. Two behaviorally equivalent framings are considered: a percentage format stating a false positive rate of $5\\%$ and a frequency format stating that there are $50$ false positives out of $1{,}000$ tests. Empirical evidence from risk communication suggests that, due to cognitive processing differences, the frequency format yields a lower perceived risk than the percentage format. Assume the following:\n\n- Under percentage framing, perceived risk equals the stated rate, so perceived risk is $r_{p} = 0.05$.\n- Under frequency framing, perceived risk is reduced by $25\\%$ relative to percentage framing, so $r_{f} = (1 - 0.25)\\,r_{p}$.\n- Screening uptake is governed by a linear response to perceived risk: if $U$ denotes the uptake proportion and $r$ denotes perceived risk, then $U = U_{0} + \\beta r$, where $U_{0}$ is a baseline uptake (independent of framing) and $\\beta$ is a constant slope parameter.\n- The slope parameter is $\\beta = -0.2$ (change in uptake per unit change in perceived risk), reflecting that higher perceived risk of false positives reduces uptake.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the linear model definition, derive the expected difference in uptake between the frequency and percentage formats, $U_{f} - U_{p}$, and compute its numerical value. Express your final answer as a decimal proportion with no units. Do not round; report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The screening uptake proportion, $U$, is described by a linear response model as a function of perceived risk, $r$:\n$$\nU = U_{0} + \\beta r\n$$\nwhere $U_{0}$ is the baseline uptake proportion and $\\beta$ is a constant slope parameter.\n\nWe are given two framing conditions: a percentage format and a frequency format. Let the subscripts $p$ and $f$ denote the percentage and frequency formats, respectively. The uptake proportions for each format are given by:\n$$\nU_{p} = U_{0} + \\beta r_{p}\n$$\n$$\nU_{f} = U_{0} + \\beta r_{f}\n$$\nHere, $r_{p}$ is the perceived risk under percentage framing, and $r_{f}$ is the perceived risk under frequency framing.\n\nThe objective is to find the difference in uptake between the two formats, $U_{f} - U_{p}$. We can express this difference by subtracting the expression for $U_{p}$ from the expression for $U_{f}$:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = (U_{0} + \\beta r_{f}) - (U_{0} + \\beta r_{p})\n$$\nThe baseline uptake $U_{0}$ is constant and independent of framing, so it cancels out:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = \\beta r_{f} - \\beta r_{p} = \\beta (r_{f} - r_{p})\n$$\nThe problem provides the values for the parameters.\nThe perceived risk under percentage framing corresponds to the stated rate of $5\\%$:\n$$\nr_{p} = 0.05\n$$\nThe perceived risk under frequency framing is stated to be reduced by $25\\%$ relative to the percentage framing. This relationship is given as:\n$$\nr_{f} = (1 - 0.25) r_{p} = 0.75 r_{p}\n$$\nNow, we can express the difference in perceived risks, $r_{f} - r_{p}$, in terms of $r_{p}$:\n$$\nr_{f} - r_{p} = 0.75 r_{p} - r_{p} = -0.25 r_{p}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the difference in uptake:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = \\beta (-0.25 r_{p})\n$$\nThe problem specifies the values for the slope parameter $\\beta$ and the perceived risk $r_{p}$:\n$$\n\\beta = -0.2\n$$\n$$\nr_{p} = 0.05\n$$\nWe substitute these numerical values into the expression for $U_{f} - U_{p}$:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = (-0.2) \\times (-0.25 \\times 0.05)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the product inside the parentheses:\n$$\n-0.25 \\times 0.05 = -0.0125\n$$\nThen, we multiply this result by $\\beta$:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = (-0.2) \\times (-0.0125)\n$$\nThe product of two negative numbers is positive:\n$$\nU_{f} - U_{p} = 0.0025\n$$\nThis result indicates that the uptake proportion under the frequency framing is expected to be $0.0025$ (or $0.25\\%$) higher than under the percentage framing. This is consistent with the initial assumption that the frequency format leads to a lower perceived risk, which in turn leads to a higher uptake given the negative slope parameter $\\beta$.",

            "problem": "A preventive medicine clinic is considering switching its immunization appointment policy from opt-in to opt-out with the aim of increasing vaccination uptake. The decision to vaccinate is modeled using the Random Utility Model (RUM), where each option’s total utility equals a deterministic component plus an unobserved component.

The deterministic utilities for the two options are: vaccination with utility $U_{v}=\\alpha-c$ and non-vaccination with utility $U_{n}=0$.
