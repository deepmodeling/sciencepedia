            "introduction": "Global health diplomacy frequently confronts the challenge of allocating scarce resources, such as vaccines, across diverse populations. This practice explores how abstract ethical principles guide these life-and-death decisions. By comparing an egalitarian rule (equal shares per person) with a prioritarian rule (weighted by need), you will quantify how different philosophical approaches to justice can lead to vastly different health outcomes, a core tension in international health cooperation.

            "problem": "A global health agency must allocate a fixed stock of preventive vaccine doses across three countries under two different global health diplomacy principles: an egalitarian per-capita rule and a prioritarian weighted rule. The vaccine targets a single infectious disease whose annual mortality risk varies across individuals. Assume independent risks (no herd effects) and that vaccination reduces an individual’s annual mortality risk from $r$ to $(1 - e) r$, where $e$ is the vaccine efficacy, so the expected lives saved per vaccinated individual is $e r$. Within each country, assume perfect risk targeting: available doses are allocated to the highest-risk group first, and only then to the lower-risk group.\n\nThe three countries have the following characteristics:\n- Country A: total population $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}$, high-risk fraction $p_{H,A} = 0.10$ with baseline annual mortality risk $r_{H,A} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, and low-risk baseline annual mortality risk $r_{L,A} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n- Country B: total population $N_{B} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}$, high-risk fraction $p_{H,B} = 0.05$ with $r_{H,B} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, and low-risk $r_{L,B} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n- Country C: total population $N_{C} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}$, high-risk fraction $p_{H,C} = 0.20$ with $r_{H,C} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, and low-risk $r_{L,C} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe vaccine efficacy is $e = 0.80$, and the total number of available doses is $S = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}$.\n\nTwo allocation rules are considered:\n1. Egalitarian per-capita rule: allocate doses to each country in proportion to its population $N_{i}$.\n2. Prioritarian weighted rule: allocate doses to each country in proportion to its aggregate high-risk expected mortality, defined as $W_{i} = N_{i} \\, p_{H,i} \\, r_{H,i}$.\n\nWithin each country, doses are first given to the high-risk group (size $H_{i} = N_{i} p_{H,i}$) and any remaining doses go to the low-risk group. Using the fundamental definition that expected lives saved from vaccinating $g$ individuals with baseline risk $r$ equals $e r g$, compute the total expected lives saved per year under each global allocation rule. Then compute the difference in total expected lives saved across all countries, defined as “prioritarian minus egalitarian.” Express the final difference as the number of lives saved (people). No rounding is necessary; treat all values as exact under these assumptions.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total expected lives saved under two different vaccine allocation schemes and the determination of the difference between them. The expected number of lives saved, $E$, by vaccinating a group of $V$ individuals with baseline annual mortality risk $r$ and a vaccine of efficacy $e$ is given by $e \\cdot r \\cdot V$.\n\nThe provided data for the three countries (A, B, C) are:\n- Country A: $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}$, $p_{H,A} = 0.10$, $r_{H,A} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $r_{L,A} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n- Country B: $N_{B} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}$, $p_{H,B} = 0.05$, $r_{H,B} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $r_{L,B} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n- Country C: $N_{C} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}$, $p_{H,C} = 0.20$, $r_{H,C} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $r_{L,C} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nThe vaccine efficacy is $e = 0.80$, and the total stock of doses is $S = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the size of the high-risk population in each country, $H_i = N_i p_{H,i}$.\n- $H_A = (5.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\cdot (0.10) = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $H_B = (3.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\cdot (0.05) = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $H_C = (2.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\cdot (0.20) = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n\n**1.

            "problem": "A novel respiratory pathogen is causing an international outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Country Y unilaterally imposes a $30$-day ban on all non-essential air travel from Country X, which has a rising incidence. The International Health Regulations (IHR) ($2005$) apply. Country Y does not notify WHO of the measure until $10$ days after implementation. Concurrently, Country Y requires airlines to transmit full passenger health declarations (including laboratory test results and contact details) for all attempted travelers from Country X, and stores these data for $12$ months for “future analysis.”\n\nBaseline data for Country Y’s inbound travel from Country X:\n- Average daily passenger volume is $N = 2000$.\n- The estimated prevalence of infectious travelers from Country X is $p = 0.01$ (that is, 1% test positivity among departing travelers).\n- Modeling suggests a full travel ban reduces importation by approximately 90% and delays local transmission onset by $5$ days.\n- A program of pre-departure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing reduces importation by 35%.\n- A $72$-hour monitored quarantine with release at negative exit test reduces importation by 70%.\n- These measures are assumed multiplicatively independent when combined.\n\nFundamental definitions and obligations relevant to this scenario include:\n- The International Health Regulations (IHR) ($2005$) Article $43$ (Additional health measures) requires that measures be based on scientific principles and available evidence, achieve an appropriate level of health protection, and not be more restrictive of international traffic or more invasive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of protection. Measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (defined in IHR as delays of more than $24$ hours) must be reported to WHO within $48$ hours.\n- The International Health Regulations (IHR) ($2005$) Article $45$ (Treatment of personal data) requires that personal health data collected under IHR be processed lawfully, limited to what is necessary for public health purposes, protected for confidentiality, and retained only as long as necessary for the purpose.\n\nUsing only the above foundational definitions and the provided scenario data, analyze whether Country Y’s unilateral travel ban violates Article $43$ and Article $45$ of IHR ($2005$). Then, construct an argument for proportionality, explicitly addressing suitability, necessity (including the existence of less restrictive alternatives), and overall balancing, based on the available evidence. Which option best reflects a scientifically grounded and regulation-consistent assessment?\n\nA. The $30$-day unilateral ban significantly interferes with international traffic and, absent timely WHO notification and given the existence of less restrictive alternatives with comparable effectiveness, likely violates Article $43$; the $12$-month retention of detailed passenger health data without demonstrated necessity likely violates Article $45$. A proportionate alternative is a layered approach combining pre-departure PCR testing and a $72$-hour quarantine, achieving roughly 80.5% importation reduction with substantially less restriction on traffic.\n\nB. The ban is compliant because it achieves a 90% reduction and any delay during a PHEIC justifies unilateral measures; WHO notification is unnecessary in emergencies, and long-term data retention is reasonable for research. Proportionality favors maximum restriction to ensure safety regardless of available alternatives.\n\nC. The ban violates Article $43$ only if Country Y’s hospital occupancy is above 90%; since occupancy is not specified, compliance cannot be assessed. Article $45$ is inapplicable because it addresses only laboratory biosafety, not passenger data. Proportionality is satisfied whenever a measure reduces importation more than testing alone.\n\nD. The ban does not violate Article $43$ because any measure that reduces importation by more than 50% is automatically proportionate; significant interference requires delays over $7$ days, so WHO notification within $48$ hours is unnecessary here. Article $45$ permits $12$-month retention for future analysis. The most proportionate approach is the full ban since entry screening alone yields only 35% reduction.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated first, followed by a full analysis if the statement is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Event:** A novel respiratory pathogen outbreak, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO.\n- **Action by Country Y:** Unilateral imposition of a $30$-day ban on all non-essential air travel from Country X.\n- **Reporting Delay:** Country Y notifies WHO $10$ days after implementation.\n- **Data Collection by Country Y:** Airlines must transmit passenger health declarations (lab tests, contact details) for all travelers from Country X. These data are stored for $12$ months for “future analysis.”\n- **Baseline Data:**\n    - Average daily passenger volume from Country X to Country Y: $N = 2000$.\n    - Prevalence of infectious travelers from Country X: $p = 0.01$ (i.e., $1\\%$).\n- **Effectiveness of Measures:**\n    - Full travel ban: Reduces importation by approximately 90%, delays local transmission by $5$ days.\n    - Pre-departure PCR testing: Reduces importation by 35%.\n    - $72$-hour monitored quarantine with negative exit test: Reduces importation by 70%.\n    - Assumption: The effectiveness of combined measures is multiplicatively independent.\n- **Relevant Legal Framework (IHR 2005):**\n    - **Article $43$ (Additional health measures):** Requires measures to be (i) based on scientific principles and evidence, (ii) achieve an appropriate level of health protection, and (iii) not be more restrictive of international traffic or invasive to persons than reasonably available alternatives. Measures causing significant interference (delay > $24$ hours) must be reported to WHO within $48$ hours.\n    - **Article $45$ (Treatment of personal data):** Requires personal data to be (i) processed lawfully and limited to what is necessary for public health, (ii) kept confidential, and (iii) retained only as long as necessary for the specified purpose.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in established principles of public health, epidemiology, and international health law (IHR $2005$). The use of epidemiological models, concepts like importation reduction, and legal articles like IHR Articles $43$ and $45$ are standard in this field. The numerical values are hypothetical but plausible for such a scenario. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear scenario, specific data, and relevant legal definitions, and asks for an analysis based solely on these inputs. A unique, logical conclusion can be derived by applying the given rules to the given facts.\n- **Objective:** The problem is framed objectively, presenting a scenario and asking for an analysis based on provided regulations and data. It avoids subjective or biased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a self-contained, logical, and scientifically grounded problem in the field of preventive medicine and global health diplomacy. The solution will proceed by analyzing the actions of Country Y against the provided articles of the IHR ($2005$).\n\n### Analysis of Country Y's Actions\n\nThe analysis will be conducted in two parts: compliance with Article $43$ and compliance with Article $45$, followed by a synthesis into a proportionality argument.\n\n**1. Compliance with IHR Article $43$ (Additional health measures)**\n\nArticle $43$ establishes several conditions for additional health measures.\n\n- **Significant Interference and Notification:** A $30$-day ban on all non-essential air travel is unequivocally a \"significant interference with international traffic,\" as it goes far beyond a delay of more than $24$ hours. According to IHR ($2005$), such measures must be reported to the WHO within $48$ hours of implementation. Country Y reported the measure $10$ days after implementation, which is a clear procedural violation of Article $43$.\n\n- **Proportionality and Least Restrictive Alternative:** Article $43$ requires that measures not be more restrictive than \"reasonably available alternatives\" that would achieve an \"appropriate level of health protection.\" We must compare the ban to other options.\n    - **Travel Ban:** Reduces importation by 90%. This is the most restrictive measure.\n    - **Available Alternatives:** The problem provides two alternatives:\n        1. Pre-departure PCR testing: 35% reduction.\n        2. $72$-hour quarantine with exit test: 70% reduction.\n    - **Combined Alternative:** The problem states these measures are multiplicatively independent. A layered approach combining PCR testing and quarantine would have a total reduction effectiveness ($R_{total}$) calculated as:\n    $$R_{total} = 1 - (1 - R_{PCR}) \\times (1 - R_{quarantine})$$\n    $$R_{total} = 1 - (1 - 0.35) \\times (1 - 0.70)$$\n    $$R_{total} = 1 - (0.65) \\times (0.30)$$\n    $$R_{total} = 1 - 0.195 = 0.805$$\n    This layered approach provides an importation reduction of 80.5%.\n\n- **Proportionality Test:**\n    - **Suitability:** The ban is suitable because it achieves the public health goal of reducing case importation (90% reduction).\n    - **Necessity (Least Restrictive Means):** The ban is not necessary. A reasonably available alternative (PCR testing + quarantine) exists that is substantially less restrictive than a total ban but achieves a comparable level of health protection (80.5% reduction vs. 90% reduction). The marginal benefit of the ban (an additional 9.5% reduction) comes at the cost of complete cessation of travel, which is a maximal restriction. The IHR framework favors the less restrictive option.\n    - **Balancing:** The harm caused by a full travel ban (economic, social, diplomatic) is immense. The benefit is a 90% reduction in imported cases and a $5$-day delay in transmission onset. The alternative provides a substantial 80.5% reduction while permitting travel to continue under controlled conditions. Given the high effectiveness of the less restrictive alternative, the total ban appears disproportionate.\n\n**Conclusion on Article $43$:** Country Y's travel ban likely violates Article $43$ on both procedural grounds (late notification) and substantive grounds (failure to use a less restrictive, reasonably available alternative with comparable effectiveness).\n\n**2. Compliance with IHR Article $45$ (Treatment of personal data)**\n\nArticle $45$ requires personal data to be retained \"only as long as necessary\" for the public health purpose.\n\n- **Purpose and Retention Period:** Country Y is retaining extensive personal health data (lab results, contact details) for $12$ months. The stated purpose is a vague \"future analysis.\" For purposes like contact tracing or verifying entry requirements, such a long retention period is not necessary. Data for contact tracing is typically needed for a duration related to the incubation period of the disease (e.g., a few weeks to a month). Holding data for $12$ months for an undefined \"analysis\" fails the test of necessity and data minimization central to Article $45$ and modern data protection principles.\n\n**Conclusion on Article $45$:** The $12$-month data retention policy, justified by a vague purpose, likely violates Article $45$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The $30$-day unilateral ban significantly interferes with international traffic and, absent timely WHO notification and given the existence of less restrictive alternatives with comparable effectiveness, likely violates Article $43$; the $12$-month retention of detailed passenger health data without demonstrated necessity likely violates Article $45$. A proportionate alternative is a layered approach combining pre-departure PCR testing and a $72$-hour quarantine, achieving roughly 80.5% importation reduction with substantially less restriction on traffic.**\n- This option correctly identifies the ban as \"significant interference.\"\n- It correctly notes the \"absent timely WHO notification\" ($10$ days vs. the required $48$ hours).\n- It correctly identifies the \"existence of less restrictive alternatives with comparable effectiveness.\"\n- Its conclusion that Article $43$ is likely violated is well-supported.\n- It correctly identifies the issue with the $12$-month data retention under Article $45$.\n- It correctly calculates the effectiveness of the layered approach ($1 - (1 - 0.35)(1 - 0.70) = 0.805$, or 80.5%).\nThis statement is fully consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The ban is compliant because it achieves a 90% reduction and any delay during a PHEIC justifies unilateral measures; WHO notification is unnecessary in emergencies, and long-term data retention is reasonable for research. Proportionality favors maximum restriction to ensure safety regardless of available alternatives.**\n- This option incorrectly claims high effectiveness (90%) automatically ensures compliance, ignoring the least restrictive alternative principle.\n- It incorrectly states that WHO notification is unnecessary in emergencies; the rule is the opposite.\n- It incorrectly dismisses Article $45$'s requirement for data minimization and necessity.\n- Its definition of proportionality (\"maximum restriction\") is the antithesis of the legal principle defined in Article $43$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The ban violates Article $43$ only if Country Y’s hospital occupancy is above 90%; since occupancy is not specified, compliance cannot be assessed. Article $45$ is inapplicable because it addresses only laboratory biosafety, not passenger data. Proportionality is satisfied whenever a measure reduces importation more than testing alone.**\n- This option introduces an external and arbitrary condition (hospital occupancy > 90%) not mentioned in the problem's definition of Article $43$.\n- It factually misrepresents Article $45$, which the problem text explicitly states applies to \"personal health data.\"\n- It uses a flawed and overly simplistic definition of proportionality, comparing the ban only to the weakest alternative.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The ban does not violate Article $43$ because any measure that reduces importation by more than 50% is automatically proportionate; significant interference requires delays over $7$ days, so WHO notification within $48$ hours is unnecessary here. Article $45$ permits $12$-month retention for future analysis. The most proportionate approach is the full ban since entry screening alone yields only 35% reduction.**\n- This option introduces an arbitrary threshold for proportionality (>50% reduction).\n- It misstates the definition of \"significant interference,\" which the problem gives as delays > $24$ hours, not $7$ days.\n- It incorrectly concludes that WHO notification was unnecessary.\n- It misinterprets Article $45$ regarding data retention.\n- It performs a flawed proportionality analysis by only comparing the ban to the weakest alternative (\"screening alone\"), ignoring the more effective combined alternative.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

This practice delves into the logistics of vaccine distribution, where every decision can impact the final mortality count. By developing a prioritized shipment schedule under multiple constraints—manufacturing, shipping, and local capacity—you will learn how to use quantitative modeling to optimize resource allocation and maximize the number of lives saved in an emergency.

            "problem": "A multilateral vaccine donation coordinated through global health diplomacy aims to minimize outbreak mortality across three recipient countries by allocating limited daily shipments. Consider Countries $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{B}$, and $\\mathrm{C}$ with high-risk target populations requiring a single-dose vaccine that confers immediate protection. Let the population sizes be $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $N_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$ persons, and let their constant daily mortality hazards (deaths per person per day while unvaccinated) be $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $r_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Assume no natural infection confers protection within the time horizon and that each vaccinated person’s daily hazard drops to negligible immediately upon receiving the dose.\n\nThe manufacturer produces $P$ doses per day, but the central cold-chain throughput limits shipments to $S$ doses per day. Each country $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$ can administer at most $c_i$ doses per day due to local cold-chain capacity. Shipments are delivered in time for start-of-day administration; individuals vaccinated on day $t$ are assumed to have waited exactly $t-1$ days. There is no carryover of unadministered doses at recipient sites, and there are no transit-time differences between countries.\n\nParameters are:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 60{,}000$, $N_{\\mathrm{B}} = 40{,}000$, $N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 30{,}000$.\n- $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}$, $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}$, $r_{\\mathrm{C}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n- $P = 50{,}000$, $S = 40{,}000$.\n- $c_{\\mathrm{A}} = 20{,}000$, $c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 10{,}000$, $c_{\\mathrm{C}} = 15{,}000$.\n\nDesign the daily shipment schedule over the minimum number of days needed to vaccinate all three populations using a simple prioritized queuing model grounded in preventive medicine risk: on any day, allocate shipments to the remaining unvaccinated groups to minimize cumulative expected mortality subject to the constraints $\\sum_{i} x_{i,t} \\leq S$, $x_{i,t} \\leq c_i$, and $0 \\leq x_{i,t} \\leq$ remaining need in country $i$, where $x_{i,t}$ is the number of doses administered in country $i$ on day $t$.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of expected deaths as the product of hazard and person-days unprotected, derive the allocation principle and compute the minimal cumulative expected deaths over the entire campaign. Express the final expected cumulative mortality in deaths, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "We begin from the preventive medicine definition that, under a constant daily mortality hazard, the expected number of deaths equals hazard multiplied by the total person-days of exposure. For country $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$ with daily hazard $r_i$ and a schedule that vaccinates $x_{i,t}$ persons at the start of day $t$, each of those persons has waited exactly $t-1$ days before immunization. The expected deaths contributed by those $x_{i,t}$ persons is therefore\n$$\nr_i \\cdot x_{i,t} \\cdot (t-1).\n$$\nSumming across days and countries, the total expected deaths $D$ over the campaign are\n$$\nD = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}\\}} \\sum_{t} r_i \\, x_{i,t} \\, (t-1).\n$$\n\nWe will choose $\\{x_{i,t}\\}$ to minimize $D$ subject to:\n- Daily central throughput: $\\sum_{i} x_{i,t} \\leq S$.\n- Local cold-chain capacity: $x_{i,t} \\leq c_i$.\n- Remaining need: $0 \\leq x_{i,t} \\leq R_{i,t}$, where $R_{i,t}$ is the remaining unvaccinated in country $i$ at the start of day $t$.\n\nKey principle from first definitions: vaccinating one dose in country $i$ one day earlier reduces expected deaths by $r_i$. Thus the marginal benefit (deaths averted per dose per day advanced) is $r_i$. To minimize the cumulative expected deaths, under fixed daily capacity, we should allocate earlier doses to the countries with the largest $r_i$, constrained by $c_i$ and remaining need. This follows by an exchange argument: consider two countries $i$ and $j$ with $r_i > r_j$. If a schedule allocates a dose to $j$ on day $t$ while leaving a feasible allocation to $i$ for day $t+1$ (i.e., $x_{i,t} < c_i$ and $R_{i,t} > 0$), swapping that one dose from $j$ at day $t$ to $i$ at day $t$ reduces the objective $D$ by\n$$\n\\Delta D = r_j \\cdot (t-1) - r_i \\cdot (t-1) = (t-1)(r_j - r_i) < 0,\n$$\nsince $r_j - r_i < 0$. Repeatedly applying such exchanges yields a schedule in which, on each day, doses are allocated first to the highest $r_i$ groups until their local capacity or remaining need binds, then to the next highest, and so on. Thus the prioritized queuing model is: allocate daily doses in descending order of $r_i$, subject to $x_{i,t} \\leq c_i$, $\\sum_i x_{i,t} \\leq S$, and remaining need.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}$ is the highest, then $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}$, then $r_{\\mathrm{C}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n- $c_{\\mathrm{B}} = 10{,}000$, $c_{\\mathrm{A}} = 20{,}000$, $c_{\\mathrm{C}} = 15{,}000$, and $S = 40{,}000$.\n- Initial needs: $R_{\\mathrm{A},1} = 60{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{B},1} = 40{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{C},1} = 30{,}000$.\n\nConstruct the day-by-day schedule:\n\nDay $1$ (priorities $\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$):\n- Allocate to $\\mathrm{B}$ up to $c_{\\mathrm{B}}$: $x_{\\mathrm{B},1} = 10{,}000$.\n- Remaining throughput: $40{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 30{,}000$.\n- Allocate to $\\mathrm{A}$ up to $c_{\\mathrm{A}}$: $x_{\\mathrm{A},1} = 20{,}000$.\n- Remaining throughput: $30{,}000 - 20{,}000 = 10{,}000$.\n- Allocate to $\\mathrm{C}$ up to remaining throughput and $c_{\\mathrm{C}}$: $x_{\\mathrm{C},1} = 10{,}000$.\n- Post-day $1$ remaining needs: $R_{\\mathrm{A},2} = 60{,}000 - 20{,}000 = 40{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{B},2} = 40{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 30{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{C},2} = 30{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 20{,}000$.\n\nDay $2$ (same priority order; capacities unchanged; remaining needs allow full allocations):\n- $x_{\\mathrm{B},2} = 10{,}000$, $x_{\\mathrm{A},2} = 20{,}000$, $x_{\\mathrm{C},2} = 10{,}000$.\n- Post-day $2$ remaining: $R_{\\mathrm{A},3} = 20{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{B},3} = 20{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{C},3} = 10{,}000$.\n\nDay $3$:\n- $x_{\\mathrm{B},3} = 10{,}000$, $x_{\\mathrm{A},3} = 20{,}000$, $x_{\\mathrm{C},3} = 10{,}000$.\n- Post-day $3$ remaining: $R_{\\mathrm{A},4} = 0$, $R_{\\mathrm{B},4} = 10{,}000$, $R_{\\mathrm{C},4} = 0$.\n\nDay $4$:\n- Only $\\mathrm{B}$ remains; allocate $x_{\\mathrm{B},4} = 10{,}000$ (well within $S$).\n- Campaign complete.\n\nCompute the total expected deaths using $D = \\sum_{i,t} r_i \\, x_{i,t} \\, (t-1)$.\n\nDay $1$: $t=1 \\Rightarrow (t-1) = 0$, so contributions are zero:\n- $\\mathrm{A}$: $r_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot 20{,}000 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- $\\mathrm{B}$: $r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- $\\mathrm{C}$: $r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nDay $2$: $t=2 \\Rightarrow (t-1) = 1$:\n- $\\mathrm{A}$: $r_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot 20{,}000 \\cdot 1 = \\left(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 20{,}000 = 0.4$.\n- $\\mathrm{B}$: $r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 1 = \\left(4 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 10{,}000 = 0.4$.\n- $\\mathrm{C}$: $r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 1 = \\left(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 10{,}000 = 0.1$.\n- Day $2$ subtotal: $0.4 + 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.9$.\n\nDay $3$: $t=3 \\Rightarrow (t-1) = 2$:\n- $\\mathrm{A}$: $r_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot 20{,}000 \\cdot 2 = \\left(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 40{,}000 = 0.8$.\n- $\\mathrm{B}$: $r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 2 = \\left(4 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 20{,}000 = 0.8$.\n- $\\mathrm{C}$: $r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 2 = \\left(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 20{,}000 = 0.2$.\n- Day $3$ subtotal: $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.8$.\n\nDay $4$: $t=4 \\Rightarrow (t-1) = 3$:\n- $\\mathrm{B}$: $r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 10{,}000 \\cdot 3 = \\left(4 \\times 10^{-5}\\right) \\cdot 30{,}000 = 1.2$.\n- Day $4$ subtotal: $1.2$.\n\nSumming all contributions,\n$$\nD = 0 + 0.9 + 1.8 + 1.2 = 3.9.\n$$\n\nAs a check, we can compute $D$ by person-days of exposure remaining after each start-of-day vaccination (equivalently summing $r_i$ times remaining unvaccinated for that day): after day $1$ vaccinations, remaining are $40{,}000$ in $\\mathrm{A}$, $30{,}000$ in $\\mathrm{B}$, $20{,}000$ in $\\mathrm{C}$, giving $0.8 + 1.2 + 0.2 = 2.2$ expected deaths for day $1$. After day $2$ vaccinations, remaining are $20{,}000$, $20{,}000$, and $10{,}000$, giving $0.4 + 0.8 + 0.1 = 1.3$ for day $2$. After day $3$ vaccinations, remaining are $0$, $10{,}000$, and $0$, giving $0.4$ for day $3$. Total $2.2 + 1.3 + 0.4 = 3.9$, consistent.\n\nTherefore, under the prioritized queuing allocation derived from first principles and subject to the manufacturing and cold-chain constraints, the minimal cumulative expected mortality over the campaign is $3.9$ deaths. Rounding to four significant figures yields $3.900$ deaths as requested.",
