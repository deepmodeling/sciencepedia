This practice delves into herd immunity, a cornerstone of modern vaccination strategy, which occurs when a sufficient portion of a population is immune to an infection, thereby providing indirect protection to those who are not immune. By working through the calculation of a minimum vaccination coverage target using the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and vaccine effectiveness, you will gain hands-on experience in how governments use fundamental epidemiological models to set evidence-based policy goals for national immunization programs .",

            "problem": "A national public health agency is setting a vaccination coverage target as part of a government-led infectious disease control program. Consider a pathogen with a Basic Reproduction Number (BRN, denoted $R_0$) and a mass vaccination campaign using a vaccine whose Vaccine Effectiveness against infection (VE) is the proportional reduction in susceptibility among vaccinated individuals relative to unvaccinated individuals. Assume homogeneous mixing, that vaccination is randomly distributed in the population, and that vaccine action is limited to reducing susceptibility to infection (that is, it does not change the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected).\n\nStarting from the core epidemiological definition that the Effective Reproduction Number (denoted $R_e$) equals the product of the Basic Reproduction Number and the average fraction of the population that remains susceptible, herd immunity is achieved when $R_e1$. Use this principle and the above assumptions to derive the minimum vaccination coverage fraction, denoted $c_{\\min}$, required for herd immunity in terms of $R_0$ and VE. Then, evaluate this expression for $R_0=4$ and $\\text{VE}=0.80$. Express your final answer for the minimum coverage as a fraction or a decimal number. Do not use a percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions. All necessary definitions and parameters are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the minimum vaccination coverage, $c_{\\min}$, required to achieve herd immunity and then to evaluate it for the given parameters. The condition for herd immunity is that the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, must be less than $1$. The threshold for minimum coverage is therefore found by setting $R_e = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the effective reproduction number is the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the average fraction of the population that remains susceptible, which we will denote as $S_{avg}$.\n$$R_e = R_0 \\times S_{avg}$$\n\nWe must first determine the expression for $S_{avg}$. Let $c$ be the fraction of the population that is vaccinated. The fraction that is unvaccinated is then $(1-c)$. The population is thus divided into two groups.\n\nThe susceptibility of each group must be defined. We can set the relative susceptibility of an unvaccinated individual to $1$. The problem defines Vaccine Effectiveness, VE, as the proportional reduction in susceptibility for vaccinated individuals. If $S_u$ is the susceptibility of the unvaccinated and $S_v$ is the susceptibility of the vaccinated, then:\n$$\\text{VE} = \\frac{S_u - S_v}{S_u}$$\nSetting the baseline susceptibility of the unvaccinated to $S_u = 1$, the susceptibility of a vaccinated individual, $S_v$, becomes:\n$$\\text{VE} = \\frac{1 - S_v}{1} \\implies S_v = 1 - \\text{VE}$$\n\nThe average susceptibility of the entire population, $S_{avg}$, is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of the two groups, where the weights are the fractions of the population in each group.\n$$S_{avg} = (\\text{fraction unvaccinated}) \\times S_u + (\\text{fraction vaccinated}) \\times S_v$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fractions and susceptibilities:\n$$S_{avg} = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot (1 - \\text{VE})$$\nThis expression simplifies to:\n$$S_{avg} = 1 - c + c - c \\cdot \\text{VE}$$\n$$S_{avg} = 1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $S_{avg}$ back into the equation for $R_e$:\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE})$$\n\nTo find the minimum vaccination coverage, $c_{\\min}$, that ensures herd immunity ($R_e  1$), we solve for the critical threshold where $R_e = 1$.\n$$1 = R_0 (1 - c_{\\min} \\cdot \\text{VE})$$\nWe can now solve this equation for $c_{\\min}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - c_{\\min} \\cdot \\text{VE}$$\n$$c_{\\min} \\cdot \\text{VE} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{\\text{VE}}$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}}{\\text{VE}} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot \\text{VE}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the minimum vaccination coverage required for herd immunity, given a vaccine that is not perfectly effective at preventing infection.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate this expression for the given values: the Basic Reproduction Number $R_0 = 4$ and the Vaccine Effectiveness $\\text{VE} = 0.80$.\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{4 - 1}{4 \\cdot 0.80}$$\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{3}{3.2}$$\nTo express this as a simple fraction or decimal, we can write:\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{32}{10}} = \\frac{30}{32} = \\frac{15}{16}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$c_{\\min} = 0.9375$$\nThis means that a minimum of $93.75\\%$ of the population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity under the given conditions.",

The program would be scaled nationally if it is considered cost-effective under the ministry’s explicit willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The evaluation uses the following widely accepted foundations in public decision-making for preventive medicine: (i) a QALY (quality-adjusted life year) is a measure of health benefit that combines length and quality of life; (ii) the incremental cost $\\Delta C$ is the additional cost of the new program relative to current practice; (iii) the incremental effect $\\Delta E$ is the additional QALYs gained by the new program relative to current practice; and (iv) a central decision rule in government health technology assessment is to compare the value of health gained to its cost using a willingness-to-pay threshold per QALY.\n\nFor this program, the best available evidence indicates an incremental cost of $\\Delta C = \\$5,000$ per person and an incremental effect of $\\Delta E = 0.2$ QALYs per person.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of health economics, specifically cost-effectiveness analysis, a standard methodology for public health decision-making.

It is a valid microeconomic problem based on established principles of welfare economics applied to public health.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the optimal per-unit Pigouvian tax and the resulting new level of antibiotic consumption. We will address each in turn.\n\nLet $Q$ be the quantity of antibiotics consumed in Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per $1,000$ inhabitants, and let $P$ be the price in United States Dollars (USD) per DDD.

The goal is to align the private cost faced by consumers with the true social cost of their consumption.\n\nBy imposing a tax $t$, the new price faced by the consumer, $P_1$, becomes $P_1 = PMC + t$. For the private decision-maker to face the full social marginal cost, this new price must be equal to the social marginal cost.\n$$P_1 = SMC$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_1$ and $SMC$:\n$$PMC + t = PMC + MEC$$\nThis directly implies that the optimal tax, $t^*$, must be equal to the marginal external cost.\n$$t^* = MEC$$\nThe problem states that the $MEC$ is constant and equal to $10$ USD per DDD.
