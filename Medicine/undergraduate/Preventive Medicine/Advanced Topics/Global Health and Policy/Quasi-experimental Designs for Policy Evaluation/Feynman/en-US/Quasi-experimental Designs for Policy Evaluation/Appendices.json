This exercise walks you through the fundamental calculation of the DID estimator, demonstrating how to isolate a policy's impact by comparing the change in an outcome for a treated group to the change in a control group. Mastering this core calculation is the first step toward understanding how to control for time-varying factors that could otherwise confound your results. ",

            "problem": "A regional public health authority implemented a new preventive policy in year $t=\\text{post}$: free community influenza vaccination clinics targeting high-risk adults. A neighboring region did not implement this policy and serves as a comparison. Let $g \\in \\{\\text{treated}, \\text{control}\\}$ denote the group (treated region or control region), and let $t \\in \\{\\text{pre}, \\text{post}\\}$ denote the period (before or after the policy). Define the potential outcome $Y_{gt}(1)$ as the influenza-associated hospitalization rate (per $100{,}000$ population) that would be observed for group $g$ at time $t$ if the policy were implemented, and $Y_{gt}(0)$ as the rate if the policy were not implemented. Assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) and that the parallel trends condition holds for untreated potential outcomes, meaning that the expected change in $Y_{gt}(0)$ from $t=\\text{pre}$ to $t=\\text{post}$ is the same for $g=\\text{treated}$ and $g=\\text{control}$. Under these premises, use the observed group-time mean hospitalization rates and the logic of causal identification to derive an expression for the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}}$ of the average treatment effect on the treated, and then compute its numerical value.\n\nThe observed mean influenza-associated hospitalization rates (per $100{,}000$ population) are:\n- Treated region, pre-policy: $22.4$\n- Treated region, post-policy: $16.1$\n- Control region, pre-policy: $20.7$\n- Control region, post-policy: $19.8$\n\nCompute $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}}$ using only these group means, and briefly indicate whether the policy increased or decreased hospitalization rates based on the sign of your estimate.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). The analysis is based on a quasi-experimental design involving a treated group and a control group, observed before and after a policy intervention.\n\nFirst, we define the parameter of interest. The average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is the expected effect of the policy on the group that actually received it ($g=\\text{treated}$), in the period when they received it ($t=\\text{post}$). Using the potential outcomes framework, the ATT, denoted as $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$, is defined as the difference between the expected potential outcome under treatment and the expected potential outcome under no treatment, for the treated group in the post-policy period:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{ATT}} = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1) - Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]\n$$\nHere, $Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)$ is the potential outcome for the treated group in the post period with the policy, and $Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)$ is the potential outcome for the same group and period without the policy.\n\nThe core challenge in estimating $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$ is that the term $E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]$ represents a counterfactual state; we cannot observe what would have happened to the treated group in the post-policy period if they had not received the treatment. The DID method allows us to estimate this counterfactual quantity using the available data and a key assumption.\n\nThe observed outcomes are related to the potential outcomes as follows:\n- For the treated group in the post period: $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}}] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)]$.\n- For the treated group in the pre period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)]$.\n- For the control group in the post period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}}] = E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)]$.\n- For the control group in the pre period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}}] = E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]$.\n\nThe problem states to assume the parallel trends condition holds for untreated potential outcomes. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the policy, the expected change in the outcome from the pre-policy period to the post-policy period would have been the same for both the treated and control groups. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nE[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0) - Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] = E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0) - Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unobservable counterfactual term, $E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]$:\n$$\nE[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] + E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]\n$$\nThis equation provides an expression for the expected outcome of the treated group in the post-period had they not received the treatment. It is constructed from the treated group's baseline level ($E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)]$) plus the secular trend observed in the control group ($E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]$).\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for the counterfactual back into the definition of $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{ATT}} = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)] - \\left( E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] + E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)] \\right)\n$$\nThe DID estimator, $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}}$, is the sample analog of this expression, where we replace the expectations with the observed sample means, denoted by $\\bar{Y}_{gt}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\left( \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}} + \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the standard formula for the DID estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = (\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}) - (\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}})\n$$\nThis expression represents the difference in the change over time for the treated group minus the change over time for the control group.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- Treated region, pre-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}$): $22.4$\n- Treated region, post-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}}$): $16.1$\n- Control region, pre-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}}$): $20.7$\n- Control region, post-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}}$): $19.8$\n\nFirst, calculate the change in hospitalization rates for the treated group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{treated}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}} = 16.1 - 22.4 = -6.3\n$$\nNext, calculate the change in hospitalization rates for the control group. This represents the secular trend that would have affected both groups in the absence of the policy.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{control}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}} = 19.8 - 20.7 = -0.9\n$$\nFinally, compute the DID estimator by subtracting the control group's change from the treated group's change:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = \\Delta_{\\text{treated}} - \\Delta_{\\text{control}} = (-6.3) - (-0.9) = -6.3 + 0.9 = -5.4\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The result is $-5.40$. The negative sign indicates that the policy is estimated to have caused a decrease in the influenza-associated hospitalization rate. The magnitude of the effect is a reduction of $5.40$ hospitalizations per $100{,}000$ population for the treated region, compared to what would have been expected without the policy, according to this model.",

            "introduction": "A key challenge in policy evaluation is ensuring an observed association is truly causal and not the result of confounding factors. This practice introduces a powerful falsification test using a \"negative control outcome\"—an outcome that theory suggests should not be affected by the policy. By applying the DID method to this negative control, you can powerfully probe the validity of your research design's core assumptions; a non-zero finding on the control outcome can signal that your primary result may be biased.

            "problem": "A regional preventive medicine division is evaluating the impact of a comprehensive indoor smoke-free law implemented in City $S$ on adult respiratory hospital admissions. City $U$ did not adopt the law and serves as a comparison. To probe whether the estimated association for respiratory admissions could be driven by residual confounding rather than a causal effect, the division proposes a falsification test using a negative control outcome: adult orthopedic hospital admissions per $100{,}000$ population per month, which, under standard clinical knowledge, is unlikely to be affected by indoor smoking restrictions in the short run.\n\nAssume the following foundational base:\n- In the potential outcomes framework, for unit $i$ at time $t$, the causal effect is defined as the contrast between the potential outcomes $Y_{it}(1)$ under treatment and $Y_{it}(0)$ under no treatment. A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design identifies the average treatment effect on the treated under the parallel trends assumption, which states that, absent treatment, the treated and comparison groups would have experienced the same change over time in the expected outcome.\n- A valid negative control outcome $Z$ satisfies $Z_{it}(1) = Z_{it}(0)$ for all $i$ and $t$; therefore, any estimated treatment effect on $Z$ should be $0$ if identification conditions hold.\n\nThe division collected monthly adult orthopedic admission rates per $100{,}000$ for $6$ pre-policy months and $6$ post-policy months. For City $S$ (treated), the pre-policy series is $\\{120, 121, 119, 122, 120, 121\\}$ and the post-policy series is $\\{130, 129, 131, 130, 129, 130\\}$. For City $U$ (comparison), the pre-policy series is $\\{115, 114, 116, 115, 115, 116\\}$ and the post-policy series is $\\{120, 119, 121, 120, 119, 120\\}$. Assume monthly observations within each period are independent and identically distributed and that inference can proceed using a two-sample difference-in-means approximation on the monthly between-city differences.\n\nTask:\n1. Construct the falsification test by computing the difference-in-differences estimate for the orthopedic outcome (i.e., change over time in City $S$ minus change over time in City $U$). Then compute the standard error of this estimate using the sample variances of the monthly between-city differences in the pre-policy and post-policy periods, and form a $t$-statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no effect on the negative control outcome at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n2. Interpret what a statistically significant nonzero effect on this negative control outcome implies for the causal interpretation of any observed association on respiratory admissions.\n\nWhich option best captures the correct interpretation based on this falsification test?\n\nA. The falsification test reveals a significant change in orthopedic admissions coincident with the policy; this undermines a causal interpretation of the respiratory association by indicating violations of parallel trends or concurrent systemic changes, and the evaluation should strengthen identification (e.g., add controls, check pre-trends, or use alternative comparison groups).\n\nB. The significant change in orthopedic admissions strengthens the causal claim for respiratory admissions, because it demonstrates broad beneficial impacts of the policy across multiple outcomes.\n\nC. Any nonzero effect detected for the orthopedic outcome is expected sampling variability with small monthly samples and does not affect the causal interpretation; the respiratory association can be considered robust without further checks.\n\nD. The significant change in orthopedic admissions indicates a direct mechanism by which the smoke-free law increases orthopedic admissions (e.g., resource substitution), so the respiratory association remains valid and unaffected by the falsification test.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in the domain of quasi-experimental policy evaluation and requires a quantitative falsification test to be performed and interpreted. The problem statement must first be validated for scientific and logical soundness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Context**: Evaluation of an indoor smoke-free law in City $S$ (treated) versus City $U$ (comparison).\n-   **Primary Outcome**: Adult respiratory hospital admissions (not used in the calculation, but relevant for interpretation).\n-   **Negative Control Outcome ($Z$)**: Adult orthopedic hospital admissions per $100{,}000$ population per month.\n-   **Data Periods**: $6$ pre-policy months and $6$ post-policy months. Let $n_{pre} = 6$ and $n_{post} = 6$.\n-   **Data for City $S$ (Treated)**:\n    -   Pre-policy ($Y_{S, pre}$): $\\{120, 121, 119, 122, 120, 121\\}$\n    -   Post-policy ($Y_{S, post}$): $\\{130, 129, 131, 130, 129, 130\\}$\n-   **Data for City $U$ (Comparison)**:\n    -   Pre-policy ($Y_{U, pre}$): $\\{115, 114, 116, 115, 115, 116\\}$\n    -   Post-policy ($Y_{U, post}$): $\\{120, 119, 121, 120, 119, 120\\}$\n-   **Methodological Framework**:\n    -   Potential outcomes framework where the causal effect is $Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0)$.\n    -   Difference-in-differences (DiD) design to identify the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).\n    -   Key assumption for DiD: Parallel trends.\n    -   Definition of a valid negative control: True causal effect is zero ($Z_{it}(1) = Z_{it}(0)$).\n-   **Statistical Instructions**:\n    -   Assume monthly observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) within each period.\n    -   Inference is to be performed using a two-sample difference-in-means on the monthly between-city differences.\n    -   Significance level for hypothesis testing: $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n-   **Task**:\n    1.

Interpret the result regarding the causal claim for the primary (respiratory) outcome.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is well-grounded in standard econometric and biostatistical methods for causal inference. The use of a Difference-in-Differences design, the potential outcomes framework, the parallel trends assumption, and falsification testing with a negative control outcome are all established and scientifically valid concepts. The choice of orthopedic admissions as a negative control for a smoking ban is clinically plausible.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and specifies a clear, albeit slightly stylized, procedure for calculation and inference (\"two-sample difference-in-means approximation on the monthly between-city differences\"). This leads to a unique numerical answer.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language.\n-   **Consistency Check**: The instruction to perform inference on the \"monthly between-city differences\" is a valid method for calculating the DiD estimator. Let $D_t = Y_{S,t} - Y_{U,t}$ be the difference at time $t$. The DiD estimator is $(\\mathbb{E}[Y_{S,post}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{S,pre}]) - (\\mathbb{E}[Y_{U,post}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{U,pre}])$, which can be rearranged by linearity of expectation to $\\mathbb{E}[Y_{S,post} - Y_{U,post}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{S,pre} - Y_{U,pre}]$. This is equivalent to $\\mathbb{E}[D_{post}] - \\mathbb{E}[D_{pre}]$. The instructions are therefore mathematically consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is valid. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task involves a falsification test. We must calculate the difference-in-differences (DiD) estimate for the negative control outcome (orthopedic admissions) and test if it is statistically different from zero. A significant non-zero estimate would suggest the DiD design is biased.\n\n**1. Construct the Between-City Difference Series**\n\nAs per the instructions, we first calculate the monthly difference in admission rates between City $S$ and City $U$, $D_t = Y_{S,t} - Y_{U,t}$, for the pre-policy and post-policy periods.\n\n-   Pre-policy differences, $D_{pre}$:\n    $\\{120-115, 121-114, 119-116, 122-115, 120-115, 121-116\\} = \\{5, 7, 3, 7, 5, 5\\}$\n-   Post-policy differences, $D_{post}$:\n    $\\{130-120, 129-119, 131-121, 130-120, 129-119, 130-120\\} = \\{10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10\\}$\n\nThe sample sizes are $n_{pre} = 6$ and $n_{post} = 6$.\n\n**2. Compute the DiD Estimate**\n\nThe DiD estimate, $\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD}$, is the difference between the mean of the post-policy differences and the mean of the pre-policy differences.\n\n-   Mean of pre-policy differences:\n    $\\bar{D}_{pre} = \\frac{5+7+3+7+5+5}{6} = \\frac{32}{6} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.33$\n-   Mean of post-policy differences:\n    $\\bar{D}_{post} = \\frac{10+10+10+10+10+10}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10$\n-   DiD estimate:\n    $\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = \\bar{D}_{post} - \\bar{D}_{pre} = 10 - \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{30-16}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} \\approx 4.67$\n\n**3. Compute the Standard Error and t-Statistic**\n\nWe test the null hypothesis $H_0: \\delta_{DiD} = 0$. The test statistic is $t = \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD}}{SE(\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD})}$. We use a two-sample t-test for independent samples on the series $D_{pre}$ and $D_{post}$. The standard error is given by $SE(\\bar{D}_{post} - \\bar{D}_{pre}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_{pre}^2}{n_{pre}} + \\frac{s_{post}^2}{n_{post}}}$.\n\n-   Calculate the sample variance for $D_{pre}$:\n    $s_{pre}^2 = \\frac{1}{n_{pre}-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{pre}} (D_{i,pre} - \\bar{D}_{pre})^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ \\left(5-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(7-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(3-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(7-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(5-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(5-\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 \\right]$\n    $s_{pre}^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\right]$\n    $s_{pre}^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{25}{9} + \\frac{49}{9} + \\frac{25}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} \\right] = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{102}{9} \\right) = \\frac{102}{45} = \\frac{34}{15} \\approx 2.267$\n\n-   Calculate the sample variance for $D_{post}$:\n    Since all values in $D_{post}$ are $10$, the mean is $10$ and all deviations from the mean are $0$.\n    $s_{post}^2 = 0$\n\n-   Compute the standard error:\n    $SE(\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{34/15}{6} + \\frac{0}{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{34}{90}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{45}} \\approx 0.6146$\n\n-   Compute the $t$-statistic:\n    $t = \\frac{14/3}{\\sqrt{17/45}} = \\frac{14}{3} \\frac{\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{17}} = \\frac{14}{3} \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{17}} = 14 \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{17}} \\approx 7.59$\n\n**4. Perform the Hypothesis Test**\n\nTo determine if the result is statistically significant at $\\alpha = 0.05$, we compare the calculated $t$-statistic to the critical value from a $t$-distribution. The degrees of freedom ($df$) for the Welch's $t$-test are given by the Satterthwaite approximation. Since $s_{post}^2=0$, the formula simplifies to $df = n_{pre}-1 = 6-1=5$.\n\nThe critical value for a two-tailed test with $\\alpha=0.05$ and $df=5$ is $t_{crit} = 2.571$.\n\nSince $|t| = |7.59| > 2.571$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. The DiD estimate for orthopedic admissions is statistically significantly different from zero.\n\n**5. Interpretation**\n\nThe purpose of a negative control outcome is to test the core identifying assumption of the DiD model, which is the parallel trends assumption. This assumption states that, in the absence of the treatment, the outcome trend in the treated group would have been the same as the outcome trend in the comparison group. For a valid negative control, the true treatment effect is known to be zero. Therefore, if the DiD estimator yields a non-zero result, it must be due to bias arising from a violation of the parallel trends assumption (or some other confounding factor coincident with the policy).\n\nOur test has found a statistically significant non-zero effect ($\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} \\approx 4.67$, $p \\ll 0.05$) on orthopedic admissions. This is a \"failed\" falsification test. It suggests that City $S$ and City $U$ were on different trajectories for hospital admissions for reasons unrelated to the smoke-free law. This finding severely undermines the credibility of the DiD design as applied here. If the parallel trends assumption does not hold for orthopedic admissions, it is highly suspect for respiratory admissions as well, as the same unobserved confounding factors (e.g., demographic shifts, economic changes, changes in hospital administration) are likely to affect both outcomes. Consequently, any estimated effect on respiratory admissions cannot be confidently attributed to the smoke-free law; it could be partially or wholly an artifact of this underlying differential trend.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The falsification test reveals a significant change in orthopedic admissions coincident with the policy; this undermines a causal interpretation of the respiratory association by indicating violations of parallel trends or concurrent systemic changes, and the evaluation should strengthen identification (e.g., add controls, check pre-trends, or use alternative comparison groups).**\nThis option accurately summarizes the findings and their implications. The calculation shows a significant change. This finding does undermine the causal interpretation for the primary outcome by casting doubt on the parallel trends assumption. The suggested remedies are appropriate next steps in a methodologically sound evaluation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The significant change in orthopedic admissions strengthens the causal claim for respiratory admissions, because it demonstrates broad beneficial impacts of the policy across multiple outcomes.**\nThis fundamentally misinterprets the role of a negative control outcome. An effect is not expected; finding one is a sign of a flawed research design, not a widespread policy effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Any nonzero effect detected for the orthopedic outcome is expected sampling variability with small monthly samples and does not affect the causal interpretation; the respiratory association can be considered robust without further checks.**\nThis option incorrectly dismisses a statistically significant result as \"expected sampling variability.\" The purpose of a hypothesis test is to quantify the likelihood that an observed effect is due to chance. With a $t$-statistic of approximately $7.59$, the probability of observing such a large effect by chance under the null hypothesis is extremely low, far below the $\\alpha=0.05$ threshold. The finding is not due to sampling variability alone and it absolutely affects the causal interpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The significant change in orthopedic admissions indicates a direct mechanism by which the smoke-free law increases orthopedic admissions (e.g., resource substitution), so the respiratory association remains valid and unaffected by the falsification test.**\nThis option engages in post-hoc speculation to explain away an inconvenient finding. The premise of selecting a negative control is the strong prior belief that no such direct mechanism exists. While one cannot rule out an unknown mechanism, the most standard and parsimonious interpretation is that the study's identifying assumption is violated. Claiming the respiratory association remains \"valid and unaffected\" is incorrect; the falsification test has cast doubt on the validity of the entire DiD framework for this specific comparison.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The observed outcome satisfies\n$$\nY = Y(0) + D \\cdot \\big(Y(1) - Y(0)\\big).\n$$\nTaking conditional expectations given the running variable $X = x$ yields\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid X = x] + \\mathbb{E}[D \\cdot (Y(1) - Y(0)) \\mid X = x].\n$$\nUnder the standard fuzzy RD assumptions:\n- The functions $\\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid X = x]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid X = x]$ are continuous at $x = c$.\n- The probability of treatment $\\mathbb{E}[D \\mid X = x]$ has a discontinuity at $x = c$ due to the threshold rule.\n- Monotonicity (no defiers) ensures that individuals who change treatment status at the cutoff are compliers.\n\nTaking the difference of the right- and left-hand limits at $x = c$ and using continuity of the potential outcomes, we obtain that the discontinuity in the observed outcome is attributable to the discontinuity in the treatment probability times the average causal effect for compliers at the cutoff. This yields the Wald estimand:\n$$\n\\text{LATE at } c \\;=\\; \\frac{\\lim_{x \\to c^{+}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] - \\lim_{x \\to c^{-}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x]}{\\lim_{x \\to c^{+}} \\mathbb{E}[D \\mid X = x] - \\lim_{x \\to c^{-}} \\mathbb{E}[D \\mid X = x]}.\n$$\n\nWe now plug in the provided estimates at $c = 30$:\n- Outcome discontinuity:\n$$\n\\Delta Y \\equiv \\lim_{x \\to 30^{+}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] - \\lim_{x \\to 30^{-}} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] = 29.91 - 30.12 = -0.21.\n$$\n- Treatment discontinuity:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\equiv \\lim_{x \\to 30^{+}} \\mathbb{E}[D \\mid X = x] - \\lim_{x \\to 30^{-}} \\mathbb{E}[D \\mid X = x] = 0.61 - 0.19 = 0.42.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the local average treatment effect at the cutoff is\n$$\n\\text{LATE} = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta D} = \\frac{-0.21}{0.42} = -0.5.\n$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures gives $-0.500$ in BMI units.\n\nInterpretation: Among patients whose treatment status is influenced by crossing the BMI threshold at $30$ (the compliers), receiving counseling reduces twelve-month BMI by approximately $0.5$ BMI units on average, locally at the cutoff.",
