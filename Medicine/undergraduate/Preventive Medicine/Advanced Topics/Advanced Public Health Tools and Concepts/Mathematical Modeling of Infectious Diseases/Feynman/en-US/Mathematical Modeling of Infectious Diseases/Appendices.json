We can derive this quantity by considering the chain of events that leads to an infection.\n\n1.  **Rate of contact:** A single individual makes $c$ contacts per day.\n2.  **Probability of a contact being infectious:** The population consists of $N$ individuals, of whom $I(t)$ are infectious at time $t$. Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing, any given contact is with an infectious person with probability $\\frac{I(t)}{N}$.\n3.  **Rate of contact with infectious individuals:** For a single susceptible person, the rate of making contact with infectious individuals is the total contact rate multiplied by the probability that a contact is infectious.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of infectious contacts} = c \\times \\frac{I(t)}{N}\n    $$\n4.  **Probability of transmission:** Each contact with an infectious individual leads to transmission with a probability $p$.\n\nThe force of infection, $\\lambda(t)$, is an instantaneous rate. In this context, it is the product of the rate of infectious contacts and the probability of transmission per contact. This models the process as a series of independent probabilistic events occurring at a certain rate.\n\nTherefore, the expression for the force of infection is:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = c \\cdot p \\cdot \\frac{I(t)}{N}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the value of $\\lambda(t)$.\nThe given values are:\n-   Contact rate, $c = 12 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n-   Transmission probability, $p = 0.02$\n-   Number of infectious individuals, $I(t) = 1000$\n-   Total population size, $N = 10^{6}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = 12 \\times 0.02 \\times \\frac{1000}{10^{6}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = 0.24 \\times \\frac{10^{3}}{10^{6}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = 0.24 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{day}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected number of new infections per day at time $t$.

            "problem": "A closed human community with fixed population size $N$ experiences the introduction of a novel acute infectious agent that follows the Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) compartmental dynamics, where individuals transition from susceptible to infectious upon effective contact and from infectious to removed upon recovery. Assume no demography (no births or non-disease deaths during the short epidemic timescale), homogeneous mixing, and that the average infectious period is $1/\\gamma$ with $\\gamma > 0$. Let the transmission parameter be $\\beta > 0$, and consider two plausible incidence assumptions used in preventive medicine and mathematical epidemiology:\n\n- Density-dependent (mass-action) incidence: the force of infection scales with the product $S I$.\n- Frequency-dependent (standard) incidence: the force of infection scales with $S I / N$.\n\nImmediately after introduction, suppose $I(0) \\ll N$ and $S(0) \\approx N$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the epidemic threshold for a Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) model under two different assumptions for the incidence rate: density-dependent and frequency-dependent. The threshold condition determines whether an epidemic will grow or die out upon introduction of an infectious agent into a susceptible population.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing differential equations for the number of infectious individuals, $I(t)$. The state variables are $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$, representing the number of individuals in the susceptible, infectious, and removed compartments, respectively. The total population size $N$ is constant, such that $N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)$. The rate at which infectious individuals are removed (e.g., through recovery and gaining immunity) is given by $\\gamma I(t)$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is the removal rate and $1/\\gamma$ is the average infectious period.\n\nThe initial condition for an emerging epidemic is characterized by a very small number of infectious individuals, $I(0) > 0$, and a population that is almost entirely susceptible, so that $S(0) \\approx N$. The condition for an epidemic to take hold is that the number of infectious individuals must initially increase, i.e., $\\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0} > 0$.\n\nCase 1: Density-Dependent (Mass-Action) Incidence\nUnder this assumption, the rate of new infections is proportional to the product of the densities of susceptible and infectious individuals. In a model with population numbers rather than densities, this is formalized as being proportional to the product of the numbers of individuals, $S$ and $I$. The rate of new infections is $\\beta S I$, where $\\beta > 0$ is the transmission parameter. The differential equation for the infectious compartment is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\text{rate of infection} - \\text{rate of removal} = \\beta S(t) I(t) - \\gamma I(t) $$\nWe can factor out $I(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = I(t) (\\beta S(t) - \\gamma) $$\nTo assess the initial growth, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0} = I(0) (\\beta S(0) - \\gamma) $$\nFor the epidemic to grow, we require $\\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0} > 0$. Since $I(0) > 0$ by definition (an infection has been introduced), the condition for growth is:\n$$ \\beta S(0) - \\gamma > 0 $$\nUsing the approximation for a nearly entirely susceptible population, $S(0) \\approx N$, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\beta N - \\gamma > 0 $$\nRearranging this inequality gives the threshold condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma} > 1 $$\nThe epidemic threshold is therefore the dimensionless expression $\\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}$. This quantity is commonly known as the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. For the density-dependent model, we have:\n$$ R_{0, \\text{density}} = \\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma} $$\n\nCase 2: Frequency-Dependent (Standard) Incidence\nUnder this assumption, the rate of new infections is proportional to the product of the number of susceptible individuals and the *fraction* of the population that is infectious, $I/N$. The rate of new infections is $\\beta S \\frac{I}{N}$. The differential equation for the infectious compartment is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{S(t) I(t)}{N} - \\gamma I(t) $$\nFactoring out $I(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = I(t) \\left( \\beta \\frac{S(t)}{N} - \\gamma \\right) $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$ with the condition $\\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0} > 0$ and $I(0) > 0$, we get:\n$$ \\beta \\frac{S(0)}{N} - \\gamma > 0 $$\nAgain, substituting the approximation $S(0) \\approx N$:\n$$ \\beta \\frac{N}{N} - \\gamma > 0 \\implies \\beta - \\gamma > 0 $$\nRearranging gives the threshold condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} > 1 $$\nThe epidemic threshold for the frequency-dependent model is thus:\n$$ R_{0, \\text{freq}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} $$\n\nComparison of Dependence on $N$:\nThe derived epidemic thresholds show a crucial difference in their dependence on the total population size $N$.\nThe density-dependent threshold, $R_{0, \\text{density}} = \\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}$, is directly proportional to $N$. This implies that, all else being equal, a larger population is inherently more vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak. This model assumes an individual's number of contacts scales with the population density.\nThe frequency-dependent threshold, $R_{0, \\text{freq}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$, is independent of $N$. This model assumes that individuals have a relatively fixed number of contacts regardless of the total population size. The spread of the disease depends on the probability that a given contact is with an infectious person ($I/N$), not the absolute number of infectious people. This is often considered a more realistic model for diseases spread by close contact in human populations, where social structures constrain contact rates.\n\nThe two requested expressions are $\\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}$ for density-dependent incidence and $\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$ for frequency-dependent incidence.",

            "problem": "Implement a program that simulates a discrete-time renewal model for infectious disease incidence under the following scientifically grounded principles. The renewal formulation is based on the definition that the expected number of new infections on day $t$ arises from past incidence weighted by the generation-interval distribution and scaled by a constant reproduction number. Time is represented in days. The generation interval is modeled by a continuous probability density function (PDF) and then discretized to daily probability masses. The model starts from a single nonzero initial incidence at day $0$; for days before $0$, incidence is zero. Numerical outputs are counts of new infections (dimensionless), reported as decimal numbers.\n\nYour program must:\n- Use daily time steps $t = 0, 1, \\dots, T$.\n- Represent the discrete generation-interval weights $g(\\tau)$ for $\\tau = 1, 2, \\dots, 14$ by discretizing a continuous Gamma distribution with a specified mean $\\mu$ (in days) and standard deviation $\\sigma$ (in days) as follows: compute the probability mass in each unit-length interval $[\\tau-1, \\tau)$ for $\\tau = 1, 2, \\dots, 14$ from the continuous Gamma cumulative distribution function, truncate at $\\tau = 14$, and renormalize so that $\\sum_{\\tau=1}^{14} g(\\tau) = 1$. This $g(\\tau)$ is then held fixed over all days for a given test case.\n- Evolve daily incidence using the renewal reasoning: for each day $t \\geq 1$, the expected incidence depends on the weighted contribution from previous days $t-\\tau$ with weights $g(\\tau)$ and a constant reproduction number $R$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a discrete-time infectious disease incidence model based on the renewal equation. This is a scientifically established method in epidemiology for forecasting incidence based on three key components: the reproduction number ($R$), past incidence trends, and the generation interval distribution. The solution is structured by first deriving the model's parameters from the given inputs, then specifying the iterative algorithm to simulate the incidence trajectory.\n\n### 1. The Renewal Equation Model\n\nThe core of the model is the renewal equation, which postulates that the number of new infections at a given time $t$, denoted $i(t)$, is proportional to the total infectiousness of individuals infected in the past. This can be formulated as:\n$$\ni(t) = R \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{\\infty} i(t-\\tau) g(\\tau)\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the effective reproduction number, representing the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual. The term $i(t-\\tau)$ is the number of new infections that occurred $\\tau$ days in the past. The function $g(\\tau)$ is the discrete probability mass function of the generation interval, which is the time between an individual becoming infected and them infecting another person. The product $i(t-\\tau)g(\\tau)$ represents the number of new infections at time $t$ that are caused by individuals who were themselves infected at time $t-\\tau$. The summation aggregates these contributions over all possible generation interval durations.\n\nThe problem specifies a discrete-time model with daily steps, an initial incidence $i(0) = i_0$, and zero incidence for any time $t  0$. The generation interval is truncated at $14$ days. Therefore, the governing equation for $t \\ge 1$ becomes:\n$$\ni(t) = R \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{14} i(t-\\tau) g(\\tau)\n$$\nwith the boundary condition that any term $i(t-\\tau)$ where $t-\\tau  0$ is zero.\n\n### 2. Discretization of the Generation Interval\n\nThe generation interval distribution, $g(\\tau)$, is derived from a continuous Gamma probability distribution, which is a standard choice for its flexibility in capturing the shape of such biological time intervals. The Gamma distribution is defined by a shape parameter, $k$, and a scale parameter, $\\theta$. The problem provides the mean, $\\mu$, and standard deviation, $\\sigma$, of the generation interval, from which we must derive $k$ and $\\theta$.\n\nThe moments of the Gamma distribution are given by:\n- Mean: $\\mu = k\\theta$\n- Variance: $\\sigma^2 = k\\theta^2$\n\nBy dividing the variance by the mean, we can solve for the scale parameter $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu} = \\frac{k\\theta^2}{k\\theta} \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\theta$ back into the equation for the mean allows us to solve for the shape parameter $k$:\n$$\n\\mu = k \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu}\\right) \\implies k = \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\nOnce $k$ and $\\theta$ are determined, we can define the continuous cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x; k, \\theta)$. The problem requires us to discretize this continuous distribution into daily probability masses, $g(\\tau)$, for $\\tau = 1, 2, \\dots, 14$. The unnormalized weight $w(\\tau)$ for each day is the probability that the continuous generation interval falls within the day's interval, i.e., $[\\tau-1, \\tau)$:\n$$\nw(\\tau) = P(\\tau-1 \\le X  \\tau) = F(\\tau; k, \\theta) - F(\\tau-1; k, \\theta)\n$$\nThese weights are calculated for $\\tau = 1, \\dots, 14$. Because the distribution is truncated at $14$ days, the sum of these weights, $\\sum_{\\tau=1}^{14} w(\\tau)$, will be less than $1$. To form a valid discrete probability distribution, we must renormalize them:\n$$\ng(\\tau) = \\frac{w(\\tau)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{14} w(j)}\n$$\nThis ensures that $\\sum_{\\tau=1}^{14} g(\\tau) = 1$.\n\n### 3. Simulation Algorithm\n\nThe simulation proceeds iteratively from the initial condition $i(0) = i_0$. The full incidence trajectory $[i(0), i(1), \\dots, i(T)]$ is stored in an array.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    a. Given a test case with parameters $i_0$, $R$, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and $T$.\n    b. Calculate the Gamma distribution parameters $k = (\\mu/\\sigma)^2$ and $\\theta = \\sigma^2/\\mu$.\n    c. Calculate the discrete, normalized generation interval distribution $g(\\tau)$ for $\\tau = 1, \\dots, 14$ using the CDF as described above.\n    d. Initialize an incidence array, `incidence`, of length $T+1$. Set `incidence[0]`$= i_0$.\n\n2.  **Time-Stepping Loop**: For each day $t$ from $1$ to $T$:\n    a. Calculate the total infectious pressure, $\\lambda(t)$, which is the sum of contributions from past incidence, weighted by the generation interval distribution:\n    $$\n    \\lambda(t) = \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{14} i(t-\\tau) g(\\tau)\n    $$\n    In the implementation, this summation is calculated by iterating $\\tau$ from $1$ to $\\min(t, 14)$ to ensure the index $t-\\tau$ is non-negative. Note that if the weights $g(1), g(2), \\ldots, g(14)$ are stored in a 0-indexed array (e.g., `g[0], g[1], ...`), the term $g(\\tau)$ in the formula corresponds to the array element `g[tau-1]`.\n    b. Calculate the new incidence at day $t$:\n    $$\n    i(t) = R \\times \\lambda(t)\n    $$\n    c. Store this value in `incidence[t]`.\n\n3.  **Output**: After the loop completes, the `incidence` array contains the full trajectory $[i(0), i(1), \\dots, i(T)]$. Each value in this array is rounded to $6$ decimal places as required. This process is repeated for each test case.\n\nThis procedure provides a deterministic, step-by-step method to simulate the disease trajectory based on the fundamental principles of the renewal model. The use of `scipy.stats.gamma` for the CDF and `numpy` for array operations makes the implementation both accurate and efficient.",
