            "solution": "The problem provides data from a randomized clinical trial and asks for the computation of two fundamental effect measures: the risk ratio ($RR$) and the risk difference ($RD$). The first step is to validate the problem statement. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. The data are internally consistent and the scenario is realistic. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe given event counts are:\n- In the Vaccinated group: $a = 90$ with the outcome (influenza), and $b = 1410$ without the outcome.\n- In the Control group: $c = 140$ with the outcome, and $d = 1260$ without the outcome.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of participants in each allocation group.\nThe total number of participants in the Vaccinated group, denoted as $N_V$, is the sum of those who experienced the outcome and those who did not:\n$$ N_V = a + b = 90 + 1410 = 1500 $$\nThe total number of participants in the Control group, denoted as $N_C$, is calculated similarly:\n$$ N_C = c + d = 140 + 1260 = 1400 $$\n\nWith these totals, we can construct the $2 \\times 2$ data representation, also known as a contingency table, for the outcome status by allocation group:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l|cc}\n\\text{Outcome} & \\text{Vaccinated} & \\text{Control} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Influenza (Event)} & a = 90 & c = 140 \\\\\n\\text{No Influenza (No Event)} & b = 1410 & d = 1260 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total Participants} & N_V = 1500 & N_C = 1400\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the risk for each group. The risk is defined as the proportion of participants in a group who experience the outcome.\nThe risk of influenza in the Vaccinated group ($R_V$) is:\n$$ R_V = \\frac{a}{N_V} = \\frac{90}{1500} = 0.06 $$\nThe risk of influenza in the Control group ($R_C$) is:\n$$ R_C = \\frac{c}{N_C} = \\frac{140}{1400} = 0.1 $$\n\nNow we can compute the requested effect measures.\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the Vaccinated group to the risk in the Control group.\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_V}{R_C} = \\frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be reported to $4$ significant figures. Since the calculated value is exact, we express it with the specified precision by padding it with zeros.\n$$ RR = 0.6000 $$\n\nThe risk difference ($RD$) is defined as the risk in the Vaccinated group minus the risk in the Control group.\n$$ RD = R_V - R_C = 0.06 - 0.1 = -0.04 $$\nThis value must also be reported to $4$ significant figures. As with the risk ratio, the exact result is padded with zeros to meet the required precision.\n$$ RD = -0.04000 $$\n\nThe negative sign for the risk difference indicates that the risk of the outcome (influenza) is lower in the Vaccinated group compared to the Control group.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first calculating the inverse-variance weights for each study, then the fixed-effect summary estimate, and finally the heterogeneity statistics $Q$ and $I^2$.\n\nThe weight for each study $i$, denoted $w_i$, is the inverse of its variance $v_i$:\n$$w_i = \\frac{1}{v_i}$$\nThe weights for the $k=6$ studies are:\n- $w_1 = \\frac{1}{0.020} = 50$\n- $w_2 = \\frac{1}{0.015} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.67$\n- $w_3 = \\frac{1}{0.030} = \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.33$\n- $w_4 = \\frac{1}{0.025} = 40$\n- $w_5 = \\frac{1}{0.018} = \\frac{500}{9} \\approx 55.56$\n- $w_6 = \\frac{1}{0.022} = \\frac{500}{11} \\approx 45.45$\n\nThe fixed-effect summary estimate, $\\bar{y}_{FE}$, is the weighted average of the individual study effects:\n$$\\bar{y}_{FE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$\nFirst, we compute the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i = 50 + \\frac{200}{3} + \\frac{100}{3} + 40 + \\frac{500}{9} + \\frac{500}{11} = 90 + \\frac{300}{3} + \\frac{500}{9} + \\frac{500}{11} = 190 + \\frac{5500+4500}{99} = \\frac{18810+10000}{99} = \\frac{28810}{99}$$\nNext, we compute the sum of the weighted effects, $\\sum w_i y_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i y_i = (50)(-0.10) + \\left(\\frac{200}{3}\\right)(-0.05) + \\left(\\frac{100}{3}\\right)(-0.22) + (40)(0.30) + \\left(\\frac{500}{9}\\right)(-0.18) + \\left(\\frac{500}{11}\\right)(-0.12)$$\n$$= -5 - \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{22}{3} + 12 - 10 - \\frac{60}{11} = -3 - \\frac{32}{3} - \\frac{60}{11} = \\frac{-99 - 352 - 180}{33} = -\\frac{631}{33}$$\nNow, we can calculate $\\bar{y}_{FE}$:\n$$\\bar{y}_{FE} = \\frac{-631/33}{28810/99} = -\\frac{631}{33} \\cdot \\frac{99}{28810} = -\\frac{631 \\cdot 3}{28810} = -\\frac{1893}{28810} \\approx -0.065706$$\nCochran's Q statistic measures the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects and the pooled effect estimate. It is defined as:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i (y_i - \\bar{y}_{FE})^2$$\nA computationally simpler, algebraically equivalent formula is:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i^2 - \\frac{\\left(\\sum w_i y_i\\right)^2}{\\sum w_i}$$\nLet's compute $\\sum w_i y_i^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i y_i^2 = 50(-0.10)^2 + \\frac{200}{3}(-0.05)^2 + \\frac{100}{3}(-0.22)^2 + 40(0.30)^2 + \\frac{500}{9}(-0.18)^2 + \\frac{500}{11}(-0.12)^2 $$\n$$ = 0.5 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4.84}{3} + 3.6 + 1.8 + \\frac{7.2}{11} = 5.9 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4.84}{3} + \\frac{7.2}{11} = \\frac{59}{10} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{484}{300} + \\frac{72}{110} $$\n$$ = \\frac{2292}{275} \\approx 8.334545 $$\nNow we can calculate $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{2292}{275} - \\frac{(-631/33)^2}{28810/99} = \\frac{2292}{275} - \\frac{398161/1089}{28810/99} = \\frac{2292}{275} - \\frac{398161}{11 \\cdot 28810} = \\frac{2292}{275} - \\frac{398161}{316910} $$\n$$ Q \\approx 8.334545 - 1.256372 = 7.078173 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $Q = 7.078$.\n\nThe $I^2$ statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. It is calculated from $Q$ and its degrees of freedom, $df = k-1$.\n$$ df = 6 - 1 = 5 $$\n$$ I^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q - df}{Q}\\right) $$\nSince $Q \\approx 7.078 > df=5$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ I^2 = \\frac{Q - df}{Q} = \\frac{7.078173 - 5}{7.078173} = \\frac{2.078173}{7.078173} \\approx 0.293616 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $I^2 = 0.2936$.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe heterogeneity statistic is $Q \\approx 7.078$. Under the null hypothesis of homogeneity (i.e., all studies share a common true effect), $Q$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $df = 5$ degrees of freedom. The critical value for $\\chi^2_5$ at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$ is $11.07$. Since our calculated $Q$ is less than this critical value ($7.078  11.07$), the test for heterogeneity is not statistically significant. This result, on its own, would support the use of a fixed-effect model.\n\nThe inconsistency metric is $I^2 \\approx 0.2936$, or $29.36\\%$. This value suggests that approximately $29\\%$ of the variability in the effect estimates is attributable to true between-study heterogeneity rather than random sampling error. This level of heterogeneity is generally considered low to moderate.\n\nThe choice between a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model is informed by these results. While the Q-test is not significant, it is known to have low statistical power, especially with a small number of studies ($k=6$). The $I^2$ value, while not high, indicates the presence of some between-study heterogeneity. A conservative and common approach in modern meta-analysis is to opt for a random-effects model when $I^2 > 0$, as it provides a more cautious estimate by incorporating between-study variance, leading to wider confidence intervals. Therefore, despite the non-significant Q-test, the presence of moderate inconsistency ($I^2 \\approx 29\\%$) provides a reasonable argument for choosing a random-effects model over a fixed-effect model.",

This substantially inflates the variance and therefore reduces the inverse-variance weight $w$ of Study $1$, even though Study $1$ is large (total $n = 2000$). This illustrates that continuity corrections that set a small pseudo-count (e.g., $0.5$) produce large variance contributions via $\\dfrac{1}{a}$ and thus severely downweight single-zero studies; neither $\\mathrm{S1}$ nor $\\mathrm{S2}$ mitigates this variance inflation.\n- The pooled estimates under $\\mathrm{S1}$ and $\\mathrm{S2}$ are numerically very similar here ($\\mathrm{OR} \\approx 0.537$ vs $\\approx 0.539$). More generally, the direction and magnitude of bias introduced by a continuity correction can depend on arm sizes and event counts. Adding $0.5$ to all four cells ($\\mathrm{S1}$) alters both arms, potentially moving the control odds further from its observed value and sometimes pushing the study-specific effect away from or toward the null. The treatment-arm continuity correction ($\\mathrm{S2}$) perturbs only the zero-event arm, which can reduce distortion of the non-zero arm’s odds but still suffers the same large $\\dfrac{1}{0.5}$ variance term.\n- Neither strategy guarantees unbiasedness under the null across arbitrary arm imbalances, nor do they guarantee reductions in between-study heterogeneity.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: “The constant $0.5$ correction always yields a pooled estimate closer to the null than the treatment-arm continuity correction.” This is not generally true; as shown in some single-zero configurations, adding $0.5$ to both arms can move the control odds farther from its observed value and may produce a study-specific estimate further from the null than a treatment-arm-only correction. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option B: “In single-zero studies, both continuity corrections inflate $\\mathrm{Var}[\\log(\\mathrm{OR})]$ by introducing a $\\dfrac{1}{0.5}$ term, severely downweighting even large studies; thus, neither strategy prevents the loss of information inherent to rare events.” This matches the derivation: the $\\dfrac{1}{0.5} = 2$ term dominates the variance, sharply reducing weight, and neither correction avoids this. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option C: “Treatment-arm continuity correction guarantees an unbiased pooled $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ under the null regardless of arm imbalance.” No correction of this simple form guarantees unbiasedness across arm imbalances and sparse data; bias depends on design and event rarity. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option D: “Adding $0.5$ to all four cells is guaranteed to reduce between-study heterogeneity compared with the treatment-arm continuity correction.” There is no such guarantee; heterogeneity can increase or decrease depending on how corrections perturb study-specific effects and variances. Verdict: Incorrect.",
