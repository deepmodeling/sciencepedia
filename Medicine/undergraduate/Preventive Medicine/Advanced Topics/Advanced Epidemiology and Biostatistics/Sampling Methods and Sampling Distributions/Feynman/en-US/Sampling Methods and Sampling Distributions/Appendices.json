            "problem": "A city health department is evaluating the systolic blood pressure component of a community screening program for hypertension. The department maintains a registry of $N=10000$ adults eligible for screening. To assess the screening process this season, the department will draw a simple random sample without replacement (Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR)) of size $n=1000$ from the registry and compute the sample mean systolic blood pressure. From last season’s complete registry, the known finite population variance of systolic blood pressure, defined as $S^{2}=\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(y_{j}-\\bar{Y})^{2}$, is $S^{2}=225$ in units of millimeters of mercury squared ($\\text{mmHg}^2$).\n\nUsing the principles of SRSWOR and finite population sampling, compute:\n- the finite population correction for the variance of the sample mean, and\n- the variance of the sample mean of systolic blood pressure under SRSWOR.\n\nReport the finite population correction as dimensionless and the variance in millimeters of mercury squared ($\\text{mmHg}^2$). Round both values to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) from a finite population: the finite population correction and the variance of the sample mean.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- The total population size, $N = 10000$.\n- The sample size, $n = 1000$.\n- The method of sampling is simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR).\n- The finite population variance of the systolic blood pressure, defined as $S^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(y_{j}-\\bar{Y})^{2}$, is given as $S^2 = 225 \\text{ mmHg}^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the finite population correction (fpc). The fpc is a factor used to adjust the variance of an estimator when a sample is drawn from a finite population without replacement. It accounts for the fact that the sampling variation is reduced when the sampling fraction is not negligible. The fpc is defined as:\n$$ \\text{fpc} = 1 - \\frac{n}{N} $$\nThis can also be expressed as $\\frac{N-n}{N}$. We will use the given values for $N$ and $n$:\n$$ \\text{fpc} = 1 - \\frac{1000}{10000} = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 $$\nThe problem asks for this value to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore, the finite population correction is $0.9000$. This quantity is dimensionless.\n\nSecond, we compute the variance of the sample mean systolic blood pressure, denoted as $\\text{Var}(\\bar{y})$. For a simple random sample drawn with replacement, the variance of the sample mean would be $\\frac{S^2}{n}$. However, since the sampling is done *without* replacement, we must apply the finite population correction. The formula for the variance of the sample mean under SRSWOR is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\frac{S^2}{n} \\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right) $$\nIt is essential to note that this formula is appropriate when the provided population variance $S^2$ is defined with a denominator of $N-1$, as is explicitly stated in the problem. The term $\\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right)$ is precisely the finite population correction factor we calculated previously.\n\nWe can now substitute the given values into this formula:\n- $S^2 = 225 \\text{ mmHg}^2$\n- $n = 1000$\n- The fpc term is $\\frac{N-n}{N} = \\frac{10000 - 1000}{10000} = \\frac{9000}{10000} = 0.9$.\n\nSo, the variance of the sample mean is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\frac{225}{1000} \\times 0.9 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = 0.225 \\times 0.9 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = 0.2025 \\text{ mmHg}^2 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.2025$ already consists of four significant figures (the digits $2$, $0$, $2$, and $5$).\n\nThus, the two requested values are:\n1.  Finite population correction: $0.9000$\n2.  Variance of the sample mean: $0.2025 \\text{ mmHg}^2$",

The sum can be rewritten as $\\sum_{i=1}^{H} T_i$.
