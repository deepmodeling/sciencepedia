This foundational exercise guides you through the process of calculating the sample size for a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with a binary outcome, such as the presence or absence of a health behavior.

            "problem": "A public health team plans a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate a preventive counseling intervention intended to reduce the $6$-month incidence of a modifiable risk behavior among first-year university students. In the control arm, they anticipate an incidence of $p_{2}=0.20$. They wish to be able to detect a reduction of $\\Delta = p_{1}-p_{2} = -0.05$ (that is, $p_{1}=0.15$ in the intervention arm) using a two-sided hypothesis test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ with power $1-\\beta = 0.90$. Assume independent Bernoulli outcomes, equal allocation ($n$ per arm), and that the large-sample normal approximation to the difference in sample proportions is appropriate for both test size and power assessment.\n\nCompute the required sample size $n$ per arm to achieve these design targets using a two-sided test for two independent proportions under these assumptions. Round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it represents a standard, well-posed statistical power and sample size calculation scenario in preventive medicine. All necessary data and conditions ($p_1$, $p_2$, $\\alpha$, $1-\\beta$, two-sided test, equal allocation) are provided and are scientifically and factually sound.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the required sample size, $n$, for each of the two arms of an RCT. The study is designed to detect a difference between two independent proportions, $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nThe hypotheses for the two-sided test are:\nNull hypothesis, $H_0: p_1 = p_2$.\nAlternative hypothesis, $H_a: p_1 \\neq p_2$.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- Incidence in the intervention arm, $p_1 = 0.15$.\n- Incidence in the control arm, $p_2 = 0.20$.\n- Significance level, $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- Desired power, $1-\\beta = 0.90$, which implies $\\beta = 0.10$.\n- The allocation is equal, with $n_1 = n_2 = n$.\n\nThe sample size calculation must be based on a large-sample normal approximation. For a two-sided test of two proportions, the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis. The power calculation, however, is performed under the alternative hypothesis. A rigorous formula for the sample size per arm, which accounts for the different variances under the null and alternative hypotheses, is given by:\n$$n = \\frac{\\left(Z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + Z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}\\right)^2}{(p_1-p_2)^2}$$\nHere, $\\bar{p}$ is the pooled proportion under the null hypothesis, estimated for the purpose of this calculation as the average of the proportions under the alternative, $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1+p_2}{2}$. The term $Z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the standard normal quantile for the upper tail probability of $\\alpha/2$, and $Z_{1-\\beta}$ is the standard normal quantile corresponding to the desired power.\n\nFirst, we determine the required $Z$-scores:\n- For a two-sided test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, we need the quantile for $1 - \\alpha/2 = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975$.\n  $$Z_{1-\\alpha/2} = Z_{0.975} \\approx 1.959964$$\n- For a power of $1-\\beta = 0.90$, we need the quantile for $1 - \\beta = 0.90$.\n  $$Z_{1-\\beta} = Z_{0.90} \\approx 1.281552$$\n\nNext, we calculate the necessary proportions and variance terms:\n- The difference in proportions is $p_1 - p_2 = 0.15 - 0.20 = -0.05$. The square of this difference is $(p_1-p_2)^2 = (-0.05)^2 = 0.0025$.\n- The pooled proportion is $\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.15 + 0.20}{2} = 0.175$.\n- The variance term for the null hypothesis component is $2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2(0.175)(1-0.175) = 2(0.175)(0.825) = 0.28875$.\n- The variance term for the alternative hypothesis component is $p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2) = 0.15(1-0.15) + 0.20(1-0.20) = 0.15(0.85) + 0.20(0.80) = 0.1275 + 0.16 = 0.2875$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the sample size formula:\n$$n = \\frac{\\left(1.959964 \\sqrt{0.28875} + 1.281552 \\sqrt{0.2875}\\right)^2}{0.0025}$$\nComputing the terms in the numerator:\n$$n = \\frac{\\left(1.959964 \\times 0.5373546 + 1.281552 \\times 0.5361903\\right)^2}{0.0025}$$\n$$n = \\frac{\\left(1.053201 + 0.687181\\right)^2}{0.0025}$$\n$$n = \\frac{(1.740382)^2}{0.0025}$$\n$$n = \\frac{3.02893}{0.0025}$$\n$$n \\approx 1211.572$$\n\nSince the sample size must be an integer, we must round this value up to the next whole number to ensure that the power of the study is at least $0.90$.\n$$n_{required} = \\lceil 1211.572 \\rceil = 1212$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The integer value $1212$ already consists of $4$ significant figures. Thus, the required sample size per arm is $1212$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires deriving the per-group sample size $n$ for a two-sample test of means from first principles and then calculating its value using updated variance information.\n\n**1. First-Principles Derivation**\nLet $\\mu_I$ and $\\mu_C$ be the true mean outcomes for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The hypotheses are $H_0: \\mu_I = \\mu_C$ versus $H_A: \\mu_I \\neq \\mu_C$.\nLet $n$ be the sample size per group, and let $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ be the common population variance.

For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > Z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n\nPower is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is false. We evaluate power for a specific alternative hypothesis, $H_A: \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\Delta$. Under this alternative, the distribution of the difference in sample means is $(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) \\sim N(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{n})$.\nThe power is $1-\\beta = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | H_A \\text{ is true})$.

The equation becomes $1-\\beta = P(Z' > Z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2/n}})$. For this to be true, the expression on the right must be equal to the $Z$-score corresponding to a lower-tail probability of $\\beta$, which is $Z_{\\beta} = -Z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$-Z_{1-\\beta} = Z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2/n}}$$\nRearranging to solve for $n$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2/n}} = Z_{1-\\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\\beta}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2}(Z_{1-\\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta}$$\n$$n = \\frac{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2(Z_{1-\\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}$$\nThis is the required formula derived from first principles.\n\n**2.
