A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core principle governing this problem is the conservation of mass applied to a system in steady state.\n\nLet us define the following quantities:\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{intake}}$: The rate of potassium intake from the diet, given as $100\\,\\mathrm{mmol/day}$.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$: The total rate of potassium elimination from the body.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{urine}}$: The rate of potassium excretion in urine.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{feces}}$: The rate of potassium excretion in feces.\n-   $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}}$: The net change in total body potassium stores over a given time interval (in this case, one day).\n\nThe principle of mass balance can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}} = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} - K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the adult is in a \"steady state\" and that \"net body potassium stores are unchanged over the day.\" This is the definition of a zero net balance, which mathematically translates to:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}} = 0 $$\n\nSubstituting this condition into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$ 0 = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} - K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\nThis implies that in a steady state, the total rate of output must equal the total rate of intake:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} $$\n\nWe are given that $K_{\\mathrm{intake}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmol/day}$. Therefore, the total daily potassium elimination must also be:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmol/day} $$\n\nThe problem also specifies the routes of elimination. Total elimination is the sum of urinary and fecal excretion:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = K_{\\mathrm{urine}} + K_{\\mathrm{feces}} $$\n\nFurthermore, we are given the fractional contribution of each route to the total elimination:\n-   Renal (urinary) excretion accounts for $90\\%$ of total elimination: $K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$\n-   Fecal excretion accounts for $10\\%$ of total elimination: $K_{\\mathrm{feces}} = 0.10 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$\n\nThe question asks for the expected urinary potassium excretion, $K_{\\mathrm{urine}}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\n\nSubstituting the value we found for $K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mmol/day} $$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol/day} $$\n\nThus, the expected urinary potassium excretion for this day is $90\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$.",

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that requires critical validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Body mass: $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Acute oral potassium load: $K_{\\text{load}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$\n- Gastrointestinal absorption efficiency: $\\eta_{\\text{abs}} = 90\\% = 0.9$\n- Fraction of absorbed potassium shifted to intracellular compartment: $f_{\\text{ICF}} = 80\\% = 0.8$\n- Extracellular fluid (ECF) volume as a fraction of body mass: $v_{\\text{ECF}} = 0.2$\n- Intracellular fluid (ICF) volume as a fraction of body mass: $v_{\\text{ICF\\_vol}} = 0.4$\n- Renal excretion in the first hour is negligible.\n- Acid-base status is normal.\n- Mixing within the ECF is instantaneous and uniform.\n- Plasma potassium concentration is equal to ECF potassium concentration.\n- The desired quantity is the acute increase in plasma potassium concentration, $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{plasma}}$, in $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of potassium homeostasis in pathophysiology. The values for ECF/ICF volumes ($20\\%$ and $40\\%$ of body mass, respectively), gastrointestinal absorption of potassium ($\\approx 90\\%$), and the roles of insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic stimulation in the transcellular shift of potassium are all standard textbook concepts.

It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The objective is clearly defined.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and quantitative, avoiding any subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard compartmental analysis problem found in medical physiology and biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in plasma potassium concentration, $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{plasma}}$, following an acute oral potassium load. Based on the provided assumptions, this is equivalent to the change in the potassium concentration of the extracellular fluid (ECF), $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}}$. The solution proceeds by applying the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of potassium that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream (which is part of the ECF).\nLet $K_{\\text{load}}$ be the ingested potassium load and $\\eta_{\\text{abs}}$ be the absorption efficiency. The total absorbed potassium, $K_{\\text{abs}}$, is:\n$$K_{\\text{abs}} = K_{\\text{load}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{abs}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$K_{\\text{abs}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmol} \\times 0.9 = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$$\n\nNext, this absorbed potassium is distributed between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF. The problem states that a fraction $f_{\\text{ICF}} = 0.8$ of the absorbed potassium moves into the intracellular compartment. The remaining fraction, $(1 - f_{\\text{ICF}})$, stays in the ECF. This remaining amount, $\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}}$, is the net increase in the quantity of potassium in the ECF.\n$$\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = K_{\\text{abs}} \\times (1 - f_{\\text{ICF}})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol} \\times (1 - 0.8) = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol} \\times 0.2 = 18\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$$\nThis quantity, $\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$, is the total amount of potassium added to the ECF compartment.\n\nThe increase in concentration within the ECF, $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}}$, is this added amount divided by the volume of the ECF, $V_{\\text{ECF}}$. The ECF volume is given as a fraction $v_{\\text{ECF}} = 0.2$ of the body mass $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Assuming the density of the body fluid is approximately $1\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{L}$, the volume in liters is numerically equal to the mass fraction in kilograms.\n$$V_{\\text{ECF}} = v_{\\text{ECF}} \\times m$$\n$$V_{\\text{ECF}} = 0.2 \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 14\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNow, the increase in ECF potassium concentration can be calculated:\n$$\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}} = \\frac{\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}}}{V_{\\text{ECF}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}} = \\frac{18\\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{14\\,\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{9}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nSince the problem states that the plasma potassium concentration is equal to the ECF potassium concentration, the increase in plasma concentration is equal to the increase in ECF concentration:\n$$\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{plasma}} = \\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}} = \\frac{9}{7}\\,\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the numerical value and round it to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{9}{7} \\approx 1.285714...$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $1.29$. The final increase in plasma potassium concentration is $1.29\\,\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$.",

            "problem": "A clinician wishes to use a spot urine specimen to judge whether a hypokalemic patient’s potassium loss is primarily renal or extrarenal. Assume the following widely accepted physiological bases:\n- In hypokalemia, an appropriate renal response is to reduce urinary potassium excretion to at most a boundary rate of $20$ milliequivalents per day, above which renal potassium wasting is suspected.\n- Daily urinary creatinine excretion is approximately constant for a given person and can be used to normalize spot measurements; take the patient’s daily creatinine excretion to be $1.50$ grams per day.\n- The valence of potassium is $z=1$ so that $1$ milliequivalent equals $1$ millimole of potassium.\n- The molar mass of creatinine is $113$ grams per mole.\n\nFrom these bases, derive the spot urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio threshold that corresponds to the $20$ milliequivalents per day boundary in two unit systems:\n1. milliequivalents potassium per gram creatinine, and\n2. millimoles potassium per millimole creatinine.\n\nReport both thresholds as numbers in the order above.

            "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of renal physiology and clinical chemistry, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle behind using a spot urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio is the assumption that the ratio of the concentrations of two substances in a random urine sample approximates the ratio of their total 24-hour excretion rates. This is predicated on the patient's relatively constant daily excretion of creatinine, which serves as a normalization factor for the excretion of other solutes like potassium.\n\nLet $K_{U, \\text{rate}}$ be the daily urinary potassium excretion rate and $Cr_{U, \\text{rate}}$ be the daily urinary creatinine excretion rate. The problem provides the boundary threshold for appropriate renal potassium conservation in hypokalemia as:\n$$ K_{U, \\text{rate}} = 20 \\text{ milliequivalents per day} $$\n\nThe patient's estimated daily creatinine excretion is given as:\n$$ Cr_{U, \\text{rate}} = 1.50 \\text{ grams per day} $$\n\nThe urinary potassium-to-creatinine ratio, which we shall denote as $R_{K/Cr}$, is the ratio of these two daily rates. The problem asks for this ratio to be expressed in two different unit systems.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Threshold in milliequivalents per gram (mEq/g)**\n\nFor the first requested unit system, we compute the ratio directly from the given excretion rates.\n$$ R_{K/Cr}^{(1)} = \\frac{K_{U, \\text{rate}}}{Cr_{U, \\text{rate}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ R_{K/Cr}^{(1)} = \\frac{20 \\text{ mEq/day}}{1.50 \\text{ g/day}} = \\frac{20}{1.50} \\frac{\\text{mEq}}{\\text{g}} \\approx 13.333... \\frac{\\text{mEq}}{\\text{g}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, the first threshold is $13.3$ milliequivalents of potassium per gram of creatinine. This value signifies that for every gram of creatinine excreted, up to $13.3$ milliequivalents of potassium are also excreted under conditions of appropriate renal conservation.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Threshold in millimoles per millimole (mmol/mmol)**\n\nFor the second requested unit system, we must convert both the potassium and creatinine quantities to a molar basis, specifically millimoles.\n\nFirst, we convert the potassium excretion rate from milliequivalents per day to millimoles per day. For a monovalent ion like potassium ($K^+$), where the valence $z$ is $1$, the number of milliequivalents is equal to the number of millimoles. This is explicitly stated in the problem premises.\n$$ K_{U, \\text{rate}} (\\text{in mmol/day}) = 20 \\text{ mEq/day} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mmol}}{1 \\text{ mEq}} = 20 \\text{ mmol/day} $$\n\nNext, we convert the creatinine excretion rate from grams per day to millimoles per day. This requires the molar mass of creatinine, $M_{Cr}$, provided as $113$ grams per mole.\nThe molar excretion rate of creatinine is:\n$$ Cr_{U, \\text{molar rate}} = \\frac{Cr_{U, \\text{rate}} (\\text{in g/day})}{M_{Cr} (\\text{in g/mol})} = \\frac{1.50 \\text{ g/day}}{113 \\text{ g/mol}} $$\nTo express this in millimoles per day, we multiply by the conversion factor $1000$ mmol/mol:\n$$ Cr_{U, \\text{molar rate}} (\\text{in mmol/day}) = \\frac{1.50}{113} \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{day}} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{mol}} = \\frac{1500}{113} \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{day}} \\approx 13.274... \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{day}} $$\n\nNow we can compute the dimensionless ratio of the molar excretion rates.\n$$ R_{K/Cr}^{(2)} = \\frac{K_{U, \\text{rate}} (\\text{in mmol/day})}{Cr_{U, \\text{molar rate}} (\\text{in mmol/day})} $$\n$$ R_{K/Cr}^{(2)} = \\frac{20 \\text{ mmol/day}}{\\frac{1500}{113} \\text{ mmol/day}} = \\frac{20 \\times 113}{1500} = \\frac{2260}{1500} \\approx 1.5066... $$\nThe units of mmol/day cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio, as expected for units of mmol/mmol. Rounding to three significant figures, the second threshold is $1.51$.\n\nThe two derived thresholds are therefore $13.3$ mEq/g and $1.51$ mmol/mmol. Ratios in a spot urine sample exceeding these thresholds in a hypokalemic patient would suggest inappropriate renal potassium wasting, pointing towards a renal cause for the potassium deficit.",
