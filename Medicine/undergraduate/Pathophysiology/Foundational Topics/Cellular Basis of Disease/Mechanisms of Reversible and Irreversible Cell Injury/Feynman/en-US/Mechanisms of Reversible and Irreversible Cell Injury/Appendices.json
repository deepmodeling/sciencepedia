            "problem": "A research team exposes two matched cultures of primary rat cardiomyocytes to oxygen deprivation under controlled conditions and then restores oxygen, aiming to distinguish reversible from irreversible injury. In Culture 1, oxygen tension is lowered sufficiently to reduce aerobic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis for $15$ minutes but perfusion with substrates and removal of metabolites are maintained (transient hypoxia). In Culture 2, oxygen and perfusion are both interrupted for $120$ minutes by complete flow cessation (prolonged ischemia), followed by reperfusion. At the end of the deprivation period in both cultures, the following are documented: reduced intracellular $[\\text{ATP}]$, cellular swelling with plasma membrane blebs, ribosomal detachment from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, elevated cytosolic $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, and episodes of Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP) opening detected by calcein-cobalt quenching. In Culture 2 specifically, lysosomal membrane rupture with release of acid hydrolases into the cytosol is additionally detected, along with early mitochondrial amorphous densities on electron microscopy.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts: cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation to regenerate ATP; the Sodium-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase) and calcium pumps are ATP-dependent; MPTP opening is promoted by high matrix $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), phosphate accumulation, and adenine nucleotide depletion; persistent MPTP opening collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential, halts oxidative phosphorylation, and can initiate necrosis; lysosomal membrane rupture releases active hydrolases that digest cellular macromolecules; reversible injury is characterized by functional and structural changes that can return to baseline after restoration of oxygen and substrates, whereas irreversible injury features critical membrane damage and mitochondrial failure that do not recover.\n\nAfter $30$ minutes of reoxygenation for Culture 1 and reperfusion for Culture 2, which option best predicts the set of perturbations that will reverse promptly in Culture 1 and the set that will not reverse in Culture 2, based on the mechanisms above?\n\nA.

The sequence of events following hypoxia/ischemia—ATP depletion, ion pump failure, $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ dysregulation, structural changes, and the role of mitochondria (MPTP) and lysosomes—are textbook facts. The distinction between hypoxia (low oxygen) and ischemia (low oxygen and no flow) is also fundamentally correct and critical to the differing outcomes.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two distinct initial conditions (Culture 1 vs. Culture 2), a set of foundational principles, and asks for a logical deduction of the outcomes. The question is specific and a unique answer can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Complete and Consistent:** The information provided is sufficient to answer the question. The observations (e.g., lysosomal rupture and amorphous densities in Culture 2) are explicitly given as points of distinction that allow for a definitive conclusion based on the provided definitions of reversible and irreversible injury. There are no contradictions. The time scales ($15$ min vs. $120$ min) are physiologically relevant for inducing reversible vs. irreversible injury in cardiomyocytes.\n-   **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or unfalsifiable. It represents a standard conceptual problem in medical science education.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in applying the definitions of reversible and irreversible injury to the two scenarios.\n\n**Analysis of Culture 1 (Reversible Injury):**\nThe insult is transient hypoxia for $15$ minutes. The key factor is that perfusion is maintained. This allows for continued substrate delivery for anaerobic glycolysis and removal of toxic metabolites like lactic acid, mitigating the severity of the injury. The observed changes—decreased $[\\text{ATP}]$, failure of the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase leading to swelling and blebs, elevated cytosolic $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, ribosomal detachment, and transient MPTP opening—are all direct or indirect consequences of reduced ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation. However, the injury is limited in duration ($15$ min) and severity. The problem does not state that critical thresholds, such as lysosomal rupture or widespread permanent mitochondrial damage, have been reached.\n\nUpon reoxygenation, the following sequence is expected:\n1.  Oxygen is resupplied to the mitochondria, which are still functionally viable.\n2.  Oxidative phosphorylation resumes, leading to rapid regeneration of cellular $[\\text{ATP}]$.\n3.  With $[\\text{ATP}]$ restored, ATP-dependent ion pumps (Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase, $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps) regain function.\n4.  The Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase pumps $\\text{Na}^+$ out of the cell, restoring the ionic gradient. Water follows osmotically, so cellular swelling resolves and plasma membrane blebs are retracted.\n5.  $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps actively reduce cytosolic $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ to its normal low levels.\n6.  The stimuli for MPTP opening (low $[\\text{ATP}]$, high $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$) are removed. The transiently opened pores close, restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential and cementing the recovery of oxidative phosphorylation.\n7.  With cellular homeostasis being restored, structural changes like ribosomal detachment from the endoplasmic reticulum are also reversed.\n\nAll these events characterize a return to baseline, which is the definition of reversible injury.\n\n**Analysis of Culture 2 (Irreversible Injury):**\nThe insult is prolonged ischemia for $120$ minutes. The absence of both oxygen and perfusion is far more damaging. Anaerobic glycolysis quickly fails due to substrate exhaustion and self-inhibition by accumulated lactate, leading to profound and sustained ATP depletion and intracellular acidosis. The problem explicitly states that this prolonged insult has caused a \"point of no return\" damage:\n1.  **Lysosomal membrane rupture:** This releases potent acid hydrolases into the cytosol, which begin to indiscriminately digest cellular proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. This is a catastrophic, non-reversible event that commits the cell to death by necrosis.\n2.  **Mitochondrial amorphous densities:** These are ultrastructural markers of severe, irreversible mitochondrial damage, consisting of denatured proteins and calcium phosphate precipitates.\n3.  **Persistent MPTP opening:** The combination of severe ATP depletion, massive $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ overload, and high inorganic phosphate levels (from ATP hydrolysis) causes persistent, irreversible opening of the MPTP.\n\nUpon reperfusion (restoration of oxygen and flow), these non-reversible events dictate the outcome:\n1.  Despite the return of oxygen, the mitochondria cannot perform oxidative phosphorylation. The persistent MPTP opening dissipates the proton motive force (mitochondrial membrane potential), which is essential for ATP synthase to function. The mitochondria are permanently non-functional.\n2.  Furthermore, reperfusion can exacerbate damage (reperfusion injury). The influx of oxygen into damaged mitochondria with a dysfunctional electron transport chain leads to a burst of ROS, and the restored blood flow delivers more $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, worsening the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium overload. Both ROS and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ further promote MPTP opening and cause additional damage.\n3.  Since ATP cannot be regenerated, the cell cannot power its ion pumps. The Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase remains inactive, and the cell cannot correct the ion imbalances or swelling. Plasma membrane integrity is progressively lost.\n4.  The digestion of the cell by released lysosomal enzymes continues unabated, leading to widespread structural collapse. This culminates in plasma membrane rupture and the leakage of intracellular contents (including enzymes) into the surroundings.\n\nThus, in Culture 2, none of the initial perturbations can be reversed. The cell is irreversibly injured and will proceed to necrosis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Culture 1 reversals: restoration of Na+/K+ ATPase activity with normalization of ion homeostasis and swelling, resolution of plasma membrane blebs, reattachment of ribosomes, and closure of transiently opened MPTP with resumption of oxidative phosphorylation. Culture 2 non-reversals: lysosomal rupture with ongoing proteolysis, persistent MPTP opening associated with mitochondrial amorphous densities, and irreversible plasma membrane disruption with enzyme leakage.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option accurately describes the expected outcomes based on the principles of reversible and irreversible injury. The list of reversals in Culture 1 correctly follows the logical chain of events initiated by ATP restoration. The list of non-reversals in Culture 2 correctly identifies the critical, \"point-of-no-return\" events (lysosomal rupture, persistent MPTP opening) and their consequences.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Culture 1 reversals: lysosomal rupture with re-sealing of lysosomal membranes, persistence of MPTP opening, and sustained ribosomal detachment. Culture 2 non-reversals: rapid restoration of Na+/K+ ATPase and closure of MPTP, with blebs and swelling resolving.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option reverses the outcomes. It attributes signs of irreversible injury (lysosomal rupture, persistent MPTP) to the reversibly injured Culture 1. It incorrectly claims that the irreversibly injured Culture 2 would completely recover. This contradicts the problem statement and fundamental pathophysiology.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Culture 1 reversals: blebs and swelling resolve but MPTP remains open and oxidative phosphorylation does not resume; Na+/K+ ATPase remains inactive due to ATP depletion. Culture 2 non-reversals: ribosomes reattach and mitochondria close MPTP after reperfusion, while lysosomal rupture is inconsequential.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The description for Culture 1 is internally inconsistent. If the MPTP remains open and ATP is depleted, the Na+/K+ ATPase would be inactive, and consequently, blebs and swelling would *not* resolve. The description for Culture 2 is factually wrong; lysosomal rupture is a lethal event, not \"inconsequential,\" and the severely damaged mitochondria would not recover.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Culture 1 reversals: none of the measured perturbations reverse because reperfusion ROS keeps MPTP open and ATP low. Culture 2 non-reversals: lysosomes remain intact, while blebs, ribosomal detachment, and Na+/K+ ATPase failure all reverse with reperfusion.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option incorrectly classifies the reversible injury in Culture 1 as irreversible, overstating the effect of reperfusion ROS in a short, hypoxic insult. The description for Culture 2 is factually incorrect; the problem explicitly states lysosomal rupture occurred, and the other changes are characteristic of irreversible injury that would not reverse.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "introduction": "Fatty change, or steatosis, is a classic hallmark of reversible cell injury, particularly in organs like the liver. This practice allows you to build a quantitative model that directly connects a metabolic defect—impaired $\\beta$-oxidation due to hypoxia—to the progressive accumulation of triglycerides . Solving this problem will provide insight into the dynamic balance of metabolic pathways and how their disruption leads to observable structural changes.",
            "id": "4805696",
            "problem": "A hepatocyte subjected to moderate hypoxia exhibits reversible cellular injury characterized by fatty change (steatosis). Use the following well-tested biophysical principles as the fundamental base: (i) mass balance, where the time rate of change of a pool equals influx minus efflux, and (ii) first-order kinetics for removal processes, where the removal rate is proportional to the pool size. Consider the cytosolic free fatty acid pool to be large and buffered by adipose-derived supply such that, on the timescale examined, its concentration remains approximately constant at $FA_{0}$. Fatty acids arriving at the hepatocyte are esterified to triglyceride at a fixed net influx rate $J_{in}$, while mitochondrial $\\beta$-oxidation removes free fatty acids at a rate proportional to their concentration with rate constant $k_{\\beta}$. Triglyceride is exported via Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, modeled as a first-order process with rate constant $k_{VLDL}$.\n\nBefore hypoxia, the cell is at steady state. At time $t=0$, hypoxia decreases the $\\beta$-oxidation rate constant from $k_{\\beta}^{(0)}$ to $k_{\\beta}^{(1)}$, while $FA_{0}$ and $J_{in}$ remain unchanged. Assume:\n- $FA_{0} = 0.05$ mmol/g,\n- $J_{in} = 0.010$ mmol/(g·h),\n- $k_{VLDL} = 0.050$ h$^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\beta}^{(0)} = 0.140$ h$^{-1}$ (pre-hypoxia),\n- $k_{\\beta}^{(1)} = 0.040$ h$^{-1}$ (post-hypoxia).\n\nStarting from the stated principles, first derive the governing equation for the triglyceride pool $TG(t)$ under the approximation that $FA_{0}$ is constant over the timescale considered. Use the pre-hypoxia steady-state condition to determine $TG(0)$ immediately before the drop in $k_{\\beta}$ at $t=0$. Then, for $t>0$, solve the dynamics to determine $TG(t)$ under the new $k_{\\beta}^{(1)}$.\n\nCompute the triglyceride concentration at $t = 24$ h after the decrease in $\\beta$-oxidation. Round your final numeric result to four significant figures. Express the final answer in mmol/g.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the triglyceride concentration in a hepatocyte at a specific time after the onset of hypoxia, which reduces the rate of mitochondrial $\\beta$-oxidation.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated.\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- Principle (i): Mass balance: $\\frac{d(\\text{pool})}{dt} = \\text{Influx} - \\text{Efflux}$.\n- Principle (ii): First-order kinetics for removal: Removal Rate $\\propto$ Pool Size.\n- Cytosolic free fatty acid concentration is constant: $[FA] = FA_0$.\n- Fixed net influx rate for esterification: $J_{in}$.\n- $\\beta$-oxidation rate: proportional to $[FA]$ with rate constant $k_{\\beta}$.\n- VLDL secretion rate: first-order process with rate constant $k_{VLDL}$.\n- Pre-hypoxia ($t<0$): steady state.\n- At $t=0$: hypoxia starts, $k_{\\beta}$ changes from $k_{\\beta}^{(0)}$ to $k_{\\beta}^{(1)}$.\n- Constants: $FA_{0} = 0.05$ mmol/g, $J_{in} = 0.010$ mmol/(g·h), $k_{VLDL} = 0.050\\text{ h}^{-1}$, $k_{\\beta}^{(0)} = 0.140\\text{ h}^{-1}$, $k_{\\beta}^{(1)} = 0.040\\text{ h}^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the pathophysiology of hypoxic liver injury and hepatic steatosis. The modeling approach using mass balance and first-order kinetics is standard. The provided numerical values are physically consistent.\nThere is a critical ambiguity in the statement: \"Fatty acids arriving at the hepatocyte are esterified to triglyceride at a fixed net influx rate $J_{in}$.\"\nIf this means the rate of triglyceride synthesis is constant at $J_{in}$, then the governing equation for the triglyceride pool, $[TG]$, would be $\\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = J_{in} - k_{VLDL}[TG]$. In this model, the parameter for $\\beta$-oxidation, $k_{\\beta}$, does not appear, which implies that a change in $\\beta$-oxidation has no effect on triglyceride levels. This contradicts the central premise of the problem that hypoxia-induced reduction in $\\beta$-oxidation causes steatosis (triglyceride accumulation).\nTherefore, a more logical interpretation must be adopted for the problem to be coherent. The most consistent interpretation is that $J_{in}$ represents the total influx of fatty acids into the metabolic pathways of $\\beta$-oxidation and triglyceride synthesis. The system partitions this total influx between the two pathways. This interpretation makes the problem scientifically and logically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid under the interpretation that $J_{in}$ is the total fatty acid influx to be partitioned. I will now proceed with the solution based on this model.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nLet $[TG](t)$ be the concentration of the triglyceride pool. According to the mass balance principle:\n$$ \\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of TG synthesis}) - (\\text{Rate of TG export}) $$\nThe rate of TG export via VLDL secretion is a first-order process:\n$$ \\text{Rate of TG export} = k_{VLDL}[TG] $$\nThe rate of TG synthesis is determined by the fate of the incoming fatty acids. We interpret $J_{in}$ as the total influx of fatty acids available to the system. This influx is partitioned between $\\beta$-oxidation and esterification into triglycerides.\n$$ J_{in} = (\\text{Rate of } \\beta\\text{-oxidation}) + (\\text{Rate of TG synthesis}) $$\nThe rate of $\\beta$-oxidation is given as proportional to the free fatty acid concentration, $[FA] = FA_0$:\n$$ \\text{Rate of } \\beta\\text{-oxidation} = k_{\\beta} FA_0 $$\nTherefore, the rate of TG synthesis is what remains from the total influx:\n$$ \\text{Rate of TG synthesis} = J_{in} - k_{\\beta} FA_0 $$\nSubstituting these rates into the mass balance equation for $[TG]$ gives the governing differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = (J_{in} - k_{\\beta} FA_0) - k_{VLDL}[TG] $$\nHere, the rate constant $k_{\\beta}$ changes at $t=0$: $k_{\\beta} = k_{\\beta}^{(0)}$ for $t<0$ and $k_{\\beta} = k_{\\beta}^{(1)}$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Initial Condition from Pre-hypoxia Steady State**\nFor $t < 0$, the cell is in a steady state, meaning $\\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = 0$. The $\\beta$-oxidation rate constant is $k_{\\beta}^{(0)}$. The governing equation at steady state is:\n$$ 0 = (J_{in} - k_{\\beta}^{(0)} FA_0) - k_{VLDL}[TG(0)] $$\nSolving for the initial triglyceride concentration $[TG](0)$:\n$$ [TG](0) = \\frac{J_{in} - k_{\\beta}^{(0)} FA_0}{k_{VLDL}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$J_{in} = 0.010$ mmol/(g·h)\n$k_{\\beta}^{(0)} = 0.140\\text{ h}^{-1}$\n$FA_0 = 0.05$ mmol/g\n$k_{VLDL} = 0.050\\text{ h}^{-1}$\n$$ [TG](0) = \\frac{0.010 - (0.140 \\times 0.05)}{0.050} = \\frac{0.010 - 0.007}{0.050} = \\frac{0.003}{0.050} = 0.06 $$\nSo, the initial concentration is $[TG](0) = 0.06$ mmol/g.\n\n**Solving the Dynamics for $t > 0$**\nFor $t > 0$, the $\\beta$-oxidation rate constant is $k_{\\beta}^{(1)}$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = (J_{in} - k_{\\beta}^{(1)} FA_0) - k_{VLDL}[TG] $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Let's rewrite it in standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d[TG]}{dt} + k_{VLDL}[TG] = J_{in} - k_{\\beta}^{(1)} FA_0 $$\nThe term on the right-hand side is a constant. Let's define this constant source term as $S$:\n$$ S = J_{in} - k_{\\beta}^{(1)} FA_0 = 0.010 - (0.040 \\times 0.05) = 0.010 - 0.002 = 0.008 \\, \\text{mmol/(g·h)} $$\nThe equation is $\\frac{d[TG]}{dt} + k_{VLDL}[TG] = S$.\nThe general solution to this equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The new steady-state concentration, $[TG]_{\\infty}$, is the particular solution:\n$$ [TG]_{\\infty} = \\frac{S}{k_{VLDL}} = \\frac{0.008}{0.050} = 0.16 \\, \\text{mmol/g} $$\nThe general solution is of the form:\n$$ [TG](t) = [TG]_{\\infty} + C \\exp(-k_{VLDL}t) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration determined by the initial condition $[TG](0) = 0.06$ mmol/g.\nAt $t=0$:\n$$ [TG](0) = [TG]_{\\infty} + C \\exp(0) \\implies 0.06 = 0.16 + C \\implies C = 0.06 - 0.16 = -0.10 $$\nSo, the specific solution for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ [TG](t) = 0.16 - 0.10 \\exp(-k_{VLDL}t) $$\n\n**Compute Triglyceride Concentration at $t = 24$ h**\nWe need to calculate $[TG](24)$. We use the solution derived above with $t=24\\text{ h}$ and $k_{VLDL} = 0.050\\text{ h}^{-1}$:\n$$ [TG](24) = 0.16 - 0.10 \\exp(-0.050 \\times 24) $$\nThe exponent is $-0.050 \\times 24 = -1.2$.\n$$ [TG](24) = 0.16 - 0.10 \\exp(-1.2) $$\nUsing a calculator, $\\exp(-1.2) \\approx 0.3011942119$.\n$$ [TG](24) \\approx 0.16 - 0.10 \\times 0.3011942119 = 0.16 - 0.03011942119 = 0.12988057881 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$ [TG](24) \\approx 0.1299 $$\nThe final answer is expressed in mmol/g.",

The governing equation is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}} = J_{\\mathrm{pump}} + J_{\\mathrm{buffer}}$$\nSubstituting the given kinetic expressions:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}} = V_{\\max}\\frac{x}{K_m + x} + \\frac{x}{\\kappa}$$\nTo solve for $x$, we must rearrange this equation into a more tractable form. We can eliminate the denominators by multiplying the entire equation by $\\kappa(K_m + x)$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa(K_m + x) = \\left(V_{\\max}\\frac{x}{K_m + x}\\right)\\kappa(K_m + x) + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\kappa}\\right)\\kappa(K_m + x)$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa(K_m + x) = V_{\\max}\\kappa x + x(K_m + x)$$\nExpanding the terms on both sides of the equation yields:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa K_m + I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa x = V_{\\max}\\kappa x + K_m x + x^2$$\nWe now rearrange this into the standard quadratic form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$x^2 + (V_{\\max}\\kappa + K_m - I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa)x - I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa K_m = 0$$\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation are:\n$$a = 1$$\n$$b = K_m + \\kappa(V_{\\max} - I_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\n$$c = -I_{\\mathrm{in}}\\kappa K_m$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into these coefficients. The parameters are: $I_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$, $V_{\\max} = 0.15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$, $K_m = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $\\kappa = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe coefficient $b$ is:\n$$b = 0.30 + 2.0(0.15 - 0.10) = 0.30 + 2.0(0.05) = 0.30 + 0.10 = 0.40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe coefficient $c$ is:\n$$c = -(0.10)(2.0)(0.30) = -0.060\\,(\\mu\\mathrm{M})^2$$\nThe resulting quadratic equation for $x = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ is:\n$$x^2 + 0.40x - 0.060 = 0$$\nWe solve this equation using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{-0.40 \\pm \\sqrt{(0.40)^2 - 4(1)(-0.060)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-0.40 \\pm \\sqrt{0.16 + 0.24}}{2}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-0.40 \\pm \\sqrt{0.40}}{2}$$\nThis gives two mathematical solutions for $x$:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{-0.40 + \\sqrt{0.40}}{2}$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{-0.40 - \\sqrt{0.40}}{2}$$\nConcentration is a physical quantity and cannot be negative. The second root, $x_2$, must be negative because $\\sqrt{0.40}$ is a positive real number. Thus, $x_2$ is a physically meaningless solution and must be rejected. The only physically meaningful solution is $x_1$.\nWe proceed to calculate the value of $x_1$:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{-0.40 + \\sqrt{0.40}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-0.40 + 0.6324555}{2} = \\frac{0.2324555}{2}$$\n$$x_1 \\approx 0.1162277\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$x = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\approx 0.1162\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis value represents the stable steady-state cytosolic calcium concentration under the specified conditions.",
