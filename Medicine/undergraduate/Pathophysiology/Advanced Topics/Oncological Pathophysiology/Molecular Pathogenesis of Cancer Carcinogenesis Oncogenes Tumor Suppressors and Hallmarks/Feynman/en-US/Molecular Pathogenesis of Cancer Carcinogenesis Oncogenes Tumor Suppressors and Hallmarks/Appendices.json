            "problem": "An oncogenic transcription factor `$MYC$` is amplified in a tumor. Baseline diploid cells carry $2$ copies of the `$MYC$` locus, whereas the tumor sample shows $8$ copies. Independent of copy-number effects, chromatin remodeling measurements indicate a transcriptional upregulation that multiplies per-copy transcription by a factor of $4$ relative to the baseline state. Assume the following, grounded in the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein) and mass-action binding:\n\n- At steady state, the concentration of `$MYC$` protein, denoted `$[MYC]$`, is proportional to total transcript production, so that `$[MYC]$` scales with gene dose times per-copy transcription.\n- The downstream target promoter is activated by cooperative binding of `$MYC$` with Hill-type behavior characterized by Hill coefficient $n=2$.\n- The system operates in the low-occupancy regime where fractional promoter occupancy scales as a power of transcription factor concentration, so the fractional occupancy is proportional to `$[MYC]^{n}$`.\n- Downstream target gene expression output is proportional to fractional promoter occupancy, with all other regulatory influences held constant.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the provided measurements, compute the fold-change in downstream target gene expression in the tumor relative to the baseline.

The problem states that the total transcript production, let's call it $R_{total}$, scales with the product of these two quantities.\n    $$R_{total} \\propto G \\cdot R_p$$\n    The problem also states that the steady-state protein concentration, $[MYC]$, is proportional to the total transcript production.\n    $$[MYC] \\propto R_{total}$$\n    Combining these two proportionalities, we have:\n    $$[MYC] \\propto G \\cdot R_p$$\n    We can write this relationship for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$[MYC]_B = k_1 G_B R_{p,B}$$\n    $$[MYC]_T = k_1 G_T R_{p,T}$$\n    where $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in $MYC$ protein concentration is the ratio $\\frac{[MYC]_T}{[MYC]_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{[MYC]_T}{[MYC]_B} = \\frac{k_1 G_T R_{p,T}}{k_1 G_B R_{p,B}} = \\left(\\frac{G_T}{G_B}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_{p,T}}{R_{p,B}}\\right)$$\n    From the givens, we have:\n    - Gene copy number fold-change: $\\frac{G_T}{G_B} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\n    - Per-copy transcription fold-change: $\\frac{R_{p,T}}{R_{p,B}} = 4$.\n\n    Substituting these values:\n    $$\\frac{[MYC]_T}{[MYC]_B} = (4) \\cdot (4) = 16$$\n\n2.  **Fractional Promoter Occupancy ($O$)**\n    The problem states that promoter binding exhibits Hill-type behavior with a Hill coefficient $n=2$, and that in the low-occupancy regime, the fractional occupancy $O$ is proportional to $[MYC]^n$.\n    $$O \\propto [MYC]^n$$\n    We can write this for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$O_B = k_2 [MYC]_B^n$$\n    $$O_T = k_2 [MYC]_T^n$$\n    where $k_2$ is another constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in fractional occupancy is the ratio $\\frac{O_T}{O_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{O_T}{O_B} = \\frac{k_2 [MYC]_T^n}{k_2 [MYC]_B^n} = \\left(\\frac{[MYC]_T}{[MYC]_B}\\right)^n$$\n    We have already calculated $\\frac{[MYC]_T}{[MYC]_B} = 16$, and we are given $n=2$.\n    $$\\frac{O_T}{O_B} = (16)^2 = 256$$\n\n3.  **Downstream Target Gene Expression ($E$)**\n    Finally, the problem states that the downstream target gene expression $E$ is proportional to the fractional promoter occupancy $O$.\n    $$E \\propto O$$\n    Thus, for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$E_B = k_3 O_B$$\n    $$E_T = k_3 O_T$$\n    where $k_3$ is a third constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in expression, which is the desired final answer, is the ratio $\\frac{E_T}{E_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{E_T}{E_B} = \\frac{k_3 O_T}{k_3 O_B} = \\frac{O_T}{O_B}$$\n    From the previous step, we found that this ratio is $256$.\n    $$\\frac{E_T}{E_B} = 256$$\n\nThe fold-change in downstream target gene expression in the tumor relative to the baseline is $256$.",

            "introduction": "While oncogenes push the cell forward, tumor suppressor genes like `$TP53$` act as the essential \"brakes.\" This exercise shifts focus to the loss of these suppressors, demonstrating that not all mutations are created equal. You will use probability to model and contrast two distinct mechanisms of inactivation: haploinsufficiency, a simple dosage effect, and a dominant-negative effect, where a mutant protein actively poisons the function of its normal counterparts. This practice provides a quantitative understanding of why the specific type of mutation in a tumor suppressor gene can have profoundly different consequences for the cell. ",

            "problem": "Tumor protein `$p53$` (`$TP53$`) is a transcription factor that functions as a tetramer composed of four identical subunits. In carcinogenesis, loss of `$p53$` function can arise through dominant-negative missense mutations that retain tetramerization but impair function when incorporated, or through haploinsufficiency in which reduced dosage of functional subunits lowers overall activity without poisoning mixed complexes. Starting from fundamental definitions, recall that, by the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, allelic variation alters protein sequence and function, and that oligomeric complexes assemble from monomer pools according to mass action in a well-mixed cellular environment. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) `$p53$` must bind deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a tetramer to activate target gene transcription, (ii) mixed tetramers assemble randomly from the available monomer pool, and (iii) the cellular monomer pool contains a fraction $q$ of mutant subunits and a fraction $1 - q$ of wild-type subunits, with $0 \\le q \\le 1$, reflecting a heterozygous mutant state with equal expression from both alleles but allowing for any $q$ due to variable stability or expression.\n\nExplain, in mechanistic terms grounded in molecular pathophysiology, the difference between dominant-negative loss of function and haploinsufficiency for `$TP53$`. Then, model random tetramer assembly by selecting $4$ subunits independently from the monomer pool. Define the functional activity of a tetramer under two distinct mechanisms:\n- Dominant-negative: any tetramer containing at least one mutant subunit has activity $0$, and only an all wild-type tetramer has activity $1$.\n- Haploinsufficiency: the activity of a tetramer is proportional to the number of wild-type subunits it contains; a tetramer with $k$ wild-type subunits has activity $k/4$, with an all wild-type tetramer normalized to activity $1$.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and well-tested probability facts, derive a closed-form expression for the expected functional p53 tetramer fraction as a function of $q$ for each mechanism. Report your two expressions together as a row matrix, with the first entry corresponding to haploinsufficiency and the second entry corresponding to dominant-negative. No numerical substitution is required, and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The central task is to explain the molecular pathophysiological distinction between haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative loss of function for the `$p53$` protein and then to derive quantitative models for the expected functional activity in each case.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanistic distinction. The `$p53$` protein functions as a tetramer, a complex of four identical protein subunits, to bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor. In a state of heterozygosity for a `$TP53$` mutation, cells produce both wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) `$p53$` monomers.\n- **Haploinsufficiency**: This term describes a situation where the total level of functional protein is reduced simply because one of the two gene copies (alleles) is non-functional. For `$p53$`, a haploinsufficient mutation might be a null mutation that produces no protein or a protein that is immediately degraded. The consequence is a reduction in the total pool of available `$p53$` monomers. The problem specifies a more general model where the activity of a tetramer is proportional to the number of WT subunits it contains. This means a mixed tetramer is not completely non-functional, but its activity is diminished. It models a dose-dependent effect where each WT subunit contributes a quantum of activity, and the loss of activity is directly proportional to the loss of WT subunits.\n- **Dominant-Negative Effect**: This mechanism is more severe. A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that is structurally stable and can co-assemble with WT subunits into a tetramer. However, the presence of even one such mutant subunit within the tetramer is sufficient to \"poison\" the entire complex, rendering it non-functional. The mutant protein actively interferes with the function of the WT protein, dominating its phenotype. For `$p53$`, this means a mixed tetramer cannot bind DNA correctly or otherwise fails to activate transcription, making the functional output much lower than what would be predicted by simple gene dosage reduction.\n\nTo derive the functional fractions, we model the assembly of tetramers as $4$ independent Bernoulli trials. The probability of selecting a wild-type subunit is $p_{WT} = 1-q$, and the probability of selecting a mutant subunit is $p_{MUT} = q$. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of wild-type subunits in a tetramer. $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ (number of subunits) and $p = 1-q$ (probability of selecting a wild-type subunit). The probability mass function for $K$ is:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nwhere $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**1. Haploinsufficiency Model**\n\nThe activity of a tetramer with $k$ wild-type subunits is defined as $A_H(k) = \\frac{k}{4}$. The expected functional activity, $E[A_H]$, is the sum of the activities of all possible tetramer compositions, each weighted by its probability of formation.\n$$ E[A_H] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} A_H(k) P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\left(\\frac{k}{4}\\right) \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nWe can factor out the constant $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ E[A_H] = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=0}^{4} k \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nThe summation $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} k P(K=k)$ is the definition of the expected value of the binomial random variable $K$, which is given by $E[K] = np$. In this context, $n=4$ and $p=1-q$.\nTherefore, the expected number of wild-type subunits per tetramer is:\n$$ E[K] = 4(1-q) $$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for $E[A_H]$:\n$$ E[A_H] = \\frac{1}{4} E[K] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4(1-q) \\right) = 1-q $$\nThe expected functional fraction for the haploinsufficiency mechanism is $1-q$.\n\n**2. Dominant-Negative Model**\n\nThe activity of a tetramer is defined as $A_{DN}(k) = 1$ if and only if $k=4$, and $A_{DN}(k) = 0$ for $k4$. A tetramer is functional only if it is composed exclusively of wild-type subunits.\nThe expected functional activity, $E[A_{DN}]$, is:\n$$ E[A_{DN}] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} A_{DN}(k) P(K=k) $$\nSince $A_{DN}(k)$ is non-zero only for $k=4$, the sum collapses to a single term:\n$$ E[A_{DN}] = A_{DN}(4) \\cdot P(K=4) = (1) \\cdot P(K=4) = P(K=4) $$\nWe now calculate the probability that a tetramer has exactly $4$ wild-type subunits by setting $k=4$ in the binomial probability formula:\n$$ P(K=4) = \\binom{4}{4} (1-q)^4 q^{4-4} = (1) \\cdot (1-q)^4 \\cdot q^0 = (1-q)^4 $$\nThe expected functional fraction for the dominant-negative mechanism is $(1-q)^4$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting these two expressions as a row matrix, with haploinsufficiency first and dominant-negative second.",

This final practice confronts the clinical reality of cancer as an evolutionary process by modeling the emergence of drug resistance. By applying fundamental probability, you will calculate the likelihood that a tumor already contains resistant cells before therapy even begins, a phenomenon known as pre-existing resistance.

            "problem": "A solid tumor driven by a constitutively active oncogene expands clonally from a single transformed cell to a pre-therapy size of $N$ cells. Resistance to an impending targeted therapy can arise via a single point mutation in the oncogene’s kinase domain that, when present, confers drug insensitivity. Assume the following foundational, widely accepted facts: during each cell division, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is replicated and a specific resistance-conferring point mutation occurs with probability $\\mu$ per division; individual divisions are independent with respect to this mutational event; and, prior to therapy, there is no differential selection between resistant and non-resistant cells (mutants, if they arise, simply persist within the population). Further assume there is negligible cell death during the expansion for the time window considered, so that the population grew from $1$ cell to $N$ cells strictly by cell division.\n\nUsing only these premises and fundamental probability definitions, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the probability that the tumor harbors at least one resistant cell at the moment therapy begins (i.e., the probability of pre-existing resistance), as a function of $N$ and $\\mu$.

It is more straightforward to first calculate the complementary probability, $P_{\\text{no\\_resist}}$, which is the probability that the tumor contains *no* resistant cells. The desired probability can then be found using the relation:\n$$P_{\\text{resist}} = 1 - P_{\\text{no\\_resist}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the tumor grows from a single cell to $N$ cells strictly by cell division with negligible cell death. To increase the cell population by one, exactly one cell division must occur. Therefore, to grow from a population of $1$ cell to a population of $N$ cells, a total of $N-1$ cell divisions must have taken place.\n\nThe problem defines $\\mu$ as the probability that a resistance-conferring mutation occurs during a single cell division. Consequently, the probability that a mutation does *not* occur during a single cell division is $1 - \\mu$.\n\nThe problem states that individual divisions are independent with respect to this mutational event. The event of having no resistant cells in the final population of $N$ cells is equivalent to the event that none of the $N-1$ total divisions that occurred during the tumor's growth resulted in a resistance-conferring mutation.\n\nSince each of the $N-1$ divisions is an independent event, the probability that no mutation occurred across all of them is the product of the individual probabilities of no mutation occurring in each division.\n\nLet $D_i$ be the event of the $i$-th cell division, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N-1$.\nThe probability of no mutation in any given division $D_i$ is:\n$$P(\\text{no mutation in } D_i) = 1 - \\mu$$\n\nThe probability of no mutations occurring in any of the $N-1$ divisions is:\n$$P_{\\text{no\\_resist}} = P(\\text{no mutation in } D_1 \\cap \\text{no mutation in } D_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap \\text{no mutation in } D_{N-1})$$\n\nDue to the independence of these events:\n$$P_{\\text{no\\_resist}} = P(\\text{no mutation in } D_1) \\times P(\\text{no mutation in } D_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(\\text{no mutation in } D_{N-1})$$\n$$P_{\\text{no\\_resist}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{N-1} (1 - \\mu)$$\n$$P_{\\text{no\\_resist}} = (1 - \\mu)^{N-1}$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability that the tumor is completely free of resistant cells.
