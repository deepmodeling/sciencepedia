            "solution": "The problem asks for the multiplicative factor by which the Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) changes when the average arteriolar radius increases by $20\\%$ due to septic shock-induced vasodilation. The solution will be derived from first principles using the provided assumptions and Poiseuille's law.\n\nThe problem statement provides the following assumptions:\n1.  The flow of blood, a Newtonian fluid, is steady and laminar through the arteriolar network.\n2.  The arterioles are modeled as cylindrical tubes.\n3.  The arteriolar network is the dominant contributor to SVR.\n4.  SVR is proportional to the total hydrodynamic resistance of the arteriolar network.\n5.  Blood viscosity, $\\eta$, and the lengths of the arteriolar segments, $L$, remain constant.\n6.  The average arteriolar radius, $r$, increases uniformly by $20\\%$.\n\nWe begin with Poiseuille's law for the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through a single cylindrical tube:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nHydrodynamic resistance, which we will denote as $R_{hydro}$, is defined as the ratio of the pressure drop to the volumetric flow rate:\n$$R_{hydro} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\n\nBy rearranging Poiseuille's law, we can express the resistance of a single arteriolar segment as:\n$$R_{hydro} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\n\nThe problem states that SVR is proportional to the hydrodynamic resistance of the entire arteriolar network. The total resistance of the network, regardless of the specific parallel and series arrangement of the vessels, will be a function of the individual vessel resistances, $R_{hydro}$. Assuming the number of vessels and their configuration do not change, the total network resistance is directly proportional to the resistance of a single representative vessel segment. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\text{SVR} \\propto R_{hydro}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{hydro}$, we get:\n$$\\text{SVR} \\propto \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\n\nAccording to the problem, the viscosity $\\eta$ and length $L$ are constant. The terms $8$ and $\\pi$ are also constants. Therefore, we can express the relationship between SVR and the arteriolar radius $r$ as a simple proportionality:\n$$\\text{SVR} = \\frac{k}{r^4}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that consolidates all the invariant terms ($k \\propto \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi}$).\n\nLet $R_{\\text{old}}$ be the baseline SVR when the radius is $r_{\\text{old}}$, and let $R_{\\text{new}}$ be the SVR after vasodilation when the radius is $r_{\\text{new}}$. We can write:\n$$R_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{k}{r_{\\text{old}}^4}$$\n$$R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{k}{r_{\\text{new}}^4}$$\n\nThe problem states that the average arteriolar radius increases by $20\\%$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$r_{\\text{new}} = r_{\\text{old}} + 0.20 \\cdot r_{\\text{old}} = (1 + 0.20) \\cdot r_{\\text{old}} = 1.2 \\cdot r_{\\text{old}}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative factor by which SVR changes, which is the ratio $\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}}$. We can compute this ratio as follows:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k}{r_{\\text{new}}^4}}{\\frac{k}{r_{\\text{old}}^4}} = \\frac{k}{r_{\\text{new}}^4} \\cdot \\frac{r_{\\text{old}}^4}{k} = \\frac{r_{\\text{old}}^4}{r_{\\text{new}}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{old}}}{r_{\\text{new}}}\\right)^4$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $r_{\\text{new}}$ in terms of $r_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{old}}}{1.2 \\cdot r_{\\text{old}}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.2}\\right)^4$$\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value of this expression:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{1.2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1^4}{1.2^4} = \\frac{1}{2.0736}$$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2.0736} \\approx 0.482253086... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$0.48225... \\approx 0.4823$$\nThus, the SVR is reduced to approximately $48.23\\%$ of its original value, which signifies a profound drop in vascular resistance characteristic of septic shock. The multiplicative factor is $0.4823$.",

            "solution": "The total oxygen content in blood, denoted $C_x O_2$, is the sum of oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin and oxygen physically dissolved in plasma. The general expression is:\n$$\nC_x O_2 = (\\text{Hb} \\times k_{bind} \\times S_x O_2) + (\\alpha_{O_2} \\times P_x O_2)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{Hb}$ is the hemoglobin concentration in $\\text{g/dL}$, $k_{bind}$ is the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin ($1.34 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}$), $S_x O_2$ is the fractional oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, $\\alpha_{O_2}$ is the solubility of oxygen in plasma ($0.003 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL blood/mmHg}$), and $P_x O_2$ is the partial pressure of oxygen in $\\text{mmHg}$.

The Fick principle states that the uptake of a substance by an organ or the whole body is equal to the arterial inflow of the substance minus the venous outflow. For oxygen, this is:\n$$\nVO_2 = CO \\times (CaO_2 - CvO_2)\n$$\nUsing the same unit conversion for $CO$:\n$$\nVO_2 (\\text{mL/min}) = CO (\\text{L/min}) \\times 10 \\times (CaO_2 (\\text{mL/dL}) - CvO_2 (\\text{mL/dL}))\n$$\nUsing the given and calculated values:\n$$\nVO_2 = 5 \\text{ L/min} \\times 10 \\frac{\\text{dL}}{\\text{L}} \\times (12.97 \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} - 8.83 \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}})\n$$\n$$\nVO_2 = 50 \\frac{\\text{dL}}{\\text{min}} \\times 4.14 \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} = 207 \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{min}}\n$$\nThis value is already at three significant figures, so $VO_2 = 207 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$.\n\nFinally, the oxygen extraction ratio ($O_2ER$) is defined as the ratio of oxygen consumption to oxygen delivery.\n$$\nO_2ER = \\frac{VO_2}{DO_2} = \\frac{CO \\times (CaO_2 - CvO_2)}{CO \\times CaO_2} = \\frac{CaO_2 - CvO_2}{CaO_2}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values for $VO_2$ and $DO_2$:\n$$\nO_2ER = \\frac{207}{648.5} \\approx 0.319198...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $O_2ER = 0.319$.\n\nCommentary on physiological adequacy:\nA normal resting $DO_2$ for an adult is approximately $1000 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$. The calculated value of $649 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$ is significantly reduced, primarily due to the patient's anemia ($\\text{Hb} = 10 \\text{ g/dL}$) which cannot be fully compensated for by the high cardiac output state ($CO = 5 \\text{ L/min}$). A normal resting $VO_2$ is approximately $250 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$. The calculated $VO_2$ of $207 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$ is low, which in the context of sepsis (a high metabolic demand state) suggests that oxygen consumption is limited by supply. The normal oxygen extraction ratio is $0.25$ to $0.30$. The calculated $O_2ER$ of $0.319$ is elevated, indicating that tissues are extracting a larger fraction of the delivered oxygen to meet metabolic needs. This compensation mechanism demonstrates that the patient is on the verge of, or already experiencing, supply-dependent oxygen consumption. This state, where $VO_2$ becomes directly proportional to $DO_2$, signifies dysoxic shock and a high risk of cellular hypoxia and subsequent organ dysfunction (MODS), even in the presence of high cardiac output. The underlying pathophysiology in sepsis includes microcirculatory dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment, which can raise the critical $DO_2$ threshold below which supply dependency occurs. Therefore, this patient's oxygen delivery is inadequate for the metabolic demands of sepsis.",

This implies a multiplicative, not an additive, relationship. For a $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ temperature increase from $T$ to $T+1$, the new oxygen consumption $V(T+1)$ is related to the previous value $V(T)$ by:\n$$V(T+1) = V(T) + 0.10 \\times V(T) = (1 + 0.10) \\times V(T) = 1.10 \\times V(T)$$\nThis is a first-order recurrence relation describing a geometric progression.
