            "introduction": "The progression of an atherosclerotic plaque is not a simple, passive accumulation of cholesterol. It is a dynamic biological battleground characterized by inflammation, cell death (apoptosis), and the clearance of cellular debris (efferocytosis). This practice  invites you to model the growth of the plaque's necrotic core, a key driver of plaque instability, using a fundamental mass-balance equation. By exploring how a disruption in the clearance process impacts the core's final size, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how cellular-level dysfunctions fuel the macroscopic progression of this dangerous disease.",

            "problem": "Atherosclerotic plaque progression involves accumulation of a necrotic lipid-protein core formed by macrophage apoptosis and inadequate efferocytosis (clearance of dead cells and debris). Consider a lesion compartment in which the necrotic core volume is $N(t)$ (in $\\text{mm}^{3}$). In a time interval, the net change in $N$ can be represented by a mass-balance relation: production from apoptosis minus removal by efferocytosis and downstream clearance. Assume the following experimentally supported simplifications:\n- The apoptosis-driven production enters the core at a constant rate $a$ (in $\\text{mm}^{3}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$) under stable inflammatory stimulation.\n- Clearance by efferocytosis and downstream processing is proportional to the existing necrotic core volume, with proportionality constant $c$ (in $\\text{day}^{-1}$), reflecting that larger cores present more substrate for clearance but phagocytic capacity remains in a quasi-linear regime.\n\nUsing these assumptions and conservation of mass, derive the ordinary differential equation for $N(t)$ and the steady-state core volume $N^{*}$ under constant $a$ and $c$. Then, model impaired efferocytosis due to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and receptor shedding as a reduction of the clearance rate constant to $c' = \\tfrac{1}{2}c$. Compute the new steady-state necrotic core volume $N^{*}_{\\text{new}}$ in terms of $a$ and $c$.\n\nExpress the final steady-state necrotic core volume in $\\text{mm}^{3}$. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pathophysiology and mass-balance modeling, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\nThe evolution of the necrotic core volume, $N(t)$, is governed by the principle of mass conservation. The rate of change of the volume, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is equal to the rate of production minus the rate of removal.\n\nThe problem states that the production of necrotic material from apoptosis occurs at a constant rate, which we denote by the symbol $a$. The units of $a$ are $\\text{mm}^{3}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\nProduction Rate $= a$\n\nThe clearance of the necrotic core by efferocytosis is stated to be proportional to the existing necrotic core volume, $N(t)$. The proportionality constant is given as $c$, which has units of $\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\nClearance Rate $= c N(t)$\n\nCombining these terms, we can write the mass-balance equation as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = \\text{Production Rate} - \\text{Clearance Rate}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = a - c N(t)\n$$\nThis is the ODE governing the necrotic core volume as a function of time, $t$.\n\nA steady state is reached when the system no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition where the rate of change is zero. We denote the steady-state volume as $N^{*}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the ODE, we can solve for the initial steady-state necrotic core volume, $N^{*}$:\n$$\n0 = a - c N^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $N^{*}$ yields:\n$$\nc N^{*} = a\n$$\n$$\nN^{*} = \\frac{a}{c}\n$$\nThis represents the equilibrium volume where the rate of necrotic core production is exactly balanced by the rate of its clearance.\n\nNext, the problem introduces a condition of impaired efferocytosis. This pathological change is modeled as a reduction of the clearance rate constant, $c$, by a factor of $2$. The new clearance rate constant, $c'$, is given by:\n$$\nc' = \\frac{1}{2}c\n$$\nThe governing ODE under this new condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = a - c' N(t) = a - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right) N(t)\n$$\nWe are asked to find the new steady-state necrotic core volume, which we will denote as $N^{*}_{\\text{new}}$. Again, the steady-state condition is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = a - c' N^{*}_{\\text{new}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $c'$:\n$$\n0 = a - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right) N^{*}_{\\text{new}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $N^{*}_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right) N^{*}_{\\text{new}} = a\n$$\n$$\nN^{*}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{2}c}\n$$\n$$\nN^{*}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2a}{c}\n$$\nThis is the new steady-state necrotic core volume under the condition of impaired efferocytosis. This result indicates that halving the clearance efficiency leads to a doubling of the equilibrium necrotic core volume, a key insight into the progression of atherosclerosis. The units are $(\\text{mm}^{3}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}) / (\\text{day}^{-1}) = \\text{mm}^{3}$, which is dimensionally correct for a volume.",

            "solution": "This problem requires deriving the formula for stress in a thin spherical shell (Laplace's Law), using it to find the minimum required thickness to prevent rupture, and then calculating this thickness for a given set of clinical parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation**\n\n1.  **Model and Force Balance**: We model the plaque cap as a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel of radius $r$ and thickness $h$. Imagine cutting the sphere in half. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$ on the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere ($\\pi r^2$) must be balanced by the tensile stress $\\sigma$ acting on the material of the cut wall.\n2.  **Pressure Force ($F_P$)**: The force due to pressure pushes the two imaginary hemispheres apart. It is calculated as the pressure multiplied by the projected area over which it acts:\n    $$F_P = P \\times (\\pi r^2)$$\n3.  **Wall Tension Force ($F_T$)**: The tensile stress $\\sigma$ in the cap material resists this pressure force. This stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the cap's wall, which is approximately its circumference times its thickness:\n    $$A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx (2\\pi r) \\times h$$\n    The total force from wall tension is:\n    $$F_T = \\sigma \\times A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma \\times (2\\pi r h)$$\n4.  **Equilibrium**: For the cap to be stable, these forces must balance:\n    $$F_P = F_T \\implies P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\n5.  **Solving for Stress ($\\sigma$)**: We can rearrange the equation to solve for the tensile stress $\\sigma$:\n    $$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2\\pi r h} = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$$\n    This is the expression for tensile stress in the cap.\n6.  **Minimum Thickness ($h_{\\min}$)**: Rupture is predicted to occur if the stress $\\sigma$ exceeds the material's ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_c$.
