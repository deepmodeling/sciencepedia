This exercise  explores how to evaluate a diagnostic marker—in this hypothetical scenario, the presence of granulomas—using the fundamental metrics of sensitivity and specificity. Mastering these calculations is essential for interpreting medical literature and making informed clinical decisions based on test performance.",

            "problem": "A hospital-based cohort study evaluates the diagnostic utility of granuloma detection on ileocolonic biopsy as a test for Crohn’s disease within the broader spectrum of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). A multidisciplinary reference standard classifies patients as Crohn’s disease or non-Crohn’s disease after integrating clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histopathologic data. The granuloma detection assay is applied to all enrolled patients, and its outcomes are summarized as counts relative to the reference standard: true positives $TP$, false positives $FP$, true negatives $TN$, and false negatives $FN$. For this cohort, the observed counts are $TP = 96$, $FP = 22$, $TN = 88$, and $FN = 54$.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions used in clinical epidemiology for diagnostic test performance, compute the sensitivity and specificity of granuloma detection for Crohn’s disease in this cohort. Express both quantities as decimals, rounded to four significant figures, and report them in the following order: sensitivity first, specificity second. Your final response must be a single row vector in the form $\\begin{pmatrix} \\text{sensitivity} & \\text{specificity} \\end{pmatrix}$ and must contain only the two numbers without any units or symbols.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and conditions explicitly provided in the problem statement are:\n-   A diagnostic test (granuloma detection) is evaluated for Crohn’s disease.\n-   A reference standard classifies patients as having Crohn’s disease (disease present) or non-Crohn’s disease (disease absent).\n-   True positives ($TP$): The number of patients with Crohn's disease who test positive for granulomas. $TP = 96$.\n-   False positives ($FP$): The number of patients without Crohn's disease who test positive for granulomas. $FP = 22$.\n-   True negatives ($TN$): The number of patients without Crohn's disease who test negative for granulomas. $TN = 88$.\n-   False negatives ($FN$): The number of patients with Crohn's disease who test negative for granulomas. $FN = 54$.\n-   The task is to compute the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\n-   The results must be expressed as decimals rounded to four significant figures.\n-   The final output format must be a single row vector: $\\begin{pmatrix} \\text{sensitivity} & \\text{specificity} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental concepts of clinical epidemiology and diagnostic test evaluation. The metrics of sensitivity and specificity, and the definitions of $TP$, $FP$, $TN$, and $FN$ are standard in medical statistics. The context of differentiating Crohn's disease within the spectrum of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using histopathological features like granulomas is a well-established and clinically relevant scenario. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary numerical data ($TP$, $FP$, $TN$, $FN$) to calculate the required quantities. The definitions of sensitivity and specificity are unambiguous, leading to a unique solution. The instructions regarding rounding and output format are precise.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is a straightforward calculation based on provided data and standard definitions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The data are internally consistent and plausible for a clinical study of this nature.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires the application of the standard definitions of sensitivity and specificity from clinical epidemiology.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives (individuals with the disease) that are correctly identified as such. The total number of individuals with the disease in the cohort is the sum of true positives and false negatives ($TP + FN$). The formula for sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n$$\n\nSpecificity, also known as the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives (individuals without the disease) that are correctly identified as such. The total number of individuals without the disease in the cohort is the sum of true negatives and false positives ($TN + FP$). The formula for specificity is:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into these formulas.\n\nThe given counts are:\n$TP = 96$\n$FP = 22$\n$TN = 88$\n$FN = 54$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sensitivity:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{96}{96 + 54} = \\frac{96}{150}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = 0.64\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, we express it as:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = 0.6400\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the specificity:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{88}{88 + 22} = \\frac{88}{110}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = 0.8\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we express it as:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = 0.8000\n$$\n\nThe final answer must be reported as a single row vector in the order of sensitivity, then specificity.\nThe resulting vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6400 & 0.8000 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "Once a diagnosis of Crohn's disease is established, clinicians need a standardized way to measure disease activity and response to treatment. The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a classic, comprehensive tool that translates diverse clinical data into a single, quantifiable score. This practice problem  provides hands-on experience applying this index, illustrating how both patient-reported symptoms and objective clinical findings are weighted and combined to guide patient management.",

            "problem": "A clinician is following a patient with Crohn’s disease over $7$ consecutive days to quantify disease activity using the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI). The patient is a female. The following daily symptom logs were recorded using the standard CDAI scales, where daily abdominal pain is rated $0$ (none), $1$ (mild), $2$ (moderate), $3$ (severe); and daily general well-being is rated $0$ (well), $1$ (slightly under par), $2$ (poor), $3$ (very poor), $4$ (terrible). The number of stools recorded each day is the count of liquid or soft stools.\n\nDaily logs (Day $1$ to Day $7$):\n- Number of liquid or soft stools per day: $4$, $3$, $4$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n- Abdominal pain ratings: $1$, $2$, $2$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $1$.\n- General well-being ratings: $3$, $2$, $3$, $3$, $2$, $3$, $4$.\n\nComplications during the $7$-day period (each complication category, if present at any time during the week, is counted once): fever greater than $37.8$ degrees Celsius occurred on $2$ days, aphthous stomatitis was present, and an anal fissure was present. No other extraintestinal or perianal complications were documented.\n\nMedication and examination:\n- The patient used an antidiarrheal agent (loperamide) during the week.\n- On abdominal examination, an abdominal mass was judged definite by the examiner.\n- Laboratory data on Day $7$: hematocrit was $36$ (female). Use the conventional reference hematocrit for females of $42$ used in the CDAI.\n- Measured body weight was $63$ kilograms.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question that requires the application of the established Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) formula to a complete and consistent set of clinical data. The task is to calculate a single numerical score based on a deterministic algorithm.\n\nThe CDAI score is calculated as a weighted sum of eight variables.

We will now compute each component of the CDAI score based on the provided data for the $7$-day period.\n\n1.  Variable $x_1$: Sum of daily liquid or soft stool counts.\n    The daily counts recorded over $7$ days are: $4$, $3$, $4$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n    $$ x_1 = 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 25 $$\n    The contribution to the CDAI from this variable is $2 \\times x_1 = 2 \\times 25 = 50$.\n\n2.
