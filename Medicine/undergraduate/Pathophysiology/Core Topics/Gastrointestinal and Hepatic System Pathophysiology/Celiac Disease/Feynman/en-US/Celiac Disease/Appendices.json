Assume the following are true for the population and test under consideration: the disease prevalence is 0.01, the test sensitivity is 0.95, and the test specificity is 0.95. Assume no immunoglobulin A deficiency and that test characteristics do not vary across subgroups.\n\nUsing only the definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities, the Law of Total Probability, and Bayes’ theorem, derive expressions for the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value in terms of the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.

It provides a self-contained, consistent set of parameters from the field of medical diagnostics and asks for a standard application of probability theory. All necessary data are provided, and the task is to derive and calculate standard epidemiological metrics.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and translate the given information into the language of probability theory.\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has celiac disease.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that an individual does not have celiac disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result.\nLet $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed as probabilities:\nThe prevalence of the disease is $P(D) = p = 0.01$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+|D) = \\text{sens} = 0.95$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^-|D^c) = \\text{spec} = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce other necessary probabilities:\nThe probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\nThe false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\text{sens} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\text{spec} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nThe positive predictive value is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we write:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the Law of Total Probability, conditioning on the disease status ($D$ and $D^c$):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the symbolic representations for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity:\n$$ P(T^+) = (\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the formula for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sens})(p)}{(\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p)} $$\nThis is the general expression for PPV in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe negative predictive value is the probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nSimilarly, we find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the symbolic representations:\n$$ P(T^-) = (1 - \\text{sens})(p) + (\\text{spec})(1 - p) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the formula for NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{spec})(1 - p)}{(1 - \\text{sens})(p) + (\\text{spec})(1 - p)} $$\nThis is the general expression for NPV in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided values: $p = 0.01$, $\\text{sens} = 0.95$, and $\\text{spec} = 0.95$.\n\nFor the positive predictive value:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.01)}{(0.95)(0.01) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.01)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + (0.05)(0.99)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0495} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.059} \\approx 0.161016949... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} = 0.1610$.\n\nFor the negative predictive value:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(1 - 0.01)}{(1 - 0.95)(0.01) + (0.95)(1 - 0.01)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.99)}{(0.05)(0.01) + (0.95)(0.99)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.9405}{0.0005 + 0.9405} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.9405}{0.941} \\approx 0.999468650... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} = 0.9995$.\n\nThe results demonstrate the significant impact of prevalence on predictive values. Despite high sensitivity and specificity ($95\\%$), the low prevalence ($1\\%$) results in a low positive predictive value, meaning only about $16.1\\%$ of positive tests correctly identify an individual with the disease. Conversely, the negative predictive value is very high, indicating that a negative result is extremely reliable in ruling out the disease.",

The clinical presentation (anemia, bloating), serological markers (anti-tTG IgA, anti-EMA IgA), and histopathological findings (increased IELs, crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy) are all well-established and textbook features of this autoimmune disorder. The Marsh classification is the standard, internationally recognized system for grading the histopathology of celiac disease. The problem is firmly grounded in established medical science and pathology.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of observational data (histologic findings) and asks for their classification using a specified, defined system (Marsh classification). The information is sufficient and specific enough to map directly to one of the stages in the classification system, leading to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is precise and quantitative (e.g., \"$35$ IELs per $100$ enterocytes\", \"villus:crypt ratio is $1:1$\"). It avoids ambiguity and subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It represents a standard, formalizable task in medical diagnostics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe Marsh classification (often referred to as the Marsh-Oberhuber classification) provides a stepwise grading of the severity of mucosal injury in celiac disease. The progression is based on three key histologic features: an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), the development of crypt hyperplasia, and the subsequent onset and worsening of villous atrophy.\n\nThe stages are defined as follows:\n-   **Marsh $0$**: Normal mucosa.\n-   **Marsh $1$ (Infiltrative lesion)**: Characterized by an increased number of IELs (typically defined as $>20-25$ IELs per $100$ enterocytes), but the villous architecture and crypts remain normal.\n-   **Marsh $2$ (Hyperplastic lesion)**: In addition to increased IELs, there is proliferation of crypt enterocytes, leading to crypt hyperplasia (elongation and increased mitotic activity). The villous architecture is still preserved (i.e., no villous atrophy).\n-   **Marsh $3$ (Destructive lesion)**: This stage represents the classic celiac lesion, characterized by the triad of increased IELs, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. It is subdivided based on the severity of the villous atrophy:\n    -   **Marsh $3\\text{a}$ (Partial villous atrophy)**: Villi are still present but are blunted and shortened. The villus:crypt (V:C) ratio is reduced, typically falling below the normal $3:1$ to near $1:1$.\n    -   **Marsh $3\\text{b}$ (Subtotal villous atrophy)**: Villi are markedly atrophic and difficult to discern.\n    -   **Marsh $3\\text{c}$ (Total villous atrophy)**: Villi are completely absent, resulting in a flat mucosal surface.\n-   **Marsh $4$ (Hypoplastic lesion)**: Total villous atrophy is present, but it is accompanied by crypt hypoplasia, not hyperplasia. This is a rare and severe form, often associated with refractory celiac disease.\n\nWe will now map the patient's findings to this classification system.\n1.  **Increased IELs**: The finding of $35$ IELs per $100$ enterocytes is significantly above the normal threshold, satisfying the criterion for Marsh $1$ and all subsequent stages.\n2.  **Crypt Hyperplasia**: The finding of \"crypt elongation consistent with hyperplasia\" satisfies the criterion for Marsh $2$ and all subsequent stages. This rules out Marsh $1$.\n3.  **Villous Atrophy**: The finding of \"villous blunting\" and a V:C ratio of $1:1$ indicates the presence of villous atrophy. This rules out Marsh $2$, which requires preserved villous architecture. The lesion must therefore be at least Marsh stage $3$.\n4.  **Degree of Atrophy**: The problem specifies \"preservation of some villous structures without complete flattening\". This finding distinguishes partial/subtotal atrophy from total atrophy. A V:C ratio of $1:1$ with persisting, albeit blunted, villi is the hallmark of partial villous atrophy. Total villous atrophy (Marsh $3\\text{c}$) would be described as a \"flat\" mucosa, which is explicitly contradicted by the given information.\n\nTherefore, the combination of increased IELs, crypt hyperplasia, and partial villous atrophy (blunting with a V:C ratio of $1:1$) corresponds precisely to the definition of a Marsh $3\\text{a}$ lesion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n-   **A. Marsh $1$ (infiltrative lesion with increased IELs and normal architecture)**: Incorrect. The patient's biopsy shows crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy (V:C ratio of $1:1$), which are abnormalities of the mucosal architecture. Marsh $1$ requires normal architecture apart from the IEL infiltration.\n-   **B. Marsh $2$ (hyperplastic lesion with increased IELs and crypt hyperplasia but no villous atrophy)**: Incorrect. The patient's biopsy clearly demonstrates villous atrophy, as evidenced by \"villous blunting\" and a V:C ratio of $1:1$. Marsh $2$ is defined by the absence of villous atrophy.\n-   **C. Marsh $3\\text{a}$ (partial villous atrophy with increased IELs and crypt hyperplasia)**: Correct. This option perfectly matches the constellation of findings: increased IELs ($35$/$100$), crypt hyperplasia, and partial villous atrophy (blunting with a V:C ratio of $1:1$).\n-   **D. Marsh $3\\text{c}$ (total villous atrophy with increased IELs and crypt hyperplasia)**: Incorrect. The problem statement explicitly notes \"preservation of some villous structures without complete flattening\". This is inconsistent with total villous atrophy, which describes a complete loss of villi and a flat mucosal surface.",

            "introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is not always straightforward, and celiac disease can present in atypical ways, such as with negative antibody tests (seronegativity). This advanced scenario requires you to synthesize multiple streams of evidence to diagnose a patient whose serology does not align with their symptoms. This problem reinforces the core pathophysiology of celiac disease, emphasizing the foundational roles of genetic predisposition ($HLA-DQ2/DQ8$), the gluten trigger, and the resulting immunologically-mediated intestinal damage, which together form the basis for diagnosis even when serological markers are absent.

            "problem": "An adult patient has adhered to a strict gluten-free diet for approximately 12 months due to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. On this diet, tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG-IgA) serology is negative. Human leukocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) genotyping is positive. As part of a standardized gluten challenge, the patient consumes approximately 8 grams of gluten per day for 6 weeks and develops recurrent diarrhea. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsies reveals Marsh classification stage $3$ lesions (villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes).

The combination of HLA-DQ2 positivity and the induction of Marsh $3$ lesions after gluten reintroduction demonstrates major histocompatibility complex class II–restricted antigen presentation of deamidated gliadin, activation of CD$4^{+}$ T cells, and cytokine-mediated mucosal injury characteristic of celiac disease; serologic markers may be absent if exposure is limited in duration or in selective immunoglobulin A deficiency, making biopsy after challenge a valid confirmatory approach.\n\nB.

Only endomysial antibody (EMA) seroconversion can diagnose celiac disease; without EMA positivity, the diagnosis cannot be made even in the presence of Marsh $3$ changes following gluten challenge.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It describes a coherent and clinically realistic scenario for the diagnosis of celiac disease, specifically the case of seronegative celiac disease. All provided information—patient history, dietary intervention, serological results, genetic testing, gluten challenge protocol, and histopathological findings—is consistent with established medical and scientific principles. The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded, allowing for a rigorous analysis based on first principles of immunology and pathology.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe diagnosis of celiac disease rests on demonstrating a gluten-dependent enteropathy in a genetically susceptible individual. The core pathophysiology involves an adaptive immune response directed against gluten peptides in the small intestine.\n\n1.  **Genetic Susceptibility**: The vast majority ($>95\\%$) of individuals with celiac disease possess specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes, either HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. These molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, in the intestinal lamina propria. The patient's positive HLA-DQ2 genotype establishes this fundamental genetic predisposition.\n\n2.  **Antigen Processing and Presentation**: When a susceptible individual ingests gluten, its gliadin component peptides pass into the lamina propria. Here, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) deamidates specific glutamine residues within the gliadin peptides, converting them to glutamic acid. This modification significantly enhances the binding affinity of these peptides to the antigen-binding groove of the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules on APCs. The APCs then present these deamidated gliadin-peptide/HLA-DQ2 complexes on their surface.\n\n3.  **T-Cell Mediated Immunity and Mucosal Damage**: The presentation of these complexes to gluten-specific CD$4^{+}$ T helper cells in the lamina propria triggers their activation and proliferation. This is an MHC class II-restricted interaction. Activated CD$4^{+}$ T cells orchestrate an inflammatory cascade by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). This cytokine milieu leads to the characteristic histopathological changes of celiac disease:\n    *   **Villous atrophy**: Blunting and flattening of the intestinal villi, reducing the surface area for nutrient absorption.\n    *   **Crypt hyperplasia**: Elongation of the crypts of Lieberkühn as the intestinal stem cells attempt to regenerate the damaged epithelium.\n    *   **Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)**: An influx of lymphocytes, primarily CD$8^{+}$ cytotoxic T cells, into the epithelial layer, which contributes directly to the destruction of enterocytes.\n    The patient's duodenal biopsy showing Marsh classification stage $3$ lesions (villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased IELs) is the direct histological manifestation of this T-cell mediated process, induced by the reintroduction of gluten.\n\n4.  **Humoral (Antibody) Response**: The inflammatory process also activates B cells, leading to the production of antibodies. Key antibodies include those against deamidated gliadin peptides (anti-DGP) and against the TG2 enzyme itself. Antibodies directed against TG2 are detected by the tTG-IgA and the endomysial antibody (EMA) assays. Antibody production is gluten-dependent; levels typically fall and become undetectable after $6$-$12$ months on a strict gluten-free diet, explaining the patient's negative tTG-IgA result after $12$ months of adherence.\n\n5.  **Seronegativity in Active Disease**: The patient's tTG-IgA remains negative even after the $6$-week gluten challenge and confirmation of active disease via biopsy. This phenomenon, known as seronegative celiac disease, can occur for several reasons:\n    *   **Selective IgA Deficiency**: This is the most common reason. Approximately $2-3\\%$ of celiac patients have a systemic deficiency in producing Immunoglobulin A (IgA). In these cases, tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA tests will be falsely negative. Testing for tTG-IgG or total serum IgA is required to identify this condition.\n    *   **Insufficient Challenge Duration**: While a $6$-week challenge is standard, the serological response (rise in antibody titers) can lag behind the histological damage in some individuals. It may take longer than $6$ weeks for tTG-IgA to become positive.\n    *   **\"True\" Seronegativity**: A small subset of patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease do not mount a detectable antibody response to tTG, even without IgA deficiency.\n\nThe combination of HLA-DQ2 positivity (genetic predisposition), symptomatic relapse, and the development of classic Marsh $3$ histology upon a controlled gluten challenge provides definitive evidence for celiac disease, fulfilling all diagnostic criteria despite the negative serology.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The combination of HLA-DQ2 positivity and the induction of Marsh $3$ lesions after gluten reintroduction demonstrates major histocompatibility complex class II–restricted antigen presentation of deamidated gliadin, activation of CD$4^{+}$ T cells, and cytokine-mediated mucosal injury characteristic of celiac disease; serologic markers may be absent if exposure is limited in duration or in selective immunoglobulin A deficiency, making biopsy after challenge a valid confirmatory approach.**\nThis option accurately describes the entire pathophysiological sequence from genetic predisposition (HLA-DQ2) to the cellular mechanism (MHC class II-restricted presentation, CD$4^{+}$ T cell activation) leading to the observed outcome (cytokine-mediated mucosal injury manifested as Marsh $3$ lesions). It also provides scientifically correct and clinically relevant explanations for the seronegativity (insufficient duration of challenge or IgA deficiency). It correctly states that biopsy after a challenge is a valid and, in this case, necessary confirmatory step.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Negative tTG-IgA definitively excludes celiac disease because the assay is $100\\%$ sensitive and remains positive regardless of dietary gluten exposure, so histology cannot outweigh serology.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect on multiple counts. The tTG-IgA test is not $100\\%$ sensitive. Its sensitivity is high (typically $>95\\%$) but not absolute. Crucially, its positivity is highly dependent on ongoing gluten consumption; levels decline on a gluten-free diet. The duodenal biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard and can indeed outweigh serological findings, especially in cases of seronegative celiac disease or when patients are already on a gluten-free diet.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. HLA-DQ2 positivity alone is diagnostic of celiac disease; therefore, any biopsy findings are incidental and not required for diagnosis.**\nThis is incorrect. HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 indicates genetic susceptibility, which is present in a large portion of the general population (approx. $30-40\\%$). The vast majority of these individuals never develop celiac disease. Therefore, HLA positivity has a very low positive predictive value and is not diagnostic on its own. It is primarily used for its high negative predictive value (a negative result essentially rules out celiac disease).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Marsh $3$ lesions are nonspecific and can be entirely explained by lactose intolerance after gluten challenge, so celiac disease is unlikely.**\nThis is incorrect. While villous atrophy (a component of Marsh $3$ lesions) is not entirely specific to celiac disease, it is highly characteristic, and its induction by a gluten challenge in an HLA-DQ2 positive individual is strongly indicative of celiac disease. Furthermore, lactose intolerance is a condition of enzyme deficiency (lactase) that causes symptoms like diarrhea but does *not* cause the severe immunologically-mediated mucosal destruction seen in Marsh $3$ lesions. Secondary lactose intolerance can be a *consequence* of the villous atrophy from celiac disease, not the cause of it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Only endomysial antibody (EMA) seroconversion can diagnose celiac disease; without EMA positivity, the diagnosis cannot be made even in the presence of Marsh $3$ changes following gluten challenge.**\nThis is incorrect. EMA targets the same antigen as tTG-IgA. While highly specific, it is not the sole diagnostic criterion. The diagnostic cornerstone, particularly in complex or seronegative cases, is the duodenal biopsy demonstrating characteristic gluten-dependent enteropathy. A diagnosis of celiac disease can be, and often is, made in the absence of positive EMA or tTG-IgA serology when other criteria (genetics, clinical response to diet, and histology) are met.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
