            "problem": "A patient with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) undergoes motor nerve conduction studies. A prior electrophysiological assessment documented a baseline conduction velocity of $55\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ along the same nerve segment under comparable conditions. The current study, performed with limb temperature controlled and the same inter-electrode distance, measures a conduction velocity of $35\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. Starting from the definition of conduction velocity as distance traveled over time and the established physiological role of myelin in enabling saltatory conduction, use well-tested clinical neurophysiology facts that demyelination reduces conduction velocity by increasing membrane capacitance and decreasing effective internodal length. For the purpose of classifying demyelination from serial studies, use the widely employed electrodiagnostic rule that a decrease in motor conduction velocity by at least $0.30$ (that is, $30$ divided by $100$) relative to a patient’s prior baseline supports demyelination when other confounders are controlled.\n\nCompute the fractional reduction in conduction velocity relative to baseline. Then, based on the stated rule, determine whether demyelination criteria are met. Report only the fractional reduction as your final numeric answer, rounded to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a unitless decimal fraction (the percentage divided by $100$).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the fractional reduction in motor nerve conduction velocity and a subsequent determination of whether this reduction meets a specified clinical criterion for demyelination. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables provided. The baseline conduction velocity is denoted as $v_{\\text{baseline}}$, and the currently measured conduction velocity is denoted as $v_{\\text{current}}$.\nThe given values are:\n- Baseline conduction velocity: $v_{\\text{baseline}} = 55\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Current conduction velocity: $v_{\\text{current}} = 35\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe absolute reduction in conduction velocity, $\\Delta v$, is the difference between the baseline and current velocities:\n$$\n\\Delta v = v_{\\text{baseline}} - v_{\\text{current}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta v = 55\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} - 35\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 20\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe fractional reduction, which we will denote as $f_r$, is defined as the ratio of the absolute reduction to the original baseline value. This provides a normalized, unitless measure of the change, which is essential for comparing changes across different nerves or patients.\n$$\nf_r = \\frac{\\Delta v}{v_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{baseline}} - v_{\\text{current}}}{v_{\\text{baseline}}}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the numerical values into this expression to calculate the fractional reduction:\n$$\nf_r = \\frac{55 - 35}{55} = \\frac{20}{55}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\nf_r = \\frac{4}{11}\n$$\nTo compare this value with the clinical criterion, we convert the fraction to its decimal representation.\n$$\nf_r = \\frac{4}{11} \\approx 0.363636...\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the final numeric answer should be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $6$, $3$, and $6$. The fifth digit is a $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down by truncating the decimal expansion.\n$$\nf_r \\approx 0.3636\n$$\n\nNext, we must apply the electrodiagnostic rule provided in the problem statement. The rule states that demyelination is supported if the fractional decrease in motor conduction velocity is at least $0.30$. Let the threshold for this criterion be $T = 0.30$.\nWe must compare our calculated fractional reduction, $f_r$, to this threshold $T$.\n$$\nf_r \\approx 0.3636\n$$\n$$\nT = 0.30\n$$\nThe comparison is:\n$$\n0.3636 > 0.30\n$$\nSince the calculated fractional reduction of approximately $0.3636$ is greater than the threshold of $0.30$, the criteria for demyelination are met according to the rule provided.\n\nThe problem, however, asks to report only the fractional reduction as the final numeric answer. Therefore, the final answer is the calculated value of $f_r$ rounded to four significant figures.",

            "problem": "A $22$-year-old man presents with rapidly progressive, symmetric flaccid weakness of all limbs and areflexia over $3$ days, without sensory complaints. One week prior, he had watery diarrhea attributed to Campylobacter jejuni. Examination shows Medical Research Council grade $3/5$ strength diffusely with intact pinprick and vibration sense. Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) reveal normal sural Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP) amplitude of $15 \\ \\mu$V and preserved sensory conduction velocity, but markedly reduced peroneal Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) amplitude of $0.8$ mV with relatively preserved motor conduction velocity.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Patient Demographics:** $22$-year-old man.\n- **Clinical Presentation:** Rapidly progressive, symmetric flaccid weakness of all limbs and areflexia over $3$ days.

The association with antecedent *C. jejuni* infection, the pure motor clinical deficit, the characteristic electrodiagnostic findings (low CMAP amplitudes with normal SNAP amplitudes), the presence of anti-$GM1$ antibodies, and the pathological finding of complement deposition at motor nodes of Ranvier are all well-established scientific facts. The foundational bases provided are correct principles of immunology and neurophysiology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a comprehensive and internally consistent clinical and pathological picture and asks for an explanation of a key feature (sensory sparing) based on the provided data and foundational principles. It is structured to have a single best answer among the choices.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, clinical, and scientific language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Mechanism**\n\nThe patient's condition is Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), a variant of GBS characterized by pure motor deficits. The key feature to explain is why sensory axons are spared.\n\n1.  **The Pathogenic Agent and Target:** The high titer of anti-$GM1$ $IgG$ antibodies strongly implicates them as the pathogenic agent. According to foundational basis (i), these antibodies must bind to their specific antigen, the ganglioside $GM1$, where it is present at a sufficient density.\n\n2.  **The Site of Injury:** The biopsy reveals $C3$ deposition specifically at the nodes of Ranvier of motor axons. The node of Ranvier is a critical site for nerve impulse propagation, as described in foundational basis (iii). The presence of $C3$ indicates activation of the complement cascade. Since the antibody is of the $IgG$ class, it activates the classical complement pathway upon binding to its antigen.\n\n3.  **The Mechanism of Injury:** Per foundational basis (ii), complement fixation by bound $IgG$ leads to the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which damages the cell membrane. This damage at the motor nodal axolemma disrupts the function of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to conduction block and/or axonal degeneration. This explains the weakness, areflexia, and the profoundly reduced CMAP amplitudes seen in the NCS.\n\n4.  **The Explanation for Sensory Sparing:** The clinical picture (no sensory complaints), physical exam (intact sensation), and NCS findings (normal sural SNAP) all confirm that sensory fibers are unaffected. Given that the attack is mediated by anti-$GM1$ antibodies, the most parsimonious explanation is that the target antigen, $GM1$, is not present in sufficient density on sensory axons to trigger a significant autoimmune response. Foundational basis (iii) explicitly states that motor and sensory fibers differ in the molecular composition of their nodes of Ranvier. Therefore, the differential distribution of the $GM1$ ganglioside—being highly concentrated at motor nodes but sparse at sensory nodes—accounts for the motor-specific tropism of the disease. The antibodies bind predominantly to motor nodes, leading to localized, complement-mediated injury, while sensory nodes are spared.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Motor nodes of Ranvier have higher surface densities of GM1 and GD1a gangliosides at the nodal axolemma and Schwann cell paranodal loops than do sensory fibers; anti-ganglioside IgG therefore binds and fixes complement predominantly at motor nodes, disrupting nodal sodium channel function and causing conduction failure confined to motor axons.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement perfectly aligns with the derived mechanism. It correctly identifies the differential density of the target antigen ($GM1$) between motor and sensory nodes as the primary reason for the specific targeting. It accurately describes the subsequent steps: antibody binding, complement fixation, and disruption of nodal function leading to motor-specific conduction failure. The inclusion of $GD1a$ is also relevant as it is another ganglioside associated with GBS variants and its distribution follows a similar pattern. This is the accepted pathophysiological mechanism for AMAN.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Sensory neuron cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia are protected by an impermeable blood–nerve barrier that excludes circulating antibodies, whereas motor axons lack such a barrier along their entire peripheral course, preventing antibody access to sensory fibers.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is factually incorrect. The blood-nerve barrier is weakest, not strongest, at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), making them particularly vulnerable to circulating antibodies. This is the basis of sensory neuronopathies. Both motor and sensory axons within nerve fascicles are protected by a relatively robust blood-nerve barrier. The premise that a barrier protects sensory cell bodies while motor axons are unprotected is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. AMAN reflects primary segmental demyelination restricted to ventral roots due to autoimmunity against myelin basic protein, so sensory axons are spared because they are myelinated by different glial cells.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains multiple fundamental errors. First, AMAN is an axonal, not a demyelinating, neuropathy, as confirmed by the NCS findings (axonal markers like low amplitude are affected, while demyelinating markers like slowed velocity are less so) and pathology (injury to the axolemma at the node). Second, the autoantigen in this case is the ganglioside $GM1$, not myelin basic protein. Third, in the peripheral nervous system, both motor and sensory axons are myelinated by the same type of glial cell, the Schwann cell.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Sensory axons in peripheral nerves lack nodes of Ranvier and therefore cannot develop nodal pathology from anti-ganglioside antibodies.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is neuroanatomically false. All large, myelinated axons, whether motor or sensory (e.g., those carrying vibration and proprioceptive information), possess nodes of Ranvier to facilitate rapid saltatory conduction. The normal sural SNAP confirms the integrity of large myelinated sensory axons, which absolutely have nodes of Ranvier.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Sensory fibers predominantly express GM1 and GD1a gangliosides at higher density than motor fibers, but they are protected from complement-mediated injury by uniformly higher expression of complement regulatory proteins compared with motor fibers.**\n- **Analysis:** The first part of this statement is the opposite of the established fact. To explain a pure motor neuropathy mediated by anti-$GM1$ antibodies, the target antigen ($GM1$) must be concentrated on motor axons. If sensory fibers had a higher density of $GM1$, they would be the primary target, resulting in a sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy, which contradicts the patient's presentation. While differential expression of complement regulatory proteins is a valid biological concept, the premise regarding antigen density is incorrect in this context and makes the entire option invalid as an explanation for AMAN.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical neurology and pathophysiology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The model and parameters presented are consistent with real-world clinical prediction tools used for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Computation of Predicted Probability\n\nThe problem asks for the probability, $p$, that the patient will be unable to walk independently at $4$ weeks. This probability is calculated using the provided logistic regression model.\n\nThe linear predictor, $\\mathcal{L}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} \\;=\\; \\beta_{0} \\;+\\; \\beta_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\text{age in years}}{10}\\right) \\;+\\; \\beta_{2}\\,D \\;+\\; \\beta_{3}\\,C\n$$\nThe probability $p$ is then given by the logistic function:\n$$\np \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\mathcal{L})}\n$$\nFirst, we must determine the values of the predictor variables based on the patient's data:\n- The patient's age is $65$ years. Therefore, the age term is $\\frac{65}{10} = 6.5$.\n- The patient had preceding watery diarrhea. This means the indicator variable for diarrhea, $D$, is equal to $1$.\n- Nerve conduction studies show Compound Motor Action Potential (CMAP) amplitudes below $20\\%$ of the lower limit of normal (LLN). This means the indicator variable for low CMAP, $C$, is equal to $1$.\n\nNext, we substitute these values and the given regression coefficients ($\\beta_{0} = -3.0$, $\\beta_{1} = 0.35$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.70$, $\\beta_{3} = 1.20$) into the equation for the linear predictor $\\mathcal{L}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -3.0 + (0.35)(6.5) + (0.70)(1) + (1.20)(1)\n$$\nWe perform the calculation step-by-step:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -3.0 + 2.275 + 0.70 + 1.20\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -3.0 + 4.175\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = 1.175\n$$\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\mathcal{L}$ into the logistic function to compute the probability $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-1.175)}\n$$\nCalculating the value of the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-1.175) \\approx 0.30882\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $p$:\n$$\np \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.30882} = \\frac{1}{1.30882} \\approx 0.76405\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\np \\approx 0.764\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Pathophysiological Explanation of Predictors\n\nThe model includes three predictors: age, preceding diarrhea, and low CMAP amplitudes. Each is associated with a poorer prognosis for independent walking at $4$ weeks due to distinct, but interconnected, pathophysiological mechanisms. The positive coefficients ($\\beta_{1} = 0.35$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.70$, $\\beta_{3} = 1.20$) confirm that each of these factors increases the log-odds of a poor outcome.\n\n**1. Age:** Older age is a well-established negative prognostic factor in GBS. The underlying mechanisms include:\n- **Diminished Regenerative Capacity:** The peripheral nervous system (PNS) possesses an intrinsic ability to repair itself after injury. This includes remyelination of demyelinated axons by Schwann cells and regrowth of severed axons (axonal regeneration). This regenerative potential declines significantly with age. Consequently, an older patient's ability to repair the nerve damage inflicted by the autoimmune attack in GBS is less efficient and less complete than in a younger individual, leading to slower and poorer functional recovery.\n- **Immunosenescence:** The aging of the immune system, or immunosenescence, leads to dysregulated immune responses. This can manifest as a more severe initial pro-inflammatory cascade causing greater nerve damage, and/or a less effective resolution phase, prolonging the disease course.\n- **Reduced Physiological Reserve and Comorbidities:** Older individuals typically have lower physiological reserves and a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease) which can independently compromise nerve health and the body's overall capacity to recover from a severe illness like GBS.\n\n**2. Preceding Diarrhea:** A history of diarrhea preceding the onset of GBS is a strong predictor of a more severe disease course. This is primarily because of its association with a specific infectious trigger and a specific GBS subtype.\n- **Association with *Campylobacter jejuni* and Axonal GBS:** The most common infectious agent associated with GBS is the bacterium *Campylobacter jejuni*, a frequent cause of gastroenteritis with diarrhea. GBS following *C. jejuni* infection is strongly linked to the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of GBS, rather than the more common acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) in Western countries.\n- **Molecular Mimicry:** The pathogenic mechanism involves molecular mimicry. Specific strains of *C. jejuni* possess lipooligosaccharides (LOS) on their outer membrane that are structurally homologous to gangliosides (e.g., $GM1$, $GD1a$) present on the surface of human peripheral nerve axons, particularly concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. The host immune system generates antibodies (primarily of the IgG class) against the bacterial LOS. These antibodies cross-react with the gangliosides on the axolemma (the axon's cell membrane).\n- **Axonal Damage:** The binding of these autoantibodies to the axon triggers the classical complement pathway, leading to the formation and deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC creates pores in the axolemma, disrupting ionic gradients, causing an influx of calcium, activating proteases, and ultimately leading to acute axonal degeneration (Wallerian degeneration). This direct attack on the axon is structurally more destructive than demyelination (where the axon is spared), resulting in a more rapid, severe weakness and a much slower, often incomplete, recovery.\n\n**3. Low CMAP Amplitudes:** The CMAP amplitude is an electrophysiological measure that reflects the number of motor axons capable of conducting an action potential to the target muscle. Severely reduced CMAP amplitudes are a direct and quantitative indicator of severe pathophysiology.\n- **Indicator of Axonal Loss:** A low CMAP amplitude signifies that a large proportion of motor axons in the tested nerve have either been destroyed or are experiencing conduction failure. While some conduction block can occur in demyelination, a profound reduction in CMAP amplitudes (e.g., below $20\\%$ of normal) early in the disease course is the electrophysiological hallmark of widespread axonal loss, characteristic of the AMAN variant described above.\n- **Prognostic Significance for Recovery:** The type of nerve injury dictates the mechanism and timeline of recovery. Recovery from demyelination requires Schwann cells to remyelinate the intact axons, a process that can be relatively rapid (weeks to months). In contrast, recovery from axonal loss requires the neuron to regenerate the entire axon from the point of injury down to the muscle, a process that is extremely slow (at a rate of approximately $1$ mm/day) and frequently incomplete. Therefore, low CMAP amplitudes, by quantifying the extent of axonal destruction, directly predict a longer and more arduous path to recovery and a higher probability of persistent severe weakness and disability at both short-term ($4$ weeks) and long-term follow-up.",
