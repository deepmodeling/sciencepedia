            "problem": "A clinician is estimating the Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) for a physically active adult male as part of a preventive health plan. Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is a component of energy expenditure defined as the energy cost of maintaining vital body functions at rest. The Mifflin–St Jeor method is a widely used, empirically derived approach to estimate RMR in adults based on body weight, stature, age, and sex. Physical Activity Level (PAL) is used as a dimensionless multiplier to capture the increase in energy expenditure due to habitual physical activity relative to rest. The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) is the energetic cost of digesting, absorbing, and processing nutrients and is commonly approximated in clinical practice as a fixed fraction of energy expended outside of TEF. Assume TEF can be approximated as $0.10$ of the non-TEF expenditure, and that PAL does not include TEF in this context.\n\nGiven a $30$-year-old male with body weight $70 \\, \\mathrm{kg}$ and height $175 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$, use the Mifflin–St Jeor method to estimate RMR, then model TEE as the sum of RMR, physical activity expenditure captured by PAL $=1.6$, and TEF as described above. Express the final energy in $\\mathrm{kcal/day}$ and round your answer to $4$ significant figures. The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Subject:** Adult male\n- **Age ($A$):** $30$ years\n- **Body weight ($W$):** $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$\n- **Height ($H$):** $175$ $\\mathrm{cm}$\n- **Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) estimation method:** Mifflin–St Jeor method\n- **Physical Activity Level (PAL):** $P = 1.6$\n- **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) factor ($f_{TEF}$):** $0.10$ of the non-TEF expenditure.\n- **Model for Total Energy Expenditure (TEE):** TEE is the sum of RMR, physical activity expenditure, and TEF. It is specified that PAL does not include TEF.\n- **Required output:** TEE in $\\mathrm{kcal/day}$, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. The Mifflin–St Jeor equation is a standard, empirically validated formula in clinical nutrition for estimating RMR. The concepts of RMR, PAL, and TEF are fundamental principles of human energy metabolism. The given physiological data and PAL value are realistic. The approximation for TEF is a standard convention.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It requires the application of a specific named formula (Mifflin–St Jeor) and provides a clear, albeit specific, model for calculating TEE from its components. The relationship between the components is defined without ambiguity:\n    -   Non-TEF expenditure is the portion of energy expenditure related to RMR and physical activity. PAL is a multiplier for RMR to account for activity, so Non-TEF Expenditure $= RMR \\times P$.\n    -   TEF is explicitly defined as a fraction of the non-TEF expenditure: $TEF = f_{TEF} \\times (RMR \\times P)$.\n    -   TEE is the sum of all components: $TEE = (RMR \\times P) + TEF$.\n    This structure leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n3.  **Completeness:** The problem omits the explicit formula for the Mifflin–St Jeor method. However, this is a standard, named equation in the specified field, analogous to referencing the \"Ideal Gas Law\" or \"Newton's Second Law\" without writing out $PV = nRT$ or $F = ma$. For a practitioner or student in the field, this formula is considered known or readily available standard information. Therefore, the problem is considered effectively complete.\n4.  **Objectivity and Other Criteria:** The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, is not based on flawed premises, and is not trivial. It requires a multi-step calculation based on established scientific models.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in three stages:\n1.  Calculation of the Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) using the Mifflin–St Jeor equation.\n2.  Calculation of the non-TEF energy expenditure using the RMR and the Physical Activity Level (PAL).\n3.  Calculation of the Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) by adding the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF).\n\n**Stage 1: Calculate RMR**\nThe Mifflin–St Jeor equation for estimating RMR in males is:\n$$RMR = (10.0 \\times W) + (6.25 \\times H) - (5.0 \\times A) + 5$$\nwhere $W$ is weight in $\\mathrm{kg}$, $H$ is height in $\\mathrm{cm}$, and $A$ is age in years. The result is in $\\mathrm{kcal/day}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $W = 70 \\, \\mathrm{kg}$\n-   $H = 175 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$\n-   $A = 30 \\, \\mathrm{years}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$RMR = (10.0 \\times 70) + (6.25 \\times 175) - (5.0 \\times 30) + 5$$\n$$RMR = 700 + 1093.75 - 150 + 5$$\n$$RMR = 1648.75 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\n\n**Stage 2: Calculate Non-TEF Expenditure**\nThe problem defines a model where PAL is a multiplier for RMR to determine the energy expenditure from resting metabolism and physical activity combined, which we denote as non-TEF expenditure ($E_{non-TEF}$).\nThe given PAL is $P = 1.6$.\n$$E_{non-TEF} = RMR \\times P$$\n$$E_{non-TEF} = 1648.75 \\times 1.6$$\n$$E_{non-TEF} = 2638 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\n\n**Stage 3: Calculate TEE**\nTotal Energy Expenditure (TEE) is the sum of the non-TEF expenditure and the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). TEF is given as $10\\%$ ($f_{TEF} = 0.10$) of the non-TEF expenditure.\n$$TEF = f_{TEF} \\times E_{non-TEF}$$\n$$TEF = 0.10 \\times 2638$$\n$$TEF = 263.8 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\n\nThe TEE is then:\n$$TEE = E_{non-TEF} + TEF$$\n$$TEE = 2638 + 263.8$$\n$$TEE = 2901.8 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed as:\n$$TEE = E_{non-TEF} \\times (1 + f_{TEF})$$\n$$TEE = 2638 \\times (1 + 0.10)$$\n$$TEE = 2638 \\times 1.1$$\n$$TEE = 2901.8 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\n\n**Final Rounding**\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is $2901.8$. The first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $0$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $8$, so the fourth digit is rounded up.\n$$TEE_{\\text{rounded}} = 2902 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/day}$$",

The patient's nitrogen balance in grams of nitrogen per day, rounded to three significant figures.\n    2.  An interpretation of the physiological meaning of the result.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the concept of nitrogen balance, a cornerstone of metabolic and nutritional assessment. The formula for nitrogen balance is defined as nitrogen intake minus nitrogen output. The conversion factor for protein to nitrogen ($16\\%$, equivalent to dividing protein mass by $6.25$) is a standard, accepted approximation in nutrition science. The provided values for intake and excretion are physiologically plausible for a hospitalized patient. The problem is scientifically valid.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data for the calculation are provided. Nitrogen intake can be calculated from protein intake and the given mass percentage. Total nitrogen output is the sum of urinary and miscellaneous losses. The problem is structured to yield a unique numerical answer and a standard physiological interpretation.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms. It asks for a calculation based on established definitions and an interpretation grounded in fundamental physiology (anabolism vs. catabolism). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. I will proceed with the calculation and interpretation.\n\n### Solution\nThe nitrogen balance, denoted as $N_{bal}$, is a measure of the net change in the body's total protein mass. It is calculated as the difference between the total nitrogen intake ($N_{in}$) and the total nitrogen output ($N_{out}$). The governing equation is:\n$$N_{bal} = N_{in} - N_{out}$$\n\nA positive nitrogen balance ($N_{bal} > 0$) indicates that nitrogen intake exceeds output. This is associated with a net synthesis of protein and tissue growth, a state known as anabolism. A negative nitrogen balance ($N_{bal} < 0$) indicates that nitrogen output exceeds intake. This is associated with a net breakdown of body protein, a state known as catabolism. A zero balance ($N_{bal} = 0$) indicates nitrogen equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nitrogen intake, $N_{in}$. The patient consumes $80$ grams of protein per day, and protein is assumed to be $16\\%$ nitrogen by mass.\n$$N_{in} = (\\text{Protein Intake}) \\times (\\text{Nitrogen Content Fraction})$$\n$$N_{in} = 80 \\text{ g protein/day} \\times \\frac{16 \\text{ g N}}{100 \\text{ g protein}}$$\n$$N_{in} = 80 \\times 0.16 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n$$N_{in} = 12.8 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total nitrogen output, $N_{out}$. This is the sum of the measured urinary nitrogen excretion and the estimated miscellaneous nitrogen losses.\n$$N_{out} = (\\text{Urinary N Excretion}) + (\\text{Miscellaneous N Losses})$$\n$$N_{out} = 12 \\text{ g N/day} + 4 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n$$N_{out} = 16 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the nitrogen balance, $N_{bal}$.\n$$N_{bal} = N_{in} - N_{out}$$\n$$N_{bal} = 12.8 \\text{ g N/day} - 16 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n$$N_{bal} = -3.2 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N_{bal} = -3.20 \\text{ g N/day}$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result:**\nThe calculated nitrogen balance is $-3.20$ grams of nitrogen per day. Since the value is negative ($N_{bal} < 0$), the patient's nitrogen output is greater than their nitrogen intake. This indicates that the body is in a **catabolic state**. In this state, there is a net breakdown of endogenous proteins, such as those from skeletal muscle, to meet metabolic demands. This leads to a loss of lean body mass, which aligns with the clinical concern mentioned in the problem statement. The patient is not consuming sufficient protein (or total energy, which is not specified but implied as a potential cause) to meet their metabolic needs, resulting in the degradation of their own body tissues. This is a common finding in hospitalized, acutely ill, or undernourished patients.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem states that the Glycemic Load ($GL$) increases linearly with both the Glycemic Index ($GI$) and the grams of available carbohydrate ($C$). This relationship can be expressed with a constant of proportionality, $k$, as:\n$$GL = k \\cdot GI \\cdot C$$\n\nTo determine the constant $k$, we must use the standard calibration for the $GI$ and $GL$ scales, as indicated by the problem. The $GI$ scale is calibrated against a reference food, pure glucose, which is assigned a $GI$ of $100$.\n$$GI_{\\text{glucose}} = 100$$\n\nThe Glycemic Load is designed such that one unit of $GL$ corresponds to the glycemic impact of consuming one gram of glucose. Therefore, the $GL$ of consuming $C$ grams of pure glucose is, by definition, numerically equal to $C$.\n$$GL_{\\text{glucose}} = C$$\n\nWe can now substitute the values for glucose into our proportionality equation. For an amount $C$ of glucose, we have $GL = C$ and $GI = 100$.\n$$C = k \\cdot (100) \\cdot C$$\n\nAssuming a non-zero amount of carbohydrate ($C \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides of the equation by $C$:\n$$1 = k \\cdot 100$$\nSolving for the constant of proportionality $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{100}$$\n\nSubstituting this constant back into the general equation gives the derived expression for Glycemic Load:\n$$GL = \\frac{GI \\cdot C}{100}$$\n\nWith this derived formula, we can now compute the $GL$ for Meal A and Meal B.\n\nFor Meal A:\nThe givens are $GI_A = 60$ and $C_A = 50$ g.\n$$GL_A = \\frac{GI_A \\cdot C_A}{100} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 50}{100}$$\n$$GL_A = \\frac{3000}{100} = 30$$\nThe Glycemic Load for Meal A is $30$.\n\nFor Meal B:\nThe givens are $GI_B = 90$ and $C_B = 30$ g.\n$$GL_B = \\frac{GI_B \\cdot C_B}{100} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 30}{100}$$\n$$GL_B = \\frac{2700}{100} = 27$$\nThe Glycemic Load for Meal B is $27$.\n\nThe final answer requires both values, $GL_A$ and $GL_B$, presented as a single row matrix.",
