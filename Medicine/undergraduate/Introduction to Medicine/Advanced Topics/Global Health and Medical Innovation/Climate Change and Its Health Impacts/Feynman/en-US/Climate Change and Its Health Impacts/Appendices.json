For individuals not taking diuretics, the baseline probability of experiencing clinically significant heat illness during this period is $0.05$. Among those using loop diuretics, the comparative likelihood of heat illness is higher due to fluid loss and impaired thermoregulation, consistent with the epidemiological construct of relative risk (RR), where $RR$ compares the probability of an event in an exposed group with that in an unexposed group. Absolute risk increase is the difference in event probabilities between exposed and unexposed groups.\n\nAssuming that diuretic use confers $RR=1.4$ for heat illness during the heat wave, use the foundational definitions of risk and relative risk to derive the absolute risk increase attributable to diuretic exposure for this time window.

            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Cohort**: Older adults.\n- **Event**: A 3-day urban heat wave.\n- **Baseline Probability (Unexposed)**: The probability of clinically significant heat illness for individuals not taking diuretics is $0.05$.\n- **Relative Risk (Exposed)**: For individuals using loop diuretics, the relative risk ($RR$) of heat illness is $1.4$.\n- **Definition of Relative Risk ($RR$)**: The ratio of the probability of an event in an exposed group to the probability of the event in an unexposed group.\n- **Definition of Absolute Risk Increase (ARI)**: The difference in event probabilities between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n- **Task 1**: Derive the absolute risk increase (ARI).\n- **Task 2**: Briefly outline evidence-based mitigation approaches (deprescribing or enhanced monitoring).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically sound. It employs standard epidemiological definitions for relative risk and absolute risk increase. The clinical context is realistic: loop diuretics are known to increase the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which in turn elevates the risk of heat-related illness, especially in vulnerable populations like older adults. The given numerical values, a baseline risk of $5\\%$ and a relative risk of $1.4$, are plausible in this context.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear definitions and all necessary numerical data to calculate a unique solution for the absolute risk increase. The relationship between the given quantities ($RR$, baseline risk) and the desired quantity (ARI) is unambiguous.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $P_u$ denote the probability of heat illness in the unexposed group (individuals not taking diuretics). Let $P_e$ denote the probability of heat illness in the exposed group (individuals using diuretics).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The baseline probability for the unexposed group: $P_u = 0.05$.\n- The relative risk: $RR = 1.4$.\n\nThe definition of relative risk is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{P_e}{P_u}$$\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the probability of illness in the exposed group, $P_e$. Rearranging the formula:\n$$P_e = RR \\times P_u$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_e = 1.4 \\times 0.05$$\nTo compute this, we can express the decimals as fractions:\n$$P_e = \\frac{14}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{70}{1000} = 0.07$$\nSo, the probability of experiencing heat illness for an individual on diuretics is $0.07$ during the specified period.\n\nNext, we are asked to find the absolute risk increase (ARI). The problem defines ARI as the difference in event probabilities between the exposed and unexposed groups:\n$$ARI = P_e - P_u$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $P_e$ and the given value for $P_u$:\n$$ARI = 0.07 - 0.05$$\n$$ARI = 0.02$$\n\nThe absolute risk increase attributable to diuretic exposure is $0.02$. This means that for every $100$ older adults taking diuretics, an additional $2$ individuals are expected to experience heat illness during the heat wave compared to $100$ older adults not taking diuretics.\n\n**Discussion of Mitigation Strategies**\n\nAs requested, a brief outline of evidence-based approaches to mitigate this excess risk is provided below. These strategies are grounded in medication safety and clinical pharmacology principles.\n\n1.  **Deprescribing or Dose Adjustment**: This is a proactive medication management strategy involving the supervised reduction or temporary cessation of a medication when the potential for harm outweighs the potential for benefit.\n    - **Temporary Discontinuation**: For a short, predictable period like a heat wave, a clinician might recommend that stable patients temporarily suspend their diuretic. This decision requires a careful risk-benefit analysis, considering the indication for the diuretic (e.g., hypertension vs. severe heart failure). Discontinuing a diuretic in a patient with decompensated heart failure could precipitate fluid overload, a risk that may be greater than the heat-related risk.\n    - **Dose Reduction**: A less aggressive alternative is to reduce the diuretic dose for the duration of the extreme heat, which can lessen the diuretic effect and associated fluid loss.\n    - **Clinical Supervision**: Any form of deprescribing must be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, with a clear plan for when and how to resume the medication.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Monitoring and Patient Education**: If the decision is made to continue the diuretic, heightened vigilance is required.\n    - **Clinical Monitoring**: This includes more frequent monitoring of clinical parameters that can indicate dehydration or adverse effects. Key parameters include daily weight checks (a rapid decrease suggests fluid loss), orthostatic blood pressure measurements (to detect hypovolemia), and assessment for symptoms like dizziness or confusion.\n    - **Biochemical Monitoring**: Monitoring serum electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) and renal function (e.g., creatinine) is crucial, as diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and acute kidney injury, all of which are exacerbated by heat stress.\n    - **Patient Education**: Patients and their caregivers must be educated on specific strategies to mitigate risk, such as maintaining adequate fluid intake (while respecting any fluid restrictions for conditions like heart failure), recognizing the early signs of dehydration and heat illness, and knowing when to seek medical attention.\n\nThese approaches exemplify the principles of personalized medicine, adapting therapeutic plans to changing environmental conditions and individual patient vulnerability.",

The provided data (population size, baseline incidence, relative risk, efficacy) are realistic. The definitions for epidemiological terms are standard. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. The idealizations of a \"closed population\" and \"full coverage\" are acceptable simplifications for a quantitative problem of this nature, designed to test the application of core principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the total number of diarrheal disease cases prevented by the chlorination intervention during the one-month post-flood period. We will proceed by first calculating the number of cases that would have occurred without the intervention, and then applying the intervention's efficacy to determine the number of cases prevented.\n\nLet $N$ be the population size, where $N=64{,}000$.\nLet $I_{0}$ be the baseline incidence rate of diarrheal disease before the flood.\n$I_{0} = 10 \\text{ cases per } 1{,}000 \\text{ persons per month}$.\nWe convert this to a per-person rate:\n$$I_{0} = \\frac{10}{1{,}000} \\text{ cases per person per month} = 0.01 \\text{ month}^{-1}$$\n\nLet $\\mathrm{RR}$ be the Relative Risk associated with the flood exposure, given as $\\mathrm{RR}=1.5$. The Relative Risk is the ratio of the incidence in the exposed population (post-flood) to the incidence in the unexposed population (baseline). Let $I_{flood}$ be the incidence rate in the post-flood scenario without any intervention.\n$$\\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{I_{flood}}{I_{0}}$$\nFrom this definition, we can calculate the post-flood incidence rate:\n$$I_{flood} = \\mathrm{RR} \\times I_{0} = 1.5 \\times 0.01 \\text{ month}^{-1} = 0.015 \\text{ month}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we determine the number of cases that would have occurred in the population of $N=64{,}000$ over the $1$-month period had the intervention not been deployed. This counterfactual number of cases, which we denote as $C_{flood}$, is the product of the post-flood incidence rate and the population size.\n$$C_{flood} = I_{flood} \\times N$$\n$$C_{flood} = 0.015 \\times 64{,}000 = 960 \\text{ cases}$$\nThis is the number of cases that would have been expected in the absence of the chlorination intervention.\n\nThe problem states that the intervention efficacy, $E=0.50$, is the \"proportionate reduction in disease occurrence among those who would otherwise develop disease\". This directly means that the number of cases prevented, $C_{prevented}$, is the efficacy multiplied by the number of cases that would have occurred otherwise ($C_{flood}$).\n$$C_{prevented} = E \\times C_{flood}$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$E = 0.50$$\n$$C_{flood} = 960$$\n$$C_{prevented} = 0.50 \\times 960 = 480 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures. The calculated number of prevented cases is exactly $480$. This value can be written in scientific notation as $4.80 \\times 10^2$, which confirms it has three significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe number of diarrheal disease cases prevented by the chlorination intervention is $480$.",

            "problem": "A widely used approach for mosquito-borne infections in public health epidemiology is to construct the basic reproduction number, defined as the average number of new human infections caused by a single infectious human introduced into a fully susceptible population. Consider a mosquito-borne pathogen in a homogeneous setting where mosquitoes bite humans at a constant rate and survival is memoryless. Assume the following entomological and clinical parameters: mosquito density per human $m$, mosquito biting rate $a$ (per mosquito per day), probability of transmission from an infectious mosquito to a susceptible human per bite $b$, probability of transmission from an infectious human to a susceptible mosquito per bite $c$, human recovery rate $r$ (per day), mosquito per-capita mortality rate $\\mu(T)$ (per day), and the extrinsic incubation period (time for the pathogen to develop to transmissibility inside the mosquito) $\\tau(T)$ (days). Assume independence of events and that the survival probability of a mosquito through the extrinsic incubation period is $\\exp(-\\mu(T)\\tau(T))$, that infectious humans remain infectious on average for $1/r$, and that infectious mosquitoes remain infectious until death, with mean duration $1/\\mu(T)$. Using the next-generation perspective with two infectious compartments (human and mosquito), derive from first principles an expression for the temperature-dependent basic reproduction number $R_0(T)$ in terms of $m$, $a$, $b$, $c$, $r$, $\\mu(T)$, and $\\tau(T)$.\n\nTo connect this expression to climate, consider a latitudinal temperature gradient where the daily mean temperature at absolute latitude $|\\phi|$ (in degrees) is modeled as $T(|\\phi|) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}} - k|\\phi|$, with baseline equatorial temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and gradient $k = 0.3\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ per degree of latitude.

(It's the boundary where $R_0 \\ge 1$ ceases to hold).\n    *   So, I need to solve the equation $R_0(T) = 1$ for $T$, and then solve for $|\\phi_*|$.\n    *   $R_0(T) = 1 \\implies 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.03T) = 1$.\n    *   $\\exp(-2.4 + 0.03T) = 1/4.5$.\n    *   $-2.4 + 0.03T = \\ln(1/4.5) = -\\ln(4.5)$.\n    *   $0.03T = 2.4 - \\ln(4.5)$.\n    *   $T = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n    *   This is the critical temperature $T_{\\text{crit}}$ below which transmission is not sustained ($R_0  1$).\n    *   Let's calculate this value. $\\ln(4.5) \\approx \\ln(e^{1.5}) \\approx 1.5$. A more precise value: $\\ln(4.5) \\approx 1.504077$.\n    *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2.4 - 1.504077}{0.03} = \\frac{0.895923}{0.03} \\approx 29.8641^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n    *   Wait, this seems high. Let me recheck my calculation.\n    *   $K = 4.5$. This is correct.\n    *   $R_0(T) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.03T)$. This is correct.\n    *   $T = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$. This is correct.\n    *   $\\ln(4.5) \\approx 1.504$.\n    *   $2.4 - 1.504 = 0.896$.\n    *   $0.896 / 0.03 = 89.6 / 3 \\approx 29.87$.\n    *   Okay, the calculation seems right. What does this mean? It means transmission is only possible if the mean daily temperature is *above* $29.86^\\circ$C. This seems very high. Let's re-read the problem parameters to see if I missed something.\n    *   $m=2, a=0.3, b=0.5, c=0.5, r=0.1$.\n    *   $\\mu=0.1, \\tau_0=24, \\delta=0.3$.\n    *   Let's check the units.\n        *   $m$: dimensionless (mosquito/human)\n        *   $a$: day$^{-1}$\n        *   $b$: dimensionless (prob)\n        *   $c$: dimensionless (prob)\n        *   $r$: day$^{-1}$\n        *   $\\mu$: day$^{-1}$\n        *   $\\tau_0$: days\n        *   $\\delta$: days/$^\\circ$C\n        *   $T$: $^\\circ$C\n    *   The exponent must be dimensionless: $\\mu \\tau = (\\text{day}^{-1})(\\text{days})$, good.\n    *   The pre-factor $K$ must be dimensionless: $\\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu} = \\frac{(\\text{dimless})(\\text{day}^{-2})(\\text{dimless})(\\text{dimless})}{(\\text{day}^{-1})(\\text{day}^{-1})} = \\text{dimless}$. Good.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the $\\tau(T)$ function: $\\tau(T) = 24 - 0.3T$.\n        *   At $T=28^\\circ$C (equator baseline), $\\tau(28) = 24 - 0.3 \\times 28 = 24 - 8.4 = 15.6$ days.\n        *   At $T=30^\\circ$C (equator warmed), $\\tau(30) = 24 - 0.3 \\times 30 = 24 - 9 = 15$ days.\n        *   At $T=25^\\circ$C, $\\tau(25) = 24 - 0.3 \\times 25 = 24 - 7.5 = 16.5$ days.\n        *   This linear model implies that lower temperatures give longer EIPs, which is correct biologically (up to a point).\n    *   Let's calculate $R_0$ at the equator ($T=28^\\circ$C) for the baseline case.\n        *   $R_0(28) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.03 \\times 28) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.84) = 4.5 \\exp(-1.56)$.\n        *   $e^{-1.56} \\approx 0.21$.\n        *   $R_0(28) \\approx 4.5 \\times 0.21 = 0.945$.\n    *   This is interesting. In the baseline scenario, $R_0  1$ even at the equator. This means $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 0$ according to the problem definition: \"If no latitude satisfies $R_0 \\geq 1$, take $|\\phi_*| = 0$.\"\n    *   Let me be absolutely certain. $T(|\\phi|) = 28 - 0.3|\\phi|$. The maximum temperature occurs at $|\\phi|=0$, which is $T=28^\\circ$C. At this temperature, $R_0(28) \\approx 0.945  1$. As we increase $|\\phi|$, temperature decreases. When $T$ decreases, the exponent $-2.4 + 0.03T$ becomes more negative, so $\\exp(...)$ decreases, and $R_0(T)$ decreases. Therefore, if $R_0  1$ at the equator, it is less than $1$ everywhere.\n    *   So, for the baseline case, $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 0$. This seems to be a key part of the problem.\n\n5.  **Solution - Part 4: Find $|\\phi_*|$ for the warmed scenario**\n    *   Temperature model: $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi|) = 30 - 0.3|\\phi|$.\n    *   The maximum temperature is at the equator, $|\\phi|=0$, which is $T=30^\\circ$C.\n    *   Let's calculate $R_0$ at the warmed equator.\n        *   $R_0(30) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.03 \\times 30) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.9) = 4.5 \\exp(-1.5)$.\n        *   $e^{-1.5} \\approx 0.223$.\n        *   $R_0(30) \\approx 4.5 \\times 0.223 = 1.004$.\n    *   Since $R_0(30)  1$, sustained transmission is now possible at the equator and potentially at other latitudes.\n    *   To find the maximum latitude $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}$, we set $R_0(T(|\\phi_*|)) = 1$.\n    *   We already found the critical temperature $T_{\\text{crit}}$ for this condition: $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n    *   Now we set the warmed temperature profile equal to this critical temperature.\n    *   $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}) = T_{\\text{crit}}$.\n    *   $30 - 0.3|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n    *   $0.3|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 30 - \\left( \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03} \\right)$.\n    *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{1}{0.3} \\left[ 30 - \\left( \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03} \\right) \\right]$.\n    *   Let's simplify this algebraically first.\n    *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{30}{0.3} - \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03 \\times 0.3} = 100 - \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.009}$.\n    *   Let's plug in the numbers. $\\ln(4.5) \\approx 1.504077$.\n    *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2.4 - 1.504077}{0.03} = \\frac{0.895923}{0.03} \\approx 29.8641$.\n    *   Now solve for $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}$:\n    *   $30 - 0.3|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 29.8641$.\n    *   $0.3|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 30 - 29.8641 = 0.1359$.\n    *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{0.1359}{0.3} = 0.453$.\n    *   The latitude is in degrees. So $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} \\approx 0.453^{\\circ}$. This is a very narrow band.\n\n6.  **Solution - Part 5: Calculate the change $\\Delta|\\phi_*|$**\n    *   $\\Delta|\\phi_*| = |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} - |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$.\n    *   We found $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 0$.\n    *   We found $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} \\approx 0.453^{\\circ}$.\n    *   So, $\\Delta|\\phi_*| = 0.453 - 0 = 0.453^{\\circ}$.\n    *   The problem asks to round the final answer to 3 significant figures.\n    *   The result is $0.453$. This already has 3 significant figures.\n\n7.  **Final Review of the Logic and Calculations:**\n    *   **Derivation of R0**: $R_0 = (\\text{new mosquito infections / human}) \\times (\\text{new human infections / mosquito})$.\n        *   New mosquito infections / human = (bites/day on human) * (prob_trans_h_m) * (duration_inf_human) * (prob_survive_eip).\n            *   Bites/day on human = $m \\times a$.\n            *   Prob trans h-m = $c$.\n            *   Duration infectious human = $1/r$.\n            *   Prob survive EIP = $\\exp(-\\mu \\tau)$.\n            *   Combination: $\\frac{mac}{r} \\exp(-\\mu \\tau)$. This looks correct.\n        *   New human infections / mosquito = (bites/day by mosquito) * (prob_trans_m_h) * (duration_inf_mosquito).\n            *   Bites/day by mosquito = $a$.\n            *   Prob trans m-h = $b$.\n            *   Duration infectious mosquito = $1/\\mu$.\n            *   Combination: $\\frac{ab}{\\mu}$.

The derivation is solid.\n    *   **Parameter Substitution**:\n        *   $K = \\frac{2 \\times 0.3^2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5}{0.1 \\times 0.1} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.09 \\times 0.25}{0.01} = \\frac{0.045}{0.01} = 4.5$.

This is less than 1.\n        *   Since $R_0(T)$ is an increasing function of $T$, and the max temperature is $28^\\circ$C, $R_01$ everywhere.\n        *   Conclusion $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 0$ is correct.\n    *   **Warmed Case Check**:\n        *   $T_{\\text{max}} = T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(0) = 30^\\circ$C.\n        *   $R_0(30) = 4.5 \\exp(-2.4 + 0.03 \\times 30) = 4.5 \\exp(-1.5)$.\n        *   $\\ln(R_0(30)) = \\ln(4.5) - 1.5 \\approx 1.504 - 1.5 = 0.004$.\n        *   $R_0(30) = \\exp(0.004) \\approx 1.004$. This is greater than 1.\n        *   Conclusion: sustained transmission is possible.\n    *   **Calculation of $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}$**:\n        *   We need to find $|\\phi|$ such that $R_0(T(|\\phi|)) = 1$.\n        *   This means $\\ln(R_0) = 0$.\n        *   $\\ln(4.5) + (-2.4 + 0.03 T) = 0$.\n        *   $0.03 T = 2.4 - \\ln(4.5)$.\n        *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n        *   This critical temperature must equal the temperature at the max latitude: $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}})$.\n        *   $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}) = 30 - 0.3 |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}$.\n        *   $30 - 0.3 |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n        *   $0.3 |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 30 - \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.03}$.\n        *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{30}{0.3} - \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.3 \\times 0.03} = 100 - \\frac{2.4 - \\ln(4.5)}{0.009}$.\n        *   Let's do the calculation from here more accurately.\n        *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 100 - \\frac{2.4 - 1.50407739}{0.009} = 100 - \\frac{0.89592261}{0.009}$.\n        *   $100 - 99.54695... = 0.45304...$\n        *   Let me try the other way, it seemed less prone to precision errors.\n        *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{0.89592261}{0.03} = 29.864087...$\n        *   $0.3 |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = 30 - 29.864087... = 0.135912...$\n        *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{0.135912...}{0.3} = 0.45304...$\n        *   Both calculation methods give the same result.

State the givens verbatim. Declare the problem valid because it's a standard epidemiological model, well-posed, and objective.\n    *   Begin the solution part.\n    *   First, derive the expression for $R_0(T)$. I'll explain the next-generation logic clearly, defining the two components: mosquitoes infected by a human, and humans infected by a mosquito. I will show the derivation symbolically.\n    *   $R_0(T) = \\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu(T)} \\exp(-\\mu(T)\\tau(T))$.\n    *   Second, substitute the given functional forms and parameters.\n        *   $\\mu(T)=\\mu$\n        *   $\\tau(T) = \\tau_0 - \\delta T$\n        *   $R_0(T) = \\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu} \\exp(-\\mu(\\tau_0 - \\delta T))$.\n    *   Third, analyze the baseline scenario.\n        *   State the temperature model $T(|\\phi|) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}} - k|\\phi|$.\n        *   Calculate the constant pre-factor $K = \\frac{m a^2 b c}{r \\mu}$ with the given values. $K = 4.5$.\n        *   Write the specific $R_0(T)$ function: $R_0(T) = 4.5 \\exp(-0.1(24 - 0.3T))$.\n        *   Evaluate $R_0$ at the maximum possible temperature for the baseline case, which is $T(0) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 28^\\circ$C.\n        *   Show that $R_0(28)  1$.\n        *   Explain that since $R_0(T)$ is an increasing function of temperature, and the maximum temperature yields $R_0  1$, then $R_0  1$ for all latitudes.\n        *   Conclude that $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 0$.\n    *   Fourth, analyze the warmed scenario.\n        *   State the new temperature model $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi|) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\Delta T - k|\\phi|$.\n        *   Define the condition for the maximum latitude for sustained transmission, $R_0(T(|\\phi_*|)) = 1$.\n        *   Solve $R_0(T) = 1$ for the critical temperature, $T_{\\text{crit}}$. I'll do this symbolically first.\n            *   $K \\exp(-\\mu(\\tau_0 - \\delta T_{\\text{crit}})) = 1$\n            *   $\\exp(-\\mu\\tau_0 + \\mu\\delta T_{\\text{crit}}) = 1/K$\n            *   $-\\mu\\tau_0 + \\mu\\delta T_{\\text{crit}} = -\\ln(K)$\n            *   $\\mu\\delta T_{\\text{crit}} = \\mu\\tau_0 - \\ln(K)$\n            *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu\\tau_0 - \\ln(K)}{\\mu\\delta} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\delta} - \\frac{\\ln(K)}{\\mu\\delta}$. This is another good way to write it. Let's check:\n            *   $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{24}{0.3} - \\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{0.1 \\times 0.3} = 80 - \\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{0.03} \\approx 80 - \\frac{1.504}{0.03} = 80 - 50.13... = 29.87$. Yes, this is the same. I'll use the form $T_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu\\tau_0 - \\ln(K)}{\\mu\\delta}$.\n        *   Set $T_{\\mathrm{warm}}(|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}) = T_{\\text{crit}}$.\n        *   $T_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\Delta T - k |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = T_{\\text{crit}}$.\n        *   $k |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = T_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\Delta T - T_{\\text{crit}}$.\n        *   $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\Delta T - T_{\\text{crit}}}{k}$.\n        *   Now substitute the numerical values to calculate $|\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}}$.\n    *   Fifth, calculate the final answer $\\Delta|\\phi_*| = |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{warm}} - |\\phi_*|_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$.\n    *   Finally, round to 3 significant figures. The logic is sound, the steps are clear. I am ready to write the solution.",
