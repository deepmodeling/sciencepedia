It presents a classic clinical scenario of acute kidney injury and provides standard physiological definitions and plausible laboratory values. The task is to derive a standard, widely used clinical formula and apply it to the given data. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. Although the patient is in an acute, non-steady state, the use of creatinine clearance as an approximation for GFR is a standard clinical convention in this context, and the problem explicitly provides this as a working assumption. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the fractional excretion of sodium, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, and calculate its value. The definition of fractional excretion for any solute $x$ is given as the ratio of its renal clearance to the glomerular filtration rate:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{x} = \\frac{C_{x}}{\\mathrm{GFR}}$$\nFor sodium, this becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{\\mathrm{GFR}}$$\nThe problem states that the GFR can be approximated by the creatinine clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{GFR} \\approx C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ yields:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}$$\nThe definition of renal clearance for a solute $x$ is given as $C_{x} = \\dfrac{U_{x} \\cdot V}{P_{x}}$, where $U_x$ is the urine concentration, $P_x$ is the plasma concentration, and $V$ is the urine flow rate. We can write the clearance expressions for both sodium ($Na$) and creatinine ($Cr$):\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx \\frac{\\left( \\dfrac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\dfrac{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}} \\right)}$$\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, is a common term in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out. This is a crucial feature, as it allows for the calculation of $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ without needing a precise, timed urine collection, as long as the urine and plasma samples are collected concurrently.\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form for the derived expression:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\cdot U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}$$\nNow, we compute the value using the provided laboratory data:\n$P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 140\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n$U_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n$U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 90\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{(15\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\cdot (1.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL})}{(140\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\cdot (90\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL})}$$\nThe units are dimensionally consistent and cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio as expected for a fraction.\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 1.8}{140 \\cdot 90} = \\frac{27}{12600}$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 0.002142857...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx 0.00214$$\nThis value, expressed as a percentage, is $0.214\\%$. In the context of acute kidney injury, a fractional excretion of sodium less than $1\\%$ (i.e., a decimal value $<0.01$) is highly indicative of a prerenal etiology, where the kidneys are structurally intact and are appropriately conserving sodium in response to perceived volume depletion. A value greater than $2\\%$ (i.e., $>0.02$) suggests an intrinsic renal cause, such as acute tubular necrosis, where damaged tubules are unable to reabsorb sodium.\n\nBased on the computed value, the patient's acute kidney injury is more consistent with a prerenal mechanism because the fractional excretion of sodium is less than one percent, indicating avid renal sodium reabsorption in response to perceived volume depletion.",

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient: $64$-year-old man\n- Clinical Context: Postoperative day $0$ after open sigmoid colectomy under general anesthesia.\n- Administered substances: Intravenous morphine, approximately $2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ of $0.9\\%$ sodium chloride solution over the past $4$ hours.\n- Clinical signs: Somnolent but arousable, respiratory rate of $8 \\ \\mathrm{breaths/min}$, shallow respirations.\n- Vital Signs: Blood pressure $118/72 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, heart rate $92 \\ \\mathrm{beats/min}$, oxygen saturation $94\\%$ on $2 \\ \\mathrm{L/min}$ nasal cannula.\n- Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): $pH = 7.28$, $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2 = 55 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $HCO_3^- = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n- Basic Metabolic Panel: Serum chloride ($Cl^-$) $= 114 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a classic clinical scenario of postoperative respiratory depression, likely secondary to opioid (morphine) administration. The physiological parameters ($pH$, $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$, $HCO_3^-$) and clinical signs (low respiratory rate, somnolence) are consistent with this diagnosis. The principles of acid-base balance, including the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and compensatory mechanisms, are fundamental concepts in physiology and medicine. The provided lab values are internally consistent. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, $pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}([HCO_3^-] / (0.03 \\times P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2))$, we can verify the values: $pH = 6.1 + \\log_{10}(25 / (0.03 \\times 55)) = 6.1 + \\log_{10}(15.15) \\approx 6.1 + 1.18 = 7.28$. The values are consistent.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data ($pH$, $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$, $HCO_3^-$) to perform a complete acid-base analysis. The question is clear and directs the solver to identify the primary disorder and assess for a mixed disturbance, for which a unique, standard medical interpretation exists.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement consists of objective clinical data and laboratory measurements. There are no subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of an acid-base disorder follows a systematic, multi-step process.\n\n**1. Identify the Primary Disorder**\nFirst, we examine the $pH$ to determine the overall state of acidity or alkalinity. A normal physiological $pH$ is in the range of $7.35$ to $7.45$. The patient's $pH$ is $7.28$, which is below the normal range, indicating an **acidemia**.\n\nNext, we determine if the cause is respiratory or metabolic by examining the $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ (respiratory component) and $HCO_3^-$ (metabolic component).\n- The normal range for $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ is $35-45 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The patient's $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ is $55 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, which is elevated. An elevated $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ (hypercapnia) causes an increase in carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$) and leads to acidosis.\n- The normal range for $HCO_3^-$ is $22-28 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The patient's $HCO_3^-$ is $25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, which is within the normal range.\n\nSince the $pH$ is acidotic and the $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ is elevated (in the direction that explains the acidemia), the primary disorder is a **respiratory acidosis**. The clinical context of morphine administration, somnolence, and a low respiratory rate ($8 \\ \\mathrm{breaths/min}$) strongly supports hypoventilation leading to $CO_2$ retention as the cause.\n\n**2. Assess for Compensation**\nThe body attempts to compensate for a primary acid-base disturbance. For a respiratory acidosis, compensation involves the kidneys retaining bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) to buffer the excess acid. This compensation takes time.\n- **Acute respiratory acidosis** (developing over minutes to hours): Compensation is minimal and occurs via cellular buffering. The kidneys have not had time to respond.\n- **Chronic respiratory acidosis** (developing over days to weeks): The kidneys have had time to compensate, resulting in a significantly elevated serum $HCO_3^-$.\n\nThe patient is on postoperative day $0$, meaning the condition is acute. Therefore, we expect to see the pattern of an **acute respiratory acidosis**.\n\n**3. Quantify the Expected Compensation**\nWe can use a standard rule of thumb to determine if the degree of compensation is appropriate for the primary disorder, or if a second (mixed) disorder is present.\n- For **acute respiratory acidosis**, the $HCO_3^-$ is expected to increase by approximately $1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ for every $10 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ increase in $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ above the normal value of $40 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nLet's calculate the expected $HCO_3^-$ for this patient:\n- Increase in $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$: $\\Delta P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2 = 55 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 40 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- Expected increase in $HCO_3^-$: $\\Delta HCO_3^- = \\left( \\frac{15 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}} \\right) \\times 1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n- Expected total $HCO_3^-$: Starting from a normal baseline of $\\sim 24 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, the expected $HCO_3^-$ is $24 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} + 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 25.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\nThe patient's measured $HCO_3^-$ is $25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. This value is extremely close to the predicted value of $25.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ for an uncomplicated acute respiratory acidosis. The small difference is well within the acceptable range of biological and measurement variability. This indicates appropriate acute buffering and no evidence of a concurrent metabolic disorder.\n\n**4. Consider the Effect of Chloride**\nThe patient received $2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ of $0.9\\%$ sodium chloride and has a serum chloride of $114 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ (reference range typically $98-106 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). This constitutes a mild hyperchloremia. Administration of large volumes of normal saline can cause a hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA). If a NAGMA were present, it would consume bicarbonate, leading to a measured $HCO_3^-$ that is *lower* than the expected compensatory value. As calculated above, the measured $HCO_3^-$ ($25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$) is not lower than expected; in fact, it matches the expected value for a pure acute respiratory acidosis. Therefore, there is no evidence of a clinically significant concurrent metabolic acidosis.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Primary acute respiratory acidosis with appropriate acute buffering compensation; no mixed disorder**\n- The primary disorder is correctly identified as respiratory acidosis. The clinical context and lack of significant bicarbonate elevation confirm it is acute.\n- The compensation is assessed as appropriate, which our calculation confirms (measured $HCO_3^-$ of $25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ vs. expected $25.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$).\n- The conclusion is that no mixed disorder is present. This is consistent with the data.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Primary chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate renal compensation; no mixed disorder**\n- This is incorrect. The clinical scenario is acute (postoperative day $0$).\n- Furthermore, the compensation is not chronic. For a chronic respiratory acidosis with a $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ of $55 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, the expected $HCO_3^-$ would be approximately $24 + 1.5 \\times (3.5 \\text{ to } 4) \\approx 29-30 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The measured value of $25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ is far from this.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Primary acute respiratory acidosis with concurrent non-anion gap metabolic acidosis from hyperchloremia**\n- This correctly identifies the primary disorder. It proposes a concurrent NAGMA, which is plausible given the saline infusion and hyperchloremia.\n- However, the numeric data does not support a mixed disorder. A concurrent metabolic acidosis would result in a bicarbonate level *lower* than that predicted by compensation rules. The measured $HCO_3^-$ of $25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ matches the expected compensation almost perfectly, arguing against a significant second process.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Primary hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with secondary respiratory compensation**\n- This is incorrect. If the primary disorder were a metabolic acidosis, the compensatory response would be an increase in ventilation (hyperventilation) to decrease the $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$.\n- This patient has a low respiratory rate ($8 \\ \\mathrm{breaths/min}$) and an elevated $P_{\\text{a}}\\text{CO}_2$ ($55 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$), which is hypoventilation, the opposite of the expected compensation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis**\n- This is incorrect. An alkalosis is a condition where $pH > 7.45$. The patient has acidemia ($pH = 7.28$). This option describes the opposite condition.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",

A total cumulative dose of up to $10 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ is often required.\n\n3.  **Correct Life-Threatening Hyperkalemia:** The patient's potassium is $6.8 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ with ECG changes (wide-complex tachycardia), indicating cardiac membrane instability. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.\n    *   **Cardiac Membrane Stabilization:** Administer calcium to antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia. Calcium chloride $1 \\,\\mathrm{g}$ ($10$-$20 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$) IV is preferred in a cardiac emergency due to its higher bioavailability of ionized calcium compared to calcium gluconate.\n    *   **Intracellular Potassium Shift:** Administer agents to drive extracellular potassium into cells. The standard combination is:\n        *   Regular insulin, $10 \\,\\mathrm{units}$ IV.\n        *   Dextrose $25$-$50 \\,\\mathrm{g}$ IV (e.g., $50$-$100 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $D_{50}W$) to prevent hypoglycemia from the insulin administration.\n        *   Sodium bicarbonate $1$-$2 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/kg}$ IV (a $50 \\,\\mathrm{mEq}$ bolus is standard). This also helps correct the severe metabolic acidosis.\n        *   A beta-$2$ agonist, such as nebulized albuterol $10$-$20 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$, can be considered as an adjunct.\n\n4.  **Correct Acidosis:** The patient has a severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis ($pH = 7.12$, $p_{\\mathrm{CO}_2} = 75 \\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, base deficit = $-10 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$).\n    *   **Respiratory Acidosis:** Hyperventilate the patient with $100\\%$ oxygen to lower the $p_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$.\n    *   **Metabolic Acidosis:** Administer sodium bicarbonate as described above.\n\n5.  **Manage Hyperthermia:** The core temperature is $39.8^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and rising. Active cooling is mandatory.\n    *   **Methods:** Use surface cooling (ice packs on axillae, groin, neck, and torso) and internal cooling (infusion of chilled IV saline or lactated Ringer's, typically $10$-$15 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ boluses; gastric, bladder, or rectal lavage with cold water).\n    *   **Endpoint:** Active cooling measures should be discontinued when the core temperature reaches approximately $38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $38.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to prevent overshooting and causing iatrogenic hypothermia.\n\n6.  **Treat Dysrhythmias:** Treat arrhythmias according to standard ACLS guidelines. If an antiarrhythmic is needed for ventricular tachycardia, amiodarone or lidocaine are standard choices. **Crucially, calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) are contraindicated**, as their co-administration with dantrolene can lead to life-threatening hyperkalemia and myocardial depression.\n\n7.  **Post-Crisis Management:** Transfer to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for continued monitoring (for at least $24$ hours), dantrolene infusion (1 $\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ every $4$-$6$ hours or a continuous infusion), and management of complications like rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and DIC.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Immediately discontinue triggering agents and hyperventilate with $100\\%$ oxygen; administer dantrolene sodium as an initial intravenous bolus of $2.5 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ and repeat at intervals until signs abate (for a $70 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, $175 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ per bolus), titrating up to a cumulative dose of approximately $10 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ as needed; treat hyperkalemia with regular insulin $10 \\,\\mathrm{units}$ intravenous plus dextrose $25 \\,\\mathrm{g}$, calcium chloride $1 \\,\\mathrm{g}$ intravenous, sodium bicarbonate $50 \\,\\mathrm{mEq}$ intravenous, and consider nebulized albuterol $10$–$20 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$; avoid calcium channel blockers; initiate active cooling with ice packs to axillae and groin, chilled normal saline $10$–$15 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ intravenous, and cold gastric or rectal lavage, and stop active cooling when core temperature is $\\leq 38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; treat dysrhythmias with amiodarone if needed and prepare for intensive care unit (intensive care unit, ICU) transfer.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies all necessary immediate steps. It specifies discontinuing triggers, hyperventilating with $100\\%$ oxygen, the correct initial and repeated dantrolene dose ($2.5 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ or $175 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ for this patient), a complete and appropriate bundle for life-threatening hyperkalemia (insulin, dextrose, calcium chloride, bicarbonate), the critical contraindication of calcium channel blockers, standard active cooling methods, the correct temperature endpoint for stopping cooling ($\\leq 38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), and appropriate arrhythmia/disposition planning. This protocol is comprehensive and fully aligns with established MHAUS guidelines.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Maintain anesthesia and administer dantrolene sodium as an initial intravenous bolus of $5 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; treat hyperkalemia with regular insulin $10 \\,\\mathrm{units}$ intravenous without dextrose and calcium gluconate $1 \\,\\mathrm{g}$ intravenous; correct acidosis later; use antipyretics and ice-water immersion for cooling; give verapamil if arrhythmias persist and stop cooling when core temperature reaches $40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option contains multiple fatal errors. \n    1. \"Maintain anesthesia\" is incorrect; triggers must be stopped. \n    2. Insulin without dextrose is extremely dangerous and will cause iatrogenic hypoglycemia. \n    3. Deferring acidosis correction is incorrect. \n    4. \"Stop cooling when core temperature reaches $40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\" is nonsensical, as the current temperature is already $39.8^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and cooling is needed. The target is $\\sim 38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n    5. Giving verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) is absolutely contraindicated.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Replace dantrolene with the single-vial formulation at $1 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ despite only standard vials being available; defer calcium and use sodium polystyrene sulfonate for hyperkalemia with furosemide; infuse chilled lactated Ringer’s solution $30 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ and rewarm after sedation; rely on lidocaine for arrhythmia control and accept ongoing hypercarbia until muscle rigidity resolves.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is profoundly incorrect. \n    1. One cannot use a drug formulation that is unavailable. The dantrolene dose of $1 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ is also wrong.\n    2. Deferring calcium with K$^{+}$ of $6.8 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ and a wide-complex tachycardia is a life-threatening error. \n    3. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a slow-acting resin for non-emergent hyperkalemia and has no role here.\n    4. \"Rewarm after sedation\" is the opposite of the needed intervention. \n    5. \"Accept ongoing hypercarbia\" is incorrect; it must be treated with hyperventilation.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Stop triggers and give standard dantrolene sodium $2.5 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ once, then switch to calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) for arrhythmia suppression; for hyperkalemia, provide sodium bicarbonate $5 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/kg}$ without insulin or dextrose and prefer calcium gluconate $1 \\,\\mathrm{g}$; for cooling, run cold normal saline $30 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ and continue until core temperature is $36^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option contains multiple critical errors. \n    1. Dantrolene must be given repeatedly, not just \"once\". \n    2. Administering diltiazem (a calcium channel blocker) is contraindicated.\n    3. A sodium bicarbonate dose of $5 \\,\\mathrm{mEq/kg}$ is excessive ($350 \\,\\mathrm{mEq}$ for this patient) and omitting insulin/dextrose is incorrect management of hyperkalemia.\n    4. Cooling until the core temperature is $36^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is too aggressive and will cause significant and dangerous rebound hypothermia.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
