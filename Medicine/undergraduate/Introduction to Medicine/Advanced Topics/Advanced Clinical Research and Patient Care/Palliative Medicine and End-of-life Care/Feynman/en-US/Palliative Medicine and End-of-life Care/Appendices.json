Clinicians must often switch from one opioid to another—a process known as opioid rotation—to improve pain control or manage intolerable side effects.

            "problem": "A $62$-year-old patient with metastatic cancer is receiving oral oxycodone at a total daily dose of $120$ milligrams per day for chronic pain management. Due to adverse effects and inadequate relief, the team decides to rotate to oral hydromorphone. Use the following widely accepted equianalgesic relationships as the foundational base: oral oxycodone $20$ milligrams is approximately equianalgesic to oral morphine $30$ milligrams, and oral hydromorphone $7.5$ milligrams is approximately equianalgesic to oral morphine $30$ milligrams. In opioid rotation, a reduction for incomplete cross-tolerance is recommended; assume a $30$ percent reduction from the calculated equianalgesic hydromorphone dose to determine a safe new starting dose. Compute the safe new total daily dose of oral hydromorphone in milligrams per day. Round your final answer to two significant figures and express it in milligrams per day. Do not express the answer as a percentage; provide a single numerical value only.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a safe starting daily dose of oral hydromorphone for a patient being rotated from oral oxycodone. This calculation involves a multi-step process: converting the initial opioid dose to a common standard (oral morphine equivalent), converting this equivalent dose to the target opioid, and finally applying a dose reduction for safety.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{oxy}}$ be the total daily dose of oral oxycodone, $D_{\\text{morph}}$ be the equianalgesic total daily dose of oral morphine, $D_{\\text{hydro,eq}}$ be the equianalgesic total daily dose of oral hydromorphone, and $D_{\\text{hydro,new}}$ be the safe new starting total daily dose of oral hydromorphone.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Initial dose of oral oxycodone: $D_{\\text{oxy}} = 120$ mg/day.\n- Equianalgesic ratio 1: $20$ mg oral oxycodone $\\leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine.\n- Equianalgesic ratio 2: $7.5$ mg oral hydromorphone $\\leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine.\n- Dose reduction for incomplete cross-tolerance: a reduction of $30\\%$ from the equianalgesic dose.\n\nStep 1: Convert the daily dose of oral oxycodone to its oral morphine equivalent dose ($D_{\\text{morph}}$).\nFrom the first equianalgesic ratio, we can establish a conversion factor from oxycodone to morphine:\n$$ f_{\\text{oxy} \\to \\text{morph}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{mg morphine}}{20 \\, \\text{mg oxycodone}} = 1.5 $$\nUsing this factor, we calculate the total daily oral morphine equivalent dose:\n$$ D_{\\text{morph}} = D_{\\text{oxy}} \\times f_{\\text{oxy} \\to \\text{morph}} = 120 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 1.5 = 180 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nStep 2: Convert the oral morphine equivalent dose ($D_{\\text{morph}}$) to an equianalgesic dose of oral hydromorphone ($D_{\\text{hydro,eq}}$).\nFrom the second equianalgesic ratio, we establish a conversion factor from morphine to hydromorphone:\n$$ f_{\\text{morph} \\to \\text{hydro}} = \\frac{7.5 \\, \\text{mg hydromorphone}}{30 \\, \\text{mg morphine}} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nThe equianalgesic oral hydromorphone dose is then:\n$$ D_{\\text{hydro,eq}} = D_{\\text{morph}} \\times f_{\\text{morph} \\to \\text{hydro}} = 180 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 0.25 = 45 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nStep 3: Apply the dose reduction for incomplete cross-tolerance.\nA reduction of $30\\%$, which corresponds to a fractional reduction of $0.30$, is applied to the calculated equianalgesic dose to find the safe new starting dose, $D_{\\text{hydro,new}}$. This means the patient will receive $100\\% - 30\\% = 70\\%$ of the equianalgesic dose.\n$$ D_{\\text{hydro,new}} = D_{\\text{hydro,eq}} \\times (1 - 0.30) = 45 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 0.70 = 31.5 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nStep 4: Round the final answer to the specified number of significant figures.\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value is $31.5$. The first significant figure is $3$, and the second is $1$. The subsequent digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the preceding digit ($1$) to $2$.\n$$ D_{\\text{hydro,new,rounded}} = 32 $$\nThus, the safe new total daily dose of oral hydromorphone is $32$ mg/day.",

When initiating opioids for pain, managing their predictable side effects, such as constipation, is just as important as managing the pain itself.

            "problem": "A patient with metastatic lung cancer is starting high-dose sustained-release oral morphine at a total morphine equivalent daily dose of $200$ mg for severe pain. The patient has no signs of bowel obstruction, normal renal function, and maintains adequate oral fluid intake. Two days prior to opioid initiation, the patient's typical stool corresponded to Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) type $4$. The clinical goal is to maintain stool consistency near BSFS type $4$, which is assumed to correspond to a mean colonic transit time of $48$ hours.\n\nForty-eight hours after starting opioids, the mean colonic transit time estimated by radio-opaque marker study is $72$ hours, consistent with opioid-induced slowing of gut motility. As part of prophylaxis for opioid-induced constipation, the plan is to begin stimulant sennosides at a standard starting dose of $17.2$ mg at bedtime and to add daily oral Polyethylene Glycol (PEG $3350$) with a dose calculated to restore the mean colonic transit time toward the $48$-hour target.\n\nUse the following modeling assumptions for the pharmacodynamic effect of laxatives on mean colonic transit time:\n- For sennosides, the reduction in mean colonic transit time is saturable with a maximum achievable reduction of $12$ hours and a half-maximum (median effective dose) of $48$ mg.\n- For PEG $3350$, the reduction in mean colonic transit time is saturable with a maximum achievable reduction of $24$ hours and a half-maximum (median effective dose) of $34$ g.\n- For initial low-to-moderate dosing used in prophylaxis, the dose-response near zero dose may be approximated by the first-order (linear) term of a standard saturable model.\n\nConstruct a scientifically appropriate prophylactic bowel regimen by combining stimulant sennosides and PEG $3350$, and, based on the above assumptions, compute the single daily PEG $3350$ dose in grams required, when added to the fixed sennosides dose of $17.2$ mg, to reduce the opioid-affected mean colonic transit time from $72$ hours toward the $48$-hour target. Assume additive reductions in mean colonic transit time between sennosides and PEG $3350$ at these initial doses.\n\nExpress the final daily PEG $3350$ dose in grams, rounded to three significant figures.",

The clinical target for the mean CTT is $T_{\\text{target}} = 48$ hours.\nThe total required reduction in mean CTT, denoted as $\\Delta T_{\\text{total}}$, is the difference between the current and target times:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{total}} = T_{\\text{current}} - T_{\\text{target}} = 72 \\text{ hours} - 48 \\text{ hours} = 24 \\text{ hours} $$\nThe problem specifies that the pharmacodynamic effect of the laxatives (the reduction in CTT) can be described by a saturable model, often represented by the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation form:\n$$ \\Delta T(D) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot D}{ED_{50} + D} $$\nHere, $\\Delta T(D)$ is the reduction in CTT for a given dose $D$, $E_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum achievable reduction, and $ED_{50}$ is the dose that produces half of the maximum effect.\n\nFor the prophylactic regimen, the problem instructs to use a first-order (linear) approximation of this model, which is valid for low-to-moderate doses. This approximation corresponds to the initial slope of the dose-response curve at $D=0$. The slope, or potency constant $k$, is the derivative of $\\Delta T(D)$ with respect to $D$, evaluated at $D=0$:\n$$ k = \\frac{d}{dD}\\left(\\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot D}{ED_{50} + D}\\right)\\bigg|_{D=0} = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}}(ED_{50} + D) - (E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot D)(1)}{(ED_{50} + D)^2}\\bigg|_{D=0} = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{ED_{50}} $$\nThe linear approximation for the reduction in transit time is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta T(D) \\approx k \\cdot D = \\left(\\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{ED_{50}}\\right) D $$\nWe are given two laxatives, sennosides (S) and PEG $3350$ (P), and their effects are assumed to be additive.

            "problem": "A patient aged $76$ years with refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is in multiorgan failure. The patient is already on high-dose norepinephrine, and the team is considering escalating vasopressor therapy by adding vasopressin and epinephrine. To assess whether escalation is proportionate or medically futile, use a proportionality analysis grounded in expected value and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) concepts.\n\nUse the following ethically and clinically grounded assumptions, consistent with introductory decision analysis in medicine:\n\n- Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is defined as the integral of health-related quality of life over time; for a period with constant utility $u$ lasting duration $t$ (in years), this is $u \\times t$.\n- Expected value across uncertain outcomes is the probability-weighted sum of the values of those outcomes.\n\nBaseline (no escalation) trajectory:\n- Expected remaining time to death is $4$ days under comfort-focused care with an average utility of $0.6$.\n\nEscalation trajectory:\n- Let $p$ denote the probability that the patient survives to hospital discharge if vasopressors are escalated. If the patient survives to discharge, the expected post-discharge survival is $0.4$ years with a utility of $0.3$, preceded by an intensive care unit course of $14$ days with utility $0.1$. If the patient dies in the hospital despite escalation (probability $1-p$), the time to death is $10$ days with utility $0.1$.\n- Independent of survival, escalation carries a probability $c=0.25$ of clinically significant ischemic complication (for example, digital ischemia) with a burden equivalent to a $0.02$ QALY decrement.\n\nFor the purposes of proportionality analysis, treat the expected benefit $E[B]$ as the expected post-discharge QALYs under escalation (there is no post-discharge survival without escalation), and treat the expected harm $E[H]$ as the sum of:\n- the expected shortfall in in-hospital QALYs under escalation relative to baseline comfort-focused care, plus\n- the expected QALY-equivalent burden of ischemic complications.\n\nCompute the threshold probability $p^{\\ast}$ such that $E[B]=E[H]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid application of decision analysis and bioethical principles to a realistic clinical scenario. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe goal is to find the threshold probability of survival to hospital discharge, denoted as $p^{\\ast}$, at which the expected benefit $E[B]$ of escalating vasopressor therapy equals its expected harm $E[H]$. We are given the condition $E[B] = E[H]$. We must first formulate expressions for $E[B]$ and $E[H]$ as functions of the probability $p$. For all calculations, time in days must be converted to years using the given conversion of $1 \\text{ year} = 365 \\text{ days}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected benefit, $E[B]$, which is defined as the expected post-discharge Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). This benefit is only realized if the patient survives to discharge, an event with probability $p$. The post-discharge survival is $t_{post} = 0.4$ years with a utility of $u_{post} = 0.3$. The QALYs for this period are the product of duration and utility.\n$$\nQALY_{post} = u_{post} \\times t_{post} = 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0.12\n$$\nThe expected benefit is then the value of this outcome multiplied by its probability:\n$$\nE[B] = p \\times QALY_{post} = 0.12p\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected harm, $E[H]$, which is the sum of two components: ($1$) the expected shortfall in in-hospital QALYs under escalation compared to baseline, and ($2$) the expected QALY-equivalent burden of ischemic complications.\n$$\nE[H] = E[\\text{QALY shortfall}] + E[\\text{complication burden}]\n$$\n\nLet's compute the first component of harm, the expected QALY shortfall. This requires calculating the QALYs for the baseline (no escalation) trajectory and subtracting the expected in-hospital QALYs for the escalation trajectory.\n\nThe QALYs for the baseline trajectory ($QALY_{base}$) are calculated from an expected survival of $t_{base} = 4$ days with a utility of $u_{base} = 0.6$.\n$$\nt_{base} = \\frac{4}{365} \\text{ years}\n$$\n$$\nQALY_{base} = u_{base} \\times t_{base} = 0.6 \\times \\frac{4}{365} = \\frac{2.4}{365}\n$$\n\nThe expected in-hospital QALYs under escalation, $E[QALY_{in-hosp}]$, depend on two mutually exclusive outcomes:\n1.

This harm occurs with probability $c = 0.25$ and carries a QALY decrement of $0.02$.\n$$\nE[\\text{complication burden}] = c \\times (\\text{QALY decrement}) = 0.25 \\times 0.02 = 0.005\n$$\n\nWe can now write the full expression for the total expected harm, $E[H]$:\n$$\nE[H] = \\frac{1.4 - 0.4p}{365} + 0.005\n$$\n\nThe proportionality threshold $p^{\\ast}$ is found by setting $E[B] = E[H]$ and solving for $p$.\n$$\n0.12p = \\frac{1.4 - 0.4p}{365} + 0.005\n$$\nTo solve for $p$, we first multiply the entire equation by $365$ to eliminate the fraction:\n$$\n365 \\times (0.12p) = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.4 - 0.4p}{365}\\right) + 365 \\times (0.005)\n$$\n$$\n43.8p = (1.4 - 0.4p) + 1.825\n$$\n$$\n43.8p = 3.225 - 0.4p\n$$\nNext, we group all terms containing $p$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\n43.8p + 0.4p = 3.225\n$$\n$$\n44.2p = 3.225\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $p$:\n$$\np = p^{\\ast} = \\frac{3.225}{44.2} \\approx 0.0729638009...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures.
