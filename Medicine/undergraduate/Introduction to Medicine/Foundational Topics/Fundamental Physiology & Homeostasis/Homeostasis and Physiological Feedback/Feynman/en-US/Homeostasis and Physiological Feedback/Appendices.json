Consider a patient at steady state at body temperature $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The chemically relevant equilibria are the hydration of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid and its dissociation to hydrogen ion and bicarbonate, and the dissolution of carbon dioxide from gas to liquid. Use only the following foundational facts as your starting point: (i) the definition of acidity $\\mathrm{pH} \\equiv -\\log_{10}\\left(\\mathrm{a}_{\\mathrm{H^+}}\\right)$, approximating activity by concentration at physiological ionic strength, (ii) the law of mass action for a weak acid $\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H^+} + \\mathrm{A^-}$ with dissociation constant $K_a = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{A^-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}$, (iii) at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ the apparent acid dissociation constant of carbonic acid yields $\\mathrm{p}K_a \\approx 6.1$, and (iv) Henry’s law for dissolved carbon dioxide $\\left[\\mathrm{CO_2(d)}\\right] = \\alpha\\, P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ with solubility coefficient $\\alpha \\approx 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$, with the rapid hydration equilibrium allowing the approximation $\\left[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}\\right] \\approx \\left[\\mathrm{CO_2(d)}\\right]$ in blood.\n\nThe patient’s measured values are $[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}] = 18\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of acid-base chemistry and physiology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is stated objectively without ambiguity.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for $\\mathrm{pH}$ based on the provided fundamental principles. The system described is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer system, governed by the equilibrium $\\mathrm{H_2CO_3} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H^+} + \\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the acid dissociation constant $K_a$ for this equilibrium is given by:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}{[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}]}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^+}] = K_a \\frac{[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}]}{[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}$$\nThe problem states that the concentration of carbonic acid, $[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}]$, can be approximated by the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide, $[\\mathrm{CO_2(d)}]$, due to rapid hydration equilibrium. Further, Henry's law relates the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide to its partial pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$, via the solubility coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}] \\approx [\\mathrm{CO_2(d)}] = \\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[\\mathrm{H_2CO_3}]$ into the equation for $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$ yields:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^+}] = K_a \\frac{\\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}$$\nThe definition of $\\mathrm{pH}$ is the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity, which is approximated by a concentration basis as $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H^+}])$. Applying this definition to the expression for $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_a \\frac{\\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_a) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.

The patient's $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ of $30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is also low, which would cause an alkalosis (an increase in $\\mathrm{pH}$). Since the resulting $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.401$ is normal, this indicates a fully compensated acid-base disorder.\nThe combination of a low $[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$ and a compensatory low $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ is the classic presentation of **metabolic acidosis**. The primary disturbance is metabolic, specifically a process leading to a decrease in plasma bicarbonate. The **respiratory system** is compensating by increasing the rate of ventilation to \"blow off\" $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, thus lowering the arterial $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ and raising the blood $\\mathrm{pH}$ back towards the normal range.",

The relationship is stated to be of the form $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = a\\, [\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}] + b$. We are provided with two empirically determined points that lie on this line: ($[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$, $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$) = $(12, 26)$ and ($[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$, $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$) = $(20, 38)$. The units for $[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$ are $\\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$ and for $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ are $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the slope $a$ of the line using the two given points. The slope is the change in the dependent variable ($P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$) divided by the change in the independent variable ($[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$).\nLet $(x_1, y_1) = (12, 26)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (20, 38)$, where $x$ represents $[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]$ and $y$ represents $P_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$.\nThe slope $a$ is calculated as:\n$$a = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{38 - 26}{20 - 12} = \\frac{12}{8} = 1.5$$\n\nNext, we determine the $y$-intercept $b$ of the linear equation. We can substitute the value of $a$ and the coordinates of one of the points into the equation $y = ax + b$. Using the first point $(12, 26)$:\n$$26 = (1.5)(12) + b$$\n$$26 = 18 + b$$\n$$b = 26 - 18 = 8$$\nTo ensure correctness, we can verify this using the second point $(20, 38)$:\n$$38 = (1.5)(20) + b$$\n$$38 = 30 + b$$\n$$b = 38 - 30 = 8$$\nThe value of $b$ is consistent.

Sufficiently large transport delay $T$ and loop gain $K$ are the key factors for instability. The delay introduces a large phase lag, causing the controller's response to be out-of-sync. If the gain $K$ is also large enough to make the response magnitude $|G_{OL}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega\\tau)^2}} \\ge 1$ at this critical frequency, the system's natural damping is overcome, and sustained oscillations (CSR) emerge.\n\n**Derivation of Oscillation Conditions**\nMarginal, self-sustained oscillations occur when the system's poles are on the imaginary axis, $s = j\\omega$, which corresponds to the Nyquist boundary condition $G_{OL}(j\\omega) = -1$:\n$$\\frac{K e^{-j\\omega T}}{1+j\\omega\\tau} = -1$$\nThis complex equation yields two real equations for magnitude and phase:\n1.  **Magnitude Condition**: $|G_{OL}(j\\omega)| = 1 \\implies \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega\\tau)^2}} = 1 \\implies \\omega\\tau = \\sqrt{K^2-1}$.
