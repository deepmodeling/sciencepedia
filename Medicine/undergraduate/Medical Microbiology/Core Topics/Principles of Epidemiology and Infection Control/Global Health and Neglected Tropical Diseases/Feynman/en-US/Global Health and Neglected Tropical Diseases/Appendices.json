            "problem": "A provincial health ministry in a low-resource setting is quantifying the burden of a neglected tropical disease in a single calendar year to inform allocation of limited control resources. Following the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework, the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) combines Years Lived with Disability (YLD) and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Assume a homogeneous cohort in which each incident case experiences a constant disability weight throughout the illness and the same average duration, and each death occurs at an age where the remaining standard life expectancy is the same for all decedents. The ministry reports the following epidemiological summary for the year:\n- Incidence $I = 5{,}000$ cases\n- Disability weight $w = 0.2$\n- Average duration $D = 2$ years\n- Mortality $M = 100$ deaths\n- Standard life expectancy at age of death $L = 30$ years\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of the burden metrics consistent with the Global Burden of Disease approach, derive expressions for $YLD$ and $YLL$ under the above homogeneity assumptions, and then compute the numerical values of $YLD$, $YLL$, and total $DALY$ for this dataset. Express all answers in years. Provide exact values; no rounding. Present your final triple in the order $\\left(YLD,\\, YLL,\\, DALY\\right)$.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a direct application of standard epidemiological principles from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The provided simplifying assumptions of a homogeneous cohort are standard for such introductory calculations and do not invalidate the problem.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total burden of disease as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($DALY$). The $DALY$ is defined as the sum of Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$) and Years of Life Lost ($YLL$) due to premature mortality.\n$$DALY = YLD + YLL$$\nWe will derive and compute the value for each component based on the provided data for a cohort of new cases arising in a single year.\n\nFirst, we consider the Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$). This metric quantifies the morbidity, or the burden of living in states of less than full health. For a cohort of incident cases, the total $YLD$ is calculated by multiplying the number of new cases (Incidence, $I$) by the severity of the disease (Disability Weight, $w$) and the average duration of the disease ($D$). The problem states we can assume a constant disability weight throughout the illness for a homogeneous cohort.\n\nThe expression for $YLD$ is:\n$$YLD = I \\times w \\times D$$\nThe provided values are:\n- Incidence $I = 5{,}000$ cases\n- Disability weight $w = 0.2$ (a dimensionless value between $0$ for perfect health and $1$ for death)\n- Average duration $D = 2$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression yields:\n$$YLD = 5{,}000 \\times 0.2 \\times 2$$\n$$YLD = 1{,}000 \\times 2$$\n$$YLD = 2{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, we consider the Years of Life Lost ($YLL$). This metric quantifies the mortality burden by measuring the years of life lost due to premature death. It is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths ($M$) by the standard life expectancy at the age of death ($L$). This value $L$ represents the number of years a person would have been expected to live had they not died prematurely from the disease.\n\nThe expression for $YLL$ is:\n$$YLL = M \\times L$$\nThe provided values are:\n- Mortality $M = 100$ deaths\n- Standard life expectancy at age of death $L = 30$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression yields:\n$$YLL = 100 \\times 30$$\n$$YLL = 3{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($DALY$) is computed by summing the $YLD$ and $YLL$ components.\n$$DALY = YLD + YLL$$\n$$DALY = 2{,}000 + 3{,}000$$\n$$DALY = 5{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe numerical values for the requested triple $(YLD, YLL, DALY)$ are therefore $(2000, 3000, 5000)$, with all units in years.",

This exercise bridges epidemiological theory and practical program planning by exploring the concept of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the goal of reducing the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, to below one. You will derive and calculate the minimum mass drug administration coverage required to halt transmission, a critical calculation for ensuring a campaign's success.",

            "problem": "A public health team is planning annual mass drug administration (MDA) for a soil-transmitted helminth in a region where the basic reproduction number $R_0$ has been estimated as $R_0 = 2.5$. The oral anthelmintic has per-individual cure efficacy $e = 0.9$, meaning that for a treated individual, infection is cleared with probability $e$ and the individual contributes no transmission for the subsequent transmission season. Assume homogeneous random mixing, a closed population over the transmission season, and that treatment is delivered instantaneously at the start of the season to a fraction $c$ of the population selected at random and independent of infection status or exposure risk. Define the effective reproduction number $R_e$ as the expected number of secondary infections per primary infection in the current, partially protected population.\n\nUsing only the definition of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible and intervention-free population, and the notion that interventions reduce the per-capita transmission potential multiplicatively by the remaining fraction of transmission-capable contacts or hosts, derive the inequality that $c$ must satisfy so that $R_e < 1$ during the season. Then, compute the minimal coverage $c$ that satisfies this inequality for $R_0 = 2.5$ and $e = 0.9$.\n\nRound your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal fraction (do not use a percentage sign). In your reasoning, explicitly state the modeling assumptions that justify your derivation of the control threshold.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an inequality for the minimal required coverage, $c$, of a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign to bring the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, below $1$, and to compute this value for the given parameters. The derivation hinges on relating $R_e$ to the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, by modeling the impact of the intervention.\n\nThe fundamental principle connecting $R_e$ to $R_0$ in a population with partial immunity or protection is given by $R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$, where $s$ is the fraction of the population that remains susceptible to infection. This relationship is a direct consequence of the mass-action principle under the assumption of homogeneous random mixing, which is explicitly stated in the problem. The number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual is proportional to the density of susceptible individuals they can successfully infect.\n\nThe intervention consists of treating a fraction $c$ of the population, chosen at random, with an anthelmintic drug of efficacy $e=0.9$. The problem states that for a treated individual, the infection is cleared with probability $e$ and the individual \"contributes no transmission for the subsequent transmission season.\" This implies that the intervention effectively removes a fraction of the population from the transmission cycle, rendering them equivalent to immune or non-susceptible individuals for the duration of the season.\n\nLet's precisely quantify the fraction of the population that remains susceptible or capable of participating in transmission after the MDA campaign.\nA fraction $c$ of the population receives treatment.\nOf this treated fraction $c$, a proportion $e$ are successfully \"cured\" or \"protected\" in the sense that they will not contribute to transmission. Thus, the fraction of the total population that is successfully protected by the intervention is the product of the coverage and the efficacy, which is $c \\cdot e$.\nThe remaining fraction of the population, which is still capable of participating in the transmission cycle (i.e., the effective susceptible fraction, $s$), is therefore $1 - c \\cdot e$.\n\nThe modeling assumptions that justify this derivation are:\n1.  **Homogeneous Random Mixing**: Every individual has an equal probability of contacting any other individual, so the reduction in transmission is directly proportional to the reduction in the susceptible/available population fraction.\n2.  **Random and Independent Treatment**: The fraction $c$ of the population is treated at random, irrespective of their infection or risk status. This allows us to calculate the protected fraction of the total population as a simple product.\n3.  **Leaky Protection Model**: The intervention is modeled as providing \"all-or-nothing\" protection to a fraction $e$ of the treated group $c$. This means a fraction $c \\cdot e$ of the total population becomes fully protected, while the rest remain fully susceptible. The problem's phrasing supports this interpretation.\n\nUsing this result, we can express the effective reproduction number $R_e$ as:\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot e)$$\n\nThe goal of the public health program is to halt transmission, which is mathematically represented by the condition $R_e < 1$. We can now establish the inequality that the coverage $c$ must satisfy:\n$$R_0 (1 - c \\cdot e) < 1$$\n\nThis is the general inequality relating $c$ to $R_0$ and $e$. To find the minimal coverage required, we solve this inequality for $c$.\n$$1 - c \\cdot e < \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} < c \\cdot e$$\n$$c \\cdot e > 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c > \\frac{1}{e} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\right)$$\n\nThis inequality defines the condition on the coverage $c$. Any coverage greater than the right-hand side will result in $R_e < 1$. The minimal coverage, which we can denote $c_{min}$, is the value at the threshold of this inequality:\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. We are given $R_0 = 2.5$ and $e = 0.9$.\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1}{0.9} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2.5} \\right)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the term in the parenthesis:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{2.5} = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $c_{min}$:\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1}{0.9} \\times 0.6 = \\frac{0.6}{0.9} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe exact value for the minimal coverage is $\\frac{2}{3}$. The problem requires the answer as a decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures.\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$c_{min} \\approx 0.667$$\nTherefore, a minimum of approximately $66.7\\%$ of the population must be treated to ensure the effective reproduction number falls below $1$.",
