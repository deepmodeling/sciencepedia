However, selectivity is not a simple on/off switch; it is a dose-dependent balance between suppressing non-target organisms and permitting the recovery of target ones. This practice challenges you to move beyond a qualitative understanding by using a mathematical model to determine the precise inhibitor concentration that maximizes this differential effect, a key step in the rational design of any selective medium .",

            "problem": "In designing a selective and differential medium inspired by MacConkey agar for isolating lactose-fermenting Enterobacteriaceae, you adjust the concentration $C$ (in g L$^{-1}$) of a bile salt mixture that inhibits Gram-positive bacteria more strongly than Gram-negative bacteria. Assume the following well-tested pharmacodynamic fact: for a single-site inhibitor with non-cooperative binding (Hill exponent $1$), the survival probability $s(C)$ relative to an inhibitor-free control can be modeled by the Hill-type inhibition function $s(C) = 1/\\bigl(1 + (C/\\mathrm{IC}_{50})\\bigr)$, where $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Let the target group (Gram-negative enterics) have $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ equal to $a = 2.0$ g L$^{-1}$, and the non-target group (Gram-positive cocci) have $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ equal to $b = 0.20$ g L$^{-1}$. Define the survival probabilities as\n$$s_{T}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{a}\\right)}, \\quad s_{N}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{b}\\right)},$$\nand the differential survivorship as\n$$\\Delta s(C) = s_{T}(C) - s_{N}(C).$$\nUsing only the definitions and facts stated above and standard calculus, determine the inhibitor concentration $C^{\\ast}$ (in g L$^{-1}$) that maximizes $\\Delta s(C)$. Express your final answer in g L$^{-1}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The givens are:\n- Target group survival probability: $s_{T}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{a}\\right)}$, with $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ value $a = 2.0$ g L$^{-1}$.\n- Non-target group survival probability: $s_{N}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{b}\\right)}$, with $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ value $b = 0.20$ g L$^{-1}$.\n- Differential survivorship function: $\\Delta s(C) = s_{T}(C) - s_{N}(C)$.\n- The objective is to find the concentration $C^{\\ast}$ that maximizes $\\Delta s(C)$.\n\nThe problem uses a standard Hill-type inhibition model, a cornerstone of pharmacodynamics, and is based on the correct microbiological principle that bile salts are selectively inhibitory. The constants $a$ and $b$ are given with $a > b$, correctly reflecting that the non-target group (Gram-positive) is more sensitive (lower $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$) to the inhibitor than the target group (Gram-negative). The problem is self-contained, mathematically formalizable, and free of contradictions. The question is a standard optimization problem in calculus. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of $C$ that maximizes the function $\\Delta s(C)$. The domain for the concentration $C$ is $C \\ge 0$. The function is:\n$$ \\Delta s(C) = s_{T}(C) - s_{N}(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{C}{a}} - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{C}{b}} $$\nTo find the maximum, we must first find the critical points of $\\Delta s(C)$ by computing its derivative with respect to $C$ and setting it to zero.\nWe can write the function as:\n$$ \\Delta s(C) = \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{a}\\right)^{-1} - \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{b}\\right)^{-1} $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)]^n = n[f(x)]^{n-1} f'(x)$, the derivative $\\frac{d(\\Delta s)}{dC}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta s)}{dC} = -1 \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{a}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) - (-1) \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{b}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta s)}{dC} = \\frac{1}{b\\left(1 + \\frac{C}{b}\\right)^2} - \\frac{1}{a\\left(1 + \\frac{C}{a}\\right)^2} $$\nTo find the critical concentration $C^{\\ast}$, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{1}{b\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{b}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{a\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{a}\\right)^2} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides yields:\n$$ b\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{b}\\right)^2 = a\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{a}\\right)^2 $$\nSince $a$, $b$, and $C^{\\ast}$ must be positive quantities (concentration cannot be negative), we can take the positive square root of both sides:\n$$ \\sqrt{b}\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{b}\\right) = \\sqrt{a}\\left(1 + \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{a}\\right) $$\nDistributing the terms on both sides:\n$$ \\sqrt{b} + \\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{b} C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{a} + \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{a} C^{\\ast} $$\nSimplifying the coefficients of $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{b} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b}} C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{a} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} C^{\\ast} $$\nNow, we group the terms containing $C^{\\ast}$ and the constant terms:\n$$ C^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right) = \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} $$\nWe can combine the terms in the parenthesis on the left-hand side:\n$$ C^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{ab}}\\right) = \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} $$\nSince $a=2.0$ and $b=0.20$, we have $a \\neq b$, which implies $\\sqrt{a} \\neq \\sqrt{b}$. Therefore, the term $\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}$ is non-zero, and we can divide both sides by it:\n$$ \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{\\sqrt{ab}} = 1 $$\nThis gives the optimal concentration $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$ C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{ab} $$\nThis result shows that the concentration yielding the maximum differential survivorship is the geometric mean of the two $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ values.\n\nTo confirm this corresponds to a maximum, we can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative. Let's examine the first derivative's sign. For $C < C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{ab}$, we have $C^2 < ab$, which implies $\\frac{C}{a} < \\frac{b}{C}$. Manipulating this indicates that the derivative is positive. For $C > C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{ab}$, the derivative is negative. Specifically, at $C=0$, $\\frac{d(\\Delta s)}{dC}|_{C=0} = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{a} > 0$ since $a > b$. As $C \\to \\infty$, the derivative behaves as $\\frac{b}{C^2} - \\frac{a}{C^2} = \\frac{b-a}{C^2} < 0$. Since the derivative changes from positive to negative at $C^{\\ast}$, this critical point corresponds to a local maximum. As this is the only critical point for $C > 0$, and $\\Delta s(0) = 0$ and $\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\Delta s(C) = 0$, $C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{ab}$ is the global maximum.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values $a = 2.0$ g L$^{-1}$ and $b = 0.20$ g L$^{-1}$ to find the numerical value of $C^{\\ast}$.\n$$ C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{(2.0) \\cdot (0.20)} = \\sqrt{0.40} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ C^{\\ast} \\approx 0.6324555... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ C^{\\ast} \\approx 0.632 $$\nThe units are g L$^{-1}$, as requested.",
