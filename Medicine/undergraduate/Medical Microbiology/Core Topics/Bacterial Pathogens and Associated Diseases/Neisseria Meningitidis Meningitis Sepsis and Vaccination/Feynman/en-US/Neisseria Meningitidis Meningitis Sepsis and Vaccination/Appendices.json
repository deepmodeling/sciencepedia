A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of the isolate being *Neisseria meningitidis* ($H_{Nm}$) given the set of positive test results ($E$). This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(H_{Nm} | E) = \\frac{P(E | H_{Nm}) P(H_{Nm})}{P(E)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence, calculated by marginalizing over all possible hypotheses using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(E) = \\sum_{i} P(E | H_i) P(H_i)\n$$\nwhere $i$ indexes the four possible organisms: $Nm, Ng, Nl, Mc$.\n\nThe problem states that the individual test results are conditionally independent given the organism. This allows us to calculate the likelihood of observing the complete set of evidence $E$ for any given hypothesis $H_i$ as the product of the individual test likelihoods:\n$$\nP(E | H_i) = P(Ox^+ | H_i) \\times P(Glc^+ | H_i) \\times P(Mal^+ | H_i) \\times P(Cap^+ | H_i)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the likelihood term $P(E | H_i)$ for each of the four organisms.\n\n1.  For *Neisseria meningitidis* ($H_{Nm}$):\n    $P(E | H_{Nm}) = 0.99 \\times 0.97 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.90 = 0.8197515$\n\n2.

For *Neisseria lactamica* ($H_{Nl}$):\n    $P(E | H_{Nl}) = 0.98 \\times 0.94 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.05 = 0.0414204$\n\n4.  For *Moraxella catarrhalis* ($H_{Mc}$):\n    $P(E | H_{Mc}) = 0.95 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.02 = 0.0000475$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator of Bayes' theorem for our hypothesis of interest, $H_{Nm}$. This is the joint probability of the evidence and the hypothesis.\n$$\nP(E | H_{Nm}) P(H_{Nm}) = 0.8197515 \\times 0.70 = 0.57382605\n$$\nNow, we calculate the denominator, $P(E)$, by summing the joint probabilities for all four hypotheses:\n\\begin{align*}\nP(E) &= P(E | H_{Nm}) P(H_{Nm}) + P(E | H_{Ng}) P(H_{Ng}) + P(E | H_{Nl}) P(H_{Nl}) + P(E | H_{Mc}) P(H_{Mc}) \\\\\n&= (0.8197515 \\times 0.70) + (0.0001881 \\times 0.05) + (0.0414204 \\times 0.15) + (0.0000475 \\times 0.10) \\\\\n&= 0.57382605 + 0.000009405 + 0.00621306 + 0.00000475 \\\\\n&= 0.580053265\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, we can compute the posterior probability $P(H_{Nm} | E)$:\n$$\nP(H_{Nm} | E) = \\frac{P(E | H_{Nm}) P(H_{Nm})}{P(E)} = \\frac{0.57382605}{0.580053265} \\approx 0.98926430\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nP(H_{Nm} | E) \\approx 0.9893\n$$\nThis result indicates that given the high prior probability and the specific pattern of test results (especially positive maltose utilization and capsule detection, which are much less likely in the other organisms), there is a very high probability that the isolate is *Neisseria meningitidis*.",

            "problem": "Neisseria meningitidis is an encapsulated Gram-negative diplococcus that is cleared from the bloodstream primarily by complement-mediated bactericidal activity, culminating in the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC). Individuals with terminal complement component deficiencies affecting components C5 through C9 have impaired MAC formation. Starting from the core definitions of the complement cascade and the role of the MAC in serum bactericidal activity, explain mechanistically why terminal complement deficiencies increase the risk of invasive meningococcal disease. Then, use the following carefully curated epidemiological data to compute the expected fold-increase in incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in terminal complement-deficient individuals compared to the general population, while accounting for vaccination:\n\nA cohort of $N_{\\text{def}} = 1{,}000$ persons with hereditary terminal complement component deficiencies (C5–C9), followed for $10$ years with complete case ascertainment, experienced $35$ incident cases of culture-confirmed invasive meningococcal disease.

Assume vaccine effects act multiplicatively on incidence and are identical in both groups.\n\nCompute the expected fold-increase in incidence in the complement-deficient cohort relative to the general population after accounting for the vaccine effect as described. Express the final answer as a unitless ratio and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of immunology and epidemiology, its terms are well-defined, the provided data are self-consistent and sufficient for a solution, and the question is well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful answer.\n\nThe solution consists of two parts: a mechanistic explanation of the increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in complement-deficient individuals, and a quantitative calculation of the fold-increase in incidence.\n\n**Part 1: Mechanistic Explanation**\n\nThe complement system is a critical component of the innate immune system responsible for identifying and eliminating pathogens. It comprises a cascade of proteins that, once activated through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, converge to cleave the complement component $C3$ and subsequently $C5$.\n\nThe cleavage of $C5$ into $C5a$ and $C5b$ by the $C5$ convertase initiates the terminal stage of the complement cascade. The $C5b$ fragment binds to the surface of a target pathogen and sequentially recruits components $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, and multiple molecules of $C9$. This assembly forms the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), a cylindrical, pore-forming structure with the molecular formula $C5b-9$.\n\n*Neisseria meningitidis* is a Gram-negative diplococcus, characterized by an inner cytoplasmic membrane and a relatively exposed outer membrane. The MAC is particularly effective against such bacteria because it can insert itself into this outer membrane, creating a stable, unregulated transmembrane channel. The formation of this pore disrupts the electrochemical gradient across the bacterial membrane, leading to an influx of water and ions, rapid osmotic lysis, and death of the bacterium. This process is known as complement-mediated bacteriolysis, a primary mechanism for clearing meningococci from the bloodstream.\n\nIndividuals with hereditary deficiencies in any of the terminal complement components ($C5$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, or $C9$) are unable to form the functional MAC. Without the MAC, the host's ability to efficiently lyse and clear *N. meningitidis* from circulation is severely impaired. This allows the bacteria to survive and replicate in the bloodstream (bacteremia/sepsis) and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis. Therefore, the absence of a functional terminal complement pathway is a major specific risk factor for invasive disease caused by *Neisseria* species.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe primary goal is to compute the fold-increase in the incidence of IMD in the complement-deficient cohort relative to the general population. This is equivalent to calculating the Incidence Rate Ratio ($IRR$).\n\nLet $I_{\\text{def}}$ and $I_{\\text{gen}}$ be the observed incidence rates in the deficient and general populations, respectively. Let $I_{\\text{def, raw}}$ and $I_{\\text{gen, raw}}$ be the underlying incidence rates that would have been observed in the absence of any vaccination program. The problem asks for the fold-increase after accounting for the vaccine, which corresponds to the ratio of these underlying rates, $IRR_{\\text{raw}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{def, raw}}}{I_{\\text{gen, raw}}}$.\n\nThe problem states that \"vaccine effects act multiplicatively on incidence and are identical in both groups.\" This implies that the observed incidence in each population is the raw incidence multiplied by a common reduction factor, $M$, which accounts for the population-level effect of the vaccination program.\n$$I_{\\text{def}} = I_{\\text{def, raw}} \\times M$$\n$$I_{\\text{gen}} = I_{\\text{gen, raw}} \\times M$$\n\nThe factor $M$ depends on vaccine coverage ($p$), vaccine effectiveness ($e$), and the proportion of disease caused by vaccine-preventable serogroups. Since all these parameters are stated or can be assumed to be identical for both groups, the multiplicative factor $M$ is the same for both.\n\nWhen we compute the ratio of the observed incidence rates, this common factor cancels out:\n$$IRR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{def}}}{I_{\\text{gen}}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{def, raw}} \\times M}{I_{\\text{gen, raw}} \\times M} = \\frac{I_{\\text{def, raw}}}{I_{\\text{gen, raw}}} = IRR_{\\text{raw}}$$\n\nThus, the fold-increase in underlying risk is equal to the ratio of the observed incidence rates. The provided values for vaccine coverage ($p = 0.80$) and effectiveness ($e = 0.85$) are essential for establishing that the conditions for this cancellation hold, but their numerical values are not required for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the incidence rate in the complement-deficient cohort ($I_{\\text{def}}$).\nNumber of persons in the cohort, $N_{\\text{def}} = 1000$.\nFollow-up time, $t = 10$ years.\nTotal person-years of observation, $PY_{\\text{def}} = N_{\\text{def}} \\times t = 1000 \\times 10 = 10000 \\text{ person-years}$.\nNumber of incident cases, $C_{\\text{def}} = 35$.\n\nThe incidence rate is:\n$$I_{\\text{def}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{def}}}{PY_{\\text{def}}} = \\frac{35}{10000} \\text{ cases per person-year}$$\n\nNext, we use the data for the general population ($I_{\\text{gen}}$).\nTotal person-years of observation, $PY_{\\text{gen}} = 10000000 \\text{ person-years}$.\nNumber of incident cases, $C_{\\text{gen}} = 70$.\n\nThe incidence rate is:\n$$I_{\\text{gen}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{gen}}}{PY_{\\text{gen}}} = \\frac{70}{10000000} \\text{ cases per person-year}$$\n\nNow, we compute the Incidence Rate Ratio ($IRR$), which represents the desired fold-increase.\n$$IRR = \\frac{I_{\\text{def}}}{I_{\\text{gen}}} = \\frac{35 / 10000}{70 / 10000000}$$\n$$IRR = \\frac{35}{10^{4}} \\times \\frac{10^{7}}{70}$$\n$$IRR = \\frac{35 \\times 10^{3}}{70}$$\n$$IRR = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10^{3} = 500$$\n\nThe expected fold-increase in incidence is $500$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. In scientific notation, $500$ with three significant figures is $5.00 \\times 10^2$.",

It is a well-posed problem in mathematical epidemiology, based on established principles of the SIR model and herd immunity. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clearly defined.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum fraction $p$ of a population that must be immune to prevent sustained transmission of *Neisseria meningitidis*. This is a classic herd immunity problem. The core principle is that sustained transmission is averted when the effective reproduction number, $R_{eff}$, is less than or equal to $1$. $R_{eff}$ represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious individual in a population that is partially susceptible.\n\nFirst, we calculate the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. The problem defines $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population. In the context of the SIR model, $R_0$ is the product of the transmission rate and the average duration of infectiousness.\n\nThe per capita transmission rate, $\\beta$, is given by the product of the mean number of effective close-contact events per person per day, $c$, and the per-contact probability of transmission, $q$.\n$$\n\\beta = c \\, q\n$$\nThe recovery rate, $\\gamma$, is the reciprocal of the mean duration of carriage, $\\tau$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the ratio of the transmission rate to the recovery rate.\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} = \\frac{c \\, q}{1/\\tau} = c \\, q \\, \\tau\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Mean number of effective contacts, $c = 0.5 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- Per-contact transmission probability, $q = 0.05$\n- Mean duration of carriage, $\\tau = 90 \\text{ days}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R_0$:\n$$\nR_0 = (0.5)(0.05)(90) = 0.025 \\times 90 = 2.25\n$$\nThis value, $R_0 = 2.25$, means that in a completely susceptible population, a single carrier would, on average, transmit the infection to $2.25$ other individuals.\n\nNow, consider a population where a fraction $p$ is immune. The fraction of the population that remains susceptible is $s = 1 - p$. The effective reproduction number, $R_{eff}$, is the basic reproduction number scaled by the susceptible fraction of the population:\n$$\nR_{eff} = R_0 \\times s = R_0 (1-p)\n$$\nThis is because an infectious individual's contacts will only lead to a new infection if the contact is with a susceptible person, which occurs with probability $s$.\n\nTo prevent sustained transmission (i.e., to prevent an epidemic from taking off), the number of infected individuals must not increase. This requires that each infectious person, on average, passes the infection to one or fewer other people. The critical threshold condition is therefore:\n$$\nR_{eff} \\le 1\n$$\nTo find the minimum fraction $p$ required for immunity, we set $R_{eff}$ to its critical value of $1$:\n$$\nR_0(1-p) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n1-p = \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\n$$\np = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nThis value of $p$ is known as the herd immunity threshold.
