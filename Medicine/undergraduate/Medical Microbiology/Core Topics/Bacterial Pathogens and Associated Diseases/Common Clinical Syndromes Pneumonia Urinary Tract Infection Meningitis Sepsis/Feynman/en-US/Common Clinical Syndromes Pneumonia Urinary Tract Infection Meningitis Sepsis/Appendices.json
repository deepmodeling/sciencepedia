The fundamental base for this model is that the instantaneous rate of change of the population size is proportional to its current size with a constant per-capita rate under fixed environmental conditions. Specifically, assume the per-capita growth rate is constant and equal to $r$, and the initial condition at $t=0$ is a single well-mixed inoculum of $N_{0}$ colony-forming units (CFU). The clinically relevant threshold for overt pneumonia is reached when the population attains $N$ CFU.\n\nUsing only the stated base (that the instantaneous rate of change is proportional to population size with constant per-capita rate), derive the time $t$ required for the bacterial population to grow from $N_{0}$ to $N$ under these early-phase conditions.

The solution must proceed by first computing standard measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values), then deriving likelihood ratios, and finally applying Bayes' theorem in its odds-based form.\n\nFirst, we formalize the provided data. Let $D+$ denote the presence of disease (pneumonia) and $D-$ denote its absence. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result and $T-$ denote a negative test result. The given data points are:\n- True Positives (TP): The number of individuals with the disease who test positive. $TP = 110$.\n- False Negatives (FN): The number of individuals with the disease who test negative. $FN = 10$.\n- False Positives (FP): The number of individuals without the disease who test positive. $FP = 15$.\n- True Negatives (TN): The number of individuals without the disease who test negative. $TN = 85$.\n\nFrom these fundamental counts, we can calculate the marginal totals:\n- Total number of individuals with the disease: $N_{D+} = TP + FN = 110 + 10 = 120$.\n- Total number of individuals without the disease: $N_{D-} = FP + TN = 15 + 85 = 100$.\n- Total number of individuals with a positive test: $N_{T+} = TP + FP = 110 + 15 = 125$.\n- Total number of individuals with a negative test: $N_{T-} = FN + TN = 10 + 85 = 95$.\n- Total number of patients in the study: $N = TP + FN + FP + TN = 110 + 10 + 15 + 85 = 220$.\n\nThe first step is to compute the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\n\n1.  **Sensitivity (Sens)** is the probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease, $P(T+|D+)$.\n    $$ \\text{Sens} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{110}{120} = \\frac{11}{12} $$\n\n2.  **Specificity (Spec)** is the probability of a negative test given that the patient does not have the disease, $P(T-|D-)$.\n    $$ \\text{Spec} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85 = \\frac{17}{20} $$\n\n3.  **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D+|T+)$.\n    $$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{110}{125} = \\frac{22}{25} = 0.88 $$\n\n4.  **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, $P(D-|T-)$.\n    $$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FN} = \\frac{85}{95} = \\frac{17}{19} $$\n\nThe next step is to derive the positive and negative likelihood ratios from sensitivity and specificity.\n\n5.  **Positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+)** is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual.

Since the test result is positive, we use the positive likelihood ratio (LR+):\n$$ \\text{Post-test odds} = \\text{Pre-test odds} \\times LR+ $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Post-test odds} = \\frac{7}{13} \\times \\frac{55}{9} = \\frac{385}{117} $$\n\nFinally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability.

            "solution": "**Task 1: Conceptual Basis of the $fT_{>\\text{MIC}}$ Target**\n\nThe problem states as a foundational basis that for time-dependent antibacterials like beta-lactams, the net bactericidal effect over a dosing interval, let's call it $E$, increases monotonically with the measure of time during which the free drug concentration at the infection site is above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). This measure is denoted $fT_{>\\text{MIC}}$. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as $E = g(fT_{>\\text{MIC}})$, where $g$ is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nThe term $fT_{>\\text{MIC}}$ is defined as the fraction of the dosing interval, $\\tau$, during which the free drug concentration at the infection site, $C_{\\text{ELF,free}}(t)$, exceeds the MIC. If we define $T_{>\\text{MIC}}$ as the total time within the interval $[0, \\tau]$ for which $C_{\\text{ELF,free}}(t) > \\text{MIC}$, then the definition is:\n$$fT_{>\\text{MIC}} = \\frac{T_{>\\text{MIC}}}{\\tau}$$\nThe clinical target is given as $fT_{>\\text{MIC}} \\ge 0.50$.

At steady state, under a dosing regimen with interval $\\tau$, the concentration profile over one interval $t \\in [0, \\tau]$ (where $t=0$ is the time of the dose) is determined by the peak ($C_{ss,max}$) and trough ($C_{ss,min}$) concentrations.\n\nThe trough concentration is the concentration remaining from all prior doses. The peak concentration is the sum of the trough concentration and the concentration from the new dose, $D/V_d$:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\nThe concentration decays over the interval, so the trough for the next interval is:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nSolving these two simultaneous equations for $C_{ss,max}$:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,max} \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\n$$C_{ss,max} (1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)) = \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\n$$C_{ss,max} = \\frac{D}{V_d(1 - \\exp(-k\\tau))}$$\nThe plasma concentration at any time $t$ within the steady-state dosing interval is:\n$$C_{ss}(t) = C_{ss,max} \\exp(-kt) = \\frac{D}{V_d(1 - \\exp(-k\\tau))} \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe free concentration in the ELF is given by $C_{\\text{ELF,free}}(t) = f_u r C_{ss}(t)$:\n$$C_{\\text{ELF,free}}(t) = \\frac{f_u r D}{V_d(1 - \\exp(-k\\tau))} \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe duration $T_{>\\text{MIC}}$ is the time for which $C_{\\text{ELF,free}}(t) > \\text{MIC}$. We find the time point $t_{cross}$ where the concentration equals MIC.
