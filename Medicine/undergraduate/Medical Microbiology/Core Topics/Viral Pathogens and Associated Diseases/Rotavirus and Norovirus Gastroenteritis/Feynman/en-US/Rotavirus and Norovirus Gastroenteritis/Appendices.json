            "introduction": "Why is it that during a widespread outbreak, some exposed individuals fall ill while others remain perfectly healthy? This practice explores the critical role of host genetics in determining susceptibility to viral infections. You will engage with the well-established principle that many common norovirus strains require specific cell-surface molecules, known as histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), to initiate infection, a trait controlled by the host's genetic makeup (secretor status). By working through this problem, you will learn how to apply this molecular-level understanding to predict population-level outcomes, such as the overall attack rate during an outbreak .",

            "problem": "A residential college experiences a point-source outbreak of acute gastroenteritis consistent with norovirus transmission. Norovirus strains that dominate such outbreaks commonly use histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) for attachment, and individuals with a functional fucosyltransferase 2 gene (secretor-positive phenotype) express HBGAs in mucosal secretions and are therefore biologically susceptible, whereas secretor-negative individuals are effectively non-susceptible for these strains. Assume a single shared exposure event occurred in a dining hall salad that was consumed by $200$ individuals. The secretor-positive prevalence in this population is $0.80$. Assume the per-susceptible attack rate (the probability that a susceptible individual becomes infected given exposure) for this event is $0.50$, and that secretor-negative individuals have zero risk in this outbreak due to strain specificity.\n\nStarting from the definition of attack rate as the proportion of exposed individuals who become infected, and using only the biological constraint that susceptibility is confined to the secretor-positive subgroup, derive an expression for the expected overall attack rate among all $200$ exposed individuals as a function of the secretor-positive fraction and the per-susceptible attack rate. Then compute its numerical value for the given parameters. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Total number of exposed individuals: $200$\n- Exposure type: Point-source outbreak from a single shared meal.\n- Biological constraint on susceptibility: Only individuals with a functional fucosyltransferase 2 gene (secretor-positive) are susceptible.\n- Secretor-negative individuals are non-susceptible.\n- Prevalence of the secretor-positive phenotype in the exposed population: $0.80$\n- Per-susceptible attack rate (probability of infection in a susceptible individual): $0.50$\n- Attack rate for secretor-negative individuals: $0$\n- Definition to use: Attack rate is the proportion of exposed individuals who become infected.\n- Required tasks:\n    1. Derive an expression for the expected overall attack rate as a function of the secretor-positive fraction and the per-susceptible attack rate.\n    2. Compute the numerical value for the given parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is scientifically sound. The link between the FUT2 gene, secretor status, and susceptibility to common strains of norovirus is a well-established principle in medical microbiology and virology. The given prevalence ($0.80$) is typical for populations of European descent, and the per-susceptible attack rate ($0.50$) is a realistic value for a high-risk exposure event.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters and a clear objective. A unique and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard epidemiological terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. There is no missing or contradictory information.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as being unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the overall attack rate based on fundamental principles. Let us define the relevant quantities symbolically.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of exposed individuals.\nLet $P_{sec+}$ be the proportion of the population that is secretor-positive (and thus susceptible).\nLet $P_{sec-}$ be the proportion of the population that is secretor-negative (and thus non-susceptible). By definition, $P_{sec+} + P_{sec-} = 1$.\nLet $AR_{susc}$ be the attack rate among susceptible individuals.\nLet $AR_{non-susc}$ be the attack rate among non-susceptible individuals.\nLet $AR_{overall}$ be the overall attack rate for the entire exposed population.\n\nThe total exposed population $N$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subgroups:\n1.  The number of susceptible (secretor-positive) individuals, $N_{susc}$, is given by the product of the total population size and the prevalence of susceptibility:\n    $$N_{susc} = N \\times P_{sec+}$$\n2.  The number of non-susceptible (secretor-negative) individuals, $N_{non-susc}$, is:\n    $$N_{non-susc} = N \\times P_{sec-} = N \\times (1 - P_{sec+})$$\n\nThe expected number of infected individuals within each subgroup is found by multiplying the number of individuals in that group by their respective attack rate.\n\nThe expected number of infected individuals in the susceptible group, $I_{susc}$, is:\n$$I_{susc} = N_{susc} \\times AR_{susc} = (N \\times P_{sec+}) \\times AR_{susc}$$\n\nThe expected number of infected individuals in the non-susceptible group, $I_{non-susc}$, is:\n$$I_{non-susc} = N_{non-susc} \\times AR_{non-susc} = (N \\times P_{sec-}) \\times AR_{non-susc}$$\n\nThe total expected number of infected individuals, $I_{total}$, is the sum of the infected individuals from both subgroups:\n$$I_{total} = I_{susc} + I_{non-susc}$$\n$$I_{total} = (N \\times P_{sec+} \\times AR_{susc}) + (N \\times P_{sec-} \\times AR_{non-susc})$$\n\nThe overall attack rate, $AR_{overall}$, is defined as the total number of infected individuals divided by the total number of exposed individuals:\n$$AR_{overall} = \\frac{I_{total}}{N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{total}$:\n$$AR_{overall} = \\frac{(N \\times P_{sec+} \\times AR_{susc}) + (N \\times P_{sec-} \\times AR_{non-susc})}{N}$$\n\nThe term $N$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the general expression for the overall attack rate as a weighted average of the subgroup-specific attack rates, where the weights are the proportions of the subgroups:\n$$AR_{overall} = (P_{sec+} \\times AR_{susc}) + (P_{sec-} \\times AR_{non-susc})$$\n\nThis derivation is an application of the law of total probability, where $P(\\text{Infected}) = P(\\text{Infected}|\\text{Susc})P(\\text{Susc}) + P(\\text{Infected}|\\text{Non-Susc})P(\\text{Non-Susc})$.\n\nThe problem states that secretor-negative individuals have zero risk, which means their attack rate is zero:\n$$AR_{non-susc} = 0$$\n\nSubstituting this into the general expression simplifies it to the specific expression required by the problem:\n$$AR_{overall} = (P_{sec+} \\times AR_{susc}) + (P_{sec-} \\times 0)$$\n$$AR_{overall} = P_{sec+} \\times AR_{susc}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the expected overall attack rate as a function of the secretor-positive fraction and the per-susceptible attack rate.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters:\n- Secretor-positive prevalence, $P_{sec+} = 0.80$\n- Per-susceptible attack rate, $AR_{susc} = 0.50$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$AR_{overall} = 0.80 \\times 0.50$$\n$$AR_{overall} = 0.40$$\n\nThe expected overall attack rate among all $200$ exposed individuals is $0.40$. This means we would expect $200 \\times 0.40 = 80$ individuals to become ill.",

            "introduction": "In modern clinical virology, simply detecting a virus is often not enough; quantifying the amount of virus—the viral load—is crucial for assessing disease severity and monitoring treatment. This exercise introduces the powerful diagnostic tool of quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and its underlying principle: the inverse logarithmic relationship between the starting number of viral genomes and the cycle threshold ($Ct$) value. This hands-on calculation will guide you through the entire process, from interpreting a standard curve to meticulously back-calculating through sample preparation steps, to determine the viral load in an original specimen . This is a fundamental skill for anyone working in a molecular diagnostics or research laboratory.",

            "problem": "A pediatric gastroenteritis stool specimen is tested for group A rotavirus and norovirus using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In qRT-PCR, polymerase chain reaction cycles ideally double the target each cycle, yielding an exponential amplification. Consequently, the cycle threshold $Ct$ (the cycle at which fluorescence crosses a fixed threshold) is inversely related to the logarithm of the initial template quantity, producing an approximately linear relationship between $Ct$ and $\\log_{10}$ of the input genome copies under stable assay efficiency.\n\nA validated standard curve for the assay establishes that $Ct=20$ corresponds to $10^{8}$ genome copies loaded in the reaction and $Ct=30$ corresponds to $10^{6}$ genome copies loaded in the reaction. A patient sample yields $Ct=25$.\n\nThe specimen was processed as follows: $m_{\\text{stool}}=0.50$ g of stool was homogenized in $V_{\\text{homog}}=4.0$ mL of phosphate-buffered saline. From the clarified homogenate, $V_{\\text{input}}=0.50$ mL was subjected to nucleic acid extraction that recovers a fraction $r=0.80$ of input genomes into an elution volume $V_{\\text{eluate}}=0.100$ mL. For the qRT-PCR, $V_{\\text{aliquot}}=5.0~\\mu\\text{L}$ of the eluate was added to a $20~\\mu\\text{L}$ reaction.\n\nAssuming uniform distribution of virus in the homogenate and no inhibition, use the standard curve to infer the number of viral genome copies in the reaction at $Ct=25$, then back-calculate to estimate the viral genome load in copies per gram of stool. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express the result in copies per gram.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the viral genome load in copies per gram of stool from a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) result. The solution involves two main parts: first, establishing the linear relationship of the standard curve to determine the number of viral genomes in the reaction tube; and second, performing a back-calculation through the multiple steps of sample processing to find the initial concentration in the stool specimen.\n\nFirst, we establish the equation for the standard curve. The problem states that the cycle threshold, $Ct$, is linearly related to the logarithm base $10$ of the initial genome copy number, $N$. The relationship can be expressed as:\n$$Ct = m \\cdot \\log_{10}(N) + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nWe are given two points on this line from the standard curve:\n1.  $Ct_1 = 20$ for $N_1 = 10^8$ genome copies. This gives the point $(\\log_{10}(N_1), Ct_1) = (8, 20)$.\n2.  $Ct_2 = 30$ for $N_2 = 10^6$ genome copies. This gives the point $(\\log_{10}(N_2), Ct_2) = (6, 30)$.\n\nThe slope $m$ of the line is calculated as:\n$$m = \\frac{Ct_2 - Ct_1}{\\log_{10}(N_2) - \\log_{10}(N_1)} = \\frac{30 - 20}{6 - 8} = \\frac{10}{-2} = -5$$\nThe negative slope indicates the inverse relationship between $Ct$ and the initial copy number, as expected.\n\nUsing the point-slope form with the first point $(8, 20)$, we can find the intercept $b$:\n$$Ct_1 = m \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_1) + b$$\n$$20 = (-5)(8) + b$$\n$$20 = -40 + b$$\n$$b = 60$$\nThus, the equation for the standard curve is:\n$$Ct = -5 \\log_{10}(N) + 60$$\n\nNext, we use this equation to find the number of genome copies, which we will denote as $N_{\\text{reaction}}$, in the patient sample's qRT-PCR reaction, which had a $Ct$ value of $25$.\n$$25 = -5 \\log_{10}(N_{\\text{reaction}}) + 60$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\log_{10}(N_{\\text{reaction}})$:\n$$5 \\log_{10}(N_{\\text{reaction}}) = 60 - 25$$\n$$5 \\log_{10}(N_{\\text{reaction}}) = 35$$\n$$\\log_{10}(N_{\\text{reaction}}) = \\frac{35}{5} = 7$$\nTherefore, the number of genome copies in the reaction is:\n$$N_{\\text{reaction}} = 10^7$$\n\nNow, we must back-calculate from this number to determine the viral load in the original stool sample, which we denote as $L$ in units of copies per gram. We will account for all dilution, concentration, and recovery steps. Let's trace the origin of the $10^7$ copies.\n\nThe $N_{\\text{reaction}}$ copies were contained in the aliquot volume $V_{\\text{aliquot}} = 5.0~\\mu\\text{L} = 0.0050$ mL that was taken from the nucleic acid eluate. The total volume of the eluate is $V_{\\text{eluate}} = 0.100$ mL. The concentration of genomes in the eluate, $C_{\\text{eluate}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{eluate}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{reaction}}}{V_{\\text{aliquot}}}$$\nThe total number of copies in the entire eluate, $N_{\\text{eluate}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{eluate}} = C_{\\text{eluate}} \\times V_{\\text{eluate}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{reaction}}}{V_{\\text{aliquot}}} \\times V_{\\text{eluate}} = \\frac{10^7 \\text{ copies}}{0.0050 \\text{ mL}} \\times 0.100 \\text{ mL} = 2.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ copies}$$\n\nThese $N_{\\text{eluate}}$ copies were recovered from the nucleic acid extraction process, which has a recovery efficiency of $r = 0.80$. Thus, the number of copies that went into the extraction, $N_{\\text{input}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{input}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{eluate}}}{r} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^8}{0.80} = 2.5 \\times 10^8 \\text{ copies}$$\n\nThese $N_{\\text{input}}$ copies were present in the volume $V_{\\text{input}} = 0.50$ mL of the clarified stool homogenate. The total volume of the stool homogenate is $V_{\\text{homog}} = 4.0$ mL. Assuming the virus is uniformly distributed, the total number of copies in the entire homogenate, $N_{\\text{homog}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{homog}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{input}}}{V_{\\text{input}}} \\times V_{\\text{homog}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^8 \\text{ copies}}{0.50 \\text{ mL}} \\times 4.0 \\text{ mL} = 2.0 \\times 10^9 \\text{ copies}$$\n\nFinally, these $N_{\\text{homog}}$ copies originated from the initial stool mass of $m_{\\text{stool}} = 0.50$ g. The viral load $L$ in copies per gram is therefore:\n$$L = \\frac{N_{\\text{homog}}}{m_{\\text{stool}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^9 \\text{ copies}}{0.50 \\text{ g}} = 4.0 \\times 10^9 \\text{ copies/g}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can construct a single equation for $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{N_{\\text{reaction}}}{V_{\\text{aliquot}}} \\times \\frac{V_{\\text{eluate}}}{r} \\times \\frac{V_{\\text{homog}}}{V_{\\text{input}}} \\times \\frac{1}{m_{\\text{stool}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values (with consistent units, e.g., mL):\n$$L = \\frac{10^7}{0.0050 \\text{ mL}} \\times \\frac{0.100 \\text{ mL}}{0.80} \\times \\frac{4.0 \\text{ mL}}{0.50 \\text{ mL}} \\times \\frac{1}{0.50 \\text{ g}}$$\n$$L = \\frac{10^7 \\times 0.100 \\times 4.0}{0.0050 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.50} \\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{g}}$$\n$$L = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^6}{0.001} \\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{g}} = 4.0 \\times 10^9 \\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\text{g}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to first derive a general expression for vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) in terms of relative risk ($RR$) from the fundamental definitions provided, and then to apply this expression to the given data.\n\nLet $R_{vac}$ be the risk of rotavirus-associated hospitalization in the vaccinated cohort, and let $R_{unvac}$ be the risk of the same outcome in the unvaccinated cohort. The problem states that cumulative incidence ($CI$) quantifies risk over the specified period. Therefore, we can write:\n$R_{vac} = CI_{vac}$\n$R_{unvac} = CI_{unvac}$\n\nThe problem defines vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) as the proportional reduction in risk in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. The risk in the unvaccinated group, $R_{unvac}$, serves as the baseline risk. The absolute reduction in risk due to vaccination is the difference $R_{unvac} - R_{vac}$. The proportional reduction is this difference divided by the baseline risk:\n$$ VE = \\frac{R_{unvac} - R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified:\n$$ VE = \\frac{R_{unvac}}{R_{unvac}} - \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nNext, we consider the definition of relative risk ($RR$). It is defined as the ratio of risk in the exposed group (here, the vaccinated cohort) to the risk in the unexposed group (the unvaccinated cohort):\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $RR$ into the simplified equation for $VE$, we arrive at the desired relationship between vaccine effectiveness and relative risk:\n$$ VE = 1 - RR $$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNow, we evaluate the vaccine effectiveness numerically using the data from the cohort study.\nThe given cumulative incidences are:\n- $CI_{vac} = 3$ per $1000 = \\frac{3}{1000} = 0.003$\n- $CI_{unvac} = 15$ per $1000 = \\frac{15}{1000} = 0.015$\n\nUsing these values as the risks for each group, we first calculate the relative risk ($RR$):\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} = \\frac{CI_{vac}}{CI_{unvac}} = \\frac{0.003}{0.015} $$\n$$ RR = \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\n\nFinally, we use the derived formula $VE = 1 - RR$ to calculate the vaccine effectiveness:\n$$ VE = 1 - 0.2 $$\n$$ VE = 0.8 $$\n\nThe vaccine effectiveness is $0.8$. This value represents an $80\\%$ reduction in the risk of rotavirus-associated hospitalization among the vaccinated children compared to the unvaccinated children. As per the problem's instructions, the final answer must be expressed as a decimal or fraction without a percentage sign. The value $0.8$ satisfies this requirement.",
