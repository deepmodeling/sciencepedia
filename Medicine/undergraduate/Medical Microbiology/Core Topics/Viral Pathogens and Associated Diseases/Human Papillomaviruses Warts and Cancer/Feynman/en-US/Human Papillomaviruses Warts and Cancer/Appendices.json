            "problem": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are classified into types primarily by sequence divergence in the late gene L1 open reading frame, which encodes the major capsid protein. In sequence-based taxonomy, a standard operational definition uses the uncorrected nucleotide divergence in a global alignment of the L1 coding sequence. Let a candidate sequence $c$ be compared to each sequence in a reference set of known types $\\{t_1,\\dots,t_n\\}$. For an alignment of length $L$ nucleotides between $c$ and $t_i$, let $m_i$ be the count of nucleotide mismatches, and define the uncorrected $p$-distance divergence as $d_i = m_i/L$. Let $d_{\\min} = \\min_i d_i$ be the smallest divergence to any known type. The classification threshold is $d^{\\ast} = 0.10$, meaning a candidate is considered a novel type if its L1 nucleotide divergence exceeds $0.10$ relative to all known types. \n\n(a) Starting from these definitions, construct an explicit decision rule as a numerical indicator function $I(d_{\\min},d^{\\ast})$ that outputs $1$ if the candidate is a novel type and $0$ otherwise, written only in terms of $d_{\\min}$ and $d^{\\ast}$.\n\n(b) A candidate L1 sequence of length $L = 1600$ nucleotides aligns to its nearest known type with $m = 200$ mismatches.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular systematics and virology, well-posed with all necessary definitions and data, and objective in its formulation. The problem provides a clear, formalizable task based on established operational definitions used in viral taxonomy.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem.\n\nPart (a): Construction of the decision rule.\nThe problem defines a candidate sequence as a novel type if its L1 nucleotide divergence exceeds $0.10$ relative to all known types. The variable $d_{\\min}$ is defined as the smallest divergence to any known type in the reference set $\\{t_1, \\dots, t_n\\}$. Therefore, the condition \"divergence exceeds $0.10$ relative to all known types\" is mathematically equivalent to the inequality $d_{\\min} > d^{\\ast}$, where $d^{\\ast} = 0.10$ is the classification threshold.\n\nWe are asked to construct a numerical indicator function, $I(d_{\\min}, d^{\\ast})$, that outputs $1$ if the candidate is a novel type and $0$ otherwise. Based on the condition derived above, this function can be defined as a piecewise function:\n$$I(d_{\\min}, d^{\\ast}) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } d_{\\min} > d^{\\ast} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } d_{\\min} \\le d^{\\ast} \\end{cases}$$\nThis function explicitly captures the decision rule described in the problem statement, mapping the input variables $d_{\\min}$ and $d^{\\ast}$ to the binary outcome of the classification.\n\nPart (b): Application of the decision rule.\nWe are given specific values for a candidate sequence:\nThe alignment length is $L = 1600$ nucleotides.\nThe number of mismatches to its nearest known type is $m = 200$.\nThe classification threshold is $d^{\\ast} = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem defines the uncorrected $p$-distance divergence as $d_i = m_i/L$. The value $d_{\\min}$ is the smallest such divergence, which corresponds to the alignment with the nearest known type. Therefore, we can calculate $d_{\\min}$ using the provided mismatch count $m$, which by definition corresponds to the minimum number of mismatches.\n$$d_{\\min} = \\frac{m}{L}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$d_{\\min} = \\frac{200}{1600} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$d_{\\min} = 0.125$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate the indicator function $I(d_{\\min}, d^{\\ast})$ using our calculated $d_{\\min}$ and the given $d^{\\ast}$.\nWe compare $d_{\\min} = 0.125$ to $d^{\\ast} = 0.10$.\nThe inequality $0.125 > 0.10$ is true.\n\nAccording to the definition of the indicator function from part (a), if $d_{\\min} > d^{\\ast}$, then $I(d_{\\min}, d^{\\ast}) = 1$.\nSince our calculated value $d_{\\min} = 0.125$ is indeed greater than the threshold $d^{\\ast} = 0.10$, the candidate sequence meets the criterion for being a novel type.\nTherefore, the value of the indicator function is:\n$$I(0.125, 0.10) = 1$$\nThis is the final value to be reported.",

            "introduction": "For a virus to cause persistent infection, it must ensure its genome is maintained within the host's proliferating cell populations. HPV masterfully achieves this by tethering its circular DNA, or episome, to the chromosomes of long-lived basal keratinocytes.

            "problem": "A basal keratinocyte layer infected by human papillomavirus (HPV) maintains the viral genome as an episome tethered to host chromatin. In the maintenance phase, each cell division leads, on average, to a constant multiplicative change in episome copy number per cell due to a balance of viral replication and partitioning, characterized by a per-division factor $c$ (with $c=1$ representing perfect maintenance, $c>1$ slight amplification, and $c<1$ gradual loss). Assume the basal keratinocytes divide every $7$ days, and that at time $t=0$ each infected basal cell contains $E_{0}=1$ episomal genome. Using only the assumptions that (i) the expected episome copy number per cell is multiplied by the same factor $c$ at each division and (ii) divisions occur synchronously in discrete steps, derive from first principles an expression for the expected episome copy number per cell after $n$ divisions.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a simplified but standard quantitative model of viral episome dynamics that is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the expected episome copy number per cell, denoted as $E_n$, after $n$ divisions. The derivation proceeds from first principles based on the provided assumptions.\n\nLet $E_n$ represent the expected episome copy number per cell after the $n$-th division.\nThe initial condition is given at time $t=0$, which corresponds to $n=0$ divisions. At this point, each infected basal cell contains an initial number of episomes $E_0$. The problem states that $E_0=1$.\n\nThe core assumption is that the expected episome copy number is multiplied by a constant factor $c$ at each division. This can be formulated as a recurrence relation:\n$$E_n = c \\cdot E_{n-1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1$$\n\nWe can derive the general expression for $E_n$ by expanding this relation iteratively, starting from the initial condition $E_0=1$:\n\nAfter the 1st division ($n=1$):\n$$E_1 = c \\cdot E_0 = c \\cdot 1 = c$$\n\nAfter the 2nd division ($n=2$):\n$$E_2 = c \\cdot E_1 = c \\cdot (c) = c^2$$\n\nAfter the 3rd division ($n=3$):\n$$E_3 = c \\cdot E_2 = c \\cdot (c^2) = c^3$$\n\nBy observing the pattern, we can infer by induction that the expected episome copy number after $n$ divisions is given by the general formula:\n$$E_n = c^n$$\nThis is the expression for the expected episome copy number per cell after $n$ divisions, derived from first principles.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the specific values provided: $c=1.5$ and $n=6$.\nWe express the factor $c$ as an exact fraction: $c = 1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula gives:\n$$E_6 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6$$\n\nTo find the exact numerical value, we compute the powers of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$3^6 = (3^3)^2 = 27^2 = 729$$\n$$2^6 = 64$$\n\nTherefore, the expected episome copy number after $6$ divisions is:\n$$E_6 = \\frac{729}{64}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $11.390625$. The fractional form is the required exact value.\n\nFinally, we interpret the biological significance of this result. The initial state is a single viral episome per basal cell ($E_0=1$). The parameter $c=1.5$ signifies that the viral genome is not just being maintained ($c=1$) but is actively amplified at each cell division. After $n=6$ divisions, which corresponds to a time period of $6 \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 42 \\text{ days}$, the expected number of episomes per basal cell has increased from $1$ to approximately $11.4$. This amplification is a critical feature of persistent HPV infection. It ensures that the virus establishes a stable reservoir of genomes within the long-lived basal keratinocyte population. This reservoir is essential for the long-term persistence of the virus in the host tissue and guarantees that as basal cells differentiate and migrate upwards, they carry a sufficient number of viral genomes to support the later stages of the viral life cycle, culminating in the production of new virions in the upper epithelial layers. Furthermore, a higher episome copy number increases the statistical probability of accidental integration of the viral DNA into the host genome, a rare but critical event that is a major step in HPV-induced carcinogenesis.",

            "problem": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) encodes the E6 protein, which recruits ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (E6-Associated Protein, E6-AP) to promote degradation of tumor protein p53. Consider a single-cell steady-state model in which p53 is synthesized at a constant rate and is degraded only when bound to E6. Assume the following foundational bases: the law of mass action for reversible binding, constant total E6, and a separation of timescales in which binding equilibrates rapidly compared to degradation and synthesis. Let $[\\text{p53}]$ be denoted by $p$, free E6 by $e$, the E6–p53 complex by $c$, and total E6 by $E_T$, with $E_T = e + c$. Assume a one-to-one binding equilibrium with dissociation constant $K_d$ given by $K_d = \\frac{e p}{c}$.

The differential equation for p53 concentration, $p$, at steady state ($\\frac{dp}{dt}=0$):\n    $$\n    \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}} - k_{\\text{deg}} c = 0 \\implies k_{\\text{syn}} = k_{\\text{deg}} c^{\\ast}\n    $$\n    where $k_{\\text{syn}}$ is the synthesis rate of p53, $k_{\\text{deg}}$ is the degradation rate constant of the E6-p53 complex, and $c^{\\ast}$ is the steady-state concentration of this complex.

The dissociation equilibrium for the E6-p53 complex, governed by the dissociation constant $K_d$:\n    $$\n    K_d = \\frac{e^{\\ast} p^{\\ast}}{c^{\\ast}}\n    $$\n    where $p^{\\ast}$ is the steady-state concentration of free p53.\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $p^{\\ast}$ in terms of the given parameters $k_{\\text{syn}}$, $k_{\\text{deg}}$, $E_T$, and $K_d$. We can achieve this by eliminating the intermediate variables $e^{\\ast}$ and $c^{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we express $c^{\\ast}$ as a function of $p^{\\ast}$, $E_T$, and $K_d$. From the conservation law ($2$), we have $e^{\\ast} = E_T - c^{\\ast}$. Substituting this into the equilibrium equation ($3$):\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{(E_T - c^{\\ast}) p^{\\ast}}{c^{\\ast}}\n$$\nWe solve for $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nK_d c^{\\ast} = E_T p^{\\ast} - c^{\\ast} p^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nc^{\\ast} (K_d + p^{\\ast}) = E_T p^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = \\frac{E_T p^{\\ast}}{K_d + p^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThis is a common biochemical expression for the concentration of a complex, analogous to the Michaelis-Menten formulation.\n\nNow we have two expressions for $c^{\\ast}$. By equating them (the one from the steady-state degradation, and the one from the binding equilibrium), we can find an equation for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{syn}}}{k_{\\text{deg}}} = \\frac{E_T p^{\\ast}}{K_d + p^{\\ast}}\n$$\nTo solve for $p^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nk_{\\text{syn}}(K_d + p^{\\ast}) = k_{\\text{deg}} E_T p^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{syn}} K_d + k_{\\text{syn}} p^{\\ast} = k_{\\text{deg}} E_T p^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{syn}} K_d = (k_{\\text{deg}} E_T - k_{\\text{syn}}) p^{\\ast}\n$$\nIsolating $p^{\\ast}$ yields the final analytical expression:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\text{syn}} K_d}{k_{\\text{deg}} E_T - k_{\\text{syn}}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for a physically meaningful steady state, which requires the maximum degradation rate, $k_{\\text{deg}} E_T$, to be greater than the synthesis rate, $k_{\\text{syn}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the new steady-state p53 concentration. The problem specifies the following parameter values after the perturbation:\n- Synthesis rate: $k_{\\text{syn}} = 2~\\text{nM/min}$\n- Dissociation constant: $K_d = 10~\\text{nM}$\n- Total E6 concentration: $E_T = 50~\\text{nM}$\n- New degradation rate constant: $k_{\\text{deg}} = 0.2~\\text{min}^{-1}$ (doubled from the initial $0.1~\\text{min}^{-1}$)\n\nWe substitute these numerical values into our derived formula for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{(2) \\cdot (10)}{(0.2) \\cdot (50) - 2}\n$$\nThe units are consistent, as shown by dimensional analysis: $\\frac{(\\text{nM/min}) \\cdot (\\text{nM})}{(\\text{min}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\text{nM}) - (\\text{nM/min})} = \\frac{\\text{nM}^2/\\text{min}}{\\text{nM/min}} = \\text{nM}$.\nWe proceed with the calculation:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{20}{10 - 2} = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5\n$$\nThe resulting concentration is $2.5~\\text{nM}$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures, so we write $2.500~\\text{nM}$.\n\nFinally, we provide a brief qualitative discussion of the biological implications. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a central regulator of cellular fate, capable of inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in response to oncogenic stress, such as viral infection or DNA damage. The activation of the apoptotic pathway is typically a threshold-dependent process, requiring p53 concentration to rise above a critical level. Our calculation demonstrates that increasing the catalytic efficiency ($k_{\\text{deg}}$) of the E6-mediated degradation machinery leads to a substantial decrease in the steady-state p53 concentration, $p^{\\ast}$, from an initial value of approximately $6.67~\\text{nM}$ to a new value of $2.5~\\text{nM}$. This reduction pushes the basal p53 level further below the apoptotic threshold. As a result, the HPV-infected cell becomes more resistant to undergoing apoptosis, enabling its survival and continued proliferation despite the presence of potentially carcinogenic viral oncoproteins. This abrogation of p53-mediated apoptosis is a cornerstone of HPV's oncogenic mechanism, facilitating the accumulation of genetic mutations and promoting malignant transformation.",
