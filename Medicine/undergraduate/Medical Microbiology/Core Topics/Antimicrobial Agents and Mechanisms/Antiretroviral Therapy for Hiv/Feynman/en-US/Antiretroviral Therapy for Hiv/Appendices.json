            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard pharmacodynamic model based on established principles of enzyme inhibition kinetics. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution.\n\n### Part (a): Derivation of the Expression for E(C)\n\nThe problem describes a single-site, monotonic, saturable pharmacodynamic relationship with a Hill coefficient of $1$. This corresponds to the standard $E_{max}$ model, which can be derived from the general Hill equation for an inhibitory effect $E$ as a function of drug concentration $C$.\n\nThe general form of the Hill equation for an effect that is zero at zero concentration ($E(0)=0$) is:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\nHere, $E_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum achievable effect, $n$ is the Hill coefficient describing the cooperativity of binding, and $K$ is the drug concentration that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect.\n\nThe problem specifies that the Hill coefficient is $1$. Substituting $n=1$ into the general Hill equation yields:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{K + C}$$\nThis functional form is characteristic of single-site, non-cooperative binding and is mathematically analogous to the Michaelis-Menten equation in enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe problem defines the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, $IC_{50}$, as the concentration at which the fractional inhibition is half of the maximum: $E(IC_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{max}}$. We can use this definition to relate the constant $K$ to the parameter $IC_{50}$.\nSubstituting $C=IC_{50}$ into our derived equation for $E(C)$:\n$$E(IC_{50}) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nEquating this with the definition provided in the problem:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{2} = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nAssuming $E_{\\text{max}} \\neq 0$ (which is necessary for a non-trivial effect), we can divide both sides by $E_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$K + IC_{50} = 2 \\cdot IC_{50}$$\n$$K = IC_{50}$$\nThis confirms that for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$, the constant $K$ in the equation is identical to the $IC_{50}$.\n\nBy substituting $K=IC_{50}$ back into the equation for $E(C)$, we obtain the final expression in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{IC_{50} + C}$$\nThis expression satisfies all the stated conditions:\n1.  If $C = 0$, then $E(0) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot 0}{IC_{50} + 0} = 0$.\n2.  As $C \\to \\infty$, $E(C) \\to \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{C} = E_{\\text{max}}$.\n3.

Thus, we write $0.75$ as $0.7500$.\n$$E = 0.7500$$",

            "introduction": "Once an effective drug concentration is achieved, its clinical impact unfolds over time as viral production is halted and existing virions are cleared from the plasma.

Empirically, during the early first-phase response, plasma viral RNA declines approximately according to first-order kinetics due to rapid clearance of productively infected cells and suppression of new infection events. Assume this early decay is well-modeled by the differential equation for first-order decay, where the plasma viral load $V(t)$ satisfies $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -k\\,V(t)$ with solution $V(t) = V_{0}\\exp(-k t)$, where $V_{0}$ is the baseline viral load at therapy initiation, $k$ is a constant decay rate (units $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$), and $t$ is time in days.\n\nFor a dolutegravir-based regimen, suppose the first-phase decay constant is $k = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.

The first-order decay model, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -k\\,V(t)$, is a standard and well-accepted approximation for the initial, rapid decline of plasma HIV-1 RNA following the initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy. The given decay constant, $k = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$, corresponds to a viral half-life of $\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} \\approx 0.99\\,\\mathrm{days}$, which is a clinically and biologically realistic value for the first-phase decay driven by the clearance of productively infected CD4+ T-cells. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided, and is mathematically well-posed. The terminology, such as \"$1~\\log_{10}$ reduction,\" is standard in virology. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem states that the decline in plasma viral load, $V(t)$, follows the first-order decay model:\n$$ V(t) = V_{0}\\exp(-k t) $$\nwhere $V_{0}$ is the initial viral load at time $t=0$, and $k$ is the decay rate constant.\n\nWe need to find the time $t$ required for the viral load to fall by $1~\\log_{10}$, which is explicitly defined as a ten-fold decrease from the baseline. This condition can be written as:\n$$ V(t) = \\frac{V_{0}}{10} $$\nTo find the specific time $t$ that satisfies this condition, we substitute this expression for $V(t)$ back into the model equation:\n$$ \\frac{V_{0}}{10} = V_{0}\\exp(-k t) $$\nSince the baseline viral load $V_{0}$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by $V_{0}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{10} = \\exp(-k t) $$\nTo solve for $t$, we can take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation. This is the inverse operation of the exponential function.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\exp(-k t)\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(e^x) = x$, the right side simplifies to $-k t$. Using the identity $\\ln(1/a) = -\\ln(a)$, the left side becomes $-\\ln(10)$. The equation is now:\n$$ -\\ln(10) = -k t $$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ yields:\n$$ \\ln(10) = k t $$\nNow, we can isolate $t$ by dividing by the decay constant $k$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k} $$\nThis is the general expression for the time to achieve a ten-fold reduction in a process governed by first-order kinetics.\n\nThe problem provides the value for the decay constant as $k = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$. Substituting this value into our expression for $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{0.7} $$\nThe units for time $t$ will be days, since $\\ln(10)$ is a dimensionless number and the units of $k$ are $\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$.\nUsing the value for the natural logarithm of $10$, which is approximately $2.302585$:\n$$ t \\approx \\frac{2.302585}{0.7}\\,\\mathrm{days} $$\n$$ t \\approx 3.28940727...\\,\\mathrm{days} $$\nThe problem requests the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3.289$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last digit.\n$$ t \\approx 3.289\\,\\mathrm{days} $$\nThus, it takes approximately $3.289$ days for the viral load to decrease by a factor of ten.",

            "problem": "A clinically stable adult with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is receiving oral lamivudine once daily at a maintenance dose of $300$ mg when their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is $90$ mL/min. Later, the patient’s eGFR declines to $30$ mL/min.

Express your final dose in milligrams and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, resting on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics. A solution can be derived through a systematic application of these principles.\n\nThe primary objective is to maintain the same average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$) of lamivudine despite a change in renal function. For a drug administered orally, the average steady-state concentration is defined by the equation:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\text{CL} \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability, $D$ is the dose, $\\text{CL}$ is the total clearance of the drug, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval.\n\nLet the initial state (baseline) be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state (with reduced renal function) be denoted by subscript $2$. The problem requires that $C_{\\text{ss,avg},1} = C_{\\text{ss,avg},2}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\frac{F_1 \\times D_1}{\\text{CL}_1 \\times \\tau_1} = \\frac{F_2 \\times D_2}{\\text{CL}_2 \\times \\tau_2}$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the bioavailability ($F$) and the dosing interval ($\\tau$) are unchanged. Thus, $F_1 = F_2$ and $\\tau_1 = \\tau_2$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{D_1}{\\text{CL}_1} = \\frac{D_2}{\\text{CL}_2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the new dose, $D_2$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$$\nThis shows that the new dose is the original dose adjusted by the ratio of the new total clearance to the original total clearance. Our task now is to determine this ratio.\n\nTotal clearance ($\\text{CL}$) is the sum of renal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal}}$) and non-renal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal}}$):\n$$\\text{CL} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal}} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal}}$$\n\nAt baseline (state $1$), the estimated glomerular filtration rate is $\\text{eGFR}_1 = 90$ mL/min. The fraction of total clearance that is renal is given as $f_{\\text{renal},1} = 0.7$.\nTherefore, the components of the baseline total clearance, $\\text{CL}_1$, can be expressed as:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1} = f_{\\text{renal},1} \\times \\text{CL}_1 = 0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},1} = (1 - f_{\\text{renal},1}) \\times \\text{CL}_1 = (1 - 0.7) \\times \\text{CL}_1 = 0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n\nNext, we consider the final state (state $2$), where the eGFR has declined to $\\text{eGFR}_2 = 30$ mL/min.\nThe problem states that non-renal clearance remains constant, so:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},2} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},1} = 0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n\nIt is also stated that renal clearance is directly proportional to eGFR. This implies that the ratio of renal clearances is equal to the ratio of the eGFR values:\n$$\\frac{\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2}}{\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1}} = \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_2}{\\text{eGFR}_1}$$\nWe can now calculate the new renal clearance, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2}$:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1} \\times \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_2}{\\text{eGFR}_1} = (0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1) \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ mL/min}}{90 \\text{ mL/min}} = (0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1) \\times \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nNow we can compute the new total clearance, $\\text{CL}_2$, by summing its renal and non-renal components:\n$$\\text{CL}_2 = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},2} = \\left(0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1)$$\nFactoring out $\\text{CL}_1$:\n$$\\text{CL}_2 = \\text{CL}_1 \\left( \\frac{0.7}{3} + 0.3 \\right)$$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1} = \\frac{0.7}{3} + 0.3 = \\frac{7}{30} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{30} + \\frac{9}{30} = \\frac{16}{30} = \\frac{8}{15}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this ratio back into the equation for the new dose, $D_2$. The initial dose is $D_1 = 300$ mg.\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1} = 300 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{8}{15}$$\n$$D_2 = \\frac{300 \\times 8}{15} \\text{ mg} = 20 \\times 8 \\text{ mg} = 160 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe result of the calculation is exactly $160$ mg. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to three significant figures. To unambiguously represent $160$ with three significant figures, scientific notation is appropriate, which is $1.60 \\times 10^2$.",
