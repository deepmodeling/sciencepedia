However, microbes have evolved diverse strategies for this first critical step. This exercise invites you to compare two major glycolytic pathways: the familiar Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway and the alternative Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway.

            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory compares glycolytic energy conservation by two facultative pathogens grown anaerobically on a defined minimal medium with $1$ mole of glucose as the sole carbon and energy source. Isolate $\\mathrm{A}$ (an enteric bacterium) uses the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway, while isolate $\\mathrm{B}$ (an opportunistic nonfermenter) uses the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. Assume that energy conservation is restricted to glycolysis-level substrate-level phosphorylation only; ignore any contribution from electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, or subsequent fermentative steps that reoxidize reduced cofactors. Use the following well-established biochemical facts as the fundamental base for your derivation:\n\n- In the EMP pathway of one mole of glucose, an initial “investment phase” phosphorylates glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate (hexokinase or glucokinase) and fructose-$6$-phosphate to fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate (phosphofructokinase), each consuming $1$ mole of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate is cleaved to two moles of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate. Each glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate is oxidized to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate with reduction of one mole of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced form NADH. Subsequent substrate-level phosphorylation steps yield ATP at the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase reactions per glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate processed.\n\n- In the ED pathway of one mole of glucose, an initial phosphorylation converts glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate, consuming $1$ mole of ATP. Glucose-$6$-phosphate is oxidized to $6$-phosphogluconate and dehydrated to $2$-keto-$3$-deoxy-$6$-phosphogluconate (KDPG). The oxidation step reduces one mole of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to its reduced form NADPH. KDPG is then cleaved into one mole of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate and one mole of pyruvate; the glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate continues through the same “payoff phase” reactions as in EMP, generating one mole of NADH at the glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase step and substrate-level ATP at the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase reactions.\n\nDerive, from these facts and conservative stoichiometric accounting, the net ATP yield per mole of glucose for the EMP pathway and for the ED pathway, and determine the number of moles of NADH produced during glycolysis for each pathway. Then, justify mechanistically why the NADH production differs between EMP and ED in the glycolytic stage, making explicit reference to branch points and cofactor specificity. Report your final numerical results in the order $\\big[$EMP net ATP, ED net ATP, EMP NADH, ED NADH$\\big]$. Provide exact integer counts; no rounding is required, and no units should be included in the final reported values.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a set of established biochemical facts concerning the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) and Entner–Doudoroff (ED) glycolytic pathways and requests a stoichiometric derivation of net adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) yields under specified conditions. The problem is valid and solvable. The solution will proceed by analyzing each pathway separately based on the provided information.\n\n**Analysis of the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) Pathway (Isolate A)**\n\nThe EMP pathway converts one mole of glucose into two moles of pyruvate. The process involves an initial energy investment phase followed by an energy payoff phase. The net energy yield is calculated by summing the ATP consumed and produced.\n\n1.  **ATP Stoichiometry:**\n    *   **Investment Phase:** As stated, this phase consumes ATP at two steps. First, the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate by hexokinase/glucokinase consumes $1$ mole of ATP. Second, the phosphorylation of fructose-$6$-phosphate to fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase consumes another $1$ mole of ATP.\n        $$ \\text{ATP}_{\\text{invested, EMP}} = 1 \\, (\\text{hexokinase}) + 1 \\, (\\text{phosphofructokinase}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles ATP} $$\n    *   **Payoff Phase:** The fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate ($C_6$) is cleaved into two moles of three-carbon molecules ($C_3$), specifically glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (which is subsequently isomerized to G3P). Therefore, $1$ mole of glucose yields $2$ moles of G3P that enter the payoff phase.\n        For each mole of G3P, substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) occurs at two distinct enzymatic steps:\n        a.  Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, yielding $1$ mole of ATP.\n        b.  Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, yielding another $1$ mole of ATP.\n        Thus, the metabolism of one mole of G3P generates $2$ moles of ATP. Since $1$ mole of glucose produces $2$ moles of G3P, the total ATP generated in the payoff phase is:\n        $$ \\text{ATP}_{\\text{produced, EMP}} = 2 \\, (\\text{moles G3P per mole glucose}) \\times 2 \\, (\\text{moles ATP per mole G3P}) = 4 \\, \\text{moles ATP} $$\n    *   **Net ATP Yield:** The net yield is the amount produced minus the amount invested.\n        $$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{EMP}} = \\text{ATP}_{\\text{produced, EMP}} - \\text{ATP}_{\\text{invested, EMP}} = 4 - 2 = 2 \\, \\text{moles ATP} $$\n\n2.  **NADH Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The problem states that each mole of G3P is oxidized to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate. This oxidation is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and is coupled to the reduction of one mole of NAD$^+$ to NADH.\n    *   Since $1$ mole of glucose yields $2$ moles of G3P, the total production of NADH is:\n        $$ \\text{NADH}_{\\text{produced, EMP}} = 2 \\, (\\text{moles G3P per mole glucose}) \\times 1 \\, (\\text{mole NADH per mole G3P}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles NADH} $$\n\n**Analysis of the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) Pathway (Isolate B)**\n\nThe ED pathway represents an alternative route for glucose catabolism.\n\n1.  **ATP Stoichiometry:**\n    *   **Investment Phase:** The problem describes an initial phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate, which consumes $1$ mole of ATP. Unlike the EMP pathway, there is no second phosphorylation by phosphofructokinase.\n        $$ \\text{ATP}_{\\text{invested, ED}} = 1 \\, \\text{mole ATP} $$\n    *   **Payoff Phase:** The key divergence occurs when $2$-keto-$3$-deoxy-$6$-phosphogluconate (KDPG) is cleaved by KDPG aldolase. This cleavage yields $1$ mole of pyruvate and $1$ mole of G3P. Only the single mole of G3P proceeds through the common payoff reactions (PGK and PK), identical to the latter half of the EMP pathway. The pyruvate produced at this stage is already at the final step of glycolysis and does not generate further ATP via SLP.\n    *   The metabolism of this single mole of G3P generates ATP at the PGK and PK steps.\n        $$ \\text{ATP}_{\\text{produced, ED}} = 1 \\, (\\text{mole G3P per mole glucose}) \\times 2 \\, (\\text{moles ATP per mole G3P}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles ATP} $$\n    *   **Net ATP Yield:** The net yield is the amount produced minus the amount invested.\n        $$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{ED}} = \\text{ATP}_{\\text{produced, ED}} - \\text{ATP}_{\\text{invested, ED}} = 2 - 1 = 1 \\, \\text{mole ATP} $$\n\n2.  **NADH Stoichiometry:**\n    *   In the ED pathway, two distinct oxidative steps occur.\n        a.  The conversion of glucose-$6$-phosphate to $6$-phosphogluconate reduces $1$ mole of NADP$^+$ to NADPH.\n        b.  The subsequent oxidation of the single mole of G3P (from KDPG cleavage) to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate is catalyzed by GAPDH and reduces $1$ mole of NAD$^+$ to NADH.\n    *   The problem specifically asks for the yield of NADH. Therefore, based on the provided facts, the ED pathway produces:\n        $$ \\text{NADH}_{\\text{produced, ED}} = 1 \\, (\\text{mole G3P per mole glucose}) \\times 1 \\, (\\text{mole NADH per mole G3P}) = 1 \\, \\text{mole NADH} $$\n    *   It is important to note that the ED pathway also produces $1$ mole of NADPH, a distinct reduced cofactor.\n\n**Mechanistic Justification for the Difference in NADH Production**\n\nThe difference in NADH yield between the EMP ($2$ moles) and ED ($1$ mole) pathways is a direct consequence of the fundamentally different strategies used to cleave the $C_6$ glucose backbone.\n\n*   In the **EMP pathway**, the $C_6$ intermediate, fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate, is symmetric in its phosphorylation. The enzyme aldolase cleaves it into two interconvertible $C_3$ isomers (G3P and DHAP). This results in **two** molecules of G3P entering the oxidative step catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Since GAPDH is specific for NAD$^+$ as its electron acceptor, this step occurs twice per glucose, producing **two** molecules of NADH.\n    $$ \\text{Fructose-}1,6\\text{-bisphosphate} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Aldolase}} \\text{G3P} + \\text{DHAP} \\rightleftharpoons 2 \\times \\text{G3P} $$\n    $$ 2 \\times \\text{G3P} + 2 \\, \\text{NAD}^+ + 2 \\, P_i \\xrightarrow{\\text{GAPDH}} 2 \\times 1,3\\text{-BPG} + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, \\text{H}^+ $$\n\n*   In the **ED pathway**, the cleavage occurs on the asymmetric $C_6$ intermediate, $2$-keto-$3$-deoxy-$6$-phosphogluconate (KDPG). The KDPG aldolase cleaves this molecule into two distinct, non-interconvertible $C_3$ products: one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of G3P.\n    $$ \\text{KDPG} \\xrightarrow{\\text{KDPG Aldolase}} \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{G3P} $$\n    Consequently, only **one** molecule of G3P enters the GAPDH-catalyzed oxidative step. This single event produces only **one** molecule of NADH. The other product, pyruvate, is the final product of glycolysis and does not undergo further oxidation by GAPDH. The first oxidative step in the ED pathway (glucose-$6$-phosphate dehydrogenase) uses NADP$^+$ as a cofactor, not NAD$^+$, thus contributing to the NADPH pool, not the NADH pool.\n\nIn summary, the stoichiometry of NADH production is dictated by the number of G3P molecules generated upstream of GAPDH. The EMP pathway's symmetric cleavage yields two G3P, while the ED pathway's asymmetric cleavage yields only one G3P, accounting for the $2:1$ difference in NADH yield.\n\n**Final Summary of Results:**\n-   EMP Net ATP Yield: $2$\n-   ED Net ATP Yield: $1$\n-   EMP NADH Yield: $2$\n-   ED NADH Yield: $1$\nThe requested numerical results in the order $\\big[$EMP net ATP, ED net ATP, EMP NADH, ED NADH$\\big]$ are $\\big[2, 1, 2, 1\\big]$.",

Partitioning of Pyruvate**\nThe $2$ moles of pyruvate are partitioned into three branches according to the given fractions $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n- Moles of pyruvate to ethanol branch: $2 \\times x = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$ mol.\n- Moles of pyruvate to lactate branch: $2 \\times y = 2 \\times 0.50 = 1.0$ mol.\n- Moles of pyruvate to acetate branch: $2 \\times z = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$ mol.\nThe sum is $0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 2.0$ moles of pyruvate, accounting for all pyruvate produced.\n\n**3.

This quantity is a ratio, which we can denote as $\\frac{N_{\\text{ATP}}}{N_{\\text{O}_2}}$, where $N$ represents the number of molecules of each species. To derive this ratio, we will use the provided stoichiometric values in a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of chemiosmosis.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of electrons ($e^-$) that are transferred to a single molecule of $\\text{O}_2$, which serves as the terminal electron acceptor. The problem states that one molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ accepts $4e^-$. This gives the first conversion factor:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{4 \\, e^-}{1 \\, \\text{O}_2} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the number of protons ($\\text{H}^+$) pumped across the membrane by the respiratory chain. The problem specifies that $10$ $\\text{H}^+$ are pumped for every $2e^-$ that pass through the chain. This provides a second conversion factor, which can be simplified:\n$$ R_2 = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{H}^+}{2 \\, e^-} = \\frac{5 \\, \\text{H}^+}{1 \\, e^-} $$\nThis ratio signifies that for each electron transferred, $5$ protons are pumped.\n\nUsing these two relationships, we can calculate the total number of protons pumped as a result of the reduction of a single molecule of $\\text{O}_2$. This is achieved by multiplying the number of electrons per $\\text{O}_2$ molecule by the number of protons pumped per electron:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{H}^+}^{\\text{pumped}}}{N_{\\text{O}_2}} = R_1 \\times R_2 = \\left( \\frac{4 \\, e^-}{1 \\, \\text{O}_2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{5 \\, \\text{H}^+}{1 \\, e^-} \\right) = \\frac{20 \\, \\text{H}^+}{1 \\, \\text{O}_2} $$\nTherefore, the complete reduction of one molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ drives the pumping of $20$ protons across the membrane.\n\nThird, we relate the number of pumped protons to the number of ATP molecules synthesized. The problem states that the ATP synthase requires $3.3$ protons to be translocated back across the membrane for each molecule of ATP synthesized. This gives the final conversion factor:\n$$ R_3 = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{ATP}}{3.3 \\, \\text{H}^+} $$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of ATP molecules synthesized per molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ consumed. This is found by multiplying the total number of protons pumped per $\\text{O}_2$ by the number of ATP molecules synthesized per proton:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{ATP}}}{N_{\\text{O}_2}} = \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{H}^+}^{\\text{pumped}}}{N_{\\text{O}_2}} \\right) \\times R_3 = \\left( \\frac{20 \\, \\text{H}^+}{1 \\, \\text{O}_2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\, \\text{ATP}}{3.3 \\, \\text{H}^+} \\right) = \\frac{20}{3.3} \\, \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{O}_2} $$\n\nWe now perform the numerical calculation for this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{20}{3.3} \\approx 6.060606... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $6$, $0$, and $6$. The subsequent digit is $0$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last significant digit. Thus, the theoretical maximum yield is $6.06$ molecules of ATP per molecule of $\\text{O}_2$.",
