            "problem": "A virology laboratory performs a synchronized infection experiment on a monolayer of mammalian cells using a non-enveloped, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus to study early replication events. Under standard plaque assay conditions, the adsorption of infectious virions to cells is well-approximated by a Poisson process: if the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is $m$, then the probability that a randomly selected cell receives exactly $k$ infectious units is given by the Poisson distribution $P(k)=\\exp(-m)\\frac{m^{k}}{k!}$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity before attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The system involves a synchronized infection of mammalian cells with a non-enveloped, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus.\n- The adsorption of virions follows a Poisson process.\n- The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is denoted by $m$.\n- The probability that a cell receives exactly $k$ infectious units is given by the Poisson probability mass function: $P(k) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{m^k}{k!}$.\n- $k$ is a nonnegative integer.\n- Assumptions: large, well-mixed population; independent adsorption events; negligible superinfection exclusion.\n- The tasks are:\n    1. Derive the general expression for the fraction of cells infected at least once, in terms of $m$.\n    2. Compute this fraction for $m=2$.\n    3. Justify the effect of increasing $m$ on the synchrony of infection initiation.\n- The final numerical answer must be an exact analytical expression.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The use of the Poisson distribution to model the number of viral particles infecting a cell given a certain MOI is a standard and fundamental concept in quantitative virology. The underlying assumptions are appropriate for this model. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive the requested quantities. The terminology is precise and objective. The questions are logically constructed and address core principles of viral infection kinetics. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct but related components: a general derivation, a specific calculation, and a qualitative justification.\n\n**1. General expression for the fraction of infected cells**\n\nThe fraction of cells that are infected corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected cell from the population has been infected by at least one infectious viral particle. According to the problem statement, the number of infectious units, $k$, that adsorb to a cell follows a Poisson distribution with mean $m$:\n$$P(k) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{m^k}{k!}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nA cell is considered \"infected\" if it receives one or more infectious units, which corresponds to the event $k \\geq 1$. The fraction of infected cells is therefore $P(k \\geq 1)$.\n\nIt is most straightforward to calculate this probability by considering the complementary event: a cell is *not* infected. A cell is not infected if and only if it receives exactly zero infectious units, which corresponds to the event $k=0$. The probability of this event is $P(k=0)$.\n\nUsing the given Poisson formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(k=0) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{m^0}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $m^0 = 1$), and the factorial of $0$ is also $1$ (i.e., $0! = 1$). Substituting these values gives:\n$$P(k=0) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{1}{1} = \\exp(-m)$$\nThis expression, $P(0)$, represents the fraction of cells that remain uninfected.\n\nSince the set of all possible outcomes is that a cell is either uninfected ($k=0$) or infected ($k \\geq 1$), the sum of their probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P(k=0) + P(k \\geq 1) = 1$$\nTherefore, the fraction of cells that are infected, $P(k \\geq 1)$, is given by:\n$$P(k \\geq 1) = 1 - P(k=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(k=0)$, we arrive at the general expression for the fraction of infected cells in terms of the MOI, $m$:\n$$P(\\text{infected}) = 1 - \\exp(-m)$$\n\n**2. Calculation for an MOI of $m=2$**\n\nTo find the fraction of infected cells for an experiment conducted at an MOI of $m=2$, we substitute $m=2$ into the general expression derived above:\n$$P(\\text{infected}) \\rvert_{m=2} = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the fraction.\n\n**3. Effect of increasing MOI on infection synchrony**\n\n\"Synchrony of infection initiation\" refers to the degree to which individual infected cells in a population begin the viral replication process at the same time. For a non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus, the first major step of replication post-entry is the translation of the viral genomic RNA by the host cell's ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nThe initiation of this process is a stochastic event. If a cell is infected with a single virion ($k=1$), the time until the first successful translation event occurs is governed by a certain probability distribution. If a cell is infected with multiple virions ($k>1$), there are $k$ independent viral genomes, each with a chance to initiate replication. The time to the *first* successful event in the cell is the minimum of $k$ independent, identically distributed random time variables. Statistically, the expected time for the first event to occur decreases as $k$ increases.\n\nNow, consider the effect of the MOI, $m$, on the entire cell population.\n- At a **low MOI** (e.g., $m \\ll 1$), the fraction of infected cells is low ($1-\\exp(-m) \\approx m$). Among the infected cells, the vast majority are infected by only a single particle ($k=1$), since $P(k=1) \\approx m\\exp(-m)$ and $P(k=2) \\approx \\frac{m^2}{2}\\exp(-m)$, making $P(k=2) \\ll P(k=1)$. Because most infected cells contain only one viral genome, the initiation of replication across the population will be relatively synchronous, with variance determined primarily by the intrinsic stochasticity of a single genome initiating replication.\n- At a **high MOI** (e.g., $m > 1$), the fraction of uninfected cells, $\\exp(-m)$, is small, and cells are infected with a wide range of particle numbers, $k$, described by the Poisson distribution. For example, at $m=5$, cells will be infected with a distribution of particles centered around $k=5$. There will be significant populations of cells with $k=3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, etc.\n\nThis heterogeneity in the number of infecting particles per cell ($k$) across the population is the key to asynchrony. A cell infected with $k=10$ particles will, on average, begin replication sooner than a cell infected with $k=2$ particles. Because a high MOI creates a population of infected cells with a broad distribution of $k$ values, it also creates a broad distribution of replication initiation times. The time window between the earliest-starting cell (likely one with a large $k$) and the latest-starting cell (likely one with a small $k$) widens.\n\nTherefore, from first principles, **increasing the MOI ($m$) decreases the synchrony of infection initiation** across the population of infected cells. While the average infection might appear to start faster, the range of start times becomes larger, resulting in a more asynchronous infection process.",

This exercise puts you in the role of an experimental virologist, tasking you with analyzing data from such an experiment. You will apply the concept of MOI to determine the number of initially infected cells and then use measurements of viral progeny to calculate the average burst size, a critical measure of viral fitness .",

            "problem": "A one-step growth experiment is performed with a strictly lytic bacteriophage infecting an actively growing culture of Escherichia coli. The culture volume is $1.00$ mL. The host cell density at the start of adsorption is $N_{0} = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ cells per mL. Phage are added at an applied multiplicity of infection (MOI) of $m_{\\text{app}} = 0.40$ and allowed to adsorb for $5.0$ min at $37$ degrees Celsius. Immediately before the wash step, the concentration of unadsorbed plaque-forming units (PFU) measured in the supernatant is $2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ PFU per mL. The culture is then rapidly diluted $1000$-fold into prewarmed medium to prevent further adsorption and centrifuged to remove unadsorbed virions; the residual extracellular PFU in the culture immediately after this wash at $t = 0^{+}$ is measured as $1.5 \\times 10^{5}$ PFU per mL. At $t = 60$ min post-adsorption, when lysis is complete for this system, the extracellular PFU concentration in the culture is $1.90 \\times 10^{8}$ PFU per mL.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts and definitions to derive the quantity requested. First, plaque-forming units (PFU) approximate the number of infectious virions in a sample. Second, adsorption events to individual cells are well-modeled as independent Poisson processes with mean $m$ equal to the average number of adsorbed virions per cell, so that the fraction of cells that are infected by at least one virion is $1 - \\exp(-m)$. Third, in a synchronized one-step growth, infected cells that complete the lytic cycle release their progeny at approximately the same time, and the high dilution prevents secondary infection before lysis.\n\nAssume that each cell infected with at least one virion produces the same number of infectious progeny that are released at lysis, and that the $t = 60$ min measurement captures the extracellular infectious progeny produced by the first lytic cycle without significant loss. Using the provided data and these foundational facts, determine the average burst size, defined as the mean number of infectious virions released per infected cell at lysis. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the burst size as a pure number (no units).",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the average burst size, denoted by $B$. The burst size is defined as the mean number of infectious virions, measured as plaque-forming units (PFU), released per infected cell upon lysis. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$B = \\frac{\\text{Total PFU released}}{\\text{Number of infected cells that lyse}}$$\nSince all data are provided as concentrations (per mL), we can work with concentrations, as the volume term would cancel out:\n$$B = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of PFU released}}{\\text{Concentration of infected cells that lyse}}$$\nLet's denote the concentration of newly released PFU as $\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}$ and the concentration of infected cells as $N_{\\text{inf}}$. The expression for the burst size becomes:\n$$B = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}}{N_{\\text{inf}}}$$\n\nThe solution is a two-part calculation: first, determining the concentration of infected cells ($N_{\\text{inf}}$), and second, determining the concentration of progeny virions released at lysis ($\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}$).\n\n1.  **Determination of the concentration of infected cells ($N_{\\text{inf}}$)**\n\nThe concentration of infected cells is calculated using the Poisson distribution model for phage adsorption. This model requires the *actual* multiplicity of infection ($m$), which is the average number of phage particles that have adsorbed per cell, not the *applied* multiplicity of infection ($m_{\\text{app}}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial concentration of phage added to the culture, $P_{\\text{applied}}$. This is the product of the initial host cell density, $N_0$, and the applied MOI, $m_{\\text{app}}$.\nGiven:\n-   Initial cell density, $N_0 = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ cells/mL.\n-   Applied MOI, $m_{\\text{app}} = 0.40$.\n\n$$P_{\\text{applied}} = m_{\\text{app}} \\times N_0 = 0.40 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ PFU/mL}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ PFU/mL}$$\n\nNext, we find the concentration of phage particles that successfully adsorbed to the cells, $P_{\\text{ads}}$. This is the difference between the applied phage concentration and the concentration of unadsorbed phage, $P_{\\text{unads}}$, measured in the supernatant before the wash step.\nGiven:\n-   Unadsorbed PFU concentration, $P_{\\text{unads}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ PFU/mL.\n\n$$P_{\\text{ads}} = P_{\\text{applied}} - P_{\\text{unads}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ PFU/mL}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ PFU/mL})$$\n$$P_{\\text{ads}} = (10.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ PFU/mL}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ PFU/mL}) = 8.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ PFU/mL}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the actual multiplicity of infection, $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{P_{\\text{ads}}}{N_0} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ PFU/mL}}{2.5 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ cells/mL}} = 0.32$$\n\nAccording to the provided Poisson model, the probability of a cell not being infected (i.e., adsorbing $k=0$ virions) is $P(0) = \\exp(-m)$. The fraction of cells infected by at least one virion is therefore $1 - P(0) = 1 - \\exp(-m)$. The concentration of infected cells, $N_{\\text{inf}}$, is this fraction multiplied by the initial cell concentration $N_0$:\n$$N_{\\text{inf}} = N_0 \\times (1 - \\exp(-m)) = (2.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.32))$$\n\n2.  **Determination of the concentration of newly released PFU ($\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}$)**\n\nThe concentration of progeny virions released at lysis is the increase in PFU concentration from the baseline level during the latent period to the final plateau concentration after lysis is complete. The problem provides the final PFU concentration at $t=60$ min, $P_{60}$, and the residual extracellular PFU concentration after the wash at $t=0^{+}$, $P_{\\text{res}}$. This residual concentration $P_{\\text{res}}$ represents the baseline.\nGiven:\n-   Final PFU concentration, $P_{60} = 1.90 \\times 10^{8}$ PFU/mL.\n-   Residual extracellular PFU concentration, $P_{\\text{res}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{5}$ PFU/mL.\n\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{new}} = P_{60} - P_{\\text{res}} = (1.90 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ PFU/mL}) - (1.5 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ PFU/mL})$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we express both values in the same power of $10$:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{new}} = (1.90 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ PFU/mL}) - (0.0015 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ PFU/mL}) = 1.8985 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ PFU/mL}$$\n\n3.  **Calculation of the average burst size ($B$)**\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $N_{\\text{inf}}$ and $\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}$ into the equation for the burst size $B$.\n$$B = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{new}}}{N_{\\text{inf}}} = \\frac{1.8985 \\times 10^{8}}{(2.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.32))}$$\nWe can simplify the expression:\n$$B = \\frac{1.8985 \\times 10^{1}}{2.5 \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.32))} = \\frac{18.985}{2.5 \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.32))} = \\frac{7.594}{1 - \\exp(-0.32)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$1 - \\exp(-0.32) \\approx 1 - 0.726149037 = 0.273850963$$\n$$B \\approx \\frac{7.594}{0.273850963} \\approx 27.730305$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$B \\approx 27.73$$\nThe average burst size is approximately $27.73$ new infectious virions per infected cell.",

            "problem": "A single cell is co-infected by two strains, $A$ and $B$, of a segmented Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) virus. Each strain carries a complete genome consisting of $n$ distinct segments, where each virion must package exactly one copy of each segment to be infectious. In segmented RNA viruses, genetic exchange proceeds by reassortment: progeny virions assemble segment-by-segment from the available intracellular pool, potentially mixing parental origins segmentwise. In non-segmented RNA viruses, genetic exchange proceeds by homologous recombination within a single continuous RNA, yielding chimeric sequences within a segment rather than whole-segment swaps. Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base: (i) each of the $n$ segments is functionally required and nonredundant, (ii) packaging fidelity enforces exactly one copy of each segment per virion, (iii) when two strains co-infect, each segment position is filled independently from either the $A$-derived or $B$-derived version, provided all combinations are compatible, and (iv) there is no intra-segment recombination and no segment duplication or loss in the progeny considered.\n\nUsing only these principles, first justify mechanistically why non-segmented RNA viruses rely on recombination whereas segmented RNA viruses enable reassortment, and then derive a closed-form expression for the total number of distinct progeny genotypes that can be produced by reassortment in this co-infection, counting the two parental genotypes alongside all mixed parental-origin constellations. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $n$. No numerical substitution is required. Do not include units. The final answer must be a single expression only, not an equation or inequality, and not a list.",
            "solution": "The problem statement poses two tasks: first, to provide a mechanistic justification for why segmented and non-segmented RNA viruses utilize different primary modes of genetic exchange (reassortment and recombination, respectively), and second, to derive a closed-form expression for the total number of distinct progeny genotypes produced by reassortment in a co-infection scenario. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to proceed with a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n**Part 1: Mechanistic Justification for Reassortment vs. Recombination**\n\nThe fundamental difference in the mechanism of genetic exchange between segmented and non-segmented RNA viruses is a direct consequence of their distinct genome architectures.\n\nFor a **segmented RNA virus**, the genome is composed of multiple, physically separate RNA molecules, referred to as segments. In the described co-infection, the replication of both parental strains, $A$ and $B$, results in an intracellular pool containing multiple copies of all $n$ distinct segments from both parental lineages. For instance, the pool contains segment $1$ from strain $A$ (denoted $S_{1A}$) and segment $1$ from strain $B$ (denoted $S_{1B}$), segment $2$ from strain $A$ ($S_{2A}$) and strain $B$ ($S_{2B}$), and so on, up to segment $n$. According to the given principles, a new progeny virion must package exactly one copy of each of the $n$ functionally distinct segments to be viable. The packaging machinery selects one segment for each \"slot\" from this mixed pool. For the first segment slot, it can select either $S_{1A}$ or $S_{1B}$. For the second slot, it can select either $S_{2A}$ or $S_{2B}$. This process is repeated for all $n$ segments. The independent selection of entire, pre-existing RNA molecules from a mixed parental pool is the very definition of **reassortment**. This high-frequency shuffling of intact genetic \"modules\" is a natural outcome of a multipartite genome structure.\n\nFor a **non-segmented RNA virus**, the entire genome exists as a single, continuous RNA molecule. There are no physically separate segments to shuffle or re-assort. Therefore, genetic exchange must occur via a mechanism that can generate novel combinations of genetic markers *within* that single molecule. This mechanism is **homologous recombination**. During replication, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase may initiate synthesis on one parental template molecule (e.g., from strain $A$) and then \"jump\" or switch to the corresponding region of the homologous template from the other parent (e.g., strain $B$) before completing replication. This \"copy-choice\" mechanism results in a single progeny RNA molecule that is a chimera, containing sections derived from both parental genomes. Reassortment is physically impossible for such a virus because there are no discrete genomic parts to assort. Thus, the physical continuity of the genome necessitates a molecular mechanism like recombination to achieve genetic mixing.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Number of Progeny Genotypes**\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of distinct progeny genotypes that can be produced through reassortment in a co-infection with two strains, $A$ and $B$, of a virus with a genome of $n$ segments.\n\nLet the set of segments for strain $A$ be $\\{S_{1A}, S_{2A}, \\dots, S_{nA}\\}$ and for strain $B$ be $\\{S_{1B}, S_{2B}, \\dots, S_{nB}\\}$.\nA progeny virion must contain exactly one copy of each distinct segment type, from segment $1$ to segment $n$.\nBased on assumption (iii), for each segment position $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$), the selection of the segment is an independent choice between the version from strain $A$ ($S_{iA}$) and the version from strain $B$ ($S_{iB}$).\n\nLet's analyze the number of choices for each segment:\n- For segment $1$, there are $2$ possible choices: $S_{1A}$ or $S_{1B}$.\n- For segment $2$, there are $2$ possible choices: $S_{2A}$ or $S_{2B}$.\n- This pattern continues for all $n$ segments.\n- For segment $i$, there are $2$ possible choices: $S_{iA}$ or $S_{iB}$.\n- For segment $n$, there are $2$ possible choices: $S_{nA}$ or $S_{nB}$.\n\nSince the choice for each segment is independent of the choices for all other segments, the total number of distinct combinations of segments (which defines a unique genotype) is the product of the number of choices available for each individual segment. This is an application of the fundamental principle of counting (the rule of product).\n\nTotal number of genotypes = (Choices for segment $1$) $\\times$ (Choices for segment $2$) $\\times \\dots \\times$ (Choices for segment $n$).\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\text{Total Genotypes} = \\underbrace{2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2}_{n \\text{ times}} $$\n\nThis product is equivalent to $2$ raised to the power of $n$:\n$$ \\text{Total Genotypes} = 2^n $$\n\nThis expression accounts for all possible combinations. This includes the two non-reassortant parental genotypes (all segments from strain $A$, or all segments from strain $B$) and all $2^n - 2$ reassortant genotypes, where at least one segment is from strain $A$ and at least one is from strain $B$. The problem asks for the total number of distinct genotypes, which is precisely this value.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for the total number of distinct progeny genotypes is $2^n$.",
