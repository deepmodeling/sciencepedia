            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Initial anti-A isohemagglutinin titer: $1\\!:\\!128$.\n- Target anti-A isohemagglutinin titer: below $1\\!:\\!8$.\n- Removal per immunoadsorption session: $50\\%$ of the circulating antibody.\n- Regeneration between sessions (over one day): proportional increase of $10\\%$.\n- Regimen: One session is performed per day.\n- Timing assumption: Removal is immediate, followed by regeneration over the next day.\n- Proportionality assumption: The measured titer denominator is proportional to the circulating anti-A antibody concentration.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of transplant immunology, specifically the management of ABO-incompatible transplants. The concepts of isohemagglutinin titers, immunoadsorption (a form of apheresis), and antibody rebound kinetics are standard in the field. The numerical values for titers, removal efficiency, and regeneration are plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial state, a defined dynamic process, and a specific target condition. It asks for a minimum whole number of days, which implies a unique integer solution is expected.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information to construct a mathematical model. The assumptions about constant fractional removal and proportional regeneration are simplifications, but they are clearly stated and consistent, allowing for the creation of a solvable discrete-time model. There are no contradictions in the givens.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is a standard clinical problem, and the modeling assumptions are common first-order approximations used in pharmacokinetics and immunodynamics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to model the day-to-day evolution of the antibody level using a discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a first-order linear recurrence relation. The problem states that the antibody titer denominator is proportional to the antibody concentration. Therefore, we can work directly with the titer denominators to model the process.\n\nLet $T_n$ be the titer denominator measured on the morning of day $n$, just before the immunoadsorption session for that day. The initial condition is the baseline titer before any treatment begins. We can define this as the state on day $0$.\n$$ T_0 = 128 $$\nThe process for one full day, from the measurement on day $n$ to the measurement on day $n+1$, consists of two steps:\n1.  **Immunoadsorption**: The session on day $n$ removes $50\\%$ of the antibodies. The concentration, and thus the titer denominator, is reduced by this fraction. The level immediately after the session is $T_n \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.5 T_n$.\n2.  **Regeneration**: Over the subsequent 24 hours (until the morning of day $n+1$), the antibody level increases by $10\\%$. This means the level is multiplied by a factor of $(1 + 0.10) = 1.1$.\n\nCombining these two steps, the titer denominator on the morning of day $n+1$, $T_{n+1}$, is related to the titer denominator on the morning of day $n$, $T_n$, as follows:\n$$ T_{n+1} = (0.5 T_n) \\times 1.1 $$\n$$ T_{n+1} = 0.55 T_n $$\nThis is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with a constant coefficient, which describes a geometric progression. The solution can be expressed in a closed form by repeated application of the relation:\n$$ T_n = (0.55)^n T_0 $$\nSubstituting the initial condition $T_0 = 128$:\n$$ T_n = 128 \\times (0.55)^n $$\nThe transplant protocol requires the titer to be \"below $1\\!:\\!8$\". This means the titer denominator must be less than $8$. We need to find the minimum whole number of days, $n$, for which $T_n < 8$.\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$ 128 \\times (0.55)^n < 8 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ (0.55)^n < \\frac{8}{128} $$\n$$ (0.55)^n < \\frac{1}{16} $$\nNow, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln((0.55)^n) < \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$ n \\ln(0.55) < \\ln(1) - \\ln(16) $$\n$$ n \\ln(0.55) < -\\ln(16) $$\nTo isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.55)$. It is critical to note that since $0.55 < 1$, its natural logarithm, $\\ln(0.55)$, is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$ n > \\frac{-\\ln(16)}{\\ln(0.55)} $$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$ n > \\frac{\\ln(16)}{-\\ln(0.55)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln(1/0.55)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln(20/11)} $$\nNow we evaluate the numerical value:\n$$ \\ln(16) \\approx 2.7725887... $$\n$$ \\ln(0.55) \\approx -0.5978370... $$\n$$ n > \\frac{-2.7725887...}{-0.5978370...} \\approx 4.6378... $$\nSince $n$ must be a whole number of days, we must find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies $n > 4.6378...$. This integer is $n=5$.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the titer for $n=4$ and $n=5$:\nFor $n=4$ days:\n$$ T_4 = 128 \\times (0.55)^4 \\approx 128 \\times 0.09150625 \\approx 11.7128 $$\nThe titer denominator $11.7128$ is not less than $8$, so $4$ days are insufficient.\n\nFor $n=5$ days:\n$$ T_5 = 128 \\times (0.55)^5 \\approx 128 \\times 0.0503284375 \\approx 6.44204 $$\nThe titer denominator $6.44204$ is less than $8$.\n\nThus, on the morning of the 5th day, the titer will have fallen below the required threshold of $1\\!:\\!8$. This requires a total of 5 daily sessions. The minimum whole number of days required is 5.",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes lifelong latency in host myeloid lineage cells with potential for reactivation under immunosuppression; thus, a CMV-seropositive donor (denoted $D+$) can introduce primary infection into a CMV-seronegative recipient ($R-$), whereas a CMV-seropositive recipient ($R+$) faces mainly reactivation risk, modulated by donor serostatus.

Let $\\lambda_i$ be the constant hazard rate of CMV disease for a group $i$ over the observation window of duration $T = 6$ months. The cumulative incidence, $I_i$, is the probability of experiencing the event by time $T$. It is related to the event-free survival probability, $S_i(T)$, by $I_i = 1 - S_i(T)$. For a constant hazard rate, $S_i(T) = \\exp(-\\lambda_i T)$.\n\nThe quantity $\\lambda_i T$ is the cumulative hazard, $H_i$, for group $i$. Thus, $I_i = 1 - \\exp(-H_i)$.\n\nThe baseline group is $D-/R-$, which we denote with a subscript $0$. We are given its cumulative incidence: $I_0 = I_{D-/R-} = 0.02$. From this, we can determine the baseline survival probability and cumulative hazard.\nThe baseline survival probability is $S_0 = 1 - I_0 = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\nThe baseline cumulative hazard $H_0$ is found from $S_0 = \\exp(-H_0)$, which gives $H_0 = -\\ln(S_0) = -\\ln(0.98)$.\n\nThe proportional hazards model states that the hazard rate for any group $i$ is proportional to the baseline hazard rate: $\\lambda_i = HR_i \\cdot \\lambda_0$, where $HR_i$ is the hazard ratio. It follows that the cumulative hazard is also proportional: $H_i = \\lambda_i T = (HR_i \\cdot \\lambda_0) T = HR_i \\cdot H_0$.\n\nWe can now express the survival probability for any group $i$ in terms of the baseline survival probability $S_0$:\n$$S_i = \\exp(-H_i) = \\exp(-HR_i \\cdot H_0) = \\left(\\exp(-H_0)\\right)^{HR_i} = S_0^{HR_i}$$\nThe cumulative incidence for group $i$ is therefore:\n$$I_i = 1 - S_i = 1 - S_0^{HR_i}$$\nThis derivation fulfills the first requirement of the problem.\n\nUsing $S_0 = 0.98$ and the given hazard ratios, we can calculate the $6$-month cumulative incidence for each risk group:\n- $I_{D-/R-} = I_0 = 0.02$ (given)\n- $I_{D+/R-} = 1 - S_0^{HR_{D+/R-}} = 1 - (0.98)^6$\n- $I_{D+/R+} = 1 - S_0^{HR_{D+/R+}} = 1 - (0.98)^3$\n- $I_{D-/R+} = 1 - S_0^{HR_{D-/R+}} = 1 - (0.98)^2$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total number of CMV disease cases for each strategy. The total number of transplants is $N=1200$. Let $f_{S,i}$ be the fraction of transplants in group $i$ under strategy $S \\in \\{A, B\\}$. The expected number of cases for strategy $S$ is $C_S = N \\sum_i f_{S,i} \\cdot I_i$.\n\nFor Strategy A:\n$$C_A = N \\left( f_{A, D+/R-} I_{D+/R-} + f_{A, D+/R+} I_{D+/R+} + f_{A, D-/R+} I_{D-/R+} + f_{A, D-/R-} I_{D-/R-} \\right)$$\n$$C_A = 1200 \\left( 0.20 \\cdot I_{D+/R-} + 0.30 \\cdot I_{D+/R+} + 0.30 \\cdot I_{D-/R+} + 0.20 \\cdot I_{D-/R-} \\right)$$\n\nFor Strategy B:\n$$C_B = N \\left( f_{B, D+/R-} I_{D+/R-} + f_{B, D+/R+} I_{D+/R+} + f_{B, D-/R+} I_{D-/R+} + f_{B, D-/R-} I_{D-/R-} \\right)$$\n$$C_B = 1200 \\left( 0.10 \\cdot I_{D+/R-} + 0.40 \\cdot I_{D+/R+} + 0.30 \\cdot I_{D-/R+} + 0.20 \\cdot I_{D-/R-} \\right)$$\n\nThe number of cases avoided by Strategy B compared to Strategy A is $\\Delta C = C_A - C_B$. We compute the difference:\n$$\\Delta C = C_A - C_B = N \\left[ (f_{A, D+/R-} - f_{B, D+/R-}) I_{D+/R-} + (f_{A, D+/R+} - f_{B, D+/R+}) I_{D+/R+} \\right]$$\nThe terms for $D-/R+$ and $D-/R-$ cancel as their fractions are unchanged.\n$$\\Delta C = 1200 \\left[ (0.20 - 0.10) I_{D+/R-} + (0.30 - 0.40) I_{D+/R+} \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta C = 1200 \\left[ 0.10 \\cdot I_{D+/R-} - 0.10 \\cdot I_{D+/R+} \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left( I_{D+/R-} - I_{D+/R+} \\right)$$\n\nThis expression is intuitive: the number of cases avoided is the number of patients moved between risk strata ($0.10 \\times 1200 = 120$) multiplied by the difference in risk (incidence) between those strata.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for the incidences:\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left[ \\left(1 - (0.98)^6\\right) - \\left(1 - (0.98)^3\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left[ 1 - (0.98)^6 - 1 + (0.98)^3 \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left[ (0.98)^3 - (0.98)^6 \\right]$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$(0.98)^3 = 0.941192$$\n$$(0.98)^6 = ((0.98)^3)^2 = (0.941192)^2 \\approx 0.88584238$$\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left( 0.941192 - 0.88584238 \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta C = 120 \\left( 0.05534962 \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta C \\approx 6.6419544$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta C \\approx 6.64$$",
