This exercise demonstrates the critical importance of host DNA depletion, a common pre-analytical step.

            "problem": "A clinical stool specimen is processed for metagenomic sequencing using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Prior to library preparation, host DNA depletion is performed. The specimen contains microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with mass $10\\ \\mathrm{ng}$ and human DNA with mass $1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g}$ before depletion. The depletion protocol removes $90\\%$ of the human DNA mass and leaves microbial DNA unchanged. Assume that library preparation and sequencing are unbiased with respect to source (microbial versus human), and that fragment size distributions and conversion efficiencies to sequencing-ready molecules are similar across sources, so that the expected fraction of sequencing reads originating from a source equals that source’s fraction of the total DNA mass in the library.\n\nUnder these assumptions, compute the expected microbial fraction of reads in the post-depletion library. Express your answer as a unitless decimal fraction and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of metagenomics, is well-posed with a unique solvable outcome, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nLet $m_{M,0}$ be the initial mass of microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and $m_{H,0}$ be the initial mass of human DNA in the specimen. According to the problem statement, we are given:\n$$ m_{M,0} = 10\\ \\mathrm{ng} $$\n$$ m_{H,0} = 1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g} $$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, we must express both masses in the same unit. We convert micrograms ($\\mathrm{\\mu g}$) to nanograms ($\\mathrm{ng}$), using the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ng}$.\n$$ m_{H,0} = 1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{ng}}{1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ng} $$\n\nThe problem states that a host depletion protocol is applied. Let $m_{M,f}$ and $m_{H,f}$ be the final masses of microbial and human DNA, respectively, after the depletion process.\n\nThe microbial DNA mass is unchanged:\n$$ m_{M,f} = m_{M,0} = 10\\ \\mathrm{ng} $$\n\nThe depletion protocol removes $90\\%$ of the human DNA mass. This corresponds to a removal fraction of $0.9$. The remaining fraction of human DNA is $1 - 0.9 = 0.1$. Therefore, the final mass of human DNA is:\n$$ m_{H,f} = m_{H,0} \\times (1 - 0.90) = m_{H,0} \\times 0.10 $$\nSubstituting the value of $m_{H,0}$:\n$$ m_{H,f} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ng} \\times 0.10 = 100\\ \\mathrm{ng} $$\n\nThe total mass of DNA in the post-depletion library, $m_{T,f}$, is the sum of the final microbial and human DNA masses:\n$$ m_{T,f} = m_{M,f} + m_{H,f} $$\n$$ m_{T,f} = 10\\ \\mathrm{ng} + 100\\ \\mathrm{ng} = 110\\ \\mathrm{ng} $$\n\nThe problem assumes that the expected fraction of sequencing reads originating from a source equals that source’s fraction of the total DNA mass in the library. We are asked to compute the expected microbial fraction of reads, which we denote as $F_M$. Based on the assumption:\n$$ F_M = \\frac{m_{M,f}}{m_{T,f}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ F_M = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{ng}}{110\\ \\mathrm{ng}} = \\frac{10}{110} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\n\nTo express this fraction as a unitless decimal, we perform the division:\n$$ F_M = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 0.09090909... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is $9$. The next three significant figures are $0, 9, 0$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $9$.

            "introduction": "Once sequencing is complete, a key question is whether we have gathered enough data to reliably analyze a microbe's genome. This practice introduces the concept of sequencing coverage, a fundamental metric for assessing data quantity, and explores how technical artifacts like PCR duplicates can reduce its effective value. Mastering this calculation is essential for judging the quality and completeness of a metagenomic dataset and for planning future sequencing experiments .",

The pathogen’s genome is approximately $G=5\\times 10^{6}$ bp. Starting from the fundamental definition that average sequencing coverage is the expected number of times each base in the genome is sampled under uniform random sampling of bases, compute the expected average coverage for this pathogen. Then, acknowledging that Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can introduce duplicate reads that do not add new unique molecular information, estimate the effective coverage if the PCR duplication rate is $10\\%$ (i.e., a fraction $p=0.10$ of reads are duplicates). Assume duplicates are distributed uniformly with respect to the genome and contribute no additional unique bases beyond their originals. Report both the expected coverage and the effective coverage after accounting for duplication as unitless fold-coverage numbers. Provide exact values without rounding.",
            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is developed in two parts, corresponding to the two quantities requested.\n\n**Part 1: Expected Average Coverage**\n\nThe average sequencing coverage, denoted as $C$, is defined as the expected number of times each base in the genome is sampled. This can be calculated as the ratio of the total number of sequenced bases to the total size of the genome.\n\nThe total number of sequenced bases is the product of the number of reads ($N$) and the average length of each read ($L$).\n$$ \\text{Total sequenced bases} = N \\times L $$\n\nThe genome size is given as $G$.\n\nAccording to the definition, assuming uniform random sampling, the average coverage $C$ is:\n$$ C = \\frac{N \\times L}{G} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n- $N = 1 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $L = 150$ bp\n- $G = 5 \\times 10^{6}$ bp\n\n$$ C = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 150}{5 \\times 10^{6}} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{5}}{5 \\times 10^{6}} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{7}}{5 \\times 10^{6}} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1.5}{5} \\times 10^{7-6} $$\n$$ C = 0.3 \\times 10^{1} $$\n$$ C = 3 $$\n\nThe expected average coverage is $3X$ (3-fold). This is a unitless number as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Effective Coverage after Accounting for Duplication**\n\nPCR duplication introduces redundant reads that do not provide new information about the genome sequence. The problem states a PCR duplication rate of $p = 0.10$, meaning $10\\%$ of the reads are duplicates.\n\nThe number of unique, informative reads, $N_{\\text{unique}}$, is the total number of reads, $N$, minus the number of duplicate reads. The number of duplicate reads is $p \\times N$.\n$$ N_{\\text{unique}} = N - (p \\times N) = N(1-p) $$\n\nThe effective coverage, $C_{\\text{eff}}$, is the coverage calculated using only the unique, informative reads. Therefore, the total number of effective sequenced bases is $N_{\\text{unique}} \\times L$.\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{unique}} \\times L}{G} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\text{unique}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{N(1-p)L}{G} $$\nWe can recognize that this is the original coverage $C$ multiplied by the fraction of unique reads $(1-p)$:\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = C \\times (1-p) $$\n\nUsing the previously calculated value $C=3$ and the given duplication rate $p = 0.10$:\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = 3 \\times (1 - 0.10) $$\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = 3 \\times 0.90 $$\n$$ C_{\\text{eff}} = 2.7 $$\n\nThe effective coverage, after accounting for a $10\\%$ duplication rate, is $2.7X$ (2.7-fold). This is also a unitless number.\n\nThe two requested values are the expected coverage ($3$) and the effective coverage ($2.7$).",

            "introduction": "A powerful diagnostic test is only useful if its results can be correctly interpreted in a specific clinical context. This problem bridges the gap between an assay's intrinsic performance (sensitivity and specificity) and its real-world predictive power, the Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV). By working through this essential biostatistical calculation, you will see how disease prevalence critically influences a test's utility and why a positive result from even a highly specific assay may require further confirmation .",

Finally, based on your results and the definitions you used, state in one or two sentences how these values bear on the clinical utility of mNGS as a screening test in CSF for viral encephalitis in this population.",
            "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that a patient has viral encephalitis, and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result from the mNGS assay, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\n- The prevalence of the disease, $\\pi$, is the prior probability of having the disease: $P(D) = \\pi = 0.01$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n- The sensitivity, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $P(T^+ | D) = \\mathrm{Se} = 0.95$.\n- The specificity, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, is the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $P(T^- | D^c) = \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, we can also define their complements:\n- The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n- The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nOur objective is to derive expressions for and calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nThe PPV is the post-test probability of having the disease given a positive result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nTherefore, the derived expression for PPV is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}\n$$\n\nThe NPV is the post-test probability of not having the disease given a negative result, which is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem again:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (\\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})(\\pi)\n$$\nTherefore, the derived expression for NPV is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1 - \\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se}) \\cdot \\pi}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the provided parameters: $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.95$, $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.98$, and $\\pi = 0.01$.\n\nFor PPV:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.01}{0.95 \\cdot 0.01 + (1 - 0.98) \\cdot (1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + (0.02)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0198} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0293} \\approx 0.32423208...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.3242$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)}{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.01) + (1 - 0.95) \\cdot 0.01} = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.99}{0.98 \\cdot 0.99 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.01} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.9702 + 0.0005} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.9707} \\approx 0.9994848...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 0.9995$.\n\nRegarding the clinical utility: The extremely high NPV ($0.9995$) makes the mNGS assay an excellent screening tool to rule out viral encephalitis, as a negative result is highly reliable. However, the low PPV ($0.3242$) indicates that a positive result has a high probability of being a false positive, necessitating confirmatory testing to establish a definitive diagnosis.",
