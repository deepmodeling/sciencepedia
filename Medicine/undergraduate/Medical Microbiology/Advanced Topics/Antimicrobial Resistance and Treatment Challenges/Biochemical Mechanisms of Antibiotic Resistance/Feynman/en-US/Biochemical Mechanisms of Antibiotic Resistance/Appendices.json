            "problem": "A Gram-positive bacterium relies on an essential Penicillin-Binding Protein (PBP) for peptidoglycan crosslinking. A beta-lactam antibiotic prevents growth by binding to and acylating the active site of the PBP, thereby rendering it inactive. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest external antibiotic concentration that prevents detectable bacterial growth under a standardized assay. Assume the following scientifically grounded scenario:\n- At steady state during the assay, growth is prevented if at least a critical fraction $\\theta^{\\*}$ of PBPs are inactivated (the threshold $\\theta^{\\*}$ is constant across strains under identical assay conditions).\n- The antibiotic interacts with the PBP via one-to-one binding before rapid acylation, and under the assay conditions the fraction of inhibited PBPs can be approximated by the equilibrium occupancy determined by mass-action binding.\n- The effective Michaelis constant $K_M$ serves as an affinity-like parameter for the drug–PBP interaction under these conditions, and an increased $K_M$ indicates reduced apparent affinity.\n- PBP abundance, expression level, and the external drug exposure profile remain unchanged between strains.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action for reversible binding and the definition of the MIC as the drug concentration that achieves the threshold fraction $\\theta^{\\*}$ of inhibited PBPs, derive the dependence of $MIC$ on $K_M$.
