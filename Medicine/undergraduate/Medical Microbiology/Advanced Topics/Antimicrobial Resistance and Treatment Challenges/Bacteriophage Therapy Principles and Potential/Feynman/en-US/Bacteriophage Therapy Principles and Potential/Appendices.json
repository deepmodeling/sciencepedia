The scenario, involving bacteriophage therapy and sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), is scientifically realistic and relevant to modern medical microbiology and pharmacology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions, variables ($D$, $V_d$, $s$), and a clear objective. The premises lead to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided data are self-consistent and sufficient for solving the problem. There are no contradictions. The structure of the problem (calculating an initial estimate, then a corrected one) is logical.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution will be derived from the fundamental definition of the volume of distribution provided in the problem statement. The volume of distribution, $V_d$, is an apparent volume that relates the total amount of a drug in the body to its concentration in blood plasma.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial, uncorrected plasma concentration, $C_{p,0}$. The problem states to use the definition $V_d = \\frac{A_{\\text{total}}}{C_p}$ and the assumption that the total amount of agent in the body, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is approximately equal to the administered dose, $D$. At the initial time point ($t=0$), the plasma concentration is $C_{p,0}$.\n\n$$V_d = \\frac{D}{C_{p,0}}$$\n\nSolving for $C_{p,0}$ gives:\n\n$$C_{p,0} = \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$C_{p,0} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{10}~\\mathrm{PFU}}{4.5~\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{10}~\\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{L} \\approx 6.67 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNext, we must incorporate the effect of sequestration to find the corrected initial plasma concentration, $C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}}$. The problem states that a fraction $s$ of the injected dose is rapidly sequestered and \"does not contribute to the circulating plasma.\" This is the critical piece of information. The apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, is a proportionality constant that relates the plasma concentration to the amount of drug that is actively involved in the distribution equilibrium within the body's compartments (the \"well-mixed compartment\").\n\nThe sequestered fraction of the dose, equal to $s \\times D$, is effectively removed from this dynamic process. Therefore, the amount of agent that actually distributes throughout the apparent volume $V_d$ to establish the plasma concentration is not the total dose $D$, but the non-sequestered portion.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{effective}}$ be the amount of drug that contributes to the plasma concentration.\n$$A_{\\text{effective}} = D - (s \\times D) = D(1-s)$$\n\nWe now apply the fundamental definition of $V_d$ using this effective amount. The volume of distribution $V_d$ relates this effective amount to the resulting corrected plasma concentration $C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}}$.\n\n$$V_d = \\frac{A_{\\text{effective}}}{C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\text{effective}}$:\n\n$$V_d = \\frac{D(1-s)}{C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}}}$$\n\nWe solve for the corrected initial plasma concentration, $C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}}$:\n\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{D(1-s)}{V_d}$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values for $D$, $s$, and $V_d$:\n- $D = 3.0 \\times 10^{10}~\\mathrm{PFU}$\n- $s = 0.25$, so $(1-s) = 0.75$\n- $V_d = 4.5~\\mathrm{L}$\n\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\times (0.75)}{4.5} \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 10^{10}}{4.5} \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{10} \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^9 \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in units of $\\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{mL}$. We perform the unit conversion, knowing that $1~\\mathrm{L} = 1000~\\mathrm{mL} = 10^3~\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = 5.0 \\times 10^9 \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1~\\mathrm{L}}{10^3~\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{(9-3)} \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = 5.0 \\times 10^6 \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nFinally, we round the answer to three significant figures as requested.\n\n$$C_{p,0}^{\\text{corr}} = 5.00 \\times 10^6 \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nThis result is physically sensible. The sequestration of a portion of the dose prevents it from circulating, leading to a lower initial plasma concentration ($5.00 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{mL}$) compared to the naive estimate that ignores sequestration ($\\approx 6.67 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{mL}$).",

Phage are irreversibly removed by adsorption to bacterial surfaces, which at low phage concentration is well-described by mass-action kinetics with an adsorption rate constant $k$ so that the removal rate is proportional to $k P B$.

This is a standard and well-established model in biophysics and microbiology. The reaction term, $-kPB$, represents first-order removal kinetics (since $B$ is constant), which is a valid simplification of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low substrate (phage) concentrations. The model is based on Fick's second law and mass-action kinetics, which are fundamental principles. The units provided for the constants are dimensionally consistent. The term $kPB$ must have units of concentration per time ($\\mathrm{phage}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile $P(x)$ and the penetration depth $x_{\\mathrm{pen}}$. At steady state, the concentration does not change with time, which means $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial differential equation (PDE) simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$0 = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - k B P$$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard form:\n$$\\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - \\frac{k B}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} P = 0$$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous, second-order ODE with constant coefficients. Let us define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda^{-2} = \\frac{kB}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$. Then the equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} P = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = 0$, which has two real roots, $r_1 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ and $r_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The general solution is therefore of the form:\n$$P(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. The steady-state boundary conditions are $P(0) = P_0$ and $P(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nFrom the condition $P(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, we analyze the general solution. The term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows indefinitely as $x \\to \\infty$. To satisfy the boundary condition, its coefficient must be zero, so $C_1 = 0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$P(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition at the surface, $P(0) = P_0$:\n$$P(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2 = P_0$$\nThus, the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$P(x) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{kB}}$.\n\nNext, we find the penetration depth $x_{\\mathrm{pen}}$.
