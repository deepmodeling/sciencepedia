            "problem": "A clinician suspects bullous pemphigoid in a patient presenting with widespread pruritus, erythematous urticarial plaques, and newly formed tense blisters. The suspected pathophysiology involves autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal components Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen $180$ ($BP180$, also called collagen XVII) and Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen $230$ ($BP230$), with complement activation and recruitment of eosinophils leading to dermoepidermal separation.

            "solution": "### Problem Statement Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Clinical Presentation:** A patient with widespread pruritus, erythematous urticarial plaques, and newly formed tense blisters.\n- **Suspected Diagnosis:** Bullous pemphigoid.\n- **Suspected Pathophysiology:** Autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal components Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen $180$ ($BP180$, also called collagen XVII) and Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen $230$ ($BP230$). There is complement activation, recruitment of eosinophils, and subsequent dermoepidermal separation.\n- **Task:** Justify the optimal biopsy site selection and timing based on the given immunopathologic mechanisms. Delineate the expected microscopic findings for (i) the edge of a fresh tense blister and (ii) an urticarial plaque.\n- **Question:** Which option most accurately justifies the optimal biopsy strategy and correctly predicts the histologic and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) findings?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established principles of dermatology, immunopathology, and clinical diagnostics.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. Bullous pemphigoid is a well-characterized autoimmune blistering disease. The described pathophysiology—involving anti-$BP180$ and anti-$BP230$ $IgG$ autoantibodies, complement fixation, eosinophil chemotaxis, and proteolytic degradation at the dermoepidermal junction leading to a subepidermal split—is the established and accepted mechanism. The clinical signs (pruritic urticarial plaques and tense blisters) are classic for this condition.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the application of fundamental pathophysiological principles to a standard clinical diagnostic problem (biopsy strategy). A unique and correct answer based on best practices in dermatopathology exists.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is objective, technical, and precise, using standard medical terminology. It is free from subjective or speculative claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. It accurately reflects a real-world clinical reasoning challenge in dermatology. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a logical application of the provided pathophysiology to determine the optimal diagnostic strategy for bullous pemphigoid.\n\n**1. Pathophysiological Basis for Biopsy Strategy**\n- The core pathology is the binding of $IgG$ autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal proteins ($BP180$, $BP230$) at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). This binding activates the complement system, leading to the deposition of complement components, most notably $C3$.\n- Complement activation products (e.g., $C5a$) are potent chemoattractants for inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils and, to a lesser extent, neutrophils.\n- These recruited inflammatory cells release proteases (e.g., eosinophil peroxidase, matrix metalloproteinases) that degrade the BMZ, causing the epidermis to separate from the dermis. This creates a subepidermal blister.\n\n**2. Optimal Biopsy for Routine Histology (Hematoxylin & Eosin, H&E)**\n- **Purpose:** To visualize the structural changes, specifically the level of the split and the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate.\n- **Site Selection:** The ideal location must show the pathology in its purest form.\n    - An old, crusted, or ruptured blister is not ideal because secondary changes like re-epithelialization, necrosis, and bacterial superinfection can obscure the primary findings.\n    - The center of an intact blister contains fluid and inflammatory cells but does not show the crucial interface where the separation is occurring.\n    - An **edge of a fresh, intact blister (formed within $24-48$ hours)** is optimal. A biopsy from this site includes the adjacent intact skin, the advancing edge of the blister, and the blister cavity itself. This allows the pathologist to unequivocally identify the split as subepidermal.\n- **Expected H&E Findings:**\n    - **Urticarial Plaque (Pre-bullous lesion):** This represents the early inflammatory stage before significant tissue cleavage. Findings include superficial dermal edema and a perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and, characteristically, numerous eosinophils. Eosinophils may also be seen migrating into the lower epidermis, a finding termed eosinophilic spongiosis. These findings are suggestive but not pathognomonic.\n    - **Fresh Blister Edge:** The pathognomonic structural finding is a **subepidermal cleft/blister**. The blister cavity contains fibrin and a rich infiltrate of eosinophils. The underlying papillary dermis shows edema and a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate. Eosinophils can cluster at the tips of the dermal papillae, forming so-called eosinophilic microabscesses.\n\n**3. Optimal Biopsy for Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF)**\n- **Purpose:** To detect the in-vivo deposition of immunoglobulins (primarily $IgG$) and complement ($C3$) along the BMZ.\n- **Site Selection:** The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.\n    - **Lesional skin (from the blister):** This is a **suboptimal** site. The intense inflammation and enzymatic activity within the blister can degrade the target antigens ($BP180$, $BP230$) and the bound antibodies/complement, leading to a potential false-negative result. The tissue can also be very friable, making processing difficult.\n    - **Perilesional skin:** This is the **optimal** site. It is defined as clinically normal-appearing skin taken approximately $1$ cm from the edge of an active lesion (blister or plaque). Autoantibodies are bound throughout the skin, even in non-inflamed areas. In perilesional skin, the BMZ is intact, and the bound immunoreactants are present without being destroyed by the inflammatory process. This provides the clearest and most reliable result.\n- **Expected DIF Findings:**\n    - A continuous, **linear deposition of $IgG$ and/or $C3$ along the BMZ**. This \"penciled-in\" line is the hallmark immunofluorescent pattern for bullous pemphigoid. While $IgG$ is the primary pathogenic antibody, $C3$ deposition is often more intense and is present in nearly all cases ($>90\\%$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For routine hematoxylin and eosin histology, sample the edge of an intact, fresh tense blister within approximately $24$ hours of formation; for DIF, obtain perilesional, clinically uninvolved skin within approximately $1$ cm of a fresh lesion. Early urticarial plaques are less specific histologically, typically showing eosinophilic spongiosis, superficial dermal edema, and a perivascular infiltrate, whereas a fresh blister edge shows a subepidermal cleft with fibrin and eosinophils (sometimes with eosinophilic microabscesses in the papillary dermis). DIF on perilesional skin shows a linear band of $\\mathrm{IgG}$ and $C3$ along the basement membrane zone.**\n- **Biopsy Strategy:** The recommended sites and timing for both H&E (edge of a fresh blister) and DIF (perilesional skin) are correct and represent the standard of care.\n- **Histologic Descriptions:** The descriptions for both the urticarial plaque (eosinophilic spongiosis, edema, perivascular infiltrate) and the blister edge (subepidermal cleft, eosinophils, eosinophilic microabscesses) are accurate.\n- **DIF Description:** The description of a linear band of $IgG$ and $C3$ at the BMZ is the pathognomonic finding.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately describes the optimal diagnostic approach and the expected findings based on a correct understanding of the pathophysiology.\n\n**B. Biopsy the center of a ruptured blister for histology and take perilesional skin from an urticarial plaque for DIF. Expect suprabasal acantholysis with a “row of tombstones” on histology and intercellular $\\mathrm{IgG}$ deposition on DIF, which best confirms bullous pemphigoid.**\n- **Biopsy Strategy:** Biopsy of a ruptured blister is incorrect for H&E.\n- **Histologic/DIF Descriptions:** The findings described—suprabasal acantholysis (\"row of tombstones\") and intercellular DIF pattern—are characteristic of **pemphigus vulgaris**, a different autoimmune blistering disease that affects desmosomes within the epidermis. This is fundamentally incorrect for bullous pemphigoid, which is a subepidermal disease affecting hemidesmosomes.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For histology, sample an urticarial plaque to capture early basal keratinocyte apoptosis and subcorneal neutrophilic pustules; for DIF, biopsy the blister roof directly to maximize antigen concentration. Expect granular $\\mathrm{IgA}$ deposition in the dermal papillae and subcorneal pustules.**\n- **Biopsy Strategy:** Sampling an urticarial plaque for H&E is not optimal if a blister is available. Biopsying the blister roof for DIF is incorrect.\n- **Histologic/DIF Descriptions:** Basal keratinocyte apoptosis is not a primary feature. Subcorneal neutrophilic pustules are incorrect; the split is subepidermal and the infiltrate is eosinophilic. Granular $IgA$ deposition in dermal papillae is the pathognomonic finding for **dermatitis herpetiformis**.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Sample the edge of a fresh blister for both histology and DIF within $12$ hours. Expect linear $\\mathrm{IgA}$ deposition at dermal papillae and subepidermal blisters with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrates, which is pathognomonic for bullous pemphigoid.**\n- **Biopsy Strategy:** Using lesional skin (blister edge) for DIF is suboptimal.\n- **Histologic/DIF Descriptions:** The key findings described—linear $IgA$ deposition and a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate—are characteristic of **linear IgA bullous dermatosis**, not bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an $IgG$-mediated disease with a typically eosinophil-rich infiltrate.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For histology, sample either the center of an old crusted blister or a late-stage urticarial plaque; for DIF, take lesional blister base to ensure capture of the split. Expect in urticarial plaques: basal vacuolar change and neutrophilic microabscesses; in blisters: suprabasal acantholysis; DIF: intercellular $\\mathrm{IgG}$ with absent $C3$.**\n- **Biopsy Strategy:** The recommended sites for both H&E (old/crusted blister) and DIF (lesional base) are incorrect and likely to yield non-diagnostic or false-negative results.\n- **Histologic/DIF Descriptions:** Basal vacuolar change is not classic. Suprabasal acantholysis and intercellular $IgG$ are findings of pemphigus vulgaris. Absent $C3$ is atypical for bullous pemphigoid, where $C3$ is a very sensitive marker.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

This practice  moves beyond bullous pemphigoid in isolation, asking you to construct a systematic decision tree for autoimmune blistering disorders. By organizing clinical, histological, and immunological features into a logical algorithm, you will develop the structured thinking required for accurate differential diagnosis.",
            "id": "4418164",
            "problem": "You are asked to design a decision tree, denoted by $T$, that maps a feature vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{10})$ describing a blistering disease to one of six diagnostic classes: bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease, bullous drug eruption, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. The feature vector components are defined from first principles of skin structure, immunopathology, and clinicopathologic correlations as follows: $x_1$ is blister morphology (tense versus flaccid), $x_2$ is mucosal involvement (present versus absent), $x_3$ is histologic level of split (intraepidermal acantholysis versus subepidermal cleft), $x_4$ is direct immunofluorescence (DIF; defined as either intercellular binding within the epidermis or linear binding at the basement membrane zone), $x_5$ is the predominant immunoglobulin/isotype at the site of binding (IgG and/or complement component $C3$ versus IgA), $x_6$ is the salt-split skin indirect immunofluorescence (IIF; binding to the epidermal “roof” versus dermal “floor”), $x_7$ is antigen-specific serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; reactivity to desmoglein $1/3$, BP180 $\\mathrm{NC16A}$, BP230, type VII collagen, laminin $332$), $x_8$ is scarring (present versus absent), $x_9$ is recent drug exposure (present versus absent), and $x_{10}$ is age threshold (older adult, e.g., $> 60$ years, versus younger).\n\nThe decision tree must be constructed using the following fundamental base: skin architecture (desmosomes linking keratinocytes within the epidermis and hemidesmosomes anchoring basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane zone), the immunopathologic patterns of direct and indirect immunofluorescence, the mechanism of the salt-split technique (splitting at the lamina lucida such that hemidesmosomal antigens on the basal keratinocyte side remain with the epidermal “roof,” whereas anchoring fibril antigens such as type VII collagen localize to the dermal “floor”), and canonical clinicopathologic correlates for the listed disorders. No shortcut formulas beyond these foundations are permitted.\n\nChoose the option that best specifies a correct, hierarchical decision tree $T$ that distinguishes bullous pemphigoid from pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, linear IgA disease, bullous drug eruptions, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita using the defined features. Each option describes the sequence of decision nodes and their branching logic.\n\nA. Begin with $x_4$ (DIF pattern): if intercellular IgG within the epidermis (“fishnet”), classify as pemphigus vulgaris; if linear basement membrane zone, proceed. If DIF is negative, proceed to drug evaluation. At linear BMZ, evaluate $x_5$: if IgA predominates, classify as linear IgA disease; if IgG and/or $C3$ predominate, proceed. Evaluate $x_6$ (salt-split IIF): if binding is to the epidermal “roof,” classify as bullous pemphigoid and confirm with $x_7$ (BP180 $\\mathrm{NC16A}$ and/or BP230 ELISA positivity); if binding is to the dermal “floor,” proceed. At “floor,” branch by $x_7$ and $x_2/x_8$: if type VII collagen ELISA is positive or there is trauma-induced blisters with milia and acral predilection, classify as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita; if predominant mucosal involvement with scarring and possible laminin $332$ reactivity, classify as mucous membrane pemphigoid. If initial $x_4$ is negative and $x_9$ is present (recent drug exposure) with compatible histology, classify as bullous drug eruption; otherwise re-evaluate other causes.\n\nB. Begin with $x_6$ (salt-split IIF): if binding is to the dermal “floor,” classify as bullous pemphigoid; if binding is to the epidermal “roof,” classify as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. If IIF is non-informative, use $x_{10}$: if age $> 60$ years with tense bullae, classify as bullous pemphigoid; otherwise classify as mucous membrane pemphigoid if mucosa is involved and pemphigus vulgaris if mucosa is spared. ELISA to desmoglein $1/3$ should be used to confirm bullous pemphigoid when $x_6$ is indeterminate.\n\nC. Begin with $x_3$ (histology): if subepidermal split, classify as pemphigus vulgaris; if intraepidermal acantholysis, classify as bullous pemphigoid. If histology is equivocal, use $x_5$: IgA predominance indicates bullous pemphigoid; IgG predominance indicates linear IgA disease. Only if these fail, proceed to $x_6$ and consider roof binding to indicate epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and floor binding to indicate mucous membrane pemphigoid.\n\nD. Begin with $x_4$: if linear BMZ, proceed to $x_5$; if intercellular, proceed to $x_2$. For linear BMZ with IgG, assign epidermolysis bullosa acquisita; with IgA, assign bullous pemphigoid. For intercellular pattern, if mucosa involved, assign bullous drug eruption; if mucosa spared, assign pemphigus vulgaris. Salt-split IIF ($x_6$) should be used only to distinguish mucous membrane pemphigoid from linear IgA disease, where “floor” indicates linear IgA disease and “roof” indicates mucous membrane pemphigoid.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "We construct the decision tree $T$ from fundamental principles of skin structure, immunopathology, and the salt-split method, then check each option against these principles.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation:\n- Skin architecture: desmosomes mediate adhesion between keratinocytes within the epidermis; hemidesmosomes anchor basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Autoantibodies in pemphigus vulgaris target desmoglein $3$ and/or desmoglein $1$ (desmosomal cadherins), producing intraepidermal acantholytic blisters with characteristic direct immunofluorescence (DIF) showing intercellular IgG and complement component $C3$ in a “fishnet” pattern.\n- Subepidermal blistering diseases produce a split at or below the BMZ. Bullous pemphigoid autoantibodies target BP180 (type XVII collagen; particularly the $\\mathrm{NC16A}$ domain) and BP230 (plakin family) located in hemidesmosomes, yielding linear IgG and $C3$ at the BMZ on DIF. Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease shows linear IgA at BMZ on DIF. Mucous membrane pemphigoid can show linear IgG/$C3$ and sometimes IgA at BMZ, often with scarring and predominant mucosal disease; target antigens can include BP180, BP230, laminin $332$, and type VII collagen. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita targets type VII collagen (anchoring fibrils) below the lamina densa.\n- Salt-split skin IIF splits at the lamina lucida. Antigens residing at the hemidesmosome/lamina lucida (BP180/BP230) localize to the epidermal “roof” after splitting; antigens below the lamina densa (type VII collagen) localize to the dermal “floor.” Therefore, epidermal “roof” binding supports bullous pemphigoid, while dermal “floor” binding supports epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Mucous membrane pemphigoid can bind roof or floor depending on the antigen, with laminin $332$ and type VII collagen often yielding “floor” binding, and BP180 yielding “roof” binding. Linear IgA disease typically demonstrates linear IgA at BMZ and can show “roof” binding when the target is BP180.\n- Clinical features: bullous pemphigoid typically presents in older adults (often $> 60$ years) with tense bullae on erythematous/urticarial base and less frequent mucosal involvement; histology shows subepidermal blisters with eosinophils. Pemphigus vulgaris presents with flaccid bullae and erosions, prominent mucosal involvement, histology shows intraepidermal acantholysis. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita clinically may show trauma-induced blisters at friction sites, milia, and scarring; histology is subepidermal, often neutrophil predominant in inflammatory variants. Mucous membrane pemphigoid shows predominant mucosal disease with scarring. Linear IgA disease may present with annular “string of pearls” vesicles, subepidermal split, linear IgA at BMZ. Bullous drug eruptions are variable; DIF is typically negative or nonspecific, and a drug exposure history ($x_9$) is key.\n\nFrom these principles, a diagnostically sound hierarchy is:\n1. Use DIF pattern ($x_4$) first: intercellular (“fishnet”) IgG/$C3$ within epidermis indicates pemphigus vulgaris; linear BMZ suggests a subepidermal autoimmune process; DIF negative prompts consideration of bullous drug eruption if there is recent drug exposure ($x_9$) and compatible histology.\n2. For linear BMZ cases, use isotype ($x_5$): IgA dominance indicates linear IgA disease; IgG/$C3$ dominance indicates bullous pemphigoid/mucous membrane pemphigoid/epidermolysis bullosa acquisita spectrum.\n3. Among IgG/$C3$ BMZ cases, use salt-split skin ($x_6$): “roof” binding supports bullous pemphigoid (hemidesmosomal antigens), “floor” binding supports epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (type VII collagen) or mucous membrane pemphigoid when the target is floor-localized antigens (e.g., laminin $332$ or type VII collagen).\n4. Refine with antigen-specific ELISA ($x_7$): BP180 $\\mathrm{NC16A}$ and/or BP230 positivity supports bullous pemphigoid; type VII collagen positivity supports epidermolysis bullosa acquisita; laminin $332$ reactivity supports a mucous membrane pemphigoid subset.\n5. Use clinical context $x_2$ and $x_8$: predominant mucosal disease with scarring suggests mucous membrane pemphigoid; acral trauma-induced lesions with milia suggest epidermolysis bullosa acquisita; older age $x_{10}$ and urticarial/tense bullae favor bullous pemphigoid. Bullous drug eruption is supported by negative DIF and recent drug exposure ($x_9$).\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option mirrors the principled hierarchy:\n- $x_4$: intercellular epidermal pattern → pemphigus vulgaris; linear BMZ → proceed; negative DIF → consider bullous drug eruption with drug history ($x_9$). This is correct.\n- $x_5$: IgA predominance at BMZ → linear IgA disease; IgG/$C3$ predominance → proceed. Correct.\n- $x_6$: “roof” binding → bullous pemphigoid, confirmed by BP180 $\\mathrm{NC16A}$ and/or BP230 ELISA ($x_7$); “floor” binding → proceed to distinguish epidermolysis bullosa acquisita from mucous membrane pemphigoid. Correct.\n- Floor branch: type VII collagen ELISA positivity or EBA clinical phenotype → epidermolysis bullosa acquisita; mucosal scarring and laminin $332$ reactivity → mucous membrane pemphigoid. Correct.\n- Negative DIF with drug exposure → bullous drug eruption. Correct.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option reverses the salt-split interpretation:\n- It claims “floor” binding indicates bullous pemphigoid and “roof” indicates epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, which contradicts the lamina lucida split principle (hemidesmosomal antigens on the roof; type VII collagen on the floor). It then uses age $> 60$ and tense bullae to default to bullous pemphigoid when IIF is indeterminate, and proposes desmoglein $1/3$ ELISA to confirm bullous pemphigoid—desmogleins are targets in pemphigus, not bullous pemphigoid. Multiple foundational errors.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option misassigns histology:\n- It asserts subepidermal split indicates pemphigus vulgaris and intraepidermal acantholysis indicates bullous pemphigoid, reversing core definitions. It then states IgA predominance indicates bullous pemphigoid and IgG predominance indicates linear IgA disease, which conflicts with the isotype-defining nature of linear IgA disease and IgG/$C3$ predominance in bullous pemphigoid. It further misuses salt-split interpretations for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and mucous membrane pemphigoid. Foundational contradictions.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option misassigns diagnoses based on patterns and isotypes:\n- It assigns linear BMZ with IgG to epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and linear BMZ with IgA to bullous pemphigoid, which conflicts with the typical IgA definition of linear IgA disease and the need for salt-split localization to separate BP from EBA. It assigns intercellular pattern with mucosal involvement to bullous drug eruption and mucosa spared to pemphigus vulgaris, which reverses the role of pemphigus vulgaris (intercellular pattern regardless of mucosal involvement) and misuses drug eruption classification. It then claims salt-split is only for distinguishing mucous membrane pemphigoid from linear IgA disease and sets “floor” for linear IgA disease and “roof” for mucous membrane pemphigoid, both inconsistent with antigen localization principles.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly encodes the decision tree from first principles is option A.",

The Michaelis-Menten-like equation for drug effect (here, the normalized maximal effect model) is a standard pharmacodynamic model. The use of prednisone for bullous pemphigoid, the given dose ranges, the concept of $EC_{50}$, and the principles of glucocorticoid tapering to minimize HPA axis suppression are all fundamental and scientifically sound concepts in medicine.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It requires solving an inequality for a monotonic function and then finding the minimum value within a specified interval, which is a standard procedure. The subsequent calculation of the total dose is straightforward. The request to propose a tapering schedule based on given principles is a modeling task with sufficient constraints to allow for a reasoned, non-arbitrary construction. The final answer required is uniquely determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The solution process may proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the task description.\n\n#### 1. Derive the Minimal Admissible Dose per Body Weight ($d$)\nThe first task is to find the minimum dose per body weight, $d$, that achieves the target clinical effect while being within the acceptable starting dose range.\n\nThe condition for adequate disease control is given by the inequality:\n$$\nE(d) \\geq E^{\\star}\n$$\nSubstituting the given pharmacodynamic model and parameter values, $E(d) = \\frac{d}{EC_{50} + d}$, $EC_{50} = 0.4$, and $E^{\\star} = 0.6$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{0.4 + d} \\geq 0.6\n$$\nSince $d$ represents a drug dose, it must be non-negative ($d \\geq 0$), which ensures the denominator $(0.4 + d)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $(0.4 + d)$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\nd \\geq 0.6 (0.4 + d)\n$$\n$$\nd \\geq 0.24 + 0.6d\n$$\nTo solve for $d$, we isolate the variable:\n$$\nd - 0.6d \\geq 0.24\n$$\n$$\n0.4d \\geq 0.24\n$$\n$$\nd \\geq \\frac{0.24}{0.4}\n$$\n$$\nd \\geq 0.6\n$$\nThis result indicates that to achieve the target effect $E^{\\star} = 0.6$, the dose per body weight must be at least $0.6$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{kg}/\\text{day}$.\n\nThe problem also specifies an acceptable starting dose range for $d$: $[0.5, 1.0]$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{kg}/\\text{day}$.\nWe must find the minimal value of $d$ that satisfies both conditions:\n1. $d \\geq 0.6$\n2. $d \\in [0.5, 1.0]$\n\nThe intersection of these two sets is the interval $[0.6, 1.0]$. The minimal value of $d$ within this valid therapeutic range is therefore:\n$$\nd_{\\text{min}} = 0.6 \\text{ mg/kg/day}\n$$\n\n#### 2. Compute the Daily Starting Dose ($D_0$)\nThe second task is to compute the total daily starting dose, $D_0$, for the patient. This is calculated by multiplying the selected dose per body weight, $d_{\\text{min}}$, by the patient's mass, $m = 70$ $\\text{kg}$.\n$$\nD_0 = d_{\\text{min}} \\times m\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nD_0 = (0.6 \\text{ mg/kg/day}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg})\n$$\n$$\nD_0 = 42 \\text{ mg/day}\n$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $42$ is an integer with exactly two significant figures ($4$ and $2$). Therefore, no rounding is necessary.\n\n#### 3. Propose a Mathematically Specified Taper Schedule\nThe third task is to propose a tapering schedule, expressed as a piecewise recurrence relation $D_{n+1} = f(D_n)$, where $n$ represents the week of the taper. The schedule must be grounded in the principles of minimizing supraphysiologic exposure and using progressively smaller reductions as the dose approaches the physiologic range.\n\nLet $D_n$ be the daily prednisone dose in mg during week $n$ of the taper. The taper begins from the starting dose $D_0 = 42$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{day}$ after initial disease control is achieved (typically after $2$-$4$ weeks).\n\nThe proposed taper schedule is a piecewise function based on fractional weekly reductions, where the fractional reduction rate decreases as the dose decreases, consistent with clinical practice and endocrine principles.\n\n- **Clinical Rationale**: The HPA axis is more sensitive to changes at lower glucocorticoid doses. Rapid reductions in the near-physiologic range can precipitate adrenal insufficiency, while larger, more rapid reductions are generally safer at high supraphysiologic doses where the primary concern is cumulative toxicity. A larger proportional reduction at a higher dose still corresponds to a larger absolute reduction, which is desirable to quickly lower the total drug exposure.\n\n- **Taper Function**: The weekly dose $D_{n+1}$ is determined from the previous week's dose $D_n$ as follows:\n$$\nD_{n+1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n(1 - 0.25)D_n = 0.75 D_n, & \\text{if } D_n > 20 \\text{ mg/day} \\\\\n(1 - 0.20)D_n = 0.80 D_n, & \\text{if } 10 \\text{ mg/day} < D_n \\leq 20 \\text{ mg/day} \\\\\n(1 - 0.10)D_n = 0.90 D_n, & \\text{if } 5 \\text{ mg/day} < D_n \\leq 10 \\text{ mg/day}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis recurrence relation defines the dose reduction until the daily dose falls to or below the physiologic threshold.\n\n- **Transition to Physiologic Range and Discontinuation**: The physiologic replacement dose of prednisone is approximately $5$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{day}$. Once the calculated dose reaches this level, the protocol changes to allow for HPA axis recovery.\n1.  Let $N$ be the first week such that the dose calculated by the recurrence, $D_N$, is less than or equal to $5$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{day}$.\n2.  **Stabilization**: The dose is held constant at $D_N$ for a stabilization period of $4$ weeks. That is, $D_{N+k} = D_N$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n3.  **Discontinuation**: After the $4$-week stabilization period, the prednisone is discontinued, i.e., $D_{N+4} = 0$, provided there is no clinical evidence of disease relapse.\n\nThis completes the proposal for the tapering schedule as required. The final answer for this problem, however, is restricted to the numerical value of $D_0$.",
