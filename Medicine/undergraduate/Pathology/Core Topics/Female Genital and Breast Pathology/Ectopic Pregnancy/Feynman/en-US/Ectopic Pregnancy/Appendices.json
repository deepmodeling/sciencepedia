            "introduction": "To truly understand pathology, we must often look beyond biology to the underlying physical principles governing tissue behavior. Clinical observation tells us that ectopic pregnancies in the narrow isthmus of the fallopian tube tend to rupture earlier than those in the wider ampulla. This exercise invites you to explore the biomechanical reasons for this phenomenon by modeling the tubal segments as thin-walled cylinders. By applying fundamental concepts like Laplace’s law and Hooke’s law, you can derive a quantitative relationship between a tube's initial geometry and its rupture time, providing a powerful, physics-based explanation for a critical clinical pattern.

            "problem": "A thin-walled mechanical model of the Fallopian tube can be used to rationalize site-specific rupture in ectopic pregnancy by connecting internal pressure, geometry, tissue elasticity, and wall forces. Consider two tubal segments: the isthmus and the ampulla. Model each segment as a thin-walled cylindrical shell of initial inner radius $r_{0}$, wall thickness $h$, and distensible length $L$ that is subjected to a slowly increasing intraluminal volume due to a growing gestational sac. Assume small strains, linear elasticity with the same elastic modulus $E$ for both segments, identical material failure hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\text{fail}}$ for both segments, and negligible baseline pressure $P_{0} = 0$. The volume influx rate of the sac is constant at $\\alpha$.\n\nUse only fundamental definitions and well-tested formulas, specifically Laplace’s law for thin-walled cylinders and Hooke’s law for linear elastic materials, together with consistent geometric relations. At a given internal pressure $P$, the hoop tension per unit axial length is $T$, and the hoop stress is $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. Rupture occurs when $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ reaches $\\sigma_{\\text{fail}}$.\n\nParameter values:\n- Isthmus: $r_{0,\\mathrm{i}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mm}$, $h_{\\mathrm{i}} = 1.2~\\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{i}} = 20~\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ampulla: $r_{0,\\mathrm{a}} = 4.0~\\mathrm{mm}$, $h_{\\mathrm{a}} = 0.8~\\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{a}} = 40~\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Elastic modulus (same for both): $E = 1.0~\\mathrm{MPa}$, where megapascal (MPa) is the unit.\n- Failure hoop stress (same for both): $\\sigma_{\\text{fail}}$ (symbolic constant).\n- Growth rate: $\\alpha = 100~\\mathrm{mm}^{3}\\!/\\mathrm{day}$.\n- Reference pressure for tension comparison: $P_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10~\\mathrm{kPa}$, where kilopascal (kPa) is the unit.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using Laplace’s law for a thin-walled cylindrical tube, compute the ratio of hoop tensions per unit axial length $T_{\\mathrm{a}}/T_{\\mathrm{i}}$ between the ampulla and isthmus at the same internal pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n2. Starting from Hooke’s law and Laplace’s law, derive an expression for the compliance $C = dV/dP$ of a thin-walled cylindrical segment under small strain, expressed in terms of $r_{0}$, $h$, $L$, and $E$. Then use the compliance to obtain the rupture time $t_{\\mathrm{fail}}$ for each segment under constant volume influx rate $\\alpha$, and simplify the ratio $t_{\\mathrm{i}}/t_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\n\nProvide the final answer as the single numerical value of the ratio $t_{\\mathrm{i}}/t_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Express the ratio as a unitless decimal and round your answer to three significant figures. No other quantities should be reported in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The use of a thin-walled cylinder model is an explicit instruction and a standard simplification in biomechanics, thus the problem is internally consistent and solvable. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of rupture times, $t_{\\mathrm{i}}/t_{\\mathrm{a}}$, for the isthmus and ampulla segments of a Fallopian tube modeled as thin-walled elastic cylinders. To find this ratio, we must first derive an expression for the rupture time, $t_{\\mathrm{fail}}$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps:\n1.  Derive the compliance, $C = dV/dP$, of a cylindrical segment.\n2.  Determine the pressure at which rupture occurs, $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}$.\n3.  Combine these results with the constant volume influx rate, $\\alpha$, to find the rupture time, $t_{\\mathrm{fail}}$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of Compliance, $C$**\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \\pi r^2 L$, where $r$ is the internal radius and $L$ is the length. The compliance is $C = dV/dP$. Using the chain rule, this can be written as $C = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\frac{dr}{dP}$.\n\nThe term $\\frac{dV}{dr}$ is straightforward:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\pi r^2 L) = 2 \\pi r L\n$$\nTo find $\\frac{dr}{dP}$, we must relate the radius $r$ to the internal pressure $P$. This is achieved by combining Hooke's law for linear elasticity with Laplace's law for a thin-walled cylinder.\n\nHooke's law states that stress is proportional to strain: $\\sigma_{\\theta} = E \\epsilon_{\\theta}$, where $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is the hoop stress, $E$ is the elastic modulus, and $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ is the hoop strain. The hoop strain is the fractional change in circumference, which is equivalent to the fractional change in radius:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\frac{2\\pi r - 2\\pi r_0}{2\\pi r_0} = \\frac{r - r_0}{r_0}\n$$\nwhere $r_0$ is the initial, undeformed radius.\n\nLaplace's law for a thin-walled cylinder relates the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ to the pressure $P$, radius $r$, and wall thickness $h$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{h}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of \"small strains\". This implies that the change in radius, $r - r_0$, is small compared to $r_0$. Therefore, we can approximate the instantaneous radius $r$ in the stress formula with the initial radius $r_0$, as this introduces only a second-order error.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} \\approx \\frac{Pr_0}{h}\n$$\nEquating the expressions for $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ from Hooke's law and the approximated Laplace's law:\n$$\nE \\epsilon_{\\theta} = E \\frac{r - r_0}{r_0} \\approx \\frac{Pr_0}{h}\n$$\nWe can now express the radius $r$ as a function of pressure $P$:\n$$\nr(P) \\approx r_0 + \\frac{P r_0^2}{E h}\n$$\nThis linear relationship between $r$ and $P$ allows us to find $\\frac{dr}{dP}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dP} \\approx \\frac{r_0^2}{E h}\n$$\nNow we can assemble the expression for compliance, $C$. Consistent with the small strain assumption, we use $r \\approx r_0$ in the expression for $\\frac{dV}{dr}$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{dV}{dP} = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\frac{dr}{dP} \\approx (2 \\pi r_0 L) \\left(\\frac{r_0^2}{E h}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\pi r_0^3 L}{E h}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the compliance of the cylindrical segment under the small strain assumption.\n\n**Step 2: Determination of Failure Pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}$**\n\nRupture occurs when the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ reaches the material's failure stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{fail}}$. Let the pressure at this point be $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}$. Using our small-strain approximation for stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{fail}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{fail}} r_0}{h}\n$$\nSolving for the failure pressure gives:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fail}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fail}} h}{r_0}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Rupture Time, $t_{\\mathrm{fail}}$**\n\nThe volume of the gestational sac increases at a constant rate $\\alpha = dV/dt$. This means the added volume at time $t$ is $\\Delta V = \\alpha t$, assuming $V(0)$ corresponds to the initial state.\n\nThe compliance $C = dV/dP$ relates the change in volume to the change in pressure. Since we derived a constant compliance (independent of $P$), we can write $\\Delta V = C \\Delta P$. The pressure starts at $P_0 = 0$, so $\\Delta P = P(t)$.\n$$\n\\alpha t = C P(t)\n$$\nRupture occurs at $t = t_{\\mathrm{fail}}$ when $P(t_{\\mathrm{fail}}) = P_{\\mathrm{fail}}$.\n$$\n\\alpha t_{\\mathrm{fail}} = C P_{\\mathrm{fail}}\n$$\nSolving for the failure time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{fail}} = \\frac{C P_{\\mathrm{fail}}}{\\alpha}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $C$ and $P_{\\mathrm{fail}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{fail}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi r_0^3 L}{E h} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{fail}} h}{r_0} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression, we note that the wall thickness $h$ cancels out:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{fail}} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha} r_0^2 L\n$$\n\n**Final Step: Ratio of Rupture Times, $t_{\\mathrm{i}}/t_{\\mathrm{a}}$**\n\nWe can now write the rupture time for the isthmus (i) and the ampulla (a) using the derived formula:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha} r_{0,\\mathrm{i}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{i}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha} r_{0,\\mathrm{a}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{a}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\sigma_{\\text{fail}}$, $E$, and $\\alpha$ are the same for both segments. Therefore, the prefix term $\\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha}$ is a constant for both. When we take the ratio $t_{\\mathrm{i}}/t_{\\mathrm{a}}$, this term cancels out:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{i}}}{t_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha} r_{0,\\mathrm{i}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\frac{2 \\pi \\sigma_{\\text{fail}}}{E \\alpha} r_{0,\\mathrm{a}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{r_{0,\\mathrm{i}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{i}}}{r_{0,\\mathrm{a}}^2 L_{\\mathrm{a}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- Isthmus: $r_{0,\\mathrm{i}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{i}} = 20~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Ampulla: $r_{0,\\mathrm{a}} = 4.0~\\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{a}} = 40~\\mathrm{mm}$\n\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{i}}}{t_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{(2.0~\\mathrm{mm})^2 (20~\\mathrm{mm})}{(4.0~\\mathrm{mm})^2 (40~\\mathrm{mm})} = \\frac{(4.0~\\mathrm{mm}^2) (20~\\mathrm{mm})}{(16.0~\\mathrm{mm}^2) (40~\\mathrm{mm})} = \\frac{80~\\mathrm{mm}^3}{640~\\mathrm{mm}^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{i}}}{t_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{80}{640} = \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nAs a decimal, the ratio is $1/8 = 0.125$. The problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures, which $0.125$ already is.",

The validity must be assessed based on scientific and medical principles.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the established principles of obstetrics, gynecology, and emergency medicine. The combination of clinical signs (pain), vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension), laboratory values (hCG), and ultrasound findings (empty uterus, adnexal mass, hemoperitoneum) represents a classic presentation. The terminology is standard and accurate.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a coherent and sufficient set of data to arrive at a standard-of-care diagnosis and management plan. A unique, clinically appropriate solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity**: The data are presented as objective findings without subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n1.  **Scientific Unsoundness**: The findings are internally consistent and pathognomonic for a specific urgent medical condition. The hCG level of $2200\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ is above the widely accepted \"discriminatory zone\" (typically $1500-2000\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) for TVUS, above which an intrauterine gestational sac should be visible. Its absence strongly suggests an extrauterine pregnancy. The vital signs indicate hemodynamic instability. The ultrasound finding of echogenic fluid in the hepatorenal recess confirms significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This is a textbook presentation of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: The problem is a direct application of medical diagnostic reasoning.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory**: The data are sufficient and non-contradictory.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: The scenario is a common and realistic medical emergency.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: The question is clear and leads to a definitive course of action based on established clinical guidelines.\n6.  **Trivial/Tautological**: The problem requires the synthesis of multiple data streams (vitals, labs, imaging) to make a high-stakes decision, which is a non-trivial cognitive task.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The principles involved are evidence-based and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis can proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe clinical picture must be synthesized to form a diagnosis and guide management.\n\n1.  **Hemodynamic Status**: The patient exhibits tachycardia (heart rate $110$ bpm, normal is $60-100$ bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure $98/62\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$). These vital signs are indicative of hemodynamic instability, most likely secondary to acute blood loss leading to hypovolemia.\n\n2.  **Diagnostic Synthesis**: The triad of an empty uterus on TVUS, a serum hCG level above the discriminatory zone ($2200\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$), and an adnexal mass ($2.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ structure with an adnexal ring sign) is highly diagnostic of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n3.  **Assessment of Rupture**: The presence of echogenic free fluid on ultrasound in this context is evidence of hemoperitoneum (blood in the peritoneal cavity). The critical finding is the presence of this fluid in the hepatorenal recess (Morison's pouch). For fluid to accumulate in this superior abdominal location, a significant volume of hemorrhage must have occurred (clinically estimated to be at least $400-700\\,\\mathrm{mL}$). This finding, combined with the patient's hemodynamic instability, confirms the diagnosis of a **ruptured ectopic pregnancy**.\n\n4.  **Management Principle**: A ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening surgical emergency. The primary management goal is to promptly stop the hemorrhage. This requires immediate surgical intervention. Simultaneously, the patient must be resuscitated to correct the hypovolemic shock.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Label the case as a pregnancy of unknown location and arrange expectant management with serial hCG measurements and a repeat TVUS in $48$ hours.**\nA pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is defined as a situation with a positive pregnancy test but no signs of either an intra- or extrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound. This patient has a definitive sign of an extrauterine pregnancy (the adnexal mass with a ring sign) and, critically, evidence of rupture (hemoperitoneum in Morison's pouch and hemodynamic instability). Expectant management is only appropriate for a select group of hemodynamically stable patients with low and/or declining hCG levels and no evidence of rupture. For this patient, such a delay would be life-threatening.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Diagnose a tubal ectopic pregnancy with probable rupture; initiate emergent surgical management with diagnostic laparoscopy and preparedness for salpingectomy, while simultaneously resuscitating and preparing blood products.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes all the clinical data. It establishes the correct diagnosis (ruptured ectopic pregnancy, most commonly tubal). It proposes the correct, guideline-adherent management: emergent surgery to control hemorrhage (laparoscopy is the standard approach, with conversion to laparotomy if needed for stability or visibility) and simultaneous aggressive resuscitation to manage shock (IV fluids, ordering blood products). A salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) is the most likely definitive procedure given the rupture and hemorrhage.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Administer single-dose methotrexate intramuscularly and discharge with close outpatient follow-up for serial hCG monitoring.**\nMethotrexate is a folate antagonist used for the *medical* management of *unruptured* ectopic pregnancies. Its use has strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Absolute contraindications include hemodynamic instability and evidence of ectopic rupture, both of which are present in this patient. Administering methotrexate in this scenario would fail to address the active, life-threatening hemorrhage and would be a critical medical error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perform uterine curettage to exclude intrauterine pregnancy and defer definitive intervention until histopathological results are available.**\nUterine curettage to obtain tissue for histology (to look for chorionic villi) is a tool used to differentiate a failing intrauterine pregnancy from an ectopic pregnancy in a *hemodynamically stable patient* with an *equivocal* ultrasound. In this case, the diagnosis is not equivocal, and the patient is unstable. Delaying definitive surgical treatment to perform a diagnostic curettage would constitute gross malpractice, as it would allow continued intra-abdominal bleeding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Order a targeted Doppler ultrasound of uterine arteries to improve diagnostic specificity before intervention.**\nWhile color Doppler can sometimes be a useful adjunct in diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy (e.g., demonstrating a \"ring of fire\" sign of peritrophoblastic flow), it is not a required diagnostic criterion. The combination of B-mode ultrasound findings, hCG level, and vital signs in this case already provides a definitive diagnosis requiring immediate action. The patient's instability makes any delay for additional, non-essential imaging dangerous and inappropriate. The priority is resuscitation and transfer to the operating room.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
