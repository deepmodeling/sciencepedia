            "problem": "A central premise in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis is that demyelination and subsequent remyelination alter the geometry and electrical properties of myelinated axons, thereby changing conduction reliability. Consider saltatory conduction between two successive nodes of Ranvier in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Model the coupling from the upstream node to the downstream node as follows: the upstream node generates an action potential depolarization of amplitude $V_{\\text{ap}}$ above rest, maintained for a duration $T_{p}$, and the downstream node can be modeled as a pure capacitor with capacitance $C_{n}$. The internode between them is modeled as an axial resistor whose total resistance scales with internode length $L$ as $R_{\\text{ax}}(L) = R_{a} L$, where $R_{a}$ is the axial resistance per unit length. Assume that at $t=0$ the downstream nodal voltage is at rest and equal to $0$.\n\nUsing only the capacitor charge relation and Ohm’s law as fundamental starting points, construct the minimal circuit model and derive, from first principles, an analytic expression $S(L)$ for the safety factor for conduction, defined here as the ratio between the voltage achieved at the downstream node at $t=T_{p}$ and the threshold voltage $V_{\\text{th}}$ required to trigger a regenerative action potential at that node:\n$$\nS(L) = \\frac{V_{n}(T_{p})}{V_{\\text{th}}}.\n$$\nThen, to illustrate how remyelination that reduces internode length affects conduction reliability, compute the ratio of safety factors after remyelination to before remyelination,\n$$\n\\frac{S(L_{\\text{remyelinated}})}{S(L_{\\text{baseline}})},\n$$\nusing the following physiologically plausible parameter values:\n- $L_{\\text{baseline}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$,\n- $L_{\\text{remyelinated}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$,\n- $C_{n} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}$,\n- $R_{a} = 2.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\Omega/\\text{m}$,\n- $V_{\\text{ap}} = 0.10\\ \\text{V}$,\n- $V_{\\text{th}} = 0.020\\ \\text{V}$,\n- $T_{p} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $\\frac{S(L_{\\text{remyelinated}})}{S(L_{\\text{baseline}})}$ as a dimensionless number, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in a simplified but standard biophysical model of neural conduction, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the safety factor of saltatory conduction and its application to compare a baseline case with a remyelinated case. The model provided simplifies the complex biophysics into an electrical circuit.\n\nFirst, we construct the minimal circuit model based on the problem description. The upstream node of Ranvier, generating an action potential of amplitude $V_{\\text{ap}}$ for a duration $T_p$, acts as a voltage source. The internodal segment provides an axial resistance $R_{\\text{ax}}(L) = R_a L$. The downstream node of Ranvier is modeled as a capacitor with capacitance $C_n$. The voltage source, resistor, and capacitor are in series. The voltage across the capacitor, $V_n(t)$, represents the voltage at the downstream node. The initial condition is that the downstream node is at rest, meaning its voltage is $0$ at $t=0$, so $V_n(0)=0$.\n\nWe are asked to derive the behavior of this circuit from first principles, namely the capacitor charge relation and Ohm's law.\n\nThe charge $Q_n(t)$ on the capacitor $C_n$ at a voltage $V_n(t)$ is given by:\n$$\nQ_n(t) = C_n V_n(t)\n$$\nThe current $I(t)$ flowing into the capacitor is the rate of change of its charge:\n$$\nI(t) = \\frac{dQ_n(t)}{dt} = C_n \\frac{dV_n(t)}{dt}\n$$\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage drop across the resistor $R_{\\text{ax}}(L)$ is $V_R(t) = I(t) R_{\\text{ax}}(L)$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to the circuit loop, the voltage supplied by the source, $V_{\\text{ap}}$, must equal the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor and the capacitor:\n$$\nV_{\\text{ap}} = V_R(t) + V_n(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_R(t)$ and $I(t)$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{ap}} = I(t) R_{\\text{ax}}(L) + V_n(t)\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{ap}} = \\left(C_n \\frac{dV_n(t)}{dt}\\right) R_{\\text{ax}}(L) + V_n(t)\n$$\nRearranging this gives a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the voltage at the downstream node, $V_n(t)$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{ax}}(L) C_n \\frac{dV_n(t)}{dt} + V_n(t) = V_{\\text{ap}}\n$$\nThis is the standard equation for a charging RC circuit. The product $R_{\\text{ax}}(L) C_n$ is the time constant of the circuit, which we can denote as $\\tau(L)$.\nUsing the given relation $R_{\\text{ax}}(L) = R_a L$, the time constant is $\\tau(L) = R_a L C_n$.\n\nWe solve this differential equation with the initial condition $V_n(0) = 0$. The general solution for $V_n(t)$ is:\n$$\nV_n(t) = V_{\\text{ap}} + A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(L)}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant determined by the initial condition. At $t=0$:\n$$\nV_n(0) = V_{\\text{ap}} + A \\exp(0) = V_{\\text{ap}} + A\n$$\nSince $V_n(0) = 0$, we have $A = -V_{\\text{ap}}$.

Use the following fundamental facts in pathology to construct the appropriate index: because albumin is not synthesized within the central nervous system, its CSF-to-serum concentration ratio reflects blood–CSF barrier permeability, whereas IgG may be synthesized intrathecally in multiple sclerosis and therefore its CSF-to-serum ratio may exceed what barrier permeability alone would permit. By normalizing the CSF-to-serum IgG ratio to the CSF-to-serum albumin ratio, one can quantify the relative excess of IgG in the CSF attributable to intrathecal synthesis. Compute this normalized index using the data below and decide, based on a well-established decision criterion, whether intrathecal IgG synthesis is present.\n\nMeasured concentrations (expressed in grams per liter, g/L):\n- CSF IgG: $0.125$\n- Serum IgG: $12.0$\n- CSF albumin: $0.30$\n- Serum albumin: $42.0$\n\nAssume that intrathecal IgG synthesis is present if the normalized index exceeds $0.70$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical pathology, specifically the methodology for diagnosing multiple sclerosis via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous objective. The provided values are clinically plausible, and the terminology is precise.\n\nThe task is to compute the IgG Index, a normalized ratio used to detect intrathecal (within the central nervous system) synthesis of Immunoglobulin G (IgG). The principle is that while the concentration of albumin in the CSF relative to the serum is a reliable marker for the permeability of the blood–CSF barrier, the concentration of IgG may be elevated beyond what permeability alone would explain if there is local production within the CNS.\n\nThe IgG Index, which we shall denote as $I_{\\text{IgG}}$, is defined as the ratio of the CSF/serum IgG quotient to the CSF/serum albumin quotient. This normalization corrects for variations in blood–CSF barrier integrity.
