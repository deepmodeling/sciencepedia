            "problem": "Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (*HTT*). The number of repeats determines the clinical outcome. The classification of *HTT* alleles is as follows:\n- Normal alleles: Fewer than 27 CAG repeats.\n- Intermediate alleles: 27 to 35 CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles do not develop the disease but have an increased risk of having children with an expanded, disease-causing allele.\n- Reduced-penetrance alleles: 36 to 39 CAG repeats. Individuals may or may not develop the symptoms of Huntington's disease in their lifetime.\n- Full-penetrance alleles: 40 or more CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles will develop Huntington's disease, assuming they live a normal lifespan.\n\nA person undergoes genetic testing and is found to be heterozygous for the *HTT* gene, with one allele having 15 CAG repeats and the other having 42 CAG repeats. This individual's partner has also been tested and has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, respectively.\n\nAssuming simple Mendelian inheritance and that the number of repeats in these alleles is stable and does not change during gamete formation, calculate the probability that a child conceived by this couple will possess at least one full-penetrance *HTT* allele. Express your answer as a decimal.",
            "solution": "We represent the heterozygous individual’s alleles as one normal allele with 15 repeats and one full-penetrance allele with 42 repeats. Denote the full-penetrance allele as $F$ (42 repeats) and the normal allele as $N$ (15 repeats), so the genotype is $N/F$. The partner has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, which we denote collectively as normal alleles $N$, so the partner’s genotype is $N/N$.\n\nUnder simple Mendelian inheritance with stable repeat numbers and equal segregation, each parent contributes one allele to the child with equal probability from their two alleles. Therefore, the gametes from the $N/F$ parent are $N$ and $F$ with probabilities\n$$\nP(G_{1}=N)=\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(G_{1}=F)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe partner’s gametes are both normal, so\n$$\nP(G_{2}=\\text{normal})=1.\n$$\n\nA child will possess at least one full-penetrance allele if and only if it inherits the $F$ allele from the $N/F$ parent, because the partner has no full-penetrance alleles to contribute. Thus,\n$$\nP(\\text{child has at least one full-penetrance allele})=P(G_{1}=F)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nEquivalently, summing over the partner’s possible gametes,\n$$\nP(\\text{full})=\\sum_{g_{2}\\in\\{\\text{normal},\\text{normal}\\}} P(G_{2}=g_{2})\\,P(G_{1}=F)=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=1\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nExpressed as a decimal, this is $0.5$.",

            "introduction": "The pathology of Huntington's disease is not simply due to a broken gene, but rather the creation of a protein with a new, toxic function. This conceptual problem  challenges you to think critically about this distinction by considering a hypothetical mutation. By analyzing the outcome of a premature stop codon versus the canonical CAG repeat expansion, you can clearly differentiate between a loss-of-function and the specific toxic gain-of-function mechanism that drives neurodegeneration in HD.",
            "id": "2343277",
            "problem": "Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the *HTT* gene, which codes for the huntingtin protein. The canonical cause of HD is an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence within exon 1 of the *HTT* gene. This leads to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) containing an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. The resulting mHTT protein misfolds and aggregates, causing neuronal death through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism.\n\nConsider a hypothetical patient who undergoes genetic testing. The analysis reveals that they do not have the CAG repeat expansion. Instead, they have a rare single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 1 of one of their *HTT* alleles. This SNP changes a codon that normally codes for an amino acid into a premature stop codon. Critically, the location of this nonsense mutation is *upstream* of the CAG repeat region, meaning it appears earlier in the coding sequence than the repeats.\n\nAssuming this is the only mutation in the patient's *HTT* genes, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected molecular and pathological consequences?\n\nA. The resulting truncated huntingtin protein will lack the polyglutamine tract. This will lead to a loss of normal huntingtin function but will not cause the characteristic toxic aggregation seen in Huntington's disease.\n\nB. The premature stop codon will cause the spliceosome to skip exon 1 entirely during RNA processing, resulting in a protein that is functional but smaller, leading to no disease phenotype.\n\nC. The truncated protein will be highly unstable and aggregate even more rapidly than the expanded-polyglutamine version, leading to a more severe and rapidly progressing form of Huntington's disease.\n\nD. The nonsense mutation will trigger a compensatory mechanism that significantly increases the transcription of the normal *HTT* allele, completely preventing any potential disease symptoms.\n\nE. The cell's translational machinery will recognize the error and efficiently proofread the mRNA, leading to the consistent production of a normal, full-length huntingtin protein from the mutated allele.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to determine the consequences of a nonsense mutation located in exon 1 of the *HTT* gene, but *before* the CAG repeat region that is associated with Huntington's Disease (HD). To solve this, we must analyze the process of protein synthesis and contrast the mechanism of a nonsense mutation with the known toxic gain-of-function mechanism of HD.\n\n1.  **Understanding Protein Synthesis (The Central Dogma):** A gene's DNA sequence is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then translated by a ribosome into a protein. The ribosome reads the mRNA in three-nucleotide units called codons. Translation begins at a start codon (AUG) and ends when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is reached.\n\n2.  **Pathogenesis of Huntington's Disease:** HD is caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in the *HTT* gene. The codon CAG codes for the amino acid glutamine (Q). An expanded CAG repeat leads to a protein with a long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. This expanded polyQ tract causes the mutant huntingtin protein to misfold, aggregate, and gain a toxic function that kills neurons. This is a **toxic gain-of-function** mechanism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Hypothetical Mutation:** The patient in this scenario has a nonsense mutation, which is a point mutation that changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon. This mutation is located *upstream* of the CAG repeats.\n\n4.  **Tracing the Molecular Fate:**\n    -   The mutated *HTT* gene will be transcribed into an mRNA molecule that contains a premature stop codon.\n    -   During translation, the ribosome will bind to this mRNA and begin synthesizing the huntingtin protein from the start codon.\n    -   The ribosome will proceed along the mRNA until it encounters the premature stop codon.\n    -   At this point, translation will terminate, and the ribosome will release the incomplete polypeptide chain.\n    -   Crucially, because the premature stop codon is located *before* the CAG repeat region, the ribosome will never reach or translate the CAG repeats.\n\n5.  **Characterizing the Protein Product:** The protein produced from this mutated allele will be severely truncated. It will be missing the entire portion of the protein that is encoded downstream of the mutation site. This includes the region that would normally contain the polyglutamine tract. Therefore, the toxic element responsible for HD—the expanded polyQ tract—is not present in this protein product.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Consequences:**\n    -   **Gain-of-Function:** Since the toxic polyQ tract is not synthesized, the specific toxic gain-of-function that causes HD cannot occur. Therefore, this mutation will not cause Huntington's disease.\n    -   **Loss-of-Function:** The truncated protein is missing a large part of its structure and will almost certainly be non-functional or rapidly degraded by cellular quality control mechanisms (like nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). This represents a **loss-of-function** for that allele. While humans are generally healthy with only one functional copy of the *HTT* gene (i.e., heterozygous loss-of-function is typically asymptomatic), the mutation itself results in a non-functional product.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Multiple-Choice Options:**\n    -   **A:** This option correctly states that the truncated protein will lack the polyglutamine tract, thus preventing the toxic aggregation of HD. It also correctly identifies the outcome for the protein as a loss of function. This is the most accurate description.\n    -   **B:** This is incorrect. A nonsense mutation affects translation, not RNA splicing. The spliceosome acts on pre-mRNA to remove introns, and a stop codon within an exon does not typically cause the entire exon to be skipped.\n    -   **C:** This is incorrect. The toxicity in HD is specifically linked to the properties of the polyQ tract. A truncated protein lacking this tract has no reason to be even more aggregation-prone or toxic in the same manner.\n    -   **D:** This is incorrect. While complex regulatory feedback loops exist, there is no guaranteed, simple mechanism that causes the cell to perfectly compensate for a mutant allele by overexpressing the normal one to a degree that completely prevents any issues.\n    -   **E:** This is incorrect. Proofreading occurs primarily during DNA replication to fix errors in the DNA sequence. The translation machinery does not \"proofread\" and \"repair\" mRNA templates in this way. While a small amount of \"stop codon read-through\" can occur, it is an inefficient and error-prone process, not a reliable repair mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the mutation leads to a non-functional protein that cannot cause the toxic gain-of-function associated with Huntington's Disease.",

            "introduction": "The relationship between genotype and phenotype in Huntington's disease is more nuanced than a simple dominant/recessive model suggests. This exercise introduces a quantitative approach to understanding disease risk by modeling penetrance—the probability of expressing the disease—as a function of CAG repeat length . Using a logistic function, a common tool in biostatistics, you will explore how risk changes across a spectrum of repeat lengths, reflecting the threshold-like nature of HD's pathophysiology.",
            "id": "4793468",
            "problem": "Huntington disease is caused by an expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, with the number of repeats $L$ correlating with disease risk and age of onset. In pathophysiology, penetrance is the probability that an individual with a disease-associated genotype expresses the disease phenotype. Starting from the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed to ribonucleic acid (RNA) and translated to protein, the expanded CAG tract results in a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin protein that perturbs neuronal function and survival. Empirically, the relationship between the repeat length $L$ and penetrance can be well approximated by a sigmoidal function that captures a threshold-like transition and saturating behavior as mutant huntingtin toxicity overwhelms cellular resilience mechanisms.\n\nConsider a hypothetical logistic penetrance model defined by the function\n$$\nP(L)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\big(-k\\,(L-L_0)\\big)},\n$$\nwhere $P(L)$ is the penetrance as a function of CAG repeat length $L$, $k$ is a steepness parameter, and $L_0$ is the inflection point representing the threshold repeat length. Assume $k=0.5$ and $L_0=40$.\n\nUsing this model, compute $P(L)$ for $L=38$, $L=41$, and $L=45$. Express each penetrance value as a decimal (unitless probability) and round to four significant figures. Provide the final answers in the order $L=38$, $L=41$, $L=45$ as a single row matrix. Briefly interpret, in biological terms grounded in pathophysiology, how the differences among these penetrance values reflect the threshold behavior and progressive increase in disease risk with increasing CAG repeat length.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of penetrance values using a given logistic model and a subsequent biological interpretation of the results.\n\nThe provided logistic model for penetrance, $P(L)$, as a function of the number of CAG repeats, $L$, is:\n$$\nP(L) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(L - L_0))}\n$$\nThe parameters are given as the steepness constant, $k = 0.5$, and the inflection point or threshold repeat length, $L_0 = 40$. We are tasked to compute the penetrance for $L = 38$, $L = 41$, and $L = 45$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given parameters $k$ and $L_0$ into the model equation:\n$$\nP(L) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(L - 40))}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the penetrance, $P(L)$, for each specified value of $L$.\n\nCase 1: $L = 38$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(38 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(-2))}\n$$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(1)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(1) \\approx 2.71828$, we get:\n$$\nP(38) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 2.71828} = \\frac{1}{3.71828} \\approx 0.2689414\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(38) = 0.2689$.\n\nCase 2: $L = 41$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(41 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(1))}\n$$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653$, we get:\n$$\nP(41) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.60653} = \\frac{1}{1.60653} \\approx 0.6224593\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(41) = 0.6225$.\n\nCase 3: $L = 45$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(45 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(5))}\n$$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-2.5)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-2.5) \\approx 0.082085$, we get:\n$$\nP(45) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.082085} = \\frac{1}{1.082085} \\approx 0.9241418\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(45) = 0.9241$.\n\nBiological Interpretation:\nThe calculated penetrance values, $P(38) = 0.2689$, $P(41) = 0.6225$, and $P(45) = 0.9241$, illustrate the key pathophysiological features of Huntington disease risk as a function of CAG repeat length.\n\nThe model is centered around a threshold length $L_0 = 40$. For a repeat length of $L = 38$, which is below this threshold, the penetrance is relatively low ($P \\approx 27\\%$). This corresponds to the clinically observed \"reduced penetrance\" range, where an individual carrying the mutation has a substantial chance of not developing the disease phenotype within a typical lifespan. Pathophysiologically, this suggests that at this repeat length, cellular quality control mechanisms, such as protein folding chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, can still manage the burden of the misfolding-prone mutant huntingtin protein to some extent, preventing or delaying the onset of widespread neuronal dysfunction.\n\nFor a repeat length of $L = 41$, just one repeat unit above the threshold $L_0$, the penetrance increases sharply to $P \\approx 62\\%$. This steep rise is a characteristic feature of the sigmoidal model around its inflection point and accurately reflects the biological reality. A small increment in the length of the polyglutamine tract beyond a critical point leads to a dramatic increase in its propensity to aggregate and exert toxic effects, rapidly overwhelming cellular resilience. This demonstrates the threshold-like nature of the disease's onset.\n\nAt a repeat length of $L = 45$, well above the threshold, the penetrance is very high, $P \\approx 92\\%$, approaching full penetrance. This models the \"full penetrance\" allele range, where the development of the disease is almost certain. The high repeat number produces a severely toxic mutant protein that cellular defense mechanisms can no longer contain. This leads to inexorable neuronal damage and the manifestation of the disease phenotype. The saturating behavior of the logistic function for high $L$ reflects this ceiling effect, where risk cannot exceed $100\\%$.\n\nIn summary, the progression from $P(38)$ to $P(45)$ quantitatively captures the transition from incomplete to virtually complete disease penetrance as the CAG repeat length crosses and exceeds a critical pathogenic threshold, a hallmark of the pathophysiology of Huntington disease.",
