The given $pK_a$ value of $5.35$ for uric acid at body temperature is factually correct and widely accepted. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($pK_a$, $pH_1$, $pH_2$) to derive a unique expression and calculate a single, stable numerical answer. The language is objective and precise, using standard chemical terminology. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the fraction of uric acid present in its undissociated form, $HA$. Let this fraction be denoted by $\\alpha_{HA}$. The total concentration of uric acid species in solution, $[Total]$, is the sum of the concentrations of the undissociated acid $[HA]$ and the dissociated urate anion $[A^-]$.\n$$ [Total] = [HA] + [A^-] $$\nThe fraction $\\alpha_{HA}$ is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the undissociated acid to the total concentration:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[Total]} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^-]} $$\nTo express this fraction as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we use the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for the equilibrium $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} $$\nFrom this expression, we can solve for the concentration of the urate anion, $[A^-]$:\n$$ [A^-] = K_a \\frac{[HA]}{[H^+]} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[A^-]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha_{HA}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + K_a \\frac{[HA]}{[H^+]}} $$\nWe can factor out $[HA]$ from the denominator, which then cancels with the numerator:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA]\\left(1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}} $$\nThis expression relates the fraction $\\alpha_{HA}$ to $[H^+]$ and $K_a$. To express it in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we use the definitions $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. An elegant way to do this is to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is derived from the $K_a$ expression:\n$$ pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) $$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of the concentrations of the base to the acid:\n$$ pH - pK_a = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) \\implies \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{pH - pK_a} $$\nReturning to the definition of $\\alpha_{HA}$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{\\frac{[HA]}{[HA]}}{\\frac{[HA]}{[HA]} + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the final desired expression for the fraction of undissociated acid:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA}(pH, pK_a) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} $$\nThis expression gives the fraction of the undissociated acid $HA$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the fold-change ratio, $R$, of this fraction at $pH_1 = 5.2$ compared to $pH_2 = 6.0$, given $pK_a = 5.35$. The ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\alpha_{HA}(pH_1, pK_a)}{\\alpha_{HA}(pH_2, pK_a)} $$\nLet's calculate the two fractions.\nThe fraction at $pH_1 = 5.2$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA,1} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.2 - 5.35}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.15}} $$\nThe fraction at $pH_2 = 6.0$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{HA,2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{6.0 - 5.35}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.65}} $$\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\alpha_{HA,1}}{\\alpha_{HA,2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.15}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.65}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{0.65}}{1 + 10^{-0.15}} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we calculate the powers of $10$:\n$$ 10^{0.65} \\approx 4.4668359 $$\n$$ 10^{-0.15} \\approx 0.7079458 $$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{1 + 4.4668359}{1 + 0.7079458} = \\frac{5.4668359}{1.7079458} \\approx 3.200833 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 3.20 $$\nThis means that the relative amount of poorly soluble, undissociated uric acid is approximately $3.20$ times higher at $pH = 5.2$ than at $pH = 6.0$, highlighting the critical role of urinary $pH$ in the risk of uric acid stone formation.",

Calcium Phosphate ($CaP$) Supersaturation Ratio**\n\nThe supersaturation of calcium phosphate (as brushite) is defined as $S_{\\mathrm{CaP},i} = \\mathrm{IAP}_{\\mathrm{CaP},i} / K_{sp,\\mathrm{CaP}}$. The ion activity product is $\\text{IAP}_{\\text{CaP},i} \\approx [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}[\\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i}$.\n\nThe calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$, is the same as before and is proportional to $1/V_i$. We must now determine the concentration of the dibasic phosphate ion, $[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i}$.\nThe total molar concentration of all phosphate species, $[\\mathrm{P}]_{\\mathrm{total},i}$, is given by:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{P}]_{\\mathrm{total},i} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times 10^{-3}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}} V_i}\n$$\nThis total phosphate is distributed among different protonated species ($\\mathrm{H}_{3}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, $\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$). The fraction of total phosphate present as $\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ is denoted $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}$.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} [\\mathrm{P}]_{\\mathrm{total},i}\n$$\nThis fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}$ is determined by the urine $pH$ and the acid dissociation constants of phosphoric acid. The problem specifies the relevant equilibrium is $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$ with $pK_{a2} = 7.21$. At the given $pH=6.0$, the dominant species are $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$ and $\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, so we can approximate $[\\mathrm{P}]_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx [\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]$. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates their ratio:\n$$\npH = pK_{a2} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}]}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $R = [\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]/[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}]$ is therefore $R = 10^{pH - pK_{a2}}$. The fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]} = \\frac{R[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}] + R[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}]} = \\frac{R}{1+R} = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_{a2}}}{1+10^{pH - pK_{a2}}}\n$$\nSince both $pH$ and $pK_{a2}$ are constant in this problem, the fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}$ is also a constant, independent of urine volume $V_i$.\nTherefore, the concentration of the dibasic phosphate ion is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} [\\mathrm{P}]_{\\mathrm{total},i} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} \\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times 10^{-3}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}} V_i}\\right)\n$$\nLike all other solutes, $[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i} \\propto 1/V_i$.\nThe ion activity product for CaP at state $i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{IAP}_{\\mathrm{CaP},i} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}[\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}]_{i} = \\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\times 10^{-3}}{M_{\\mathrm{Ca}} V_{i}}\\right) \\left(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times 10^{-3}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}} V_i}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}(E_{\\mathrm{Ca}} \\times 10^{-3})(E_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times 10^{-3})}{M_{\\mathrm{Ca}} M_{\\mathrm{P}}} \\frac{1}{V_i^2}\n$$\nThe supersaturation is $S_{\\mathrm{CaP},i} = \\mathrm{IAP}_{\\mathrm{CaP},i} / K_{sp,\\mathrm{CaP}}$. We form the ratio $S_{\\mathrm{CaP},2} / S_{\\mathrm{CaP},1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{CaP},2}}{S_{\\mathrm{CaP},1}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{sp,\\mathrm{CaP}}} \\left( \\frac{\\cdots}{\\cdots} \\right) \\frac{1}{V_2^2}}{\\frac{1}{K_{sp,\\mathrm{CaP}}} \\left( \\frac{\\cdots}{\\cdots} \\right) \\frac{1}{V_1^2}} = \\frac{1/V_2^2}{1/V_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^2\n$$\nBoth ratios simplify to the same expression.\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nGiven $V_{1} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{L/day}$ and $V_{2} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{L/day}$, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1.0}{2.5}\\right)^2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1600$. This value is the same for both $S_{\\mathrm{CaOx},2}/S_{\\mathrm{CaOx},1}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{CaP},2}/S_{\\mathrm{CaP},1}$. The final answer should be presented as a row matrix.",
