This exercise  walks you through a fundamental calculation in immuno-oncology: estimating the number of potential neoantigens a tumor might present based on its Tumor Mutational Burden ($TMB$). By applying basic probability to genomic data, you will see how a widely used clinical biomarker directly translates into the potential antigenic landscape that cytotoxic T cells can recognize.",

            "problem": "A solid tumor from a patient is sequenced across the entire diploid genome. The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is reported as $12$ somatic mutations per megabase ($12$ mutations/Mb) over the interrogated sequence. The total haploid genome size is $3$ gigabases ($3$ Gb), and for this calculation you may model the effective interrogated length as $3{,}000$ megabases ($3{,}000$ Mb). Consider that a somatic mutation can, with some probability, lead to a new peptide that is processed, transported, and stably displayed by the patient’s Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules, thereby forming a presented neoantigen recognizable by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Let the effective yield of such high-affinity, presented binders per mutation be $y$, which encapsulates the combined probabilities of being a protein-altering event, generating a peptide containing the novel residue, proteasomal liberation of that peptide, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) delivery, and stable binding to the patient’s HLA repertoire. Assume $y = 1\\%$ and that each mutation independently contributes at most one candidate peptide to this process.\n\nStarting only from core definitions and well-tested principles—specifically, that tumor mutational burden is the number of somatic mutations per unit length of interrogated genome, and that the expected number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials of success probability $p$ is $np$—derive the expected number of presented neoantigens for this patient. Express your final answer as a plain count with no units. No rounding is required; give the exact integer.",
            "solution": "The problem will be validated by first extracting the given data and principles, then assessing its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), denoted here as $T$: $12$ mutations/Mb.\n- Effective interrogated genome length, denoted as $L$: $3{,}000$ Mb.\n- Effective yield of presented high-affinity neoantigens per mutation, denoted as $y$: $1\\%$.\n- Model assumption: Each mutation is an independent event contributing at most one candidate peptide.\n- Core Principle 1: TMB is defined as the number of somatic mutations per unit length of the interrogated genome.\n- Core Principle 2: The expected number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$ is $np$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of cancer immunology and bioinformatics. Tumor Mutational Burden is a standard clinical biomarker, and the concept of mutations leading to neoantigens that can be presented by HLA molecules is a cornerstone of immuno-oncology. The provided values, such as a TMB of $12$ mutations/Mb and a yield of $1\\%$, are scientifically plausible and fall within ranges observed in research and clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and a clear objective. There is no ambiguity in the definitions or the quantities provided. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing information, unrealistic conditions). The structure is logical and guides a calculation based on fundamental definitions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to calculate the expected number of presented neoantigens. This will be accomplished in two sequential steps as dictated by the problem's structure.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of somatic mutations in the interrogated portion of the tumor genome. Let $N_{mut}$ represent this total number. According to the provided definition, the total number of mutations is the product of the tumor mutational burden ($T$) and the effective interrogated length ($L$).\n\n$$N_{mut} = T \\times L$$\n\nThe givens are $T = 12 \\text{ mutations/Mb}$ and $L = 3{,}000 \\text{ Mb}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n\n$$N_{mut} = 12 \\frac{\\text{mutations}}{\\text{Mb}} \\times 3{,}000 \\text{ Mb}$$\n\nThe units of megabases (Mb) cancel, yielding a dimensionless count of mutations:\n\n$$N_{mut} = 12 \\times 3{,}000 = 36{,}000$$\n\nThus, there are a total of $36{,}000$ somatic mutations in the sequenced portion of the tumor.\n\nSecond, we determine the expected number of these mutations that result in a presented neoantigen. The problem states that each mutation is an independent event and can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial.\n- The number of independent trials, $n$, corresponds to the total number of mutations, so $n = N_{mut} = 36{,}000$.\n- The probability of success for any given trial, $p$, is the effective yield, $y$. The given yield is $y = 1\\%$. This probability must be expressed as a dimensionless number for calculation:\n\n$$p = y = 1\\% = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\nThe problem explicitly directs us to use the formula for the expected value of a binomial distribution, which is the sum of expectations of the individual Bernoulli trials. For $n$ trials with success probability $p$, the expected number of successes, denoted here as $E[N_{neo}]$, is:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = n \\times p$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $n$ and $p$:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = 36{,}000 \\times 0.01$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final result:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = 360$$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of presented neoantigens for this patient is $360$.",

            "problem": "A solid tumor biopsy is evaluated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which shows weak membranous staining for Human Leukocyte Antigen A (HLA-A). Targeted sequencing reveals a truncating mutation in $\\beta_2$-microglobulin (B2M).

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness and logical consistency.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A solid tumor biopsy is evaluated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n- IHC shows weak membranous staining for Human Leukocyte Antigen A (HLA-A).\n- Targeted sequencing reveals a truncating mutation in $\\beta_2$-microglobulin (B2M).\n- The question asks for the most likely net effect on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I surface expression and Natural Killer (NK) cell responses.\n- The analysis must use the core definitions of MHC class I assembly and NK cell missing-self recognition.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness:** The premises are based on fundamental principles of cellular immunology and molecular biology.\n    -   The structure of MHC class I molecules as a heterodimer of a heavy chain (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and a light chain, $\\beta_2$-microglobulin (B2M), is a cornerstone of immunology.\n    -   A \"truncating mutation\" in the gene encoding B2M is a well-understood genetic defect that leads to a non-functional or absent protein.\n    -   The requirement of B2M for the proper folding, stabilization, and cell surface trafficking of MHC class I heavy chains is a well-established biological fact.\n    -   The roles of MHC class I in presenting antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and in inhibiting NK cells via the \"missing-self\" mechanism are central tenets of tumor immunology.\n2.  **Well-Posed and Complete:** The problem provides a specific genetic lesion (truncating B2M mutation) and a corresponding phenotypic observation (weak HLA-A staining). It then asks for the logical downstream consequences on two well-defined immune processes (CTL and NK cell responses). The necessary information is present and unambiguous, allowing for a unique and logical deduction. The scenario described, loss of B2M as a mechanism for tumor immune evasion, is a clinically relevant and frequently observed phenomenon.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n1.  **MHC Class I Assembly and the Role of B2M**: A functional MHC class I molecule on the cell surface is a heterotrimer composed of three parts: an $\\alpha$ heavy chain (in humans, this is HLA-A, B, or C), a peptide antigen (typically 8-10 amino acids long), and the invariant light chain, $\\beta_2$-microglobulin (B2M). The assembly is a sequential process within the endoplasmic reticulum. The heavy chain must first bind to B2M to achieve a stable conformation. This dimer then gets loaded with a peptide. Only this fully assembled, stable trimeric complex is permitted to traffic to the cell surface. The B2M light chain is therefore absolutely essential for the surface expression of **all** classical MHC class I heavy chains (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C).\n\n2.  **Consequence of a Truncating B2M Mutation**: A \"truncating mutation\" (e.g., a nonsense or frameshift mutation) in the *B2M* gene will result in the production of a non-functional, truncated B2M protein, or no protein at all due to nonsense-mediated decay of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Without a functional B2M protein, the MHC class I heavy chains (HLA-A, B, and C) cannot fold correctly, cannot be loaded with peptide, and are retained and degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum. The direct consequence is a profound, global downregulation or complete loss of all MHC class I molecules from the tumor cell surface. The finding of \"weak membranous staining for HLA-A\" is the expected experimental observation for this molecular defect.\n\n3.  **Effect on Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Recognition**: CTLs use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize specific peptide antigens presented by MHC class I molecules on the surface of target cells. If the tumor cells have lost their surface MHC class I expression, they can no longer present tumor-associated antigens to CTLs. This makes the tumor cells \"invisible\" to the adaptive T-cell mediated immune response. Therefore, recognition by CTLs will be severely impaired.\n\n4.  **Effect on Natural Killer (NK) Cell Response**: NK cells express a variety of inhibitory receptors, such as Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs), which recognize MHC class I molecules on healthy cells. This interaction delivers a potent inhibitory signal that prevents the NK cell from killing the healthy cell. This is the \"self\" signal. When a tumor cell loses its MHC class I expression, this inhibitory signal is also lost. This lack of inhibition is known as \"missing-self\". The balance of signals at the NK cell synapse is tipped towards activation (assuming activating ligands are present, which is common on tumor cells), leading to NK cell degranulation and killing of the tumor cell. Therefore, the loss of MHC class I on the tumor cell surface will lead to enhanced NK cell activation.\n\n**Conclusion**: The B2M mutation will cause markedly reduced or absent surface MHC class I, which in turn impairs CTL recognition but enhances NK cell activation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Markedly reduced or absent MHC class I surface expression due to loss of $\\beta_2$-microglobulin, impaired recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and enhanced NK cell activation via missing-self.**\nThis option correctly states all three consequences derived from first principles. The loss of B2M leads to reduced/absent MHC class I expression. The lack of MHC class I impairs CTL recognition and, via the missing-self mechanism, enhances NK cell activation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Normal MHC class I surface expression maintained, continued inhibition of NK cells by intact MHC class I, and preserved CTL recognition.**\nThis option is incorrect on all points. A truncating mutation in B2M is functionally catastrophic and will prevent normal MHC class I surface expression. Consequently, NK cells will be activated (not inhibited) and CTL recognition will be impaired (not preserved).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Increased MHC class I surface expression driven by interferon-$\\gamma$ signaling, reduced NK activation, and enhanced CTL responses.**\nThis option is incorrect. While interferon-$\\gamma$ ($IFN-\\gamma$) is a powerful inducer of the antigen presentation pathway, it cannot correct a fundamental genetic defect. A cell with a non-functional B2M gene cannot produce stable MHC class I complexes even in the presence of $IFN-\\gamma$. Therefore, expression will not increase, NK activation will not be reduced, and CTL responses will not be enhanced.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Absent heavy-chain messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) leads to reduced NK activation because NK cells require MHC class I to activate, while CTLs become more effective because tumor antigens are unmasked.**\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors. First, the mutation is in B2M, not the heavy-chain gene, so there is no reason to assume absent heavy-chain mRNA. Second, NK cells are activated by the *absence* of MHC class I (missing-self), not its presence. The claim that they require MHC class I to activate is false in this context. Third, CTLs are rendered *less* effective, not more, because they absolutely require MHC class I to recognize antigens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Loss confined to HLA-A is compensated by HLA-B and HLA-C, resulting in unchanged MHC class I surface levels and unchanged NK responses despite the B2M truncation.**\nThis option is incorrect because it misunderstands MHC class I structure. B2M is a common subunit for *all* classical MHC class I molecules (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C). Therefore, the loss of B2M affects all of them; there can be no compensation by HLA-B and HLA-C. Total MHC class I levels will be drastically reduced, and NK responses will be enhanced, not unchanged.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
