            "problem": "A lymph node excision from a 38-year-old individual with painless cervical lymphadenopathy shows on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections a partially nodular architecture. The nodules are composed predominantly of small mature lymphocytes with rare eosinophils and histiocytes. Scattered within the nodules are large atypical mono- and binucleated cells with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and perinucleolar clearing, consistent with Reed–Sternberg (RS) cells and their variants. There are no thick collagen bands and no prominent necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on the large atypical cells demonstrates $CD30^+$, $CD15^+$, weak $PAX5^+$, $CD20^-$, $CD45^-$, $EMA^-$, and $ALK^-$. Epstein–Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization is negative in the large cells. The background small lymphocytes are predominantly B cells that are $CD20^+$ and $PAX5^+$.\n\nUsing the following foundational facts as your starting point:\n- Immunophenotypic markers identify lineage and activation state: PAX5 indicates B-cell lineage commitment; CD20 and CD45 are pan–B-cell and pan-leukocyte markers, respectively; CD30 and CD15 are activation-associated antigens frequently expressed on classical Reed–Sternberg cells.\n- In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), RS cells derive from germinal center B cells but exhibit attenuation of the B-cell transcriptional program, typically showing $CD30^+$, $CD15^+$, weak $PAX5^+$, and lack of CD20 and CD45. In nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), the neoplastic “lymphocyte predominant (LP)” cells retain B-cell identity, characteristically $CD20^+$, $CD45^+$, strong $PAX5^+$, and are usually $CD30^-$ and $CD15^-$.\n- Subclassification of cHL relies on background composition and architecture: lymphocyte-rich cHL features a lymphocyte-predominant background (often nodular) with scarce eosinophils and classical RS cells, whereas mixed cellularity cHL shows abundant eosinophils and histiocytes in a diffuse background and frequently lacks a nodular pattern.\n- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell lymphoma that is $CD30^+$ but typically $PAX5^-$, often $EMA^+$, variably $ALK^+$ or $ALK^-$, and usually $CD45^+$.\n\nWhich diagnosis best integrates the morphology and immunophenotype?\n\nA. Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nB. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nC. T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma\n\nD. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative\n\nE. Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma",
            "solution": "Begin by aligning the immunophenotype with lineage and disease categories based on first principles of immunohistochemistry and disease definitions. The large atypical cells are $CD30^+$ and $CD15^+$, with weak $PAX5^+$ and loss of pan–B-cell (CD20) and pan-leukocyte (CD45) markers. PAX5 is a B-cell lineage transcription factor, so weak $PAX5^+$ supports a B-cell derivation, but the absence of CD20 and CD45 indicates attenuation of typical B-cell and leukocyte antigen expression. This constellation—$CD30^+$, $CD15^+$, weak $PAX5^+$, $CD20^-$, $CD45^-$—is characteristic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), reflecting the known biology that classical Reed–Sternberg (RS) cells derive from germinal center B cells but downregulate the B-cell program.\n\nNext, integrate morphology to subclassify within cHL. The histology shows a predominantly lymphocyte-rich background with a nodular pattern, rare eosinophils and histiocytes, and scattered classic RS cells. These features support lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma as opposed to mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which classically shows a diffuse architecture with numerous eosinophils and histiocytes and often lacks a nodular pattern.\n\nNow analyze each option:\n\nA. Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This aligns with both immunophenotype and morphology. The RS cell immunoprofile ($CD30^+$, $CD15^+$, weak $PAX5^+$, $CD20^-$, $CD45^-$) is prototypical for cHL. The nodular, lymphocyte-predominant background with few eosinophils and absence of sclerosis fits the lymphocyte-rich subtype of cHL. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). In NLPHL, the neoplastic LP (“popcorn”) cells retain B-cell antigens: they are typically $CD20^+$, $CD45^+$, $BCL6^+$, $OCT2^+$, $BOB1^+$, strongly $PAX5^+$, and usually $CD30^-$ and $CD15^-$. The case shows the opposite pattern in the large cells ($CD30^+$, $CD15^+$, $CD20^-$, $CD45^-$, weak $PAX5^+$), and the morphology includes classic RS cells rather than LP cells. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL). THRLBCL has scattered large neoplastic B cells that are $CD20^+$, $CD45^+$, and strongly $PAX5^+$ amid abundant T cells and histiocytes; CD30 expression is not a defining feature. The immunophenotype here lacks CD20 and CD45 on the large cells and shows $CD30^+$ and $CD15^+$, favoring cHL rather than THRLBCL. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative (ALCL, $ALK^-$). ALCL is a T-cell lymphoma in which large neoplastic cells are $CD30^+$ and often $EMA^+$, typically $PAX5^-$, and usually $CD45^+$. The large cells in this case are $EMA^-$, $PAX5^+$ (even if weak), and $CD45^-$, which argues against ALCL. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma. While the immunophenotype is compatible with cHL, the morphology does not match: mixed cellularity cHL features a diffuse background rich in eosinophils and histiocytes and typically lacks a nodular, lymphocyte-rich pattern. The described nodular, lymphocyte-predominant background with rare eosinophils supports the lymphocyte-rich subtype instead. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, integrating fundamental immunophenotypic principles with morphologic subclassification, the best diagnosis is lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.",

            "solution": "The problem statement presents a comprehensive and internally consistent clinical case of a patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The provided data are sufficient and relevant for determining the clinical stage, bulky status, and appropriate initial treatment intent based on established oncological principles. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. Therefore, a full analysis can proceed.\n\n### Analysis of the Clinical Case\n\nThe solution requires a step-by-step application of standard diagnostic and staging criteria for classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n#### 1. Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma is unequivocally established by the excisional biopsy findings. The presence of classic Reed-Sternberg cells within a mixed inflammatory milieu is the histological hallmark. This is confirmed by the immunohistochemical staining profile: positive for cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) and cluster of differentiation 15 (CD15), and negative for leukocyte common antigen (CD45). This profile is pathognomonic for the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n#### 2. Staging (Ann Arbor System with Cotswolds Modifications)\nStaging determines the extent of the disease and is critical for treatment planning.\n\n*   **Anatomic Stage:** The patient has hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in the left supraclavicular region and the mediastinum. Both of these lymph node regions are located above the diaphragm. According to the Ann Arbor staging system, the involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm constitutes **Stage II** disease. The Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan confirms that there is no disease below the diaphragm and no diffuse involvement of extralymphatic organs. The negative bone marrow biopsy further confirms the absence of Stage IV disease.\n\n*   **Symptom Designation (A/B):** The patient reports intermittent fever, drenching night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. The presence of any of the following systemic \"B symptoms\" warrants a 'B' designation:\n    1.  Unexplained fever with a temperature above $38^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.\n    2.  Drenching night sweats.\n    3.  Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the 6 months before diagnosis.\n    The patient has fever and drenching night sweats. Although the reported weight loss of approximately 5% does not meet the formal criterion, the presence of the other two B symptoms is sufficient. Therefore, the patient is symptomatic, and the full stage is **Stage IIB**.\n\n#### 3. Bulky Disease Status\nThe Cotswolds modifications to the Ann Arbor system introduced the concept of \"bulky\" disease, which is an adverse prognostic factor. For mediastinal disease, bulky status is commonly defined as a mass with a maximal dimension of $\\geq 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ or a mediastinal mass ratio greater than one-third of the intrathoracic diameter.\n*   The patient's mediastinal mass measures $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in maximal dimension.\n*   Since $9\\ \\mathrm{cm} < 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and no information on the thoracic ratio is given, the disease is classified as **non-bulky** based on the provided data.\n\n#### 4. Treatment Intent and Strategy\nHodgkin lymphoma, especially in a young patient (age 28) with limited-stage disease (even if unfavorable), is a highly curable malignancy. The primary treatment intent is therefore **curative**. Palliative therapy is reserved for cases of relapse/refractory disease or for patients unable to tolerate curative treatment, none of which apply here.\n\nThe patient has early-stage (Stage IIB) but unfavorable disease due to the presence of B symptoms. For unfavorable early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard of care is **combined-modality therapy (CMT)**. This typically involves a defined number of cycles of a multiagent chemotherapy regimen (such as ABVD: Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) followed by consolidative involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT) to the initially involved nodal regions. Radiotherapy alone is not a standard option for Stage IIB disease.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n*   **Stage:** Stage IIB\n*   **Bulky Status:** Non-bulky\n*   **Treatment:** Curative-intent combined-modality therapy (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy)\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Stage $IIA$ non-bulky; palliative radiotherapy because of mediastinal involvement**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. The patient has B symptoms (fever, night sweats), which defines the stage as IIB, not IIA.\n*   **Bulky Status:** \"Non-bulky\" is correct.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. The treatment intent is curative, not palliative. Radiotherapy alone is not the standard of care for Stage IIB disease.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Stage $IIB$ bulky; aggressive palliative chemotherapy due to systemic symptoms**\n*   **Stage:** \"Stage IIB\" is correct.\n*   **Bulky Status:** Incorrect. The $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ mass does not meet the $\\geq 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ criterion for bulky disease.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. The treatment intent is curative, not palliative. Using the term \"palliative\" for first-line therapy in this context is a fundamental error.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Stage $IIB$ non-bulky; curative combined-modality therapy with multiagent chemotherapy plus involved-site radiotherapy**\n*   **Stage:** Correct. The patient has Stage II disease with B symptoms.\n*   **Bulky Status:** Correct. The $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ mass is non-bulky.\n*   **Treatment:** Correct. The intent is curative, and the standard treatment for unfavorable early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is combined-modality therapy involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Stage $IIIB$; curative radiotherapy alone, given contiguous nodal spread**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. Stage III requires lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm. This patient's disease is confined above the diaphragm.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. Radiotherapy alone is inadequate for Stage IIB disease, and certainly for Stage IIIB. The primary modality would be chemotherapy.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Stage $IVB$; palliative corticosteroids with observation**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. Stage IV requires disseminated involvement of extralymphatic organs, which was ruled out by PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. This approach is grossly inappropriate and contradicts all established guidelines for treating a curable cancer. It would be considered malpractice.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

You are asked to construct a diagnostic decision tree, using only Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers CD30, CD15, CD20, Paired Box 5 (PAX5), and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA), that minimizes the risk of misclassifying lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (LR-cHL) as nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Base your reasoning on the following widely accepted facts: classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is defined by neoplastic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells that typically express CD30, often CD15, show weak B-cell transcription factor expression with weak PAX5 staining, and are usually negative or only weakly positive for CD20 and negative for EMA; NLPHL is defined by neoplastic lymphocyte predominant (LP, “popcorn”) cells that retain a B-cell program with strong PAX5 and strong CD20, are typically negative for CD30 and CD15, and frequently express EMA.

Begin by assessing CD30 and CD15 on the large atypical cells. If either CD30 or CD15 is positive in the neoplastic cells, proceed to PAX5 and CD20: weak PAX5 with negative or weak CD20 and EMA negativity supports cHL (including LR-cHL), even if background B cells are strongly CD20 positive.

The immunophenotypes provided for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) are consistent with established hematopathology knowledge (e.g., WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues). The markers listed (CD30, CD15, CD20, PAX5, EMA) constitute a standard immunohistochemical panel for this specific differential diagnosis. The clinical scenario presented—a lymphocyte-rich, nodular infiltrate with large atypical cells—is the classic setting where distinguishing LR-cHL from NLPHL is a critical and often challenging task.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the *best* decision tree from a set of options to achieve a clearly defined objective (minimize a specific misclassification) based on a given set of facts. This allows for a unique, logical solution by evaluating each option against the provided immunophenotypic rules.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is objective. It presents accepted immunophenotypic profiles as \"facts\" and asks for a logical algorithm based on them. The language is precise and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe primary goal is to minimize the misclassification of lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (LR-cHL) as nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Since LR-cHL is a subtype of cHL, its neoplastic RS cells will exhibit the typical cHL immunophenotype. Let us construct an ideal diagnostic algorithm based on the provided facts.\n\n**Summary of Neoplastic Cell Immunophenotypes:**\n-   **LR-cHL**: CD30(+), CD15(often +), PAX5(weak +), CD20(-/weak +), EMA(-)\n-   **NLPHL**: CD30(-), CD15(-), PAX5(strong +), CD20(strong +), EMA(freq +)\n\nThe most definitive way to distinguish the two entities is to focus on the markers that show a clear positive/negative or strong/weak dichotomy. The classic Hodgkin markers, CD30 and CD15, are positive in cHL and negative in NLPHL. Conversely, the B-cell markers, CD20 and PAX5, are strongly expressed in NLPHL but are weak or absent in cHL. A robust decision tree should leverage these primary differences.\n\nAn optimal algorithm would be:\n1.  First, test for the canonical markers of cHL, CD30 and CD15, on the large atypical cells. Positivity for either strongly suggests cHL.\n2.  If CD30 or CD15 is positive, proceed to confirm cHL and rule out NLPHL by checking B-cell markers. The expected finding for cHL is weak PAX5 and negative or weak CD20 expression in the neoplastic cells. EMA should be negative.\n3.  If CD30 and CD15 are negative, this points towards NLPHL. This diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating strong expression of PAX5 and CD20 in the neoplastic cells. Frequent EMA positivity provides further support.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that a case of cHL, which by definition is typically CD30 positive, is not misdiagnosed as NLPHL, which is typically CD30 negative. Now, we evaluate the given options against this logic.\n\n**Option A: Begin by assessing CD30 and CD15 on the large atypical cells. If either CD30 or CD15 is positive in the neoplastic cells, proceed to PAX5 and CD20: weak PAX5 with negative or weak CD20 and EMA negativity supports cHL (including LR-cHL), even if background B cells are strongly CD20 positive. Reserve a diagnosis of NLPHL for cases in which the neoplastic cells are negative for CD30 and CD15, but show strong PAX5, strong CD20, and EMA positivity.**\nThis option perfectly mirrors the optimal algorithm derived above.\n-   It correctly prioritizes CD30 and CD15 to identify potential cHL cases first.\n-   It correctly describes the full immunophenotypic signature for confirming cHL (weak PAX5, negative/weak CD20, negative EMA).\n-   It correctly describes the immunophenotype for diagnosing NLPHL in cases that are negative for the cHL markers (strong PAX5, strong CD20, EMA positivity).\n-   Crucially, it includes the explicit and correct caveat about not being misled by the strongly CD20-positive background B-cells, which directly addresses a major pitfall in this differential diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Begin by screening for CD20. If the specimen shows strong CD20 staining anywhere in the nodal parenchyma, favor NLPHL. Only if CD20 is absent should CD30 and CD15 be assessed to support cHL.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The problem states the biopsy has a \"background rich in small B lymphocytes.\" These non-neoplastic B-cells are inherently strongly positive for CD20. Therefore, both LR-cHL and NLPHL will show strong CD20 staining in the \"nodal parenchyma\". Following this algorithm would cause nearly all cases of LR-cHL to be misclassified as NLPHL, directly opposing the stated goal. It violates the instruction to focus on the neoplastic cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Use PAX5 as the first branch. Any PAX5 positivity indicates a B-cell phenotype and should trigger NLPHL diagnosis; PAX5 negativity supports cHL when accompanied by CD30 and CD15 positivity.**\nThis option is flawed due to a critical misinterpretation of PAX5 staining. The problem states that RS cells in cHL exhibit \"weak PAX5 staining.\" The algorithm's rule, \"Any PAX5 positivity... should trigger NLPHL diagnosis,\" would therefore misclassify cHL cases (which are weakly positive) as NLPHL. It fails to distinguish between the *weak* PAX5 of cHL and the *strong* PAX5 of NLPHL.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Use EMA as the anchor. EMA negativity is used to diagnose NLPHL, while EMA positivity with any level of CD30 reactivity supports cHL.**\nThis logic is a complete reversal of the known immunophenotypes.\n-   Fact: NLPHL is \"frequently positive\" for EMA; cHL is EMA \"negative\".\n-   The option claims the opposite: \"EMA negativity is used to diagnose NLPHL\" and \"EMA positivity... supports cHL\". This is factually incorrect based on the problem's own premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Begin with CD30. If CD30 is positive in the neoplastic cells but CD20 is strong, classify as NLPHL; only CD30 positivity with absent CD20 supports cHL, regardless of PAX5 or EMA staining.**\nThis option starts correctly by assessing CD30 but fails in its subsequent logic. The rule \"If CD30 is positive... but CD20 is strong, classify as NLPHL\" is a serious error. CD30 positivity is the cardinal feature of cHL. While strong CD20 is atypical for cHL, classifying a CD30-positive case as NLPHL (which is defined as being CD30-negative) is a major diagnostic mistake. Such cases represent a diagnostic gray zone but are not NLPHL. Furthermore, ignoring PAX5 and EMA discards crucial confirmatory information. The weak PAX5 in a CD30-positive case is a key feature pointing to cHL. This algorithm is an oversimplification that would lead to errors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a logically sound and factually correct diagnostic decision tree that accomplishes the stated goal.",
