This exercise bridges the gap between this discrete genetic change and a measurable biophysical property by asking you to model the resulting shift in the protein's isoelectric point ($pI$). By applying fundamental principles of protein chemistry, you will calculate how replacing a charged glutamate with a neutral valine alters the overall charge of Hemoglobin S, providing a quantitative explanation for its differential behavior in diagnostic tests like electrophoresis.

            "problem": "A central molecular lesion in sickle cell disease is the substitution of glutamate by valine at position $6$ of the $\\beta$ chain, producing Hemoglobin S (HbS) from Hemoglobin A (HbA) in the tetrameric molecule $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{2}$. Treat hemoglobin as a macromolecule whose net charge arises from the ensemble average of ionizable side chains. Use the following well-tested biochemistry facts and assumptions to model the isoelectric behavior:\n\n- The isoelectric point $pI$ is the value of $\\mathrm{pH}$ at which the molecule’s net charge is zero.\n- The glutamate side chain has $pK_{a} \\approx 4.1$ and, near neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$, contributes approximately $-1$ charge when present. In HbS, each $\\beta$ chain has the glutamate-to-valine substitution, so the tetramer lacks $2$ glutamate carboxylates relative to HbA in total.\n- Near the isoelectric region of HbA, assume the net $\\mathrm{pH}$-dependence of charge is dominated by $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ histidine residues with identical $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.8$, each contributing an average positive charge given by the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a basic group: \n  $$\n  q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH})=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}.\n  $$\n  Treat these sites as independent and non-interacting for the purpose of estimating the local slope of net charge versus $\\mathrm{pH}$ near the isoelectric point.\n- Take the isoelectric point of HbA to be $pI_{A}=6.9$.\n\nUsing a first-order (linear) approximation of the net-charge titration curve about $pI_{A}$, estimate the shift in isoelectric point $\\Delta pI = pI_{S}-pI_{A}$ induced by the loss of the two glutamate charges in HbS.

Express the final answer as a pure number (no units).\n\nIn your reasoning, start from the definitions above and the Henderson–Hasselbalch formulation for ionizable groups, and clearly state the sign and magnitude of the slope of net charge with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$ at $pI_{A}$ before computing $\\Delta pI$. You should also interpret, in words, the consequence of the sign of $\\Delta pI$ for the relative electrophoretic mobility of HbS versus HbA at alkaline $\\mathrm{pH}$, but only the numeric value of $\\Delta pI$ will be graded.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of protein biochemistry, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution under the given assumptions, and objective in its phrasing.\n\nThe isoelectric point, $pI$, of a protein is the value of $\\mathrm{pH}$ at which its net charge, $Q$, is zero. That is, $Q(pI) = 0$.\n\nThe problem describes the mutation in Hemoglobin S (HbS) relative to Hemoglobin A (HbA). In the $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{2}$ tetramer, two glutamate residues, one on each $\\beta$ chain, are replaced by valine residues. At a near-neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$, the side chain of glutamate (a carboxylic acid with $pK_a \\approx 4.1$) is deprotonated and carries a charge of approximately $-1$. The side chain of valine is a nonpolar alkyl group and is uncharged. Therefore, the net charge difference, $\\Delta Q$, between an HbS molecule and an HbA molecule at the same $\\mathrm{pH}$ is the charge gained from removing two glutamates and adding two valines:\n$$\n\\Delta Q = Q_{S} - Q_{A} = 2 \\times (\\text{charge of valine}) - 2 \\times (\\text{charge of glutamate}) = 2(0) - 2(-1) = +2\n$$\nThis means that at any given $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the neutral range, an HbS molecule is more positive (or less negative) than an HbA molecule by $2$ elementary charge units. The relationship between the charge of the two proteins is:\n$$\nQ_{S}(\\mathrm{pH}) = Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) + 2\n$$\nThe isoelectric point of HbA, $pI_{A}$, is given as $6.9$, so by definition, $Q_{A}(pI_{A}) = Q_{A}(6.9) = 0$. The isoelectric point of HbS, $pI_{S}$, is the $\\mathrm{pH}$ at which $Q_{S}(pI_{S}) = 0$. Using the aformentioned charge relationship, this condition becomes:\n$$\nQ_{A}(pI_{S}) + 2 = 0\n$$\nTo find $pI_{S}$, we need an expression for $Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH})$ near $pI_{A}$. We use a first-order Taylor expansion (a linear approximation) for $Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH})$ around $\\mathrm{pH} = pI_{A}$:\n$$\nQ_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) \\approx Q_{A}(pI_{A}) + \\left. \\frac{dQ_{A}}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\right|_{\\mathrm{pH}=pI_{A}} (\\mathrm{pH} - pI_{A})\n$$\nSince $Q_{A}(pI_{A}) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nQ_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) \\approx S \\cdot (\\mathrm{pH} - pI_{A})\n$$\nwhere $S = \\left. \\frac{dQ_{A}}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\right|_{\\mathrm{pH}=pI_{A}}$ is the slope of the charge titration curve at the isoelectric point of HbA.\n\nThe problem states that this slope is dominated by the titration of $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ histidine residues, each with $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.8$. The average positive charge contributed by one such residue is given by:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}\n$$\nThe total charge from all $12$ histidines is $Q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH})$. We approximate the slope $S$ by differentiating this expression with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\nS \\approx \\frac{d}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\left( N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}} \\right) = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\left( (1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^{-1} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, where the derivative of $10^u$ with respect to $u$ is $10^u \\ln(10)$:\n$$\nS = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\left[ -1 \\cdot (1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^{-2} \\cdot \\left( 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}} \\ln(10) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS = -N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}{(1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^2}\n$$\nWe evaluate this slope at $\\mathrm{pH} = pI_{A} = 6.9$. With $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ and $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}=6.8$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.9 - 6.8 = 0.1\n$$\n$$\nS = -12 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{0.1}}{(1+10^{0.1})^2}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$ and $10^{0.1} \\approx 1.2589$.\n$$\nS \\approx -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.3026 \\cdot 1.2589}{(1+1.2589)^2} = -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.8988}{(2.2589)^2} \\approx -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.8988}{5.1027} \\approx -12 \\cdot (0.5681) \\approx -6.817\n$$\nThe sign of the slope is negative, which is expected: as $\\mathrm{pH}$ increases, protons are removed, and the net charge of the protein becomes more negative (or less positive). The magnitude of the slope at $pI_A$ is approximately $6.82$.\n\nNow we can find $pI_{S}$. We substitute the linear approximation of $Q_A$ into the condition for the pI of HbS, $Q_{A}(pI_{S}) + 2 = 0$:\n$$\nS \\cdot (pI_{S} - pI_{A}) + 2 \\approx 0\n$$\nThe shift in the isoelectric point is $\\Delta pI = pI_{S} - pI_{A}$.\n$$\nS \\cdot \\Delta pI \\approx -2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta pI \\approx -\\frac{2}{S} = -\\frac{2}{-6.817} \\approx 0.29337\n$$\nRounding the final answer to $2$ significant figures gives $\\Delta pI \\approx 0.29$.\n\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta pI$ indicates that the isoelectric point of HbS is higher than that of HbA ($pI_{S} > pI_{A}$). This is consistent with HbS being more positively charged than HbA. To make HbS neutral, one must raise the $\\mathrm{pH}$ to a more alkaline value compared to HbA, to deprotonate additional acidic groups. At an alkaline $\\mathrm{pH}$ used for electrophoresis (e.g., $\\mathrm{pH} > pI_S$), both proteins are net negative. However, since $Q_S = Q_A + 2$, HbS is always less negative than HbA. In an electric field, both will migrate towards the positive electrode (the anode), but HbS, being less negatively charged, will experience a weaker electrostatic force and thus migrate more slowly than HbA.",

All calculations will adhere to the specified unit conversions and rounding requirements.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new Mean Corpuscular Volume ($V_1$).\nThe baseline MCV is given as $V_0 = 88 \\text{ fL}$.

The concentration $[\\mathrm{Hb}]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ must be converted from micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to molar ($\\mathrm{M}$).\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Hb}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = 20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into the expression for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{(10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M})}\n$$\nThe product in the denominator is:\n$$\n(10^{7}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-6}) = 20 \\times 10^{7-6} = 20 \\times 10^{1} = 200\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, the half-life is:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{200}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{200}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.0034657\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 0.00347\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $3.47 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",
