            "problem": "A 48-year-old patient presents with early satiety and mild weight loss. Endoscopy shows a diffusely thickened gastric wall with subtle mucosal changes but no discrete exophytic mass. Multiple biopsies from the body and antrum demonstrate individual and small clusters of mucin-laden signet ring cells infiltrating a fibrotic (desmoplastic) stroma. There is minimal surface epithelial dysplasia and no well-formed glandular architecture. Based on fundamental definitions of epithelial cell adhesion and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, in which DNA sequence alterations or epigenetic changes modulate messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels, and the Lauren classification of gastric carcinoma grounded in histologic growth patterns, which of the following integrated interpretations most accurately classifies this tumor and predicts the most likely molecular and immunohistochemical profile? Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma; inactivating alterations of the cadherin 1 gene (CDH1) leading to functional loss of E-cadherin at the epithelial cell membrane on Immunohistochemistry (IHC), often with cytoplasmic relocalization of p120 catenin.\n\nB. Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma arising within an adenomatous polyp; adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation with Wnt pathway activation; retained strong membranous E-cadherin staining on IHC.\n\nC. Hyperplastic gastric polyp related to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori); activating Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation; patchy cytoplasmic E-cadherin staining with intact membranous expression on IHC.\n\nD. Microsatellite Instability (MSI)-high gastric carcinoma due to mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) promoter hypermethylation; prominent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; preserved E-cadherin membranous staining on IHC.\n\nE. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified gastric carcinoma; strong HER2 membranous staining; increased E-cadherin expression on IHC consistent with intact adherens junctions.",
            "solution": "The histological findings are the cornerstone of the diagnosis. The presence of \"individual and small clusters of mucin-laden signet ring cells\" that infiltrate the stomach wall without forming glandular structures is the classic definition of a **diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma** according to the Lauren classification. This pattern contrasts with intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, which is characterized by the formation of cohesive, gland-like structures.\n\nThe diffuse, poorly cohesive growth pattern is a direct result of a fundamental failure in cell-cell adhesion. The primary protein responsible for holding epithelial cells together is **E-cadherin**, which is encoded by the **`CDH1` gene**. In diffuse-type gastric cancer, inactivating mutations or other alterations in the `CDH1` gene lead to a loss of functional E-cadherin protein.\n\nThis molecular defect has predictable consequences that can be visualized with immunohistochemistry (IHC). While normal epithelial cells show strong E-cadherin staining at the cell membrane, diffuse-type cancer cells typically show a loss or marked reduction of this membranous staining. Furthermore, the loss of E-cadherin from the cell surface can cause its binding partner, **p120 catenin**, to be released into the cytoplasm, a phenomenon known as cytoplasmic relocalization.\n\nBased on this integrated analysis:\n*   **Option A** is the correct answer. It accurately classifies the tumor as diffuse-type and correctly links this histology to its known molecular driver (`CDH1` inactivation), its protein consequence (loss of E-cadherin), and its characteristic immunohistochemical profile (loss of membranous E-cadherin, cytoplasmic p120 catenin).\n*   **Option B** is incorrect. It describes an intestinal-type cancer, which is histologically and molecularly distinct.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect. It describes a benign hyperplastic polyp, not an invasive carcinoma.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect. While MSI-high is a type of gastric cancer, it is typically intestinal-type, cohesive, and would show preserved E-cadherin staining.\n*   **Option E** is incorrect. HER2-amplified cancers are also typically cohesive intestinal-type tumors with intact E-cadherin expression.",

            "problem": "A patient undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is found to have a depressed Paris classification 0-IIc lesion measuring 1.2 cm on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The endoscopist performs a submucosal injection with normal saline to create a cushion and observes a nonlifting sign: the lesion’s mucosa does not elevate relative to surrounding tissue. The biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without definitive evidence of lymphovascular invasion, and there is no endoscopic stigmata of active ulceration, but the depressed morphology is clearly defined. Based on the pathological architecture of the gastric wall (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria) and well-established observations that risk of lymph node metastasis increases sharply with submucosal invasion depth, and considering that Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is intended for lesions with negligible regional lymph node metastasis risk under defined indications, decide the most appropriate initial management.\n\nWhich option is most appropriate?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The management of early gastric cancer (EGC) is determined by the risk of lymph node metastasis. Endoscopic resection techniques like Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) are considered curative only when this risk is negligible. The decision hinges on a careful assessment of several features of the primary tumor: size, macroscopic type (Paris classification), histology, presence of ulceration, and, most critically, the depth of invasion.\n\nThe patient has a 1.2 cm, Paris classification 0-IIc (depressed type), well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without ulceration. While some of these features (size $< 2$ cm, no ulceration, well-differentiated histology) might suggest eligibility for ESD under expanded criteria, the single most important piece of information provided is the **nonlifting sign**.\n\nThe pathological architecture of the gastric wall consists of sequential layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa. During an endoscopic resection, a saline solution is injected into the submucosal layer to lift the mucosa (and the lesion contained within it) away from the deeper muscularis propria. This creates a safety cushion and a clear plane for dissection.\n\nThe \"nonlifting sign\" is the failure of the lesion to elevate upon submucosal injection. This clinical sign has a well-established pathological correlate: fibrosis within the submucosal layer, which tethers the overlying mucosa to the muscularis propria. Such fibrosis is most commonly caused by significant invasion of the tumor into the submucosa, particularly deep submucosal invasion (defined as invasion $> 500$ µm from the muscularis mucosae, often denoted as $SM2$ or deeper).\n\nThe depth of submucosal invasion is the strongest predictor of lymph node metastasis in EGC. While lesions confined to the mucosa or with only minute submucosal invasion ($SM1$, $\\leq 500$ µm) have a very low risk of lymph node metastasis ($<3\\%$), the risk escalates dramatically with deep submucosal ($SM2$) invasion, reaching rates of $15-25\\%$ or higher. Such a high probability of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes cannot be addressed by an endoscopic-only approach.\n\nTherefore, the nonlifting sign is considered a strong, often absolute, contraindication for curative-intent endoscopic resection. It indicates that the cancer has likely advanced to a stage where surgical intervention is necessary to provide both local control and treatment of the regional lymph nodes. The biopsy result, showing no *definitive* lymphovascular invasion, is insufficient to override the powerful negative predictive value of the nonlifting sign; a small forceps biopsy samples only a tiny fraction of the tumor and the underlying stroma and cannot reliably assess the full depth of invasion.\n\nThe appropriate management is, therefore, a treatment that addresses both the primary tumor and the high risk of regional nodal disease. This treatment is surgical gastrectomy (subtotal or total, depending on location) combined with a formal regional lymph node dissection (e.g., D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy).\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Proceed with Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) because the lesion size is $\\leq 2$ cm and there is no ulceration on endoscopy.**\nThis option correctly notes some factors that favor ESD but completely ignores the overriding negative factor: the nonlifting sign. The presence of a nonlifting sign strongly suggests that the criteria for a curative endoscopic resection (i.e., negligible risk of lymph node metastasis) are not met. Furthermore, it predicts significant technical difficulty and an increased risk of perforation during the ESD procedure itself.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Recommend surgical gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection because the nonlifting sign implies likely submucosal invasion beyond a minute depth, making endoscopic therapy non-curative.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the clinical data. It correctly identifies the nonlifting sign as the key finding, correctly interprets its implication (deep submucosal invasion), and correctly concludes that this finding points to a high risk of lymph node metastasis, rendering endoscopic therapy non-curative. Therefore, it correctly recommends the standard-of-care for such a scenario: surgical resection with lymphadenectomy.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Attempt Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) because the small size and depressed configuration favor snare capture.**\nThis is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, as with option A, it ignores the nonlifting sign, which contraindicates any attempt at curative endoscopic resection. Second, for a confirmed adenocarcinoma that is 1.2 cm and depressed, ESD is generally preferred over EMR to ensure *en bloc* resection for accurate histopathological staging. A depressed configuration does not necessarily favor snare capture with EMR. Third, EMR is even less likely to succeed than ESD in the presence of submucosal fibrosis indicated by the nonlifting sign.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Defer intervention and schedule surveillance endoscopy in $6$ months to reassess for interval change.**\nThis is a grave error in clinical judgment. The patient has a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. Delaying treatment for a confirmed malignancy, especially one with signs of aggressive behavior (deep invasion suggested by the nonlifting sign), is contrary to all oncologic principles and constitutes malpractice. The lesion requires immediate and definitive therapy.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Proceed with ESD as a diagnostic resection; if histology shows non-curative features, then refer for surgery afterward, as the small size minimizes risk.**\nWhile diagnostic ESD is a concept, it is not the most appropriate *initial* step in this case. The nonlifting sign is not merely a suggestion of a non-curative outcome; it is a strong predictor of it and also a predictor of procedural failure (inability to complete the resection) and complications (perforation). To subject a patient to the risks of a complex ESD procedure when the pre-procedural evidence already points strongly toward the need for surgery is poor risk-benefit management. The most direct, safe, and oncologically sound approach is to proceed directly to surgery. The small size does not negate the high risk of nodal metastasis or the procedural risks of ESD on a non-lifting lesion.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "problem": "A gastric endoscopic biopsy from a patient with a known mucosal lesion reveals a hyperplastic polyp adjacent to an invasive gastric adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is performed on the carcinoma component to assess candidacy for immunotherapy. On the invasive carcinoma slide, the pathologist counts $120$ PD-L1 positive tumor cells, $80$ PD-L1 positive tumor-associated lymphocytes and macrophages, and identifies a total of $1000$ viable tumor cells. In advanced gastric carcinoma practice, the combined positive score (CPS) is used, and clinical decision-making commonly considers thresholds of CPS $\\geq 1$ and CPS $\\geq 10$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definition of CPS in this context and first principles of how counts are normalized in pathology scoring systems, compute the CPS from the provided counts and determine, based on the computed value, whether the case meets each threshold criterion (CPS $\\geq 1$ and CPS $\\geq 10$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Combined Positive Score (CPS) and its evaluation against two clinical thresholds. The foundational definition of CPS in the context of gastric carcinoma immunohistochemistry is the number of all PD-L1 positive cells (which includes tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, with the resulting ratio multiplied by $100$.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the provided data:\n-   Let $N_{TC+}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells.\n-   Let $N_{IC+}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages).\n-   Let $N_{TC,total}$ be the total number of viable tumor cells.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   $N_{TC+} = 120$\n-   $N_{IC+} = 80$\n-   $N_{TC,total} = 1000$\n\nThe formula for the Combined Positive Score (CPS) is:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{N_{TC+} + N_{IC+}}{N_{TC,total}} \\times 100 $$\n\nThe numerator represents the total number of PD-L1 staining cells. The denominator is the total population of viable tumor cells, which serves as the normalization factor.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{120 + 80}{1000} \\times 100 $$\n\nFirst, we sum the number of all PD-L1 positive cells:\n$$ N_{TC+} + N_{IC+} = 120 + 80 = 200 $$\n\nNext, we substitute this sum back into the CPS formula:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{200}{1000} \\times 100 $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.2 $$\n\nFinally, we multiply by $100$ to obtain the score as a plain number, as is standard practice:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20 $$\n\nThe calculated CPS is $20$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this result against the two specified clinical thresholds to determine eligibility. The output for eligibility is a binary indicator, where $1$ signifies \"eligible\" and $0$ signifies \"ineligible\".\n\nThreshold 1: CPS $\\geq 1$\nWe compare our calculated value:\n$$ 20 \\geq 1 $$\nThis statement is true. Therefore, the eligibility indicator for the CPS $\\geq 1$ threshold is $1$.\n\nThreshold 2: CPS $\\geq 10$\nWe compare our calculated value:\n$$ 20 \\geq 10 $$\nThis statement is also true. Therefore, the eligibility indicator for the CPS $\\geq 10$ threshold is $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing three entries in order: the CPS value, the eligibility indicator for the first threshold, and the eligibility indicator for the second threshold.",
