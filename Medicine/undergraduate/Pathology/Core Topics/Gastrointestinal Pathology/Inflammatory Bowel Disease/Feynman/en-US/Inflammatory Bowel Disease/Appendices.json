However, by understanding the timescales of tissue injury and repair, a pathologist can interpret the \"histologic clocks\" within the tissue to determine if an inflammatory process is acute and transient or chronic and persistent.

            "solution": "The user wants me to validate and solve a pathology problem.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Clinical Presentation**: Diarrhea and rectal bleeding.\n- **Histological Findings**:\n    1.  Prominent basal plasmacytosis in the lamina propria adjacent to the muscularis mucosae.\n    2.  Diffuse mucosal chronic architectural changes, including crypt branching and irregular spacing.\n    3.  Scattered foci of acute cryptitis.\n- **Clinical Question**: Differentiate between chronic idiopathic colitis (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, IBD) and acute self-limited infectious colitis.\n- **Problem Task**: Explain why the combination of basal plasmacytosis and chronic architectural distortion supports a chronic idiopathic process rather than an acute infectious process, using core pathology principles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is a classic scenario in gastrointestinal pathology.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical)**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of pathology and histology. The terms used—basal plasmacytosis, crypt architectural distortion, cryptitis, lamina propria, muscularis mucosae—are standard in the field. The distinction between acute and chronic inflammation and its morphological correlates is a fundamental concept. The epithelial renewal time of the colon is also correctly cited within the physiological range. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the best explanation among a set of options for a specific set of clinical and histological findings. It is clearly structured to have a single correct answer based on pathophysiological reasoning.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The description of histological features is objective and uses precise, standard terminology. The question asks for an explanation based on \"injury pattern logic,\" which relies on objective, evidence-based principles rather than subjective opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the temporal evolution of inflammatory processes in the colonic mucosa.\n\n1.  **Tissue Timescales**: The colonic epithelium is in a constant state of renewal. Stem cells located at the base of the crypts divide, and their progeny differentiate as they migrate towards the luminal surface, where they are shed. This entire process, or renewal cycle, takes approximately $3$ to $5$ days.\n2.  **Acute Inflammation**: An acute injury, such as a self-limited infection, lasts for a short duration (days to a week or two). The characteristic inflammatory infiltrate is neutrophilic. In the colon, this manifests as neutrophils in the lamina propria and infiltrating the crypt epithelium (cryptitis) and crypt lumens (crypt abscesses). Because the process is short-lived, it typically resolves before significant, permanent changes can be made to the underlying crypt architecture. Once the infectious agent is cleared, the mucosa heals, and the normal, parallel crypt arrangement is restored.\n3.  **Chronic Inflammation**: A chronic process, by definition, is long-standing (weeks, months, or years). The archetypal example is idiopathic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This persistent or relapsing-remitting inflammation is characterized by an infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells, namely lymphocytes and plasma cells.\n    -   **Basal Plasmacytosis**: In IBD, there is a sustained immune response. This leads to the accumulation of plasma cells, which are the antibody-producing effector cells. Their specific localization in the lower part of the lamina propria, near the crypt bases and muscularis mucosae, is a key feature of chronic idiopathic colitis. This pattern reflects a deep-seated, established inflammatory process that is not seen in transient acute colitis.\n    -   **Chronic Architectural Distortion**: The persistent inflammation repeatedly injures the crypts, including the crucial stem cell zone at the base. The subsequent repair and regeneration processes become disordered. Instead of recreating perfect, parallel tubes, the crypts may branch, become shortened, vary in size and shape, and drop out entirely, leading to irregular spacing. This remodeling of the mucosal \"scaffolding\" can only occur over a timescale that is much longer than a single epithelial renewal cycle; it requires multiple rounds of injury and faulty repair over weeks to months.\n\n4.  **Synthesis**: The presence of scattered acute cryptitis indicates *active* inflammation. However, the background of basal plasmacytosis and architectural distortion indicates that this active inflammation is occurring in a setting of a *chronic* underlying disease. An acute, self-limited infection would primarily show acute inflammation (neutrophils) with a preserved or only minimally disturbed architecture. It would not have had the time to establish a dense, basal plasma cell population or to remodel the crypt structure. Therefore, the combination of these features strongly points towards a chronic idiopathic process like IBD over an acute infection.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Persistent antigenic stimulation centered at the mucosal stem cell niche drives recruitment and maintenance of plasma cells in the basal lamina propria and remodels crypt architecture over multiple epithelial renewal cycles (approximately $3$–$5$ days per cycle), whereas a short-lived infection produces predominantly neutrophilic injury with preserved crypt parallelism.**\nThis option provides a comprehensive and accurate pathophysiological explanation. It correctly links persistent stimulation (chronicity) to both the basal plasmacytosis and the architectural remodeling. It correctly states that remodeling requires a long time course, spanning multiple epithelial renewal cycles. It also correctly contrasts this with the typical findings of a short-lived infection (neutrophilic injury, preserved architecture). This aligns perfectly with the principles of pathology.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Basal plasmacytosis and crypt architectural distortion are pathognomonic for ulcerative colitis and never occur in Crohn disease or infectious colitis, making them definitive for a single diagnosis.**\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors. The term \"pathognomonic\" implies that a sign or symptom is so characteristic of a disease that it makes the diagnosis. While these features are highly suggestive of IBD, they are not pathognomonic for ulcerative colitis specifically. They are also cardinal features of colonic Crohn disease. The claim that they \"never\" occur in infectious colitis is too absolute; some chronic infections (e.g., in immunocompromised patients) can lead to architectural changes, although the classic IBD pattern is distinct.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A single severe infectious episode commonly produces irreversible crypt branching and sustained basal plasma cell infiltration because acute bacterial toxins directly transform crypt stem cells.**\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, it is not common for a single infectious episode, even a severe one, to cause the irreversible architectural distortion and sustained plasmacytosis characteristic of IBD. The typical outcome is resolution. Second, the proposed mechanism—that bacterial toxins \"directly transform\" stem cells—is biologically unsound. Toxins cause cell death and injury, they do not reprogram stem cells to produce distorted architecture permanently.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Basal plasmacytosis with crypt distortion primarily reflects ischemic injury patterns due to vascular compromise rather than immune-mediated mechanisms, distinguishing it from both idiopathic and infectious colitides.**\nThis option misattributes the findings. Ischemic colitis has a different characteristic histology, typically involving coagulative necrosis, lamina propria hyalinization, and withered crypts, especially in the acute phase. While chronic ischemia can cause some architectural changes and fibrosis, prominent basal plasmacytosis is not a feature. The described findings are the classic result of immune-mediated injury in IBD, not ischemic injury.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Basal plasmacytosis and chronic architectural changes are nonspecific responses to any colonic inflammation and occur with equal frequency in brief self-limited infections, so they cannot distinguish chronic idiopathic from acute infectious colitis.**\nThis statement is the direct opposite of established histopathological practice. These features are *not* nonspecific; their presence and pattern are highly significant. They do *not* occur with equal frequency in brief, self-limited infections—in fact, their presence is a key indicator against such an infection. They are crucially important features used to distinguish chronic from acute colitis precisely because they are markers of a long-standing disease process.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "A patient with long-standing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) presents with worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous colonic inflammation from the rectum through the cecum, and an incompetent ileocecal valve. The terminal ileum, sampled over approximately $5$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ proximal to the valve, shows mild villous blunting, lamina propria edema and a predominantly mucosal inflammatory infiltrate without fissuring ulcers. Lymphoid aggregates consistent with Peyer’s patches are preserved and non-necrotic. No noncaseating granulomas are identified in multiple biopsy levels. Imaging shows no strictures, fistulas, or creeping mesenteric fat.

The terminal ileal changes represent backwash ileitis occurring in Ulcerative Colitis due to reflux through an incompetent ileocecal valve; the contiguous colitis, superficial (mucosa-predominant) ileal inflammation with villous blunting, preservation of Peyer’s patches, and absence of granulomas and transmural injury support this interpretation over Crohn’s Disease.\n\nB. Any ileal involvement mandates a diagnosis of Crohn’s Disease because Ulcerative Colitis cannot involve the ileum; the presence of ileitis, regardless of pattern, indicates skip lesions typical of Crohn’s Disease.\n\nC. The finding of villous atrophy in the ileum is most consistent with celiac disease; the preservation of Peyer’s patches and absence of granulomas does not affect this interpretation.\n\nD. The terminal ileal changes are most likely infectious (e.g., Yersinia enterocolitica), because Peyer’s patches are prominent; infectious ileitis explains the colonic inflammation without requiring consideration of Ulcerative Colitis versus Crohn’s Disease.",
            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Patient profile: A patient with long-standing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).\n-   Presenting symptoms: Worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n-   Colonoscopy findings:\n    -   Continuous colonic inflammation from the rectum through the cecum.\n    -   An incompetent ileocecal valve.\n-   Terminal ileum biopsy findings (sampled over approximately $5$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ proximal to the ileocecal valve):\n    -   Mild villous blunting.\n    -   Lamina propria edema.\n    -   Predominantly mucosal inflammatory infiltrate.\n    -   Absence of fissuring ulcers.\n    -   Preserved and non-necrotic Peyer’s patches.\n    -   Absence of noncaseating granulomas in multiple biopsy levels.\n-   Imaging findings: Absence of strictures, fistulas, or creeping mesenteric fat.\n-   Provided definitions:\n    -   Ulcerative Colitis (UC): A disease of continuous, largely mucosal colonic inflammation.\n    -   Crohn’s Disease (CD): Characterized by discontinuous, often transmural inflammation that can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, with granulomas in a subset of cases.\n-   Question: Select the most appropriate interpretation of the terminal ileal findings and the key reasoning that prevents misclassification.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against standard validation criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem presents a classic and realistic clinical scenario in gastroenterology and pathology. The distinction between Ulcerative Colitis with backwash ileitis and Crohn's Disease is a critical and well-established diagnostic challenge. All clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic terms are standard and used correctly. The definitions provided for UC and CD are accurate, foundational concepts in the field. The scenario is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, relevant data (distribution of colitis, state of the ileocecal valve, detailed histology of the ileum, negative findings for CD features) to allow for a logical deduction based on the provided definitions. A unique and meaningful interpretation is possible.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is articulated using objective, clinical language. It describes findings without bias or subjective interpretation, asking the solver to apply deductive reasoning based on the evidence.\n\nThe problem is free from the flaws listed in the instructions. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous. It presents a non-trivial diagnostic puzzle that requires careful integration of multiple data points, which is central to medical pathology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe core of the problem is to differentiate between Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD) in a patient with pancolitis and terminal ileal inflammation.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Colonic Findings**: The patient exhibits \"continuous colonic inflammation from the rectum through the cecum\". This pattern of continuous, retrograde inflammation originating in the rectum is the cardinal feature of Ulcerative Colitis. In contrast, Crohn's Disease typically involves discontinuous inflammation (\"skip lesions\") and can spare the rectum in a significant number of cases.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Systemic and Extramural Findings**: The absence of strictures, fistulas, creeping mesenteric fat, fissuring ulcers, and transmural inflammation on biopsy strongly argues against Crohn’s Disease. These features are hallmarks of the deep, transmural inflammatory process characteristic of CD.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Terminal Ileum Findings**: The presence of ileal inflammation is a potential confounder, as ileitis is classically associated with Crohn's Disease. However, the *character* of the inflammation is critical for correct classification.\n    -   The problem describes ileal inflammation in the presence of an \"incompetent ileocecal valve\". This anatomical defect allows for the reflux of colonic contents and inflammatory mediators into the terminal ileum.\n    -   The inflammation is \"mild\" and \"predominantly mucosal\". It lacks the \"fissuring ulcers\" and deep inflammation that would suggest CD.\n    -   Critically, \"no noncaseating granulomas are identified\". While granulomas are only present in a subset of CD cases, their absence, combined with the other features, weighs against a CD diagnosis.\n    -   The described findings (mild villous blunting, edema, mucosal infiltrate) are non-specific inflammatory changes.\n    -   This specific constellation—inflammation limited to the distal-most ileum (approx. $5$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{cm}$), occurring in the setting of severe pancolitis and an incompetent valve, with inflammatory changes that are mild and superficial—is the classic description of **backwash ileitis**. Backwash ileitis is a known complication of severe UC and is not considered diagnostic of Crohn's Disease. It represents an extension of the colonic inflammatory process, not a separate, primary ileal disease.\n\n4.  **Synthesis**: The overwhelming evidence points towards a diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis. The continuous pancolitis and lack of transmural features are classic for UC. The terminal ileitis is fully explained as backwash ileitis, a phenomenon secondary to severe UC and an incompetent valve. To classify this as CD would be to ignore the continuous nature of the colitis and the superficial, non-granulomatous character of the ileitis.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. The terminal ileal changes represent backwash ileitis occurring in Ulcerative Colitis due to reflux through an incompetent ileocecal valve; the contiguous colitis, superficial (mucosa-predominant) ileal inflammation with villous blunting, preservation of Peyer’s patches, and absence of granulomas and transmural injury support this interpretation over Crohn’s Disease.**\n-   This option correctly identifies the phenomenon as backwash ileitis. It correctly links the pancolitis to a UC diagnosis and the ileitis to reflux through the incompetent valve. It accurately cites the precise evidence provided in the problem statement that supports this conclusion: contiguous colitis, superficial/mucosal ileal inflammation, and the absence of features characteristic of Crohn's Disease (granulomas, transmural injury). This statement provides a complete and correct synthesis of the findings.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Any ileal involvement mandates a diagnosis of Crohn’s Disease because Ulcerative Colitis cannot involve the ileum; the presence of ileitis, regardless of pattern, indicates skip lesions typical of Crohn’s Disease.**\n-   This statement contains a critical factual error. The assertion that \"Ulcerative Colitis cannot involve the ileum\" is false. Backwash ileitis is a well-documented exception. Furthermore, the statement that *any* ileitis mandates a CD diagnosis is an incorrect oversimplification that ignores the importance of the pattern and depth of inflammation. The colitis is continuous, which contradicts the claim of skip lesions.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The finding of villous atrophy in the ileum is most consistent with celiac disease; the preservation of Peyer’s patches and absence of granulomas does not affect this interpretation.**\n-   This option incorrectly equates \"mild villous blunting\"—a non-specific inflammatory finding—with the often severe \"villous atrophy\" of celiac disease. Celiac disease typically affects the proximal small bowel (duodenum/jejunum), not the terminal ileum in isolation. Most importantly, this hypothesis completely fails to account for the patient's primary pathology, which is a severe, continuous pancolitis.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The terminal ileal changes are most likely infectious (e.g., Yersinia enterocolitica), because Peyer’s patches are prominent; infectious ileitis explains the colonic inflammation without requiring consideration of Ulcerative Colitis versus Crohn’s Disease.**\n-   This option is inconsistent with the clinical history of \"long-standing Inflammatory Bowel Disease\" and \"worsening\" symptoms. While a superimposed infection is possible, an acute infection like Yersinia is not the underlying diagnosis. Moreover, infectious enterocolitis typically does not produce a pattern of continuous inflammation extending from the rectum throughout the entire colon. The findings are much more typical for chronic IBD. The problem also states the Peyer's patches are \"preserved,\" not necessarily prominent in a manner specifically suggesting infection.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**",

There are no missing data points or contradictory constraints.\n- **Realism:** The clinical case is highly realistic. The provided probabilities, while being simplified estimates, reflect reasonable clinical experience (e.g., skip lesions and ileitis being much more common in CD than UC).\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is a valid, well-posed problem that integrates clinical pathology principles with a formal probabilistic framework.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of posterior probabilities for four diagnoses ($D_i$) given a set of four features, which we denote collectively as $F = \\{F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4\\}$. We use Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$ P(D_i \\mid F) = \\frac{P(F \\mid D_i) P_0(D_i)}{P(F)} $$\n\nThe term $P(F)$ is the marginal probability of the evidence, calculated by summing over all possible diagnoses:\n\n$$ P(F) = \\sum_j P(F \\mid D_j) P_0(D_j) $$\n\nDue to the assumption of conditional independence, the joint likelihood $P(F \\mid D_i)$ is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n\n$$ P(F \\mid D_i) = P(F_1 \\mid D_i) \\times P(F_2 \\mid D_i) \\times P(F_3 \\mid D_i) \\times P(F_4 \\mid D_i) $$\n\n**1. Calculate the Joint Likelihood $P(F \\mid D_i)$ for each Diagnosis:**\n\n- **Crohn Disease (CD):**\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{CD}) = P(F_1|\\text{CD}) P(F_2|\\text{CD}) P(F_3|\\text{CD}) P(F_4|\\text{CD})$\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{CD}) = 0.7 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.9 = 0.189$\n\n- **Ulcerative Colitis (UC):**\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{UC}) = P(F_1|\\text{UC}) P(F_2|\\text{UC}) P(F_3|\\text{UC}) P(F_4|\\text{UC})$\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{UC}) = 0.1 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.9 = 0.00315$\n\n- **Acute Infectious Colitis (IC):**\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{IC}) = P(F_1|\\text{IC}) P(F_2|\\text{IC}) P(F_3|\\text{IC}) P(F_4|\\text{IC})$\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{IC}) = 0.3 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.4 = 0.0024$\n\n- **Intestinal Tuberculosis (ITB):**\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{ITB}) = P(F_1|\\text{ITB}) P(F_2|\\text{ITB}) P(F_3|\\text{ITB}) P(F_4|\\text{ITB})$\n  $P(F \\mid \\text{ITB}) = 0.6 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.8 = 0.0672$\n\n**2. Calculate the Numerator Term $P(F \\mid D_i) P_0(D_i)$ for each Diagnosis:**\n\n- **CD:** $0.189 \\times 0.45 = 0.08505$\n- **UC:** $0.00315 \\times 0.35 = 0.0011025$\n- **IC:** $0.0024 \\times 0.15 = 0.00036$\n- **ITB:** $0.0672 \\times 0.05 = 0.00336$\n\n**3. Calculate the Marginal Probability of Evidence $P(F)$:**\n\n$P(F) = 0.08505 (\\text{CD}) + 0.0011025 (\\text{UC}) + 0.00036 (\\text{IC}) + 0.00336 (\\text{ITB})$\n$P(F) = 0.0898725$\n\n**4. Calculate the Posterior Probabilities $P(D_i \\mid F)$:**\n\n- **CD:**\n  $P(\\text{CD} \\mid F) = \\frac{0.08505}{0.0898725} \\approx 0.94634 \\approx 0.95$\n\n- **UC:**\n  $P(\\text{UC} \\mid F) = \\frac{0.0011025}{0.0898725} \\approx 0.01227 \\approx 0.01$\n\n- **IC:**\n  $P(\\text{IC} \\mid F) = \\frac{0.00036}{0.0898725} \\approx 0.004006 \\approx 0.004$\n\n- **ITB:**\n  $P(\\text{ITB} \\mid F) = \\frac{0.00336}{0.0898725} \\approx 0.03738 \\approx 0.04$\n\nThe calculated posterior probabilities are: $P(\\text{CD}) \\approx 95\\%$, $P(\\text{UC}) \\approx 1\\%$, $P(\\text{IC}) \\approx 0.4\\%$, and $P(\\text{ITB}) \\approx 4\\%$.\n\n**5. Recommend Targeted Tests Based on Posterior Probabilities and Pathologic Principles:**\n\nThe Bayesian update strongly indicates Crohn disease ($P(\\text{CD}) \\approx 95\\%$) as the most probable diagnosis. The clinical and pathological features ($F_1$: skip lesions, rectal sparing; $F_2$: ileitis) are archetypal for CD.\nHowever, intestinal tuberculosis remains a significant differential diagnosis ($P(\\text{ITB}) \\approx 4\\%$). ITB can mimic CD almost perfectly, both endoscopically (ileocecal involvement, ulcers) and histologically (granulomatous inflammation, although granulomas were not seen here, their absence does not exclude ITB). Mistaking ITB for CD and initiating immunosuppressive therapy can lead to disseminated, life-threatening tuberculosis. Therefore, it is critical to exclude ITB.\nThe probabilities for UC and acute IC are now negligible ($<2\\%$ combined). It is not efficient to pursue tests for these diagnoses.\n\nThe optimal testing strategy is to:\n1.  **Confirm and stage the highly probable CD diagnosis.** Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) is the ideal non-invasive modality to evaluate the full extent of small bowel inflammation, detect strictures, and identify penetrating complications (fistulae, abscesses), which are all characteristic of CD.\n2.  **Actively exclude the critical mimic, ITB.** The most direct methods are to search for the causative agent, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, in tissue from the affected area (terminal ileum). This involves:\n    -   **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain** (or other acid-fast bacilli stain) on biopsy sections. This has low sensitivity but is specific if positive.\n    -   **Tissue Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)** for *M. tuberculosis* DNA, which is much more sensitive than staining.\n\nTests for other conditions, like CMV immunohistochemistry, are typically reserved for patients who are known to be immunosuppressed or who fail to respond to standard IBD therapy. Deferring this test is clinically appropriate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Posteriors: $\\text{CD} \\approx 0.95$, $\\text{UC} \\approx 0.01$, $\\text{ITB} \\approx 0.04$, $\\text{IC} \\approx 0.004$. Recommended tests: Ziehl–Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli on terminal ileum biopsies, tissue Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) to assess small bowel involvement; defer cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunohistochemistry unless immunosuppression or refractory severe colitis emerges.**\n- **Posterior Probabilities:** These values are an accurate representation of our calculated posteriors, rounded to two or three decimal places.\n- **Recommended Tests:** This plan perfectly aligns with our principle-based reasoning. It focuses on confirming the most likely diagnosis (CD) via MRE while simultaneously using high-yield tests (ZN stain, tissue PCR) to exclude the most critical differential (ITB). The decision to defer CMV IHC is also clinically sound.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Posteriors: $\\text{UC} \\approx 0.65$, $\\text{CD} \\approx 0.20$, $\\text{IC} \\approx 0.10$, $\\text{ITB} \\approx 0.05$. Recommended tests: perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and CMV immunohistochemistry on colonic biopsies to clarify etiology.**\n- **Posterior Probabilities:** These are grossly incorrect. The evidence strongly disfavors UC (rectal sparing, skip lesions, ileitis) and favors CD. The calculated posterior for UC is $\\approx 1\\%$, not $65\\%$.\n- **Recommended Tests:** Focusing on UC with a test like pANCA (which has limited diagnostic utility) is illogical and contrary to the evidence.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Posteriors: $\\text{ITB} \\approx 0.50$, $\\text{CD} \\approx 0.30$, $\\text{UC} \\approx 0.15$, $\\text{IC} \\approx 0.05$. Recommended tests: trichrome stain for subepithelial collagen band and stool ova and parasite examination.**\n- **Posterior Probabilities:** These are incorrect. While ITB is a differential, its posterior probability is calculated at $\\approx 4\\%$, not $50\\%$.\n- **Recommended Tests:** A trichrome stain is used to diagnose collagenous colitis, which has a completely different clinical and histological presentation. Repeating an O&P exam is not the highest priority.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Posteriors: $\\text{IC} \\approx 0.60$, $\\text{CD} \\approx 0.25$, $\\text{UC} \\approx 0.10$, $\\text{ITB} \\approx 0.05$. Recommended tests: Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stain for fungi and repeat bacterial stool cultures.**\n- **Posterior Probabilities:** These are incorrect. Acute infectious colitis (IC) is extremely unlikely given the $6$-month chronicity and chronic histological changes; the calculated posterior is $\\approx 0.4\\%$, not $60\\%$.\n- **Recommended Tests:** GMS stain for fungi is not indicated by the clinical picture. Repeating stool cultures after initial negatives in a chronic case is very low yield.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
