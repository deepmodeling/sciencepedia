The test is applied to a cohort where the true disease prevalence is $0.05$. The test has sensitivity $0.85$ and specificity $0.98$. Using the foundational definitions of sensitivity (the probability of a positive result given disease), specificity (the probability of a negative result given no disease), prevalence (the prior probability of disease in the population), the Law of Total Probability, and Bayes' theorem, compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV; the probability of disease given a positive result) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV; the probability of no disease given a negative result). Express both PPV and NPV as decimals (not percentages), and round each to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- True disease prevalence: $0.05$\n- Test sensitivity: $0.85$\n- Test specificity: $0.98$\n- Definition of sensitivity: The probability of a positive result given disease.\n- Definition of specificity: The probability of a negative result given no disease.\n- Definition of prevalence: The prior probability of disease in the population.\n- Required foundational principles: The Law of Total Probability and Bayes' theorem.\n- Task 1: Compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), defined as the probability of disease given a positive result.\n- Task 2: Compute the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), defined as the probability of no disease given a negative result.\n- Task 3: Express both PPV and NPV as decimals rounded to four significant figures.\n- Task 4: Briefly interpret the implications of these values for false positives and false negatives.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard, fundamental concepts in epidemiology and medical statistics (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, PPV, NPV) and their mathematical relationships as described by Bayes' theorem. The provided values are realistic for a rapid antigen test in a low-prevalence setting. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and definitions provided to arrive at a unique solution. The language is precise and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease (COVID-19), and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = 0.05$. This implies the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): $P(T^+|D) = 0.85$.\n- Specificity (True Negative Rate): $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these, we can derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\n- False Negative Rate: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- False Positive Rate: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\n**Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the Law of Total Probability. The probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.05) + (0.02)(0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0425 + 0.0190 = 0.0615$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0615} \\approx 0.6910569...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.6911$.\n\n**Calculation of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual with a negative test result is truly disease-free, which is the conditional probability $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we again use the Law of Total Probability. The probability of a negative test is the sum of the probabilities of a true negative and a false negative:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nAlternatively, since there are only two outcomes (positive or negative), $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+) = 1 - 0.0615 = 0.9385$. Let's verify by direct calculation:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.98)(0.95) + (0.15)(0.05)$$\n$$P(T^-) = 0.9310 + 0.0075 = 0.9385$$\nThe values match. Now we can compute the NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.98)(0.95)}{0.9385} = \\frac{0.9310}{0.9385} \\approx 0.9919978...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9920$.\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n- The Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is $0.6911$. This means that if a person receives a positive test result in this screening setting, there is a $69.11\\%$ probability that they are actually infected. The complementary probability, $1 - PPV = 1 - 0.6911 = 0.3089$, represents the probability that a positive result is a false positive ($P(D^c|T^+)$). Thus, approximately $30.89\\%$ of individuals who test positive are not actually infected. This relatively high false positive rate is a direct consequence of screening in a low-prevalence population, even with a highly specific test. It underscores the necessity of a confirmatory test (e.g., PCR) following a positive rapid antigen test.\n\n- The Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is $0.9920$. This indicates that if a person receives a negative test result, there is a $99.20\\%$ probability that they are truly not infected. The complementary probability, $1 - NPV = 1 - 0.9920 = 0.0080$, represents the probability that a negative result is a false negative ($P(D|T^-)$). Only about $0.80\\%$ of individuals who test negative are actually infected. The high NPV demonstrates that the test is very effective at ruling out the disease. In a community screening context, this reliability in negative results is crucial for correctly identifying uninfected individuals and managing public health resources.",

The objective is to distinguish genomic versus subgenomic or replicative intermediate RNA signals and to infer whether the detected signals indicate active replication in tissue. The foundational base is the Central Dogma of molecular biology and well-established virology facts: positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses use their genomic RNA directly as messenger RNA, generate negative-sense replication intermediates (antigenomes), and may produce subgenomic messenger RNAs; negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses package genomic RNA that requires transcription into positive-sense messenger RNAs and synthesis of positive-sense antigenomes for replication.\n\nCase descriptions and probe designs:\n\n1. SARS-CoV-2 (positive-sense single-stranded RNA) in lung tissue (Sample $A$):\n- Probe $P_1$: antisense probe complementary to a conserved genomic region, which detects positive-sense genomic RNA and any positive-sense subgenomic transcripts arising from discontinuous transcription.\n- Probe $P_2$: sense probe complementary to negative-sense antigenome, designed to detect negative-strand replication intermediates.\n- Probe $P_3$: leader–body junction probe specific for subgenomic messenger RNAs, recognizing the fused $5'$ leader and downstream open reading frame junctions.\nObserved signals: $P_1$ shows abundant cytoplasmic puncta with an average of $100$ puncta per infected cell; $P_3$ shows discrete puncta averaging $30$ per infected cell; $P_2$ shows fewer puncta, averaging $5$ per infected cell in a subset of cells.\n\n2.

Antigenome probe signal: average $4$ puncta/cell. mRNA probe signal: average $60$ puncta/cell.\n\n-   **Question**: Which statements correctly identify evidence of active viral replication in the described tissues?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of molecular virology. The descriptions of the replication strategies for coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses (Zika), and filoviruses (Ebola) are accurate. The use of strand-specific ISH probes to differentiate RNA species of different polarities is a standard, valid, and widely used experimental approach in pathology and virology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear experimental setup, specific data, and a precise question. The data are sufficient to draw logical conclusions based on the provided virological principles. A unique set of correct and incorrect options can be determined.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and unbiased. The data are quantitative. The question asks for an interpretation based on scientific evidence, not opinion.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and asks a verifiable question.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe central principle for identifying active viral replication is the detection of molecules that are exclusively produced during the replication process and are not components of the initial infectious virion. These are typically replicative intermediates.\n\n-   For **positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses** like SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus, the genome itself is a (+)RNA strand. This (+)RNA molecule is delivered into the host cell upon infection. Therefore, detecting (+)RNA alone is not sufficient to prove replication, as it could represent the input genome. The hallmark of active replication for these viruses is the synthesis of a **negative-sense (-)RNA antigenome**, which serves as the template for producing new (+)RNA genomes. The production of subgenomic mRNAs, if applicable to the virus family, is a sign of viral gene expression, which is coupled to the replication cycle.\n\n-   For **negative-sense single-stranded RNA ((-)ssRNA) viruses** like Ebola virus, the infectious virion contains the (-)RNA genome. This genome cannot be directly translated. It must first be transcribed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into **positive-sense messenger RNAs ((+)mRNAs)** for protein synthesis. For genome replication, a full-length **positive-sense (+)RNA antigenome** must be synthesized, which then serves as a template for new (-)RNA genomes. Therefore, the detection of either (+)mRNAs or the (+)antigenome is evidence of an active process beyond simple viral entry. The combination of both is conclusive evidence of a complete, active replication cycle.\n\nApplying these principles to the cases:\n\n-   **Sample $A$ (SARS-CoV-2)**: The detection of (-)sense antigenome by probe $P_2$ (even at low levels, as replicative intermediates are often transient and less abundant than genomic RNA) is direct evidence of active genome replication. The detection of subgenomic mRNAs by the leader-body junction probe $P_3$ is direct evidence of viral transcription, a key part of the active life cycle. The abundant (+)RNA signal from $P_1$ is consistent with, but not proof of, replication, as it detects both input and newly synthesized genomes and subgenomic RNAs. The concurrent detection of signals from $P_2$ and $P_3$ is irrefutable evidence of an active infection.\n\n-   **Sample $B$ (Zika)**: The signal for the (-)sense antigenome from probe $P_5$ is zero. The absence of this obligate replicative intermediate is strong evidence that active genome replication is not occurring, or is below the detection limit. While subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), detected by $P_6$, is a product of virus-host interaction, it is generated by a host exonuclease ($XRN1$) stalling on the $3'$ UTR of the viral (+)genomic RNA. This can happen to input genomes without requiring the full replication cycle to be active. Therefore, sfRNA presence in the absence of a (-)strand signal is not sufficient to prove active replication.\n\n-   **Sample $C$ (Ebola)**: The detection of a (+)sense antigenome is direct evidence of genome replication. The detection of (+)sense viral mRNAs is direct evidence of transcription. The data shows both are present. This confirms an active replication cycle. The detection of the (-)sense genome alone would be insufficient, as it could represent the initial inoculum of virions that have not initiated replication.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In Sample $A$ (SARS-CoV-2), concurrent detection of negative-strand signal by $P_2$ and leader–body junction signal by $P_3$ is evidence of active replication and transcription in infected cells.**\n-   As derived above, the negative-strand RNA (detected by $P_2$) is the replicative intermediate, proving replication. The leader-body junction sgRNAs (detected by $P_3$) are products of discontinuous transcription. Detecting both is definitive evidence of an active viral life cycle.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In Sample $A$, a high genomic signal detected by $P_1$ alone is sufficient to prove active replication in tissue.**\n-   Probe $P_1$ detects all (+)sense RNA, which includes the genomic RNA from the initial infectious virions. A high signal could accumulate from non-replicating virus particles or represent an abortive infection. Without detecting the (-)strand replicative intermediate, active replication cannot be confirmed.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In Sample $B$ (Zika), strong subgenomic flavivirus RNA ($P_6$) signal with absent negative-strand ($P_5$) signal is sufficient to prove active replication.**\n-   Active replication of a (+)ssRNA virus requires the presence of a (-)strand template. The data explicitly states this is absent ($P_5$ signal is $0$). The sfRNA detected by $P_6$ can be generated from pre-existing (+)genomic RNA and does not require the synthesis of new genomes. Therefore, this observation is not sufficient evidence of active replication.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In Sample $C$ (Ebola), detection of positive-sense antigenome together with abundant viral messenger RNAs indicates active replication and transcription, whereas genomic negative-sense signal alone would not be sufficient evidence of replication.**\n-   This statement correctly identifies the markers for an active (-)ssRNA virus infection cycle. The (+)antigenome is necessary for genome replication, and (+)mRNAs are products of transcription. Detecting both confirms a productive infection. The statement also correctly notes that the (-)genomic RNA signal alone is not sufficient proof, as it could be from the input virion.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**",

They aim to distinguish detection of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from true persistence of replication-competent virus and to formalize criteria for classifying persistence versus residual debris. Their assays include quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), strand-specific RT-qPCR for negative-strand RNA, subgenomic RNA detection, ribonuclease (RNase) pretreatment prior to extraction, cell culture on permissive airway epithelial cells with plaque-forming unit (PFU) quantification, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for nucleocapsid protein, in situ hybridization (ISH) with subcellular localization markers, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) detection using a J2 antibody, long-amplicon RT-PCR spanning $>$ $10$ kilobases, and whole-genome sequencing.\n\nFundamental bases:\n- For positive-strand RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, replication requires production of negative-strand RNA intermediates and subgenomic RNAs in infected cells.\n- Infectiousness is operationally defined by the ability to replicate in permissive cells and produce progeny virions, quantifiable by PFU assays; productive replication increases viral RNA over time in culture.\n- RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) is inversely related to template copy number $N$ via a log-linear relationship, $ \\mathrm{Ct} = \\alpha - \\beta \\log_{10} N$, with near-doubling per cycle implying that a decrease of $\\Delta \\mathrm{Ct}$ corresponds approximately to a $2^{\\Delta \\mathrm{Ct}}$-fold increase in $N$ when amplification efficiency is close to $100\\%$.\n- Free RNA in tissue decays approximately by first-order kinetics, $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$, with half-life $t_{1/2} = (\\ln 2)/\\lambda$.

Persistence requires evidence of productive replication in permissive cells demonstrated by a decrease in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ over time in culture and recovery of PFU, detection of replication intermediates (negative-strand RNA and subgenomic RNAs) within anatomically plausible target cells, and RNase resistance consistent with encapsidation; residual debris is indicated by high $\\mathrm{Ct}$ with further increase over time consistent with first-order decay, absence of replication intermediates, failure of culture to produce PFU or cytopathic effect, RNase sensitivity, fragmented genomes with failure of long-amplicon RT-PCR, and localization within phagolysosomal compartments of macrophages without dsRNA.\n\n- B. Persistence is established whenever any RT-qPCR signal is detected at any $\\mathrm{Ct}$ along with any IHC signal for nucleocapsid; residual debris is declared only when RT-qPCR is negative regardless of other evidence.\n\n- C.

The findings for Sample Q (increasing Ct, no PFU, absence of intermediates, RNA fragmentation, lysosomal localization) are consistent indicators of non-viable debris.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The described experimental workflow, while extensive, is realistic for a research setting studying viral persistence. The quantitative data (Ct values, PFU counts, genome size) are well within plausible ranges.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The question is well-posed. It asks for a synthesis of the provided information into a set of classification criteria, a task that has a definite, logical solution based on the premises.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem is not trivial; it requires the integration of multiple, distinct lines of experimental evidence to form a cohesive conclusion, reflecting the complexity of real-world virological research.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** All aspects of the problem are scientifically verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, well-posed, and based on established virological principles and experimental methods. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires establishing criteria to differentiate between two states: (1) persistence of replication-competent virus and (2) presence of residual, non-infectious viral debris. The provided data for Sample P and Sample Q serve as exemplar cases for each state.\n\n**Analysis of Sample P (Persistence of Replication-Competent Virus):**\n- **Functional Evidence (Infectivity):** The sample produces infectious progeny in cell culture. This is the definitive \"gold standard\" for infectivity. Evidence includes:\n    1.  A decrease in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ value from $24$ to $22$ over $72$ hours. This corresponds to a $2^{(24-22)} = 2^2 = 4$-fold increase in viral RNA, indicating amplification.\n    2.  Production of a significant titer of infectious particles, $1.2 \\times 10^{4}$ Plaque-Forming Units (PFU) per milliliter.\n    3.  Observation of cytopathic effect (CPE), meaning the virus is killing the host cells.\n- **Molecular Evidence (Active Replication):** The machinery of viral replication is active. Evidence includes:\n    1.  Detection of negative-strand RNA, the essential template for genome replication.\n    2.  Detection of subgenomic RNAs, the mRNAs required to produce structural proteins for new virions.\n    3.  Detection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a key replication intermediate.\n- **Biophysical Evidence (Viral Integrity):** The viral genome is intact and protected. Evidence includes:\n    1.  RNase resistance of the RNA, which becomes sensitive only after detergent treatment. This shows the RNA is inside a protective capsid/envelope.\n    2.  Successful amplification of a long-amplicon ($>15$ kilobases).\n    3.  Recovery of an intact, near-full-length genome ($\\approx 29.9$ kb) via sequencing.\n- **Anatomical Evidence (Cellular Context):** The virus is in a permissive environment. Evidence includes the localization of viral proteins and RNA to ACE2-positive epithelial cells, a known target for SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n\n**Analysis of Sample Q (Residual Viral Debris):**\n- **Functional Evidence (Non-infectivity):** The sample is unable to produce infectious virus. Evidence includes:\n    1.  An increase in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ value from $36$ to $38$ over $72$ hours. This corresponds to a $2^{(36-38)} = 2^{-2} = 1/4$-fold change, indicating a $75\\%$ loss of RNA, consistent with degradation (decay) and not replication.\n    2.  Failure to produce any PFU ($0$ PFU/mL).\n    3.  Absence of CPE.\n- **Molecular Evidence (No Active Replication):** The machinery of replication is absent. Evidence includes the failure to detect negative-strand RNA, subgenomic RNAs, or dsRNA.\n- **Biophysical Evidence (Degradation):** The viral RNA is fragmented and unprotected. Evidence includes:\n    1.  High initial $\\mathrm{Ct}$ of $36$, indicating very low template amount.\n    2.  RNase sensitivity ($\\approx 90\\%$ signal reduction without detergent), indicating the RNA is not properly encapsidated.\n    3.  Failure of long-amplicon RT-PCR and recovery of only fragmented reads by sequencing.\n- **Anatomical Evidence (Cellular Clearance):** The viral material is in a degradative compartment. Evidence includes the localization of nucleocapsid protein within LAMP1-positive lysosomes inside CD68-positive macrophages (phagocytic cells clearing up debris).\n\n**Synthesizing General Criteria:**\n- **Criteria for Persistence:** A definitive classification requires evidence of productive replication. This is best shown by a combination of (i) successful viral culture (increasing RNA load/PFU production) and (ii) detection of molecular intermediates of replication (negative-strand RNA, subgenomic RNA, and/or dsRNA). Supporting evidence includes an intact, protected genome and localization in a permissive cell type.\n- **Criteria for Residual Debris:** This is characterized by the absence of replication. Key signs are (i) failed culture (RNA quantity decays over time, no PFU), (ii) absence of replication intermediates, (iii) fragmented and/or unprotected RNA, and (iv) localization of viral material to phagolysosomes, indicating cellular clearance.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **Option A:** This option proposes a detailed set of criteria for both persistence and debris.\n    - For persistence, it requires \"productive replication in permissive cells demonstrated by a decrease in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ ... and recovery of PFU\", \"detection of replication intermediates (negative-strand RNA and subgenomic RNAs)\", and \"RNase resistance\". This aligns perfectly with the analysis of Sample P and the derived general criteria for persistence.\n    - For residual debris, it requires \"high $\\mathrm{Ct}$ with further increase over time\", \"absence of replication intermediates\", \"failure of culture to produce PFU\", \"RNase sensitivity\", \"fragmented genomes\", and \"localization within phagolysosomal compartments of macrophages without dsRNA\". This aligns perfectly with the analysis of Sample Q and the derived general criteria for debris.\n    - This option is comprehensive, accurate, and reflects the full scope of the evidence provided.\n    - **Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **Option B:** This option proposes that \"Persistence is established whenever any RT-qPCR signal is detected at any $\\mathrm{Ct}$ along with any IHC signal for nucleocapsid\".\n    - This criterion is insufficient and incorrect. Sample Q has both a positive RT-qPCR signal ($\\mathrm{Ct}=36$) and a positive IHC signal (N protein), yet is clearly non-replicating debris. This option would misclassify Sample Q. It oversimplifies a complex biological question and ignores the critical functional and molecular data.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **Option C:** This option proposes that \"Persistence is indicated by the presence of spike protein alone on IHC in any cell type and a single time-point positive RT-qPCR\".\n    - This is incorrect. The problem data uses nucleocapsid IHC, not spike. Focusing on a single protein is insufficient. Ignoring cell type is a major flaw, as localization in a phagocyte vs. an epithelial cell has drastically different implications. Relying on a single RT-qPCR result is proven inadequate by Sample Q. The criterion for debris (\"negative subgenomic RNA only\") is far too narrow and simplistic.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **Option D:** This option proposes that \"Persistence requires only the recovery of an intact long-amplicon RT-PCR product or near-complete genome\".\n    - This is insufficient. While an intact genome is a necessary condition for replication, it is not sufficient. A virus could be genetically intact but rendered non-infectious by neutralizing antibodies or other host factors. This criterion wrongly dismisses the \"gold standard\" of culture and the direct molecular evidence of replication intermediates. The criterion for debris (\"only culture failure\") is also insufficient, as it ignores the critical data on RNA decay kinetics and fragmentation.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only one that synthesizes the multiple, converging lines of evidence presented in the problem to form a scientifically rigorous and robust set of criteria for distinguishing viral persistence from residual debris.",
