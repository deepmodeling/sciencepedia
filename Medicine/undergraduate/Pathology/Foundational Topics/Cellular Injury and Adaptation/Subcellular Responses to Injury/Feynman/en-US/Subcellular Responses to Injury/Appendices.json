Let a fraction $f$ of glucose molecules entering metabolism be fully oxidized in mitochondria with yield $30$ ATP per glucose, and the remaining fraction $1-f$ be metabolized anaerobically to lactate with yield $2$ ATP per glucose.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, and they are consistent with established principles of physical chemistry and cell biology. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the proton motive force, $\\Delta p$, and calculate its value. The proton motive force is defined as the electrochemical potential difference for a proton, $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, normalized by the Faraday constant, $F$, for the transport of a proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) from the intermembrane space (IMS) to the mitochondrial matrix.\nThe change in electrochemical potential, $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, is given by the difference between the final state (matrix) and the initial state (IMS):\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{matrix}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{IMS}}\n$$\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\mu_i$, for an ionic species $i$ is defined from first principles as:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i + z_i F \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_i$ is the activity of the ion, $z_i$ is its charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the local electric potential. Assuming ideal dilute behavior, the activity $a_i$ can be approximated by the molar concentration, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$. For a proton, the charge number is $z = +1$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential into the equation for $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\left( \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^\\circ + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{matrix}} + zF\\psi_{\\text{matrix}} \\right) - \\left( \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^\\circ + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{IMS}} + zF\\psi_{\\text{IMS}} \\right)\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^\\circ$ is identical in both compartments and cancels out.

Since $\\Delta p$ is defined based on $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{matrix}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{IMS}}$, a negative value for $\\Delta p$ implies that $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is negative. This means $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{matrix}} < \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+},\\text{IMS}}$, indicating that the electrochemical potential of protons is lower in the matrix than in the intermembrane space. Processes proceed spontaneously down an electrochemical potential gradient. Therefore, a negative $\\Delta p$ drives the spontaneous flow of protons from the intermembrane space into the mitochondrial matrix. This is precisely the direction of proton flux through the F$_0$F$_1$-ATP synthase complex that is required to power the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.",

Coupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ decreases from about $2.31$ to about $0.91$ and $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ decreases from about $7.69$ to $0$. Uncoupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ decreases from about $4.44$ to about $3.75$ and $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ decreases from about $5.56$ to $0$.**\n-   **Coupled Preparation:** My calculation shows $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ changes from $2.3075$ to $0.909$, which matches \"about $2.31$\" to \"about $0.91$\". My calculation shows $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ changes from $7.6925$ to $0$, which matches \"about $7.69$\" to $0$. This part is correct.\n-   **Uncoupled Preparation:** My calculation shows $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ changes from $4.444$ to $3.75$, which matches \"about $4.44$\" to \"about $3.75$\". My calculation shows $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ changes from $5.556$ to $0$, which matches \"about $5.56$\" to $0$. This part is also correct.\nAll statements in this option are consistent with my derived results.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Coupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ increases to greater than $5.00$ due to relief of backpressure and $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ is unchanged. Uncoupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is unchanged and $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ decreases slightly.**\n-   My calculations show that for the coupled preparation, $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ *decreases* significantly, and $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ drops to zero. Inhibiting ATP synthase *increases* backpressure ($\\Delta p$), it does not relieve it. The premises and conclusions are incorrect.\n-   For the uncoupled preparation, $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ *decreases* (from $4.44$ to $3.75$), it is not unchanged. $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ drops to zero, which is a complete stop, not a slight decrease.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Coupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ decreases only slightly from about $2.31$ to about $2.00$, while uncoupled: $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ drops to about $0.91$. In both, $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ is unchanged.**\n-   For the coupled preparation, the decrease in $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is large (from $2.31$ to $0.91$), not slight.\n-   For the uncoupled preparation, the final $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is $3.75$, not $0.91$. The value $0.91$ is for the coupled preparation.\n-   In both cases, $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ drops to zero; it is not unchanged.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In both preparations, oligomycin reduces $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ to the same leak value near $0.91$ and reduces $v_{\\text{ATP}}$ to $0$, independent of proton leak conductance.**\n-   The statement that $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is reduced to the same value in both preparations is false. The final oxygen consumption rate is determined by the proton leak, which is different for the two preparations ($g_{\\text{leak}} = 0.1$ vs $g_{\\text{leak}} = 0.6$). This results in different final rates of $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ ($0.91$ vs $3.75$). The final rate is critically *dependent* on the proton leak conductance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
