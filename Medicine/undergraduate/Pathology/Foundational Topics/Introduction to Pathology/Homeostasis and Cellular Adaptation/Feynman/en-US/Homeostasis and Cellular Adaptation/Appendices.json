            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the potential of hydrogen, $pH$, in terms of the concentrations of bicarbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide, and then a calculation of the $pH$ given specific values for the parameters. The derivation is to start from the fundamental definitions of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, and $pH$.\n\nFirst, we consider the chemical equilibria of the bicarbonate buffer system in an aqueous solution. The overall process, which combines the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dissociation of the resulting carbonic acid, can be represented as:\n$$CO_2(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + HCO_3^-(aq)$$\nIn this equilibrium, dissolved carbon dioxide, $[\\text{CO}_2]$, acts as the weak acid, and bicarbonate, $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$, acts as its conjugate base. The problem statement specifies that this simplification is accounted for by using an effective acid dissociation constant, $K_a$.\n\nThe definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for a generic weak acid $HA$ dissociating into $H^+$ and $A^-$ ($HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$) is given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$\nApplying this definition to the bicarbonate buffer system, with $[\\text{CO}_2]$ as the acid and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ as the conjugate base, the effective acid dissociation constant is:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^+][ HCO_3^- ]}{[ CO_2 ]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes the molar concentration of the enclosed species.\n\nThe potential of hydrogen, $pH$, is defined as the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity, which is approximated by a dimensionless quantity corresponding to its molar concentration in dilute solutions:\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$$\nSimilarly, the $pK_a$ is defined as the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the acid dissociation constant:\n$$pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$$\n\nTo derive the required expression for $pH$, we begin by isolating the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^+]$, from the expression for $K_a$:\n$$[H^+] = K_a \\frac{[CO_2]}{[HCO_3^-]}$$\nNext, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\\log_{10}([H^+]) = \\log_{10}\\left(K_a \\frac{[ CO_2 ]}{[ HCO_3^- ]}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\log_{10}(x \\cdot y) = \\log_{10}(x) + \\log_{10}(y)$, we can separate the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\log_{10}([H^+]) = \\log_{10}(K_a) + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ CO_2 ]}{[ HCO_3^- ]}\\right)$$\nNow, we multiply the entire equation by $-1$:\n$$-\\log_{10}([H^+]) = -\\log_{10}(K_a) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ CO_2 ]}{[ HCO_3^- ]}\\right)$$\nBy substituting the definitions of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we obtain:\n$$pH = pK_a - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ CO_2 ]}{[ HCO_3^- ]}\\right)$$\nFinally, using the logarithmic identity $-\\log_{10}(x/y) = \\log_{10}(y/x)$, we can invert the concentration ratio to express the relationship in its conventional form, known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[ HCO_3^- ]}{[ CO_2 ]}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived expression for $pH$ in terms of $pK_a$ and the concentrations of the buffer components.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the $pH$ for a compartment with the given values:\n$pK_a = 6.1$\n$[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n$[\\text{CO}_2] = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The concentration units ($\\mathrm{mM}$) cancel within the argument of the logarithm, rendering it dimensionless as required.\n$$pH = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{25}{1.2}\\right)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the ratio of the concentrations:\n$$\\frac{25}{1.2} = \\frac{250}{12} = \\frac{125}{6}$$\nNumerically, this ratio is approximately $20.8333...$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the equation for $pH$:\n$$pH = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{125}{6}\\right)$$\nCalculating the logarithm:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{125}{6}\\right) \\approx 1.3187627$$\nFinally, we compute the $pH$:\n$$pH \\approx 6.1 + 1.3187627$$\n$$pH \\approx 7.4187627$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $7.4187627...$. The first four significant figures are $7.418$. The fifth significant digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$pH \\approx 7.419$$",
