It represents a standard application of the Hagen-Poiseuille model of fluid dynamics to a biophysical context. All necessary parameters are either given or are constants that cancel out in the final calculation. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation begins by considering the balance of forces on a cylindrical fluid element of radius $r$ and length $L$ within the capillary. For steady, laminar flow, the net force is zero. The force due to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, acting on the circular face of the element is given by $F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi r^2$. This driving force is balanced by the viscous drag force, $F_V$, exerted on the cylindrical surface. The drag force is the product of the shear stress, $\\tau$, and the surface area, $2\\pi r L$. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is related to the velocity gradient by $\\tau = -\\eta \\frac{dv}{dr}$, where $v$ is the fluid velocity at radius $r$ and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. The negative sign indicates that velocity decreases as the radius increases from the center.\n\nThe force balance equation is:\n$$F_P + F_V = 0$$\n$$\\Delta P \\pi r^2 + \\tau (2\\pi r L) = 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for shear stress:\n$$\\Delta P \\pi r^2 - \\eta \\frac{dv}{dr} (2\\pi r L) = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for the velocity gradient:\n$$\\frac{dv}{dr} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r$$\nTo find the velocity profile $v(r)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $r$. We apply the no-slip boundary condition, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the capillary wall (i.e., $v(R)=0$, where $R$ is the internal radius of the tube).\n$$\\int_{v(r)}^{v(R)=0} dv' = \\int_r^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r' dr'$$\n$$-v(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} \\right]_r^R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2)$$\nThis gives the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of laminar flow:\n$$v(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2)$$\nNext, we determine the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, by integrating the velocity profile over the entire cross-sectional area of the capillary. The differential flow rate, $dQ$, through an infinitesimal annulus of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is $dQ = v(r) dA = v(r) (2\\pi r dr)$.\n$$Q = \\int_0^R dQ = \\int_0^R v(r) 2\\pi r dr$$\n$$Q = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) 2\\pi r dr$$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\eta L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left[ R^2 \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R$$\nEvaluating the integral at its limits:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)$$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which shows the dependence of the volumetric flow rate on the tube radius:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P R^4}{8\\eta L}$$\nAs the problem states that $\\Delta P$, $L$, and $\\eta$ are constant, we can see that the flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $Q \\propto R^4$.\n\nWe can now compute the fractional reduction in flow, $\\rho$.\n$$\\rho \\equiv \\frac{Q_{\\text{pre}} - Q_{\\text{post}}}{Q_{\\text{pre}}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{\\text{post}}}{Q_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nUsing the derived relationship $Q \\propto R^4$, we can write:\n$$Q_{\\text{pre}} = C R_{\\text{pre}}^4$$\n$$Q_{\\text{post}} = C R_{\\text{post}}^4$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8\\eta L}$ is a constant.
