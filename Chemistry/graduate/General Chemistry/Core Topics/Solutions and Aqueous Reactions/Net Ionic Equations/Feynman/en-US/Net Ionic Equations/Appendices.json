A small aliquot of a soluble salt of dihydrogen phosphate, $\\ce{NaH2PO4}$, is introduced such that the total phosphate concentration is low enough not to perturb the imposed $\\mathrm{pH}$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with sufficient information for a unique solution. The given parameters and conditions are consistent with the principles of aqueous chemical equilibrium.\n\nThe central task is to identify the dominant reaction of dihydrogen phosphate, $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$, when it is introduced into a strongly basic aqueous solution buffered at a constant $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $11.00$, and to calculate the equilibrium constant for this reaction.\n\nFirst, we must determine the speciation of the phosphate system at the imposed $\\mathrm{pH}$. The relevant acid-base equilibria for orthophosphoric acid ($\\ce{H3PO4}$) are:\n1. $\\ce{H3PO4(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + H2PO4^{-}(aq)}$ with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a1} = 2.15$\n2. $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + HPO4^{2-}(aq)}$ with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a2} = 7.20$\n3. $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + PO4^{3-}(aq)}$ with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a3} = 12.37$\n\nThe distribution of these species is a function of $\\mathrm{pH}$. We compare the solution $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $11.00$ to the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ values. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is a logarithmic rearrangement of the acid dissociation constant expression ($K_a = \\frac{[\\ce{H^{+}}][\\ce{A^{-}}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}$), allows for the calculation of the relative concentrations of conjugate acid-base pairs. For any pair $\\ce{HA}/\\ce{A^{-}}$, the ratio of concentrations is given by $[\\ce{A^{-}}]/[\\ce{HA}] = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}$.\n\nWe analyze the ratios for the phosphate species at $\\mathrm{pH}=11.00$:\n- For the pair $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}/\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$ (governed by $K_{a2}$):\n$$ \\frac{[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]}{[\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a2}} = 10^{11.00 - 7.20} = 10^{3.80} \\approx 6310 $$\n- For the pair $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}/\\ce{PO4^{3-}}$ (governed by $K_{a3}$):\n$$ \\frac{[\\ce{PO4^{3-}}]}{[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a3}} = 10^{11.00 - 12.37} = 10^{-1.37} \\approx 0.0427 $$\n\nThese calculations demonstrate that at equilibrium in a $\\mathrm{pH}=11.00$ solution, the concentration of monohydrogen phosphate, $[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]$, is vastly greater than that of dihydrogen phosphate, $[\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}]$. Furthermore, the concentration of $[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]$ is also significantly greater than that of phosphate, $[\\ce{PO4^{3-}}]$. Thus, $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$ is the dominant phosphate species under these conditions.\n\nWhen the salt $\\ce{NaH2PO4}$ is introduced, the species $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ is added to the system. Since the solution is basic (with $[\\ce{OH^{-}}] = 10^{-(14.00-11.00)} = 10^{-3.00}\\,\\mathrm{M}$) and the equilibrium state is dominated by $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$, the introduced $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ must react to reach this equilibrium. As an amphiprotic species, $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ will act as an acid in a basic medium, reacting with $\\ce{OH^{-}}$. The product of this acid-base reaction is the conjugate base of $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$, which is $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$, and water. This leads to the following net ionic reaction:\n$$ \\ce{H2PO4^{-}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons HPO4^{2-}(aq) + H2O(l)} $$\nThis represents the single, dominant transformation that $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ undergoes upon addition to the buffer. While a subsequent reaction of $\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$ with $\\ce{OH^{-}}$ to form $\\ce{PO4^{3-}}$ also occurs to establish the final equilibrium, the primary step involving the reactant $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ is the one identified above. The very large equilibrium constant for this step, as will be shown, confirms it as the principal reaction.\n\nNext, we derive the equilibrium constant, $K$, for this net ionic reaction. The expression for $K$ is:\n$$ K = \\frac{a_{\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}} \\cdot a_{\\ce{H2O}}}{a_{\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}} \\cdot a_{\\ce{OH^{-}}}} $$\nAssuming an ideal solution and taking the activity of water as unity ($a_{\\ce{H2O}}=1$), this simplifies to:\n$$ K = \\frac{[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]}{[\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}][\\ce{OH^{-}}]} $$\nTo derive $K$ from the given fundamental constants, we can combine the equilibrium expressions for $K_{a2}$ and $K_w$:\n$$ K_{a2} = \\frac{[\\ce{H^{+}}][\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]}{[\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}]} $$\n$$ K_w = [\\ce{H^{+}}][\\ce{OH^{-}}] $$\nWe can rearrange the $K_{a2}$ expression to isolate the ratio present in the expression for $K$:\n$$ \\frac{[\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}]}{[\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}]} = \\frac{K_{a2}}{[\\ce{H^{+}}]} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K$:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{[\\ce{OH^{-}}]} \\left( \\frac{K_{a2}}{[\\ce{H^{+}}]} \\right) = \\frac{K_{a2}}{[\\ce{H^{+}}][\\ce{OH^{-}}]} $$\nRecognizing that the denominator is the definition of $K_w$, we find the relationship:\n$$ K = \\frac{K_{a2}}{K_w} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $K$. We are given the logarithmic forms, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a2} = 7.20$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_w = 14.00$.\nFirst, we find the values of $K_{a2}$ and $K_w$:\n$$ K_{a2} = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a2}} = 10^{-7.20} $$\n$$ K_w = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_w} = 10^{-14.00} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K$:\n$$ K = \\frac{10^{-7.20}}{10^{-14.00}} = 10^{-7.20 - (-14.00)} = 10^{14.00 - 7.20} = 10^{6.80} $$\nTo express this in standard notation, we calculate the value:\n$$ K = 10^{6.80} \\approx 6309573.44... $$\nRounding this value to three significant figures, as required, yields:\n$$ K \\approx 6.31 \\times 10^{6} $$\nThe large magnitude of this equilibrium constant confirms that the reaction of $\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}$ with $\\ce{OH^{-}}$ proceeds essentially to completion, which is consistent with our analysis of the species distribution at $\\mathrm{pH}=11.00$.",

It is therefore valid for rigorous analysis.\n\nThe task is to evaluate the thermodynamic tendency of two competing net ionic processes under specified initial conditions. This requires calculating the reaction quotient, $Q$, for each process and comparing it to the corresponding equilibrium constant, $K$.

Combine these elements to derive the final expression for $K_{f}^{\\prime}$ and compute its value.\n\nStep 1: Activity Coefficients\nThe Davies equation is given as $-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{i}=A z_{i}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)$.\nGiven $A=0.509$ and $I=0.10$, the term in the parentheses is constant for all ions in the solution:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{0.10}}{1+\\sqrt{0.10}} - 0.3(0.10) \\approx \\frac{0.31623}{1.31623} - 0.03 \\approx 0.24025 - 0.03 = 0.21025 $$\nFor monovalent ions ($z_{i}=\\pm 1$), such as $\\ce{H+}$ and $\\ce{NH4+}$:\n$$ -\\log_{10}\\gamma_{1} = (0.509)(1)^{2}(0.21025) \\approx 0.10702 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{1} = 10^{-0.10702} \\approx 0.7816 $$\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}} \\approx 0.7816$.\n\nFor divalent ions ($z_{i}=\\pm 2$), such as $\\ce{Cu^{2+}}$ and $\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$:\n$$ -\\log_{10}\\gamma_{2} = (0.509)(2)^{2}(0.21025) = 4 \\times 0.10702 \\approx 0.42808 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{2} = 10^{-0.42808} \\approx 0.3732 $$\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}} \\approx 0.3732$.\nThe activity coefficient of the neutral species $\\ce{NH3}$ is given as $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}} = 1$.\n\nStep 2: Relation between Thermodynamic and Concentration Constants\nThe thermodynamic cumulative formation constant for $\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$ is:\n$$ \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} = \\frac{a_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}}{a_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} (a_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}} = \\frac{[\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}]\\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}]\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} ([\\ce{NH3}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}} $$\nThe concentration-based constant is $\\beta_{4} = \\frac{[\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}]}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4}}$. Thus:\n$$ \\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} (\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}} $$\nSince $\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}=1$, the activity coefficient corrections for the complexation equilibrium cancel out:\n$$ \\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} $$\n\nStep 3: Side-Reaction Coefficient for Ammonia ($\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$)\nThe fraction of ammonia that is not protonated, $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{[\\ce{NH3}] + [\\ce{NH4+}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\ce{NH4+}]}{[\\ce{NH3}]}} $$\nThe thermodynamic acid dissociation constant for $\\ce{NH4+}$ is $K_{a}^{\\circ} = \\frac{a_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{a_{\\ce{NH4+}}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{[\\ce{NH4+}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}}$.\nRearranging for the concentration ratio:\n$$ \\frac{[\\ce{NH4+}]}{[\\ce{NH3}]} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{K_{a}^{\\circ}\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{K_{a}^{\\circ}\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}}} $$\nWe are given $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}^{\\circ} = 9.25$, so $K_{a}^{\\circ} = 10^{-9.25}$. The pH is $10.00$, so $a_{\\ce{H+}} = 10^{-10.00}$. Using $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}=1$ and $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}} \\approx 0.7816$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{(1)(10^{-10.00})}{(10^{-9.25})(0.7816)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-0.75}}{0.7816}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{0.17783}{0.7816}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.22752} = \\frac{1}{1.22752} \\approx 0.81465 $$\n\nStep 4: Derivation and Calculation of $K_{f}^{\\prime}$\nWe relate the defined conditional constant $K_{f}^{\\prime}$ to the concentration-based stability constant $\\beta_4$.\nStarting from the definition of $\\beta_4$:\n$$ [\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}] = \\beta_{4}[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $K_{f}^{\\prime}$:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{\\beta_{4}[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4}}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}]\\left(C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}\\right)^{4}} = \\beta_{4} \\left(\\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}}\\right)^{4} $$\nRecognizing the term in parentheses as $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$, we have:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\beta_{4}(\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4} $$\nAs established in Step 2, $\\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} = 10^{12.60}$. Now we can calculate the numerical value of $K_{f}^{\\prime}$:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = (10^{12.60}) (0.81465)^{4} $$\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} \\approx (3.981 \\times 10^{12}) (0.4398) \\approx 1.7509 \\times 10^{12} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $1.75 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\nBrief explanation of the result:\nThe calculated conditional formation constant, $K_{f}^{\\prime} \\approx 1.75 \\times 10^{12}$, is an exceptionally large number. This magnitude signifies that the equilibrium for the overall reaction $\\ce{Cu^{2+} + 4\\{\\text{total ammonia}\\} = [Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$ lies overwhelmingly to the product side under the specified conditions of $\\mathrm{pH}=10.00$ and $I=0.10$. A reaction with such a large equilibrium constant is considered quantitative, meaning it proceeds virtually to completion. Therefore, writing a net ionic equation with a single arrow (e.g., $\\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq) + 4NH3(aq) -> [Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}(aq)}$) is a chemically sound and useful simplification, as the reverse reaction is negligible.",
