We must account for non-ideal behavior of the charged species using the provided activity model.\n\nFirst, we define the solubility equilibrium of the solid base:\n$$B(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons B(\\mathrm{aq})$$\nThe equilibrium condition for a pure solid phase is that the activity of the dissolved species in a saturated solution is constant. Letting $a_{B(\\mathrm{aq})}$ be the activity of the neutral aqueous species $B(\\mathrm{aq})$, we have:\n$$a_{B(\\mathrm{aq})} = K_{s}$$\nwhere $K_{s}$ is the equilibrium constant for dissolution.

Therefore, the concentration of the neutral dissolved base at saturation is constant:\n$$[B(\\mathrm{aq})] = K_{s}$$\nThis constant concentration is the intrinsic solubility, $S_0$, which is given as $S_0 = 2.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$. Thus, in any saturated solution in equilibrium with the solid $B(\\mathrm{s})$, the concentration of the neutral species is fixed:\n$$[B(\\mathrm{aq})] = S_0$$\n\nSecond, we consider the acid-base equilibrium involving the conjugate acid $BH^{+}$:\n$$BH^{+}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightleftharpoons B(\\mathrm{aq}) + H^{+}(\\mathrm{aq})$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined in terms of activities:\n$$K_a = \\frac{a_{B(\\mathrm{aq})} a_{H^{+}}}{a_{BH^{+}}}$$\nWe are given $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a) = 7.90$, so $K_a = 10^{-7.90}$.

This is a co-saturation state.\nThe following two equilibrium conditions must be met simultaneously:\n(1) $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}}$\n(2) $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}}$\nLet $x$ be the moles per liter of precipitated $\\text{CaCO}_{3}$ and $y$ be the moles per liter of precipitated $\\text{CaSO}_{4}$. The mass balance equations are:\n(3) $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - x - y$\n(4) $[\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - x$\n(5) $[\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - y$\nLet the unknown final calcium concentration be $C_{\\text{eq}} = [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. From (1) and (4), we express $x$ in terms of $C_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$[\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}} / C_{\\text{eq}}$, so $x = C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}} / C_{\\text{eq}}$.\nFrom (2) and (5), we express $y$ in terms of $C_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$[\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}} / C_{\\text{eq}}$, so $y = C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}} / C_{\\text{eq}}$.\nSubstitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the calcium mass balance equation (3):\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - \\left(C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}}}{C_{\\text{eq}}}\\right) - \\left(C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}}}{C_{\\text{eq}}}\\right)$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = (C_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}}) + \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}} + K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}}}{C_{\\text{eq}}}$$\nMultiplying by $C_{\\text{eq}}$ yields a quadratic equation for $C_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{eq}}^2 - (C_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}}) C_{\\text{eq}} - (K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}} + K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}}) = 0$$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n$C_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} = -1.6 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n$K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}} + K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}} = 3.31 \\times 10^{-9} + 2.63 \\times 10^{-5} = 2.630331 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n$$C_{\\text{eq}}^2 - (-1.6 \\times 10^{-2}) C_{\\text{eq}} - (2.630331 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0$$\n$$C_{\\text{eq}}^2 + (1.6 \\times 10^{-2}) C_{\\text{eq}} - 2.630331 \\times 10^{-5} = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=1.6 \\times 10^{-2}$, and $c=-2.630331 \\times 10^{-5}$:\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-1.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\pm \\sqrt{(1.6 \\times 10^{-2})^2 - 4(1)(-2.630331 \\times 10^{-5})}}{2}$$\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-1.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\pm \\sqrt{2.56 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.0521324 \\times 10^{-4}}}{2}$$\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-1.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\pm \\sqrt{3.6121324 \\times 10^{-4}}}{2}$$\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-1.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\pm 1.900561 \\times 10^{-2}}{2}$$\nConcentration must be a positive quantity, so we take the positive root:\n$$C_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{-1.6 \\times 10^{-2} + 1.900561 \\times 10^{-2}}{2} = \\frac{0.300561 \\times 10^{-2}}{2} = 1.502805 \\times 10^{-3}$$\nSo, $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.502805 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\nWe must verify that both solids are indeed present, i.e., that the amounts precipitated, $x$ and $y$, are both positive.\n$x = C_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{calcite}}}{C_{\\text{eq}}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} - \\frac{3.31 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.502805 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 2.2025 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 9.978 \\times 10^{-4} > 0$.\n$y = C_{\\mathrm{SO}_{4}}^{\\mathrm{T}} - \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\mathrm{gypsum}}}{C_{\\text{eq}}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} - \\frac{2.63 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.502805 \\times 10^{-3}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 1.7500 \\times 10^{-2} = 2.500 \\times 10^{-3} > 0$.\nSince both $x$ and $y$ are positive, the assumption of co-precipitation is self-consistent. Both solids are present at equilibrium.\n\nThe final equilibrium calcium concentration is $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.502805 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.503 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.",
