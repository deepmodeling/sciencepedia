            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. It is a standard exercise in thermochemistry, and we shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe reaction under consideration is the gas-phase isomerization of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene at standard conditions ($T = 298 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, $P = 1 \\, \\mathrm{bar}$):\n$$ \\text{cis-}\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8\\text{(g)} \\longrightarrow \\text{trans-}\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8\\text{(g)} $$\nThe structure of 2-butene is $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3$. Both cis and trans isomers have the same connectivity and thus the same number and types of chemical bonds. Specifically, each molecule contains:\n- one carbon-carbon double bond ($\\text{C}=\\text{C}$)\n- two carbon-carbon single bonds ($\\text{C}-\\text{C}$)\n- eight carbon-hydrogen single bonds ($\\text{C}-\\text{H}$)\n\nPart (i): Estimation of Reaction Enthalpy from Average Bond Enthalpies\n\nThe standard enthalpy of a gas-phase reaction can be estimated by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and the energy released upon forming all bonds in the products. This is expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta H_{rxn}^\\circ \\approx \\sum D(\\text{bonds broken}) - \\sum D(\\text{bonds formed}) $$\nwhere $D$ represents the average bond dissociation enthalpy.\n\nFor the reactant, cis-2-butene, the sum of the bond enthalpies is:\n$$ \\sum D_{\\text{reactants}} = (1 \\times D_{\\text{C}=\\text{C}}) + (2 \\times D_{\\text{C}-\\text{C}}) + (8 \\times D_{\\text{C}-\\text{H}}) $$\nFor the product, trans-2-butene, the sum of the bond enthalpies is:\n$$ \\sum D_{\\text{products}} = (1 \\times D_{\\text{C}=\\text{C}}) + (2 \\times D_{\\text{C}-\\text{C}}) + (8 \\times D_{\\text{C}-\\text{H}}) $$\nSince the number and types of bonds are identical for the reactant and the product, the estimated change in enthalpy, which we denote $\\Delta H_{\\text{bond}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{bond}} = \\sum D_{\\text{reactants}} - \\sum D_{\\text{products}} $$\nThe terms on both sides of the subtraction are identical, as the bond inventory is unchanged. This cancellation is a direct consequence of using *average* bond enthalpies, which do not account for the specific molecular environment of each bond.\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{bond}} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nPart (ii): Calculation of Reaction Enthalpy from Standard Enthalpies of Formation\n\nHess's law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the pathway taken because enthalpy is a state function. We can construct a thermodynamic cycle using the formation reactions of the reactant and product from their constituent elements in their standard states (graphite for carbon, $\\text{C(s, graphite)}$, and hydrogen gas, $\\text{H}_2\\text{(g)}$).\n\nThe standard enthalpy of reaction, $\\Delta H_{rxn}^\\circ$, can be calculated directly from the standard enthalpies of formation, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$, as:\n$$ \\Delta H_{rxn}^\\circ = \\sum n_p \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{products}) - \\sum n_r \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{reactants}) $$\nwhere $n_p$ and $n_r$ are the stoichiometric coefficients. For this isomerization, the calculation, which we denote $\\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}} = (1 \\ \\mathrm{mol}) \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{trans-2-butene(g)}) - (1 \\ \\mathrm{mol}) \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{cis-2-butene(g)}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{cis-2-butene(g)}) = -20.62 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{trans-2-butene(g)}) = -26.30 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}} = (-26.30 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) - (-20.62 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) = -26.30 + 20.62 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}} = -5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nCalculation of the Discrepancy, $\\Delta$\n\nThe signed discrepancy is defined as $\\Delta \\equiv \\Delta H_{\\text{bond}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}}$.\n$$ \\Delta = (0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) - (-5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta = 5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nAnalysis of the Discrepancy\n\nThe existence of a non-zero discrepancy is fundamental and not a result of experimental error. It reveals the distinction between a precise thermodynamic quantity and an approximation.\n\n$1$. **Enthalpies of Formation are Exact:** The standard enthalpy of formation, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$, is a rigorously defined thermodynamic quantity. It measures the enthalpy change when one mole of a specific compound is formed from its constituent elements in their most stable reference states at standard conditions. The calculation using $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$ values is, therefore, an accurate determination of the true enthalpy change between the initial state (cis-2-butene) and the final state (trans-2-butene). It correctly captures all energetic contributions, including those from electronic structure and molecular geometry.\n\n$2$. **Average Bond Enthalpies are Approximations:** Average bond enthalpy is a conceptual tool, not an exact property of a bond in a specific molecule. The tabulated value for a $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ bond, for instance, is an average taken over many different chemical compounds. The actual energy of a $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ bond depends on its specific molecular environment (e.g., hybridization, adjacent functional groups, steric interactions). The bond-enthalpy method approximates a molecule's enthalpy of atomization by summing these average values.\n\n$3$. **Physical Origin of the Discrepancy:** The isomerization from cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene involves a change in molecular geometry, not in bond connectivity. In the cis isomer, the two bulky methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) groups are on the same side of the $\\text{C}=\\text{C}$ double bond, leading to repulsive steric strain (a form of van der Waals repulsion). This strain destabilizes the molecule, raising its enthalpy. In the trans isomer, the methyl groups are on opposite sides, minimizing this repulsion. The trans isomer is therefore more stable (lower in enthalpy) than the cis isomer. The bond-enthalpy method, by its very nature, is insensitive to such stereochemical differences, incorrectly predicting $\\Delta H_{\\text{bond}} = 0$. The calculation from $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$ values, however, correctly reflects this stability difference, yielding $\\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}} = -5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. The discrepancy, $\\Delta = 5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, is therefore a quantitative measure of the stabilization energy of the trans isomer relative to the cis isomer (or, equivalently, the destabilizing steric strain energy in the cis isomer) that the average bond enthalpy model fails to capture.\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested gives $5.680$.",

Define the deviation $\\Delta$ by $\\Delta=\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}-\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n- Hess’s law of heat summation (enthalpy is a state function; the sum of enthalpy changes around any closed cycle is $0$).\n- The definition of lattice enthalpy of formation and standard enthalpy of formation from the elements.\n- Coulomb’s law for electrostatic interactions between charges.\n- The physical meaning of polarization (distortion of the electron cloud of an anion by a cation) and polarizability (ease of such distortion), and the concept of partial covalency arising from polarization.\n\nConsider two families: the alkali halides $\\text{NaX}$ and the coinage-metal halides $\\text{AgX}$ with $\\text{X}\\in\\{\\text{F},\\text{Cl},\\text{Br},\\text{I}\\}$. Assume all solids are isostructural and that the gas-phase steps used in the Born–Haber cycle (atomization/sublimation of the metal, bond dissociation of $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\text{X}_2(g)$, ionization enthalpy of the metal atom, electron affinity of the halogen atom) are those of isolated species and do not involve condensed-phase polarization.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly explain how polarization and covalency in the solid manifest as deviations between $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$, and how these deviations are expected to trend across $\\text{F}\\to\\text{I}$ and across $\\text{NaX}$ versus $\\text{AgX}$?\n\nA. In a Born–Haber analysis based on Hess’s law, any stabilization present only in the condensed phase and absent for separated gaseous ions must appear in the lattice enthalpy term; therefore increased polarization and partial covalency make $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ more exothermic than $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$ (so $\\Delta<0$), with the magnitude of the negative deviation increasing for more polarizable anions.\n\nB.

For salts of small, highly charged cations paired with large, easily polarizable anions, polarization weakens the electrostatic attraction by reducing the effective ionic charges; consequently the experimental lattice enthalpy becomes less exothermic than the rigid-ion prediction (so $\\Delta>0$).\n\nD.

Schematically, for $\\text{M}^+(g) + \\text{X}^-(g) \\to \\text{MX}(s)$:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}} = \\Delta_{f} H^\\circ(\\text{MX}, s) - \\left[ \\Delta_{sub} H^\\circ(\\text{M}, s) + IE(\\text{M}, g) + \\frac{1}{2} D_e(\\text{X}_2, g) + EA(\\text{X}, g) \\right] $$\n    Because all terms on the right-hand side are experimentally determined, $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ represents the *true* enthalpy change for the formation of the solid lattice from its constituent gaseous ions. It implicitly accounts for *all* bonding interactions present in the real crystal, including pure electrostatic (ionic) forces, polarization effects, covalent character, and van der Waals interactions.\n\n2.  **The Model Lattice Enthalpy, $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$**: This is a theoretical value calculated from a model that assumes the solid is composed of perfectly spherical, non-polarizable (\"rigid\") ions of charge $\\pm z$. The potential energy is calculated by summing the Coulombic attractions and repulsions (scaled by the Madelung constant) and a term for short-range repulsion. This model, by its very construction, captures *only* the purely ionic component of the bonding. It deliberately ignores any charge cloud distortion (polarization) and the resulting covalent character.\n\n3.  **The Deviation, $\\Delta$**: The deviation $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}} - \\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$ thus quantifies the energetic contribution from all physical effects present in the real solid but *omitted* from the simple ionic model. The most significant of these effects is polarization, where the cation's electric field distorts the anion's electron cloud. This distortion leads to an accumulation of electron density between the two nuclei, which is the definition of a partial covalent bond. A covalent bond is a strong, stabilizing interaction. This means that polarization provides *additional* stability to the lattice, making the true lattice formation process *more exothermic* (i.e., more negative $\\Delta H$) than the purely ionic model would predict.\n    Therefore, when significant polarization and covalency are present:\n    $$ |\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}| > |\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}| $$\n    Since both quantities are negative, this implies $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ is more negative than $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$.\n    For example, if $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}} = -700 \\, \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}} = -800 \\, \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, the deviation is $\\Delta = (-800) - (-700) = -100 \\, \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. A non-zero, negative $\\Delta$ is the signature of covalent character.\n\n4.  **Trends in Polarization (Fajans' Rules)**: Covalent character is maximized with:\n    -   A highly polarizing cation: small size, high positive charge (e.g., $\\text{Al}^{3+}$), or a non-noble-gas electron configuration (e.g., $\\text{Ag}^+$).\n    -   A highly polarizable anion: large size, high negative charge (e.g., $\\text{I}^-$, $\\text{S}^{2-}$).\n\n    Applying this to the given series:\n    -   **Within $\\text{MX}$ series**: Anion polarizability increases significantly from $\\text{F}^-$ to $\\text{I}^-$. Thus, covalent character, and the magnitude of the negative deviation $\\Delta$, should increase in the order $\\text{MF} < \\text{MCl} < \\text{MBr} < \\text{MI}$.\n    -   **Between $\\text{NaX}$ and $\\text{AgX}$ series**: The $\\text{Na}^+$ ion has a noble-gas configuration and is a \"hard,\" weakly polarizing cation. The $\\text{Ag}^+$ ion, despite a similar ionic radius, has a $d^{10}$ configuration which shields the nuclear charge less effectively, making it a \"soft,\" strongly polarizing cation. Consequently, for any given halide $\\text{X}^-$, the covalent character and the magnitude of $\\Delta$ will be substantially larger for $\\text{AgX}$ than for $\\text{NaX}$.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In a Born–Haber analysis based on Hess’s law, any stabilization present only in the condensed phase and absent for separated gaseous ions must appear in the lattice enthalpy term; therefore increased polarization and partial covalency make $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ more exothermic than $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$ (so $\\Delta<0$), with the magnitude of the negative deviation increasing for more polarizable anions.**\nThis statement is correct. The Born-Haber cycle forces $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ to be the term that balances the energy budget, so it must contain all real solid-state interactions. Polarization/covalency is a stabilizing interaction, making the real lattice energy more exothermic (more negative) than the ionic model's prediction. This results in a negative deviation, $\\Delta < 0$. The magnitude of this effect, and thus the magnitude of $\\Delta$, increases with anion polarizability. The reasoning is flawless.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because electron affinity and ionization enthalpy are gas-phase properties and enter explicitly in the Born–Haber cycle, enhanced covalency in the crystal primarily alters those steps; thus the lattice enthalpy extracted from the cycle is insensitive to polarization, and $\\Delta\\approx 0$ even for highly polarizable $\\text{AgX}$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Ionization enthalpy and electron affinity are, by definition, properties of isolated gaseous species. Covalency is an interaction that exists *only* within the condensed-phase crystal. Its energetic effect cannot manifest in the gas-phase terms. The problem statement itself specifies these are gas-phase values for isolated species. Therefore, the energetic contribution of covalency must be contained within the lattice enthalpy term, $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$. The conclusion that $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ is insensitive to polarization is the opposite of the truth. Consequently, the claim that $\\Delta \\approx 0$ for $\\text{AgX}$ is incorrect; silver halides are paradigm examples of compounds with significant covalency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For salts of small, highly charged cations paired with large, easily polarizable anions, polarization weakens the electrostatic attraction by reducing the effective ionic charges; consequently the experimental lattice enthalpy becomes less exothermic than the rigid-ion prediction (so $\\Delta>0$).**\nThe premise identifies conditions for strong polarization correctly. However, the conclusion about the energetic consequence is wrong. Polarization involves the sharing of electron density, which constitutes a covalent bond. This is an *additional* attractive force, superposed on the ionic attraction. This *strengthens* the overall bonding, not weakens it. A stronger bond corresponds to a more stable lattice and a more exothermic (more negative) lattice enthalpy. The claim that $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ becomes less exothermic, leading to $\\Delta > 0$, is contrary to established chemical principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Agreement between $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$ is expected to be much better for “hard-ion” salts such as $\\text{NaF}$ than for “soft-ion” salts such as $\\text{AgI}$, consistent with minimal polarization in the former and substantial polarization in the latter.**\nThis statement is correct. \"Better agreement\" implies a small deviation $\\Delta$. The salt $\\text{NaF}$ consists of a small, non-polarizing cation ($\\text{Na}^+$) and a small, non-polarizable anion ($\\text{F}^-$). It is a classic \"hard-hard\" interaction, and the purely ionic model works very well, so $\\Delta \\approx 0$. The salt $\\text{AgI}$ consists of a strongly polarizing cation ($\\text{Ag}^+$) and a large, highly polarizable anion ($\\text{I}^-$). It is a classic \"soft-soft\" interaction with substantial covalent character. The ionic model fails significantly, leading to a large negative deviation $\\Delta$. The statement correctly identifies these behaviors and their physical origin.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Within a homologous series $\\text{MX}$ at fixed $\\text{M}$, the magnitude of $\\Delta$ is expected to increase monotonically from $\\text{F}$ to $\\text{I}$ in the negative direction (more exothermic experimental lattice enthalpy relative to the rigid-ion model), reflecting the increase in anion polarizability and partial covalency along $\\text{F}\\to\\text{I}$.**\nThis statement is correct. Moving down the halogens from $\\text{F}$ to $\\text{I}$, the anion size and the number of electron shells increase, making the electron cloud more diffuse and thus more polarizable. For a fixed cation $\\text{M}^+$, this increased polarizability leads to a greater degree of polarization and partial covalency in the bond. This results in progressively greater stabilization of the real lattice compared to the ionic model's prediction. Therefore, the deviation $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{exp}} - \\Delta_{\\text{lat}} H^\\circ_{\\text{ionic}}$ becomes increasingly negative along the series $\\text{MF, MCl, MBr, MI}$. The phrase \"increase monotonically... in the negative direction\" correctly describes this trend.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
