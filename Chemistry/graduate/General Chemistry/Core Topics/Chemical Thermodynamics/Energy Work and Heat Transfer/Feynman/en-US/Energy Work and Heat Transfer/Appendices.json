            "introduction": "A central principle in thermodynamics is that work is not a state function; its value depends on the specific path taken between initial and final states. This exercise provides a concrete illustration of this principle by asking you to calculate the work done by an ideal gas during expansion along three distinct thermodynamic paths . By comparing the results from a reversible isothermal path, a reversible polytropic path, and an irreversible path, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how process conditions dictate the amount of energy that can be exchanged as work.",

            "problem": "A sample containing $n_{\\mathrm{mol}}$ moles of an ideal gas is confined in a frictionless, weightless, thermally conductive piston–cylinder assembly. The initial equilibrium state is characterized by volume $V_{1}$, temperature $T_{0}$, and pressure $P_{1}$ satisfying the Ideal Gas Law $P_{1} V_{1} = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_{0}$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant. The gas expands to a larger volume $V_{2} > V_{1}$ along each of the following three distinct paths:\n\n(i) A reversible isothermal expansion at temperature $T_{0}$ from $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$.\n\n(ii) A reversible polytropic expansion that obeys the path equation $P V^{\\alpha} = \\text{constant}$ with a fixed polytropic exponent $\\alpha \\neq 1$, from $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$.\n\n(iii) An irreversible expansion against a constant external pressure. For this path, the cylinder is in contact with a very large thermal reservoir that maintains the gas at temperature $T_{0}$ throughout, and the constant external pressure is chosen so that the piston comes to mechanical equilibrium exactly at $V_{2}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of pressure–volume work, and using only core laws such as the Ideal Gas Law where appropriate, derive closed-form expressions for the work $W$ done by the system for each path, using the thermodynamic sign convention that work done by the system is negative. Express each result in terms of $P_{1}$, $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, $\\alpha$, $n_{\\mathrm{mol}}$, $R$, and $T_{0}$ as needed, eliminating redundant variables where possible.\n\nThen, for the case $V_{2} > V_{1}$, compare the magnitudes of the three works and state which is larger or smaller in the regimes $\\alpha > 1$ and $\\alpha < 1$. Your reasoning should be based on first principles and clearly justified.\n\nReport your three work expressions in the order (i), (ii), (iii) as a single row matrix.

            "solution": "The problem statement is C\nchemically and thermodynamically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in chemical thermodynamics involving the calculation and comparison of work done by an ideal gas during expansion along different thermodynamic paths. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe fundamental definition of pressure-volume work ($W$) done on a system as it changes volume from $V_1$ to $V_2$ against a variable external pressure $P_{ext}$ is given by the integral:\n$$ W = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV $$\nThe problem specifies using the thermodynamic sign convention where work done *by* the system is negative. The expression above adheres to this convention: for an expansion ($V_2 > V_1$), $dV$ is positive, and the integral results in a negative value for work, $W < 0$, signifying that the system performs work on its surroundings.\n\nFor a mechanically reversible process, the system is in continuous equilibrium with its surroundings, which implies that the external pressure $P_{ext}$ is at all times equal to the internal pressure of the gas, $P$. For an irreversible process, $P_{ext}$ is not necessarily equal to $P$, and the specified external pressure must be used.\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by $(P_1, V_1, T_0)$, and it is stated that these quantities are related by the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$ P_1 V_1 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 $$\nThis relationship will be used to simplify the final expressions for work.\n\n**Path (i): Reversible Isothermal Expansion**\nFor this path, the process is reversible, so $P_{ext} = P$. The process is also isothermal at a constant temperature $T = T_0$. For an ideal gas, the pressure is given by $P = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V}$.\nThe work done, $W_i$, is calculated as follows:\n$$ W_{i} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P dV = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V} dV $$\nSince $n_{\\mathrm{mol}}$, $R$, and $T_0$ are constants, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ W_{i} = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{1}{V} dV = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\left[ \\ln(V) \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} $$\n$$ W_{i} = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 (\\ln(V_2) - \\ln(V_1)) = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) $$\nUsing the initial state condition $P_1 V_1 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0$, this can be written as:\n$$ W_{i} = -P_1 V_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) $$\n\n**Path (ii): Reversible Polytropic Expansion**\nThis path is reversible, so $P_{ext} = P$. The process follows the relation $P V^{\\alpha} = C$, where $C$ is a constant and $\\alpha \\neq 1$. From the initial state, we find the constant to be $C = P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}$. Thus, the pressure along the path is $P(V) = P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V^{-\\alpha}$.\nThe work done, $W_{ii}$, is:\n$$ W_{ii} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P dV = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} (P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}) V^{-\\alpha} dV = -P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-\\alpha} dV $$\nSince $\\alpha \\neq 1$, we can integrate $V^{-\\alpha}$:\n$$ W_{ii} = -P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{V^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = - \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\left( V_2^{1-\\alpha} - V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms yields:\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha-1} \\left( V_2^{1-\\alpha} - V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_2^{1-\\alpha} - P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) $$\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_2^{1-\\alpha} - P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} $$\nFactoring out $P_1 V_1$:\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( \\frac{V_1^{\\alpha-1}}{V_2^{\\alpha-1}} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} - 1 \\right) $$\n\n**Path (iii): Irreversible Expansion Against a Constant External Pressure**\nThis process is irreversible, so we must use the given external pressure $P_{ext}$ in the work integral. The problem states that $P_{ext}$ is constant and chosen such that the system reaches mechanical equilibrium at the final volume $V_2$. This means $P_{ext}$ must be equal to the final pressure of the gas, $P_2$.\nThe process occurs while the cylinder is in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T_0$, which maintains the gas temperature at $T_0$ throughout. Thus, the final temperature is $T_2 = T_0$.\nUsing the Ideal Gas Law for the final state $(P_2, V_2, T_0)$:\n$$ P_2 V_2 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 $$\nSo the constant external pressure is $P_{ext} = P_2 = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V_2}$.\nUsing the initial condition $n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 = P_1 V_1$, we get $P_{ext} = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2}$.\nThe work, $W_{iii}$, is:\n$$ W_{iii} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV = -P_{ext} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} dV = -P_{ext} (V_2 - V_1) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{ext}$:\n$$ W_{iii} = -\\frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2} (V_2 - V_1) = -P_1 V_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right) $$\n\n**Comparison of Work Magnitudes**\nSince the process is an expansion ($V_2 > V_1$), the work done by the system is positive, and according to the sign convention used, the values $W_i$, $W_{ii}$, and $W_{iii}$ are all negative. To compare the \"magnitudes\" of work done, we compare the absolute values $|W|$, which correspond to the total energy transferred as work from the system to the surroundings. This is equivalent to comparing the area under the respective $P_{ext}(V)$ curves from $V_1$ to $V_2$ on a $P-V$ diagram. Let $W_{by} = -W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV$. A \"larger\" work corresponds to a larger value of $W_{by}$.\n\nLet $x = V_2/V_1 > 1$. The work magnitudes (scaled by $P_1 V_1$) are:\n$|W_i| / (P_1 V_1) = \\ln(x)$\n$|W_{ii}| / (P_1 V_1) = \\frac{1 - x^{1-\\alpha}}{\\alpha-1}$\n$|W_{iii}| / (P_1 V_1) = 1 - 1/x$\n\nComparison of Reversible Isothermal work ($|W_i|$) and Irreversible work ($|W_{iii}|$):\nFor a reversible expansion, the external pressure $P_{ext} = P(V) = P_1V_1/V$ decreases as volume increases. For the irreversible expansion, the external pressure is held constant at the final, lowest pressure, $P_{ext} = P_2 = P_1V_1/V_2$. For any intermediate volume $V \\in (V_1, V_2)$, we have $P(V) = P_1V_1/V > P_1V_1/V_2 = P_{ext}$. Since the pressure for the reversible path is always greater than the pressure for the irreversible path (except at the end point), the work done is greater for the reversible path.\nTherefore, $|W_i| > |W_{iii}|$. This is a general principle: maximum expansion work is obtained via a reversible path.\n\nComparison involving Polytropic work ($|W_{ii}|$):\nTo compare the polytropic path to the isothermal path, we examine the pressures along each path starting from $(P_1, V_1)$.\n$P_{ii}(V) = P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha$ and $P_i(V) = P_1(V_1/V)$.\nFor $V > V_1$, the ratio $V_1/V < 1$.\n\nCase 1: Regime $\\alpha > 1$\nHere, $\\alpha - 1 > 0$. Thus, $(V_1/V)^{\\alpha-1} < 1$, which implies $P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha < P_1(V_1/V)$, so $P_{ii}(V) < P_i(V)$ for $V > V_1$.\nThe polytropic curve lies below the isothermal curve. Consequently, the area under the curve is smaller: $|W_{ii}| < |W_i|$.\nThe detailed comparison of $|W_{ii}|$ and $|W_{iii}|$ shows the ordering depends on the specific value of $\\alpha$: $|W_i| > |W_{ii}| \\ge |W_{iii}|$ for $1 < \\alpha \\le 2$, and $|W_i| > |W_{iii}| > |W_{ii}|$ for $\\alpha > 2$.\n\nCase 2: Regime $\\alpha < 1$\nHere, $\\alpha - 1 < 0$. Thus, $(V_1/V)^{\\alpha-1} > 1$, which implies $P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha > P_1(V_1/V)$, so $P_{ii}(V) > P_i(V)$ for $V > V_1$.\nThe polytropic curve lies above the isothermal curve. Consequently, the area under the curve is larger: $|W_{ii}| > |W_i|$.\nCombining this with our established fact that $|W_i| > |W_{iii}|$, the complete ordering of work magnitudes is:\n$$ |W_{ii}| > |W_i| > |W_{iii}| $$\nIn summary, for an expansion, the reversible isothermal process yields more work than the irreversible one. The polytropic work can be greater or smaller than the isothermal work, depending on whether the gas heats up ($\\alpha < 1$) or cools down ($\\alpha > 1$) during the expansion.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the net work and heat transferred for each leg of a specific thermodynamic cycle. Before embarking on the calculation, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\nThe system is $n$ moles of an ideal gas with a constant molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$. The process is a reversible rectangular cycle on a Pressure-Volume ($P$-$V$) diagram, traversed through states $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$.\nThe states are defined by pressures $P_1, P_2$ (with $P_2 > P_1 > 0$) and volumes $V_1, V_2$ (with $V_2 > V_1 > 0$).\nThe legs are:\n-   $1 \\to 2$: Isobaric expansion at $P=P_1$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$. State coordinates are $1:(P_1, V_1)$ and $2:(P_1, V_2)$.\n-   $2 \\to 3$: Isochoric heating at $V=V_2$ from $P_1$ to $P_2$. State coordinates are $2:(P_1, V_2)$ and $3:(P_2, V_2)$.\n-   $3 \\to 4$: Isobaric compression at $P=P_2$ from $V_2$ to $V_1$. State coordinates are $3:(P_2, V_2)$ and $4:(P_2, V_1)$.\n-   $4 \\to 1$: Isochoric cooling at $V=V_1$ from $P_2$ to $P_1$. State coordinates are $4:(P_2, V_1)$ and $1:(P_1, V_1)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the chemistry sign convention, where the First Law of Thermodynamics is $\\Delta U = q + w$. Here, $q$ is heat transferred into the system and $w$ is work done on the system.\nThe derivation must be based on these fundamental statements:\n1.  Ideal Gas Law: $P V = n R T$\n2.  First Law of Thermodynamics: $\\Delta U = q + w$\n3.  Reversible work: $w = -\\int P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$\n4.  Internal energy of an ideal gas: $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V\\,\\mathrm{d}T$\n\nThe final expressions must be in terms of $P_1, P_2, V_1, V_2, R,$ and $C_V$.\n\nStep 2: Validate a priori\nThe problem describes a standard, albeit specific, thermodynamic cycle. It is based on established principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas model. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters and laws provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. There are no scientific contradictions or infeasible conditions. The system described corresponds to a refrigeration cycle, where net work is done on the system to transfer heat, which is a physically sound process. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Derivation\nThe derivation will proceed by calculating the work $w$ and change in internal energy $\\Delta U$ for each leg of the cycle. The heat transfer $q$ will then be determined from the First Law, $q = \\Delta U - w$.\n\nFirst, we establish a general expression for the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for any process involving this ideal gas. From $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V\\,\\mathrm{d}T$ and the ideal gas law $T = \\frac{PV}{nR}$, we can write the differential of temperature as $\\mathrm{d}T = \\frac{1}{nR}\\mathrm{d}(PV)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}U$ yields $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V \\left(\\frac{1}{nR}\\mathrm{d}(PV)\\right) = \\frac{C_V}{R}\\mathrm{d}(PV)$. Integrating this for a finite process from an initial state $(P_i, V_i)$ to a final state $(P_f, V_f)$ gives:\n$$\n\\Delta U = \\frac{C_V}{R} (P_f V_f - P_i V_i)\n$$\nThis relation is crucial as it allows calculation of $\\Delta U$ without explicit use of temperature $T$ or the number of moles $n$.\n\nCalculation of Net Work, $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$\nThe net work for the cycle is the sum of the work for each leg: $w_{\\mathrm{net}} = w_{12} + w_{23} + w_{34} + w_{41}$. Using the definition $w = -\\int P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$:\n-   Leg $1 \\to 2$ (isobaric expansion at $P_1$):\n    $w_{12} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_1\\,\\mathrm{d}V = -P_1(V_2 - V_1)$\n-   Leg $2 \\to 3$ (isochoric process, $\\mathrm{d}V=0$):\n    $w_{23} = 0$\n-   Leg $3 \\to 4$ (isobaric compression at $P_2$):\n    $w_{34} = -\\int_{V_2}^{V_1} P_2\\,\\mathrm{d}V = -P_2(V_1 - V_2) = P_2(V_2 - V_1)$\n-   Leg $4 \\to 1$ (isochoric process, $\\mathrm{d}V=0$):\n    $w_{41} = 0$\n\nThe net work is the sum:\n$w_{\\mathrm{net}} = -P_1(V_2 - V_1) + 0 + P_2(V_2 - V_1) + 0 = (P_2 - P_1)(V_2 - V_1)$.\nSince $P_2 > P_1$ and $V_2 > V_1$, $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$ is positive, indicating that net work is performed on the system over the cycle.\n\nCalculation of Heat Transfers, $q_{12}, q_{23}, q_{34}, q_{41}$\nWe calculate the heat transfer for each leg using $q = \\Delta U - w$.\n\n-   Leg $1 \\to 2$:\n    $\\Delta U_{12} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_1V_2 - P_1V_1) = \\frac{C_V}{R}P_1(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $w_{12} = -P_1(V_2 - V_1)$.\n    $q_{12} = \\Delta U_{12} - w_{12} = \\frac{C_V}{R}P_1(V_2-V_1) - (-P_1(V_2-V_1)) = \\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right)P_1(V_2-V_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $2 \\to 3$:\n    $\\Delta U_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_2V_2 - P_1V_2) = \\frac{C_V}{R}V_2(P_2-P_1)$.\n    $w_{23} = 0$.\n    $q_{23} = \\Delta U_{23} - w_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R}V_2(P_2-P_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $3 \\to 4$:\n    $\\Delta U_{34} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_2V_1 - P_2V_2) = -\\frac{C_V}{R}P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $w_{34} = P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $q_{34} = \\Delta U_{34} - w_{34} = -\\frac{C_V}{R}P_2(V_2-V_1) - P_2(V_2-V_1) = -\\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right)P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $4 \\to 1$:\n    $\\Delta U_{41} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_1V_1 - P_2V_1) = -\\frac{C_V}{R}V_1(P_2-P_1)$.\n    $w_{41} = 0$.\n    $q_{41} = \\Delta U_{41} - w_{41} = -\\frac{C_V}{R}V_1(P_2-P_1)$.\n\nThe derived expressions for $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$, $q_{12}$, $q_{23}$, $q_{34}$, and $q_{41}$ are expressed purely in terms of the specified variables. For a cycle, the net change in internal energy must be zero, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, which implies $q_{\\mathrm{net}} = -w_{\\mathrm{net}}$. Summing the derived heat transfers confirms this: $q_{12}+q_{23}+q_{34}+q_{41} = -(P_2-P_1)(V_2-V_1) = -w_{\\mathrm{net}}$. The results are internally consistent and derived strictly from the given principles.\n\nThe final requested quantities are thus:\n1.  $w_{\\mathrm{net}} = (P_2 - P_1)(V_2 - V_1)$\n2.  $q_{12} = \\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_1 (V_2 - V_1)$\n3.  $q_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R} V_2 (P_2 - P_1)$\n4.  $q_{34} = -\\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_2 (V_2 - V_1)$\n5.  $q_{41} = -\\frac{C_V}{R} V_1 (P_2 - P_1)$\nThese results are now formatted for the final answer.",

Nevertheless, the calculation will be performed assuming the input values are exact, with the final rounding executed as per the explicit instruction.\n\nThe solution is a two-part process. First, the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, is determined from the calorimetric data. Second, the Clapeyron equation is used to compute the slope of the solid-liquid coexistence curve, $\\mathrm{d}P/\\mathrm{d}T$.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Molar Enthalpy of Fusion ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$)**\n\nThe heat flow, $\\Phi(T)$, is the rate of heat supplied to the sample, $\\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}t$. The total heat absorbed during the melting transition, $\\Delta Q$, is the time integral of this heat flow.\n$$ \\Delta Q = \\int_{\\text{transition}} \\Phi(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t $$\nThe experiment is conducted at a constant heating rate, $\\beta = \\mathrm{d}T/\\mathrm{d}t$. We can therefore change the variable of integration from time $t$ to temperature $T$ using $\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}T/\\beta$. The total heat absorbed is then the integral of the given heat-flow profile with respect to temperature, divided by the heating rate.\n$$ \\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Phi(T) \\, \\mathrm{d}T $$\nThe integration is taken over the entire temperature range to capture the full area of the peak. Substituting the given Gaussian profile for $\\Phi(T)$:\n$$ \\Delta Q = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Phi_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(T - T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\mathrm{d}T $$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2} \\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. In our case, the integration variable is $(T-T_m)$ and the constant $a$ is $1/(2\\sigma^2)$. The value of the integral is $\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$.\nThus, the total heat absorbed by the sample is:\n$$ \\Delta Q = \\frac{\\Phi_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{\\beta} $$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units. The heat flow $\\Phi_0$ is in $\\mathrm{mW}$ ($\\mathrm{mJ\\;s^{-1}}$), and the heating rate $\\beta$ is in $\\mathrm{K\\;min^{-1}}$. We convert to SI base units or consistent derived units (Joules, Kelvin, seconds).\n$\\Phi_0 = 40.0\\ \\mathrm{mW} = 40.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\;s^{-1}}$\n$\\beta = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{K\\;min^{-1}} = \\frac{5.00}{60}\\ \\mathrm{K\\;s^{-1}}$\n$\\sigma = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta Q = \\frac{(40.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\;s^{-1}})(1.00\\ \\mathrm{K})\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{\\frac{5.00}{60}\\ \\mathrm{K\\;s^{-1}}} = \\frac{40.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 60}{5.00} \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J} = 0.480\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J} $$\nThis heat, $\\Delta Q$, is the enthalpy of fusion for the sample mass $m = 15.00\\ \\mathrm{mg}$. To find the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, we divide by the number of moles, $n$, in the sample.\nThe number of moles is $n = \\frac{m}{M}$:\n$$ n = \\frac{15.00\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{150.00\\ \\mathrm{g\\;mol^{-1}}} = \\frac{15.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}}{150.00\\ \\mathrm{g\\;mol^{-1}}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol} $$\nThe molar enthalpy of fusion is then:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{n} = \\frac{0.480\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{1.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}} = 4800\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J\\;mol^{-1}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Coexistence Line Slope ($\\mathrm{d}P/\\mathrm{d}T$)**\n\nThe slope of the solid-liquid coexistence line in a pressure-temperature diagram is given by the Clapeyron equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is the molar entropy of fusion and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is the molar volume change upon fusion. At the equilibrium melting temperature $T_m$, the Gibbs free energy change for fusion is zero, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} - T_m \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}} = 0$. This gives the relation $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} / T_m$. Substituting this into the Clapeyron equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{T_m \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}} $$\nThe molar volume change, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, is the difference between the molar volume of the liquid ($V_{m,\\ell}$) and the solid ($V_{m,s}$):\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}} = V_{m,\\ell} - V_{m,s} = \\frac{M}{\\rho_{\\ell}} - \\frac{M}{\\rho_{s}} = M \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\ell}} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_{s}}\\right) $$\nWe are given $\\rho_s = 1.200\\ \\mathrm{g\\;cm^{-3}}$ and $\\rho_\\ell = 1.150\\ \\mathrm{g\\;cm^{-3}}$. Using $M = 150.00\\ \\mathrm{g\\;mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}} = 150.00\\ \\mathrm{g\\;mol^{-1}} \\left(\\frac{1}{1.150\\ \\mathrm{g\\;cm^{-3}}} - \\frac{1}{1.200\\ \\mathrm{g\\;cm^{-3}}}\\right) $$\nTo maintain precision, we work with fractions: $1.150 = \\frac{23}{20}$ and $1.200 = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}} = 150.00 \\left(\\frac{20}{23} - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) \\mathrm{cm^3\\;mol^{-1}} = 150.00 \\left(\\frac{120 - 115}{138}\\right) \\mathrm{cm^3\\;mol^{-1}} = 150.00 \\left(\\frac{5}{138}\\right) \\mathrm{cm^3\\;mol^{-1}} = \\frac{125}{23}\\ \\mathrm{cm^3\\;mol^{-1}} $$\nFor use in the Clapeyron equation with $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ in $\\mathrm{J\\;mol^{-1}}$, we must convert $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ to SI units ($\\mathrm{m^3\\;mol^{-1}}$). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{cm^3} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\frac{125}{23} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\;mol^{-1}} $$\nNow, we substitute all quantities into the Clapeyron equation. We have $T_m = 340.00\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} = 4800\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J\\;mol^{-1}}$, and our expression for $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{fus}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{4800\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{J\\;mol^{-1}}}{(340.00\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{125}{23} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\;mol^{-1}}\\right)} $$\nThe resulting unit is $\\mathrm{J\\;K^{-1}\\;m^{-3}}$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{Pa\\;K^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{4800 \\times 23 \\times \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{340.00 \\times 125} \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\;K^{-1}} = \\frac{110400}{42500} \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\;K^{-1}} = \\frac{1104}{425} \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{MPa\\;K^{-1}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} \\approx (2.597647...) \\times (2.506628...) \\ \\mathrm{MPa\\;K^{-1}} \\approx 6.511335\\ \\mathrm{MPa\\;K^{-1}} $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, as instructed by the problem statement:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}T} \\approx 6.511\\ \\mathrm{MPa\\;K^{-1}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.",
