            "problem": "Consider a simplified model for the thermal dissociation of a diatomic gas, $X_2$, within a high-temperature chamber. The process is described by the chemical reaction $X_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2X$. The gas mixture is at thermal equilibrium at a high temperature $T$.\n\nLet the mass of a single atom of species $X$ be $m$. The diatomic molecule $X_2$ thus has a mass of $2m$. The energy required to break a stationary $X_2$ molecule into two separate, stationary $X$ atoms is the dissociation energy, denoted by $\\epsilon_D > 0$. For the purpose of this problem, you are to establish the zero of the energy scale such that two separate, stationary $X$ atoms have a total energy of zero.\n\nTo make the problem tractable, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  The atoms ($X$) and molecules ($X_2$) can be treated as non-interacting point particles, forming an ideal gas mixture.\n2.  All internal degrees of freedom of the diatomic molecule (i.e., vibrational and rotational modes) can be neglected.\n\nUsing the formalism of statistical mechanics, derive an expression for the equilibrium constant $K_c(T)$ for this reaction. The equilibrium constant is defined in terms of number concentrations (particles per unit volume) as $K_c = \\frac{[X]^2}{[X_2]}$.

            "problem": "A closed, isothermal, isobaric reacting mixture contains $S$ chemically distinct species composed of $E$ chemical elements. Let $\\boldsymbol{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S}$ denote the vector of species mole numbers. Define the elemental composition matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E \\times S}$ by $(A)_{ij} = a_{ij}$, where $a_{ij}$ is the number of atoms of element $i$ in one mole of species $j$. Assume no nuclear transmutation and that the system is closed to matter, so the total number of atoms of each element is conserved. Let a reaction be any vector $\\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S}$ of stoichiometric coefficients, interpreted with the convention that negative entries correspond to reactants and positive entries correspond to products.\n\nStarting from the statement of elemental conservation and the linear structure of composition changes due to reactions, derive an expression for the number $R$ of algebraically independent reactions among the $S$ species in terms of $S$ and algebraic properties of $A$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical stoichiometry and conservation of mass, and it is well-posed, using the precise language of linear algebra. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the principle of conservation of elements in a closed chemical system. Let $\\boldsymbol{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S}$ be the column vector of mole numbers for the $S$ species, where $n_j$ is the number of moles of species $j$. Let $\\boldsymbol{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E}$ be the column vector of the total number of moles of each of the $E$ elements. The elemental composition matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E \\times S}$ links these quantities. The entry $A_{ij} = a_{ij}$ represents the number of atoms of element $i$ in a molecule of species $j$.\n\nThe total number of moles of element $i$ in the system is given by the sum over all species:\n$$ b_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{S} a_{ij} n_j $$\nIn matrix form, this system of $E$ linear equations is written as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{b} = A \\boldsymbol{n} $$\nFor a closed system, the total amount of each element is constant, meaning the vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is constant over time. Therefore, any change in the mole number vector, denoted by $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{n}$, must satisfy the constraint:\n$$ A (\\boldsymbol{n} + \\Delta \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\boldsymbol{b} $$\nSubtracting the initial state $A \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{b}$, we arrive at the fundamental conservation constraint on any change in composition:\n$$ A (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis equation signifies that any valid change in the species mole numbers must lie in the null space (or kernel) of the elemental composition matrix $A$.\n\nA chemical reaction provides a specific mechanism for such changes. A single reaction is described by a stoichiometric vector $\\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S}$, where $\\nu_j$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $j$. By convention, $\\nu_j < 0$ for reactants and $\\nu_j > 0$ for products. If this reaction proceeds by an extent $\\xi$ (in moles), the change in the mole number of each species is $\\Delta n_j = \\nu_j \\xi$. In vector form:\n$$ \\Delta \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\xi $$\nSubstituting this into the conservation constraint gives:\n$$ A (\\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\xi) = (A \\boldsymbol{\\nu}) \\xi = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nSince this equation must hold for any non-zero extent of reaction $\\xi \\neq 0$, it implies that any valid stoichiometric vector $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ must satisfy:\n$$ A \\boldsymbol{\\nu} = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis is the central result: the set of all possible stoichiometric vectors for balanced chemical reactions in the system is precisely the null space of the matrix $A$, denoted $\\text{Null}(A)$. The set $\\text{Null}(A)$ is a vector subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{S}$. The number of algebraically independent reactions, $R$, is therefore equal to the dimension of this subspace.\n$$ R = \\dim(\\text{Null}(A)) $$\nFrom the rank-nullity theorem of linear algebra, for any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E \\times S}$, the dimension of its domain ($S$) is the sum of its rank and its nullity (the dimension of its null space):\n$$ \\text{rank}(A) + \\dim(\\text{Null}(A)) = S $$\nSubstituting $R$ for $\\dim(\\text{Null}(A))$, we obtain the desired expression for the number of independent reactions:\n$$ R = S - \\text{rank}(A) $$\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specified example.\nThe set of species is $\\{\\,\\mathrm{CO},\\,\\mathrm{CO_2},\\,\\mathrm{H_2},\\,\\mathrm{H_2O},\\,\\mathrm{CH_4},\\,\\mathrm{O_2}\\,\\}$, so the number of species is $S=6$.\nThe elements are Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O), so the number of elements is $E=3$.\n\nThe elemental composition matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 6}$ is constructed by listing the number of atoms of C, H, and O for each species in the columns. The order of columns corresponds to the order of species listed.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcccccc}\n& \\mathrm{CO} & \\mathrm{CO_2} & \\mathrm{H_2} & \\mathrm{H_2O} & \\mathrm{CH_4} & \\mathrm{O_2} \\\\\n\\mathrm{C} & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{H} & 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{O} & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThus, the matrix $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the number of independent reactions $R$, we first must determine the rank of $A$. The rank is the dimension of the column space, which is the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows). The maximum possible rank is $\\min(E, S) = \\min(3, 6) = 3$. We can test for linear independence by examining a $3 \\times 3$ submatrix. Let's consider the submatrix formed by the first, second, and third columns:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is:\n$$ \\det(M) = 1(0 \\cdot 0 - 2 \\cdot 2) - 1(0 \\cdot 0 - 2 \\cdot 1) + 0 = -4 + 2 = -2 $$\nSince $\\det(M) \\neq 0$, the first three columns of $A$ are linearly independent. This implies that the dimension of the column space is at least $3$. Since the maximum possible rank is $3$, we conclude that:\n$$ \\text{rank}(A) = 3 $$\nNow we can compute the number of independent reactions, $R$:\n$$ R = S - \\text{rank}(A) = 6 - 3 = 3 $$\nThere are $3$ algebraically independent reactions in this system.\n\nTo substantiate this result, we must exhibit a set of $3$ linearly independent reaction vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ that span the null space of $A$. A basis for the null space can be found systematically by finding the reduced row echelon form of $A$.\nThe system $A\\boldsymbol{\\nu} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\\\ \\nu_3 \\\\ \\nu_4 \\\\ \\nu_5 \\\\ \\nu_6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reduced row echelon form of $A$ is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe pivot variables are $\\nu_1, \\nu_2, \\nu_3$, and the free variables are $\\nu_4, \\nu_5, \\nu_6$. We can express the pivot variables in terms of the free variables:\n$$ \\nu_1 = \\nu_4 - 2\\nu_5 + 2\\nu_6 $$\n$$ \\nu_2 = -\\nu_4 + \\nu_5 - 2\\nu_6 $$\n$$ \\nu_3 = -\\nu_4 - 2\\nu_5 $$\nA basis for the null space is found by setting one free variable to $1$ and the others to $0$.\n1.  Set $\\nu_4=1, \\nu_5=0, \\nu_6=0$: $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}^{(1)} = (1, -1, -1, 1, 0, 0)^T$.\n    This corresponds to the reaction: $-\\mathrm{CO_2} - \\mathrm{H_2} + \\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{H_2O} = 0$, or $\\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{H_2} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{H_2O}$.

Set $\\nu_4=0, \\nu_5=1, \\nu_6=0$: $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}^{(2)} = (-2, 1, -2, 0, 1, 0)^T$.\n    This corresponds to the reaction: $\\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{CH_4} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{H_2}$. This is the dry reforming of methane.\n\n3.
