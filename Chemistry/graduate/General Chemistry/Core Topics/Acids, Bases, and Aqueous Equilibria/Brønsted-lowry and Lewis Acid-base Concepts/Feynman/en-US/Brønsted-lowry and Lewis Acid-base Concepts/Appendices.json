This exercise  challenges you to apply both the Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions to a diverse set of common molecules and ions.

            "problem": "A set of $6$ molecular and ionic species $\\left(\\mathrm{NH_3},\\, \\mathrm{H_2SO_4},\\, \\mathrm{BF_3},\\, \\mathrm{H_2O},\\, \\mathrm{CO},\\, \\mathrm{Cl^-}\\right)$ is to be classified according to both the Brønsted–Lowry and Lewis acid–base concepts. Using only core definitions as the fundamental base—namely, that Brønsted–Lowry acids donate $\\mathrm{H^+}$ and Brønsted–Lowry bases accept $\\mathrm{H^+}$, and that Lewis acids accept an electron pair while Lewis bases donate an electron pair—select the option that correctly assigns to each species its acid–base role(s). In reasoning, consider valence electron counts, lone pairs, formal charge, bond polarity, and the presence or absence of energetically accessible vacant orbitals. Assume no redox chemistry and typical molecular environments (no extreme superacidic or high-energy conditions).\n\nChoose the single best classification set:\n\nA. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry base and Lewis base; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: amphoteric (Brønsted–Lowry acid and base) and a Lewis base; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Brønsted–Lowry base and Lewis base.\n\nB. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Lewis acid at sulfur; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: Lewis base only (not amphoteric); $\\mathrm{CO}$: neither; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: amphoteric.\n\nC. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Brønsted–Lowry base only (not a Lewis base).\n\nD. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry base; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: Brønsted–Lowry base only; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Lewis acid due to negative charge.\n\nSelect the option that is fully correct for all six species and is most consistent with structural and electronic reasoning grounded in the stated definitions.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the classification of a set of $6$ chemical species—$\\mathrm{NH_3}$, $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$, $\\mathrm{BF_3}$, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$—according to the Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis acid-base theories. The analysis must be grounded in the fundamental definitions provided.\n\n**Problem Statement Validation**\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nGivens:\n1.  Species: $\\left(\\mathrm{NH_3},\\, \\mathrm{H_2SO_4},\\, \\mathrm{BF_3},\\, \\mathrm{H_2O},\\, \\mathrm{CO},\\, \\mathrm{Cl^-}\\right)$.\n2.  Definitions:\n    - Brønsted-Lowry acid: donates a proton ($\\mathrm{H^+}$).\n    - Brønsted-Lowry base: accepts a proton ($\\mathrm{H^+}$).\n    - Lewis acid: accepts an electron pair.\n    - Lewis base: donates an electron pair.\n3.  Assumptions: Analysis based on electronic structure, typical molecular environments, no redox chemistry.\n\nValidation Verdict: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is based on universally accepted definitions in chemistry and asks for a rigorous application of these principles to a standard set of molecules and ions. The assumptions are clear and appropriate for a general chemistry context. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**Derivation of Correct Classifications**\n\nWe analyze each species based on its structure and adherence to the given definitions.\n\n1.  **Ammonia ($\\mathrm{NH_3}$)**: The nitrogen atom has $5$ valence electrons. It forms three single covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms and possesses one lone pair of electrons.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom can accept a proton ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) to form the ammonium ion, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is a Brønsted-Lowry base. While it can be forced to donate a proton in the presence of an extremely strong base (e.g., an alkyl lithium), its predominant character in typical environments is basic.\n    - **Lewis**: The lone pair on the nitrogen atom can be donated to an electron-pair acceptor (a Lewis acid), such as in the formation of an adduct with $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ ($\\mathrm{H_3N-BF_3}$). Therefore, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is a Lewis base.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is a Brønsted-Lowry base and a Lewis base.\n\n2.  **Sulfuric Acid ($\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$)**: The molecule contains two highly acidic protons attached to oxygen atoms. The central sulfur atom is in a high oxidation state ($+6$) and is bonded to four electronegative oxygen atoms.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: It readily donates one or both of its protons in aqueous solution, making it a strong Brønsted-Lowry acid. For example, $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_3O^+} + \\mathrm{HSO_4^-}$.\n    - **Lewis**: The species that acts as the Lewis acid is the proton ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) that is donated. The molecule $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ itself is not typically classified as a Lewis acid in this context, as its primary and defining role is that of a proton donor.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ is fundamentally classified as a Brønsted-Lowry acid.\n\n3.  **Boron Trifluoride ($\\mathrm{BF_3}$)**: The central boron atom has $3$ valence electrons and forms three single bonds with fluorine atoms. It has an incomplete valence shell with only $6$ electrons and a vacant $p$-orbital.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: It contains no protons and cannot donate an $\\mathrm{H^+}$, so it is not a Brønsted-Lowry acid. It has no site for proton acceptance, so it is not a Brønsted-Lowry base.\n    - **Lewis**: The vacant $p$-orbital on the boron atom makes it a potent electron-pair acceptor. For example, it reacts with ammonia: $\\mathrm{BF_3} + \\mathrm{:NH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{F_3B-NH_3}$. It is a classic example of a Lewis acid.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is a Lewis acid.\n\n4.  **Water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$)**: The oxygen atom has two single bonds to hydrogen and two lone pairs of electrons.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: Water can donate a proton to become $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ (acting as an acid) or accept a proton using one of its lone pairs to become $\\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ (acting as a base). Since it can act as both an acid and a base, it is classified as **amphoteric** under the Brønsted-Lowry definition.\n    - **Lewis**: The two lone pairs on the oxygen atom can be donated to a Lewis acid (e.g., a metal cation like $\\mathrm{Al^{3+}}$). Therefore, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is a Lewis base.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is amphoteric (Brønsted-Lowry) and a Lewis base.\n\n5.  **Carbon Monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$)**: In the most significant resonance structure, there is a triple bond between carbon and oxygen, with a lone pair on each atom. The formal charge on carbon is $-1$ and on oxygen is $+1$.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: It has no protons to donate or accept. It is neither a Brønsted-Lowry acid nor a base.\n    - **Lewis**: The lone pair on the carbon atom is in a higher-energy, more accessible orbital than the lone pair on the more electronegative oxygen. $\\mathrm{CO}$ donates this pair to form coordinate bonds with transition metals (e.g., in $\\mathrm{Ni(CO)_4}$), acting as a ligand. It is therefore a Lewis base. Its ability to accept back-donation into its $\\pi^*$ orbitals ($\\pi$-acidity) is a secondary characteristic; its primary role in adduct formation is as an electron-pair donor.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{CO}$ is a Lewis base.\n\n6.  **Chloride Ion ($\\mathrm{Cl^-}$)**: An ion with a complete valence shell ($8$ electrons) and a net negative charge.\n    - **Brønsted-Lowry**: It is the conjugate base of a strong acid, $\\mathrm{HCl}$. It can accept a proton to form $\\mathrm{HCl}$. Although it is a very weak base, it fits the definition of a Brønsted-Lowry base. It cannot donate a proton.\n    - **Lewis**: Having a full octet of electrons and a negative charge, it is an excellent electron-pair donor. It readily forms complexes with Lewis acids, for example, $\\mathrm{AlCl_3} + \\mathrm{Cl^-} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AlCl_4^-}$. It is a Lewis base.\n    - **Conclusion**: $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is a Brønsted-Lowry base and a Lewis base.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n-   **A. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry base and Lewis base; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: amphoteric (Brønsted–Lowry acid and base) and a Lewis base; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Brønsted–Lowry base and Lewis base.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with the analysis derived above for all six species. Each classification is correct and comprehensive.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Lewis acid at sulfur; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: Lewis base only (not amphoteric); $\\mathrm{CO}$: neither; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: amphoteric.**\n    This option contains numerous errors. $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is not a Brønsted-Lowry acid. $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is famously amphoteric. $\\mathrm{CO}$ is a Lewis base. $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is not amphoteric as it cannot donate $\\mathrm{H^+}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: Brønsted–Lowry acid; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Brønsted–Lowry base only (not a Lewis base).**\n    This option contains numerous errors. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is a Lewis base, not an acid. $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is a Lewis acid, not a base. $\\mathrm{CO}$ is primarily a Lewis base. $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is a Lewis base.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. $\\mathrm{NH_3}$: Brønsted–Lowry base; $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$: amphoteric; $\\mathrm{BF_3}$: Lewis acid; $\\mathrm{H_2O}$: Brønsted–Lowry base only; $\\mathrm{CO}$: Lewis base; $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$: Lewis acid due to negative charge.**\n    This option contains numerous errors. $\\mathrm{H_2SO_4}$ is not considered amphoteric in typical conditions. $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is not only a base but also an acid (amphoteric). $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is a Lewis base, not an acid; its negative charge facilitates electron donation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only set of classifications that is entirely consistent with the fundamental principles of Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis acid-base theories is presented in option A.",

In the gas phase, for a neutral donor $\\mathrm{L}$, $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ is generally a stronger Lewis acid than $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ because $2p(\\mathrm{F}) \\rightarrow 2p(\\mathrm{B})$ $\\pi$ donation in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is more effective than $3p(\\mathrm{Cl}) \\rightarrow 2p(\\mathrm{B})$ in $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$, decreasing the electron deficiency at boron more strongly in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$.\n\nB.

A thermodynamic cycle that decomposes solution-phase binding into gas-phase binding plus solvation terms shows that differential stabilization of $\\mathrm{[BX_4]^-}$ relative to $\\mathrm{L\\!\\rightarrow\\!BX_3}$ and the availability of $\\mathrm{X^-}$ in the medium can mask or reverse gas-phase trends.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the Lewis acidity of boron trihalides, specifically $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ and $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$. To validate and subsequently solve this problem, one must begin from fundamental principles of chemical bonding and thermodynamics.\n\nThe Lewis acidity of a $\\mathrm{BX_3}$ molecule is determined by the electron deficiency of the central boron atom, which possesses a formally vacant $2p$ orbital. Two primary electronic effects influence this deficiency: the inductive effect and the $\\pi$-bonding effect.\n\n1.  **Inductive Effect ($\\sigma$-withdrawal)**: Due to the difference in electronegativity between boron and the halogen atom ($X$), electron density is withdrawn from boron along the $\\sigma$-bonds. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine ($\\chi(\\mathrm{F}) \\approx 3.98$, $\\chi(\\mathrm{Cl}) \\approx 3.16$). Based on this effect alone, the boron atom in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ should be more electron-deficient, and thus a stronger Lewis acid, than in $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$. This would predict an acidity order of $\\mathrm{BF_3} > \\mathrm{BCl_3}$.\n\n2.  **$\\pi$-Donation ($\\pi$-backbonding)**: The trigonal planar $\\mathrm{BX_3}$ molecule has $D_{3h}$ symmetry. The boron atom is $sp^2$-hybridized, leaving a vacant $2p_z$ orbital perpendicular to the molecular plane. Each halogen atom has filled valence $p$ orbitals that can overlap with this empty boron $p$ orbital, donating electron density back to the boron. This is a $p\\pi-p\\pi$ interaction. The efficacy of this back-donation, which counteracts the inductive effect and reduces Lewis acidity, depends on the orbital overlap.\n    -   In $\\mathrm{BF_3}$, the interaction is between the boron's $2p$ orbital and fluorine's $2p$ orbitals. The participating orbitals are well-matched in size and energy, leading to strong overlap and significant $\\pi$-backbonding.\n    -   In $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$, the interaction is between boron's $2p$ orbital and chlorine's $3p$ orbitals. The larger size and different energy of the chlorine $3p$ orbital result in poorer overlap with the boron $2p$ orbital. Consequently, $\\pi$-backbonding is substantially weaker in $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ than in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$.\n\nExperimental data for gas-phase reactions with neutral Lewis bases ($L$), such as $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, show that the enthalpy of adduct formation, $\\Delta H^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ for $\\mathrm{BX_3} + L \\rightarrow L\\!\\rightarrow\\!\\mathrm{BX_3}$, is more negative for $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ than for $\\mathrm{BF_3}$. This indicates that $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ is the stronger Lewis acid in this context. This established fact demonstrates that the $\\pi$-backbonding effect is dominant over the inductive effect in determining the gas-phase Lewis acidity trend for neutral donors.\n\nIn solution, the situation is complicated by solvation effects and the possibility of other equilibria. The overall Gibbs free energy of adduct formation in solution, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{soln}}$, is related to the gas-phase free energy, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, via a thermodynamic cycle:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{soln}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{gas}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Adduct}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{BX_3}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{L})\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}$ represents the free energy of solvation. The differential solvation of the reactants versus the product adduct, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Adduct}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{BX_3}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{L})$, can significantly alter the observed acidity. Furthermore, the nature of the Lewis base is critical. Anionic bases, such as halides $\\mathrm{X^-}$, lead to different products ($[\\mathrm{BX_4}]^-$) whose stabilities are governed by factors including bond energies and solvation of ions.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on these principles.\n\n**Option A:** In the gas phase, for a neutral donor $\\mathrm{L}$, $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ is generally a stronger Lewis acid than $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ because $2p(\\mathrm{F}) \\rightarrow 2p(\\mathrm{B})$ $\\pi$ donation in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is more effective than $3p(\\mathrm{Cl}) \\rightarrow 2p(\\mathrm{B})$ in $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$, decreasing the electron deficiency at boron more strongly in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$.\nThis statement correctly asserts that $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ is a stronger Lewis acid than $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ in the gas phase toward neutral donors. It also provides the correct scientific rationale: the superior $2p-2p$ orbital overlap in $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ leads to more effective $\\pi$-backbonding, which reduces the electrophilicity of the boron center more than the weaker $2p-3p$ interaction in $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$. This effect dominates over the opposing inductive effect. The statement is entirely consistent with experimental observations and accepted molecular orbital theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B:** The inductive electron-withdrawing effect of $\\mathrm{F}$ dominates over any $\\pi$ effects, so $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is necessarily a stronger Lewis acid than $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ in both the gas phase and in solution, independent of the donor and solvent.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The premise that the inductive effect dominates is contrary to the experimental gas-phase acidity order ($\\mathrm{BCl_3} > \\mathrm{BF_3}$) towards neutral donors. As explained above, the $\\pi$ effect is the decisive factor in this case. The additional claim that the trend is universally independent of donor and solvent is an oversimplification that ignores the complexities of solution chemistry and base-specific interactions (e.g., HSAB principles).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:** In polar, strongly solvating media that contain available $\\mathrm{F^-}$, the equilibrium $\\mathrm{BF_3 + F^- \\rightleftharpoons [BF_4]^-}$ is driven far to the right; benchmarks based on halide abstraction or equilibria that generate $\\mathrm{[BF_4]^-}$ can therefore make $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ appear more Lewis acidic than $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$, despite $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ being weaker toward neutral donors in the gas phase.\nThis statement correctly describes a scenario where the apparent Lewis acidity order can be inverted. The formation of the tetrafluoroborate anion, $[\\mathrm{BF_4}]^-$, is an extremely favorable process, driven by the high B-F bond energy and the strong solvation of the small, charge-dense $[\\mathrm{BF_4}]^-$ ion in polar solvents. If Lewis acidity is benchmarked by a reaction involving halide anions, such as halide abstraction from an organic substrate, the immense stability of $[\\mathrm{BF_4}]^-$ makes $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ an exceedingly potent reagent. This can lead to the conclusion that $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is a stronger Lewis acid in this specific chemical context, which contrasts with its behavior toward neutral donors in the gas phase. The reasoning is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D:** Solvation typically stabilizes the free trihalides $\\mathrm{BX_3}$ more than their adducts with donors or halide, so solution-phase effects preserve and even amplify the gas-phase order for any donor; consequently, the order $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ stronger than $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ must hold in all solvents and with all bases.\nThis statement's premise is flawed. Adducts such as $\\mathrm{L\\!\\rightarrow\\!BX_3}$ are typically more polar than the nonpolar, planar $\\mathrm{BX_3}$ molecules. Ionic adducts like $[\\mathrm{BX_4}]^-$ are charged species. In polar solvents, polar and ionic species experience much stronger stabilizing solvation via dipole-dipole or ion-dipole interactions compared to nonpolar solutes. Therefore, the solvation energy term for the adducts, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Adduct})$, is significantly more negative than for the free trihalides. The premise that $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{BX_3})$ is more stabilizing is incorrect. Because of this false premise, the conclusion that the gas-phase order is always preserved is invalid. The statement also makes an unjustifiably absolute claim that the order \"must hold in all solvents and with all bases,\" which is contradicted by the logic presented in the analysis of option C.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E:** A thermodynamic cycle that decomposes solution-phase binding into gas-phase binding plus solvation terms shows that differential stabilization of $\\mathrm{[BX_4]^-}$ relative to $\\mathrm{L\\!\\rightarrow\\!BX_3}$ and the availability of $\\mathrm{X^-}$ in the medium can mask or reverse gas-phase trends. This is consistent with Hard and Soft Acids and Bases: $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a harder acid) is relatively strengthened in interactions with hard bases (e.g., $\\mathrm{F^-}$, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$) compared to $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$, whereas $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ (softer) is relatively stronger toward softer donors.\nThis statement correctly synthesizes several key concepts. First, it correctly states that the thermodynamic cycle for solvation explains how solution-phase trends can deviate from gas-phase trends due to differential solvation and competing equilibria (e.g., formation of $[\\mathrm{BX_4}]^-$ vs. $\\mathrm{L\\!\\rightarrow\\!BX_3}$). Second, it correctly applies the Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) principle as a qualitative tool to rationalize these deviations. $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is a hard acid and interacts preferentially with hard bases like $\\mathrm{F^-}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$. $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ is comparatively softer and interacts more favorably with softer bases. This principle helps explain why the relative acidities of $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ and $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$ are not constant but depend on the nature of the Lewis base, which is a key reason for the reversal of acidity trends observed under different conditions. The statement is coherent and scientifically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
