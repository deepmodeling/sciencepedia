This practice challenges you to move beyond simple rules and explain a classic chemical phenomenon: the stark difference between the first and second dissociations of sulfuric acid.

            "problem": "In liquid water at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and near infinite dilution, sulfuric acid undergoes two sequential Brønsted–Lowry acid dissociation steps. Empirically, the first deprotonation is observed to be effectively complete in water, whereas the second has an equilibrium constant near $10^{-2}$ at the same conditions. Starting from the definitions of Brønsted–Lowry acidity, standard reaction Gibbs free energy, and physically grounded continuum pictures of ion solvation and electrostatic interactions, which option best rationalizes why the first dissociation is strong while the second is much weaker? Your choice should explicitly and consistently invoke charge density, solvation, and electrostatic repulsion in the underlying species.\n\nA. The first step is strong because the conjugate base is resonance-stabilized and water has a high dielectric constant; the second should be even stronger because the sulfate dianion has larger charge magnitude and therefore experiences stronger solvation, which always dominates over all other effects in water.\n\nB. The first step is strong because water strongly stabilizes the hydronium ion and because the bisulfate anion delocalizes a single negative charge over $4$ oxygens, lowering the energy of the products relative to the neutral acid. The second is weaker because deprotonating an already negatively charged species requires work against electrostatic attraction, and because forming the compact, highly charge-dense sulfate dianion introduces substantial intramolecular charge–charge repulsion; although solvation of the dianion is stronger on average, dielectric saturation and the additional ordering of the solvent around a $z=-2$ ion limit the incremental stabilization, so the overall free-energy change is much less favorable.\n\nC. Both steps are intrinsically equally strong at infinite dilution; the observed difference arises solely from activity-coefficient effects at finite ionic strength, which suppress the apparent value of the second dissociation constant.\n\nD. The second step is weaker because the sulfate dianion lacks resonance stabilization, whereas the bisulfate anion is resonance-stabilized; consequently, the second conjugate base is destabilized irrespective of solvation or electrostatics.",

Definition of Brønsted–Lowry acidity.\n    2.  Standard reaction Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G^\\circ$).\n    3.  Physically grounded continuum pictures of ion solvation and electrostatic interactions.\n- **Required Concepts to Invoke**: The explanation must explicitly and consistently use the concepts of charge density, solvation, and electrostatic repulsion.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes the well-established chemical behavior of sulfuric acid in aqueous solution.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The statement is scientifically sound. It is a fundamental fact in general chemistry that sulfuric acid is a strong acid in its first dissociation ($\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4(aq) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^+(aq) + \\mathrm{HSO}_4^-(aq)$) and a weak acid in its second dissociation ($\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+(aq) + \\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)$). The given value for the second acid dissociation constant, $K_{a2} \\approx 10^{-2}$ (more precisely, $1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ at $298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$), is correct. The physical chemistry concepts listed (Gibbs free energy, solvation, electrostatics) are the correct tools for explaining this phenomenon. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factual error.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a qualitative rationalization of an observed phenomenon based on a specified set of physical principles, and a unique, conceptually sound explanation exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically correct, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the detailed derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe strength of an acid is quantified by its acid dissociation constant, $K_a$. A larger $K_a$ signifies a stronger acid. The standard Gibbs free energy of the dissociation reaction, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is related to $K_a$ by the equation $\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K_a$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. A strong acid has $K_a \\gg 1$, corresponding to a large negative $\\Delta G^\\circ$, indicating a spontaneous reaction. A weak acid has $K_a < 1$, corresponding to a positive $\\Delta G^\\circ$, indicating a non-spontaneous reaction under standard conditions.\n\nLet us analyze the two dissociation steps of sulfuric acid.\n\n**Step 1: First Dissociation**\n$$ \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4(aq) + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+(aq) + \\mathrm{HSO}_4^-(aq) $$\nThe problem states this step is \"effectively complete,\" which means $K_{a1} \\gg 1$ and thus $\\Delta G^\\circ_1 \\ll 0$. We must explain why this free energy change is so favorable. The overall $\\Delta G^\\circ_1$ can be understood as the sum of free energies of several processes: breaking the O-H bond in $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$, forming the H-O bond in $\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+$, and solvating the product ions.\n1.  **Reactant State**: The reactant is a neutral molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$.\n2.  **Product State**: The products are the hydronium ion, $\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+$, and the bisulfate anion, $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$.\n3.  **Energetic Contributions**:\n    - The solvation of the small proton to form $\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+$ (and its subsequent hydration) is extremely favorable, releasing a large amount of energy. This is a primary driving force for nearly all acid dissociations in water.\n    - The conjugate base, $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$, is an anion where the $-1$ charge is delocalized via resonance over the three terminal oxygen atoms and the central sulfur atom. This charge delocalization stabilizes the ion, lowering its energy. The charge density on any one atom is relatively low.\n    - The solvation of this monoanion, $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$, also contributes favorably to the overall $\\Delta G^\\circ_1$.\n\nThe combination of these stabilizing factors for the products makes the first dissociation highly exergonic.\n\n**Step 2: Second Dissociation**\n$$ \\mathrm{HSO}_4^-(aq) + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+(aq) + \\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) $$\nThe problem states $K_{a2} \\approx 10^{-2}$, which means $\\Delta G^\\circ_2 > 0$. We must explain why $\\Delta G^\\circ_2$ is significantly less favorable (more positive) than $\\Delta G^\\circ_1$.\n1.  **Reactant State**: The reactant is now an anion, $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$.\n2.  **Product State**: The products are $\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+$ and the sulfate dianion, $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$.\n3.  **Energetic Contributions**:\n    - **Electrostatic Work**: To remove a positive proton ($\\mathrm{H}^+$) from an already negatively charged species ($\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$) requires overcoming a significant electrostatic attraction. This amounts to doing work against an attractive Coulombic force, which is an energetically unfavorable (endothermic/endergonic) contribution that was absent in the first step (deprotonation of a neutral molecule).\n    - **Intramolecular Repulsion**: The product, $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$, is a dianion. It concentrates a charge of $-2$ into a small molecular volume. This results in significant electrostatic repulsion between the negative charges localized on the oxygen atoms. This intramolecular repulsion destabilizes the $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$ ion relative to the $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$ monoanion. The charge density is much higher than in bisulfate.\n    - **Solvation**: The free energy of solvation is a strong function of ionic charge, roughly scaling as $z^2$ according to the Born model. Therefore, the solvation of the $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$ dianion ($z=-2$) is indeed much stronger (more negative $\\Delta G_{solv}$) than for the $\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$ monoanion ($z=-1$). However, this simple picture is incomplete. The intense electric field around the high-charge-density $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$ ion causes strong ordering of the surrounding water molecules (electrostriction), which carries a significant entropic penalty (unfavorable $T\\Delta S$ term). Furthermore, this intense field can lead to *dielectric saturation*, where the effective dielectric constant of the solvent in the immediate vicinity of the ion is much lower than its bulk value of $\\approx 80$. This effect reduces the magnitude of the stabilization provided by the solvent.\n\nIn summary, for the second dissociation, the unfavorable work required to remove a proton from an anion and the substantial intramolecular repulsion in the resulting high-charge-density dianion collectively outweigh the increased stabilization from the dianion's solvation. The net result is a positive $\\Delta G^\\circ_2$, making the second dissociation a non-spontaneous process.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The first step is strong because the conjugate base is resonance-stabilized and water has a high dielectric constant; the second should be even stronger because the sulfate dianion has larger charge magnitude and therefore experiences stronger solvation, which always dominates over all other effects in water.**\nThe initial part of this statement is plausible. However, the conclusion that the second step \"should be even stronger\" is in direct contradiction with the empirical facts provided in the problem statement ($K_{a2} \\ll K_{a1}$). The claim that solvation \"always dominates\" is an oversimplification that is demonstrably false in this case; it completely neglects the critical and unfavorable electrostatic work and intramolecular repulsion terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The first step is strong because water strongly stabilizes the hydronium ion and because the bisulfate anion delocalizes a single negative charge over $4$ oxygens, lowering the energy of the products relative to the neutral acid. The second is weaker because deprotonating an already negatively charged species requires work against electrostatic attraction, and because forming the compact, highly charge-dense sulfate dianion introduces substantial intramolecular charge–charge repulsion; although solvation of the dianion is stronger on average, dielectric saturation and the additional ordering of the solvent around a $z=-2$ ion limit the incremental stabilization, so the overall free-energy change is much less favorable.**\nThis option correctly describes the stabilization of products in the first step. It then correctly identifies the two primary reasons for the weakness of the second step: the electrostatic work required for deprotonation of an anion and the intramolecular repulsion within the dianion product. Crucially, it provides a sophisticated and physically accurate description of why the stronger solvation of the dianion does not compensate for these unfavorable effects, by correctly invoking the concepts of dielectric saturation and the entropic cost of solvent ordering around a high-charge-density ion. This explanation is complete, consistent, and uses all the required concepts correctly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Both steps are intrinsically equally strong at infinite dilution; the observed difference arises solely from activity-coefficient effects at finite ionic strength, which suppress the apparent value of the second dissociation constant.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The problem is explicitly set at \"near infinite dilution,\" where activity coefficients $\\gamma \\to 1$ and their effects become negligible. The large difference between $K_{a1}$ and $K_{a2}$ is an intrinsic property reflecting the molecular and electronic structures of the species involved, not an artifact of non-ideal solution behavior at finite concentrations. The standard state, to which $K_a$ values refer, is a hypothetical ideal solution at $1\\ \\mathrm{M}$ concentration, which is derived from measurements extrapolated to infinite dilution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The second step is weaker because the sulfate dianion lacks resonance stabilization, whereas the bisulfate anion is resonance-stabilized; consequently, the second conjugate base is destabilized irrespective of solvation or electrostatics.**\nThis statement's premise is false. Both the bisulfate ($\\mathrm{HSO}_4^-$) and sulfate ($\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$) ions exhibit resonance stabilization. Due to its perfect $T_d$ symmetry, the charge in the sulfate dianion is delocalized equally over four equivalent oxygen atoms, arguably representing a more effective resonance than in the less symmetric bisulfate anion. The claim that sulfate \"lacks resonance stabilization\" is chemically wrong. Furthermore, the concluding assertion that the effect is \"irrespective of solvation or electrostatics\" contradicts the explicit instructions of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
