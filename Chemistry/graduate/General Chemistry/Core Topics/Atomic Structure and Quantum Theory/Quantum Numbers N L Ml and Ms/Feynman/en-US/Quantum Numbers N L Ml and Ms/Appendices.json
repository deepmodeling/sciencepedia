It is a standard problem in introductory quantum mechanics, based on the established rules governing the quantum numbers for atomic orbitals in a central potential.\n- The problem is **well-posed**. It provides all necessary rules and a specific value for the principal quantum number $n$, leading to a unique, definite integer solution.\n- The problem is **objective**. The definitions and tasks are stated with precision and without any ambiguity or subjective language.\n- The problem is self-contained and consistent; it is not speculative, trivial, or fallacious.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the total number of distinct spin-orbitals for the principal quantum shell specified by $n=5$. A unique quantum state for an electron in a one-electron atom, a spin-orbital, is defined by a unique set of four quantum numbers: $\\{n, l, m_{l}, m_{s}\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of distinct spatial orbitals, which are defined by the unique sets of $\\{n, l, m_{l}\\}$. The rules provided state the allowed values for these quantum numbers.\n\nFor a principal quantum number $n=5$, the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ can take on integer values from $0$ up to $n-1$.\nThus, for $n=5$, the allowed values for $l$ are:\n$l \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nFor each value of $l$, the magnetic quantum number $m_{l}$ can take on integer values from $-l$ to $+l$. The number of possible $m_{l}$ values for a given $l$ is therefore $2l+1$. We enumerate these possibilities for each allowed value of $l$:\n- For $l=0$ (an s-subshell): $m_{l}$ can only be $0$. The number of orbitals is $2(0)+1 = 1$.\n- For $l=1$ (a p-subshell): $m_{l}$ can be $-1, 0, +1$. The number of orbitals is $2(1)+1 = 3$.\n- For $l=2$ (a d-subshell): $m_{l}$ can be $-2, -1, 0, +1, +2$. The number of orbitals is $2(2)+1 = 5$.\n- For $l=3$ (an f-subshell): $m_{l}$ can be $-3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3$. The number of orbitals is $2(3)+1 = 7$.\n- For $l=4$ (a g-subshell): $m_{l}$ can be $-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4$. The number of orbitals is $2(4)+1 = 9$.\n\nThe total number of distinct spatial eigenfunctions (orbitals) for the $n=5$ shell is the sum of the number of orbitals in each subshell.\n$$N_{\\text{spatial}} = \\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} (2l+1)$$\nFor $n=5$, this sum is:\n$$N_{\\text{spatial}} = (2(0)+1) + (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1) + (2(3)+1) + (2(4)+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25$$\nThis is the sum of an arithmetic progression, which can be confirmed by the well-known formula for the degeneracy of a principal shell in a hydrogenic atom, which is $n^2$. For $n=5$, we have $5^2 = 25$. So, there are $25$ distinct spatial orbitals in the $n=5$ shell.\n\nFinally, we must account for the electron's spin. For each spatial orbital, defined by a specific set of $\\{n, l, m_{l}\\}$, the electron can have one of two possible spin states, given by the spin magnetic quantum number $m_{s} = +\\frac{1}{2}$ or $m_{s} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. A spin-orbital is a state specified by all four quantum numbers, $\\{n, l, m_{l}, m_{s}\\}$.\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. This implies that each spatial orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, one with spin up ($m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$) and one with spin down ($m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$). Therefore, the total number of distinct spin-orbitals is twice the number of distinct spatial orbitals.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{total}}$ be the total number of spin-orbitals.\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = (\\text{number of spin states}) \\times N_{\\text{spatial}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 25 = 50$$\nIn general, for any principal quantum number $n$, the total number of distinct spin-orbitals is given by $2n^2$. For the case of $n=5$, this is $2 \\times 5^2 = 2 \\times 25 = 50$.\n\nThe enumeration and subsequent summation have confirmed this general result. The total number of distinct spin-orbitals for the shell $n=5$ is $50$.",

            "problem": "An atom has two equivalent electrons occupying the same subshell with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=2$ (a $d$ subshell). Assume the weak spin–orbit coupling limit of Russell–Saunders coupling (LS coupling), so that the total orbital angular momentum $L$ and total spin angular momentum $S$ are good quantum numbers. Use only the following foundational principles: the Pauli exclusion principle, the allowed single-electron magnetic quantum numbers for a fixed $l$ and spin $s$, basic combinatorics for counting distinguishable selections, and angular momentum coupling with exchange symmetry constraints for two equivalent electrons. Do not use pre-tabulated term symbols or any shortcut formulas that directly give the number of microstates.\n\nTasks:\n1) Starting from the allowed one-electron quantum numbers for a $d$ subshell, enumerate the allowed pairs of distinct single-electron $(m_l,m_s)$ values for two electrons that satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.

Report the total number of microstates as your final answer. Provide your final answer as an exact integer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the spectroscopic terms for a $d^2$ electronic configuration and the total number of microstates, using only first principles. The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed. We proceed with a systematic solution.\n\nThe problem concerns two equivalent electrons in a subshell defined by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=2$. For a single electron, the spin quantum number is $s = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the set of possible quantum states for a single electron in this subshell. The magnetic orbital quantum number, $m_l$, can take values from $-l$ to $+l$. Thus, for $l=2$, the allowed values are $m_l \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. The number of spatial orbitals is $2l+1 = 2(2)+1 = 5$. The magnetic spin quantum number, $m_s$, can take values $m_s \\in \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. The number of spin states is $2s+1 = 2(\\frac{1}{2})+1 = 2$.\nA single-electron state, or spin-orbital, is uniquely defined by the pair of quantum numbers $(m_l, m_s)$. The total number of distinct single-electron states in the $d$ subshell is therefore $(2l+1)(2s+1) = 5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n\n**1. Enumeration and Counting of Microstates**\n\nA microstate of the two-electron system is defined by the set of quantum numbers of the two electrons, $\\{ (m_{l1}, m_{s1}), (m_{l2}, m_{s2}) \\}$. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, for two equivalent electrons (having the same principal quantum number $n$ and orbital quantum number $l$), the pair of quantum numbers $(m_l, m_s)$ must be distinct for each electron. That is, $(m_{l1}, m_{s1}) \\neq (m_{l2}, m_{s2})$.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to selecting two distinct single-electron states from the $10$ available spin-orbitals. Since electrons are indistinguishable, the order of selection does not matter. The total number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$, where $N=10$ is the total number of spin-orbitals and $k=2$ is the number of electrons.\nThe total number of microstates is:\n$$ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45 $$\nThis completes the first part of the task, determining the total number of distinct microstates. The problem also asks for an enumeration. A full enumeration of all $45$ pairs is tedious. Instead, we categorize the microstates by their total magnetic quantum numbers, $M_L = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ and $M_S = m_{s1} + m_{s2}$. This enumeration is performed in the next step as it is the foundation for determining the spectroscopic terms.\n\n**2. Derivation of Spectroscopic Terms**\n\nWe construct a table of microstates organized by the values of $M_L$ and $M_S$. The possible values for $M_S$ are $m_{s1} + m_{s2} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The possible values for $M_L$ range from $m_{l, \\text{min}_1} + m_{l, \\text{min}_2} = (-2)+(-1)=-3$ (for parallel spins) or $(-2)+(-2)=-4$ (for antiparallel spins) up to $m_{l, \\text{max}_1} + m_{l, \\text{max}_2} = 2+2=4$.\n\nCase $M_S = 1$: Both electrons have $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$. By the Pauli principle, their $m_l$ values must be different. We must choose two distinct $m_l$ values from the set $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. The number of ways is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$. The pairs of $m_l$ values and the corresponding $M_L = m_{l1}+m_{l2}$ are:\n- $(2, 1) \\implies M_L=3$\n- $(2, 0) \\implies M_L=2$\n- $(2, -1) \\implies M_L=1$\n- $(2, -2) \\implies M_L=0$\n- $(1, 0) \\implies M_L=1$\n- $(1, -1) \\implies M_L=0$\n- $(1, -2) \\implies M_L=-1$\n- $(0, -1) \\implies M_L=-1$\n- $(0, -2) \\implies M_L=-2$\n- $(-1, -2) \\implies M_L=-3$\nThe number of microstates for each $M_L$ value when $M_S=1$ is: $N(M_L=3)=1$, $N(M_L=2)=1$, $N(M_L=1)=2$, $N(M_L=0)=2$, $N(M_L=-1)=2$, $N(M_L=-2)=1$, $N(M_L=-3)=1$. The sum is $10$.\n\nCase $M_S = -1$: Both electrons have $m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}$. The logic is identical to the $M_S=1$ case. There are $10$ such microstates, with the same distribution of $M_L$ values.\n\nCase $M_S = 0$: One electron has $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$ and the other has $m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Since their spin quantum numbers are different, there is no restriction on their $m_l$ values; $m_{l1}$ can be equal to $m_{l2}$. We choose one orbital for the spin-up electron (from $5$ choices) and one for the spin-down electron (from $5$ choices). The total number of microstates is $5 \\times 5 = 25$. We count the number of microstates for each value of $M_L = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, where $m_{l1}, m_{l2} \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$:\n- $M_L = 4$: $(2,2)$ - $1$ state.\n- $M_L = 3$: $(2,1), (1,2)$ - $2$ states.\n- $M_L = 2$: $(2,0), (0,2), (1,1)$ - $3$ states.\n- $M_L = 1$: $(2,-1), (-1,2), (1,0), (0,1)$ - $4$ states.\n- $M_L = 0$: $(2,-2), (-2,2), (1,-1), (-1,1), (0,0)$ - $5$ states.\nBy symmetry, $N(M_L, 0) = N(-M_L, 0)$. Summing these gives $1+2+3+4+5+4+3+2+1 = 25$ states.\n\nWe summarize these counts in a table of $N(M_L, M_S)$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nM_L  M_S=-1  M_S=0  M_S=1 \\\\\n\\hline\n4  0  1  0 \\\\\n3  1  2  1 \\\\\n2  1  3  1 \\\\\n1  2  4  2 \\\\\n0  2  5  2 \\\\\n-1  2  4  2 \\\\\n-2  1  3  1 \\\\\n-3  1  2  1 \\\\\n-4  0  1  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total}  10  25  10\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe grand total is $10+25+10 = 45$, confirming our initial calculation. Now, we identify the spectroscopic terms ($^{2S+1}L$).\n\n1.  The highest value of $M_L$ is $4$. This must correspond to a term with total orbital angular momentum $L=4$. The microstate with $(M_L, M_S) = (4,0)$ is present, but those with $(M_L, M_S)=(4, \\pm 1)$ are not. This implies that the $L=4$ term has total spin $S=0$. This is a $^1G$ term (since $L=4$ corresponds to the letter $G$). A $^1G$ term comprises $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(4)+1)(2(0)+1) = 9$ microstates, with $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-4, -3, \\dots, +4\\}$. We subtract these $9$ states from our table (one from each relevant cell in the $M_S=0$ column).\n\n2.  After removing the $^1G$ states, the highest remaining $M_L$ is $3$. The table for $(M_L=3, M_S=\\{-1,0,1\\})$ shows counts of $(1,1,1)$. This rectangular pattern indicates a term with $L=3$ and $S=1$. This is a $^3F$ term ($L=3 \\implies F, S=1 \\implies 2S+1=3$). It has a degeneracy of $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(3)+1)(2(1)+1) = 7 \\times 3 = 21$ microstates. We subtract these $21$ states (one from each cell in the rectangle defined by $M_L \\in [-3,3]$ and $M_S \\in [-1,1]$).\n\n3.  After removing the $^3F$ states, the highest remaining $M_L$ is $2$. The only remaining microstate at this $M_L$ value has $M_S=0$. This implies a term with $L=2$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1D$ term ($L=2 \\implies D, S=0 \\implies 2S+1=1$). It has a degeneracy of $(2(2)+1)(2(0)+1) = 5$ microstates, with $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-2, \\dots, +2\\}$. We subtract these $5$ states.\n\n4.  After removing the $^1D$ states, the highest remaining $M_L$ is $1$. The remaining counts for $(M_L=1, M_S=\\{-1,0,1\\})$ are $(1,1,1)$. This indicates a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$, which is a $^3P$ term ($L=1 \\implies P, S=1 \\implies 2S+1=3$). It has a degeneracy of $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$ microstates. We subtract these $9$ states.\n\n5.  Finally, after removing the $^3P$ states, a single microstate remains at $(M_L=0, M_S=0)$. This corresponds to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1S$ term. Its degeneracy is $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1)=1$.\n\nIn summary, the allowed terms for the $d^2$ configuration, derived from coupling principles and exchange symmetry, are $^1G$, $^3F$, $^1D$, $^3P$, and $^1S$. The allowed values of $(S, L)$ and their spectroscopic letters are:\n- $(S=0, L=4) \\implies ^1G$\n- $(S=1, L=3) \\implies ^3F$\n- $(S=0, L=2) \\implies ^1D$\n- $(S=1, L=1) \\implies ^3P$\n- $(S=0, L=0) \\implies ^1S$\n\n**3. Verification of Total Microstates**\n\nWe must verify that the sum of the degeneracies of all identified terms equals the total number of microstates calculated in Task 1. The degeneracy of a term $^{2S+1}L$ is $(2S+1)(2L+1)$.\n- Degeneracy of $^1G$: $(2(0)+1)(2(4)+1) = 1 \\times 9 = 9$.\n- Degeneracy of $^3F$: $(2(1)+1)(2(3)+1) = 3 \\times 7 = 21$.\n- Degeneracy of $^1D$: $(2(0)+1)(2(2)+1) = 1 \\times 5 = 5$.\n- Degeneracy of $^3P$: $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n- Degeneracy of $^1S$: $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of these degeneracies is $9 + 21 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 45$.\nThis sum matches the total number of microstates, $45$, determined from combinatorial principles. The analysis is thus self-consistent and correct. The problem asks for the total number of microstates as the final answer.",
