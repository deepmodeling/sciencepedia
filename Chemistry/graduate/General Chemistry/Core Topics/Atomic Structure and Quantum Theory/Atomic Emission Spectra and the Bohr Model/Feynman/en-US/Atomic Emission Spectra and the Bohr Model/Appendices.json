            "problem": "A singly ionized helium ion, $\\mathrm{He}^{+}$, is a hydrogen-like one-electron system with nuclear charge $+Ze$ where $Z=2$. Consider an electronic transition from the first excited state to the ground state, i.e., $n=2 \\to n=1$, which produces a spectral line analogous to the hydrogen Lyman-$\\alpha$ line (the $n=2 \\to n=1$ transition in hydrogen).\n\nStarting only from the following foundational elements:\n- Coulomb’s law for the electron–nucleus attraction and the equality of centripetal and Coulomb forces in uniform circular motion,\n- the Bohr quantization postulate of angular momentum for bound electronic motion,\n- the definitions of total energy as the sum of kinetic and potential energies,\n- Planck’s relation between photon energy and frequency, and the relation between frequency and wavelength via the speed of light,\n\nderive the scaling of the transition energy with nuclear charge $Z$ for hydrogen-like ions and deduce how the emitted wavelength scales for a fixed pair of principal quantum numbers.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in applying the Bohr model to a hydrogen-like atom and is free of any logical or factual inconsistencies. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to derive the scaling of transition energy and wavelength with nuclear charge $Z$ for a hydrogen-like system, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we model the system as a single electron of charge $-e$ and mass $m_e$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a nucleus of charge $+Ze$. The electrostatic Coulomb force provides the necessary centripetal force for this uniform circular motion.\n\nCoulomb's Law gives the attractive force $F_C$:\n$$ F_C = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(Ze)(e)}{r^2} = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the Coulomb constant.\n\nThe centripetal force $F_{cen}$ required to keep the electron in a circular orbit of radius $r$ at speed $v$ is:\n$$ F_{cen} = \\frac{m_e v^2}{r} $$\n\nEquating these two forces, $F_C = F_{cen}$, gives our first fundamental relation:\n$$ k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} = \\frac{m_e v^2}{r} \\implies m_e v^2 = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n\nNext, we apply the Bohr quantization postulate for angular momentum, $L$. The angular momentum of the electron is $L = m_e v r$, and it is quantized in integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$:\n$$ L = m_e v r = n\\hbar, \\quad \\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nFrom this, we can express the speed $v$ as $v = \\frac{n\\hbar}{m_e r}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $v$ into the force balance equation:\n$$ m_e \\left( \\frac{n\\hbar}{m_e r} \\right)^2 = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n$$ m_e \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{m_e^2 r^2} = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n$$ \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{m_e r} = k_e Ze^2 $$\n\nSolving for the radius $r$ gives the quantized orbital radii, $r_n$:\n$$ r_n = \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e Z e^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e e^2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{Z} $$\nWe can identify the Bohr radius, $a_0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e e^2}$, which is the radius of the ground state of hydrogen ($n=1, Z=1$). Thus, $r_n = a_0 \\frac{n^2}{Z}$.\n\nNow, we derive the total energy $E_n$ of the electron in the $n$-th state. The total energy is the sum of its kinetic energy $K_n$ and potential energy $U_n$.\nThe kinetic energy is $K_n = \\frac{1}{2} m_e v^2$. From our force balance equation, we found $m_e v^2 = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r}$, so at a radius $r_n$:\n$$ K_n = \\frac{1}{2} k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r_n} $$\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy of the electron at a distance $r_n$ from the nucleus is:\n$$ U_n = -k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r_n} $$\n\nThe total energy $E_n$ is therefore:\n$$ E_n = K_n + U_n = \\frac{1}{2} k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r_n} - k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r_n} = -\\frac{1}{2} k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r_n} $$\n\nSubstituting our expression for the quantized radius $r_n$:\n$$ E_n = -\\frac{1}{2} k_e Ze^2 \\left( \\frac{k_e m_e Z e^2}{n^2\\hbar^2} \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{k_e^2 m_e e^4}{2\\hbar^2} \\right) \\frac{Z^2}{n^2} $$\n\nLet the constant term be the Rydberg energy, $R_E = \\frac{k_e^2 m_e e^4}{2\\hbar^2}$. Then the quantized energy levels are:\n$$ E_n = -R_E \\frac{Z^2}{n^2} $$\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted during an electronic transition from an initial state $n_i$ to a final state $n_f$ (where $n_i > n_f$) is the difference in energy between these states:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} = \\left(-R_E \\frac{Z^2}{n_i^2}\\right) - \\left(-R_E \\frac{Z^2}{n_f^2}\\right) = R_E Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right) $$\nThis equation explicitly shows that for a fixed transition (i.e., fixed $n_i$ and $n_f$), the transition energy $\\Delta E$ scales with the square of the nuclear charge, $\\Delta E \\propto Z^2$.\n\nAccording to the Planck-Einstein relation, the photon energy is related to its frequency $\\nu$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ by $\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$.\n$$ \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = R_E Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right) $$\nSolving for the wavelength $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{R_E Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} $$\nThis relationship shows that for a fixed transition, the wavelength of the emitted photon is inversely proportional to the square of the nuclear charge, $\\lambda \\propto \\frac{1}{Z^2}$.\n\nWe now apply this scaling law to the specific problem. We are comparing the $n=2 \\to n=1$ transition for hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}$) and singly ionized helium ($\\mathrm{He}^{+}$).\nFor hydrogen, $Z_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1$.\nFor helium, $Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}} = 2$.\nThe transition is the same for both, so the term $\\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)$ is constant.\n\nThe ratio of the wavelengths is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{1/Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}}^2}{1/Z_{\\mathrm{H}}^2} = \\left( \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{H}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThis is the exact fractional ratio required.\n\nWe are given the experimental wavelength for the hydrogen Lyman-$\\alpha$ line, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}} = 121.567\\,\\text{nm}$. We can now compute the corresponding wavelength for $\\mathrm{He}^{+}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{121.567\\,\\text{nm}}{4} = 30.39175\\,\\text{nm} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $5$ significant figures.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}} \\approx 30.392\\,\\text{nm} $$\n\nThe two required outputs are the numerical wavelength for $\\mathrm{He}^{+}$ and the exact ratio of the wavelengths.\n1. Wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}} = 30.392\\,\\text{nm}$.\n2. Ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{He}^{+}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We may therefore proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: (i) to justify the Ritz combination principle for the given three-level system using the Bohr model, and (ii) to calculate the wavenumber of the unobserved transition.\n\nLet the three energy levels involved be denoted by their principal quantum numbers $n$. The upper level is $n_{u} = 5$. The two lower levels are $n_{\\ell,1} = 3$ and $n_{\\ell,2} = 2$.

Its wavenumber is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2} \\right)$$\nThe second transition is from $n_{u} = 5$ to $n_{\\ell} = 3$. Its wavenumber is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2} \\right)$$\nThe unobserved transition is between the two lower levels, from $n=3$ to $n=2$.

Its wavenumber is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{3 \\to 2} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{3^2} \\right)$$\nThe Ritz combination principle states that spectral lines can be related through sums or differences of their wavenumbers. To justify this for our system, we consider the difference between the wavenumbers of the two observed transitions:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2} \\right) - R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2} \\right)$$\nFactoring out $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and simplifying the expression:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{5^2} - \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{5^2} \\right)$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3} = R_{\\mathrm{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{3^2} \\right)$$\nThe right side of this equation is precisely the expression for the wavenumber of the transition from $n=3$ to $n=2$, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{3 \\to 2}$. Therefore, we have demonstrated that:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{3 \\to 2} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 2} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{5 \\to 3}$$\nThis result confirms the Ritz combination principle for this three-level system. The wavenumber of the transition between levels $n=2$ and $n=3$ is equal to the difference between the wavenumbers of the transitions from a common upper level $n=5$ to these two levels.

The calculated value is $15232.9972$. The first six significant digits are $1$, $5$, $2$, $3$, $2$, and $9$. The seventh digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the sixth digit. The sixth digit, $9$, becomes $10$, which carries over.\n$15232.9 + 0.1 = 15233.0$.\nThus, the predicted vacuum wavenumber rounded to six significant figures is $15233.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.

This two-body problem is equivalent to a single particle with the reduced mass $\\mu$ orbiting the center of mass, where:\n$$ \\mu(M) = \\frac{m_e M}{m_e + M} $$\nFor a circular orbit of radius $r$, the Coulomb force provides the necessary centripetal force:\n$$ \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{r^2} = \\mu \\frac{v^2}{r} $$\nBohr's postulate for the quantization of angular momentum $L$ is applied:\n$$ L = \\mu v r = n \\hbar $$\nwhere $n$ is the principal quantum number, $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

From the direct proportionality of energy to reduced mass, we have:\n$$ \\frac{E_n(M)}{E_n^{(\\infty)}} = \\frac{\\mu(M)}{m_e} $$\nThis implies a similar relationship for the Rydberg constants:\n$$ R(M) = R_\\infty \\frac{\\mu(M)}{m_e} = R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{M}{m_e+M} \\right) = R_\\infty \\frac{1}{1 + m_e/M} $$\nThis justifies the functional dependence of $R(M)$ on the reduced mass, as requested.\n\nThe wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$ of a photon emitted during a transition from an initial state $n_i$ to a final state $n_f$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda(M)} = R(M) \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right) $$\nInverting this expression gives the wavelength $\\lambda(M)$:\n$$ \\lambda(M) = \\frac{1}{R(M)} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)^{-1} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $R(M)$:\n$$ \\lambda(M) = \\frac{1}{R_\\infty (1 + m_e/M)^{-1}} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)^{-1} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{m_e}{M} \\right) \\frac{1}{R_\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)^{-1} $$\nWe are asked to find the difference $\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, where for hydrogen $M=m_p$ and for deuterium $M=m_d$.\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda(m_p) - \\lambda(m_d) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\left( 1 + \\frac{m_e}{m_p} \\right) \\frac{1}{R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} - \\left( 1 + \\frac{m_e}{m_d} \\right) \\frac{1}{R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} $$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{1}{R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{m_e}{m_p}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{m_e}{m_d}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{1}{R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} \\left( \\frac{m_e}{m_p} - \\frac{m_e}{m_d} \\right) $$\nThis expression contains the quantum numbers $n_i$ and $n_f$. The problem is specified for the Balmer-$\\alpha$ line, which fixes $n_i=3$ and $n_f=2$. An expression in terms of only the listed constants requires us to incorporate these numbers. Thus, we derive the final analytical expression for the specified transition:\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{m_e}{R_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)} \\left( \\frac{1}{m_p} - \\frac{1}{m_d} \\right) $$\n\nNow, for part 2, we evaluate this expression numerically. The transition is $n_i = 3$ to $n_f = 2$.\nThe factor involving quantum numbers is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9-4}{36} = \\frac{5}{36} $$\nThe expression for $\\Delta \\lambda$ becomes:\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{m_e}{R_\\infty \\left(\\frac{5}{36}\\right)} \\left( \\frac{1}{m_p} - \\frac{1}{m_d} \\right) $$\nWe substitute the given values:\n$R_{\\infty} = 1.097373156816 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n$m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n$m_p = 1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n$m_d = 3.3435837724 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nFirst, calculate the mass-dependent term:\n$$ \\frac{1}{m_p} - \\frac{1}{m_d} = \\frac{1}{1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}} - \\frac{1}{3.3435837724 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}} $$\n$$ = (5.978638334 \\times 10^{26} - 2.990796443 \\times 10^{26}) \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} = 2.987841891 \\times 10^{26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{m_e}{R_\\infty \\left(\\frac{5}{36}\\right)} = \\frac{9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}{(1.097373156816 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times \\frac{5}{36}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}{1.52412938447 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = 5.9768007 \\times 10^{-37} \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} $$\nFinally, multiply the two parts to find $\\Delta \\lambda$:\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = (5.9768007 \\times 10^{-37} \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}) \\times (2.987841891 \\times 10^{26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = 1.78583 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in nanometers, where $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\lambda = (1.78583 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (10^9 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{nm}}{\\mathrm{m}}) = 0.178583 \\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1786 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. This positive value indicates that $\\lambda_H > \\lambda_D$, which is correct as the reduced mass of hydrogen is smaller than that of deuterium, leading to a slightly lower transition energy and thus a longer wavelength.\nMy previous calculation was $0.1783$. Let me re-check with more precision.
