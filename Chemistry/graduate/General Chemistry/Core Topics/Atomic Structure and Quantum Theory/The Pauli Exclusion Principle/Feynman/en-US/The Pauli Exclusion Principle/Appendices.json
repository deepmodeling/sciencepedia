            "introduction": "The Pauli exclusion principle fundamentally distinguishes fermions from bosons, with profound consequences for the macroscopic properties of matter. This first exercise provides a quantitative look at one of the principle's most direct effects: the ground state energy. By comparing a system of non-interacting fermions to an equivalent system of bosons within a simple one-dimensional potential well, you will derive how the \"stacking\" of fermions into progressively higher energy states leads to a dramatically different scaling of the total energy with the number of particles . This calculation illustrates the concept of \"Pauli pressure,\" an effective repulsion that is a direct result of the antisymmetry requirement.",

            "problem": "Consider a system of $N$ identical, non-interacting particles of mass $m$, confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$.

We want to investigate the total ground state energy of this system under different statistical rules for the particles.\n\nFirst, let the particles be spin-0 bosons. In the ground state, all bosons occupy the lowest possible single-particle energy level. Let the total ground state energy for this system be $E_B^{(N)}$.\n\nSecond, let the particles be spin-1/2 fermions. These particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since they are spin-1/2, each spatial energy level $E_n$ can be occupied by at most two fermions (one with spin up, one with spin down). The ground state is formed by filling the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards. For simplicity, assume $N$ is a large even integer. Let the total ground state energy for this fermionic system be $E_F^{(N)}$.\n\nThe total energy for both systems depends on the number of particles $N$. In the limit of a large number of particles, the energy scales differently with $N$ for fermions and bosons. We define two asymptotic scaling coefficients:\n$$ C_B = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{E_B^{(N)}}{N} $$\n$$ C_F = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{E_F^{(N)}}{N^3} $$\nYour task is to calculate the dimensionless ratio $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{C_F}{C_B}$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantum chemistry that is scientifically grounded and requires the application of fundamental principles to derive a verifiable result. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors are present. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to determine the complete set of allowed spectroscopic term symbols for a two-electron configuration in a $d$ subshell, denoted as $d^{2}$, and to enumerate the microstates corresponding to each term. The derivation must originate from first principles as specified: the indistinguishability of electrons, the antisymmetry requirement of the total wavefunction (Pauli exclusion principle), and the rules of angular momentum coupling.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of distinct microstates for the $d^{2}$ configuration. A single electron in a $d$ subshell is characterized by the principal quantum number $n$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=2$. The state of such an electron is further specified by its magnetic orbital quantum number $m_{l}$ and magnetic spin quantum number $m_{s}$. For $l=2$, the possible values of $m_{l}$ are $m_{l} \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. For an electron with spin $s=1/2$, the possible values of $m_{s}$ are $m_{s} \\in \\{+1/2, -1/2\\}$. A unique single-electron state, or spin-orbital, is defined by the pair $(m_{l}, m_{s})$. The total number of available spin-orbitals in the $d$ subshell is the product of the number of orbital states and spin states, which is $(2l+1) \\times (2s+1) = (2(2)+1) \\times (2(1/2)+1) = 5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n\nWe are considering two electrons in this subshell. These electrons are identical fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction for the system must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons. A direct consequence is that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, i.e., they cannot have the same set of four quantum numbers $(n, l, m_{l}, m_{s})$. Since the electrons are in the same subshell, they share the same $n$ and $l$ values. Therefore, they must occupy two distinct spin-orbitals. The problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose $2$ distinct spin-orbitals from the $10$ available. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Total Microstates} = \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n$$\nThere are $45$ allowed antisymmetric microstates for the $d^{2}$ configuration.\n\nNext, we must partition these $45$ microstates into sets corresponding to specific term symbols $^{2S+1}L$. A term symbol is defined by the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ and the total spin angular momentum quantum number $S$. Each term corresponds to a set of $(2L+1)(2S+1)$ microstates, characterized by the total magnetic quantum numbers $M_{L} = \\sum m_{li}$ and $M_{S} = \\sum m_{si}$.\n\nWe construct a table of microstates by enumerating all possible pairs of $(M_{L}, M_{S})$ values and the number of microstates corresponding to each pair.\nThe possible values for $M_{S}$ are $1$ (from $m_{s1}=+1/2, m_{s2}=+1/2$), $0$ (from $m_{s1}=+1/2, m_{s2}=-1/2$), and $-1$ (from $m_{s1}=-1/2, m_{s2}=-1/2$).\nThe possible values for $M_{L}$ range from $l_1+l_2 = 2+2=4$ down to $-4$.\n\nThe number of microstates for a given $(M_L, M_S)$ pair is determined as follows:\n1.  For $M_{S} = \\pm 1$, both electrons must have parallel spins. By the Pauli principle, they must occupy different spatial orbitals, so $m_{l1} \\neq m_{l2}$. The number of microstates for $M_S=1$ with a given $M_L$ is the number of ways to choose two distinct $m_l$ values from $\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$ that sum to $M_L$. By symmetry, the number of states for $M_S=-1$ is identical.\n2.  For $M_{S}=0$, the electrons have antiparallel spins. They can occupy either the same spatial orbital ($m_{l1}=m_{l2}$) or different ones ($m_{l1} \\neq m_{l2}$). The number of microstates for $M_S=0$ with a given $M_L$ is the number of ways to choose one $m_{l1}$ from spin-up orbitals and one $m_{l2}$ from spin-down orbitals such that their sum is $M_L$. This corresponds to the convolution of the set of $m_l$ values with itself.\n\nBy systematically counting, we construct the following table of microstate counts, $N(M_{L}, M_{S})$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nM_L \\backslash M_S & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n 4 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 3 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n 2 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n 1 & 2 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n 0 & 2 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n-2 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n-3 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n-4 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe sum of all entries is $10+25+10=45$, which confirms our total count.\n\nWe now decompose this table into its constituent terms using Slater's method. We identify a term by the maximum values of $M_L$ and $M_S$ present in the table, remove the microstates belonging to that term, and repeat the process on the remaining table until all microstates are accounted for.\n\n1.  The largest value of $M_{L}$ is $4$. The corresponding microstate has $(M_{L}, M_{S}) = (4, 0)$. This must be a component of a term with $L=4$. Since $M_{S}=0$ is the only spin projection for this $M_L$, we must have $S=0$. This identifies the term $^{1}G$. This term has a degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(0)+1)(2(4)+1) = 9$. These $9$ microstates correspond to $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-4, -3, \\dots, 4\\}$. We subtract $1$ from the count for each of these cells in the $M_S=0$ column.\n\n2.  After removing the $^{1}G$ states, the highest remaining $(M_L, M_S)$ entry is at $(3, 1)$. This implies a term with $L=3$ and $S=1$, which is the $^{3}F$ term. It has a degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(1)+1)(2(3)+1) = 3 \\times 7 = 21$. These microstates span $M_L \\in \\{-3, \\dots, 3\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We subtract $1$ from the counts in the rectangular block defined by these ranges.\n\n3.  After removing the $^{3}F$ states, the highest remaining $M_L$ is $2$, with $(M_L, M_S) = (2, 0)$. This implies a term with $L=2$ and $S=0$, which is the $^{1}D$ term. It has a degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (1)(5) = 5$. These are $5$ microstates with $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-2, \\dots, 2\\}$.\n\n4.  After removing the $^{1}D$ states, the highest remaining $(M_L, M_S)$ is at $(1, 1)$. This implies a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$, which is the $^{3}P$ term. It has a degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (3)(3) = 9$. These states span $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n5.  Finally, after removing the $^{3}P$ states, a single microstate remains at $(M_L, M_S)=(0, 0)$. This corresponds to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is the $^{1}S$ term. It has a degeneracy of $(1)(1) = 1$.\n\nThe complete set of allowed terms for the $d^2$ configuration is thus $^{1}G, ^{3}F, ^{1}D, ^{3}P, ^{1}S$. We now provide the microstate count for each term as requested.\n- Total microstates: $45$\n- $^{3}F$: $(2 \\cdot 1+1)(2 \\cdot 3+1) = 3 \\times 7 = 21$\n- $^{1}D$: $(2 \\cdot 0+1)(2 \\cdot 2+1) = 1 \\times 5 = 5$\n- $^{3}P$: $(2 \\cdot 1+1)(2 \\cdot 1+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n- $^{1}G$: $(2 \\cdot 0+1)(2 \\cdot 4+1) = 1 \\times 9 = 9$\n- $^{1}S$: $(2 \\cdot 0+1)(2 \\cdot 0+1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$\n\nThe sum of these counts is $21+5+9+9+1 = 45$, which matches the total number of microstates and validates our decomposition.\nThe final answer requires the counts in a specific order: total, $^{3}F, ^{1}D, ^{3}P, ^{1}G, ^{1}S$.\nThe values are $45$, $21$, $5$, $9$, $9$, $1$.",
