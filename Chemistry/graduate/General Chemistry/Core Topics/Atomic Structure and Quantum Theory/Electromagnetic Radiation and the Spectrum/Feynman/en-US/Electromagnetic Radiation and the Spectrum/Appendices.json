            "problem": "A monochromatic, continuous-wave Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) beam of wavelength $\\lambda$ propagates in vacuum and impinges normally on a macroscopically flat, perfectly absorbing planar chemical sample. The beam has total power $P$ and a uniform, time-steady cross-sectional area $A$ at the sample surface. Assume no reflection, scattering, or transmission, and neglect edge effects so that the irradiance is spatially uniform across $A$.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions and well-tested relations appropriate to electromagnetic radiation in vacuum—namely: the photon energy $E_{\\text{ph}}$, the definition of power as energy per unit time, the momentum of a photon, and the definition of pressure as momentum flux per unit area—derive exact expressions for:\n1) the photon flux $\\Phi$ (the number of photons incident per unit time), and\n2) the radiation pressure $p_{\\text{rad}}$ exerted on the absorber.\n\nExpress both results symbolically in terms of $P$, $\\lambda$, $A$, Planck’s constant $h$, and the speed of light in vacuum $c$ only. If numerical evaluation were to be performed in the International System of Units (SI), $\\Phi$ would be in $\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $p_{\\text{rad}}$ in pascals (Pa); however, for this problem, provide the final result as exact symbolic expressions. Present your final answer as a two-entry row matrix $\\bigl[\\Phi \\;\\; p_{\\text{rad}}\\bigr]$.",
            "solution": "First, we derive the expression for the photon flux, $\\Phi$.\nThe energy of a single photon, $E_{\\text{ph}}$, is given by the Planck-Einstein relation, which connects energy to the frequency $\\nu$ of the electromagnetic radiation:\n$$E_{\\text{ph}} = h\\nu$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. For electromagnetic waves propagating in a vacuum, the frequency $\\nu$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light $c$ by:\n$$c = \\lambda\\nu$$\nSolving for $\\nu$ yields $\\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives the energy of a single photon in terms of its wavelength:\n$$E_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nPower, $P$, is defined as the total energy transferred per unit time. The LASER beam is monochromatic, so all photons possess the same energy, $E_{\\text{ph}}$. The total energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, delivered by $N_{\\text{ph}}$ photons is $E_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{ph}} E_{\\text{ph}}$. The power is then the rate at which this energy is delivered:\n$$P = \\frac{dE_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = \\frac{d(N_{\\text{ph}} E_{\\text{ph}})}{dt}$$\nSince $E_{\\text{ph}}$ is constant for a monochromatic beam, we have:\n$$P = E_{\\text{ph}} \\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$$\nThe problem defines the photon flux, $\\Phi$, as the number of photons incident per unit time, which is precisely the term $\\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$.\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the power equation yields:\n$$P = \\Phi E_{\\text{ph}}$$\nWe can now solve for the photon flux $\\Phi$:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{P}{E_{\\text{ph}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, we obtain the final expression for the photon flux:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{P}{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}} = \\frac{P\\lambda}{hc}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the radiation pressure, $p_{\\text{rad}}$.\nThe momentum of a single photon, $p_{\\text{ph}}$, is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the de Broglie relation:\n$$p_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$$\nAlternatively, using $E_{\\text{ph}} = hc/\\lambda$, we can write the photon momentum in terms of its energy: $p_{\\text{ph}} = E_{\\text{ph}}/c$.\nPressure is defined as force per unit area, $p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{F}{A}$. According to Newton's second law, force is the rate of change of momentum, $F = \\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$. Therefore, pressure is the flux of momentum per unit area:\n$$p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the beam is incident normally on a perfectly absorbing surface. This means that each photon transfers its entire momentum to the surface upon absorption. The momentum transferred by one photon is therefore $\\Delta p_{\\text{per photon}} = p_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$.\nThe total momentum transferred to the surface per unit time, $\\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$, is the product of the number of photons arriving per unit time ($\\Phi$) and the momentum transferred by each photon:\n$$\\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = \\Phi \\times \\Delta p_{\\text{per photon}} = \\Phi \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$$\nThis rate of momentum transfer is the force $F$ exerted on the sample area $A$:\n$$F = \\Phi \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$$\nThe radiation pressure $p_{\\text{rad}}$ is this force distributed over the area $A$:\n$$p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\Phi \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTo express $p_{\\text{rad}}$ in terms of the given variables, we substitute the previously derived expression for $\\Phi = \\frac{P\\lambda}{hc}$:\n$$p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\left(\\frac{P\\lambda}{hc}\\right) \\frac{h}{\\lambda} \\right)$$\nThe terms $h$ and $\\lambda$ cancel, leading to a simplified expression for the radiation pressure:\n$$p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{P}{c} = \\frac{P}{Ac}$$\nThis result is consistent with the classical electromagnetic theory, which identifies pressure for a totally absorbed wave as the irradiance $I = P/A$ divided by the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe final symbolic expressions are:\n1) Photon flux: $\\Phi = \\frac{P\\lambda}{hc}$\n2) Radiation pressure: $p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{P}{Ac}$",
