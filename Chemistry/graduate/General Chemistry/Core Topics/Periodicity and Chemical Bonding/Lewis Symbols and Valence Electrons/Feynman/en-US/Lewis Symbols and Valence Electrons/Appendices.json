This exercise explores the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which quantifies the net attraction a valence electron feels from its nucleus.

            "problem": "Chlorine has atomic number $Z=17$ and ground-state electron configuration $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{5}$. Consider a single valence electron in the $3p$ subshell. Using Slater’s rules as the empirical framework for estimating screening by other electrons, determine the effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ experienced by this $3p$ electron in chlorine. Justify each screening contribution category by explicitly identifying which electrons contribute to it based on their principal quantum number and subshell, and state the final $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ value. Then, briefly explain how the magnitude of this $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ rationalizes the Lewis symbol for chlorine and its typical valence in covalent bonding, starting from the ideas of electron shielding and Coulombic attraction.\n\nReport the final numerical value of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ rounded to three significant figures. No units are required for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed question in general chemistry, grounded in the established principles of atomic structure and the empirical framework of Slater's rules. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is internally consistent. I will now provide the solution.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, experienced by an electron in a polyelectronic atom is the net positive charge from the nucleus that the electron \"feels.\" This charge is less than the full nuclear charge, $Z$, due to the shielding or screening effect of other electrons in the atom. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = Z - S\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is the atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus) and $S$ is the screening constant, which quantifies the extent of shielding from all other electrons.\n\nTo estimate the screening constant $S$, we will employ Slater's rules. The first step is to write the electron configuration of chlorine ($Z=17$) and group the orbitals according to these rules:\n$$\n(1s^{2}) (2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}) (3s^{2}\\,3p^{5})\n$$\nThe electron of interest is a valence electron in the $3p$ subshell. Slater's rules for an electron in an $ns$ or $np$ orbital are as follows:\n1.  Electrons in principal shells higher than the electron of interest do not contribute to screening.\n2.  Each of the *other* electrons in the same $(ns, np)$ group as the electron of interest contributes $S = 0.35$ to the screening constant.\n3.  Each electron in the $(n-1)$ principal shell contributes $S = 0.85$.\n4.  Each electron in inner shells, i.e., $(n-2)$ or lower, contributes $S = 1.00$.\n\nWe now apply these rules to calculate the total screening constant $S$ for one of the $3p$ electrons in chlorine. The electron of interest is in the $n=3$ shell.\n\nFirst, we identify the electrons contributing to each screening category:\n-   **Same group contribution (the $(3s, 3p)$ group):** The electron configuration shows $2$ electrons in the $3s$ subshell and $5$ electrons in the $3p$ subshell, for a total of $2+5=7$ electrons in the $n=3$ shell. Since we are calculating the screening for one of these electrons, the other $7-1=6$ electrons in this group will each contribute to the screening.\n    -   Contribution from the $6$ electrons in the $(3s, 3p)$ group: $6 \\times 0.35$\n\n-   **Contribution from the $(n-1)$ shell (the $n=2$ shell):** This shell contains the $(2s, 2p)$ electrons. The configuration $2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}$ indicates there are $2+6=8$ electrons in this shell. Each of these will contribute.\n    -   Contribution from the $8$ electrons in the $(2s, 2p)$ group: $8 \\times 0.85$\n\n-   **Contribution from the $(n-2)$ and lower shells (the $n=1$ shell):** This shell contains the $(1s)$ electrons. The configuration $1s^{2}$ indicates there are $2$ electrons in this shell.\n    -   Contribution from the $2$ electrons in the $(1s)$ group: $2 \\times 1.00$\n\nNow, we sum these contributions to find the total screening constant, $S$:\n$$\nS = (6 \\times 0.35) + (8 \\times 0.85) + (2 \\times 1.00)\n$$\n$$\nS = 2.10 + 6.80 + 2.00\n$$\n$$\nS = 10.90\n$$\nWith the screening constant calculated, we determine the effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, for the $3p$ electron. The atomic number of chlorine is $Z=17$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = Z - S = 17 - 10.90 = 6.10\n$$\nThe effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence electron in chlorine is $6.10$. This value is already stated to three significant figures.\n\nNow, we relate this result to chlorine's Lewis symbol and its valence. The Lewis symbol for an element depicts its valence electrons. Chlorine is in Group $17$ of the periodic table, and its electron configuration $...3s^{2}\\,3p^{5}$ shows it has $2+5=7$ valence electrons. The Lewis symbol is thus a 'Cl' surrounded by seven dots.\n\nThe calculated $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of $6.10$ is a relatively high value. This indicates that the seven valence electrons of a chlorine atom are held quite strongly by the nucleus, as the screening by the $10$ core electrons is incomplete. The strong Coulombic attraction between the nucleus ($Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = +6.10$) and the valence electrons results in a high electron affinity. Chlorine has a strong tendency to acquire one more electron to complete its valence shell, achieving the stable electron configuration of the noble gas argon ($...3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}$). This drive to gain a single electron to form a stable octet explains why chlorine's most common valence in covalent bonding is $1$. For instance, in hydrogen chloride ($\\mathrm{HCl}$), chlorine forms one single covalent bond with hydrogen and has three lone pairs, satisfying the octet rule. The Lewis symbol visually represents the seven valence electrons that are under the influence of this strong effective nuclear charge, and its typical chemical behavior (forming one bond) is a direct consequence of the resulting energetics favoring the completion of this shell.",

Each atom is depicted with sufficient lone pairs to satisfy the octet rule, and the overall species carries a net charge of $-1$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard exercise in general chemistry concerning the application of Lewis structure theory and the concept of formal charge. The problem provides all necessary information to deduce a unique and verifiable answer. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the formal charge on each atom in a specific resonance contributor of the nitrate ion, $\\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}$. The formal charge, a conceptual tool for electron bookkeeping, is defined for an atom in a molecule by the following relation:\n\n$$q_{formal} = V - N - \\frac{B}{2}$$\n\nHere, $V$ represents the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state, $N$ is the number of non-bonding valence electrons on the atom in the Lewis structure, and $B$ is the total number of electrons shared in covalent bonds with the atom.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons, $V$, for the constituent atoms based on their position in the periodic table.\n- Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}$) is in Group $15$, thus $V_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5$.\n- Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$) is in Group $16$, thus $V_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6$.\n\nThe problem describes a specific resonance structure. We must construct this structure by adhering to the given bonding pattern and the octet rule for second-period elements, which dictates that each atom must be associated with $8$ valence electrons.\n\nThe structure is described as:\n1. A central nitrogen atom, $\\mathrm{N}$.\n2. A double bond between $\\mathrm{N}$ and one oxygen atom, labeled $\\mathrm{O_a}$.\n3. Single bonds between $\\mathrm{N}$ and two other oxygen atoms, labeled $\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$.\n\nNow, we add lone pair electrons to each atom to satisfy the octet rule.\n- For the central nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{N}$): It participates in one double bond ($4$ electrons) and two single bonds ($2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons). The total number of bonding electrons associated with $\\mathrm{N}$ is $4 + 4 = 8$. The octet for nitrogen is satisfied by its bonding electrons alone. Therefore, the number of non-bonding electrons on $\\mathrm{N}$ is $N_{\\mathrm{N}} = 0$.\n- For the doubly-bonded oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O_a}$): It is involved in a double bond, accounting for $4$ electrons. To complete its octet of $8$ electrons, it requires $8 - 4 = 4$ additional electrons. These must be non-bonding electrons, corresponding to $2$ lone pairs. So, $N_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 4$.\n- For the singly-bonded oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$): Each is involved in a single bond, accounting for $2$ electrons. To complete its octet, each requires $8 - 2 = 6$ additional electrons. These must be non-bonding electrons, corresponding to $3$ lone pairs. Thus, for both $\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$, the number of non-bonding electrons is $N_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = N_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = 6$.\n\nWith the Lewis structure fully defined, we can now calculate the formal charge for each atom.\n\n- Formal charge on Nitrogen ($q_{\\mathrm{N}}$):\n  The atom has $V_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5$ valence electrons. It has $N_{\\mathrm{N}} = 0$ non-bonding electrons and $B_{\\mathrm{N}} = 8$ bonding electrons.\n  $$q_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5 - 0 - \\frac{8}{2} = 5 - 4 = +1$$\n\n- Formal charge on the doubly-bonded Oxygen ($q_{\\mathrm{O_a}}$):\n  The atom has $V_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6$ valence electrons. It has $N_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 4$ non-bonding electrons and $B_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 4$ bonding electrons.\n  $$q_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{4}{2} = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$$\n\n- Formal charge on the singly-bonded Oxygens ($q_{\\mathrm{O_b}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{O_c}}$):\n  These atoms are equivalent. Each has $V_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6$ valence electrons. Each has $N_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = N_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = 6$ non-bonding electrons and $B_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = B_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = 2$ bonding electrons.\n  $$q_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = q_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{2}{2} = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$$\n\nThe resulting formal charges are $q_{\\mathrm{N}} = +1$, $q_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 0$, $q_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = -1$, and $q_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = -1$.\n\nAs a final check, the sum of the formal charges must equal the overall charge of the ion, which is given as $-1$.\n$$\\sum q_{formal} = q_{\\mathrm{N}} + q_{\\mathrm{O_a}} + q_{\\mathrm{O_b}} + q_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = (+1) + (0) + (-1) + (-1) = -1$$\nThe sum correctly matches the net charge of the nitrate ion, confirming the consistency of our calculation.\n\nThe ordered quadruple of formal charges $(q_{\\mathrm{N}}, q_{\\mathrm{O_a}}, q_{\\mathrm{O_b}}, q_{\\mathrm{O_c}})$ is therefore $(+1, 0, -1, -1)$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general chemistry, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution without contradiction. We will now proceed with a solution from first principles.\n\nThe central task is to analyze the electronic structure of the carboxylate anion, $\\mathrm{RCO_2^-}$, using the formalism of Lewis structures and resonance theory. The problem correctly restricts the analysis to the two major, equivalent resonance contributors.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons for the atoms of interest. Carbon ($\\mathrm{C}$) is in group $14$ of the periodic table and therefore possesses $4$ valence electrons. Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$) is in group $16$ and possesses $6$ valence electrons.\n\nThe formal charge ($FC$) on an atom in a Lewis structure is a bookkeeping tool defined as the difference between the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom ($V$) and the number of electrons assigned to it in the Lewis structure. The assigned electrons are the sum of all non-bonding (lone pair) electrons ($N$) and half of the bonding (shared) electrons ($B$).\n$$FC = V - N - \\frac{1}{2}B$$\n\nWe are instructed to construct two canonical Lewis structures. Let us label the atoms as $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{O}(1)$, and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$.\n\n**Canonical Structure I:**\nIn the first structure, we place the double bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ and the single bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. The carbon atom is also bonded to a generic group $\\mathrm{R}$. To satisfy the octet rule for carbon, it must form four covalent bonds and have no lone pairs.\n-   The carbon atom, $\\mathrm{C}$, has one single bond to $\\mathrm{R}$, one double bond to $\\mathrm{O}(1)$, and one single bond to $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. It shares a total of $8$ electrons.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ is part of a double bond. To satisfy its octet, it must have $4$ non-bonding electrons, which corresponds to $2$ lone pairs.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ is part of a single bond. To satisfy its octet, it must have $6$ non-bonding electrons, which corresponds to $3$ lone pairs.\n\nNow, we compute the formal charge for each atom in this structure:\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 4 - 4 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$\nThe sum of formal charges is $0 + 0 + (-1) = -1$, which matches the overall charge of the ion.\n\n**Canonical Structure II:**\nThe second structure is generated by delocalizing the $\\pi$ electrons. We place the double bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ and the single bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(1)$.\n-   The carbon atom, $\\mathrm{C}$, has the same bonding pattern: four bonds, zero lone pairs.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ is now single-bonded to $\\mathrm{C}$ and must have $6$ non-bonding electrons ($3$ lone pairs) to satisfy its octet.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ is now double-bonded to $\\mathrm{C}$ and must have $4$ non-bonding electrons ($2$ lone pairs) to satisfy its octet.\n\nWe compute the formal charges for Structure II:\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 4 - 4 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$\nAgain, the sum of formal charges is $0 + (-1) + 0 = -1$, consistent with the ion's charge.\n\n**Symmetry and Resonance Weights:**\nThe two canonical structures, I and II, are chemically indistinguishable. They are identical in terms of bonding patterns and formal charge distribution, differing only in the arbitrary labels of the oxygen atoms. One structure can be mapped onto the other by a reflection through the plane bisecting the $\\mathrm{O-C-O}$ angle. Because they are energetically degenerate, they must contribute equally to the true electronic structure of the ion, which is a resonance hybrid of these two forms. Therefore, the weight of each structure, $w$, is identical: $w_I = w_{II} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Resonance-Averaged Formal Charges:**\nThe formal charge on each atom in the resonance hybrid, $q^{\\mathrm{hybrid}}$, is the weighted average of its formal charges across the contributing canonical structures.\n-   For carbon: $q_{\\mathrm{C}} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{C}, I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{C}, II} = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n-   For oxygen $\\mathrm{O}(1)$: $q_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1), I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1), II} = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   For oxygen $\\mathrm{O}(2)$: $q_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2), I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2), II} = \\frac{1}{2}(-1) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis result shows that in the resonance hybrid, the two oxygen atoms are identical, and each bears precisely half of the negative charge. The carbon atom remains formally neutral.\n\n**Experimental Observables:**\nThis resonance picture is not merely a theoretical construct; it has direct, verifiable experimental consequences. We compare the carboxylate anion, $\\mathrm{RCO_2^-}$, with its conjugate acid, the carboxylic acid $\\mathrm{RCO_2H}$, which does not exhibit significant resonance stabilization. In $\\mathrm{RCO_2H}$, there is a localized $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond and a localized $\\mathrm{C-OH}$ single bond.\n\n1.  **Bond Lengths:** In the carboxylic acid, the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond is significantly shorter (approximately $1.20$ Å) than the $\\mathrm{C-OH}$ single bond (approximately $1.36$ Å). In the carboxylate anion, the resonance hybrid model predicts that both carbon-oxygen bonds are equivalent, with a bond order of $1.5$ (the average of a single and a double bond). Experimentally, techniques like X-ray crystallography confirm this prediction: both $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bonds in a carboxylate salt are found to be identical in length, with a value (approximately $1.25$ Å) that is intermediate between a typical $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond and a $\\mathrm{C-O}$ single bond.\n\n2.  **Vibrational Frequencies:** Infrared (IR) spectroscopy measures the vibrational frequencies of chemical bonds. Stronger bonds vibrate at higher frequencies. In the carboxylic acid, the IR spectrum shows a distinct, strong absorption band for the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond stretch, typically around $1700-1725 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Upon deprotonation to form the carboxylate anion, this characteristic band disappears. It is replaced by two new bands corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the equivalent $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bonds. The asymmetric stretch appears at a lower frequency (e.g., $1550-1610 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$), and the symmetric stretch at an even lower frequency (e.g., $1300-1420 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$). This shift to lower frequencies demonstrates that the bonds in the anion are weaker than a pure $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond, which is consistent with the resonance hybrid model of bond order $1.5$.",
