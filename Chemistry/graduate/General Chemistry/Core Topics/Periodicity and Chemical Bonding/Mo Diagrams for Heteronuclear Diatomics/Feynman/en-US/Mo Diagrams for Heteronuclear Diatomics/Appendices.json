            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in introductory quantum chemistry that is scientifically grounded in the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals–Molecular Orbital (LCAO–MO) theory. It provides a complete and consistent set of parameters necessary for a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nWe begin with the LCAO approximation for the molecular orbital (MO) $\\Psi$, which is formed from the valence atomic orbitals (AOs) $\\phi_{A}$ and $\\phi_{B}$ of atoms $A$ and $B$, respectively:\n$$\n\\Psi = c_{A}\\phi_{A} + c_{B}\\phi_{B}\n$$\nHere, $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$ are the coefficients representing the contribution of each AO to the MO. The application of the variational principle leads to the secular equations, which in matrix form are:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} H_{AA} - ES_{AA} & H_{AB} - ES_{AB} \\\\ H_{BA} - ES_{BA} & H_{BB} - ES_{BB} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A} \\\\ c_{B} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the Hamiltonian matrix elements: $H_{AA} = \\alpha_{A}$ and $H_{BB} = \\alpha_{B}$, which are the Coulomb integrals representing the energy of an electron in the isolated AOs, and $H_{AB} = H_{BA} = \\beta$, the resonance integral representing the interaction energy between the AOs. The AOs are normalized, so $S_{AA} = S_{BB} = 1$. The overlap between the two AOs is explicitly stated to be zero, $S \\equiv S_{AB} = S_{BA} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the matrix equation gives:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_{A} - E & \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha_{B} - E \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A} \\\\ c_{B} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution (where $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$ are not both zero), the determinant of the matrix of coefficients must be zero. This is the secular determinant:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_{A} - E & \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha_{B} - E \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant yields a quadratic equation in energy $E$:\n$$\n(\\alpha_{A} - E)(\\alpha_{B} - E) - \\beta^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nE^{2} - (\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B})E + \\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} - \\beta^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis equation is solved for $E$ using the quadratic formula, $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-(\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B})$, and $c=\\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} - \\beta^{2}$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{(\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}))^{2} - 4(1)(\\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} - \\beta^{2})}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE = \\frac{(\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}) \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha_{A}^{2} + 2\\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} + \\alpha_{B}^{2} - 4\\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} + 4\\beta^{2}}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE = \\frac{(\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}) \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha_{A}^{2} - 2\\alpha_{A}\\alpha_{B} + \\alpha_{B}^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe two energy eigenvalues correspond to the bonding and antibonding MOs. The bonding MO energy, $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}$, is the lower energy (minus sign), and the antibonding MO energy, $E_{\\mathrm{antibond}}$, is the higher energy (plus sign).\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{bond}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{antibond}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate these energies using the provided numerical values: $\\alpha_{A}=-12\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $\\alpha_{B}=-15\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, and $\\beta=-2\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe average energy is $\\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B}}{2} = \\frac{-12 + (-15)}{2} = \\frac{-27}{2} = -13.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe term under the square root is $(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2} = (-12 - (-15))^{2} + 4(-2)^{2} = (3)^{2} + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{2}$.\nThe square root is $\\sqrt{25\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{2}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe energy eigenvalues are:\n$E = -13.5 \\pm \\frac{5}{2} = -13.5 \\pm 2.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nTherefore:\n$E_{\\mathrm{bond}} = -13.5 - 2.5 = -16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n$E_{\\mathrm{antibond}} = -13.5 + 2.5 = -11\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nNext, we determine the composition of each MO by finding the ratio of the coefficients, $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$. From the first secular equation, $(\\alpha_{A} - E)c_{A} + \\beta c_{B} = 0$, we find the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{B}}{c_{A}} = -\\frac{\\alpha_{A} - E}{\\beta}\n$$\nFor the bonding MO, $E = E_{\\mathrm{bond}} = -16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{B}}{c_{A}} = -\\frac{-12 - (-16)}{-2} = -\\frac{4}{-2} = 2\n$$\nThis means $c_{B} = 2c_{A}$. The wavefunction is of the form $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{bond}} \\propto c_{A}(\\phi_{A} + 2\\phi_{B})$. Since the magnitude of the coefficient for $\\phi_{B}$ is larger ($|c_{B}| > |c_{A}|$), atom $B$ dominates the bonding MO.

The wavefunction is of the form $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{antibond}} \\propto c_{B}(-2\\phi_{A} + \\phi_{B})$. Since the magnitude of the coefficient for $\\phi_{A}$ is larger ($|c_{A}| > |c_{B}|$), atom $A$ dominates the antibonding MO. This is also logical, as the higher-energy AO ($\\alpha_{A} = -12\\ \\mathrm{eV}$) contributes more to the higher-energy MO ($E_{\\mathrm{antibond}} = -11\\ \\mathrm{eV}$).\n\nThe final required values are the energies of the bonding and antibonding orbitals.",

            "solution": "The problem presents a valid, well-posed question in the domain of introductory quantum chemistry. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) theory and point-group symmetry. The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution within the specified model. We will proceed by first addressing the qualitative aspects concerning orbital mixing and then performing the quantitative calculation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires a qualitative justification for the selective mixing of atomic orbitals (AOs) in hydrogen fluoride ($\\mathrm{HF}$) based on symmetry and energy considerations. The second part requires a quantitative calculation of the hydrogen $1s$ orbital's contribution to the bonding molecular orbital (MO) within a simplified $2$-level model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the conditions for orbital mixing. According to LCAO theory, for two AOs to form an effective MO, two conditions must be met:\n$1$. The AOs must have the same symmetry with respect to the internuclear axis.\n$2$. The AOs must have comparable energies. The strength of the interaction is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the AOs.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{HF}$ molecule belongs to the $C_{\\infty v}$ point group, with the internuclear axis defined as the $z$-axis. We must determine the irreducible representations (irreps) of the relevant valence AOs in this point group. An AO that is symmetric with respect to rotation about the principal ($z$) axis is designated as $\\sigma$. An AO that is antisymmetric with respect to a $C_2$ rotation perpendicular to the principal axis and has one nodal plane containing the axis is designated as $\\pi$.\nThe hydrogen $1s$ AO is spherically symmetric and thus transforms as the totally symmetric irrep, which is $\\sigma$ (or more precisely, $\\Sigma^+$).\nFor fluorine, the $2s$ AO is also spherically symmetric and has $\\sigma$ symmetry. The $2p_z$ AO lies along the internuclear axis and is also cylindrically symmetric, hence it has $\\sigma$ symmetry. The $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ AOs are perpendicular to the internuclear axis and transform as a degenerate pair belonging to the $\\pi$ irrep.\n\nBased on the symmetry criterion (condition $1$), only orbitals of the same symmetry type can have a non-zero overlap integral and thus can mix. The hydrogen $1s$ orbital has $\\sigma$ symmetry. Therefore, it can mix with the fluorine $2s$ and $2p_z$ orbitals, which also have $\\sigma$ symmetry. The fluorine $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ orbitals have $\\pi$ symmetry. The overlap integral between an orbital of $\\sigma$ symmetry and an orbital of $\\pi$ symmetry is identically zero due to orthogonality. For instance, $\\langle 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} | 2p_{x,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle = 0$. Consequently, the fluorine $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ orbitals do not mix with the hydrogen $1s$ orbital and become non-bonding $\\pi$ MOs, localized on the fluorine atom.\n\nNext, we consider the energy criterion (condition $2$) to explain why the interaction between H $1s$ and F $2p_z$ is dominant, while the interaction with F $2s$ is minor. The on-site energies, $\\alpha$, which approximate the AO energies, are given for H $1s$ ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = -13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) and F $2p$ ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} = -18.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The energy of the F $2s$ orbital is significantly lower, approximately $-40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The energy difference between the interacting orbitals is $|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{2p_z,\\mathrm{F}}| = |-13.6 - (-18.6)| = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. In contrast, the energy difference with the F $2s$ orbital is $|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{2s,\\mathrm{F}}| \\approx |-13.6 - (-40)| = 26.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Because this energy gap is much larger, the mixing between H $1s$ and F $2s$ is much weaker than the mixing between H $1s$ and F $2p_z$. Therefore, the primary components of the bonding $\\sigma$ MO are the H $1s$ and F $2p_z$ orbitals.\n\nNow, we proceed to the quantitative calculation based on the specified $2$-level LCAO model using the basis $\\{ \\lvert 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle, \\lvert 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle \\}$. The molecular orbital wavefunction is $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = c_{\\mathrm{H}} \\lvert 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle + c_{\\mathrm{F}} \\lvert 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle$. Within the zero-overlap approximation ($S_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$), the secular determinant for this system is:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix} H_{\\mathrm{HH}} - E & H_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\\\ H_{\\mathrm{FH}} & H_{\\mathrm{FF}} - E \\end{vmatrix} =\n\\begin{vmatrix} \\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - E & \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} - E \\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\langle 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} | \\hat{H} | 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle = -13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} = \\langle 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} | \\hat{H} | 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle = -18.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and the resonance integral is $\\beta = \\langle 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} | \\hat{H} | 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle = -3.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nExpanding the determinant yields the characteristic equation:\n$$ (\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - E)(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} - E) - \\beta^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions for the energy $E$ are the eigenvalues, which correspond to the bonding and antibonding MO energies. The lower-energy solution, the bonding MO energy $E_{bond}$, is given by:\n$$ E_{bond} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}})^2 + 4\\beta^2} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} = -13.6 + (-18.6) = -32.2\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} = -13.6 - (-18.6) = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ E_{bond} = \\frac{-32.2}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(5.0)^2 + 4(-3.0)^2} = -16.1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{25 + 36} = -16.1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{61}\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nTo find the coefficients, we use the first row of the secular equations matrix:\n$$ (\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - E_{bond})c_{\\mathrm{H}} + \\beta c_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0 $$\nThe normalization condition for the wavefunction, under the zero-overlap approximation, is $|c_{\\mathrm{H}}|^2 + |c_{\\mathrm{F}}|^2 = 1$. From the secular equation, we have $c_{\\mathrm{F}} = -\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - E_{bond}}{\\beta} c_{\\mathrm{H}}$.

Question: For the given set, determine when the $\\sigma(2p)$ orbital lies below the $\\pi(2p)$ orbitals and characterize the effect of heteronuclearity.\n\nNow, I will validate the problem statement against fundamental criteria.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is founded upon LCAO-MO theory, a cornerstone of modern quantum chemistry. The principles of symmetry, overlap, and non-crossing/level repulsion are fundamental to this theory. The stated trends in atomic orbital energies and $2s-2p$ energy gaps across the second period are factually correct and are the direct consequence of increasing nuclear charge. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear set of initial conditions (atoms), a defined theoretical framework (LCAO-MO with specific constraints), and a concrete question (orbital ordering). From these elements, a unique, logical conclusion can be derived. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The instruction to argue from fundamentals rather than memorization ensures an objective, principle-based derivation.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific or logical flaws. It is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. It is a valid problem of chemical theory. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe central issue is the relative energy ordering of the MOs derived primarily from the $2p$ AOs: the $\\sigma$ MO (which we label $4\\sigma$, arising from $2p_z$ combination) and the two degenerate $\\pi$ MOs (which we label $1\\pi$, arising from $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ combinations). In the absence of other interactions, the head-on overlap of $p_z$ orbitals is stronger than the side-on overlap of $p_x/p_y$ orbitals, leading to a greater bonding-antibonding splitting for the $\\sigma$ orbitals. This would place the bonding $\\sigma(2p)$ MO below the bonding $\\pi(2p)$ MOs.\n\nHowever, the problem correctly identifies the critical mechanism that can alter this ordering: mixing of orbitals with the same symmetry. Along the internuclear axis ($z$-axis), both $2s$ and $2p_z$ AOs generate orbitals of $\\sigma$ symmetry. The complete basis set of valence $\\sigma$ AOs is thus $\\{2s_A, 2p_{zA}, 2s_B, 2p_{zB}\\}$. These four AOs mix to form four $\\sigma$ MOs. This interaction is commonly referred to as $s-p$ mixing.\n\nAccording to perturbation theory and the principle of level repulsion, this mixing pushes the lower-energy $\\sigma$ MOs further down and, crucially, pushes the higher-energy $\\sigma$ MOs further up in energy. The orbital in question, the one we call $\\sigma(2p)$, is the second-highest of these four $\\sigma$ MOs (the $4\\sigma$ orbital). Its energy is raised by $s-p$ mixing. The $\\pi$ MOs have no same-symmetry $s$ orbitals with which to mix, so their energy is unaffected by this specific mechanism.\nTherefore, strong $s-p$ mixing can raise the energy of the $\\sigma(2p)$ MO above that of the $\\pi(2p)$ MOs. Weak $s-p$ mixing leaves the \"natural\" ordering, $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$, intact.\n\nThe strength of this $s-p$ mixing depends on two factors as stated in principle (iii):\n1.  The energy separation between the mixing orbitals. Smaller separation leads to stronger mixing.\n2.  The overlap or coupling matrix element between them.\n\nLet us first consider the homonuclear case as a baseline. For atoms $\\mathrm{B}$ through $\\mathrm{N}$, the energy gap between the $2s$ and $2p$ AOs is relatively small. This leads to strong $s-p$ mixing, causing the $\\sigma_g(2p)$ MO to be pushed above the $\\pi_u(2p)$ MOs. For $\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{F}$, the problem states the $2s-2p$ gap is substantially larger. This increased energy separation reduces the extent of $s-p$ mixing. Consequently, the $\\sigma_g(2p)$ MO is not raised as much and remains below the $\\pi_u(2p)$ MOs. This defines the two ordering regimes: $\\mathrm{B_2}-\\mathrm{N_2}$ type ($\\pi$ below $\\sigma$) and $\\mathrm{O_2}-\\mathrm{F_2}$ type ($\\sigma$ below $\\pi$).\n\nNow, we extend the analysis to heteronuclear diatomics $\\mathrm{AB}$. There are two key modifications from the homonuclear case:\n1.  The AOs of the more electronegative atom are lower in energy than those of the less electronegative atom.\n2.  The intrinsic $2s-2p$ energy gap of each constituent atom contributes to the overall behavior.\n\nThe effect of heteronuclearity on $s-p$ mixing is critical. As the electronegativity difference between atoms $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ increases, the energy separation between the AOs of $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ increases. The lower-energy $\\sigma$ antechamber MOs (those derived mostly from $2s$ AOs) become heavily weighted toward the more electronegative atom's $2s$ orbital. The higher-energy $\\sigma$ MOs (like the $\\sigma(2p)$) gain more character from the less electronegative atom's $2p_z$ orbital. The effective energy gap between the interacting $s$-like and $p$-like MOs increases compared to a hypothetical \"average\" homonuclear case. According to principle (iii), a larger energy separation leads to weaker mixing. Thus, **increasing heteronuclearity (electronegativity difference) suppresses $s-p$ mixing and biases the orbital ordering toward the $\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{F_2}$ pattern where $\\sigma(2p)$ is below $\\pi(2p)$**.\n\nLet us apply this derived logic to the specific molecules:\n-   $\\mathrm{BN}$ and $\\mathrm{CN}$: These molecules are composed of atoms from the left side of the period ($\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{N}$), all of which have relatively small intrinsic $2s-2p$ gaps. While heteronuclear, the tendency for strong $s-p$ mixing is expected to dominate. They are isoelectronic with $\\mathrm{C_2}$ and $\\mathrm{C_2^{2-}}$ respectively. The ordering should be of the $\\mathrm{N_2}$-type: $\\pi(2p)$ below $\\sigma(2p)$.\n-   $\\mathrm{CO}$: This molecule is isoelectronic with $\\mathrm{N_2}$. However, it involves an atom, $\\mathrm{O}$, which has a large intrinsic $2s-2p$ gap. Furthermore, there is a significant electronegativity difference between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$. Both factors—the large gap of $\\mathrm{O}$ and the heteronuclearity—act to suppress $s-p$ mixing relative to $\\mathrm{N_2}$. Therefore, the ordering switches to the $\\mathrm{O_2}$-type: $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$.\n-   $\\mathrm{BO}$, $\\mathrm{NO}$, $\\mathrm{BF}$: Each of these molecules contains an atom from the right side of the period ($\\mathrm{O}$ or $\\mathrm{F}$) where the intrinsic $2s-2p$ gap is large. They are also significantly heteronuclear. Both factors strongly suppress $s-p$ mixing. The ordering will unequivocally be of the $\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{F_2}$-type: $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$.\n\nSummary of Predicted Orderings:\n-   $\\sigma(2p)$ above $\\pi(2p)$: $\\mathrm{BN}$, $\\mathrm{CN}$.\n-   $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$: $\\mathrm{BO}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, $\\mathrm{NO}$, $\\mathrm{BF}$.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each provided option based on this derivation.\n\nA. In $\\mathrm{BO}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, $\\mathrm{NO}$, and $\\mathrm{BF}$ the $\\sigma(2p)$ orbital lies below $\\pi(2p)$, while in $\\mathrm{BN}$ and $\\mathrm{CN}$ it lies above; increasing electronegativity difference reduces $\\sigma(2s)$–$\\sigma(2p)$ mixing and biases the ordering toward the $\\mathrm{O_{2}}/\\mathrm{F_{2}}$ pattern.\nThis statement precisely matches my derived conclusions. The enumeration of molecules and their corresponding orbital orderings is correct. The provided physical reason—that increasing electronegativity difference reduces $s-p$ mixing and favors the $\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{F_2}$ pattern—is also precisely the correct fundamental argument derived from the given principles.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Only molecules with both atoms from the right side ($\\mathrm{O}$ or $\\mathrm{F}$) have $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$; heteronuclearity strengthens $\\sigma$–$\\sigma$ mixing because inversion symmetry is absent, so $\\mathrm{BO}$ and $\\mathrm{BF}$ adopt the $\\mathrm{N_{2}}$-like ordering.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, my analysis shows $\\mathrm{BO}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$, and $\\mathrm{NO}$ also have $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$, contradicting the \"only molecules with both atoms from the right side\" claim. Second, the assertion that \"heteronuclearity strengthens $\\sigma$–$\\sigma$ mixing\" is fundamentally false; the increased energy separation of AOs weakens it. Third, the conclusion that $\\mathrm{BO}$ and $\\mathrm{BF}$ adopt the $\\mathrm{N_2}$-like ordering is the opposite of the correct result.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. All heteronuclear combinations of second-row atoms have $\\sigma(2p)$ above $\\pi(2p)$ due to allowed $s$–$p$ mixing on the molecule, so $\\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{NO}$ follow $\\mathrm{N_{2}}$.\nThis statement makes an incorrect generalization that all heteronuclear species show $\\sigma(2p)$ above $\\pi(2p)$. This ignores the varying strength of $s-p$ mixing, which depends on the specific atoms. The conclusion that $\\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{NO}$ follow the $\\mathrm{N_2}$ pattern is specifically what the derivation showed to be false; they switch to the $\\mathrm{O_2}$ pattern due to suppressed mixing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The ordering depends only on the number of valence electrons; all six listed species have the same $\\sigma(2p)$ vs. $\\pi(2p)$ ordering.\nThis statement is flawed. The ordering depends on the fundamental properties of the constituent atoms ($2s-2p$ gap, electronegativity), not simply the electron count. The isoelectronic pair $\\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}$ provides a direct counterexample to this idea. Furthermore, the claim that all six species have the same ordering is false, as the ordering switches between the BN/CN pair and the other four molecules.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThus, only option A is consistent with a rigorous derivation from the foundational principles specified.",
