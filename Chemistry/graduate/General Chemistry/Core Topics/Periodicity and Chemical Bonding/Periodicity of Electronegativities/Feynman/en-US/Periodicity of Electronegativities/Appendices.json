            "problem": "A heteronuclear diatomic molecule $AB$ and the corresponding homonuclear diatomics $A_{2}$ and $B_{2}$ are studied in the gas phase.

Microwave Stark spectroscopy establishes that in $AB$ the atom $B$ carries the partial negative charge.\n\nStarting from the definition of bond dissociation energy and Pauling’s postulate that the heteronuclear bond $AB$ is stabilized, relative to a purely covalent reference, by an “extra” energy equal to the difference between $D_{AB}$ and the arithmetic mean of $D_{AA}$ and $D_{BB}$, and that on the Pauling scale the square of the electronegativity difference equals this extra stabilization expressed per bond in electronvolts, derive an explicit expression for the signed electronegativity difference $\\Delta \\chi_{AB} \\equiv \\chi_{B} - \\chi_{A}$ in terms of $D_{AB}$, $D_{AA}$, $D_{BB}$, the Avogadro constant $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$, and the Joule-per-electron-volt conversion $E_{\\mathrm{eV}}$ defined by $1 \\text{ eV} = E_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\text{ J}$.

The units are eV per unit of atomic number.\n\nPart 3: Analysis of Periodic Trend\n\nThe positive slope, $m \\approx 1.071$, confirms the general trend that electronegativity increases across a period with increasing atomic number $Z$. This is due to the increase in effective nuclear charge, which enhances the attraction of the nucleus for electrons. However, the trend is not monotonic and exhibits significant deviations due to electron configurations and inter-electronic repulsion.\nA notable deviation occurs from Beryllium ($Z=4$) to Boron ($Z=5$), where $\\chi_{\\text{M}}$ decreases. Beryllium ($[He] 2s^2$) has a stable, filled $2s$ subshell, resulting in a high ionization energy $I$ and an unfavorable (negative) electron affinity $A$. Boron ($[He] 2s^2 2p^1$) has a single electron in the higher-energy $2p$ orbital, which is more easily removed (lower $I$ than Be), causing a dip in $\\chi_{\\text{M}}$.\nAnother critical point is between Nitrogen ($Z=7$) and Oxygen ($Z=8$). Nitrogen ($[He] 2s^2 2p^3$) has a half-filled $2p$ subshell, a configuration of special stability due to maximized exchange energy. This leads to a very high ionization energy and an unfavorable (negative) electron affinity, as the incoming electron must pair up, introducing Coulombic repulsion. Oxygen ($[He] 2s^2 2p^4$) has one paired set of $2p$ electrons. The repulsion between these paired electrons makes one of them easier to remove than an electron from Nitrogen, so $I$ for Oxygen is less than $I$ for Nitrogen. This drop in ionization energy moderates the increase of $\\chi_{\\text{M}}$ from Nitrogen to Oxygen.\nFinally, the electronegativity peaks at Fluorine ($Z=9$) and then drops for Neon ($Z=10$). Fluorine ($[He] 2s^2 2p^5$) has a very high $I$ and the most favorable $A$ in the period, as it is one electron short of a stable noble gas configuration. Neon ($[He] 2s^2 2p^6$) has a completely filled valence shell, resulting in the highest ionization energy but a very large and negative electron affinity because an added electron must occupy the next principal shell ($n=3$). This highly unfavorable $A$ causes the calculated $\\chi_{\\text{M}}$ of Neon to be lower than that of Fluorine.",

The BDE for the first hydrogen is $\\mathrm{BDE(HO-H)} \\approx 492\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, whereas $\\mathrm{BDE(HS-H)} \\approx 363\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The much lower BDE of the $\\mathrm{S-H}$ bond means that breaking it is far less enthalpically demanding. This factor strongly favors higher acidity for $\\mathrm{H_2S}$. The physical reason for the weaker bond is the larger size of the sulfur $3p$ orbital compared to the oxygen $2p$ orbital, leading to poorer orbital overlap with the compact hydrogen $1s$ orbital and a longer, weaker bond.\n    *   **Electron Affinity (EA)**: This term relates to the stability of the resulting conjugate base. The electron affinity of the hydroxyl radical is $\\mathrm{EA(\\cdot OH)} \\approx 176\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, while for the hydrosulfidyl radical it is $\\mathrm{EA(\\cdot SH)} \\approx 221\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The more exothermic electron affinity for $\\cdot\\mathrm{SH}$ indicates that the $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ anion is more stable in the gas phase than the $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ anion. This is due to the larger size and greater polarizability of sulfur, which allows for better delocalization of the negative charge. This factor also favors higher acidity for $\\mathrm{H_2S}$.\n    *   Overall, the gas-phase acidity of $\\mathrm{H_2S}$ is substantially greater than that of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, primarily due to the dominant effect of the weaker $\\mathrm{S-H}$ bond.\n\n2.  **Solvation Effects**:\n    *   **Anion Solvation**: The hydroxide ion, $\\mathrm{HO^-}$, is smaller and has a higher charge density than the hydrosulfide ion, $\\mathrm{HS^-}$. Consequently, $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ interacts much more strongly with polar water molecules via ion-dipole forces and hydrogen bonding. The Gibbs free energy of hydration is significantly more negative for $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ ($\\approx -430\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$) than for $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ ($\\approx -340\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$). This stronger solvation of $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ preferentially stabilizes the product of water deprotonation, a factor that, by itself, would make $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ a stronger acid.\n    *   **Neutral Molecule Solvation**: The solvation of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ in liquid water is, by definition, very strong. The solvation of $\\mathrm{H_2S}$ in water is much weaker. The difference, $-[\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{H_2S}) - \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{H_2O})]$, is a term that favors the acidity of $\\mathrm{H_2S}$.\n\n**Conclusion**: The experimental observation that $\\mathrm{H_2S}$ is a stronger acid than $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ in water implies that the gas-phase factors (predominantly the much weaker $\\mathrm{S-H}$ bond) are the dominant effects, outweighing the opposing effect from the more favorable solvation of the $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ anion. A naive prediction based solely on oxygen's higher electronegativity fails because it does not account for these dominant thermodynamic contributions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The substantially lower bond dissociation enthalpy of $\\mathrm{S-H}$ relative to $\\mathrm{O-H}$, arising from poorer overlap between the hydrogen $1s$ orbital and the larger, more diffuse $\\mathrm{S}\\ 3p$ valence orbitals (and the longer equilibrium bond length), reduces the enthalpic cost of deprotonation; this effect outweighs the opposing trend suggested by sulfur’s lower electronegativity.**\nThis statement is precise and correct. It identifies the principal factor—the lower Bond Dissociation Enthalpy of the $\\mathrm{S-H}$ bond—and provides the correct physical explanation based on orbital overlap. It correctly states that this effect is dominant and overcomes the expectation based on electronegativity.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The conjugate base $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ is larger and more polarizable than $\\mathrm{HO^-}$; in the gas phase, this increased polarizability allows the excess electron density to be more diffuse and better stabilized by electronic correlation and dispersion, lowering the intrinsic deprotonation free energy.**\nThis statement is also correct. The stability of the conjugate base is a crucial component of acidity. In the gas phase, the larger size and higher polarizability of $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ compared to $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ results in greater charge dispersal and stabilization. This contributes to the more favorable electron affinity of the $\\cdot\\mathrm{SH}$ radical and thus to a lower gas-phase deprotonation energy for $\\mathrm{H_2S}$. This is a valid contributing part of the overall rationale.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In water, $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ is less strongly solvated than $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ because its charge is concentrated on a smaller, harder base; therefore, differential hydration stabilizes $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ more, enhancing the acidity of $\\mathrm{H_2S}$.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental factual error. Due to its smaller size and higher charge density, the $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ ion is *more*, not less, strongly solvated in water than the $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ ion. The premise is false, and therefore the conclusion is unsupported and incorrect. The actual differential hydration favors the acidity of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, opposing the observed trend.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The availability of low-lying S $3d$ orbitals permits $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ to delocalize negative charge via $d$-orbital participation, stabilizing the conjugate base relative to $\\mathrm{HO^-}$ and thereby increasing the acidity of $\\mathrm{H_2S}$.**\nThis statement invokes the concept of $d$-orbital participation for a second-row main group element. Modern high-level electronic structure calculations have demonstrated that the energetic contribution of $3d$ orbitals to the bonding and stability of such species is negligible. The stability of $\\mathrm{HS^-}$ is adequately explained by considering only valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals. This rationale is outdated and scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. If one considered only electronegativity, the decrease from oxygen to sulfur would suggest weaker acidity for $\\mathrm{H_2S}$; however, down-group periodic trends in bond strength and in anion size/polarizability dominate the overall thermodynamics and reverse that naive prediction for group $16$ hydrides.**\nThis statement provides an accurate high-level summary of the entire problem. It correctly identifies the simple but incorrect prediction based on electronegativity. It then correctly states that the periodic trends in bond strength (Option A) and anion stability related to size/polarizability (Option B) are the dominant factors that determine the actual chemical behavior. This is a correct and comprehensive conceptual explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nThree options provide correct rationales for the observed phenomenon.",
