The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, based on standard principles of solid-state crystallography and geometry. It is a formalizable problem with a unique solution for each lattice type under the given hard-sphere model. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe analysis relies on determining the shortest and second-shortest distances between atomic centers in each of the three cubic Bravais lattices: Simple Cubic (SC), Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC). The lattice parameter is denoted by $a$, and the radius of the hard-sphere atoms is $r$. The contact condition states that the distance between the centers of touching spheres (nearest neighbors, NN) is $2r$.\n\n**1. Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\n\nIn an SC lattice, atoms are located only at the corners of the conventional cubic unit cell. Let us consider an atom at the origin with coordinates $(0, 0, 0)$. The positions of its neighboring atoms in the lattice are at integer multiples of the lattice parameter $a$ along the Cartesian axes.\n\n- The distance to the nearest atom centers along the cube edges (e.g., to the atom at $(a, 0, 0)$) in the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ family of directions is:\n$$ d_{\\langle 100 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = a $$\n- The distance to the atom centers along the face diagonals (e.g., to the atom at $(a, a, 0)$) in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family of directions is:\n$$ d_{\\langle 110 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (a-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\,a $$\n- The distance to the atom centers along the body diagonals (e.g., to the atom at $(a, a, a)$) in the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ family of directions is:\n$$ d_{\\langle 111 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (a-0)^2 + (a-0)^2} = \\sqrt{3a^2} = \\sqrt{3}\\,a $$\n\nComparing these distances, since $1 < \\sqrt{2} < \\sqrt{3}$, the shortest distance is $a$. Therefore, the nearest neighbors are along the cube edges. The hard-sphere contact condition dictates that these nearest neighbors must touch.\n$$ d_{NN} = a = 2r $$\nThe next-nearest neighbor (NNN) distance is the second-shortest distance, which is $\\sqrt{2}\\,a$. Since $a=2r$, the NNN distance is $\\sqrt{2}(2r) = 2\\sqrt{2}r$. Because $\\sqrt{2} > 1$, this distance is strictly greater than $2r$, confirming that spheres do not touch along the face diagonals.\n\n**2. Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\n\nIn a BCC lattice, atoms are at the corners and at the body center of the conventional unit cell. Let us consider the atom at the corner origin $(0, 0, 0)$. Its potential nearest neighbors are the atom at the body center, with coordinates $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$, and the atoms at the adjacent corners, e.g., $(a, 0, 0)$.\n\n- The distance from the corner atom to the body-center atom, along the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ direction, is:\n$$ d_{\\text{corner-body}} = \\sqrt{(a/2-0)^2 + (a/2-0)^2 + (a/2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a $$\n- The distance from the corner atom to an adjacent corner atom, along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction, is:\n$$ d_{\\text{corner-corner}} = a $$\n\nComparing these distances, since $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 < 1$, the shortest distance is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$. Therefore, the nearest neighbors are the corner atom and the body-center atom. The hard-sphere contact occurs along the body diagonal.\n$$ d_{NN} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 2r \\implies 4r = \\sqrt{3}\\,a $$\nThe next-nearest neighbor distance is the second-shortest distance, which is $a$. This is the separation along the cube edge, $\\langle 100 \\rangle$. The ratio of the NNN distance ($a$) to the NN distance ($2r$) is $\\frac{a}{2r} = \\frac{a}{(\\sqrt{3}/2)a} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Since $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} > 1$, the distance $a$ is greater than $2r$, confirming that spheres do not touch along the cube edges.\n\n**3. Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice**\n\nIn an FCC lattice, atoms are at the corners and at the center of each face. Let us consider the atom at the corner origin $(0, 0, 0)$. Its potential nearest neighbors are the atoms at the adjacent face centers, e.g., $(a/2, a/2, 0)$, and the atoms at adjacent corners, e.g., $(a, 0, 0)$.\n\n- The distance from the corner atom to a face-center atom, along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ direction, is:\n$$ d_{\\text{corner-face}} = \\sqrt{(a/2-0)^2 + (a/2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}a $$\n- The distance from the corner atom to an adjacent corner atom, along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction, is:\n$$ d_{\\text{corner-corner}} = a $$\n\nComparing these distances, since $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 < 1$, the shortest distance is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}a$. Therefore, the nearest neighbors are the corner atom and the adjacent face-center atom. The hard-sphere contact occurs along the face diagonal.\n$$ d_{NN} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}a = 2r \\implies 4r = \\sqrt{2}\\,a $$\nThe next-nearest neighbor distance is the second-shortest distance, which is $a$. This is the separation along the cube edge, $\\langle 100 \\rangle$. The ratio of the NNN distance ($a$) to the NN distance ($\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}a$) is $\\frac{a}{(\\sqrt{2}/2)a} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2} > 1$, the distance $a$ is greater than the NN distance, and spheres do not touch along the cube edges.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. In Simple Cubic (SC), spheres touch only along cube edges $ \\langle 100 \\rangle $, so the nearest-neighbor distance equals $a$ and hence $2r = a$. The next-nearest neighbor separation lies along face diagonals $ \\langle 110 \\rangle $ and equals $\\sqrt{2}\\,a > 2r$, so faces do not produce contact.\n- This statement accurately reflects the analysis for the SC lattice. The nearest-neighbor distance is $a$, leading to $2r=a$. The next-nearest-neighbor distance is $\\sqrt{2}\\,a$. Since $a=2r$, this distance is $\\sqrt{2}(2r) > 2r$. The statement is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. In Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), spheres touch along body diagonals $ \\langle 111 \\rangle $ between a corner and the body center, leading to $4r = \\sqrt{3}\\,a$. The edge separation along $ \\langle 100 \\rangle $ equals $a$, which exceeds the nearest-neighbor distance $2r$ by a factor $2/\\sqrt{3}$, so edges do not produce contact.\n- This statement accurately reflects the analysis for the BCC lattice. Contact is along the body diagonal, giving $d_{NN} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 2r$, or $4r = \\sqrt{3}\\,a$. The edge separation is $a$. The ratio $\\frac{a}{2r} = \\frac{a}{(\\sqrt{3}/2)a} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The statement is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. In Face-Centered Cubic (FCC), spheres touch along face diagonals $ \\langle 110 \\rangle $ between a corner and a face center, giving $4r = \\sqrt{2}\\,a$. The next-nearest neighbor separation along $ \\langle 100 \\rangle $ equals $a$, which is larger than the nearest-neighbor distance by a factor $\\sqrt{2}$, so edges do not produce contact.\n- This statement accurately reflects the analysis for the FCC lattice. Contact is along the face diagonal, giving $d_{NN} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}a = 2r$, or $4r = \\sqrt{2}\\,a$. The next-nearest neighbor distance is $a$. The ratio of the NNN distance to the NN distance is $\\frac{a}{(\\sqrt{2}/2)a} = \\sqrt{2}$. The statement is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. In Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), spheres also touch along the cube edge $ \\langle 100 \\rangle $, so both $2r = a$ and $4r = \\sqrt{3}\\,a$ hold simultaneously.\n- This statement is a contradiction. If $2r=a$, then $4r = \\sqrt{3}\\,a$ becomes $2(2r) = \\sqrt{3}(2r)$, which implies $2 = \\sqrt{3}$. This is a falsehood. In the hard-sphere model, contact occurs only along the shortest interatomic distance. The statement is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In Simple Cubic (SC), the next-nearest neighbor separation equals the nearest-neighbor separation because the face diagonal has length $\\sqrt{2}\\,a = 2r$.\n- This statement presents multiple falsehoods. For SC, the NN distance is $a$ and the NNN distance is $\\sqrt{2}\\,a$. These are not equal. Furthermore, the condition $\\sqrt{2}\\,a = 2r$ combined with the actual SC relationship $a=2r$ yields $\\sqrt{2}(2r) = 2r$, which implies $\\sqrt{2}=1$. This is false. The statement is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that requires the application of standard geometric principles to established physical models.

For a cubic cell of edge length $a$, the volume is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$. If there are $N$ atoms per conventional unit cell and each atom is a sphere of radius $r$, the volume of one atom is $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.

Each corner atom is shared by $8$ adjacent unit cells. Therefore, the number of atoms per conventional unit cell is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{SC}} = 8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1 $$\n    In the SC structure, the nearest-neighboring atoms are along the edges of the cube. The distance between the centers of two nearest-neighbor atoms is equal to the lattice constant, $a$. The problem states that this distance is $2r$. Thus, we have the relation:\n    $$ a = 2r \\implies r = \\frac{a}{2} $$\n    Substituting $N_{\\text{SC}} = 1$ and $r = a/2$ into the general packing fraction formula:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\text{SC}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3}{8}}{a^3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{24} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $$\n\n2.  **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\n    For the BCC lattice, atoms are located at the $8$ corners of the cube and one atom is at the geometric center of the cube.

The distance between the centers of the corner and body-center atoms is half of this length, $\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. According to the problem, this distance is $2r$. Thus:\n    $$ \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2r \\implies r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4} $$\n    Substituting $N_{\\text{BCC}} = 2$ and $r = a\\sqrt{3}/4$ into the formula:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\text{BCC}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3}}{64}}{a^3} = \\frac{24\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{192} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8} $$\n\n3.  **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice**\n    For the FCC lattice, atoms are located at the $8$ corners of the cube and at the center of each of the $6$ faces.
