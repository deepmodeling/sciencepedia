To describe this structure efficiently, we use the concept of a primitive cell, the smallest repeating unit that can tile all of space. This exercise challenges you to derive the volume of the primitive cells for two common cubic lattices from their fundamental vector definitions and to calculate their Atomic Packing Factor (APF), a key measure of how efficiently atoms fill the space . Mastering these first-principles calculations provides a solid geometric foundation for understanding the structure-property relationships in crystalline materials.",

            "problem": "A monatomic crystalline solid can be idealized as identical, non-overlapping hard spheres located at the points of a Bravais lattice, with nearest neighbors in contact. Consider two monatomic Bravais lattices with the same conventional cubic cell edge length $a$: the body-centered cubic and the face-centered cubic. For the body-centered cubic lattice, take the primitive vectors to be $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\frac{a}{2}(-1,1,1)$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,-1,1)$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,1,-1)$.

The problem is a standard exercise in introductory solid-state physics. We will proceed with a full derivation as requested.\n\nThe volume of a primitive cell, $V$, defined by the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}$, is given by the absolute value of the scalar triple product of these vectors:\n$$V = |\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{3})|$$\nThis is equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix whose rows (or columns) are the components of the primitive vectors.\n\nFirst, we calculate the primitive cell volume for the body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. The given primitive vectors are $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\frac{a}{2}(-1,1,1)$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,-1,1)$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,1,-1)$. The volume $V_{\\mathrm{bcc}}$ is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ \\frac{a}{2}  -\\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2}  -\\frac{a}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right|$$\nWe can factor out the term $\\frac{a}{2}$ from each row:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  1 \\\\ 1  -1  1 \\\\ 1  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|$$\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n$$\\det = -1((-1)(-1) - (1)(1)) - 1((1)(-1) - (1)(1)) + 1((1)(1) - (-1)(1))$$\n$$\\det = -1(1-1) - 1(-1-1) + 1(1+1) = -1(0) - 1(-2) + 1(2) = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4$$\nThus, the volume of the BCC primitive cell is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\frac{a^3}{8} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{a^3}{2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the primitive cell volume for the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The given primitive vectors are $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\frac{a}{2}(0,1,1)$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,0,1)$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,1,0)$. The volume $V_{\\mathrm{fcc}}$ is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ \\frac{a}{2}  0  \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|$$\nFactoring out the term $\\frac{a}{2}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|$$\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n$$\\det = 0(0 - 1) - 1((1)(0) - (1)(1)) + 1((1)(1) - (0)(1))$$\n$$\\det = 0 - 1(-1) + 1(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nThus, the volume of the FCC primitive cell is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\frac{a^3}{8} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{a^3}{4}$$\n\nNow, we compute the Atomic Packing Factor (APF) for each lattice. The APF is defined as the fraction of the primitive cell volume occupied by the atom associated with the lattice point. Since there is exactly one lattice point per primitive cell, the APF is the ratio of the volume of a single atomic sphere, $V_{\\text{atom}}$, to the volume of the primitive cell, $V$.\n$$\\mathrm{APF} = \\frac{V_{\\text{atom}}}{V}$$\nThe volume of a spherical atom of radius $R$ is $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. To find the APF, we must first establish the relationship between the atomic radius $R$ and the conventional cubic cell edge length $a$ using the condition that nearest-neighbor atoms are in contact.\n\nFor the BCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners and the body center of the conventional cube. The nearest neighbors are a corner atom and the body-center atom. The distance between them is half the length of the space diagonal of the cube. The space diagonal has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$. For nearest neighbors to be in contact, the distance between their centers must be twice the atomic radius, $2R$.\n$$2R = \\frac{1}{2} (a\\sqrt{3})$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\nThe volume of one atom in the BCC structure is:\n$$V_{\\text{atom, bcc}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{bcc}}^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3}}{64} = \\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{16}$$\nThe APF for the BCC lattice is then:\n$$\\mathrm{APF}_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{atom, bcc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{bcc}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{16}}{\\frac{a^3}{2}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{16} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{8}$$\n\nFor the FCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners and the centers of each face of the conventional cube. The nearest neighbors are a corner atom and an adjacent face-center atom. The distance between them is half the length of a face diagonal. The face diagonal has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$. The nearest-neighbor contact condition gives:\n$$2R = \\frac{1}{2} (a\\sqrt{2})$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4}$$\nThe volume of one atom in the FCC structure is:\n$$V_{\\text{atom, fcc}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{fcc}}^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2}}{64} = \\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{2}}{24}$$\nThe APF for the FCC lattice is then:\n$$\\mathrm{APF}_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{atom, fcc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{fcc}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{2}}{24}}{\\frac{a^3}{4}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{24} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{6}$$\n\nThe requested quantities have been derived from the given information and fundamental principles.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the lattice parameter, $a$, of a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal from a set of X-ray diffraction data. A rigorous solution must be constructed by applying fundamental physical laws and a systematic statistical method, specifically a least-squares fit constrained through the origin.\n\nWe begin with the two fundamental relations governing this physical situation. First is Bragg's law, which describes the condition for constructive interference of X-rays diffracted by crystal planes:\n$$ n\\lambda = 2d_{hkl}\\sin(\\theta_{hkl}) $$\nwhere $n$ is the diffraction order, $\\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength, $d_{hkl}$ is the interplanar spacing for the crystal planes with Miller indices $(hkl)$, and $\\theta_{hkl}$ is the Bragg angle. The problem specifies first-order diffraction, so we set $n=1$.\n\nSecond is the formula for the interplanar spacing for a cubic crystal system, relating $d_{hkl}$ to the lattice parameter $a$:\n$$ d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} $$\n\nWe combine these two equations by substituting the expression for $d_{hkl}$ into Bragg's law:\n$$ \\lambda = 2 \\left( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} \\right) \\sin(\\theta_{hkl}) $$\nTo construct a linear model suitable for a least-squares analysis, we rearrange this equation. Squaring both sides yields:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = 4 \\frac{a^2}{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} \\sin^2(\\theta_{hkl}) $$\nThis can be rewritten in a linear form $Y = mX$:\n$$ \\sin^2(\\theta_{hkl}) = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2}\\right) (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) $$\nHere, we define our variables for the linear regression as:\n- $Y_i = \\sin^2(\\theta_i)$\n- $X_i = h_i^2 + k_i^2 + l_i^2$\n\nThe model is $Y_i = mX_i$, which represents a line passing through the origin with a slope $m$ given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2} $$\nThe task is to find the best-fit value for this slope $m$ using the provided experimental data. For an ordinary least-squares regression constrained to pass through the origin, the slope $m$ that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, $\\sum(Y_i - mX_i)^2$, is given by the formula:\n$$ m = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i Y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i^2} $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of observed diffraction peaks. After determining $m$, we can solve for the lattice parameter $a$:\n$$ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4m}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{m}} $$\nWe now systematically process the given data.
