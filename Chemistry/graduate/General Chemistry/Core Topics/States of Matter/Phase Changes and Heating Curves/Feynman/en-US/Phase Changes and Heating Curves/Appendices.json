            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in chemical thermodynamics, amenable to rigorous analysis. We shall proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe condition for phase equilibrium between two phases, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, of a pure substance is the equality of their molar Gibbs energies, which are equivalent to their chemical potentials. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\ng^\\alpha(T,P) = g^\\beta(T,P)\n$$\nThe problem provides linear approximations for the molar Gibbs energies in the vicinity of a coexistence point:\n$$\ng^\\alpha(T,P) = a_\\alpha + b_\\alpha T + c_\\alpha P\n$$\n$$\ng^\\beta(T,P) = a_\\beta + b_\\beta T + c_\\beta P\n$$\nHere, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $P$ is the pressure, and the coefficients $a_\\phi$, $b_\\phi$, and $c_\\phi$ are constants for phase $\\phi \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$ over the narrow range of interest.\n\nTo derive the coexistence line $P(T)$, we substitute the given expressions into the equilibrium condition:\n$$\na_\\alpha + b_\\alpha T + c_\\alpha P = a_\\beta + b_\\beta T + c_\\beta P\n$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $P$. We rearrange the terms to isolate $P$:\n$$\nc_\\alpha P - c_\\beta P = a_\\beta - a_\\alpha + b_\\beta T - b_\\alpha T\n$$\nFactoring out $P$ on the left-hand side and $T$ on the right-hand side yields:\n$$\n(c_\\alpha - c_\\beta) P = (a_\\beta - a_\\alpha) + (b_\\beta - b_\\alpha) T\n$$\nProvided that $c_\\alpha \\neq c_\\beta$, which is the general case where the molar volumes of the two phases are different, we can divide by the term $(c_\\alpha - c_\\beta)$ to obtain the explicit expression for the coexistence pressure as a function of temperature:\n$$\nP(T) = \\frac{(a_\\beta - a_\\alpha) + (b_\\beta - b_\\alpha) T}{c_\\alpha - c_\\beta}\n$$\nThis equation describes a straight line in the $P-T$ plane, which is the phase boundary as predicted by this linear model.\n\nNext, we must interpret the physical meaning of the parameters $b_\\phi$ and $c_\\phi$. We begin with the fundamental thermodynamic relation for the differential of the molar Gibbs energy for a single-component system:\n$$\ndg = v dP - s dT\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the molar volume and $s$ is the molar entropy. From this exact differential, we identify the partial derivatives of $g(T,P)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = v \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = -s\n$$\nNow, we compute the same partial derivatives for the given linear model, $g^\\phi(T,P) = a_\\phi + b_\\phi T + c_\\phi P$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial g^\\phi}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} (a_\\phi + b_\\phi T + c_\\phi P) = c_\\phi\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial g^\\phi}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} (a_\\phi + b_\\phi T + c_\\phi P) = b_\\phi\n$$\nBy comparing these results with the fundamental thermodynamic identities, we establish the interpretations. For each phase $\\phi$:\n- The parameter $c_\\phi$ represents the molar volume of the phase, $v^\\phi$. Thus, $c_\\phi = v^\\phi$.\n- The parameter $b_\\phi$ represents the negative of the molar entropy of the phase, $-s^\\phi$. Thus, $b_\\phi = -s^\\phi$.\n\nSince the model is an approximation for a narrow region, $v^\\phi$ and $s^\\phi$ are treated as constants within this model, representing the average values in that region of the $P-T$ space.\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical meaning of the slope of the coexistence line. The coexistence line is given by $P(T)$. Its slope is the derivative $\\frac{dP}{dT}$. Differentiating our derived expression for $P(T)$ with respect to $T$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{a_\\beta - a_\\alpha}{c_\\alpha - c_\\beta} + \\frac{b_\\beta - b_\\alpha}{c_\\alpha - c_\\beta} T \\right) = \\frac{b_\\beta - b_\\alpha}{c_\\alpha - c_\\beta}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the physical interpretations of the parameters $b_\\phi$ and $c_\\phi$. Let the transition be from phase $\\alpha$ to phase $\\beta$. The change in molar entropy is $\\Delta s_{\\alpha \\to \\beta} = s^\\beta - s^\\alpha$, and the change in molar volume is $\\Delta v_{\\alpha \\to \\beta} = v^\\beta - v^\\alpha$.\nUsing $b_\\phi = -s^\\phi$ and $c_\\phi = v^\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{(-s^\\beta) - (-s^\\alpha)}{v^\\alpha - v^\\beta} = \\frac{s^\\alpha - s^\\beta}{v^\\alpha - v^\\beta} = \\frac{-(s^\\beta - s^\\alpha)}{-(v^\\beta - v^\\alpha)} = \\frac{s^\\beta - s^\\alpha}{v^\\beta - v^\\alpha}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta s_{\\alpha \\to \\beta}}{\\Delta v_{\\alpha \\to \\beta}}\n$$\nThis result is the Clapeyron equation. It demonstrates that the slope of the phase boundary on a $P-T$ diagram is determined by the ratio of the molar entropy change to the molar volume change during the phase transition. At thermodynamic equilibrium, $\\Delta g = \\Delta h - T\\Delta s = 0$, which implies $\\Delta s = \\frac{\\Delta h}{T}$, where $\\Delta h$ is the molar enthalpy of transition. Substituting this into the slope expression gives the more common form of the Clapeyron equation, $\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta h_{\\alpha \\to \\beta}}{T\\Delta v_{\\alpha \\to \\beta}}$. The linear model for Gibbs energy inherently produces a constant slope, which corresponds to the Clapeyron equation under the approximation that $\\Delta s$ and $\\Delta v$ are constant over the temperature range considered.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form expression for $P(T)$.",

            "solution": "**Derivation of the Expression for Total Heat ($q$)**\n\nThe analysis begins with the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system:\n$$dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$$\nwhere $dU$ is the change in internal energy, $\\delta q$ is the heat added to the system, and $\\delta w$ is the work done on the system. The problem specifies that only pressure-volume work is possible. For a quasi-static (reversible) process, the work done on the system is given by $\\delta w = -P dV$, where $P$ is the system pressure and $dV$ is the change in volume. Thus, the First Law becomes:\n$$dU = \\delta q - P dV$$\nThe definition of enthalpy, $H$, is $H = U + PV$. The differential of enthalpy is:\n$$dH = dU + P dV + V dP$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$ from the First Law into the differential of enthalpy yields:\n$$dH = (\\delta q - P dV) + P dV + V dP = \\delta q + V dP$$\nThe problem states that the heating occurs at constant external pressure. For a quasi-static process, the internal pressure of the system equilibrates with the constant external pressure, meaning the process is isobaric ($P = \\text{constant}$). Therefore, the differential of pressure is zero, $dP = 0$. Under this condition, the change in enthalpy is equal to the heat supplied:\n$$dH = \\delta q_{p}$$\nThe subscript $p$ denotes that this relation holds at constant pressure.\n\nThe heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_{p}$, is defined as the partial derivative of enthalpy with respect to temperature at constant pressure:\n$$C_{p} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p}$$\nFor a process occurring at constant pressure, this can be rearranged to give the differential change in enthalpy:\n$$dH = C_{p} dT$$\nThe problem provides the mass-specific heat capacity, which is the heat capacity per unit mass. Let us denote this by $c_{p}(T)$ to distinguish it from the total heat capacity $C_{p}$. The problem statement gives $c_{p}(T) = a+bT$. The total heat capacity of the sample of mass $m$ is $C_{p}(T) = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) = m(a+bT)$.\n\nCombining our findings, we have an expression for the differential amount of heat, $\\delta q_{p}$, that must be supplied to change the temperature of the sample by $dT$:\n$$\\delta q_{p} = dH = C_{p}(T) dT = m(a+bT) dT$$\nTo find the total heat, $q$, required to raise the temperature from $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$, we must integrate this differential expression between the initial and final temperatures:\n$$q = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} m(a+bT) dT$$\nSince the mass $m$ and constants $a$ and $b$ are not dependent on temperature, they can be factored out of the integral where appropriate:\n$$q = m \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} (a+bT) dT$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$q = m \\left[ aT + \\frac{1}{2}bT^{2} \\right]_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}$$\nEvaluating the definite integral at the limits $T_{2}$ and $T_{1}$:\n$$q = m \\left( \\left(aT_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}bT_{2}^{2}\\right) - \\left(aT_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}bT_{1}^{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final closed-form expression for the total heat supplied:\n$$q = m \\left( a(T_{2} - T_{1}) + \\frac{1}{2}b(T_{2}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) \\right)$$\n\n**Analysis of the Heating Curve Curvature**\n\nA heating curve plots temperature $T$ on the vertical axis against the cumulative heat input $q$ on the horizontal axis. The slope of this curve at any point is given by the derivative $\\frac{dT}{dq}$.\nFrom our differential relationship $\\delta q = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) dT$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{dq}{dT} = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) = m(a+bT)$$\nThe slope of the heating curve is the reciprocal of this expression:\n$$\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dT}{dq} = \\frac{1}{m(a+bT)}$$\nThe curvature of the plot is determined by the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$. We can compute this derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dq}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{dT}{dq}$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of the slope with respect to temperature:\n$$\\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left( [m(a+bT)]^{-1} \\right) = -1 \\cdot [m(a+bT)]^{-2} \\cdot (mb) = \\frac{-mb}{m^{2}(a+bT)^{2}} = \\frac{-b}{m(a+bT)^{2}}$$\nNow, we multiply this result by $\\frac{dT}{dq}$:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{-b}{m(a+bT)^{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{m(a+bT)} \\right) = \\frac{-b}{m^{2}(a+bT)^{3}}$$\nThe sign of the curvature is the sign of this second derivative. The mass $m$ is positive, so $m^{2}$ is positive. The absolute temperature $T$ is positive. For any physical substance, the heat capacity $c_{p}(T) = a+bT$ must be positive over the temperature range of interest. Therefore, the entire denominator, $m^{2}(a+bT)^{3}$, is a positive quantity.\nConsequently, the sign of the curvature is determined solely by the sign of the numerator, $-b$.\n- If $b > 0$, the heat capacity increases with temperature. The curvature $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$ is negative. A negative second derivative indicates that the curve is **concave down**. This means that as more heat is added, the temperature increases more slowly (the slope decreases), which is consistent with an increasing heat capacity.\n- If $b  0$, the heat capacity decreases with temperature. The curvature $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$ is positive. A positive second derivative indicates that the curve is **concave up**. This means that as more heat is added, the temperature increases more rapidly (the slope increases), consistent with a decreasing heat capacity.\n- If $b = 0$, the heat capacity is constant. The curvature is zero, and the heating curve $T$ vs. $q$ is a straight line, as expected.\n\nThe temperature dependence of $C_{p}(T)$ manifests as a non-zero curvature in the single-phase heating segment. The sign of the constant $b$ directly determines the sign of this curvature.",

            "problem": "A sample of mass $m$ undergoes a first-order phase transition over a finite temperature interval $[T_a,\\,T_b]$ when heated in a calorimetric setup that enforces a programmed linear temperature ramp $T(t)=T_0+\\beta t$ with constant heating rate $\\beta0$. The heater power $q(t)$ required to maintain the ramp is recorded as a function of $T$. The environment is at a fixed temperature $T_{\\mathrm{env}}$, and parasitic heat exchange between the sample cell and the environment is well described by Newton’s law of cooling with an effective thermal conductance $K$, so that the heat loss term is $K\\,[T(t)-T_{\\mathrm{env}}]$. Outside the transition interval, the specific isobaric heat capacities of the condensed phases are $c_s$ (below $T_a$) and $c_\\ell$ (above $T_b$), which can be taken temperature independent over the narrow window of interest. The latent heat per unit mass is $L$, and the instantaneous transformed fraction is $\\xi(t)$ with $d\\xi/dt\\ge 0$ during heating.\n\nAssume local thermal equilibration within the sample is fast compared to the external ramp so that a single $T(t)$ describes the sample, but the programmed heating rate $\\beta$ and the nonzero conductance $K$ are not negligible. Using energy conservation, the definitions of heat capacity and latent heat, and Newton’s law of cooling, reason from first principles how a finite $\\beta$ and nonzero $K$ distort the ideal heating curve for a first-order transition (which, in the reversible quasi-static and adiabatic limit, would exhibit an isothermal plateau at the transition temperature in a temperature–time trace, and a vertical enthalpy step in an enthalpy–temperature trace). Then, considering that real $q(T)$ traces display a baseline due to sensible heating and heat loss, a common practice (including in Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)) is to determine a baseline by linear fits to $q(T)$ below $T_a$ and above $T_b$ and use it to correct the transition signal.\n\nWhich option best describes both the physical distortions introduced by finite $\\beta$ and $K$ and a scientifically sound baseline-correction procedure that yields $L$ from the recorded $q(T)$ trace using only a baseline determined from the pre- and post-transition regions? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Finite $\\beta$ makes the transition proceed over a finite interval of $T$ with nonzero $d\\xi/dt$, so the ideal $\\delta$-like enthalpy step becomes a broadened peak in the power signal; nonzero $K$ adds a sloping background proportional to $(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$, so $q(T)$ has a linear baseline whose slope is set by $K$. A consistent correction is to determine a linear baseline $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)=a+bT$ by fitting the pre- and post-transition $q(T)$ segments, subtract it from $q(T)$ to isolate the transition contribution, and obtain $L$ by integrating the baseline-corrected signal over $T$ and dividing by $\\beta$, i.e., $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!\\big[q(T)-q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)\\big]\\,dT$.\n\nB. Finite $\\beta$ compresses the temperature scale but does not affect the shape of the transition, and $K$ simply shifts the power trace vertically by a constant; therefore, one should estimate $L$ from the raw $q(T)$ peak area without any baseline subtraction as $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!q(T)\\,dT$.\n\nC. The essential distortion is that $K$ reduces the apparent heating rate $dT/dt$ in proportion to $(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$; therefore, one should compute a baseline on the temperature–time curve $T(t)$ by extending the pre- and post-transition slopes of $T(t)$ across the interval $[T_a,T_b]$, subtract this baseline from $T(t)$, and multiply the area between the curves by $mc_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ (with $c_{\\mathrm{avg}}=(c_s+c_\\ell)/2$) to estimate $L$.\n\nD. Because $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)$ is set only by the sample heat capacity, it is independent of $T$ over the narrow transition window; hence, the appropriate baseline is a constant equal to the mean of the pre- and post-transition $q$ levels, and $L$ follows from $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!\\big[q(T)-\\overline{q}\\big]\\,dT$ with $\\overline{q}$ the constant baseline.\n\nE. Finite $\\beta$ produces thermal lag and broadening of the power peak because $d\\xi/dt$ is finite, and $K$ contributes a linear-in-$T$ baseline to $q(T)$; an equivalent and consistent correction in the time domain is to construct $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)$ from linear fits to the pre- and post-transition $q(T)$ segments, evaluate it along the measured $T(t)$ to obtain $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)=q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T(t))$, subtract it from $q(t)$, and integrate in time to recover $L$ as $L=(1/m)\\int_{t_a}^{t_b}\\!\\big[q(t)-q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)\\big]\\,dt$.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in the first law of thermodynamics, applied as a power balance equation for the sample cell. The power supplied by the heater, $q(t)$, is used to increase the sample's temperature (sensible heat), drive the phase transition (latent heat), and compensate for heat lost to the environment. The equation is:\n$$ q(t) = \\frac{dH}{dt} + q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t) $$\nwhere $H$ is the enthalpy of the sample and $q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t)$ is the rate of heat loss.\n\nThe total enthalpy $H$ is a function of temperature $T$ and the transformed fraction $\\xi$.

During the transition, the sample is a mixture of two phases, so $c_p(T, \\xi) = (1-\\xi)c_s + \\xi c_\\ell$, where $c_s$ and $c_\\ell$ are the specific heat capacities of the solid and liquid phases, respectively.

The heat loss follows Newton's law, $q_{\\mathrm{loss}}(t) = K[T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{env}}]$.\n\nSubstituting these into the power balance equation gives:\n$$ q(t) = m \\big( (1-\\xi)c_s + \\xi c_\\ell \\big) \\beta + m L \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} + K \\big( T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{env}} \\big) $$\nThis equation describes the measured power signal $q(t)$ at any time $t$. We can analyze it in three distinct regions:\n\n1.  **Pre-transition region ($T  T_a$)**: Here, the sample is entirely in the condensed phase. Thus, $\\xi = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n    $$ q(t) = m c_s \\beta + K \\big( T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{env}} \\big) $$\n    Since $T(t)$ is a linear function of time, $q(t)$ is also linear in time. Expressed as a function of temperature $T$, the signal is:\n    $$ q(T) = m c_s \\beta + K (T - T_{\\mathrm{env}}) = (m c_s \\beta - K T_{\\mathrm{env}}) + K T $$\n    This is a linear function of $T$ with a slope equal to the thermal conductance $K$.\n\n2.  **Post-transition region ($T  T_b$)**: Here, the sample is entirely in the new phase. Thus, $\\xi = 1$ and $\\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = 0$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ q(t) = m c_\\ell \\beta + K \\big( T(t) - T_{\\mathrm{env}} \\big) $$\n    As a function of temperature $T$:\n    $$ q(T) = m c_\\ell \\beta + K (T - T_{\\mathrm{env}}) = (m c_\\ell \\beta - K T_{\\mathrm{env}}) + K T $$\n    This is also a linear function of $T$ with the same slope $K$. However, the intercept is different from the pre-transition region due to the change in specific heat capacity from $c_s$ to $c_\\ell$. The baseline exhibits a step of magnitude $m(c_\\ell - c_s)\\beta$.\n\n3.  **Transition region ($T_a \\le T \\le T_b$)**: In this interval, $\\xi$ changes from $0$ to $1$, so $\\frac{d\\xi}{dt}  0$. The full equation applies. The term $m L \\frac{d\\xi}{dt}$ represents the additional power required to supply the latent heat. Since the transition occurs over a finite time due to the finite heating rate $\\beta  0$, this term creates a peak in the power signal, superimposed on the baseline. The finite rate $\\beta$ causes kinetic broadening of the transition, which would be an infinitely sharp (isothermal) event only in the quasi-static limit ($\\beta \\to 0$). The non-zero conductance $K$ introduces a sloped baseline proportional to $T$.\n\nTo determine the latent heat $L$, one must isolate the energy associated with the transition. This is done by subtracting a baseline signal, $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)$, that represents the power that would have been measured in the absence of the latent heat effect. The latent heat contribution to the total energy supplied is the integral of the excess power:\n$$ m L = \\int_{t_a}^{t_b} \\left( q(t) - q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t) \\right) dt $$\nwhere $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)$ accounts for the sensible heat and heat loss terms. A proper baseline should account for the change in heat capacity from $c_s$ to $c_\\ell$. A common and scientifically sound, though approximate, procedure is to construct a baseline by interpolating between the pre-transition and post-transition signal traces. This baseline $q_{\\mathrm{base}}$ is then subtracted from the measured signal $q(t)$, and the area of the resulting peak is calculated.\n\nThe integral can be transformed from the time domain to the temperature domain using the relation $dT = \\beta dt$, which implies $dt = \\frac{dT}{\\beta}$.\n$$ m L = \\int_{T_a}^{T_b} \\left( q(T) - q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T) \\right) \\frac{dT}{\\beta} $$\n$$ L = \\frac{1}{m\\beta} \\int_{T_a}^{T_b} \\left( q(T) - q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T) \\right) dT $$\nThis provides the theoretical foundation for analyzing the options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Finite $\\beta$ makes the transition proceed over a finite interval of $T$ with nonzero $d\\xi/dt$, so the ideal $\\delta$-like enthalpy step becomes a broadened peak in the power signal; nonzero $K$ adds a sloping background proportional to $(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$, so $q(T)$ has a linear baseline whose slope is set by $K$. A consistent correction is to determine a linear baseline $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)=a+bT$ by fitting the pre- and post-transition $q(T)$ segments, subtract it from $q(T)$ to isolate the transition contribution, and obtain $L$ by integrating the baseline-corrected signal over $T$ and dividing by $\\beta$, i.e., $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!\\big[q(T)-q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)\\big]\\,dT$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the physical effects. Finite $\\beta$ causes kinetic broadening of the transition peak. Nonzero $K$ causes a sloping, linear-in-$T$ component in the baseline. The procedure described, constructing a linear baseline, subtracting it, and integrating, is a standard method in calorimetry. The formula provided for $L$ is correct based on the change of variables from the time integral. The description of the baseline as a single linear function $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)=a+bT$ is a simplification of the true baseline which has a step in it, but it reflects a common practical approach. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Finite $\\beta$ compresses the temperature scale but does not affect the shape of the transition, and $K$ simply shifts the power trace vertically by a constant; therefore, one should estimate $L$ from the raw $q(T)$ peak area without any baseline subtraction as $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!q(T)\\,dT$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. Finite $\\beta$ is the primary reason for the peak's shape and broadening, not a simple \"compression\". The contribution from $K$ is $K(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$, which is linear in $T$, creating a sloped baseline, not a constant vertical shift. Finally, integrating the raw signal $q(T)$ without baseline subtraction would erroneously include the sensible heat and heat loss contributions, leading to a gross overestimation of $L$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The essential distortion is that $K$ reduces the apparent heating rate $dT/dt$ in proportion to $(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$; therefore, one should compute a baseline on the temperature–time curve $T(t)$ by extending the pre- and post-transition slopes of $T(t)$ across the interval $[T_a,T_b]$, subtract this baseline from $T(t)$, and multiply the area between the curves by $mc_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ (with $c_{\\mathrm{avg}}=(c_s+c_\\ell)/2$) to estimate $L$.**\nThis statement fundamentally misunderstands the problem setup. The problem specifies a \"programmed linear temperature ramp $T(t)=T_0+\\beta t$,\" which means the control system actively adjusts the power $q(t)$ to ensure that the sample's heating rate $dT/dt$ is constant and equal to $\\beta$. The heat loss $K(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$ does not reduce $dT/dt$; it increases the required power $q(t)$. The proposed procedure of manipulating the $T(t)$ curve, which is a straight line by definition, is nonsensical and has no physical basis for calculating $L$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)$ is set only by the sample heat capacity, it is independent of $T$ over the narrow transition window; hence, the appropriate baseline is a constant equal to the mean of the pre- and post-transition $q$ levels, and $L$ follows from $L=(1/m\\beta)\\int_{T_a}^{T_b}\\!\\big[q(T)-\\overline{q}\\big]\\,dT$ with $\\overline{q}$ the constant baseline.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The baseline power, $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)$, is determined by both the sample heat capacity ($m c \\beta$) and the heat loss to the environment ($K(T-T_{\\mathrm{env}})$). Since $K$ is non-zero, the baseline is explicitly dependent on temperature $T$. A constant (horizontal) baseline would only be valid if $K=0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Finite $\\beta$ produces thermal lag and broadening of the power peak because $d\\xi/dt$ is finite, and $K$ contributes a linear-in-$T$ baseline to $q(T)$; an equivalent and consistent correction in the time domain is to construct $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T)$ from linear fits to the pre- and post-transition $q(T)$ segments, evaluate it along the measured $T(t)$ to obtain $q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)=q_{\\mathrm{base}}(T(t))$, subtract it from $q(t)$, and integrate in time to recover $L$ as $L=(1/m)\\int_{t_a}^{t_b}\\!\\big[q(t)-q_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)\\big]\\,dt$.**\nThe physical description of distortions (\"thermal lag and broadening\") is accurate and insightful. The effect of $K$ is also correctly identified. The proposed procedure is an integration in the time domain. As shown in the initial derivation, this formulation is mathematically equivalent to the temperature-domain integration in option A via the variable substitution $dT = \\beta dt$. Therefore, this option presents an equally valid description of the physics and a sound, equivalent procedure for calculating $L$. **Correct**.",
