            "solution": "The problem presented requires the derivation of a thermodynamic relation for a two-phase system at equilibrium, followed by a numerical calculation. The problem is chemically and physically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. It is a standard exercise in chemical thermodynamics. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium between two phases, in this case liquid ($\\ell$) and vapor ($v$), of a pure substance is the equality of their chemical potentials, $\\mu$. For a pure substance, the chemical potential is identical to the molar Gibbs free energy, $G_m$. Therefore, at any point $(T, P)$ along the coexistence curve, we have:\n$$G_{m,\\ell}(T, P) = G_{m,v}(T, P)$$\nIf we move along the coexistence curve by infinitesimal amounts $\\mathrm{d}T$ and $\\mathrm{d}P$, the condition of equilibrium must still hold:\n$$G_{m,\\ell}(T+\\mathrm{d}T, P+\\mathrm{d}P) = G_{m,v}(T+\\mathrm{d}T, P+\\mathrm{d}P)$$\nExpanding these terms to first order gives $G_{m,\\ell} + \\mathrm{d}G_{m,\\ell} = G_{m,v} + \\mathrm{d}G_{m,v}$. Given the initial equality, it necessarily follows that the differentials must also be equal:\n$$\\mathrm{d}G_{m,\\ell} = \\mathrm{d}G_{m,v}$$\nThe problem requires that we start from the fundamental differential of the molar Gibbs free energy, which is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{d}G_m = V_m \\mathrm{d}P - S_m \\mathrm{d}T$$\nHere, $V_m$ is the molar volume and $S_m$ is the molar entropy. Applying this relation to both the liquid and vapor phases, we obtain:\n$$V_{m,\\ell} \\mathrm{d}P - S_{m,\\ell} \\mathrm{d}T = V_{m,v} \\mathrm{d}P - S_{m,v} \\mathrm{d}T$$\nWe rearrange this equation to separate the terms in $\\mathrm{d}T$ and $\\mathrm{d}P$:\n$$(S_{m,v} - S_{m,\\ell}) \\mathrm{d}T = (V_{m,v} - V_{m,\\ell}) \\mathrm{d}P$$\nLet $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{vap}} = S_{m,v} - S_{m,\\ell}$ be the molar entropy of vaporization and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{vap}} = V_{m,v} - V_{m,\\ell}$ be the molar volume change of vaporization. The equation becomes:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{vap}} \\mathrm{d}T = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{vap}} \\mathrm{d}P$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the slope $\\mathrm{d}T/\\mathrm{d}P$. We obtain this by rearranging the above:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}P} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{vap}}}$$\nFor a phase transition at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy is zero, i.e., $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 0$. From the definition $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, we have $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 0$, which implies that the molar entropy of vaporization can be expressed as:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{vap}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{T}$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is the molar enthalpy of vaporization. Substituting this into our expression for the slope gives the Clapeyron equation, arranged as requested:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}P} = \\frac{T \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}} = \\frac{T (V_{m,v} - V_{m,\\ell})}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the slope of the liquid–vapor coexistence curve.\n\nNext, we apply the specified approximations to evaluate this expression at the given operating point.\n1. The vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas: $P V_{m,v} = RT$, so $V_{m,v} = \\frac{RT}{P}$.\n2. The molar volume of the liquid is negligible compared to that of the vapor: $V_{m,\\ell} \\ll V_{m,v}$. This implies $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{vap}} = V_{m,v} - V_{m,\\ell} \\approx V_{m,v}$.\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the derived equation yields the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}P} \\approx \\frac{T \\cdot V_{m,v}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}} \\approx \\frac{T \\cdot (\\frac{RT}{P})}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}} = \\frac{RT^2}{P \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}$$\nWe are asked to compute the temperature change, $\\Delta T$, for a small pressure increase, $\\Delta P = 100$ mbar. For a small change, we can use a linear approximation:\n$$\\Delta T \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}P}\\right) \\Delta P$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for the slope.

            "solution": "The problem posed is a standard exercise in chemical thermodynamics and is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It contains all necessary data for a unique solution. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe solution is structured to address the five parts of the problem statement in sequential order.\n\nFirst, we derive the differential relation governing liquid-vapor equilibrium.\nThe condition for phase equilibrium between a pure liquid (phase l) and its vapor (phase v) is the equality of their chemical potentials, $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{l}}(T, P) = \\mu_{\\text{v}}(T, P)\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature and $P$ is the pressure. Along the coexistence curve, any infinitesimal change $dT$ in temperature and $dP$ in pressure must maintain this equality. Thus, the differentials of the chemical potentials must also be equal:\n$$\nd\\mu_{\\text{l}} = d\\mu_{\\text{v}}\n$$\nThe fundamental Gibbs-Duhem equation for a pure substance gives the differential of the chemical potential as $d\\mu = -S_m dT + V_m dP$, where $S_m$ is the molar entropy and $V_m$ is the molar volume. Applying this to both phases yields:\n$$\n-S_{m,\\text{l}} dT + V_{m,\\text{l}} dP = -S_{m,\\text{v}} dT + V_{m,\\text{v}} dP\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the slope of the coexistence curve, $\\frac{dP}{dT}$, gives:\n$$\n(V_{m,\\text{v}} - V_{m,\\text{l}}) dP = (S_{m,\\text{v}} - S_{m,\\text{l}}) dT\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{S_{m,\\text{v}} - S_{m,\\text{l}}}{V_{m,\\text{v}} - V_{m,\\text{l}}} = \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\text{vap}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{vap}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta S_{\\text{vap}}$ is the molar entropy of vaporization and $\\Delta V_{\\text{vap}}$ is the molar volume change upon vaporization. For a reversible phase transition at equilibrium, the entropy change is related to the enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$, by $\\Delta S_{\\text{vap}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{T}$. Substituting this gives the exact Clapeyron equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{T \\Delta V_{\\text{vap}}}\n$$\nTo obtain a relation in terms of measurable quantities suitable for this problem, we introduce two standard approximations.\nAssumption $1$: The molar volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the molar volume of the vapor ($V_{m,\\text{l}} \\ll V_{m,\\text{v}}$). This is physically justified because the density of a gas is typically much lower than that of its condensed phase, especially at pressures well below the critical pressure. Therefore, $\\Delta V_{\\text{vap}} = V_{m,\\text{v}} - V_{m,\\text{l}} \\approx V_{m,\\text{v}}$.\nAssumption $2$: The vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas. The physical basis for this is that at the given pressures ($18.35$ kPa and $45.90$ kPa, both significantly less than $1$ atm), intermolecular forces in the gas phase are weak. Thus, the ideal gas law applies, and the molar volume of the vapor is $V_{m,\\text{v}} \\approx \\frac{RT}{P}$.\nSubstituting these two approximations into the Clapeyron equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{T (\\frac{RT}{P})} = \\frac{P \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into the final required differential form, known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we integrate this differential relation. The problem states to assume that $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ is constant over the temperature interval from $T_1$ to $T_2$. We separate the variables in the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$\nd(\\ln P) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\frac{dT}{T^2}\n$$\nWe then perform a definite integration between the two measured equilibrium points $(T_1, P_1)$ and $(T_2, P_2)$:\n$$\n\\int_{P_1}^{P_2} d(\\ln P) = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{RT^2} dT\n$$\nWith $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ and $R$ being constants, the right side becomes $\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} T^{-2} dT$. Evaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln P]_{P_1}^{P_2} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\left[-\\frac{1}{T}\\right]_{T_1}^{T_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_2) - \\ln(P_1) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\left(\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ provides the explicit two-point formula:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)} = R \\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the best estimate of $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$. We use the central values of the given data:\n$T_1 = 305.00$ K, $P_1 = 18.35$ kPa\n$T_2 = 325.00$ K, $P_2 = 45.90$ kPa\n$R = 8.314462618$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\nThe pressure units cancel in the ratio $P_2/P_1$, so no conversion is necessary.\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = (8.314462618 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}) \\frac{(305.00 \\text{ K})(325.00 \\text{ K})}{325.00 \\text{ K} - 305.00 \\text{ K}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{45.90 \\text{ kPa}}{18.35 \\text{ kPa}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = (8.314462618) \\frac{99125}{20.00} \\ln(2.501362397...) \\text{ J mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = (8.314462618)(4956.25)(0.91683038) \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\approx 37788.63 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFourth, we propagate the uncertainties.

Rounding to two significant figures gives $0.28$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.\n\nThus, the final result is $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = 37.79 \\pm 0.28$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.\nThe final answer must be a pair of numbers representing the best estimate and its standard uncertainty, both in kJ mol$^{-1}$.",
