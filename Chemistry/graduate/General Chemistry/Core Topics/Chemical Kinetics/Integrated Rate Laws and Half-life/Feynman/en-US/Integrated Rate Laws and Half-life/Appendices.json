            "solution": "The problem statement poses a standard exercise in chemical kinetics, requiring the derivation and comparison of integrated rate laws for first-order and second-order reactions. I will validate the problem first and then proceed to the solution by a systematic derivation from first principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- **Reaction:** A single-reactant, isothermal, constant-volume decomposition $A \\rightarrow \\text{products}$.\n- **Rate Law:** $-\\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k [A]^n$, with rate constant $k>0$.\n- **Reaction Order:** The order $n$ is an integer, $n \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n- **Conditions:** No reverse reaction, no side reactions.\n- **Initial Condition:** Concentration at $t=0$ is $[A]_0$.\n- **Definition of Half-Life:** $[A](t_{1/2}) = \\dfrac{[A]_0}{2}$.\n- **Objective:** For both $n=1$ and $n=2$, identify the correct linearizing plot (transformed ordinate vs. $t$), the corresponding slope in terms of $k$, and the dependence of $t_{1/2}$ on $[A]_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics. The rate law $-\\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k [A]^n$ is a cornerstone of the field. The provided conditions (isothermal, constant volume, no side reactions) are standard simplifying assumptions for deriving integrated rate laws. The problem is well-posed; it asks for the derivation of standard, unique results for elementary reaction orders. The language is objective and precise. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the differential rate law for the specified integer orders $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\n**Case 1: First-Order Reaction ($n=1$)**\n\nThe rate law is given by:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]$$\nThis is a separable first-order differential equation. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $[A]$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -k \\, dt$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The concentration ranges from the initial value $[A]_0$ at time $t=0$ to $[A]$ at time $t$.\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} \\frac{1}{[A']} \\, d[A'] = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the definite integration yields:\n$$[\\ln[A']]_{[A]_0}^{[A]} = [-kt']_0^t$$\n$$\\ln[A] - \\ln[A]_0 = -kt$$\nThis equation is the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction. To identify the linear plot, we rearrange it into the form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$:\n$$\\ln[A] = -kt + \\ln[A]_0$$\nFrom this form, it is evident that a plot of $y = \\ln[A]$ versus $x = t$ will produce a straight line.\n- **Linearizing Plot:** $\\ln[A]$ versus $t$.\n- **Slope:** The slope of this line is $m = -k$. As $k>0$ is given, the slope is negative.\n\nTo find the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, we use its definition: at $t = t_{1/2}$, $[A] = [A]_0/2$. Substituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[A]_0}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} + \\ln[A]_0$$\n$$\\ln[A]_0 - \\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} + \\ln[A]_0$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n- **Half-Life Dependence:** The expression for $t_{1/2}$ does not contain the term $[A]_0$. Therefore, the half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of the initial concentration.\n\n**Case 2: Second-Order Reaction ($n=2$)**\n\nThe rate law is:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^2$$\nAgain, this is a separable differential equation. We rearrange and integrate:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]^2} = -k \\, dt$$\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} [A']^{-2} \\, d[A'] = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\\left[-\\frac{1}{[A']}\\right]_{[A]_0}^{[A]} = [-kt']_0^t$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{[A]_0}\\right) = -kt$$\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0} - \\frac{1}{[A]} = -kt$$\nTo achieve the linear form $y=mx+b$, we rearrange:\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]} = kt + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\nThis equation shows that a plot of $y = 1/[A]$ versus $x = t$ will be a straight line.\n- **Linearizing Plot:** $1/[A]$ versus $t$.\n- **Slope:** The slope of this line is $m = +k$. As $k>0$, the slope is positive.\n\nTo find the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, we substitute $[A] = [A]_0/2$ at $t = t_{1/2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0/2} = k t_{1/2} + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\n$$\\frac{2}{[A]_0} = k t_{1/2} + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0} = k t_{1/2}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k[A]_0}$$\n- **Half-Life Dependence:** The half-life for a second-order reaction is inversely proportional to the initial concentration, $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]_0$. Consequently, if the initial concentration is changed from $[A]_0$ to $f[A]_0$, the new half-life will be scaled by a factor of $1/f$.\n\n### Option Evaluation\n\nI will now evaluate each option against these derived results.\n\n**A.** First-order: plot $\\ln [A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is correct. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is incorrect; the slope must be $+k$. Half-life: independent for both orders. This is incorrect for the second-order case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B.** First-order: plot $[A]$ versus $t$. This is incorrect; this plot is linear for a zero-order reaction, not first-order. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $+k$. This is correct. Half-life: independent for both orders. This is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** First-order: plot $\\ln [A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is correct. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $+k$. This is correct. Half-life: for first-order, $t_{1/2}$ is independent of $[A]_0$; for second-order, $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]_0$. This is correct. All parts of this option are consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly swaps the kinetic characteristics of first-order and second-order reactions. The plot for first-order is given as $1/[A]$ vs $t$, and for second-order as $\\ln[A]$ vs $t$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** First-order: plot $\\log_{10}[A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is incorrect. A plot of $\\log_{10}[A]$ versus $t$ is indeed linear, but its slope is not $-k$. Using the relation $\\ln[A] = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A]$, the integrated rate law becomes $\\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A] = -kt + \\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A]_0$. This gives $\\log_{10}[A] = (-k/\\ln(10))t + \\log_{10}[A]_0$. The slope is $-k/\\ln(10)$, or approximately $-k/2.303$, not $-k$. The remainder of the option is correct, but this first part renders it invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the kinetics for both reaction orders is C.",

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in chemical kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the fundamental definitions. We first express the concentration of reactant $\\mathrm{A}$, denoted $[A]$, in terms of the fractional conversion, $X$. The definition is:\n$$X = \\frac{[A]_{0} - [A]}{[A]_{0}}$$\nRearranging this expression for $[A]$ yields:\n$$[A] = [A]_{0} (1 - X)$$\nTo relate this to the rate law, we must find the time derivative of $[A]$.

Substituting $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = [A]_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}X}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ and $[A]^{2} = [A]_{0}^{2}(1-X)^{2}$, we obtain:\n$$[A]_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}X}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k [A]_{0}^{2} (1-X)^{2}$$\nThis is a differential equation for $X(t)$. We simplify and separate the variables to prepare for integration:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X}{(1-X)^{2}} = k [A]_{0} \\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state ($t=0$, where $X=0$) to a final state (time $t$, where conversion is $X$):\n$$\\int_{0}^{X} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}X'}{(1-X')^{2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} k [A]_{0} \\,\\mathrm{d}t'$$\nThe left-hand side integral is $\\left[ \\frac{1}{1-X'} \\right]_{0}^{X} = \\frac{1}{1-X} - \\frac{1}{1-0} = \\frac{1}{1-X} - 1 = \\frac{X}{1-X}$. The right-hand side integral is $k [A]_{0} t$. Equating the results gives the integrated rate law in terms of fractional conversion:\n$$\\frac{X}{1-X} = k [A]_{0} t$$\nWe solve for the time $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{k[A]_{0}} \\left( \\frac{X}{1-X} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $k = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, $[A]_{0} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{M}$, and $X = 0.75$.\n$$t = \\frac{1}{(0.25)(0.010)} \\left( \\frac{0.75}{1-0.75} \\right) = \\frac{1}{0.0025} \\left( \\frac{0.75}{0.25} \\right) = (400) \\cdot (3) = 1200\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNext, we must verify this result using the standard integrated rate law that relates $[A]$ to $t$.

We substitute this into the integrated rate law:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{C_0/2}{C_0}\\right) = -\\int_0^{t_{1/2}} k(\\tau) d\\tau $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) = -\\int_0^{t_{1/2}} k(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nThis yields the fundamental criterion for determining the half-time $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\int_0^{t_{1/2}} k(\\tau) d\\tau = \\ln(2) $$\nThis equation is the foundation for finding the analytical value of $t_{1/2}$ in all test cases.\n\n**Part 2: Analytical Half-Time Equations for Test Cases**\n\nFor each case, we first evaluate the definite integral $\\int_0^t k(\\tau)d\\tau$.\n\n**Case 1: $k(t) = k_0 + a\\,t$**\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\int_0^t (k_0 + a\\tau)d\\tau = \\left[ k_0\\tau + \\dfrac{1}{2}a\\tau^2 \\right]_0^t = k_0t + \\dfrac{1}{2}at^2 $$\nSetting $t=t_{1/2}$ and equating to $\\ln(2)$ gives a quadratic equation for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{2}a t_{1/2}^2 + k_0 t_{1/2} - \\ln(2) = 0 $$\nThe physically meaningful solution must be positive, so we take the positive root of the quadratic formula:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\dfrac{-k_0 + \\sqrt{k_0^2 - 4(\\frac{1}{2}a)(-\\ln(2))}}{a} = \\dfrac{-k_0 + \\sqrt{k_0^2 + 2a\\ln(2)}}{a} $$\n\n**Case 2: $k(t) = k_0e^{-bt}$**\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\int_0^t k_0e^{-b\\tau}d\\tau = k_0 \\left[ -\\dfrac{1}{b}e^{-b\\tau} \\right]_0^t = -\\dfrac{k_0}{b}(e^{-bt} - e^0) = \\dfrac{k_0}{b}(1 - e^{-bt}) $$\nSetting $t=t_{1/2}$ and equating to $\\ln(2)$ yields:\n$$ \\dfrac{k_0}{b}(1 - e^{-bt_{1/2}}) = \\ln(2) $$\nThis equation is solved for $t_{1/2}$ through algebraic manipulation:\n$$ 1 - e^{-bt_{1/2}} = \\dfrac{b\\ln(2)}{k_0} \\implies e^{-bt_{1/2}} = 1 - \\dfrac{b\\ln(2)}{k_0} $$\n$$ -bt_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\dfrac{b\\ln(2)}{k_0}\\right) \\implies t_{1/2} = -\\dfrac{1}{b}\\ln\\left(1 - \\dfrac{b\\ln(2)}{k_0}\\right) $$\n\n**Case 3: $k(t) = k_0 + A\\sin(\\omega t)$**\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\int_0^t (k_0 + A\\sin(\\omega\\tau))d\\tau = \\left[ k_0\\tau - \\dfrac{A}{\\omega}\\cos(\\omega\\tau) \\right]_0^t = \\left( k_0t - \\dfrac{A}{\\omega}\\cos(\\omega t) \\right) - \\left( 0 - \\dfrac{A}{\\omega}\\cos(0) \\right) = k_0t - \\dfrac{A}{\\omega}\\cos(\\omega t) + \\dfrac{A}{\\omega} $$\nSetting $t=t_{1/2}$ and equating to $\\ln(2)$ produces a transcendental equation:\n$$ k_0t_{1/2} - \\dfrac{A}{\\omega}\\cos(\\omega t_{1/2}) + \\dfrac{A}{\\omega} - \\ln(2) = 0 $$\nThis equation does not have a simple algebraic solution for $t_{1/2}$ and must be solved using a numerical root-finding algorithm.\n\n**Case 4: Piecewise-constant $k(t)$**\nThe integral depends on whether $t$ is less than or greater than $t_s$. First, we must determine if $t_{1/2}$ is less than or greater than $t_s$ by evaluating the integral at $t=t_s$:\n$$ \\int_0^{t_s} k(\\tau)d\\tau = \\int_0^{t_s} k_1 d\\tau = k_1t_s $$\nIf $k_1t_s  \\ln(2)$, then $t_{1/2}  t_s$. The equation for $t_{1/2}$ is $k_1t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)$, so $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_1$.\nIf $k_1t_s \\le \\ln(2)$, then $t_{1/2} \\ge t_s$. The integral is split at $t_s$:\n$$ \\int_0^{t_{1/2}} k(\\tau)d\\tau = \\int_0^{t_s} k_1 d\\tau + \\int_{t_s}^{t_{1/2}} k_2 d\\tau = k_1t_s + k_2(t_{1/2} - t_s) $$\nSetting this equal to $\\ln(2)$ gives a linear equation for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ k_1t_s + k_2(t_{1/2} - t_s) = \\ln(2) \\implies t_{1/2} = t_s + \\dfrac{\\ln(2) - k_1t_s}{k_2} $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Solution Scheme**\nThe numerical solution for the ODE $dC/dt = f(t,C) = -k(t)C$ is obtained using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. Given the state $(t_n, C_n)$, the state at the next time step, $(t_n+\\Delta t, C_{n+1})$, is calculated as:\n$$ C_{n+1} = C_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{6}(s_1 + 2s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4) $$\nwhere the slopes $s_i$ are:\n$$ s_1 = f(t_n, C_n) = -k(t_n)C_n $$\n$$ s_2 = f\\left(t_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}, C_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}s_1\\right) = -k\\left(t_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right)\\left(C_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}s_1\\right) $$\n$$ s_3 = f\\left(t_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}, C_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}s_2\\right) = -k\\left(t_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right)\\left(C_n + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{2}s_2\\right) $$\n$$ s_4 = f(t_n + \\Delta t, C_n + \\Delta t s_3) = -k(t_n + \\Delta t)(C_n + \\Delta t s_3) $$\nStarting from $(t_0, C_0)=(0, 1.0)$, the time-marching proceeds with a fixed step $\\Delta t = 10^{-4}$ s until the concentration crosses the threshold $C_0/2 = 0.5$. This occurs when $C_n \\ge 0.5$ and $C_{n+1}  0.5$. The two points $(t_n, C_n)$ and $(t_{n+1}, C_{n+1})$ then bracket the half-time.\n\nThe numerical half-time, $\\widehat{t}_{1/2}$, is estimated by linear interpolation between these two points. We solve for $\\widehat{t}_{1/2}$ in the equation for the line passing through $(t_n, C_n)$ and $(t_{n+1}, C_{n+1})$ at the point where the concentration is $0.5$:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\widehat{t}_{1/2} - t_n}{t_{n+1} - t_n} = \\dfrac{0.5 - C_n}{C_{n+1} - C_n} $$\nRecognizing that $t_{n+1} - t_n = \\Delta t$, we find:\n$$ \\widehat{t}_{1/2} = t_n + \\Delta t \\left(\\dfrac{0.5 - C_n}{C_{n+1} - C_n}\\right) $$\nThe final task is to compute the absolute difference $|\\widehat{t}_{1/2} - t_{1/2}|$ for each of the four cases.",
