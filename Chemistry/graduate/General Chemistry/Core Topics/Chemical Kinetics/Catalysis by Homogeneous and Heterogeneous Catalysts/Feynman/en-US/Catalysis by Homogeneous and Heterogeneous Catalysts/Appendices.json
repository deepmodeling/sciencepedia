            "introduction": "A central goal in catalysis research is to elucidate reaction mechanisms in order to design more efficient catalysts. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a powerful experimental tool used to probe the rate-determining step of a reaction. This practice  demonstrates how comparing the reaction rates of a substrate and its isotopically labeled counterpart (e.g., replacing hydrogen with deuterium) can provide strong evidence for whether a specific bond is broken in the slowest step of the catalytic cycle.",

A proposed mechanism for this catalytic cycle involves the cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond in cyclohexane as the rate-determining step.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, two kinetic experiments are performed at a constant temperature of 298 K. In both experiments, the initial concentrations of the catalyst, oxidant, and cyclohexane substrate are identical. The reaction is determined to be first-order with respect to the concentration of the cyclohexane substrate.\n\nIn Experiment 1, standard, non-deuterated cyclohexane is used. The initial rate of reaction is measured to be $8.54 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M/s}$.\n\nIn Experiment 2, perdeuterated cyclohexane ($\\text{C}_6\\text{D}_{12}$), where every hydrogen atom has been replaced by its isotope deuterium, is used instead. The initial rate of reaction is measured to be $1.31 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M/s}$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and choose the statement that correctly interprets its significance for the proposed mechanism.\n\nA.
