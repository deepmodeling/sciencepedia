The method of pseudo-orders is an elegant experimental design that simplifies this challenge by using a large excess of one reactant to hold its concentration effectively constant, thereby isolating the kinetic influence of the other. This practice  will guide you through the analysis of data from such an experiment, reinforcing your ability to linearize complex rate laws and extract a true bimolecular rate constant, $k$, from the measured pseudo-first-order constants, $k'$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the reaction order with respect to reactant $\\mathrm{B}$ and the bimolecular rate constant $k$ for the reaction $\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\to \\text{products}$. We will begin by validating the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\n- Reaction: $\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\to \\text{products}$\n- Temperature is constant.\n- The reaction rate is established to be first order in $\\mathrm{A}$.\n- A series of pseudo-first-order experiments are conducted where the concentration of $\\mathrm{B}$, denoted $\\mathrm{[B]}_0$, is held in large excess and is effectively constant.\n- The proposed general rate law is $\\text{rate} = k\\,\\mathrm{[A]}\\,\\mathrm{[B]}^{n}$.\n- Experimental data pairs of $(\\mathrm{[B]}_0, k')$ are provided:\n    - $(\\mathrm{0.0400\\ M, 4.98\\ s^{-1}})$\n    - $(\\mathrm{0.0800\\ M, 9.96\\ s^{-1}})$\n    - $(\\mathrm{0.200\\ M, 24.9\\ s^{-1}})$\n    - $(\\mathrm{0.500\\ M, 62.3\\ s^{-1}})$\n- The task is to find the order $n$ and the rate constant $k$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing the standard method of pseudo-orders to simplify a multi-reactant rate law analysis. It is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent data to determine the two unknown parameters, $n$ and $k$. The language is objective and precise. The data are physically plausible for a bimolecular reaction in solution. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. We proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe general rate law for the reaction is given as:\n$$\n\\text{rate} = k\\,[\\mathrm{A}]\\,[\\mathrm{B}]^{n}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the true bimolecular rate constant, and $n$ is the order of reaction with respect to reactant $\\mathrm{B}$.\n\nThe problem states that experiments are conducted under pseudo-first-order conditions, where the concentration of $\\mathrm{B}$ is much greater than the concentration of $\\mathrm{A}$. Consequently, during the course of the reaction, $\\mathrm{[B]}$ remains effectively constant and equal to its initial concentration, $\\mathrm{[B]}_0$. We can thus absorb the term involving $\\mathrm{[B]}$ into a new, apparent rate constant, $k'$.\n\nThe rate law can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\text{rate} = \\left( k\\,[\\mathrm{B}]_0^{n} \\right) [\\mathrm{A}]\n$$\nThis is the form of a first-order rate law, $\\text{rate} = k'\\,[\\mathrm{A}]$, where the pseudo-first-order rate constant $k'$ is defined as:\n$$\nk' = k\\,[\\mathrm{B}]_0^{n}\n$$\nThis equation provides the relationship between the experimentally measured $k'$ values and the initial concentrations $\\mathrm{[B]}_0$. Our goal is to determine $n$ and $k$ from the provided data.\n\nTo find the order $n$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation relating $k'$ and $\\mathrm{[B]}_0$:\n$$\n\\ln(k') = \\ln(k\\,[\\mathrm{B}]_0^{n})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(k') = \\ln(k) + \\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_0^{n})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(k') = \\ln(k) + n \\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_0)\n$$\nThis equation has the linear form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\ln(k')$, $x = \\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_0)$, the slope is $m = n$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\ln(k)$. We can determine the slope $n$ by using any two data points. Let us use the first two experimental runs.\n\nLet data point $1$ be $(\\mathrm{[B]}_{0,1}, k'_1) = (0.0400, 4.98)$ and data point $2$ be $(\\mathrm{[B]}_{0,2}, k'_2) = (0.0800, 9.96)$.\nWe have two equations:\n$$\n\\ln(k'_1) = \\ln(k) + n \\ln([\\mathrm{B]}_{0,1})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(k'_2) = \\ln(k) + n \\ln([\\mathrm{B]}_{0,2})\n$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second yields:\n$$\n\\ln(k'_2) - \\ln(k'_1) = n (\\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_{0,2}) - \\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_{0,1}))\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{k'_2}{k'_1}\\right) = n \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_{0,2}}{[\\mathrm{B}]_{0,1}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\ln(k'_2 / k'_1)}{\\ln([\\mathrm{B}]_{0,2} / [\\mathrm{B}]_{0,1})}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values from the first two experiments:\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\ln(9.96 / 4.98)}{\\ln(0.0800 / 0.0400)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(2)} = 1\n$$\nWe can verify this result using the second and third data points: $(\\mathrm{[B]}_{0,2}, k'_2) = (0.0800, 9.96)$ and $(\\mathrm{[B]}_{0,3}, k'_3) = (0.200, 24.9)$.\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\ln(24.9 / 9.96)}{\\ln(0.200 / 0.0800)} = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{\\ln(2.5)} = 1\n$$\nThe calculations consistently yield $n=1$. Therefore, the reaction is first order with respect to $\\mathrm{B}$. To three significant figures, $n = 1.00$.\n\nNow that the order $n$ is known to be $1$, the rate law is $\\text{rate} = k\\,[\\mathrm{A}]\\,[\\mathrm{B}]$. The relationship between $k'$ and $\\mathrm{[B]}_0$ simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$$\nk' = k\\,[\\mathrm{B}]_0\n$$\nWe can determine the bimolecular rate constant $k$ by rearranging this equation:\n$$\nk = \\frac{k'}{[\\mathrm{B}]_0}\n$$\nWe will calculate $k$ for each experimental run and then determine the best value.\nRun 1: $k = \\frac{4.98\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.0400\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 124.5\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nRun 2: $k = \\frac{9.96\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.0800\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 124.5\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nRun 3: $k = \\frac{24.9\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.200\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 124.5\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nRun 4: $k = \\frac{62.3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.500\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 124.6\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculated values of $k$ are highly consistent, differing only slightly due to rounding in the provided experimental data. The average of these four values is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{124.5 + 124.5 + 124.5 + 124.6}{4} = \\frac{498.1}{4} = 124.525\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding this value to three significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$\nk = 125\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThus, the determined parameters are $n = 1.00$ and $k = 125\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and heterogeneous catalysis, specifically the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) formalism. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for both the analytical derivation and the numerical implementation of the parameter estimation. The objectives are clear, objective, and mathematically formalizable. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as specified: first, the derivation of the rate expression, and second, the design of a numerical parameter estimator.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Rate Expression**\n\nThe mechanism involves three elementary steps on the catalyst surface. Let $*$ denote a vacant active site, and $A*$ and $B*$ denote species $A$ and $B$ adsorbed on active sites.\n\n1.  Reversible, non-dissociative adsorption of reactant $A$:\n    $$A(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$$\n2.  Reversible, non-dissociative adsorption of reactant $B$:\n    $$B(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$$\n3.  Irreversible, bimolecular surface reaction between adsorbed $A$ and $B$, which is the rate-determining step (RDS):\n    $$A* + B* \\xrightarrow{k_{surf}} \\text{Products} + 2*$$\n\nThe problem states that the surface reaction is the sole rate-determining step. The observed rate of reaction, $r$, is therefore determined by the rate of this step. The rate is proportional to the product of the fractional surface coverages of the adsorbed reactants, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$.\n$$r = k \\, \\theta_A \\, \\theta_B$$\nThe parameter $k$ is the intrinsic rate constant with units $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which correctly implies that it has absorbed the total concentration of active sites.\n\nThe adsorption steps are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium. We can thus apply the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. For competitive adsorption, the equilibrium relationship for each species is defined in terms of its partial pressure and the fraction of vacant sites, $\\theta_*$.\n\nFor species $A$, the adsorption equilibrium constant $K_A$ is defined as:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{P_A \\theta_*}$$\nThis allows us to express the surface coverage of $A$ as:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A P_A \\theta_*$$\n\nSimilarly, for species $B$, the adsorption equilibrium constant $K_B$ is:\n$$K_B = \\frac{\\theta_B}{P_B \\theta_*}$$\nAnd the surface coverage of $B$ is:\n$$\\theta_B = K_B P_B \\theta_*$$\n\nThe fractional surface coverages must sum to unity. This is the site balance equation. Since only vacant sites, adsorbed $A$, and adsorbed $B$ are present on the surface (products and spectators do not occupy sites), the site balance is:\n$$\\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_B = 1$$\n\nTo derive the rate law in terms of measurable partial pressures, we must eliminate the unmeasurable fractional coverages from the rate expression. We substitute the equilibrium expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the site balance equation:\n$$ \\theta_* + (K_A P_A \\theta_*) + (K_B P_B \\theta_*) = 1 $$\nWe can factor out $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_* (1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B) = 1 $$\nSolving for the fractional coverage of vacant sites, $\\theta_*$, gives:\n$$ \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} $$\n\nNow, we can express $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ solely in terms of partial pressures and constants by substituting the expression for $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A P_A \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} \\right) = \\frac{K_A P_A}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} $$\n$$ \\theta_B = K_B P_B \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} \\right) = \\frac{K_B P_B}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute these expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the rate equation $r = k \\theta_A \\theta_B$:\n$$ r = k \\left( \\frac{K_A P_A}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_B P_B}{1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B} \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expression:\n$$ r(P_A, P_B; k, K_A, K_B) = \\frac{k K_A K_B P_A P_B}{(1 + K_A P_A + K_B P_B)^2} $$\nThis expression gives the reaction rate as a function of the partial pressures of the reactants and the three kinetic parameters $k$, $K_A$, and $K_B$.\n\n**Task 2: Design of the Nonlinear Least Squares Estimator**\n\nThe goal is to estimate the parameters $\\vec{p} = (k, K_A, K_B)$ from a set of $N$ experimental measurements of the rate $r_{\\text{obs},i}$ at given partial pressures $(P_{A,i}, P_{B,i})$. The estimator is designed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the observed rates and the rates predicted by the derived model. The objective function $S(\\vec{p})$ is:\n$$ S(\\vec{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ r_{\\text{obs},i} - r(P_{A,i}, P_{B,i}; \\vec{p}) \\right]^2 $$\n\nThe physical parameters $k$, $K_A$, and $K_B$ must be strictly positive. To enforce this constraint and enhance the robustness of the numerical optimization, especially when parameters have different orders of magnitude, a parameter transformation is employed. We define a new set of parameters $\\vec{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_k, \\alpha_A, \\alpha_B)$ such that:\n$$ k = e^{\\alpha_k}, \\quad K_A = e^{\\alpha_A}, \\quad K_B = e^{\\alpha_B} $$\nThe optimization is then performed over $\\vec{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ without constraints. The exponential function ensures that the resulting physical parameters $(k, K_A, K_B)$ are always positive. This reparameterization transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one, which is typically easier for numerical algorithms to solve. The model, in terms of $\\vec{\\alpha}$, is:\n$$ r(P_A, P_B; \\vec{\\alpha}) = \\frac{e^{\\alpha_k} e^{\\alpha_A} e^{\\alpha_B} P_A P_B}{(1 + e^{\\alpha_A} P_A + e^{\\alpha_B} P_B)^2} $$\n\nThe numerical estimation procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, generate a synthetic dataset. The pressures $(P_{A,i}, P_{B,i})$ are taken from the specified grid. The corresponding \"observed\" rates $r_{\\text{obs},i}$ are calculated using the derived rate expression with the true parameter values provided for that test case. No noise is added.\n2.  The `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function is used to find the parameter vector $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}}$ that minimizes the SSR. This function requires a function that returns the vector of residuals, $f_i = r_{\\text{obs},i} - r(P_{A,i}, P_{B,i}; \\vec{\\alpha})$.\n3.  A reasonable initial guess for the optimization is $\\vec{\\alpha}_0 = (0, 0, 0)$, which corresponds to an initial guess of $(k, K_A, K_B) = (1, 1, 1)$.\n4.  Once the optimal transformed parameters $\\hat{\\vec{\\alpha}} = (\\hat{\\alpha}_k, \\hat{\\alpha}_A, \\hat{\\alpha}_B)$ are found, they are converted back to the physical parameters:\n    $$ \\hat{k} = e^{\\hat{\\alpha}_k}, \\quad \\hat{K}_A = e^{\\hat{\\alpha}_A}, \\quad \\hat{K}_B = e^{\\hat{\\alpha}_B} $$\n5.  These estimated parameters $(\\hat{k}, \\hat{K}_A, \\hat{K}_B)$ are then reported for each test case, rounded to six significant figures.\n\nThis methodology provides a robust and principled approach to solving the parameter estimation problem as specified.",
