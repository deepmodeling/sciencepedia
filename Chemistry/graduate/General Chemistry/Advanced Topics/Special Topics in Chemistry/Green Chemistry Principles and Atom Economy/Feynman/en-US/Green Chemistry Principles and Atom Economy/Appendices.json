Atom Economy (AE)\nThe definition of atom economy is the ratio of the mass of the desired product to the total mass of all reactants, based on the ideal stoichiometry. For this $1:1$ reaction, the expression is:\n$$ AE = \\frac{M_{\\text{product}}}{ \\sum M_{\\text{reactants}} } = \\frac{M_{\\text{styr}}}{M_{\\text{benz}} + M_{\\text{ylide}}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated molar masses:\n$$ AE = \\frac{104.152}{106.124 + 276.319} = \\frac{104.152}{382.443} \\approx 0.27233 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $AE = 0.2723$.\n\n2. Carbon Efficiency (CE)\nThe definition of carbon efficiency is the ratio of the moles of carbon atoms in the final product to the total moles of carbon atoms in all reactants, based on the ideal stoichiometry.\n$$ CE = \\frac{\\text{moles of C in product}}{\\text{moles of C in reactants}} = \\frac{8}{7 + 19} = \\frac{8}{26} $$\n$$ CE \\approx 0.30769 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $CE = 0.3077$.\n\n3. Environmental Factor (E-factor)\nThe E-factor is defined as the total mass of waste generated per unit mass of product.\n$$ E = \\frac{\\text{Total mass of waste}}{\\text{Mass of product}} $$\nTo calculate this, we must first perform a complete mass balance for the actual process.\nMass of desired product (styrene, $m_{\\text{styr}}$):\nThe reaction is run with $0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol}$ of the limiting reagent (benzaldehyde) and achieves a fractional yield of $0.930$.\n$$ n_{\\text{styr}} = n_{\\text{benz}} \\times \\text{yield} = 0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol} \\times 0.930 = 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol} $$\n$$ m_{\\text{styr}} = n_{\\text{styr}} \\times M_{\\text{styr}} = 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol} \\times 104.152\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}} = 29.0584\\ \\mathrm{g} $$\n\nTotal mass of waste ($m_{\\text{waste}}$) is the sum of all materials that are not the final product.

Reacted amount is $n_{\\text{styr}} = 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol}$.\n  $$ n_{\\text{ylide, unreacted}} = 0.330\\ \\mathrm{mol} - 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol} = 0.051\\ \\mathrm{mol} $$\n  $$ m_{\\text{ylide, unreacted}} = 0.051\\ \\mathrm{mol} \\times 276.319\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}} = 14.092\\ \\mathrm{g} $$\n- Mass of lost and unrecovered solvents and auxiliaries ($m_{\\text{aux, waste}}$):\n  - Toluene loss: $0.100 \\times (5.00\\ \\mathrm{L} \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{mL/L} \\times 0.867\\ \\mathrm{g/mL}) = 433.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Hexanes: $6.00\\ \\mathrm{L} \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{mL/L} \\times 0.655\\ \\mathrm{g/mL} = 3930\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Ethyl acetate: $4.00\\ \\mathrm{L} \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{mL/L} \\times 0.902\\ \\mathrm{g/mL} = 3608\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Water/Brine: $(1.00\\ \\mathrm{L} + 2.00\\ \\mathrm{L}) \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{g/L} = 3000\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Sodium sulfate: $200\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Silica gel: $800\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n  - Total $m_{\\text{aux, waste}} = 433.5 + 3930 + 3608 + 3000 + 200 + 800 = 11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n\nTotal waste is the sum of reaction-derived and auxiliary-derived waste:\n$$ m_{\\text{waste}} = m_{\\text{TPPO}} + m_{\\text{benz, unreacted}} + m_{\\text{ylide, unreacted}} + m_{\\text{aux, waste}} $$\n$$ m_{\\text{waste}} = 77.643\\ \\mathrm{g} + 2.229\\ \\mathrm{g} + 14.092\\ \\mathrm{g} + 11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g} = 12065.464\\ \\mathrm{g} $$\nThe E-factor is therefore:\n$$ E = \\frac{12065.464\\ \\mathrm{g}}{29.0584\\ \\mathrm{g}} \\approx 415.21 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $E = 415.2$.\n\n4. Process Mass Intensity (PMI)\nPMI is defined as the ratio of the total mass of all materials put into the process to the mass of the final product.\n$$ PMI = \\frac{\\text{Total mass input}}{\\text{Mass of product}} $$\nIt can also be expressed in terms of the E-factor. By conservation of mass, Total Mass Input = Mass of Product + Total Mass of Waste.\n$$ PMI = \\frac{m_{\\text{product}} + m_{\\text{waste}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} = 1 + \\frac{m_{\\text{waste}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} = 1 + E $$\nUsing the calculated E-factor:\n$$ PMI = 1 + 415.21 \\approx 416.21 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PMI = 416.2$.\n\nJustification: Why a high percent yield does not guarantee a low E-factor.\nThe E-factor is expressed as $E = m_{\\text{waste}}/m_{\\text{product}}$. The total waste mass, $m_{\\text{waste}}$, can be decomposed into two components: waste from the chemical transformation itself ($m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$, which includes byproducts and unreacted starting materials) and waste from auxiliary materials ($m_{\\text{waste, aux}}$, which includes solvents, purification media, etc.).\n$$ E = \\frac{m_{\\text{waste, reaction}} + m_{\\text{waste, aux}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} $$\nThe percent yield directly impacts the quantities in this ratio. A high yield maximizes the mass of the product, $m_{\\text{product}}$ (the denominator), and minimizes the reaction-specific waste, $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$ (part of the numerator). While a high yield is beneficial, it has no effect on the mass of auxiliary materials, $m_{\\text{waste, aux}}$.\n\nIn the present case, the isolated product mass is $m_{\\text{product}} \\approx 29.1\\ \\mathrm{g}$. The reaction-derived waste (TPPO and unreacted reagents) is $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}} \\approx 94.0\\ \\mathrm{g}$. However, the auxiliary waste from solvents and solids is $m_{\\text{waste, aux}} \\approx 11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$. The total waste is therefore overwhelmingly dominated by the auxiliary materials, which constitute $\\frac{11971.5}{12065.5} \\approx 99.2\\%$ of the total waste stream.\nEven if the reaction proceeded with a perfect $100\\%$ yield, $m_{\\text{product}}$ would increase only slightly to $31.2\\ \\mathrm{g}$ and $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$ would decrease slightly, but the enormous mass of auxiliary waste ($11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$) would remain unchanged. The E-factor would still be exceedingly large. Consequently, a high percent yield, while improving atom utilization within the core transformation, is insufficient to ensure a \"green\" or efficient process (low E-factor) when the mass of auxiliary materials is disproportionately large compared to the mass of reactants and products. Process efficiency is a function of both reaction performance and the material intensity of the overall protocol, including workup and purification.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any solution is attempted.\n\nFirst, all stoichiometric steps are examined for mass conservation.\nFor Route A, Step 1: $MW(A) + MW(B) = 110.0 + 120.0 = 230.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$. The sum of product molecular weights is $MW(\\mathrm{IntA}) + MW(\\text{byproduct}) = 200.0 + 30.0 = 230.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$. Mass is conserved.\nFor Route A, Step 2: $MW(\\mathrm{IntA}) + MW(C_1) = 200.0 + 50.0 = 250.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.

Mass is conserved.\nThe same verification confirms mass conservation for all four steps of Route B.\n\nSecond, the problem's internal consistency is verified. A potential ambiguity exists in the description of inputs for Step 2 of Route A and Step 3 of Route B. The stoichiometry indicates consumption of reagent $C_1$ ($MW=50.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$), but the list of external inputs only specifies oxidant $O$ and a base. However, the mass of oxidant $O$ charged per mole of product $T$ is given as $60.00\\,\\mathrm{g}$ at $1.20$ equivalents. This allows calculation of the molecular weight of $O$: $MW(O) = \\frac{60.00\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{mol}} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$. This value is identical to $MW(C_1)$. The only logical conclusion is that reagent $C_1$ is the oxidant $O$. The problem is therefore self-consistent and well-posed, requiring careful reading rather than assumption of missing data.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.

The batch is charged with exactly the stoichiometric mass of reactants required to produce a theoretical mass $m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$ of $P$ if the isolated fractional yield were $Y = 1$. The isolation and workup use a fixed auxiliary mass $m_{W}$ (e.g., solvent and consumables) that is independent of $Y$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n- A single-step synthesis produces product $P$.\n- Reactants are stoichiometric.\n- No reagent or solvent recovery.\n- The batch is charged with the stoichiometric mass of reactants required to produce a theoretical mass $m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$ of $P$ if the isolated fractional yield were $Y=1$.\n- Isolation and workup use a fixed auxiliary mass $m_{W}$.\n- Atom economy is defined as $AE = \\frac{\\text{mass of desired product}}{\\text{total mass of reactants at stoichiometry}}$.\n- Environmental factor is defined as $E = \\frac{\\text{total mass of non-product outputs}}{\\text{mass of isolated product}}$.\n- Isolated fractional yield is $Y$, where $0 < Y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of green chemistry and mass conservation. The definitions provided for Atom Economy and E-factor are standard. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with sufficient information to derive the requested expression. It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds by formalizing the relationships between the given quantities.\n\nFirst, let $m_{R}^{\\text{total}}$ be the total mass of reactants charged to the batch. From the definition of atom economy ($AE$), applied at theoretical stoichiometry ($Y=1$):\n$$AE = \\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{m_{R}^{\\text{total}}}$$\nFrom this, the total mass of reactants is:\n$$m_{R}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE}$$\n\nThe mass of the isolated product, $m_{P}^{\\text{iso}}$, is given by the theoretical mass multiplied by the actual fractional yield $Y$:\n$$m_{P}^{\\text{iso}} = Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$$\n\nThe total mass input to the process, $m_{\\text{in}}$, is the sum of the mass of reactants and the mass of auxiliary materials:\n$$m_{\\text{in}} = m_{R}^{\\text{total}} + m_{W} = \\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE} + m_{W}$$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of mass, the total mass output, $m_{\\text{out}}$, must equal the total mass input, $m_{\\text{in}}$. The total output consists of the isolated product and all non-product outputs (waste), which we denote as $m_{\\text{waste}}$.\n$$m_{\\text{out}} = m_{P}^{\\text{iso}} + m_{\\text{waste}} = m_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nWe can now express the total mass of waste as a function of the inputs and the isolated product mass:\n$$m_{\\text{waste}} = m_{\\text{in}} - m_{P}^{\\text{iso}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_{\\text{in}}$ and $m_{P}^{\\text{iso}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{waste}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE} + m_{W}\\right) - Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the E-factor, $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{m_{\\text{waste}}}{m_{P}^{\\text{iso}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_{\\text{waste}}$ and $m_{P}^{\\text{iso}}$ gives the E-factor as a function of yield $Y$:\n$$E(Y) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE} + m_{W}\\right) - Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}$$\n\nTo facilitate differentiation, this expression can be algebraically simplified:\n$$E(Y) = \\frac{\\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE} + m_{W}}{Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} - \\frac{Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{Y \\cdot m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}$$\n$$E(Y) = \\frac{1}{Y} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}}{AE} + m_{W}}{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} \\right) - 1$$\n$$E(Y) = \\frac{1}{Y} \\left( \\frac{1}{AE} + \\frac{m_{W}}{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} \\right) - 1$$\n\nThe task requires computing the sensitivity of $E$ with respect to $Y$, which is the derivative $\\frac{dE}{dY}$. We differentiate the simplified expression for $E(Y)$ with respect to $Y$. The term $\\left( \\frac{1}{AE} + \\frac{m_{W}}{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} \\right)$ is a constant with respect to $Y$.\n$$\\frac{dE}{dY} = \\frac{d}{dY} \\left[ \\frac{1}{Y} \\left( \\frac{1}{AE} + \\frac{m_{W}}{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} \\right) - 1 \\right]$$\nApplying the power rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dY}(Y^{-1}) = -Y^{-2}$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dY} = -\\frac{1}{Y^{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{AE} + \\frac{m_{W}}{m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}} \\right)$$\n\nThis expression for the derivative is solely in terms of the specified variables $Y$, $AE$, $m_{W}$, and $m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe sign of $\\frac{dE}{dY}$ is negative, because all terms on the right-hand side ($Y$, $AE$, $m_W$, $m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$) are positive quantities. This signifies an inverse relationship between E-factor and yield: increasing the yield necessarily decreases the E-factor, meaning less waste is generated per unit of product. This is an expected outcome.\nThe magnitude of the derivative, $|\\frac{dE}{dY}|$, is inversely proportional to $Y^{2}$. This indicates that the E-factor is most sensitive to changes in yield when the yield is low. An improvement in yield from, for example, $Y=0.1$ to $Y=0.2$ will result in a much greater reduction in the E-factor than an improvement from $Y=0.8$ to $Y=0.9$. This places a high priority on improving processes with very low yields, as even small absolute gains in yield can lead to substantial reductions in waste generation. The magnitude is also amplified by poor atom economy (small $AE$ implies large $1/AE$) and a high auxiliary mass burden (large $m_{W}/m_{P}^{\\text{theor}}$). Therefore, process optimization efforts provide the greatest environmental benefit when focused on improving the yield of inefficient reactions, particularly those with inherently poor atom economy or those requiring large quantities of solvents and other consumables.",
