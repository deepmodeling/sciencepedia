Using Crystal Field Theory (CFT), start from the definition that the five $d$ orbitals split in an octahedral field into a lower-energy triply degenerate set and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set, with the average energy of all five orbitals conserved (the barycenter), and that placing two electrons in the same spatial orbital costs an energy $P$. Determine which spin state (high spin versus low spin) has the lower total electronic energy by explicitly comparing the tradeoff between ligand field stabilization and pairing. Then, for the ground state you identify, compute the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE), defined as the stabilization relative to the barycenter arising only from the distribution of electrons in the split $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ levels and excluding any pairing-energy contribution.

It furnishes all necessary data ($\\Delta_o$, $P$, $d$-electron count, geometry) and provides clear, unambiguous definitions for all terms, including a specific definition for CFSE which is crucial for a unique solution. The values are physically plausible. The problem is a standard, non-trivial application of Crystal Field Theory and is free of logical contradictions, pseudoscientific claims, or subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nAccording to Crystal Field Theory, in an octahedral ligand field, the $5$ degenerate $d$-orbitals split into two sets: the triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals and the doubly degenerate $e_g$ orbitals. The energy difference between these sets is the ligand field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$.\n\nThe barycenter rule dictates that the weighted average energy of the orbitals remains zero. Let $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$ be the energies of the respective orbital sets relative to the barycenter. The conservation of energy is expressed as:\n$$3 \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + 2 \\cdot E(e_g) = 0$$\nThe energy separation is given by:\n$$E(e_g) - E(t_{2g}) = \\Delta_o$$\nSolving this system of two linear equations for the two unknown energies yields:\n$$E(t_{2g}) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n$$E(e_g) = +\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n\nFor a metal center with a $d^4$ electron configuration, two possible spin states exist: high spin and low spin. The preferred state is the one with the lower total electronic energy, which is a sum of the orbital energy contributions and the total pairing energy.\n\n**Case 1: High-Spin (HS) State**\nIn this configuration, Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity is followed. The first $3$ electrons occupy the $3$ separate $t_{2g}$ orbitals with parallel spins. The fourth electron occupies an $e_g$ orbital, also with a parallel spin, to maximize the total spin multiplicity.\n- Electron configuration: $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n_{t2g} = 3$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $n_{eg} = 1$.\n- Number of paired electrons, $N_p = 0$.\nThe total electronic energy for the high-spin state, $E_{HS}$, is:\n$$E_{HS} = n_{t2g} \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + n_{eg} \\cdot E(e_g) + N_p \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{HS} = 3 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 1 \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{HS} = -\\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_o + \\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o = -\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n\n**Case 2: Low-Spin (LS) State**\nIn this configuration, it is energetically more favorable to pair electrons in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals than to promote an electron across the energy gap $\\Delta_o$. The first $3$ electrons singly occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The fourth electron pairs with one of the electrons already in a $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n- Electron configuration: $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^0$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n_{t2g} = 4$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $n_{eg} = 0$.\n- Number of paired electrons, $N_p = 1$.\nThe total electronic energy for the low-spin state, $E_{LS}$, is:\n$$E_{LS} = n_{t2g} \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + n_{eg} \\cdot E(e_g) + N_p \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{LS} = 4 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 1 \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{LS} = -\\frac{8}{5}\\Delta_o + P$$\n\n**Comparison of Energies**\nTo determine the ground state, we compare $E_{HS}$ and $E_{LS}$ using the provided values of $\\Delta_o = 16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $P = 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$E_{HS} = -\\frac{3}{5}(16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = -3(3200\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = -9\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$E_{LS} = -\\frac{8}{5}(16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -8(3200\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -25\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -7\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nComparing the two energies: $E_{HS} = -9\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $E_{LS} = -7\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Since $-9\\,600  -7\\,600$, the high-spin state has a lower energy and is the ground state.\nThis result is consistent with the general principle that high-spin states are favored when the pairing energy is greater than the ligand field splitting ($P > \\Delta_o$), which is true in this case ($18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} > 16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$).\nSince the ground state is high spin, the spin state variable is $s=1$.\n\n**Calculation of Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**\nThe problem defines CFSE as the stabilization energy arising only from the distribution of electrons in the split $d$-orbitals, excluding any pairing energy cost. For the ground state, which is the high-spin configuration $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$:\n$$\\text{CFSE} = n_{t2g} \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + n_{eg} \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right)$$\n$$\\text{CFSE} = 3 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 1 \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) = -\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\Delta_o$:\n$$\\text{CFSE} = -\\frac{3}{5}(16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = -9\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe final answer is a matrix containing the spin state indicator $s=1$ and the calculated CFSE.",

            "problem": "A first-row transition metal ion $\\text{M}^{2+}$ forms a tetrahedral complex $[\\text{MX}_4]^{2-}$ with four identical halide ligands $\\text{X}^- \\in \\{\\mathrm{Cl}^-, \\mathrm{Br}^-, \\mathrm{I}^-\\}$. Using the electrostatic picture of Crystal Field Theory (CFT), the crystal field splitting energy in a ligand field is the energy difference between groups of $d$-orbitals created by anisotropic Coulombic repulsion between the electron density of the metal $d$-orbitals and the negative charge on the ligands. The electron pairing energy $P$ is the intra-atomic energy cost to place two electrons with opposite spin in the same $d$-orbital, arising from Coulomb repulsion and the loss of exchange stabilization. Empirically for first-row transition metals, $P$ is commonly on the order of $1.5\\times 10^4$ to $3.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. For the corresponding octahedral complexes $[\\text{MX}_6]^{4-}$ of the same $\\text{M}^{2+}$ and $\\text{X}^-$, the measured octahedral crystal field splitting $\\Delta_o$ typically lies in the range $3.0\\times 10^3$ to $1.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ across the series $\\text{X}^-=\\mathrm{I}^-,\\mathrm{Br}^-,\\mathrm{Cl}^-$. In a tetrahedral geometry, there are four ligands and they approach along directions that do not coincide with the Cartesian axes of the $d$-orbital lobes, so the $d$-orbital–ligand repulsions are less direct than in an octahedral geometry with six ligands. Without invoking any memorized proportionality constants for $\\Delta_t$ relative to $\\Delta_o$, use these facts and the spatial orientation of the $d$-orbitals to assess whether low-spin electron configurations are likely in tetrahedral halide complexes of first-row transition metals. Which option best explains why low-spin tetrahedral complexes are rare?\n\nA. Low-spin tetrahedral complexes are common because halide ligands generate a crystal field splitting $\\Delta_t$ that typically exceeds $P$; with $\\Delta_t \\gtrsim P$, electrons pair to minimize the crystal field stabilization energy, favoring low spin.\n\nB. Low-spin tetrahedral complexes are rare because the four-ligand, off-axis approach in tetrahedral fields produces a crystal field splitting $\\Delta_t$ that is substantially smaller than the already weak-field $\\Delta_o$ for halides; with $\\Delta_t \\ll P$ for first-row ions, electrons avoid pairing, yielding high-spin configurations.\n\nC. Low-spin tetrahedral complexes are common because having only four ligands reduces interelectronic repulsions so strongly that the pairing energy $P$ becomes negligible; electrons therefore pair before occupying higher-energy $d$-orbitals.\n\nD. Low-spin tetrahedral complexes are rare because spin–orbit coupling dominates over crystal field effects in tetrahedral symmetry, making the magnitude of $\\Delta_t$ irrelevant; only $d^0$ and $d^{10}$ configurations can be low spin in tetrahedral fields.",
            "solution": "Begin from the definitions in Crystal Field Theory (CFT). In CFT, the crystal field splitting is an electrostatic effect: ligands modeled as point charges (or dipoles) repel the electron density residing in the metal $d$-orbitals. The energy penalty is larger when a $d$-orbital lobe points more directly toward a ligand and when there are more ligands at a given metal–ligand distance. The splitting magnitude in a given geometry is then determined by (i) the number of ligands and their arrangement, which set the symmetry and directionality of the repulsions, and (ii) the ligand field strength, which scales with the ligand’s ability to interact electrostatically and covalently with the metal center. The electron pairing energy $P$ is the energy cost to place two electrons into the same $d$-orbital and is set primarily by intra-atomic Coulomb and exchange contributions, which for first-row transition metals are typically on the order of $1.5\\times 10^4$ to $3.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nOccupancy rules in CFT follow an energy minimization principle: when the crystal field splitting in a given coordination geometry is $\\Delta$ (for example, $\\Delta_o$ in octahedral or $\\Delta_t$ in tetrahedral), electrons occupy the lower-energy subset of $d$-orbitals singly with parallel spins (maximizing exchange stabilization) until the energy trade-off between placing the next electron in a higher-energy orbital versus pairing it in a lower-energy orbital is determined by comparing $\\Delta$ and $P$. If $\\Delta  P$ for the relevant step, pairing is favored and a low-spin arrangement results; if $\\Delta  P$, electrons remain unpaired as much as possible and a high-spin arrangement results.\n\nConsider halide ligands $\\text{X}^- = \\mathrm{Cl}^-, \\mathrm{Br}^-, \\mathrm{I}^-$, which are weak-field donors. For the corresponding octahedral complexes $[\\text{MX}_6]^{4-}$ of first-row metals, empirical data place $\\Delta_o$ typically in the range $3.0\\times 10^3$ to $1.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, reflecting the weak-field character of halides. In tetrahedral geometry, the ligands approach along directions that do not coincide with the Cartesian axes of the $d$-orbitals; none of the $d$-orbitals points directly at a ligand. Additionally, there are only four ligands rather than six. Both effects reduce the net electrostatic repulsion and therefore the magnitude of the splitting. Consequently, one expects $\\Delta_t$ to be significantly smaller than the corresponding $\\Delta_o$ for the same metal–ligand pair.\n\nTo make this comparison quantitative without adopting any particular proportionality, take a representative weak-field octahedral splitting for a halide complex, for instance $\\Delta_o \\approx 8.0\\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for some $\\text{M}^{2+}$ with $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$. Because the tetrahedral field has fewer ligands and less direct overlap, a conservative expectation is that $\\Delta_t$ is substantially smaller than $\\Delta_o$; even if we assumed only a modest reduction such that $\\Delta_t \\lesssim \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Delta_o$, we would obtain $\\Delta_t \\lesssim 4.0\\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is to be compared with a typical pairing energy $P \\approx 2.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for first-row transition metals. The inequality $\\Delta_t \\ll P$ follows immediately:\n$$\n\\Delta_t \\lesssim 4.0\\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad P \\approx 2.0\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\Delta_t  P.\n$$\nTherefore, the energy penalty to occupy the higher subset of $d$-orbitals in a tetrahedral field is far smaller than the energy cost of pairing electrons. Energy minimization thus favors maximizing the number of unpaired electrons (high spin), not pairing (low spin). This logic holds broadly for first-row tetrahedral halide complexes across $\\text{X}^- = \\mathrm{I}^-, \\mathrm{Br}^-, \\mathrm{Cl}^-$ because $\\Delta_o$ is small for halides and $\\Delta_t$ is even smaller by geometric considerations. Hence, low-spin tetrahedral complexes are rare.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This claims that halide ligands in tetrahedral geometry yield $\\Delta_t \\gtrsim P$, which would drive low spin. This contradicts both the weak-field character of halides (small $\\Delta$) and the geometric reduction of splitting in tetrahedral compared to octahedral fields (fewer ligands and off-axis approach). Numerical comparison above shows $\\Delta_t \\ll P$ for typical first-row halide systems. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This correctly states that tetrahedral fields generated by four off-axis ligands produce a smaller crystal field splitting than octahedral fields with the same ligands, and that halides already give small $\\Delta_o$. With $P$ for first-row metals being significantly larger than these splittings, the inequality $\\Delta_t \\ll P$ holds, favoring high-spin and making low-spin rare. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This claims that having four ligands reduces the pairing energy $P$ to negligible values. The pairing energy $P$ is an intra-atomic quantity largely determined by electron–electron repulsion and exchange within a $d$-orbital on the metal; it does not collapse simply because there are fewer ligands. The presence of fewer ligands reduces $\\Delta_t$, not $P$. The conclusion and mechanism are both flawed. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This asserts that spin–orbit coupling dominates the spin state selection in tetrahedral fields and renders $\\Delta_t$ irrelevant, restricting low spin to $d^0$ and $d^{10}$ (which are trivially “low spin” because there are no or fully paired $d$-electrons). For first-row transition metals, spin–orbit coupling is relatively weak compared to crystal field and pairing energies, and spin-state preferences are governed by the competition between $\\Delta$ and $P$. The statement is not an explanation for the rarity of low-spin tetrahedral complexes with halides. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that $\\Delta_t$ is much smaller than $P$ for first-row tetrahedral halide complexes, so high-spin configurations are favored and low-spin cases are rare.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question that tests fundamental concepts in inorganic chemistry. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nWe begin by considering the five degenerate $d$ orbitals in a free metal ion: $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{z^2}$, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$. In a square-planar complex with ligands on the $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$ axes, the electrostatic field from the ligand electron density removes this degeneracy.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital**: According to Guiding Principle 1, orbitals pointing directly at ligands experience the greatest repulsion. The lobes of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are oriented precisely along the $x$ and $y$ axes, directly at the four $\\sigma$-donor ligands. This leads to maximum orbital overlap in a $\\sigma$-antibonding fashion, resulting in a severe destabilization. Consequently, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes the highest-energy molecular orbital derived from the $d$-subshell. In the language of group theory for the $D_{4h}$ point group, this orbital transforms as the $b_{1g}$ irreducible representation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Orbitals with $z$ Character**: According to Guiding Principle 2, removing the two axial ligands from an octahedral parent complex stabilizes orbitals with $z$-character.\n    -   The $d_{z^2}$ orbital has its primary lobes along the $z$-axis. Removal of ligands from this axis drastically reduces the Coulombic repulsion it experiences, causing a significant drop in its energy from the high-energy $e_g$ level of the parent octahedron. It transforms as $a_{1g}$ in $D_{4h}$.\n    -   The $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals have lobes in the $xz$ and $yz$ planes, respectively. In an octahedral field, they are repelled by the axial ligands. In a square-planar field, this repulsion is eliminated, causing them to be stabilized. They remain degenerate and form the lowest-energy set of orbitals. They transform as the $e_g$ irreducible representation in $D_{4h}$ (note: the labels $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ from $O_h$ symmetry are not the same as labels in $D_{4h}$).\n\n3.  **Analysis of the $d_{xy}$ orbital**: The lobes of the $d_{xy}$ orbital lie in the $xy$-plane but are directed *between* the $x$ and $y$ axes. It is therefore repelled by the four in-plane ligands, but to a lesser extent than the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. As it has no $z$ component, its energy is not significantly affected by the removal of axial ligands. It is destabilized relative to the free-ion barycenter and is typically found to be the second highest in energy, below $d_{x^2-y^2}$. It transforms as $b_{2g}$ in $D_{4h}$.\n\n4.  **Overall Energy Level Diagram**: Based on the analysis above, the qualitative energy ordering of the $d$ orbitals in a $\\sigma$-only square-planar field is:\n    $$E(d_{x^2-y^2}) \\gg E(d_{xy})  E(d_{z^2})  E(d_{xz}) = E(d_{yz})$$\n    A large energy gap, often denoted $\\Delta_{sp}$, exists between the highest-energy $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and the set of four lower-lying orbitals.\n\n5.  **Rationalization for $d^8$ Ion Stability**: The problem specifies strong-field ligands (Guiding Principle 3). This implies that the crystal field splitting energy is large compared to the electron pairing energy. For a metal ion with a $d^8$ electron configuration, the $8$ electrons will populate the available orbitals to achieve the lowest possible energy state. Given the derived energy diagram, the $8$ electrons will fill the four lowest-energy orbitals: $(d_{xz})^2(d_{yz})^2(d_{z^2})^2(d_{xy})^2$. This configuration leaves the strongly antibonding $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital completely empty. The system thereby avoids a massive energetic penalty, leading to a large overall Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE). This large CFSE is a primary thermodynamic driving force for the common observation of square-planar geometry for $d^8$ metal ions, particularly those in the 2nd and 3rd transition series (e.g., $Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), Pt(II), Au(III)$) and with strong-field ligands for the 1st transition series (e.g., $[\\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A**: This option claims that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ lies \"perpendicular to the ligand directions\" and is \"most stabilized\". This is factually incorrect. The lobes of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital point directly at the ligands, leading to maximum repulsion and destabilization. The remainder of the option's reasoning is based on this false premise.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **B**: This option correctly states that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital's lobes align with the ligands on the $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$ axes, maximizing $\\sigma$ antibonding and making it the highest-energy orbital. It correctly identifies the stabilization of $z$-containing orbitals ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) upon removal of axial ligands. It provides the accepted qualitative energy level ordering for a $\\sigma$-only square-planar field. Finally, it correctly explains that a $d^8$ ion fills the four lower orbitals, leaving the high-energy $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital empty, which results in a large CFSE that stabilizes this geometry. Every part of this statement is consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n-   **C**: This option invokes `π` backbonding as the primary stabilizing effect. The problem explicitly forbids this by stating to assume \"negligible $\\pi$ interactions\". Furthermore, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is of $\\sigma$ symmetry with respect to the metal-ligand bonds and cannot participate in `π` backbonding. The statement is fundamentally inconsistent with the problem's premises and with bonding theory.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **D**: This option claims that removing axial ligands *raises* the energy of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. This is the opposite of the correct effect. Removing the repulsive ligand electron density along the $z$-axis *lowers*, or stabilizes, the energy of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. The reasoning is flawed.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **E**: This option proposes that stabilization arises from maximized degeneracy and an entropic effect. This is false. A square-planar field *removes* degeneracy compared to a spherical or octahedral field, leading to multiple distinct energy levels. The stabilization of $d^8$ ions is a strong enthalpic effect (large CFSE) driven by orbital energy differences, not a configurational entropy effect. The claim that the stabilization is independent of orbital orientation and overlap contradicts the very foundation of CFT and LFT.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**",
