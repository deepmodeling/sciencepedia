It is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. The provided numerical values are physically realistic; for instance, they are very close to the known parameters for the carbon monoxide molecule ($\\text{CO}$). The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial. It requires a standard, but rigorous, derivation connecting quantum mechanical energy levels with spectroscopic observables.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe motion of a diatomic molecule along its internuclear axis, for small displacements $x$ from its equilibrium bond length, can be modeled by the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a harmonic potential $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. The equation is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the molecule, $k$ is the force constant of the bond, and $E$ is the energy.\n\nThe solutions to this equation yield quantized energy levels, known as the vibrational energy levels of the harmonic oscillator, given by the formula:\n$$\nE_v = \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega\n$$\nHere, $v$ is the vibrational quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values ($v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), and $\\omega$ is the classical angular frequency of the oscillator. This angular frequency is related to the force constant $k$ and the reduced mass $\\mu$ by:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nAn infrared (IR) absorption experiment probes the transitions between these energy levels. The \"fundamental\" transition corresponds to the excitation from the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) to the first excited vibrational state ($v=1$). The energy of the absorbed photon, $\\Delta E$, must be equal to the difference in energy between these two states.\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega - \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\hbar\\omega\n$$\nThe primary assumption here is that the harmonic oscillator model is a sufficient approximation for the lowest two vibrational levels and that spectroscopic selection rules ($\\Delta v = \\pm 1$) are strictly obeyed.\n\nIn spectroscopy, the transition energy is often reported as a wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength $\\lambda$. The energy of a photon is related to its wavenumber by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$\n\\Delta E = h\\nu_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the transition energy $\\Delta E$, we connect the quantum mechanical properties of the molecule to the experimentally observed wavenumber.\n$$\n\\hbar\\omega = hc\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$:\n$$\n\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\omega = hc\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nThis gives a direct relationship between the angular frequency $\\omega$ and the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$:\n$$\n\\omega = 2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nNow we have two expressions for the angular frequency: one from the mechanical model ($\\omega = \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$) and one from the spectroscopic measurement ($\\omega = 2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}$).

A convenient parameterization is in terms of a mixing angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\lvert \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\cos\\theta \\lvert 1 \\rangle + \\sin\\theta \\lvert 2 \\rangle $$\n$$ \\lvert \\psi_- \\rangle = -\\sin\\theta \\lvert 1 \\rangle + \\cos\\theta \\lvert 2 \\rangle $$\nThe coefficients in this parameterization are real and the eigenvectors are orthonormal, as required for a real symmetric Hamiltonian. The transition dipole moment to the upper state is:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_+ | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle = \\cos\\theta \\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle + \\sin\\theta \\langle 2 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle = \\cos\\theta \\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle $$\nThe intensity is thus $I_{\\text{upper}} \\propto (\\cos\\theta)^2 |\\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle|^2$.\nSimilarly, for the lower state:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_- | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle = -\\sin\\theta \\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle + \\cos\\theta \\langle 2 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle = -\\sin\\theta \\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle $$\nThe intensity is $I_{\\text{lower}} \\propto (-\\sin\\theta)^2 |\\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle|^2 = (\\sin\\theta)^2 |\\langle 1 | \\hat{\\mu} | g \\rangle|^2$.\nThe ratio of the intensities is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{upper}}}{I_{\\text{lower}}} = \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{\\sin^2\\theta} = \\cot^2\\theta $$\nTo find $\\cot\\theta$, we use the Schrödinger equation, $H\\lvert \\psi_+ \\rangle = E_+ \\lvert \\psi_+ \\rangle$. Substituting the matrix $H$ and the eigenvector $\\lvert \\psi_+ \\rangle$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} E_1 & W \\\\ W & E_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = E_+ \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe first row gives the equation:\n$$ E_1 \\cos\\theta + W \\sin\\theta = E_+ \\cos\\theta \\implies W\\sin\\theta = (E_+ - E_1)\\cos\\theta$$\n$$ \\tan\\theta = \\frac{E_+ - E_1}{W} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_+$:\n$$ E_+ - E_1 = \\left(\\frac{E_1 + E_2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}\\right) - E_1 = \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2} = \\frac{-\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}}{2} $$\nSo, $\\tan\\theta = \\frac{-\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}}{2W}$.\nThe required term is $\\cot\\theta = 1/\\tan\\theta$:\n$$ \\cot\\theta = \\frac{2W}{-\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}} $$\nRationalizing this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2})$ gives a simpler form:\n$$ \\cot\\theta = \\frac{2W(\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2})}{(-\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2})(\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2})} = \\frac{2W(\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2})}{(\\Delta^2 + 4W^2) - \\Delta^2} = \\frac{\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}}{2W} $$\nThe intensity ratio is $\\cot^2\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{upper}}}{I_{\\text{lower}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2}}{2W}\\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + 4W^2} = \\sqrt{9232} \\approx 96.08329 $$\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{upper}}}{I_{\\text{lower}}} = \\left(\\frac{4.0 + 96.08329}{2 \\times 48.0}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{100.08329}{96.0}\\right)^2 \\approx (1.042534)^2 \\approx 1.086877 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $I_{\\text{upper}}/I_{\\text{lower}} = 1.087$.\n\nThe final results are $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{split}} = 96.08~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $I_{\\text{upper}}/I_{\\text{lower}} = 1.087$.",
