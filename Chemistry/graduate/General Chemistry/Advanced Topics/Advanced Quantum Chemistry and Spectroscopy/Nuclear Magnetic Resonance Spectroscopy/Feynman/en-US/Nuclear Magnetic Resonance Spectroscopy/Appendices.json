            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and a subsequent calculation based on provided, physically realistic data. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe resonance condition for a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ nucleus, such as a proton ($^{1}\\text{H}$), in a static external magnetic field of strength $B_0$ is described by the Larmor equation. The Larmor frequency, $\\nu_L$, is the frequency at which the nuclear spin precesses about the axis of the magnetic field:\n$$ \\nu_L = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant specific to the nucleus.\n\nIn a molecular environment, the nucleus is shielded from the external field $B_0$ by the surrounding electron density. This shielding effect is characterized by a dimensionless shielding constant, $\\sigma$. The effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, $B_{\\text{eff}}$, is therefore modulated:\n$$ B_{\\text{eff}} = B_0 (1 - \\sigma) $$\nThe value of $\\sigma$ depends on the chemical environment of the nucleus. Consequently, the observed resonance frequency, $\\nu$, is given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 (1 - \\sigma) $$\nFrom this relation, it is evident that the observed resonance frequency $\\nu$ is directly proportional to the strength of the external magnetic field, $B_0$. To establish a standardized measure of a nucleus's chemical environment that is independent of the spectrometer's field strength, the chemical shift, $\\delta$, is defined.\n\nThe chemical shift is a relative scale, measured with respect to a reference compound, which by convention for $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR is tetramethylsilane (TMS). The operational definition of chemical shift in parts per million (ppm) is the difference in resonance frequency between the sample nucleus ($\\nu_{\\text{sample}}$) and the reference nucleus ($\\nu_{\\text{TMS}}$), divided by the operating frequency of the spectrometer, which is set by the reference frequency $\\nu_{\\text{TMS}}$. This dimensionless ratio is then multiplied by $10^6$.\n\nThus, we derive the expression connecting the observed resonance frequencies to the chemical shift $\\delta$ as follows:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\nu_{\\text{sample}} - \\nu_{\\text{TMS}}}{\\nu_{\\text{TMS}}} \\times 10^6 $$\nThis is the required expression. The numerator, $\\nu_{\\text{sample}} - \\nu_{\\text{TMS}}$, represents the frequency separation in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, while the denominator, $\\nu_{\\text{TMS}}$, is the spectrometer frequency in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $\\mathrm{MHz}$, as long as the units are consistent). The multiplication by $10^6$ converts the ratio to ppm.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $\\delta$ for the given data.\nThe given frequencies are:\nReference frequency (TMS): $\\nu_{\\text{TMS}} = 400.000\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$\nSample frequency (analyte): $\\nu_{\\text{sample}} = 400.100\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{400.100\\ \\mathrm{MHz} - 400.000\\ \\mathrm{MHz}}{400.000\\ \\mathrm{MHz}} \\times 10^6 $$\nFirst, we calculate the frequency difference:\n$$ \\nu_{\\text{sample}} - \\nu_{\\text{TMS}} = 0.100\\ \\mathrm{MHz} $$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{0.100}{400.000} \\times 10^6 = 0.00025 \\times 10^6 = 250 $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{MHz}$ cancel, resulting in a dimensionless value which is then expressed in ppm.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The frequency difference, $0.100\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$, is known to three significant figures, as the input frequencies are specified to the third decimal place. The reference frequency, $400.000\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$, has six significant figures. The result of the division must therefore be reported to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $250$. To represent this with three significant figures unambiguously, we express it in scientific notation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical shift is $\\delta = 2.50 \\times 10^2\\ \\text{ppm}$. The large positive value is consistent with a hydrogen nucleus in a paramagnetic organometallic hydride, which can experience significant hyperfine (contact and pseudocontact) shifts.",

The analysis is constrained to the sample-noise-limited regime with a fixed detection bandwidth, $\\Delta f$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the quantities of interest. The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the signal amplitude, $V_{\\text{sig}}$, to the root-mean-square (RMS) noise amplitude, $v_{\\text{n}}$.\n$$\nSNR = \\frac{V_{\\text{sig}}}{v_{\\text{n}}}\n$$\nWe will determine the scaling of $V_{\\text{sig}}$ and $v_{\\text{n}}$ with respect to the static magnetic field $B_{0}$ using the provided premises.\n\nThe on-resonance signal amplitude is given to scale as:\n$$\nV_{\\text{sig}} \\propto \\omega_{0} M_{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{0}$ is the Larmor angular frequency and $M_{0}$ is the equilibrium bulk magnetization.\n\nThe problem states two further dependencies:\n1.

It is well-posed, providing a first-order ordinary differential equation with a specified initial condition, which guarantees a unique solution. The language is objective and the problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided. The setup describes a standard and physically realistic NMR experiment (inversion-recovery). Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe relaxation of the longitudinal component of magnetization, $M_z(t)$, toward its equilibrium value, $M_0$, is described as a first-order kinetic process. The governing differential equation, known as the longitudinal Bloch equation (in the absence of radiofrequency fields), is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_z}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{T_1} (M_z(t) - M_0)\n$$\nHere, $T_1$ is the longitudinal relaxation time constant. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we must separate the variables. Let us rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_z}{M_z - M_0} = -\\frac{1}{T_1} dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation. The left side is integrated with respect to $M_z$, and the right side with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{dM_z}{M_z - M_0} = \\int -\\frac{1}{T_1} dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln(|M_z - M_0|) = -\\frac{t}{T_1} + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We determine this constant by applying the initial condition specified in the problem: at $t=0$, the magnetization is inverted, so $M_z(0) = -M_0$. Substituting these values into the integrated equation:\n$$\n\\ln(|-M_0 - M_0|) = -\\frac{0}{T_1} + C\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(|-2M_0|) = C\n$$\nSince $M_0$ represents the magnitude of equilibrium magnetization, it is a positive quantity, $M_0 > 0$. Thus, $|-2M_0| = 2M_0$. The integration constant is:\n$$\nC = \\ln(2M_0)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n\\ln(|M_z - M_0|) = -\\frac{t}{T_1} + \\ln(2M_0)\n$$\nTo solve for $M_z(t)$, we rearrange the logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\ln(|M_z - M_0|) - \\ln(2M_0) = -\\frac{t}{T_1}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|M_z - M_0|}{2M_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{T_1}\n$$\nThe magnetization $M_z(t)$ starts at $-M_0$ and relaxes towards $+M_0$. The value of $M_z(t)$ will be less than $M_0$ for all finite times $t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the term $(M_z - M_0)$ is always negative. We can thus replace $|M_z - M_0|$ with $-(M_z - M_0)$, which is $M_0 - M_z$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0 - M_z}{2M_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{T_1}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{M_0 - M_z}{2M_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we solve for $M_z(t)$:\n$$\nM_0 - M_z = 2M_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-M_z = -M_0 + 2M_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 - 2M_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be factored to give the final form for the time evolution of the longitudinal magnetization:\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 \\left(1 - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires finding the specific time $t > 0$ at which the longitudinal magnetization is zero, i.e., $M_z(t)=0$. This time is often called the null time or null point. We set the derived expression for $M_z(t)$ to zero:\n$$\n0 = M_0 \\left(1 - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince $M_0 \\neq 0$, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$\n1 - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 = 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{T_1}\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{t}{T_1}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-T_1$, we find the expression for the time $t$:\n$$\nt = T_1 \\ln(2)\n$$\nThis is the unique positive time at which the longitudinal magnetization passes through zero during its recovery from full inversion to equilibrium. The result is a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $T_1$ only, as required.",
