            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the vibrational modes of methane, $\\mathrm{CH_4}$, which belongs to the tetrahedral point group $T_d$, and the identification of which modes are infrared (IR) active. This is a standard application of group theory to molecular vibrations. The approach is systematic and begins with the construction of a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, based on the $3N$ Cartesian displacement coordinates of the atoms in the molecule.\n\nFirst, we must determine the characters, $\\chi_{3N}(R)$, of this total representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, for each symmetry class $R$ of the $T_d$ point group. The character for a given class is the product of the number of atoms left unshifted by an operation in that class, $N_R$, and the character of the transformation of a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ under that operation, $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$. The formula is $\\chi_{3N}(R) = N_R \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(R)$. The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH_4}$, so the total number of atoms is $N=5$.\n\nThe classes of the $T_d$ point group are $E$, $8C_3$, $3C_2$, $6S_4$, and $6\\sigma_d$. The order of the group is $h = 1+8+3+6+6=24$.\n\nWe calculate the number of unshifted atoms, $N_R$, for an operation in each class:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $E$: The identity operation leaves all $5$ atoms unchanged. $N_E = 5$.\n    \\item $C_3$: A $C_3$ axis passes through the central carbon atom and one hydrogen atom. Thus, $2$ atoms are unshifted. $N_{C_3} = 2$.\n    \\item $C_2$: A $C_2$ axis passes through the central carbon atom, bisecting two H-C-H angles. Only the carbon atom is unshifted. $N_{C_2} = 1$.\n    \\item $S_4$: An $S_4$ axis is collinear with a $C_2$ axis. The operation involves a rotation by $90^\\circ$ and a reflection. Only the central carbon atom is unshifted. $N_{S_4} = 1$.\n    \\item $\\sigma_d$: A $\\sigma_d$ plane contains the central carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. Thus, $3$ atoms are unshifted. $N_{\\sigma_d} = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNext, we determine the character $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$ for the transformation of a vector $(x,y,z)$ for each class:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $E$: Identity transformation matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(E) = 3$.\n    \\item $C_n$: For a proper rotation by an angle $\\theta$, the character is $1 + 2\\cos(\\theta)$. For $C_3$, $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, so $\\chi_{xyz}(C_3) = 1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$. For $C_2$, $\\theta = 180^\\circ$, so $\\chi_{xyz}(C_2) = 1 + 2\\cos(180^\\circ) = 1 - 2 = -1$.\n    \\item $S_n$: For an improper rotation by an angle $\\theta$, the character is $-1 + 2\\cos(\\theta)$. For $S_4$, $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, so $\\chi_{xyz}(S_4) = -1 + 2\\cos(90^\\circ) = -1 + 0 = -1$.\n    \\item $\\sigma$: A reflection is equivalent to $S_1$, with $\\theta=360^\\circ$ which is not helpful. It is better to consider its matrix representation. Reflection in the $xy$-plane transforms $(x,y,z)$ to $(x,y,-z)$, with a trace of $1+1-1=1$. By symmetry, any reflection plane gives a trace of $1$. So, $\\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d) = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow we can compute the characters for the total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(E) = N_E \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(E) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = N_{C_3} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(C_3) = 2 \\times 0 = 0$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_2) = N_{C_2} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = N_{S_4} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = N_{\\sigma_d} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is thus $\\{15, 0, -1, -1, 3\\}$.\n\nThe total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is a sum of the representations for translational, rotational, and vibrational motions: $\\Gamma_{3N} = \\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$. To find the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, we must subtract the translational and rotational representations from $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n\nFrom the standard character table for $T_d$, the translational modes, which transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$, belong to the $T_2$ irreducible representation. The characters for $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}}$ are $\\chi(T_2) = \\{3, 0, -1, -1, 1\\}$.\nThe rotational modes, which transform as $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$, belong to the $T_1$ irreducible representation. The characters for $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}}$ are $\\chi(T_1) = \\{3, 0, -1, 1, -1\\}$.\n\nThe characters for the vibrational representation, $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}$, are found by subtraction: $\\chi_{\\text{vib}} = \\chi_{3N} - \\chi_{\\text{trans}} - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(E) = 15 - 3 - 3 = 9$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(C_3) = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(C_2) = -1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(S_4) = -1 - (-1) - 1 = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(\\sigma_d) = 3 - 1 - (-1) = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ is $\\{9, 0, 1, -1, 3\\}$.\n\nWe now decompose $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ into the irreducible representations of the $T_d$ group using the reduction formula:\n$n_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\cdot \\chi_{\\text{vib}}(R) \\cdot \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)$, where $n_{\\Gamma}$ is the multiplicity of the irrep $\\Gamma$, $h$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the size of the class $R$, $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(R)$ is the character of the vibrational representation, and $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma$. The character table for $T_d$ is:\n\\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}\n$T_d$ & $E$ & $8C_3$ & $3C_2$ & $6S_4$ & $6\\sigma_d$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$A_1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\\\\n$A_2$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $-1$ \\\\\n$E$ & $2$ & $-1$ & $2$ & $0$ & $0$ \\\\\n$T_1$ & $3$ & $0$ & $-1$ & $1$ & $-1$ \\\\\n$T_2$ & $3$ & $0$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $1$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(1) + 8(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 6(-1)(1) + 6(3)(1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[9+0+3-6+18] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n    \\item $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(1) + 8(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(3)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[9+0+3+6-18] = \\frac{0}{24} = 0$.\n    \\item $n_{E} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(2) + 8(0)(-1) + 3(1)(2) + 6(-1)(0) + 6(3)(0)] = \\frac{1}{24}[18+0+6+0+0] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n    \\item $n_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(3) + 8(0)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(1) + 6(3)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[27+0-3-6-18] = \\frac{0}{24} = 0$.\n    \\item $n_{T_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(3) + 8(0)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(3)(1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[27+0-3+6+18] = \\frac{48}{24} = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThus, the vibrational representation decomposes as $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1 + E + 2T_2$. The multiplicities are $n_{A_1}=1$, $n_{A_2}=0$, $n_E=1$, $n_{T_1}=0$, and $n_{T_2}=2$.\n\nA vibrational mode is IR active if it has the same symmetry as one of the components of the electric dipole moment, which transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. In the $T_d$ point group, $(x,y,z)$ transform as the $T_2$ irreducible representation. Therefore, only vibrational modes of $T_2$ symmetry are IR active.\nFrom our decomposition, there are two distinct sets of modes with $T_2$ symmetry ($2T_2$). Each of these corresponds to a unique fundamental frequency that will appear in the infrared spectrum. Hence, the number of distinct IR-active fundamentals, $n_{\\mathrm{IR}}$, is $2$.\n\nThe final result is the set of integers $(n_{A_1}, n_{A_2}, n_{E}, n_{T_1}, n_{T_2}, n_{\\mathrm{IR}})$, which is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2)$.",
