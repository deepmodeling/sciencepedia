It is a rigorous, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the term symbols for a $p^2$ electronic configuration using first principles. This configuration consists of two equivalent electrons in a subshell defined by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$.\n\nFirst, we enumerate the possible single-electron states, or spin-orbitals. For a $p$ electron, $l=1$, so the magnetic orbital quantum number $m_l$ can take values $\\{-1, 0, +1\\}$. The spin quantum number is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$, so the magnetic spin quantum number $m_s$ can take values $\\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This gives $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ distinct spin-orbitals, which we can denote by the pair $(m_l, m_s)$:\n$$\n(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\n$$\n\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, the two electrons must occupy two different spin-orbitals because they are identical fermions. The total number of ways to choose $2$ distinct spin-orbitals from the available $6$ is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n$$\nThus, there are $15$ allowed microstates for the $p^2$ configuration. For each microstate, we determine the total magnetic quantum numbers $M_L = m_{l,1} + m_{l,2}$ and $M_S = m_{s,1} + m_{s,2}$. We systematically construct all $15$ pairs of spin-orbitals and the corresponding $(M_L, M_S)$ values.\n\nThe microstates are:\n1.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+1=2, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (2, 0)$\n2.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (1, 1)$\n3.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n4.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (0, 1)$\n5.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n6.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n7.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (1, -1)$\n8.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n9.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (0, -1)$\n10. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0+0=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n11. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (-1, 1)$\n12. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n13. $\\{(0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n14. $\\{(0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (-1, -1)$\n15. $\\{(-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=-1-1=-2, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-2, 0)$\n\nWe summarize the number of microstates for each $(M_L, M_S)$ combination in a table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S & +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n+2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n+1 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe total number of states is $1+1+2+1+1+3+1+1+2+1+1 = 15$, which matches our initial calculation.\n\nNow, we identify the $L$-$S$ terms by \"peeling off\" sets of microstates corresponding to each term, starting from the highest values of $L$ and $S$.\n\n1.  The maximum value of $M_L$ is $2$, which occurs only for the microstate with $M_S=0$. This implies the existence of a term with $L=2$. Since the only corresponding $M_S$ value is $0$, the total spin for this term must be $S=0$. This identifies the term ${}^{2S+1}L = {}^{2(0)+1}D = {}^1D$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (5)(1) = 5$ microstates, corresponding to $(M_L, M_S) = (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0)$. Removing these $5$ microstates from our table leaves:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S & +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n+1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0  & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n2.  In the remaining table, the maximum value of $M_L$ is $1$. The microstates with $M_L=1$ possess $M_S$ values of $+1, 0,$ and $-1$. This implies the presence of a term with $L=1$. The range of $M_S$ from $-1$ to $+1$ indicates a total spin of $S=1$. This identifies the term ${}^{2S+1}L = {}^{2(1)+1}P = {}^3P$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (3)(3) = 9$ microstates, a rectangular block for $M_L \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Removing one microstate for each of these $9$ combinations leaves:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S & +1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n3.  Only one microstate remains, with $(M_L, M_S) = (0,0)$. This must belong to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$. This identifies the final term ${}^{2S+1}L = {}^{2(0)+1}S = {}^1S$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (1)(1) = 1$ microstate.\n\nAfter removing all terms, the table is empty. The derived terms for the $p^2$ configuration are therefore ${}^1D$, ${}^3P$, and ${}^1S$. Each term appears once, so their multiplicities are all $1$.\n\nFinally, we perform the quantitative check by summing the degeneracies of the derived terms:\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = \\sum (2S+1)(2L+1)\n$$\nThe sum is over the terms ${}^1D$ ($L=2, S=0$), ${}^3P$ ($L=1, S=1$), and ${}^1S$ ($L=0, S=0$).\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = \\underbrace{(2(0)+1)(2(2)+1)}_{{}^1D} + \\underbrace{(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1)}_{{}^3P} + \\underbrace{(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1)}_{{}^1S}\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = (1)(5) + (3)(3) + (1)(1)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = 5 + 9 + 1 = 15\n$$\nThis value matches the total number of Pauli-allowed microstates, $\\binom{6}{2}=15$, confirming the completeness and correctness of our derivation. The problem asks for this value.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It constitutes a standard, albeit multipart, exercise in the quantum theory of atomic structure. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of physical principles. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts, as requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of allowed LS terms for the $d^2$ configuration.\n\nWe consider two equivalent electrons in a $d$ subshell. For each electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the spin quantum number is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction $\\Psi$ for a system of two identical fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two particles. The total wavefunction can be approximated as a product of a spatial part, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$, and a spin part, $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$, such that $\\Psi = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$. For the total wavefunction $\\Psi$ to be antisymmetric, one of two conditions must be met:\n1. $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is symmetric and $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$ is antisymmetric.\n2. $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is antisymmetric and $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$ is symmetric.\n\nFirst, we determine the symmetry of the spin part, $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$. The total spin angular momentum $S$ is obtained by coupling the individual spins $s_1=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $s_2=\\frac{1}{2}$. The possible values for $S$ are $S \\in \\{|s_1-s_2|, \\dots, s_1+s_2\\}$, which yields $S=0$ and $S=1$.\n- For $S=1$, the spin state is a triplet with multiplicity $2S+1=3$. The spin wavefunctions are symmetric under particle exchange.\n- For $S=0$, the spin state is a singlet with multiplicity $2S+1=1$. The spin wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange.\n\nNext, we determine the symmetry of the spatial part, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$. The total orbital angular momentum $L$ is obtained by coupling the individual orbital momenta $l_1=2$ and $l_2=2$. The possible values for $L$ are $L \\in \\{|l_1-l_2|, \\dots, l_1+l_2\\}$, which yields $L=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. For two equivalent electrons (i.e., having the same principal quantum number $n$ and orbital quantum number $l$), the spatial wavefunction's symmetry under particle exchange is given by the factor $(-1)^L$.\n- For $L=0, 2, 4$, the spatial wavefunctions are symmetric.\n- For $L=1, 3$, the spatial wavefunctions are antisymmetric.\n\nNow, we combine the spatial and spin parts according to the Pauli principle:\n- Symmetric spatial part ($L=0, 2, 4$) must be paired with the antisymmetric spin part ($S=0$, singlet). This yields the terms:\n  - $L=0, S=0 \\implies {}^1S$\n  - $L=2, S=0 \\implies {}^1D$\n  - $L=4, S=0 \\implies {}^1G$\n- Antisymmetric spatial part ($L=1, 3$) must be paired with the symmetric spin part ($S=1$, triplet). This yields the terms:\n  - $L=1, S=1 \\implies {}^3P$\n  - $L=3, S=1 \\implies {}^3F$\n\nThus, the complete set of allowed LS terms for the $d^2$ configuration is ${}^1S$, ${}^3P$, ${}^1D$, ${}^3F$, and ${}^1G$.\n\nPart 2: Inference of LS terms for the $d^8$ configuration using particle-hole symmetry.\n\nA filled $d$ subshell, or $d^{10}$ configuration, contains $10$ electrons. Its total orbital angular momentum is $L=0$ and its total spin angular momentum is $S=0$, corresponding to a ${}^1S_0$ term. This state is spherically symmetric and non-degenerate.\n\nA $d^8$ configuration can be conceptualized as a filled $d^{10}$ shell with two electrons missing, which are termed \"holes\". The particle-hole symmetry principle states that the set of allowed LS terms for a configuration of $k$ holes in a subshell is identical to the set of allowed terms for a configuration of $k$ electrons in that same subshell.\n\nTo justify this, consider the total angular momentum operators for the filled shell, $\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{total}}$ and $\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{total}}$. These are conserved quantities and sum to zero:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathbf{L}_{d^{10}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\mathbf{l}_i = 0 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathbf{S}_{d^{10}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\mathbf{s}_i = 0 $$\nWe can partition the sum over all $10$ electrons into a sum over the $8$ electrons present in the $d^8$ configuration and a sum over the $2$ electrons that constitute the holes.\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_{d^{10}} = \\mathbf{L}_{d^8} + \\mathbf{L}_{\\text{2 holes}} = 0 \\implies \\mathbf{L}_{d^8} = -\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{2 holes}} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{d^{10}} = \\mathbf{S}_{d^8} + \\mathbf{S}_{\\text{2 holes}} = 0 \\implies \\mathbf{S}_{d^8} = -\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{2 holes}} $$\nThe quantum numbers $L$ and $S$ are magnitudes of these vector operators, and thus must be non-negative. From the relations above, it follows that the possible values for the quantum number $L$ for the $d^8$ configuration must be identical to those for the two-hole configuration ($L_{d^8} = L_{\\text{2 holes}}$), and similarly for the spin quantum number ($S_{d^8} = S_{\\text{2 holes}}$).\n\nA hole in a $d$ subshell behaves as a quasiparticle with the same orbital angular momentum ($l=2$) and spin ($s=\\frac{1}{2}$) as the electron it replaces. Therefore, determining the allowed terms for two holes is equivalent to determining the terms for two equivalent $d$ electrons. The Pauli principle applies to the two indistinguishable holes in the same manner it applies to two indistinguishable electrons.\n\nConsequently, the calculation for the allowed $(L,S)$ pairs for two holes is identical to the calculation performed in Part 1 for two electrons. The set of LS terms for the $d^8$ configuration must therefore be identical to that for the $d^2$ configuration. The allowed terms are ${}^1S$, ${}^3P$, ${}^1D$, ${}^3F$, and ${}^1G$. The problem statement correctly notes that spin-orbit coupling inverts the energy ordering of the $J$ levels for shells that are more than half-filled (Hund's third rule), but this does not alter the set of allowed $(L,S)$ pairs or the corresponding degeneracies.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the difference in total degeneracies, $\\Delta$.\n\nThe quantity $\\Delta$ is defined as\n$$ \\Delta \\equiv \\sum_{\\text{all terms of }d^{2}}\\ \\sum_{J} (2J+1)\\ -\\ \\sum_{\\text{all terms of }d^{8}}\\ \\sum_{J} (2J+1). $$\nFor any given LS term, the sum of the degeneracies of all its fine-structure levels $J$ is equal to the total degeneracy of the term itself:\n$$ \\sum_{J=|L-S|}^{L+S} (2J+1) = (2L+1)(2S+1). $$\nThis identity holds because the coupling of $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ merely redistributes the total number of states within the term among the various $J$ levels; it does not create or destroy states.\n\nTherefore, the expression for $\\Delta$ simplifies to the difference between the total number of microstates for the $d^2$ configuration and the total number of microstates for the $d^8$ configuration. The total number of microstates for a configuration of $n$ equivalent electrons in a subshell with a total capacity of $N_{max}$ states (where $N_{max} = 2(2l+1)$) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N_{max}}{n}$.\n\nFor a $d$ subshell, $l=2$, so the maximum capacity is $N_{max} = 2(2(2)+1) = 10$.\n\nFor the $d^2$ configuration, we have $n=2$ electrons. The total number of microstates is\n$$ \\sum_{\\text{all terms of }d^{2}}\\ \\sum_{J} (2J+1) = \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45. $$\nThis result can be verified by summing the degeneracies of the terms found in Part 1: ${}^1S$ (1) + ${}^3P$ (9) + ${}^1D$ (5) + ${}^3F$ (21) + ${}^1G$ (9) = $1+9+5+21+9 = 45$.\n\nFor the $d^8$ configuration, we have $n=8$ electrons. The total number of microstates is\n$$ \\sum_{\\text{all terms of }d^{8}}\\ \\sum_{J} (2J+1) = \\binom{10}{8}. $$\nUsing the property of binomial coefficients that $\\binom{N}{k} = \\binom{N}{N-k}$, we find\n$$ \\binom{10}{8} = \\binom{10}{10-8} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45. $$\nThis confirms the result of the particle-hole symmetry argument: the total number of microstates for $d^8$ is the same as for $d^2$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = (45) - (45) = 0. $$\nThe difference is exactly zero.",

All principles are standard.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary numerical data and uncertainties to perform the requested calculations. The objectives are clearly stated and lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is chemically and physically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe energy shift $\\Delta E_{SO}$ of a level with total angular momentum quantum number $J$ due to the spin-orbit interaction $\\hat{H}_{SO} = A(\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S})$ within the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{SO}(J) = \\frac{A}{2} [J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)]\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant, and $L$ and $S$ are the total orbital and spin angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively. For a $^{3}P$ term, the multiplicity is $2S+1=3$, which implies $S=1$. The term symbol 'P' corresponds to $L=1$. The possible values for $J$ are given by the angular momentum addition rule, $J = |L-S|, \\dots, L+S$, which for this case are $|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1$, yielding $J=0, 1, 2$.\n\nThe energy separation between two adjacent levels $J$ and $J-1$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{J, J-1} = E(J) - E(J-1) = \\Delta E_{SO}(J) - \\Delta E_{SO}(J-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{J, J-1} = \\frac{A}{2} [J(J+1) - (J-1)J] = \\frac{A}{2} [J^2+J - J^2+J] = AJ\n$$\nThis result is the Landé interval rule, which states that the energy splitting between adjacent levels is proportional to the larger of the two $J$ values.\n\n**1) Validation of the Landé Interval Rule**\n\nFrom the Landé interval rule, we expect the following relationship between the two energy spacings in the $^{3}P_{0,1,2}$ multiplet:\n- $\\Delta E_{1,0} = E(1) - E(0) = A \\cdot 1 = A$\n- $\\Delta E_{2,1} = E(2) - E(1) = A \\cdot 2 = 2A$\n\nThe rule thus predicts a specific ratio for these intervals:\n$$\nR_{th} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{2,1}}{\\Delta E_{1,0}} = \\frac{2A}{A} = 2\n$$\nWe must check if the experimental data are consistent with this theoretical ratio of $2$, accounting for the propagation of uncertainties.\n\nFirst, calculate the experimental intervals from the given data:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{1,0} = 15020.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 15000.00 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 20.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{2,1} = 15059.80 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 15020.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 39.62 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe experimental ratio is:\n$$\nR_{exp} = \\frac{39.62}{20.18} \\approx 1.96333\n$$\nNext, we propagate the uncertainties. Let $y_J = E(J)$ be the measured energies with a uniform uncertainty $u_E = 0.12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The intervals are $D = y_1 - y_0$ and $N = y_2 - y_1$. The ratio is $R = N/D$. Since the initial measurements $y_0, y_1, y_2$ are uncorrelated, the uncertainty $u(R)$ is found using partial derivatives:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_0}\\right)^2 u_E^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_1}\\right)^2 u_E^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_2}\\right)^2 u_E^2\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_0}\\left(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{y_1 - y_0}\\right) = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = \\frac{N}{D^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_1} = \\frac{-1(y_1 - y_0) - (y_2 - y_1)(1)}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = -\\frac{y_1 - y_0 + y_2 - y_1}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = -\\frac{y_2-y_0}{D^2} = -\\frac{N+D}{D^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_2} = \\frac{1}{y_1 - y_0} = \\frac{1}{D}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty formula:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = u_E^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{N}{D^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{N+D}{D^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{D}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{u_E^2}{D^4} [N^2 + (N+D)^2 + D^2]\n$$\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{u_E^2}{D^4} [2N^2 + 2ND + 2D^2]\n$$\nUsing the numerical values $N=39.62$, $D=20.18$, and $u_E=0.12$:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{(0.12)^2}{(20.18)^4} [2(39.62)^2 + 2(39.62)(20.18) + 2(20.18)^2]\n$$\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{0.0144}{(20.18)^4} [3139.4888 + 1599.0632 + 814.4648] = \\frac{0.0144}{165836.4} [5553.0168] \\approx 4.819 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\nu(R) = \\sqrt{4.819 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.02195\n$$\nThus, the experimental ratio is $R_{exp} = 1.9633 \\pm 0.0220$. The $1\\sigma$ confidence interval for this ratio is $[1.9413, 1.9853]$. The theoretical value of $2$ lies outside this interval. However, the deviation from theory is $|2 - 1.9633| = 0.0367$. The significance of this deviation, or the Z-score, is the deviation divided by the standard uncertainty:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{|R_{th} - R_{exp}|}{u(R)} = \\frac{0.0367}{0.02195} \\approx 1.67\n$$\nA deviation of $1.67$ standard deviations is not considered statistically significant at conventional levels (e.g., $p=0.05$, which requires $Z > 1.96$). Therefore, we conclude that the data are consistent with the Landé interval rule within the statistical limits of the measurement uncertainties.\n\n**2) Estimation of the Spin-Orbit Constant A**\n\nThe problem requires constructing two estimates of $A$ and combining them.\nEstimate 1, from the $J=0,1$ interval:\n$$\nA_1 = \\Delta E_{1,0} = 20.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe uncertainty $u(A_1)$ is obtained by propagating the uncertainties of $E(1)$ and $E(0)$:\n$$\nu(A_1)^2 = u(E(1))^2 + u(E(0))^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.12)^2 = 2 \\cdot (0.12)^2 = 0.0288 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nSo, $u(A_1) = \\sqrt{0.0288} = 0.12\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.1697 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nEstimate 2, from the $J=1,2$ interval:\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{\\Delta E_{2,1}}{2} = \\frac{39.62}{2} = 19.81 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe uncertainty $u(A_2)$ is:\n$$\nu(A_2)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 u(\\Delta E_{2,1})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} [u(E(2))^2 + u(E(1))^2] = \\frac{1}{4}[2 \\cdot (0.12)^2] = \\frac{1}{2}(0.12)^2 = 0.0072 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nSo, $u(A_2) = \\sqrt{0.0072} = \\frac{0.12}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.08485 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe two estimates are $A_1 = 20.18 \\pm 0.1697 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $A_2 = 19.81 \\pm 0.08485 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Note that these estimates are statistically correlated as they both depend on $E(1)$. However, the problem explicitly instructs to combine them using the inverse-variance weighted mean, a method standard for independent variables. We proceed as directed.\n\nThe weights $w_i$ are the inverse of the variances:\n$$\nw_1 = \\frac{1}{u(A_1)^2} = \\frac{1}{0.0288} = \\frac{1}{2(0.12)^2}\n$$\n$$\nw_2 = \\frac{1}{u(A_2)^2} = \\frac{1}{0.0072} = \\frac{2}{(0.12)^2}\n$$\nThe weighted mean $\\bar{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\bar{A} = \\frac{w_1 A_1 + w_2 A_2}{w_1 + w_2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2(0.12)^2} A_1 + \\frac{2}{(0.12)^2} A_2}{\\frac{1}{2(0.12)^2} + \\frac{2}{(0.12)^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} A_1 + 2A_2}{\\frac{1}{2} + 2} = \\frac{A_1 + 4A_2}{5}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{A} = \\frac{20.18 + 4(19.81)}{5} = \\frac{20.18 + 79.24}{5} = \\frac{99.42}{5} = 19.884 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe variance of the weighted mean is $u(\\bar{A})^2 = \\frac{1}{w_1+w_2}$:\n$$\nu(\\bar{A})^2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{2(0.12)^2}} = \\frac{2(0.12)^2}{5} = \\frac{2(0.0144)}{5} = 0.00576 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nThe combined standard uncertainty is:\n$$\nu(\\bar{A}) = \\sqrt{0.00576} = 0.07589466... \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires reporting $A$ and its uncertainty $u$, both rounded to four significant figures.\n$A = 19.884 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\rightarrow 19.88 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$u = 0.07589466... \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\rightarrow 0.07589 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nThe final best estimate is $19.88 \\pm 0.07589 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.",
