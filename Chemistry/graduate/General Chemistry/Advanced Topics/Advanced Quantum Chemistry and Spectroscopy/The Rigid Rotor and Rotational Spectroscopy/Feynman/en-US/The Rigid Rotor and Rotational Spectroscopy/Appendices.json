The rigid rotor model provides an elegant and simple description of molecular rotation, but real chemical bonds are not infinitely stiff. This practice challenges you to move beyond the ideal case by quantifying the limits of this approximation . You will derive a criterion to determine the rotational quantum number $J$ at which centrifugal distortion—the stretching of the bond at high rotational speeds—becomes significant, offering a concrete understanding of a model's domain of validity.",

            "problem": "A diatomic molecule can be modeled as a rigid rotor for low rotational quantum numbers, but at higher rotation the bond stretches and the rigid rotor approximation fails. Consider the ground-vibrational-state rotational spectrum of hydrogen chloride with chlorine-35 isotope, denoted $^{1}\\mathrm{H}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$. The experimentally determined rotational constant and quartic centrifugal distortion constant (both expressed in spectroscopic wavenumber units) are $B = 10.59341\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $D = 5.30 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from the standard description of a semi-rigid diatomic rotor in rotational spectroscopy—where the leading-order effect of centrifugal distortion is included in the energy through the smallest anharmonic correction consistent with rotational symmetry—derive a quantitative criterion for when the rigid rotor approximation breaks down by comparing the magnitude of the centrifugal distortion correction to the magnitude of the rigid-rotor term. Then, using this criterion with a tolerable relative error level of $\\varepsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$, determine the smallest non-negative integer rotational quantum number $J$ at which the absolute magnitude of the centrifugal distortion correction is at least $\\varepsilon$ times the rigid-rotor term, for $^{1}\\mathrm{H}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ with the constants given above.\n\nReport your final answer as the smallest integer $J$ that satisfies the criterion, as a pure number with no units.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in molecular spectroscopy and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule, treated as a semi-rigid rotor, can be expressed in spectroscopic wavenumber units ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) as a function of the rotational quantum number $J$. Including the first-order correction for centrifugal distortion, the rotational term values $\\tilde{F}(J)$ are given by the expression:\n$$ \\tilde{F}(J) = B J(J+1) - D J^2(J+1)^2 $$\nwhere $J$ is a non-negative integer ($J=0, 1, 2, \\dots$), $B$ is the rotational constant corresponding to the rigid rotor model, and $D$ is the quartic centrifugal distortion constant. The first term, $B J(J+1)$, represents the energy of a perfect rigid rotor. The second term, $-D J^2(J+1)^2$, is the leading-order correction that accounts for the stretching of the bond as the molecule rotates at higher angular velocities.\n\nThe problem requires establishing a criterion for the breakdown of the rigid rotor approximation. This occurs when the centrifugal distortion correction becomes a significant fraction of the rigid rotor energy. The problem specifies this significance level with a tolerable relative error $\\varepsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$. The criterion is met when the absolute magnitude of the centrifugal distortion term is at least $\\varepsilon$ times the absolute magnitude of the rigid rotor term.\n\nLet us formalize this condition. The rigid rotor term is $E_{rig} = B J(J+1)$ and the centrifugal distortion correction is $E_{dist} = -D J^2(J+1)^2$. The criterion is thus:\n$$ |E_{dist}| \\ge \\varepsilon |E_{rig}| $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the terms yields:\n$$ |-D J^2(J+1)^2| \\ge \\varepsilon |B J(J+1)| $$\nThe constants $B$ and $D$ are positive, and for any non-negative integer $J$, the quantity $J(J+1)$ is also non-negative. Therefore, the absolute value signs can be removed without loss of generality.\n$$ D J^2(J+1)^2 \\ge \\varepsilon B J(J+1) $$\nFor the non-rotating state $J=0$, both sides of the inequality are zero ($0 \\ge 0$), which is trivially true but physically meaningless for assessing the breakdown of a rotational model. The concept of centrifugal distortion applies only to rotating molecules, i.e., states with $J > 0$. For $J > 0$, the quantity $J(J+1)$ is strictly positive, and we can divide both sides of the inequality by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ D J(J+1) \\ge \\varepsilon B $$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to find the minimum value of $J$ for which the condition is met.\n$$ J(J+1) \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon B}{D} $$\nThis can be written as a quadratic inequality in $J$:\n$$ J^2 + J - \\frac{\\varepsilon B}{D} \\ge 0 $$\nTo find for which values of $J$ this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $J^2 + J - \\frac{\\varepsilon B}{D} = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $J = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, the roots are:\n$$ J = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon B}{D}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\varepsilon B}{D}}}{2} $$\nSince the rotational quantum number $J$ must be non-negative, we are interested only in the positive root, which we denote $J_{crit}$:\n$$ J_{crit} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\varepsilon B}{D}}}{2} $$\nThe inequality $J^2 + J - \\frac{\\varepsilon B}{D} \\ge 0$ is satisfied for all $J \\ge J_{crit}$. The problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer $J$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$B = 10.59341\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$D = 5.30 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\varepsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n\nFirst, we compute the term inside the square root:\n$$ \\frac{4\\varepsilon B}{D} = \\frac{4 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (10.59341)}{(5.30 \\times 10^{-4})} = \\frac{0.4237364}{5.30 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 799.50264 $$\nNow, we calculate $J_{crit}$:\n$$ J_{crit} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 799.50264}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{800.50264}}{2} $$\nThe square root is approximately $\\sqrt{800.50264} \\approx 28.293158$.\n$$ J_{crit} \\approx \\frac{-1 + 28.293158}{2} = \\frac{27.293158}{2} \\approx 13.646579 $$\nWe seek the smallest integer $J$ such that $J \\ge J_{crit}$. Given $J_{crit} \\approx 13.647$, the smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $J=14$.\n\nTo verify, we can check the ratio $\\frac{D J(J+1)}{B}$ for $J=13$ and $J=14$.\nFor $J=13$:\n$$ \\frac{D \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14}{B} = \\frac{(5.30 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 182}{10.59341} = \\frac{0.09646}{10.59341} \\approx 0.009106 $$\nThis value is less than $\\varepsilon = 0.01$.\nFor $J=14$:\n$$ \\frac{D \\cdot 14 \\cdot 15}{B} = \\frac{(5.30 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 210}{10.59341} = \\frac{0.1113}{10.59341} \\approx 0.010507 $$\nThis value is greater than $\\varepsilon = 0.01$.\nThe calculation is confirmed.
