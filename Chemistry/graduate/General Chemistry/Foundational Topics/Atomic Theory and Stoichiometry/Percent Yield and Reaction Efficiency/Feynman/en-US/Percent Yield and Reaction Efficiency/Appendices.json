            "introduction": "The concept of percent yield extends beyond simple stoichiometry to the intrinsic thermodynamic limits of a reaction. For reversible processes, the reaction does not proceed to full completion but rather reaches a state of chemical equilibrium. This exercise provides foundational practice in deriving the equilibrium-limited yield from first principles, connecting the macroscopic concept of yield to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_p$. Mastering this derivation  is crucial for predicting the maximum possible conversion under specific conditions and understanding the factors that govern reaction efficiency at a fundamental level.",

The stoichiometry is $1:1$. Initially, $n_{A,0}$ moles of $A$ and $n_{P,0}$ moles of $P$ are present, with no other species. Define the initial mole ratio $r \\equiv \\dfrac{n_{P,0}}{n_{A,0}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a sound, well-posed problem in chemical thermodynamics. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe gas-phase isomerization reaction is given by:\n$$A \\rightleftharpoons P$$\nThe stoichiometry is $1:1$, which implies that for every mole of reactant $A$ consumed, one mole of product $P$ is formed. The total number of moles of gas in the closed system, $n_{\\text{tot}}$, therefore remains constant throughout the reaction.\n\nLet $\\xi$ be the extent of reaction at equilibrium, defined as the number of moles of $A$ that have reacted to form $P$. We construct an Initial-Change-Equilibrium (ICE) table to describe the molar amounts of each species.\nThe initial moles are $n_{A,0}$ for species $A$ and $n_{P,0}$ for species $P$. We are given the initial mole ratio $r \\equiv \\dfrac{n_{P,0}}{n_{A,0}}$, so we can write $n_{P,0} = r \\cdot n_{A,0}$.\n\nThe molar amounts at each stage are:\n- **Initial:**\n  - $n_A = n_{A,0}$\n  - $n_P = n_{P,0} = r \\cdot n_{A,0}$\n- **Change:**\n  - $\\Delta n_A = -\\xi$\n  - $\\Delta n_P = +\\xi$\n- **Equilibrium:**\n  - $n_{A,eq} = n_{A,0} - \\xi$\n  - $n_{P,eq} = n_{P,0} + \\xi = r \\cdot n_{A,0} + \\xi$\n\nThe total moles of gas at equilibrium, $n_{\\text{tot},eq}$, is the sum of the moles of the individual components:\n$$n_{\\text{tot},eq} = n_{A,eq} + n_{P,eq} = (n_{A,0} - \\xi) + (r \\cdot n_{A,0} + \\xi) = n_{A,0} + r \\cdot n_{A,0} = n_{A,0}(1+r)$$\nAs expected, this is equal to the initial total moles, $n_{A,0} + n_{P,0}$.\n\nFor an ideal gas mixture, the partial pressure $p_i$ of a component $i$ is given by Dalton's law: $p_i = y_i P_{\\text{tot}}$, where $y_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ and $P_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total pressure. The mole fraction $y_i$ is defined as $y_i = \\dfrac{n_i}{n_{\\text{tot}}}$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the partial pressures are:\n$$p_{A,eq} = y_{A,eq} P_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{n_{A,eq}}{n_{\\text{tot},eq}} P_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{n_{A,0} - \\xi}{n_{A,0}(1+r)} P_{\\text{tot}}$$\n$$p_{P,eq} = y_{P,eq} P_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{n_{P,eq}}{n_{\\text{tot},eq}} P_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{r \\cdot n_{A,0} + \\xi}{n_{A,0}(1+r)} P_{\\text{tot}}$$\n\nThe equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures, $K_p$, is defined as:\n$$K_p = \\frac{p_{P,eq}}{p_{A,eq}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the equilibrium partial pressures:\n$$K_p = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{r \\cdot n_{A,0} + \\xi}{n_{A,0}(1+r)} P_{\\text{tot}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{n_{A,0} - \\xi}{n_{A,0}(1+r)} P_{\\text{tot}} \\right)}$$\nThe terms $P_{\\text{tot}}$ and $n_{A,0}(1+r)$ cancel out from the numerator and denominator. This demonstrates that for a reaction with no change in the total moles of gas ($\\Delta n_g = 0$), the position of equilibrium is independent of the total pressure $P_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nThe expression for $K_p$ simplifies to:\n$$K_p = \\frac{r \\cdot n_{A,0} + \\xi}{n_{A,0} - \\xi}$$\n\nThe problem requires an expression for the percent yield of $P$, which is defined as the ratio of moles of $A$ converted at equilibrium ($\\xi$) to the initial moles of $A$ ($n_{A,0}$). Let us denote this yield by $Y$.\n$$Y \\equiv \\frac{\\xi}{n_{A,0}}$$\nWe rearrange the expression for $K_p$ to solve for $Y$. First, we divide the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side by $n_{A,0}$:\n$$K_p = \\frac{\\frac{r \\cdot n_{A,0}}{n_{A,0}} + \\frac{\\xi}{n_{A,0}}}{\\frac{n_{A,0}}{n_{A,0}} - \\frac{\\xi}{n_{A,0}}} = \\frac{r + Y}{1 - Y}$$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $Y$:\n$$K_p (1 - Y) = r + Y$$\n$$K_p - K_p Y = r + Y$$\n$$K_p - r = Y + K_p Y$$\n$$K_p - r = Y(1 + K_p)$$\nIsolating $Y$ gives the final expression for the yield:\n$$Y = \\frac{K_p - r}{1 + K_p}$$\nThis expression for the yield $Y$ is a function only of the equilibrium constant $K_p$ and the initial mole ratio $r$. As demonstrated in the derivation, it is independent of the total pressure $P_{\\text{tot}}$. The condition $K_p > r$ given in the problem ensures that the yield $Y$ is a positive quantity, which is physically necessary.",

This dependency must be correctly handled when evaluating the derivative with respect to $R$.\n\n2.  Numerically estimate the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_{i}}$ at the nominal point $(0, 0, T_{0}, R_{0})$ using a second-order central finite difference scheme. For each input $u_{i}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_{i}} \\approx \\frac{y(\\dots, u_{i,0} + h_{i}, \\dots) - y(\\dots, u_{i,0} - h_{i}, \\dots)}{2h_{i}}\n    $$\n    where $u_{i,0}$ is the nominal value of the input and $h_i$ is the corresponding specified step size ($h_{\\ln f}$, $h_T$, or $h_R$). For each derivative, only one input is perturbed while the others are held at their nominal values. For example, to find $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial T}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial T} \\approx \\frac{\\text{calculate\\_yield}(0, 0, T_{0}+h_{T}, R_{0}) - \\text{calculate\\_yield}(0, 0, T_{0}-h_{T}, R_{0})}{2h_{T}}\n    $$\n\n3.  With the partial derivatives computed, calculate the unscaled variance contributions $V_{i}$ using the provided standard deviations $\\sigma_{u_{i}}$.\n\n4.  Sum the contributions to find the total approximate variance, $\\sum V_{j}$.\n\n5.  Calculate the normalized variance contributions $p_{i} = V_{i} / \\sum V_{j}$.\n\n6.  This procedure is repeated for each test case specified in the problem statement. The final results are formatted as requested. The implementation will use `numpy` for numerical operations and `scipy.integrate` for the ODE solution.",
