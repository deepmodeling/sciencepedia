We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system under consideration is a continuous-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system described by the state-space equation $\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)$. The state vector $x(t)$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which implies the dimension of the state space is $n=2$. The input $u(t)$ is a scalar, $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The system matrices are given as:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to determine the controllability of the system. A fundamental result in control theory, the Kalman rank condition, states that an LTI system is completely state controllable if and only if its controllability matrix has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}(C) = n$.\n\nThe problem directs us to first construct a basis for the reachable subspace. The reachable subspace, $\\mathcal{R}$, is the set of all states that can be reached from the origin in finite time. For an LTI system, this subspace is spanned by the columns of the controllability matrix. This subspace is also characterized as the smallest $A$-invariant subspace containing the image of $B$, denoted $\\text{Im}(B)$. It is given by the span of the vectors generated by repeated application of $A$ to the columns of $B$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\text{span}\\{B, AB, A^2B, \\dots, A^{n-1}B\\}\n$$\nFor this problem, the dimension of the state space is $n=2$. Therefore, the reachable subspace is spanned by the column vectors of $B$ and $AB$. Let us compute these vectors.\n\nThe first vector is the column of the matrix $B$:\n$$\nv_1 = B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe second vector is obtained by applying the state matrix $A$ to the vector $v_1$:\n$$\nv_2 = AB = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (1)(1) + (0)(1) \\\\ (0)(1) + (2)(1) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe reachable subspace $\\mathcal{R}$ is therefore $\\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2\\} = \\text{span}\\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\}$.\n\nTo form a basis for this subspace, we must verify that the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent. We check if there exists a non-zero scalar $k$ such that $v_2 = k v_1$.\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = k \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n$1 = k \\cdot 1 \\implies k=1$\n$2 = k \\cdot 1 \\implies k=2$\nThe requirement that $k=1$ and $k=2$ simultaneously is a contradiction. Thus, the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent. Since we have a set of two linearly independent vectors in a $2$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, they form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means the reachable subspace is the entire state space, $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe controllability matrix $C$ is constructed by concatenating these basis vectors:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe final task is to determine the rank of $C$, which we denote by $r$. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its columns. As we have already established that the two columns of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $C$ are linearly independent, the rank of $C$ must be $2$.\n\nAn alternative method to determine the rank of a square matrix is to compute its determinant. A matrix has full rank if and only if its determinant is non-zero.\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\det\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = (1)(2) - (1)(1) = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nSince $\\det(C) = 1 \\neq 0$, the matrix $C$ is of full rank. The rank of $C$ is $r=2$. Because the rank of the controllability matrix ($r=2$) is equal to the dimension of the state space ($n=2$), the system is completely controllable. The problem asks for the rank value $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2694383"}, {"introduction": "In engineering practice, we often encounter systems with tunable parameters that can alter their dynamic behavior.
