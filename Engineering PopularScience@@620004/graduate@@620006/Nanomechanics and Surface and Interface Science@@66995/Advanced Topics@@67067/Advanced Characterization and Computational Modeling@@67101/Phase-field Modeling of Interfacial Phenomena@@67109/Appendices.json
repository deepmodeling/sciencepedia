Let $\\,\\Delta x0\\,$ be a uniform grid spacing, and denote by $\\,\\phi_1\\,$ the known value of $\\,\\phi\\,$ at the first interior node located at $\\,x=\\Delta x\\,$. Introduce one geometric ghost unknown $\\,\\phi_{-1}\\,$ located at $\\,x=-\\Delta x\\,$ for a second-order approximation:\n- Approximate the wall-normal derivative by the centered difference\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x}.\n$$\n- Approximate the wall value by the centered average\n$$\n\\phi_w \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\phi_1 + \\phi_{-1}}{2}.\n$$\n\nUsing the above, enforce the geometric contact-angle condition to determine $\\,\\phi_{-1}\\,$ from $\\,\\phi_1\\,$, $\\,\\varepsilon\\,$, $\\,\\Delta x\\,$, and $\\,\\theta\\,$. To robustly solve the resulting nonlinear equation, it is advantageous to reparameterize by the average $\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} := \\phi_w = (\\phi_1+\\phi_{-1})/2\\,$ and eliminate $\\,\\phi_{-1}\\,$ via $\\,\\phi_{-1} = 2\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} - \\phi_1\\,$, yielding the scalar equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{\\Delta x} \\;+\\; \\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,W(\\phi_{\\text{avg}})}}{\\varepsilon} \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nto be solved for $\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} \\in [-1,1]\\,$.

The entries must be plain decimal numbers. Angles are in radians; no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a standard method for implementing contact angle boundary conditions in a phase-field model. The provided equations and parameters are consistent with established literature in computational materials science and nanomechanics. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is partitioned into two parts: first, a derivation of the specified boundary condition and its discrete form; second, the implementation of a numerical solver for the resulting equation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Boundary Condition and its Discretization**\n\nThe total free energy of the system is given by the functional\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}[\\phi] = \\int_{\\Omega} f_{bulk}(\\phi, \\nabla\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} g_s(\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}S,\n$$\nwhere the bulk free energy density is $f_{bulk} = \\lambda W(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla \\phi|^2$. At equilibrium, the state of the system locally minimizes this energy functional. The first variation of $\\mathcal{F}$ must vanish, $\\delta \\mathcal{F} = 0$.\n\nThe variation is computed as:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{F} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f_{bulk}}{\\partial \\phi} \\delta\\phi + \\frac{\\partial f_{bulk}}{\\partial \\nabla\\phi} \\cdot \\delta(\\nabla\\phi) \\right) \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} g_s'(\\phi) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}S.\n$$\nWith $f_{bulk}$ as defined, this gives:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{F} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\lambda W'(\\phi) \\delta\\phi + \\kappa \\nabla\\phi \\cdot \\nabla(\\delta\\phi) \\right) \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} g_s'(\\phi) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}S.\n$$\nApplying the divergence theorem to the gradient term, $\\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\nabla u \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S - \\int_{\\Omega} u (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$, with $u = \\delta\\phi$ and $\\mathbf{A} = \\kappa \\nabla\\phi$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\kappa \\nabla\\phi \\cdot \\nabla(\\delta\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\kappa \\delta\\phi (\\nabla\\phi \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S - \\int_{\\Omega} \\kappa \\delta\\phi (\\nabla^2\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}V.\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal of the domain $\\Omega$. Substituting this back into the variation $\\delta \\mathcal{F}$ yields:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{F} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\lambda W'(\\phi) - \\kappa \\nabla^2\\phi \\right) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left( g_s'(\\phi) + \\kappa (\\nabla\\phi \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\right) \\delta\\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}S.\n$$\nSince $\\delta\\phi$ is arbitrary in the bulk $\\Omega$ and on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, both integrands must be zero for $\\delta \\mathcal{F}=0$. This yields the Euler-Lagrange equation for the bulk (with chemical potential $\\mu=0$),\n$$\n-\\kappa \\nabla^2\\phi + \\lambda W'(\\phi) = 0,\n$$\nand the natural boundary condition on $\\partial\\Omega$,\n$$\n\\kappa (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi) + g_s'(\\phi) = 0.\n$$\nThe problem defines $\\mathbf{n}_w$ as the unit normal pointing from the wall *into* the fluid domain, thus $\\mathbf{n} = -\\mathbf{n}_w$. The boundary condition becomes:\n$$\n\\kappa (\\mathbf{n}_w \\cdot \\nabla\\phi) = g_s'(\\phi).\n$$\nThis is the generalized boundary condition derived from variational principles. The problem specifies a particular \"geometric\" form of this condition:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_w \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = -\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,\\lambda\\, W(\\phi)}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}.\n$$\nThis form is a modeling choice that directly enforces Young's contact angle $\\theta$. It is obtained by postulating that the derivative of the surface energy density, $g_s'(\\phi)$, is proportional to the gradient magnitude of a one-dimensional equilibrium interface profile. The equipartition relation for a stationary planar interface, $\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}s}\\right)^2 = \\lambda W(\\phi)$, gives the magnitude of this equilibrium gradient as $|\\nabla \\phi|_{eq} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\lambda W(\\phi)}{\\kappa}}$.\nBy substituting this into the geometric condition, we see it can be written as $\\mathbf{n}_w \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = -\\cos(\\theta) |\\nabla \\phi|_{eq}$. Comparing this to the variational condition gives the specific functional form for the derivative of the wall energy that this model implies:\n$$\ng_s'(\\phi) = \\kappa \\left( -\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,\\lambda\\, W(\\phi)}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\right) = -\\cos(\\theta) \\sqrt{2\\lambda\\kappa W(\\phi)}.\n$$\nThis completes the derivation and justification of the continuous boundary condition.\n\nNext, we derive the second-order accurate discrete form. The setup is one-dimensional with coordinate $x \\ge 0$, a wall at $x=0$, and $\\mathbf{n}_w = \\mathbf{e}_x$. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = -\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,\\lambda\\, W(\\phi(0))}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}.\n$$\nWe use the given second-order centered approximations for the derivative and the wall value $\\phi_w = \\phi(0)$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi_w \\approx \\frac{\\phi_1 + \\phi_{-1}}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the continuous condition, and with $\\lambda=1$ and $\\kappa=\\varepsilon^2$, we obtain the discrete equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{-1}}{2\\,\\Delta x} = -\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,W(\\phi_w)}}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nTo obtain the scalar equation to be solved, we reparameterize using $\\phi_{\\text{avg}} = \\phi_w = (\\phi_1 + \\phi_{-1})/2$. This implies $\\phi_{-1} = 2\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} - \\phi_1$. Substituting this expression for $\\phi_{-1}$ into the left side of the discrete equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_1 - (2\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} - \\phi_1)}{2\\,\\Delta x} = \\frac{2\\phi_1 - 2\\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{2\\,\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{\\Delta x}.\n$$\nEquating this with the right-hand side yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{\\Delta x} = -\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,W(\\phi_{\\text{avg}})}}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nRearranging terms gives the final scalar equation to be solved for $\\phi_{\\text{avg}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{\\Delta x} + \\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\,W(\\phi_{\\text{avg}})}}{\\varepsilon} = 0.\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the discrete form as required.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Solution**\n\nThe task is to solve the derived scalar equation for $\\phi_{\\text{avg}} \\in [-1, 1]$. In this interval, the double-well potential $W(\\phi) = (\\phi^2-1)^2/4$ simplifies the term $\\sqrt{2W(\\phi)}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2W(\\phi_{\\text{avg}})} = \\sqrt{2 \\frac{(\\phi_{\\text{avg}}^2-1)^2}{4}} = \\frac{|\\phi_{\\text{avg}}^2 - 1|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-\\phi_{\\text{avg}}^2}{\\sqrt{2}},\n$$\nsince $\\phi_{\\text{avg}}^2 \\le 1$. The equation to solve is therefore:\n$$\nf(\\phi_{\\text{avg}}) = \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_{\\text{avg}}}{\\Delta x} + \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{1-\\phi_{\\text{avg}}^2}{\\sqrt{2}\\varepsilon} = 0.\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $\\phi_{\\text{avg}}$. A robust approach to find the physically relevant root is to use a bracketing root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method. We need to find an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. The problem suggests the solution lies in $[-1, 1]$. Let us check the function values at the endpoints of this interval, for a given $\\phi_1 \\in [-1, 1]$:\n$$\nf(-1) = \\frac{\\phi_1 - (-1)}{\\Delta x} + \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{1-(-1)^2}{\\sqrt{2}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\phi_1+1}{\\Delta x}.\n$$\n$$\nf(1) = \\frac{\\phi_1 - 1}{\\Delta x} + \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{1-1^2}{\\sqrt{2}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\phi_1-1}{\\Delta x}.\n$$\nGiven $\\Delta x  0$, and that the test cases use $\\phi_1 \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $\\phi_1+1 \\ge 0$ and $\\phi_1-1 \\le 0$. Thus, $f(-1) \\ge 0$ and $f(1) \\le 0$. This guarantees that $f(-1) \\cdot f(1) \\le 0$, so there is always at least one root within the interval $[-1, 1]$. We can therefore safely use a bracketing solver like `scipy.optimize.brentq` on the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nOnce $\\phi_{\\text{avg}}$ is found, the value of the ghost point $\\phi_{-1}$ is computed from the relation $\\phi_{-1} = 2\\,\\phi_{\\text{avg}} - \\phi_1$.
