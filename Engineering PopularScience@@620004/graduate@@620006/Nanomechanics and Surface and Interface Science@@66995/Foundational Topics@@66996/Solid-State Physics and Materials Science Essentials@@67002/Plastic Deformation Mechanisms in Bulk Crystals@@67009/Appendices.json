Therefore, the edge components of the two partials must be equal and opposite. Let us denote the scalar components of the partials' Burgers vectors as $b_{1s}$, $b_{1e}$ for the first partial and $b_{2s}$, $b_{2e}$ for the second.\n$b_{1s} = b_{2s} = b_p \\cos(30^\\circ)$\n$b_{1e} = b_p \\sin(30^\\circ)$ and $b_{2e} = -b_p \\sin(30^\\circ)$.\n\nThe repulsive elastic force per unit length, $F_{\\text{rep}}$, between two parallel straight dislocations separated by a distance $d$ in their common slip plane is given by the formula based on isotropic elasticity:\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G}{2\\pi d} \\left( b_{1s}b_{2s} + \\frac{b_{1e}b_{2e}}{1-\\nu} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the components:\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G}{2\\pi d} \\left( (b_p \\cos(30^\\circ))(b_p \\cos(30^\\circ)) + \\frac{(b_p \\sin(30^\\circ))(-b_p \\sin(30^\\circ))}{1-\\nu} \\right)$$\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G b_p^2}{2\\pi d} \\left( \\cos^2(30^\\circ) - \\frac{\\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{1-\\nu} \\right)$$\nUsing $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G b_p^2}{2\\pi d} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{(1/2)^2}{1-\\nu} \\right) = \\frac{G b_p^2}{2\\pi d} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4(1-\\nu)} \\right)$$\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G b_p^2}{8\\pi d} \\left( 3 - \\frac{1}{1-\\nu} \\right) = \\frac{G b_p^2}{8\\pi d} \\frac{3(1-\\nu) - 1}{1-\\nu} = \\frac{G b_p^2 (2 - 3\\nu)}{8\\pi d(1-\\nu)}$$\nNow, we substitute $b_p^2 = (b/\\sqrt{3})^2 = b^2/3$:\n$$F_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{G (b^2/3) (2 - 3\\nu)}{8\\pi d(1-\\nu)} = \\frac{G b^2 (2 - 3\\nu)}{24\\pi d(1-\\nu)}$$\nThis repulsive force is balanced by the attractive force per unit length exerted by the stacking fault, which is constant and equal to its energy per unit area, $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$.\n$$F_{\\text{att}} = \\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$$\nAt equilibrium, $F_{\\text{rep}} = F_{\\text{att}}$:\n$$\\frac{G b^2 (2 - 3\\nu)}{24\\pi d(1-\\nu)} = \\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$$\nSolving for the equilibrium separation distance $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{G b^2 (2 - 3\\nu)}{24\\pi \\gamma_{\\text{SF}} (1-\\nu)}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the equilibrium separation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $d$ numerically using the provided parameters for a copper-like metal.

For a dissociated screw dislocation, this process cannot occur directly. The two partial dislocations, which are confined to the original slip plane, must first merge or \"constrict\" over a certain length to reform a segment of the perfect screw dislocation. This constricted segment is then free to dissociate again on the new cross-slip plane.\n\nThe formation of this constriction is an energetically activated process. It requires work to be done against the elastic repulsion of the partials and to locally eliminate the energetically favorable stacking fault. The width of dissociation, $d$, is a direct indicator of the stability of the dissociated configuration.\n\nIf $d$ is large, which corresponds to materials with a low stacking fault energy $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$ (since $d \\propto 1/\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$), the partials are widely separated. Bringing them together requires a significant amount of energy, leading to a high activation energy for constriction and, consequently, for cross-slip. Therefore, in low-SFE materials, cross-slip is difficult and dislocation motion tends to be confined to a single plane (planar slip).\n\nConversely, if $d$ is small, as in materials with high stacking fault energy $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$, the partials are already close together. The energy barrier for constriction is low because less work is needed to bring the partials together. As a result, cross-slip occurs much more readily. This leads to wavy slip, where dislocations can easily move between different slip planes, a characteristic that significantly influences the work-hardening behavior of the material.\n\nIn summary, the likelihood of cross-slip is inversely related to the dissociation width $d$: a larger $d$ makes cross-slip less probable, while a smaller $d$ facilitates it.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.37}\n$$", "id": "2784050"}]}
