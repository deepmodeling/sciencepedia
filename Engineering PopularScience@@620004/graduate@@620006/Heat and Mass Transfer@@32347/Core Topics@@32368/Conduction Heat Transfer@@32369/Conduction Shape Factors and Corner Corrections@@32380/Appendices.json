The boundary conditions are:\n1. The hemispherical surface is at a constant temperature $T_{s}$: $T = T_{s}$ for $r=a$ and $z>0$, where $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ is the spherical radius.\n2. The plane $z=0$ is adiabatic (perfectly insulating): $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = 0$ for all points on the plane $z=0$.\n3. The temperature far from the boss approaches $T_{\\infty}$: $T \\to T_{\\infty}$ as $|\\boldsymbol{x}| \\to \\infty$.\n\nTo solve this boundary-value problem, we employ the method of images. An adiabatic plane boundary condition ($\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}=0$) can be satisfied by placing an identical image source, symmetric with respect to the plane. In this case, our \"source\" is the isothermal hemisphere in the $z>0$ domain. We place an identical image hemisphere in the $z<0$ domain. The combination of the original object and its image forms a complete isothermal sphere of radius $a$ maintained at temperature $T_s$, embedded in an infinite, homogeneous medium with an undisturbed temperature $T_{\\infty}$.\n\nBy symmetry, the temperature field for this full sphere, $T(x,y,z)$, must satisfy $T(x,y,z) = T(x,y,-z)$. The temperature gradient component normal to the $z=0$ plane is $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}$. Its value at $z=0$ is given by the central difference formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z=0} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{T(x,y,h) - T(x,y,-h)}{2h} $$\nDue to the symmetry $T(x,y,h) = T(x,y,-h)$, the numerator is zero, and thus $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = 0$ everywhere on the $z=0$ plane. This constructed solution automatically satisfies the adiabatic boundary condition of the original problem.\n\nWe now solve the simpler problem for the full sphere in an infinite medium. Due to spherical symmetry, the temperature $T$ depends only on the radial distance $r$. Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates reduces to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^{2}\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $r$ yields the general solution:\n$$ T(r) = C_{1} + \\frac{C_{2}}{r} $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, are determined from the boundary conditions for the sphere problem:\n1. $T \\to T_{\\infty}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. This implies $C_{1} = T_{\\infty}$.\n2. $T = T_{s}$ at $r=a$. This gives $T_{s} = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{C_{2}}{a}$, which yields $C_{2} = a(T_{s}-T_{\\infty})$.\n\nThus, the temperature distribution around the full sphere is:\n$$ T(r) = T_{\\infty} + (T_{s}-T_{\\infty})\\frac{a}{r} $$\nThis solution is valid for the original hemisphere problem in the domain $z>0$.\n\nThe total heat transfer rate, $Q$, is found using Fourier's law of conduction, $q'' = -k\\nabla T$. The total rate is the integral of the heat flux over the surface area of heat transfer. For the hemispherical boss, this is the curved surface area, as the base is adiabatic.\n$$ Q = \\int_{A_{\\text{hemi}}} (-k\\nabla T) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{A} $$\nThe temperature gradient is $\\nabla T = \\frac{dT}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{a}{r^2}(T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) $$\nAt the surface $r=a$, the gradient is $\\frac{dT}{dr}\\big|_{r=a} = -\\frac{1}{a}(T_{s}-T_{\\infty})$.\nThe heat rate from the full sphere, $Q_{\\text{sphere}}$, is calculated by integrating over its entire surface area $A=4\\pi a^2$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{sphere}} = -k A \\left(\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right)_{r=a} = -k(4\\pi a^{2})\\left(-\\frac{1}{a}(T_{s}-T_{\\infty})\\right) = 4\\pi k a (T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) $$\nDue to the symmetry of the image system, the heat transferred from the upper hemisphere into the $z>0$ half-space must be exactly half of the total heat transferred from the full sphere. Therefore, the heat rate for the hemispherical boss is:\n$$ Q = \\frac{1}{2}Q_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{1}{2} [4\\pi k a (T_{s}-T_{\\infty})] = 2\\pi k a (T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) $$\nThe conduction shape factor $S$ is defined by the relation $Q = k S (T_{s}-T_{\\infty})$. By comparing this definition with our derived expression for $Q$, we can identify the shape factor:\n$$ k S (T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) = 2\\pi k a (T_{s}-T_{\\infty}) $$\n$$ S = 2\\pi a $$\nThis is the conduction shape factor for an isothermal hemisphere on an adiabatic plane.\n\nFor the comparison, we consider the full isothermal sphere of radius $a$ in an infinite medium. Its heat rate is $Q_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi k a (T_{s}-T_{\\infty})$. The corresponding shape factor, $S_{\\text{sphere}}$, is given by $Q_{\\text{sphere}} = k S_{\\text{sphere}} (T_{s}-T_{\\infty})$. This yields:\n$$ S_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi a $$\nTherefore, the shape factor for the hemispherical boss on an adiabatic surface ($S=2\\pi a$) is exactly one-half of the shape factor for a complete sphere ($S_{\\text{sphere}}=4\\pi a$).

The geometry of the two cylinders and the surrounding medium is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis (the line $y=0$). The boundary conditions on the cylinders are also symmetric with respect to this axis. Because the governing partial differential equation and the boundary conditions are symmetric with respect to the transformation $y \\to -y$, the unique solution for the temperature field must also exhibit this symmetry. That is,\n$$ T(x,y) = T(x,-y) $$\nThis symmetry has a critical consequence for the heat flux along the $x$-axis.

A surface with zero normal heat flux is, by definition, an adiabatic surface. Thus, the entire $x$-axis is an adiabat for the system with no slit.\n\nNow, consider the introduction of the \"perfectly insulating, zero-thickness slit\". An insulating surface imposes a boundary condition of zero heat flux normal to it. The slit is placed on a segment of the $x$-axis. The normal direction to the slit is the $y$-direction. The boundary condition imposed by the slit is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{\\text{slit}} = 0 $$\nHowever, we have already established from symmetry principles that the solution to the original problem, $T_{\\text{no slit}}$, already satisfies this condition. The introduction of the insulating slit does not impose any new constraint on the temperature field that was not already present. According to the uniqueness theorem for the solution of Laplace's equation, if a solution satisfies the governing equation and all imposed boundary conditions, it is the only solution. Since the temperature field for the no-slit case, $T_{\\text{no slit}}$, satisfies all boundary conditions for the with-slit case, it must be the solution for that case as well.\n$$ T_{\\text{with slit}}(x,y) = T_{\\text{no slit}}(x,y) $$\nThe two temperature fields are identical. The conduction shape factor $S$ is determined from the total heat rate $q'$, which is calculated by integrating the heat flux (derived from the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$) over a surface. Since the temperature fields are identical, their gradients $\\nabla T$ are also identical, and consequently the total heat rate $q'$ conducted between the cylinders must be the same in both cases.\n$$ q'_{\\text{with slit}} = q'_{\\text{no slit}} $$\nFrom the definition $q' = k S (T_h - T_c)$, it directly follows that the shape factors must also be identical:\n$$ S_{\\text{with slit}} = S_{\\text{no slit}} $$\nTherefore, the change in the shape factor is:\n$$ \\Delta S = S_{\\text{with slit}} - S_{\\text{no slit}} = 0 $$\nTo provide the requested justification using orthogonal coordinates, we introduce the bipolar coordinate system $(\\sigma, \\tau)$, which is the natural choice for this geometry.

The two cylinder surfaces correspond to constant coordinate surfaces $\\tau = \\tau_0$ and $\\tau = -\\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0 = \\arccosh(c/R)$.

This confirms, through analysis of the appropriate orthogonal coordinate system, that the $x$-axis is a natural adiabatic surface of the system. The insulating slit is placed along a segment of this existing adiabat.
