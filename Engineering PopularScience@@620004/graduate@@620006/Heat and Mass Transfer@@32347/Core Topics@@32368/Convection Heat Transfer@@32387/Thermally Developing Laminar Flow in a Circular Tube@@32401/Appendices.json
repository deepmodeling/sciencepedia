This implies $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0$. For flow in a duct of constant cross-section, this also means the radial and azimuthal velocity components are zero: $v = 0$ and $w = 0$.\n3.  **Axisymmetric flow**: The problem symmetry implies that there is no variation in the $\\theta$ direction, so all $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ terms are zero. This is consistent with $w=0$. The axial velocity is a function of radius only: $u = u(r)$.\n\nApplying these simplifications:\nThe continuity equation becomes $0=0$ and is automatically satisfied.\nThe $r$-momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = 0 $$\nThis indicates that the pressure $p$ is not a function of the radial coordinate $r$.\nThe $\\theta$-momentum equation simplifies to $0=0$.\nSince $p$ is not a function of $r$ or $\\theta$, it can only be a function of the axial coordinate $z$: $p = p(z)$.\n\nThe $z$-momentum equation reduces significantly. The entire left-hand side (advection terms) is zero because $v=0, w=0,$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}=0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right] $$\nSince $u$ depends only on $r$ and $p$ depends only on $z$, we can replace the partial derivatives with ordinary derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{d p}{d z} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left( r \\frac{d u}{d r} \\right) $$\nIn this equation, the left side is a function of $z$ only, and the right side is a function of $r$ only. For this equality to hold for all $r$ and $z$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Therefore, the axial pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ must be constant.\n\nWe can determine this constant by integrating over the length $L$ of the tube:\n$$ \\int_{z=0}^{z=L} \\frac{dp}{dz} dz = \\int_{p(0)}^{p(L)} dp $$\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dz} L = p(L) - p(0) = -\\Delta p $$\nThus, the constant pressure gradient is $\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the simplified $z$-momentum equation, we obtain the governing ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left( r \\frac{d u}{d r} \\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\nWe now integrate this equation twice with respect to $r$.\nFirst integration:\n$$ r \\frac{du}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 $$\nDividing by $r$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nSecond integration:\n$$ u(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions:\n1.  At the centerline of the tube, $r=0$, the velocity must be finite. The term $C_1 \\ln(r)$ diverges as $r \\to 0$. To ensure a physically meaningful finite velocity, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\n2.  At the tube wall, $r=R$, the no-slip condition applies, meaning the fluid velocity is zero: $u(R) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition with $C_1=0$:\n$$ u(R) = 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 $$\nThis gives the second constant: $C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L}$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back, we obtain the final expression for the axial velocity profile $u(r)$:\n$$ u(r) = \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L} - \\frac{\\Delta p r^2}{4\\mu L} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe.\n\nNext, we compute the cross-sectional mean velocity $U$ using the given definition:\n$$ U = \\frac{2}{R^2} \\int_0^R u(r) r dr $$\nSubstituting the expression for $u(r)$:\n$$ U = \\frac{2}{R^2} \\int_0^R \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) \\right] r dr $$\n$$ U = \\frac{2 \\Delta p}{4\\mu L R^2} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr $$\n$$ U = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L R^2} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$ U = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L R^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{R^2 R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4}\\right) - (0) \\right] $$\n$$ U = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L R^2} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L R^2} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\nSimplifying, we arrive at the mean velocity:\n$$ U = \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{8\\mu L} $$\n\nFinally, we confirm that the centerline velocity $u_{\\max}$ is twice the mean velocity $U$. The maximum velocity occurs at the centerline, where $r=0$:\n$$ u_{\\max} = u(0) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - 0^2) = \\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L} $$\nComparing $u_{\\max}$ and $U$:\n$$ \\frac{u_{\\max}}{U} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{4\\mu L}}{\\frac{\\Delta p R^2}{8\\mu L}} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 $$\nTherefore, $u_{\\max} = 2U$, which confirms the required relationship.

The bulk temperature $T_b(x)$ is a weighted average of the local temperature $T(r,x)$, where the weight is the local mass flux $\\rho u(r)$. Because the velocity profile is parabolic and maximal at the centerline, the temperature in the high-velocity central region is given significantly more importance in the calculation of $T_b(x)$ than the temperature in the low-velocity region near the wall.

Since the wall temperature $T_w$ is constant, we have $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = -\\frac{dT_b}{dx}$. Substituting this into the energy equation gives:\n$$\n-\\dot{m} c_p \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\pi D h(x) \\theta(x)\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We rearrange and integrate over the length of the tube from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\theta(0)}^{\\theta(L)} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta} = -\\frac{\\pi D}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\int_0^L h(x) dx\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta(L)}{\\theta(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi D L}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nLet us define the arithmetic average heat transfer coefficient $\\overline{h}_A(L)$ as the spatial integral average of the local coefficient:\n$$\n\\overline{h}_A(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h(x) dx\n$$\nWith this definition, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_w - T_b(L)}{T_w - T_b(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi D L}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\overline{h}_A(L)\n$$\n\nNow, we consider the standard engineering definition of an average heat transfer coefficient, denoted here as $\\overline{h}_{LMTD}$. This coefficient is defined based on the total heat transfer rate over the entire tube length $L$, $Q_{total}$, and the log-mean temperature difference, $\\Delta T_{lm}$:\n$$\nQ_{total} = \\overline{h}_{LMTD} A_s \\Delta T_{lm}\n$$\nwhere the total surface area is $A_s = \\pi D L$ and the log-mean temperature difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{lm} = \\frac{(T_w - T_b(L)) - (T_w - T_b(0))}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_w - T_b(L)}{T_w - T_b(0)}\\right)} = \\frac{\\theta(L) - \\theta(0)}{\\ln(\\theta(L)/\\theta(0))}\n$$\nThe total heat transfer rate can also be found from an overall energy balance on the fluid:\n$$\nQ_{total} = \\dot{m} c_p (T_b(L) - T_b(0)) = \\dot{m} c_p (\\theta(0) - \\theta(L))\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $Q_{total}$ and the definition of $\\Delta T_{lm}$ into the equation for $\\overline{h}_{LMTD}$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_p (\\theta(0) - \\theta(L)) = \\overline{h}_{LMTD} (\\pi D L) \\frac{\\theta(L) - \\theta(0)}{\\ln(\\theta(L)/\\theta(0))}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta(L)}{\\theta(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi D L}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\overline{h}_{LMTD}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the one derived from the differential energy balance, we find:\n$$\n\\overline{h}_A(L) = \\overline{h}_{LMTD}\n$$\nThis proves that for a constant wall temperature boundary condition, the physically meaningful average heat transfer coefficient (based on LMTD) is exactly equal to the simple spatial average of the local heat transfer coefficient. We may therefore drop the subscript and define the length-averaged heat transfer coefficient $\\overline{h}(L)$ as:\n$$\n\\overline{h}(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h(x) dx\n$$\nThe length-averaged Nusselt number, $\\overline{Nu}(L)$, is defined in terms of this average heat transfer coefficient:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{\\overline{h}(L) D}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\overline{h}(L)$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{D}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nSince $D$ and $k$ are constants, we can move them inside the integral:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\frac{h(x) D}{k} dx\n$$\nRecognizing that the local Nusselt number is $Nu_x = \\frac{h(x)D}{k}$, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L Nu_x dx\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for Part 1.\n\nPart 2: Calculation and Discussion\n\nFirst, we use the derived formula to find an analytical expression for $\\overline{Nu}(L)$ using the given correlation for $Nu_x$.\nThe local Nusselt number correlation is given as:\n$$\nNu_{x}=C\\left(\\frac{Re\\,Pr\\,D}{x}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral expression for the average Nusselt number:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L C \\left(\\frac{Re\\,Pr\\,D}{x}\\right)^{1/3} dx\n$$\nThe terms $C$, $Re$, $Pr$, and $D$ are constant, so we can factor them out of the integral:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{C (Re\\,Pr\\,D)^{1/3}}{L} \\int_0^L x^{-1/3} dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^L x^{-1/3} dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^{2/3}}{2/3} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{3}{2} L^{2/3} - 0 = \\frac{3}{2} L^{2/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\overline{Nu}(L)$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{C (Re\\,Pr\\,D)^{1/3}}{L} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} L^{2/3}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} C (Re\\,Pr\\,D)^{1/3} L^{-1/3}\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{3}{2} C \\left(\\frac{Re\\,Pr\\,D}{L}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nNote that this is simply $\\frac{3}{2}$ times the local Nusselt number evaluated at the end of the tube, $x=L$.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $C=1.302$, $Re=500$, $Pr=10$, $D=0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $L=0.500\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless group inside the parentheses:\n$$\n\\frac{Re\\,Pr\\,D}{L} = \\frac{500 \\times 10 \\times 0.010}{0.500} = \\frac{50}{0.500} = 100\n$$\nNow, substitute this value into our expression for $\\overline{Nu}(L)$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) = \\frac{3}{2} (1.302) (100)^{1/3} = 1.5 \\times 1.302 \\times (100)^{1/3}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu}(L) \\approx 1.953 \\times 4.6415888... \\approx 9.06502...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $9.065$.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe calculated average Nusselt number, $\\overline{Nu}(L) \\approx 9.065$, represents the average heat transfer performance over the first $L=0.500\\,\\mathrm{m}$ of the tube. This value must be understood in the context of developing versus fully developed flow.\n\nIn the thermally developing region (the thermal entrance region), which begins at the tube inlet ($x=0$), the thermal boundary layer is infinitesimally thin. This leads to a very large temperature gradient at the wall, and consequently, a very high local heat transfer coefficient $h(x)$ and local Nusselt number $Nu_x$. As the fluid flows downstream, the thermal boundary layer grows, the temperature profile evolves, and the temperature gradient at the wall decreases. This causes $h(x)$ and $Nu_x$ to continuously decrease with increasing $x$, as captured by the correlation $Nu_x \\propto x^{-1/3}$.\n\nFar downstream, if the tube were sufficiently long, the flow would become thermally fully developed. In this regime, the dimensionless temperature profile $\\frac{T_w - T(r,x)}{T_w - T_b(x)}$ becomes independent of the axial coordinate $x$. This leads to a constant local Nusselt number. For a circular tube with laminar flow, these constant, fully developed Nusselt numbers are well-known fundamental results:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $Nu_D = 3.66$ for a uniform wall temperature (UWT) boundary condition.\n    \\item $Nu_D = 4.36$ for a uniform wall heat flux (UHF) boundary condition.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe problem specifies a uniform wall temperature $T_w$, so the relevant asymptotic value is $Nu_D = 3.66$.\n\nOur calculated value of $\\overline{Nu}(L) \\approx 9.065$ is significantly higher than the fully developed value of $3.66$. This indicates that over the specified length $L=0.500\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the heat transfer is dominated by the entrance region effects. The average Nusselt number is an integral average over a function $Nu_x$ that starts at infinity (theoretically) and decreases towards $3.66$. Since the tube is short, the highly efficient heat transfer near the inlet heavily weights the average to a value much larger than the asymptotic limit. We can verify this by estimating the thermal entry length, $x_{fd,t}$. A common criterion is $x_{fd,t}/D \\approx 0.05 Re Pr$. For the given parameters, $x_{fd,t} \\approx 0.010 \\times 0.05 \\times 500 \\times 10 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Since the tube length $L=0.500\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is much smaller than $x_{fd,t}$, the flow is indeed entirely within the thermal entrance region, justifying the use of the Lévêque-type correlation. The length-averaged Nusselt number $\\overline{Nu}(L)$ is a function of $L$; as $L$ increases, $\\overline{Nu}(L)$ would decrease and eventually approach the fully developed value of $3.66$ as $L \\to \\infty$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.065}$$", "id": "2531572"}]}
