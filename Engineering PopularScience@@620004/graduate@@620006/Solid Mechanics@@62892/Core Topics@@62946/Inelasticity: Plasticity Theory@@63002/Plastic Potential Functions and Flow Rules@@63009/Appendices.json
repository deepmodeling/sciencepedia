We must analyze the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix $\\boldsymbol{H}$ whose components are $H_{ij}$. The linear term $-kI_1$ in $f$ has a zero Hessian, so the convexity of $f$ is identical to the convexity of $\\sqrt{J_2}$, and the Hessian matrix is independent of the parameter $k$.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{H}$, we test it with specific eigenvectors of the stress space.\nFirst, consider a hydrostatic vector $\\boldsymbol{v} = (1, 1, 1)^T$. The product $\\boldsymbol{Hv}$ is a vector whose $i$-th component is $\\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}v_j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}$.\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{s_i s_j}{4 J_2^{3/2}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{3}\\right) - \\frac{s_i}{4 J_2^{3/2}} \\sum_{j=1}^3 s_j $$\nSince $\\sum_{j=1}^3 s_j = 0$, the entire expression is zero. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{Hv} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, which means $(1, 1, 1)^T$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 0$.\n\nSecond, consider the deviatoric stress vector itself, $\\boldsymbol{s} = (s_1, s_2, s_3)^T$. The product $\\boldsymbol{Hs}$ has the $i$-th component $\\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}s_j$.\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}s_j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{s_i s_j}{4 J_2^{3/2}} \\right] s_j = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(s_i - \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{j=1}^3 s_j \\right) - \\frac{s_i}{4 J_2^{3/2}} \\sum_{j=1}^3 s_j^2 $$\nUsing $\\sum s_j = 0$ and $\\sum s_j^2 = 2J_2$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}s_j = \\frac{s_i}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} - \\frac{s_i(2J_2)}{4J_2^{3/2}} = \\frac{s_i}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} - \\frac{s_i}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} = 0 $$\nThus, $\\boldsymbol{Hs} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, which means $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\n\nThird, consider a vector $\\boldsymbol{u}$ that is in the deviatoric plane (i.e., $\\sum_i u_i = 0$) and is orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{s}$ (i.e., $\\sum_i s_i u_i = 0$).\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}u_j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(\\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{s_i s_j}{4 J_2^{3/2}} \\right] u_j = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\left(u_i - \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{j=1}^3 u_j\\right) - \\frac{s_i}{4J_2^{3/2}} \\sum_{j=1}^3 s_j u_j $$\nUsing the conditions $\\sum u_j = 0$ and $\\sum s_j u_j = 0$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^3 H_{ij}u_j = \\frac{u_i}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} $$\nThus, $\\boldsymbol{Hu} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\boldsymbol{u}$. The third eigenvalue is $\\lambda_3 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian are $\\{0, 0, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}}\\}$. For the Hessian to be positive semidefinite, all eigenvalues must be non-negative. The problem statement specifies $J_2 > 0$, so $\\lambda_3 > 0$. The other two eigenvalues are $0$. All eigenvalues are non-negative.\nTherefore, the Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite for all stress states with $J_2 > 0$. Since the function $f$ is continuous, this implies it is convex on its entire domain. The convexity is independent of $k$. Consequently, the function $f$ is convex for all values of $k > 0$.\n\n3) Physical implications of the parameter $k$.\nIn the context of an associated flow rule, the plastic strain rate tensor $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p$ is given by $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, where $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier. In principal components, this is $\\dot{\\epsilon}^p_i = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_i}$.\nThe plastic volumetric strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v$, is the trace of the plastic strain rate tensor:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v = \\text{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\dot{\\epsilon}^p_i = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_i} = \\dot{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\left( \\frac{s_i}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} - k \\right) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v = \\dot{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\sum_{i=1}^3 s_i - \\sum_{i=1}^3 k \\right) $$\nSince $\\sum s_i = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v = \\dot{\\lambda} (0 - 3k) = -3k\\dot{\\lambda} $$\nGiven that $k > 0$ and $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$, the plastic volumetric strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v$ is always non-positive ($\\dot{\\epsilon}^p_v \\le 0$). A negative volumetric strain rate corresponds to a decrease in volume, which is known as compaction. A positive rate would be dilatancy.\nTherefore, for this model under an associated flow rule, plastic deformation always results in compaction. The parameter $k$ directly controls the magnitude of this plastic compaction. A larger value of $k$ implies a greater rate of volume reduction for a given amount of plastic flow (as measured by $\\dot{\\lambda}$).\n\nFinal requested answer:\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix $\\boldsymbol{H}$ are $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}}$.\nThe determinant is:\n$$ \\det(\\boldsymbol{H}) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 0 \\times 0 \\times \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} = 0 $$\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2671071"}, {"introduction": "While simple models like von Mises are instructive, real-world materials often exhibit more complex behaviors.

The provided conditions for the shape function $h(\\theta)$ are precise and physically plausible. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. It is therefore deemed valid, and a solution is constructed as follows.\n\nThe solution is organized into three main parts: first, the construction of the deviatoric-shape function $h(\\theta)$; second, the derivation of the general convexity condition for the plastic potential; and third, the verification that the constructed function satisfies this condition.\n\nFirst, we construct the deviatoric-shape function $h(\\theta)$. The problem mandates that $h(\\theta)$ be a smooth, strictly positive, and $2\\pi/3$-periodic function. The general representation of a $2\\pi/3$-periodic function is a Fourier series with arguments of the form $3n\\theta$ for non-negative integers $n$. The requested \"lowest-order trigonometric ansatz\" that is consistent with this symmetry is therefore:\n$$h(\\theta) = C_0 + C_1\\cos(3\\theta) + S_1\\sin(3\\theta)$$\nThis form includes the constant term (zeroth harmonic) and the first harmonic.\n\nTwo conditions are provided to determine the coefficients of this ansatz.\nAt the axisymmetric-tension meridian, $\\theta_T = +\\pi/6$, the function value is specified as $h(\\pi/6) = \\frac{11}{10}$. Substituting into the ansatz:\n$$h\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = C_0 + C_1\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}\\right) + S_1\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{6}\\right) = C_0 + C_1\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + S_1\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = C_0 + S_1$$\nThis yields the first equation: $C_0 + S_1 = \\frac{11}{10}$.\n\nAt the axisymmetric-compression meridian, $\\theta_C = -\\pi/6$, the value is $h(-\\pi/6) = \\frac{9}{10}$. Substituting again:\n$$h\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = C_0 + C_1\\cos\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{6}\\right) + S_1\\sin\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{6}\\right) = C_0 + C_1\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - S_1\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = C_0 - S_1$$\nThis yields the second equation: $C_0 - S_1 = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nWe now solve the system of two linear equations for $C_0$ and $S_1$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    C_0 + S_1 = \\frac{11}{10} \\\\\n    C_0 - S_1 = \\frac{9}{10}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAdding the two equations gives $2C_0 = \\frac{11}{10} + \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2$, from which we obtain $C_0 = 1$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $2S_1 = \\frac{11}{10} - \\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$, from which we obtain $S_1 = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nThe coefficient $C_1$ is not constrained by the given data because $\\cos(3\\theta) = 0$ at both specified meridians. The principle of parsimony, as suggested by the phrase \"lowest-order ansatz,\" compels us to choose the simplest form that meets the requirements. This is achieved by setting the unconstrained coefficient to zero, i.e., $C_1 = 0$.\nThus, the constructed shape function is:\n$$h(\\theta) = 1 + \\frac{1}{10}\\sin(3\\theta)$$\nThis function is smooth and $2\\pi/3$-periodic.

The minimum value of $h(\\theta)$ is therefore $1 + \\frac{1}{10}(-1) = \\frac{9}{10}$, which is positive.\n\nSecond, we derive the condition for the convexity of the plastic potential $g(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. The function $g(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ depends only on the deviatoric stress $\\boldsymbol{s}$, so we analyze convexity with respect to $\\boldsymbol{s}$. The sublevel set $\\{\\boldsymbol{s} : g(\\boldsymbol{s}) \\le k\\}$ must be convex for any constant $k > 0$. The boundary of this set, $g(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\sqrt{J_2}h(\\theta) = k$, represents the yield surface.\nIn the deviatoric plane, using polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$ where $\\rho = \\sqrt{2J_2}$, the equation of the yield locus becomes $\\frac{\\rho}{\\sqrt{2}}h(\\theta) = k$. We can write the radius as a function of the angle: $\\rho(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}k}{h(\\theta)}$.\nThe standard condition for the convexity of a curve defined in polar coordinates $\\rho(\\theta)$ is:\n$$\\rho^2 + 2(\\rho')^2 - \\rho\\rho'' \\ge 0$$\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to $\\theta$. Let us take the constant $\\sqrt{2}k = 1$ for simplicity, so $\\rho = 1/h$. The derivatives are $\\rho' = -h'/h^2$ and $\\rho'' = (2(h')^2 - hh'')/h^3$.

All definitions, constants, and conditions are standard in the field of solid mechanics and are mutually consistent. The material properties are realistic for steel. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution procedure for an implicit return-mapping algorithm consists of an elastic predictor step followed by a plastic corrector step if yielding is detected.\n\n**1. Elastic Predictor and Yield Check**\nThe trial stress is given as purely deviatoric, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$, with $\\|\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| = 500$ MPa.\nThe von Mises equivalent stress for the trial state is calculated:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\|\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| = \\sqrt{1.5} \\times 500 \\text{ MPa} \\approx 612.37 \\text{ MPa}\n$$\nThe yield stress at the beginning of the increment (virgin state, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k}=0$) is the initial yield stress, $\\sigma_y(\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k}) = \\sigma_{y0} = 250$ MPa.\nThe yield condition is checked using the yield function $f = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\sigma_y$:\n$$\nf^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\sigma_{y0} = 612.37 \\text{ MPa} - 250 \\text{ MPa} = 362.37 \\text{ MPa}\n$$\nSince $f^{\\mathrm{tr}} > 0$, the material has yielded, and a plastic corrector step is required.\n\n**2. Plastic Corrector (Return Mapping)**\nThe backward-Euler integration scheme updates the stress and internal variables. For associative $J_2$ plasticity, the flow rule is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{k+1}}\n$$\nWhere $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the consistency parameter. The problem defines the relationship between the equivalent plastic strain increment and $\\Delta\\lambda$ as $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda$. The standard flow rule that satisfies this condition is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\implies \\dot{\\bar{\\varepsilon}}^p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p:\\dot{\\boldsymbolvarepsilon}}^p} = \\dot{\\lambda}\n$$\nThus, we adopt the discretized form:\n$$\n\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\mathbf{s}^{k+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}}\n$$\nThe stress update is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{k+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\mathbf{C} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$. Since plastic flow is isochoric ($\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p) = 0$), this simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{k+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2G \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. As the trial and final hydrostatic stresses are zero, we consider only the deviatoric parts:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}^{k+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2G \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}^{k+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2G \\left( \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\mathbf{s}^{k+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}} \\right) = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 3G\\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\mathbf{s}^{k+1}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}}\n$$\nRearranging for $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\mathbf{s}^{k+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that $\\mathbf{s}^{k+1}$ and $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$ are collinear (the \"radial return\" property). By taking the von Mises equivalent of both sides (multiplying by $\\sqrt{3/2}$ and taking the norm), we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}} \\right) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1} + 3G\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nThis gives the update rule for the equivalent stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 3G\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nThe final state must satisfy the consistency condition, $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{k+1}, \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k+1}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1} - \\sigma_y(\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k+1}) = 0\n$$\nWith the linear hardening law $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$ and using $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k+1} = \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p,k} + \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 + \\Delta\\lambda$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1} = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\Delta\\lambda$ by equating the two expressions for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{k+1}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 3G\\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\sigma_{y0} = (3G+H)\\Delta\\lambda \\implies \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\sigma_{y0}}{3G+H}\n$$\n\n**3.
