This function must satisfy Poisson's equation within the domain and be constant on the boundary for a traction-free lateral surface. For a simply connected domain, this constant can be set to zero.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.

Combining these gives an expression for $J$ in terms of $\\phi$:\n    $$ J = \\frac{2}{G\\theta'} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\phi \\, dA $$\n\nI will now address each task in sequence.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of $J$ for a Circular Cross-Section**\n\nFor a circular cross-section of radius $R$, the domain $\\Omega$ is defined by $x^{2} + y^{2} \\le R^{2}$. Due to the axisymmetry of the problem, it is most convenient to use polar coordinates $(r, \\vartheta)$, where $r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$. The Laplace operator in polar coordinates is $\\nabla^{2} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\vartheta^{2}}$. Assuming an axisymmetric solution, $\\phi$ is a function of $r$ only, so $\\phi = \\phi(r)$, and the term with $\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\vartheta^{2}}$ vanishes.\n\nThe governing equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}\\right) = -2G\\theta' $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r\\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = -G\\theta'r^{2} + C_{1} $$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating again:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = -G\\theta'r + \\frac{C_{1}}{r} $$\n$$ \\phi(r) = -\\frac{1}{2}G\\theta'r^{2} + C_{1}\\ln(r) + C_{2} $$\nTo determine the constants of integration, we apply physical and boundary conditions. First, the stresses, and thus the stress function $\\phi$, must remain finite at the center of the solid shaft ($r=0$). The logarithmic term $\\ln(r)$ is singular at $r=0$, so its coefficient must be zero. Thus, $C_{1}=0$.\nThe boundary condition is $\\phi=0$ on the perimeter, i.e., $\\phi(R)=0$.\n$$ \\phi(R) = -\\frac{1}{2}G\\theta'R^{2} + C_{2} = 0 \\implies C_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}G\\theta'R^{2} $$\nThe stress function for the circular cross-section is therefore:\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{1}{2}G\\theta'(R^{2} - r^{2}) $$\nNow, we compute the torsional rigidity $J_{\\text{circle}}$ using its definition. The area element in polar coordinates is $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\vartheta$.\n$$ J_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{2}{G\\theta'} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{1}{2}G\\theta'(R^{2} - r^{2}) \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\vartheta $$\nThe $G\\theta'$ terms cancel, and the integral over $\\vartheta$ gives a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$ J_{\\text{circle}} = 2 \\pi \\int_{0}^{R} (R^{2}r - r^{3}) \\, dr = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{R^{2}r^{2}}{2} - \\frac{r^{4}}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{circle}} = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{R^{4}}{2} - \\frac{R^{4}}{4} \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{R^{4}}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^{4}}{2} $$\nThis is the well-known polar moment of inertia of a circular area.\n\n**Task 2: Torsional Constant for a Square Cross-Section**\n\nFor a square cross-section of side length $s$, finding an exact closed-form solution for $\\phi$ is not possible. The problem asks for a reliable value for the constant $c$ in the relation $J_{\\text{square}} = c s^{4}$. This value is obtained by solving the Saint-Venant boundary value problem exactly using a Fourier series representation for the stress function $\\phi$. The subsequent integration of $\\phi$ over the square domain yields the torque and thus $J$. The derivation is lengthy, so I will state clearly that I am using the established result from this exact method.\n\nFor a square of side $s$, the torsional constant is given by:\n$$ J_{\\text{square}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{64}{\\pi^{5}}\\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{5}}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) s^{4} $$\nThe dimensionless constant $c$ is the expression in the parenthesis. We can compute its numerical value. The series converges very rapidly.\n$$ c = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{64}{\\pi^{5}}\\left( \\frac{\\tanh(\\pi/2)}{1^{5}} + \\frac{\\tanh(3\\pi/2)}{3^{5}} + \\frac{\\tanh(5\\pi/2)}{5^{5}} + \\dots \\right) $$\nUsing numerical values: $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^{5} \\approx 306.02$.\n$\\tanh(\\pi/2) \\approx \\tanh(1.5708) \\approx 0.91715$.\n$\\tanh(3\\pi/2) \\approx \\tanh(4.7124) \\approx 0.99991$.\nThe first term of the sum dominates significantly.\n$$ c \\approx \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{64}{306.02} \\left( 0.91715 + \\frac{0.99991}{243} + \\dots \\right) \\approx 0.33333 - 0.20914 \\left( 0.91715 + 0.00411 \\right) $$\n$$ c \\approx 0.33333 - 0.20914 \\times 0.92126 \\approx 0.33333 - 0.19266 \\approx 0.14067 $$\nThe accepted reliable value for this constant is $c \\approx 0.1406$. Thus, we have $J_{\\text{square}} = 0.1406\\,s^{4}$.\n\n**Task 3: Ratio of Torsional Constants**\n\nWe are given the equal-area constraint:\n$$ \\text{Area}_{\\text{circle}} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{square}} \\implies \\pi R^{2} = s^{2} $$\nFrom this constraint, we can express $R^{4}$ in terms of $s^{4}$:\n$$ R^{2} = \\frac{s^{2}}{\\pi} \\implies R^{4} = \\frac{s^{4}}{\\pi^{2}} $$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $J_{\\text{circle}}$:\n$$ J_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{\\pi R^{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( \\frac{s^{4}}{\\pi^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{s^{4}}{2\\pi} $$\nWe can now compute the ratio $J_{\\text{circle}} / J_{\\text{square}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{circle}}}{J_{\\text{square}}} = \\frac{s^{4}/(2\\pi)}{c s^{4}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} $$\nSubstituting the value $c \\approx 0.1406$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{circle}}}{J_{\\text{square}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi(0.1406)} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.8834} \\approx 1.13190 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.132$.\n\n**Task 4: Physical Explanation for Maximality of the Circle**\n\nSaint-Venant's conjecture, proven by George Pólya, states that among all simply connected cross-sectional shapes of a given area, the circle possesses the maximum torsional rigidity $J$. A physical explanation can be constructed by considering the stress distribution and its contribution to rigidity.\n\nThe shear stresses in torsion are given by the gradients of the Prandtl stress function: $\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}$. The torsional resistance arises from these stresses. For a cross-section to be efficient in resisting torsion, the material should be stressed as uniformly as possible.\n\nIn the case of a circular cross-section, the magnitude of the shear stress vector, $|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| = \\sqrt{\\tau_{xz}^{2} + \\tau_{yz}^{2}} = |\\nabla\\phi|$, is constant at any given radius $r$ and reaches its maximum value, $|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}|_{\\text{max}} = G\\theta'R$, which is constant along the entire boundary. This indicates a highly efficient distribution of stress.\n\nIn contrast, for a non-circular shape like a square, the stress distribution is non-uniform. The shear stress must be tangent to the boundary. At the corners of the square, this condition forces the stress to be zero ($|\\nabla\\phi|=0$). The maximum stress occurs at the midpoints of the sides. This means that the material near the corners is underutilized and contributes very little to the overall torque capacity, while the material at the midpoints of the sides is highly stressed. These under-stressed regions represent an inefficient use of the cross-sectional area for resisting torsion.\n\nFrom an energy perspective, maximizing the torsional rigidity $J$ for a given area is equivalent to minimizing the total elastic strain energy for a given applied torque $T$. The circular shape, by distributing stresses more uniformly and avoiding both stress concentrations and under-stressed zones like the corners of the square, achieves the lowest possible strain energy state for a given torque among all shapes of the same area. A lower energy state for the same external load implies a stiffer structure, hence a maximal $J$. This optimality of the circle is a manifestation of its geometric property of enclosing the maximum area for a given perimeter length, which in the context of the membrane analogy for torsion, allows for the maximum volume under the deflected membrane, a quantity proportional to $J$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.132}\n$$", "id": "2710728"}, {"introduction": "While exact analytical solutions for warping in non-circular sections are rare, they offer profound insight when available.

We propose a candidate function of the form:\n$$ \\Phi(x,y) = C \\cdot y \\cdot (y - \\sqrt{3}x) \\cdot (y + \\sqrt{3}x - \\sqrt{3}s) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined.

Introduce the warping function $\\Phi(x,y)$ such that the axial displacement is $u_z(x,y) = \\kappa \\, \\Phi(x,y)$. The shear strains are\n$\\gamma_{xz} = \\kappa \\left(\\partial \\Phi/\\partial x - y \\right)$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\kappa \\left(\\partial \\Phi/\\partial y + x \\right)$, and the shear stresses follow from linear elasticity via Hooke’s law $\\tau_{xz} = G \\, \\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = G \\, \\gamma_{yz}$. Equilibrium in the absence of body forces requires $\\partial \\tau_{xz}/\\partial x + \\partial \\tau_{yz}/\\partial y = 0$ in $\\Omega$. The lateral surface is traction-free, so $\\tau_{xz} n_x + \\tau_{yz} n_y = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$.\n\nStarting from these fundamental kinematics, constitutive relation, and equilibrium, perform the following:\n\n1) Derive the strong form of the boundary-value problem for the warping function $\\Phi(x,y)$ in $\\Omega$, showing that it satisfies a homogeneous Laplace equation in the interior with a Neumann-type boundary condition on $\\partial \\Omega$. Write the natural boundary data explicitly in terms of $x$, $y$, $n_x$, and $n_y$.\n\n2) Derive the weak form: find $\\Phi \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$, unique up to an additive constant, such that the bilinear form involving $\\nabla \\Phi$ and the test function gradient equals a boundary integral involving the natural boundary data and the test function. State clearly the normalization condition you adopt to remove the nullspace.\n\n3) Discretize the weak form using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with continuous, piecewise-linear shape functions on a conforming triangulation $\\mathcal{T}_h$ of $\\Omega$. For a single triangle element $e$ with vertices $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, $(x_3,y_3)$, define the standard linear shape functions $N_i(x,y)$, $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and their gradients $\\nabla N_i$ which are constant on $e$. Explicitly write the element stiffness matrix $K^{(e)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$ and the consistent Neumann load vector contributions $f^{(e,\\partial)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ arising from a boundary edge of $e$ that lies on $\\partial \\Omega$.\n\nYour element formulas must be given in closed form as functions of the triangle vertex coordinates, and for a boundary edge with end nodes $i$ and $j$, the edge length, outward unit normal, and end-node coordinates. Use the following definitions on a triangle $e$ with area $A_e$ and the conventional constants\n$$\nb_1 = y_2 - y_3,\\quad b_2 = y_3 - y_1,\\quad b_3 = y_1 - y_2, \\qquad\nc_1 = x_3 - x_2,\\quad c_2 = x_1 - x_3,\\quad c_3 = x_2 - x_1,\n$$\nand $A_e = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\left| (x_2-x_1)(y_3-y_1) - (x_3-x_1)(y_2-y_1) \\right|$.\n\n4) Implement a program that:\n- Assembles the global stiffness matrix and load vector for $\\Phi$ using the explicit element formulas derived in part $3)$.\n- Enforces uniqueness by fixing one nodal value of $\\Phi$ to zero (a single-point Dirichlet constraint).\n- Solves for the nodal values of $\\Phi$.\n- Computes the torsional constant $J$ using the identity (for unit twist per unit length and unit shear modulus)\n$$\nJ \\;=\\; \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} - y \\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} + x \\right)^{2} \\right] \\, dA,\n$$\nwhere the gradients $\\partial \\Phi/\\partial x$ and $\\partial \\Phi/\\partial y$ are constant on each linear triangle. For element-wise numerical integration, you must use a degree-$2$ exact quadrature rule on triangles.\n\nFor numerical evaluation, set the twist per unit length to $\\kappa = 1$ in radians per meter and the shear modulus to $G = 1$ in pascals. Report $J$ in square meters to the fourth power $\\text{m}^4$.\n\nTest Suite (all lengths in meters, angles in radians):\n- Case A (happy path): Square $\\Omega = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ discretized by a structured mesh with $2 \\times 2$ rectangles, each split into two triangles along the diagonal from the lower-left to upper-right corner of each rectangle.\n- Case B (edge case, minimal mesh): Right triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$$,$ discretized as a single linear triangle.\n- Case C (aspect-ratio stress test): Thin rectangle $\\Omega = [0,2] \\times [0,0.5]$ discretized by a structured mesh with $4 \\times 1$ rectangles, each split into two triangles along the diagonal from the lower-left to upper-right corner of each rectangle.\n\nAngle unit: radians. Physical unit for $J$: $\\text{m}^4$. Express the outputs as real numbers in $\\text{m}^4$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\"), where each entry is the computed $J$ for Cases A, B, and C, in this order, in $\\text{m}^4$.", "solution": "We start from the fundamental kinematics and balance laws of Saint-Venant torsion under the assumptions of linear elasticity, small strains, and traction-free lateral surface.

Let $\\mathcal{T}_h$ be a conforming triangulation of $\\Omega$.

Suppose an element edge with end nodes $i$ and $j$ lies on $\\partial \\Omega$. Let the edge length be $L_{ij}$ and the outward unit normal be $\\boldsymbol{n} = (n_x,n_y)$, which is constant along a straight edge. Parameterize the edge by $t \\in [0,1]$ so that the position is $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\boldsymbol{x}_i + t (\\boldsymbol{x}_j - \\boldsymbol{x}_i)$ with $\\boldsymbol{x}_i = (x_i,y_i)$ and $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{x} = \\boldsymbol{x}_j - \\boldsymbol{x}_i = (\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$. The shape functions restricted to the edge are $N_i(t) = 1-t$ and $N_j(t) = t$. The natural boundary data is $g(t) = y(t) n_x - x(t) n_y$. The consistent edge load contributions are\n$$\nf_i^{(e,\\partial)} = \\int_{\\text{edge }ij} N_i \\, g \\, ds = L_{ij} \\int_0^1 (1-t)\\, [A + t B] \\, dt\n= L_{ij} \\left( \\frac{A}{2} + \\frac{B}{6} \\right),\n$$\n$$\nf_j^{(e,\\partial)} = \\int_{\\text{edge }ij} N_j \\, g \\, ds = L_{ij} \\int_0^1 t\\, [A + t B] \\, dt\n= L_{ij} \\left( \\frac{A}{2} + \\frac{B}{3} \\right),\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nA = y_i n_x - x_i n_y, \\qquad B = \\Delta y \\, n_x - \\Delta x \\, n_y, \\qquad L_{ij} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2}.\n$$\nThere is no volumetric source term in the weak form, so interior element load vectors are zero.\n\nGlobal system and constraint. Assembling over all elements gives a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $K$ and load vector $f$. To remove the constant nullspace, we enforce one Dirichlet constraint, e.g., $\\Phi(\\text{node }1) = 0$, by modifying the corresponding row and column of $K$ and the right-hand side $f$.\n\nPostprocessing for the torsional constant. With unit twist per unit length $\\kappa = 1$ and unit shear modulus $G=1$, the torsional constant $J$ can be computed from the warping solution as\n$$\nJ \\;=\\; \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} - y \\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} + x \\right)^{2} \\right] \\, dA.\n$$\nOn a linear triangle element, $\\nabla \\Phi$ is constant:\n$$\n\\nabla \\Phi|_{e} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Phi_i \\, \\nabla N_i = \\frac{1}{2 A_e} \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\Phi_i b_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\Phi_i c_i \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nDefine constants on $e$ as $p_e = \\partial \\Phi/\\partial x$ and $q_e = \\partial \\Phi/\\partial y$. The integrand is quadratic in $x$ and $y$, so a degree-$2$ exact quadrature rule on triangles suffices. Use the three-point symmetric rule with barycentric points $(\\tfrac{2}{3},\\tfrac{1}{6},\\tfrac{1}{6})$, $(\\tfrac{1}{6},\\tfrac{2}{3},\\tfrac{1}{6})$, $(\\tfrac{1}{6},\\tfrac{1}{6},\\tfrac{2}{3})$ and weights $A_e/3$ each. At each quadrature point with coordinates $(x_q,y_q)$, evaluate\n$$\nq_e(x_q,y_q) = \\left(p_e - y_q \\right)^2 + \\left(q_e + x_q \\right)^2,\n$$\nand sum $J_e = \\sum_{q=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{A_e}{3} \\, q_e(x_q,y_q) \\right)$. The global torsional constant is $J = \\sum_{e} J_e$.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation summary:\n- Generate the meshes for the three test cases.\n- For each mesh, assemble $K$ from the element stiffness matrices using $K^{(e)}_{ij} = (b_i b_j + c_i c_j)/(4 A_e)$.\n- Build the Neumann load vector $f$ by summing the boundary edge contributions $f_i^{(e,\\partial)}$ using the closed-form expressions for $A$ and $B$ and outward unit normals computed from edge geometry.\n- Impose $\\Phi$ equal to zero at one node to fix the constant nullspace, and solve $K \\Phi = f$.\n- Compute $J$ via the degree-$2$ exact triangle quadrature.\n- Report $J$ for the three cases in $\\text{m}^4$.\n\nThe program adheres to the required units: twist per unit length $\\kappa$ in radians per meter (set to $\\kappa = 1$), shear modulus $G$ in pascals (set to $G=1$), and outputs $J$ in $\\text{m}^4$.\n\nThe final output format is a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, i.e., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\".", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef triangle_area(coords):\n    x1, y1 = coords[0]\n    x2, y2 = coords[1]\n    x3, y3 = coords[2]\n    return 0.5 * abs((x2 -
