Rather than simply accepting the classical formula, you will use a numerical approach to solve the fundamental yield condition at the crack tip, thereby verifying the theoretical estimate of the plastic zone radius for yourself [@problem_id:2651054].", "problem": "Consider an infinite plate with a sharp through-thickness crack loaded in opening (mode I). Assume small-scale yielding is applicable so that the near-tip stress field is governed by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The material is isotropic, follows elastic–perfectly plastic behavior, and is under plane stress conditions. The Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) in mode I is denoted by $K_I$ with units $\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$. The uniaxial yield strength is denoted by $\\sigma_Y$ with units $\\mathrm{MPa}$. The polar angle $\\theta$ is measured from the crack plane, with $\\theta = 0$ directly ahead of the crack tip, and angles are to be treated in radians.\n\nFrom the Williams asymptotic expansion for mode I, the dominant near-tip tensile stress directly ahead of the crack tip ($\\theta = 0$) behaves as a singular field inversely proportional to the square root of the radial distance $r$ from the tip. Under plane stress, yielding first initiates at the point where the von Mises equivalent stress equals $\\sigma_Y$. The first-yield locus is the set of points in the vicinity of the crack tip where yielding initiates. Along $\\theta = 0$, define the first-yield distance as $r_p$, in meters.\n\nYour tasks are:\n- Starting from the accepted LEFM near-tip field structure and the von Mises yield criterion under plane stress, formulate a numerical procedure that determines $r_p$ along $\\theta = 0$ by solving the appropriate nonlinear equation for $r$ given $K_I$ and $\\sigma_Y$.\n- Use that $r_p$ to construct the dimensionless combination\n$$ C \\equiv 2\\pi\\, r_p \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_Y}{K_I}\\right)^2, $$\nand report $C$ for each test case below.

Do not assume any closed-form for $r_p$ in your numerical procedure; solve for $r_p$ directly from the condition that defines first yield along $\\theta = 0$.\n\nPhysical units and angle unit requirements:\n- Use $K_I$ in $\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$, $\\sigma_Y$ in $\\mathrm{MPa}$, and report $r_p$ internally in $\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Treat angles in radians.\n- The final reported quantity $C$ is dimensionless (unitless).\n- Your program should numerically solve for $r_p$ to a tolerance tight enough that $C$ is accurate to at least $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $K_I = 20$, $\\sigma_Y = 400$.\n- Case $2$: $K_I = 40$, $\\sigma_Y = 400$.\n- Case $3$: $K_I = 30$, $\\sigma_Y = 300$.\n- Case $4$: $K_I = 5$, $\\sigma_Y = 1000$.\n- Case $5$: $K_I = 60$, $\\sigma_Y = 300$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the values of $C$ for the five cases, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, `[c1,c2,c3,c4,c5]`).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided for a unique solution. We shall therefore proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe objective is to compute a dimensionless parameter, $C$, derived from the first-yield distance, $r_p$, ahead of a crack tip under Mode I loading in plane stress. The procedure must be numerical, solving for $r_p$ from first principles without a priori assumption of its closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, we state the accepted near-tip stress field for Mode I loading in an isotropic, elastic material. In a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ originating at the crack tip, where $\\theta=0$ lies on the plane of the crack ahead of the tip, the stress components are given by the Williams asymptotic expansion. The dominant terms are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\left(1 - \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sin\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\left(1 + \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sin\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\cos\\frac{3\\theta}{2} $$\nUnder the condition of plane stress, the out-of-plane stress components are zero: $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$.\n\nThe problem requires evaluation directly ahead of the crack tip, which corresponds to an angle $\\theta = 0$. Substituting $\\theta = 0$ into the stress field equations yields:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}\\vert_{\\theta=0} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) \\left(1 - \\sin(0)\\sin(0)\\right) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}\\vert_{\\theta=0} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) \\left(1 + \\sin(0)\\sin(0)\\right) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}\\vert_{\\theta=0} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) \\sin(0)\\cos(0) = 0 $$\nAt this location, the stress tensor is diagonal in the Cartesian system, meaning $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$ are the principal stresses. Let $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{yy}$. Due to plane stress, the third principal stress is $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz} = 0$. Thus, the principal stresses at $(r, \\theta=0)$ are:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}, \\quad \\sigma_2 = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}, \\quad \\sigma_3 = 0 $$\nYielding is governed by the von Mises yield criterion, which states that yielding commences when the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_v$, reaches the material's uniaxial yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$. The von Mises stress is defined in terms of principal stresses as:\n$$ \\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 \\right]} $$\nSubstituting the principal stresses at $\\theta=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_v(r, \\theta=0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} - \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(0 - \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\right)^2 \\right]} $$\n$$ \\sigma_v(r, \\theta=0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0 + \\frac{K_I^2}{2\\pi r} + \\frac{K_I^2}{2\\pi r} \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 \\frac{K_I^2}{2\\pi r} \\right)} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} $$\nThe first-yield distance, $r_p$, is the value of $r$ at which $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_Y$. This gives the governing equation for $r_p$:\n$$ \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}} = \\sigma_Y $$\nAs per the problem's directive, we do not solve this equation analytically for $r_p$. Instead, we formulate it as a root-finding problem. We seek the root $r=r_p$ of the function $f(r)$:\n$$ f(r) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} - \\sigma_Y = 0 $$\nThis nonlinear equation for $r$ will be solved numerically using a standard root-finding algorithm, such as a bracketing method (e.g., Brent's method), to ensure robustness and high precision. A suitable search interval $[a, b]$ must be chosen such that $f(a) \\cdot f(b) < 0$. For a small positive $r$, $f(r) > 0$, and for a large $r$, $f(r) < 0$. Thus, a root is guaranteed for $r \\in (0, \\infty)$. A sensible bracket like $[10^{-12}, 1.0]$ meters is more than sufficient for the given parameters.\n\nUpon finding the numerical value of $r_p$ for each test case, we compute the dimensionless constant $C$:\n$$ C = 2\\pi\\, r_p \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_Y}{K_I}\\right)^2 $$\nThe value of $r_p$ obtained from the numerical solver, with sufficient tolerance, is substituted into this expression. The resulting values of $C$ for all specified test cases are then reported.

A rigorous solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in the requested sequence.\n\n1) Derivation of the closed-form expression for the corrected `$K_I$`.\n\nWe begin with the three fundamental relations provided for the corrected system:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a + r_p \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\nr_p = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\quad (3)\n$$\nThe objective is to find an expression for `$K_I$` that depends only on the given parameters `$\\sigma$`, `$a$`, and `$\\sigma_Y$`. This is accomplished by algebraic elimination of `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` and `$r_p$`.\n\nFirst, substitute equation `$(3)$` into equation `$(2)$` to express `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` in terms of `$K_I$`:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2\n$$\nNext, substitute this expression for `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` into equation `$(1)$`:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi \\left[ a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right]}\n$$\nThis equation is a self-consistency relation for `$K_I$`. We must now solve it for `$K_I$`. To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\left[ \\pi \\left( a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\dfrac{K_I^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nDistributing the terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a + \\sigma^2 \\pi \\left( \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\dfrac{K_I^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a + \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} K_I^2\n$$\nThis is a linear equation for `$K_I^2$`. We collect the terms involving `$K_I^2$` on one side:\n$$\nK_I^2 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} K_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\n$$\nK_I^2 \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right) = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\nIsolating `$K_I^2$` yields:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final closed-form expression for `$K_I$`. Since the stress intensity factor is physically a positive quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$\nK_I = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten by recognizing that the uncorrected LEFM SIF is `$K_{I,LEFM} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`:\n$$\nK_I = K_{I,LEFM} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis solution is physically meaningful only when the term in the denominator is positive, which implies `$1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}  0$`, or `$\\sigma  \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$`. This condition defines the limit of applicability of this simplified plasticity correction model.\n\n2) Formulation of the fixed-point iteration.\n\nA fixed-point iteration scheme seeks a solution to an equation of the form `$x = g(x)$` by iterating `$x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$`. We formulate such a scheme for `$K_I$`. As specified, we use the self-consistency relation derived above:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi \\left( a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nLet `$K_I^{(k)}$` be the estimate of the SIF at iteration `$k$`. The next estimate, `$K_I^{(k+1)}$`, is computed using the mapping function `$g(K_I^{(k)})$`. The iteration is defined as `$K_I^{(k+1)} = g(K_I^{(k)})$`, where the function `$g(K)$` is:\n$$\ng(K) = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\dfrac{K^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial guess, which is the LEFM solution without plasticity correction:\n$$\nK_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nThe iteration proceeds as `$K_I^{(1)} = g(K_I^{(0)})$`, `$K_I^{(2)} = g(K_I^{(1)})$`, and so on, until convergence is achieved. The fixed point of this iteration, `$K_I = g(K_I)$`, is precisely the equation from which the closed-form solution was derived, ensuring that the iteration converges to the correct value, provided it converges at all. Convergence is guaranteed if the magnitude of the derivative `$|g'(K)|$` is less than `$1$` in the vicinity of the solution. The derivative is `$g'(K) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 K}{2 \\sigma_Y^2 g(K)}$`. At the fixed point `$K^*$`, where `$g(K^*) = K^*$`, this simplifies to `$g'(K^*) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}$`. Thus, convergence is guaranteed if `$\\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}  1$`, which is the same condition `$\\sigma  \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$` derived previously.\n\n3)  4) Numerical Solver Implementation and Computation.\n\nA numerical solver based on the fixed-point iteration formulated above is implemented to compute the corrected `$K_I$` for the given test cases. The algorithm for each parameter set `$(\\sigma, a, \\sigma_Y)$` is as follows:\n- Initialize the iteration count `$k=0$` and the SIF `$K_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`.\n- Loop for a maximum of `$10^4$` iterations:\n  - Compute the next SIF estimate: `$K_I^{(k+1)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\frac{(K_I^{(k)})^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}$`.\n  - Check for convergence: if `$|K_I^{(k+1)} - K_I^{(k)}|  10^{-12}$`, the iteration has converged.

This final practice bridges theory and application by placing you in the context of a plane strain fracture toughness test. You will integrate the Irwin correction into the formal validity criteria required by testing standards to determine the maximum allowable load for a valid measurement. This exercise highlights the critical role of plasticity corrections in ensuring the integrity of experimental data and making sound engineering judgments, while also reinforcing the important distinction between plane stress and plane strain conditions [@problem_id:2651043].", "problem": "A large plate of thickness $B$ contains a single edge crack subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, objective set of constraints and definitions. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The terminology is standard for the field of solid mechanics. The numerical values are physically plausible for engineering materials. The problem is valid and permits a unique solution.\n\nSolution Process:\nThe problem requires finding the maximum allowable remote tensile stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, under a specific set of conditions. The solution is constructed from fundamental principles of fracture mechanics.\n\nFirst, the stress intensity factor, $K_Q$, for a plate with an edge crack is given by:\n$$K_Q = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the remote tensile stress, $Y$ is the geometry factor, and $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective crack length.\n\nSecond, the effective crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is determined using Irwin's plastic zone correction. The physical crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, is the sum of the initial length and its growth:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{phys}} = a_0 + \\Delta a$$\nThe correction adds the plastic zone radius, $r_p$, to the physical length. For plane strain conditions, this radius is:\n$$r_p = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_Q}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nTherefore, the effective crack length is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a_{\\mathrm{phys}} + r_p = (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_Q}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\n\nThird, the problem imposes a validity criterion for plane strain, which limits the value of $K_Q$:\n$$K_Q \\le 0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}$$\nThe largest admissible stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, will correspond to the case where $K_Q$ reaches its maximum permitted value. We thus set the criterion to an equality:\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = 0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}$$\n\nTo find $\\sigma_{\\max}$, we solve the system of equations. We substitute $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$ into the expression for the plastic zone radius:\n$$r_p = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} (0.5 \\sqrt{B})^2 = \\frac{0.25 B}{6\\pi} = \\frac{B}{24\\pi}$$\nThis provides a direct calculation for the plastic zone radius at the validity limit.\n\nThe effective crack length at this limit is then:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{B}{24\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we use the primary equation for the stress intensity factor, setting $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\max}$ and $K_Q = K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$:\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = Y \\sigma_{\\max} \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields the final symbolic solution:\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi \\left( (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{B}{24\\pi} \\right)}}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, maintaining consistent units of megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$) and millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$):\n- $a_0 = 10.0~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\Delta a = 0.20~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $B = 25.0~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\sigma_Y = 1200~\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $Y = 1.12$\n\nStep 1: Calculate the limiting stress intensity factor, $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$.\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = 0.5 \\times 1200~\\mathrm{MPa} \\times \\sqrt{25.0~\\mathrm{mm}} = 600 \\times 5 = 3000~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{mm}}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the physical crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{phys}}$.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 10.0~\\mathrm{mm} + 0.20~\\mathrm{mm} = 10.2~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the plastic zone radius, $r_p$.\n$$r_p = \\frac{B}{24\\pi} = \\frac{25.0~\\mathrm{mm}}{24\\pi} \\approx 0.33157~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the effective crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a_{\\mathrm{phys}} + r_p = 10.2~\\mathrm{mm} + 0.33157~\\mathrm{mm} = 10.53157~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the maximum stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{3000~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{mm}}}{1.12 \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 10.53157~\\mathrm{mm}}} = \\frac{3000}{1.12 \\sqrt{33.0858}}~\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{3000}{1.12 \\times 5.7520}~\\mathrm{MPa} = \\frac{3000}{6.44224}~\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 465.66~\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} \\approx 466~\\mathrm{MPa}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{466}$$", "id": "2651043"}]}
