The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution begins with Maxwell's equations. For an electrostatic problem with no free charges, the relevant equation is Gauss's law for dielectrics:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement vector.\n\nDue to the geometry of an infinite plate and the uniform bending, the problem is one-dimensional. All vector quantities of interest, namely the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, polarization $\\mathbf{P}$, and displacement $\\mathbf{D}$, will have components only along the $z$-axis and will vary only with the coordinate $z$. We can write $\\mathbf{D} = D_z(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, $\\mathbf{E} = E_z(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and $\\mathbf{P} = P_z(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. In this one-dimensional case, Gauss's law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d D_z}{dz} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $D_z$ is a constant throughout all space (both inside and outside the dielectric plate).\n\nThe problem specifies \"open-circuit conditions\" and \"no free charges anywhere\" for a sample placed in vacuum. This means the plate is electrically isolated. For an infinite plate geometry, the electric field must vanish at infinity ($z \\to \\pm\\infty$). Since the electric displacement outside the plate (in vacuum) is $D_{z, \\text{out}} = \\epsilon_{0} E_{z, \\text{out}}$, the condition $E_{z, \\text{out}} \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\pm\\infty$ implies that $D_{z, \\text{out}} \\to 0$. Because $D_z$ must be constant everywhere, its value must be zero for all $z$. Thus, the open-circuit condition for this geometry dictates that:\n$$\nD_z(z) = 0\n$$\neverywhere.\n\nNow we analyze the situation inside the dielectric plate ($-h/2 \\le z \\le h/2$). The constitutive relation for the electric displacement is given as:\n$$\nD_z = \\epsilon_{0} E_z + P_{\\text{susc}, z} + P_{\\text{flexo}, z}\n$$\nThe susceptibility-induced polarization is $P_{\\text{susc}, z} = \\chi \\epsilon_{0} E_z$. Substituting this into the expression for $D_z$:\n$$\nD_z = \\epsilon_{0} E_z + \\chi \\epsilon_{0} E_z + P_{\\text{flexo}, z} = (1 + \\chi) \\epsilon_{0} E_z + P_{\\text{flexo}, z}\n$$\nUsing the definition of relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r = 1 + \\chi$, this becomes:\n$$\nD_z = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_{0} E_z + P_{\\text{flexo}, z}\n$$\nThe nominal flexoelectric polarization $P_{\\text{flexo}, z}$ is given by $P_{\\text{flexo}, z} = \\mu \\, \\partial \\varepsilon_{xx}/\\partial z$. With the strain field $\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) = \\kappa z$, the strain gradient is constant: $\\partial \\varepsilon_{xx}/\\partial z = \\kappa$. Therefore, the nominal flexoelectric polarization is also constant:\n$$\nP_{\\text{flexo}, z}(z) = \\mu \\kappa\n$$\nNow, by applying the condition $D_z = 0$ inside the material, we can solve for the self-consistent internal electric field, $E_z$:\n$$\n0 = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_{0} E_z + \\mu \\kappa\n$$\nThis field, often called the depolarization field, is generated in response to the flexoelectric polarization to maintain the zero-displacement condition. Solving for $E_z$:\n$$\nE_z = - \\frac{\\mu \\kappa}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_{0}}\n$$\nThis internal field is uniform throughout the plate.\n\nThe net polarization, $P_{\\text{net}, z}$, is the sum of the nominal flexoelectric polarization and the polarization induced by the internal electric field:\n$$\nP_{\\text{net}, z} = P_{\\text{flexo}, z} + P_{\\text{susc}, z}\n$$\nWe have $P_{\\text{flexo}, z} = \\mu \\kappa$ and $P_{\\text{susc}, z} = \\chi \\epsilon_{0} E_z$. Substituting the expression for $E_z$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{susc}, z} = \\chi \\epsilon_{0} \\left( - \\frac{\\mu \\kappa}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_{0}} \\right) = - \\frac{\\chi}{\\epsilon_r} (\\mu \\kappa)\n$$\nThe net polarization is then:\n$$\nP_{\\text{net}, z} = \\mu \\kappa - \\frac{\\chi}{\\epsilon_r} (\\mu \\kappa) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\chi}{\\epsilon_r} \\right) \\mu \\kappa\n$$\nTo express this solely in terms of $\\epsilon_r$, we use the relation $\\chi = \\epsilon_r - 1$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{net}, z} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_r - 1}{\\epsilon_r} \\right) \\mu \\kappa = \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_r - (\\epsilon_r - 1)}{\\epsilon_r} \\right) \\mu \\kappa = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_r} \\right) \\mu \\kappa\n$$\nThe problem asks for the reduction factor $R$, defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{\\overline{P}_{\\text{net}}}{\\overline{P}_{\\text{flexo}}}$.\nThe quantity $\\overline{P}_{\\text{flexo}}$ is defined in the problem as $\\mu \\kappa$. This is consistent with the spatial average of our constant $P_{\\text{flexo}, z}(z) = \\mu \\kappa$ over the thickness $h$.\nThe net polarization $P_{\\text{net}, z}$ is also constant with respect to $z$, so its spatial average, $\\overline{P}_{\\text{net}}$, is simply its value:\n$$\n\\overline{P}_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_r} \\mu \\kappa\n$$\nFinally, we can compute the reduction factor $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\overline{P}_{\\text{net}}}{\\overline{P}_{\\text{flexo}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_r} \\mu \\kappa}{\\mu \\kappa}\n$$\nThe term $\\mu \\kappa$ cancels, yielding the final expression for $R$ in terms of $\\epsilon_r$ only:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_r}\n$$\nThis result is independent of the thickness $h$, the curvature $\\kappa$, and the flexoelectric coefficient $\\mu$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{r}}}\n$$", "id": "2642419"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous concepts, this final practice moves from fundamental principles to a tangible engineering application: predicting the voltage generated by a bent dielectric structure.
