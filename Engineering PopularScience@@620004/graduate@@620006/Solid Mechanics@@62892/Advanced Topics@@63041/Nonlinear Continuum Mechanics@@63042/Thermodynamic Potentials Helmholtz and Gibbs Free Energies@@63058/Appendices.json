The central task is to distinguish between the correct and incorrect application of minimization principles for different boundary conditions—specifically, prescribed traction (a force-like boundary condition).\n\n1) The problem states that for a system under isothermal conditions and fixed generalized forces, equilibrium is achieved by minimizing the appropriate Legendre-transformed potential. For a mechanical system where the Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi$ is a function of a strain-like variable $\\varepsilon$ and temperature $T$, the conjugate force-like variable is the stress $\\sigma$. When a constant traction $\\sigma_0$ is prescribed, the system is under force control. The total potential energy functional per unit reference volume, $\\Pi(\\varepsilon)$, is the sum of the stored internal energy (the Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi$) and the potential of the external loads. The potential of the external traction $\\sigma_0$ is $-\\sigma_0 \\varepsilon$. Therefore, the potential to be minimized with respect to the kinematic variable $\\varepsilon$ is\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varepsilon) = \\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0) - \\sigma_0 \\varepsilon.\n$$\nThis is the variational statement. The system seeks the strain $\\varepsilon$ that minimizes this total potential. The stationarity condition is that the first derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Pi}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} \\left( \\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0) - \\sigma_0 \\varepsilon \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThis yields\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\varepsilon} - \\sigma_0 = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\varepsilon} = \\sigma_0.\n$$\nFrom the fundamental differential for the Helmholtz free energy density, $\\mathrm{d}\\psi = \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon - s\\,\\mathrm{d}T$, we identify the constitutive relation for stress at a constant temperature ($T=T_0$, so $\\mathrm{d}T=0$) as\n$$\n\\sigma = \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\right)_{T}.\n$$\nThus, the stationarity condition of the potential $\\Pi(\\varepsilon)$ recovers the constitutive relation for stress, evaluated at the prescribed equilibrium traction, $\\sigma = \\sigma_0$. This demonstrates the correctness of the principle.\n\n2) If one erroneously minimizes the Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0)$ directly under traction control, we set its derivative with respect to $\\varepsilon$ to zero. Given $\\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2$, the condition is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2\\right) = E \\varepsilon = 0.\n$$\nSince $E > 0$, the erroneous equilibrium strain is $\\varepsilon_{err} = 0$. The corresponding value of the Helmholtz free energy density is\n$$\n\\psi(\\varepsilon_{err}, T_0) = \\frac{1}{2} E (0)^2 = 0.\n$$\nThis result is incorrect because it ignores the work done by the external traction, effectively assuming a zero-stress state.\n\n3) Using the correct potential $\\Pi(\\varepsilon) = \\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0) - \\sigma_0 \\varepsilon$ from part 1), we find the correct equilibrium strain. Substituting the given form of $\\psi$:\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2 - \\sigma_0 \\varepsilon.\n$$\nWe minimize this potential by setting its derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Pi}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = E \\varepsilon - \\sigma_0 = 0.\n$$\nSolving for the correct equilibrium strain, $\\varepsilon_{eq}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{eq} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E}.\n$$\nThis is the correct constitutive response, Hooke's Law. The minimized value of the potential $\\Pi$ at this equilibrium strain is\n$$\n\\min_{\\varepsilon} \\Pi(\\varepsilon) = \\Pi(\\varepsilon_{eq}) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E}\\right)^2 - \\sigma_0 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E} - \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E}.\n$$\n\n4) The energy error per unit reference volume, $\\Delta e$, is defined as\n$$\n\\Delta e := \\left[\\min_{\\varepsilon}\\psi(\\varepsilon,T_0)\\right] - \\left[\\min_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\psi(\\varepsilon,T_0)-\\sigma_0 \\varepsilon\\right)\\right].\n$$\nUsing the results from parts 2) and 3):\n$$\n\\Delta e = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E}.\n$$\nTo interpret this result, we consider the Legendre transform of $\\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0)$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$. This transformation defines a new potential, the complementary energy density or stress potential $\\phi(\\sigma, T_0)$, which is a function of stress:\n$$\n\\phi(\\sigma, T_0) = \\sup_{\\varepsilon}(\\sigma\\varepsilon - \\psi(\\varepsilon, T_0)).\n$$\nThe extremum condition is $\\sigma - \\partial\\psi/\\partial\\varepsilon = 0$, which means $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon$, or $\\varepsilon = \\sigma/E$. Substituting this back into the definition of $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\phi(\\sigma, T_0) = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{E}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}E\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{E}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{E} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma^2}{E} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma^2}{E}.\n$$\nComparing this with our expression for the error, we see that\n$$\n\\Delta e = \\phi(\\sigma_0, T_0).\n$$\nThe error $\\Delta e$ incurred by minimizing the incorrect potential is precisely the complementary energy density evaluated at the prescribed traction $\\sigma_0$.
