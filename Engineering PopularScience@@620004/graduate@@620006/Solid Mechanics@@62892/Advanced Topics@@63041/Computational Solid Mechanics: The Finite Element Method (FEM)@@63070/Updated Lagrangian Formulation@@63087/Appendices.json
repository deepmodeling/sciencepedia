We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe analysis is conducted within an updated Lagrangian framework. The core of the problem lies in understanding the evolution of the Cauchy stress tensor under a pure rigid body rotation. The incremental deformation from the configuration at time $t^n$ to the configuration at time $t^{n+1}$ is given by the incremental deformation gradient $\\Delta\\mathbf{F} = \\Delta\\mathbf{R}$, where $\\Delta\\mathbf{R}$ is a proper orthogonal tensor representing a finite rotation and the incremental stretch tensor is the identity, $\\Delta\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{I}$.\n\nThe velocity gradient, $\\mathbf{L}$, is defined as $\\mathbf{L} = \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}$.

For a pure rigid body motion, the material undergoes no stretching, meaning the rate-of-deformation tensor is zero: $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe material is described by a hypoelastic constitutive law, which postulates a linear relationship between an objective stress rate, denoted $\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, and the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\n\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbb{C}:\\mathbf{D}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{C}$ is the fourth-order tensor of elastic moduli. Since $\\mathbf{D}=\\mathbf{0}$ for the entire increment, it follows that the objective stress rate must be zero:\n$$\n\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe principle of material frame-indifference (objectivity) requires that constitutive equations be independent of the observer. For a pure rigid body rotation, this implies that the components of the stress tensor in a coordinate system that co-rotates with the material must remain constant. This physical requirement is mathematically satisfied by integrating any valid objective stress rate equation with $\\overset{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe integration of this condition over the time increment $[t^n, t^{n+1}]$ yields the relationship between the Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{n+1}$ at time $t^{n+1}$ and the Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{n}$ at time $t^n$.

Integrating with respect to $\\gamma$ yields $\\sigma_{11}(\\gamma) = -\\sigma_{22}(\\gamma) + C$. Applying the initial conditions $\\sigma_{11}(0) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{22}(0) = 0$, we find the constant of integration $C=0$. Thus, $\\sigma_{11}(\\gamma) = -\\sigma_{22}(\\gamma)$ for all $\\gamma$.\n\nSubstituting $\\sigma_{22} = -\\sigma_{11}$ into equation (3):\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{12}}{d\\gamma} = \\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{11}) = \\mu - \\sigma_{11}\n$$\nWe now have a simplified system of two first-order ODEs:\n(A) $\\frac{d\\sigma_{11}}{d\\gamma} = \\sigma_{12}$\n(B) $\\frac{d\\sigma_{12}}{d\\gamma} = \\mu - \\sigma_{11}$\n\nTo solve this system, we differentiate equation (A) with respect to $\\gamma$ and substitute equation (B):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\sigma_{11}}{d\\gamma^2} = \\frac{d\\sigma_{12}}{d\\gamma} = \\mu - \\sigma_{11}\n$$\nThis gives a single second-order linear non-homogeneous ODE for $\\sigma_{11}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\sigma_{11}}{d\\gamma^2} + \\sigma_{11} = \\mu\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $\\sigma_{11,h}$ and a particular solution $\\sigma_{11,p}$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d^2\\sigma_{11,h}}{d\\gamma^2} + \\sigma_{11,h} = 0$, with a characteristic equation $r^2+1=0$ giving roots $r=\\pm i$. The homogeneous solution is $\\sigma_{11,h}(\\gamma) = C_1\\cos(\\gamma) + C_2\\sin(\\gamma)$.\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant $\\mu$, we try a constant solution $\\sigma_{11,p}(\\gamma) = K$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0+K=\\mu$, so $K=\\mu$.\nThe general solution for $\\sigma_{11}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11}(\\gamma) = C_1\\cos(\\gamma) + C_2\\sin(\\gamma) + \\mu\n$$\nWe determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ from the initial conditions at $\\gamma=0$:\n1. $\\sigma_{11}(0) = 0$\n2. $\\sigma_{12}(0) = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11}(0) = C_1\\cos(0) + C_2\\sin(0) + \\mu = C_1 + \\mu = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\mu\n$$\nTo use the second condition, we find $\\sigma_{12}(\\gamma)$ by differentiating $\\sigma_{11}(\\gamma)$ using equation (A):\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}(\\gamma) = \\frac{d\\sigma_{11}}{d\\gamma} = \\frac{d}{d\\gamma}(-\\mu\\cos(\\gamma) + C_2\\sin(\\gamma) + \\mu) = \\mu\\sin(\\gamma) + C_2\\cos(\\gamma)\n$$\nApplying the second condition:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}(0) = \\mu\\sin(0) + C_2\\cos(0) = C_2 = 0\n$$\nWith $C_1 = -\\mu$ and $C_2 = 0$, the final solution for $\\sigma_{11}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11}(\\gamma) = -\\mu\\cos(\\gamma) + (0)\\sin(\\gamma) + \\mu = \\mu(1 - \\cos(\\gamma))\n$$\nThis expression gives the normal stress component $\\sigma_{11}$ as a function of the total shear strain $\\gamma$. This non-zero normal stress is a well-known artifact of using the Jaumann rate for a hypoelastic model intended to represent a linearly elastic material subjected to large shear deformation. A proper hyperelastic formulation would predict $\\sigma_{11}=0$ in this loading for a linearly elastic material.\n The final result is derived solely from the provided definitions and initial conditions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\mu(1 - \\cos(\\gamma))} $$", "id": "2709089"}]}
