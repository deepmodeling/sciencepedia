The trial state is the correct final state.\n- Updated stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} = E \\Delta\\varepsilon $$\n- Updated backstress: $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n$.\n- The algorithmic tangent modulus $E_{\\mathrm{alg}}$ is the elastic modulus, as the stress is a linear function of total strain:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{alg}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{n+1}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{n+1}} = \\frac{\\partial(E \\varepsilon_{n+1})}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{n+1}} = E $$\nHere, we use the fact that $\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\Delta\\varepsilon$ for this specific problem.\n\nCase 2: Viscoplastic Response ($f_{\\mathrm{trial}} > 0$)\nIf the trial yield function is positive, viscoplastic flow occurs, and $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} > 0$. We must solve the system of equations. Substitute the expressions for $\\sigma_{n+1}$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}$ into the discretized flow rule:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} = \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta} \\left( E(\\Delta\\varepsilon - \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}) - (\\alpha_n + c \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}) - \\sigma_y \\right) $$\nWe can group terms to solve for $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} = \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta} \\left( (E \\Delta\\varepsilon - \\alpha_n - \\sigma_y) - (E + c)\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} \\right) $$\nRecognizing that $f_{\\mathrm{trial}} = E \\Delta\\varepsilon - \\alpha_n - \\sigma_y$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} = \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta} f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\frac{\\Delta t (E+c)}{\\eta} \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} $$\nRearranging to isolate $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t (E+c)}{\\eta} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta} f_{\\mathrm{trial}} $$\nThis yields the closed-form solution for the viscoplastic strain increment:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} = \\frac{\\Delta t f_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} $$\nWith $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}$ determined, the stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ is found by correcting the trial stress. This is the \"return map\" step:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = E(\\Delta\\varepsilon - \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t f_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) $$\nTo derive the algorithmic tangent modulus $E_{\\mathrm{alg}} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{n+1}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{n+1}} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{n+1}}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon}$, we differentiate the expression for $\\sigma_{n+1}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{alg}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} \\left( \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} - E \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} $$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} = E \\Delta\\varepsilon$, its derivative is $\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} = E$. We need the derivative of $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon^{vp}}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Delta\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t (E \\Delta\\varepsilon - \\alpha_n - \\sigma_y)}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta t E}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{alg}}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{alg}} = E - E \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t E}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) = E \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t E}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) $$\nSimplifying by finding a common denominator:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{alg}} = E \\left( \\frac{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c) - \\Delta t E}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) = E \\left( \\frac{\\eta + \\Delta t c}{\\eta + \\Delta t (E+c)} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the consistent tangent modulus for the viscoplastic case. It correctly reduces to the rate-independent tangent modulus $\\dfrac{Ec}{E+c}$ in the inviscid limit ($\\eta \\to 0$).\n\nSummary of the final algorithm:\n1.
