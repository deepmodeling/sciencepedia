A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three stages as delineated by the problem statement.\n\n**1. System Matrices and Undamped Eigenproblem**\n\nFirst, the mass matrix $M$ and stiffness matrix $K$ for the 2-DOF system are assembled.\nThe positions of the masses are denoted by the displacement vector $u = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe mass matrix is specified as a diagonal (lumped) matrix with $m_1=1$ and $m_2=1$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stiffness matrix $K$ is derived from the forces exerted by the springs. The force vector $F$ is $F = -Ku$.\nForce on mass $1$: $F_1 = -k_1 u_1 - k_2(u_1-u_2) = -(k_1+k_2)u_1 + k_2 u_2$.\nForce on mass $2$: $F_2 = -k_2(u_2-u_1) = k_2 u_1 - k_2 u_2$.\nFrom this, the stiffness matrix is:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1+k_2  -k_2 \\\\ -k_2  k_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSubstituting the given stiffness values $k_1 = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$ and $k_2 = 2000\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} 3000  -2000 \\\\ -2000  2000 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe undamped free-vibration eigenproblem is $(K - \\omega^2 M)\\phi = 0$. We solve for the squared natural frequencies $\\lambda = \\omega^2$ by finding the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(K-\\lambda M)=0$. Since $M$ is the identity matrix, this simplifies to $\\det(K-\\lambda I)=0$.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 3000-\\lambda  -2000 \\\\ -2000  2000-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (3000-\\lambda)(2000-\\lambda) - (-2000)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 5000\\lambda + 6 \\times 10^6 - 4 \\times 10^6 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 5000\\lambda + 2 \\times 10^6 = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $\\lambda$ are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{5000 \\pm \\sqrt{5000^2 - 4(1)(2 \\times 10^6)}}{2} = \\frac{5000 \\pm \\sqrt{25 \\times 10^6 - 8 \\times 10^6}}{2} = \\frac{5000 \\pm \\sqrt{17 \\times 10^6}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 2500 \\pm 500\\sqrt{17} $$\nThe two squared natural frequencies are $\\lambda_1 = \\omega_1^2$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\omega_2^2$.

Proportional Damping Calibration**\n\nThe damping is of the Rayleigh form $C = \\alpha M + \\beta K$. For such proportional damping, the damped equations of motion decouple in the modal coordinate basis. The modal damping ratio $\\zeta_i$ for the $i$-th mode is given by the relation:\n$$ 2\\zeta_i\\omega_i = \\alpha + \\beta\\omega_i^2 $$\nor, equivalently,\n$$ \\zeta_i = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega_i} + \\frac{\\beta\\omega_i}{2} $$\nThe problem provides $\\zeta_1 = 0.02$ and $\\zeta_2 = 0.05$. We have a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\omega_1^2 \\\\ 1  \\omega_2^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\omega_1\\zeta_1 \\\\ 2\\omega_2\\zeta_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $\\omega_1^2 \\neq \\omega_2^2$, this system has a unique solution for $(\\alpha, \\beta)$. This confirms that the specified modal damping ratios can be achieved with a Rayleigh damping model, which justifies the use of a single-mode analysis for the subsequent task. The explicit values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not required for the final answer.\n\n**3. Time-Domain Response and Peak Ratio**\n\nThe system is subjected to initial conditions $u(0) = c_1\\phi_1$ and $\\dot{u}(0)=0$, where $\\phi_1$ is the first mass-normalized eigenvector and $c_1$ is a scaling constant. Because the initial displacement is proportional to a single mode shape and the initial velocity is zero, only that mode will be excited. All other modal coordinates $q_i(t)$ for $i  1$ will be zero for all time $t$. Thus, the response is exactly given by the first mode's contribution:\n$$ u(t) = \\phi_1 q_1(t) $$\nThe equation of motion for the first modal coordinate $q_1(t)$ is that of a single-degree-of-freedom system:\n$$ \\ddot{q}_1(t) + 2\\zeta_1\\omega_1 \\dot{q}_1(t) + \\omega_1^2 q_1(t) = 0 $$\nThe initial conditions for $q_1(t)$ are found by projecting the physical initial conditions onto the modal basis:\n$$ q_1(0) = \\phi_1^T M u(0) = \\phi_1^T M (c_1\\phi_1) = c_1(\\phi_1^T M \\phi_1) = c_1 $$\nThe last step follows from the mass-normalization condition $\\phi_1^T M \\phi_1 = 1$.\n$$ \\dot{q}_1(0) = \\phi_1^T M \\dot{u}(0) = \\phi_1^T M (0) = 0 $$\nThe solution to the SDOF equation with initial displacement $q_1(0)$ and zero initial velocity is:\n$$ q_1(t) = q_1(0) e^{-\\zeta_1\\omega_1 t} \\left(\\cos(\\omega_{d1}t) + \\frac{\\zeta_1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_1^2}}\\sin(\\omega_{d1}t)\\right) $$\nwhere $\\omega_{d1} = \\omega_1\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_1^2}$ is the damped natural frequency.\nThe displacement of the first mass, $u_1(t)$, is the first component of $u(t)$:\n$$ u_1(t) = \\phi_{11} q_1(t) = \\phi_{11} q_1(0) e^{-\\zeta_1\\omega_1 t} \\left(\\dots\\right) $$\nFrom the initial conditions, we know $u_1(0) = \\phi_{11} q_1(0) = 0.001\\ \\mathrm{m}$. Therefore:\n$$ u_1(t) = u_1(0) e^{-\\zeta_1\\omega_1 t} \\left(\\cos(\\omega_{d1}t) + \\frac{\\zeta_1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_1^2}}\\sin(\\omega_{d1}t)\\right) $$\nTo find the times of the peaks, we set the derivative $\\dot{u}_1(t)$ to zero.\n$$ \\dot{u}_1(t) = u_1(0) \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ e^{-\\zeta_1\\omega_1 t} \\left(\\cos(\\omega_{d1}t) + \\frac{\\zeta_1}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_1^2}}\\sin(\\omega_{d1}t)\\right) \\right] $$\nThe derivative calculation shows that $\\dot{u}_1(t)=0$ when $\\sin(\\omega_{d1}t)=0$. This occurs at times $t = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\omega_{d1}}$ for integers $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nAt $t=0$ ($n=0$), we have $u_1(0)=0.001  0$ and $\\dot{u}_1(0)=0$. The second derivative $\\ddot{u}_1(0) = -u_1(0)\\omega_1^2  0$, confirming a local maximum.

While Rayleigh damping is widely used for its simplicity, it is not a universally perfect solution. This exercise guides you through a carefully constructed scenario to expose a significant weakness of the two-parameter Rayleigh model [@problem_id:2610929]. By attempting to apply a uniform damping ratio to a system with widely spaced natural frequencies, you will quantitatively uncover the phenomenon of \"damping sag\" and develop a critical perspective on the model's range of applicability.", "problem": "A three-degree-of-freedom structural model assembled by the Finite Element Method (FEM) has been modal-analyzed in the undamped case, yielding the following natural circular frequencies: $\\omega_{1} = 10 \\ \\text{rad/s}$, $\\omega_{2} = 100 \\ \\text{rad/s}$, and $\\omega_{3} = 1000 \\ \\text{rad/s}$. The damping matrix is assumed proportional (Rayleigh damping), i.e., $\\mathbf{C} = \\alpha \\mathbf{M} + \\beta \\mathbf{K}$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$ are the assembled mass and stiffness matrices, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are scalars to be chosen. You are told to select $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ so that the modal damping ratios of modes $1$ and $3$ both equal $\\zeta_{0} = 0.05$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear structural dynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will now proceed with the formal derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the modal damping ratio $\\zeta_i$ for the $i$-th mode and the Rayleigh damping coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is given for an undamped natural circular frequency $\\omega_i$ by:\n$$2\\zeta_i\\omega_i = \\alpha + \\beta\\omega_i^2$$\nThis can be expressed for the damping ratio as:\n$$\\zeta_i = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega_i} + \\frac{\\beta\\omega_i}{2}$$\nThe problem provides the natural frequencies for a $3$-degree-of-freedom system: $\\omega_1 = 10 \\ \\text{rad/s}$, $\\omega_2 = 100 \\ \\text{rad/s}$, and $\\omega_3 = 1000 \\ \\text{rad/s}$.\nThe damping coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must be selected such that the damping ratios for the first and third modes are equal to a target value $\\zeta_0 = 0.05$.\nThis gives us a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\nFor mode $1$:\n$$\\zeta_1 = \\zeta_0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega_1} + \\frac{\\beta\\omega_1}{2} \\implies 2\\zeta_0\\omega_1 = \\alpha + \\beta\\omega_1^2$$\nFor mode $3$:\n$$\\zeta_3 = \\zeta_0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega_3} + \\frac{\\beta\\omega_3}{2} \\implies 2\\zeta_0\\omega_3 = \\alpha + \\beta\\omega_3^2$$\nWe can solve this system symbolically.

The damping ratio function $\\zeta(\\omega) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega} + \\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}$ is defined by matching the desired damping $\\zeta_0$ at two frequencies, $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_3$. This function represents the superposition of mass-proportional damping (the $\\frac{1}{\\omega}$ term, dominant at low frequencies) and stiffness-proportional damping (the $\\omega$ term, dominant at high frequencies). The function exhibits a minimum at a frequency $\\omega_{min}$ where its derivative is zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\zeta}{d\\omega} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\omega^2} + \\frac{\\beta}{2} = 0 \\implies \\omega_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$\nUsing our calculated coefficients:\n$$\\omega_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100/101}{1/10100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 \\cdot 10100}{101}} = \\sqrt{100 \\cdot 100} = 100 \\ \\text{rad/s}$$\nThis calculation reveals that the intermediate frequency $\\omega_2 = 100 \\ \\text{rad/s}$ is precisely the frequency at which the minimum damping occurs. This is not a coincidence; it is a direct consequence of the frequencies being logarithmically spaced, i.e., $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\omega_1 \\omega_3}$. The damping at this minimum is $\\zeta_{min} = \\sqrt{\\alpha\\beta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{101} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10100}} = \\frac{1}{101}$. The value of $\\zeta_2$ is significantly lower than $\\zeta_0$, a phenomenon known as \"damping sag\". This illustrates that when modes are widely spaced, achieving a uniform damping level across the frequency spectrum with a simple two-parameter Rayleigh model is impossible. The model will necessarily under-damp intermediate modes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.009901}$$", "id": "2610929"}]}
