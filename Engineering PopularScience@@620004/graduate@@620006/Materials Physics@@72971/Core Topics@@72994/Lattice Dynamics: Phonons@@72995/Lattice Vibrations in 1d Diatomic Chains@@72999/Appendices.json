It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the positions of the masses of type $m_1$ be indexed by $n$ and reside at equilibrium positions $X_{n,1} = na$, where $n$ is an integer and $a$ is the length of the primitive unit cell. The masses of type $m_2$ are also indexed by $n$ and reside at equilibrium positions $X_{n,2} = na + d$. As each mass has two nearest neighbors of the other species, the mass $m_2$ in cell $n$ is located between the mass $m_1$ in cell $n$ and the mass $m_1$ in cell $n+1$. This implies the equilibrium distance between any two adjacent masses is $d = a/2$. Let $u_{n,1}$ and $u_{n,2}$ denote the small displacements from equilibrium for the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in the $n$-th unit cell, respectively.\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, $F=ma$, to each mass.

Optical-branch angular frequency at the Brillouin-zone center ($k=0$):\nAt the center of the Brillouin zone, $k=0$. Thus, $\\sin(ka/2) = \\sin(0) = 0$.

The angular frequency is:\n$\\omega_O(k=0) = \\sqrt{2K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)}$.\nThe lower sign (-) gives the acoustic branch, for which $\\omega_A^2(k=0) = 0$.\n\n2. Long-wavelength sound speed of the acoustic branch:\nWe need to find $c_s = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega_A(k)}{|k|}$. We examine the acoustic branch for small $k$.\nFor small $x$, $\\sin(x) \\approx x$. So, for small $k$, $\\sin(ka/2) \\approx ka/2$.\nThe acoustic branch is given by the lower sign:\n$\\omega_A^2(k) = K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) - K\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4\\sin^2(ka/2)}{m_1m_2}}$\nWe can expand the square root using the approximation $\\sqrt{1-x} \\approx 1-x/2$ for small $x$.\n$\\omega_A^2(k) = K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) - K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\sin^2(ka/2)}$\n$\\omega_A^2(k) \\approx K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) - K\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{2m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\sin^2(ka/2)\\right)$\n$\\omega_A^2(k) \\approx K\\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1m_2} \\left(\\frac{2m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\sin^2(ka/2)\\right)$\n$\\omega_A^2(k) \\approx \\frac{2K}{m_1+m_2}\\sin^2(ka/2)$\nUsing the small $k$ approximation $\\sin(ka/2) \\approx ka/2$:\n$\\omega_A^2(k) \\approx \\frac{2K}{m_1+m_2}\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{Ka^2}{2(m_1+m_2)} k^2$\nTaking the square root for $\\omega_A(k) > 0$:\n$\\omega_A(k) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{Ka^2}{2(m_1+m_2)}} |k|$\nThe sound speed $c_s$ is the coefficient of $|k|$:\n$c_s = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega_A(k)}{|k|} = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2(m_1+m_2)}}$.\n\nAnalysis of limits:\nThe problem requires justification of the behavior in the limits $m_1 \\ll m_2$ and $m_1 \\gg m_2$. Let $m_{\\text{light}}$ be the lighter of the two masses.\nFor the optical frequency at $k=0$, $\\omega_O(0) = \\sqrt{2K(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2})}$.\nIf $m_1 \\ll m_2$, then $m_{\\text{light}} = m_1$. In this case, $\\frac{1}{m_1} \\gg \\frac{1}{m_2}$, so $\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2} \\approx \\frac{1}{m_1}$.\nThen, $\\omega_O(0) \\approx \\sqrt{2K/m_1} = \\sqrt{2K/m_{\\text{light}}}$. This physically corresponds to the light mass $m_1$ oscillating between two effectively stationary heavy masses $m_2$, with an effective spring constant of $2K$ (two springs acting in parallel).\nIf $m_1 \\gg m_2$, then $m_{\\text{light}} = m_2$. In this case, $\\frac{1}{m_2} \\gg \\frac{1}{m_1}$, so $\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2} \\approx \\frac{1}{m_2}$.\nThen, $\\omega_O(0) \\approx \\sqrt{2K/m_2} = \\sqrt{2K/m_{\\text{light}}}$.\nIn both limits, the expression correctly approaches $\\sqrt{2K/m_{\\text{light}}}$.\n\nFor the acoustic sound speed, $c_s = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2(m_1+m_2)}}$.\nThis expression explicitly shows that the sound speed depends on the sum of the masses, i.e., the total mass $M = m_1+m_2$ of the unit cell. At long wavelengths (small $k$), the two atoms in the unit cell move essentially in phase ($A_1 \\approx A_2$). The unit cell acts as a single entity of mass $M=m_1+m_2$. The chain can be viewed as a monolithic chain of mass points $M$ separated by a distance $a$, with an effective spring constant between them. The two springs in the unit cell act in series, yielding an effective spring constant $K_{\\text{eff}} = (K^{-1}+K^{-1})^{-1} = K/2$. For a monatomic chain, the sound speed is $a\\sqrt{K_{\\text{eff}}/M}$, which would give $\\sqrt{(K/2)a^2/(m_1+m_2)}$. Our derived expression contains the factor of $2$ in the denominator, which is consistent with this physical picture. The speed is governed by the total mass per cell, as shown.\n\nThe required expressions are the optical frequency at $k=0$ and the sound speed $c_s$.\n$\\omega_O(k=0) = \\sqrt{2K(\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\frac{1}{m_2})}$\n$c_s = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2(m_1+m_2)}}$\nThese are the final results.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2K \\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)} & a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2(m_1+m_2)}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2835671"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational model, this next practice introduces a layer of complexity more representative of real materials by considering alternating spring constants.

The net force is:\n$$F_{2,n} = K_2(u_{n+1} - v_n) - K_1(v_n - u_n)$$\nNewton's second law gives the second equation of motion:\n$$m_2 \\frac{d^2 v_n}{dt^2} = K_2(u_{n+1} - v_n) + K_1(u_n - v_n)$$\n$$m_2 \\ddot{v}_n = -(K_1+K_2)v_n + K_1 u_n + K_2 u_{n+1}$$\n\nNext, we seek traveling wave solutions (normal modes) consistent with the periodicity of the lattice.

The undimerized reference system is a monatomic chain with lattice spacing $a$, mass $M_0$ at each site, and nearest-neighbor spring constant $K_0$. Now introduce a weak dimerization by doubling the unit cell to length $2a$ and letting the two sites in each cell be labeled $A$ (at position $2na$) and $B$ (at position $2na+a$). The mass and spring alternations are:\n- $A$-site mass $M_A = M_0(1+\\varepsilon_m)$, $B$-site mass $M_B = M_0(1-\\varepsilon_m)$,\n- spring between $A(n)$ and $B(n)$ is $K_1 = K_0(1+\\varepsilon_k)$, and spring between $B(n)$ and $A(n+1)$ is $K_2 = K_0(1-\\varepsilon_k)$,\nwith $|\\varepsilon_m| \\ll 1$ and $|\\varepsilon_k| \\ll 1$.

It describes a standard model in solid-state physics for studying the effects of dimerization on lattice vibrations, specifically the opening of a band gap at the Brillouin zone boundary. The methodology prescribed, first-order degenerate perturbation theory, is the correct and standard approach for this situation. Therefore, we proceed with solving the problem.\n\nLet the displacements of the masses $M_A$ and $M_B$ in the $n$-th unit cell be $u_{n,A}$ and $u_{n,B}$, respectively. The unit cell has length $2a$. The positions of the atoms A and B in cell $n$ are $x_{n,A} = 2na$ and $x_{n,B} = 2na+a$. Applying Newton's second law for nearest-neighbor harmonic interactions yields the equations of motion:\n$$ M_A \\ddot{u}_{n,A} = K_1(u_{n,B} - u_{n,A}) + K_2(u_{n-1,B} - u_{n,A}) $$\n$$ M_B \\ddot{u}_{n,B} = K_1(u_{n,A} - u_{n,B}) + K_2(u_{n+1,A} - u_{n,B}) $$\n\nWe adopt Bloch-wave solutions of the form:\n$$ u_{n,A} = U_A \\exp[i(k(2na) - \\omega t)] $$\n$$ u_{n,B} = U_B \\exp[i(k(2na+a) - \\omega t)] = U_B e^{ika} \\exp[i(k(2na) - \\omega t)] $$\nTo simplify the algebra, we absorb the phase $e^{ika}$ into the amplitude, defining new amplitudes $V_A = U_A$ and $V_B = U_B e^{ika}$. The solutions become:\n$$ u_{n,A} = V_A \\exp[i(k(2na) - \\omega t)] $$\n$$ u_{n,B} = V_B \\exp[i(k(2na) - \\omega t)] $$\nSubstituting these forms into the equations of motion gives:\n$$ -\\omega^2 M_A V_A = -(K_1+K_2)V_A + (K_1 e^{-ika} + K_2 e^{ika})V_B $$\n$$ -\\omega^2 M_B V_B = (K_1 e^{ika} + K_2 e^{-ika})V_A - (K_1+K_2)V_B $$\nThis is a generalized eigenvalue problem.
