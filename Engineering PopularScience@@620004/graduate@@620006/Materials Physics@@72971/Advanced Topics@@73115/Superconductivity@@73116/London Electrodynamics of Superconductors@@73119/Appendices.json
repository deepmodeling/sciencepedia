It represents a standard, fundamental problem in the physics of superconductivity. We may proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the relevant fundamental laws for magnetostatics and superconductivity. In a static situation, Maxwell's equations for the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$ and the electric current density $\\mathbf{J}$ are Ampere's law,\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nand Gauss's law for magnetism,\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe electrodynamic response of a superconductor is described by the London equations. For a static scenario, the relevant equation is the second London equation, which relates the superconducting current density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ to the magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{n_s q^2}{m} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nwhere $n_s$ is the number density of superconducting charge carriers, $q$ is their charge, and $m$ is their effective mass. This is often expressed in terms of the London penetration depth, $\\lambda$, defined by\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n_s q^2}\n$$\nThe London equation can thus be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nInside the superconductor, the total current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$. To obtain an equation solely in terms of $\\mathbf{B}$, we take the curl of Ampere's law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\mu_0 (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s)\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V}$ and Gauss's law $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, the left-hand side simplifies to $-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$.\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s)\n$$\nFor the right-hand side, we take the curl of the London equation:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the curled Ampere's law gives:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis yields the governing partial differential equation for the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$ inside the superconductor:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe problem considers a semi-infinite superconductor occupying the half-space $x>0$. The external magnetic field is parallel to the surface at $x=0$ and points along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction. Due to the specified translational invariance along $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ inside the superconductor can only depend on the coordinate $x$, and it must be directed along $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

The vector differential equation thus simplifies to a scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the component $B(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 B(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} B(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1/\\lambda^2 = 0$, which has roots $r_1 = 1/\\lambda$ and $r_2 = -1/\\lambda$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$\nB(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition states that the magnetic induction vanishes deep inside the superconductor:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} B(x) = 0\n$$\nAs $x \\to +\\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound. For the limit to be zero, its coefficient must be zero, so we must have $C_1 = 0$. The solution is then reduced to:\n$$\nB(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition specifies the value of the magnetic induction at the surface $x=0^{+}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(0^{+}) = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThis implies that the scalar component $B(x)$ at $x=0$ must be $B_0$. Setting $x=0$ in our solution:\n$$\nB(0) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\lambda}\\right) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2\n$$\nTherefore, we find $C_2 = B_0$.\n\nSubstituting the determined constant back into the solution, we obtain the final expression for the $y$-component of the magnetic induction inside the superconductor:\n$$\nB(x) = B_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis result describes the exponential decay of the magnetic field from its surface value $B_0$ into the bulk of the superconductor, a characteristic feature of the Meissner effect, with the decay length given by the London penetration depth $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{B_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2840850"}, {"introduction": "While superconductors are famous for carrying current without resistance, this ability is not limitless.
