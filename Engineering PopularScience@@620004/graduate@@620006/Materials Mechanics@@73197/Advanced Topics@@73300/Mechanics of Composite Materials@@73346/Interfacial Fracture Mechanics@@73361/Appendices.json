This exercise explores this fundamental paradox, where the calculated mode-mixity depends on an arbitrary reference length chosen for the analysis. By considering a thin, graded interphase layer that regularizes the mathematical singularity, this problem demonstrates how a physical length scale naturally emerges, providing a crucial insight into interpreting and applying the otherwise ambiguous results of interfacial LEFM. [@problem_id:2894510]", "problem": "A semi-infinite interface crack occupies the line segment $x<0$, $y=0$ between two linear-elastic, isotropic, dissimilar half-spaces bonded along $y=0$ under plane strain conditions. The dissimilarity is characterized by the Dundurs parameter $\\beta$ satisfying $|\\beta|<1$. Under a fixed remote mixed-mode loading, the sharp-interface problem (no interphase) admits the classical oscillatory near-tip asymptotics of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), with a complex stress intensity factor $K$ whose magnitude and phase depend on the chosen reference length scale $L$. Let $L_{0}$ be a fixed mesoscopic reference length, and denote by $|K|$ and $\\psi_{0}=\\arg K|_{L=L_{0}}$ the magnitude and the mode-mixity angle evaluated at $L=L_{0}$. Let $G_{0}$ be the corresponding energy release rate (equal to the Rice $J$-integral) for the sharp-interface crack under the given loading.\n\nNow replace the mathematical interface by a symmetric, linear-elastic, isotropic graded interphase of thickness $t$ between the same two half-spaces. Assume:\n- The interphase thickness satisfies $t \\ll L_{0}$ and $t$ is much smaller than any macroscopic geometric length in the problem, so that the near-tip fields of the sharp-interface solution apply down to a cutoff scale of order $r\\sim t$.\n- The grading is sufficiently smooth that, to leading order in $t/L_{0}$, the interphase acts only to regularize the singular fields and select a physical cutoff length without changing the adherends’ Dundurs parameter $\\beta$ or the far-field loading.\n\nUsing only fundamental LEFM facts about the oscillatory nature of interfacial crack-tip fields and the path independence of the energy release rate, derive the leading-order dependence of the mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$ evaluated at the physically selected scale $r\\sim t$ and the energy release rate $G(t)$ for the graded-interphase configuration.

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the energy release rate $G(t)$ and the mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$ for a crack at a bimaterial interface that is regularized by a thin graded interphase of thickness $t$. The solution is to be expressed in terms of the sharp-interface properties: initial energy release rate $G_{0}$, initial mode-mixity angle $\\psi_0$ at reference length $L_0$, and the Dundurs parameter $\\beta$.\n\nFirst, we consider the energy release rate, $G(t)$. In LEFM, the energy release rate $G$ is equivalent to the Rice $J$-integral. A fundamental property of the $J$-integral is its path independence for elastic materials, meaning its value does not depend on the integration path chosen, as long as the path encloses the crack tip. The problem states that the graded interphase of thickness $t$ is localized to the crack tip region and that $t \\ll L_0$, where $L_0$ is a macroscopic length scale. The far-field loading and macroscopic geometry are unchanged by the introduction of this thin interphase. We can therefore choose a $J$-integral contour far from the crack tip, at a radius much larger than $t$. At such distances, the stress and strain fields are identical to those of the sharp-interface problem. Consequently, the value of the $J$-integral remains unchanged. This directly implies that the energy release rate for the graded-interphase configuration, $G(t)$, is equal to the energy release rate for the sharp-interface problem, $G_0$.\n$$ G(t) = G_0 $$\n\nNext, we determine the mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$. The near-tip stress field along the interface ahead of the crack ($y=0$, $x>0$) for a sharp interface crack is characterized by a complex stress intensity factor, $K$, and exhibits an oscillatory singularity. The tractions are given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} + i\\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{K_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi x}} \\left( \\frac{x}{L_{\\text{ref}}} \\right)^{i\\epsilon} $$\nHere, $x$ is the distance from the crack tip, $K_{\\text{ref}}$ is the complex stress intensity factor defined with respect to a reference length $L_{\\text{ref}}$, and $\\epsilon$ is the bimaterial constant, which depends on the elastic mismatch of the two materials. The value of $K_{\\text{ref}}$ depends on the choice of $L_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nLet's establish the relationship between the stress intensity factors defined at two different reference lengths, $L_1$ and $L_2$. From the above equation, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{K(L_1)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi x}} \\left( \\frac{x}{L_1} \\right)^{i\\epsilon} = \\frac{K(L_2)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi x}} \\left( \\frac{x}{L_2} \\right)^{i\\epsilon} $$\nSimplifying this yields the transformation rule:\n$$ K(L_1) L_1^{-i\\epsilon} = K(L_2) L_2^{-i\\epsilon} \\implies K(L_2) = K(L_1) \\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{i\\epsilon} $$\nIn our problem, we are given the initial state for the sharp interface with a reference length $L_0$. The complex stress intensity factor is $K_0$, with magnitude $|K_0|$ and phase $\\psi_0 = \\arg(K_0)$. The graded interphase of thickness $t$ serves to regularize the singularity, effectively setting a new physical length scale for the fracture process, which the problem states is on the order of $t$. We are asked for the mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$ evaluated at this physically selected scale. We therefore set the new reference length to $t$.\n\nUsing the transformation rule with $L_1=L_0$ and $L_2=t$, we find the complex stress intensity factor at the new scale, $K(t)$:\n$$ K(t) = K_0 \\left( \\frac{t}{L_0} \\right)^{i\\epsilon} $$\nThe mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$ is the phase (argument) of $K(t)$. We can express $K_0$ in polar form as $K_0 = |K_0|\\exp(i\\psi_0)$. The term involving the length scales can be written using Euler's formula:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{t}{L_0} \\right)^{i\\epsilon} = \\exp\\left( i\\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right) \\right) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K(t)$:\n$$ K(t) = |K_0|\\exp(i\\psi_0) \\exp\\left( i\\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right) \\right) = |K_0|\\exp\\left( i \\left( \\psi_0 + \\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right) \\right) \\right) $$\nThe magnitude of $K(t)$ is $|K(t)|=|K_0|$. This is consistent with the energy release rate $G$ being constant, since $G$ is proportional to $|K|^2$. The phase of $K(t)$ is the new mode-mixity angle $\\psi(t)$:\n$$ \\psi(t) = \\arg(K(t)) = \\psi_0 + \\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right) $$\nThe problem requires the answer in terms of the Dundurs parameter $\\beta$. The bimaterial constant $\\epsilon$ is related to $\\beta$ by the fundamental expression:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left( \\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\right) $$\nThis relation holds for plane strain conditions with $|\\beta|<1$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\psi(t)$:\n$$ \\psi(t) = \\psi_0 + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left( \\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the mode-mixity angle at the scale $t$. Since $\\psi_0$ is an angle and the second term is dimensionless, the result is correctly an angle in radians as required.\n\nIn summary, the energy release rate is unchanged, $G(t)=G_0$, due to the path-independence of the $J$-integral. The mode-mixity angle is shifted due to the change in reference length from the arbitrary scale $L_0$ to the physical scale $t$ set by the interphase.\n\nThe final result is provided as a single row matrix $(G(t), \\psi(t))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nG_0 & \\psi_0 + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{L_0}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2894510"}, {"introduction": "The classic linear elastic solution for an interface crack predicts more than just a paradoxical mode mixity; it also suggests the non-physical interpenetration of the crack faces near the tip.

Computation of the Mode-Mix Phase Angle ($\\psi$)**\nThe phase angle is defined in terms of the energy release rate components $G_{\\mathrm{I}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{II}}$:\n$$\n\\psi = \\arctan2\\!\\left(\\sqrt{G_{\\mathrm{II}}},\\, \\sqrt{G_{\\mathrm{I}}}\\right)\n$$\nGiven the scaling relations $G_{\\mathrm{I}}(p) = Q_{\\mathrm{I}} p^2$ and $G_{\\mathrm{II}}(p) = Q_{\\mathrm{II}} p^2$, the load factor $p^2$ can be factored out and cancelled within the context of the ratio that determines the angle. Therefore, $\\psi$ is independent of the load level and can be computed directly from the unit-load quantities $Q_{\\mathrm{I}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{II}}$:\n$$\n\\psi = \\arctan2\\!\\left(\\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}},\\, \\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{I}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe use of the two-argument arctangent, $\\arctan2(y, x)$, correctly handles the pure mode cases where one of the arguments is zero. For pure mode I fracture, $Q_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0$, leading to $\\psi = \\arctan2(0, \\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{I}}}) = 0$. For pure mode II fracture, $Q_{\\mathrm{I}} = 0$, leading to $\\psi = \\arctan2(\\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}, 0) = \\pi/2$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Critical Line Load ($p_{\\mathrm{c}}$)**\nThe fracture criterion is $G(p_{\\mathrm{c}}) = G_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\psi)$. The total energy release rate at the critical load $p_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is given by:\n$$\nG(p_{\\mathrm{c}}) = (Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}) p_{\\mathrm{c}}^2\n$$\nThe critical energy release rate, or interfacial toughness $G_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is determined by the Benzeggagh-Kenane criterion:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\psi) = G_{\\mathrm{IC}} + \\left(G_{\\mathrm{IIC}} - G_{\\mathrm{IC}}\\right) \\left( \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{II}}}{G_{\\mathrm{I}} + G_{\\mathrm{II}}} \\right)^{\\eta}\n$$\nThe mode fraction term $\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{II}}}{G_{\\mathrm{I}} + G_{\\mathrm{II}}}$ is also independent of load and can be computed using the unit-load quantities:\n$$\nB = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}\n$$\nThe term $B$ represents the fraction of the total energy release rate attributable to mode II. This expression for $B$ is valid as long as $Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}} > 0$, which holds for all provided test cases.\nSubstituting $B$, the toughness is:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{c}} = G_{\\mathrm{IC}} + (G_{\\mathrm{IIC}} - G_{\\mathrm{IC}}) B^{\\eta}\n$$\nEquating $G(p_{\\mathrm{c}})$ and $G_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\n(Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}) p_{\\mathrm{c}}^2 = G_{\\mathrm{IC}} + (G_{\\mathrm{IIC}} - G_{\\mathrm{IC}}) \\left( \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}} \\right)^{\\eta}\n$$\nSolving for $p_{\\mathrm{c}}$ yields:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{c}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{IC}} + (G_{\\mathrm{IIC}} - G_{\\mathrm{IC}}) \\left( \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}} \\right)^{\\eta}}{Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}} }\n$$\n\n**Computational Algorithm Summary**\nFor each tuple $(Q_{\\mathrm{I}}, Q_{\\mathrm{II}}, G_{\\mathrm{IC}}, G_{\\mathrm{IIC}}, \\eta)$:\n1. Calculate $\\psi = \\arctan2(\\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{II}}}, \\sqrt{Q_{\\mathrm{I}}})$.\n2. If $Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0$, the problem is physically undefined. For all given cases, $Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}} > 0$.\n3. Calculate the total unit-load energy release rate: $Q_{\\mathrm{Total}} = Q_{\\mathrm{I}} + Q_{\\mathrm{II}}$.\n4. Calculate the mode II fraction: $B = Q_{\\mathrm{II}} / Q_{\\mathrm{Total}}$.\n5. Calculate the critical toughness: $G_{\\mathrm{c}} = G_{\\mathrm{IC}} + (G_{\\mathrm{IIC}} - G_{\\mathrm{IC}}) B^{\\eta}$.\n6. Calculate the critical line load: $p_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\sqrt{G_{\\mathrm{c}} / Q_{\\mathrm{Total}}}$.\n7. Round both $\\psi$ and $p_{\\mathrm{c}}$ to six decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented to solve for the four test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the mode-mix phase angle and critical line load for a bimaterial\n    interface crack based on the Benzeggagh-Kenane fracture criterion.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a 5-tuple: (Q_I, Q_II, G_IC, G_IIC, eta)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.40, 0.60, 250.0, 1200.0, 1.75),  # Case 1 (mixed-mode, dominant mode II)\n        (1.20, 0.00, 300.0, 900.0, 1.50),   # Case 2 (pure mode I)\n        (0.00, 0.80, 200.0, 1500.0, 2.00),  # Case 3 (pure mode II)\n        (0.95, 0.05, 280.0, 1000.0, 1.30),  # Case 4 (weak mixed-mode, dominant mode I)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        Q_I, Q_II, G_IC, G_IIC, eta = case\n\n        # 1.
