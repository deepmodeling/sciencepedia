We shall proceed with its solution in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Hilbert Transform\n\nThe Hilbert transform of a function $x(t)$ is defined by the convolution integral with the kernel $h(t) = 1/(\\pi t)$:\n$$\n\\hat{x}(t) = \\mathcal{H}\\{x(t)\\} = (x * h)(t) = \\text{p.v.} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau) \\frac{1}{\\pi(t-\\tau)} d\\tau\n$$\nThe given function is the rectangular pulse $x(t) = \\operatorname{rect}(t/T)$, which is equal to $1$ for $|\\tau| < T/2$ and $0$ otherwise. Substituting this into the integral definition, the limits of integration reduce from $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $(-T/2, T/2)$, as the integrand is zero outside this interval.\n$$\n\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\text{p.v.} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \\frac{1}{t-\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we make the substitution $u = t - \\tau$, which implies $d\\tau = -du$. The limits of integration for $u$ become $t - (-T/2) = t + T/2$ and $t - T/2$.\n$$\n\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\text{p.v.} \\int_{t+T/2}^{t-T/2} \\frac{-1}{u} du = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\text{p.v.} \\int_{t-T/2}^{t+T/2} \\frac{1}{u} du\n$$\nThe antiderivative of $1/u$ is $\\ln|u|$. The Cauchy principal value is handled correctly by this antiderivative when integrating across the singularity at $u=0$ (which occurs if $t \\in (-T/2, T/2)$). Thus, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\n\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{t-T/2}^{t+T/2} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\ln|t+T/2| - \\ln|t-T/2| \\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we obtain the final simplified expression:\n$$\n\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{t+T/2}{t-T/2} \\right|\n$$\nThis expression is valid for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ except at the points of discontinuity $t = \\pm T/2$, where the argument of the logarithm becomes undefined.\n\nPart 2: Commutation with Differentiation\n\nFirst, we justify the commutation property $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathcal{H}\\{x(t)\\} = \\mathcal{H}\\{\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\\}$ from first principles, interpreting the operators within the theory of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and distributions. Differentiation with respect to $t$ is an LTI operation corresponding to convolution with the distributional derivative of the Dirac delta, $\\delta'(t)$. Its frequency response is multiplication by $j\\omega$. The Hilbert transform is also an LTI operation, a convolution with $h(t) = 1/(\\pi t)$, and has the frequency response $H(\\omega) = -j\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cdot\\}$ denote the Fourier transform operator. The frequency-domain representation of the left-hand side is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathcal{H}\\{x(t)\\}\\right\\} = (j\\omega) \\mathcal{F}\\{\\mathcal{H}\\{x(t)\\}\\} = (j\\omega) \\left( (-j\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)) \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\right) = \\omega \\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega) \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} = |\\omega| \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\}\n$$\nThe frequency-domain representation of the right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\mathcal{H}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\\right\\}\\right\\} = (-j\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)) \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\\right\\} = (-j\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)) \\left( (j\\omega) \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\right) = \\omega \\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega) \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} = |\\omega| \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\}\n$$\nSince the Fourier transforms of both sides are identical, the expressions are equal in the time domain (by the uniqueness of the Fourier transform). The commutation is a direct consequence of the associativity and commutativity of convolution in the space of tempered distributions, i.e., $\\delta'(t) * (h(t) * x(t)) = h(t) * (\\delta'(t) * x(t))$.\n\nNext, we verify this property for the rectangular pulse. We differentiate the result from Part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\ln|t+T/2| - \\ln|t-T/2| \\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dt}\\ln|f(t)| = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{t+T/2} - \\frac{1}{t-T/2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{(t-T/2) - (t+T/2)}{(t+T/2)(t-T/2)} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{-T}{t^2 - (T/2)^2} = \\frac{T}{\\pi((T/2)^2 - t^2)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the other side. The distributional derivative of $x(t) = \\operatorname{rect}(t/T) = u(t+T/2) - u(t-T/2)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, is a pair of Dirac delta functions:\n$$\nx'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = \\delta(t+T/2) - \\delta(t-T/2)\n$$\nWe take the Hilbert transform of $x'(t)$. Using linearity and the property that $\\mathcal{H}\\{\\delta(t-t_0)\\} = 1/(\\pi(t-t_0))$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\{x'(t)\\} = \\mathcal{H}\\{\\delta(t+T/2)\\} - \\mathcal{H}\\{\\delta(t-T/2)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\pi(t-(-T/2))} - \\frac{1}{\\pi(t-T/2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\{x'(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\pi(t+T/2)} - \\frac{1}{\\pi(t-T/2)} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{(t-T/2) - (t+T/2)}{(t+T/2)(t-T/2)} = \\frac{T}{\\pi((T/2)^2 - t^2)}\n$$\nThe two results are identical, which verifies the commutation property for this specific case.\n\nPart 3: Singular Behavior and Gibbs Phenomenon\n\nWe analyze the behavior of $\\hat{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{t+T/2}{t-T/2} \\right|$ near the discontinuities at $t=\\pm T/2$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior as $t \\to T/2$. We introduce a small parameter $\\epsilon > 0$ and set $t = T/2 - \\epsilon$ for an approach from the left ($t < T/2$).\n$$\n\\hat{x}(T/2 - \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{(T/2-\\epsilon)+T/2}{(T/2-\\epsilon)-T/2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{T-\\epsilon}{-\\epsilon} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left( \\frac{T-\\epsilon}{\\epsilon} \\right)\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $T-\\epsilon \\to T$, so the expression is asymptotic to $\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln(T/\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}(\\ln(T) - \\ln(\\epsilon))$. The dominant term is $-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln(\\epsilon)$. Substituting back $\\epsilon = T/2 - t$, we find the leading-order behavior as $t \\to (T/2)^-$ is $\\hat{x}(t) \\sim -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln(T/2-t)$. A similar analysis for $t = T/2+\\epsilon$ shows that $\\hat{x}(t) \\sim -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln(t-T/2)$. In general, as $t \\to T/2$, the behavior is $\\hat{x}(t) \\sim -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln|t-T/2|$.\n\nNow, let's examine the behavior as $t \\to -T/2$. Let $t = -T/2 + \\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon > 0$.\n$$\n\\hat{x}(-T/2 + \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{(-T/2+\\epsilon)+T/2}{(-T/2+\\epsilon)-T/2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left| \\frac{\\epsilon}{-T+\\epsilon} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{T-\\epsilon} \\right)\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, this is asymptotic to $\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln(\\epsilon/T) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}(\\ln(\\epsilon)-\\ln(T))$. The dominant term is $\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln(\\epsilon)$. Substituting back $\\epsilon = t+T/2$, the leading-order behavior as $t \\to -T/2$ is $\\hat{x}(t) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln|t+T/2|$.\nThus, the function exhibits logarithmic singularities at the points of discontinuity of the original signal $x(t)$.\n\nExplanation:\nThis singular behavior is the time-domain manifestation of Gibbs-like ringing in the limit of infinite bandwidth.\n\nFrom the LTI system viewpoint, $\\hat{x}(t)$ is the result of convolving the rectangular pulse $x(t)$ with the kernel $h(t)=1/(\\pi t)$. The kernel $h(t)$ is singular at $t=0$. The convolution integral is $\\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \\frac{d\\tau}{\\pi(t-\\tau)}$. When the evaluation point $t$ approaches one of the integration limits, say $T/2$, the integrand $1/(t-\\tau)$ blows up as $\\tau \\to t$. This integrable singularity of the kernel, when integrated, produces a non-integrable logarithmic singularity in the output function at the boundary.\n\nFrom the frequency-domain viewpoint, this is related to the Gibbs phenomenon. The Fourier transform of $x(t)$, $X(\\omega) = T\\operatorname{sinc}(\\omega T/(2\\pi))$, is not bandlimited. The Hilbert transform applies the filter $H(\\omega)=-j\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)$, which has a sharp discontinuity at $\\omega=0$. Any attempt to reconstruct a signal with discontinuities, such as $x(t)$ or $\\hat{x}(t)$, using a bandlimited approximation of its spectrum results in overshoot and ringing near the discontinuities (Gibbs phenomenon). If we consider a bandlimited Hilbert transform operator with cutoff frequency $\\Omega$, the output would exhibit ringing near $t=\\pm T/2$. The amplitude of the peak overshoot in this ringing is known to grow logarithmically with the bandwidth $\\Omega$. As we let the bandwidth of the system go to infinity ($\\Omega \\to \\infty$) to recover the true Hilbert transform, the ringing gets compressed infinitely close to the discontinuity, and its amplitude grows without bound. This limiting process, where the peak of the Gibbs ringing increases logarithmically with bandwidth, manifests in the final, ideal, infinite-bandwidth result as the logarithmic singularities we derived: $\\hat{x}(t) \\sim \\pm \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\ln|t\\mp T/2|$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\ln\\left|\\frac{t + \\frac{T}{2}}{t - \\frac{T}{2}}\\right|}\n$$", "id": "2852698"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the Hilbert transform through real-valued convolution, we now venture into the complex plane for a more powerful perspective.

We evaluate the integral $\\oint_C F(z) dz$ over a standard contour $C$ in the upper half-plane, consisting of a line segment along the real axis from $-R$ to $R$, indented by a small semicircle $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}$ of radius $\\epsilon$ above the pole at $z=t$, and closed by a large semicircle $\\Gamma_R$ of radius $R$.\n\nThe poles of $F(z) = \\frac{z + \\lambda a}{(z-ia)(z+ia)(t-z)}$ are at $z = ia$, $z = -ia$, and $z = t$. Since $a > 0$, only the pole at $z=ia$ lies inside the contour $C$.\n\nAccording to the residue theorem, the integral over the closed contour is:\n$$ \\oint_{C} F(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\, \\mathrm{Res}(F, ia) $$\nThe residue at the simple pole $z=ia$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Res}(F, ia) = \\lim_{z \\to ia} (z - ia)F(z) = \\lim_{z \\to ia} \\frac{z + \\lambda a}{(z+ia)(t-z)} = \\frac{ia + \\lambda a}{(2ia)(t-ia)} = \\frac{a(i + \\lambda)}{2ia(t-ia)} = \\frac{\\lambda + i}{2i(t-ia)} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Res}(F, ia) = \\frac{(\\lambda + i)(-i)}{2i(-i)(t-ia)} = \\frac{1 - i\\lambda}{2(t-ia)} = \\frac{(1 - i\\lambda)(t+ia)}{2(t-ia)(t+ia)} = \\frac{t+ia-i\\lambda t+\\lambda a}{2(t^{2}+a^{2})} = \\frac{(t+\\lambda a) + i(a-\\lambda t)}{2(t^{2}+a^{2})} $$\nTherefore, the contour integral is:\n$$ \\oint_{C} F(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\left( \\frac{(t+\\lambda a) + i(a-\\lambda t)}{2(t^{2}+a^{2})} \\right) = \\pi \\frac{i(t+\\lambda a) - (a-\\lambda t)}{t^{2}+a^{2}} $$\nThe contour integral is also the sum of its parts:\n$$ \\oint_{C} F(z) dz = \\int_{-R}^{t-\\epsilon} F(\\tau)d\\tau + \\int_{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}} F(z)dz + \\int_{t+\\epsilon}^{R} F(\\tau)d\\tau + \\int_{\\Gamma_R} F(z)dz $$\nWe analyze each part in the limit $R \\to \\infty$ and $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n1.

Let $h_{\\mathrm{id}}[n]$ denote the ideal discrete-time Hilbert transform kernel, which is the impulse response associated with the ideal frequency response $H_{\\mathrm{id}}(\\exp(j\\omega))=-j\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\omega)$ for $\\omega \\in (-\\pi,\\pi)$, with $H_{\\mathrm{id}}(1)=H_{\\mathrm{id}}(-1)=0$. A practical type-III finite impulse response approximation $h_{M}[n]$ of length $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is obtained by truncating and apodizing $h_{\\mathrm{id}}[n]$ with a real, even, nonnegative window $w[n]$ supported on $\\{0,1,\\ldots,M-1\\}$ and centered at $n_{0}=(M-1)/2$, that is, $h_{M}[n]=h_{\\mathrm{id}}[n]\\,w[n]$ for $0 \\leq n \\leq M-1$ and $h_{M}[n]=0$ otherwise. The analytic signal estimate is $z[n]=x[n]+j\\,y[n]$, where $y[n]$ is the output of filtering $x[n]$ by $h_{M}[n]$.\n\nTwo computational routes are considered:\n1) Linear convolution in the time domain: $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]=(x*h_{M})[n]$, where $x[n]=0$ outside $\\{0,\\ldots,L-1\\}$ and $h_{M}[n]=0$ outside $\\{0,\\ldots,M-1\\}$.\n2) Frequency-domain multiplication using the $N$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with zero-padding to length $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$, followed by an inverse DFT, which realizes the circular convolution $y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n]=(x \\circledast_{N} h_{M})[n]$ over indices $n \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,N-1\\}$.\n\nStarting only from core properties of linear versus circular convolution and the DFT periodicity, compare $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ and $y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n]$ on the index set $\\{0,1,\\ldots,L-1\\}$. Derive an explicit expression for the minimal integer transform length $N_{\\min}$, as a closed-form function of $L$ and $M$, such that for all $N \\geq N_{\\min}$ the circular-convolution computation exactly equals the linear-convolution result on $\\{0,1,\\ldots,L-1\\}$, thereby avoiding any wrap-around artifacts in the discrete-time Hilbert transform computation of $x[n]$ by $h_{M}[n]$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $N_{\\min}$ in terms of $L$ and $M$.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum integer transform length, $N_{\\min}$, for an $N$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) such that the circular convolution of a finite-length signal $x[n]$ and a finite impulse response (FIR) filter $h_M[n]$ yields the same result as their linear convolution, specifically over the indices corresponding to the support of the original signal $x[n]$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the properties of the signals and the convolution operations.\nThe signal $x[n]$ is real-valued and has a finite support of length $L$. It is non-zero only for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$.\nThe FIR filter $h_M[n]$ is an approximation of the ideal Hilbert transform kernel, with a finite support of length $M$. It is non-zero only for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, M-1\\}$.\n\nThe first computational route is linear convolution, defined as:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n] = (x * h_M)[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h_M[n-k]$$\nGiven the supports of $x[n]$ and $h_M[n]$, the resulting sequence $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ will have a finite support of length $L+M-1$. The non-zero values of $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ are confined to the index range $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L+M-2\\}$.\n\nThe second computational route involves the $N$-point DFT to compute the circular convolution. Let $X_N[k]$ and $H_M[k]$ be the $N$-point DFTs of $x[n]$ and $h_M[n]$ (with zero-padding to length $N$), respectively. The product $Y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[k] = X_N[k] H_M[k]$ is computed, and the inverse DFT is taken to find $y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n]$. This process is equivalent to the $N$-point circular convolution:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n] = (x \\circledast_N h_M)[n] = \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m] h_M[(n-m) \\pmod N]$$\nwhere the operation $(n-m) \\pmod N$ indicates the circular nature of the convolution, defined for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between linear and circular convolution is that the circular convolution is a time-aliased version of the linear convolution. Specifically, for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$, the relationship is:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n + kN]$$\nThis equation expresses that the values of the linear convolution $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ at indices shifted by integer multiples of the DFT length $N$ are summed up (aliased) to produce the circular convolution result.\n\nThe problem requires that the circular convolution result matches the linear convolution result over the support of the input signal $x[n]$, that is:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n] = y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n] \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$$\nSubstituting the aliasing formula, this condition becomes:\n$$\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n + kN] = y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n] \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$$\nFor this equality to hold, the sum of the aliased terms must be zero:\n$$\\sum_{k \\neq 0} y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n + kN] = 0 \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$$\nThis requires that each term in the sum must be zero for the specified range of $n$. Let us analyze the terms for positive and negative values of $k$.\n\nCase 1: $k > 0$ (e.g., $k=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$)\nWe need $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n+kN] = 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$ and for all $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$. The support of $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ is $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, L+M-2\\}$. Therefore, for $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n+kN]$ to be zero, its index must lie outside this support. We must satisfy:\n$$n + kN > L+M-2$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $k \\ge 1$ and $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$. The most restrictive condition (i.e., the one that is hardest to satisfy) occurs for the smallest $k$ and the smallest $n$. Let's choose $k=1$ and $n=0$:\n$$0 + 1 \\cdot N > L+M-2 \\implies N > L+M-2$$\nIf this condition holds, then for any $k \\ge 1$ and any $n \\ge 0$, the index $n+kN$ will be greater than $L+M-2$, ensuring all terms for $k>0$ are zero.\n\nCase 2: $k < 0$ (e.g., $k=-1, -2, -3, \\ldots$)\nWe need $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n+kN] = 0$ for all $k \\le -1$ and for all $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$. The support of $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ starts at index $0$. Therefore, for $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n+kN]$ to be zero, its index must be negative. We must satisfy:\n$$n + kN < 0$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $k \\le -1$ and $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$. Let's analyze this with $k' = -k$, where $k' \\ge 1$. The condition is $n - k'N < 0$. The most restrictive case occurs for the smallest $k'$ and the largest $n$. Let's choose $k'=1$ (i.e., $k=-1$) and $n=L-1$:\n$$(L-1) - 1 \\cdot N < 0 \\implies N > L-1$$\nIf this condition holds, then for any $k \\le -1$ and any $n \\le L-1$, the index $n+kN$ will be negative, ensuring all terms for $k<0$ are zero.\n\nTo satisfy the problem's requirement, both conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. $N > L+M-2$\n2. $N > L-1$\n\nThe variables $L$ and $M$ are natural numbers, so $L \\ge 1$ and $M \\ge 1$. This implies $M-2 \\ge -1$.\nTherefore, $L+M-2 \\ge L-1$. This means the first condition, $N > L+M-2$, is stricter than or equal to the second. Satisfying the first condition automatically satisfies the second.\n\nThus, the overall condition on the DFT length $N$ is:\n$$N > L+M-2$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal integer value $N_{\\min}$ that satisfies this strict inequality. The smallest integer greater than $L+M-2$ is $(L+M-2)+1$.\nTherefore, the minimal DFT length is:\n$$N_{\\min} = L+M-1$$\nFor any $N \\ge N_{\\min}$, the wrap-around artifacts (time-aliasing) from the circular convolution computation will not affect the output sequence in the range $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, L-1\\}$, ensuring that $y_{\\mathrm{circ}}[n]$ is identical to $y_{\\mathrm{lin}}[n]$ in this region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{L+M-1}$$", "id": "2852685"}]}
