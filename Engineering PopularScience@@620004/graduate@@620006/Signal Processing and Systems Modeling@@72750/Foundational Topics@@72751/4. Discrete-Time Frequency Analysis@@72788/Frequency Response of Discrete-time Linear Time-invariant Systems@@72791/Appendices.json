The frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is finite for all values of $\\omega \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ if and only if its denominator is never zero for any $\\omega$ in this interval. That is:\n$$\n1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k e^{-j\\omega k} \\neq 0, \\quad \\forall \\omega \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]\n$$\nTo relate this to pole locations, we consider the system's transfer function, $H(z)$, which is the Z-transform of the impulse response $h[n]$. By taking the Z-transform of the difference equation (assuming zero initial conditions as the system is initially at rest), we obtain:\n$$\nY(z) = X(z) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k} Y(z)\n$$\nThe transfer function $H(z) = Y(z)/X(z)$ is therefore:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}}\n$$\nThe poles of the system are the roots of the denominator of $H(z)$. Let $D(z) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}$. The poles are the values of $z$ for which $D(z)=0$. The frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is simply the transfer function $H(z)$ evaluated on the unit circle, where $z = e^{j\\omega}$. The condition that $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is finite for all $\\omega$ is equivalent to the condition that $D(z)$ has no roots on the unit circle, i.e., the system has no poles on the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n\nNow, we relate this to Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability. A discrete-time LTI system is defined as BIBO stable if and only if its impulse response $h[n]$ is absolutely summable, i.e., $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]| < \\infty$. For a causal LTI system described by a rational transfer function $H(z)$, this condition is equivalent to the requirement that all poles of $H(z)$ must lie strictly inside the unit circle. This means that for every pole $p_i$, its magnitude must satisfy $|p_i| < 1$.\n\nThe poles are the roots of the characteristic polynomial equation $1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k} = 0$, or equivalently, $z^N - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{N-k} = 0$. The constraint on the coefficients $\\{a_k\\}$ for BIBO stability is that all roots of this polynomial must have a magnitude strictly less than $1$.\n\nThe relationship is as follows: If a system is BIBO stable, all its poles lie strictly inside the unit circle. This directly implies that there are no poles on the unit circle. Consequently, the denominator of the frequency response, $1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k e^{-j\\omega k}$, will be non-zero for all $\\omega$, and thus $H(e^{j\\omega})$ will be finite for all frequencies. Therefore, the BIBO stability condition is a sufficient (and for causal systems, necessary) condition for the frequency response to be well-defined and finite across all frequencies.

The reconstruction must be free of aliasing.

The inverse DTFT of $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is $h[n]$, and the inverse DTFT of $H(e^{-j\\omega})$ is $h[-n]$. Therefore, the Fourier series coefficients $c_h[m]$ are given by the convolution of $h[n]$ and $h[-n]$:\n$$\nc_h[m] = (h * \\text{rev}(h))[m] = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] h[-(m-n)] = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] h[n-m]\n$$\nThis sequence, $c_h[m]$, is the autocorrelation sequence of the impulse response $h[n]$.\n\nThe problem states that the impulse response $h[n]$ is non-zero only for integers $n$ in the range $0 \\le n \\le 50$. This means $h[n]$ has a finite support of length $L = 50 - 0 + 1 = 51$.\n\nWe must now determine the support of the autocorrelation sequence $c_h[m]$. The sequence $h[n]$ is non-zero for $n \\in [0, 50]$. The sequence $h[n-m]$ is non-zero when its argument $n-m$ is in the range $[0, 50]$, which implies $n \\in [m, m+50]$. For the sum $\\sum_{n} h[n]h[n-m]$ to be non-zero, the supports of $h[n]$ and $h[n-m]$ must overlap. The supports are the intervals $[0, 50]$ and $[m, m+50]$. Overlap occurs if and only if $m \\le 50$ and $m+50 \\ge 0$. This gives the condition:\n$$\n-50 \\le m \\le 50\n$$\nThus, the autocorrelation sequence $c_h[m]$ is non-zero only for integers $m$ in the range $[-50, 50]$.

Reconstructing $P(\\omega)$ from its samples $P(\\omega_k)$ is equivalent to recovering the sequence of Fourier coefficients $c_h[m]$ from the samples. The relationship between the $N$ samples and the true coefficients is described by the aliasing formula for the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). If we compute the $N$-point inverse DFT of the samples $P(\\omega_k)$, we obtain an aliased version of the coefficient sequence, $\\tilde{c}_h[l]$:\n$$\n\\tilde{c}_h[l] = \\sum_{r=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_h[l - rN]\n$$\nFor unique reconstruction, we must be able to recover the original coefficients $c_h[m]$ for $m \\in [-50, 50]$ from $\\tilde{c}_h[l]$ for $l \\in [0, N-1]$. This requires that the non-zero portions of the shifted copies $c_h[l-rN]$ do not overlap. The support of $c_h[m]$ is the interval $[-50, 50]$, which has a length of $101$. To prevent overlap between the sequence and its shifted replicas, the shift amount $N$ must be at least the length of the support of the sequence.\nTherefore, we require $N \\ge 101$.\n\nTo verify this, suppose $N=100$.

It is therefore impossible to separate them from the single value $\\tilde{c}_h[50]$. This is aliasing. Thus, $N=100$ is insufficient.\n\nNow, let us examine the case where $N=101$. The aliasing formula is $\\tilde{c}_h[l] = \\sum_{r=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_h[l - r \\cdot 101]$. Consider any term $c_h[l-rN]$ with $r \\neq 0$. The argument is $l-rN$. The support of $c_h$ is $[-50, 50]$.\nFor $r=1$, the argument is $l-101$. For any $l \\in [0, 100]$, the maximum value of $l-101$ is $100-101 = -1$. However, we are trying to recover $c_h[m]$ for $m \\in [-50, 50]$. Let's check for overlap. The original support is $[-50, 50]$. The first shifted support (for $r=1$) is $[101-50, 101+50]=[51, 151]$. The next (for $r=-1$) is $[-101-50, -101+50] = [-151, -51]$. There is no overlap between the original support and any of its shifted replicas. Therefore, for each $m \\in [-50, 50]$, there is a unique $l \\in [0, 100]$ such that $m \\equiv l \\pmod{101}$, and for this $l$, $\\tilde{c}_h[l] = c_h[m]$. This guarantees that all $101$ coefficients can be uniquely recovered.\n\nThe smallest integer $N$ that satisfies the condition $N \\ge 101$ is $101$. The specific functional form of $h[n]$ given by the cosine terms and the Hann window is irrelevant to determining the support of $h[n]$, which is the sole determinant of the minimal value of $N$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{101}\n$$", "id": "2873884"}, {"introduction": "Filter design specifications like passband ripple and stopband attenuation are not just abstract constraints; they are critical parameters that dictate real-world system performance.

A root-mean-square (RMS) measure would be $\\sqrt{\\|e_{\\mathrm{dist}}\\|_{2}^{2}}$.\nSince $\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}[n]$ is bandlimited to $[-\\pi/M, \\pi/M]$, the energy of its decimated version is related to the energy of the original signal by a factor of $1/M$:\n$$ \\|e_{\\mathrm{dist}}\\|_{2}^{2} = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}[Mm]|^2 = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}[n]|^2 = \\frac{1}{M} \\|\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|_{2}^{2} $$\nThe energy $\\|\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|_{2}^{2}$ can be bounded using Parseval's identity and the filter specification in the passband:\n$$ \\|\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|_{2}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathcal{P}} |(H(e^{j\\omega}) - 1)X(e^{j\\omega})|^2 \\,d\\omega $$\nGiven $|H(e^{j\\omega}) - 1| \\leq \\delta_p$ for $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{P}$:\n$$ \\|\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathcal{P}} (\\delta_p |X(e^{j\\omega})|)^2 \\,d\\omega = \\delta_p^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathcal{P}} |X(e^{j\\omega})|^2 \\,d\\omega\\right) = \\delta_p^2 E_{\\mathcal{P}} $$\nTherefore, the energy of the passband distortion component is bounded by:\n$$ \\|e_{\\mathrm{dist}}\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{M} \\delta_p^2 E_{\\mathcal{P}} $$\nThe corresponding RMS measure is bounded by $\\sqrt{\\|e_{\\mathrm{dist}}\\|_{2}^{2}} \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta_p^2 E_{\\mathcal{P}}}{M}} = \\frac{\\delta_p}{\\sqrt{M}}\\sqrt{E_{\\mathcal{P}}}$.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Evaluation of the Aliasing Error Bound**\n\nThe bound derived in Task 1 is $\\|e_{\\mathrm{alias}}\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq \\delta_s^2 E_{\\mathcal{S}}$.\nWe are given the values $\\delta_s = 10^{-4}$ and $E_{\\mathcal{S}} = 0.05$.\nSubstituting these values into the bound expression:\n$$ \\text{Bound} = (10^{-4})^2 \\times 0.05 = 10^{-8} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-2} = 5 \\times 10^{-10} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $5.000 \\times 10^{-10}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.000 \\times 10^{-10}}$$", "id": "2873901"}]}
