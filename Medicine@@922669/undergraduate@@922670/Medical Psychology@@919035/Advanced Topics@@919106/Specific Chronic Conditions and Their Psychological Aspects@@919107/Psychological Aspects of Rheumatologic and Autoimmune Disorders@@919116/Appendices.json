The problem combines the non-specific contextual effects ($E_{NS}$) and the expectancy-induced response ($E_{P}$) into the overall experience of receiving placebo.\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{placebo}} = E_{NC} + E_{NS} + E_{P} $$\n\n3.  **Active Treatment Arm**: This arm experiences all the effects of the placebo arm, plus the specific pharmacological effect of the drug ($E_{D}$).\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text active} = E_{NC} + E_{NS} + E_{P} + E_{D} $$\n\nThe problem provides specific definitions for the effects to be calculated.\n\n**Placebo Effect**: This is defined as \"the additional mean decrease attributable to receiving placebo relative to no-treatment\". Mathematically, this is the difference between the mean decrease in the placebo arm and the mean decrease in the no-treatment arm.\n$$ \\text{Placebo Effect} = \\Delta_{\\text{placebo}} - \\Delta_{\\text{no-treatment}} $$\nUsing our component model, this subtraction isolates the components unique to the placebo intervention:\n$$ \\text{Placebo Effect} = (E_{NC} + E_{NS} + E_{P}) - (E_{NC}) = E_{NS} + E_{P} $$\nThis expression, representing the sum of non-specific and expectancy effects, aligns with the standard conceptualization of the \"placebo effect\" or \"placebo response\" in this context.\n\n**Drug-Specific Effect**: This is defined as \"the additional mean decrease attributable to the active drug relative to placebo\". This is the difference between the mean decrease in the active treatment arm and the mean decrease in the placebo arm.\n$$ \\text{Drug-Specific Effect} = \\Delta_{\\text{active}} - \\Delta_{\\text{placebo}} $$\nUsing our component model, this subtraction isolates the specific pharmacological action of the drug:\n$$ \\text{Drug-Specific Effect} = (E_{NC} + E_{NS} + E_{P} + E_{D}) - (E_{NC} + E_{NS} + E_{P}) = E_{D} $$\nThis correctly isolates the drug's true effect above and beyond the placebo response.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into these derived expressions.\n\n- Given data:\n  - $\\Delta_{\\text{active}} = 2.0$\n  - $\\Delta_{\\text{placebo}} = 1.2$\n  - $\\Delta_{\\text{no-treatment}} = 0.3$\n\n- Calculation of the placebo effect:\n$$ \\text{Placebo Effect} = 1.2 - 0.3 = 0.9 $$\n\n- Calculation of the drug-specific effect:\n$$ \\text{Drug-Specific Effect} = 2.0 - 1.2 = 0.8 $$\n\nThe placebo effect is a mean decrease of $0.9$ points on the pain scale.

The scenario described is a standard paradigm for evaluating the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention. The terms used—absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT)—are well-defined and standard measures of treatment effect. The data provided ($55\\%$ and $35\\%$) are plausible event rates for a psychological intervention. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and definitions provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific or logical principles. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nLet $R_I$ denote the risk of the favorable outcome (clinically meaningful fatigue reduction) in the intervention (CBT) group. Let $R_C$ denote the risk of the same outcome in the control (usual care) group. The term \"risk\" in this context refers to the probability of the event occurring.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$ R_I = 55\\% = 0.55 $$\n$$ R_C = 35\\% = 0.35 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk reduction (ARR). This metric is defined as the absolute difference in risk between the two groups. Since the intervention is expected to increase the rate of a positive outcome, this is also referred to as the absolute benefit increase. The calculation is the difference between the event rate in the intervention group and the event rate in the control group.\n\n$$ ARR = R_I - R_C $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ ARR = 0.55 - 0.35 = 0.20 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.20$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.200$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The problem defines NNT as the reciprocal of the absolute improvement favoring the intervention, which is the ARR.\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\nUsing the unrounded value of ARR for precision in the intermediate calculation:\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5 $$\nThe interpretation of this result is that, on average, $5$ patients must be treated with CBT (instead of usual care) for one additional patient to achieve a clinically meaningful fatigue reduction.\n\nThe problem requires the NNT to be rounded up to the nearest whole number. Since the calculated value of NNT is exactly the integer $5$, rounding it up to the nearest whole number yields $5$. The ceiling of $5$ is $5$.\n\nTherefore, the absolute risk reduction is $0.200$, and the Number Needed to Treat is $5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.200 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4736978"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, we constantly use screening tools to identify conditions like depression, but how much can we trust a single test result?
