All necessary data are provided, and the concepts invoked—rate-pressure product, myocardial oxygen demand, and sympathetic activation during mental stress—are standard in cardiovascular psychophysiology.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the change in the rate-pressure product ($RPP$), a clinically accepted non-invasive index of myocardial oxygen demand ($MVO_2$). The rate-pressure product is defined as the product of heart rate ($HR$) and systolic blood pressure ($SBP$). The formula is:\n$$RPP = HR \\times SBP$$\nThe units of $RPP$ are typically expressed as millimeters of mercury times beats per minute ($\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline or resting $RPP$ using the provided resting values.\nThe resting heart rate is $HR_{rest} = 70 \\text{ bpm}$.\nThe resting systolic blood pressure is $SBP_{rest} = 120 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$RPP_{rest} = HR_{rest} \\times SBP_{rest} = 70 \\times 120 = 8400$$\n\nNext, we calculate the $RPP$ during the mental arithmetic stressor.\nThe stress heart rate is $HR_{stress} = 95 \\text{ bpm}$.\nThe stress systolic blood pressure is $SBP_{stress} = 140 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$RPP_{stress} = HR_{stress} \\times SBP_{stress} = 95 \\times 140 = 13300$$\n\nThe problem requires the change in the rate-pressure product, denoted as $\\Delta RPP$, from baseline to stress. This is calculated by subtracting the resting value from the stress value:\n$$\\Delta RPP = RPP_{stress} - RPP_{rest}$$\n$$\\Delta RPP = 13300 - 8400 = 4900$$\nThe units of this change are $\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a justification of the clinical implications. The positive value of $\\Delta RPP = 4900 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$ indicates a substantial increase in the rate-pressure product. Since $RPP$ is a validated proxy for myocardial oxygen demand ($MVO_2$), it is highly likely that the patient's myocardial oxygen demand increased during the mental stress task. This is expected, as the stressor elicits sympathetic activation, leading to increases in both heart rate and blood pressure, which are the primary determinants of cardiac workload.\n\nThe clinical utility of the $RPP$ is significant, particularly in the context of cardiac rehabilitation. For patients with coronary artery disease, physical or mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia (insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle) when $MVO_2$ exceeds the oxygen supply. The $RPP$ at which ischemia occurs (e.g., onset of angina or ischemic changes on an electrocardiogram) is often reproducible for an individual and is known as the ischemic threshold. By monitoring the $RPP$ during exercise, clinicians can prescribe an exercise intensity that keeps the patient's cardiac workload safely below this threshold, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events while still achieving the benefits of rehabilitation.\n\nThe final numerical answer must be reported in $\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{bpm}$ and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $4900$.

The patient’s baseline $10$-year probability of a major CVD event is $p_{0} = 0.20$. A statin is known, from randomized trials under full adherence, to produce a relative risk reduction of $r = 0.25$ for major CVD events. In the patient’s context, psychological factors such as medication beliefs, side-effect expectancies, and self-efficacy suggest an observed medication adherence of $a = 0.70$, where adherence is defined as the proportion of time or doses sufficiently taken to confer the pharmacologic effect. Assume nonadherence yields no risk reduction and adherence yields the full trial-based relative risk reduction, so the observed effect in practice is the adherence-weighted average of these two states.\n\nUsing only core definitions of absolute risk, relative risk, and adherence-weighted average treatment effect, derive the absolute risk reduction under observed adherence and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for a $10$-year horizon. Then, briefly state how the adherence term informs shared decision-making in this scenario (no numerical output is required for the interpretive statement).

All provided data and assumptions are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The concepts of baseline risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, medication adherence, and number needed to treat (NNT) are standard in clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The provided numerical values are realistic for a clinical scenario involving statin therapy. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the absolute risk reduction under observed adherence ($ARR_{obs}$) and the corresponding Number Needed to Treat ($NNT_{obs}$), followed by a brief a qualitative statement.\n\nWe are given the following:\n- The baseline $10$-year probability of a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) event is $p_{0} = 0.20$.\n- The relative risk reduction from the statin under full adherence is $r = 0.25$.\n- The observed medication adherence is $a = 0.70$.\n\nFirst, let us define the risk of an event in a treated patient under the assumption of full adherence, denoted by $p_{t}$. The relative risk reduction, $r$, is defined as the proportional reduction in risk in the treated group compared to the control group.\n$$r = \\frac{p_{0} - p_{t}}{p_{0}}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for $p_{t}$:\n$$p_{t} = p_{0} (1 - r)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_{t} = 0.20 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.20 \\times 0.75 = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we define the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) as the simple difference in risk between the untreated and treated groups. Under ideal conditions of full adherence, the ideal $ARR$, denoted $ARR_{ideal}$, is:\n$$ARR_{ideal} = p_{0} - p_{t}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ARR_{ideal} = 0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05$$\nAlternatively, one can express $ARR_{ideal}$ directly in terms of baseline risk and relative risk reduction:\n$$ARR_{ideal} = p_{0} - p_{0}(1-r) = p_{0} - p_{0} + p_{0}r = p_{0}r$$\n$$ARR_{ideal} = 0.20 \\times 0.25 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem states that the observed effect is an adherence-weighted average. The patient is adherent with probability $a$ and non-adherent with probability $1-a$. The risk reduction is $ARR_{ideal}$ when adherent and $0$ when non-adherent. Therefore, the observed absolute risk reduction, $ARR_{obs}$, is:\n$$ARR_{obs} = (a \\times ARR_{ideal}) + ((1 - a) \\times 0)$$\n$$ARR_{obs} = a \\times ARR_{ideal}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $a$ and $ARR_{ideal}$:\n$$ARR_{obs} = 0.70 \\times 0.05 = 0.035$$\nThis is the absolute risk reduction under observed adherence.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated for a specified duration (here, $10$ years) to prevent one additional adverse outcome. The NNT under observed adherence, $NNT_{obs}$, is:\n$$NNT_{obs} = \\frac{1}{ARR_{obs}}$$\nSubstituting the value of $ARR_{obs}$:\n$$NNT_{obs} = \\frac{1}{0.035}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we first write the decimal as a fraction:\n$$0.035 = \\frac{35}{1000} = \\frac{7}{200}$$\nNow, we can calculate the $NNT_{obs}$:\n$$NNT_{obs} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{200}} = \\frac{200}{7}$$\n\nRegarding the qualitative statement, the adherence term $a$ is crucial for shared decision-making because it translates the idealized efficacy of a treatment from clinical trials into a realistic, patient-specific estimate of effectiveness. By incorporating adherence, the clinician can transparently communicate that the benefit of the medication is not a fixed property of the drug but is contingent upon the patient's actions. This creates a more accurate expectation of the outcome (e.g., the NNT increases from $1/0.05 = 20$ under perfect adherence to $200/7 \\approx 28.6$ under observed adherence). This quantitative difference provides a concrete starting point for a conversation about the patient's personal barriers to adherence (e.g., beliefs, cost, side-effect concerns) and collaborative problem-solving to maximize the potential benefit of the therapy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{200}{7}}$$", "id": "4738773"}]}
