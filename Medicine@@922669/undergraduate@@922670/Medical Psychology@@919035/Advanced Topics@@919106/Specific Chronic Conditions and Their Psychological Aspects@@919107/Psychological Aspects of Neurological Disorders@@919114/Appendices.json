This exercise shows how to use a common metric from clinical trial syntheses—the standardized mean difference, or Cohen's $d$—to predict the likely outcome of a treatment for a specific clinical population. By applying this effect size, you can move from an abstract research finding to a concrete, quantitative estimate of post-treatment symptom severity. [@problem_id:4736638]", "problem": "A neurology clinic tracks affect lability in patients with pseudobulbar affect (PBA) using the Center for Neurologic Study–Lability Scale (CNS-LS), which ranges from $7$ to $35$ points, with higher scores indicating greater emotional lability. Among $60$ consecutively enrolled patients with PBA, the baseline CNS-LS mean is $24.0$ points with a standard deviation of $6.0$ points. The clinic initiates treatment with a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). A high-quality synthesis of clinical studies reports a standardized mean difference (Cohen’s $d$) of $0.60$ favoring reduction in affect lability scores for SSRIs in this population.\n\nAssume that the reported standardized effect size describes the expected magnitude of reduction in CNS-LS scores relative to a stable baseline and that the baseline standard deviation is a suitable proxy for the relevant standard deviation for standardization in this context. Using only fundamental definitions from effect size theory and these assumptions, estimate the expected post-treatment mean CNS-LS score after initiating the SSRI.\n\nState any additional assumptions you must make, justify them briefly, and then compute the predicted post-treatment mean. Express your final answer in CNS-LS points and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established concepts in clinical research and statistics, including pseudobulbar affect (PBA), the Center for Neurologic Study–Lability Scale (CNS-LS), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, and the standardized mean difference (Cohen's $d$). The provided data are consistent and sufficient to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of the definition of Cohen's $d$, which quantifies the magnitude of an effect as a standardized difference between two means. The general formula for Cohen's $d$ is:\n$$d = \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are the means of two groups or conditions, and $\\sigma$ is a standard deviation used for standardization.\n\nIn the context of this pre-treatment vs. post-treatment study, we can denote the pre-treatment mean CNS-LS score as $\\mu_{pre}$ and the expected post-treatment mean score as $\\mu_{post}$. The problem states that the effect size, $d = 0.60$, favors a *reduction* in scores, which implies $\\mu_{pre} > \\mu_{post}$. We therefore define the difference as $\\mu_{pre} - \\mu_{post}$ to align with the positive value of $d$. The formula becomes:\n$$d = \\frac{\\mu_{pre} - \\mu_{post}}{\\sigma_{\\text{standardizer}}}$$\n\nThe problem provides specific instructions for the terms in this equation:\n1. The baseline mean CNS-LS score is given as $24.0$. We will use this value as our best estimate for $\\mu_{pre}$. So, $\\mu_{pre} = 24.0$.\n2. The problem explicitly states that \"the baseline standard deviation is a suitable proxy for the relevant standard deviation for standardization\". This means we must use the baseline standard deviation, given as $6.0$, for the denominator. So, $\\sigma_{\\text{standardizer}} = \\sigma_{pre} = 6.0$.\n3. The standardized mean difference is given as $d = 0.60$.\n\nAn additional minor assumption is required: we assume that the population-level effect size ($d=0.60$) reported in the literature is directly applicable to this specific clinic's patient sample. This is a common step in applying evidence-based practice.\n\nWith these definitions and assumptions, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$0.60 = \\frac{24.0 - \\mu_{post}}{6.0}$$\n\nOur goal is to solve for $\\mu_{post}$, the expected post-treatment mean score. We rearrange the equation algebraically:\nFirst, multiply both sides by the standard deviation, $6.0$:\n$$0.60 \\times 6.0 = 24.0 - \\mu_{post}$$\n$$3.6 = 24.0 - \\mu_{post}$$\nNext, isolate $\\mu_{post}$ by adding it to both sides and subtracting $3.6$ from both sides:\n$$\\mu_{post} = 24.0 - 3.6$$\nPerforming the subtraction gives the estimated post-treatment mean:\n$$\\mu_{post} = 20.4$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $20.4$ contains three significant figures ($2$, $0$, and $4$), so no further rounding is necessary. This value represents the expected mean CNS-LS score in the patient group after treatment with an SSRI, based on the provided data and assumptions. The post-treatment mean of $20.4$ is lower than the pre-treatment mean of $24.0$, which is consistent with the treatment causing a reduction in affect lability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.4}$$", "id": "4736638"}, {"introduction": "After an intervention, a patient's score on a neuropsychological test may change, but is this change meaningful? This practice addresses that critical question by introducing the Reliable Change Index (RCI), a tool that accounts for the inherent measurement error in any psychological test. Calculating the RCI allows clinicians to determine with statistical confidence whether an observed change reflects a true improvement or decline, rather than just random fluctuation.

The verbal delayed recall composite from an age-appropriate standardized battery is used as the outcome measure.

The test manual reports a population standard deviation $SD=12$ for this composite and a test-retest reliability coefficient $r=0.88$ over a six-month interval in a matched clinical sample.

We will proceed by first deriving the necessary formulas from the provided first principles, and then computing the final numerical value.\n\nThe problem starts from the fundamental equation of classical test theory, which decomposes an observed score $X$ into a true score $T$ and an error score $E$:\n$$X = T + E$$\nA key assumption is that the error score $E$ has a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with the true score $T$. This implies that the variance of the observed scores is the sum of the variances of the true scores and the error scores:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(T) + \\mathrm{Var}(E)$$\nReliability, $r$, is defined as the proportion of the observed score variance that is attributable to true score variance:\n$$r = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(T)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the true score variance as $\\mathrm{Var}(T) = r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X)$. Substituting this into the variance decomposition equation gives:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\mathrm{Var}(E)$$\nRearranging this equation allows us to solve for the error variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(E)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) - r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(X)(1-r)$$\nThe standard error of measurement, denoted as $S_E$, is the standard deviation of the error scores. It is the square root of the error variance:\n$$S_E = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(E)} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)(1-r)}$$\nSince the standard deviation of the observed scores, $\\mathrm{SD}(X)$, is the square root of the observed score variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$, we can write the formula for $S_E$ as:\n$$S_E = \\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{1-r}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the standard error of measurement.\n\nNext, we derive the standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, between two scores, $X_1$ and $X_2$. The difference score is $D = X_2 - X_1$. Under the null hypothesis that there is no change in the true score ($T_1 = T_2$), any observed difference is entirely due to measurement error:\n$$D = X_2 - X_1 = (T_2 + E_2) - (T_1 + E_1) = (T_2 - T_1) + (E_2 - E_1) = E_2 - E_1$$\nThe variance of this difference is $\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_2 - E_1)$. The variance of a difference between two random variables is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(A-B) = \\mathrm{Var}(A) + \\mathrm{Var}(B) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(E_2) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2)$$\nThe problem states that we should assume the errors of measurement across the two occasions are independent, which means their covariance is zero: $\\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(E_2)$$\nThe variance of the error for any single measurement is the square of the standard error of measurement, $S_E^2$. The problem also states that the reliability applies equally to both administrations, so $S_{E1} = S_{E2} = S_E$. Thus, the variance of the difference is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = S_E^2 + S_E^2 = 2S_E^2$$\nThe standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2S_E^2} = S_E \\sqrt{2}$$\nSubstituting our previously derived expression for $S_E$:\n$$S_{diff} = \\left(\\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{1-r}\\right) \\sqrt{2} = \\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{2(1-r)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the standard error of the difference.\n\nFinally, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) is defined as the observed change in scores scaled by the standard error of the difference:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nSubstituting the formula for $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{\\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{2(1-r)}}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe givens are:\nPre-surgical score: $X_1 = 62$\nPost-surgical score: $X_2 = 74$\nPopulation standard deviation: $\\mathrm{SD}(X) = 12$\nTest-retest reliability: $r = 0.88$\n\nThe observed change is $X_2 - X_1 = 74 - 62 = 12$.\nThe standard error of the difference is:\n$$S_{diff} = 12 \\sqrt{2(1-0.88)} = 12 \\sqrt{2(0.12)} = 12 \\sqrt{0.24}$$\nNow we compute the RCI:\n$$RCI = \\frac{12}{12 \\sqrt{0.24}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.24}}$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$RCI = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.24}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.4898979...} \\approx 2.04124145...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get $2.041$. The problem also asks for the interpretation based on an $\\alpha=0.05$ significance criterion, which corresponds to a critical value of $\\pm 1.96$ from the standard normal distribution. Since our calculated RCI of $2.041$ exceeds $1.96$, the observed change in verbal delayed recall would be considered statistically reliable.
