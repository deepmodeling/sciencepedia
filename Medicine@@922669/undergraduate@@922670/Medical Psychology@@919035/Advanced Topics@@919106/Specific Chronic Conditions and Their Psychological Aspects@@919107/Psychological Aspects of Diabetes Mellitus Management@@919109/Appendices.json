Standardized scales like the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) are crucial for transforming subjective feelings of distress into objective, quantifiable data that can guide clinical care. This exercise demonstrates the fundamental step of processing raw survey scores into clinically meaningful metrics, such as a total score and an elevation indicator.

The DDS comprises $17$ items scored on a Likert-type scale from $1$ to $6$, where higher values indicate greater distress. For a particular patient, the clinician reports the observed mean item score $\\bar{x} = 3.8$ across all $17$ items. In measurement theory, the arithmetic mean is defined as $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, where $n$ is the number of items and $x_i$ are the item scores. The clinic records two quantities: (i) the total sum of item scores $S$ across all DDS items, and (ii) a binary elevation indicator $I$ based on the commonly used DDS cut-point, where distress is considered elevated if $\\bar{x} \\geq 3$. For reporting purposes, encode elevation as $I = 1$ if $\\bar{x} \\geq 3$ and $I = 0$ otherwise. Using the provided information, compute $S$ and $I$.

The act of starting today imposes an immediate psychological/effort cost of $C=3$ in arbitrary utility units. The primary perceived health benefit from improved glycemic control is represented by a future benefit magnitude $B$ realized after $D=2$ days. Empirically, intertemporal choice in health behavior can be modeled using hyperbolic discounting, which assigns the present value $V$ to a delayed benefit of magnitude $B$ available after delay $D$ according to $V=\\frac{B}{1+kD}$, where $k>0$ is the individual’s discount rate. In a rational-choice framing commonly used in behavioral medicine, the person is predicted to adhere when the net present surplus $S=V-C$ is positive.\n\nUsing $B=10$, $k=0.5$, $D=2$, and $C=3$, compute the net present surplus $S=V-C$.

This problem introduces a 'commitment device,' a strategy from behavioral economics where individuals voluntarily commit to a future action to counter self-control problems. By modeling the financial and psychological impact of a deposit system, we can understand how principles like loss aversion are leveraged to increase medication adherence.

The deposit is fully refunded only if the patient achieves at least $90\\%$ daily medication adherence during the month; otherwise, the deposit is forfeited. The clinical team models daily adherence as an independent Bernoulli process with adherence probability $p$ per day, informed by prior behavioral observations.

Let $S$ be the random variable representing the total number of adherent days in the month. The problem states that daily adherence is an independent Bernoulli process, which means $S$ follows a binomial distribution, $S \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$. The probability mass function for $S$ is given by:\n$$P(S=i) = \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}$$\nfor $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe deposit is forfeited if the number of adherent days $S$ is less than a certain threshold, $k$.

The deposit is forfeited if $S < 27$.\n\nLet $L$ be the monetary loss. $L$ is a random variable that can take two values: $L=D$ if the deposit is forfeited (i.e., if $S < k$), and $L=0$ if the deposit is refunded (i.e., if $S \\ge k$). The expected monetary loss, $E[L]$, is defined as:\n$$E[L] = D \\cdot P(L=D) + 0 \\cdot P(L=0) = D \\cdot P(S < k)$$\nThe probability of forfeiture, $P(S < k)$, is the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes where the number of adherent days is less than $k$:\n$$P(S  k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} P(S=i)$$\nSubstituting the binomial probability mass function, we obtain the general analytic expression for the expected monetary loss:\n$$E[L] = D \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected loss for the given parameters: $D = \\$50$, $n=30$, $p=0.8$, and the refund threshold $k=27$.\nThe expected loss is $E[L] = 50 \\cdot P(S  27)$.\nCalculating the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{26} P(S=i)$ directly is computationally intensive.

PT, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, posits that individuals evaluate outcomes not in terms of absolute wealth, but as gains and losses relative to a reference point. A core tenet of PT is **loss aversion**: the psychological impact of a loss is significantly greater than the impact of an equivalent gain. The value function in PT is steeper in the domain of losses than in the domain of gains.\n\nIn a neutral framing without a deposit, the patient's reference point is their current state of health and finances. The benefit of medication adherence is improved long-term health, which is framed as a **gain**. However, these gains are often distant, abstract, and probabilistic, making them less motivating than more immediate concerns.\n\nThe commitment device fundamentally changes this framing. By placing a $\\$50$ deposit, the patient's reference point shifts. This $\\$50$ is now perceived as part of their endowment. The possibility of forfeiting the deposit is framed as a **loss**. The action of daily medication adherence is now perceived not just as a way to achieve a health gain, but as the necessary action to **avoid a financial loss**.\n\nDue to loss aversion, the motivation to avoid losing the $\\$50$ is psychologically more powerful than the motivation to achieve an equivalent gain (e.g., being given a $\\$50$ reward for adherence). The pain of loss looms larger than the pleasure of a gain. This framing makes the consequences of non-adherence more salient, tangible, and immediate. Each day, the decision of whether to take medication is weighed against a concrete financial penalty. This increased negative utility associated with non-adherence can create a powerful incentive to maintain the desired behavior, leading to an increase in the underlying adherence probability, $p$, in future months. The commitment device works by leveraging the asymmetry in how the human mind processes losses versus gains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{43.9}$$", "id": "4734965"}]}
