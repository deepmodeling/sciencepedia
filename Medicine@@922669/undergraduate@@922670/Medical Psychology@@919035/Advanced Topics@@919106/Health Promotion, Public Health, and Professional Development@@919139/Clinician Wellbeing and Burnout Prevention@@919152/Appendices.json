This practice takes you behind the scenes of a psychological assessment, demonstrating how raw responses to a survey are transformed into meaningful, quantitative scores. By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will master the essential skills of applying scoring rules, handling reverse-coded items, and managing missing data—foundational steps in any evidence-based approach to clinician wellbeing [@problem_id:4711632].", "problem": "A hospital is piloting a validated $10$-item Clinician Burnout Scale with two subscales: Exhaustion ($E$, items $1,3,5,7,9$) and Disengagement ($D$, items $2,4,6,8,10$). Each item is answered on a Likert scale from $1$ (strongly disagree) to $5$ (strongly agree). Higher values should indicate higher burnout after scoring.\n\nScoring rules:\n- Reverse-coded items: $5$ (in $E$), $4$ and $10$ (in $D$). For any reverse-coded item with raw response $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, compute the scored value using the linear transformation $x' = 6 - x$.\n- Subscale scores: For each subscale, compute the mean of the scored item values in that subscale. If a subscale has at most $1$ missing item, impute the missing item by the mean of the respondent’s available scored items within that subscale before computing the subscale mean. If a subscale has $2$ or more missing items, do not compute that subscale (this does not occur in the data below).\n- Total burnout score: Compute the mean of all $10$ scored items. Because both subscales have $5$ items, this equals the mean of the two subscale means.\n- Risk strata: Low risk if total score $< 2.5$, Moderate risk if $2.5 \\leq$ total score $< 3.5$, High risk if total score $\\geq 3.5$.\n\nThree clinicians provide the following item responses (raw values before reverse-coding). “Missing” indicates no response:\n- Clinician A: $x_1=4$, $x_2=3$, $x_3=5$, $x_4=2$, $x_5=2$, $x_6=3$, $x_7=4$, $x_8=4$, $x_9=5$, $x_{10}=1$.\n- Clinician B: $x_1=3$, $x_2=4$, $x_3$ missing, $x_4=3$, $x_5=1$, $x_6=5$, $x_7=2$, $x_8$ missing, $x_9=4$, $x_{10}=2$.\n- Clinician C: $x_1=2$, $x_2=2$, $x_3=2$, $x_4=4$, $x_5=4$, $x_6=2$, $x_7=2$, $x_8=2$, $x_9=2$, $x_{10}=5$.\n\nTasks:\n- Apply the scoring rules to compute each clinician’s Exhaustion and Disengagement subscale means and total burnout score, carefully handling reverse-coded items and missing data. Classify each clinician into a risk stratum based on the total score, and justify your handling of reverse-coding and imputation.\n- For grading, report only the final computed total burnout score for Clinician B, expressed in points. Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard psychometric scoring procedure that is algorithmically defined and internally consistent. No violations of scientific principles or logical fallacies were identified. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe task is to compute the burnout scores for three clinicians based on a set of precise scoring rules. The process involves handling reverse-coded items, imputing missing data where permissible, and calculating subscale and total scores.\n\nThe burnout scale has $10$ items, divided into two subscales of $5$ items each: Exhaustion ($E$) and Disengagement ($D$).\n- Exhaustion items: $I_E = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$\n- Disengagement items: $I_D = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$\n\nThe scoring procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Reverse-Coding**: For specific items, a raw response $x$ on the Likert scale of $1$ to $5$ is transformed into a scored value $x'$. The problem states some items are worded such that disagreement indicates burnout, while for others, agreement does. To ensure all scored items are directionally consistent (i.e., a higher value always indicates greater burnout), these items are reverse-coded. The transformation is given by the linear function:\n    $$x' = 6 - x$$\n    The reverse-coded items are item $5$ in subscale $E$, and items $4$ and $10$ in subscale $D$. For all other items, the scored value is equal to the raw value, $x' = x$.\n\n2.  **Imputation**: If a subscale has exactly one missing item, the missing scored value is imputed using the mean of the respondent's available scored items within that same subscale.\n\n3.  **Subscale Score Calculation**: The subscale score is the arithmetic mean of the $5$ scored items (including any imputed values) in that subscale. Let the scored values for subscale $E$ be $\\{x'_1, x'_3, x'_5, x'_7, x'_9\\}$. The Exhaustion score $\\bar{E}$ is:\n    $$\\bar{E} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i \\in I_E} x'_i$$\n    Similarly, the Disengagement score $\\bar{D}$ is:\n    $$\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i \\in I_D} x'_i$$\n\n4.  **Total Burnout Score Calculation**: The total score $T$ is the mean of all $10$ scored items. As both subscales have $5$ items, this is equivalent to the mean of the two subscale scores:\n    $$T = \\frac{\\bar{E} + \\bar{D}}{2}$$\n\n5.  **Risk Stratification**: Clinicians are classified based on their total score $T$:\n    - Low risk: $T < 2.5$\n    - Moderate risk: $2.5 \\leq T < 3.5$\n    - High risk: $T \\geq 3.5$\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each clinician.\n\n### Clinician A\nRaw responses: $x_1=4, x_2=3, x_3=5, x_4=2, x_5=2, x_6=3, x_7=4, x_8=4, x_9=5, x_{10}=1$.

To formalize this, we must first determine the baseline proportions of clinicians in each group within the total audited population.\nTotal population size: $N = n_H + n_L = 260 + 440 = 700$.\nThe initial proportion of high burnout clinicians is $P(H) = \\frac{n_H}{N} = \\frac{260}{700} = \\frac{13}{35}$.\nThe initial proportion of low burnout clinicians is $P(L) = \\frac{n_L}{N} = \\frac{440}{700} = \\frac{22}{35}$.\n\nThe intervention reduces the proportion of high burnout clinicians by an absolute amount $\\Delta = 0.20$. These clinicians are moved to the low burnout group. The new proportions, denoted by $P'$, are:\n$$P'(H) = P(H) - \\Delta = \\frac{13}{35} - 0.20 = \\frac{13}{35} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{13}{35} - \\frac{7}{35} = \\frac{6}{35}$$\n$$P'(L) = P(L) + \\Delta = \\frac{22}{35} + 0.20 = \\frac{22}{35} + \\frac{7}{35} = \\frac{29}{35}$$\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the population-average risk of an error event, $r_{\\text{pop}}$, is the weighted average of the group-specific risks, where the weights are the population proportions.\nThe risk before the intervention is:\n$$r_{\\text{pop}} = r_H P(H) + r_L P(L)$$\nThe risk after the intervention, $r'_{\\text{pop}}$, is:\n$$r'_{\\text{pop}} = r_H P'(H) + r_L P'(L)$$\nThe assumption is that the conditional risks within the groups, $r_H$ and $r_L$, remain constant. Moved clinicians adopt the risk of their new group.\n\nThe population-level absolute risk reduction, $RD_{\\text{pop}}$, is the difference between the risk before and after the intervention:\n$$RD_{\\text{pop}} = r_{\\text{pop}} - r'_{\\text{pop}} = \\left( r_H P(H) + r_L P(L) \\right) - \\left( r_H P'(H) + r_L P'(L) \\right)$$\nSubstituting $P'(H) = P(H) - \\Delta$ and $P'(L) = P(L) + \\Delta$:\n$$RD_{\\text{pop}} = \\left( r_H P(H) + r_L P(L) \\right) - \\left( r_H (P(H) - \\Delta) + r_L (P(L) + \\Delta) \\right)$$\n$$RD_{\\text{pop}} = r_H P(H) + r_L P(L) - r_H P(H) + r_H \\Delta - r_L P(L) - r_L \\Delta$$\n$$RD_{\\text{pop}} = r_H \\Delta - r_L \\Delta = \\Delta (r_H - r_L)$$\nThis shows that the population risk reduction is the absolute reduction in the proportion of the high-risk group, $\\Delta$, multiplied by the difference in risk between the two groups.\n\nWe can now substitute the numerical values:\n$$r_H - r_L = 0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075$$\n$$\\Delta = 0.20$$\n$$RD_{\\text{pop}} = 0.20 \\times 0.075 = 0.015$$\n\nFinally, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{RD_{\\text{pop}}} = \\frac{1}{0.015} = \\frac{1}{15/1000} = \\frac{1000}{15} = \\frac{200}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $66.666...$.\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $66.67$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{66.67}$$", "id": "4711652"}]}
