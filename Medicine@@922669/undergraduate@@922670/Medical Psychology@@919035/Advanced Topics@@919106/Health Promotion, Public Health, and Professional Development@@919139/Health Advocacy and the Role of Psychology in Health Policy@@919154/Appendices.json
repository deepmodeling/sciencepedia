In this framework, intention is determined by three constructs: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. For program planning, the agency uses a validated linear composite index of intention based on prior psychometric validation in similar populations, in which the predicted intention score $I$ on a $1$–$5$ scale is a weighted combination of the three constructs: attitude $A$, subjective norm $N$, and perceived behavioral control $P$, measured on $1$–$5$ Likert-type scales. The weights are $\\alpha_{A} = 0.5$, $\\alpha_{N} = 0.3$, and $\\alpha_{P} = 0.2$, consistent with a well-established finding that the three TPB components make additive and proportional contributions to intention in many health behaviors.

It is scientifically grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a well-established model in health psychology. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear linear model, all necessary parameters (weights), and all necessary variables (construct scores) to compute the predicted intention. The setup is complete, consistent, and objective, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a predicted intention score, $I$, based on a linear composite model. The model is given by the equation:\n$$\nI = \\alpha_{A}A + \\alpha_{N}N + \\alpha_{P}P\n$$\nwhere $A$ represents attitude, $N$ represents subjective norm, and $P$ represents perceived behavioral control. The respective weights for these constructs are provided as $\\alpha_{A}$, $\\alpha_{N}$, and $\\alpha_{P}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Weights: $\\alpha_{A} = 0.5$, $\\alpha_{N} = 0.3$, and $\\alpha_{P} = 0.2$.\n- Baseline construct scores: $A = 4$, $N = 2$, and $P = 3$.\n\nTo compute the predicted intention score, $I$, we substitute these values into the linear model:\n$$\nI = (0.5)(4) + (0.3)(2) + (0.2)(3)\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$\nI = 2.0 + 0.6 + 0.6\n$$\nSumming these terms gives the final intention score:\n$$\nI = 3.2\n$$\nThe predicted intention score is $3.2$ on a $1$–$5$ scale.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to identify which single construct would yield the largest marginal increase in $I$ for a one-point improvement. In a linear model of the form $I = \\alpha_{A}A + \\alpha_{N}N + \\alpha_{P}P$, the marginal change in the dependent variable ($I$) with respect to an independent variable (e.g., $A$) is given by the partial derivative of $I$ with respect to that variable. This derivative is equal to the variable's coefficient (weight).\n\nThe marginal increase in $I$ for a unit increase in each construct is:\n- For Attitude ($A$): $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A} = \\alpha_{A} = 0.5$\n- For Subjective Norm ($N$): $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial N} = \\alpha_{N} = 0.3$\n- For Perceived Behavioral Control ($P$): $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial P} = \\alpha_{P} = 0.2$\n\nBy comparing these coefficients, we can determine which construct has the greatest influence on intention:\n$$\n0.5 > 0.3 > 0.2\n$$\nSince $\\alpha_{A}$ has the largest value, a one-point improvement in Attitude ($A$) will yield the largest marginal increase in the intention score, $I$, specifically an increase of $0.5$ points.\n\nFor the interpretation of policy implications, this finding is critically important. It suggests that, within the constraints of this model, interventions aimed at changing vaccination intention would be most effective if they prioritize changing individuals' attitudes toward vaccination. The model indicates that Attitude is the most powerful determinant of intention among the three constructs. Therefore, an advocacy campaign should focus its resources on strategies that foster more positive attitudes, such as educational materials highlighting vaccine safety and effectiveness, personal testimonials, and correcting misinformation. While influencing subjective norms (e.g., by highlighting that vaccination is a community-supported behavior) and perceived behavioral control (e.g., by making vaccination more accessible and easier to schedule) are also beneficial, the greatest impact on intention, per unit of change in the construct, comes from improving attitude.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.2}\n$$", "id": "4718609"}, {"introduction": "After implementing a new health policy, the most crucial question is: 'Did it actually work?'. To answer this rigorously, we must isolate the policy's causal effect from other confounding trends. This practice [@problem_id:4718589] introduces the difference-in-differences method, a powerful quasi-experimental technique that estimates an intervention's true impact by comparing the change in an outcome for a treated group to the change in a control group over the same period. Mastering this approach enables health psychologists to provide credible, evidence-based assessments of policy effectiveness.", "problem": "A statewide health advocacy coalition worked with the Department of Health to implement a psychology-informed policy in selected primary care clinics: mandatory training on collaborative care and routine depression screening with structured referral pathways. The coalition aims to evaluate the policy’s effect on depression severity among low-income adult patients using a two-period, two-group design. The outcome is the average score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where higher values indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The treated clinics adopted the policy immediately after the pre-period, while the control clinics did not adopt the policy during the study.\n\nThe evaluation relies on the potential outcomes framework and the following assumptions that are common in difference-in-differences designs: consistency, Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), no spillovers between clinics, and parallel trends in the absence of treatment. The advanced-undergraduate research team will treat the average causal effect on the treated as the estimand of interest.\n\nYou are given the following observed average PHQ-9 scores for the two periods:\n- In treated clinics: pre-period mean $10$, post-period mean $7$.\n- In control clinics: pre-period mean $9$, post-period mean $8$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of potential outcomes and the parallel trends assumption in causal inference, derive the difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator of the average causal effect on the treated and compute its value using the given data. Express the final effect in points. No rounding is required. Provide your final numerical answer as a signed real number.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of causal inference and econometrics, it is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and it is expressed in objective, formalizable language. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) starting from the potential outcomes framework and the parallel trends assumption, and then compute its value.\n\nLet us define the notation. Let $Y_{it}$ be the outcome (average PHQ-9 score) for a clinic unit $i$ in time period $t$. The time periods are pre-treatment ($t=0$) and post-treatment ($t=1$). Let $D_i$ be an indicator variable where $D_i=1$ if clinic $i$ is in the treated group and $D_i=0$ if it is in the control group.\n\nWithin the potential outcomes framework, for any unit $i$ at time $t$, we define two potential outcomes:\n- $Y_{it}(1)$: the potential outcome if unit $i$ were to receive the treatment.\n- $Y_{it}(0)$: the potential outcome if unit $i$ were not to receive the treatment.\n\nThe estimand of interest is the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) in the post-treatment period ($t=1$). The ATT is the expected causal effect of the policy on the group that actually received it. Formally, it is defined as:\n$$\nATT = E[Y_{i1}(1) - Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1]\n$$\nThis expression represents the difference between the expected outcome under treatment and the expected outcome under no treatment, for the population of treated clinics.\n\nThe consistency assumption links potential outcomes to observed outcomes. For the treated group ($D_i=1$) in the post-period ($t=1$), the observed outcome is $Y_{i1} = Y_{i1}(1)$. Therefore, we can write the ATT as:\n$$\nATT = E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1]$, is the observed average outcome for the treated group in the post-period. This is directly estimable from the data. The second term, $E[Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1]$, is the counterfactual: the expected outcome for the treated group in the post-period *had they not been treated*. This term is unobservable.\n\nTo identify the counterfactual, we invoke the parallel trends assumption. This assumption states that, in the absence of treatment, the average change in the outcome from the pre-period to the post-period would have been the same for the treated and control groups. Mathematically:\n$$\nE[Y_{i1}(0) - Y_{i0}(0) | D_i = 1] = E[Y_{i1}(0) - Y_{i0}(0) | D_i = 0]\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression using facts about the study design.\n1.  For the control group ($D_i=0$), they are never treated. Thus, their observed outcomes are always their potential outcomes under control: $Y_{it} = Y_{it}(0)$ for $t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n2.  In the pre-period ($t=0$), the treatment has not yet been administered to any group. Therefore, the observed outcome for the treated group ($D_i=1$) is also their potential outcome under control: $Y_{i0} = Y_{i0}(0)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the parallel trends assumption gives:\n$$\nE[Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1] = E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0]\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the unobserved counterfactual, $E[Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1]$:\n$$\nE[Y_{i1}(0) | D_i = 1] = E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1] + (E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0])\n$$\nThis equation states that the counterfactual outcome for the treated group is their baseline outcome plus the trend observed in the control group.\n\nWe now substitute this identifiable expression for the counterfactual back into the definition of the ATT:\n$$\nATT = E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1] - \\left( E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1] + E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0] \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the standard DiD estimator for the ATT:\n$$\nATT = (E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1]) - (E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0])\n$$\nThis is the \"difference in differences\": the change over time in the treated group minus the change over time in the control group.\n\nNow we use the given data to compute the value of the ATT. The four observed means are:\n-   Average outcome for the treated group in the pre-period: $E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1] = 10$.\n-   Average outcome for the treated group in the post-period: $E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1] = 7$.\n-   Average outcome for the control group in the pre-period: $E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0] = 9$.\n-   Average outcome for the control group in the post-period: $E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] = 8$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in the average outcome for the treated group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{treated} = E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 1] = 7 - 10 = -3\n$$\nSecond, we calculate the change in the average outcome for the control group, which represents the secular trend:\n$$\n\\Delta_{control} = E[Y_{i1} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i0} | D_i = 0] = 8 - 9 = -1\n$$\nFinally, the DiD estimate of the ATT is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\nATT = \\Delta_{treated} - \\Delta_{control} = (-3) - (-1) = -3 + 1 = -2\n$$\nThe estimated average causal effect of the policy on the treated clinics is a reduction of $2$ points on the PHQ-9 scale.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of health economic evaluation, is well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and interpret the result. The ICER is a standard metric in health economics used to evaluate the value for money of a new health intervention compared to an existing alternative (the comparator).\n\nThe formula for the ICER is given by the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental health effect (effectiveness):\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{comparator}}}{E_{\\text{new}} - E_{\\text{comparator}}}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $\\Delta C$ represents the incremental cost, which is the difference in cost between the new intervention ($C_{\\text{new}}$) and the comparator ($C_{\\text{comparator}}$).\n- $\\Delta E$ represents the incremental effectiveness, which is the difference in health outcomes between the new intervention ($E_{\\text{new}}$) and the comparator ($E_{\\text{comparator}}$).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values for the comparison of the collaborative care model (new intervention) versus usual care (comparator) over a $1$-year horizon:\n- The incremental cost, $\\Delta C = \\$300$ United States Dollars (USD).\n- The incremental health gain, $\\Delta E = 0.02$ quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n\nSubstituting these values into the ICER formula, we can compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$300}{0.02 \\text{ QALYs}}\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\$15,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nThe problem requires the numerical result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

Health policy decisions regarding the funding or coverage of new interventions are often guided by a willingness-to-pay threshold, which represents the maximum amount a decision-maker is willing to spend to gain one unit of health outcome (in this case, one QALY). Let this threshold be denoted by $\\lambda$.\n\nThe decision rule is as follows:\n- If ICER $\\le \\lambda$, the new intervention is considered cost-effective and its adoption is generally supported.\n- If ICER $> \\lambda$, the new intervention is not considered cost-effective, and its adoption may be rejected on economic grounds.\n\nIn this problem, the jurisdiction's cost-effectiveness decision threshold is given as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nComparing our calculated ICER to this threshold:\n$$\n\\$15,000 \\text{ per QALY} \\le \\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nSince the ICER for the collaborative care model is substantially lower than the stated willingness-to-pay threshold, the intervention is deemed highly cost-effective within this policy framework. The result strongly supports the coalition's advocacy for coverage of the collaborative care model.
