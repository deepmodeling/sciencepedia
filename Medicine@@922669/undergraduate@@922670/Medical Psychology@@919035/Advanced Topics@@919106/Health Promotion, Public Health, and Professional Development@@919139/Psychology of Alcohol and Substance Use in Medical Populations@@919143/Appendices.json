This value exceeds the threshold of $90$ mg MME/day, which is associated with a substantially higher risk of overdose. The clinical context is critical: this elevated opioid-related risk is compounded by comorbid major depressive disorder and hazardous alcohol use, both of which are independent risk factors for overdose and suicide.
