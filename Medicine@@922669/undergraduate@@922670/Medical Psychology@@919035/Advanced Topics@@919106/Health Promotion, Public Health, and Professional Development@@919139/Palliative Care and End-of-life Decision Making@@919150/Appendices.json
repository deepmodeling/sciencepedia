[@problem_id:4728007]", "problem": "A terminally ill patient with advanced head and neck cancer is considering whether to refuse tube feeding. You are asked to construct an assessment plan using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T) to evaluate the patient’s capacity to refuse a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The assessment must be decision-specific and time-specific, and it should be grounded in the foundational elements of informed consent in medical ethics: disclosure, capacity, voluntariness, and authorization. Decision-making capacity is defined, in clinical bioethics and medical psychology, as the ability to demonstrate four abilities: understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing a choice. These abilities are operationalized in the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), which organizes the assessment around the same four domains. Capacity determination should be distinguished from global cognitive performance, diagnosis, or level of agreement with a clinician’s recommendation, and reversible contributors to incapacity should be addressed prior to assessment when feasible.\n\nClinical vignette: Mr. R is a 68-year-old man with recurrent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, severe dysphagia, and aspiration risk. The oncology team proposes a PEG tube to maintain nutrition and enable ongoing symptom-directed care. Mr. R states, “I do not want a tube. I want to eat what I can and keep things natural,” and requests comfort-focused treatment only. He had fluctuating attention overnight likely due to hospital-associated delirium; he received haloperidol at 23:00 the previous night and short-acting opioids at 07:00. At 10:00 he appears alert and oriented to person, place, and time but intermittently distractible. He acknowledges feeling “down” about his prognosis. His daughter is strongly advocating for PEG placement. There is no documented advance directive or prior capacity assessment.\n\nQuestion: Which assessment plan best operationalizes the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T) domains to evaluate Mr. R’s capacity to refuse PEG tube feeding, while adhering to informed consent foundations and minimizing bias?\n\nA. Schedule the capacity assessment at a time of day when sedation and delirium are least likely; first address reversible contributors (optimize analgesia without oversedation, treat delirium triggers, ensure hearing aids/glasses, and provide a quiet setting). Deliver standardized, neutral disclosure about PEG and alternatives using plain language and decision aids; then assess the four domains explicitly: for understanding, use teach-back asking Mr. R to paraphrase the purpose, potential benefits (e.g., improved caloric intake), burdens (e.g., procedure risks, discomfort), and alternatives (hand-feeding, parenteral nutrition, comfort-only). For appreciation, probe whether he can apply this information to his own situation (e.g., cancer stage, aspiration risk, impact on his daily life and values). For reasoning, elicit comparative evaluation of options and trade-offs, asking him to explain how his values (e.g., natural eating, avoiding procedures) lead to a choice and how he’d respond if complications arose. For expressing a choice, verify a clear, voluntary, and stable refusal without coercion by family or staff, rechecking consistency after 24 hours if needed given prior fluctuation. Document domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, the steps taken to mitigate reversible impairments, and the rationale for the capacity determination; if capacity is adequate across domains, honor his refusal.\n\nB. Administer the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and if the score is below 24, conclude that Mr. R lacks capacity to refuse PEG. Proceed with PEG under surrogate consent because a low MMSE score indicates global cognitive impairment.\n\nC. Inform Mr. R that refusing PEG could hasten death and immediately ask a single yes/no question: “Do you still refuse?” If he answers “yes,” infer capacity because he persisted in refusal after hearing the risk. Document the refusal and schedule PEG cancellation without further assessment.\n\nD. Because the decision is high stakes, defer to family preference. Ask the daughter to act as surrogate and proceed with PEG if she consents. Assess capacity only if family members disagree; otherwise, apply the best interest standard to override Mr. R’s refusal.\n\nE. Attempt to persuade Mr. R by emphasizing graphic complications of starvation to change his mind; if he changes his decision, note that prior refusal reflects impaired capacity due to depression. Require automatic psychiatric consultation before any refusal of life-sustaining treatment and postpone capacity assessment until he agrees to PEG.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a clinical bioethics question concerning the assessment of decision-making capacity in a terminally ill patient. The problem is to identify the best assessment plan based on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T) and the foundational principles of informed consent.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Assessment Framework:** MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T).\n- **Informed Consent Principles:** Disclosure, capacity, voluntariness, authorization.\n- **Definition of Decision-Making Capacity:** The ability to demonstrate four abilities: understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing a choice.\n- **Key Caveats:** Capacity is distinct from global cognitive performance, diagnosis, or agreement with clinicians. Reversible contributors to incapacity must be addressed.\n- **Patient Data (Vignette):** Mr. R is a 68-year-old male with recurrent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, severe dysphagia, and aspiration risk.\n- **Proposed Treatment:** Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.\n- **Patient's Stated Choice:** Refuses the PEG tube, stating, “I do not want a tube. I want to eat what I can and keep things natural,” and requests comfort-focused care.\n- **Clinical Context:**\n    - Fluctuating attention overnight, suggestive of delirium.\n    - Received haloperidol at 23:00 and short-acting opioids at 07:00.\n    - At 10:00, he is alert and oriented but intermittently distractible.\n    - Patient feels \"down\" about his prognosis.\n- **Social Context:** His daughter strongly advocates for PEG placement.\n- **Legal Context:** No advance directive or prior capacity assessment.\n- **Question:** Identify the assessment plan that best operationalizes the MacCAT-T domains to evaluate Mr. R’s capacity to refuse the PEG tube, adhering to informed consent principles and minimizing bias.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established, standard-of-care principles of medical ethics and clinical psychology. The MacCAT-T is a validated and widely accepted instrument for assessing decision-making capacity. The four-ability model (understanding, appreciation, reasoning, choice) is the legal and ethical standard in many jurisdictions. The clinical vignette is realistic and presents a common ethical dilemma.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear theoretical framework (MacCAT-T, informed consent) and a specific case, then asks for the best application of the framework to the case. A unique best answer can be determined by comparing the options against these established principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement and question are articulated in objective, clinical language. It asks for the \"best\" plan based on operationalizing a defined tool, which is an objective task of matching methodology to principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions, unrealistic conditions, or undefined terms. The scenario is a classic case study for applied bioethics. I will proceed with the detailed solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe optimal plan must systematically address the core components laid out in the problem statement: mitigating reversible factors, ensuring proper disclosure, and explicitly assessing the four domains of capacity (understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing a choice), all while respecting the principle of voluntariness.\n\n**A. Schedule the capacity assessment at a time of day when sedation and delirium are least likely; first address reversible contributors (optimize analgesia without oversedation, treat delirium triggers, ensure hearing aids/glasses, and provide a quiet setting). Deliver standardized, neutral disclosure about PEG and alternatives using plain language and decision aids; then assess the four domains explicitly: for understanding, use teach-back asking Mr. R to paraphrase the purpose, potential benefits (e.g., improved caloric intake), burdens (e.g., procedure risks, discomfort), and alternatives (hand-feeding, parenteral nutrition, comfort-only). For appreciation, probe whether he can apply this information to his own situation (e.g., cancer stage, aspiration risk, impact on his daily life and values). For reasoning, elicit comparative evaluation of options and trade-offs, asking him to explain how his values (e.g., natural eating, avoiding procedures) lead to a choice and how he’d respond if complications arose. For expressing a choice, verify a clear, voluntary, and stable refusal without coercion by family or staff, rechecking consistency after 24 hours if needed given prior fluctuation. Document domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, the steps taken to mitigate reversible impairments, and the rationale for the capacity determination; if capacity is adequate across domains, honor his refusal.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option represents a comprehensive and ethically sound approach.\n    1.  **Mitigating Reversible Factors:** It correctly prioritizes addressing potential confounders like delirium and medication effects by optimizing the timing and clinical environment. This is a critical first step for a valid assessment.\n    2.  **Disclosure:** It specifies \"standardized, neutral disclosure\" with \"plain language,\" which is the foundation of informed consent.\n    3.  **MacCAT-T - Understanding:** It proposes the \"teach-back\" method, a gold-standard technique for assessing a patient's factual understanding of the disclosed information.\n    4.  **MacCAT-T - Appreciation:** It correctly describes probing the patient's ability to relate the abstract facts to his personal reality.\n    5.  **MacCAT-T - Reasoning:** It focuses on the patient's *process* of weighing options against his personal values, which is the correct way to assess reasoning. It does not judge the outcome of his reasoning.\n    6.  **MacCAT-T - Expressing a Choice:** It addresses the need for a clear choice and also incorporates checks for stability (given the delirium history) and voluntariness (given the family pressure).\n    7.  **Conclusion:** It correctly concludes that if capacity is established, the patient's autonomous decision must be respected. This plan is a textbook execution of the principles provided in the problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Administer the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and if the score is below 24, conclude that Mr. R lacks capacity to refuse PEG. Proceed with PEG under surrogate consent because a low MMSE score indicates global cognitive impairment.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This approach is fundamentally flawed. The problem statement itself warns against this exact error: \"Capacity determination should be distinguished from global cognitive performance...\". The MMSE assesses global cognition (orientation, memory, attention) but is not a direct or valid measure of decision-specific capacity. A patient may fail parts of the MMSE but still understand, appreciate, reason about, and choose a course of treatment. This plan conflates a screening tool with a functional assessment, violating a core principle of modern capacity evaluation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Inform Mr. R that refusing PEG could hasten death and immediately ask a single yes/no question: “Do you still refuse?” If he answers “yes,” infer capacity because he persisted in refusal after hearing the risk. Document the refusal and schedule PEG cancellation without further assessment.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This plan is a gross oversimplification. While it touches upon expressing a choice, it completely bypasses the assessment of understanding, appreciation, and reasoning. A patient could persist in a choice for reasons rooted in a delusion, a profound misunderstanding of the situation, or an inability to weigh consequences. Persistence alone is not a valid proxy for capacity. This method fails to operationalize the MacCAT-T framework in any meaningful way.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because the decision is high stakes, defer to family preference. Ask the daughter to act as surrogate and proceed with PEG if she consents. Assess capacity only if family members disagree; otherwise, apply the best interest standard to override Mr. R’s refusal.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This plan violates the fundamental ethical principle of patient autonomy. The first step in any such case is to determine if the *patient* has decision-making capacity. Only if the patient is found to *lack* capacity does a surrogate decision-maker become involved. Deferring to family simply because a decision is \"high stakes\" or because a family member disagrees with the patient is ethically and legally impermissible. It preemptively strips the patient of his right to self-determination.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Attempt to persuade Mr. R by emphasizing graphic complications of starvation to change his mind; if he changes his decision, note that prior refusal reflects impaired capacity due to depression. Require automatic psychiatric consultation before any refusal of life-sustaining treatment and postpone capacity assessment until he agrees to PEG.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This plan is coercive and unethical. The goal of a capacity assessment is to evaluate the patient's decision-making process, not to pressure the patient into accepting the recommended treatment. Using \"graphic complications\" is a form of undue influence that compromises voluntariness. Furthermore, it makes two invalid assumptions: first, that a refusal of life-sustaining treatment is evidence of a mental disorder (like depression), and second, that changing one's mind under pressure proves prior incapacity. This approach subverts the patient's rights and misconceives the purpose of the assessment.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4728007"}, {"introduction": "Effective and compassionate communication is a core competency in palliative care, especially when delivering life-altering news. This practice challenges you to move beyond rigid scripts and apply foundational principles of empathy, informed consent, and shared decision-making to the sensitive task of disclosing a terminal diagnosis. Constructing a patient-centered conversation plan is essential for minimizing psychological harm and fostering a therapeutic alliance during a critical time. [@problem_id:4728244]", "problem": "A medical psychology intern is observing a senior clinician preparing to disclose a terminal diagnosis to an adult patient with advanced cancer who is accompanied by a spouse. The clinician’s goals are to respect patient autonomy, minimize psychological harm, and promote informed, values-concordant planning. The intern is asked to recommend a stepwise conversation plan that operationalizes three core tasks: checking the patient’s understanding of the situation, eliciting the patient’s concerns and values, and aligning next steps with those concerns and values. The intern must justify the recommendation from first principles grounded in definitions of informed consent, shared decision making, and evidence-based communication in serious illness care, rather than relying on rote scripts.\n\nWhich of the following plans best satisfies those aims while adhering to ethical and communication principles?\n\nA. Begin by establishing rapport and asking the patient what they understand so far, and whether they want detailed information now. With permission, deliver the diagnosis in plain language and small segments, pausing to allow emotion. Respond to emotion using the Name, Understand, Respect, Support, Explore (NURSE) framework, then use a teach-back to check understanding. Ask the patient to share their top concerns, hopes, and what matters most, and whether they prefer to include their spouse in decisions. Summarize and propose next steps that match the expressed goals, including options such as symptom-focused care or disease-directed treatments as appropriate, confirm follow-up, and identify a surrogate if desired.\n\nB. Lead with a comprehensive presentation of prognosis and all available treatments using detailed statistics and medical terminology, keeping the patient silent until the end to avoid interruptions. Conclude by handing out educational pamphlets, scheduling the next appointment, and asking if there are any questions.\n\nC. Ask the spouse to step outside to receive the terminal information privately so the spouse can decide what to disclose to the patient. Re-enter and tell the patient only that the illness is serious but avoid the word terminal unless the patient asks directly. Delay discussion of end-of-life preferences until late in the disease course to prevent distress.\n\nD. Start with reassurance to maintain hope, emphasizing that the team will continue to fight. Avoid discussing dying or hospice to prevent nocebo effects, and recommend another chemotherapy even if the expected benefit is very low. Then move quickly to document a do-not-resuscitate order to ensure clarity in case of a sudden event, postponing exploration of values until later.\n\nE. Inform the patient directly that the disease is terminal and present a binary choice between hospice or full aggressive care. Ask the patient to decide before leaving the visit to ensure decisiveness, then check understanding at the end and arrange a follow-up visit for emotional support.", "solution": "Begin from core definitions and well-tested findings that guide serious illness communication in medical psychology. First, respect for autonomy requires that decisions align with the patient’s informed preferences and values. Informed consent entails that the patient receives information about diagnosis, prognosis, risks and benefits, and alternatives in comprehensible language, has the capacity and opportunity to ask questions, and is free of coercion. Shared decision making is a collaborative process in which clinicians and patients exchange information, deliberate about options, and agree on a plan consistent with the patient’s goals. Communication science shows that during high-stress disclosures, emotional arousal narrows cognitive bandwidth, so responding to emotion first enables better processing of information. Techniques such as the Name, Understand, Respect, Support, Explore (NURSE) statements operationalize empathic responses, and the teach-back method is an evidence-based strategy for checking and improving understanding. Values elicitation is essential for aligning medical recommendations with what matters most to patients, a central expectation in palliative care.\n\nFrom these principles, a sound plan follows a sequence that prioritizes: establishing rapport and psychological safety; assessing baseline understanding and preferences for information and decision-making involvement; delivering information in digestible segments using plain language and avoiding jargon; pausing to recognize and validate emotion; checking understanding using teach-back rather than simply asking if there are questions; eliciting concerns, goals, hopes, and trade-offs; and aligning next steps with those values while ensuring continuity and follow-up. Inclusion of family should be guided by the patient’s preferences. Discussion of surrogacy and code status should be situated within the patient’s goals, not imposed without context.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This plan begins by assessing the patient’s existing understanding and invitation for information, which supports autonomy by honoring preferences for detail and pacing. It uses plain language and chunk-and-check delivery, with empathic pauses and the NURSE framework to address emotion before returning to cognition, which is consistent with evidence that emotion processing facilitates comprehension. It explicitly includes a teach-back to check understanding rather than relying on the vague question of whether there are questions. It then elicits the patient’s concerns, hopes, and values, and clarifies decision-making preferences, including whether to include the spouse. Finally, it summarizes and proposes next steps that match the expressed goals, ensuring follow-up and identifying a surrogate if desired. This plan operationalizes checking understanding, eliciting concerns and values, and aligning next steps, while adhering to informed consent and shared decision making. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This plan front-loads dense information with technical jargon and detailed statistics without first assessing the patient’s baseline understanding, information preferences, or emotional state. It suppresses patient participation during the explanation, undermining shared decision making and increasing cognitive overload. It omits empathic response and uses a perfunctory end-of-visit question rather than structured teach-back. It does not elicit values or align next steps with those values. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This plan violates autonomy by privileging the spouse’s preferences over the patient’s without first confirming the patient’s wishes regarding information sharing. Withholding the terminal nature unless the patient asks directly risks deception and undermines informed consent. Deferring end-of-life discussions until late disregards the benefits of timely values elicitation and can contribute to care misaligned with the patient’s goals. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This plan relies on premature reassurance and avoids accurate prognostic language, which can impede informed consent. Recommending further chemotherapy with very low expected benefit without first eliciting values risks nonbeneficence and ignores shared decision making. Moving quickly to document a do-not-resuscitate order without context or values clarification can feel coercive and misaligned. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. This plan offers a forced binary between hospice and aggressive care without first eliciting values or exploring intermediate options, which oversimplifies complex decisions. Pressuring an immediate decision risks coercion and reduces thoughtful deliberation. Checking understanding at the end, after forcing a decision, subverts the purpose of teach-back. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is the plan that integrates assessment of understanding and preferences, empathic response, structured checking of comprehension, elicitation of concerns and values, and alignment of next steps with those values, with attention to follow-up and surrogate identification if desired.

He is a 68-year-old man with intact sensorium who can describe his situation coherently. He has a prior advance directive (a living will) signed 7 years ago stating he would not want invasive mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition if he had a terminal illness. He also has a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form completed 1 year ago indicating Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) and Limited Interventions. Currently, the patient says, “I want aggressive treatment to get me through this pneumonia, including intensive care and noninvasive ventilation; if it is not helping after about a week, I want to stop and focus on comfort.” His daughter requests “everything” including intubation “until he gets better,” and his son insists the documents must be followed strictly.

It is a well-formed, scientifically sound, and objective problem in applied medical ethics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Workflow\n\nThe core of this problem rests on the principle of patient autonomy, which is contingent upon decision-making capacity. The provided principles dictate a precise logical sequence.\n\n1.  **Assess Decision-Making Capacity**: The patient is described as having \"intact sensorium\" and being \"coherent.\" While this suggests capacity, a formal assessment is the indispensable first step. According to the provided definition, this involves confirming the patient can understand the medical situation, appreciate the consequences of his choices, reason through the options, and communicate a consistent choice. This assessment establishes the foundation for all subsequent actions.\n\n2.  **Conduct an Informed Consent Discussion**: Assuming capacity is confirmed, the principle that \"informed, contemporaneous preferences...take precedence\" becomes operative. To ensure the patient's preference is genuinely *informed*, the clinical team must engage in a thorough discussion. This conversation must cover:\n    -   **Diagnosis and Prognosis**: The nature of the acute illness (pneumonia) and its prognosis, situated within the context of his underlying terminal illness (metastatic lung cancer).\n    -   **Treatment Options**: The full spectrum of choices, including their potential benefits, burdens, and risks. This includes comfort-focused care, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation (intubation).\n    -   **Elicit Goals and Values**: The discussion should explore what the patient values most at this stage. His statement already indicates a sophisticated goal: a time-limited trial of aggressive therapy. This suggests he is trying to balance a chance at recovery from the acute illness with his long-standing wish to avoid prolonged, burdensome interventions for his terminal condition.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Document a Shared Plan**: The patient's proposal for a \"time-limited trial\" is an excellent starting point for shared decision-making. The team should work with the patient to operationalize this desire. This involves:\n    -   Defining the specific interventions (e.g., a trial of noninvasive ventilation in the ICU).\n    -   Setting a clear timeframe (e.g., \"about a week,\" which could be formalized to 5-7 days).\n    -   Establishing explicit \"stopping rules\"—objective clinical criteria that would define whether the trial is \"helping\" or not (e.g., improvement in oxygenation, resolution of respiratory distress vs. worsening organ failure).\n    -   Defining the plan if the trial fails: a transition to comfort-focused care, as per his stated wish.\n\n4.  **Update Medical Orders**: A new, agreed-upon plan renders prior documents, like the POLST, outdated for the current situation. The POLST must be reviewed and formally updated with the patient's consent to reflect the new plan (e.g., changing \"Limited Interventions\" to \"Full Treatment for a time-limited trial,\" while likely reaffirming the DNR status unless he explicitly wishes to change that as well). This ensures the patient's current wishes are legally and operationally respected.\n\n5.  **Communicate with Family**: The clinical team has a duty to communicate clearly with the family (daughter and son). This communication should explain that the patient has decision-making capacity and has made an informed choice. The team should explain the new plan, its rationale (a time-limited trial), and emphasize that it is the *patient's* decision that is being honored, in accordance with ethical and legal standards. This addresses the family conflict by centering the capable patient as the rightful decision-maker.\n\n6.  **Manage Persistent Conflict**: If, despite these steps, profound conflict with the family persists to the point of impeding care, an ethics consultation becomes appropriate. The role of the ethics committee would be to mediate the discussion, reinforce the ethical principles at play, and support the clinical team in upholding the patient's autonomous decision. It is not the first step but a resource for unresolved impasses.\n\nThis multi-step workflow respects the patient's autonomy, acknowledges the nuances of his request, and provides a structured approach to resolving the apparent contradictions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Immediately implement full code and escalate to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because the patient now requests aggressive care; prior directives can be ignored in emergencies and updated later if time permits.**\nThis option is flawed. It advocates for immediate action without first formally assessing decision-making capacity and ensuring the patient's request is fully informed through a detailed discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives. Treating prior directives as something to be \"ignored\" is incorrect; they are superseded by the *informed choice* of a capable patient, a status that has not yet been rigorously established. It also incorrectly assumes \"aggressive care\" means \"full code,\" when the patient's POLST is DNR and he did not explicitly request resuscitation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. First assess decision-making capacity using the standard four abilities; provide a clear, honest discussion of diagnosis, prognosis, and the range of interventions, then elicit the patient’s values and goals; verify the authenticity, applicability, and clinical specificity of the advance directive and the POLST; if capacity is intact and the patient requests a time-limited trial, co-create and document a revised plan (for example, a 7-day trial of defined interventions with stopping rules), update medical orders including the POLST accordingly, inform the surrogate and family; if conflict persists despite intact capacity, prioritize the patient’s current informed choice and consult ethics only if coercion, unresolved uncertainty, or team-family impasse remains.**\nThis option precisely follows the ethically and clinically correct workflow derived from the foundational principles. It begins with the crucial assessment of capacity, proceeds to informed consent and shared decision-making, respects the patient's nuanced request for a time-limited trial, includes documentation and updating of the POLST, mandates family communication, and appropriately situates ethics consultation as a recourse for unresolved conflict rather than a first step.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Defer to the most recent legal document (the POLST) and deny resuscitation and higher-level interventions because written directives always supersede verbal statements, thereby minimizing liability.**\nThis option fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of advance directives and POLST forms. They are intended to guide care when a patient *lacks* capacity. The provided principle explicitly states that a capable patient's current informed preferences generally take precedence. The assertion that \"written directives always supersede verbal statements\" is false in this context. Violating the patient's current, expressed wishes would be a violation of his autonomy. Acting to \"minimize liability\" is not the primary ethical driver; honoring patient autonomy is.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Designate the daughter to exercise substituted judgment immediately and follow her request for maximal care because family members are closest to the patient and their wishes should prevail; the patient’s preferences can be clarified later.**\nThis option is grievously incorrect. It violates the core principle of patient autonomy. Substituted judgment by a surrogate is only initiated when the patient is determined to *lack* decision-making capacity. The evidence in the problem statement points toward the patient having capacity. Bypassing a capable patient to follow a family member's wishes is ethically and legally impermissible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Convene an ethics consultation before any detailed discussion with the patient, as conflicts are best addressed by neutral third parties to avoid bias in clinician-patient communication.**\nThis option is premature. The primary locus of decision-making is the relationship between the clinician and the patient. Calling an ethics consultation before the clinical team has even had a thorough discussion with the capacitated patient undermines this primary relationship. The conflict may be readily resolvable through clear communication and shared decision-making with the patient himself. An ethics consult is a valuable tool for persistent, unresolvable conflict, not a prerequisite for routine (albeit complex) clinician-patient communication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4728334"}]}
