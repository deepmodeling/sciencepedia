It is scientifically grounded in the principles of implementation science and statistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The task is to derive and compute a composite fidelity index.\n\nThe core definition of fidelity is given as the proportion of protocolized steps actually completed out of those prescribed. Each prescribed step is a binary opportunity for adherence. A site-standardized composite fidelity index must aggregate the data from both sites in a way that properly accounts for the different number of sessions and prescribed steps at each site. The most direct and principled method is to calculate the total number of completed steps across both sites and divide by the total number of prescribed steps across both sites. This is equivalent to a weighted average of the individual site fidelities, where the weight for each site is the total number of prescribed steps at that site.\n\nLet us define the variables for Site A and Site B.\nFor Site A:\nNumber of sessions: $N_A = 36$\nPrescribed steps per session: $k_A = 12$\nTotal completed steps: $C_A = 378$\n\nFor Site B:\nNumber of sessions: $N_B = 30$\nPrescribed steps per session: $k_B = 15$\nTotal completed steps: $C_B = 396$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of prescribed steps (i.e., adherence opportunities) for each site. Let $T_A$ and $T_B$ be the total prescribed steps for Site A and Site B, respectively.\nFor Site A, the total number of prescribed steps is:\n$$T_A = N_A \\times k_A = 36 \\times 12 = 432$$\nFor Site B, the total number of prescribed steps is:\n$$T_B = N_B \\times k_B = 30 \\times 15 = 450$$\n\nThe fidelity for each site, let's denote them $F_A$ and $F_B$, can be calculated as the ratio of completed steps to total prescribed steps for that site.\n$$F_A = \\frac{C_A}{T_A} = \\frac{378}{432}$$\n$$F_B = \\frac{C_B}{T_B} = \\frac{396}{450}$$\n\nTo derive the site-standardized composite fidelity index, denoted as $F_{composite}$, we sum the completed steps from both sites and divide by the sum of the total prescribed steps from both sites. This method correctly pools all adherence opportunities and outcomes into a single aggregate measure, naturally weighting by the volume of activity at each site.\n\nThe total number of completed steps across both sites is:\n$$C_{total} = C_A + C_B = 378 + 396 = 774$$\n\nThe total number of prescribed steps across both sites is:\n$$T_{total} = T_A + T_B = 432 + 450 = 882$$\n\nThe composite fidelity index is therefore the ratio of these total values:\n$$F_{composite} = \\frac{C_{total}}{T_{total}} = \\frac{774}{882}$$\n\nThis formula can also be expressed as a weighted average of the individual site fidelities, $F_A$ and $F_B$, where the weights are the total number of prescribed steps, $T_A$ and $T_B$:\n$$F_{composite} = \\frac{T_A F_A + T_B F_B}{T_A + T_B} = \\frac{432 \\left(\\frac{378}{432}\\right) + 450 \\left(\\frac{396}{450}\\right)}{432 + 450} = \\frac{378 + 396}{882} = \\frac{774}{882}$$\nThis confirms the validity of the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $F_{composite}$ and round it to four significant figures.\n$$F_{composite} = \\frac{774}{882} \\approx 0.87755102...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we look at the fifth significant digit. The first four are $8$, $7$, $7$, $5$.

The scenario is a realistic application of quantitative methods to implementation science. The assumptions, while simplifications, are explicitly stated to create a tractable model, which is standard scientific practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A reasoned solution is therefore warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: calculating the proportions for Reach, Adoption, and Maintenance; deriving an expression for the probability of sustained access; and evaluating this probability numerically.\n\n**Part 1: Compute Individual-Level Reach (R), Setting-Level Adoption (A), and Setting-Level Maintenance (M)**\n\nThese quantities are computed as proportions directly from the provided data, according to their standard definitions within the RE-AIM framework.\n\n- **Reach ($R$)**: The proportion of eligible individuals who participate in the program.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Eligible adults who enroll}}{\\text{Total eligible adult patients}} = \\frac{N_{enroll}}{N_{elig}} = \\frac{200}{800} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n- **Adoption ($A$)**: The proportion of settings (clinics) that adopt the program.\n$$A = \\frac{\\text{Clinics that adopt}}{\\text{Total primary care clinics}} = \\frac{N_{adopt}}{N_{clinics}} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\n- **Maintenance ($M$)**: The proportion of *adopting* settings that sustain the program over time. This is a conditional measure.\n$$M = \\frac{\\text{Adopting clinics sustaining delivery}}{\\text{Clinics that adopt}} = \\frac{N_{sustain}}{N_{adopt}} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derive an Expression for the Probability of Sustained Access**\n\nWe must find the probability that a randomly selected eligible adult receives sustained counseling access. This is a composite event. For this to occur, two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. The individual must enroll in the program.\n2. The individual must be served by a clinic that both adopted and sustained the program.\n\nLet $P_{access}$ be the probability of this composite event.\nLet $E_{enroll}$ be the event that a randomly selected eligible adult enrolls. The probability of this event is the reach, $P(E_{enroll}) = R$.\nLet $E_{clinic\\_sustains}$ be the event that a randomly selected eligible adult's clinic is one that both adopted and sustained the program. We must find $P(E_{clinic\\_sustains})$.\n\nBy assumption (i), setting-level proportions can be interpreted as individual-level probabilities. The event $E_{clinic\\_sustains}$ is the intersection of two clinic-level events: the clinic adopted ($C_{adopt}$) and the clinic maintained the program ($C_{maintain}$). Its probability is:\n$$P(E_{clinic\\_sustains}) = P(C_{adopt} \\cap C_{maintain})$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write this as:\n$$P(C_{adopt} \\cap C_{maintain}) = P(C_{maintain} | C_{adopt}) \\times P(C_{adopt})$$\nFrom the definitions in Part 1 and assumption (i):\n- $P(C_{adopt})$ is the probability that a random individual's clinic adopts, which is equal to the setting-level adoption rate, $A$.\n- $P(C_{maintain} | C_{adopt})$ is the probability that a clinic maintains the program, *given* it has already adopted. This is precisely the definition of setting-level maintenance, $M$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a random individual's clinic is one that adopted and sustained is:\n$$P(E_{clinic\\_sustains}) = M \\times A$$\n\nNow, we can find the total probability, $P_{access}$. The event of interest is the intersection of the individual enrolling and their clinic successfully sustaining the program: $E_{enroll} \\cap E_{clinic\\_sustains}$.\nAssumption (ii) states that the events of an individual enrolling, their clinic adopting, and an adopting clinic sustaining are independent. This allows us to treat $E_{enroll}$ and $E_{clinic\\_sustains}$ as independent events. Using the multiplication rule for independent events:\n$$P_{access} = P(E_{enroll}) \\times P(E_{clinic\\_sustains})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each probability, we arrive at the derived expression:\n$$P_{access} = R \\times A \\times M$$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluate the Probability Numerically**\n\nUsing the values for $R$, $A$, and $M$ calculated in Part 1, we can compute the numerical value of $P_{access}$.\n\n$$P_{access} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$P_{access} = \\frac{1 \\times 3 \\times 2}{4 \\times 5 \\times 3} = \\frac{6}{60} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected eligible adult in this health system receives sustained counseling access is $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\n**Interpretation of Constraining Factors**\n\nThe combined probability of sustained access is the product of reach ($R = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$), adoption ($A = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$), and maintenance ($M = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.67$). Under the given data and independence assumption, the combined profile is most constrained by individual-level reach, which is the smallest of the three multiplicative factors and represents the primary bottleneck to the program's overall impact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$$", "id": "4721384"}, {"introduction": "Rigorously evaluating implementation strategies often requires specialized research designs.

The definitions of variance, covariance, and the intra-class correlation coefficient are fundamental in statistics. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information to derive the quantity of interest and presents no contradictions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a formalizable statistical derivation and calculation, not metaphorical or subjective. It is not ill-posed, trivial, or outside the scope of scientific verification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe design effect, $DE$, is defined as the ratio of the variance of the sample mean under the clustered design, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{clustered}}$, to the variance of the sample mean under a simple random sample (SRS) of the same size, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{SRS}}$.\n$$DE = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{clustered}}}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{SRS}}}$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the variance under simple random sampling. In an SRS of size $n$, all observations are independent. The variance of the mean is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{SRS}} = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} Y_k\\right)$$\nDue to independence, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y})_{\\text{SRS}} = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}(Y_k) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sigma^2 = \\frac{n\\sigma^2}{n^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$$\n\nNext, we determine the variance under the clustered design.

The total sum can be written as $\\sum_{i=1}^{K} T_i$. Because outcomes from different clinics are independent, the variance of the total sum is the sum of the variances of the cluster totals:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{K} T_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\mathrm{Var}(T_i)$$\nNow we must find the variance of a single cluster total, $\\mathrm{Var}(T_i)$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(T_i) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right)$$\nThe variance of a sum of correlated variables is the sum of all their covariances:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(T_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik})$$\nThis sum can be split into two parts: terms where $j=k$ (variances) and terms where $j \\neq k$ (covariances).\nThere are $m$ variance terms. Each is $\\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij}) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \\sigma^2$.\nThere are $m(m-1)$ ordered pairs of distinct indices $(j,k)$ where $j \\neq k$. For these pairs, the covariance is given by the ICC definition: $\\rho = \\mathrm{Corr}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik})}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{ij})\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{ik})}}$. This gives $\\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}) = \\rho \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 \\sigma^2} = \\rho \\sigma^2$.\nSo, the variance of a cluster total is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(T_i) = m \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(Y_{ij}) + m(m-1) \\cdot \\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik})$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(T_i) = m\\sigma^2 + m(m-1)\\rho\\sigma^2 = m\\sigma^2(1 + (m-1)\\rho)$$\nSince the structure is the same for all $K$ clusters, $\\mathrm{Var}(T_i)$ is constant for all $i$.
