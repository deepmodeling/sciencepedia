It presents a standard initial value problem based on the Malthusian growth model and a clearly defined linear heuristic, both of which are formalizable and relevant to the study of cognitive biases in public health. All necessary parameters are provided, and no contradictions exist. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the true exponential growth of cumulative cases, denoted by $C(t)$. The growth is governed by the differential equation for proportional growth:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = r\\,C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation that is separable. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C} dC = r\\,dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{C} dC = \\int r\\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|C(t)| = r\\,t + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. To solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n|C(t)| = \\exp(r\\,t + K) = \\exp(K)\\exp(r\\,t)\n$$\nSince $C(t)$ represents the number of cases, it must be non-negative, so we can remove the absolute value bars. We define a new constant $A = \\exp(K)$, which gives:\n$$\nC(t) = A\\exp(r\\,t)\n$$\nTo find the value of $A$, we apply the initial condition given in the problem, $C(0) = C_0 = 200$.\n$$\nC(0) = A\\exp(r \\cdot 0) = A\\exp(0) = A \\cdot 1 = A\n$$\nThus, the constant $A$ is equal to the initial number of cases, $C_0$. The specific solution for the exponential growth of cases is:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0\\exp(r\\,t)\n$$\n\nThe second step is to derive the expression for the linear heuristic forecast, $L(t)$. The problem states that this forecast is formed by starting with the initial value $C_0$ and adding the initial daily increment for each day $t$. The initial daily increment is the rate of change at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\text{Initial daily increment} = \\left.\\frac{dC}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = r\\,C(0) = r\\,C_0\n$$\nThe linear forecast $L(t)$ is therefore a linear function of time $t$ with a starting value (y-intercept) of $C_0$ and a constant slope of $r\\,C_0$. The equation for $L(t)$ is:\n$$\nL(t) = C_0 + (r\\,C_0)t\n$$\nThis expression can be factored to give:\n$$\nL(t) = C_0(1 + r\\,t)\n$$\n\nThe third step is to compute the multiplicative underestimation factor, which is the ratio of the true projection to the linear heuristic projection at time $t=14$ days. The problem provides the constants $C_0 = 200$, $r = 0.08\\text{ day}^{-1}$, and we need to evaluate the functions at $t=14$ days.\n\nThe ratio is defined as $\\frac{C(14)}{L(14)}$. Let's substitute the derived expressions for $C(t)$ and $L(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{L(t)} = \\frac{C_0\\exp(r\\,t)}{C_0(1 + r\\,t)} = \\frac{\\exp(r\\,t)}{1 + r\\,t}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values $r=0.08$ and $t=14$:\n$$\n\\frac{C(14)}{L(14)} = \\frac{\\exp(0.08 \\times 14)}{1 + 0.08 \\times 14}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the product in the exponent and the denominator:\n$$\nr \\times t = 0.08 \\times 14 = 1.12\n$$\nSubstituting this value back into the ratio expression:\n$$\n\\frac{C(14)}{L(14)} = \\frac{\\exp(1.12)}{1 + 1.12} = \\frac{\\exp(1.12)}{2.12}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\n\\exp(1.12) \\approx 3.064853\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C(14)}{L(14)} \\approx \\frac{3.064853}{2.12} \\approx 1.445685\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.446$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. The problem requires the application of fundamental definitions to derive a posterior probability, a standard exercise in Bayesian inference.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $I$: The event that a randomly selected worker is infected.\n- $N$: The event that a randomly selected worker is not infected. This is the complement of $I$, so $P(N) = 1 - P(I)$.\n- $T^+$: The event that the worker's test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the worker's test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The base rate, or prior probability of infection: $P(I) = 0.05$.\n   This implies the prior probability of not being infected is $P(N) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n2. The sensitivity of the test, which is the conditional probability of a positive test given that the worker is infected: $P(T^+ \\mid I) = 0.95$.\n3. The specificity of the test, which is the conditional probability of a negative test given that the worker is not infected: $P(T^- \\mid N) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that the worker is not infected. This is the complement of specificity:\n$P(T^+ \\mid N) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid N) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe objective is to derive the posterior probability $P(I \\mid T^+)$, which is the probability that the worker is infected given a positive test result. We will derive this from first principles as requested.\n\nThe definition of conditional probability states:\n$$P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(I \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of being infected and testing positive, and $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nFirst, let us find the numerator, $P(I \\cap T^+)$. We can rearrange the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^+ \\mid I) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(I)}$, to solve for the joint probability:\n$$P(I \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result in the population.\n\nNext, let us find the denominator, $P(T^+)$. The law of total probability allows us to express $P(T^+)$ by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: the worker is infected and tests positive, or the worker is not infected and tests positive.\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap I) + P(T^+ \\cap N)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I) + P(T^+ \\mid N) P(N)$$\nThe first term, $P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I)$, represents the fraction of the population that are true positives. The second term, $P(T^+ \\mid N) P(N)$, represents the fraction of the population that are false positives.\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the original formula for $P(I \\mid T^+)$, we arrive at Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I)}{P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I) + P(T^+ \\mid N) P(N)}$$\nThis is the general form derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $P(I) = 0.05$\n- $P(N) = 0.95$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid I) = 0.95$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid N) = 0.02$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$P(I \\cap T^+) = (0.95) \\times (0.05) = 0.0475$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95) \\times (0.05) + (0.02) \\times (0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0475 + 0.0190 = 0.0665$$\nTherefore, the posterior probability is:\n$$P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0665}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.7142857...$.\n\nBrief interpretation:\nThe posterior probability $P(I \\mid T^+) = 5/7 \\approx 0.714$ is the updated probability that the worker is infected, given the positive result. This is a significant increase from the initial base rate of $0.05$. However, it is crucial to note that it is not a certainty. There remains a probability of $1 - 5/7 = 2/7 \\approx 0.286$ that the positive test is a false positive.\n\nA rational isolation decision must weigh the costs and benefits of two possible errors:\n1.  Unnecessarily isolating a non-infected person (a cost incurred with probability $\\approx 0.286$).\n2.  Failing to isolate an infected person, risking workplace transmission (a cost incurred if a positive case is not isolated).\n\nGiven that the probability of actual infection is substantially greater than $0.5$ (specifically, $\\approx 0.714$), a public health policy aimed at minimizing transmission would deem the risk of an outbreak to be greater than the cost of a temporary, unnecessary isolation. Therefore, the rational decision is for the worker to isolate immediately to prevent potential spread, pending a confirmatory test if the protocol allows.

A \"60% risk reduction\" may sound impressive, but its real-world impact depends on the initial risk level. This exercise explores the critical distinction between relative and absolute risk reduction, demonstrating how focusing on relative figures alone can be misleading and how to calculate a more informative metric, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), to gain a clearer picture of an intervention's effectiveness [@problem_id:4729211].", "problem": "A municipal health department is deciding how to communicate the benefit of a new respiratory virus vaccine to the public. The best available evidence indicates that the one-month absolute risk of infection for an unvaccinated person in this community is $0.5\\%$, and that vaccination yields a relative risk reduction of $60\\%$ over that month.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of risk and treatment effect, let $p_{0}$ denote the one-month absolute risk of infection without vaccination, $p_{1}$ denote the one-month absolute risk of infection with vaccination, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) be defined as $\\mathrm{ARR} = p_{0} - p_{1}$, and the relative risk reduction (RRR) be defined as $\\mathrm{RRR} = \\frac{p_{0} - p_{1}}{p_{0}}$.

All necessary definitions and data are provided.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the Absolute Risk Reduction ($\\mathrm{ARR}$) in terms of the Relative Risk Reduction ($\\mathrm{RRR}$) and the baseline risk ($p_0$). The definitions provided are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = p_0 - p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{RRR} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0}\n$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the absolute risk of infection without vaccination and $p_1$ is the absolute risk of infection with vaccination.\n\nBy substituting the definition of $\\mathrm{ARR}$ into the expression for $\\mathrm{RRR}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RRR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{ARR}}{p_0}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $p_0$ yields the desired expression for $\\mathrm{ARR}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{RRR}$ and $p_0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = \\mathrm{RRR} \\times p_0\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for $\\mathrm{ARR}$ and the Number Needed to Treat ($\\mathrm{NNT}$).

A core finding in the psychology of risk perception is that people are susceptible to cognitive biases, particularly **denominator neglect** (also known as base rate neglect). This bias describes the tendency to focus on the numerator (the number of times an event happens) while ignoring the denominator (the overall population or opportunity for it to happen).\n\nIn this context, the $\\mathrm{RRR}$ of $60\\%$ is a large, salient number that captures attention. However, it is a relative measure whose practical impact is entirely dependent on the baseline risk, $p_0$. When the baseline risk is very low, as it is here with $p_0 = 0.5\\%$, even a large $\\mathrm{RRR}$ results in a very small $\\mathrm{ARR}$. The $\\mathrm{ARR}$ is only $0.003$, or $0.3\\%$. An individual's absolute risk of infection is reduced from $0.5\\%$ to $0.2\\%$. While this is a $60\\%$ relative reduction, the absolute change in risk is minuscule.\n\nThis is an example of the **framing effect**, where the way information is presented significantly influences perception and decision-making. Presenting the benefit as a large relative number ($60\\%$ reduction) makes the vaccine appear highly effective. In contrast, framing it with absolute measures paints a different picture. The $\\mathrm{ARR}$ of $0.3\\%$ is a small number and may seem less impressive. The $\\mathrm{NNT}$ of $333$ implies that, on average, $333$ people must be vaccinated to prevent one case of infection over the specified month, a number which may seem large and could lead some to question the vaccine's utility at a population level.\n\nTherefore, communicating only the $\\mathrm{RRR}$ exploits the denominator neglect bias by obscuring the low baseline risk. This can create an exaggerated perception of the vaccine's benefit, potentially misleading public behavior. For transparent and ethical risk communication, it is crucial to present both relative and absolute measures of effect, such as $\\mathrm{RRR}$, $\\mathrm{ARR}$, and $\\mathrm{NNT}$, to provide a complete and balanced understanding of a health intervention's impact.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.00 \\times 10^{-3} & 333 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4729211"}]}
