{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A foundational skill in promoting health equity is the ability to identify and quantify disparities from observational data. This exercise guides you through the process of calculating care rates for different demographic groups from a hypothetical dataset on hospice referrals. By computing disparity ratios and a composite inequity measure, you will practice quantifying systemic inequities, a critical first step in targeting interventions and evaluating the cultural competence of a healthcare system [@problem_id:4713008].", "problem": "An integrated health system examines hospice referrals recorded in its Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for patients with terminal illness. Clinical eligibility for hospice is determined by an evidence-based protocol that requires a Palliative Performance Scale score less than or equal to $50$ and at least $2$ hospitalizations in the prior $6$ months. The system reports subgroup counts among patients who meet clinical eligibility and whether they received a hospice referral within $30$ days of the terminal diagnosis. The subgroups are Non-Hispanic White ($W$), Non-Hispanic Black ($B$), Hispanic/Latino ($L$), and Asian American ($A$). The counts of clinically eligible patients and the number referred are:\n\n- $W$: eligible $= 400$, referred $= 220$.\n- $B$: eligible $= 300$, referred $= 135$.\n- $L$: eligible $= 250$, referred $= 100$.\n- $A$: eligible $= 150$, referred $= 90$.\n\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability and the concept of a rate ratio, do the following:\n\n1. Using the definition of conditional probability, determine for each subgroup $g \\in \\{W, B, L, A\\}$ the conditional referral rate $r_{g} = P(\\text{Referral} \\mid \\text{Eligible}, g)$ from the provided counts.\n\n2. Using the definition of a risk ratio, define for each subgroup $g$ the disparity ratio $D_{g}$ as the ratio of its conditional referral rate to the conditional referral rate of $W$, i.e., $D_{g} = r_{g} / r_{W}$. Interpret $D_{g}$ in terms of multiplicative deviation from the reference subgroup. Note that by definition $D_{W} = 1$.\n\n3. To summarize group-wise deviations multiplicatively and to weight by the eligible population distribution, compute a composite inequity measure defined as the weighted average of the squared natural logarithms of the disparity ratios, where the weights are the subgroup shares among clinically eligible patients. That is, use subgroup weights $w_{g} = N^{\\text{eligible}}_{g} / \\sum_{h} N^{\\text{eligible}}_{h}$, and compute the quantity that averages $\\left[\\ln(D_{g})\\right]^{2}$ according to the weights $w_{g}$.

Your quantitative computation must be self-contained and based only on the definitions and data provided, and your qualitative discussion must be consistent with the quantitative results. The final answer must be the single numerical value of the composite inequity measure described above.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in statistical methodology, well-posed with sufficient data and clear definitions, and objectively stated. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. We may proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis of hospice referral data for four patient subgroups: Non-Hispanic White ($W$), Non-Hispanic Black ($B$), Hispanic/Latino ($L$), and Asian American ($A$). We are given the number of clinically eligible patients and the number of referred patients for each subgroup.\n\nLet $N^{\\text{eligible}}_{g}$ be the count of clinically eligible patients in subgroup $g$, and $N^{\\text{referred}}_{g}$ be the count of those patients who received a hospice referral. The provided data is:\n- Subgroup $W$: $N^{\\text{eligible}}_{W} = 400$, $N^{\\text{referred}}_{W} = 220$.\n- Subgroup $B$: $N^{\\text{eligible}}_{B} = 300$, $N^{\\text{referred}}_{B} = 135$.\n- Subgroup $L$: $N^{\\text{eligible}}_{L} = 250$, $N^{\\text{referred}}_{L} = 100$.\n- Subgroup $A$: $N^{\\text{eligible}}_{A} = 150$, $N^{\\text{referred}}_{A} = 90$.\n\n**1. Conditional Referral Rates**\n\nThe conditional referral rate for each subgroup $g$, denoted $r_g$, is the conditional probability $P(\\text{Referral} \\mid \\text{Eligible}, g)$. This probability is estimated from the provided data as the ratio of the number of referred patients to the number of eligible patients within that subgroup.\n$$r_g = \\frac{N^{\\text{referred}}_{g}}{N^{\\text{eligible}}_{g}}$$\nFor each subgroup, the rates are:\n- $W$: $r_{W} = \\frac{220}{400} = 0.55$\n- $B$: $r_{B} = \\frac{135}{300} = 0.45$\n- $L$: $r_{L} = \\frac{100}{250} = 0.40$\n- $A$: $r_{A} = \\frac{90}{150} = 0.60$\n\n**2. Disparity Ratios**\n\nThe disparity ratio for subgroup $g$, $D_g$, is defined as the ratio of its referral rate $r_g$ to the referral rate of the reference subgroup $W$, $r_W$.\n$$D_{g} = \\frac{r_{g}}{r_{W}}$$\nThe disparity ratios are:\n- $W$: $D_{W} = \\frac{r_{W}}{r_{W}} = \\frac{0.55}{0.55} = 1$. This is the reference against which others are measured.\n- $B$: $D_{B} = \\frac{r_{B}}{r_{W}} = \\frac{0.45}{0.55} = \\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.818$\n- $L$: $D_{L} = \\frac{r_{L}}{r_{W}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.55} = \\frac{8}{11} \\approx 0.727$\n- $A$: $D_{A} = \\frac{r_{A}}{r_{W}} = \\frac{0.60}{0.55} = \\frac{12}{11} \\approx 1.091$\n\nInterpretation: A disparity ratio $D_g < 1$ indicates that subgroup $g$ has a lower referral rate than the reference subgroup $W$, while $D_g > 1$ indicates a higher referral rate. Specifically, Black patients are referred at approximately $82\\%$ the rate of White patients, and Hispanic/Latino patients at approximately $73\\%$ the rate. In contrast, Asian American patients are referred at approximately $109\\%$ the rate of White patients, meaning their referral rate is about $9\\%$ higher.\n\n**3. Composite Inequity Measure**\n\nThe composite inequity measure is the weighted average of the squared natural logarithms of the disparity ratios, $I = \\sum_{g} w_{g} [\\ln(D_g)]^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weights $w_g$, which are the subgroup shares of the total eligible population. The total number of eligible patients is:\n$$N^{\\text{total}}_{\\text{eligible}} = N^{\\text{eligible}}_{W} + N^{\\text{eligible}}_{B} + N^{\\text{eligible}}_{L} + N^{\\text{eligible}}_{A} = 400 + 300 + 250 + 150 = 1100$$\nThe weights $w_g = N^{\\text{eligible}}_{g} / N^{\\text{total}}_{\\text{eligible}}$ are:\n- $w_{W} = \\frac{400}{1100} = \\frac{4}{11}$\n- $w_{B} = \\frac{300}{1100} = \\frac{3}{11}$\n- $w_{L} = \\frac{250}{1100} = \\frac{5}{22}$\n- $w_{A} = \\frac{150}{1100} = \\frac{3}{22}$\n\nNext, we compute the term $[\\ln(D_g)]^2$ for each group.\n- $W$: $[\\ln(D_{W})]^2 = [\\ln(1)]^2 = 0^2 = 0$\n- $B$: $[\\ln(D_{B})]^2 = \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)\\right]^2$\n- $L$: $[\\ln(D_{L})]^2 = \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{11}\\right)\\right]^2$\n- $A$: $[\\ln(D_{A})]^2 = \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{11}\\right)\\right]^2$\n\nNow, we compute the weighted average $I$:\n$$I = w_{W}[\\ln(D_{W})]^2 + w_{B}[\\ln(D_{B})]^2 + w_{L}[\\ln(D_{L})]^2 + w_{A}[\\ln(D_{A})]^2$$\n$$I = \\left(\\frac{4}{11}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)\\right]^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{22}\\right)\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{11}\\right)\\right]^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{22}\\right)\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{11}\\right)\\right]^2$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the logarithms:\n$\\ln(9/11) \\approx -0.20067$\n$\\ln(8/11) \\approx -0.31845$\n$\\ln(12/11) \\approx 0.08701$\n\n$$I \\approx \\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)(-0.20067)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{22}\\right)(-0.31845)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{22}\\right)(0.08701)^2$$\n$$I \\approx (0.272727)(0.0402687) + (0.227273)(0.1014129) + (0.136364)(0.0075709)$$\n$$I \\approx 0.0109824 + 0.0230484 + 0.0010324$$\n$$I \\approx 0.0350632$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the composite inequity measure is $0.03506$.\n\nThe use of $[\\ln(D_g)]^2$ produces a symmetric penalty for over- and under-referral because of the properties of the natural logarithm. Let a group have a disparity ratio of $x$, and another have a ratio of $1/x$. The first group is over-represented by a factor of $x$, and the second is under-represented by the same multiplicative factor. The logarithmic transformation makes these deviations symmetric around zero: $\\ln(x)$ and $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$. Squaring these values yields $[\\ln(x)]^2$ and $[-\\ln(x)]^2$, which are identical. Therefore, a disparity of $D_g = 2$ (double the reference rate) and $D_g = 1/2$ (half the reference rate) contribute equally to the measure of inequity, reflecting a symmetric treatment of multiplicative deviations from parity.\n\n**4. Qualitative Discussion of Plausible Contributors**\n\nThe quantitative results show that, relative to clinically eligible Non-Hispanic White patients, Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino patients are substantially under-referred to hospice, while Asian American patients are slightly over-referred. These disparities are likely multifactorial, stemming from both structural and interpersonal factors within the healthcare system and society.\n\nStructural contributors could include:\n- **Access and Insurance:** Differences in insurance status (e.g., Medicare vs. Medicaid vs. private) across racial and ethnic groups can create barriers. Some hospice agencies may have limited capacity to serve Medicaid patients, a group in which minorities are overrepresented. Geographic maldistribution of hospice facilities in relation to where different groups live can also limit access, compounded by transportation challenges for some families.\n- **Language and Cultural Congruence:** For patients with limited English proficiency, particularly within Hispanic/Latino and some Asian American communities, the lack of professional medical interpreters and culturally translated materials can severely impede understanding of what hospice entails, leading to lower uptake.\n\nInterpersonal contributors could involve:\n- **Implicit Bias and Communication:** Clinicians may, unconsciously, hold biases that influence how they present end-of-life care options. They might assume certain groups are less willing to forego aggressive treatment, leading to less thorough discussions about hospice. The quality of shared decision-making is critical. If patients perceive a lack of respect or shared identity with their provider, trust is eroded, making them less likely to accept care recommendations.\n- **Mistrust and Cultural Preferences:** Historical and ongoing experiences with discrimination in healthcare have fostered deep-seated mistrust among some minority communities, particularly Black Americans. This may lead to suspicion that hospice is a way to ration care or \"give up\" on them. Furthermore, culturally informed values can play a significant role. Some cultures place a strong emphasis on filial piety and curative-focused treatments until the very end of life. The higher rate for Asian Americans is complex and cautions against treating this group as a monolith; it could reflect specific subgroup preferences or a greater emphasis on palliative goals once a terminal diagnosis is accepted in some cultural contexts.\n\nThese factors often interact, creating a complex web of influences that result in the observed disparities in hospice referral.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03506}\n$$", "id": "4713008"}, {"introduction": "Culturally competent practice involves critically evaluating our clinical tools, as their performance may not be uniform across diverse populations.

It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} | D) P(D) + P(T^{+} | H) P(H)$$\n\nWe are given $P(T^{+} | D) = Sens$. The term $P(H)$ is the probability of being healthy, which is $1 - P(D)$. The term $P(T^{+} | H)$ is the probability of a positive test in a healthy individual, which is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity:\n$$P(T^{+} | H) = 1 - P(T^{-} | H) = 1 - Spec$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^{+})$ yields:\n$$P(T^{+}) = (Sens \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Spec) \\cdot (1 - P(D)))$$\n\nTherefore, the full formula for $PPV$ in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Sens \\cdot P(D)}{(Sens \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Spec) \\cdot (1 - P(D)))}$$\n\nWe will now apply this formula to each language group.\n\nFor **Language Group A**:\n-   $Sens_A = 0.88$\n-   $Spec_A = 0.92$\n-   $P(D_A) = 0.10$\n\nThe $PPV$ for Group A, denoted $PPV_A$, is:\n$$PPV_A = \\frac{0.88 \\cdot 0.10}{(0.88 \\cdot 0.10) + ((1 - 0.92) \\cdot (1 - 0.10))}$$\n$$PPV_A = \\frac{0.088}{0.088 + (0.08 \\cdot 0.90)}$$\n$$PPV_A = \\frac{0.088}{0.088 + 0.072}$$\n$$PPV_A = \\frac{0.088}{0.160}$$\n$$PPV_A = 0.55$$\n\nFor **Language Group B**:\n-   $Sens_B = 0.83$\n-   $Spec_B = 0.85$\n-   $P(D_B) = 0.06$\n\nThe $PPV$ for Group B, denoted $PPV_B$, is:\n$$PPV_B = \\frac{0.83 \\cdot 0.06}{(0.83 \\cdot 0.06) + ((1 - 0.85) \\cdot (1 - 0.06))}$$\n$$PPV_B = \\frac{0.0498}{0.0498 + (0.15 \\cdot 0.94)}$$\n$$PPV_B = \\frac{0.0498}{0.0498 + 0.141}$$\n$$PPV_B = \\frac{0.0498}{0.1908}$$\n$$PPV_B \\approx 0.2610062914...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute difference in $PPV$ between the two groups, $|PPV_A - PPV_B|$.\n$$|PPV_A - PPV_B| = |0.55 - 0.2610062914...|$$\n$$|PPV_A - PPV_B| = 0.2889937086...$$\n\nThe final step is to round this result to four significant figures.

The clinic’s aggregate data show that in the patient’s demographic group $G$, the base rate of medication nonadherence is $r_{G} = 0.3$. Rather than acting on the group label alone, the clinician collects an individual adherence risk score $s$ from a validated, cross-culturally calibrated instrument. Empirically, the instrument’s score distributions conditional on true adherence status are approximately normal with equal variance: if the patient would be nonadherent ($N$), then $s \\mid N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{N}, \\sigma^{2})$ with $\\mu_{N} = 70$ and $\\sigma = 10$; if the patient would be adherent ($A$), then $s \\mid A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{A}, \\sigma^{2})$ with $\\mu_{A} = 50$ and $\\sigma = 10$.\n\nThe clinician can choose between two actions: deploy the targeted intervention ($T$) or provide standard counseling ($S$).

The base rate of adherence ($A$) is therefore $P(A) = 1 - r_G = 0.7$.\n- **Likelihoods**: The individual adherence risk score $s$ follows a normal distribution conditional on the true adherence status.\n  - For a nonadherent patient ($N$): $s \\mid N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{N}, \\sigma^{2})$, with mean $\\mu_{N} = 70$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 10$.\n  - For an adherent patient ($A$): $s \\mid A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{A}, \\sigma^{2})$, with mean $\\mu_{A} = 50$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 10$.\n- **Actions**:\n  - $T$: Deploy the targeted intervention.\n  - $S$: Provide standard counseling.\n- **Loss Function (Costs and Harms)**:\n  - Cost of action $T$: $c = 90$.\n  - Harm averted by action $T$ for a nonadherent patient: $h_{R} = 600$.\n  - Action $S$ has negligible cost and does not alter the harm for a nonadherent patient.\n  - No harm or benefit for adherent patients from either action, beyond the immediate cost $c$ of action $T$.\n- **Objective**: Derive the Bayes-optimal decision threshold $s^{\\star}$ for the score $s$, such that action $T$ is chosen if and only if $s \\geq s^{\\star}$.

It is a valid problem in statistical decision theory. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Decision Threshold\nThe optimal decision rule is to choose the action that minimizes the expected loss, conditioned on the observed score $s$. We begin by constructing the loss function, $L(\\text{action}, \\text{state})$, which quantifies the net cost associated with each combination of action and true patient state.\n\nThe possible states are Nonadherent ($N$) and Adherent ($A$). The possible actions are Targeted intervention ($T$) and Standard counseling ($S$).\n- If the patient is nonadherent ($N$) and receives standard counseling ($S$), the harm $h_R$ is realized. So, the loss is $L(S, N) = h_R$.\n- If the patient is nonadherent ($N$) and receives the targeted intervention ($T$), the harm $h_R$ is averted, but the intervention incurs a cost $c$. So, the loss is $L(T, N) = c$.\n- If the patient is adherent ($A$) and receives standard counseling ($S$), there is no cost and no harm. So, the loss is $L(S, A) = 0$.\n- If the patient is adherent ($A$) and receives the targeted intervention ($T$), there is no harm to avert, but the intervention still costs $c$. So, the loss is $L(T, A) = c$.\n\nThe expected loss for each action, conditional on observing the score $s$, is calculated using the posterior probabilities of the states, $P(N \\mid s)$ and $P(A \\mid s)$.\n\nThe expected loss of providing standard counseling ($S$) is:\n$$ E[L(S) \\mid s] = L(S, N)P(N \\mid s) + L(S, A)P(A \\mid s) = h_R \\cdot P(N \\mid s) + 0 \\cdot P(A \\mid s) = h_R P(N \\mid s) $$\n\nThe expected loss of deploying the targeted intervention ($T$) is:\n$$ E[L(T) \\mid s] = L(T, N)P(N \\mid s) + L(T, A)P(A \\mid s) = c \\cdot P(N \\mid s) + c \\cdot P(A \\mid s) = c(P(N \\mid s) + P(A \\mid s)) = c $$\nsince $P(N \\mid s) + P(A \\mid s) = 1$.\n\nThe Bayes-optimal rule is to choose action $T$ if its expected loss is less than or equal to that of action $S$. We choose $T$ if:\n$$ E[L(T) \\mid s] \\leq E[L(S) \\mid s] $$\n$$ c \\leq h_R P(N \\mid s) $$\nThis gives a threshold on the posterior probability of nonadherence:\n$$ P(N \\mid s) \\geq \\frac{c}{h_R} $$\n\nTo find the threshold on the score $s$, we express the posterior probability $P(N \\mid s)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(N \\mid s) = \\frac{p(s \\mid N)P(N)}{p(s)} = \\frac{p(s \\mid N)P(N)}{p(s \\mid N)P(N) + p(s \\mid A)P(A)} $$\nSubstituting this into the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{p(s \\mid N)P(N)}{p(s \\mid N)P(N) + p(s \\mid A)P(A)} \\geq \\frac{c}{h_R} $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for the likelihood ratio $\\frac{p(s \\mid N)}{p(s \\mid A)}$:\n$$ h_R p(s \\mid N)P(N) \\geq c(p(s \\mid N)P(N) + p(s \\mid A)P(A)) $$\n$$ p(s \\mid N)P(N)(h_R - c) \\geq c \\cdot p(s \\mid A)P(A) $$\n$$ \\frac{p(s \\mid N)}{p(s \\mid A)} \\geq \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} $$\n\nThe likelihoods $p(s \\mid N)$ and $p(s \\mid A)$ are given by the probability density functions of the normal distributions:\n$$ p(s \\mid N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(s-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right) $$\n$$ p(s \\mid A) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(s-\\mu_A)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right) $$\nThe likelihood ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{p(s \\mid N)}{p(s \\mid A)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left( -\\frac{(s-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)}{\\exp\\left( -\\frac{(s-\\mu_A)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{(s-\\mu_A)^2 - (s-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right) $$\nThe decision threshold $s^{\\star}$ is the value of $s$ where equality holds. Let's solve for $s^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\exp\\left( \\frac{(s^{\\star}-\\mu_A)^2 - (s^{\\star}-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right) = \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{(s^{\\star}-\\mu_A)^2 - (s^{\\star}-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} \\right) $$\nExpanding the numerator on the left side:\n$$ (s^{\\star})^2 - 2s^{\\star}\\mu_A + \\mu_A^2 - ((s^{\\star})^2 - 2s^{\\star}\\mu_N + \\mu_N^2) = 2s^{\\star}(\\mu_N - \\mu_A) - (\\mu_N^2 - \\mu_A^2) = (\\mu_N - \\mu_A)(2s^{\\star} - (\\mu_A + \\mu_N)) $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{(\\mu_N - \\mu_A)(2s^{\\star} - (\\mu_A + \\mu_N))}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} \\right) $$\nSolving for $s^{\\star}$:\n$$ 2s^{\\star} - (\\mu_A + \\mu_N) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\mu_N - \\mu_A} \\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} \\right) $$\n$$ s^{\\star} = \\frac{\\mu_A + \\mu_N}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_N - \\mu_A} \\ln\\left( \\frac{c}{h_R - c} \\frac{P(A)}{P(N)} \\right) $$\nThe priors are $P(N) = r_G = 0.3$ and $P(A) = 1 - r_G = 0.7$.
