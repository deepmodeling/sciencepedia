In practice, instrument manuals commonly specify an item-level missingness rule (the half-scale rule) stating that a domain score may be computed only if at least half of the domain items are present. When the rule is satisfied, the domain score is defined as the arithmetic mean of the observed item scores without imputation.\n\nConsider a participant who completed this domain with $n_{d} = 6$ items, but due to missingness only the following item scores are observed: $(4, 3, 5)$. Using the half-scale rule requiring at least half of the items present to compute the domain score, determine whether the domain score can be computed and, if so, compute the domain score as the mean of the available items. Report the final domain score rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of whether a Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) domain score can be computed based on a specific missingness rule, and if so, to compute the score.\n\nFirst, the givens of the problem are formally stated:\n1.  The total number of items in the domain is $n_{d} = 6$.\n2.  The items are scored on a Likert-type scale from $1$ to $5$.\n3.  A participant has a set of observed item scores, which can be represented as a vector $\\mathbf{s} = (4, 3, 5)$.\n4.  The number of observed items, denoted as $n_{obs}$, is the dimension of the vector $\\mathbf{s}$, which is $n_{obs} = 3$.\n5.  The rule for computability (the \"half-scale rule\") is that the number of observed items must be at least half of the total number of items in the domain. Mathematically, this condition is $n_{obs} \\geq \\frac{n_{d}}{2}$.\n6.  If the condition is met, the domain score, $\\bar{x}$, is the arithmetic mean of the observed item scores.\n7.  The final result must be reported rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe first step is to validate the half-scale rule. We substitute the given values into the inequality:\n$$\nn_{obs} \\geq \\frac{n_{d}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n3 \\geq \\frac{6}{2}\n$$\n$$\n3 \\geq 3\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the condition for computing the domain score is satisfied.\n\nThe second step is to compute the domain score. The domain score $\\bar{x}$ is defined as the arithmetic mean of the observed item scores. The observed scores are the components of the vector $\\mathbf{s}$, which are $s_1 = 4$, $s_2 = 3$, and $s_3 = 5$. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n_{obs}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{obs}} s_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{3} (4 + 3 + 5)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{3} (12)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{x} = 4\n$$\nThe computed domain score is exactly $4$.\n\nThe final step is to format the answer according to the problem's requirement of four significant figures. The number $4$ has one significant figure. To express it with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$\n\\text{Final Score} = 4.000\n$$\nThis value maintains the calculated magnitude while satisfying the specified precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.000}$$", "id": "4742600"}, {"introduction": "Quality of Life instruments often use unique scoring systems, making it difficult to compare results across different studies or domains.

You will also go a step further by interpreting the clinical significance of this score using established benchmarks and the concept of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), a cornerstone of patient-centered outcomes research.", "problem": "A medical psychology research team is analyzing health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a cohort using a validated multi-domain instrument. One domain is scored by averaging $6$ items, each rated on a Likert scale from $1$ (worst) to $5$ (best), producing a raw domain score $x \\in [1,5]$ that is treated as interval-level. To compare across studies and domains, the institution expresses scores on a $0$–$100$ metric via a linear rescaling that preserves equal intervals and maps the worst and best anchors such that the domain score $x=1$ corresponds to $0$ on the $0$–$100$ metric and $x=5$ corresponds to $100$ on the $0$–$100$ metric.\n\nA patient’s raw domain score average is $x=3.8$. Using only the principles of interval scaling and linear (affine) transformation with the stated anchor constraints, derive the transformation function $T(x)$ from $[1,5]$ to $[0,100]$, then compute the transformed score for $x=3.8$ exactly. Finally, interpret the clinical meaningfulness of the transformed value under the following framework: in this population, scores $\\ge 70$ on the $0$–$100$ metric are considered “high functioning,” scores $50$ are “low functioning,” and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is $5$ points on the $0$–$100$ scale. Assume the patient’s previous transformed score was $65$ and discuss whether the change is clinically meaningful.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer as the transformed score on the $0$–$100$ scale.

No rounding is required; provide the exact value.", "solution": "The task is to derive a linear transformation function, apply it to a given data point, and interpret the result within a specified clinical framework.\n\nLet the raw domain score be denoted by the variable $x$, which exists in the interval $[1, 5]$. Let the transformed score on the $0$–$100$ metric be denoted by $T(x)$, which exists in the interval $[0, 100]$. The transformation is stated to be linear, which means it can be represented by an affine function of the form:\n$$T(x) = mx + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe problem provides two anchor points that define this linear relationship:\n1. A raw score of $x=1$ corresponds to a transformed score of $T(1)=0$.\n2. A raw score of $x=5$ corresponds to a transformed score of $T(5)=100$.\n\nThese two points, $(1, 0)$ and $(5, 100)$, allow us to determine the parameters $m$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope $m$ of the line connecting these two points:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{T(5) - T(1)}{5 - 1} = \\frac{100 - 0}{5 - 1} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25$$\n\nNow that we have the slope, the function is $T(x) = 25x + b$. We can use one of the anchor points to solve for the intercept $b$. Using the point $(1, 0)$:\n$$T(1) = 25(1) + b$$\n$$0 = 25 + b$$\n$$b = -25$$\n\nThus, the complete linear transformation function is:\n$$T(x) = 25x - 25$$\nThis can be written in a factored form, which is common for such transformations:\n$$T(x) = 25(x - 1)$$\nThis form clearly shows that the score is determined by the distance of the raw score $x$ from the minimum possible raw score ($1$), scaled by a factor of $25$. We can verify this function using the second anchor point, $(5, 100)$:\n$$T(5) = 25(5 - 1) = 25(4) = 100$$\nThe function is correct.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the transformed score for a patient with a raw average domain score of $x = 3.8$. We substitute this value into our derived function:\n$$T(3.8) = 25(3.8 - 1)$$\n$$T(3.8) = 25(2.8)$$\nTo compute this product exactly:\n$$T(3.8) = 25 \\times \\frac{28}{10} = \\frac{25 \\times 28}{10} = \\frac{5 \\times 28}{2} = 5 \\times 14 = 70$$\nThe patient's transformed score is exactly $70$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret the clinical meaningfulness of this result.\nThe interpretation framework provides three pieces of information:\n- Scores $\\ge 70$ are considered “high functioning.”\n- Scores $ 50$ are “low functioning.”\n- The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is $5$ points on the $0$–$100$ scale.\n\nThe patient’s current score is $T(3.8) = 70$. According to the given framework, a score of $70$ falls into the “high functioning” category, as it satisfies the condition $T(x) \\ge 70$.\n\nThe patient’s previous transformed score was $65$. The change in score is the difference between the current score and the previous score:\n$$\\Delta T = \\text{Current Score} - \\text{Previous Score} = 70 - 65 = 5$$\nThe patient's score has improved by $5$ points. The problem states that the MCID is $5$ points. The MCID is the smallest change in a treatment outcome that a patient would identify as important. Since the patient's improvement of $5$ points is equal to the MCID, the change is considered clinically meaningful. This means the improvement is not just a numerical fluctuation but represents a tangible enhancement in the patient's quality of life for this domain.

The solution proceeds by formalizing the provided information.\n\n(a) Derivation of the TTO utility expression.\n\nThe core of the Time Trade-Off (TTO) method is the principle of indifference. The respondent is indifferent between two scenarios, which implies that the total health value, or QALY, of each scenario is equal. Let us denote the two options as Option A and Option B.\n\nOption A: Living for a duration $T$ in a constant health state $H$.\nOption B: Living for a shorter duration $t^{\\ast}$ in full health, followed by immediate death.\n\nThe QALY is defined as the integral of the instantaneous utility function, $u(t)$, over the lifespan, $\\tau$:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} u(t)\\,dt$$\n\nWe calculate the QALY for each option based on the givens.\n\nFor Option A, the lifespan is $\\tau = T$, and the utility is constant, $u(t) = u(H)$, for the entire duration. Therefore, the QALY for Option A, denoted $Q_A$, is:\n$$Q_A = \\int_{0}^{T} u(H)\\,dt$$\nSince $u(H)$ is a constant with respect to time $t$, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$Q_A = u(H) \\int_{0}^{T} 1\\,dt = u(H) [t]_{0}^{T} = u(H) (T - 0) = u(H)T$$\n\nFor Option B, the lifespan is $\\tau = t^{\\ast}$, and the utility is that of full health, which is anchored at $u(t) = 1$, for the entire duration. The QALY for Option B, denoted $Q_B$, is:\n$$Q_B = \\int_{0}^{t^{\\ast}} 1\\,dt$$\n$$Q_B = [t]_{0}^{t^{\\ast}} = t^{\\ast} - 0 = t^{\\ast}$$\n\nThe indifference condition states that $Q_A = Q_B$. We can therefore set the expressions for the QALYs of each option to be equal:\n$$u(H)T = t^{\\ast}$$\n\nTo find the explicit expression for the utility of the health state, $u(H)$, we solve this equation for $u(H)$:\n$$u(H) = \\frac{t^{\\ast}}{T}$$\nThis is the TTO utility of health state $H$, derived solely from the fundamental principles provided.\n\n(b) Computation of the utility $u(H)$.\n\nThe problem provides the following specific values from a respondent's elicitation:\n- The time in the chronic health state, $T = 10$ years.\n- The equivalent time in full health, $t^{\\ast} = 8$ years.\n\nUsing the formula derived in part (a), we substitute these values to compute the utility of health state $H$:\n$$u(H) = \\frac{t^{\\ast}}{T} = \\frac{8}{10}$$\nThe utility is a unitless ratio, as the units of time (years) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.
