Also assume that sleep onset latency at bedtime is negligible (that is, $SOL = 0$) and there is no other wakefulness besides the specified care awakenings. All awake time due to care interruptions is included in $TIB$ and contributes to wake after sleep onset.\n\nStarting from these definitions, derive an expression for $SE$ in terms of $TIB$ and the total wake time due to the care interruptions, then compute the numerical value of $SE$ for this caregiver’s night.

Time in Bed ($TIB$): The total clock time from lying down to getting out of bed.\n2.  Total Sleep Time ($TST$): The portion of $TIB$ spent asleep.\n3.  Sleep Efficiency ($SE$): The ratio of $TST$ to $TIB$, given by the formula:\n    $$SE = \\frac{TST}{TIB}$$\n\nThe total time in bed ($TIB$) can be partitioned into time spent asleep ($TST$) and time spent awake. The time spent awake in bed is composed of Sleep Onset Latency ($SOL$), which is the time taken to fall asleep at the beginning of the night, and Wake After Sleep Onset ($WASO$), which is the total duration of awakenings that occur after sleep has been initiated and before the final awakening in the morning.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between these quantities is:\n$$TIB = TST + SOL + WASO$$\n\nThe problem states that the sleep onset latency is negligible, which formally means $SOL = 0$. This simplifies the relationship to:\n$$TIB = TST + WASO$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can express $TST$ in terms of $TIB$ and $WASO$:\n$$TST = TIB - WASO$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $TST$ into the definition of $SE$:\n$$SE = \\frac{TIB - WASO}{TIB}$$\n\nThis can be written as:\n$$SE = 1 - \\frac{WASO}{TIB}$$\n\nThe problem defines the total wake time due to care interruptions as the only source of wakefulness after sleep onset. Therefore, $WASO$ is precisely this total wake time. This equation is the general expression for $SE$ in terms of $TIB$ and the total wake time due to care interruptions ($WASO$).\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $SE$ for the given case. The problem provides the following data:\n- Time in Bed, $TIB = 8$ hours.\n- Number of care-related awakenings = $3$.\n- Duration of each awakening = $15$ minutes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total Wake After Sleep Onset ($WASO$). Since there are $3$ awakenings, each lasting $15$ minutes, the total duration of wakefulness is:\n$$WASO = 3 \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 45 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nTo calculate the ratio $\\frac{WASO}{TIB}$, both quantities must be expressed in the same units. We will convert $TIB$ from hours to minutes.\n$$TIB = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 480 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nNow we have:\n- $TIB = 480$ minutes\n- $WASO = 45$ minutes\n\nThe Total Sleep Time ($TST$) is:\n$$TST = TIB - WASO = 480 \\text{ minutes} - 45 \\text{ minutes} = 435 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nWe can now compute the Sleep Efficiency ($SE$):\n$$SE = \\frac{TST}{TIB} = \\frac{435}{480}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the decimal value:\n$$SE = 0.90625$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nThe task is to derive and compute the standardized mean difference effect size, Cohen's $d$, for two independent groups.\n\nCohen's $d$ is defined as the difference between the two group means, divided by a pooled standard deviation. This standardization expresses the magnitude of the difference in terms of standard deviation units, rendering it independent of the original scale of measurement.\n\nThe numerator is the difference in the sample means of the outcome variable. Here, the outcome is the reduction in ZBI score, $R$. The mean reductions for the intervention and control groups are $\\bar{R}_1$ and $\\bar{R}_2$, respectively. Thus, the mean difference is:\n$$ \\text{Mean Difference} = \\bar{R}_1 - \\bar{R}_2 $$\n\nThe denominator is the pooled standard deviation, $s_p$. It is an estimate of the common population standard deviation, calculated under the assumption of homogeneity of variances (i.e., the population variances of the two groups are equal, $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2$). The pooled variance, $s_p^2$, is a weighted average of the two sample variances, $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$, where the weights are their respective degrees of freedom, $(n_1 - 1)$ and $(n_2 - 1)$. This provides a more precise estimate of the population variance than either sample variance alone.\n\nThe formula for the pooled variance is:\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{(n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)} = \\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} $$\n\nThe pooled standard deviation is the square root of the pooled variance:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator, the formula for Cohen's $d$ is:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\bar{R}_1 - \\bar{R}_2}{s_p} = \\frac{\\bar{R}_1 - \\bar{R}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula.\nGiven:\n$n_1 = 60$\n$n_2 = 60$\n$\\bar{R}_1 = 6$\n$s_1 = 8 \\implies s_1^2 = 64$\n$\\bar{R}_2 = 2$\n$s_2 = 7 \\implies s_2^2 = 49$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator (the mean difference):\n$$ \\bar{R}_1 - \\bar{R}_2 = 6 - 2 = 4 $$\n\nNext, calculate the pooled variance, $s_p^2$. The degrees of freedom are $n_1 - 1 = 59$ and $n_2 - 1 = 59$. The total degrees of freedom in the denominator is $n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 60 + 60 - 2 = 118$.\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{(60 - 1)(8^2) + (60 - 1)(7^2)}{60 + 60 - 2} = \\frac{59(64) + 59(49)}{118} $$\nWe can factor out $59$:\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{59(64 + 49)}{118} = \\frac{59(113)}{118} $$\nSince $118 = 2 \\times 59$, we can simplify:\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{113}{2} = 56.5 $$\n\nNow, calculate the pooled standard deviation, $s_p$:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{56.5} $$\n\nFinally, compute Cohen's $d$:\n$$ d = \\frac{4}{s_p} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{56.5}} \\approx 0.532150... $$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$ d \\approx 0.532 $$\n\n### Interpretation\nThe computed Cohen's $d$ value is $0.532$. According to the conventional benchmarks provided (small $d \\approx 0.2$, medium $d \\approx 0.5$, large $d \\approx 0.8$), this effect size is classified as a medium effect. This indicates that the average reduction in caregiver burden in the telehealth intervention group was approximately $0.532$ standard deviations greater than the average reduction in the usual-care control group.

[@problem_id:4710979]", "problem": "A medical psychology team studies how caregiver burden relates to depression severity among family caregivers. Depression severity is measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), caregiver burden is measured by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), and perceived social support is measured by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The researchers fit a linear regression with an interaction to model the conditional expectation of depression severity as a function of caregiver burden and perceived social support. In the fitted model, perceived social support is standardized so that one unit represents one standard deviation. The regression produces the following coefficients: the burden coefficient $b=0.50$ for the main effect of caregiver burden and the burden-by-support interaction coefficient $b_{\\text{int}}=-0.20$ for the product of caregiver burden and perceived social support.

It is scientifically grounded in standard statistical modeling within medical psychology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nLet $D$ represent the depression severity score (PHQ-9), $B$ represent the caregiver burden score (ZBI), and $S$ represent the standardized perceived social support score (MSPSS). The problem states that a linear regression model with an interaction term is used to model the conditional expectation of $D$. The general form of this model is:\n$$\nE[D | B, S] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 B + \\beta_2 S + \\beta_3 (B \\cdot S)\n$$\nwhere $E[D | B, S]$ is the expected value of depression severity given specific levels of burden and support.

This corresponds to $\\beta_1$, so $\\beta_1 = 0.50$.\n- The burden-by-support interaction coefficient is $b_{\\text{int}} = -0.20$. This corresponds to $\\beta_3$, so $\\beta_3 = -0.20$.\n\nThe values of the intercept $\\beta_0$ and the main effect of support $\\beta_2$ are not provided, as they are not necessary for the required calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the marginal effect of caregiver burden on expected depression severity. The marginal effect is defined as the instantaneous rate of change of the expected outcome with respect to the variable of interest, holding other variables constant. Mathematically, this is the partial derivative of the conditional expectation function with respect to $B$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} E[D | B, S] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 B + \\beta_2 S + \\beta_3 B S)\n$$\nApplying the rules of partial differentiation:\n- The derivative of $\\beta_0$ with respect to $B$ is $0$.\n- The derivative of $\\beta_1 B$ with respect to $B$ is $\\beta_1$.\n- The derivative of $\\beta_2 S$ with respect to $B$ is $0$, as $S$ is held constant.\n- The derivative of $\\beta_3 B S$ with respect to $B$ is $\\beta_3 S$, as $S$ is treated as a constant factor.\n\nSumming these terms, the marginal effect of burden on expected depression, denoted $\\text{ME}_B$, is:\n$$\n\\text{ME}_B = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 S\n$$\nThis equation shows that the effect of a one-unit change in burden on expected depression is not constant; it is linearly dependent on the level of social support $S$. This is the definition of a linear interaction effect.\n\nWe are asked to calculate this marginal effect at two specific levels of social support:\n1.  Low support, defined as one standard deviation below the mean. Since $S$ is standardized, this corresponds to $S = -1$.\n2.  High support, defined as one standard deviation above the mean, which corresponds to $S = +1$.\n\nFor low support ($S = -1$):\nThe marginal effect is calculated by substituting $S = -1$ into the derived equation:\n$$\n\\text{ME}_B(S=-1) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3(-1) = \\beta_1 - \\beta_3\n$$\nSubstituting the given coefficient values:\n$$\n\\text{ME}_B(S=-1) = 0.50 - (-0.20) = 0.50 + 0.20 = 0.70\n$$\nThus, at low levels of social support, a one-unit increase in the ZBI caregiver burden score is associated with an expected increase of $0.70$ points on the PHQ-9 depression severity scale.\n\nFor high support ($S = +1$):\nThe marginal effect is calculated by substituting $S = +1$ into the derived equation:\n$$\n\\text{ME}_B(S=+1) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3(+1) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3\n$$\nSubstituting the given coefficient values:\n$$\n\\text{ME}_B(S=+1) = 0.50 + (-0.20) = 0.50 - 0.20 = 0.30\n$$\nThus, at high levels of social support, a one-unit increase in the ZBI caregiver burden score is associated with an expected increase of only $0.30$ points on the PHQ-9 depression severity scale.\n\nFinally, we must determine if this pattern is consistent with a buffering effect of social support. A buffering effect occurs when a protective resource (here, social support) weakens the detrimental effect of a stressor (here, caregiver burden) on an outcome (here, depression).\n\nFrom first principles, our derived marginal effect of burden is $\\text{ME}_B = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 S = 0.50 - 0.20 S$. This is the slope of the relationship between burden and depression.\n- The effect of burden is positive for all reasonable levels of $S$, since $0.50$ is the dominant term.\n- The negative interaction coefficient, $\\beta_3 = -0.20$, indicates that as social support $S$ increases, the positive effect of burden on depression decreases.\n- Our calculations confirm this: the slope of the burden-depression relationship is steeper (stronger) under low support ($\\text{slope} = 0.70$) and flatter (weaker) under high support ($\\text{slope} = 0.30$).\n\nThis attenuation of the positive association between burden and depression by high social support is the precise definition of a buffering effect. Therefore, the pattern is consistent with social support acting as a buffer.
