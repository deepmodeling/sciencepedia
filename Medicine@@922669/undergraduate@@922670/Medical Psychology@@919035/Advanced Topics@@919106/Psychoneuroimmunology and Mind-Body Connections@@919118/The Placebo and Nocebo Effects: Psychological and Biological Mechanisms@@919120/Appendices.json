Outcomes will be measured at baseline and $8$ weeks using a validated numeric rating scale from $0$ to $10$ (higher values indicate more pain). Investigators will collect expectation ratings at baseline (participants’ anticipated relief) to characterize psychological mechanisms.

This exercise explores one of the core psychological mechanisms of placebo analgesia: classical conditioning. By pairing a neutral cue with a genuine reduction in pain, the cue itself can acquire the power to relieve pain, a process that provides a powerful model for how expectations are formed and how they engage the brain's own pain-modulating systems [@problem_id:4754451].", "problem": "An investigator aims to induce placebo analgesia through associative learning in healthy volunteers. The foundational base for this design is as follows: in classical conditioning, a neutral cue becomes a Conditioned Stimulus (CS) when reliably paired with an Unconditioned Stimulus (US) that elicits an Unconditioned Response (UR); after acquisition, the CS alone can elicit a Conditioned Response (CR). For pain, analgesia can be a CR when a CS is paired with analgesic outcomes (for example, reduced nociceptive input or pharmacological analgesia), and expectation can recruit descending modulatory systems within the Central Nervous System (CNS) to reduce perceived pain. Partial reinforcement (not every CS presentation is paired with the US) often produces a CR that is more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement. The investigator will select one conditioning paradigm that specifies an acquisition phase, reinforcement schedule, and test phase, while controlling for confounds such as stimulus intensity changes, context shifts, habituation, and demand characteristics. Pain is measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), anchored from $0$ (no pain) to $10$ (worst imaginable pain), and thermal stimuli are calibrated for each participant to yield a baseline pain rating near $6/10$.\n\nWhich option best operationalizes a scientifically sound conditioning paradigm to produce placebo analgesia while preserving internal validity?\n\nA.

In $16$ interleaved randomized $\\text{CS}_+$ trials, deliver reduced nociceptive input on $12$ trials (targeting roughly $4/10$ VAS) and normal input ($6/10$ VAS) on $4$ trials, yielding partial reinforcement with probability $p=0.75$. In $16$ $\\text{CS}_-$ trials, always deliver normal input ($6/10$ VAS). Maintain constant context (same room, experimenter, instructions), keep participants naive to contingencies, and keep experimenters who interact with participants blinded to trial type via automated stimulus control. Collect trial-wise expectancy ratings without revealing contingencies. Test: Present $8$ $\\text{CS}_+$ and $8$ $\\text{CS}_-$ trials with normal input ($6/10$ VAS) only; estimate placebo analgesia as the difference in VAS ratings between $\\text{CS}_+$ and $\\text{CS}_-$ at test, with identical context and timing as acquisition.\n\nB.
