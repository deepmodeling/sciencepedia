{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Cortisol's diverse effects on mood, memory, and metabolism are initiated by its binding to intracellular receptors. This exercise delves into the molecular level of psychoneuroendocrinology by applying the law of mass action to understand how cortisol interacts differently with high-affinity Mineralocorticoid Receptors (MR) and lower-affinity Glucocorticoid Receptors (GR). By calculating the fractional occupancy of these receptors, which is determined by the cortisol concentration and each receptor's unique dissociation constant ($K_d$), you will gain insight into the fundamental mechanism that allows the HPA axis to distinguish between basal conditions and a stress response [@problem_id:4741775].", "problem": "A hippocampal principal neuron is exposed to a free cytosolic cortisol concentration of $[L] = 10$ nM (after accounting for plasma binding proteins and cellular uptake). The Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) exhibits an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d^{MR} = 0.5$ nM for cortisol, whereas the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) exhibits $K_d^{GR} = 5$ nM. Starting from the law of mass action and the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, and assuming a single binding site per receptor, non-cooperative binding, identical sites, steady state, and that $[L]$ is not substantially depleted by receptor binding, derive the expression for the fractional occupancy of a receptor population by cortisol as a function of $[L]$ and $K_d$. Then use that expression to compute the fractional occupancies of MR and GR at $[L] = 10$ nM. Express both fractional occupancies as dimensionless decimals, rounded to four significant figures. Finally, based on these values, briefly explain what the occupancy pattern implies about the balance of MR versus GR signaling at this free cortisol level. The final numeric answer should list the two fractional occupancies in the order $(\\text{MR}, \\text{GR})$.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of receptor-ligand binding kinetics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The provided values for cortisol concentration and receptor dissociation constants are physiologically realistic.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general expression for fractional receptor occupancy, denoted by $\\theta$. The binding of a ligand, $L$ (cortisol), to a receptor, $R$, to form a receptor-ligand complex, $RL$, can be represented by the reversible reaction:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nAt steady state (equilibrium), the rates of the forward (association) and reverse (dissociation) reactions are equal. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free (unbound) receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of bound receptors (receptor-ligand complex).\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of the concentrations of free and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$\n[R_T] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]\n$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ from the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n[R_T] = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to find the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$, which is the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy. It is assumed that binding of cortisol to the receptors does not significantly deplete the free cortisol concentration, so $[L]$ can be treated as a constant equal to the specified free cytosolic concentration.\n\nThe second step is to use this derived expression to compute the fractional occupancies for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) at the given cortisol concentration.\n\nGiven data:\nFree cortisol concentration, $[L] = 10 \\text{ nM}$\nMR dissociation constant, $K_d^{MR} = 0.5 \\text{ nM}$\nGR dissociation constant, $K_d^{GR} = 5 \\text{ nM}$\n\nFor the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR):\n$$\n\\theta_{MR} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d^{MR} + [L]} = \\frac{10}{0.5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{10.5} = \\frac{20}{21}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\theta_{MR} \\approx 0.95238... \\approx 0.9524\n$$\n\nFor the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR):\n$$\n\\theta_{GR} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d^{GR} + [L]} = \\frac{10}{5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\theta_{GR} \\approx 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667\n$$\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the implication of this occupancy pattern. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is an inverse measure of binding affinity; a lower $K_d$ signifies a higher affinity. MR has a tenfold higher affinity for cortisol ($K_d^{MR} = 0.5 \\text{ nM}$) than GR ($K_d^{GR} = 5 \\text{ nM}$). At a free cortisol concentration of $10 \\text{ nM}$, which corresponds to a circadian peak or a mild stress level, the high-affinity MRs are nearly saturated ($\\theta_{MR} \\approx 95\\%$). In contrast, the lower-affinity GRs are substantially, but not fully, occupied ($\\theta_{GR} \\approx 67\\%$). This differential occupancy is a critical mechanism in cortisol signaling. MRs are largely occupied even at basal cortisol levels, regulating tonic neuronal activity and homeostasis. GRs, requiring higher cortisol concentrations for significant activation, are recruited primarily during stress responses. The calculated occupancy pattern indicates that at $10 \\text{ nM}$ cortisol, the cellular response is strongly driven by both MR and GR signaling, but there remains a considerable reserve capacity for GR-mediated signaling to increase if cortisol levels rise further in response to a more potent stressor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9524 & 0.6667 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4741775"}, {"introduction": "While laboratory tests often measure total hormone levels, it is the small, unbound \"free\" fraction of cortisol that is biologically active.

All necessary data and principles for a unique solution are provided. The physiological context, involving the effect of oral contraceptives on corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and the homeostatic regulation of free cortisol by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, is consistent with established endocrine principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution requires applying the law of mass action to the reversible binding of cortisol (C) to CBG, along with the principles of mass conservation for both cortisol and CBG. The binding reaction is given by:\n$$\nC_{f} + CBG_{f} \\rightleftharpoons C \\cdot CBG\n$$\nwhere $C_f$ is free cortisol, $CBG_f$ is free (unbound) CBG, and $C \\cdot CBG$ is the cortisol-CBG complex.\n\nLet $[C_f]$, $[CBG_f]$, and $[C \\cdot CBG]$ denote the molar concentrations of these species, respectively.

This is reflected in the decrease of the free fraction from $2.44\\%$ to $1.75\\%$. For the biologically active free cortisol concentration to be maintained at its physiological set-point of $10 \\ \\mathrm{nmol/L}$ in the presence of more binding protein, the total amount of cortisol in the system must necessarily increase. The HPA axis accomplishes this by upregulating cortisol synthesis and release until the free concentration returns to the set-point, resulting in a new, higher steady-state total cortisol concentration.
