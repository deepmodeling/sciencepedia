This practice introduces a fundamental, objective method for quantifying medication adherence using pharmacy data.

[@problem_id:4729494]", "problem": "A pediatric psychologist is evaluating medication adherence in a $15$-year-old with a chronic illness requiring daily controller medication. Over an observation window of $180$ days, pharmacy dispensing records show exactly $5$ refills, each providing a $30$-day supply. Assume there is no stockpiling beyond the observation window and that early refills do not create overlapping days beyond the total days supplied within the window. Using the standard definition of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), defined as the proportion of the observation window for which medication is available based on dispensed days’ supply, compute the MPR for this observation window. Then, interpret whether the MPR meets a commonly used clinical adherence threshold of $MPR \\ge 0.8$ in pediatric chronic illness management. Report only the MPR value as your final numerical result, expressed as a decimal (not a fraction), and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required for the MPR value.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and an interpretation of the result. The MPR is defined as the proportion of the observation window for which medication is available based on dispensed days’ supply. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{\\text{Total days' supply}}{\\text{Number of days in the observation period}}\n$$\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement:\n- The number of refills during the observation window is $N_{refills} = 5$.\n- The supply provided by each refill is $D_{supply} = 30$ days.\n- The total length of the observation window is $T_{obs} = 180$ days.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total days' supply of medication dispensed during the observation window. This is the product of the number of refills and the days' supply per refill. The problem specifies to assume that early refills do not create overlapping days beyond the total days supplied, which confirms that we should simply sum the days' supply from all refills.\n$$\nD_{total} = N_{refills} \\times D_{supply}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nD_{total} = 5 \\times 30 = 150 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the definition of MPR to compute the ratio. The numerator is the total days' supply, $D_{total}$, and the denominator is the number of days in the observation period, $T_{obs}$.\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{D_{total}}{T_{obs}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{150}{180}\n$$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{15}{18} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$\nMPR = 5 \\div 6 = 0.8333...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$\nMPR \\approx 0.8333\n$$\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this value against a clinical adherence threshold of $MPR \\ge 0.8$.\nComparing our calculated value to the threshold:\n$$\n0.8333 \\ge 0.8\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the patient's medication adherence, as measured by the MPR, meets the specified clinical threshold.\n\nThe final numerical result to be reported is the MPR value rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8333}$$", "id": "4729494"}, {"introduction": "While objective measures like adherence are vital, understanding the child's subjective experience is equally important.
