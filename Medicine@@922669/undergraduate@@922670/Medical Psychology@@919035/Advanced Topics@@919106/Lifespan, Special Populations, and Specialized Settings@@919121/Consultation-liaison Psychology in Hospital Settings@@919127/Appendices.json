As part of standardized screening, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is administered. The item responses (on the standard Likert scale where each item is scored from $0$ to $3$) are recorded as the following sequence: $2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0$.\n\nUsing the foundational facts that (i) fixed-length symptom scales such as the PHQ-9 are scored by summing item responses to obtain a total severity score, and (ii) widely accepted PHQ-9 clinical thresholds map the total score to categories of depressive symptom severity, proceed as follows:\n\n- Let $x_i$ denote the score on item $i$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,9\\}$ and define the total score $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i$.\n- Use the following standard PHQ-9 severity thresholds to define a category code $C$:\n  - $T \\in [0,4] \\Rightarrow$ minimal depression, encode as $C = 0$.\n  - $T \\in [5,9] \\Rightarrow$ mild depression, encode as $C = 1$.\n  - $T \\in [10,14] \\Rightarrow$ moderate depression, encode as $C = 2$.\n  - $T \\in [15,19] \\Rightarrow$ moderately severe depression, encode as $C = 3$.\n  - $T \\in [20,27] \\Rightarrow$ severe depression, encode as $C = 4$.\n\nUsing these definitions, compute $T$ from the provided item scores and determine $C$ from the thresholds.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression can be mimicked or caused by underlying medical conditions, their treatments, or the stress of hospitalization itself. This problem [@problem_id:4712714] challenges you to apply the biopsychosocial model to a common clinical scenario, weighing the results of a screening tool against crucial medical information to formulate a safe and comprehensive plan of action.", "problem": "A Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychologist is asked to evaluate a patient on a general medical ward. The patient is a $56$-year-old individual hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary team notes poor sleep ($\\le 4$ hours per night), moderate dyspnea, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone). The patient denies substance withdrawal and has no known prior psychiatric diagnoses. As part of routine screening for emotional distress in medical inpatients, the CL psychologist administers the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which comprises $14$ items scored from $0$ to $3$, with two $7$-item subscales: Anxiety and Depression. The patient’s HADS subscale scores are Anxiety $= 9$ and Depression $= 11$. Based on typical screening practice in hospital settings, determine whether these scores cross commonly used screening cutoffs, and select the most appropriate next steps for a CL psychologist in this setting.\n\nWhich of the following best reflects the interpretation and next steps?\n\nA. Both Anxiety and Depression scores meet the “probable case” cutoff (typically $\\ge 11$); therefore, initiate a benzodiazepine for anxiety and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression immediately, without further assessment, to avoid delaying treatment.\n\nB. The Anxiety score suggests a “possible” case and the Depression score meets the “probable” case cutoff; therefore, conduct a structured clinical interview, perform suicide risk assessment, review medical contributors (for example, hypoxia, corticosteroids, sleep disruption), provide brief psychoeducation and supportive interventions, communicate findings to the primary team, and consider psychiatric consultation for medication initiation if symptoms persist or safety concerns emerge.\n\nC. Neither score meets a positive screening threshold; therefore, reassure the patient and defer any further psychological assessment or intervention until outpatient follow-up.\n\nD. Both scores meet a minimal screening threshold (typically $\\ge 8$); therefore, arrange outpatient mental health follow-up after discharge and avoid inpatient assessment to minimize burden during the medical admission.\n\nE. Anxiety is positive (typically $\\ge 8$), but Depression is negative because inpatient cutoffs for Depression are higher than outpatient cutoffs; therefore, provide sleep hygiene only and defer any evaluation of depression until after discharge.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded and presents a realistic clinical scenario, making it valid for solution. The core task is to interpret screening scores within a complex medical context and determine the appropriate standard of care.\n\nFirst, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores must be interpreted. The patient's scores are Anxiety (HADS-A) $= 9$ and Depression (HADS-D) $= 11$. Using the standard, widely accepted cutoffs ($0-7$ = normal, $8-10$ = borderline/possible, $11-21$ = abnormal/probable), the HADS-A score of $9$ indicates a \"possible\" case of anxiety, while the HADS-D score of $11$ indicates a \"probable\" case of depression. Any positive screen, especially a \"probable\" one, requires further clinical evaluation.\n\nSecond, the biopsychosocial model must be applied. The patient is a $56$-year-old with an acute COPD exacerbation, treated with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone). These factors are critical. Corticosteroids are well-known to cause mood changes, anxiety, and insomnia. The underlying COPD and associated dyspnea (breathlessness) can directly cause or mimic anxiety. Poor sleep ($\\le 4$ hours/night) is both a symptom and a contributor to mood distress. A C-L psychologist's primary role is to differentiate a primary psychiatric disorder from a substance/medication-induced disorder or a disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nThird, the appropriate clinical actions must follow from this assessment. Given a \"probable\" depression score, a suicide risk assessment is a mandatory first step for safety. Following that, a comprehensive clinical interview is needed to clarify the diagnosis. This evaluation must explicitly consider the medical contributors (prednisone, hypoxia, sleep loss). Initial interventions should be brief and supportive (e.g., psychoeducation). Finally, the psychologist must liaise with the primary medical team to share findings. A medication consultation is a potential downstream step, not an immediate reflex.\n\nBased on this analysis, the options can be evaluated:\n- **A** is incorrect because the anxiety score is not \"probable,\" and immediate medication initiation, especially a benzodiazepine in a COPD patient, is dangerous and below the standard of care.\n- **B** is correct. It accurately interprets the scores (\"possible\" anxiety, \"probable\" depression) and outlines the perfect sequence of actions according to best practices: conduct a full interview, assess for safety, review medical contributors, provide brief support, communicate with the team, and consider medication consultation judiciously.\n- **C** is incorrect because the scores are clearly positive based on standard thresholds. Deferring assessment would be negligent.\n- **D** is incorrect because avoiding inpatient assessment is inappropriate. The role of a C-L service is to address acute distress that can impact medical recovery during hospitalization.\n- **E** is incorrect because it makes an unsubstantiated claim about different inpatient cutoffs and recommends insufficient action given the high depression score. A HADS-D score of $11$ is always considered clinically significant.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only choice that reflects an evidence-based, safe, and comprehensive approach consistent with the role of a Consultation-Liaison psychologist.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4712714"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most complex challenge in C-L psychology is the differential diagnosis of new cognitive complaints in a hospitalized patient. Overlapping symptoms can make it difficult to distinguish between delirium, an underlying neurocognitive disorder, and cognitive changes secondary to a primary mood disorder. This case [@problem_id:4712690] requires you to act as a clinical detective, using subtle but critical distinctions in the patient's cognitive profile and clinical course to arrive at the most likely diagnosis, a skill that directly determines the path to effective treatment.", "problem": "A Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychology team is asked to evaluate a hospitalized patient on a medical-surgical unit for new cognitive complaints. The patient is a $62$-year-old individual admitted after an uncomplicated hip arthroplasty. Over the past $3$ weeks, nursing staff and the patient's spouse report increasing forgetfulness: misplacing items, difficulty recalling recent conversations, and repeatedly asking the same questions. The patient states, \"I just cannot remember anything, and honestly, I do not care about much anymore.\" Mood appears down, and the patient endorses diminished pleasure in previously enjoyed activities (anhedonia), early morning awakening, reduced appetite, and slowed movements. There are no hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. On interview, orientation is intact to person, place, time, and situation, and the course does not fluctuate from morning to evening. Attention is preserved: the patient correctly repeats forward digit spans of length $7$ and sustains attention during a $5$-minute serial $7$s subtraction task with minimal errors. Memory testing reveals poor free recall of $5$ words after $5$ minutes, but recall improves to $4$ of $5$ with semantic cues (category prompts). Insight into cognitive difficulties is present, and test effort is variable with frequent \"I do not know\" responses early that improve with encouragement. Neurological examination is nonfocal, and there are no tremors or gait changes beyond postoperative limitations. Laboratory studies including basic metabolic panel and thyroid-stimulating hormone are within reference ranges; urinalysis is negative for infection; oxygen saturation is $97\\%$ on room air.

Major Depressive Disorder with prominent cognitive symptoms (\"depressive pseudodementia\") as the primary syndrome\n\nB. Hypoactive delirium due to occult infection as the primary syndrome\n\nC. Early major neurocognitive disorder (probable Alzheimer type) as the primary syndrome\n\nD. Medication-induced amnestic syndrome due to sedative-hypnotic or anticholinergic effects as the primary syndrome", "solution": "This problem requires a differential diagnosis for a hospitalized patient with new cognitive complaints, using a systematic, hierarchical approach.\n\n**1. Evaluation for Delirium:** The first step is to rule out delirium, an acute medical emergency. Delirium is defined by an acute onset, fluctuating course, and a primary disturbance in attention and awareness. This patient's presentation is inconsistent with delirium because: (1) attention is explicitly **preserved** (normal digit span, successful serial 7s task), and (2) the course is stable and **does not fluctuate**. Furthermore, common metabolic and infectious causes have been ruled out by lab tests. Thus, delirium is not the primary diagnosis.\n\n**2. Evaluation for Medication/Substance-Induced Syndrome:** The patient's medications (acetaminophen and PRN low-dose opioid) are unlikely to cause this specific syndrome. Crucially, the problem states the patient is not taking common iatrogenic culprits like benzodiazepines or drugs with high anticholinergic properties. This makes a primary medication-induced syndrome unlikely.\n\n**3. Differentiation between Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Major Neurocognitive Disorder (Dementia):** This is the central clinical challenge. The patient presents a full constellation of depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite changes, psychomotor slowing) sufficient for a diagnosis of MDD. The cognitive profile strongly supports this as the primary etiology. The key distinguishing feature is the memory performance: poor free recall that **improves dramatically with semantic cues** (from very poor to $4$ of $5$ words). This pattern indicates a deficit in spontaneous retrieval, not in encoding or storage. The information has been learned but is difficult to access, a pattern characteristic of the frontal-subcortical dysfunction seen in depression. In contrast, the amnestic syndrome of Alzheimer's disease involves a primary encoding/storage deficit, where cueing provides little to no benefit because the information was not stored effectively in the first place. Other features pointing to depression include the patient's good insight into their deficits and the \"I don't know\" responses that improve with encouragement, suggesting poor effort or cognitive inhibition rather than a true inability.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n- **A. Major Depressive Disorder with prominent cognitive symptoms (\"depressive pseudodementia\") as the primary syndrome:** This diagnosis is the best fit. It accounts for both the full depressive syndrome and the specific cognitive profile, especially the retrieval-based memory deficit that improves with cueing.\n- **B. Hypoactive delirium due to occult infection as the primary syndrome:** This is incorrect. The core features of delirium (inattention and fluctuating course) are absent.\n- **C. Early major neurocognitive disorder (probable Alzheimer type) as the primary syndrome:** This is incorrect. The memory performance, specifically the significant improvement with cueing, is inconsistent with the typical amnestic profile of Alzheimer's disease.\n- **D. Medication-induced amnestic syndrome due to sedative-hypnotic or anticholinergic effects as the primary syndrome:** This is incorrect as the patient is not taking the causative medications.\n\nThe most parsimonious diagnosis that explains the entire clinical picture is Major Depressive Disorder.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4712690"}]}
