This exercise provides a first-principles approach to determining a safe and effective caseload for a behavioral care manager, a critical step in implementing the Collaborative Care Model.

The clinic seeks to determine the care manager’s safe caseload capacity and set a safe panel size threshold using first-principles time budgeting and workload balance. Use the following scientifically realistic parameters.\n\n- The care manager works $40$ hours per week. Standing non-patient obligations consume $0.5$ hours per day for $5$ days ($2.5$ hours per week) for daily huddles, $1.5$ hours per week for caseload review, $1$ hour per week for psychiatrist supervision, $1$ hour per week for the interdisciplinary team meeting, and $2$ hours per week for email and administrative tasks.\n- The average number of weeks per month is $\\frac{52}{12}$.\n- To maintain reliability under variability and fragmentation of care (for example, warm handoffs from the Primary Care Provider (PCP) and unplanned coordination), the clinic caps patient-facing utilization at $0.85$ of the calculable monthly patient-facing time.\n- Each actively enrolled patient requires $2$ actual care manager contacts per month. The mean direct contact time is $21$ minutes, with immediate documentation and registry update time of $9$ minutes per contact.\n- The mean show rate is $0.90$, meaning scheduled contacts must exceed required actual contacts to achieve the actual-contact target.\n- In addition to contacts, measurement-based care with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scoring and care coordination activities require $12$ minutes and $18$ minutes per patient per month, respectively.\n\nStarting only from fundamental time-budget definitions and workload balance (supply equals demand at capacity), derive a closed-form expression for the safe panel size threshold $N$ (number of patients) as the ratio of the safely available monthly patient-facing time to the per-patient monthly time requirement, explicitly accounting for the show rate and per-contact documentation. Then evaluate $N$ numerically using the given parameters. Express the final result as a number of patients (unit: patients) and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The fundamental principle for determining the safe panel size, $N$, is workload balance, where the total supply of available time for patient care equals the total demand of time required by the patient panel at capacity. This can be expressed as:\n$$N = \\frac{\\text{Total safely available monthly patient-facing time}}{\\text{Total time requirement per patient per month}}$$\n\nLet's denote the numerator as $T_{available}$ and the denominator as $T_{per\\_patient}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Safely Available Monthly Patient-Facing Time ($T_{available}$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time dedicated to non-patient obligations per week, $T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly}$.\n$$T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly} = (\\text{huddles}) + (\\text{review}) + (\\text{supervision}) + (\\text{meeting}) + (\\text{admin})$$\n$$T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly} = (0.5 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{day}} \\times 5 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}}) + 1.5 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} + 1 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} + 1 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} + 2 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}}$$\n$$T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly} = 2.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8 \\text{ hours/week}$$\n\nNext, we find the calculable weekly time available for patient-facing activities, $T_{patient\\_weekly}$, by subtracting the non-patient time from the total work hours.\n$$T_{patient\\_weekly} = T_{total\\_weekly} - T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly} = 40 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} - 8 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} = 32 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}}$$\n\nTo find the monthly patient-facing time, we use the given conversion factor $W_m = \\frac{52}{12}$ weeks/month.\n$$T_{patient\\_monthly} = T_{patient\\_weekly} \\times W_m = 32 \\frac{\\text{hr}}{\\text{week}} \\times \\frac{52}{12} \\frac{\\text{weeks}}{\\text{month}}$$\n\nFinally, we apply the safety utilization cap, $U_{cap} = 0.85$, to determine the safely available monthly time, $T_{available}$. To facilitate the subsequent calculation, we convert the time to minutes by multiplying by $60$ min/hr.\n$$T_{available} = T_{patient\\_monthly} \\times U_{cap} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{hr}}$$\n$$T_{available} = \\left( 32 \\times \\frac{52}{12} \\times 0.85 \\right) \\text{hours/month} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{hr}}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Per-Patient Monthly Time Requirement ($T_{per\\_patient}$)**\n\nThe time requirement per patient is the sum of time for contacts and other miscellaneous care activities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time associated with patient contacts. To achieve the target of $C_{actual} = 2$ actual contacts per month, a larger number of contacts must be scheduled to account for the show rate, $S_r = 0.90$. The number of scheduled contacts, $C_{scheduled}$, is:\n$$C_{scheduled} = \\frac{C_{actual}}{S_r} = \\frac{2}{0.90}$$\n\nThe total time budgeted for each contact includes direct contact time ($T_{contact}$) and immediate documentation time ($T_{doc}$).\n$$T_{per\\_contact} = T_{contact} + T_{doc} = 21 \\text{ min} + 9 \\text{ min} = 30 \\text{ min}$$\n\nThe total time demand for contacts per patient per month is the time per contact multiplied by the number of *scheduled* contacts, as this is the time that must be budgeted.\n$$T_{contacts\\_demand} = C_{scheduled} \\times T_{per\\_contact} = \\frac{C_{actual}}{S_r} (T_{contact} + T_{doc})$$\n$$T_{contacts\\_demand} = \\frac{2}{0.90} \\times (21 + 9) \\text{ min/month} = \\frac{2}{0.90} \\times 30 \\text{ min/month}$$\n\nNext, we add the other per-patient monthly time requirements: measurement-based care ($T_{MBC} = 12$ min) and care coordination ($T_{coord} = 18$ min).\n$$T_{other\\_demand} = T_{MBC} + T_{coord} = 12 \\text{ min} + 18 \\text{ min} = 30 \\text{ min/month}$$\n\nThe total per-patient monthly time requirement is the sum of these components.\n$$T_{per\\_patient} = T_{contacts\\_demand} + T_{other\\_demand} = \\left( \\frac{2}{0.90} \\times 30 \\right) + 30 \\text{ min/month}$$\n\n**3. Final Derivation and Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now assemble the closed-form expression for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{T_{available}}{T_{per\\_patient}} = \\frac{ (T_{total\\_weekly} - T_{non\\_patient\\_weekly}) \\times W_m \\times U_{cap} \\times 60 }{ \\frac{C_{actual}}{S_r} (T_{contact} + T_{doc}) + T_{MBC} + T_{coord} }$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$N = \\frac{ (40 - 8) \\times \\frac{52}{12} \\times 0.85 \\times 60 }{ \\frac{2}{0.90} (21 + 9) + 12 + 18 }$$\n\nLet's evaluate the numerator and denominator separately.\n$$T_{available} = 32 \\times \\frac{52}{12} \\times 0.85 \\times 60 = 32 \\times \\frac{13}{3} \\times 0.85 \\times 60 = 7072 \\text{ min/month}$$\n$$T_{per\\_patient} = \\frac{2}{0.90} \\times 30 + 30 = \\frac{60}{0.90} + 30 = \\frac{600}{9} + 30 = \\frac{200}{3} + \\frac{90}{3} = \\frac{290}{3} \\text{ min/patient-month}$$\n\nNow, we compute the final ratio for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{7072}{\\frac{290}{3}} = \\frac{7072 \\times 3}{290} = \\frac{21216}{290} \\approx 73.1586...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures.\n$$N \\approx 73.2$$\n\nThe safe panel size threshold for the behavioral care manager is approximately $73.2$ patients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{73.2}\n$$", "id": "4721925"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of population health within primary care is the use of standardized screening tools to proactively identify patients in need.

We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe formula for PPV is:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.88)(0.12) + (0.15)(0.88)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.1056 + 0.1320 = 0.2376$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.1056}{0.2376} \\approx 0.444444...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.4444$.\n\nThe formula for NPV is:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we can again use the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nAlternatively, since a test is either positive or negative, $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+)$.\n$$P(T^-) = 1 - 0.2376 = 0.7624$$\nLet's verify this with the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.12)(0.12) + (0.85)(0.88) = 0.0144 + 0.7480 = 0.7624$$\nThe results match. Now we can compute the NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.88)}{0.7624} = \\frac{0.7480}{0.7624} \\approx 0.981112...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9811$.\n\nInterpretation of clinical consequences:\n\nThe a posteriori probability of disease given a positive test, the PPV, is $0.4444$. This means that for a patient who screens positive, there is only a $44.44\\%$ chance they actually have major depressive disorder. Consequently, $1 - PPV = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556$, or $55.56\\%$, of positive screens are false positives.\nClinical consequence of false positives: A patient with a false-positive screen will be referred for a more thorough diagnostic assessment by a behavioral health clinician. This consumes valuable clinical resources (time, staff) on individuals who do not have the target disorder. It may also induce unnecessary anxiety or stigma for the patient. However, in an integrated care model, such \"false positives\" for depression might still identify individuals with other sub-threshold mental health issues or psychosocial stressors who could benefit from brief intervention, thus mitigating the \"cost\" of the false positive to some degree.\n\nThe a posteriori probability of being disease-free given a negative test, the NPV, is $0.9811$. This indicates that if a patient screens negative, there is a $98.11\\%$ probability that they are truly free of major depressive disorder. The rate of false negatives among those who screen negative is $1 - NPV = 1 - 0.9811 = 0.0189$, or $1.89\\%$. The total proportion of the population that are false negatives is $P(T^-|D)P(D)=(0.12)(0.12)=0.0144$.\nClinical consequence of false negatives: A patient with a false-negative screen, who actually has major depressive disorder, is missed by the screening process. This is a significant failure for that individual, as they will not be offered further assessment or treatment, potentially leading to worsening of their condition, prolonged suffering, impaired functioning, and increased risk of adverse outcomes. The high NPV provides confidence that a negative screen is very effective at ruling out the disorder for most of the screened-negative population, but the small percentage of missed cases represents a critical lapse in care for those individuals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4444 & 0.9811 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4721951"}, {"introduction": "Measurement-based care is fundamental to integrated behavioral health, but simply tracking scores is not enough; we must understand what degree of change is truly meaningful to patients. This exercise introduces the concept of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), the smallest change in a score that a patient perceives as beneficial. You will practice estimating the MCID by synthesizing two distinct approaches—an anchor-based method rooted in patient experience and a distribution-based method rooted in statistical properties—reflecting the blend of quantitative rigor and patient-centeredness that defines high-quality care [@problem_id:4721915].", "problem": "In an integrated behavioral health program embedded within a primary care clinic, adults with depressive symptoms are co-managed by behavioral health clinicians and primary care providers. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is administered at baseline and again at follow-up after $8$ weeks to assess depressive symptom change. The construct of a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is defined as the smallest change in outcome, measured on the instrument’s scale, that patients perceive as beneficial and that would mandate a change in the patient’s management. Two families of approaches are commonly used to estimate MCID: anchor-based methods using patient global ratings as an external criterion of perceived change, and distribution-based methods using statistical characteristics of the instrument’s score distribution.\n\nA cohort of $N = 180$ patients provided baseline and follow-up PHQ-9 scores. Baseline PHQ-9 had a mean of $14.8$ and a standard deviation of $5.2$. Change scores are defined as follow-up minus baseline, so that negative values indicate improvement. At follow-up, each patient also completed a single-item Global Rating of Change (GRC) with response options categorized as “much better,” “a little better,” “about the same,” “a little worse,” or “much worse.” The numbers of patients and their mean PHQ-9 change within each GRC category were:\n- “much better”: $n = 40$, mean change $= -7.9$,\n- “a little better”: $n = 55$, mean change $= -3.1$,\n- “about the same”: $n = 50$, mean change $= -0.6$,\n- “a little worse”: $n = 20$, mean change $= +1.8$,\n- “much worse”: $n = 15$, mean change $= +5.0$.\n\nAssume that, for the purposes of an anchor-based estimate, the anchor-defined MCID is operationalized as the absolute magnitude of the mean PHQ-9 change among those reporting “a little better.” For a distribution-based estimate, use one-half of the baseline standard deviation. To reconcile the two estimates into a single MCID for clinical decision-making in this integrated primary care context, the clinic has pre-specified an evidence-weighted synthesis rule in which the anchor-based estimate receives weight $w = |r|^{2}$, where $|r|$ is the absolute value of the Pearson correlation between PHQ-9 change scores and the GRC coded on an ordinal scale in which higher values indicate greater perceived improvement. For this cohort, the absolute correlation was $|r| = 0.55$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and data, compute the reconciled MCID as a single value on the PHQ-9 scale.

The process involves calculating each estimate individually and then combining them using a specified evidence-weighted synthesis rule. All calculations will be performed based strictly on the data and definitions provided.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the anchor-based MCID, which will be denoted as $MCID_{anchor}$. The problem defines this as \"the absolute magnitude of the mean PHQ-9 change among those reporting 'a little better'.\" The data provided for the group of patients ($n=55$) reporting \"a little better\" is a mean PHQ-9 change score of $-3.1$.\nTherefore, the anchor-based MCID is the absolute value of this change:\n$$MCID_{anchor} = |-3.1| = 3.1$$\n\nSecond, I will calculate the distribution-based MCID, denoted as $MCID_{dist}$. The problem defines this as \"one-half of the baseline standard deviation.\" The baseline standard deviation of the PHQ-9 scores is given as $5.2$.\nTherefore, the distribution-based MCID is calculated as:\n$$MCID_{dist} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5.2 = 2.6$$\n\nThird, I will determine the weights for the evidence-weighted synthesis. The problem specifies a synthesis rule where the anchor-based estimate receives a weight, $w$, calculated as $w = |r|^{2}$. Here, $|r|$ is the absolute value of the Pearson correlation between PHQ-9 change scores and the Global Rating of Change (GRC), given as $|r| = 0.55$. The synthesis is a weighted average, so the total weight must sum to $1$. Thus, the distribution-based estimate receives a weight of $1-w$.\nThe weight for the anchor-based estimate is:\n$$w = (0.55)^{2} = 0.3025$$\nConsequently, the weight for the distribution-based estimate is:\n$$1 - w = 1 - 0.3025 = 0.6975$$\n\nFourth, I will compute the reconciled MCID, which will be denoted as $MCID_{rec}$. This is the weighted average of the two individual MCID estimates:\n$$MCID_{rec} = (w \\times MCID_{anchor}) + ((1-w) \\times MCID_{dist})$$\nSubstituting the previously calculated values for the estimates and their respective weights:\n$$MCID_{rec} = (0.3025 \\times 3.1) + (0.6975 \\times 2.6)$$\nI will now perform the multiplications:\n$$0.3025 \\times 3.1 = 0.93775$$\n$$0.6975 \\times 2.6 = 1.8135$$\nAdding these products gives the reconciled MCID:\n$$MCID_{rec} = 0.93775 + 1.8135 = 2.75125$$\n\nFinally, the problem statement requires that the final answer be rounded to three significant figures.
