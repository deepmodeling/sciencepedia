The parameters and assumptions provided are consistent with standard models of receptor pharmacology. We will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for fractional receptor occupancy, denoted by $O$. Fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[RL]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{total}$.\n$$O = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}}$$\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of free (unbound) receptors, $[R]$, and ligand-bound receptors, $[RL]$.\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + [RL]$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of occupancy gives:\n$$O = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the reversible binding reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the concentration of the free ligand. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for occupancy:\n$$O = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero ligand concentration, the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex, $[RL]$, will be non-zero. We can therefore factor out $[RL]$ from the denominator and cancel it with the numerator:\n$$O = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$O = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [L]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional receptor occupancy in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. This is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a single, non-cooperative binding site.\n\nNext, we use this derived formula to compute the specific occupancies for the $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ adrenergic receptors.

All provided data and physiological principles are consistent with established knowledge in psychophysiology and cardiology. The task is a direct application of a standard formula to a given dataset.

The RMSSD is a time-domain measure of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) that quantifies short-term, beat-to-beat variations in heart rate, which are primarily mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve.\n\nLet the series of $N$ successive NN intervals be denoted by $\\{NN_1, NN_2, \\ldots, NN_N\\}$. The RMSSD is defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of the successive differences between adjacent NN intervals.

The problem states that RMSSD is used as a proxy for vagal modulation, and the foundational facts mention that parasympathetic vagal efferents increase beat-to-beat variability. Therefore, a higher RMSSD value corresponds to greater beat-to-beat variability and thus stronger vagal (parasympathetic) modulation.\n\nOur calculated RMSSD is $31.30$ ms. The given baseline is $20$ ms. Since $31.30 > 20$, the calculated value indicates stronger vagal modulation than the state represented by the baseline.

It describes the baroreceptor reflex, a fundamental negative-feedback mechanism in cardiovascular physiology. An $\\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic agonist induces vasoconstriction, which increases systemic vascular resistance and, consequently, mean arterial pressure ($MAP$). The resulting stretch of arterial baroreceptors (in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch) triggers a reflex response characterized by increased parasympathetic outflow and decreased sympathetic outflow to the sinoatrial node of the heart. This leads to a decrease in heart rate, known as reflex bradycardia, which is observed as an increase in the RR interval on an electrocardiogram.
