A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general relationship between receptor occupancy fraction ($f$), free ligand concentration ($[L]$), and the dissociation constant ($K_d$), as requested. The definition of occupancy fraction is:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$$\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of unbound and bound receptors:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nThe definition of the dissociation constant is $K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$.
