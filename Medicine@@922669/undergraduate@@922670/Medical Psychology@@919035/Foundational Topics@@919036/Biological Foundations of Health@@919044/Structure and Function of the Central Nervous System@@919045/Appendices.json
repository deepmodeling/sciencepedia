The components of the reflex (afferent fiber, synapse, efferent fiber) and the associated physiological processes (axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, neuromuscular transmission) are correctly represented. The effect of demyelination, which is a significant reduction in nerve conduction velocity, is a well-established pathophysiological principle.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nThe total reflex latency, $T$, is the sum of the time delays for each segment of the reflex arc. This can be expressed as the sum of the afferent conduction time, the central synaptic delay, the efferent conduction time, and the neuromuscular junction transmission delay.\n\nThe general formula for total latency $T$ is:\n$$T = t_{\\mathrm{aff}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{syn}} + t_{\\mathrm{eff}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{NMJ}}$$\nwhere $t_{\\mathrm{aff}}$ is the afferent conduction time and $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the efferent conduction time.\n\nFrom the basic kinematic relation, time is distance divided by velocity. Therefore:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{aff}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{aff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{aff}}}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the latency equation, we get the comprehensive formula:\n$$T = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{aff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{aff}}} + \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{eff}}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{syn}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{NMJ}}$$\n\nThe path lengths $L$ are given in meters (m) and the velocities $v$ are in meters per second (m/s). The resulting conduction times $L/v$ will be in seconds (s). The delays $\\tau_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{NMJ}}$ are given in milliseconds (ms). To ensure unit consistency, the conduction times must be converted from seconds to milliseconds by multiplying by $1000$.\n\nThe latency in milliseconds is therefore:\n$$T \\text{ (ms)} = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{aff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{aff}}} + \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{v_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) \\times 1000 + \\tau_{\\mathrm{syn}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{NMJ}}$$\n\n**1. Healthy Reflex Latency ($T_{\\mathrm{healthy}}$)**\nWe use the healthy state parameters:\n$L_{\\mathrm{aff}} = 0.8$, $L_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.7$, $v_{\\mathrm{aff,healthy}} = 70$, $v_{\\mathrm{eff,healthy}} = 55$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 0.6$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{NMJ}} = 0.8$.\n\n$$T_{\\mathrm{healthy}} = \\left( \\frac{0.8}{70} + \\frac{0.7}{55} \\right) \\times 1000 + 0.6 + 0.8$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{healthy}} \\approx (0.01142857\\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.01272727\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1000 + 1.4$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{healthy}} \\approx (0.02415584\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1000 + 1.4$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{healthy}} \\approx 24.15584\\ \\mathrm{ms} + 1.4\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 25.55584\\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_{\\mathrm{healthy}} = 25.56$ ms.\n\n**2. Demyelinated Reflex Latency ($T_{\\mathrm{dem}}$)**\nWe use the demyelinated state parameters, keeping the fixed delays and lengths constant:\n$v_{\\mathrm{aff,dem}} = 20$, $v_{\\mathrm{eff,dem}} = 18$.\n\n$$T_{\\mathrm{dem}} = \\left( \\frac{0.8}{20} + \\frac{0.7}{18} \\right) \\times 1000 + 0.6 + 0.8$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{dem}} = (0.04\\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.038888... \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1000 + 1.4$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{dem}} \\approx (0.078888... \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1000 + 1.4$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{dem}} \\approx 78.888... \\mathrm{ms} + 1.4\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 80.2888... \\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_{\\mathrm{dem}} = 80.29$ ms.\n\n**3. Increase in Latency Attributable to Demyelination ($\\Delta T$)**\nThe increase in latency is the difference between the demyelinated and healthy latencies.\n$$\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{dem}} - T_{\\mathrm{healthy}}$$\nUsing the unrounded values for higher precision in the intermediate step:\n$$\\Delta T \\approx 80.2888... \\mathrm{ms} - 25.55584\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 54.7330... \\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta T = 54.73$ ms.

The application of this model to fear conditioning in the lateral amygdala, and the mapping of its parameters ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\lambda$) to specific neurobiological components (CS afferent strength, US-gated neuromodulation, nociceptive drive strength), is a standard and highly influential framework in computational neuroscience.

It asks for the derivation of a closed-form solution for a first-order linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation with a given initial condition. Such a problem has a unique, stable, and meaningful solution, provided the learning rate $\\alpha \\beta$ is within a reasonable range (e.g., $0 < \\alpha \\beta < 1$), which is implicit for a stable learning process.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\n**1. Formalizing the Update Rule**\n\nThe problem states that the change in associative strength, $\\Delta V_{t}$, from trial $t$ to trial $t+1$ is proportional to the prediction error. The change is defined as $\\Delta V_{t} = V_{t+1} - V_{t}$. The prediction error is given by the difference between the US asymptote, $\\lambda$, and the current associative strength, $V_{t}$. The proportionality constant is the product of the cue salience, $\\alpha$, and the US associability, $\\beta$.\n\nPutting these pieces together yields the mathematical expression for the change in associative strength on a given trial $t$:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{t} = \\alpha \\beta (\\lambda - V_{t})\n$$\nThis leads to the per-trial update rule for $V_{t+1}$ in terms of $V_{t}$:\n$$\nV_{t+1} - V_{t} = \\alpha \\beta (\\lambda - V_{t})\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the recurrence relation:\n$$\nV_{t+1} = V_{t} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda - \\alpha \\beta V_{t}\n$$\n$$\nV_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)V_{t} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The task is to find a closed-form expression for $V_{n}$ given the initial condition $V_{0} = 0$.\n\n**2. Justification of Parameter Mapping**\n\nAs required, we justify the mapping of the model parameters to neural substrates based on the problem description:\n- **$\\lambda$ (Asymptote)**: This parameter represents the maximum level of conditioning that the unconditioned stimulus (US) can support. The problem states it is \"set by nociceptive drive.\" This corresponds to the intensity of the US (e.g., footshock), which is encoded by the firing rates in nociceptive pathways projecting to the amygdala. A stronger shock leads to greater neural activation in these pathways, setting a higher ceiling $\\lambda$ for the learned associative strength.\n- **$\\alpha$ (Cue Salience)**: This parameter scales the influence of the conditioned stimulus (CS) on learning. It is \"set by the effectiveness of conditioned stimulus afferents onto lateral amygdala neurons.\" This means $\\alpha$ reflects the strength and efficacy of the sensory pathway for the CS (e.g., auditory tone). A more salient (e.g., louder or more distinct) tone would cause a stronger response in the auditory thalamus and cortex, resulting in more effective synaptic transmission onto amygdala neurons, thus increasing the value of $\\alpha$ and accelerating learning about that cue.\n- **$\\beta$ (US Associability)**: This parameter scales the influence of the US as a teaching signal. It is \"set by neuromodulatory teaching signals gated by unconditioned stimulus processing.\" This reflects that the US not only provides the outcome to be predicted (related to $\\lambda$) but also signals that learning should occur. The unexpectedness or salience of the US can trigger the release of neuromodulators (like norepinephrine, dopamine, or acetylcholine) within the amygdala. These neuromodulators modulate synaptic plasticity, effectively opening a \"gate\" for learning. The magnitude of this neuromodulatory signal, which depends on how the US is processed, is captured by $\\beta$.\n\nThe overall learning rate is the product $\\alpha \\beta$, reflecting that effective learning requires both a salient cue to learn about and a potent teaching signal to drive the plastic changes.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Closed-Form Expression for $V_{n}$**\n\nWe will solve the recurrence relation $V_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)V_{t} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda$ with the initial condition $V_{0}=0$ by iteration. Let's write out the first few terms to identify a pattern.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$$\nV_{1} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)V_{0} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)(0) + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda = \\alpha \\beta \\lambda\n$$\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$$\nV_{2} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)V_{1} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)(\\alpha \\beta \\lambda) + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)\\alpha \\beta \\lambda + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda\n$$\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$$\nV_{3} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)V_{2} + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)[(1 - \\alpha \\beta)\\alpha \\beta \\lambda + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda] + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda\n$$\n$$\nV_{3} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{2}\\alpha \\beta \\lambda + (1 - \\alpha \\beta)\\alpha \\beta \\lambda + \\alpha \\beta \\lambda\n$$\n\nBy factoring out the common term $\\alpha \\beta \\lambda$, we can see a clear pattern emerging:\n$$\nV_{n} = \\alpha \\beta \\lambda \\left[1 + (1 - \\alpha \\beta) + (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{2} + \\dots + (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{n-1}\\right]\n$$\nThe expression in the brackets is a finite geometric series with $n$ terms, a first term $a=1$, and a common ratio $r = (1 - \\alpha \\beta)$.\n\nThe sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula $S_{n} = a \\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}$.\nSubstituting our values for $a$ and $r$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{i} = \\frac{1 - (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{n}}{1 - (1 - \\alpha \\beta)} = \\frac{1 - (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{n}}{\\alpha \\beta}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this sum back into our expression for $V_{n}$:\n$$\nV_{n} = \\alpha \\beta \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1 - (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{n}}{\\alpha \\beta} \\right)\n$$\nAssuming $\\alpha \\beta \\neq 0$ (which is necessary for any learning to occur), the $\\alpha \\beta$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding the final closed-form expression for the associative strength after $n$ trials:\n$$\nV_{n} = \\lambda \\left(1 - (1 - \\alpha \\beta)^{n}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the associative strength $V_{n}$ grows from an initial value of $V_{0}=0$ and approaches the asymptote $\\lambda$ as the number of trials $n$ increases.
