This means $c(t)$ is a piecewise linear function. The integral can be broken down into segments corresponding to the linear pieces:\n$$ \\text{AUCi} = \\int_{0}^{60} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{30} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{30}^{60} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nThe definite integral of a linear function over an interval $[a, b]$ corresponds to the area of a trapezoid.

In some literature, AUCi is defined to only accumulate area where $c(t)b$. However, for this problem, the function $c(t)$ is always greater than or equal to the baseline $b=10$ over the entire interval $[0, 60]$, so this distinction is moot.

This conceptual practice challenges you to integrate GAS with the Yerkes-Dodson principle, which describes how performance declines when arousal becomes excessively high.

[@problem_id:4744796]", "problem": "A hospital resident is assigned to coordinate a prolonged mass-casualty response. Consider two widely accepted bases. First, the Yerkes–Dodson principle: task performance $P$ varies nonlinearly with arousal $A$ such that there exists an optimal arousal $A^{\\ast}$ at which $P(A)$ is maximized; for $AA^{\\ast}$ or $AA^{\\ast}$, performance declines. Second, Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS): the organism’s response to a sustained stressor proceeds through an initial Alarm stage (rapid activation of the Sympathetic–Adreno–Medullary (SAM) system and the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis), a Resistance stage (continued mobilization with counter-regulation to maintain function), and an Exhaustion stage (failure of adaptive mechanisms with resource depletion and dysregulation).\n\nAssume the resident is performing a complex cognitive task.

Performance improves with increasing arousal up to an optimal point ($A^{\\ast}$), after which further increases in arousal lead to a decline in performance.\n\nThe GAS model describes three stages:\n1.  **Alarm:** The initial, rapid response to a stressor, characterized by a surge in arousal (SAM and HPA activation).\n2.  **Resistance:** A prolonged period of adaptation where the body maintains a high level of arousal and function to cope with the ongoing stressor. Physiologically, this stage involves sustained, but regulated, HPA axis activity. In terms of the Yerkes-Dodson curve, an individual in this stage is operating at or near their optimal arousal level, $A^{\\ast}$, maintaining high performance.\n3.  **Exhaustion:** If the stressor persists, adaptive mechanisms begin to fail. This is not simply a depletion of arousal but a state of dysregulation where high physiological stress continues but can no longer be effectively managed. Resources are depleted, and control systems (like HPA negative feedback) break down.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this framework:\n\n*   **A. The decline begins at the transition from Alarm to Resistance...**: This is incorrect. The transition into Resistance is a period of successful adaptation. While arousal is high, the body is managing it to maintain function. This corresponds to moving towards the peak ($A^{\\ast}$) of the Yerkes-Dodson curve, not away from it in a sustained decline.\n*   **B. The decline begins at the transition from Resistance to Exhaustion...**: This is correct. The Exhaustion stage is defined by the failure of the adaptive processes that characterize Resistance. The system remains under high arousal due to the persistent stressor, but the regulatory capacity collapses. This combination of continued high arousal and failing physiological control pushes the individual past the optimal point $A^{\\ast}$ and onto the descending limb of the Yerkes-Dodson curve, causing a sustained decline in performance.\n*   **C. The decline begins at the onset of Alarm...**: While the initial shock of the Alarm stage might cause a temporary performance dip by overshooting $A^{\\ast}$, this is typically a transient effect. The question asks for a *sustained decline* due to *failing Resistance*. The Alarm stage precedes Resistance, it is not a failure of it. Performance is expected to recover and stabilize during the subsequent Resistance stage.\n*   **D. The decline begins midway through Resistance...**: This option incorrectly suggests that habituation leads to under-arousal during Resistance. The Resistance stage is characterized by sustained *high* physiological arousal necessary to cope with the stressor. A decline from under-arousal would mean moving leftward on the Yerkes-Dodson curve, which is inconsistent with the physiology of this stage.\n\nTherefore, the most logical point for a sustained performance decline due to failing adaptation is the transition from Resistance to Exhaustion, where high arousal becomes dysregulated and detrimental.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4744796"}]}
