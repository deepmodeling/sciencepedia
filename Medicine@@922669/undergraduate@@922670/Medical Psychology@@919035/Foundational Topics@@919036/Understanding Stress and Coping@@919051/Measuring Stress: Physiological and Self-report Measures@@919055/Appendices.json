Since the index $i$ for $RR_i$ runs from $1$ to $N$, the index for the differences $d_i$ runs from $i=1$ to $i=N-1$. This generates a new series of $N-1$ successive differences: $\\{d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_{N-1}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Root Mean Square (RMS) operation**: The RMS operation consists of three steps applied to the set of successive differences $\\{d_i\\}_{i=1}^{N-1}$.\n    \n    a.  **Square (S)**: Each successive difference $d_i$ is squared. This yields the set of squared differences:\n    $$ \\{d_1^2, d_2^2, \\dots, d_{N-1}^2\\} = \\{(RR_2-RR_1)^2, (RR_3-RR_2)^2, \\dots, (RR_N-RR_{N-1})^2\\} $$\n\n    b.  **Mean (M)**: The arithmetic mean of these $N-1$ squared differences is calculated.

The phrase \"with respect to increase\" further specifies that only the area above this baseline value is to be considered.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit expression for AUCi for discrete data.

Since all given measurements $m_i$ for $i > 1$ are greater than $m_1$, the entire curve segment from $t_2$ to $t_8$ lies above the baseline $m_1=12.0$. In this specific case, the AUCi can be calculated by subtracting the rectangular area under the baseline from the total area under the curve.\n\nLet's derive the general formula for AUCi starting from the fundamental definition as requested.
