This exercise highlights the profound connection between mind and body, demonstrating how psychological processes have tangible health consequences.", "problem": "A $52$-year-old patient on postoperative day $1$ after total knee arthroplasty reports moderate to severe pain, with a self-reported pain intensity $P = 7$ on a $0$ to $10$ scale. Baseline resting heart rate is $HR_0 = 68$ beats per minute, baseline blood pressure is $BP_0 = 120/78$ millimeters of mercury, and baseline morning salivary cortisol is $C_0$ (assayed in micrograms per deciliter). Over the next $6$ hours, the care team will monitor heart rate $HR(t)$, blood pressure $BP(t)$, salivary cortisol $C(t)$, and skin conductance $SC(t)$ as proximate indices of Sympathetic-Adrenomedullary (SAM) activation and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. At $4$ weeks, the team will assess pain interference $PI$, depressive symptoms $D$, fear-avoidance $FA$, and adherence $A$ to physical therapy.\n\nDuring the first postoperative nursing interaction, the patient demonstrates one of three coping response patterns:\n\n- Coping class $\\mathcal{A}$: Planful, problem-focused approach coping. The patient formulates a concrete analgesia and mobilization plan, uses paced breathing and guided imagery, communicates high perceived control $PC$, and reappraises the pain as time-limited and manageable.\n\n- Coping class $\\mathcal{B}$: Adaptive emotion-focused, meaning-based coping. The patient practices acceptance and positive reappraisal (e.g., gratitude for support), seeks social support, and reduces distress without directly altering the nociceptive input.\n\n- Coping class $\\mathcal{C}$: Avoidant, ruminative catastrophizing. The patient fixates on worst-case outcomes, declines early mobilization and coaching, expresses low perceived control $PC$, attempts to suppress or ignore pain signals, and avoids engaging with instructions.\n\nWhich option most accurately predicts the near-term physiological trajectories $\\big(HR(t), BP(t), C(t), SC(t)\\big)$ over the next $6$ hours and the longer-term psychological outcomes $\\big(PI, D, FA, A\\big)$ at $4$ weeks under each coping class, in a manner consistent with the transactional model of stress and coping in medical psychology?\n\nA. For $\\mathcal{A}$: $HR(t)$ and $BP(t)$ drift toward $HR_0$ and $BP_0$, $C(t)$ and $SC(t)$ show declining trajectories toward baseline as perceived control reduces threat appraisal; at $4$ weeks: high $A$, low $PI$, low $D$, low $FA$. For $\\mathcal{B}$: moderate reductions in $HR(t)$, $C(t)$, and $SC(t)$ relative to pain-driven baselines; at $4$ weeks: moderate to high $A$, reduced $PI$ and $D$, low to moderate $FA$. For $\\mathcal{C}$: sustained elevations $HR(t) > HR_0$, $BP(t) > BP_0$, elevated $C(t)$ and $SC(t)$ due to persistent threat appraisals and low $PC$; at $4$ weeks: low $A$, high $PI$, high $D$, high $FA$.\n\nB. For $\\mathcal{A}$: $HR(t)$, $BP(t)$, and $C(t)$ increase because “active coping” is arousing; for $\\mathcal{B}$: little change in physiology; for $\\mathcal{C}$: $HR(t)$, $BP(t)$, and $C(t)$ decrease because distraction reduces attention to pain; at $4$ weeks: $\\mathcal{C}$ shows the best outcomes (high $A$, low $PI$, low $D$, low $FA$) due to conservation of energy, whereas $\\mathcal{A}$ shows risk of burnout.\n\nC. For $\\mathcal{A}$: short-term physiology improves, but at $4$ weeks realistic reappraisal increases awareness, yielding higher $PI$ and $D$ than $\\mathcal{B}$; for $\\mathcal{B}$: greatest near-term calming in $HR(t)$ and $C(t)$ and best long-term outcomes; for $\\mathcal{C}$: moderate physiological elevations with similar long-term outcomes to $\\mathcal{B}$ if pain intensity $P$ is controlled.\n\nD. For all $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\mathcal{B}$, and $\\mathcal{C}$: near-term physiology is equivalent because pain intensity $P = 7$ dominates $HR(t)$, $BP(t)$, $C(t)$, and $SC(t)$; differences appear only at $4$ weeks, with $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ similar and $\\mathcal{C}$ worse on $PI$, $D$, $FA$, and $A$.", "solution": "This problem requires applying the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping to predict physiological and psychological outcomes based on different coping styles in a post-surgical pain context. The core principle is that appraisal and coping mediate the relationship between a stressor (pain) and the stress response.\n\n### Analysis of Coping Classes based on the Transactional Model\n\n1.  **Coping Class $\\mathcal{A}$ (Planful, problem-focused approach):**\n    *   **Appraisal:** The patient appraises the pain as a threat but has a high secondary appraisal of coping resources, indicated by high perceived control ($PC$) and planful behavior. This combination reframes the situation into a manageable challenge.\n    *   **Near-term Physiological Prediction:** Effective coping that increases perceived control down-regulates the physiological stress response. The initial activation of the SAM and HPA axes (elevated $HR$, $BP$, $C$, $SC$) due to the pain will be attenuated. Physiological measures will trend back toward baseline ($HR_0, BP_0$).\n    *   **Longer-term Outcome Prediction:** This active, engaged coping style is highly adaptive for rehabilitation. It predicts high adherence ($A$) to physical therapy, which in turn leads to better functional outcomes, including low pain interference ($PI$), low fear-avoidance ($FA$), and a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms ($D$).\n\n2.  **Coping Class $\\mathcal{B}$ (Adaptive emotion-focused, meaning-based):**\n    *   **Appraisal:** This patient focuses on managing the emotional distress caused by the pain, an adaptive strategy when direct control over the stressor is limited (as with acute post-operative pain).\n    *   **Near-term Physiological Prediction:** By regulating emotional distress through acceptance and reappraisal, this coping style also buffers the physiological stress response. We expect to see a reduction in $HR$, $C$, and $SC$ from their peak levels.\n    *   **Longer-term Outcome Prediction:** This style promotes psychological resilience. It should lead to good outcomes, such as reduced $PI$ and $D$. Adherence ($A$) might be slightly less driven than in class $\\mathcal{A}$ but still good, resulting in favorable outcomes overall.\n\n3.  **Coping Class $\\mathcal{C}$ (Avoidant, ruminative catastrophizing):**\n    *   **Appraisal:** This patient exhibits a low secondary appraisal of control ($PC$) and magnifies the primary appraisal of threat through catastrophizing.\n    *   **Near-term Physiological Prediction:** This maladaptive style perpetuates the sense of an uncontrollable threat, leading to sustained activation of the SAM and HPA axes. $HR$, $BP$, $C$, and $SC$ will remain elevated above baseline.\n    *   **Longer-term Outcome Prediction:** This coping style is a well-known predictor of poor clinical outcomes. Declining mobilization implies low adherence ($A$). Catastrophizing and fear are central to high fear-avoidance ($FA$). The combination of persistent stress and poor functional recovery leads to high pain interference ($PI$) and a high risk for depressive symptoms ($D$).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Option A:** This option aligns perfectly with the predictions derived from the transactional model for all three coping classes. It correctly predicts physiological calming and positive long-term outcomes for $\\mathcal{A}$, moderate calming and good outcomes for $\\mathcal{B}$, and sustained physiological arousal and poor long-term outcomes for $\\mathcal{C}$.\n*   **Option B:** This option is incorrect. It misunderstands the physiological effects of coping. Effective coping (class $\\mathcal{A}$) reduces, not increases, the net stress response. Avoidant catastrophizing (class $\\mathcal{C}$) amplifies, not decreases, the stress response and leads to the worst, not the best, outcomes.\n*   **Option C:** This option is incorrect. It wrongly predicts that realistic reappraisal (class $\\mathcal{A}$) leads to worse long-term outcomes. It also incorrectly suggests that class $\\mathcal{C}$ outcomes would be similar to $\\mathcal{B}$ if pain were controlled; coping style is an independent predictor of outcome beyond pain intensity itself.\n*   **Option D:** This option is incorrect. It negates the central premise of the transactional model by claiming that the initial physiological response is solely determined by the pain stimulus, independent of coping. The model's key insight is that appraisal and coping *modulate* this response in the near term.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the most accurate and theoretically consistent predictions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$", "id": "4756480"}, {"introduction": "The Transactional Model is not static; it describes a dynamic and iterative process. Our appraisals and coping strategies evolve as we interact with a stressful environment and receive feedback. This next exercise presents a thought experiment that isolates a key aspect of this dynamic process: the mismatch between what we believe we can control (perceived control, $C_p$) and what is actually controllable (objective control, $C_o$). By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:4756502], you will explore how the model predicts an individual will initially act based on their perceptions, react to failure, and then adaptively shift their coping strategy through the crucial process of reappraisal.", "problem": "In the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, stress arises from a person–environment transaction in which the individual evaluates the situation through two linked appraisals. Primary appraisal, denoted $A_1$, is the evaluation of the significance of a stressor $S$ for well-being, including whether $S$ is irrelevant, benign-positive, a challenge, or a threat. Secondary appraisal, denoted $A_2$, is the evaluation of coping resources and options, which includes judgments of perceived control ($C_p$) and objective control ($C_o$). Perceived control $C_p$ refers to the person’s belief about their ability to influence $S$ or its outcomes, whereas objective control $C_o$ reflects the actual, externally determined controllability of $S$. In this framework, problem-focused coping involves efforts to change $S$ or its contingencies, while emotion-focused coping involves efforts to regulate the emotional response to $S$. Appraisal is iterative, so feedback from coping attempts generates reappraisal.\n\nConsider the following counterfactual scenario situated in a medical context. A junior physician, Mira, has been assigned a fixed night-shift rotation by the hospital’s centralized staffing system. She appraises the rotation as a threat in $A_1$ because it disrupts sleep and undermines her health. In $A_2$, she believes she can successfully renegotiate the schedule by speaking with supervisors and proposing alternative coverage, so her perceived control $C_p$ is high. However, because the rotation is locked by contractual constraints and staffing minima set at the system level, the actual controllability $C_o$ is low. In short, $C_p$ is high while $C_o$ is low.\n\nWhich of the following predictions about coping selection and emotional outcomes is most consistent with the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping applied to this $C_p \\gg C_o$ mismatch?\n\nA. Mira will initially select problem-focused coping (for example, planning, negotiation, and seeking instrumental support) based on high $C_p$. As these attempts fail due to low $C_o$, feedback will prompt reappraisal, increasing frustration, anger, and possible self-blame. She will then shift toward emotion-focused strategies (for example, acceptance, cognitive reframing, and meaning-making), which gradually reduce distress while leaving $S$ unchanged.\n\nB. Mira will immediately select emotion-focused coping (for example, acceptance) because high $C_p$ reduces perceived threat, leading to low distress and no attempt to change $S$.\n\nC. Mira will persist with problem-focused coping and successfully change the schedule because high $C_p$ is sufficient to produce control, leading to mastery and sustained positive affect.\n\nD. Mira will exhibit learned helplessness from the outset, selecting disengagement and withdrawal with depressive affect, because low $C_o$ always dominates coping selection regardless of $C_p$.\n\nE. Mira will continue problem-focused efforts indefinitely without reappraisal, with distress escalating but no shift to emotion-focused strategies, because high $C_p$ blocks any change in coping mode even when outcomes remain unchanged.", "solution": "This problem tests the dynamic and iterative aspects of the Transactional Model, specifically how an individual adapts to a mismatch between perceived control ($C_p$) and objective control ($C_o$).\n\n### Derivation of the Coping Process\n\n1.  **Initial Coping Selection:** The model posits that coping choice is guided by secondary appraisal. Mira's perceived control ($C_p$) is high. According to the model, a high appraisal of control motivates **problem-focused coping**. Therefore, Mira's initial actions will be aimed at changing the stressful situation (the schedule). She will attempt to negotiate, plan, and solve the problem directly.\n\n2.  **Feedback from the Environment:** The problem states that objective control ($C_o$) is low; the schedule is unchangeable. Consequently, Mira's problem-focused coping attempts are bound to fail. This failure provides crucial negative feedback from the environment.\n\n3.  **Reappraisal:** The model is transactional and iterative; feedback leads to reappraisal. The consistent failure of her efforts will force Mira to reassess her initial belief. Her perceived control ($C_p$) will be revised downward to align with the reality of low objective control ($C_o$). During this phase of failed effort, emotions like frustration and anger are expected.\n\n4.  **Shift in Coping Strategy:** Once Mira reappraises the situation as uncontrollable, the rationale for problem-focused coping disappears. Continuing to try to change an unchangeable situation would be maladaptive. The model predicts a strategic shift. Since the stressor remains but is now deemed uncontrollable, the focus of coping will pivot to managing the emotional distress it causes. This is, by definition, **emotion-focused coping**. She will adopt strategies like acceptance, reframing the situation to find meaning, or managing her stress through other means.\n\nThis sequence—initial problem-focused coping, failure, reappraisal, and a shift to emotion-focused coping—is the canonical process predicted by the model for this specific type of person-environment mismatch.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Mira will initially select problem-focused coping... based on high $C_p$. As these attempts fail due to low $C_o$, feedback will prompt reappraisal... She will then shift toward emotion-focused strategies...** This option perfectly describes the entire dynamic sequence derived from the model's principles.\n*   **B. Mira will immediately select emotion-focused coping...** This is incorrect. High $C_p$ prompts problem-focused coping, not immediate acceptance.\n*   **C. Mira will... successfully change the schedule because high $C_p$ is sufficient to produce control...** This is incorrect. It confuses subjective belief ($C_p$) with objective reality ($C_o$). Her belief cannot change the unchangeable constraints of the system.\n*   **D. Mira will exhibit learned helplessness from the outset... because low $C_o$ always dominates... regardless of $C_p$.** This is incorrect. Coping is driven by *perceived* control. She will act on her high $C_p$ first. The model is centered on appraisal, not objective reality alone.\n*   **E. Mira will continue problem-focused efforts indefinitely without reappraisal...** This is incorrect because it ignores a fundamental component of the model explicitly mentioned in the problem: \"feedback from coping attempts generates reappraisal.\" The model assumes an adaptive, iterative process.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only choice that accurately reflects the dynamic process of the Transactional Model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4756502"}, {"introduction": "A powerful way to solidify your understanding of a theoretical model is to build a working, computational version of it. This final hands-on practice guides you through the process of translating the core principles of the Transactional Model into a set of clear mathematical functions.

By implementing this model [@problem_id:4756526], you can simulate how the balance between perceived demands ($A_1$) and perceived resources ($A_2$) determines the probability of a stress response across various clinical scenarios, making the abstract concepts of the theory concrete and computable.", "problem": "You are given a parameterized stressor vector with four normalized components $(n,u,c,a)$ representing novelty, unpredictability, controllability, and ambiguity, respectively. All components satisfy $0 \\le n \\le 1$, $0 \\le u \\le 1$, $0 \\le c \\le 1$, and $0 \\le a \\le 1$. In the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, primary appraisal evaluates the significance of a situation (for example, perceived threat or challenge) and secondary appraisal evaluates perceived coping options and controllability. Your task is to construct two appraisal functions consistent with the following foundational principles and constraints derived from widely accepted theory in medical psychology:\n\n1. Primary appraisal function $A_1 = f(n,u,a)$:\n   - $A_1$ maps the tuple $(n,u,a)$ to the closed interval $[0,1]$.\n   - $A_1$ is continuously differentiable in each argument.\n   - $A_1$ is monotonically non-decreasing in $n$, $u$, and $a$.\n   - $A_1$ exhibits saturation and diminishing sensitivity as any of $n$, $u$, or $a$ approach $1$.\n   - A convex combination of the inputs should be used to reflect differential contribution weights $w_n$, $w_u$, and $w_a$ satisfying $w_n + w_u + w_a = 1$ with $w_n = 0.3$, $w_u = 0.4$, and $w_a = 0.3$.\n   - Use a smooth threshold at $0.5$ with a gain (softness) parameter of $6$ to transition between low and high primary appraisal.\n\n2. Secondary appraisal function $A_2 = h(c)$:\n   - $A_2$ maps $c$ to the closed interval $[0,1]$.\n   - $A_2$ is continuously differentiable.\n   - $A_2$ is monotonically non-decreasing in $c$.\n   - $A_2$ exhibits saturation and diminishing sensitivity as $c$ approaches $1$.\n   - Use a smooth threshold at $0.5$ with a gain (softness) parameter of $6$ to transition between low and high secondary appraisal.\n\n3. Final outcome:\n   - Define a stress activation probability $p_{\\text{stress}} \\in [0,1]$ that increases as $A_1$ increases relative to $A_2$, consistent with the principle that stress is more likely when perceived demands exceed perceived coping resources.\n   - $p_{\\text{stress}}$ should be constructed via a smooth, bounded, monotonically increasing function of the difference $A_1 - A_2$ using a gain parameter of $8$.\n\nYour program must implement $A_1$, $A_2$, and $p_{\\text{stress}}$ consistent with the above principles and compute $p_{\\text{stress}}$ for the following test suite of clinical scenarios, expressed as ordered tuples $(n,u,c,a)$:\n\n- Scenario $1$ (first-time preoperative patient): $(0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7)$\n- Scenario $2$ (chronic disease management with strong perceived control): $(0.2, 0.3, 0.9, 0.2)$\n- Scenario $3$ (ambiguous diagnosis with uncertain plan): $(0.7, 0.7, 0.4, 0.9)$\n- Scenario $4$ (routine but low-control administrative change): $(0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.5)$\n- Scenario $5$ (minimal stressors, maximal control boundary case): $(0, 0, 1, 0)$\n- Scenario $6$ (maximal stressors, zero control boundary case): $(1, 1, 0, 1)$\n\nAll outputs are dimensionless. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the scenarios above. Each value must be the decimal representation of $p_{\\text{stress}}$ rounded to four decimal places (for example, `[0.1234,0.5678]`)", "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-posed mathematical modeling task grounded in the established principles of the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. All constraints and parameters are clearly defined, scientifically consistent, and sufficient to construct a unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is to translate the qualitative principles of primary and secondary appraisal into quantitative functions. The requirements for these functions—being continuously differentiable, monotonically non-decreasing, bounded on the interval $[0,1]$, and exhibiting saturation and a smooth transition—are all characteristic properties of the logistic sigmoid function. We will use this function as the building block for our model. The general form of the logistic sigmoid function is:\n$$\nS(x; k, x_0) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_0)}}\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the input variable, $k > 0$ is the gain (or steepness) parameter, and $x_0$ is the threshold (the value of $x$ at which the function's output is $0.5$).\n\n**1. Primary Appraisal Function $A_1 = f(n,u,a)$**\n\nPrimary appraisal evaluates the significance of the stressor based on its novelty ($n$), unpredictability ($u$), and ambiguity ($a$).\n\nFirst, we combine these inputs into a single scalar value using the specified convex combination with weights $w_n = 0.3$, $w_u = 0.4$, and $w_a = 0.3$. Let this combined input be $x_1$.\n$$\nx_1(n, u, a) = w_n n + w_u u + w_a a = 0.3n + 0.4u + 0.3a\n$$\nSince $n, u, a \\in [0,1]$ and the weights sum to $1$, $x_1$ is also bounded within $[0,1]$.\n\nNext, we apply the logistic sigmoid function to $x_1$ to model the appraisal process. The problem specifies a gain parameter $k_1 = 6$ and a smooth threshold at $x_{0,1} = 0.5$.\nTherefore, the primary appraisal function $A_1$ is:\n$$\nA_1(n, u, a) = S(x_1; k_1, x_{0,1}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-6((0.3n + 0.4u + 0.3a) - 0.5)}}\n$$\nThis function correctly maps the stressor characteristics to a perceived demand level in the range $[0,1]$.\n\n**2. Secondary Appraisal Function $A_2 = h(c)$**\n\nSecondary appraisal evaluates perceived coping resources, which is modeled here as a function of controllability ($c$).\n\nThe function $A_2$ is defined similarly to $A_1$. The input is the controllability $c \\in [0,1]$. The problem specifies a gain parameter $k_2 = 6$ and a threshold at $x_{0,2} = 0.5$.\nTherefore, the secondary appraisal function $A_2$ is:\n$$\nA_2(c) = S(c; k_2, x_{0,2}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-6(c - 0.5)}}\n$$\nThis function maps the level of control to a perceived resource level in the range $[0,1]$. A higher value of $c$ leads to a higher value of $A_2$, representing a stronger belief in one's ability to cope.\n\n**3. Stress Activation Probability $p_{\\text{stress}}$**\n\nThe final stress outcome, $p_{\\text{stress}}$, depends on the comparison between perceived demands ($A_1$) and perceived resources ($A_2$). Stress is more likely when $A_1$ exceeds $A_2$. We model this relationship using the difference $\\Delta A = A_1 - A_2$ as the input to another logistic sigmoid function. The range of this difference is $[-1,1]$.\n\nThe transition to a stress state naturally occurs around the point where demands equal resources, i.e., $A_1 = A_2$, or $\\Delta A = 0$. This makes $x_{0,3} = 0$ the logical threshold for this function. The problem provides a gain parameter of $k_3 = 8$.\nThe stress activation probability $p_{\\text{stress}}$ is therefore given by:\n$$\np_{\\text{stress}}(A_1, A_2) = S(\\Delta A; k_3, x_{0,3}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-8(A_1 - A_2)}}\n$$\nThis function is bounded on $[0,1]$ and increases monotonically as perceived demands ($A_1$) increase relative to perceived resources ($A_2$), consistent with the foundational principles of the Transactional Model.\n\nThese three functions will be implemented to calculate the stress activation probability for the provided clinical scenarios.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs appraisal functions and calculates stress probability\n    based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def sigmoid(x, k, x0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the logistic sigmoid function.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (float): The input value.\n            k (float): The gain or steepness of the curve.\n            x0 (float): The midpoint/threshold of the function.\n        \n        Returns:\n            float: The sigmoid function output, in the range (0, 1).\n        \"\"\"\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-k * (x - x0)))\n\n    def primary_appraisal(n, u, a, weights, gain, threshold):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the primary appraisal value A1.\n        \n        Args:\n            n, u, a (float): Novelty, unpredictability, ambiguity (0-1).\n            weights (tuple): Weights (w_n, w_u, w_a) for the inputs.\n            gain (float): The gain parameter for the sigmoid function.\n            threshold (float): The threshold for the sigmoid function.\n            \n        Returns:\n            float: The primary appraisal value A1.\n        \"\"\"\n        w_n, w_u, w_a = weights\n        combined_input = w_n * n + w_u * u + w_a * a\n        return sigmoid(combined_input, gain, threshold)\n\n    def secondary_appraisal(c, gain, threshold):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the secondary appraisal value A2.\n        \n        Args:\n            c (float): Controllability (0-1).\n            gain (float): The gain parameter for the sigmoid function.\n            threshold (float): The threshold for the sigmoid function.\n            \n        Returns:\n            float: The secondary appraisal value A2.\n        \"\"\"\n        return sigmoid(c, gain, threshold)\n\n    def stress_probability(A1, A2, gain, threshold):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the stress activation probability p_stress.\n        \n        Args:\n            A1 (float): Primary appraisal value.\n            A2 (float): Secondary appraisal value.\n            gain (float): The gain parameter for the sigmoid function.\n            threshold (float): The threshold for the sigmoid function.\n            \n        Returns:\n            float: The stress activation probability.\n        \"\"\"\n        appraisal_difference = A1 - A2\n        return sigmoid(appraisal_difference, gain, threshold)\n\n    # Define model parameters from the problem statement\n    weights_A1 = (0.3, 0.4, 0.3)\n    gain_A1_A2 = 6.0\n    threshold_A1_A2 = 0.5\n    \n    gain_p_stress = 8.0\n    threshold_p_stress = 0.0\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7),  # Scenario 1: first-time preoperative patient\n        (0.2, 0.3, 0.9, 0.2),  # Scenario 2: chronic disease with strong control\n        (0.7, 0.7, 0.4, 0.9),  # Scenario 3: ambiguous diagnosis\n        (0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.5),  # Scenario 4: low-control administrative change\n        (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0),  # Scenario 5: minimal stressors, maximal control\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)   # Scenario 6: maximal stressors, zero control\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, u, c, a = case\n        \n        # 1.
