In the HBM, the intention to act is theorized to arise from cognitive appraisals of threat (including perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) and impediments (perceived barriers), where threat appraisals contribute positively to intention and barriers reduce intention. In a validated instrument based on regression-derived scoring, the standardized weights that capture the strength of these contributions are as follows: the weight on perceived severity is $\\beta_{1}=0.4$, the weight on perceived susceptibility is $\\beta_{2}=0.3$, and the magnitude of the barrier effect is $\\beta_{3}=0.2$, with barriers reducing intention rather than increasing it. A particular patient reports perceived severity $8$, perceived susceptibility $6$, and perceived barriers $7$ on a $0$ to $10$ Likert scale. Using the standard linear index scoring approach that adds positively contributing constructs and subtracts negatively contributing constructs with the given weights, compute the patient’s intention score.

The model specifies how different cognitive appraisals contribute to this intention. Let $I$ represent the overall intention score. The contributing factors provided are perceived severity ($V$), perceived susceptibility ($S$), and perceived barriers ($B$).\n\nAccording to the problem description, the intention score is calculated using a standard linear index approach. Threat appraisals, which include perceived severity and perceived susceptibility, contribute positively to the intention score. Impediments, represented by perceived barriers, reduce the intention score. This relationship can be formalized as a weighted linear combination.\n\nThe general form of the linear index is:\n$$\nI = (\\text{weight for severity}) \\times (\\text{score for severity}) + (\\text{weight for susceptibility}) \\times (\\text{score for susceptibility}) - (\\text{weight for barriers}) \\times (\\text{score for barriers})\n$$\n\nWe are given the following standardized weights:\n- The weight on perceived severity is $\\beta_{1} = 0.4$.\n- The weight on perceived susceptibility is $\\beta_{2} = 0.3$.\n- The magnitude of the barrier effect is $\\beta_{3} = 0.2$.
