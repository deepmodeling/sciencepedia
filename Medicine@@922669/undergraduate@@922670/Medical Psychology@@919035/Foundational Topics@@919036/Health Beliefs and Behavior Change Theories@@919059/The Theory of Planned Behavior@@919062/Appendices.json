In the TPB’s expectancy-value (EV) framework, the overall evaluative attitude index is constructed from a set of salient behavioral beliefs and corresponding outcome evaluations. For a given individual, three salient outcomes have been elicited, and their belief strengths and outcome evaluations are summarized as vectors $b=[0.8,\\,0.3,\\,-0.6]$ and $e=[3,\\,1,\\,2]$, where each $e_i$ is measured on a bipolar semantic differential scale from $-3$ to $+3$ and each $b_i$ is a unitless belief strength that can be positive or negative to reflect facilitative or inhibitory expectation regarding the outcome.\n\nStarting from the following foundational principles of the EV approach, derive the general form of a valid unidimensional attitude index $A$ in terms of $b_i$ and $e_i$:\n1) Independence and additivity across outcomes: the total attitude equals the sum of contributions from each outcome.\n2) Linearity in belief strength: holding the evaluation fixed, doubling $b_i$ doubles that outcome’s contribution to the attitude.\n3) Linearity and polarity in evaluation: holding the belief strength fixed, the contribution varies linearly with $e_i$ and reverses sign if $e_i$ reverses sign.\n4) Null effects: if either $b_i=0$ or $e_i=0$, the contribution of that outcome is $0$.\n\nCalibrate the overall scale so that a single outcome with $b_i=1$ and $e_i=1$ increases $A$ by exactly $1$ unit.

This process of unifying multiple inputs into a single prediction is a core task in behavioral science [@problem_id:4756081].", "problem": "A hospital-based medical psychology team is applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to predict a patient's intention to adhere to a newly prescribed antihypertensive regimen. In the TPB, the intention construct is determined by three standardized psychological components: Attitude toward the behavior ($A$), Subjective Norm ($SN$), and Perceived Behavioral Control ($PBC$). The team has pre-specified policy weights reflecting the relative contribution of each component to intention, denoted by $w_{a}$ for Attitude, $w_{s}$ for Subjective Norm, and $w_{p}$ for Perceived Behavioral Control. All three component scores are standardized (zero-mean, unit-variance) $z$-scores so they are commensurate, and all weights are nonnegative real numbers.\n\nAssume the following foundational measurement-theoretic properties for the intention index aggregator used by the team:\n- Additive separability of component effects: holding two components fixed, changing one component changes intention independently of the others.\n- Positive homogeneity of degree one in the components: scaling all components by a positive constant $k$ scales intention by the same factor $k$.\n- Null contribution at zero: a component equal to zero contributes zero to intention.\n- Monotonicity in each component given nonnegative weights: increasing any of $A$, $SN$, or $PBC$ (with its weight held fixed and nonnegative) does not decrease intention.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the core TPB idea that intention is determined by the three components and their weights, derive the expression for the latent intention index $I$ and then compute its value for the following patient profile: $A = 1.2$, $SN = 0.8$, $PBC = 1.5$, with policy weights $w_{a} = 0.4$, $w_{s} = 0.3$, and $w_{p} = 0.5$.\n\nFor clinical decision-making, the hospital uses a discrete intention category $C$ on a $0$ to $3$ scale, where the observed category is the nearest integer to the latent index, clipped to the bounds.

The original statement does not specify the target population. This element is missing.\n2.  **Action**: What is the behavior?

The statement lacks clarity in Action and Time; the best correction is: “schedule a colorectal screening soon.”**\nThis option is a poor correction. \"Schedule\" is a different behavior than attending/completing screening. \"Soon\" is extremely vague and makes the time element worse.
