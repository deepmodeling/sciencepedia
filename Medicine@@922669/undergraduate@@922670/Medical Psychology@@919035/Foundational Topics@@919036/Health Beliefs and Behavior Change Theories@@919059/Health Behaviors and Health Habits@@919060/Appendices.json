This exercise delves into the practical challenge of quantifying medication adherence, a critical health habit for managing chronic conditions. You will compare two widely used metrics, the Medication Possession Ratio ($MPR$) and the Proportion of Days Covered ($PDC$), discovering how their subtle definitional differences can reveal different aspects of a patient's behavior and why choosing the right metric is crucial for both clinical practice and research. [@problem_id:4719867]", "problem": "A patient with hypertension is prescribed one fixed-dose pill of a single antihypertensive medication per calendar day. In medical psychology, adherence to such a daily regimen can be operationalized using the medication possession ratio (MPR) and the proportion of days covered (PDC). The observation window is $L = 120$ consecutive days, labeled $1$ through $120$, during which the patient has the following pharmacy fills within the window: day $1$ ($30$-day supply), day $25$ ($30$-day supply), day $60$ ($30$-day supply), day $95$ ($30$-day supply), and day $110$ ($30$-day supply). Assume the following rules, grounded in standard adherence measurement practice:\n- The patient consumes exactly one unit per calendar day when covered, starting on the first fill, and never more than one per day.\n- Each fill adds its entire days’ supply to inventory immediately on the fill date; inventory can be stockpiled and overlaps extend coverage forward in time.\n- The medication possession ratio (MPR) is defined as $MPR = \\frac{\\text{total days’ supply dispensed within the observation window}}{L}$ and is not capped at $1$.\n- The proportion of days covered (PDC) is defined as $PDC = \\frac{\\text{number of days within the observation window on which the patient has at least one unit available}}{L}$ and, by definition, cannot exceed $1$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the stated rules, compute $MPR$ and $PDC$ for this patient over the $L = 120$ days and, based on the definitions, interpret why these two metrics may differ numerically in this scenario. Express both $MPR$ and $PDC$ as decimals without units, and round your answers to four significant figures.", "solution": "The task is to quantify adherence behavior using two operational definitions. First, define the medication possession ratio (MPR) as\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{i}}{L},\n$$\nwhere $S_{i}$ is the days’ supply for fill $i$ occurring within the observation window and $L$ is the length of the observation window. Second, define the proportion of days covered (PDC) as\n$$\nPDC = \\frac{D_{\\text{covered}}}{L},\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{covered}}$ is the count of distinct calendar days within the observation window on which the patient has at least one unit available given daily consumption of one unit and stockpiling rules.\n\nGiven fills on day $1$, $25$, $60$, $95$, and $110$, each with $S_{i} = 30$, and $L = 120$, we proceed.\n\nStep 1: Compute $MPR$ from its definition. The total dispensed supply within the window is\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_{i} = 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 150.\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\nMPR = \\frac{150}{120} = 1.25.\n$$\nThis value is not capped by definition, so it can exceed $1$.\n\nStep 2: Compute $PDC$ by counting unique covered days under stockpiling and one-unit-per-day consumption.\n\nWe track inventory and coverage chronologically:\n\n- Fill on day $1$ adds $30$ units. With one unit consumed per day starting day $1$, these $30$ units cover days $1$ through $30$ inclusive.\n\n- Fill on day $25$ adds $30$ units when $6$ units remain from the first fill (days $25$ through $30$). Inventory becomes $36$ units on day $25$. Consuming one unit per day, these $36$ units starting day $25$ cover through day $60$ inclusive. Combined with the initial coverage, coverage is continuous from day $1$ through day $60$.\n\n- Fill on day $60$ adds $30$ units when $1$ unit remains (day $60$ itself). Inventory becomes $31$ units, and after consuming on day $60$, $30$ units remain, covering days $61$ through $90$. Coverage is continuous from day $1$ through day $90$.\n\n- There is no fill between days $90$ and $95$, so days $91$ through $94$ are uncovered. That is a gap of $4$ uncovered days.\n\n- Fill on day $95$ adds $30$ units when inventory is $0$, covering days $95$ through $124$.\n\n- Fill on day $110$ adds $30$ units during this coverage period. On day $110$, there are $15$ units remaining from the $30$ dispensed on day $95$ (since days $95$ through $109$ consume $15$ units). Inventory becomes $45$ units; after consuming on day $110$, $44$ units remain. This extends coverage continuously beyond day $124$ to day $154$. Within the observation window, this guarantees coverage from day $95$ through day $120$.\n\nCollecting covered intervals within the observation window $1$ to $120$:\n- Covered: days $1$ through $90$ ($90$ days).\n- Uncovered: days $91$ through $94$ ($4$ days).\n- Covered: days $95$ through $120$ ($26$ days).\n\nThus, the total number of covered days within the window is\n$$\nD_{\\text{covered}} = 90 + 26 = 116.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nPDC = \\frac{116}{120} = \\frac{29}{30} \\approx 0.966\\overline{6}.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Round both metrics to four significant figures as requested. For $MPR$, $1.25$ to four significant figures is $1.250$. For $PDC$, $\\frac{29}{30} \\approx 0.966666\\ldots$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.9667$.\n\nInterpretation of discrepancy: By definition, $MPR$ quantifies the amount dispensed relative to the observation window and can exceed $1$ when the patient refills early and stockpiles (as seen with fills on day $25$, $60$, $95$, and $110$). In contrast, $PDC$ counts only the fraction of days actually covered and cannot exceed $1$. The four-day gap (days $91$ through $94$) reduces $PDC$ below $1$, even though $MPR$ is elevated due to early refills and overlapping supply. Behaviorally, this pattern is consistent with a patient who occasionally misses refills or delays obtaining medication (creating gaps) but also sometimes refills early or accumulates surplus supply, inflating $MPR$ without eliminating gaps in day-to-day coverage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1.250 & 0.9667\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4719867"}, {"introduction": "Many health decisions involve a conflict between immediate gratification and long-term well-being.

However, interpreting the results of these tests can be counterintuitive. This exercise challenges you to apply Bayes' theorem to a common clinical scenario: a positive result from a screening test for a low-prevalence condition. By calculating the true probability of having the disease after a positive test, you will directly confront common cognitive biases and learn the critical skill of updating beliefs based on evidence, which is fundamental to effective risk communication and sound medical decision-making.

We begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n    $$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\n    where $P(D \\cap +)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive.\n\n2.  The numerator, $P(D \\cap +)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(+ \\mid D)$:\n    $$P(+ \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap +) = P(+ \\mid D)P(D)$$\n\n3.  The denominator, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. We can express this using the law of total probability by partitioning the event $+$ based on the disease status ($D$ or $\\neg D$):\n    $$P(+) = P(+\\cap D) + P(+\\cap \\neg D)$$\n    Using the same reasoning as in step 2 for each term, we get:\n    $$P(+) = P(+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\n\n4.  Substituting the expressions for the numerator (from step 2) and the denominator (from step 3) back into the equation from step 1, we obtain the derived formula for $P(D \\mid +)$:\n    $$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)}$$\n    This expression, a form of Bayes' theorem, is derived solely from the fundamental principles as requested.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for this scenario by substituting the given and derived probabilities into the formula:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.02)}{(0.90)(0.02) + (0.05)(0.98)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049}$$\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{18}{67} \\approx 0.2686567...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the posterior probability is $0.2687$.\n\nBased on this computed posterior probability of approximately $27\\%$, a clinician's recommendations should be carefully structured. A positive result from this screening test does not confirm the disease. Rather, it significantly increases the estimated risk from the prior probability of $2\\%$ to a posterior probability of $27\\%$. It is still more likely (a $1 - 0.2687 = 0.7313$ or $73\\%$ chance) that the patient does not have the disease and the result is a false positive.\n\nThe clinician's communication must balance urgency with reassurance to foster adaptive health behaviors without causing excessive anxiety.\n1.  **Calibrated Risk Communication**: The result should be framed not as a diagnosis, but as an updated risk assessment. The clinician should explicitly state: \"While your test result was positive, this is a screening test, not a diagnostic one. Based on this result, the chance you have the condition is about $27\\%$. This is higher than before, so we need to investigate further, but it's important to know that it is still more likely that you do not have the condition.\" Using visual aids, such as an icon array showing that out of $100$ people with a positive test like theirs, only about $27$ actually have the condition, can make this abstract probability more concrete and less frightening.\n2.  **Emphasize Confirmatory Testing**: The primary action item is to schedule a definitive diagnostic test. The screening test has successfully done its job of identifying a subgroup of the population that warrants the use of a more accurate, and often more invasive or costly, confirmatory test. Adherence to this next step is critical.\n3.  **Encourage Interim Health Behaviors**: Since the condition is chronic and benefits from early intervention, it is medically and psychologically sound to recommend low-risk, high-benefit lifestyle modifications (e.g., dietary changes, increased physical activity) in the interim. These behaviors are generally beneficial for overall health and empower the patient to take a proactive role, which can help manage anxiety while awaiting definitive results. The clinician can frame this as \"These are excellent habits for anyone to adopt, and they may be particularly helpful for you as we get a clearer picture of your health.\" This supports the formation of positive health habits regardless of the final diagnosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2687}$$", "id": "4719898"}]}
