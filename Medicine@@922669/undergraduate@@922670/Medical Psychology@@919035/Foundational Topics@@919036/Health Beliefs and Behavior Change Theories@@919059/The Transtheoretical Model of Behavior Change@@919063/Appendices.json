Individuals don't just occupy a single stage; they move between them over time, progressing, relapsing, and cycling through the process.

The five states are ordered as $1=$ Precontemplation, $2=$ Contemplation, $3=$ Preparation, $4=$ Action, $5=$ Maintenance.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information. To be a valid transition matrix for a Markov chain, the matrix $P$ must be row-stochastic, meaning all entries must be non-negative and the sum of the entries in each row must equal $1$.\n- Row $1$: $0.70 + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.00 + 0.00 = 1.00$\n- Row $2$: $0.10 + 0.60 + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.00 = 1.00$\n- Row $3$: $0.00 + 0.05 + 0.60 + 0.30 + 0.05 = 1.00$\n- Row $4$: $0.00 + 0.08 + 0.07 + 0.55 + 0.30 = 1.00$\n- Row $5$: $0.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.10 + 0.90 = 1.00$\nAll rows sum to $1$, and all entries are non-negative. The matrix $P$ is a valid row-stochastic matrix. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks for the probability of being in state $5$ (Maintenance) after $6$ months, given that the patient starts in state $2$ (Contemplation) at time $t=0$.\nThe time step of the Markov chain is specified as $3$ months. Therefore, a duration of $6$ months corresponds to $n = \\frac{6 \\text{ months}}{3 \\text{ months/step}} = 2$ time steps.\nWe are looking for the probability of being in state $5$ at step $n=2$, given the system was in state $2$ at step $n=0$. This is given by the $(2, 5)$ entry of the $2$-step transition matrix, which is $P^2$. Let $P^2_{ij}$ denote the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $P^2$. We need to compute $P^2_{25}$.\nBy the definition of matrix multiplication, the entry $P^2_{ij}$ is calculated as:\n$$\nP^2_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} P_{ik} P_{kj}\n$$\nFor our specific case, we need to compute $P^2_{25}$, so $i=2$ and $j=5$:\n$$\nP^2_{25} = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} P_{2k} P_{k5}\n$$\nThis expands to:\n$$\nP^2_{25} = P_{21}P_{15} + P_{22}P_{25} + P_{23}P_{35} + P_{24}P_{45} + P_{25}P_{55}\n$$\nThe second row of $P$ is $(P_{21}, P_{22}, P_{23}, P_{24}, P_{25}) = (0.10, 0.60, 0.25, 0.05, 0.00)$.\nThe fifth column of $P$ is $(P_{15}, P_{25}, P_{35}, P_{45}, P_{55})^T = (0.00, 0.00, 0.05, 0.30, 0.90)^T$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $P^2_{25}$:\n$$\nP^2_{25} = (0.10)(0.00) + (0.60)(0.00) + (0.25)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.30) + (0.00)(0.90)\n$$\nNow, we perform the multiplications:\n$$\nP^2_{25} = 0 + 0 + 0.0125 + 0.0150 + 0\n$$\nSumming the terms gives the final probability:\n$$\nP^2_{25} = 0.0275\n$$\nAlternatively, one can compute the state probability vector after $n=2$ steps, $\\pi^{(2)}$.\nThe initial state vector is $\\pi^{(0)} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.\nThe state vector after one step ($3$ months) is $\\pi^{(1)} = \\pi^{(0)}P$. This simply selects the second row of $P$:\n$$\n\\pi^{(1)} = (0.10, 0.60, 0.25, 0.05, 0.00)\n$$\nThe state vector after two steps ($6$ months) is $\\pi^{(2)} = \\pi^{(1)}P$:\n$$\n\\pi^{(2)} = (0.10, 0.60, 0.25, 0.05, 0.00)\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.70  0.25  0.05  0.00  0.00 \\\\\n0.10  0.60  0.25  0.05  0.00 \\\\\n0.00  0.05  0.60  0.30  0.05 \\\\\n0.00  0.08  0.07  0.55  0.30 \\\\\n0.00  0.00  0.00  0.10  0.90\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe are interested in the probability of being in state $5$, which is the fifth component of the vector $\\pi^{(2)}$, denoted $\\pi_5^{(2)}$. This is found by taking the dot product of $\\pi^{(1)}$ and the fifth column of $P$.\n$$\n\\pi_5^{(2)} = (0.10)(0.00) + (0.60)(0.00) + (0.25)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.30) + (0.00)(0.90)\n$$\nThis is the same calculation as before.\n$$\n\\pi_5^{(2)} = 0 + 0 + 0.0125 + 0.0150 + 0 = 0.0275\n$$\nThus, the probability that the patient will be in Maintenance after $6$ months is $0.0275$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0275}\n$$", "id": "4756860"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how individuals move between stages over time, we now turn to a fundamental question: what psychological factors drive these transitions?

This classification should optimize predictive validity for the outcome of behavior initiation within $30$ days. Let's denote the outcome as $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $Y=1$ is initiation and $Y=0$ is non-initiation. The classification rule is a function $f(I, S) \\rightarrow \\{\\text{Contemplation, Preparation}\\}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Decision Theory**: We need to decide whether to classify the profile $(I=1, S=0)$ as Preparation or Contemplation. The objective is to maximize predictive validity, which, under the given constraints, means minimizing the probability of misclassification. The problem states equal misclassification costs ($C_{\\text{FP}} = C_{\\text{FN}}$) and balanced base rates ($P(Y=1) \\approx P(Y=0) \\approx 0.5$).\n    -   Let '$\\text{Prep}$' be the event that a person is *truly* in a state that will lead to initiation with high probability (the 'positive' class) and '$\\text{Cont}$' be the state that will not (the 'negative' class). Our classification is an estimate of this underlying state.\n    -   A Bayes-optimal decision rule minimizes the expected loss. With equal costs and balanced base rates, this simplifies to minimizing the probability of error.\n    -   The rule is: classify as '$\\text{Prep}$' if $P(Y=1 | \\text{profile}) > P(Y=0 | \\text{profile})$, which is equivalent to $P(Y=1 | \\text{profile}) > 0.5$. If we classify a profile as Preparation, we are predicting initiation. If we classify it as Contemplation, we are predicting non-initiation.\n    -   So, the rule for classifying into Preparation should be: assign to Preparation if the probability of initiation given the profile is greater than $0.5$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Profiles using Given Principles**:\n    -   **Givens**:\n        -   (i) TTM definition: Preparation involves *imminent action* AND *some preparatory activity*. This structurally links the 'Preparation' stage to both intention ($I=1$) and preparatory steps ($S=1$).\n        -   (ii) Empirical finding: Volitional planning ($S$) predicts initiation beyond mere intention ($I$). This can be stated formally as: $P(Y=1 | I=1, S=1) > P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0)$. The information in $S$ is additive and significant.\n\n4.  **Derive the Decision Rule for the Hybrid Profile ($I=1, S=0$)**:\n    -   We need to compare the probability of initiation for different profiles. The key is the ordering of these probabilities based on the givens.\n    -   From empirical finding (ii), we have the strict inequality:\n        $$P(Y=1 | I=1, S=1) > P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0)$$\n    -   What about profiles where $I=0$? A person with no intention to act in the next $30$ days is, by definition, not in the Preparation stage. They would be in Precontemplation ($I=0, S$ is irrelevant or $0$) or perhaps Contemplation if they have longer-term intentions not captured by $I$. In any case, their probability of initiation within $30$ days is low.\n        $$P(Y=1 | I=0, S) \\ll P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0)$$\n    -   So, we have an ordering of probabilities of initiation:\n        $$P(Y=1 | I=1, S=1) > P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0) > P(Y=1 | I=0, \\text{any } S)$$\n    -   The decision threshold for our Bayes classifier is $0.5$. The profile $(I=1, S=1)$ represents the highest likelihood of initiation. This aligns with the TTM definition (i) of Preparation as requiring both intention *and* preparatory steps. It is therefore most logical to assign the label 'Preparation' to this group, implying $P(Y=1 | I=1, S=1) > 0.5$.\n    -   Now, what about $(I=1, S=0)$? This is the \"hybrid\" profile. It has intention but lacks the preparatory action. TTM definition (i) calls Contemplation \"intention without commitment.\" The absence of a preparatory step ($S=0$) is strong evidence of a lack of commitment.\n    -   The problem is to decide if $P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0)$ is greater or less than $0.5$. The empirical finding (ii) states that planning ($S$) adds predictive power *beyond* intention ($I$). This suggests that while $P(Y=1 | I=1, S=0)$ is greater than for those with no intention, it may not be high enough to cross the action threshold.\n    -   A rule that \"optimizes predictive validity\" will make the cleanest separation. Classifying $(I=1, S=1)$ as Preparation and $(I=1, S=0)$ as Contemplation creates a clear decision boundary. This rule is: classify as Preparation if and only if $I=1$ and $S=1$.\n    -   This rule aligns both with the TTM definition (i) which explicitly requires preparatory activity for the Preparation stage, and with the empirical finding (ii) that the preparatory step $S$ is a critical predictor. If we were to lump $(I=1, S=0)$ in with Preparation, we would be diluting the predictive power of that category, as we would be mixing a group with a lower probability of initiation ($I=1, S=0$) with a group with a higher probability ($I=1, S=1$). This would reduce the overall predictive validity of the 'Preparation' classification.\n    -   Therefore, to maximize the predictive separation between the stages, the optimal rule is to assign $(I=1, S=0)$ to the lower-likelihood stage, which is Contemplation. The rule is:\n        -   If $I=1$ and $S=1$, classify as Preparation.\n        -   If $I=1$ and $S=0$, classify as Contemplation.\n        -   If $I=0$, classify as Contemplation or Precontemplation (not Preparation).\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Derivation**: The optimal rule, derived from the given principles and constraints, is to require both strong intention ($I=1$) and a preparatory step ($S=1$) for a 'Preparation' classification. The hybrid profile ($I=1, S=0$) should be classified as 'Contemplation' because it lacks the volitional commitment demonstrated by taking a concrete step, which is empirically a stronger predictor of imminent action.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option against the derived rule and justification.\n\n**A. Classify as Preparation only when $I=1$ and $S=1$; classify $I=1, S=0$ as Contemplation. Justification: under the empirical ordering $P(\\text{initiation} \\mid I=1, S=1) > P(\\text{initiation} \\mid I=1, S=0)$ and equal costs, a Bayes decision rule that requires at least one preparatory step for Preparation maximizes short-term predictive validity and aligns with TTM’s volitional criterion.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option presents the exact rule and justification derived from first principles.\n    -   The rule `classify as Preparation only when I=1 and S=1` is what we found.\n    -   The rule `classify I=1, S=0 as Contemplation` is the logical consequence for the hybrid profile.\n    -   The justification correctly cites the empirical ordering of probabilities ($P(\\text{initiation} \\mid I=1, S=1) > P(\\text{initiation} \\mid I=1, S=0)$), which comes from principle (ii).\n    -   It correctly invokes the logic of a Bayes decision rule under the given constraints (equal costs, balanced base rates) to maximize predictive validity.\n    -   It correctly aligns with the TTM's core definition of Preparation requiring volitional commitment/activity (principle (i)).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Classify any $I=1$ case as Preparation regardless of $S$. Justification: motivational intention is the proximal determinant of behavior; adding $S$ does not materially improve prediction within $30$ days.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option directly contradicts the premises.\n    -   The rule `Classify any I=1 case as Preparation regardless of S` means we would classify both $(I=1, S=1)$ and $(I=1, S=0)$ as Preparation.\n    -   The justification `adding S does not materially improve prediction` is a direct negation of principle (ii) provided in the problem statement: \"well-established findings that volitional planning and implementation intentions predict short-term initiation beyond mere motivational intention\". This principle explicitly states that $S$ *does* improve prediction.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Classify as Preparation only if self-efficacy is high, irrespective of $I$ or $S$. Justification: self-efficacy dominates short-term initiation prediction; intentions and preparatory steps are secondary.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option introduces a new variable, self-efficacy, which is not part of the problem's specified inputs ($I$ and $S$).\n    -   The problem explicitly asks to formulate a rule based on the indicators $I$ and $S$. While self-efficacy is indeed a construct within TTM and other behavioral theories, the task is to work with the provided givens.\n    -   This rule ignores the primary data ($I, S$) and the core principles (i) and (ii) laid out in the problem. It proposes a solution based on information that is not available according to the problem setup.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Classify $I=1, S=0$ as Action to leverage expectancy effects. Justification: optimistic staging increases initiation probability, improving predictive validity even if present behavior has not yet changed.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option makes several errors.\n    -   First, it misidentifies the stage. The choice is between Contemplation and Preparation, not Action. The Action stage is defined by active participation in the new behavior for less than $6$ months. The patient, by definition, has not initiated yet.\n    -   Second, the justification relies on a \"Hawthorne\" or \"Pygmalion\" effect (`expectancy effects`). While such effects might exist, the problem's objective is to optimize *predictive validity* based on the patient's current state, not to create a therapeutic intervention designed to *change* that state. The goal is accurate classification, not manipulation of outcome. Claiming that mis-staging improves predictive validity is a logical contradiction. If optimistic staging changes the outcome, it invalidates the original prediction. The task is to predict, not to intervene.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Classify using decisional balance alone: if perceived pros exceed cons, mark as Preparation regardless of $S$. Justification: a favorable decisional balance is sufficient for short-term initiation; preparatory steps are not necessary for prediction.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option is similar to C in that it introduces information not provided in the problem statement.\n    -   'Decisional balance' (the balance of pros and cons) is another TTM construct, but the problem provides only indicators $I$ (intention) and $S$ (steps).\n    -   The justification `preparatory steps are not necessary for prediction` again directly contradicts principle (ii) of the problem statement.\n    -   Like option C, it fails to use the specified inputs and violates one of the explicit guiding principles.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$", "id": "4756887"}]}
