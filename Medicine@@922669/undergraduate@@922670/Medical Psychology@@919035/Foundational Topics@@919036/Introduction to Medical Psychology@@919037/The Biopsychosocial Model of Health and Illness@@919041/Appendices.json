The dependent variable, _Y_, which represents depressive symptom severity, is modeled as a function of a genetic factor _G_, a stress factor _E_, their interaction, and a stochastic disturbance term $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe specified linear model with a first-order interaction term is given by the equation:\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 (G \\times E) + \\epsilon\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ is the main effect of the genetic factor, $\\beta_2$ is the main effect of stress, and $\\beta_3$ is the coefficient for the interaction between the genetic factor and stress. The variables are defined as _Y_ (depressive symptom severity), $G \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ (genetic risk allele indicator), and _E_ (perceived stress). A critical piece of information is the mean-independence condition on the disturbance term, stated as $E[\\epsilon \\mid G, E] = 0$.\n\nThe first task is to derive the conditional expectation of _Y_ given _G_ and _E_, denoted as $E[Y \\mid G, E]$. This conditional expectation represents the predicted value of _Y_ for given values of _G_ and _E_. We start with the model equation and take the expectation conditional on _G_ and _E_:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G, E] = E[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 (G \\times E) + \\epsilon \\mid G, E]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can distribute the expectation operator across the terms:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G, E] = E[\\beta_0 \\mid G, E] + E[\\beta_1 G \\mid G, E] + E[\\beta_2 E \\mid G, E] + E[\\beta_3(G \\times E) \\mid G, E] + E[\\epsilon \\mid G, E]\n$$\nThe parameters $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3$ are constants. The variables _G_ and _E_ are the conditioning variables, so within the conditional expectation, they are treated as known constants. Therefore, for any function $f(G,E)$, we have $E[f(G,E) \\mid G,E] = f(G,E)$. Applying this property:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G, E] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 (G \\times E) + E[\\epsilon \\mid G, E]\n$$\nUsing the provided mean-independence condition, $E[\\epsilon \\mid G, E] = 0$, we substitute this into the equation:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G, E] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 (G \\times E) + 0\n$$\nThis gives the final derived expression for the conditional expectation, which is the prediction function:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G, E] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 G E\n$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the predicted symptom severity for an individual with the risk allele present ($G=1$) and a perceived stress level of $E=2$. We are given the following parameter estimates:\n- Intercept: $\\beta_0 = 10$\n- Main effect of genetics: $\\beta_1 = 2$\n- Main effect of stress: $\\beta_2 = 3$\n- Interaction effect: $\\beta_3 = 4$\n\nWe substitute these values, along with $G=1$ and $E=2$, into the derived conditional expectation formula:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G=1, E=2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(1) + \\beta_2(2) + \\beta_3(1)(2)\n$$\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G=1, E=2] = 10 + 2(1) + 3(2) + 4(1 \\times 2)\n$$\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G=1, E=2] = 10 + 2 + 6 + 8\n$$\n$$\nE[Y \\mid G=1, E=2] = 26\n$$\nThe predicted symptom severity for this individual is $26$ points.\n\nAdditionally, we are asked to interpret the sign of $\\beta_3$. The effect of stress (_E_) on the outcome (_Y_) is represented by the slope of the relationship between _E_ and _Y_. This slope is the partial derivative of the conditional expectation of _Y_ with respect to _E_:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} E[Y \\mid G, E] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 E + \\beta_3 G E) = \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 G\n$$\nFor individuals without the risk allele ($G=0$), the slope is $\\beta_2 = 3$. For individuals with the risk allele ($G=1$), the slope is $\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 3 + 4 = 7$. Since the interaction coefficient $\\beta_3 = 4$ is positive, the slope of the stress-symptom relationship is greater for risk allele carriers, which means the effect of stress on _Y_ is amplified among risk allele carriers relative to non-carriers.\n\nThe final answer required is only the single numerical prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26}$$", "id": "4751162"}, {"introduction": "The connections between mind and body are often not direct, but follow specific biological pathways. This practice allows you to trace one such pathway, demonstrating how a psychological experience like stress can lead to a physical symptom like fatigue by first altering a biological process. By calculating a standardized indirect effect, you will quantify the portion of the stress-fatigue relationship that is specifically \"mediated\" by the inflammatory marker IL-6, providing a clear example of a psychobiological mechanism.

Three standardized variables are modeled: perceived stress _S_, serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) _M_, and fatigue severity _Y_, each scaled to have mean $0$ and variance $1$. The system is linear and additive, with residuals uncorrelated with their predictors. Let _M_ be linearly regressed on _S_ with a standardized regression coefficient _a_, and let _Y_ be linearly regressed on _M_ (controlling for _S_) with a standardized regression coefficient _b_. Assume the direct effect of _S_ on _Y_ may exist but the quantity of interest is the effect transmitted solely through _M_. Using core definitions of standardized regression coefficients and mediation in linear systems, derive from first principles the standardized indirect effect on _Y_ of a one standard deviation increase in _S_ transmitted only through _M_. Then, given $a=0.4$ and $b=0.5$, compute the numerical value of this indirect effect. No rounding is required. Finally, briefly interpret the magnitude of this standardized effect in terms of how many standard deviations of _Y_ change per one standard deviation of _S_ via the biological pathway.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a standardized indirect effect within a linear mediation model, grounded in a biopsychosocial context. The model posits that perceived stress (_S_) influences fatigue severity (_Y_) via its effect on a biological mediator, serum Interleukin-6 (_M_). All variables (_S_, _M_, and _Y_) are standardized, meaning they have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.\n\nLet us formalize the system of linear equations described in the problem.\n\nThe first part of the model is the regression of the mediator (_M_) on the independent variable (_S_). Since the variables are standardized, the intercept is $0$. The equation is:\n$$M = aS + \\epsilon_M$$\nHere, _a_ is the standardized regression coefficient representing the effect of _S_ on _M_. $\\epsilon_M$ is the residual error term for _M_, with $\\text{E}[\\epsilon_M] = 0$ and $\\text{Cov}(S, \\epsilon_M) = 0$. Because the variables are standardized with variance $1$, the standardized coefficient _a_ is equal to the correlation between _S_ and _M_, $a = \\rho_{SM}$.\n\nThe second part of the model is the regression of the dependent variable (_Y_) on both the mediator (_M_) and the independent variable (_S_). This equation includes the direct effect of _S_ on _Y_, which we can denote as $c'$, and the effect of _M_ on _Y_ while controlling for _S_, which is given as _b_.\n$$Y = c'S + bM + \\epsilon_Y$$\nHere, _b_ is the standardized partial regression coefficient of _Y_ on _M_. $\\epsilon_Y$ is the residual error term for _Y_, with $\\text{E}[\\epsilon_Y] = 0$, $\\text{Cov}(S, \\epsilon_Y) = 0$, and $\\text{Cov}(M, \\epsilon_Y) = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the indirect effect of _S_ on _Y_ that is transmitted *through* _M_. This effect is the component of the total relationship between _S_ and _Y_ that is accounted for by the pathway $S \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$. To derive this from first principles, we substitute the first equation into the second equation to express _Y_ solely in terms of _S_ and the error terms.\n\nSubstituting $M = aS + \\epsilon_M$ into the equation for _Y_:\n$$Y = c'S + b(aS + \\epsilon_M) + \\epsilon_Y$$\n\nDistributing the coefficient _b_:\n$$Y = c'S + (ab)S + b\\epsilon_M + \\epsilon_Y$$\n\nGrouping the terms involving _S_:\n$$Y = (c' + ab)S + (b\\epsilon_M + \\epsilon_Y)$$\n\nThis equation expresses the total effect of _S_ on _Y_. The total standardized effect is the coefficient of _S_, which is $(c' + ab)$. This total effect is decomposed into two parts:\n1.  The direct effect, $c'$, which is the effect of _S_ on _Y_ that does not pass through _M_.\n2.  The indirect effect, $ab$, which is the effect of _S_ on _Y_ that is transmitted via the mediator _M_.\n\nThe term $ab$ represents the change in _Y_ that results from a change in _S_ acting through _M_. A one standard deviation change in _S_ is associated with an _a_ standard deviation change in _M_. This change of _a_ standard deviations in _M_, in turn, is associated with a change of $b \\times a$ standard deviations in _Y_. Therefore, the standardized indirect effect is the product of the standardized coefficient of the $S \\rightarrow M$ path (_a_) and the standardized coefficient of the $M \\rightarrow Y$ path (_b_).\n\nWe are given the numerical values for these coefficients:\n$a = 0.4$\n$b = 0.5$\n\nThe numerical value of the standardized indirect effect is the product $ab$:\n$$\\text{Indirect Effect} = a \\times b = 0.4 \\times 0.5 = 0.2$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to interpret this value. A standardized indirect effect of $0.2$ signifies that for each increase of one standard deviation in perceived stress (_S_), there is an associated increase of $0.2$ standard deviations in fatigue severity (_Y_) that occurs specifically through the pathway of its effect on serum Interleukin-6 (_M_).

We have two models predicting the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score.\n\n1.  **Baseline Biomedical Model (Model 1)**: This model includes predictors such as disease severity indices and inflammatory biomarkers. The coefficient of determination for this model is given as $R^2_{\\text{bio}} = 0.35$.\n2.  **Augmented Biopsychosocial Model (Model 2)**: This model includes all predictors from Model 1, plus additional psychosocial predictors (perceived stress, social support, and health literacy). Because it contains all the predictors of Model 1, it is a nested model structure. The coefficient of determination for this model is given as $R^2_{\\text{bps}} = 0.50$.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is defined as:\n$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nwhere $\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}$ is the residual sum of squares (the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values) and $\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total sum of squares (the sum of the squared differences between observed values and their mean). $R^2$ represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (PHQ-9 score) that is predictable from the independent variables (the predictors).\n\nThe incremental explained variance, $\\Delta R^2$, is the change in the coefficient of determination when new predictors are added to a model. It quantifies the additional proportion of variance explained by the new variables. For nested models, it is calculated as the difference between the $R^2$ of the larger (augmented) model and the $R^2$ of the smaller (baseline) model.\n\nThe formula for $\\Delta R^2$ is:\n$$\\Delta R^2 = R^2_{\\text{augmented}} - R^2_{\\text{baseline}}$$\nIn this specific context:\n$$\\Delta R^2 = R^2_{\\text{bps}} - R^2_{\\text{bio}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta R^2 = 0.50 - 0.35 = 0.15$$\nThus, the addition of the psychosocial predictors (perceived stress, social support, and health literacy) accounts for an additional $15\\%$ of the variance in the twelve-month PHQ-9 scores, over and above the variance explained by the biomedical factors alone.\n\nNext, we must discuss whether this increase plausibly justifies the added complexity of the model. This involves weighing the gain in explanatory power against the principle of parsimony.\n\nThe principle of parsimony (or Occam's razor) suggests that a simpler model is generally preferable to a more complex one, assuming they have similar explanatory power. The augmented model is more complex as it includes more parameters to be estimated. The key question is whether the gain in $R^2$ is sufficiently large to be considered meaningful, thereby justifying this complexity.\n\nAn increase in $R^2$ from $0.35$ to $0.50$ represents a substantial improvement in model fit. The psychosocial variables alone contribute a $\\Delta R^2$ of $0.15$. To put this in perspective, the incremental variance explained by the psychosocial predictors ($15\\%$) is nearly half the total variance explained by the entire set of biomedical predictors ($35\\%$). In many areas of social and health sciences, an increase of this magnitude is considered not only statistically significant but also practically and clinically meaningful.\n\nThe justification is further strengthened by the theoretical rationale of the biopsychosocial model of health. This model explicitly posits that health outcomes are a function of an integrated system of biological, psychological, and social factors.\n- The baseline model, containing only disease severity and biomarkers, represents a purely biomedical perspective. It accounts for the \"bio\" component.\n- The augmented model, by adding perceived stress (a psychological factor) along with social support and health literacy (social factors), more faithfully represents the \"psycho\" and \"social\" components of the biopsychosocial framework.\n\nThe finding that $\\Delta R^2 = 0.15$ provides strong empirical evidence supporting the biopsychosocial model's applicability to this clinical population. It demonstrates that a purely biomedical view is insufficient, leaving a significant portion of the variance in symptom severity unexplained. The psychosocial factors are not redundant; they capture unique information about the patient's experience that is critical for understanding their health outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase from $R^2 = 0.35$ to $R^2 = 0.50$ is a substantial gain in explanatory power. This gain, coupled with the strong theoretical justification provided by the biopsychosocial model, plausibly and robustly justifies the added complexity of including the psychosocial predictors.
