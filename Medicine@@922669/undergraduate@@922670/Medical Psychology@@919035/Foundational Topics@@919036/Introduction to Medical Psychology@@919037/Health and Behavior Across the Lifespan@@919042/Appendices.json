This is a standard and widely accepted methodology in behavioral genetics and related fields for partitioning phenotypic variance. The assumptions stated are the foundational tenets of this model.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides two empirical observations ($r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{DZ}}$) and a theoretical model that relates these observations to two unknown parameters ($A$ and $C$). This forms a system of two linear equations in two variables, which is well-posed and admits a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary data and assumptions are explicitly provided. The provided correlation values are internally consistent within the model's framework; for instance, $r_{\\mathrm{MZ}} > r_{\\mathrm{DZ}}$, which is expected if there is a genetic contribution, and $r_{\\mathrm{DZ}} > \\frac{1}{2}r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}$ (since $0.35 > 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3$), which suggests a non-zero contribution from the shared environment ($C > 0$).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the first principles of the classical twin study (the ACE model). The total phenotypic variance, $V_P$, of a trait is decomposed into three components: additive genetic variance ($A$), shared or common environmental variance ($C$), and nonshared or unique environmental variance ($E$).\n$$V_P = A + C + E$$\nThe problem states that the total phenotypic variance is normalized to $1$, so $V_P = 1$. Consequently, the variance components $A$, $C$, and $E$ are equivalent to the proportions of the total variance they explain. Specifically, the narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = A/V_P = A$, the shared environmental proportion is $c^2 = C/V_P = C$, and the nonshared environmental proportion is $e^2 = E/V_P = E$. The relationship is thus:\n$$h^2 + c^2 + e^2 = 1$$\nThe correlation in a trait between two members of a twin pair is given by their covariance divided by the total phenotypic variance (since the variance is the same for both twins).\n$$\\text{Corr}(\\text{Twin}_1, \\text{Twin}_2) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\text{Twin}_1, \\text{Twin}_2)}{V_P}$$\nThe covariance between twins is derived from the sources of variance they share.\n- Monozygotic (MZ) twins share $100\\%$ of their genes and $100\\%$ of their shared environment. Therefore, the covariance between MZ twins is the sum of the full additive genetic variance and the full shared environmental variance.\n$$\\text{Cov}_{\\mathrm{MZ}} = 1 \\cdot A + 1 \\cdot C = A + C$$\n- Dizygotic (DZ) twins share, on average, $50\\%$ of their segregating alleles and $100\\%$ of their shared environment. Therefore, the covariance between DZ twins is the sum of one-half of the additive genetic variance and the full shared environmental variance.\n$$\\text{Cov}_{\\mathrm{DZ}} = \\frac{1}{2} A + 1 \\cdot C = \\frac{1}{2}A + C$$\nNonshared environmental factors ($E$) are, by definition, uncorrelated between twins and thus do not contribute to their covariance.\n\nSince total variance $V_P = 1$, the theoretical expressions for the twin correlations are:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{MZ}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}_{\\mathrm{MZ}}}{V_P} = A + C$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{DZ}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}_{\\mathrm{DZ}}}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2}A + C$$\nWe are given the empirical estimates for these correlations: $r_{\\mathrm{MZ}} = 0.6$ and $r_{\\mathrm{DZ}} = 0.35$. We now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $A$ and $C$:\n$$A + C = 0.6 \\quad \\quad (1)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}A + C = 0.35 \\quad \\quad (2)$$\nTo find the estimator for $A$ (which is $h^2$), we subtract equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$(A + C) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}A + C\\right) = 0.6 - 0.35$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}A = 0.25$$\n$$A = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$$\nThus, the narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = A = 0.5$. This derivation yields the well-known Falconer's formula for heritability: $h^2 = 2(r_{\\mathrm{MZ}} - r_{\\mathrm{DZ}})$.\n\nTo find the estimator for $C$ (which is $c^2$), we substitute the value of $A$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$0.5 + C = 0.6$$\n$$C = 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1$$\nThus, the proportion of variance due to the shared environment is $c^2 = C = 0.1$. Alternatively, one can derive a general expression for $C$ by substituting $A=2(r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}-r_{\\mathrm{DZ}})$ into $C = r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}-A$, which gives $C=r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}-2(r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}-r_{\\mathrm{DZ}}) = 2r_{\\mathrm{DZ}}-r_{\\mathrm{MZ}}$. Using the given values: $C = 2(0.35) - 0.6 = 0.7 - 0.6 = 0.1$.\n\nThe problem requires a brief interpretation of the shared environment estimate. A value of $c^2 = 0.1$ indicates that $10\\%$ of the individual differences in the composite health behavior index are attributable to environmental factors that are shared by twins, such as family upbringing, socioeconomic status, and parental values regarding health. In the context of a lifespan study on an adult cohort, this relatively small proportion suggests that the influence of the early family environment on health behaviors diminishes over time. The majority of the variance is explained by genetic predispositions ($h^2 = 0.5$ or $50\\%$) and nonshared environmental factors ($e^2 = 1 - A - C = 1 - 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4$ or $40\\%$), which encompass unique life experiences, personal choices, and specific environmental exposures that are not shared between the twins. The stability of health behaviors across the lifespan appears to be more strongly governed by genetics and individual-specific experiences than by the common environment of origin.\n\nThe final numerical values must be reported to three significant figures.\n- Narrow-sense heritability, $h^2 = 0.500$.\n- Shared environmental proportion, $c^2 = 0.100$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.500 & 0.100 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4719234"}, {"introduction": "Health and behavior are not static; they evolve across our lives, influenced by age and significant life experiences.

The overall probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive, weighted by the prevalence of the respective states (having or not having the condition):\n$$P(+) = P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(+)$ into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression for the posterior probability derived from first principles:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis is the general expression derived from the definitions of conditional probability and the law of total probability.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n- $P(D) = 0.05$\n- $P(D^c) = 0.95$\n- $P(+|D) = 0.90$\n- $P(+|D^c) = 0.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.05)}{(0.90)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95)}$$\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.0475}$$\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925} \\approx 0.486486...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, gives $0.4865$.
