For a given visit cycle, a total of $N=1{,}000$ patients are screened. Let $D$ denote the event that a patient truly has a current depressive disorder and $\\bar{D}$ denote the event that a patient does not have the disorder. The screening test returns either a positive result, denoted $T^{+}$, or a negative result, denoted $T^{-}$. The clinic’s population has a known disorder prevalence of $p=0.05$, and the test’s specificity is $s=0.92$. Prevalence is defined as the long-run proportion of individuals with the disorder, so $p=P(D)$, and specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test among individuals without the disorder, so $s=P(T^{-}\\mid \\bar{D})$. A false positive occurs when the test is positive for a patient who does not have the disorder, that is, the event $T^{+}\\cap \\bar{D}$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and using only basic probability rules (for example, complements and the law of total probability), derive an expression for the expected number of false positives among $N$ screened patients and then compute its numerical value for $N=1{,}000$, $p=0.05$, and $s=0.92$.

This practice problem provides a powerful, concrete example of how a test's predictive value can plummet when it is moved from a specialized, high-prevalence validation setting to a general primary care population [@problem_id:4739896]. Working through this scenario underscores the vital importance of context in interpreting and applying diagnostic test statistics.", "problem": "A new two-item depression screening instrument was validated in a specialty mood disorders clinic where the case mix consisted largely of moderate-to-severe presentations. In that validation setting, the proportion of patients truly meeting criteria for a current major depressive episode (prevalence) was $0.60$, and the observed sensitivity was $0.90$ with specificity $0.85$. The tool is later implemented in a general primary care practice where the prevalence of current major depressive episode is $0.10$. Because the primary care population includes many milder and atypical cases, the sensitivity in primary care is expected to be $0.80$ while the specificity remains $0.85$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in the specialty clinic and in primary care.
