The final answer must be a single real-valued number.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the standardized mean difference for the differential change between the intervention (treatment) and control groups, applying the small-sample bias correction to report Hedges’ $g$. The analysis will proceed in several steps, beginning with the calculation of mean change and its variance for each group.\n\nFirst, we define the mean change score for each group. For the treatment group (subscript $T$) and control group (subscript $C$), the mean changes, $\\Delta M_T$ and $\\Delta M_C$, are the differences between the post-intervention and baseline mean scores:\n$$ \\Delta M_T = M_{T, \\mathrm{post}} - M_{T, \\mathrm{pre}} $$\n$$ \\Delta M_C = M_{C, \\mathrm{post}} - M_{C, \\mathrm{pre}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta M_T = 28 - 36 = -8 $$\n$$ \\Delta M_C = 33 - 35 = -2 $$\nA negative change indicates a reduction in stigma, as higher scores on the Perceived Devaluation–Discrimination Scale (PDD) signify greater stigma.\n\nNext, we must determine the standard deviation of these change scores. The variance of a difference between two correlated variables, say $X$ and $Y$, is given by the formula:\n$$ S_{X-Y}^2 = S_X^2 + S_Y^2 - 2 \\cdot r_{XY} \\cdot S_X \\cdot S_Y $$\nHere, $S^2$ is the variance, $S$ is the standard deviation, and $r$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the variables. We apply this to the pre- and post-test scores within each group to find the variance of the change scores ($S_{\\Delta}^2$).\n\nFor the intervention group:\n$$ S_{\\Delta, T}^2 = S_{T, \\mathrm{pre}}^2 + S_{T, \\mathrm{post}}^2 - 2 \\cdot r_T \\cdot S_{T, \\mathrm{pre}} \\cdot S_{T, \\mathrm{post}} $$\nSubstituting the provided values: $S_{T, \\mathrm{pre}} = 8$, $S_{T, \\mathrm{post}} = 8$, and $r_T = 0.60$.\n$$ S_{\\Delta, T}^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 - 2 \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 64 + 64 - 1.2 \\cdot 64 = 128 - 76.8 = 51.2 $$\n\nFor the control group:\n$$ S_{\\Delta, C}^2 = S_{C, \\mathrm{pre}}^2 + S_{C, \\mathrm{post}}^2 - 2 \\cdot r_C \\cdot S_{C, \\mathrm{pre}} \\cdot S_{C, \\mathrm{post}} $$\nSubstituting the provided values: $S_{C, \\mathrm{pre}} = 8$, $S_{C, \\mathrm{post}} = 8$, and $r_C = 0.60$.\n$$ S_{\\Delta, C}^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 - 2 \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 64 + 64 - 1.2 \\cdot 64 = 128 - 76.8 = 51.2 $$\nThe variances of the change scores are identical for both groups.\n\nThe next step is to compute the pooled standard deviation of the change scores, $S_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{pooled}}$. This standardizer represents the average variability of the change scores across both groups, weighted by sample size. The formula for the pooled variance is:\n$$ S_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{(n_T - 1)S_{\\Delta, T}^2 + (n_C - 1)S_{\\Delta, C}^2}{n_T + n_C - 2} $$\nGiven $n_T = 64$, $n_C = 64$, and $S_{\\Delta, T}^2 = S_{\\Delta, C}^2 = 51.2$:\n$$ S_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{(64 - 1)(51.2) + (64 - 1)(51.2)}{64 + 64 - 2} = \\frac{63 \\cdot (51.2) + 63 \\cdot (51.2)}{126} = \\frac{126 \\cdot (51.2)}{126} = 51.2 $$\nThe pooled standard deviation is the square root of the pooled variance:\n$$ S_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{pooled}} = \\sqrt{51.2} $$\n\nNow we can compute the standardized mean difference, often denoted as Cohen's $d$, for the differential change. The numerator is the difference between the mean changes of the two groups (the \"difference-in-differences\"), and the denominator is the pooled standard deviation of the change scores.\n$$ d = \\frac{\\Delta M_T - \\Delta M_C}{S_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{pooled}}} $$\n$$ d = \\frac{-8 - (-2)}{\\sqrt{51.2}} = \\frac{-6}{\\sqrt{51.2}} $$\n\nFinally, we apply the small-sample bias correction to convert Cohen's $d$ to Hedges' $g$. This correction is important for smaller samples, though its effect diminishes as sample size increases. The correction factor, $J$, is:\n$$ J = 1 - \\frac{3}{4(df) - 1} $$\nwhere $df$ are the degrees of freedom for the pooled standard deviation, given by $df = n_T + n_C - 2$.\n$$ df = 64 + 64 - 2 = 126 $$\n$$ J = 1 - \\frac{3}{4(126) - 1} = 1 - \\frac{3}{504 - 1} = 1 - \\frac{3}{503} $$\nHedges' $g$ is then calculated as:\n$$ g = d \\times J $$\n$$ g = \\left(\\frac{-6}{\\sqrt{51.2}}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{503}\\right) $$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$ g \\approx (-0.838525) \\times (1 - 0.005964) \\approx (-0.838525) \\times (0.994036) \\approx -0.83353 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $g = -0.834$.\n\nIn terms of clinical interpretation within medical psychology, the sign and magnitude of Hedges' $g$ are both meaningful.\nThe negative sign ($g = -0.834$) indicates that the intervention group experienced a greater reduction in the PDD score (stigma) compared to the control group. The net effect of the intervention, after accounting for changes in the control group, is a decrease in stigma. This supports the efficacy of the contact-based campaign over the brochure-based information control.\nThe magnitude of the effect is $|g| = 0.834$. By widely accepted conventions in the behavioral and medical sciences (originally proposed by Cohen for $d$), an effect size of approximately $0.2$ is considered small, $0.5$ is medium, and $0.8$ is large. An effect size of $0.834$ is therefore classified as a large effect.

This final practice delves into this complexity by introducing mediation analysis, a powerful technique for understanding *how* and *why* an intervention or explanation produces its outcome. By analyzing the data from this hypothetical vignette study [@problem_id:4747532], you will learn to identify and interpret competing causal pathways, providing a sophisticated framework for reconciling seemingly contradictory findings in stigma research.", "problem": "An experimental vignette study in medical psychology examines how causal explanations for depression influence stigma-relevant responses in the general public. Participants are randomly assigned to read a vignette that attributes a protagonist’s depressive symptoms to either a biomedical cause or a psychosocial cause. The stigma process is grounded in two well-established principles: first, attribution theory posits that perceived controllability reduces when causes are seen as less under personal control, thereby reducing blame and rejection; second, essentialist beliefs associated with biological explanations can heighten perceptions that a condition is permanent, fundamentally different, and potentially dangerous, which tend to increase social distancing. Social distance is used here as a behavioral intention proxy for discrimination. The investigators measure three constructs: blame (higher scores reflect greater moral blame), perceived dangerousness (higher scores reflect greater perceived threat), and social distance (higher scores reflect stronger desire for distance). Let $X$ denote explanation type, coded $X=1$ for biomedical and $X=0$ for psychosocial. Let $M_1$ be blame, $M_2$ be perceived dangerousness, and $Y$ be social distance. Standardized regression estimates are obtained from linear models with random assignment $X$ predicting $M_1$ and $M_2$, and a final model predicting $Y$ from $X$, $M_1$, and $M_2$. The sample size is $N=600$.\n\nThe results are:\n- Path from $X$ to blame: $a_1=-0.30$, $p0.001$.\n- Path from $X$ to dangerousness: $a_2=0.25$, $p0.001$.\n- Paths to social distance (simultaneous predictors): $b_1=0.40$ for blame, $b_2=0.35$ for dangerousness, each with $p0.001$.\n- Direct path from $X$ to $Y$ controlling $M_1$ and $M_2$: $c'=0.03$, $p=0.20$.\n\nAssume the randomization of $X$ justifies treating $X$ as exogenous and that the linear models are correctly specified. Using the core definitions of stigma components (blame as moral evaluation linked to perceived controllability, dangerousness as a stereotype that elicits avoidance, and social distance as discriminatory intent) and the standard decomposition of effects in mediation (total effect equals the direct effect plus the sum of indirect effects), which interpretation best reconciles mixed findings in the literature about whether biomedical explanations for depression reduce blame but increase social distance?\n\nA. Biomedical explanations unambiguously reduce social distance by reducing blame; because the direct effect $c'$ is not significant, the overall impact is de-stigmatizing.\n\nB. Biomedical explanations reduce blame yet simultaneously increase perceived dangerousness; the resulting indirect effects on social distance have opposite signs and similar magnitudes, largely canceling to yield an approximately $0$ total effect. This explains why some studies find increased social distance and others find decreases or null results.\n\nC. Because the direct effect $c'$ is not significant, there is no meaningful effect of biomedical explanations on social distance and mediation analysis is inappropriate.\n\nD. The positive $c'$ shows biomedical explanations inherently increase social distance regardless of mediators, implying they also increase blame, contradicting claims that they reduce blame.\n\nE. The pattern indicates full mediation solely through dangerousness; biomedical explanations increase social distance only via dangerousness, with no countervailing processes.", "solution": "The problem requires us to interpret a parallel multiple-mediator model to understand how biomedical explanations for depression ($X$) affect social distance ($Y$) through two competing mechanisms: blame ($M_1$) and perceived dangerousness ($M_2$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the specific indirect effect for each mediator path. The indirect effect is the product of the path from the independent variable to the mediator (the 'a' path) and the path from the mediator to the dependent variable (the 'b' path).\n\n1.  **Indirect Effect through Blame ($M_1$)**: The path from biomedical explanation ($X$) to blame ($M_1$) is $a_1 = -0.30$. The path from blame ($M_1$) to social distance ($Y$) is $b_1 = 0.40$.\n    $$ \\text{Indirect Effect}_1 = a_1 \\times b_1 = (-0.30) \\times (0.40) = -0.12 $$\n    This negative indirect effect indicates that biomedical explanations reduce blame, which in turn reduces the desire for social distance. This is a de-stigmatizing pathway.\n\n2.  **Indirect Effect through Dangerousness ($M_2$)**: The path from biomedical explanation ($X$) to dangerousness ($M_2$) is $a_2 = 0.25$. The path from dangerousness ($M_2$) to social distance ($Y$) is $b_2 = 0.35$.\n    $$ \\text{Indirect Effect}_2 = a_2 \\times b_2 = (0.25) \\times (0.35) = 0.0875 $$\n    This positive indirect effect indicates that biomedical explanations increase perceptions of dangerousness, which in turn increases the desire for social distance. This is a stigmatizing pathway.\n\nThe analysis reveals two significant indirect effects acting in opposite directions. This is a classic case of **inconsistent mediation** or **competitive mediation**. The de-stigmatizing effect ($-0.12$) and the stigmatizing effect ($+0.0875$) are of similar magnitude and largely cancel each other out.\n\nThe total effect ($c$) is the sum of the direct effect ($c'$) and all indirect effects:\n$$ \\text{Total Effect} = c' + (\\text{Indirect Effect}_1 + \\text{Indirect Effect}_2) = 0.03 + (-0.12 + 0.0875) = 0.03 - 0.0325 = -0.0025 $$\nThe total effect is approximately zero. This pattern—where competing underlying mechanisms nullify each other's impact on the overall outcome—perfectly explains why the literature might contain contradictory findings. Some studies might detect the blame-reduction effect, others might detect the dangerousness-increase effect, and many might find no overall effect on social distance.\n\nThis result directly supports option B, which accurately describes this complex dynamic. The other options are incorrect because they either ignore one of the mediation pathways (A, E), misinterpret the meaning of a non-significant direct effect (C), or make false logical leaps (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4747532"}]}
