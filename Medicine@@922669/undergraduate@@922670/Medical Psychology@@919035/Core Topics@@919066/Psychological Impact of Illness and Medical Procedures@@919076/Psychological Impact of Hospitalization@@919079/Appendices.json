In medical psychology, perceived pain intensity measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is understood to arise from nociceptive input modulated by cognitive-affective processes such as catastrophizing. Suppose the nociceptive source intensity (the sensory component prior to cognitive amplification) is quantified as $I_{N} = 6$ on the VAS. The patient’s Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score prior to hospitalization was $C_{0} = 12$. Due to hospitalization stressors (novel environment, disrupted sleep, loss of control), the PCS score increases by $\\Delta C = 6$ points during the inpatient period, so the current catastrophizing score is $C = C_{0} + \\Delta C$. Assume the cognitive-affective amplification factor is linear in the catastrophizing score and given by $A(C) = 1 + k C$, where $k = 0.02$.

In addition to pharmacology, psychological processes modulated by the hospital context can change pain via placebo (positive expectation) and nocebo (negative expectation) mechanisms. Define the placebo effect as an improvement in symptoms attributable to positive expectations induced by care context, and define the nocebo effect as a worsening of symptoms attributable to negative expectations. Assume the following foundational facts and modeling choices, which are widely used in medical psychology and psychophysiology research:\n\n- Expectancy formation from contextual cues is modeled by a logistic psychometric function $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}$ mapping cue intensity to the probability of an expectancy-driven response.\n- The expected value operator is linear, and zero-mean random noise around effects implies it does not contribute to the expected outcome.\n- Placebo and nocebo processes are treated as independent additive expectancy components on average, consistent with concurrent positive and negative cues jointly shaping expectations in hospitalization.\n\nLet the intensity of positive clinician communication be $x = 0.8$ (unitless, $0$ to $1$), and the intensity of negative environmental cues (e.g., alarming signage, frequent nighttime disturbances) be $y = 0.3$ (unitless, $0$ to $1$).
