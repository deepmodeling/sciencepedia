This practice delves into the crucial concept of internal consistency reliability, which tells us if the items on a scale are all measuring the same underlying construct.

All concepts—Cronbach's alpha, variance, covariance, correlation—are well-defined within this statistical framework. The provided values ($k=10$, $\\bar{r}=0.45$) are realistic for a psychometric instrument. The assumption of standardized items with unit variance is a common theoretical simplification used to derive relationships between different reliability formulas. The problem is self-contained, as the sample size $N=240$ is extraneous to the requested derivation and calculation, which depends only on the number of items and their covariance structure. No scientific principles are violated, the problem is objective, and a unique solution can be determined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\nThe core definition of Cronbach's alpha ($\\alpha$) is given by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\\sigma_{T}^{2}} \\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of items, $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$ is the variance of the $i$-th item score, and $\\sigma_{T}^{2}$ is the variance of the total test score.\n\nThe total test score, $T$, is the sum of the individual item scores, $X_i$:\n$$ T = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i $$\nThe variance of the total score, $\\sigma_{T}^{2}$, is the variance of this sum. The variance of a sum of random variables is the sum of all elements in their covariance matrix:\n$$ \\sigma_{T}^{2} = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\nThis sum can be separated into the sum of variances (the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, where $i=j$) and the sum of covariances (the off-diagonal elements, where $i \\neq j$):\n$$ \\sigma_{T}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}(X_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\nUsing the notation $\\sigma_i^2 = \\text{Var}(X_i)$, the expression is:\n$$ \\sigma_{T}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\nWe are given that the items are standardized such that each item has a variance of $1$. Thus, for all $i=1, \\dots, k$:\n$$ \\sigma_i^2 = 1 $$\nThe sum of item variances is therefore:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1 = k $$\nNext, we express the covariances in terms of correlations. The correlation coefficient $r_{ij}$ between items $X_i$ and $X_j$ is defined as:\n$$ r_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)}{\\sigma_i \\sigma_j} $$\nRearranging gives $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = r_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$. Given the standardization, $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{1} = 1$ and $\\sigma_j = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. Therefore, the covariance between any two distinct items is equal to their correlation:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = r_{ij} (1)(1) = r_{ij} $$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\sigma_T^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = k + \\sum_{i \\neq j} r_{ij} $$\nThe term $\\sum_{i \\neq j} r_{ij}$ is the sum of all off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix. There are $k(k-1)$ such elements. The average inter-item correlation, $\\bar{r}$, is the mean of all unique correlations (e.g., for $i < j$). The number of unique pairs of items is $\\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$. The sum of all off-diagonal correlations is twice the sum of the unique correlations, and can be expressed in terms of the average inter-item correlation $\\bar{r}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq j} r_{ij} = k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\nTherefore, the variance of the total score simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = k + k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i^2$ and $\\sigma_T^2$ into the original formula for Cronbach's alpha:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{k}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator for the term in the parentheses:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{(k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}) - k}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{k(k-1)\\bar{r}}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\nFactor out $k$ from the denominator of the fraction inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{k(k-1)\\bar{r}}{k(1 + (k-1)\\bar{r})} \\right) $$\nCancel the terms $k$ and $(k-1)$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k\\bar{r}}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} $$\nThis derived expression is the required closed-form for $\\alpha$ in terms of $k$ and $\\bar{r}$ under the specified standardization. This formula is also known as the Spearman-Brown prediction formula.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\alpha$ for the given instrument, where $k=10$ and $\\bar{r}=0.45$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{10(0.45)}{1 + (10-1)(0.45)} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4.5}{1 + (9)(0.45)} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4.5}{1 + 4.05} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4.5}{5.05} $$\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 0.89108910... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 0.8911 $$\nThis value of Cronbach's alpha indicates high internal consistency for the instrument. Conventionally, values of $\\alpha$ between $0.80$ and $0.90$ are considered \"good,\" suggesting that the $10$ items reliably measure the same underlying latent construct of body image disturbance.

This exercise introduces the Reliable Change Index (RCI), a powerful statistical tool that helps clinicians answer this very question.

Express your final outputs with no units.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Classical Test Theory (CTT), is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Reliable Change Index (RCI) to assess the statistical significance of a change in a patient's score on a psychological instrument.\n\nFirst, we state the fundamental axioms of Classical Test Theory (CTT). An observed score $X$ is conceived as the sum of a true score $T$ and a random measurement error $E$:\n$$X = T + E$$\nThe error component $E$ is assumed to have an expected value of zero, $E[E]=0$, and to be uncorrelated with the true score $T$.\n\nThe objective is to determine if the observed change in scores from baseline ($X_1$) to follow-up ($X_2$) is a true change or merely a result of the inherent imprecision (unreliability) of the measurement instrument. The observed scores are given as $X_1 = 85$ and $X_2 = 70$.\n\nThe RCI is defined as the observed change score divided by the standard error of the difference between the two scores, $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nTo derive the formula for $S_{diff}$ from first principles, we consider the null hypothesis ($H_0$) that no true change has occurred, i.e., the true score is the same at both time points: $T_1 = T_2$. Under this hypothesis, the observed difference is due solely to measurement error:\n$$X_2 - X_1 = (T_2 + E_2) - (T_1 + E_1)$$\nGiven $T_1 = T_2$, this simplifies to:\n$$X_2 - X_1 = E_2 - E_1$$\nThe variance of this difference, which defines $S_{diff}^2$, is given by:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = \\text{Var}(E_2 - E_1)$$\nAssuming the measurement errors at the two time points are independent, as stated in the problem, the variance of the difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = \\text{Var}(E_2) + \\text{Var}(E_1)$$\nThe variance of the measurement error, $\\text{Var}(E)$, is the square of the standard error of measurement, $S_E$. Thus, we can write:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = S_{E_2}^2 + S_{E_1}^2$$\nA standard assumption in RCI calculation is that the standard error of measurement is constant across administrations, i.e., $S_{E_1} = S_{E_2} = S_E$. This yields:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = S_E^2 + S_E^2 = 2S_E^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the standard error of the difference:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2S_E^2} = S_E \\sqrt{2}$$\nWithin CTT, the standard error of measurement $S_E$ is related to the standard deviation of the test scores ($SD$) and the test's reliability coefficient ($r$) by the formula:\n$$S_E = SD \\sqrt{1-r}$$\nThe problem provides the test-retest standard deviation $SD=10$ and test-retest reliability $r = 0.85$. Substituting the expression for $S_E$ into the equation for $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = (SD \\sqrt{1-r}) \\sqrt{2} = SD \\sqrt{2(1-r)}$$\nThis is the derived formula for the standard error of the difference used in the RCI.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = 10 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.85)} = 10 \\sqrt{2(0.15)} = 10 \\sqrt{0.30}$$\n$$S_{diff} \\approx 5.477225575$$\nNext, we compute the RCI using the observed scores $X_1 = 85$ and $X_2 = 70$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{70 - 85}{5.477225575} = \\frac{-15}{5.477225575} \\approx -2.7386127875$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$RCI \\approx -2.739$$\n\nThe final step is to classify the change. The RCI follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no true change. For a two-tailed significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical values are $Z_{\\alpha/2} = Z_{0.025}$ and $-Z_{\\alpha/2} = -Z_{0.025}$. The value of $Z_{0.025}$ from the standard normal distribution is approximately $1.96$.\nTherefore, a change is considered statistically reliable if $|RCI| > 1.96$.\n\nOur calculated RCI is approximately $-2.739$. We check the condition:\n$$|-2.739| = 2.739 > 1.96$$\nThe condition is met, so the observed change is statistically reliable.\n\nWe must now determine the direction of the change. The problem states that higher DAS$59$ scores indicate greater appearance-related distress. The score changed from $85$ to $70$, which is a decrease. A decrease in distress constitutes a clinical improvement. Since the change is both statistically reliable and represents an improvement, we classify it as a \"reliable improvement\".\n\nAccording to the classification scheme provided, the indicator variable $I$ is defined as $I=1$ for reliable improvement, $I=0$ for no reliable change, and $I=-1$ for reliable deterioration.\nOur finding corresponds to $I=1$.\n\nThe two required outputs are the numerical value of RCI ($ -2.739 $) and the indicator $I$ ($1$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2.739 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4710497"}, {"introduction": "Moving from assessment to action, this final practice puts you in the role of the clinician.

He avoids swimming despite previously enjoying it, citing anticipated judgment and staring at public pools. He endorses elevated distress with the following tasks, rated using Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS; $0$ to $100$):\n\n- Walking in a park wearing a long-sleeve shirt: $20$.\n- Rolling sleeves above elbows in a grocery store: $40$.\n- Short-sleeve shirt at a crowded cafe: $55$.\n- Standing in a community center pool lobby in short sleeves: $60$.\n- Standing on the pool deck at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $65$.\n- Entering the pool at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $75$.\n- Swimming laps at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $80$.\n- Standing on the pool deck at busy hours in short sleeves: $85$.\n- Swimming in a busy public pool without any cover: $95$.\n\nHe often considers wearing a rash guard to “cover up,” and he prefers to leave situations as soon as distress spikes.

The presentation of body image disturbance following severe burns is a well-documented clinical phenomenon. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, specifically using graded exposure, is the evidence-based, first-line treatment for anxiety-related disorders, including those involving social-evaluative fears and avoidance. The principles listed (graded hierarchy, habituation, fading safety behaviors) are core tenets of exposure therapy based on learning theory. The SUDS scale is a standard tool in this context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, rank-ordered hierarchy of feared situations with quantitative distress ratings (SUDS). It specifies a clear set of established therapeutic principles that must be used to construct the treatment plan. This allows for a determinate, unique evaluation of the provided options.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective and uses precise clinical language. It reports the patient's subjective experiences (SUDS ratings, cognitions) as data, which is appropriate for this domain, but the overall framing and the question itself are objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive a solution based on established principles of exposure therapy.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify the graded exposure plan that best adheres to the four specified principles of effective exposure-based treatment. The core mechanism of exposure therapy is to facilitate new learning (inhibitory learning) by systematically confronting feared stimuli without engaging in safety behaviors, allowing the patient to learn that the feared consequences do not occur and that the anxiety response naturally decreases over time (habituation).\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the four principles:\n1.  **Start at moderate SUDS ($40$–$60$).**\n2.  **Progress in small SUDS increments ($5$–$15$).**\n3.  **Minimize/fade safety behaviors.**\n4.  **Repeat until distress reduces (e.g., 50% drop) before advancing.**\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Sequence:** Cafe ($55$) $\\to$ Pool lobby ($60$) $\\to$ Pool deck off-peak ($65$) $\\to$ Enter pool off-peak ($75$) $\\to$ Swim laps off-peak ($80$) $\\to$ Deck busy ($85$) $\\to$ Swim busy ($95$).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** The plan begins at a SUDS level of $55$, which is squarely within the target moderate range of $40$–$60$. This is appropriate.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The plan follows the patient's SUDS hierarchy in perfect ascending order. The SUDS increments between steps are $5$, $5$, $10$, $5$, $5$, and $10$. All these increments fall within the specified \"small increments\" range of $5$–$15$ SUDS points. This is a correctly graded progression.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The plan explicitly states to \"Prohibit concealment garments at all steps.\" This directly targets and eliminates a primary safety behavior, which is crucial for therapeutic success. The implied structure of staying in the situation to achieve habituation also counters the patient's tendency to escape.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The plan specifies a clear, evidence-based criterion for advancement: \"within-session SUDS reduction by at least 50% ... on two consecutive sessions before advancing.\" This ensures mastery and robust new learning at each step before increasing the difficulty.\n\n**Verdict for A:** This option systematically and correctly applies all four of the specified principles for effective graded exposure. It represents a well-designed, evidence-based treatment plan. **Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n- **Sequence:** Starts with \"flooding\" at the highest step (SUDS $95$).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** Starting at $95$ SUDS violates the principle of a moderate start ($40$–$60$). While flooding is a therapeutic technique, it is not *graded* exposure and carries a high risk of iatrogenic harm, non-compliance, or treatment dropout, especially with a patient who is just beginning therapy.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** This is not a graded progression; it is the antithesis of one.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The instruction to \"Instruct leaving as soon as SUDS exceeds $90$\" is counter-therapeutic. This reinforces escape as a valid coping mechanism, thereby strengthening the anxiety cycle. The core of exposure is to remain in the situation until anxiety subsides naturally.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The criterion \"until the task feels 'manageable'\" is vague and subjective, unlike the quantitative 50% reduction rule.\n\n**Verdict for B:** This option violates every key principle of graded exposure therapy. It is an inappropriate and potentially harmful plan. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n- **Sequence:** Starts at SUDS $20$ (park), then jumps to SUDS $85$ (busy deck).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** A SUDS level of $20$ is too low to be therapeutically effective. Such a low-anxiety exposure does not sufficiently activate the fear structure to allow for new learning.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The jump from $20$ to $85$ is a massive, ungraded leap that violates the small increments rule. This sets the patient up for failure.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The plan explicitly mandates \"continuous concealment (rash guard)\" and to \"Maintain safety behaviors across all steps.\" This is fundamentally wrong. Safety behaviors prevent the disconfirmation of feared beliefs and must be eliminated, not encouraged.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** Requiring SUDS to fall to $0$ is an unrealistic and often unattainable standard that can stall therapy indefinitely. A significant reduction is the goal, not total elimination of a natural emotion.\n\n**Verdict for C:** This is a poorly designed plan that promotes safety behaviors and uses an improper progression, rendering it ineffective. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- **Sequence:** Starts at SUDS $40$ (grocery store), then jumps to SUDS $80$ (swim laps off-peak).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** The starting point of SUDS $40$ is appropriate and within the $40$–$60$ range.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The plan involves a jump from $40$ to $80$ SUDS, which is a $40$-point leap. This violates the small increments ($5$–$15$ SUDS) principle and is likely to be overwhelming for the patient.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** This plan actively encourages multiple safety behaviors: using paced breathing to suppress distress, taking a break (escape) when distress increases, and wearing a rash guard (concealment). All of these actions prevent the patient from learning to tolerate anxiety and disconfirm their fears.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The instruction to \"take a break outside the pool\" if distress increases is the opposite of the habituation principle. It teaches the patient to escape rather than to endure the anxiety until it naturally subsides.\n\n**Verdict for D:** Although the starting point is correct, the plan's progression is flawed, and it actively promotes multiple types of safety and avoidance behaviors that are counter-therapeutic. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only choice that constructs a therapeutic plan consistent with all the established, evidence-based principles of graded exposure therapy as outlined in the problem statement. It starts appropriately, progresses systematically, eliminates safety behaviors, and uses a proper criterion for advancement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4710511"}]}
