A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $A$ be the event that a patient has clinically significant preoperative anxiety.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the patient's screening test result is positive.\nLet $A^c$ be the complement of $A$, representing the event that a patient does not have clinically significant anxiety.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\n\n$1$. The base rate, or pretest probability (prevalence), of anxiety is $P(A) = 0.05$.\nFrom this, the probability that a randomly selected patient does not have anxiety is $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n\n$2$. The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the patient has the condition. In our notation, this is the conditional probability:\n$$P(T^+ | A) = 0.90$$\n\n$3$. The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the patient does not have the condition. Let $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result. The specificity is:\n$$P(T^- | A^c) = 0.95$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test probability that the patient has anxiety given a positive test result. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(A | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the specified constraints, we must use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result in this population. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which allows us to express $P(T^+)$ by conditioning on whether the patient has anxiety ($A$) or not ($A^c$):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | A) P(A) + P(T^+ | A^c) P(A^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need the value of $P(T^+ | A^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test for a patient who does not have anxiety (the false positive rate). We are given the specificity, $P(T^- | A^c)$. Since a test result can only be positive or negative for a person without anxiety, we have:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) + P(T^- | A^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) = 1 - P(T^- | A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow we can compute $P(T^+)$ by substituting the known values into the law of total probability formula:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.045 + 0.0475$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0925$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all the calculated and given values into Bayes' theorem to find the desired post-test probability, $P(A | T^+)$:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.05)}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.486486486...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant digit is $8$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.4865$$\n\nThus, the post-test probability that a patient who screens positive actually has clinically significant preoperative anxiety is approximately $0.4865$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4865}\n$$", "id": "4739485"}, {"introduction": "After implementing a psychological intervention, how do we measure its real-world impact?
