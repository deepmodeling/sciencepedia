{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental skill in medical psychology is the ability to accurately diagnose psychological conditions in patients who are also managing chronic physical illnesses. This task is often complex because the symptoms of a medical condition, like fatigue or cognitive changes in multiple sclerosis, can overlap with symptoms of a mental health disorder like depression. This exercise challenges you to act as a clinician, applying formal diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5-TR and interpreting data from standardized questionnaires to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis for a patient with a complex presentation [@problem_id:4733253].", "problem": "A $45$-year-old software engineer with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, diagnosed $1$ year ago, presents to a behavioral medicine clinic. Over the last $6$ weeks, he reports nearly daily low mood and marked loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities (e.g., cycling, gaming). He describes pervasive feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt about being a “burden,” difficulty concentrating on code reviews, noticeable psychomotor slowing observed by his spouse, early morning awakening at approximately $04{:}00$, and passive thoughts that “it would be easier not to wake up,” without plan or intent. He endorses chronic fatigue, which he attributes partially to multiple sclerosis, and denies recent corticosteroid courses in the last $3$ months, substance use, or manic/hypomanic symptoms. Physical examination and recent laboratory tests show stable neurologic status and no thyroid dysfunction.\n\nHe also reports pronounced illness uncertainty about the unpredictability of relapses. He spends $1$ to $2$ hours per day reading online forums about prognosis and messages his neurologist approximately every $2$ weeks for reassurance. He has begun avoiding long-term commitments because he “cannot plan around this disease.” These worries began about $6$ weeks ago and fluctuate with symptom days. At work, he has missed deadlines and taken $5$ sick days in the past month.\n\nOn standardized measures, his Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score is $18$, his Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Depression subscale (HADS-D) score is $11$, and his Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score is $6$. He denies excessive preoccupation with minor bodily sensations prior to diagnosis and reports that his current physical symptoms are consistent with his known disease course.\n\nUsing core diagnostic definitions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and widely used measurement-based care thresholds (e.g., PHQ-9, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), apply evidence-based decision rules to classify the most appropriate primary diagnosis that best accounts for his current presentation.

It accurately depicts a common comorbidity (depression in MS) and references standard diagnostic manuals (DSM-5-TR) and validated assessment tools (PHQ-9, HADS, GAD-7).\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed, asking for the \"most appropriate primary diagnosis,\" a standard task in clinical differential diagnosis. Sufficient information is provided to apply the diagnostic criteria and arrive at a logical conclusion.\n-   **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical, detailing symptoms, behaviors, and test scores without subjective bias.\n\nThe problem is free of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is a valid, well-structured problem in clinical reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Diagnostic Analysis\n\nThe task is to perform a differential diagnosis and identify the single best-fitting diagnosis for the patient's presentation.\n\n**Analysis of a Major Depressive Episode (MDE)**\n\nThe DSM-5-TR criteria for MDE require at least five of the following nine symptoms during the same $2$-week period, with at least one being depressed mood or anhedonia.\n1.  **Depressed mood:** Present (\"nearly daily low mood\").\n2.  **Anhedonia:** Present (\"marked loss of interest\").\n3.  Weight/appetite change: Not mentioned.\n4.  **Sleep disturbance:** Present (\"early morning awakening at approximately $04{:}00$\").\n5.  **Psychomotor agitation/retardation:** Present (\"noticeable psychomotor slowing\").\n6.  **Fatigue/loss of energy:** Present (\"chronic fatigue\"). While this symptom overlaps with MS, its presence within a cluster of other mood symptoms allows it to be counted towards the MDE criteria.\n7.  **Feelings of worthlessness/guilt:** Present (\"pervasive feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt\").\n8.  **Diminished concentration:** Present (\"difficulty concentrating\"). This also overlaps with MS, but contributes to the depressive syndrome.\n9.  **Suicidal ideation:** Present (\"passive thoughts that 'it would be easier not to wake up'\").\n\nThe patient exhibits at least $7$ of the $9$ criteria for an MDE. The duration is $6$ weeks, which exceeds the $2$-week minimum. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress and impairment (e.g., missed deadlines, $5$ sick days). Alternative causes like substance use, medication effects (corticosteroids), or other medical conditions (thyroid dysfunction) have been ruled out. Although some symptoms overlap with MS, the full constellation of severe mood, cognitive, and neurovegetative symptoms is not explained by the direct pathophysiology of a \"stable\" MS course and is indicative of a distinct, comorbid depressive disorder.\n\nFurthermore, the standardized measures strongly support this diagnosis:\n-   A PHQ-9 score of $18$ indicates \"moderately severe depression\" (thresholds: $5-9$ mild, $10-14$ moderate, $15-19$ moderately severe, $20-27$ severe).\n-   A HADS-D score of $11$ indicates a \"probable case of depression\" (thresholds: $0-7$ normal, $8-10$ borderline, $11-21$ case). The HADS is specifically designed to be less sensitive to somatic symptoms of physical illness, making this score particularly significant.\n\nBased on this evidence, a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode is strongly supported.\n\n**Evaluation of Other Options**\n\n-   **Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood:** According to DSM-5-TR, this diagnosis cannot be given if the criteria for another mental disorder, such as Major Depressive Disorder, are met. Since the patient's symptom profile and severity meet the full criteria for an MDE, Adjustment Disorder is an incorrect, less specific diagnosis.\n\n-   **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** The core of this disorder is excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms. The vignette explicitly states the patient \"reports that his current physical symptoms are consistent with his known disease course,\" which argues against this diagnosis. His distress is primarily from the mood syndrome and anxiety about the future, not from a catastrophic interpretation of his current physical sensations.\n\n-   **Illness Anxiety Disorder:** This involves preoccupation with having or acquiring an illness, typically with no or only mild somatic symptoms. While the patient has preoccupying worries about his MS, these are occurring within the context of a severe depressive episode. The depressive cognitions (hopelessness, worthlessness) provide a better explanation for the anxiety than a primary anxiety disorder. His PHQ-9 score ($18$) is substantially higher and more clinically severe than his GAD-7 score ($6$), pointing to depression as the primary process.\n\n-   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** This diagnosis requires excessive worry about multiple topics for at least $6$ months. The patient's reported increase in worry has a duration of only $6$ weeks, failing the chronicity criterion. Additionally, his GAD-7 score of $6$ is in the \"mild\" range and below the commonly used clinical cutoff (e.g., $\\geq 10$).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe patient's clinical presentation—including the specific symptom cluster, severity, duration, functional impairment, and standardized test scores—is most accurately and comprehensively captured by the diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode, which occurs comorbidly with his multiple sclerosis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Evaluation\n**A. Major Depressive Episode comorbid with multiple sclerosis**\n-   **Justification:** The patient meets at least $7$ of the $9$ DSM-5-TR criteria for MDE. The symptoms have been present for $6$ weeks and cause significant impairment. Objective scores ($PHQ-9=18$, $HADS-D=11$) confirm a moderately severe depressive syndrome. This diagnosis comprehensively explains the entire clinical picture better than any other option.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood**\n-   **Justification:** This diagnosis is precluded because the full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode are met. Adjustment Disorder is a residual category for distress that does not meet the threshold for a more specific disorder.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Somatic Symptom Disorder**\n-   **Justification:** The patient's focus is not on his physical symptoms being unusually severe or unexplained, but rather on his mood and anxiety surrounding a known illness. The vignette states his perception of symptoms is consistent with his MS, arguing against this diagnosis.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Illness Anxiety Disorder**\n-   **Justification:** The patient's illness-related anxiety is occurring in the context of, and is better explained by, a severe Major Depressive Episode. Depression is the more prominent and severe diagnosis.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Generalized Anxiety Disorder**\n-   **Justification:** The patient does not meet the $6$-month duration criterion for GAD. Additionally, his anxiety symptom score on the GAD-7 ($6$) is only mild and does not suggest a primary anxiety disorder of this type.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4733253"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, a crucial aspect of supporting patients is communicating information about risks and treatments in a way that facilitates informed decision-making. However, the way information is framed can dramatically alter how it is perceived. This practice explores the well-documented cognitive bias known as \"denominator neglect,\" where individuals may focus more on the number of people affected by a risk than the overall group size [@problem_id:4733480]. By analyzing how different presentations of the exact same probability can influence a patient's perceived risk and their likely adherence to treatment, you will gain insight into the powerful psychological principles that govern health communication.", "problem": "A clinician is counseling a patient with a chronic illness about adhering to a daily regimen that reduces the risk of a serious complication over the next year. The clinician estimates the baseline annual risk of the complication without adherence as $p = 0.02$. In two different visits, the clinician communicates this same risk using two equivalent frequency formats: “$2$ in $100$” and “$20$ in $1000$.”\n\nUse the following foundational bases to reason about both the quantitative and psychological aspects of the scenario:\n\n- By the definition of probability, two frequency statements that reduce to the same ratio represent the same event likelihood (that is, if $a/b = c/d$, then the probabilities are equal).\n- In medical decision making, a simple expected-benefit reasoning holds: if the perceived likelihood of an adverse outcome without treatment increases, the perceived benefit of adherence increases, which tends to increase the probability of adherence, all else equal.\n- In well-documented cognitive processing of risk, some patients, especially those with lower numeracy, exhibit “denominator neglect” or “ratio bias,” overweighting the numerator (e.g., the number of events, $a$) relative to the denominator ($b$) when interpreting $a$ in $b$. Patients with higher numeracy are more likely to use the ratio $a/b$ veridically.\n\nQuestion: Which option best characterizes (i) the computed change in risk when moving from “$2$ in $100$” to “$20$ in $1000$”, (ii) the likely change in perceived risk under numerator-focused processing (state the multiplicative change using the numerators), and (iii) the expected impact of this format change on adherence for lower versus higher numeracy patients?\n\nA. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$) because $2/100 = 20/1000 = 0.02$. Under numerator-focused processing, the perceived risk increases by a factor of $10$ (from $2$ to $20$). This increase in perceived risk is likely to increase adherence among lower numeracy patients, while higher numeracy patients will show little to no change in adherence.\n\nB. The normative risk increases by $0.018$ (from $0.002$ to $0.02$). Under numerator-focused processing, the perceived risk is unchanged because both statements are frequencies. Adherence should be unchanged regardless of numeracy.\n\nC. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$). Under numerator-focused processing, the larger denominator in “$20$ in $1000$” makes the risk seem smaller, decreasing perceived risk and lowering adherence for lower numeracy patients; higher numeracy patients will also show decreased adherence due to the larger denominator.\n\nD. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$). Under numerator-focused processing, both lower and higher numeracy patients experience increased perceived risk and increased adherence with “$20$ in $1000$,” because frequency formats generally produce more affective impact, independent of numeracy.", "solution": "The problem is first validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Baseline annual risk: $p = 0.02$.\n- First risk format: \"$2$ in $100$\".\n- Second risk format: \"$20$ in $1000$\".\n- Foundational Basis 1 (Probability): If $a/b = c/d$, the probabilities are equal.\n- Foundational Basis 2 (Decision Making): Increased perceived risk of an adverse outcome leads to increased perceived benefit of adherence, which tends to increase adherence.\n- Foundational Basis 3 (Cognitive Processing): Lower numeracy patients may exhibit \"denominator neglect,\" overweighting the numerator $a$ in \"$a$ in $b$\". Higher numeracy patients are more likely to interpret the ratio $a/b$ veridically.\n- The question asks to characterize: (i) the normative change in risk, (ii) the change in perceived risk under numerator-focused processing, and (iii) the impact on adherence for lower versus higher numeracy patients.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is built on established principles from probability theory (definition of probability), decision theory (expected benefit), and cognitive psychology (heuristics and biases, specifically denominator neglect). These are well-documented phenomena in the study of risk perception and medical decision-making.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and premises to deduce a unique conclusion. The initial conditions ($p=0.02$, the two formats), the models of cognition (normative vs. numerator-focused), and the link to behavior (adherence) are clearly specified.\n3.  **Consistency and Clarity**: The premises are internally consistent. The two frequency formats, $2/100$ and $20/1000$, are both mathematically equal to the stated baseline risk, $p = 0.02$. The terminology is defined and used precisely.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution can be derived by applying the given foundational bases.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe question requires a three-part analysis based on the provided principles.\n\n**(i) Computed change in risk under normative interpretation:**\nA normative interpretation relies on the mathematical definition of probability. The first risk format, \"$2$ in $100$\", corresponds to a probability $p_1 = 2/100 = 0.02$. The second risk format, \"$20$ in $1000$\", corresponds to a probability $p_2 = 20/1000 = 0.02$. The change in normative risk, $\\Delta p$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta p = p_2 - p_1 = 0.02 - 0.02 = 0 $$\nAs per Foundational Basis 1, the two frequency statements represent the same event likelihood. Thus, there is no change in the objective, normative risk.\n\n**(ii) Likely change in perceived risk under numerator-focused processing:**\nThis part requires applying Foundational Basis 3, which describes \"denominator neglect.\" An individual exhibiting this cognitive bias overweights the numerator of the frequency.\n- For the \"$2$ in $100$\" format, the numerator is $a_1 = 2$.\n- For the \"$20$ in $1000$\" format, the numerator is $a_2 = 20$.\nUnder this model, the perceived magnitude of the risk is driven by the numerator. The change in the numerator is from $2$ to $20$. The multiplicative change is the ratio of the second numerator to the first:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 $$\nTherefore, for a patient exhibiting numerator-focused processing, the perceived risk increases by a factor of $10$.\n\n**(iii) Expected impact on adherence for lower versus higher numeracy patients:**\nThis part synthesizes the previous findings with Foundational Bases 2 and 3.\n- **Lower numeracy patients:** According to Basis 3, these patients are more likely to exhibit denominator neglect. As established in (ii), this leads to a significant increase in their perceived risk (by a factor of $10$). According to Basis 2, this increased perceived risk of the adverse outcome will increase the perceived benefit of adherence, which is expected to increase their probability of adherence.\n- **Higher numeracy patients:** According to Basis 3, these patients are more likely to use the ratio $a/b$ veridically. As established in (i), they will recognize that $2/100 = 20/1000$. Their perceived risk will not change. Consequently, the perceived benefit of adherence will not change, and their probability of adherence is expected to show little to no change.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$) because $2/100 = 20/1000 = 0.02$. Under numerator-focused processing, the perceived risk increases by a factor of $10$ (from $2$ to $20$). This increase in perceived risk is likely to increase adherence among lower numeracy patients, while higher numeracy patients will show little to no change in adherence.**\n- Part (i): Correct. States $\\Delta p = 0$ for the correct reason.\n- Part (ii): Correct. Identifies the $10$-fold increase in perceived risk based on the numerators $2$ and $20$.\n- Part (iii): Correct. Accurately describes the differential impact on adherence for lower vs. higher numeracy patients, consistent with all three foundational bases.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The normative risk increases by $0.018$ (from $0.002$ to $0.02$). Under numerator-focused processing, the perceived risk is unchanged because both statements are frequencies. Adherence should be unchanged regardless of numeracy.**\n- Part (i): Incorrect. The normative risk does not change. The calculation is flawed; it incorrectly posits an initial risk of $0.002$ which does not correspond to the \"$2$ in $100$\" format.\n- Part (ii): Incorrect. This statement contradicts Foundational Basis 3 (denominator neglect).\n- Part (iii): Incorrect. This contradicts Basis 3 by claiming no difference in effect based on numeracy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$). Under numerator-focused processing, the larger denominator in “$20$ in $1000$” makes the risk seem smaller, decreasing perceived risk and lowering adherence for lower numeracy patients; higher numeracy patients will also show decreased adherence due to the larger denominator.**\n- Part (i): Correct. States $\\Delta p = 0$.\n- Part (ii): Incorrect. This statement describes the opposite of \"denominator neglect.\" It suggests a \"denominator focus,\" which is not the phenomenon described in the problem's premises. The premise is that the numerator is overweighted, leading to a higher, not lower, perceived risk.\n- Part (iii): Incorrect. The conclusion of lowered adherence is based on the flawed reasoning in part (ii). The claim that higher numeracy patients are also affected in this way is contrary to the premise that they interpret a ratio veridically.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. There is no normative change in risk ($\\Delta p = 0$). Under numerator-focused processing, both lower and higher numeracy patients experience increased perceived risk and increased adherence with “$20$ in $1000$,” because frequency formats generally produce more affective impact, independent of numeracy.**\n- Part (i): Correct. States $\\Delta p = 0$.\n- Part (ii)/(iii): Incorrect. This option claims that both patient groups are affected equally. This directly contradicts Foundational Basis 3, which explicitly states that higher numeracy patients are more likely to process the risk information veridically (i.e., see no change), distinguishing them from lower numeracy patients. The reasoning about \"affective impact\" is an external concept not specified in the problem's foundational bases, which require a distinction based on numeracy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the problem's stated principles, only option A correctly characterizes all three aspects of the question.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4733480"}, {"introduction": "To develop effective interventions, psychologists must first understand the factors that contribute to better or worse outcomes for people living with chronic illness.

Coping strategies were measured via validated subscales and standardized to $z$-scores: problem-focused coping $C_{p}$, emotion-focused coping $C_{e}$, and avoidant coping $C_{a}$. Illness severity was indexed by a composite clinical score $S$, also standardized to a $z$-score. Consistent with well-tested findings in medical psychology on psychological adjustment to chronic illness, assume the following generative structure: HRQoL is modeled as a linear function of coping strategies and illness severity plus a random error term, with the error having zero mean conditional on the predictors. This corresponds to the foundational definition of linear regression as a model for conditional expectation.\n\nYou are given that, in a large training dataset from the same population, the following regression parameters were estimated (expressed in HRQoL score points per one standard deviation change of the predictor): intercept $\\beta_{0} = 50$, main effects $\\beta_{p} = 5$ for $C_{p}$, $\\beta_{e} = 2$ for $C_{e}$, $\\beta_{a} = -6$ for $C_{a}$, $\\beta_{s} = -8$ for $S$, and one theoretically motivated interaction capturing the attenuation of problem-focused benefits in the presence of avoidant coping, $\\beta_{pa} = -3$ for the product $C_{p}C_{a}$.

The calculated value $20.59$ already has four significant figures.\nThe difference in expected HRQoL is $20.59$ score points.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20.59}\n$$", "id": "4733336"}]}
