In a laboratory task rooted in Signal Detection Theory (SDT), participants view ambiguous symptom descriptions and decide whether each indicates a serious illness (\"ill\") or not (\"not ill\"). For one participant characterized by elevated health anxiety, the observed hit rate is $H=0.80$ (probability of saying \"ill\" when the symptom truly indicates serious illness) and the observed false alarm rate is $F=0.40$ (probability of saying \"ill\" when the symptom does not indicate serious illness).\n\nAssume the equal-variance Gaussian model of Signal Detection Theory, where the evidence under \"signal\" (serious illness present) and \"noise\" (serious illness absent) is normally distributed with equal variance, and the decision is based on a fixed criterion on this evidence axis.

Signal Detection Theory is a fundamental framework in psychology and related fields used to quantify the ability to discern between signal and noise. The equal-variance Gaussian model is the most common instantiation of this theory. The provided hit and false alarm rates are plausible values. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($H$, $F$, and the model) to calculate the requested parameters ($d'$ and $c$). The definitions and tasks are standard within this framework. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe equal-variance Gaussian model of Signal Detection Theory assumes that evidence for \"noise\" (illness absent) and \"signal\" (illness present) are drawn from two normal distributions with the same variance, $\\sigma^2$. By convention, we can standardize these distributions by setting the mean of the noise distribution to $0$ and the common standard deviation to $1$. The mean of the signal distribution is then located at $d'$.\n-   Noise Distribution, $N$: $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_N=0, \\sigma=1)$\n-   Signal Distribution, $SN$: $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{SN}=d', \\sigma=1)$\n\nA participant establishes a decision criterion, let's call its location on the evidence axis $\\lambda$. If the perceived evidence is greater than $\\lambda$, the response is \"ill\"; otherwise, the response is \"not ill\".\n\nThe false alarm rate, $F$, is the probability of responding \"ill\" when the stimulus is noise. This corresponds to the area under the noise distribution to the right of the criterion $\\lambda$.\n$$F = P(\\text{response=\"ill\"}|\\text{stimulus=\"not ill\"}) = \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\infty} f(x|N) dx$$\nLet $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the CDF of the standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Then $F = 1 - \\Phi(\\lambda)$. The problem defines $z(\\cdot)$ as the inverse CDF, so $z(p) = \\Phi^{-1}(p)$.\nFrom $F = 1 - \\Phi(\\lambda)$, we get $\\Phi(\\lambda) = 1 - F$. Applying the inverse CDF gives $\\lambda = z(1 - F)$. Due to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, $z(1 - F) = -z(F)$. Therefore, the criterion location is given by:\n$$\\lambda = -z(F)$$\n\nThe hit rate, $H$, is the probability of responding \"ill\" when the stimulus is a signal. This is the area under the signal distribution to the right of $\\lambda$.\n$$H = P(\\text{response=\"ill\"}|\\text{stimulus=\"ill\"}) = \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\infty} f(x|SN) dx$$\nTo evaluate this integral with respect to the standard normal CDF, we standardize the variable by subtracting the mean of the signal distribution, $d'$.\n$$H = 1 - \\Phi(\\lambda - d')$$\nRearranging and applying the inverse CDF gives $\\lambda - d' = z(1 - H)$. Using the symmetry property again, $z(1 - H) = -z(H)$.\n$$\\lambda - d' = -z(H)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations to solve for $d'$ and $\\lambda$:\n1.  $\\lambda = -z(F)$\n2.  $\\lambda - d' = -z(H)$\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into (2):\n$$-z(F) - d' = -z(H)$$\nSolving for the sensitivity index $d'$ yields:\n$$d' = z(H) - z(F)$$\n\nThe decision criterion parameter, $c$, quantifies the observer's response bias. It is defined as the distance of the criterion $\\lambda$ from the unbiased point, which lies halfway between the means of the two distributions (at $d'/2$). A standard definition for $c$ which captures this is:\n$$c = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(z(H) + z(F)\\right)$$\nA value of $c=0$ indicates no bias. A positive value ($c > 0$) signifies a conservative bias (a tendency to say \"not ill\"). A negative value ($c  0$) signifies a liberal bias (a tendency to say \"ill\").\n\n### Calculation\nGiven the values $H=0.80$ and $F=0.40$, we must find the corresponding z-scores. Using standard statistical tables or a calculator for the inverse normal CDF, $z(\\cdot)$:\n$$z(H) = z(0.80) \\approx 0.841621$$\n$$z(F) = z(0.40) \\approx -0.253347$$\n\nNow, we compute $d'$:\n$$d' = z(0.80) - z(0.40) \\approx 0.841621 - (-0.253347) = 1.094968$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $d' \\approx 1.095$.\n\nNext, we compute $c$:\n$$c = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(z(0.80) + z(0.40)\\right) \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(0.841621 + (-0.253347)\\right)$$\n$$c \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(0.588274\\right) = -0.294137$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c \\approx -0.2941$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe computed value for the decision criterion is $c \\approx -0.2941$. Since $c  0$, the participant exhibits a liberal decision bias. This means the criterion is set lower than the neutral point, indicating a greater willingness to classify a symptom as \"ill\". This aligns with the description of a participant with elevated health anxiety, who might be predisposed to interpret ambiguous stimuli as signs of illness.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.095  -0.2941\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4719538"}, {"introduction": "Receiving a medical test result is a critical moment where belief meets evidence.

However, the effectiveness of an intervention can be presented in many ways, each with a different psychological impact.

Your explanation should reference how quantitative frames differentially influence perceived severity, controllability, and anticipated emotional response, and why individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty may be particularly sensitive to these frames.\n\nProvide your final numeric results for part 1 in a single row matrix, in the order $\\text{ARR}$ then $\\text{NNT}$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard problem in clinical epidemiology coupled with a request for a theoretical explanation from medical psychology, using established models and definitions. All necessary data are provided for a unique solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) and Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n\nLet $P_C$ be the baseline one-year event probability in the usual-care (control) group and $P_I$ be the event probability in the intervention group.\nFrom the problem statement givens:\n$P_C = 5\\% = 0.05$\n\nThe relative risk reduction (RRR) is given as $50\\%$, or $0.50$. The definition provided is that RRR is the proportionate decrease in event probability relative to the baseline probability. This is formalized as:\n$$ \\text{RRR} = \\frac{P_C - P_I}{P_C} $$\nWe can use this equation to solve for $P_I$, the event probability in the intervention group.\n$$ P_C - P_I = \\text{RRR} \\times P_C $$\n$$ P_I = P_C - (\\text{RRR} \\times P_C) = P_C (1 - \\text{RRR}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P_I = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.05 \\times 0.50 = 0.025 $$\nSo, the event probability in the intervention group is $2.5\\%$.\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The problem defines ARR as the difference in event probabilities between the usual-care and intervention groups:\n$$ \\text{ARR} = P_C - P_I $$\nSubstituting the values for $P_C$ and $P_I$:\n$$ \\text{ARR} = 0.05 - 0.025 = 0.025 $$\nThe problem requires this to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures, which is $0.0250$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number needed to treat (NNT). The NNT is defined as the count of individuals who must receive the intervention for one additional individual to avoid the event. This is the statistical expectation, and from first principles, it is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. The ARR represents the average number of events prevented per person treated. Therefore, the number of people one must treat to prevent one event is its inverse:\n$$ \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of ARR:\n$$ \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.025} = 40 $$\nThe problem requires this to be expressed as a pure count rounded to three significant figures, which is $40.0$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of Framing Effects on Illness Perception and Health Anxiety**\n\nThe way in which quantitative information about treatment benefits is framed can profoundly alter patient perceptions and emotional responses, a phenomenon well-documented in behavioral science. This can be explained through the integration of framing effects with the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM). The CSM posits that individuals build mental representations (illness perceptions) of health threats to guide coping, encompassing dimensions such as perceived severity, controllability (both personal and treatment-related), and emotional representations (e.g., health anxiety).\n\n1.  **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**: Presenting the benefit as a $50\\%$ RRR leverages a framing effect known as ratio bias. The number $50\\%$ appears large and impactful, even though the absolute change in risk is small. This frame tends to inflate the perceived efficacy of the intervention.\n    -   **Influence on CSM Constructs**: This inflated perception directly enhances the **perceived controllability** of the condition through treatment. A highly effective treatment makes the health threat seem more manageable, which can, in turn, reduce its **perceived severity** and dampen the negative **anticipated emotional response**, such as health anxiety. The message is one of potency and control.\n\n2.  **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**: Presenting the benefit as an ARR of $2.5\\%$ (or a change from $5\\%$ to $2.5\\%$) provides a more sober and less psychologically magnified perspective. The number is numerically smaller than the RRR.\n    -   **Influence on CSM Constructs**: This frame offers a more modest appraisal of **treatment controllability**. While still positive, the benefit may seem less dramatic, leading to a less pronounced reduction in anxiety compared to the RRR frame. The perception of benefit is more calibrated to the actual statistical reality.\n\n3.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**: Presenting the benefit as an NNT of $40$ reframes the efficacy from an individual probability to a population frequency. It communicates that for every one person who benefits, $39$ people receive the treatment without preventing an event in them over that time period.\n    -   **Influence on CSM Constructs**: This frame can undermine **perceived personal controllability**. The patient may think, \"There is only a $1$-in-$40$ chance this will be the intervention that helps *me* specifically,\" making the benefit feel remote and uncertain. This uncertainty can amplify the **anticipated negative emotional response**, increasing health anxiety because the path to a positive outcome appears less direct. It highlights the inefficiency of the treatment at the individual level, even if it is effective at the population level.\n\n**The Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU)**: Individuals with high IU have a strong aversion to ambiguity and uncertainty. For these individuals, the different frames are not just alternative perspectives but can be sources of either comfort or distress.\n-   The RRR frame, with its large, confidence-inspiring number ($50\\%$), can create an illusion of certainty and high efficacy, which may be particularly comforting and appealing to someone with high IU.\n-   Conversely, the NNT frame ($40$) makes the probabilistic and uncertain nature of the personal benefit highly salient. For an individual high in IU, the explicit information that $39$ out of $40$ individuals do not see the specific benefit is a stark reminder of uncertainty, which can be highly anxiety-provoking. This can lead to a more negative illness perception, where the condition is perceived as less controllable, and may even lead to treatment refusal due to the inability to tolerate the lack of a guaranteed personal outcome.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0250  40.0 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4719537"}]}
