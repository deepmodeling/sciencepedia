This practice plunges you into a real-world clinical detective story, requiring you to interpret complex biochemical data. By analyzing the relationship between insulin and C-peptide, you will learn how clinicians can objectively uncover deception, a foundational skill in this diagnostic area [@problem_id:4711829].", "problem": "A $32$-year-old medical assistant with no known history of diabetes mellitus presents with recurrent episodes of confusion and diaphoresis. During two separate admissions, plasma glucose values were documented at $38$ mg/dL and $41$ mg/dL, respectively. She reports an intense interest in learning medical procedures and frequently volunteers to stay late in the clinic. She denies any interest in work leave, legal claims, or financial compensation. She lives alone. On interview, she expresses that she “feels most herself” when she is being cared for in the hospital and keeps a personal blog about her medical experiences.\n\nBetween episodes, her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is $5.2\\%$, serum creatinine is $0.8$ mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is $110$ mL/min/1.73 m$^2$. A toxicology screen is negative for oral hypoglycemics except for a dedicated high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) sulfonylurea panel, which is negative. At the time of hypoglycemia, a fasting blood sample is drawn, analyzed on an immunoassay validated to detect commonly used exogenous human insulin analogs, with the following results: serum insulin $42$ µU/mL (reference $<3$ µU/mL during hypoglycemia), C-peptide $0.2$ ng/mL, and proinsulin $1.0$ pmol/L.

Autoimmune insulin syndrome due to anti-insulin antibodies", "solution": "The problem asks for the most parsimonious explanation for a patient's recurrent hypoglycemia, integrating her clinical presentation, psychosocial history, and detailed biochemical findings. The solution requires a systematic evaluation of the differential diagnosis for hypoglycemia.\n\n**1. Initial Assessment: Characterizing the Hypoglycemia**\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of neuroglycopenia (confusion) and autonomic activation (diaphoresis) at times of documented low plasma glucose levels ($38$ mg/dL and $41$ mg/dL). This satisfies Whipple's triad (symptoms of hypoglycemia, low blood glucose, and assumed resolution of symptoms with glucose), confirming clinically significant hypoglycemia.\n\nThe next critical step is to determine if the hypoglycemia is insulin-mediated. During a hypoglycemic state in a healthy individual, the pancreatic beta-cells should cease insulin secretion. The reference value provided, serum insulin $<3$ µU/mL during hypoglycemia, reflects this physiological suppression. However, the patient's serum insulin level was measured at $42$ µU/mL. This inappropriately high insulin level in the face of hypoglycemia confirms a diagnosis of **hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia**.\n\n**2. Differentiating Endogenous vs. Exogenous Hyperinsulinism**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the source of the excess insulin. The provided physiological principle is central to this differentiation: pancreatic beta cells synthesize proinsulin, which is cleaved to release insulin and C-peptide (connecting peptide) in an equimolar ($1:1$) ratio into the circulation.\n\n*   **Endogenous hyperinsulinism**: If the pancreas is the source of the excess insulin (e.g., due to an insulin-secreting tumor (insulinoma) or stimulation by a drug like a sulfonylurea), both insulin and C-peptide will be secreted in excess. This would lead to high levels of both insulin and C-peptide. Proinsulin levels may also be elevated, particularly in insulinomas where processing of proinsulin to insulin can be inefficient.\n\n*   **Exogenous hyperinsulinism**: If insulin is administered from an external source (i.e., injection), commercially available insulin formulations do not contain C-peptide. The high levels of circulating exogenous insulin provide strong negative feedback to the patient's own pancreatic beta-cells, suppressing the entire secretory pathway. This results in suppressed secretion of endogenous insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Patient's Biochemical Profile**\n\nLet's analyze the patient's laboratory results from the sample drawn during hypoglycemia:\n*   **Serum Insulin**: $42$ µU/mL. This is markedly elevated (reference $<3$ µU/mL), confirming hyperinsulinemia. The problem states the assay detects commonly used exogenous insulin analogs, so this value reflects the total circulating insulin.\n*   **C-peptide**: $0.2$ ng/mL. This level is very low, indicating profound suppression of pancreatic beta-cell secretion. In a state of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, C-peptide would be expected to be elevated, typically $>0.6$ ng/mL. The patient's normal renal function (eGFR $110$ mL/min/$1.73$ m$^2$) is crucial, as it confirms that this low C-peptide level is not an artifact of increased renal clearance; rather, it is a true reflection of suppressed production.\n*   **Proinsulin**: $1.0$ pmol/L. This level is also low, consistent with pancreatic suppression. In an insulinoma, proinsulin is often disproportionately elevated (e.g., $>5$ pmol/L or representing $>25\\%$ of total immunoreactive insulin).\n\nThe biochemical triad of **high insulin, low C-peptide, and low proinsulin** is the definitive signature of **exogenous insulin administration**.\n\n**4. Integrating the Clinical and Psychosocial Context**\n\nHaving established exogenous insulin administration as the cause, we must now determine the patient's motivation, which distinguishes between factitious disorder and malingering.\n*   **Malingering** is characterized by the intentional production of symptoms for a recognizable external incentive (e.g., financial gain, avoiding work or legal responsibilities).\n*   **Factitious disorder** is characterized by the intentional production of symptoms driven by an internal need to assume the \"sick role,\" without obvious external rewards.\n\nThe patient's history is highly suggestive of factitious disorder:\n*   She is a medical assistant, providing her with the specialized knowledge and access required to obtain and administer insulin surreptitiously.\n*   She explicitly \"denies any interest in work leave, legal claims, or financial compensation,\" arguing against a motive of external gain (malingering).\n*   Her motivation appears internal and psychological: she \"feels most herself\" when being cared for in the hospital and maintains a blog about her medical experiences, indicating a desire to inhabit the patient role.\n\n**5. Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n*   **A. Factitious disorder imposed on self with surreptitious exogenous insulin administration**: This diagnosis is consistent with all aspects of the case. The biochemical findings (high insulin, low C-peptide/proinsulin) prove exogenous insulin use. The psychosocial history (medical professional, no external incentive, desire to be in the sick role) is the classic presentation of factitious disorder. This is the most parsimonious explanation.\n    *   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Malingering with covert exogenous insulin use to obtain disability benefits**: While this option correctly identifies exogenous insulin use, it incorrectly assigns the motivation. The problem statement provides specific information that contradicts the motive of malingering (denial of interest in financial compensation, work leave, etc.).\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Pancreatic beta-cell adenoma (insulinoma) causing endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia**: This would be a cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemia. As derived above, it would present with elevated C-peptide and proinsulin levels, which is the opposite of this patient's findings.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Surreptitious sulfonylurea ingestion leading to endogenous insulin secretion**: Sulfonylurea use stimulates the pancreas, causing endogenous hyperinsulinemia, which would lead to elevated C-peptide. This is contrary to the patient's labs. Furthermore, this was specifically ruled out by a negative high-sensitivity HPLC–MS panel.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Autoimmune insulin syndrome due to anti-insulin antibodies**: This rare condition can cause hypoglycemia with a high total insulin level and suppressed C-peptide. However, the diagnosis requires the presence of anti-insulin antibodies. The problem states that \"Anti-insulin antibody testing is negative,\" which definitively excludes this diagnosis.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of biochemical evidence pointing to exogenous insulin administration and psychosocial factors indicating a desire to assume the sick role without external incentives makes factitious disorder imposed on self the only fitting diagnosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4711829"}, {"introduction": "Once deception is established, the clinician's task shifts from 'what' to 'why'. This next practice explores the crucial, and often blurry, line between factitious disorder (the need to be sick) and malingering (the pursuit of external rewards). You will navigate a complex case where both internal and external motives appear present, forcing you to apply strict diagnostic criteria to make a defensible classification [@problem_id:4711863].", "problem": "A $36$-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department (ED) after being found diaphoretic and confused with a capillary glucose of $32$ mg/dL. In the past $6$ months he has presented to $4$ different hospitals with similar episodes, leading to a cumulative $11$ ED visits and $5$ short inpatient admissions. He carries no diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; outpatient records show a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of $5.2\\%$ within the last $2$ months. On this admission, laboratory testing obtained prior to dextrose administration reveals plasma insulin $42$ $\\mu$U/mL, C-peptide $0.1$ ng/mL, proinsulin below assay detection, and a negative sulfonylurea screen. A bag with insulin syringes is later found in his backpack; he states, “Those are old, from my grandfather.” He frequently uses medical jargon and presents a binder with neatly organized discharge summaries. Nursing notes from prior admissions document that he is engaged, polite, and particularly appreciative of “how special” the team makes him feel.\n\nCollateral information reveals several external contingencies: he is currently unhoused and reports that admission “guarantees a warm bed and meals for a couple days.” He has an outstanding court date for a probation violation that has been postponed twice due to hospitalizations occurring within $24$ hours of the scheduled appearance. He repeatedly requests opioid analgesics for “severe generalized pain” and asks staff to complete disability paperwork, stating, “I can’t work like this.” When opioids are declined, he has left against medical advice and presented to a different ED within $12$ hours.\n\nYou are asked to make a classification decision and to justify it using transparent criteria and documented contingencies. Starting from the core definitions that distinguish intentional symptom falsification or induction, the role of external incentives, and the requirement that certain diagnoses be excluded when obvious external rewards are present, select the single best option below that both (i) classifies his behavior and (ii) outlines an appropriate documentation strategy to support the decision.\n\nA.

Diagnose somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain because his distress appears genuine; avoid terms implying intentionality and document the severity of symptoms.\n\nD. Diagnose both factitious disorder imposed on self and malingering to capture mixed motives; document that internal and external gains are simultaneously present and therefore both diagnoses are warranted.", "solution": "This problem requires a differential diagnosis between somatic symptom disorder, factitious disorder, and malingering, based on two key axes: (1) whether the symptoms are intentionally produced (feigned), and (2) what the primary motivation for the behavior is.\n\n**1. Establish Intentional Symptom Production:**\nThe patient's hypoglycemia is confirmed by a glucose level of 32 mg/dL. The laboratory results are definitive: a high plasma insulin level ($42$ µU/mL) with a suppressed C-peptide level ($0.1$ ng/mL) is the pathognomonic signature of exogenous insulin administration. This is because commercial insulin does not contain C-peptide, and the high exogenous insulin level suppresses the body's own pancreatic secretion. This objective evidence, combined with the discovery of insulin syringes, proves the illness is intentionally induced. This rules out conditions where symptoms are not intentionally produced, such as somatic symptom disorder (Option C).\n\n**2. Differentiate Factitious Disorder from Malingering:**\nThe distinction rests entirely on the motivation for the behavior.\n*   **Factitious Disorder:** The motivation is primarily internal—a psychological need to assume the \"sick role.\" The diagnosis requires that \"the deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards\" (DSM-5-TR Criterion C). While the patient shows some signs of this motivation (enjoying the special attention), we must evaluate for external rewards.\n*   **Malingering:** This is defined as the \"intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives.\"\n\n**3. Evaluate for External Incentives:**\nThe case presents multiple, clear, and powerful external incentives that are contingent on the illness behavior:\n*   **Shelter/Sustenance:** Admission provides a \"warm bed and meals.\"\n*   **Legal Evasion:** Hospitalizations are temporally linked to postponing a court date.\n*   **Drug-Seeking:** He repeatedly requests opioid analgesics.\n*   **Financial Gain:** He is actively seeking to have disability paperwork completed.\n\n**4. Apply the Diagnostic Hierarchy:**\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR, the presence of such prominent \"obvious external rewards\" points to malingering. A formal diagnosis of factitious disorder is precluded when these external incentives are present and appear to account for the behavior. Therefore, one cannot diagnose factitious disorder (Option A) or diagnose both conditions simultaneously in this context (Option D). The most accurate and defensible classification is malingering. A proper documentation strategy would transparently list the objective evidence of feigning (the lab results) and the specific external incentives identified.\n\n**5. Conclusion Based on Options:**\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it requires documenting the absence of external rewards, which is contrary to the facts of the case.\n*   **Option B** is correct. It properly classifies the behavior as malingering due to the prominent external incentives, outlines the correct documentation strategy (citing evidence of induction and listing the contingencies), and correctly applies the diagnostic hierarchy by deferring the diagnosis of factitious disorder.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because the illness is proven to be intentionally induced.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect because the formal diagnostic criteria do not allow for a simultaneous diagnosis of factitious disorder when obvious external rewards are present.
