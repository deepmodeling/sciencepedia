We can proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has major depressive disorder, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ be the event that a patient screens positive on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We are asked to derive an expression for the posterior probability of depression given a positive screen, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, and then compute its value.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The true prevalence of the disorder, which is the prior probability of having the disease: $\\pi = P(D) = 0.25$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive screen given the patient has the disease: $Se = P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative screen given the patient does not have the disease: $Sp = P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 0.80$.\n\nOur objective is to find $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}\n$$\n\nThe numerator is the product of the sensitivity and the prevalence, which are both given:\n$$\nP(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) = Se \\cdot \\pi\n$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive screen. We can express this using the law of total probability, which states that we can find the total probability of an event by summing its probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Here, the exhaustive set is $\\{D, D^c\\}$.\n$$\nP(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\n\nWe need to express each term in this expansion using the given quantities $Se$, $Sp$, and $\\pi$.\n-   $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n-   $P(D)$ is the prevalence, $\\pi$.\n-   $P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is $1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n-   $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive screen given the patient does not have the disease. This is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since specificity is $P(T^{-} \\mid D^c)$, and a test result must be either positive or negative, we have $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) + P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^{+}) = (Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this full expression for the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to obtain the final derived expression for $P(D \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{(Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the posterior probability derived from first principles as required.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $\\pi = 0.25$, $Se = 0.85$, and $Sp = 0.80$.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = Se \\cdot \\pi = 0.85 \\times 0.25 = 0.2125\n$$\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n-   The first term is the same as the numerator: $Se \\cdot \\pi = 0.2125$.\n-   The second term is the probability of a false positive: $(1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi) = (1 - 0.80) \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.20 \\times 0.75 = 0.1500$.\n\nNow, calculate the denominator by summing these two terms:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = P(T^{+}) = 0.2125 + 0.1500 = 0.3625\n$$\n\nFinally, compute the posterior probability:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.2125}{0.3625} \\approx 0.58620689655...\n$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.5862$.\n\nThe problem also asks whether a stepped-care threshold that initiates treatment when the posterior probability exceeds $0.5$ would be met. Since our calculated posterior probability is $P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.5862$, which is greater than $0.5$, the threshold for initiating low-intensity psychological treatment would be met on average for patients who screen positive in this clinic setting.

One key area of research is autonomic nervous system dysregulation, often measured by heart rate variability.

They focus on heart rate variability measured by the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), a time-domain index that typically decreases with autonomic imbalance. In a large cohort in which sampling variability is negligible for estimating means and the pooled dispersion, the depressed group has an average SDNN of $100$ milliseconds, whereas the non-depressed group has an average SDNN of $120$ milliseconds. The pooled standard deviation across groups is estimated to be $30$ milliseconds.

The SMD is a dimensionless measure of effect size that quantifies the difference between two group means in terms of their common standard deviation.

It is based on fundamental definitions and principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. All required information is provided, and the scenario is clinically plausible. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in terms of baseline risk and relative risk, followed by a numerical calculation for the given values. We begin by defining the primary epidemiological measures involved.\n\nLet $P_{uc}$ be the probability of the adverse event (in this case, $90$-day cardiac rehospitalization) in the control group (usual care). This is the baseline risk.\nLet $P_{cc}$ be the probability of the event in the treatment group (collaborative care).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The baseline risk: $P_{uc} = 0.30$.\n- The relative risk of the event for the treatment group compared to the control group: $RR = 0.85$.\n\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk of the event in the treatment group to the risk in the control group:\n$$RR = \\frac{P_{cc}}{P_{uc}}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can express the risk in the treatment group as:\n$$P_{cc} = RR \\times P_{uc}$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the difference in risk between the control and treatment groups. It quantifies the absolute effect of the intervention.\n$$ARR = P_{uc} - P_{cc}$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse event compared to the control group. A positive $NNT$ is defined for interventions that are beneficial, meaning $P_{uc}  P_{cc}$.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $NNT$ in terms of the baseline risk ($P_{uc}$) and the relative risk ($RR$), we substitute the expressions for $ARR$ and $P_{cc}$ into the equation for $NNT$.\n\nFirst, substitute the definition of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc} - P_{cc}}$$\n\nNext, substitute the expression for $P_{cc}$ in terms of $P_{uc}$ and $RR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc} - (RR \\times P_{uc})}$$\n\nFactoring out the baseline risk $P_{uc}$ from the denominator gives the desired general expression:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc}(1 - RR)}$$\nThis equation expresses the $NNT$ solely in terms of the baseline risk and the relative risk, as required.\n\nNow, we compute the numeric value of the $NNT$ using the provided data: $P_{uc} = 0.30$ and $RR = 0.85$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.30 \\times (1 - 0.85)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\nThen, we compute the denominator:\n$$0.30 \\times 0.15 = 0.045$$\nFinally, we calculate the reciprocal:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.045} \\approx 22.222...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $22.222...$ has its first two significant figures as $2$ and $2$. The third digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nTherefore, the rounded value for the $NNT$ is $22$.
