The observation window for one patient is from day $1$ through day $180$, inclusive (that is, $180$ calendar days). The Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) is defined as the fraction of unique days in the observation window on which the patient had medication available, with per-day coverage censored at $1.0$ (no more than one covered day per calendar day). When a refill occurs before the current supply is exhausted, the new supply is carried forward (stockpiled) and begins covering days immediately after the existing supply ends; when a refill occurs after a gap with no on-hand supply, coverage resumes on the refill date. Coverage beyond day $180$ is ignored. Assume no dose changes and that dispensing is accurate.\n\nThe patient’s pharmacy dispensing history is:\n- Day $1$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $25$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $55$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $100$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $125$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $160$: $30$ days’ supply.\n\nUsing only the definitional principles above, compute this patient’s PDC over days $1$–$180$.

Your final reported numerical answer should be only the PDC value.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard pharmaceutical adherence metrics, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its language.\n\nThe task is to compute the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) for a patient over an observation window of $180$ days. The observation window spans from day $1$ to day $180$, inclusive. The PDC is defined as the number of unique days with medication coverage, divided by the total number of days in the observation window.\n\nFirst, we must determine the specific calendar days on which the patient had medication available. We will trace the supply from each dispensing event, adhering to the rules for stockpiling and gaps, to identify continuous blocks of coverage.\n\nThe patient's dispensing history is:\n- Day $1$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $25$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $55$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $100$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $125$: $30$ days’ supply.\n- Day $160$: $30$ days’ supply.\n\nWe can consolidate these dispenses into continuous coverage periods:\n\n1.  **First Coverage Block:**\n    -   The first dispensing on day $1$ provides a $30$-day supply, establishing coverage until the end of day $30$.\n    -   The dispense on day $25$ occurs before this supply is exhausted. This new $30$-day supply is stockpiled, extending the coverage period by $30$ days to the end of day $60$ ($30+30=60$).\n    -   Similarly, the dispense on day $55$ is stockpiled, further extending coverage by $30$ days to the end of day $90$ ($60+30=90$).\n    -   This results in a single, continuous block of coverage from **day $1$ to day $90$**.\n\n2.  **Gap in Coverage:**\n    -   The supply from the first block is exhausted at the end of day $90$.\n    -   The next dispensing event is on day $100$.\n    -   Therefore, there is a gap in coverage from **day $91$ to day $99$**, inclusive. These are $9$ uncovered days.\n\n3.  **Second Coverage Block:**\n    -   The dispensing on day $100$ for a $30$-day supply initiates a new coverage period. Per the rules, coverage resumes on the refill date, so this block starts on day $100$ and extends to day $129$ ($100+30-1=129$).\n    -   The dispense on day $125$ is stockpiled, extending the coverage from this block by $30$ days to the end of day $159$ ($129+30=159$).\n    -   The dispense on day $160$ occurs the day after the previous supply runs out. This is considered continuous, and the supply is stockpiled, extending coverage by another $30$ days to the end of day $189$ ($159+30=189$).\n    -   This results in a second continuous block of coverage from **day $100$ to day $189$**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of covered days within the $180$-day observation window by finding the intersection of the coverage blocks with the window $[1, 180]$.\n-   The first coverage block is $[1, 90]$. Its intersection with $[1, 180]$ is the entire block, which contains $90 - 1 + 1 = 90$ days.\n-   The second coverage block is $[100, 189]$. Its intersection with $[1, 180]$ is the interval $[100, 180]$, which contains $180 - 100 + 1 = 81$ days.\n\nThe total number of unique days covered within the observation window is the sum of the days from these two intersections:\n$$ \\text{Total covered days} = 90 + 81 = 171 $$\nThe total number of days in the observation window is $180$.\nThe PDC is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{PDC} = \\frac{\\text{Total covered days}}{\\text{Total days in observation window}} = \\frac{171}{180} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\text{PDC} = \\frac{171 \\div 9}{180 \\div 9} = \\frac{19}{20} = 0.95 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.9500$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative question: The censoring of PDC at $1.0$ creates a ceiling effect, which means that for patients with high baseline adherence, the maximum possible measured improvement is small. This compression of scores at the upper end of the scale can lead to an underestimation of an intervention's true effect size, as the observed mean difference between intervention and control groups is artificially constrained.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9500}$$", "id": "4722493"}, {"introduction": "Nonadherence rarely stems from a single cause; it is often a complex interplay of psychological, social, and practical barriers.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical modeling used in health psychology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its language. There are no violations of fundamental principles, missing data, or ambiguities that would render it unsolvable.\n\nThe problem requires us to identify a priority intervention based on a specific decision rule and then calculate the resulting risk reduction. The predicted probability of nonadherence, $R$, is given by the linear additive model:\n$$\nR = \\alpha + \\beta_{d} D + \\beta_{f} F + \\beta_{c} C\n$$\nThe parameters and patient data are provided as:\n- Baseline intercept: $\\alpha = 0.15$\n- Depression score and coefficient: $D = 14$, $\\beta_{d} = 0.01$\n- Financial Strain Index and coefficient: $F = 0.50$, $\\beta_{f} = 0.35$\n- Medication Regimen Complexity Index and coefficient: $C = 9$, $\\beta_{c} = 0.02$\n\nThe first step is to follow the specified decision rule: \"prioritizing the barrier that has the largest marginal contribution to the current nonadherence risk\". In this additive model, the marginal contribution of each barrier is the value of its corresponding term in the equation.\n\nThe marginal contribution of depression ($R_D$) is:\n$$\nR_D = \\beta_{d} D = (0.01)(14) = 0.14\n$$\nThe marginal contribution of financial strain ($R_F$) is:\n$$\nR_F = \\beta_{f} F = (0.35)(0.50) = 0.175\n$$\nThe marginal contribution of regimen complexity ($R_C$) is:\n$$\nR_C = \\beta_{c} C = (0.02)(9) = 0.18\n$$\n\nComparing these contributions:\n$$\n0.18 > 0.175 > 0.14\n$$\nThus, $R_C > R_F > R_D$. The barrier with the largest marginal contribution to the current nonadherence risk is regimen complexity.\n\nThe second step is to compute the expected absolute reduction in risk by implementing the intervention corresponding to this highest-priority barrier. The available interventions and their effects are:\n- Depression: reduces $D$ by $\\Delta D = 6$\n- Financial strain: reduces $F$ by $\\Delta F = 0.30$\n- Regimen complexity: reduces $C$ by $\\Delta C = 4$\n\nAccording to the decision rule, we must select the intervention for regimen complexity.

The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express the number $0.08$ with four significant figures, we must include trailing zeros after the decimal point.

It is scientifically grounded in established models of learning, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from any logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: first, to derive a closed-form expression for the habit strength $H_t$ as a function of time $t$, and second, to calculate the minimum integer number of days required to achieve a habit strength of at least $0.8$ for a specific consolidation rate $\\alpha$.\n\nThe dynamics of habit formation are described by the discrete-time proportional-change model:\n$$H_{t+1} = H_t + \\alpha (1 - H_t)$$\nwhere $H_t$ is the habit strength on day $t$, $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is the daily consolidation rate, and the initial condition is $H_0 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the closed-form expression for $H_t$. The recurrence relation can be rearranged as:\n$$H_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha) H_t + \\alpha$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, we can define a new variable that represents the \"distance\" from the asymptotic value of habit strength.

The initial value is $J_0 = H_0 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$. We can express $H_t$ as $H_t = J_t + 1$. Substituting this into the rearranged recurrence relation:\n$$J_{t+1} + 1 = (1 - \\alpha)(J_t + 1) + \\alpha$$\n$$J_{t+1} + 1 = (1 - \\alpha)J_t + 1 - \\alpha + \\alpha$$\n$$J_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha)J_t$$\nThis is a homogeneous linear recurrence relation, indicating that $J_t$ follows a geometric progression. The solution is:\n$$J_t = J_0 (1 - \\alpha)^t$$\nSubstituting the initial value $J_0 = -1$:\n$$J_t = - (1 - \\alpha)^t$$\nNow, we transform back to the original variable $H_t$ using $H_t = J_t + 1$:\n$$H_t = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^t$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the habit strength at day $t$, given the initial condition $H_0 = 0$.\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem. We need to find the minimal integer number of days $t$ required to reach a target habit strength $H_t \\geq 0.8$, given a consolidation rate of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nWe set up the inequality using our derived expression for $H_t$:\n$$H_t \\geq 0.8$$\n$$1 - (1 - \\alpha)^t \\geq 0.8$$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = 0.05$:\n$$1 - (1 - 0.05)^t \\geq 0.8$$\n$$1 - (0.95)^t \\geq 0.8$$\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $t$:\n$$0.2 \\geq (0.95)^t$$\nTo isolate $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. As the natural logarithm function $\\ln(x)$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$\\ln(0.2) \\geq \\ln((0.95)^t)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$:\n$$\\ln(0.2) \\geq t \\ln(0.95)$$\nTo solve for $t$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.95)$. It is critical to note a priori the sign of this term. Since $0 < 0.95 < 1$, its natural logarithm is negative, i.e., $\\ln(0.95) < 0$.
