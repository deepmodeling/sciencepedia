We proceed from core definitions.\n\n1. Definition of risk and absolute change. The risk in a group is the probability of the outcome in that group. For the untreated group, the risk is $p_{0}$; for the treated group, the risk is $p_{1}$. The absolute change in risk due to treatment is the difference between these probabilities. When treatment reduces risk (that is, $p_{1} < p_{0}$), this difference is the absolute risk reduction (ARR), given by\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = p_{0} - p_{1}.\n$$\n\n2. Definition of proportional change relative to a baseline. The proportional change relative to baseline quantifies the fraction of the baseline risk removed by treatment. The relative risk reduction (RRR) is therefore the absolute reduction expressed as a proportion of the baseline risk:\n$$\n\\text{RRR} = \\frac{p_{0} - p_{1}}{p_{0}},\n$$\nprovided $p_{0} \\neq 0$, which holds here since $p_{0} = 0.20$.\n\n3.

Let $T$ be the event of a positive test result, and $\\neg T$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as conditional probabilities:\n1.  Prevalence, $p = P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not having the condition is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n2.  Sensitivity, $Se = P(T | D) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the condition (the true positive rate). From this, the false negative rate is $P(\\neg T | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n3.  Specificity, $Sp = P(\\neg T | \\neg D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the condition (the true negative rate). From this, the false positive rate is $P(T | \\neg D) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe goal is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value, $PPV = P(D | T)$, and the Negative Predictive Value, $NPV = P(\\neg D | \\neg T)$.\n\nDerivation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$):\nThe $PPV$ is the probability that a person has the condition given that they tested positive. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$PPV = P(D | T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the condition and testing positive. It can be found from the definition of sensitivity: $P(T | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$, which rearranges to $P(D \\cap T) = P(T | D) P(D) = Se \\cdot p$. This term represents the probability of a true positive in the population.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We use the Law of Total Probability, partitioning the event $T$ by whether the person has the condition or not:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap \\neg D)$$\n$$P(T) = P(T | D) P(D) + P(T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nThe term $(1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p)$ represents the probability of a false positive in the population.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the full expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.10)}{(0.90)(0.10) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.10)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + (0.05)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.09}{0.135} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV \\approx 0.6667$.\n\nDerivation of Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$):\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that a person does not have the condition given that they tested negative. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$NPV = P(\\neg D | \\neg T) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)$, is the joint probability of not having the condition and testing negative. It can be found from the definition of specificity: $P(\\neg T | \\neg D) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg D)}$, which rearranges to $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T) = P(\\neg T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D) = Sp \\cdot (1 - p)$. This term represents the probability of a true negative in the population.\n\nThe denominator, $P(\\neg T)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T \\cap D) + P(\\neg T \\cap \\neg D)$$\n$$P(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T | D) P(D) + P(\\neg T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(\\neg T) = ((1 - Se) \\cdot p) + (Sp \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nThe term $(1 - Se) \\cdot p$ represents the probability of a false negative in the population.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the full expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{(1 - Se) \\cdot p + Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.95)(1 - 0.10)}{(1 - 0.90)(0.10) + (0.95)(1 - 0.10)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.90)}{(0.10)(0.10) + (0.95)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.855}{0.01 + 0.855} = \\frac{0.855}{0.865}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV \\approx 0.9884$.\n\nPart 2: Explanation Using Natural Frequencies\n\nTo explain these results to a patient, we can translate these probabilities into expected counts for a group of $1000$ people representative of the population.\n\nImagine we test a group of $1000$ people. Based on the fact that the condition is present in $10\\%$ of this population, we would expect:\n-   $1000 \\times 0.10 = 100$ people to have the condition.\n-   The remaining $1000 - 100 = 900$ people to not have the condition.\n\nNow, let's look at how the test performs in each of these two groups.\n\nFor the $100$ people who have the condition:\n-   The test is $90\\%$ sensitive, meaning it will correctly give a positive result for $90\\%$ of this group. So, $100 \\times 0.90 = 90$ people will test positive. These are the **true positives**.\n-   The other $10\\%$ will get an incorrect negative result. So, $100 \\times 0.10 = 10$ people will test negative. These are the **false negatives**.\n\nFor the $900$ people who do not have the condition:\n-   The test is $95\\%$ specific, meaning it will correctly give a negative result for $95\\%$ of this group. So, $900 \\times 0.95 = 855$ people will test negative. These are the **true negatives**.\n-   The other $5\\%$ will get an incorrect positive result. So, $900 \\times 0.05 = 45$ people will test positive. These are the **false positives**.\n\nNow we can explain what your test result means.\n\nExplanation for a Positive Test Result ($PPV$):\nLet's look at everyone who tested positive. This includes the $90$ true positives and the $45$ false positives, for a total of $90 + 45 = 135$ people. You are one of these $135$ people.\nOf these $135$ people who tested positive, only the $90$ true positives actually have the condition.\nTherefore, a positive result means that there is a **$90$ out of $135$** chance that you actually have the condition. This simplifies to a $2$ in $3$ chance, or about $67\\%$.\n\nExplanation for a Negative Test Result ($NPV$):\nLet's look at everyone who tested negative. This includes the $10$ false negatives and the $855$ true negatives, for a total of $10 + 855 = 865$ people. Your result puts you in this group.\nOf these $865$ people who tested negative, $855$ of them truly do not have the condition.\nTherefore, a negative result means that there is an **$855$ out of $865$** chance that you do not have the condition. This gives a very high level of confidence, over $98\\%$, that you are indeed free of the condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6667 & 0.9884 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4731768"}, {"introduction": "Effective communication goes beyond numerical accuracy; it involves understanding the psychological impact of our words.

The same test can be described as either “90% detection” or “10% missed.” The choice to accept screening is influenced by how the patient subjectively evaluates the test after hearing the description.\n\nStart from the following well-tested facts and definitions in decision science and medical psychology: (i) in Prospect Theory (PT), outcomes are encoded relative to a reference point (for a screening test, the natural reference is perfect detection at $100\\%$), (ii) losses loom larger than equivalent gains (loss aversion), such that the disutility of a loss of magnitude $x$ is scaled by a loss aversion coefficient $\\lambda$ with $\\lambda > 1$, and (iii) message framing shifts attention and salience toward whatever is framed, so that attention weights for the emphasized aspect are larger than for the deemphasized aspect. In clinical communication, describing performance as “90% detection” is a gain frame, whereas “10% missed” is a loss frame; both describe the same accuracy but different aspects.\n\nAssume a stylized but realistic patient-level evaluation in which, under a gain frame, the positive attribute (detection) receives an attention weight $\\omega_G=0.7$ and the negative attribute (missed) receives $\\omega_L=0.3$, while under a loss frame, the weights swap to $\\omega_G=0.3$ and $\\omega_L=0.7$. Assume a loss aversion coefficient $\\lambda=2$. The detection proportion is $0.90$ and the miss proportion is $0.10$. The practitioner’s goal is to maximize screening uptake, which increases monotonically with the patient’s net subjective evaluation of the test.\n\nWhich prediction is most consistent with Prospect Theory and these communication principles?\n\nA. Uptake will be lower when the test is framed as “$10\\%$ missed” than when framed as “$90\\%$ detection,” because the loss frame makes the negative attribute more salient and losses are weighted more heavily than gains.\n\nB. Uptake will be higher when the test is framed as “$10\\%$ missed,” because loss frames always motivate detection behaviors regardless of what is being framed.\n\nC. Uptake will be unchanged, because the descriptions are numerically equivalent and rational patients ignore frames.\n\nD. Uptake will be lower when the test is framed as “$90\\%$ detection” than when framed as “$10\\%$ missed,” because the gain frame makes potential failure more salient than success.", "solution": "The problem requires us to calculate the net subjective evaluation of the screening test under two different frames, using the principles of Prospect Theory.

The value of this gain is $v_G = 0.90$.\n- The **loss component** is the miss proportion, $0.10$.
