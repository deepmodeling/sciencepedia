This practice challenges you to move beyond abstract definitions by translating the six core processes of the ACT \"hexaflex\" into concrete, falsifiable predictions about behavior [@problem_id:4708347]. Mastering this skill of operationalization is fundamental to thinking like a behavioral scientist and is the first step in building a bridge from psychological theory to measurable, real-world outcomes.", "problem": "A person living with chronic fatigue syndrome is enrolled in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which seeks to increase psychological flexibility by strengthening six interrelated processes often depicted as the “hexaflex”: acceptance, cognitive defusion, present-moment awareness, self-as-context, values, and committed action. In functional contextualism, the base assumptions are that behavior is a function of context, private events (e.g., pain, thoughts) are treated as experiences rather than targets for elimination, and effective action is defined by workability toward chosen values under varying conditions. You are asked to translate these core definitions into falsifiable predictions about behavior in a novel illness-related decision scenario and specify observable outcomes that would refute each prediction.\n\nScenario: The participant and a close friend plan a paced social walk. Before the walk, the participant identifies “showing up reliably for friendship while protecting long-term health” as a top value and rates its importance as $\\geq 8$ on a $0$–$10$ scale. Together with the therapist, they create a pacing plan: cycles of $3$ minutes walking followed by $1$ minute resting, for a total planned duration of $40$ minutes. The wearable records step cadence and heart rate; a phone app captures time-stamped markers when pain spikes (participant taps when pain $\\geq 6$ on a $0$–$10$ scale) and when specific thoughts appear (e.g., “If I slow down, I am weak”). Planned cadence is between $90$ and $100$ steps per minute; baseline heart rate prior to the walk is $70\\,\\text{bpm}$, and an individualized safe upper bound is set at $130\\,\\text{bpm}$ by the medical team. Overexertion is defined behaviorally as maintaining a cadence $>\\!120$ steps per minute for $\\geq 5$ consecutive minutes or sustaining heart rate $>\\!130\\,\\text{bpm}$ for $\\geq 5$ consecutive minutes, and avoidance is defined as abandoning the walk for $\\geq 20$ consecutive minutes without attempting to re-engage despite the pre-specified value rating.\n\nWhich option most appropriately translates the hexaflex processes into falsifiable behavioral predictions for this scenario and specifies concrete observable outcomes that would refute each prediction?\n\nA. Predictions anchored in psychological flexibility and values-consistent pacing:\n- Acceptance: When pain spikes to $\\geq 6$, the participant will allow pain to be present and continue following the pacing plan (walk/rest cycles) rather than engage in prolonged symptom-avoidant withdrawal; refutation if, within $2$ minutes of a spike, the participant abandons the walk for $\\geq 20$ consecutive minutes without attempting re-engagement, despite the values rating $\\geq 8$.\n- Cognitive defusion: When the thought “If I slow down, I am weak” appears, behavior will track the pre-set pacing parameters rather than the literal content of the thought; refutation if the participant accelerates to $>\\!120$ steps per minute for $\\geq 5$ minutes after the thought marker, violating the plan.\n- Present-moment awareness: The participant will adjust within the pacing envelope in response to immediate feedback (e.g., slight cadence reductions or micro-pauses when early fatigue cues arise) while remaining in contact with the friend; refutation if heart rate remains $>\\!130\\,\\text{bpm}$ for $\\geq 10$ minutes with no observed adjustments (no rests taken, cadence unchanged).\n- Self-as-context: Sense of self remains broader than pain/thought content, reflected in willingness to re-engage in the next cycle after aversive events; refutation if the probability of re-engagement within $5$ minutes after a pain or thought marker is $<\\!0.2$ across the walk.\n- Values: Behavior organizes around “showing up for friendship while protecting health,” operationalized as spending $\\geq 0.8$ of the planned $40$ minutes side-by-side with the friend and adhering to the pacing plan; refutation if time with the friend is $<\\!0.5$ of planned duration and the majority of observed choices are dedicated to symptom control absent re-engagement attempts.\n- Committed action: The participant completes $\\geq 0.8$ of planned walk/rest cycles or, if conditions change, collaboratively revises the plan and then follows the revision; refutation if $\\leq 0.2$ of cycles are completed without any plan revision or re-engagement attempt.\n\nB. Predictions centered on symptom reduction and internal content change:\n- Pain should drop to $\\leq 3$ during the walk; refutation if average pain remains $>\\!3$.\n- Catastrophizing thoughts should occur $\\leq 1$ time; refutation if they occur $>\\!1$ time.\n- Mindfulness should “feel deeper”; refutation if the participant reports not “feeling mindful.”\n- Values will be satisfied when discomfort is eliminated; refutation if discomfort persists.\n\nC. Predictions emphasizing cognitive control and thought suppression:\n- The participant will suppress or replace “weak” thoughts within $30$ seconds of occurrence; refutation if any such thought lasts $>\\!30$ seconds.\n- The participant will maintain positive self-talk, and pain-related words will be reduced by $50\\%$ in speech; refutation if pain-related words are not reduced.\n- The participant will avoid slowing down to prevent “looking weak”; refutation if cadence dips below $90$ steps per minute after thought markers.\n- Values are inferred from thought content change; refutation if no change in thought valence is observed.\n\nD. Predictions equating values with rigid stoic endurance:\n- The participant will never rest during the $40$ minutes regardless of pain or heart rate; refutation if any rest occurs.\n- The participant will keep cadence $\\geq 120$ steps per minute to “prove commitment”; refutation if cadence falls below $120$ steps per minute at any time.\n- Pain and fatigue should be ignored; refutation if the participant reports attending to bodily cues.\n- Values are demonstrated by pushing through limits; refutation if any safety parameter (heart rate $>\\!130\\,\\text{bpm}$) triggers plan changes.\n\nChoose the single best option.", "solution": "The user has provided a problem in the domain of medical psychology, specifically concerning Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and has asked for an evaluation of several options that translate ACT principles into falsifiable predictions.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Psychological Framework:** Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).\n-   **Core Goal of ACT:** Increase psychological flexibility.\n-   **Core Processes (Hexaflex):** Acceptance, cognitive defusion, present-moment awareness, self-as-context, values, and committed action.\n-   **Philosophical Basis (Functional Contextualism):**\n    -   Behavior is a function of context.\n    -   Private events (e.g., pain, thoughts) are treated as experiences to be had, not as problems to be eliminated.\n    -   Effective action is defined by its \"workability\" in moving towards chosen values.\n-   **Task:** Translate ACT principles into falsifiable behavioral predictions with specific, observable refutation criteria for a given scenario.\n-   **Scenario Context:** A participant with chronic fatigue syndrome is on a paced social walk with a friend.\n-   **Participant's Value:** \"showing up reliably for friendship while protecting long-term health.\"\n-   **Value Importance Rating:** $\\geq 8$ on a $0$–$10$ scale.\n-   **Pacing Plan:**\n    -   Cycles: $3$ minutes walking, $1$ minute resting.\n    -   Total Duration: $40$ minutes.\n-   **Data to be Collected:**\n    -   Wearable data: step cadence, heart rate.\n    -   App data: time-stamped markers for pain spikes (pain $\\geq 6$ on a $0$–$10$ scale) and specific thoughts (e.g., “If I slow down, I am weak”).\n-   **Physiological & Behavioral Parameters:**\n    -   Planned Cadence: $90$–$100$ steps per minute.\n    -   Baseline Heart Rate: $70\\,\\text{bpm}$.\n    -   Safe Upper Heart Rate Limit: $130\\,\\text{bpm}$.\n-   **Operational Definitions:**\n    -   **Overexertion:** Cadence $>\\!120$ steps per minute for $\\geq 5$ consecutive minutes OR heart rate $>\\!130\\,\\text{bpm}$ for $\\geq 5$ consecutive minutes.\n    -   **Avoidance:** Abandoning the walk for $\\geq 20$ consecutive minutes without attempting to re-engage.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded within the field of clinical and health psychology. ACT is a well-established, evidence-based psychotherapy. The philosophical underpinnings of functional contextualism are accurately stated. The problem is well-posed, asking for the operationalization of theoretical constructs into falsifiable, observable predictions, which is a cornerstone of scientific methodology in behavioral science. The scenario is realistic and detailed, providing specific, quantifiable parameters (e.g., heart rate, cadence, time intervals, self-ratings) that make such operationalization possible. There are no contradictions; the stated value (\"friendship while protecting health\") aligns with the concept of a paced plan (balancing social engagement with rest). The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to evaluate the options. The terminology is precise and well-defined (e.g., \"overexertion,\" \"avoidance\").\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the analysis and solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe core task is to evaluate which option's predictions align with the principles of ACT, which emphasizes psychological flexibility. This means behavior should be guided by values (workability) rather than being dictated by the form or content of private experiences (thoughts, pain). Actions should be flexible and context-sensitive, not rigid. The goal is not to feel better or think differently, but to *live* better in a valued way, even with discomfort.\n\n#### Analysis of Option A\nThis option presents six predictions, one for each of the hexaflex processes, framed in terms of psychological flexibility.\n\n-   **Acceptance:** The prediction is that the participant will continue the valued action (the planned walk) in the presence of pain. The refutation is a defined act of avoidance (abandoning the walk). This correctly operationalizes acceptance as a willingness to experience discomfort in the service of values, rather than as resignation or symptom reduction. The behavioral criteria for refutation ($ \\geq 20$ consecutive minutes of abandonment after a spike) are specific, observable, and drawn from the problem's definitions. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Cognitive Defusion:** The prediction is that behavior will follow the plan, not the literal content of a thought (\"I am weak\"). The refutation is behavior dictated by the thought's content (accelerating to prove strength), which violates the plan and the value of protecting health. This is a perfect operationalization of defusion, contrasting value-guided behavior with thought-guided behavior. The refutation criterion ($>\\!120$ steps/min for $\\geq 5$ minutes) is a specific, observable measure of overexertion defined in the problem. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Present-Moment Awareness:** The prediction is that the participant will use real-time internal feedback (fatigue cues) to make flexible adjustments *within* the plan. The refutation is a state of rigid non-responsiveness to clear physiological warning signs (sustained high heart rate without adjustment). This correctly frames present-moment awareness as a functional process that guides effective action, not as a subjective state. The refutation criterion (heart rate $>\\!130\\,\\text{bpm}$ for $\\geq 10$ minutes) is specific and observable. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Self-as-Context:** This is arguably the most abstract ACT process. The option operationalizes it as the behavioral capacity to re-engage in valued action after being impacted by an aversive private event. A low probability of re-engagement refutes this. This is a sophisticated and appropriate behavioral translation. If the self is merely the sum of its difficult experiences (fusion), re-engagement is unlikely. If the self is the 'container' for those experiences, re-engagement is possible. The probabilistic refutation ($P(\\text{re-engage}) <\\!0.2$) is a strong, falsifiable hypothesis. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Values:** The prediction operationalizes the dual-component value (\"friendship\" and \"health\") with quantitative targets for both: time with the friend and adherence to the pacing plan. The refutation describes a clear failure on both components. This accurately translates an abstract value into measurable behaviors. The thresholds ($\\geq 0.8$, $<\\!0.5$) make the prediction falsifiable. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Committed Action:** The prediction captures the two key features of ACT's concept of committed action: persistence ($\\geq 0.8$ of cycles completed) and flexibility (or collaboratively revises the plan). This distinguishes it from rigid adherence. The refutation is a clear measure of giving up ($\\leq 0.2$ of cycles completed without attempts to revise or re-engage). This is an excellent translation. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nThis option provides a set of predictions that are fully consistent with ACT theory and are operationalized with specific, observable, and falsifiable criteria derived directly from the problem statement.\n\n#### Analysis of Option B\nThis option centers on symptom reduction.\n\n-   The predictions focus on reducing pain, decreasing the frequency of thoughts, and achieving a certain feeling state (\"feeling mindful\"). This is fundamentally at odds with the ACT model, which, as stated in the problem, treats private events \"as experiences rather than targets for elimination.\" ACT's goal is psychological flexibility, not symptom reduction. The final prediction, that values are satisfied only when discomfort is gone, is a direct contradiction of the principle of acceptance. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n#### Analysis of Option C\nThis option emphasizes cognitive control and thought suppression.\n\n-   The predictions involve suppressing thoughts, replacing them with positive self-talk, and acting to avoid \"looking weak.\" These are techniques associated with traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), not ACT. ACT promotes defusion (noticing thoughts without being controlled by them) and acceptance (allowing thoughts to be present without a struggle), which are the antithesis of thought suppression and cognitive restructuring. The prediction to avoid slowing down is a prediction of fusion, the opposite of the ACT target. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n#### Analysis of Option D\nThis option describes values-driven action as rigid, stoic endurance.\n\n-   The predictions involve never resting, pushing cadence into the overexertion zone, ignoring bodily cues, and pushing through safety limits. This represents a profound misinterpretation of \"committed action\" and \"acceptance.\" In ACT, committed action is flexible and guided by workability toward values. Here, the value explicitly includes \"protecting long-term health.\" The behaviors predicted in this option are inflexible, unworkable, and violate this value. Ignoring bodily cues is the opposite of present-moment awareness. Therefore, this option describes a pattern of psychological *in*flexibility. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is the only option that accurately translates the six core processes of ACT into empirically testable (falsifiable) behavioral predictions that are consistent with the theory's principles of psychological flexibility, acceptance, defusion, and values-based action. The predictions are tied directly to the observable and quantifiable data specified in the scenario. The other options misrepresent ACT as a symptom-reduction therapy (B), a thought-suppression therapy (C), or a therapy promoting rigid endurance (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4708347"}, {"introduction": "With a clear, operational understanding of ACT principles, we can now apply them to analyze complex clinical problems.

The patient reports frequently skipping doses on days with early meetings or workouts, stating, “I do not want to feel sick.” Over the past month, nonadherence has occurred on approximately half of days with anticipated morning obligations, but less frequently on weekends. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is being considered to address psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance.

The concepts of operant conditioning, functional analysis, Establishing Operations ($EO$), Discriminative Stimuli ($S^D$), negative reinforcement, and ACT are well-defined, evidence-based principles and frameworks used in clinical practice and research.

The theoretical terms used have objective, operational definitions within their scientific field. The patient's report is treated as verbal behavior, a datum to be analyzed within the functional context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Functional Account and Evaluation of Probes\n\nThe problem requires a functional analysis of medication nonadherence, conceptualized as an operant behavior maintained by negative reinforcement. The core components of a functional analysis are the Antecedent ($A$), the Behavior ($B$), and the Consequence ($C$).\n\n1.  **Behavior ($B$):** The target behavior is medication nonadherence, or *skipping the dose*.\n\n2.  **Consequence ($C$):** The problem specifies that the behavior is maintained by negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is a process where the probability of a behavior increases because it leads to the removal, reduction, or avoidance of an aversive stimulus. In this case, skipping the dose ($B$) results in the successful avoidance of the medication's side effects (nausea and fatigue). The aversive stimulus, denoted as $S^{-}$, is the physiological state of nausea and fatigue. Therefore, the immediate consequence of nonadherence is the avoidance of $S^{-}$.\n\n3.  **Antecedent ($A$):** Antecedents are the environmental or private events that precede the behavior and influence its probability. They are further divided into:\n    - **Establishing Operation ($EO$):** An $EO$ is a motivating variable that alters the value of a reinforcer. In negative reinforcement, the $EO$ increases the aversiveness of the stimulus to be avoided, thereby increasing the value of escape or avoidance. The problem states that nonadherence is higher on days with \"early meetings or workouts.\" These obligations create a context in which the experience of nausea and fatigue would be particularly debilitating or disruptive. Therefore, the presence of these morning obligations functions as an $EO$—it makes the prospect of feeling sick more aversive and thus makes avoiding that feeling more reinforcing. The patient's verbal behavior, \"I do not want to feel sick,\" when facing these obligations, confirms the increased aversiveness.\n    - **Discriminative Stimulus ($S^D$):** An $S^D$ is a stimulus that signals the availability of reinforcement for a specific behavior. Here, any cue that indicates it is time to take the medication (e.g., the time of day, a pill bottle, a calendar reminder) functions as an $S^D$. It signals that the A-B-C contingency is now in effect: the patient has the opportunity to engage in the avoidance behavior ($B$: skip the dose) to achieve the reinforcing consequence ($C$: avoid nausea).\n\nA parsimonious functional account is as follows:\n- **Antecedent ($A$):** In the context of cues for pill-taking ($S^D$), the presence of morning obligations ($EO$) increases the aversiveness of anticipated nausea and fatigue.\n- **Behavior ($B$):** The patient skips the medication dose.\n- **Consequence ($C$):** The patient avoids the immediate, aversive private events of nausea and fatigue (Negative Reinforcement).\n\nTestable probes should be experimental manipulations of the components of this A-B-C model to verify the hypothesized functional relationship.\n- **Manipulating $C$:** If avoidance of $S^-$ maintains the behavior, then removing or reducing $S^-$ should decrease the behavior.\n- **Manipulating the $EO$ in $A$:** If the $EO$ increases the value of avoiding $S^-$, then removing the $EO$ should decrease the behavior, while strengthening the $EO$ should increase it.\n- **Altering the function of $A$ (via ACT):** If the behavior is a form of experiential avoidance, then interventions that promote acceptance (willingness to experience the $S^-$ without acting to avoid it) should decouple the antecedent from the behavior, thus reducing nonadherence.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Antecedent ($A$): elevated side-effect expectancy and contextual cues (e.g., morning obligations) function as $EO$ increasing the aversiveness of post-dose nausea; $S^{D}$ includes pill-time reminders signaling side-effect risk. Behavior ($B$): skipping the dose. Consequence ($C$): removal or reduction of the near-term aversive state ($S^{-}$) of nausea/fatigue. Probes: (1) reduce side-effect magnitude by co-prescribing an antiemetic and observe whether the probability of $B$, denoted $p(B)$, decreases across an $A$–$B$–$A$–$B$ reversal; (2) intensify side-effect expectancy via credible warnings or interoceptive cue focus and test whether $p(B)$ increases; (3) implement ACT acceptance/willingness training to contact mild nausea while engaging values-consistent dosing, and test whether enhanced psychological flexibility reduces $p(B)$ without changing pharmacology; (4) vary dosing time to reduce $EO$ (e.g., evenings) and evaluate whether $p(B)$ covaries with $EO$ changes.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option presents a functional account that is perfectly aligned with the derivation above. It correctly identifies the $EO$ (morning obligations), the $S^D$ (pill-time cues), the behavior ($B$: skipping), and the consequence ($C$: negative reinforcement via avoidance of $S^{-}$). The proposed probes are a comprehensive and methodologically rigorous set of tests for this account. Probe (1) manipulates the consequence ($C$). Probes (2) and (4) manipulate the antecedent ($EO$ in $A$). Probe (3) proposes an ACT-consistent intervention that alters the function of the antecedents, directly testing the role of experiential avoidance. The use of an $A$–$B$–$A$–$B$ reversal design in probe (1) is a hallmark of rigorous single-case experimental design used in functional analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Antecedent ($A$): disease symptom severity functions as $EO$; $S^{D}$ is physician instruction to take the medication. Behavior ($B$): taking the dose. Consequence ($C$): reduction of disease symptoms via pharmacologic action. Probes: increase disease symptom salience through education and symptom monitoring; add reward for adherence; test whether adherence rises. If adherence increases, conclude the behavior is maintained by positive reinforcement from symptom relief.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option analyzes the wrong behavior. It focuses on *adherence* ($B$: taking the dose) rather than *nonadherence* ($B$: skipping the dose), which was the specified target. Consequently, it describes the competing contingency (negative reinforcement for taking the pill via symptom reduction) rather than the contingency hypothesized to maintain nonadherence. The probes are designed to increase adherence, not to test why nonadherence occurs.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Antecedent ($A$): lack of knowledge about the importance of adherence; $S^{D}$ includes educational materials. Behavior ($B$): skipping due to misunderstanding. Consequence ($C$): no immediate change. Probes: provide detailed psychoeducation and reminders; measure whether knowledge gain reduces nonadherence. If nonadherence persists, infer the behavior is not rule-governed and unrelated to side effects.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option abandons the requested operant conditioning framework in favor of a cognitive/educational deficit model. This is inconsistent with the principles of functional analysis, which prioritizes the analysis of observable A-B-C contingencies. The patient's behavior is clearly context-dependent (obligations vs. weekends), which strongly suggests it is contingency-shaped, not simply a result of a uniform lack of knowledge.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Antecedent ($A$): pill-related cues act as conditioned stimuli ($CS$) eliciting anticipatory nausea via classical conditioning. Behavior ($B$): avoidance of the pill. Consequence ($C$): extinction of conditioned nausea by avoiding the $CS$. Probes: pair the pill-taking context with pleasant stimuli to countercondition; if nonadherence falls, conclude classical conditioning is primary rather than operant negative reinforcement.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option incorrectly substitutes a classical (respondent) conditioning model for the requested operant one. While anticipatory nausea likely does involve classical conditioning, the patient's behavior (skipping the dose) is an operant, and its variability based on the $EO$ (morning obligations) is a key feature that is best explained by an operant model. The problem explicitly asks for an operant (functional) analysis, and this option fails to provide it as the primary account.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Antecedent ($A$): social disapproval for appearing ill; $S^{D}$ is presence of coworkers. Behavior ($B$): skipping the dose. Consequence ($C$): avoidance of social cost (negative punishment of taking the dose). Probes: arrange private dosing and conceal side effects; if adherence rises, infer the behavior is maintained by avoidance of social punishment rather than side-effect-driven negative reinforcement.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes an alternative functional hypothesis that is not the most parsimonious account given the data. It assumes the aversive stimulus is social disapproval, not the direct physiological experience of nausea. The patient's verbal report (\"I do not want to feel sick\") points more directly to the private experience. While social factors could contribute, the problem asks for an analysis based on \"avoidance of side effects,\" which this option reinterprets as avoidance of the social consequences of side effects.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first step is to compute the post-minus-pre difference score, $D_i$, for each of the $n=12$ participants. Let $Y_i$ be the follow-up score and $X_i$ be the baseline score for participant $i$. The difference is $D_i = Y_i - X_i$.\n\n- $D_1 = 4{,}200 - 3{,}000 = 1{,}200$\n- $D_2 = 5{,}400 - 5{,}500 = -100$\n- $D_3 = 3{,}400 - 2{,}800 = 600$\n- $D_4 = 5{,}000 - 4{,}700 = 300$\n- $D_5 = 4{,}600 - 3{,}200 = 1{,}400$\n- $D_6 = 4{,}800 - 4{,}000 = 800$\n- $D_7 = 3{,}900 - 4{,}100 = -200$\n- $D_8 = 4{,}200 - 3{,}300 = 900$\n- $D_9 = 5{,}500 - 5{,}000 = 500$\n- $D_{10} = 3{,}600 - 3{,}600 = 0$\n- $D_{11} = 5{,}000 - 4{,}300 = 700$\n- $D_{12} = 3{,}300 - 2{,}900 = 400$\n\nThe set of difference scores is $\\{1200, -100, 600, 300, 1400, 800, -200, 900, 500, 0, 700, 400\\}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sample mean of these difference scores, $\\bar{D}$.\n$$ \\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i $$\nThe sum of the differences is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} D_i = 1200 - 100 + 600 + 300 + 1400 + 800 - 200 + 900 + 500 + 0 + 700 + 400 = 6{,}500 $$\nThe sample mean is:\n$$ \\bar{D} = \\frac{6{,}500}{12} = \\frac{1{,}625}{3} \\approx 541.67 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the sample standard deviation of the difference scores, $s_D$. The formula for the sample variance, $s_D^2$, is:\n$$ s_D^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (D_i - \\bar{D})^2 $$\nUsing the computational formula for the sum of squared deviations is often more efficient:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (D_i - \\bar{D})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i)^2}{n} $$\nFirst, we find the sum of the squares of the differences, $\\sum D_i^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} D_i^2 = 1200^2 + (-100)^2 + 600^2 + 300^2 + 1400^2 + 800^2 + (-200)^2 + 900^2 + 500^2 + 0^2 + 700^2 + 400^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} D_i^2 = 1{,}440{,}000 + 10{,}000 + 360{,}000 + 90{,}000 + 1{,}960{,}000 + 640{,}000 + 40{,}000 + 810{,}000 + 250{,}000 + 0 + 490{,}000 + 160{,}000 = 6{,}250{,}000 $$\nNow, we compute the sum of squared deviations:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} (D_i - \\bar{D})^2 = 6{,}250{,}000 - \\frac{(6{,}500)^2}{12} = 6{,}250{,}000 - \\frac{42{,}250{,}000}{12} = \\frac{75{,}000{,}000 - 42{,}250{,}000}{12} = \\frac{32{,}750{,}000}{12} = \\frac{8{,}187{,}500}{3} $$\nThe sample variance is:\n$$ s_D^2 = \\frac{1}{12-1} \\left( \\frac{8{,}187{,}500}{3} \\right) = \\frac{8{,}187{,}500}{33} \\approx 248{,}106.06 $$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$ s_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{8{,}187{,}500}{33}} \\approx 498.10246 $$\n\nNow we can compute Cohen's $d_z$, which is defined as the sample mean of the differences divided by the sample standard deviation of the differences.\n$$ d_z = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_D} = \\frac{1625/3}{\\sqrt{8187500/33}} \\approx \\frac{541.66667}{498.10246} \\approx 1.087458 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $d_z \\approx 1.087$.\n\nFinally, we compute the paired-samples $t$-statistic. The formula is:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{D} - \\mu_{D,0}}{s_E} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{D,0}$ is the population mean difference under the null hypothesis ($H_0: \\mu_D=0$, so $\\mu_{D,0}=0$), and $s_E$ is the standard error of the mean difference, given by $s_E = s_D/\\sqrt{n}$.\n$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_D / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{\\bar{D}\\sqrt{n}}{s_D} $$\nNotice that this is also equal to $d_z \\sqrt{n}$. Using this relationship:\n$$ t = d_z \\sqrt{n} \\approx 1.087458 \\times \\sqrt{12} \\approx 1.087458 \\times 3.4641016 \\approx 3.76706 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t \\approx 3.767$.\nThe degrees of freedom for this test are $df = n-1 = 12-1 = 11$. For a one-tailed test with $\\alpha=0.05$, the critical value for $t_{11}$ is $1.796$. Since our calculated $t$-statistic of $3.767$ is greater than this critical value, the result is statistically significant, indicating that the ACT program led to a significant increase in daily steps. This interpretation, however, is not required by the problem statement.\n\nThe required values rounded to four significant figures are:\n- $d_z = 1.087$\n- $t = 3.767$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.087 & 3.767 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4708339"}]}
