It describes a standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, a common intervention (MBSR), a valid biomarker (CRP), and a standard statistical analysis (Cohen's $d$). The values provided are plausible for CRP changes in such a study. This is a realistic scientific problem.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary information to compute Cohen's $d$ is provided: two means and the appropriate standardizer (the pooled standard deviation). The instructions are clear and lead to a unique numerical solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is presented objectively, providing research findings and asking for a specific calculation and interpretation based on established statistical conventions.\n- **Complete and Consistent:** The data are complete and dimensionally consistent. The means and standard deviation are all in units of $\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, which will cancel out correctly to produce the required unitless effect size.\n- **Other criteria:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard application of statistical principles to research data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of Cohen's $d$, which is a measure of standardized mean difference between two groups. The formula for Cohen's $d$ using a pooled standard deviation is given by:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}_1$ and $\\bar{x}_2$ are the means of the two groups, and $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation.\n\nIn this problem, the two groups are the MBSR intervention group and the wait-list control group. We are given the mean changes in CRP for both groups. Let's assign group $1$ to be the MBSR group and group $2$ to be the control group.\nThe givens are:\n- Mean change for the MBSR group, $\\bar{x}_{\\text{MBSR}} = -0.48$.\n- Mean change for the control group, $\\bar{x}_{\\text{control}} = -0.12$.\n- The pooled standard deviation of the change scores, $s_p = 0.72$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for Cohen's $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{MBSR}} - \\bar{x}_{\\text{control}}}{s_p}$$\n$$d = \\frac{-0.48 - (-0.12)}{0.72}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the difference in the mean changes between the two groups:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = -0.48 + 0.12 = -0.36$$\n\nNext, we divide this difference by the pooled standard deviation:\n$$d = \\frac{-0.36}{0.72}$$\n$$d = -0.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $-0.5$. To express this with $3$ significant figures, we write it as $-0.500$.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe calculated Cohen's $d$ is $-0.500$. We are asked to interpret both the sign and the magnitude of this effect.\n\n**Sign:** The sign of Cohen's $d$ is negative. This indicates that the mean of the first group ($\\bar{x}_{\\text{MBSR}}$) is less than the mean of the second group ($\\bar{x}_{\\text{control}}$). Since the outcome is the change in CRP, where negative values indicate a reduction in the inflammatory marker, a more negative mean change signifies a better outcome (i.e., a greater reduction in inflammation). The fact that $d < 0$ means the MBSR group experienced a larger average reduction in CRP compared to the control group. This finding is in the direction that would be hypothesized for an effective stress-reduction intervention.\n\n**Magnitude:** The magnitude of the effect is $|d| = |-0.500| = 0.500$. By conventional benchmarks for interpreting Cohen's $d$:\n- $|d| \\approx 0.2$ is considered a \"small\" effect.\n- $|d| \\approx 0.5$ is considered a \"medium\" effect.\n- $|d| \\approx 0.8$ is considered a \"large\" effect.\n\nOur value of $0.500$ falls exactly at the benchmark for a medium effect size.\n\n**Clinical Context:** In the context of stress-related inflammation, a Cohen's $d$ of $-0.500$ suggests that the MBSR intervention had a medium-sized effect on reducing C-reactive protein levels over an $8$-week period compared to a wait-list control. This implies a clinically and statistically meaningful difference, suggesting that MBSR is moderately effective in this population for this specific biomarker of inflammation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.500}$$", "id": "4725146"}, {"introduction": "While effect sizes are valuable for researchers, clinicians and patients often ask a more direct question: 'How many people must receive this treatment for one person to benefit?' This exercise introduces the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$), a powerful biostatistical tool that provides a clear and intuitive answer to this question. By calculating the $NNT$ from hypothetical remission data, you will translate the results of a clinical trial into a metric with direct real-world relevance for evaluating the efficiency of MBSR [@problem_id:4725167].", "problem": "A randomized controlled trial in medical psychology compares Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to usual care for adults with clinically significant anxiety. The event of interest is remission at post-treatment. Let the absolute risk (probability) of remission under MBSR be $p_{t}$ and under usual care be $p_{c}$. The absolute risk reduction is defined as $ARR = p_{t} - p_{c}$. The number needed to treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients who would need to receive MBSR, instead of usual care, to obtain one additional remission attributable to MBSR. Assume that outcomes are independent across patients and that the treatment effect is stable across individuals over the horizon of interest.\n\nIn a particular sample, the observed remission probabilities are $p_{t} = 0.35$ for MBSR and $p_{c} = 0.20$ for usual care. Starting from the above definitions and first principles of expected values, derive an expression for NNT in terms of $p_{t}$ and $p_{c}$, and compute its exact value for these data. Briefly comment on the clinical relevance of the resulting NNT in this context. Provide the final numeric answer as an exact reduced fraction with no rounding and no units.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard biostatistical principles (Absolute Risk Reduction, Number Needed to Treat), well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients who must receive the treatment (MBSR) instead of the control (usual care) for one additional patient to experience remission. Let $p_t$ be the probability of remission with the treatment and $p_c$ be the probability of remission with the control. For any single patient switched from control to treatment, the increase in the probability of remission is the Absolute Risk Reduction, $ARR = p_t - p_c$. We can conceptualize this as a probabilistic \"success.\"\n\nLet us define a \"success\" as observing one additional remission that is attributable solely to the new treatment. The probability of such a success for any given patient who receives the treatment instead of the control is $p = ARR = p_t - p_c$. We assume that patient outcomes are independent events.\n\nThe problem of finding the expected number of patients one needs to treat to achieve the first success is a classic problem in probability theory. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of patients treated until the first success (the first additional remission) is observed. The variable $K$ follows a geometric distribution. The probability mass function of a geometric distribution is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of trials (patients treated) and $p$ is the probability of success on each trial. Here, $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe NNT corresponds to the expected value of this random variable $K$, denoted $E[K]$. The expected value of a geometrically distributed random variable is the inverse of the success probability. We can derive this from first principles as follows:\n$$E[K] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k(1-p)^{k-1}p$$\nWe can factor out the constant $p$:\n$$E[K] = p \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k(1-p)^{k-1}$$\nThe sum is a known series related to the derivative of a geometric series. Let $q = 1-p$. The sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1}$.\nRecall the formula for a geometric series:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k = \\frac{1}{1-q}$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $q$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k \\right) = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-q} \\right)$$\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E[K]$:\n$$E[K] = p \\left( \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2} \\right)$$\nSince $q = 1-p$, we have $1-q = 1-(1-p) = p$. Therefore:\n$$E[K] = p \\left( \\frac{1}{p^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nBy definition, $NNT = E[K]$, and the success probability $p$ is the Absolute Risk Reduction, $ARR$. Thus, the expression for NNT is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{p_t - p_c}$$\n\nNow, we compute the value of NNT using the provided data: $p_t = 0.35$ and $p_c = 0.20$.\nFirst, we calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$):\n$$ARR = p_t - p_c = 0.35 - 0.20 = 0.15$$\nNext, we calculate the NNT:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.15}$$\nTo express this as an exact reduced fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$0.15 = \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{20 \\times 5} = \\frac{3}{20}$$\nTherefore, the NNT is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{20}} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\n\nRegarding the clinical relevance: The calculated NNT is $\\frac{20}{3}$, which is approximately $6.67$. In clinical practice, NNT is typically rounded up to the nearest integer, so we would interpret this as an NNT of $7$. This means that a clinician would need to treat $7$ patients with MBSR, instead of providing usual care, to expect one additional remission from anxiety. An NNT of $7$ is considered to represent a moderately effective intervention. This quantitative measure is highly valuable as it provides a clear and intuitive metric for clinicians, patients, and policymakers to assess the real-world efficiency of a therapy and weigh its benefits against costs and potential burdens.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$$", "id": "4725167"}, {"introduction": "In any intervention, understanding the relationship between the 'dose' of the treatment and the 'response' is critical, a concept often explored in hypothetical exercises to illustrate the principle.
