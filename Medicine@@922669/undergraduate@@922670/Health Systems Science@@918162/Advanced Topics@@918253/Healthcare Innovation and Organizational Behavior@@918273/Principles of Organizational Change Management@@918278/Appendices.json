To support organizational change management, the improvement team decides to implement Statistical Process Control (SPC), specifically a proportion chart (“$p$-chart”), to detect special-cause variation in monthly falls rates and determine whether subsequent changes should be adapted, adopted, or abandoned. Assume the following foundational model: each patient-day can be treated as a Bernoulli trial with “fall” or “no fall,” monthly samples are independent with constant size, and common-cause variation is well-approximated by the binomial distribution.\n\nDuring a six-month baseline, the unit reports a constant monthly sample size of $n=200$ patient-days and monthly falls counts (number of patient-days with at least one documented fall) of $8$, $12$, $11$, $7$, $9$, and $13$.

The theoretical foundation for a $p$-chart is the binomial distribution, which is appropriate given the problem's explicit assumption that each patient-day is an independent Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: \"fall\" or \"no fall.\"\n\nFirst, we must establish a stable estimate of the process's central tendency. This is the average proportion of falls, denoted as $\\bar{p}$, which will serve as the center line (CL) for the control chart. This estimate is derived from the baseline data collected over $k=6$ months.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Monthly sample size (number of patient-days), $n=200$.\n- Number of baseline samples, $k=6$.\n- Monthly fall counts, $c_i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 6\\}$: $8, 12, 11, 7, 9, 13$.\n\nThe total number of falls during the baseline period is the sum of the monthly counts:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i = 8 + 12 + 11 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 60 $$\n\nThe total number of patient-days observed during this period is the product of the number of samples and the constant sample size per month:\n$$ N_{total} = k \\times n = 6 \\times 200 = 1200 $$\n\nThe average proportion of falls, $\\bar{p}$, is the ratio of the total number of falls to the total number of patient-days:\n$$ \\bar{p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i}{N_{total}} = \\frac{60}{1200} = 0.05 $$\nThis value, $\\bar{p} = 0.05$, constitutes the center line (CL) of the $p$-chart.\n\nNext, we must quantify the expected process variation. For a binomial process, the variance of the proportion of events in a sample of size $n$ is given by $\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$, where $p$ is the true process proportion. We estimate this variance by substituting our calculated average proportion $\\bar{p}$ for the unknown $p$.

Cluster-Robust Standard Error\n\nThe problem requires a standard error that is robust to arbitrary correlation of outcomes within each unit (cluster). The \"cluster-robust sandwich variance logic\" for the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y$ leads to the variance estimator $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}_{CR}(\\hat{\\beta}) = (X'X)^{-1} \\left( \\sum_{g=1}^{G} X_g' \\hat{u}_g \\hat{u}_g' X_g \\right) (X'X)^{-1}$, where $g$ indexes clusters, $X_g$ is the matrix of regressors for cluster $g$, and $\\hat{u}_g$ is the vector of OLS residuals for cluster $g$.\n\nFor this specific balanced DiD design, this complex formula is equivalent to a more intuitive two-stage approach. This equivalence provides the principled \"reasoning to a computation\" requested.\n\n**Step 1: Aggregate data to the cluster level.**\nThe OLS DiD estimator can be rewritten as the difference in the mean change between the intervention and control groups. Let $D_g = \\bar{Y}_{g,post} - \\bar{Y}_{g,pre}$ be the average change in outcome for unit $g$.\nThen $\\hat{\\beta}_3 = \\bar{D}_I - \\bar{D}_C$, where $\\bar{D}_I$ is the mean of $D_g$ for intervention units and $\\bar{D}_C$ is the mean for control units.\n\nFirst, we compute the change score $D_g$ for each of the $G=8$ units.\n- $I_1$: $D_1 = \\frac{12.9}{6} - \\frac{24.6}{6} = 2.15 - 4.1 = -1.95$\n- $I_2$: $D_2 = \\frac{11.9}{6} - \\frac{23.3}{6} \\approx 1.9833 - 3.8833 = -1.9$\n- $I_3$: $D_3 = \\frac{14.7}{6} - \\frac{27.0}{6} = 2.45 - 4.5 = -2.05$\n- $I_4$: $D_4 = \\frac{13.0}{6} - \\frac{24.0}{6} \\approx 2.1667 - 4.0 = -\\frac{11}{6} \\approx -1.8333$\n\n- $C_1$: $D_5 = \\frac{23.7}{6} - \\frac{24.3}{6} = 3.95 - 4.05 = -0.1$\n- $C_2$: $D_6 = \\frac{22.0}{6} - \\frac{22.7}{6} = -\\frac{0.7}{6} \\approx -0.1167$\n- $C_3$: $D_7 = \\frac{25.6}{6} - \\frac{26.1}{6} = -\\frac{0.5}{6} \\approx -0.0833$\n- $C_4$: $D_8 = \\frac{22.6}{6} - \\frac{23.1}{6} = -\\frac{0.5}{6} \\approx -0.0833$\n\n**Step 2: Compute variance based on cluster-level variation.**\nThe estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_3 = \\bar{D}_I - \\bar{D}_C$ is a difference in two sample means, based on $n_I=4$ and $n_C=4$ clusters. Because the clusters are independent, the variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{D}_I) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{D}_C)$.\nThe core of cluster-robust reasoning is that inference is based on the variability *between* clusters. A natural and robust estimator for this variance, which does not assume homoscedasticity between the treatment and control groups, is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = \\frac{s_{D_I}^2}{n_I} + \\frac{s_{D_C}^2}{n_C} $$\nwhere $s_{D_I}^2$ and $s_{D_C}^2$ are the sample variances of the change scores $D_g$ within the intervention and control groups, respectively.\n\n**Calculations for Variances:**\n- **Intervention Group:** $D_I = \\{-1.95, -1.9, -2.05, -11/6\\}$.\n  Mean: $\\bar{D}_I = \\frac{-1.95 - 1.9 - 2.05 - 11/6}{4} = \\frac{-5.9 - 11/6}{4} = \\frac{-35.4/6 - 11/6}{4} = \\frac{-46.4/6}{4} = -\\frac{46.4}{24} \\approx -1.9333$.\n  Sum of squared deviations: $(-1.95 - \\bar{D}_I)^2 + (-1.9 - \\bar{D}_I)^2 + (-2.05 - \\bar{D}_I)^2 + (-11/6 - \\bar{D}_I)^2$.
