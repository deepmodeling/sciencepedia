When a behavioral nudge is implemented, we need to move beyond saying \"it worked\" to quantifying exactly how large the effect was. This exercise introduces two fundamental metrics from epidemiology, relative risk ($RR$) and risk difference ($RD$), that allow us to precisely measure the effectiveness of an intervention designed to counter a cognitive bias like omission bias [@problem_id:4361478]. Mastering this skill is crucial for comparing the effectiveness of different programs and making evidence-based decisions.", "problem": "A health system is testing a behavioral \"nudge\" designed to counteract omission bias, the tendency to prefer harm from inaction over equivalent harm from action. In a medication adherence program for patients with hypertension, baseline adherence (without the nudge) is observed to be $0.60$. After implementing an opt-out refill and reminder system that targets omission bias, adherence increases to $0.72$. Using fundamental definitions from probability and epidemiology within health systems science, compute the relative risk of adherence and the risk difference of adherence for the intervention compared to the baseline. Then, interpret the clinical significance of these metrics in terms of expected changes in adherence per $100$ patients and briefly justify why countering omission bias is a plausible mechanism for the observed change. Express both the relative risk and the risk difference as decimals (not with a percentage sign), and round your numerical results to four significant figures.", "solution": "The user-provided problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Baseline medication adherence (control group): $P_{baseline} = 0.60$\n- Adherence with intervention (intervention group): $P_{intervention} = 0.72$\n- Intervention: An opt-out refill and reminder system targeting omission bias.\n- Required computations:\n    1.

The concepts of medication adherence, omission bias, behavioral nudges (specifically opt-out systems), relative risk, and risk difference are all well-established and central to the fields of health systems science, epidemiology, and behavioral economics. The provided adherence rates are realistic probabilities.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the defined epidemiological metrics.

A solution will be generated.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation and interpretation of two fundamental epidemiological metrics: relative risk ($RR$) and risk difference ($RD$), in the context of a behavioral intervention to improve medication adherence.\n\nLet $P_{intervention}$ represent the probability of adherence in the group receiving the intervention (the \"nudge\"), and let $P_{baseline}$ represent the probability of adherence in the baseline group (without the intervention). From the problem statement, we have:\n$$P_{intervention} = 0.72$$\n$$P_{baseline} = 0.60$$\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Risk ($RR$)**\n\nThe relative risk is the ratio of the risk (in this case, the probability of adherence) in the intervention group to the risk in the baseline group. It quantifies how many times more likely the outcome is in the intervention group compared to the control group.\n\nThe formula for relative risk is:\n$$RR = \\frac{P_{intervention}}{P_{baseline}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.72}{0.60} = 1.2$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the relative risk is $1.200$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Risk Difference ($RD$)**\n\nThe risk difference, also known as the absolute risk increase, is the simple arithmetic difference in the risk of the outcome between the two groups. It provides a measure of the absolute effect of the intervention.\n\nThe formula for risk difference is:\n$$RD = P_{intervention} - P_{baseline}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RD = 0.72 - 0.60 = 0.12$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the risk difference is $0.1200$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of Clinical Significance**\n\n- **Relative Risk ($RR = 1.200$):** This value indicates that patients in the intervention group are $1.2$ times, or $20\\%$ more likely, to be adherent to their medication regimen compared to patients under baseline conditions. While this metric is useful for understanding the relative magnitude of the effect, it does not convey the absolute impact on the patient population.\n\n- **Risk Difference ($RD = 0.1200$):** This value has a more direct clinical interpretation. It represents an absolute increase of $0.12$ in the probability of adherence due to the intervention. To interpret this in terms of the number of patients, we can consider a cohort of $100$ patients. The $RD$ predicts the number of additional people who would experience the outcome in the intervention group. Therefore, for every $100$ patients who are part of the opt-out system, we would expect $100 \\times RD = 100 \\times 0.1200 = 12$ additional patients to be adherent compared to what would be observed under the baseline system. This metric is often more valuable for health system planning and resource allocation. It can also be used to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (or in this case, \"Number Needed to Nudge\") which is the reciprocal of the $RD$: $1/0.1200 \\approx 8.33$. This means that approximately $8$ patients need to receive the intervention for one additional patient to become adherent.\n\n**4. Justification of the Mechanism (Omission Bias)**\n\nOmission bias is a cognitive bias describing the tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful inactions (omissions). In the baseline scenario, adherence requires a series of active choices: a patient must decide to request a refill and decide to take the medication each day. Non-adherence is the default outcome if the patient does nothing; it is an omission.\n\nThe \"opt-out\" intervention fundamentally restructures the choice architecture. By automating refills and sending reminders, adherence becomes the new default state. In this system, non-adherence requires a deliberate action from the patient: they must actively choose to cancel the refill or ignore the reminder and not take the pill. The psychological burden is shifted. The inaction (omission) now leads to adherence, while non-adherence requires an action (commission). By making the desired behavior the path of least resistance, the intervention leverages the patient's potential omission bias to promote adherence rather than hinder it. A patient who might have passively failed to refill their prescription under the old system is now more likely to passively accept the automatic refill under the new one. Thus, countering (or more accurately, coopting) omission bias by changing the default is a highly plausible mechanism for the observed increase in medication adherence from $0.60$ to $0.72$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.200  0.1200 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4361478"}, {"introduction": "After quantifying an intervention's effect, the next step is often to communicate its practical efficiency to stakeholders. A percentage change can feel abstract, but a metric that describes the real-world effort needed to achieve one successful outcome is incredibly powerful. This practice introduces the \"Number Needed to Nudge\" (NNN), a concept adapted from the clinical \"Number Needed to Treat,\" which translates an absolute probability reduction into an intuitive and actionable number. By deriving and calculating the NNN, you will learn how to frame the impact of a nudge in a way that directly informs operational planning and resource allocation [@problem_id:4361462].", "problem": "A hospital implements a default ordering nudge within its electronic health record to reduce inappropriate outpatient antibiotic prescribing by subtly steering clinicians toward guideline-concordant choices. Let the baseline probability of an inappropriate antibiotic course per eligible visit be $p_{0} = 0.25$, and suppose the nudge produces a constant absolute reduction in this probability of $\\Delta = 0.05$ for each nudged clinician-patient encounter. Assume encounters are independent and that the effect of the nudge (the absolute reduction $\\Delta$) is the same across encounters.\n\nDefine the Number Needed to Nudge (NNN) as the expected number of nudged encounters required to avert one inappropriate antibiotic course due solely to the nudge. Starting from the core definitions of probability, expectation for Bernoulli events, and absolute risk reduction (difference in event probabilities), derive an expression for NNN in terms of $\\Delta$. Then compute NNN for the given parameters $p_{0} = 0.25$ and $\\Delta = 0.05$.\n\nExpress your final answer as an exact integer (no rounding). No units are required in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Number Needed to Nudge (NNN) and its subsequent calculation based on provided parameters. The NNN is defined as the expected number of nudged encounters required to avert one inappropriate antibiotic course. We shall proceed by formalizing the probabilistic framework.\n\nLet $p_0$ represent the baseline probability of an inappropriate antibiotic course per eligible visit. The problem statement gives this value as $p_{0} = 0.25$.\nLet $p_1$ be the probability of an inappropriate antibiotic course in an encounter where the nudge is active.\nThe problem defines $\\Delta$ as the constant absolute reduction in this probability due to the nudge. Mathematically, this is expressed as the absolute risk reduction (ARR):\n$$ \\Delta = p_0 - p_1 $$\nWe are given $\\Delta = 0.05$. From this, we can calculate the probability of an inappropriate course with the nudge as:\n$$ p_1 = p_0 - \\Delta = 0.25 - 0.05 = 0.20 $$\nThis is a valid probability as it lies within the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nThe event of a single nudged encounter \"averting an inappropriate course\" corresponds to a success in a conceptual trial. The probability of this success, let's call it $p_{\\text{success}}$, is the reduction in the event rate attributable to the intervention. Over a large number of encounters, $N$, the expected number of inappropriate courses without the nudge is $N p_0$, and with the nudge is $N p_1$. The expected number of averted courses is the difference:\n$$ \\text{Expected averted courses in } N \\text{ encounters} = N p_0 - N p_1 = N(p_0 - p_1) = N\\Delta $$\nThe probability of averting a course in any single encounter is the expected number of averted courses divided by the number of encounters:\n$$ p_{\\text{success}} = \\frac{N\\Delta}{N} = \\Delta $$\nEach nudged encounter is an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $\\Delta$.\n\nThe NNN is the expected number of trials (encounters) required to achieve the first success. This is formally the expectation of a geometric distribution. Let $K$ be a random variable representing the number of encounters until the first inappropriate course is averted. The probability mass function of $K$ is:\n$$ P(K=k) = (1 - p_{\\text{success}})^{k-1} p_{\\text{success}} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} $$\nThe expected value of a random variable $K$ that follows a geometric distribution is given by the reciprocal of the success probability:\n$$ E[K] = \\frac{1}{p_{\\text{success}}} $$\nBy definition, the NNN is this expected value, $E[K]$. Substituting $p_{\\text{success}} = \\Delta$, we arrive at the general expression for NNN:\n$$ \\text{NNN} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} $$\nThis shows that the NNN is the reciprocal of the absolute reduction in probability, a principle identical to the one for the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in epidemiology.\n\nNow, we must compute the specific value of NNN using the given data. The problem states that the absolute reduction is $\\Delta = 0.05$.\nSubstituting this value into the derived formula:\n$$ \\text{NNN} = \\frac{1}{0.05} $$\nTo calculate this, we can express the denominator as a fraction:\n$$ 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20} $$\nTherefore, the NNN is:\n$$ \\text{NNN} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{20}} = 20 $$\nThus, the expected number of nudged encounters required to avert one inappropriate antibiotic course is $20$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4361462"}, {"introduction": "We know that changing the default option can dramatically influence choices, but a key question in behavioral economics is *why* defaults are so \"sticky.\" This stickiness is often attributed to unobserved psychological forces like inertia or the \"hassle\" of opting out, collectively known as switching costs. This advanced exercise uses the powerful economic logic of revealed preference to work backward from observed choices. By analyzing how enrollment rates change when a default is switched from opt-in to opt-out, you can place a quantitative bound on these hidden switching costs, providing a deeper insight into the mechanics of choice architecture [@problem_id:4361494].", "problem": "A large integrated delivery system pilots a change in the default for its automatic medication refill program.

They satisfy $\\Delta u_i \\le c_i$ (do not enroll in opt-in) and $\\Delta u_i  -c_i$ (opt out from enrollment). The second condition, $\\Delta u_i  -c_i$, is stricter and implies the first (since $c_i \\ge 0$).

This group is characterized by the condition:\n    $$-c_i \\le \\Delta u_i \\le c_i \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad |\\Delta u_i| \\le c_i$$\n    The share of this group is the remainder of the population:\n    $$P(\\text{Default-Adherers}) = 1 - P(\\text{Always-Takers}) - P(\\text{Never-Takers}) = 1 - 0.40 - 0.15 = 0.45$$\n\nThe population-average switching cost, $\\bar{c} = \\mathbb{E}[c_i]$, can be expressed as the weighted sum of the conditional average switching costs for each group:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\mathbb{E}[c_i] = \\sum_{j \\in \\{\\text{groups}\\}} \\mathbb{E}[c_i | i \\in j] \\cdot P(j)$$\n$$\\bar{c} = \\mathbb{E}[c_i | \\text{Always-Takers}] \\cdot 0.40 + \\mathbb{E}[c_i | \\text{Never-Takers}] \\cdot 0.15 + \\mathbb{E}[c_i | \\text{Default-Adherers}] \\cdot 0.45$$\n\nTo find the tightest lower bound on $\\bar{c}$, we must find the tightest lower bound for each conditional expectation.\n-   For Always-Takers ($\\Delta u_i  c_i$) and Never-Takers ($\\Delta u_i  -c_i$), the only universal constraint on $c_i$ is $c_i \\ge 0$.

We are also told that the set of patients with exact indifference, $\\Delta u_i = 0$, has measure zero, meaning it does not contribute to the population average.\n    Therefore, for any patient in the Default-Adherer group, we can consider their $\\Delta u_i$ to be non-zero. This means for every patient $i$ in this group, the following chain of inequalities holds:\n    $$c_i \\ge |\\Delta u_i| \\ge 4$$\n    Since every patient in this group has a switching cost of at least $4$, the conditional expectation for this group must also be at least $4$.\n    $$\\mathbb{E}[c_i | \\text{Default-Adherers}] \\ge 4$$\n\nNow, we substitute these lower bounds back into the equation for $\\bar{c}$:\n$$\\bar{c} \\ge (0) \\cdot 0.40 + (0) \\cdot 0.15 + (4) \\cdot 0.45$$\n$$\\bar{c} \\ge 0 + 0 + 1.8$$\n$$\\bar{c} \\ge 1.8$$\nThe tightest lower bound is therefore $1.8$ U.S. dollars per month.
