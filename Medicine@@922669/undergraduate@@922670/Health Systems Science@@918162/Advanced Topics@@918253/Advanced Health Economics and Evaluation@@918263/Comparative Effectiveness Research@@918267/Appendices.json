You are told the following aggregated outcomes for unique patients in each period:\n- Treated group $A$, pre period: $1{,}200$ patients with $180$ readmissions within $30$ days.\n- Treated group $A$, post period: $1{,}300$ patients with $156$ readmissions within $30$ days.\n- Control group $B$, pre period: $900$ patients with $99$ readmissions within $30$ days.\n- Control group $B$, post period: $1{,}000$ patients with $120$ readmissions within $30$ days.\n\nUsing the framework of potential outcomes and the definition of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and invoking only assumptions that are standard in difference-in-differences, compute the difference-in-differences estimate of the causal effect of the program on the $30$-day readmission probability in the post period for the treated group.

Let $i$ index an individual patient and $t$ index the time period, where $t \\in \\{pre, post\\}$. Let $G_i$ be an indicator for the group, where $G_i=A$ for the treated group and $G_i=B$ for the control group. The treatment, a care coordination program, is administered to group $A$ only in the $post$ period.\n\nThe potential outcomes for a patient $i$ at time $t$ are:\n- $Y_{i,t}(1)$: the outcome (here, a binary indicator for readmission, where $1$ is a readmission and $0$ is not) if patient $i$ at time $t$ is exposed to the program.\n- $Y_{i,t}(0)$: the outcome if patient $i$ at time $t$ is not exposed to the program.\n\nThe observed outcome for any patient is $Y_{i,t}$. Since group $B$ is never treated and group $A$ is only treated in the $post$ period, the observed outcomes relate to the potential outcomes as follows:\n- For group $A$ ($G_i=A$) in the $pre$ period: $Y_{i,pre} = Y_{i,pre}(0)$.\n- For group $A$ ($G_i=A$) in the $post$ period: $Y_{i,post} = Y_{i,post}(1)$.\n- For group $B$ ($G_i=B$) in both periods: $Y_{i,pre} = Y_{i,pre}(0)$ and $Y_{i,post} = Y_{i,post}(0)$.\n\nThe parameter of interest is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) in the $post$ period. This is defined as the expected difference between the potential outcome under treatment and the potential outcome under no treatment, for those who were actually treated.\n$$\nATT_{post} = E[Y_{post}(1) | G=A] - E[Y_{post}(0) | G=A]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[Y_{post}(1) | G=A]$, is the expected readmission rate for the treated group in the post-period, given they received the treatment. This is factually observed.\nThe second term, $E[Y_{post}(0) | G=A]$, is the expected readmission rate for the treated group in the post-period *had they not received the treatment*. This is an unobservable counterfactual.\n\nThe difference-in-differences method allows us to estimate this counterfactual by invoking the parallel trends assumption. This assumption states that the average change in the outcome from the pre-period to the post-period for the treated group, had they not been treated, would have been the same as the average change in the outcome for the control group. Formally:\n$$\nE[Y_{post}(0) | G=A] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=A] = E[Y_{post}(0) | G=B] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=B]\n$$\nBy rearranging this assumption, we can express the unobservable counterfactual in terms of observable quantities:\n$$\nE[Y_{post}(0) | G=A] = E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=A] + (E[Y_{post}(0) | G=B] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=B])\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the ATT gives:\n$$\nATT_{post} = E[Y_{post}(1) | G=A] - \\left( E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=A] + E[Y_{post}(0) | G=B] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=B] \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the difference-in-differences estimand:\n$$\nATT_{post} = \\left( E[Y_{post}(1) | G=A] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=A] \\right) - \\left( E[Y_{post}(0) | G=B] - E[Y_{pre}(0) | G=B] \\right)\n$$\nEach term in this expression corresponds to an observable expected outcome, which we can estimate using the sample means (readmission probabilities) from the provided data. Let $\\bar{Y}_{g,t}$ be the sample mean outcome for group $g$ in period $t$. The sample analogue of the ATT, which is the DiD estimator $\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}}$, is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = (\\bar{Y}_{A,post} - \\bar{Y}_{A,pre}) - (\\bar{Y}_{B,post} - \\bar{Y}_{B,pre})\n$$\nNow, we compute the required sample means from the given data:\n- Treated group $A$, pre period: $\\bar{Y}_{A,pre} = \\frac{180}{1200} = \\frac{18}{120} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15$\n- Treated group $A$, post period: $\\bar{Y}_{A,post} = \\frac{156}{1300} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{100 \\times 13} = \\frac{12}{100} = 0.12$\n- Control group $B$, pre period: $\\bar{Y}_{B,pre} = \\frac{99}{900} = \\frac{11}{100} = 0.11$\n- Control group $B$, post period: $\\bar{Y}_{B,post} = \\frac{120}{1000} = \\frac{12}{100} = 0.12$\n\nSubstitute these values into the DiD estimator formula:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = (0.12 - 0.15) - (0.12 - 0.11)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the difference for the treated group (change over time):\n$$\n\\Delta_A = 0.12 - 0.15 = -0.03\n$$\nNext, calculate the difference for the control group (the secular trend):\n$$\n\\Delta_B = 0.12 - 0.11 = 0.01\n$$\nFinally, calculate the difference of these differences:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = -0.03 - 0.01 = -0.04\n$$\nThis is the DiD estimate of the ATT.\n\nThe causal interpretation of this result is as follows. The negative sign ($<0$) indicates that the program is associated with a reduction in the probability of readmission. The magnitude of the estimate is $0.04$. Under the parallel trends assumption, this means we estimate that the care coordination program caused a $4$ percentage point reduction in the $30$-day readmission probability for patients in hospital group $A$ during the post-period, relative to what their readmission probability would have been without the program.

It presents a standard task in epidemiological methods and comparative effectiveness research: conducting a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding using the E-value framework. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested expression and performing the calculation. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the problem. Let $E$ denote the exposure, where $E=1$ for the new anticoagulant and $E=0$ for the standard agent. Let $D$ denote the binary outcome, where $D=1$ for a major bleeding event and $D=0$ for no event. The observed risk ratio is given as $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.65$. This is the ratio of the risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{P(D=1|E=1)}{P(D=1|E=0)}$$\nThe goal is to assess the potential impact of an unmeasured confounder, $U$, on this observed association. We are asked to find the minimum strength of association that $U$ must have with both $E$ and $D$ to fully explain away the observed effect. \"Explaining away\" means that the true causal risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{true}}$, is equal to $1$, and the observed association is entirely an artifact of confounding.\n\nThe relationship between the observed risk ratio, the true risk ratio, and confounding bias can be expressed as $RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$, where $B$ is the bias factor. If the effect is to be entirely explained by confounding, then $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$, which implies $B = RR_{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nThe problem asks us to use the \"well-tested bound linking the magnitude of unmeasured confounding to bias on the risk ratio scale\". For a single, unmeasured, binary confounder $U$, a established bound on the bias factor $B$ is given by the parameters that characterize the confounder's associations with the exposure and the outcome. Let $RR_{EU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder and the exposure, and let $RR_{UD}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder and the outcome, conditional on the measured covariates. The maximum bias factor, $B_{\\text{max}}$, that can be produced is bounded. A key result from the literature (Ding & VanderWeele, 2016) gives the maximum possible bias factor as:\n$$B \\le \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1}$$\nThis bound holds under the worst-case scenario for the confounder's prevalence and assumes that both $RR_{EU} > 1$ and $RR_{UD} > 1$.\n\nThe problem introduces the simplifying assumption that the confounder's associations with treatment and outcome are equal on the risk ratio scale. Let us denote this common strength of association by $\\gamma$.\n$$ \\gamma = RR_{EU} = RR_{UD} $$\nSubstituting $\\gamma$ into the inequality for the bias factor, the maximum possible bias becomes:\n$$ B \\le \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma}{\\gamma + \\gamma - 1} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\gamma - 1} $$\nTo find the minimum value of $\\gamma$ that could explain away the observed risk ratio $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, we set the observed risk ratio equal to this maximum possible bias:\n$$ RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\gamma - 1} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\gamma$.\n$$ RR_{\\text{obs}} (2\\gamma - 1) = \\gamma^2 $$\n$$ 2\\gamma \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}} - RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\gamma^2 $$\nRearranging the terms gives a quadratic equation in $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma^2 - (2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}})\\gamma + RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0 $$\nWe solve this equation for $\\gamma$ using the quadratic formula, $\\gamma = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b = -2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}}$, and $c = RR_{\\text{obs}}$.\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}})^2 - 4(1)(RR_{\\text{obs}})}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}}^2 - 4 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}}}}{2} $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm 2\\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}^2 - RR_{\\text{obs}}}}{2} $$\n$$ \\gamma = RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)} $$\nThis yields two potential solutions for $\\gamma$. However, $\\gamma$ represents the strength of a confounding association, which must be greater than $1$ to create a positive bias (for an observed $RR_{\\text{obs}} > 1$). Let's examine the smaller root, $\\gamma_{-} = RR_{\\text{obs}} - \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}$. For any $RR_{\\text{obs}} > 1$, we have $RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1 < \\sqrt{(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)^2} < \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}$. Thus, $RR_{\\text{obs}} - \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)} < 1$. Since a confounding risk ratio must be greater than $1$ to induce the observed positive association, the smaller root is not the relevant solution. The minimum required strength of association must be the larger root.\n\nTherefore, the expression for the minimum required strength, which is the definition of the E-value, is:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\gamma = RR_{\\text{obs}} + \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)} $$\n\nNext, we compute the E-value for the observed risk ratio of $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.65$.\n$$ E\\text{-value} = 1.65 + \\sqrt{1.65(1.65 - 1)} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = 1.65 + \\sqrt{1.65(0.65)} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = 1.65 + \\sqrt{1.0725} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} \\approx 1.65 + 1.03561576 $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} \\approx 2.68561576 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $2.686$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. An E-value of $2.686$ implies that for an unmeasured confounder to fully account for the observed risk ratio of $1.65$, it would need to be associated with both the exposure (receiving the new anticoagulant) and the outcome (major bleeding) with a risk ratio of at least $2.686$ each, conditional on the measured covariates that were already adjusted for in the analysis. For example, if an unmeasured genetic factor were the confounder, it would need to increase the odds of a patient receiving the new drug by a factor of $2.686$ and also independently increase the risk of major bleeding by a factor of $2.686$. The plausibility of the observed association being entirely due to confounding can be judged by considering whether such a strong confounder that was not measured is likely to exist. A larger E-value suggests greater robustness of the finding to unmeasured confounding. In this case, a researcher would have to assess if a confounder with associations of magnitude $2.686$ is plausible in the context of atrial fibrillation treatment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.686}$$", "id": "4364910"}]}
