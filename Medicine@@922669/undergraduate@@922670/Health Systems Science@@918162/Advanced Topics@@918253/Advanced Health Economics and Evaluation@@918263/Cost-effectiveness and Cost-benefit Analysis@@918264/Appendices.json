Round your numerical result to four significant figures and express the final ratio in dollars per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (USD/QALY).", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard, formalizable principles of health economics and medical ethics, specifically Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and the concept of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The provided data are sufficient and consistent for the requested calculation. The context involving CRISPR-Cas9 therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis is scientifically plausible and grounded in current biomedical research. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nFirst, we address the conceptual definitions as requested.\n\nThe foundational ethical premise is that health states can be quantified. A Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a unit of measure that combines both the quantity (length) and the quality of life. For a given period of time, the number of QALYs is the product of the duration of time in a particular health state and a utility weight assigned to that health state. Utility weights are on a continuous scale from $0$ to $1$, where $1$ represents a state of perfect health and $0$ represents a state equivalent to death. If an individual lives for $T$ years with a health-related quality of life represented by a utility function $u(t)$, where $u(t) \\in [0, 1]$, the total QALYs experienced over that period is given by the integral:\n$$ \\text{QALYs} = \\int_{0}^{T} u(t) \\, dt $$\nFor a simplified model with discrete time periods, where an individual spends $t_i$ years in a health state with a constant utility weight $u_i$, the total QALYs are the sum:\n$$ \\text{QALYs} = \\sum_{i} u_i \\cdot t_i $$\n\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) is an economic evaluation framework used to compare the relative value of different health interventions. It assesses an intervention by relating its costs to the health benefits it produces. In CEA, costs are measured in monetary units (e.g., dollars), while health benefits are measured in natural health units, such as life-years gained, cases prevented, or, most comprehensively, QALYs gained. The primary outcome of a CEA is the Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (CER), often expressed as the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The ICER compares a new intervention (let's call it $A$) to a standard or current care option (let's call it $B$). It is calculated as the ratio of the difference in costs to the difference in health effects:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}_A - \\text{Cost}_B}{\\text{Effect}_A - \\text{Effect}_B} $$\nThe term \"dollars per QALY\" is the unit of the ICER when costs ($\\Delta C$) are measured in dollars and effects ($\\Delta E$) are measured in QALYs. It represents the additional cost incurred to gain one additional QALY.\n\nThe principal distinction between Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) lies in the valuation of health outcomes. In CEA, health outcomes (effects, $E$) are maintained in their non-monetary, health-specific units (like QALYs), resulting in a ratio as the final output. In contrast, CBA converts all aspects of an intervention, including health benefits, into monetary terms. This requires assigning a direct dollar value to outcomes like a year of life or a QALY gained (the \"willingness-to-pay\" for a QALY). The final output of a CBA is a net monetary value (Benefits $-$ Costs) or a benefit-cost ratio (Benefits / Costs). CEA avoids the explicit monetization of life and health, a step that is often ethically controversial and methodologically challenging.\n\nNext, we proceed with the calculation based on the provided data. The problem asks for the average cost per QALY for the CRISPR therapy. This is an application of the ICER formula, where the comparator is the \"current care\".\n\nThe incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, is the additional cost of the CRISPR therapy compared to current care. The problem gives the price of the therapy as $\\$500,000$. We can assume this is the net additional cost.\n$$ \\Delta C = 500,000 \\text{ USD} $$\nThe incremental health effect, $\\Delta E$, is the average gain in QALYs provided by the therapy relative to current care. The problem states this is $5$ QALYs.\n$$ \\Delta E = 5 \\text{ QALYs} $$\nThe average cost per QALY is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental QALYs gained:\n$$ \\text{Cost per QALY} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Cost per QALY} = \\frac{500,000}{5} \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\text{Cost per QALY} = 100,000 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}} $$\nThe problem requires the numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures.
