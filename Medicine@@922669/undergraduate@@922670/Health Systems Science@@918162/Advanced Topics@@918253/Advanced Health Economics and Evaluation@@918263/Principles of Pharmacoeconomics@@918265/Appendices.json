It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of pharmacoeconomics and finance, specifically the concept of the time value of money. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data (a stream of costs, timing, and a discount rate) to calculate a unique and meaningful result. The language is objective and the scenario is realistic.\n\nThe problem requires a first-principles explanation of discounting, a derivation of the present value formula, and its application to a given cost stream.\n\nFirst, we define discounting from first principles. In economics and finance, discounting is the process of determining the present value of a future payment or stream of payments. The need for discounting arises from the time value of money, a concept based on two fundamental principles: time preference and the opportunity cost of capital.\n\n1.  **Time Preference**: This is the principle that, all else being equal, individuals and societies prefer to receive benefits or incur costs sooner rather than later. A cost of $\\$1000$ today is perceived as more impactful than a cost of $\\$1000$ in the future. This preference for present satisfaction over future satisfaction means that future values must be adjusted, or 'discounted', to be directly comparable to present values.\n\n2.  **Opportunity Cost of Capital**: This principle recognizes that money available in the present can be invested to earn a positive rate of return. If a sum of money, which we can denote as its present value $PV$, is invested today at an annual rate of return $r$, it will grow to a future value $FV$ in one year according to the relation $FV = PV \\times (1+r)$. Conversely, a cost $C_1$ that must be paid one year from now is equivalent to a smaller amount of money today. This smaller amount is the present value, $PV$, which if invested today at the rate $r$, would grow to exactly $C_1$ in one year. The real discount rate, $r$, quantifies this opportunity cost—it is the rate of return forgone on capital that is committed to the program.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the present value ($PV$) of a stream of end-of-year costs using discrete annual compounding. Let $r$ be the annual discount rate. The relationship between a value at present ($PV$) and its equivalent value one year in the future ($FV_1$) is $FV_1 = PV \\times (1+r)$. Rearranging this, the present value of a future amount $C_1$ to be paid at the end of year $1$ is:\n$$PV_1 = \\frac{C_1}{(1+r)}$$\nFor a cost $C_2$ to be paid at the end of year $2$, we must discount it twice to bring it back to present value. Its value at the end of year $1$ is $\\frac{C_2}{1+r}$. To find its value at time $t=0$, we discount this amount once more:\n$$PV_2 = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{C_2}{1+r} \\right)}{1+r} = \\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2}$$\nBy induction, the present value, $PV_t$, of a single cost $C_t$ incurred at the end of year $t$ is given by the formula:\n$$PV_t = \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nFor a stream of future costs $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n$ incurred at the end of years $1, 2, \\dots, n$, the total present value, which we will denote simply as $PV$, is the sum of the present values of each individual cost:\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} PV_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThis is the general derived expression for the present value of a stream of discrete, end-of-year costs.\n\nFinally, we apply this formula to the specific cost stream provided in the problem. The givens are:\n-   A stream of costs: $C_1 = \\$1000$, $C_2 = \\$1000$, $C_3 = \\$1000$.\n-   The time horizon is $n=3$ years.\n-   The real annual discount rate is $r=0.03$.\n\nThe costs are in a constant price year, so no inflation adjustments are necessary, and the real discount rate is appropriate. We substitute these values into the derived summation formula:\n$$PV = \\frac{C_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{C_3}{(1+r)^3}$$\n$$PV = \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^1} + \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^2} + \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^3}$$\n$$PV = \\frac{1000}{1.03} + \\frac{1000}{(1.03)^2} + \\frac{1000}{(1.03)^3}$$\nWe calculate the value of each term:\n$$PV = 1000 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{1.03} + \\frac{1}{1.0609} + \\frac{1}{1.092727} \\right)$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times (0.970873786... + 0.942595908... + 0.915141658...)$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times (2.82861135...)$$\n$$PV \\approx 2828.61135$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

A year of good health now is generally preferred to a year of good health in the distant future. This practice extends the principle of discounting to the primary outcome measure in pharmacoeconomics: the Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY). By applying the same discounting logic to health outcomes as we do to costs, we ensure a consistent and fair comparison between different interventions. Mastering the calculation of discounted QALYs is crucial for accurately assessing the value of therapies that provide benefits over long periods [@problem_id:4584712].", "problem": "In clinical pharmacology, the concept of Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) is defined by weighting each unit of time by a health state utility, where utility is a cardinal value on the interval $\\left[0,1\\right]$ anchored at $0$ for death and $1$ for full health. Under the principles of pharmacoeconomics, future health effects are discounted to their present value to reflect time preference, consistent with the standard law of discrete compounding.

According to the problem, utility $u$ is accrued each year and valued at the end of the year, using a discrete discount rate $r$. The present value of the utility gained in year $t$ is $\\frac{u}{(1+r)^t}$. The total discounted QALYs, $Q_{PV}$, over $T$ years is the sum of these individual present values:\n$$ Q_{PV} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{u}{(1+r)^t} $$\nSince $u$ is a constant, it can be factored out:\n$$ Q_{PV} = u \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} $$\nThe summation is a standard financial formula for the present value of an annuity of $1 for T periods at rate r, which simplifies to $\\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-T}}{r}$.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe tasks will be addressed in sequence.\n\n1) Definition of Dominance in Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\nLet there be two treatment strategies, Strategy $A$ and Strategy $B$, with associated costs $C_A$ and $C_B$, and effectiveness measures $E_A$ and $E_B$, respectively.\n\nStrict Dominance: A strategy is strictly dominated if there is another strategy that is both more effective and less costly. Specifically, Strategy $B$ is strictly dominated by Strategy $A$ if and only if $C_A < C_B$ and $E_A > E_B$. A strictly dominated strategy is unequivocally inferior and should be removed from consideration.\n\nWeak (Extended) Dominance: This concept arises in the comparison of three or more strategies. When strategies are ordered by increasing effectiveness, an intermediate strategy is considered weakly or extendedly dominated if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to reach it from a less effective strategy is greater than the ICER to reach a more effective strategy from that same baseline. Let strategies $A$, $B$, and $C$ be ordered by increasing effectiveness, such that $E_A < E_B < E_C$. Strategy $B$ is weakly dominated if the ICER of moving from $A$ to $B$ is greater than the ICER of moving from $A$ to $C$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A} > \\frac{C_C - C_A}{E_C - E_A} $$\nThis implies that Strategy $B$ lies above the line segment connecting strategies $A$ and $C$ on the cost-effectiveness plane, making it an inefficient choice.\n\n2) Identification of Dominated Strategies\n\nFirst, the three strategies are ordered by increasing effectiveness (QALYs):\nStrategy 1: $(E_1, C_1) = (1.00, \\$9,000)$\nStrategy 3: $(E_3, C_3) = (1.08, \\$15,000)$\nStrategy 2: $(E_2, C_2) = (1.10, \\$12,000)$\n\nNext, we check for dominance based on this ordering. We compare each strategy to others to identify any that are less effective and more costly, or more effective and less costly.\n\nLet's compare Strategy 2 and Strategy 3.\nEffectiveness: $E_2 = 1.10$ QALYs and $E_3 = 1.08$ QALYs. So, $E_2 > E_3$.\nCosts: $C_2 = \\$12,000$ and $C_3 = \\$15,000$. So, $C_2 < C_3$.\nSince Strategy 2 is both more effective ($E_2 > E_3$) and less costly ($C_2 < C_3$) than Strategy 3, Strategy 3 is strictly dominated by Strategy 2. Therefore, Strategy 3 is removed from further analysis as it would never be a cost-effective choice.\n\nNo other pairs exhibit strict dominance. The remaining strategies are Strategy 1 and Strategy 2. With only two strategies, the concept of weak (extended) dominance does not apply, as it requires an intermediate option.\n\n3) Incremental Analysis of the Non-Dominated Set\n\nThe non-dominated set, which constitutes the cost-effectiveness frontier, consists of Strategy 1 and Strategy 2.\nStrategy 1: $(E_1, C_1) = (1.00, \\$9,000)$\nStrategy 2: $(E_2, C_2) = (1.10, \\$12,000)$\n\nTo determine the incremental cost per incremental QALY, we calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for moving from the less effective/less costly strategy (Strategy 1) to the more effective/more costly strategy (Strategy 2).\n\nThe formula for the ICER is:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{E_2 - E_1} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$12,000 - \\$9,000}{1.10 - 1.00} $$\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$3,000}{0.10 \\text{ QALYs}} $$\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\$30,000 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.
