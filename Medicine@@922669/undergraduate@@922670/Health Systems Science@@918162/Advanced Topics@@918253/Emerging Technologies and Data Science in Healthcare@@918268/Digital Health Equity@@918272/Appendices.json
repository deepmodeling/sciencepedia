The use of a confusion matrix, true positive rate, and the concept of equal opportunity are standard and well-defined in this domain. The application to digital health equity is a recognized topic in health systems science. The problem does not violate any scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data and a clear definition to compute the required metric.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective numerical data and formal definitions.\n\nFurthermore, we check for internal consistency.\n- The total number of patients in the Group $A$ cohort is $\\mathrm{TP}_{A} + \\mathrm{FN}_{A} + \\mathrm{FP}_{A} + \\mathrm{TN}_{A} = 240 + 60 + 140 + 560 = 1000$. This matches the stated cohort size of $1,000$.\n- The total number of patients in the Group $B$ cohort is $\\mathrm{TP}_{B} + \\mathrm{FN}_{B} + \\mathrm{FP}_{B} + \\mathrm{TN}_{B} = 150 + 50 + 200 + 600 = 1000$. This also matches the stated cohort size of $1,000$.\nThe provided data are complete and internally consistent. The problem is not ill-posed, incomplete, or contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe primary objective is to compute the absolute difference between the true positive rates of Group $A$ and Group $B$, denoted as $|\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} - \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}|$.\n\nThe problem defines the true positive rate ($\\mathrm{TPR}$) as the probability that the classifier outputs a positive prediction conditional on the actual condition being positive. This is also known as sensitivity or recall. Formally, $\\mathrm{TPR} = P(\\text{Predicted Positive} | \\text{Actual Positive})$.\n\nFrom the components of a confusion matrix, the total number of actual positive cases is the sum of true positives ($\\mathrm{TP}$) and false negatives ($\\mathrm{FN}$). The true positive rate is therefore calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{TPR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FN}} $$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the true positive rate for Group $A$, $\\mathrm{TPR}_{A}$.\nThe given values for Group $A$ are $\\mathrm{TP}_{A} = 240$ and $\\mathrm{FN}_{A} = 60$.\nThe total number of actual positive cases in Group $A$ is $P_A = \\mathrm{TP}_{A} + \\mathrm{FN}_{A} = 240 + 60 = 300$.\nThe true positive rate for Group $A$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{TPR}_{A} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}_{A}}{\\mathrm{TP}_{A} + \\mathrm{FN}_{A}} = \\frac{240}{300} = \\frac{24}{30} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$\n\nNext, we will calculate the true positive rate for Group $B$, $\\mathrm{TPR}_{B}$.\nThe given values for Group $B$ are $\\mathrm{TP}_{B} = 150$ and $\\mathrm{FN}_{B} = 50$.\nThe total number of actual positive cases in Group $B$ is $P_B = \\mathrm{TP}_{B} + \\mathrm{FN}_{B} = 150 + 50 = 200$.\nThe true positive rate for Group $B$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{TPR}_{B} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}_{B}}{\\mathrm{TP}_{B} + \\mathrm{FN}_{B}} = \\frac{150}{200} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\n\nNow, we compute the absolute difference between these two rates:\n$$ |\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} - \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}| = |0.8 - 0.75| = |0.05| = 0.05 $$\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess whether equal opportunity holds exactly. The criterion for equal opportunity is the equality of true positive rates across subgroups, i.e., $\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} = \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}$. This is equivalent to the condition $|\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} - \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}| = 0$.\nSince we have calculated $|\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} - \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}| = 0.05$, and $0.05 \\neq 0$, the condition for equal opportunity does not hold exactly. There is a disparity of $0.05$ in the true positive rate between the two subgroups, with the classifier performing better at identifying high-risk individuals in the high broadband access group (Group $A$) compared to the low broadband access group (Group $B$).\n\nThe final numeric answer required is the value of $|\\mathrm{TPR}_{A} - \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}|$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05}\n$$", "id": "4368959"}, {"introduction": "Digital health equity extends beyond algorithms to the fundamental resources that enable digital engagement, such as broadband internet.

We calculate the total shortfall by summing the shortfalls for each sub-adequate group:\n- Speed of 10 Mbps (50 households): Shortfall per household = $25 - 10 = 15$ Mbps. Total shortfall = $50 \\times 15 = 750$.\n- Speed of 18 Mbps (80 households): Shortfall per household = $25 - 18 = 7$ Mbps. Total shortfall = $80 \\times 7 = 560$.\n- Speed of 22 Mbps (70 households): Shortfall per household = $25 - 22 = 3$ Mbps.

It presents a standard biostatistical task based on plausible data and established methodologies within health systems science. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to derive from first principles the standardized mean difference as a measure of effect size for two independent groups and then to compute its value. This effect size quantifies the magnitude of the difference between two group means on a common, unitless scale.\n\nLet the two independent subgroups be Subgroup A and Subgroup B. The sample mean eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) scores for these groups are denoted by $\\bar{x}_A$ and $\\bar{x}_B$, respectively. The raw difference in mean scores is given by the expression $\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B$. This difference is expressed in the original units of the eHEALS measurement scale.\n\nTo create a unitless measure of effect size, this raw difference must be standardized. Standardization is achieved by dividing the mean difference by a standard deviation. In the case of two independent groups, the appropriate standardizer is the pooled standard deviation, denoted as $s_p$. The pooled standard deviation is an estimate of the population standard deviation, calculated by averaging the variances of the two samples. It is used under the assumption that the variances of the two groups are equal in the populations from which the samples are drawn (the assumption of homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances), which is explicitly stated in the problem as the condition under which the provided pooled standard deviation was estimated.\n\nThe \"first principles\" derivation of the standardized mean difference, commonly known as Cohen's $d$, is the ratio of the difference between the two means to the pooled standard deviation. The formula is:\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\text{difference in means}}{\\text{pooled standard deviation}}\n$$\nSymbolically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B}{s_p}\n$$\nThis statistic, $d$, represents the difference between the two means in terms of standard deviation units.\n\nWe are given the following summary statistics:\nThe sample mean for Subgroup A is $\\bar{x}_A = 26$.\nThe sample mean for Subgroup B is $\\bar{x}_B = 20$.\nThe pooled standard deviation is $s_p = 6$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for the standardized mean difference, we compute the effect size:\n$$\nd = \\frac{26 - 20}{6}\n$$\n$$\nd = \\frac{6}{6}\n$$\n$$\nd = 1\n$$\nThe computed effect size is exactly $1$.\n\nIn terms of practical implications for digital health equity, an effect size of this magnitude is considered very large by conventional standards (e.g., Cohen's guidelines suggest $d \\approx 0.2$ as small, $d \\approx 0.5$ as medium, and $d \\approx 0.8$ as large). An effect size of $d=1$ signifies that the mean eHEALS score of Subgroup A is one full standard deviation higher than the mean eHEALS score of Subgroup B. This implies a substantial and concerning disparity in eHealth literacy between the community with stable broadband access and the one with chronic limitations. The distributions of eHEALS scores for the two subgroups have minimal overlap. This large gap suggests that broadband access is strongly associated with the skills and confidence needed to engage with digital health resources. From a public health perspective, this finding would signal an urgent need for interventions aimed at improving digital infrastructure and providing digital literacy training for Subgroup B to mitigate this significant form of health inequity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "4368894"}]}
