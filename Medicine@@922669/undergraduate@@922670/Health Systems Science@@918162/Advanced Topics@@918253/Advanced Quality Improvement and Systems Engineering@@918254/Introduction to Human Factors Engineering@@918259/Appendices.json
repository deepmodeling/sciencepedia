In FMEA, each hazard is rated on three ordinal scales from $1$ to $10$: severity ($1$ is negligible harm and $10$ is catastrophic harm), occurrence ($1$ is extremely rare and $10$ is very frequent), and detection ($1$ is very likely to be detected before causing harm and $10$ is very unlikely to be detected). Higher values indicate worse risk characteristics. The team has identified $4$ hazards, labeled $H_1$ through $H_4$, with the following current ratings, and has proposed one mitigation for each hazard with predicted post-mitigation ratings and estimated implementation effort (in person-hours):\n\n- $H_1$ (wrong-patient medication administration due to barcode scanner timeouts): current severity $S_1 = 9$, occurrence $O_1 = 3$, detection $D_1 = 7$. Proposed mitigation $M_1$: post-mitigation $S_1' = 9$, $O_1' = 2$, $D_1' = 4$, effort $E_1 = 40$ person-hours.\n- $H_2$ (alert fatigue leading to override of critical drug–drug interaction alerts): current severity $S_2 = 8$, occurrence $O_2 = 6$, detection $D_2 = 8$. Proposed mitigation $M_2$: post-mitigation $S_2' = 8$, $O_2' = 4$, $D_2' = 6$, effort $E_2 = 55$ person-hours.\n- $H_3$ (look-alike vials selected in an automated dispensing cabinet): current severity $S_3 = 7$, occurrence $O_3 = 5$, detection $D_3 = 6$. Proposed mitigation $M_3$: post-mitigation $S_3' = 7$, $O_3' = 3$, $D_3' = 3$, effort $E_3 = 25$ person-hours.\n- $H_4$ (milligram versus milliliter confusion in the order entry user interface): current severity $S_4 = 10$, occurrence $O_4 = 2$, detection $D_4 = 6$.

This is defined as the absolute reduction in $RPN$ divided by the implementation effort, $E_i$.\n$$B_i = \\frac{\\Delta RPN_i}{E_i}$$\nThe efforts are given as $E_1 = 40$, $E_2 = 55$, $E_3 = 25$, and $E_4 = 50$ person-hours.\nFor $M_1$: $B_1 = \\frac{117}{40} = 2.925$.\nFor $M_2$: $B_2 = \\frac{192}{55} \\approx 3.4909$.\nFor $M_3$: $B_3 = \\frac{147}{25} = 5.88$.\nFor $M_4$: $B_4 = \\frac{90}{50} = 1.8$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the specified prioritization criteria to determine which mitigation to implement first.\nCriterion $1$: Maximize the benefit-per-effort ratio, $B_i$.\nComparing the calculated ratios:\n$B_1 = 2.925$\n$B_2 \\approx 3.4909$\n$B_3 = 5.88$\n$B_4 = 1.8$\n\nThe maximum value is $B_3 = 5.88$. Since there is a unique maximum value, we do not need to apply the tie-breaking criteria (criteria $2$, $3$, and $4$).\n\nThe mitigation with the highest priority is $M_3$, which corresponds to hazard $H_3$.

The absolute reduction in the error rate will be this fraction multiplied by the baseline error rate.\n\nLet's define the events for a single medication administration:\n-   $E_{pre}$: The event that a wrong-drug error would occur in the absence of the BCMA system. The baseline rate gives the probability $P(E_{pre}) = \\frac{2}{10{,}000} = 0.0002$.\n-   $S$: The event that the clinician performs a barcode scan.
