This exercise simulates a foundational Lean practice—going to the 'gemba' or the actual place where work happens—to see and understand a clinical process firsthand. By calculating basic performance metrics and identifying specific categories of waste from a realistic scenario, you will apply the core skills of the \"Measure\" and \"Analyze\" phases of the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) framework [@problem_id:4379214]. This practice is essential for transforming qualitative observations into quantitative data and generating hypotheses for improvement.", "problem": "A primary care clinic is evaluating its intake process using Lean and Six Sigma principles. In the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) framework, a process analyst observes the end-to-end intake cycle time (from patient check-in start to readiness for clinician handoff) for five consecutive patients during a single, typical clinic session. The observed cycle times are $[6, 8, 7, 9, 6]$ minutes. In parallel, a structured observation identifies non-value-added elements: patients are routinely waiting while a medical assistant logs into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (login delay of about $1$ minute), staff walks to a shared hallway printer to retrieve labels (about $0.5$ minute of walking per patient), and insurance questions are asked twice due to a paper form and a later EHR field entry (duplicative questioning totaling about $1$ minute).\n\nStarting from the core definitions of value-added time, non-value-added time (waste), sample mean, and sample standard deviation, do the following:\n- Compute the sample mean of the observed intake cycle times.\n- Compute the sample standard deviation of the observed intake cycle times.\n- Identify at least two Lean waste categories that are consistent with the observation notes and justify your classification briefly.\n- Propose a single Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) hypothesis as a testable countermeasure aimed at reducing the intake cycle time that is feasible within one week.\n\nFor grading, report only the sample standard deviation as your final answer. Express the final standard deviation in minutes and round your final answer to $3$ significant figures. Do not include units in your final boxed answer. All intermediate computations and reasoning should be based on the stated definitions and observations and should remain consistent with Lean and Six Sigma methodology in healthcare operations.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of health systems science and industrial engineering (Lean, Six Sigma). It is well-posed, with a self-contained and consistent set of data and definitions sufficient for the required calculations and qualitative analysis. The language is objective and the scenario presented is realistic.\n\nThe problem asks for several computations and qualitative analyses based on a set of observed data for a clinic's intake process. The provided dataset for the cycle times is $X = \\{6, 8, 7, 9, 6\\}$ minutes. The sample size is $n=5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) of the observed intake cycle times. The sample mean is defined as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations.\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{6 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 6}{5} = \\frac{36}{5} = 7.2 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the sample standard deviation ($s$) of the observed intake cycle times. The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance ($s^2$), which measures the average squared deviation of each observation from the sample mean. The formula for the sample variance uses a denominator of $n-1$ to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance.\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\nWe first calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean, using $\\bar{x} = 7.2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (6 - 7.2)^2 + (8 - 7.2)^2 + (7 - 7.2)^2 + (9 - 7.2)^2 + (6 - 7.2)^2\n$$\n$$\n= (-1.2)^2 + (0.8)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (1.8)^2 + (-1.2)^2\n$$\n$$\n= 1.44 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 3.24 + 1.44 = 6.8\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the sample variance:\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{6.8}{n-1} = \\frac{6.8}{5-1} = \\frac{6.8}{4} = 1.7 \\text{ minutes}^2\n$$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{1.7} \\approx 1.30384048... \\text{ minutes}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\ns \\approx 1.30 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\nThird, we identify at least two Lean waste categories from the observation notes. Lean methodology identifies several types of waste (muda), commonly remembered with acronyms like TIMWOODS or DOWNTIME.\n1.  **Waiting**: The observation that patients wait while a medical assistant logs into the EHR system for about $1$ minute is a direct example of the waste of waiting. Time is lost when people or processes are idle.\n2.  **Transportation/Motion**: The staff's walk to a shared hallway printer (about $0.5$ minutes) is an example of unnecessary movement. This can be classified as the waste of Transportation (unnecessary movement of materials or people between processes) or Motion (unnecessary movement of people within a process). Given the walk is to a shared resource external to the immediate workspace, Transportation is an apt classification.\n3.  **Extra-Processing**: Asking for insurance information twice (once on paper, once in the EHR), totaling about $1$ minute, is a clear example of the waste of extra-processing. This involves performing more work than is necessary, including re-entering data, rework, and redundant approvals.\n\nFinally, we propose a single Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) hypothesis as a testable countermeasure. The PDSA cycle is a framework for iterative improvement. A good hypothesis must be specific, testable, and feasible. Targeting the EHR login delay is a rapidly testable change.\nA valid PDSA hypothesis would be: \"If we implement a new standard procedure where medical assistants log into the EHR system at the start of their clinic session and keep the session active, then we predict the average non-value-added time per patient intake will decrease by approximately $1$ minute, as measured by direct observation of the next $5$ patient intakes.\" This hypothesis proposes a small-scale, low-cost change (the \"Plan\"), outlines its implementation (the \"Do\"), and defines the expected outcome and measurement method (for the \"Study\" and \"Act\" phases).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.30}$$", "id": "4379214"}, {"introduction": "In healthcare, patient care pathways are rarely single steps but rather a sequence of interconnected activities.

In the current state, the long-run sustainable capacities (patients completed per hour) are $[30, 20, 25]$ for Steps $1$, $2$, and $3$, respectively. The arrival rate is approximately constant at $\\lambda = 60$ patients per hour. Assume steady operations with sufficient Work in Progress (WIP) buffering so that downstream steps are never starved by upstream variability, and upstream steps are not blocked by downstream variability.

Let $C_i$ be the capacity of step $i$ (patients per hour), $\\lambda$ be the arrival rate, and $\\theta$ be the system's steady-state throughput.\n\nFor a system of sequential steps, the throughput $\\theta$ is limited by two factors: the arrival rate and the capacity of the slowest step (the bottleneck). Therefore, the overall system throughput is given by:\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(\\lambda, C_{sys}) = \\min(\\lambda, C_1, C_2, C_3)\n$$\nThe system's capacity, $C_{sys}$, is the minimum of the individual step capacities. The problem states that the arrival rate ($\\lambda = 60$) is high and there is sufficient work-in-progress, which means the system is never starved for work. In this case, the system is overloaded, and its throughput is determined solely by its bottleneck capacity: $\\theta = C_{sys}$.\n\n**1) Baseline System Throughput ($\\theta$) and Bottleneck Identification**\n\nThe baseline capacities are $C_1 = 30$, $C_2 = 20$, and $C_3 = 25$ patients per hour.\nThe system's capacity is the minimum of these values:\n$$\nC_{sys} = \\min(30, 20, 25) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nSince the arrival rate ($\\lambda=60$) is greater than the system capacity, the throughput is limited by the system capacity.\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(60, 20) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe bottleneck is the step with the lowest capacity, which is **Step 2**.\n\n**2) Improvement A: New Throughput $\\theta_A$**\n\nIn this scenario, the capacity of Step 1 (a non-bottleneck) is increased to $40$. The new capacities are $C'_{1} = 40$, $C_2 = 20$, and $C_3 = 25$.\nThe new system capacity is:\n$$\nC_{sys,A} = \\min(40, 20, 25) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThe bottleneck is still Step 2. The throughput remains unchanged:\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\min(60, 20) = 20 \\text{ patients per hour}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that improving a non-bottleneck step does not increase the overall system's throughput.\n\n**3) Improvement B: New Throughput $\\theta_B$**\n\nHere, the capacity of the original bottleneck (Step 2) is increased to $25$.

The process capability index is a statistical measure that quantifies the ability of a process to produce output within defined specification limits.\n\nThe general definition of $C_{pk}$ is the minimum of two indices: the upper capability index, $C_{pu}$, and the lower capability index, $C_{pl}$.\n$$ C_{pk} = \\min(C_{pu}, C_{pl}) $$\nThese indices are calculated as follows:\n$$ C_{pu} = \\frac{USL - \\mu}{3\\sigma} $$\n$$ C_{pl} = \\frac{\\mu - LSL}{3\\sigma} $$\nHere, $USL$ is the Upper Specification Limit, $LSL$ is the Lower Specification Limit, $\\mu$ represents the process mean, and $\\sigma$ represents the process standard deviation.

In such cases, the definition of $C_{pk}$ simplifies to be equal to the upper capability index, $C_{pu}$.\n$$ C_{pk} = C_{pu} $$\nThis is because capability is only constrained by the upper limit; there is no penalty for being far below the mean.\n\nWe substitute the provided values into the formula for $C_{pu}$:\n$$ C_{pk} = \\frac{USL - \\mu}{3\\sigma} = \\frac{30 - 22}{3 \\times 5} $$\nPerforming the arithmetic in the numerator and denominator:\n$$ C_{pk} = \\frac{8}{15} $$\nThe fraction $\\frac{8}{15}$ is in its simplest form, as the greatest common divisor of $8$ ($2^3$) and $15$ ($3 \\times 5$) is $1$.\n\nThe problem also requires an assessment of whether the process is capable.

This low value indicates that the process mean is too close to the upper specification limit relative to the process's inherent variation. A substantial proportion of outcomes will fall outside the acceptable limit. To improve capability, the hospital would need to either reduce the process mean (i.e., see patients faster on average) or decrease the process variation (i.e., make the door-to-provider time more consistent).\n\nThe final numerical value of $C_{pk}$ as a simplified fraction is $\\frac{8}{15}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$$", "id": "4379213"}]}
