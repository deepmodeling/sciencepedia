It is a standard problem in statistical sample size determination for a proportion. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum sample size, $n$, required for a study cycle to estimate a population proportion, $p$, with a specified precision. The process measure is binary, so the number of \"successes\" (e.g., completed medication reconciliations) in a sample of $n$ independent encounters follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$. The sample proportion, $\\hat{p} = X/n$, is an unbiased estimator of the true prevalence $p$.\n\nAccording to the central limit theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $E[\\hat{p}] = p$ and variance $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)\n$$\nA two-sided confidence interval for the population proportion $p$ at a confidence level of $1-\\alpha$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\hat{p}}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ is the standard error of the proportion, and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution that corresponds to the upper tail probability of $\\alpha/2$. In practice, the standard error is estimated using the sample proportion, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$.\n\nFor the purpose of planning a study, we do not have a sample proportion $\\hat{p}$. Instead, we use a planning value for the proportion, denoted as $p$, to calculate the required sample size. The half-width of the confidence interval, $d$, is defined by the margin of error:\n$$\nd = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the following parameters:\n- The anticipated post-intervention prevalence to be used for planning is $p = p_1 = 0.75$.\n- The desired confidence level is $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $\\alpha = 0.05$. The corresponding critical value is $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$. For a standard normal distribution, this value is approximately $1.96$.\n- The maximum acceptable half-width of the confidence interval is $d = 0.05$.\n\nWe must now derive an expression for the sample size $n$. By rearranging the formula for the half-width, we first square both sides:\n$$\nd^2 = \\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\right)^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\n$$\nSolving for $n$, we obtain the general formula for the required sample size:\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\right)^2 p(1-p)}{d^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression. We use $p=p_1=0.75$, $d=0.05$, and $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\n$$\nn = \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\times 0.75 \\times (1 - 0.75)}{(0.05)^2}\n$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$\nn = \\frac{(3.8416) \\times 0.75 \\times (0.25)}{(0.0025)}\n$$\n$$\nn = \\frac{3.8416 \\times 0.1875}{0.0025}\n$$\n$$\nn = \\frac{0.7203}{0.0025}\n$$\n$$\nn = 288.12\n$$\nThis is the continuous estimate for the required sample size. The problem requires a specific rounding procedure. First, this value must be rounded to four significant figures. The value $288.12$ rounded to four significant figures is $288.1$.\n\nNext, as the sample size must be an integer, we must take the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to this rounded value. This is equivalent to taking the ceiling of the rounded number.\n$$\nn_{\\text{final}} = \\lceil 288.1 \\rceil = 289\n$$\nTherefore, a minimum of $289$ patient encounters must be sampled in each PDSA cycle to meet the specified precision requirement.\n\nAs a final check, we confirm that the normal approximation is valid for this sample size and prevalence.

Under a stable process with independent observations that are approximately normally distributed, a control chart with centerline at the process mean $\\mu$ and limits derived from the process standard deviation $\\sigma$ is used to distinguish common-cause variation from special-cause variation. Common-cause variation represents the inherent system variability, whereas special-cause variation indicates a nonrandom, assignable cause. The Western Electric rules are a well-tested set of criteria for detecting special-cause signals; one such rule is that “$2$ of $3$ successive points beyond $2\\sigma$ on the same side of the centerline” indicates special cause.\n\nIn the scenario, the baseline mean and standard deviation are $\\mu = 40$ minutes and $\\sigma = 8$ minutes, so $\\mu + 2\\sigma = 40 + 16 = 56$ minutes. The observed daily means over $3$ consecutive days are $57$ minutes, $60$ minutes, and $55$ minutes.

Either way, this is rare and supports classification as special cause per the Western Electric rules.\n\nIn the PDSA framework (Plan-Do-Study-Act), the Act phase decisions depend on whether the special-cause signal is in the desired direction relative to the aim. Here, the aim is to reduce triage time, but the points are above the baseline and two exceed $+2\\sigma$, indicating deterioration in the undesired direction. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat this as special cause adverse to the aim, investigate attribution to the change (and context), and either abandon or adapt the change. Immediate recalculation of the centerline and limits is not recommended based on $3$ data points; recalibration is appropriate only after evidence of a sustained shift and stability at a new level. Clinical operations should not be halted; instead, the team should implement safe mitigations, reflect on learning, and plan the next PDSA cycle to address the observed causes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This recommends treating the pattern as common cause and refreshing control limits immediately. Given the calculated probability (approximately $0.001536$ on one side), the pattern is highly unlikely under common cause and matches a Western Electric special-cause rule.

This identifies the pattern as a Western Electric special-cause signal and, because it is in the undesired direction, advises abandoning or adapting the change, investigating attribution, and not recalculating limits immediately, while planning the next cycle. This aligns with SPC and PDSA principles and is the appropriate action. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This asserts an approximate probability of $5\\%$ for two of three beyond $+2\\sigma$, which is a substantial overestimate; the correct probability is about $0.1536\\%$ on one side. It then suggests adopting the change despite an adverse signal. Both the probability and the recommended action are inappropriate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This prescribes halting clinical operations entirely upon an out-of-control signal, which is neither standard nor safe in health systems improvement. Quality improvement addresses processes while maintaining care; it does not mandate suspension of workflows. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This defers action until there are $8$ consecutive points on one side, a different rule that detects sustained shifts. The Western Electric “$2$ of $3$ beyond $2\\sigma$” rule is also valid for special cause, and ignoring it would miss an important signal, especially when adverse to the aim.
