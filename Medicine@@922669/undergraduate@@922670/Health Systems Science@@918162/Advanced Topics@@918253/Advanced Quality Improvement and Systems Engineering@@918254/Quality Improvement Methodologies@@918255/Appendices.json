The team rates three distinct failure modes using the standard $1$ to $10$ ordinal scales for severity, occurrence, and detection difficulty. Let severity be denoted by $s$, occurrence by $o$, and detection difficulty by $d$. The three failure modes and their ratings are:\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{A}$: $s=7$, $o=3$, $d=7$.\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{B}$: $s=5$, $o=8$, $d=2$.\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{C}$: $s=9$, $o=2$, $d=9$.\n\nUsing widely accepted practice, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is defined as the multiplicative aggregation of the three ratings. Compute the RPN for each failure mode.\n\nNext, starting from core definitions in probability and expected value, critically examine whether multiplying three ordinal ratings yields a cardinal risk quantity that is interpretable on a meaningful scale. Then, derive a more principled prioritization metric based on expected harm per medication order under the following scientifically grounded modeling assumptions:\n\n- Severity mapping: Let the harm magnitude function be $h(s)=\\exp(\\alpha\\,(s-6))$. Calibrate $\\alpha$ using the anchor that a severity rating of $s=8$ represents four times the harm of a severity rating of $s=6$.\n\n- Occurrence mapping: Let the base probability of the failure mode occurring on a single medication order be $p(o)=\\gamma\\,o$. Assume that at $o=10$ the base probability is $p_{\\max}=0.02$ per order, and determine $\\gamma$ accordingly.\n\n- Detection mapping: Let the probability that the failure escapes detection be $q(d)=\\frac{d}{10}$.\n\nAssume independence between the occurrence of the failure and detection processes, and define the expected harm per order for failure mode $i$ as $E_i=h(s_i)\\,p(o_i)\\,q(d_i)$. For each failure mode, compute $E_i$ and identify which failure mode should be prioritized under this expected harm metric. Finally, report the expected harm of the prioritized failure mode per $1{,}000$ medication orders. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in relative harm units per $1{,}000$ orders.", "solution": "The first part of the problem requires the computation of the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for three failure modes. The RPN is defined as the product of the ratings for severity ($s$), occurrence ($o$), and detection difficulty ($d$). The formula is $\\text{RPN} = s \\times o \\times d$.\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{A}$, with $s_A=7$, $o_A=3$, and $d_A=7$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_A = 7 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 147 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{B}$, with $s_B=5$, $o_B=8$, and $d_B=2$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_B = 5 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 80 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{C}$, with $s_C=9$, $o_C=2$, and $d_C=9$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_C = 9 \\times 2 \\times 9 = 162 $$\n\nBased on these RPN values, the prioritization order would be $\\mathrm{C} > \\mathrm{A} > \\mathrm{B}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a critical examination of the practice of multiplying ordinal ratings to yield a cardinal risk quantity. The ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection are provided on $1$-to-$10$ ordinal scales. Ordinal scales preserve only rank order; for instance, a severity of $s=8$ is understood to be more severe than $s=4$, but it cannot be concluded that it is \"twice as severe\". The intervals between consecutive numbers on the scale are not guaranteed to be uniform or meaningful. Arithmetic operations such as multiplication are mathematically defined for cardinal (specifically, ratio) scales, where there is a true, non-arbitrary zero and equal intervals between scale points. Multiplying numbers from ordinal scales is a mathematically invalid operation because it treats the ordinal ranks as if they were cardinal quantities. The resulting RPN is a dimensionless index, not a cardinal quantity with a clear, interpretable meaning. An RPN of $200$ is not necessarily twice the risk of an RPN of $100$. This method can also produce misleading priorities, as different combinations of $s$, $o$, and $d$ (e.g., $s=10, o=2, d=5$ versus $s=5, o=5, d=4$) can yield the same RPN ($100$) despite representing qualitatively different risk profiles. The multiplicative model implicitly assumes relationships (e.g., linearity, equal weight) between the scales and risk that are not justified a priori.\n\nThe third part requires deriving a more principled metric based on expected harm per order, $E_i=h(s_i)\\,p(o_i)\\,q(d_i)$. This requires calibrating the functions $h(s)$, $p(o)$, and $q(d)$.\n\nFirst, we calibrate the harm magnitude function, $h(s)=\\exp(\\alpha\\,(s-6))$.\nThe calibration condition is that a severity of $s=8$ represents four times the harm of $s=6$, which translates to $h(8) = 4 \\times h(6)$.\nSubstituting the function definition:\n$$ \\exp(\\alpha\\,(8-6)) = 4 \\times \\exp(\\alpha\\,(6-6)) $$\n$$ \\exp(2\\alpha) = 4 \\times \\exp(0) = 4 \\times 1 = 4 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(2\\alpha)) = \\ln(4) $$\n$$ 2\\alpha = \\ln(2^2) = 2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\ln(2) $$\nThus, the harm function is $h(s) = \\exp(\\ln(2)\\,(s-6)) = (\\exp(\\ln(2)))^{s-6} = 2^{s-6}$. The harm is measured in relative units where $h(6)=1$.\n\nNext, we calibrate the occurrence probability function, $p(o)=\\gamma\\,o$.\nThe condition is that at $o=10$, the probability is $p(10) = p_{\\max} = 0.02$.\n$$ \\gamma \\times 10 = 0.02 $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{0.02}{10} = 0.002 $$\nThus, the occurrence probability function is $p(o) = 0.002\\,o$.\n\nThe probability of a failure escaping detection is given directly as $q(d) = \\frac{d}{10}$.\n\nNow we can write the full expression for the expected harm per order, $E_i$:\n$$ E_i = h(s_i) \\, p(o_i) \\, q(d_i) = (2^{s_i-6}) \\times (0.002 \\cdot o_i) \\times \\left(\\frac{d_i}{10}\\right) $$\n$$ E_i = (0.0002) \\cdot o_i \\cdot d_i \\cdot 2^{s_i-6} $$\n\nWe now compute $E_i$ for each failure mode.\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{A}$ ($s_A=7$, $o_A=3$, $d_A=7$):\n$$ E_A = (0.0002) \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 2^{7-6} = 0.0042 \\times 2^1 = 0.0084 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{B}$ ($s_B=5$, $o_B=8$, $d_B=2$):\n$$ E_B = (0.0002) \\times 8 \\times 2 \\times 2^{5-6} = 0.0032 \\times 2^{-1} = 0.0032 \\times 0.5 = 0.0016 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{C}$ ($s_C=9$, $o_C=2$, $d_C=9$):\n$$ E_C = (0.0002) \\times 2 \\times 9 \\times 2^{9-6} = 0.0036 \\times 2^3 = 0.0036 \\times 8 = 0.0288 $$\n\nComparing the expected harm values: $E_A = 0.0084$, $E_B = 0.0016$, and $E_C = 0.0288$.\nThe prioritization based on expected harm is $\\mathrm{C} > \\mathrm{A} > \\mathrm{B}$, since $0.0288 > 0.0084 > 0.0016$. In this specific case, the ranking matches the RPN-based ranking. However, the expected harm metric provides a cardinal measure of risk. For example, the risk of failure mode $\\mathrm{C}$ is $E_C/E_A = 0.0288 / 0.0084 \\approx 3.43$ times greater than that of mode $\\mathrm{A}$, whereas the RPN ratio of $\\text{RPN}_C/\\text{RPN}_A = 162/147 \\approx 1.10$ significantly understates this difference. The prioritized failure mode is $\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe final task is to report the expected harm of the prioritized failure mode ($\\mathrm{C}$) per $1{,}000$ medication orders. The expected harm per order is $E_C = 0.0288$ relative harm units.\nThe expected harm per $1{,}000$ orders is:\n$$ E_{C, 1000} = E_C \\times 1000 = 0.0288 \\times 1000 = 28.8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ 28.80 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28.80}$$", "id": "4393374"}, {"introduction": "Effective quality improvement relies on monitoring key processes to distinguish between normal variation and significant changes that require action.

Therefore, the **upper specification side dominates the operational risk**, meaning there is a higher probability of triage times exceeding the $120$-minute maximum than falling below the $60$-minute minimum.\n\n2.  **Process Capability**: A widely accepted minimum value for a process to be considered \"capable\" is $C_{pk} \\ge 1.33$. A value of $C_{pk}  1.00$ indicates that the process is not capable, as parts of the natural process distribution fall outside the specification limits. In this case, $C_{pk} \\approx 0.833$, which is significantly less than $1.00$. Therefore, the process is **not capable** of consistently meeting the specified triage time requirements. The value $C_p = 1.00$ indicates that the process variability ($6\\sigma = 60$ min) is exactly as wide as the specification range ($USL - LSL = 60$ min). This means that even if the process were perfectly centered, it would just barely fit within the limits.
