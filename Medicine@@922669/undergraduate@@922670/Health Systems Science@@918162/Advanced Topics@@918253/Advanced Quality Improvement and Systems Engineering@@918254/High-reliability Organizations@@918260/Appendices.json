It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and reliability engineering, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from contradiction, ambiguity, or factual unsoundness. It presents a standard problem in systems reliability analysis applied to a relevant clinical context within health systems science. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet $S_{overall}$ be the event that the overall process succeeds. The problem states that the process consists of $3$ sequential steps. Let $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ denote the events that step $1$, step $2$, and step $3$ succeed, respectively.\n\nThe reliability of each step is provided as $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. By definition, reliability is the probability of success. Therefore, we have:\n$P(S_1) = r_1$\n$P(S_2) = r_2$\n$P(S_3) = r_3$\n\nThe problem specifies that the overall process succeeds if and only if all $3$ steps succeed. This is a series system configuration. In the language of set theory, the event of overall success, $S_{overall}$, is the intersection of the events of individual step successes:\n$$S_{overall} = S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap S_3$$\n\nThe problem also states that the step-level successes and failures are independent events. According to the multiplication rule for independent events in probability theory, the probability of the intersection of a set of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, the overall process reliability, which we denote as $R_{overall}$, can be calculated as:\n$$R_{overall} = P(S_{overall}) = P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap S_3)$$\nBecause of independence, this becomes:\n$$R_{overall} = P(S_1) \\times P(S_2) \\times P(S_3)$$\n\nSubstituting the given reliability values for each step, we arrive at the closed-form expression for the overall process reliability:\n$$R_{overall} = r_1 r_2 r_3$$\n\nThis expression forms the basis for explaining the “weakest-link effect” for series processes. The problem gives that for each step $i$, its reliability $r_i$ is in the interval $(0, 1]$. This means $0 < r_i \\le 1$. When we multiply these numbers, the product is always less than or equal to the smallest number in the set. Let $r_{min}$ be the minimum reliability among the three steps, i.e., $r_{min} = \\min\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nSince $r_1 \\le 1$, $r_2 \\le 1$, and $r_3 \\le 1$, we can write the following inequality:\n$$R_{overall} = r_1 r_2 r_3 \\le r_{min} \\times 1 \\times 1 = r_{min}$$\nTherefore, we have the general result for series systems:\n$$R_{overall} \\le \\min\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$$\n\nThis mathematical inequality, $R_{overall} \\le r_{min}$, is the formal statement of the weakest-link effect. It means that the reliability of a system of sequential, independent steps can never be greater than the reliability of its least reliable component. The component with the lowest reliability acts as a ceiling for the entire system's performance.\n\nIn the clinical context of the blood product identification process, this effect is critical. Suppose the wristband verification ($r_1$) and bedside barcode verification ($r_3$) are highly reliable, for example, $r_1 = 0.999$ and $r_3 = 0.999$. However, if the specimen label verification in the laboratory ($r_2$) is prone to error and has a reliability of only $r_2 = 0.95$, the overall reliability of the complete process is:\n$$R_{overall} = (0.999) \\times (0.95) \\times (0.999) \\approx 0.948$$\nThe overall system reliability ($~94.8\\%$) is dragged down to be very close to the reliability of the weakest link ($95\\%$). Even with two nearly perfect steps, the single less-reliable step governs the system's performance. This demonstrates that to improve the safety and reliability of the overall process, the primary focus of improvement efforts must be on the \"weakest link\"—in this hypothetical case, the specimen label verification step. Perfecting the other steps while ignoring the weakest one yields diminishing returns and fails to substantially elevate the overall system reliability.

It presents a standard problem in reliability engineering, which is an established subfield of applied probability and systems engineering. The context of High-Reliability Organizations (HROs) in health systems science is appropriate and realistic. All required definitions and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThis problem requires a formal definition of system reliability, a derivation of the reliability of a parallel system from first principles, and the application of this result to a specific scenario to find the probability of system failure.\n\nFirst, we formally define system reliability for series and parallel configurations. Let a system consist of $n$ components, $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n$. Let $S_i$ be the event that component $C_i$ succeeds, and let its reliability be $r_i = P(S_i)$.\n\nA **series system** succeeds if and only if **all** of its components succeed. The event of system success, $S_{series}$, is the intersection of the individual component success events:\n$$S_{series} = S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap S_n = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} S_i$$\nThe reliability of the series system is $R_{series} = P(S_{series})$. If the components operate independently, then $R_{series} = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(S_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_i$.\n\nA **parallel system** succeeds if and only if **at least one** of its components succeeds. The event of system success, $S_{parallel}$, is the union of the individual component success events:\n$$S_{parallel} = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup S_n = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} S_i$$\nThe reliability of the parallel system is $R_{parallel} = P(S_{parallel})$.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation from first principles for the reliability of a parallel configuration with $2$ independent components. Let the components be $C_1$ and $C_2$, with reliabilities $r_1 = P(S_1)$ and $r_2 = P(S_2)$, respectively.\n\nThe derivation is most directly accomplished by considering the complement event: system failure. A parallel system fails if and only if all of its components fail. Let $F_{sys}$ be the event of system failure and $F_i$ be the event of failure for component $C_i$. The event $F_i$ is the complement of the success event $S_i$, so $F_i = S_i'$. The probability of component failure, or its unreliability, is given by the rule for complementary events:\n$$P(F_i) = P(S_i') = 1 - P(S_i) = 1 - r_i$$\nFor our two-component system, the probabilities of failure for each component are:\n$$P(F_1) = 1 - r_1$$\n$$P(F_2) = 1 - r_2$$\nThe event of system failure, $F_{parallel}$, is the event that both component $1$ AND component $2$ fail:\n$$F_{parallel} = F_1 \\cap F_2$$\nThe problem states that the components are independent. A direct consequence of the independence of events $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the independence of their complements, $F_1$ and $F_2$. Therefore, the probability of system failure is the product of the individual component failure probabilities:\n$$P(F_{parallel}) = P(F_1 \\cap F_2) = P(F_1)P(F_2) = (1 - r_1)(1 - r_2)$$\nThe reliability of the parallel system, $R_p$, is the probability of system success, $S_{parallel}$. The event of system success is the complement of system failure, $S_{parallel} = F_{parallel}'$. Thus, the reliability is:\n$$R_p = P(S_{parallel}) = 1 - P(F_{parallel}) = 1 - (1 - r_1)(1 - r_2)$$\nThis concludes the derivation from first principles.\n\nFinally, we apply this result to the medication barcode verification process. This process is modeled as two independent scanners in parallel. Scanner $1$ has reliability $r_1$ and scanner $2$ has reliability $r_2$. The problem states that \"the verification process succeeds if at least one scanner correctly detects an error,\" which is the definition of a parallel system's success.\n\nThe question asks for the \"probability that the verification process fails to prevent an erroneous administration\". This is equivalent to asking for the probability that the system fails. We have already derived the expression for the probability of system failure, $P(F_{parallel})$, for a parallel system of two independent components.\nThe probability of failure for this verification system is:\n$$P(\\text{system failure}) = (1 - r_1)(1 - r_2)$$\nNo further simplification of this expression is necessary. This is the final analytic expression in terms of $r_1$ and $r_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1 - r_1)(1 - r_2)}$$", "id": "4375949"}, {"introduction": "Reliable systems often depend on sensitive early warning tools, but interpreting their alerts correctly presents a profound challenge.

It requests a derivation from first principles, which will be performed as follows.\n\nLet $S$ be the event that a patient has sepsis, and let $S^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have sepsis. Let $T^+$ be the event that the sepsis early warning score (the test) is positive, and let $T^-$ be the event that the test is negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms:\n1. The underlying prevalence of sepsis is $0.05$. This is the prior probability of a patient having sepsis:\n$$ P(S) = 0.05 $$\nFrom this, the probability of a patient not having sepsis is:\n$$ P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 $$\n2. The sensitivity of the test is $0.85$. Sensitivity is the probability that the test is positive given that the patient has the disease (a true positive).\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+|S) = 0.85 $$\n3. The specificity of the test is $0.90$. Specificity is the probability that the test is negative given that the patient does not have the disease (a true negative).\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^-|S^c) = 0.90 $$\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) and compute its value. The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient has sepsis given that the test is positive, which is the conditional probability $P(S|T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which relates a conditional probability to its inverse:\n$$ P(S|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|S) P(S)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe terms in the numerator are known from the problem statement: $P(T^+|S)$ is the sensitivity ($0.85$) and $P(S)$ is the prevalence ($0.05$).\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the overall probability of a positive test, regardless of the patient's true disease status. To find this, we use the law of total probability, conditioning on the presence or absence of sepsis:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap S) + P(T^+ \\cap S^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|S)P(S) + P(T^+|S^c)P(S^c) $$\nThis expression states that the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives.\n\nWe have values for $P(T^+|S)$, $P(S)$, and $P(S^c)$. The remaining unknown term is $P(T^+|S^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have sepsis (a false positive). This is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^-|S^c)$:\n$$ P(T^+|S^c) = 1 - P(T^-|S^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity} $$\nSubstituting the given value for specificity:\n$$ P(T^+|S^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known components back into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.05) + (0.10)(0.95) $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expanded denominator back into the Bayes' theorem formula for the PPV, $P(S|T^+)$:\n$$ P(S|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|S) P(S)}{P(T^+|S)P(S) + P(T^+|S^c)P(S^c)} $$\nThis is the required expression for the positive predictive value derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given parameters:\n$$ P(S|T^+) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.05)}{(0.85)(0.05) + (0.10)(0.95)} $$\nCalculating the numerator:\n$$ 0.85 \\times 0.05 = 0.0425 $$\nCalculating the denominator:\n$$ (0.85)(0.05) + (0.10)(0.95) = 0.0425 + 0.095 = 0.1375 $$\nDividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$ P(S|T^+) = \\frac{0.0425}{0.1375} \\approx 0.30909090... $$\nRounding this value to four significant figures as requested gives $0.3091$.\n\nThe final part of the task is to briefly interpret this result. A positive predictive value of $0.3091$ signifies that when a patient receives a positive result from the sepsis early warning score, there is only a $30.91\\%$ probability that the patient actually has sepsis. Conversely, this means that approximately $69.09\\%$ ($1 - 0.3091$) of the positive alerts are false alarms. For a high-reliability organization (HRO), this presents a significant challenge. While the system reflects an HRO's \"preoccupation with failure\" by being highly sensitive, the large volume of false alarms can lead to \"alarm fatigue,\" causing clinicians to distrust the system and potentially ignore true positive alerts. This paradoxically risks undermining the very reliability the tool was meant to enhance. An effective HRO must therefore supplement such a warning system with robust secondary verification processes to manage the high false alarm rate and ensure that attention is appropriately directed to true cases without overwhelming staff.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3091}$$", "id": "4375905"}]}
