Two distinct failure modes are identified with ordinal ratings on the standard ten-point scale: severity $S$, occurrence $O$, and detection $D$, where higher $S$ means more severe harm if it occurs, higher $O$ means more frequent occurrence, and higher $D$ means lower detectability before reaching the patient. The first failure mode has $S=8$, $O=4$, $D=2$. The second failure mode has $S=6$, $O=6$, $D=3$. Using the FMEA definition of the Risk Priority Number (RPN), compute the $RPN$ for each mode.\n\nTo ground the ordinal ratings in a quantitative expected-harm framework consistent with core definitions of probability and expectation, assume the following plausible monotonic mappings from ratings to quantitative parameters:\n- Map occurrence $O$ to a per-patient event probability $p(O)$ by $p(O)=\\frac{O}{100}$.\n- Map detection $D$ to a pre-patient detection probability $q(D)$ by $q(D)=\\frac{11-D}{11}$, so the probability of escaping detection is $1-q(D)=\\frac{D}{11}$.\n- Map severity $S$ to an expected harm magnitude $h(S)$ measured as additional hospital length of stay by $h(S)=0.5+1.5\\,S$ (days).\n\nUsing the expected value definition, model expected harm per patient for a mode with ratings $(S,O,D)$ as\n$$E(S,O,D)=h(S)\\,p(O)\\,\\left[1-q(D)\\right].$$\nCompute $E$ for each mode, then form the dimensionless ratio\n$$\\rho=\\frac{E(6,6,3)}{E(8,4,2)}.$$\nRound your final reported ratio to four significant figures. Express $E$ in hospital days per patient, but report only the ratio $\\rho$ as your final answer.\n\nFinally, based on your computations and the above mappings, reason whether the higher $RPN$ corresponds to the higher expected harm in this case, and explain briefly under what conditions such correspondence can fail when using products of ordinal scales.", "solution": "First, we compute the Risk Priority Number ($RPN$) for each failure mode using the standard definition $RPN = S \\times O \\times D$.\n\nFor the first failure mode, with $(S_1, O_1, D_1) = (8, 4, 2)$:\n$$RPN_1 = S_1 \\times O_1 \\times D_1 = 8 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 64$$\nFor the second failure mode, with $(S_2, O_2, D_2) = (6, 6, 3)$:\n$$RPN_2 = S_2 \\times O_2 \\times D_2 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 3 = 108$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected harm, $E$, for each failure mode using the provided quantitative mappings and formula.

We add a trailing zero to express 1.71 with four significant figures.\n\nFinally, we analyze the correspondence between the rankings.\n-   **RPN Ranking**: $RPN_2 (108) > RPN_1 (64)$.\n-   **Expected Harm Ranking**: $E_2 (\\frac{1.71}{11}) > E_1 (\\frac{1}{11})$.\n\nIn this specific instance, the higher $RPN$ corresponds to the higher expected harm. However, this alignment is not guaranteed. The $RPN$ calculation treats ordinal numbers as ratio-scale numbers, which is mathematically invalid. A rank-reversal between RPN and a physically grounded metric like expected harm can occur if the mapping from the ordinal score to the quantitative parameter is not a simple proportion. Here, the severity mapping $h(S)=0.5+1.5S$ is an affine transformation, not a simple proportion. Because of the constant term (0.5), the ratio $h(S_1)/h(S_2)$ is not equal to $S_1/S_2$. This non-linearity can cause the RPN ranking to diverge from the expected harm ranking under different circumstances.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.710}\n$$", "id": "4370750"}, {"introduction": "A key function of FMEA is to guide resource allocation toward interventions that provide the greatest safety benefit.

This problem connects FMEA to the rich field of human factors engineering, challenging you to match specific control strategies to different types of human error—slips, lapses, mistakes, and violations. Mastering this concept allows you to move beyond generic solutions and develop targeted interventions that address the root cause of a failure [@problem_id:4370792].", "problem": "A hospital surgical service uses a standardized surgical time-out to prevent wrong-patient and wrong-site procedures. A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) team is convened after several near misses. They define the failure mode as “time-out performed incompletely or skipped,” and identify four distinct human-factor cause categories: slips, lapses, mistakes, and violations. The team must choose primary controls whose mechanisms align with the nature of each cause and with the core aim of FMEA controls, namely to reduce occurrence $O$ and increase detectability $D$ of failures before harm, while acknowledging that severity $S$ is determined by the potential effect and is not usually reduced by controls applied at this step.\n\nUse the following fundamental base from health systems science and human factors:\n- Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) classifies a failure mode, its causes, and its effects, and then selects controls that either prevent the cause (lowering $O$) or detect the failure prior to effect (improving $D$). Severity $S$ reflects the consequence if the failure reaches the patient.\n- In human error taxonomy based on well-established human factors science, slips are execution errors (attentional or perceptual failures during correct planning), lapses are memory or attention failures (omissions due to forgetting or interruption), mistakes are planning or rule/knowledge-based errors (incorrect mental model or misapplied rules), and violations are deliberate deviations from known procedures or policies.\n\nAssume a representative set of proximal causes for the time-out failure mode:\n- Slip: a circulating nurse intends to select the “completed time-out” field but inadvertently clicks “skip” on the electronic checklist due to closely spaced buttons.\n- Lapse: a page and room noise interrupt the team, and a step in the script is omitted.\n- Mistake: a surgeon believes that correct site marking alone satisfies the safety requirement and shortens the script.\n- Violation: during perceived urgency, a senior clinician directs the team to proceed without the time-out.\n\nWhich option best maps each cause type to a distinct, primary control strategy that is most consistent with FMEA’s preventive and detective control design, given the mechanisms of these causes?\n\nA.

The goal is to select the option that maps the strongest and most suitable controls to each error type: slips, lapses, mistakes, and violations.\n\n1.  **Controlling Slips**: Slips are unintentional execution errors. The person has the correct plan but fails to execute it correctly, often due to interface design or attentional capture. The most effective controls are system-based, such as redesigning the interface (e.g., separating buttons, using confirmation prompts), using forcing functions to make the error impossible, or automation.\n\n2.  **Controlling Lapses**: Lapses are unintentional memory failures, like forgetting a step, often caused by interruptions. The most effective controls are memory aids like checklists and procedural controls that protect against interruptions, such as a designated \"no-interruption zone\" or a mandated pause.\n\n3.  **Controlling Mistakes**: Mistakes are errors in planning, stemming from incorrect knowledge or flawed reasoning. The person does what they intend, but their plan is wrong. Effective controls must address this knowledge gap or flawed plan. These include targeted education, simulation training, clear protocols, and real-time decision support embedded in the workflow.\n\n4.  **Controlling Violations**: Violations are intentional deviations from a known rule. The controls must address the motivation for the deviation and enforce compliance. This requires a combination of strong leadership endorsement of the policy, accountability measures (e.g., audit and feedback), and, for critical rules, hard stops that make the violation impossible.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    *   **Slips**: Controlled by `interface forcing functions and automation`. This is a high-reliability control, directly engineering out the error. Excellent match.\n    *   **Lapses**: Controlled by a `standardized checklist with a mandated pause`. The checklist is a classic memory aid, and the pause prevents interruptions. Excellent match.\n    *   **Mistakes**: Controlled by `targeted education plus decision support embedded in the workflow`. This addresses both the knowledge gap and provides real-time guidance. Excellent match.\n    *   **Violations**: Controlled by `leadership-backed audit and peer accountability with enforceable hard stops`. This is a robust, multi-layered strategy addressing culture, accountability, and system design. Excellent match.\n    This option provides a comprehensive set of strong controls perfectly matched to each error type.\n\n*   **Option B**: The control for slips, `punitive policy enforcement`, is inappropriate for unintentional errors and damages safety culture. The control for violations, `cognitive aid posters`, is extremely weak for intentional acts. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: The control for slips, `after-the-fact incident reporting`, is not a control at all; it is a measurement activity that occurs after the failure. The control for violations, `non-punitive reporting only`, is insufficient for managing deliberate rule-breaking. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: The control for mistakes, `annual email of the policy`, is a very weak administrative control that is known to be ineffective at changing behavior or correcting faulty mental models. While the other pairings are reasonable, this weak link makes the overall strategy suboptimal compared to Option A.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A provides the most robust and scientifically grounded mapping of control strategies to the specific mechanisms of slips, lapses, mistakes, and violations. Each proposed control is a best practice in human factors and systems safety.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4370792"}]}
