The concept of calculating per capita cost from utilization and price data is a standard and valid method in health systems science. The numerical values for population size, utilization, and prices are realistic for a United States health system.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the per capita cost, which is a core metric in the Triple Aim framework. Per capita cost, denoted here as $C_{pc}$, is defined as the total healthcare expenditure, $C_{total}$, for a population, divided by the number of individuals in that population, $N$.\n$$ C_{pc} = \\frac{C_{total}}{N} $$\nThe total expenditure $C_{total}$ is the sum of the costs from all specified service categories. Let the costs for inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and SNF services be $C_{IP}$, $C_{OP}$, $C_{Rx}$, and $C_{SNF}$, respectively.\n$$ C_{total} = C_{IP} + C_{OP} + C_{Rx} + C_{SNF} $$\nThe cost for each category is determined by multiplying its utilization count ($n$) by its unit price ($p$).\n\n1.  **Calculate the cost for each service category:**\n    -   Inpatient cost ($C_{IP}$):\n        $$ C_{IP} = n_{IP} \\times p_{IP} = 5,200 \\times \\$10,500 = \\$54,600,000 $$\n    -   Outpatient cost ($C_{OP}$):\n        $$ C_{OP} = n_{OP} \\times p_{OP} = 480,000 \\times \\$160 = \\$76,800,000 $$\n    -   Pharmacy cost ($C_{Rx}$):\n        $$ C_{Rx} = n_{Rx} \\times p_{Rx} = 1,200,000 \\times \\$45 = \\$54,000,000 $$\n    -   Post-acute SNF cost ($C_{SNF}$):\n        $$ C_{SNF} = n_{SNF} \\times p_{SNF} = 90,000 \\times \\$290 = \\$26,100,000 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the total expenditure:**\n    $$ C_{total} = \\$54,600,000 + \\$76,800,000 + \\$54,000,000 + \\$26,100,000 = \\$211,500,000 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the per capita cost:**\n    The population size is given as $N = 80,000$.\n    $$ C_{pc} = \\frac{\\$211,500,000}{80,000} = \\$2,643.75 \\text{ per person} $$\n\n4.  **Round the result:**\n    The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $2,643.75$. The first four significant digits are $2$, $6$, $4$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $7$. Since $7 \\ge 5$, the fourth significant digit is rounded up from $3$ to $4$.\n    $$ C_{pc, rounded} \\approx 2,644 $$\n    The final answer is $2,644$ United States dollars per person.\n\n5.  **Identify the dominant cost driver (supporting analysis):**\n    To determine the dominant cost driver, we calculate the share of each category relative to the total expenditure of $C_{total} = \\$211,500,000$.\n    -   Inpatient share: $\\frac{C_{IP}}{C_{total}} = \\frac{\\$54,600,000}{\\$211,500,000} \\approx 0.258 = 25.8\\%$\n    -   Outpatient share: $\\frac{C_{OP}}{C_{total}} = \\frac{\\$76,800,000}{\\$211,500,000} \\approx 0.363 = 36.3\\%$\n    -   Pharmacy share: $\\frac{C_{Rx}}{C_{total}} = \\frac{\\$54,000,000}{\\$211,500,000} \\approx 0.255 = 25.5\\%$\n    -   SNF share: $\\frac{C_{SNF}}{C_{total}} = \\frac{\\$26,100,000}{\\$211,500,000} \\approx 0.123 = 12.3\\%$\n    The category with the largest share is outpatient visits, which accounts for approximately $36.3\\%$ of the total medical spending.

The ICER is defined as the ratio of the difference in costs to the difference in health outcomes (effectiveness). The health outcome is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\n\nLet $C_{new}$ and $Q_{new}$ represent the total cost and total QALYs for the new program, respectively.

This threshold represents the maximum amount society is willing to spend to gain one additional year of life in perfect health.

The health gain it produces is achieved at a cost that is acceptable to the decision-makers. The formal recommendation would be to adopt and implement the new program.\n\nThe connection to the Triple Aim is as follows:\n1.  **Improving the individual experience of care:** The data show that the new program increases QALYs ($Q_{new} > Q_{usual}$). A QALY is a measure that combines both the quantity and the *quality* of life. An increase in QALYs signifies an improved health state for the individual, which is a primary component of a positive care experience.\n2.  **Improving population health:** The analysis is on a per-patient basis. If this program is implemented for all eligible patients in the region, the total health of that population will increase, as each individual, on average, gains $0.33$ QALYs. Thus, the program's adoption would advance this aim.\n3.  **Reducing per capita cost:** The new program has a higher per-patient cost than usual care ($\\Delta C = \\$5{,}750 > 0$). It does not reduce costs; it increases them. However, a crucial aspect of the Triple Aim is achieving health system sustainability through *value*. The ICER analysis demonstrates that while costs increase, the concurrent improvement in health provides a return on investment that is considered efficient and acceptable under the stated WTP threshold. Therefore, while the program fails the literal goal of *reducing* cost, it succeeds in the related goal of providing *cost-effective* care, which is a more sophisticated interpretation of this aim.\n\nThe connection to the Quadruple Aim, which adds the goal of **improving the work life of health care professionals**, cannot be assessed from the given information. The problem provides only cost and QALY data. There is no information regarding provider satisfaction, burnout, administrative burden, or other metrics related to the work-life of clinicians and staff. To evaluate the program's impact on this fourth aim, additional data would be required.

The Triple and Quadruple Aims are established, influential frameworks developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI).

The observed outcomes, both positive and negative, are scientifically plausible and represent realistic results and trade-offs of such a complex intervention.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of definitions, a description of an intervention, and a set of empirical observations. The task is to synthesize this evidence to classify the program's effects according to the established framework. This is a problem of analysis and scientific reasoning, for which a \"best\" answer can be determined by systematically mapping the evidence to the framework.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively. The frameworks are defined, and the outcomes are presented as quantitative data points (e.g., percentages, scores, time) without subjective language. The question itself directs the solver to base their analysis \"strictly\" on the definitions and evidence, reinforcing an objective approach.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-constructed case study that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is suitable for a rigorous analysis of cause and effect within a complex system.\n\n### Problem Analysis and Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to classify the program's impact based on the definitions of the Triple and Quadruple Aims, using the provided evidence. We must analyze the program's effects on each of the four dimensions.\n\n1.  **Patient Experience of Care**: This dimension includes quality and satisfaction.\n    -   **Positive Impact**: The patient-reported care coordination composite score improved significantly from $3.6$ to $4.2$ on a $5$-point scale. This is a direct measure of an improved patient experience. The interventions themselves, such as regular check-ins and navigation support, are designed to make care more accessible, understandable, and integrated from the patient's perspective. Medication reconciliation within $72$ hours post-discharge is a critical safety and quality improvement, which is a core component of the patient experience.\n    -   **Negative Impact**: The average time to the third-next-available appointment increased from $5$ days to $8$ days. This represents a degradation in access to care, which is a key component of the patient experience.\n\n2.  **Population Health**: This dimension concerns the health outcomes of a group of individuals.\n    -   **Positive Impact**: All-cause $30$-day readmissions for the high-risk cohort ($n=2,000$) decreased by a substantial $15\\%$. A reduction in hospital readmissions is a key indicator of improved population health management, reflecting better transitional care and chronic disease control.\n    -   **Positive Impact**: Hemoglobin A1c control ($< 7\\%$) among patients with diabetes improved from $52\\%$ to $58\\%$. This is a direct clinical outcome measure indicating better management of a chronic condition at a population level.\n\n3.  **Per Capita Cost**: This dimension relates to the total cost of care per person.\n    -   **Mixed Impact**: For the targeted high-risk cohort, the Per-Member-Per-Month (PMPM) cost *decreased* by $3\\%$, likely due to the avoidance of high-cost events like hospitalizations (as suggested by the reduced readmission rate).\n    -   **Mixed Impact**: For the overall panel, the PMPM cost *increased* by $1\\%$. This is despite the savings in the high-risk group. The program's staffing costs alone were $0.8\\%$ of total operations. The overall $1\\%$ increase suggests that the savings generated in the high-risk cohort were not sufficient to offset the program's costs across the entire population, and potentially other factors contributed to cost growth. Therefore, the program was not cost-saving for the system overall in this period.\n\n4.  **Workforce Well-being (Quadruple Aim)**: This dimension concerns the work-life and well-being of the healthcare workforce.\n    -   **Negative Impact**: The RN Care Managers, who are central to executing the program, experienced increased cognitive load and a rise in burnout scores from $2.8$ to $3.4$ on a $5$-point scale. This is a significant negative outcome.\n    -   **Positive Impact**: Physicians experienced \"improved communication efficiency and fewer coordination-related interruptions.\" This is a positive outcome for a different segment of the workforce. The net effect on the workforce is therefore mixed.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nThe program is a \"care coordination program.\" Its interventions are process-oriented (check-ins, reconciliation, navigation). The most direct and intended effect of improving care coordination is to improve the patient's experience of that care, making it feel more integrated, safe, and supportive. The data confirms this with a large improvement in the coordination composite score. The improvements in population health (lower readmissions, better A1c control) are best understood as a *consequence* or positive spillover of this better-coordinated care. Therefore, it is most accurate to classify the program's primary impact as being on the **patient experience of care**.\n\nThe analysis then requires identifying spillovers:\n-   **Positive spillovers**: Better experience and process lead to better health outcomes (population health) and lower costs for the targeted high-risk group (per capita cost).\n-   **Negative spillovers**: The program creates new demands, leading to decreased access (longer appointment wait times), which erodes one aspect of patient experience. It also creates a significant burden on the RNs delivering the program (workforce well-being), even while benefiting physicians. The overall cost for the system also increased slightly.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The program primarily improves the patient experience of care; positive spillovers include improved population health via enhanced self-management and safer transitions (evidenced by increased Hemoglobin A1c control and lower readmissions) and reduced per capita cost in the high-risk cohort via avoided utilization; negative spillovers include access friction (longer wait times) that can erode experience and increased RN cognitive load that risks workforce burnout in the Quadruple Aim, potentially offsetting net gains if unaddressed.**\n\n-   **Primary Impact**: Identifies \"patient experience of care\" as primary. This aligns with our analysis that the core interventions are process-based and directly affect the experience of care.\n-   **Positive Spillovers**: Correctly identifies improved population health (A1c, readmissions) and targeted cost reduction (for the high-risk cohort) as consequences.\n-   **Negative Spillovers**: Correctly identifies both the access friction (wait times) and the negative impact on RN well-being (burnout).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option provides a complete, nuanced, and factually accurate summary of the evidence, correctly identifying the primary impact and the complex web of positive and negative spillovers across all four Aims.\n\n**B. The program primarily reduces per capita cost across the entire panel; positive spillovers include higher satisfaction and improved population health; workforce well-being improves due to fewer interruptions, with no meaningful negative spillovers.**\n\n-   **Primary Impact**: Claims the program \"reduces per capita cost across the entire panel.\" This is factually false; the evidence states the PMPM cost for the overall panel *increased* by $1\\%$.\n-   **Negative Spillovers**: Claims there are \"no meaningful negative spillovers.\" This is factually false. Increased appointment wait times from $5$ to $8$ days and a significant increase in RN burnout are highly meaningful negative spillovers.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option makes multiple claims that are in direct contradiction with the provided data.\n\n**C. The program primarily improves population health; negative spillovers include worse patient experience due to access delays and higher per capita cost driven by added staffing, with minimal effect on readmissions or safety.**\n\n-   **Primary Impact**: Identifies \"population health\" as primary. This is a plausible alternative, but the rest of the statement contains errors.\n-   **Spillovers**: Claims \"minimal effect on readmissions or safety.\" This is factually false. A $15\\%$ reduction in readmissions is a significant effect, and a core intervention is medication reconciliation, a key safety practice.\n-   **Spillovers**: Describes patient experience as \"worse... due to access delays,\" completely ignoring the large improvement in the care coordination composite score. This is an incomplete and misleading characterization.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option contains definitive factual errors regarding the program's observed effects.\n\n**D. The program primarily targets workforce well-being; positive spillovers include better patient experience from smoother communication; other Triple Aim dimensions are largely unaffected because coordination is an internal process change rather than a clinical or cost intervention.**\n\n-   **Primary Impact**: Claims the program \"primarily targets workforce well-being.\" This is incorrect. The program description clearly indicates it targets adult patients with chronic conditions. The effect on the workforce is a consequence, not the primary goal.\n-   **Spillovers**: Claims \"other Triple Aim dimensions are largely unaffected.\" This is factually false. The data show significant, quantified effects on patient experience (composite score), population health ($15\\%$ readmission reduction, $52\\% \\to 58\\%$ A1c control), and cost (PMPM changes).\n-   **Premise**: The premise that care coordination \"is an internal process change rather than a clinical or cost intervention\" is fundamentally flawed. Modern healthcare recognizes that care coordination is itself a critical clinical and value-generating activity.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The claims in this option are contrary to the provided data and based on a false premise.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4402625"}]}
