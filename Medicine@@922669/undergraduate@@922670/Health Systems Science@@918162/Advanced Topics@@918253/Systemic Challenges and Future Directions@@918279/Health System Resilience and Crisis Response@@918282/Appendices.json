In a commonly used proxy in disaster risk analysis, system risk is modeled as the multiplicative combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability: risk $R$ is proportional to the concurrence of the stressor, the fraction of system assets exposed, and the susceptibility of those assets. Assume a normalized model in which each factor is scaled between $0$ and $1$, and define:\n- Hazard $H$ as the normalized annualized likelihood-severity of an extreme event,\n- Exposure $E$ as the proportion of critical system capacity subject to disruption,\n- Vulnerability $V$ as the conditional probability that exposed capacity fails given the hazard.\n\nUse the fundamental base that, under these assumptions, overall risk is represented by the product\n$$\nR = H \\cdot E \\cdot V,\n$$\nand that a mitigation action that reduces vulnerability by $\\Delta V$ (without altering $H$ or $E$) changes risk accordingly.

In health systems science, health system resilience is the capacity to maintain essential services under stress by optimally allocating scarce human resources, while recognizing that extended work hours and circadian disruption increase burnout risk. Consider the following crisis-response staffing model grounded in core definitions of coverage and capacity constraints and a well-tested linear approximation that models overtime as a primary driver of burnout risk.\n\nDefine decision variables for the Experienced cohort and the Float cohort as follows: for each cohort $i \\in \\{E, F\\}$ and each shift $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$, let $x_{i j}$ denote regular hours assigned and $y_{i j}$ denote overtime hours assigned on that shift.

It is a non-trivial optimization exercise.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Formulation of the Linear Program\n\nThe objective is to minimize the composite score $Z$. Let's expand the definition of $Z$:\n$$Z = w_1(y_{E1} + y_{F1}) + w_2(y_{E2} + y_{F2})$$\nSubstituting the given weights $w_1 = 1$ and $w_2 = 3$:\n$$Z = 1(y_{E1} + y_{F1}) + 3(y_{E2} + y_{F2}) = y_{E1} + y_{F1} + 3y_{E2} + 3y_{F2}$$\n\nThe constraints, as specified, are:\n1.  **Coverage Constraints**:\n    - Day shift: $x_{E1} + x_{F1} + y_{E1} + y_{F1} \\ge 18$\n    - Night shift: $x_{E2} + x_{F2} + y_{E2} + y_{F2} \\ge 12$\n2.  **Regular-Hour Capacity Constraints**:\n    - Experienced cohort: $x_{E1} + x_{E2} \\le 14$\n    - Float cohort: $x_{F1} + x_{F2} \\le 10$\n3.  **Overtime-Hour Capacity Constraints**:\n    - Experienced cohort: $y_{E1} + y_{E2} \\le 4$\n    - Float cohort: $y_{F1} + y_{F2} \\le 4$\n4.  **Skill-Mix Constraint**:\n    - $x_{F2} \\le 4$\n5.  **Nonnegativity Constraints**:\n    - $x_{E1}, x_{E2}, x_{F1}, x_{F2} \\ge 0$\n    - $y_{E1}, y_{E2}, y_{F1}, y_{F2} \\ge 0$\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Linear Program\n\nThe objective function penalizes overtime hours, with night overtime being three times as costly as day overtime. To minimize $Z$, we should utilize regular hours as effectively as possible.\n\nThe total demand is $D_1 + D_2 = 18 + 12 = 30$ hours.\nThe total available regular hour capacity is $R_E + R_F = 14 + 10 = 24$ hours.\nSince total regular capacity ($24$ hours) is less than total demand ($30$ hours), overtime is unavoidable. The minimum total overtime required is $30 - 24 = 6$ hours. This occurs if and only if all $24$ regular hours are utilized. Any solution that uses fewer than $24$ regular hours will require more than $6$ hours of total overtime, which will likely increase the cost $Z$. For optimality, we should utilize all regular hours.\n$x_{E1} + x_{E2} = 14$\n$x_{F1} + x_{F2} = 10$\n\nTo minimize the objective $Z = (y_{E1} + y_{F1}) + 3(y_{E2} + y_{F2})$, we should prioritize avoiding night overtime ($y_{E2}, y_{F2}$). This means we should try to cover the night shift demand ($D_2 = 12$) as much as possible with regular hours ($x_{E2}, x_{F2}$).\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible regular hours for the night shift, $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2}$, subject to the constraints on regular hours:\n- $x_{E1} + x_{E2} = 14 \\implies x_{E2} = 14 - x_{E1}$. Since $x_{E1} \\ge 0$, we have $x_{E2} \\le 14$.\n- $x_{F1} + x_{F2} = 10 \\implies x_{F2} = 10 - x_{F1}$. Since $x_{F1} \\ge 0$, we have $x_{F2} \\le 10$.\n- The skill-mix constraint imposes a stricter limit: $x_{F2} \\le 4$.\n\nTo maximize $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2}$, we should maximize $x_{E2}$ and $x_{F2}$.\nMaximum $x_{F2} = 4$. To achieve this, we set $x_{F1} = 10 - 4 = 6$.\nTo maximize $x_{E2}$, we must minimize $x_{E1}$.\nThe total day shift regular hours are $X_1 = x_{E1} + x_{F1}$. With $x_{F1}=6$, we have $X_1 = x_{E1}+6$.\nThe total night shift regular hours are $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2} = x_{E2} + 4$.\nAlso, $X_1+X_2 = 24$, so $(x_{E1}+6) + (x_{E2}+4) = 24 \\implies x_{E1}+x_{E2}=14$, which is consistent.\n\nTo maximize $X_2$, we need to find a feasible allocation.\nLet's check if we can cover the entire night demand ($12$ hours) with regular hours, i.e., can we achieve $X_2 = 12$?\nIf $X_2 = x_{E2} + x_{F2} = 12$:\nGiven $x_{F2} \\le 4$, we must have $x_{E2} \\ge 12 - 4 = 8$.\nFrom the Experienced cohort capacity, $x_{E1} + x_{E2} = 14$. So $x_{E1} = 14 - x_{E2} \\le 14 - 8 = 6$.\nFrom the Float cohort capacity, $x_{F1} + x_{F2} = 10$. If we set $x_{F2}=4$ (its max), then $x_{F1}=6$.\nThe total regular day hours are $X_1 = x_{E1} + x_{F1}$. For a valid assignment, we need $X_1 = 24 - X_2 = 24 - 12 = 12$.\nSo we need $x_{E1} + x_{F1} = 12$. With $x_{F1}=6$, this means we need $x_{E1}=6$.\nThis is a consistent and feasible allocation of regular hours:\n- $x_{F2} = 4$\n- $x_{E2} = 8$\n- $x_{F1} = 6$\n- $x_{E1} = 6$\nThis allocation uses all regular hours ($X_1=12, X_2=12$) and satisfies all constraints on them.\n\nWith this regular hour allocation, the remaining demand (which must be met by overtime) is:\n- Night shift: $y_{E2} + y_{F2} = D_2 - X_2 = 12 - 12 = 0$. This means $y_{E2}=0$ and $y_{F2}=0$.\n- Day shift: $y_{E1} + y_{F1} = D_1 - X_1 = 18 - 12 = 6$.\nTotal overtime is 6 hours, which is the minimum possible. All of it is on the day shift.\n\nWe must check if this overtime plan is feasible:\n- $y_{E1} + y_{F1} = 6$\n- $y_{E1} + y_{E2} \\le 4 \\implies y_{E1} + 0 \\le 4 \\implies y_{E1} \\le 4$.\n- $y_{F1} + y_{F2} \\le 4 \\implies y_{F1} + 0 \\le 4 \\implies y_{F1} \\le 4$.\nWe need to find non-negative $y_{E1}, y_{F1}$ that sum to 6, with each being at most 4. This is possible (e.g., $y_{E1}=2, y_{F1}=4$ or $y_{E1}=3, y_{F1}=3$ or $y_{E1}=4, y_{F1}=2$). So the plan is feasible.\n\nThe value of the objective function for this optimal plan is:\n$Z = y_{E1} + y_{F1} + 3(y_{E2} + y_{F2}) = 6 + 3(0) = 6$.\n\nSince we have successfully assigned zero hours to the most costly overtime (night shift) and fulfilled the minimum possible total overtime, this represents the minimal score. Any other allocation of regular hours would shift regular hours from night to day, creating a need for night overtime which is 3 times as costly, thus increasing the total score. For instance, if $X_2=11$ and $X_1=13$, then $Y_2=1$ and $Y_1=5$, for a cost of $Z = 5 + 3(1) = 8$.\n\nThe minimized composite overtime-burnout score is exactly 6.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "4374614"}]}
