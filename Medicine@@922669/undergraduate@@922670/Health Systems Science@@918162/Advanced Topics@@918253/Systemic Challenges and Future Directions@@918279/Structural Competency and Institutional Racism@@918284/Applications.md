## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the foundational principles of structural competency and institutional racism, this chapter demonstrates their application in diverse, real-world contexts. The objective is not to reiterate core definitions but to illustrate how these frameworks are utilized to analyze complex problems, design effective interventions, and drive systemic change within and beyond the health system. By moving from the level of the clinical encounter to that of institutional policy, historical analysis, and community partnership, we will see how structural thinking provides an indispensable toolkit for advancing health equity. This exploration will necessarily be interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from public health, law, economics, history, and psychology.

### Recognizing Structural Racism in Clinical Practice and Data

A primary application of structural competency is the ability to recognize how institutional policies, practices, and even seemingly objective clinical tools can produce and perpetuate racial inequities. This often begins with the critical analysis of data that reveal disparities, followed by an investigation into the upstream structural drivers of those disparate outcomes.

One of the most powerful examples of institutional racism is found within clinical algorithms and diagnostic tools themselves. For decades, many formulas used in daily practice have included "race correction" factors, which treat socially constructed race as a biological variable. A prominent case is the formula for estimating Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), a key measure of kidney function. Older equations included a multiplier for individuals identified as Black, which systematically inflated their eGFR scores. For a patient at the margin, this seemingly small adjustment has profound clinical consequences. For instance, a Black patient whose true kidney function corresponds to an eGFR of $50$ might have been assigned a race-corrected eGFR of $58$. This change, while numerically small, can mean the difference between one clinical action and another. In this specific scenario, the uncorrected value of $50$ would trigger a guideline-recommended medication dose reduction for a renally cleared drug, whereas the inflated value of $58$ would not. While this particular patient might not cross the threshold for a change in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging or an automatic nephrology referral, the single change in medication management represents a tangible "care escalation" that was masked by the race-based formula. Eliminating such race corrections is a concrete step in dismantling institutional racism embedded in the tools of medicine [@problem_id:4396481].

This issue extends beyond simple formulas to complex predictive algorithms used in Clinical Decision Support (CDS). Algorithmic bias can manifest in two distinct ways. *Statistical bias* refers to [systematic errors](@entry_id:755765) in model performance for a specific subgroup. For example, if a cardiovascular risk calculator, like the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE), is trained on a dataset predominantly composed of White individuals, it may poorly calibrate to other groups. If it predicts an average risk of $0.18$ for Black women in a clinic where their observed event rate is only $0.12$, it is statistically biased and may lead to overtreatment. In contrast, *social bias* describes how an algorithm with apparently fair statistical properties can still produce inequitable outcomes due to its application within a structurally unequal society. Imagine a critical care triage score, such as the SOFA score, that has equal sensitivity and specificity for two groups. If the disease prevalence is much higher in the group from a structurally disadvantaged neighborhood, the positive predictive value of an alert will be higher for that group. Applying a single, uniform cutoff threshold for allocating a scarce resource like a ventilator will result in the low-prevalence group being prioritized more often, as their positive alerts are less likely to be false positives. This demonstrates how a "fair" algorithm can have an unfair impact when deployed in a setting of background inequity [@problem_id:4396488].

Disparities also emerge from patterns of care delivery. In mental health, for example, structural racism can manifest as differential rates of coercion. A clinic might observe that Black clients are twice as likely to be placed on an involuntary hold (18% vs. 9%) and three times as likely to be physically restrained as White clients. Such data are not evidence of differential patient characteristics but are powerful signals of systemic bias, weakened therapeutic alliances, and a failure to build trust, all of which undermine the core tenets of recovery-oriented care, such as autonomy and hope [@problem_id:4753680].

### Designing Structurally Competent Interventions

Recognizing structural problems is a necessary first step; the next is designing interventions that address them. A structurally competent approach moves beyond blaming individuals and instead seeks to re-engineer the systems and environments that produce poor health.

Consider a primary care clinic serving a neighborhood shaped by historical redlining. This legacy of disinvestment is not an abstract concept; it manifests as tangible barriers to care. Patients may face long transit times to the clinic, a low density of local pharmacies, and employment in jobs with variable shifts that conflict with standard clinic hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday-Friday). These structural barriers predictably lead to poor outcomes, such as a high rate of uncontrolled hypertension (48%). A structurally competent response does not focus on patient education pamphlets or scolding for nonadherence. Instead, it redesigns the care model to dismantle these barriers. Concrete interventions could include extending clinic hours to evenings and weekends to accommodate shift workers and launching a remote hypertension management program. Such a program could use home blood pressure monitors and clinical pharmacists to titrate medications, with free home delivery of prescriptions to bypass the challenges of pharmacy access. The success of such an intervention would be measured not by patient satisfaction alone, but by improvements in hard outcomes like blood pressure control rates and medication adherence (e.g., raising the mean Proportion of Days Covered from $0.60$ to $\ge 0.80$) [@problem_id:4396490].

A critical component of any intervention is building institutional trust. Decades of medical abuse and systemic neglect, epitomized by the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, have created a rational and persistent mistrust of medical institutions in many minoritized communities. This history is not merely academic; it is a living memory transmitted through generations that shapes how community members perceive an institution's actions. The revelation of the Tuskegee Study, where effective treatment was withheld for decades from African American men, provided powerful evidence of institutional betrayal that cannot be erased simply by establishing formal reforms like Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Persistent distrust is a rational updating of belief in the face of salient violations of ethical conduct [@problem_id:4780573].

Therefore, increasing engagement with services like prenatal genetic counseling in a community with a history of mistrust requires more than just better advertising. Patients often cite fears of data misuse, confidentiality breaches, and negative past experiences, alongside logistical barriers. An effective strategy must acknowledge that historical abuses and ongoing structural racism have reduced the perceived trustworthiness of institutions. It must be a multi-level, trust-building effort that combines community-based participatory approaches, recruitment of counselors from the served community, transparent communication about data use and privacy protections like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), and concrete logistical support like transportation and childcare. Critically, it must empower patients by respecting their autonomy and ensuring they can easily opt-out without penalty. This approach focuses on making the *system* trustworthy, rather than demanding trust from patients [@problem_id:4717481].

To ensure these interventions are effective, health systems must define and measure success in equity-focused terms. In a quality improvement (QI) project, this means writing a "SMART" (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) aim statement that explicitly targets disparity reduction. An aim statement like "increase blood pressure control" is insufficient, as overall improvement can mask a stable or widening racial gap. A structurally competent aim statement would be, for example: "Within 6 months, increase the proportion of non-Hispanic Black adult patients with controlled blood pressure from 48% to 60% and reduce the Black–White control gap from 17 percentage points to no more than 8 percentage points." This dual target ensures that the intervention is judged by its success in closing the equity gap, not just by population-wide averages [@problem_id:4396505].

### Institutional and System-Level Transformation

While program-level interventions are vital, lasting change requires transforming the institutions themselves—their policies, governance structures, and legal obligations. This involves moving upstream to alter the rules and resource flows that generate inequities in the first place.

Institutional racism often operates through seemingly "neutral" policies that have a disparate impact. For example, a hospital policy that approves charity care only for patients with documented employment ($C = \mathbb{1}[E=1]$) may appear race-neutral. However, structural racism in the broader society (e.g., labor market segmentation, immigration documentation regimes) can make it harder for individuals from historically marginalized racial groups to have formal, documented employment, independent of their income or need for care. This creates a causal pathway where race ($R$) influences exposure to structural factors ($S$), which in turn affects the probability of having documented employment ($E$), ultimately determining eligibility for charity care ($C$). The policy, therefore, becomes a mechanism of institutional racism ($R \to S \to E \to C$). A structurally competent redesign would scrap the biased proxy of employment and instead make eligibility contingent on the actual variables of interest: financial need (e.g., income below a poverty threshold, $I \le \theta$) and/or clinical need ($N \ge \eta$) [@problem_id:4396499].

To drive such changes, equity oversight must be embedded into the highest levels of institutional governance. A voluntary, advisory diversity council is insufficient. A robust reform would involve amending corporate bylaws to create a board-level Equity and Civil Rights Committee with the binding authority to approve or block major strategic decisions, such as service line closures or capital projects, pending the results of a rigorous equity impact assessment. To ensure accountability, executive compensation can be tied to achieving stratified equity metrics, and a transparent grievance process can be established. Such a structure is not only ethically necessary but also legally feasible, aligning with compliance obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section $1557$ of the Affordable Care Act [@problem_id:4396491]. For individual clinicians, an expanded professional oath that commits them to mitigating structural harms makes such work an ethical obligation. This includes not only systematic screening and referral for social needs during clinical encounters but also feasible, professional advocacy within the institution and in broader policy forums to address the root causes of patient suffering [@problem_id:4887618].

Indeed, a rich body of federal and state law provides powerful levers for change. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), ACA Section $1557$, and state-level anti-discrimination laws create a dense web of obligations for any hospital receiving federal funds. These laws explicitly prohibit many of the classic manifestations of institutional racism in acute care settings. For example, a proposal to "redirect" uninsured patients from the Emergency Department without a medical screening examination, to demand an upfront copay before triage, to provide English-only services for patients with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), or to divert publicly insured patients while accepting privately insured ones would all constitute flagrant violations of these intersecting legal mandates. These legal frameworks provide a floor of non-discriminatory conduct and a tool for holding institutions accountable [@problem_id:4396442].

Evaluating the impact of these large-scale changes requires rigorous methods. When a health system considers a major structural change like a merger, a structurally competent equity impact assessment must go beyond standard antitrust analysis. While calculating the change in market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is important, an equity lens demands a deeper look. It requires a granular analysis of the merger's impact on essential "safety-net" service lines (like inpatient psychiatry or Medicaid obstetrics) and a stratified analysis of geographic access, measuring changes in travel time for public transit-dependent populations in minoritized neighborhoods [@problem_id:4396472]. Furthermore, when evaluating the causal effect of a system-wide intervention, such as an anti-racism training rolled out across multiple clinics, it is crucial to use modern [quasi-experimental methods](@entry_id:636714). A staggered [difference-in-differences](@entry_id:636293) design, which carefully compares newly treated clinics to not-yet-treated clinics, can help isolate the training's true effect. This requires explicitly testing the "parallel trends" assumption—that the groups would have evolved similarly in the absence of the intervention—and accounting for potential spillovers between sites [@problem_id:4396501].

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Historical and Community-Based Perspectives

The work of structural competency is inherently interdisciplinary. Understanding and intervening in complex systems requires drawing upon history to understand how structures were built, and upon community-based methods to ensure that solutions are equitable and accountable to the people they are meant to serve.

Present-day institutional structures are not accidents; they are the product of historical processes. The Flexner Report of $1910$, for instance, is celebrated for professionalizing American medicine by demanding that medical schools affiliate with universities and adopt a rigorous scientific curriculum. This reform, however, had a disparate impact. It led to the closure of the vast majority of proprietary schools, including five of the seven Black medical colleges that existed at the time. It also placed immense pressure on women's medical colleges, which were often freestanding and less resourced. While a well-endowed, university-affiliated school (whether co-educational or men-only) thrived, the freestanding women's colleges faced immense pressure to merge or close. This history illustrates how a large-scale reform, even one with laudable goals, can have unintended structural consequences that reinforce existing social hierarchies [@problem_id:4769760].

Recognizing that research itself has been a tool of institutional racism, a structurally competent approach must also transform the process of knowledge creation. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) provides a framework for shifting from an extractive model, where researchers take data from a community, to an equitable partnership. Operationalizing this requires creating governance structures that formally share power. This can be achieved through mechanisms like a joint community-university governing board with equal voting weights, supermajority rules for sensitive decisions (like data use and publication), and community control over data through a jointly governed data trust. By including funded fellowships for community members and mandating a workgroup focused on translating findings into policy change, the research process itself becomes an intervention that builds community capacity and is accountable for producing tangible benefits [@problem_id:4396480].

### Conclusion

The applications explored in this chapter demonstrate that structural competency and the analysis of institutional racism are far from abstract academic exercises. They represent a practical and essential framework for anyone committed to health equity. Whether by redesigning a clinical algorithm, re-engineering a care delivery model, rewriting institutional policy, leveraging legal protections, or forming genuine community partnerships, this approach provides the tools to move beyond describing disparities and toward actively dismantling the structures that produce them. This work is challenging, requiring rigorous analysis, multi-level intervention, and interdisciplinary collaboration, but it is fundamental to the mission of creating a just and equitable health system.
