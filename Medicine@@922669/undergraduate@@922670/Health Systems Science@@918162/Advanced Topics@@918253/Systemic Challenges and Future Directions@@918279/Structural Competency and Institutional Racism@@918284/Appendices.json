Using only the definitions of probability, odds, risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio from epidemiology, compute the following measures comparing Black to White patients: risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio for hypertension control. Then, briefly interpret what each measure implies about inequity and how a structurally competent clinician or health system leader might act on it.\n\nProvide your final numerical results in the order risk difference, risk ratio, odds ratio.

The comparison group is Black patients and the reference group is White patients.\n\n1.  **Risk Difference ($RD$)**\n    The risk difference is an absolute measure of effect, defined as the difference in the probability (or risk) of the outcome between the comparison and reference groups.\n    $$ RD = P_{\\text{comparison}} - P_{\\text{reference}} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ RD = P_{B} - P_{W} = 0.55 - 0.70 = -0.15 $$\n    As an exact simplified fraction, this is:\n    $$ RD = -\\frac{15}{100} = -\\frac{3}{20} $$\n\n2.  **Risk Ratio ($RR$)**\n    The risk ratio is a relative measure of effect, defined as the ratio of the probability of the outcome in the comparison group to that in the reference group.\n    $$ RR = \\frac{P_{\\text{comparison}}}{P_{\\text{reference}}} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ RR = \\frac{P_{B}}{P_{W}} = \\frac{0.55}{0.70} $$\n    Simplifying the fraction:\n    $$ RR = \\frac{55}{70} = \\frac{11 \\times 5}{14 \\times 5} = \\frac{11}{14} $$\n\n3.  **Odds Ratio ($OR$)**\n    The odds ratio is another relative measure of effect, defined as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the comparison group to the odds of the outcome in the reference group. The odds of an event with probability $P$ are given by $Odds = \\frac{P}{1-P}$.\n\n    First, we calculate the odds for each group.\n    Odds of controlled hypertension for Black patients ($O_{B}$):\n    $$ O_{B} = \\frac{P_{B}}{1 - P_{B}} = \\frac{0.55}{1 - 0.55} = \\frac{0.55}{0.45} = \\frac{55}{45} = \\frac{11}{9} $$\n    Odds of controlled hypertension for White patients ($O_{W}$):\n    $$ O_{W} = \\frac{P_{W}}{1 - P_{W}} = \\frac{0.70}{1 - 0.70} = \\frac{0.70}{0.30} = \\frac{7}{3} $$\n\n    The odds ratio is the ratio of these odds:\n    $$ OR = \\frac{O_{\\text{comparison}}}{O_{\\text{reference}}} = \\frac{O_{B}}{O_{W}} $$\n    Substituting the calculated odds:\n    $$ OR = \\frac{11/9}{7/3} = \\frac{11}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{11 \\times 3}{3 \\times 3 \\times 7} = \\frac{11}{21} $$\n\n**Interpretation and Actionable Insights**\n\n-   **Risk Difference ($RD = -0.15$):** This absolute measure implies that the probability of having controlled blood pressure is $15$ percentage points lower among Black patients compared to White patients in this care network. This translates to an excess of $150$ cases of uncontrolled hypertension for every $1000$ Black patients compared to every $1000$ White patients. This metric highlights the public health burden of the disparity.\n-   **Risk Ratio ($RR = \\frac{11}{14} \\approx 0.7857$):** This relative measure indicates that Black patients are approximately $0.79$ times as likely as White patients to have their hypertension controlled. A value less than $1$ signifies a lower probability in the comparison group. It can be stated that Black patients have a $100 \\times (1 - 0.7857) \\approx 21.4\\%$ lower risk of hypertension control compared to White patients.\n-   **Odds Ratio ($OR = \\frac{11}{21} \\approx 0.5238$):** This relative measure shows that the odds of having controlled hypertension are about $48\\%$ lower for Black patients than for White patients (since $1 - 0.5238 = 0.4762$). The odds for Black patients are about $0.52$ times the odds for White patients. The $OR$ is further from $1$ than the $RR$, which is mathematically expected when the outcome is common (here, the prevalence is $>10\\%$ in both groups).\n\nA **structurally competent** approach interprets these metrics not as evidence of individual failing or biological predisposition, but as quantitative signals of systemic and structural failures that produce inequitable outcomes. A structurally competent clinician or health system leader would act on these findings by:\n1.  **Investigating Root Causes:** Moving beyond the clinic walls to understand the social and economic drivers of this disparity. This includes assessing barriers such as transportation to pharmacies, cost of medications, food deserts that impede heart-healthy diets, and stressors related to racism and economic precarity.\n2.  **Redesigning Care Delivery:** A system leader would analyze care processes to identify and dismantle sources of institutional bias. This could involve standardizing treatment protocols to reduce discretionary clinical decisions where implicit bias might operate, implementing proactive outreach and follow-up for patients from marginalized groups, and co-designing interventions with community members.\n3.  **Integrating Social and Medical Care:** A clinician can screen for social determinants of health and use team-based care models (e.g., involving community health workers, social workers) to connect patients with resources that address their material needs, which are fundamental to managing a chronic condition like hypertension.\n\nThese metrics, therefore, are not an endpoint but a starting point for a rigorous, data-driven inquiry into the structural sources of health inequity and for measuring the impact of systemic interventions.\n\nThe final numerical values, presented as exact simplified fractions in the requested order (risk difference, risk ratio, odds ratio), are $-\\frac{3}{20}$, $\\frac{11}{14}$, and $\\frac{11}{21}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{3}{20} & \\frac{11}{14} & \\frac{11}{21} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4396474"}, {"introduction": "Structural inequities are often produced by mechanisms hidden within the routine functioning of a health system.

For the remaining $40\\%$ of Black patients, the device is unbiased. Assume the occurrence of overreading is independent of the true SpO2.\n- Among patients whose true SpO2 is below $92\\%$, the true SpO2 values are uniformly distributed on the interval $[88\\%, 92\\%)$. Outside this interval, you may assume that values do not affect eligibility because the threshold rule depends only on whether the observed SpO2 is above or below $92\\%$.\n- Ignore random measurement noise aside from the stated bias.\n\nUsing only the threshold rule, basic probability definitions, and the properties of the uniform distribution, compute the change in eligibility for supplemental oxygen in this Black cohort induced by the device bias.

The change is defined as the difference between the probability of being deemed eligible based on an observed measurement and the probability of being eligible based on the true physiological state.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information. Let $S_t$ be the true peripheral capillary oxygen saturation and $S_o$ be the observed reading from the device. All saturation values are expressed in percentage points.\n\nThe eligibility criterion is based on the observed reading: a patient is eligible if $S_o < 92$.\nThe true prevalence of hypoxemia is given as $\\Pr(S_t < 92) = 0.40$. This represents the fraction of the cohort that should be eligible based on their true condition. Let $T$ be the event that a patient is truly hypoxemic, i.e., $T = \\{S_t < 92\\}$. So, $\\Pr(T) = 0.40$.\n\nThe device bias is described as follows:\nLet $B$ be the event that a patient is measured with a biased device. We are given $\\Pr(B) = 0.60$. For this group, the device overreads by an additive $3$ points, so $S_o = S_t + 3$.\nLet $U$ be the event that a patient is measured with an unbiased device. This is the complementary event to $B$, so $\\Pr(U) = 1 - \\Pr(B) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$. For this group, $S_o = S_t$.\nThe problem states that the occurrence of overreading is independent of the true $S_t$.\n\nThe quantity to calculate is $\\Delta = \\Pr(\\text{eligible based on observed SpO2}) - \\Pr(\\text{eligible based on true SpO2})$.\nLet $O$ be the event that a patient is deemed eligible based on the observed reading, i.e., $O = \\{S_o < 92\\}$.\nThe definition of $\\Delta$ can be written as:\n$$ \\Delta = \\Pr(O) - \\Pr(T) $$\nWe are given $\\Pr(T) = 0.40$. Our main task is to compute $\\Pr(O)$.\n\nWe can calculate $\\Pr(O)$ using the law of total probability, by conditioning on whether the device is biased ($B$) or unbiased ($U$):\n$$ \\Pr(O) = \\Pr(O|B)\\Pr(B) + \\Pr(O|U)\\Pr(U) $$\n\nLet's evaluate each term.\n\n1.  Contribution from the unbiased group, $\\Pr(O|U)$:\n    If the device is unbiased (event $U$), then $S_o = S_t$. The condition for observed eligibility, $S_o < 92$, becomes $S_t < 92$.\n    Therefore, $\\Pr(O|U) = \\Pr(S_t < 92 | U)$.\n    Since the device bias is independent of the true $S_t$, we have $\\Pr(S_t < 92 | U) = \\Pr(S_t < 92) = \\Pr(T) = 0.40$.\n\n2.  Contribution from the biased group, $\\Pr(O|B)$:\n    If the device is biased (event $B$), then $S_o = S_t + 3$. The condition for observed eligibility, $S_o < 92$, becomes $S_t + 3 < 92$, which simplifies to $S_t < 89$.\n    Therefore, $\\Pr(O|B) = \\Pr(S_t < 89 | B)$.\n    Again, due to the independence of bias and true $S_t$, we have $\\Pr(S_t < 89 | B) = \\Pr(S_t < 89)$.\n\nTo find $\\Pr(S_t < 89)$, we use the provided information about the distribution of $S_t$ for hypoxemic patients. We are told that for patients with true SpO2 below $92\\%$ (event $T$), the values are uniformly distributed on the interval $[88, 92)$.\nThis means the conditional distribution of $S_t$ given $T$ is $S_t | T \\sim U(88, 92)$.\n\nThe event $\\{S_t < 89\\}$ is a subset of the event $T = \\{S_t < 92\\}$, so their intersection is just $\\{S_t < 89\\}$. We can use the definition of conditional probability, $\\Pr(A \\cap C) = \\Pr(A|C)\\Pr(C)$, to find $\\Pr(S_t < 89)$:\n$$ \\Pr(S_t < 89) = \\Pr(\\{S_t < 89\\} \\cap T) = \\Pr(S_t < 89 | T) \\Pr(T) $$\nWe need to calculate $\\Pr(S_t < 89 | T)$. Given that $S_t | T$ follows a uniform distribution on $[88, 92)$, the probability of $S_t$ falling into a subinterval $[a, b]$ is given by $\\frac{b-a}{92-88}$. The event $S_t < 89$ corresponds to the subinterval $[88, 89)$ because the distribution's support starts at $88$.\n$$ \\Pr(S_t < 89 | T) = \\frac{89 - 88}{92 - 88} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nNow, we can find the unconditional probability $\\Pr(S_t < 89)$:\n$$ \\Pr(S_t < 89) = \\Pr(S_t < 89 | T) \\Pr(T) = 0.25 \\times 0.40 = 0.10 $$\nSo, for the biased group, the probability of being deemed eligible is $\\Pr(O|B) = 0.10$.\n\nNow we substitute the conditional probabilities back into the formula for $\\Pr(O)$:\n$$ \\Pr(O) = \\Pr(O|B)\\Pr(B) + \\Pr(O|U)\\Pr(U) $$\n$$ \\Pr(O) = (0.10)(0.60) + (0.40)(0.40) $$\n$$ \\Pr(O) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 $$\n\nThis is the probability that a randomly selected patient from this cohort is eligible for oxygen based on the observed SpO2 reading.\n\nFinally, we compute the change in eligibility, $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\Pr(O) - \\Pr(T) $$\n$$ \\Delta = 0.22 - 0.40 = -0.18 $$\nThe negative sign indicates a net decrease in eligibility.
