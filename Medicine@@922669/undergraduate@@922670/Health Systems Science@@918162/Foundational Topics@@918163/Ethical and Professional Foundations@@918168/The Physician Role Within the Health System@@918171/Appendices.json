We will use the principles of conditional probability, specifically Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n$D$: The patient has a Group A Streptococcus infection.\n$D^c$: The patient does not have a Group A Streptococcus infection (the complement of $D$).\n$T^+$: The Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) result is positive.\n$T^-$: The RADT result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability of infection is $P(D) = p = 0.30$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nThe quantity to be calculated is the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have the values for $P(T^+ | D)$ and $P(D)$. We need to determine the values for $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nThe probability $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease, also known as the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since for a patient without the disease, the test can only be positive or negative, we have:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c))$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85 \\times 0.30) + (0.05 \\times 0.70)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.255 + 0.035 = 0.290$$\n\nWith $P(T^+)$ calculated, we can now substitute all values back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.30}{0.290}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.255}{0.290} \\approx 0.87931034...$$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.8793$$\n\nFor the second part of the task, we interpret this result. The clinic's Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) policy recommends antibiotic therapy when the post-test probability is at least $0.60$. Our calculated posterior probability is approximately $0.8793$. Since $0.8793 > 0.60$, the condition for treatment is met. Therefore, based on this probabilistic analysis and the clinic's policy, antibiotic therapy is warranted.\n\nThe primary assumptions in this calculation are:\n1. The patient is representative of the population for which the pretest probability $p$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$ were determined.\n2. The values for $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$ provided in the problem are accurate and applicable to this specific clinical scenario.\n3.

It is a well-defined quantitative problem in applied health economics. I will now proceed with the four tasks specified in the problem statement to derive the solution.\n\n### Task 1: Compute Expected QALYs\n\nFor a given therapy, the expected QALYs ($Q$) are the sum of QALYs accrued each year. The QALYs for a year are the product of the utility for that year and the probability of being alive at the start of that year. Let $A(t)$ be the probability of being alive at the start of year $t$. We have $A(1) = 1$, $A(2) = s(1)$, and $A(3) = s(1) \\times s(2)$.\n\n**Standard Therapy (S):**\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $1$: $A_S(1) = 1$.\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $2$: $A_S(2) = s_S(1) = 0.95$.\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $3$: $A_S(3) = s_S(1) \\times s_S(2) = 0.95 \\times 0.90 = 0.855$.\n\nThe expected QALYs for therapy $S$ are:\n$$ Q_S = \\sum_{t=1}^{3} A_S(t) \\times U_S(t) $$\n$$ Q_S = (1 \\times 0.70) + (0.95 \\times 0.65) + (0.855 \\times 0.60) $$\n$$ Q_S = 0.70 + 0.6175 + 0.513 = 1.8305 \\text{ QALYs} $$\n\n**New Therapy (N):**\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $1$: $A_N(1) = 1$.\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $2$: $A_N(2) = s_N(1) = 0.96$.\n- Probability of being alive at start of year $3$: $A_N(3) = s_N(1) \\times s_N(2) = 0.96 \\times 0.92 = 0.8832$.\n\nThe expected QALYs for therapy $N$ are:\n$$ Q_N = \\sum_{t=1}^{3} A_N(t) \\times U_N(t) $$\n$$ Q_N = (1 \\times 0.78) + (0.96 \\times 0.72) + (0.8832 \\times 0.68) $$\n$$ Q_N = 0.78 + 0.6912 + 0.600576 = 2.071776 \\text{ QALYs} $$\n\n### Task 2: Compute Expected Costs\n\nExpected cost ($C$) is the sum of the one-time initiation cost and the expected annual costs. The annual costs are accrued by patients alive at the start of each year.\n\n**Standard Therapy (S):**\n- Per-year cost (if alive): $C_{S, \\text{year}} = C_{S, \\text{maint}} + (p_{S, \\text{hosp}} \\times C_{\\text{hosp}})$\n$$ C_{S, \\text{year}} = \\$4,000 + (0.20 \\times \\$12,000) = \\$4,000 + \\$2,400 = \\$6,400 $$\n- Total expected cost: $C_S = C_{S, \\text{init}} + \\sum_{t=1}^{3} A_S(t) \\times C_{S, \\text{year}}$\n$$ C_S = \\$1,000 + (1 + 0.95 + 0.855) \\times \\$6,400 $$\n$$ C_S = \\$1,000 + (2.805) \\times \\$6,400 = \\$1,000 + \\$17,952 = \\$18,952 $$\n\n**New Therapy (N):**\n- Per-year cost (if alive): $C_{N, \\text{year}} = C_{N, \\text{maint}} + (p_{N, \\text{hosp}} \\times C_{\\text{hosp}})$\n$$ C_{N, \\text{year}} = \\$9,000 + (0.10 \\times \\$12,000) = \\$9,000 + \\$1,200 = \\$10,200 $$\n- Total expected cost: $C_N = C_{N, \\text{init}} + \\sum_{t=1}^{3} A_N(t) \\times C_{N, \\text{year}}$\n$$ C_N = \\$2,000 + (1 + 0.96 + 0.8832) \\times \\$10,200 $$\n$$ C_N = \\$2,000 + (2.8432) \\times \\$10,200 = \\$2,000 + \\$28,990.64 = \\$30,990.64 $$\n\n### Task 3: Derive the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)\n\nThe ICER is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness (QALYs gained).\n- **Incremental Cost ($\\Delta C$)**:\n$$ \\Delta C = C_N - C_S = \\$30,990.64 - \\$18,952.00 = \\$12,038.64 $$\n- **Incremental Effectiveness ($\\Delta E$)**:\n$$ \\Delta E = Q_N - Q_S = 2.071776 - 1.8305 = 0.241276 \\text{ QALYs} $$\n- **ICER**:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\$12,038.64}{0.241276 \\text{ QALYs}} \\approx \\$49,901.89 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\n### Task 4: Justify the Adoption Decision\n\nThe calculated ICER of approximately $\\$49,902$ per QALY is less than the stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $\\$50,000$ per QALY. In cost-effectiveness analysis, an intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is below the WTP threshold. Therefore, the new therapy $N$ provides additional health benefits (QALYs) at an incremental cost that the health system considers acceptable value for money. As a physician practicing with a responsibility for resource stewardship within this system, the evidence-based decision is to adopt the new therapy for the cohort of clinically appropriate patients.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on the derived results.\n\n**A. The ICER is approximately $\\$44,950$ per QALY; adopt the new therapy for eligible patients because it is cost-effective under the $\\$50,000$ per QALY threshold and aligns with evidence-based shared decision-making and resource stewardship.**\n- The stated ICER of $\\$44,950$ is numerically incorrect. My calculation based on the problem's data yields an ICER of approximately $\\$49,902$. The error is about $10\\%$, which is not a trivial rounding difference.\n- The decision to \"adopt\" is **correct**.\n- The justification \"because it is cost-effective under the $\\$50,000$ per QALY threshold\" is **correct**, as $\\$49,902 < \\$50,000$.\n- The additional justification regarding \"evidence-based shared decision-making and resource stewardship\" is also **correct** and consistent with the role of a physician in modern health systems.\nDespite the numerical error in the first clause, the decision and justification are entirely correct.\n\n**B. The ICER is approximately $\\$11,525$ per QALY because the cost difference equals the ratio; adopt since the incremental cost is below the threshold.**\n- The stated ICER is incorrect. The reasoning \"because the cost difference equals the ratio\" is nonsensical. The ICER is a ratio, not equal to the cost difference.\n- The justification \"adopt since the incremental cost is below the threshold\" is also incorrect; the decision criterion is the ICER compared to the WTP threshold, not the absolute incremental cost. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The ICER is approximately $\\$256$ per QALY by dividing the incremental effectiveness by the incremental cost; adopt because it is far below the threshold.**\n- The stated ICER is incorrect. The option explicitly states an incorrect formula for the ICER ($\\Delta E / \\Delta C$, which is the inverse). The value of $\\Delta E / \\Delta C$ would be $0.241276 / 12038.64 \\approx 0.00002$, not $256$. The calculation method described is fundamentally wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The ICER is approximately $\\$44,950$ per QALY; do not adopt because the new therapy increases total costs and the threshold represents a strict budget cap.**\n- The stated ICER is numerically incorrect.\n- The decision to \"do not adopt\" is **incorrect**. The ICER is below the WTP threshold.\n- The justification \"because the new therapy increases total costs\" is a classic error in interpreting cost-effectiveness; the goal is not merely to minimize cost, but to maximize value. The WTP threshold defines acceptable value for increased costs. The justification that the \"threshold represents a strict budget cap\" is also a misinterpretation of a WTP threshold. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The ICER is approximately $\\$50,000$ per QALY; adopt only if the individual patient’s personal valuation exceeds $\\$50,000$, regardless of system WTP thresholds.**\n- The stated ICER of $\\$50,000$ is the best numerical approximation to the calculated value of $\\$49,902$.\n- However, the justification for the adoption decision is fundamentally flawed. The problem specifies a physician working within a system that uses system-level cost-effectiveness principles and a system WTP threshold. The justification to ignore the system's framework in favor of an individual's personal valuation (which may be un-knowable or different) contradicts the physician's stated role and the principles of resource stewardship in a population context. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMy calculation yields an ICER of $\\$49,901.89$ per QALY. This is below the $\\$50,000$ WTP threshold, making the new therapy cost-effective and the appropriate decision being to adopt it.\n\n- Options B, C, D, and E all contain fundamental errors in their reasoning or recommended action.\n- Option A contains a numerical error for the ICER value. However, its recommended action (\"adopt\") and its entire justification (\"because it is cost-effective under the... threshold and aligns with... resource stewardship\") are perfectly correct according to the principles of health systems science and the result of the correct calculation.\n\nGiven that all other options have critical flaws in their logic, Option A, despite its numerical inaccuracy, represents the best available answer as it correctly identifies the decision and the reasoning that follows from a proper cost-effectiveness analysis. The numerical discrepancy is most likely due to a typo in the option's text.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4400980"}, {"introduction": "As healthcare becomes increasingly reliant on data-driven tools, physicians must assume a critical role in overseeing the ethical implementation of clinical algorithms.

The problem requires $\\mathrm{TPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}(t_{B})$ and $\\mathrm{FPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{FPR}_{B}(t_{B})$. As will be shown in the derivation, for the specified Gaussian model with a shared variance $\\sigma^2$, these two conditions are simultaneously satisfiable if and only if $\\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{A0} = \\mu_{B1} - \\mu_{B0}$. Using the given parameters, we verify this condition: $\\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{A0} = 0.9 - 0.3 = 0.6$ and $\\mu_{B1} - \\mu_{B0} = 1.2 - 0.6 = 0.6$. The condition holds. Therefore, the problem is not overconstrained or contradictory.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the thresholds $t_{A}$ and $t_{B}$ for two demographic groups, $A$ and $B$, that satisfy the equalized odds fairness criterion while meeting a specific sensitivity (TPR) target of $0.85$.\n\nFirst, we express the True Positive Rate ($\\mathrm{TPR}$) and False Positive Rate ($\\mathrm{FPR}$) in terms of the parameters of the Normal distribution. Let $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ be a standard normal random variable, and let $\\Phi(z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq z)$ be its cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n\nFor any group $g \\in \\{A, B\\}$, the TPR at a threshold $t_g$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPR}_{g}(t_{g}) = \\mathbb{P}(S \\geq t_{g} \\mid Y=1, g)\n$$\nSince $S \\mid (Y=1, g) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{g1}, \\sigma^2)$, we can standardize the variable:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPR}_{g}(t_{g}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{S - \\mu_{g1}}{\\sigma} \\geq \\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g1}}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g1}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g1}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, the FPR at threshold $t_g$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FPR}_{g}(t_{g}) = \\mathbb{P}(S \\geq t_{g} \\mid Y=0, g)\n$$\nSince $S \\mid (Y=0, g) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{g0}, \\sigma^2)$, we standardize:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FPR}_{g}(t_{g}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{S - \\mu_{g0}}{\\sigma} \\geq \\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g0}}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g0}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{g} - \\mu_{g0}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe equalized odds criterion requires two conditions to be met for the chosen thresholds $(t_A, t_B)$:\n1. $\\mathrm{TPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}(t_{B})$\n2. $\\mathrm{FPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{FPR}_{B}(t_{B})$\n\nFrom the first condition, we have:\n$$\n1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A1}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{B} - \\mu_{B1}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\Phi$ is a strictly increasing function, this equality implies that the arguments of $\\Phi$ must be equal:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A1}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{t_{B} - \\mu_{B1}}{\\sigma} \\implies t_{A} - \\mu_{A1} = t_{B} - \\mu_{B1}\n$$\nFrom the second condition, we have:\n$$\n1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A0}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{B} - \\mu_{B0}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nThis likewise implies:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A0}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{t_{B} - \\mu_{B0}}{\\sigma} \\implies t_{A} - \\mu_{A0} = t_{B} - \\mu_{B0}\n$$\nThese two derived equations form a system. Rearranging both equations to express $t_{A} - t_{B}$:\n$$\nt_{A} - t_{B} = \\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{B1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_{A} - t_{B} = \\mu_{A0} - \\mu_{B0}\n$$\nFor these conditions to be simultaneously satisfiable, it must be the case that $\\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{B1} = \\mu_{A0} - \\mu_{B0}$, which is equivalent to $\\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{A0} = \\mu_{B1} - \\mu_{B0}$. The problem parameters are constructed such that this holds:\n$$\n\\mu_{A1} - \\mu_{A0} = 0.9 - 0.3 = 0.6\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{B1} - \\mu_{B0} = 1.2 - 0.6 = 0.6\n$$\nThis confirms the internal consistency of the problem setup. Any pair of thresholds $(t_A, t_B)$ satisfying the TPR equality will also satisfy the FPR equality.\n\nThe physician's policy constraint sets the target TPR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{TPR}_{B}(t_{B}) = 0.85\n$$\nWe can use this constraint to solve for $t_{A}$ and $t_{B}$ independently. For group $A$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A1}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 0.85\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A1}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n$$\nLet $\\Phi^{-1}$ denote the quantile function (inverse CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Applying $\\Phi^{-1}$ to both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{A} - \\mu_{A1}}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.15)\n$$\nSolving for $t_A$:\n$$\nt_{A} = \\mu_{A1} + \\sigma \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(0.15)\n$$\nSimilarly, for group $B$:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{B} - \\mu_{B1}}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.15)\n$$\nSolving for $t_B$:\n$$\nt_{B} = \\mu_{B1} + \\sigma \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(0.15)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. The quantile $\\Phi^{-1}(0.15)$ is a standard value, approximately $-1.036433$. The given parameters are $\\mu_{A1} = 0.9$, $\\mu_{B1} = 1.2$, and $\\sigma = 0.2$.\n\nFor threshold $t_{A}$:\n$$\nt_{A} = 0.9 + 0.2 \\times (-1.036433) = 0.9 - 0.2072866 = 0.6927134\n$$\nFor threshold $t_{B}$:\n$$\nt_{B} = 1.2 + 0.2 \\times (-1.036433) = 1.2 - 0.2072866 = 0.9927134\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical thresholds to four significant figures.\n$$\nt_{A} \\approx 0.6927\n$$\n$$\nt_{B} \\approx 0.9927\n$$\nThese thresholds satisfy the policy constraint of $\\mathrm{TPR} = 0.85$ for both groups, and because of the specific structure of the model parameters, they also ensure that $\\mathrm{FPR}_{A}(t_{A}) = \\mathrm{FPR}_{B}(t_{B})$, thus satisfying the equalized odds criterion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6927 & 0.9927\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4401020"}]}
