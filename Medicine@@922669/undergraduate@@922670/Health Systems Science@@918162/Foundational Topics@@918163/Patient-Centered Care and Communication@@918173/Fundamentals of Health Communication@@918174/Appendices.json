Denominator neglect occurs when patients overweight the numerator (e.g., the number of adverse outcomes) and underweight the denominator (e.g., the total number of patients at risk), which can distort perceived risk. Evidence from health communication suggests that conveying risks as natural frequencies rather than as percentages improves comprehension in advanced-undergraduate and lay populations alike. You are tasked with converting the following risks into natural frequencies for a standardized cohort size to support clear consent discussions: a surgical mortality risk of $2\\%$ (that is, $0.02$) and a surgical complication risk (non-fatal) of $15\\%$ (that is, $0.15$). Assume a hypothetical cohort of $1{,}000$ patients undergoing the same operation, that risks are stable across the cohort, and that the complication risk explicitly excludes mortality. Using only fundamental definitions of proportion and frequency, re-express each risk as a whole-number count of patients out of $1{,}000$ to be used verbatim in the consent script. Provide your final answer as a two-entry row matrix, with the first entry equal to the mortality count and the second entry equal to the complication count. Express your final answers as counts of patients (no units inside the final box are required). No rounding rule is needed beyond reporting whole patients, but if a non-integer arises, use the nearest whole patient by conventional rounding to the nearest integer.", "solution": "The goal is to translate stated risks into natural frequencies for a cohort of $1{,}000$ patients using only core definitions relevant to informed consent and basic probability. The relevant fundamental bases are: (i) in health risk communication, a probability $p$ over $N$ identical and independent Bernoulli trials yields an expected count $k$ of events given by $k = p \\times N$, and (ii) a proportion is defined as the ratio of cases to the total, so cases equal proportion times total. Communicating counts rather than percentages mitigates denominator neglect because the denominator $N$ is made explicit.\n\nLet $N = 1{,}000$ be the cohort size. Let $p_{\\text{mort}} = 0.02$ be the probability of mortality. The expected number of deaths is\n$$\nk_{\\text{mort}} = p_{\\text{mort}} \\times N = 0.02 \\times 1{,}000 = 20.\n$$\nThis is already an integer, so no rounding is required.\n\nLet $p_{\\text{comp}} = 0.15$ be the probability of a non-fatal complication, explicitly excluding mortality by the problem’s assumption to ensure clarity in communication and avoid overlap in counts.

In the high-risk subgroup, the observed risk was $20\\%$ without therapy and $15\\%$ with therapy. The analyst must define absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and number needed to treat (NNT), compute them for each subgroup, and present the findings in a way that aligns with ethical communication norms in health systems science (for example, balanced, transparent, and non-misleading risk framing that supports patient autonomy).\n\nFrom first principles that treat risk as the probability of an event over a specified time horizon, choose the single option that correctly:\n- Defines absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and number needed to treat (NNT),\n- Computes these quantities for the moderate-risk and high-risk subgroups given the data above,\n- And presents the results in a patient-facing message that is ethically balanced, including explicit baseline risk, time horizon, and both absolute and relative perspectives.\n\nA.

This includes specifying the time horizon, stating the baseline risk, and presenting both relative (RRR) and absolute (ARR, NNT) measures of benefit.

The scenario is realistic, the data are numerically plausible and consistent, and the terminology is standard within the field (e.g., \"denominator neglect,\" \"natural frequencies,\" \"gist\"). The problem is well-posed, asking for a comparative evaluation of options against a clear set of criteria to find the \"best\" fit. The setup is not contradictory, incomplete, or otherwise flawed. All necessary information is provided to evaluate the options based on the cited principles. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core task is to evaluate four visualization strategies against the provided principles. The key trade-off, or \"gist,\" to be communicated is that $T_1$ offers a greater absolute risk reduction for diabetes progression ($20\\% - 12\\% = 8\\%$) compared to $T_2$ ($20\\% - 15\\% = 5\\%$), but at the cost of a higher risk of nausea ($6\\%$ for $T_1$ versus $2\\%$ for $T_2$). An effective visualization must make this trade-off clear and easy to understand.\n\n**A. Two side-by-side bar charts that display relative risk reductions for diabetes progression for medications $T_1$ and $T_2$ on separate vertical axes, each scaled to maximize visual differences, with outcomes labeled only as percentages; nausea risks are placed in a separate small chart below to avoid clutter.**\n- **Evaluation:** This strategy violates multiple core principles.\n    - **Use of Relative Risk:** It proposes showing relative risk reductions. For $T_1$, the absolute risk reduction is from $20\\%$ to $12\\%$, which is a relative risk reduction of $(20-12)/20 = 40\\%$. For $T_2$, the absolute risk reduction is from $20\\%$ to $15\\%$, a relative risk reduction of $(20-15)/20 = 25\\%$. Relative risk figures tend to inflate the perceived magnitude of the effect and are less well understood by lay audiences than absolute risks.\n    - **Inconsistent Axes:** The proposal to use \"separate vertical axes, each scaled to maximize visual differences\" is a deceptive visualization practice that makes fair comparison impossible and violates scientific transparency.\n    - **Separation of Outcomes:** Placing nausea risk in a \"separate small chart\" hinders the ability of the user to see the benefit-harm trade-off in an integrated way, working against the goal of extracting the complete \"gist\".\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option promotes biased perception and is not transparent.\n\n**B. Two side-by-side icon arrays, each showing $N=100$ individuals for medication $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively, using absolute counts with the same denominator, spatially grouped and color-coded to represent “progression” and “nausea” as distinct segments, with clear legends and textual labels indicating counts (for example, $12$ progress, $6$ nausea for $T_1$; $15$ progress, $2$ nausea for $T_2$). Layout, scale, and denominator are held constant across the two panels.**\n- **Evaluation:** This strategy aligns perfectly with the guiding principles.\n    - **Natural Frequencies and Absolute Risk:** Icon arrays are the canonical method for presenting natural frequencies (e.g., \"$12$ people out of $100$\"). This format is empirically shown to be highly effective, especially for audiences with lower numeracy.\n    - **Consistent and Salient Denominator:** The use of a constant denominator ($N=100$) for both arrays and the visual representation of the entire cohort of $100$ icons directly combats denominator neglect. The part-to-whole relationship is immediately apparent.\n    - **Gist Extraction:** The side-by-side, constant-scale format allows for easy, at-a-glance comparison. The user can visually compare the number of icons colored for \"progression\" ($12$ for $T_1$ vs. $15$ for $T_2$) and for \"nausea\" ($6$ for $T_1$ vs. $2$ for $T_2$). This makes the core trade-off (better efficacy vs. more side effects) visually salient and easy to grasp quickly.\n    - **Scientific Transparency:** This method presents the absolute risk data directly and honestly.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option is a textbook implementation of best practices in risk communication for the stated goals and audience.\n\n**C. A frequency tree for each medication, each beginning with $N=100$ treated individuals, branching into “progression” versus “no progression,” then within each branch further branching into “nausea” versus “no nausea,” with conditional probabilities and counts shown at each node to support step-by-step calculation.**\n- **Evaluation:** While frequency trees are powerful tools for communicating conditional probabilities, they are not optimal for this specific task.\n    - **Complexity and Gist Extraction:** The \"step-by-step\" nature of a frequency tree requires more cognitive effort and time than an icon array. For an audience with \"limited time\" seeking a \"quick grasp of the gist,\" tracing paths through two separate complex trees to make a comparison is inefficient and cognitively demanding.\n    - **Missing Information:** Constructing the tree as described requires knowledge of conditional probabilities (e.g., the probability of nausea *given* progression, $P(\\text{Nausea} | \\text{Progression})$), which are not provided in the problem statement. To proceed, one would have to make an assumption, such as independence, reducing the scientific fidelity of the representation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This format is too complex for the goal of quick, intuitive gist extraction and requires assumptions not supported by the givens.\n\n**D. Two pie charts, one per medication, showing the total percentage of “any event” (progression or nausea combined) as a single slice to simplify the message; each chart is scaled to its group’s sample size from the clinical studies, which happened to be $N=100$ for $T_1$ and $N=200$ for $T_2$; labels emphasize the larger slice to aid attention capture.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is fundamentally flawed and misleading.\n    - **Inconsistent Denominators:** It explicitly uses different denominators ($N=100$ and $N=200$), a practice that is known to induce denominator neglect and make fair comparison extremely difficult. Scaling the chart size by the sample size further confounds the visual information.\n    - **Loss of Information:** Combining \"progression\" and \"nausea\" into a single \"any event\" slice completely obscures the critical trade-off information. A patient cannot make an informed choice without knowing the separate risks for the benefit and the harm. This \"simplification\" makes the data useless for decision-making.\n    - **Poor Visual Encoding:** Pie charts are known to be inferior to bar charts or icon arrays for precise comparison of proportions.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This strategy obscures the essential trade-off, uses inconsistent denominators, and employs poor visualization practices. It is highly likely to mislead the audience.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption B is the only strategy that adheres to all the established principles of effective and transparent risk communication for a lay audience. It uses natural frequencies presented in icon arrays, maintains a consistent and salient denominator, and its design directly supports the rapid, accurate extraction of the essential benefit-harm trade-off.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4371984"}]}
