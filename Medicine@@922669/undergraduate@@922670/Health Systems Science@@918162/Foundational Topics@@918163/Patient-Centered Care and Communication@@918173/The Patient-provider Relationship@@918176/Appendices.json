Do not round.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and evidence-based medicine, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is objective in its framing. The problem asks for standard derivations and a qualitative explanation based on established concepts in health systems science.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{untreated}}$ be the baseline probability of a major cardiovascular event in $5$ years for an untreated patient. Let $P_{\\text{treated}}$ be the probability of the same event for a patient receiving the therapy.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The baseline risk, $P_{\\text{untreated}} = 0.20$.\n- The relative risk reduction, $RRR = 0.25$.\n\nFirst, we derive the treated risk, $P_{\\text{treated}}$. The relative risk reduction ($RRR$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk in the treated group compared to the untreated group. It is expressed as:\n$$RRR = \\frac{P_{\\text{untreated}} - P_{\\text{treated}}}{P_{\\text{untreated}}}$$\nAn alternative but related concept is the relative risk ($RR$), which is the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the untreated group:\n$$RR = \\frac{P_{\\text{treated}}}{P_{\\text{untreated}}}$$\nThe relationship between $RRR$ and $RR$ is derived from the definition of $RRR$:\n$$RRR = \\frac{P_{\\text{untreated}}}{P_{\\text{untreated}}} - \\frac{P_{\\text{treated}}}{P_{\\text{untreated}}} = 1 - RR$$\nWe can solve for $P_{\\text{treated}}$ by first finding the $RR$:\n$$RR = 1 - RRR$$\nSubstituting the given value $RRR = 0.25$:\n$$RR = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\nNow, using the definition of $RR$, we can solve for $P_{\\text{treated}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{treated}} = RR \\times P_{\\text{untreated}}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P_{\\text{treated}} = 0.75 \\times 0.20 = 0.15$$\nThus, the $5$-year probability of a major cardiovascular event for a patient on the therapy is $0.15$.\n\nSecond, we derive the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) from first principles. The $ARR$ is the simple arithmetic difference between the risk in the untreated group and the risk in the treated group. It represents the absolute magnitude of the risk reduction attributable to the therapy.\n$$ARR = P_{\\text{untreated}} - P_{\\text{treated}}$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$ARR = 0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05$$\nThis means the therapy leads to a $5$ percentage point decrease in the risk of a major cardiovascular event over $5$ years.\n\nThird, we derive the number needed to treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated with a specific therapy for a defined period of time to prevent one additional adverse outcome. Mathematically, it is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the $ARR$ we just calculated:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.05} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{100}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20$$\nTherefore, on average, $20$ patients must be treated with this therapy for $5$ years to prevent one major cardiovascular event.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative part of the problem. Within the patient-provider relationship, a core component of health systems science, the way statistical evidence is framed can significantly influence patient perceptions and decisions, a phenomenon known as the framing effect. Shared Decision Making (SDM) requires presenting this information transparently to mitigate cognitive biases and empower patients to make choices aligned with their values.\n\n- **Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$)**: Presenting the benefit as a $RRR$ of $0.25$ (or \"$25\\%$\") can be persuasive because the number appears large. However, it can be misleading if the baseline risk is low, causing patients to overestimate the treatment's benefit. This is the \"less-is-more\" effect where less complete information (omitting baseline risk) has a larger persuasive impact.\n\n- **Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$)**: Presenting the benefit as an $ARR$ of $0.05$ (or \"a $5$ percentage point reduction in risk\") provides a more direct and less inflated measure of a treatment's impact on an individual's outcome. In this case, the risk for the patient changes from $20\\%$ to $15\\%$. While numerically equivalent, a \"$5\\%$\" reduction often sounds less impressive to a layperson than a \"$25\\%$ reduction,\" and using this framing alone might lead a patient to undervalue the therapy.\n\n- **Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$)**: Stating that the $NNT$ is $20$ reframes the benefit in terms of population effort. The patient learns that to prevent one event, $20$ people must be treated (and potentially experience the costs and side effects of the therapy), while $19$ of them will take the therapy without avoiding an event they would not have had anyway, or will have an event regardless. This metric is particularly useful for discussing treatment burdens and for comparing the efficiency of different interventions. A high $NNT$ might discourage a patient, while a low $NNT$ would be very encouraging.\n\n- **Natural Frequencies**: Perhaps the most transparent method is using natural frequencies. For this patient, the provider could say: \"Without any treatment, if we imagine $100$ people just like you, about $20$ of them will have a major cardiovascular event in the next $5$ years. With this treatment, we would expect that number to drop to $15$. So, for every $100$ people we treat, we prevent $5$ events.\" This format avoids the complexities of ratios and percentages and is widely regarded as the most easily understood by patients.\n\n**Communication Strategies**: To mitigate bias and respect patient autonomy, effective communication strategies in SDM include:\n1.  **Presenting multiple frames**: A provider should present both relative and absolute risk reductions to give a complete picture.\n2.  **Using natural frequencies**: This is a preferred method to enhance understanding and reduce misinterpretation.\n3.  **Employing decision aids**: Visual aids like Cates plots (smiley-face plots) can effectively convey event rates with and without treatment.\n4.  **Eliciting patient values**: The core of SDM is to move beyond the numbers to a discussion about what they mean for the patient's life, goals, and fears. The provider must ask questions like, \"Given these numbers, how do you feel about the potential benefits versus the possible side effects and costs?\" This ensures the final choice is not just evidence-based, but also value-concordant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$", "id": "4400648"}, {"introduction": "Truly patient-centered care goes beyond presenting evidence; it involves systematically integrating a patient's unique values and preferences into the decision.
