We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)} $$\n\nThe givens can be formally stated as:\n1.  The prior probability of disease, $P(D) = p = 0.3$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease, $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.9$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease, $P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.8$. Here, $\\neg D$ represents the event of not having the disease.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n- The prior probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n  $$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 $$\n- The probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n  $$ P(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 $$\n\nThe denominator in Bayes' theorem, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D) $$\n\nSubstituting the known values into this formula:\n$$ P(+) = (0.9)(0.3) + (0.2)(0.7) $$\n$$ P(+) = 0.27 + 0.14 $$\n$$ P(+) = 0.41 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the posterior probability $P(D \\mid +)$:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{(0.9)(0.3)}{0.41} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.27}{0.41} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.65853658... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to three significant figures.\n$$ P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.659 $$\n\nThe problem also asks to compare this to the treatment threshold, $p^{*} = 0.5$.\nSince $0.659 > 0.5$, the posterior probability of disease exceeds the treatment threshold.

We are given the following definitions:\n1.  $ARR = p_{0} - p_{1}$\n2.  $RR = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}$\n\nFrom the definition of $RR$, we can express the risk with treatment, $p_{1}$, in terms of $p_{0}$ and $RR$:\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} \\times RR$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_{1}$ into the definition of $ARR$:\n$$ARR = p_{0} - (p_{0} \\times RR)$$\nFactoring out the common term $p_{0}$, we arrive at the desired expression for $ARR$:\n$$ARR = p_{0} (1 - RR)$$\nThis expression allows for the calculation of the individualized absolute risk reduction by applying a relative risk from a population study to an individual's specific baseline risk.\n\nThe second task is to compute the individualized $ARR$ for the patient described. The given values are $p_{0} = 0.4$ and $RR = 0.75$. Substituting these into our derived formula:\n$$ARR = 0.4 \\times (1 - 0.75)$$\n$$ARR = 0.4 \\times 0.25$$\n$$ARR = 0.1$$\nThus, the individualized absolute risk reduction for this patient is $0.1$, which means the program is expected to reduce their personal risk of readmission from $40\\%$ to $30\\%$ (since $p_{1} = p_{0} \\times RR = 0.4 \\times 0.75 = 0.3$). The absolute reduction is $0.4 - 0.3 = 0.1$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the corresponding Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). We are given the definition:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the value of $ARR$ we just calculated:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.1}$$\n$$NNT = 10$$\nThe interpretation of this result is that, for a population of patients with this specific baseline risk, one would need to treat $10$ patients with the transitional care program to prevent one additional hospital readmission over the $90$-day period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "4395484"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decisions rarely hinge on a single factor; they involve balancing effectiveness against side effects, costs, and lifestyle impacts.

To make preferences explicit and transparent, they agree to use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The three criteria are clinical effectiveness, side effect burden, and patient out-of-pocket cost. The MCDA will employ a single cardinal value scale across criteria from $0$ (least preferred for the patient on that criterion) to $10$ (most preferred for the patient on that criterion), with higher scores indicating greater patient preference. To align the side effect burden with the common direction of preference, the side effects criterion is reverse-coded so that a higher score corresponds to fewer or less burdensome side effects. The patient’s preference weights for the three criteria are specified as $w=(0.5,0.3,0.2)$ for effectiveness, side effects, and cost respectively, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i}=1$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (scores, weights, preferential independence) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data is internally consistent; the weights sum to $1$ as stated, and the scores lie within the defined scale. The assumptions provided—mutual preferential independence and linearity of value functions—are the standard theoretical underpinnings required to justify a linear additive value model. The problem is not trivial, as it requires a derivation from first principles, testing foundational knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to determine a single scalar value representing the overall desirability of a treatment option, based on its performance across multiple criteria. This requires the formulation of a multi-attribute value function, $V$, which aggregates the scores on the individual criteria. Let the scores for the $3$ criteria—effectiveness, side effects, and cost—be denoted by $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$ respectively. We seek to define the function $V(s_1, s_2, s_3)$.\n\nThe problem states that the criteria are \"preferentially independent of the others.\" In the context of multi-attribute value theory, mutual preferential independence among a set of attributes is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an additive representation of the multi-attribute value function. This fundamental theorem allows for the decomposition of the overall value into a simple weighted sum of single-attribute value functions.\n\nThe general form of this additive value function is:\n$$V(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i v_i(c_i)$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the performance level on the $i$-th criterion, $v_i(c_i)$ is the single-attribute value function for that criterion (typically scaled from $0$ to $1$), and $k_i$ are the scaling constants or weights.\n\nIn this problem, the patient's scores, $s = (8, 4, 6)$, are explicitly given on a common cardinal value scale from $0$ to $10$. This signifies that the transformation from the natural units of each criterion (e.g., mortality rate, frequency of nausea, dollar amount) to a preference-based value score has already been accomplished by the respective single-attribute value functions $v_i$. The scores $s_i$ are the outputs of these functions, $s_i = v_i(c_i)$, scaled to the range $[0, 10]$. Therefore, we can use these scores directly in our aggregation model.\n\nThe \"appropriate scalar aggregation rule\" derived from these first principles is the linear additive model. The weights $w_i$ provided are the normalized scaling constants, reflecting the patient's stated relative importance of each criterion. The overall decision value, $V_{overall}$, is thus computed as:\n$$V_{overall} = w_1 s_1 + w_2 s_2 + w_3 s_3$$\nThis equation is the specific aggregation rule for this problem.\n\nThe given values are:\n-  Weights: $w_1 = 0.5$ (effectiveness), $w_2 = 0.3$ (side effects), $w_3 = 0.2$ (cost).\n-  Scores: $s_1 = 8$, $s_2 = 4$, $s_3 = 6$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula to compute the overall scalar value:\n$$V_{overall} = (0.5)(8) + (0.3)(4) + (0.2)(6)$$\nCalculating each term in the sum:\n$$V_{overall} = 4.0 + 1.2 + 1.2$$\nSumming the terms yields the final result:\n$$V_{overall} = 6.4$$\nThis value of $6.4$ represents the overall utility of the treatment option for the patient on the $0$ to $10$ scale, synthetically accounting for all criteria according to the patient's stated preferences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.4}$$", "id": "4395448"}]}
