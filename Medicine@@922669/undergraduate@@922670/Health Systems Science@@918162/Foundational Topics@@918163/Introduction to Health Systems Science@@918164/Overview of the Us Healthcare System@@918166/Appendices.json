This practice demystifies these concepts by having you calculate the precise out-of-pocket costs for a member and the corresponding liability for their health plan in a specific scenario. By extending this logic to the entire plan population using a statistical model, you will also derive the plan's actuarial value, a key measure of its overall generosity [@problem_id:4384339].", "problem": "A health plan follows a standard cost-sharing design seen in United States healthcare: an annual deductible $D$, a constant coinsurance rate $\\gamma$ applied to allowed charges above the deductible, and a hard annual out-of-pocket maximum $M$.

First, for a single member with specific annual allowed medical charges, we must determine their out-of-pocket spending and the corresponding amount paid by the health plan. Second, we must model the plan's overall performance by calculating its actuarial value (AV) based on a specified probability distribution for member spending.\n\nFirst, we formalize the cost-sharing structure. Let $C$ represent the total annual allowed charges. The plan has a deductible $D$, a coinsurance rate $\\gamma$, and an out-of-pocket maximum $M$. The member's liability, which we denote as $\\text{MemberPay}(C)$, is determined by a piecewise function of $C$. The plan's liability, $\\text{PlanPay}(C)$, is simply the remaining portion of the charges, i.e., $\\text{PlanPay}(C) = C - \\text{MemberPay}(C)$.\n\nThe cost-sharing mechanism operates in three phases based on the value of $C$:\n1.  For charges up to the deductible ($0 \\le C \\le D$): The member pays all costs.\n    $\\text{MemberPay}(C) = C$.\n2.  For charges above the deductible but before the out-of-pocket maximum is reached: The member pays the full deductible $D$ plus a fraction $\\gamma$ of the charges exceeding $D$.\n    $\\text{MemberPay}(C) = D + \\gamma(C - D)$.\n    This phase ends when the member's total payments reach the out-of-pocket maximum, $M$. We find the charge level, $C_{max}$, at which this occurs by setting $\\text{MemberPay}(C_{max}) = M$:\n    $$M = D + \\gamma(C_{max} - D)$$\n    Solving for $C_{max}$:\n    $$M - D = \\gamma(C_{max} - D)$$\n    $$C_{max} = D + \\frac{M - D}{\\gamma}$$\n    This phase, therefore, applies for $D < C \\le C_{max}$.\n3.  For charges beyond $C_{max}$ ($C > C_{max}$): The member's liability is capped at $M$.\n    $\\text{MemberPay}(C) = M$.\n\nUsing the given plan parameters $D = 1500$, $\\gamma = 0.20$, and $M = 6000$:\n$$C_{max} = 1500 + \\frac{6000 - 1500}{0.20} = 1500 + \\frac{4500}{0.20} = 1500 + 22500 = 24000$$\n\nWith these thresholds, we can now compute the liabilities for the specific case where a member's annual allowed charges are $C = 8000$. Since $1500 < 8000 \\le 24000$, this case falls into the second phase (coinsurance).\n\nThe member's out-of-pocket spending is:\n$$\\text{MemberPay}(8000) = D + \\gamma(8000 - D) = 1500 + 0.20(8000 - 1500) = 1500 + 0.20(6500) = 1500 + 1300 = 2800$$\nThe plan's liability is the remaining amount:\n$$\\text{PlanPay}(8000) = C - \\text{MemberPay}(8000) = 8000 - 2800 = 5200$$\n\nNext, we derive the actuarial value (AV).
