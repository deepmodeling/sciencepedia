Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe system described is a queueing model with memoryless interarrival and service times. This corresponds to a Poisson arrival process and an exponential service time distribution.

Minimizing $C(x)$ is equivalent to maximizing $-C(x)$. The three objectives to be maximized are therefore $E(x) = 4x - x^{2}$, $H(x) = 3x - 2x^{2}$, and $-C(x) = -(2x + x^{2}) = -2x - x^2$.

By the definition of Pareto inefficiency, there must exist another allocation $x' \\in [0,1]$ such that $E(x') \\geq E(x^{\\star})$, $H(x') \\geq H(x^{\\star})$, and $-C(x') \\geq -C(x^{\\star})$, with at least one inequality being strict.

Summing these inequalities yields $W(x') \\geq W(x^{\\star})$. Since at least one of the objective inequalities is strict and its corresponding weight is positive, the sum must be strictly greater: $W(x')  W(x^{\\star})$. This contradicts the initial assumption that $x^{\\star}$ is a maximizer of $W(x)$. Therefore, the unique maximizer of $W(x)$ for strictly positive weights must be Pareto efficient.\n\nNecessary Condition: For any Pareto-efficient solution $x^{\\star}$, there exists a set of non-negative weights $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 \\geq 0$ (not all zero) such that $x^{\\star}$ is a maximizer of $W(x)$. This condition holds if the optimization problem is convex, which requires the objective functions to be concave (as we are maximizing). Let us verify the concavity of our three objectives by examining their second derivatives:\n$E(x) = 4x - x^2 \\implies \\frac{d^2E}{dx^2} = -2  0$. $E(x)$ is strictly concave.\n$H(x) = 3x - 2x^2 \\implies \\frac{d^2H}{dx^2} = -4  0$. $H(x)$ is strictly concave.\n$-C(x) = -2x - x^2 \\implies \\frac{d^2(-C)}{dx^2} = -2  0$. $-C(x)$ is strictly concave.\nSince all objective functions are concave, the set of all achievable objective vectors is a convex set. For such problems, it is a standard theorem that any Pareto-efficient point is a solution to the weighted-sum problem for some non-negative weights.\n\nCombining these conditions, the set of Pareto-efficient solutions is generated by finding the maximizers of $W(x)$ for all $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 \\geq 0$ (not all zero).\n\n(ii) Computation of the Interior Pareto-Efficient Allocation\n\nThe problem asks for an interior maximizer $x^{\\star} \\in (0,1)$.

Therefore, $W''(x)  0$, which confirms that $W(x)$ is a strictly concave function. The unique critical point $x^{\\star}$ is thus the global maximizer.
