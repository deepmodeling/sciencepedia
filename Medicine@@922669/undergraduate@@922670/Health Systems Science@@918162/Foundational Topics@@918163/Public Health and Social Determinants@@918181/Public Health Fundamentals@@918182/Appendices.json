Over a span of $1$ year, there are $50$ newly ascertained cases among a population initially at risk of $10{,}000$.

Round each of the three requested quantities to four significant figures. Provide your three results in the order listed.", "solution": "The problem will first be validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and conditions are provided in the problem statement:\n- Time span of observation: $1$ year\n- Number of newly ascertained cases: $I = 50$\n- Population initially at risk: $N_0 = 10,000$\n- Total accrued observation time: $PT = 5,000$ person-years\n- Average duration of the condition: $D = 4$ years\n- Conditions:\n    - Stable urban population\n    - Non-communicable condition\n    - Steady-state (constant incidence rate and average duration)\n    - Rare condition in the population\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental, standard definitions in epidemiology and public health, including incidence rate (incidence density), cumulative incidence (risk), and prevalence. The relationship between these quantities under steady-state and rare disease assumptions is a core concept in the field. All concepts are factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical values and explicit conditions required to calculate the three requested quantities. The question is unambiguous and has a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with objective, quantitative language and avoids any subjective or speculative claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided data are consistent. For example, a total observation time of $5,000$ person-years for an initial population of $10,000$ over $1$ year is plausible, as it implies an average follow-up time of $0.5$ years per person, which can be accounted for by staggered entry, loss to follow-up, or the occurrence of the event of interest (diagnosis), after which the person is no longer \"at risk\".\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe three requested quantities—incidence rate, $1$-year cumulative incidence, and point prevalence—will be computed in order, based on their standard definitions in public health.\n\n**1. Incidence Rate ($IR$)**\n\nThe incidence rate, also known as incidence density, measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population over a specified period, relative to the total time the population was observed and at risk. Its formula is:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the number of new cases, $I = 50$, and the total person-time at risk, $PT = 5,000$ person-years.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{50}{5,000} \\text{ years}^{-1} = 0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requests this value in cases per person-year, which is equivalent to units of inverse time (e.g., years$^{-1}$). Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nIR = 0.01000 \\text{ cases per person-year}\n$$\n\n**2. $1$-Year Cumulative Incidence ($CI$)**\n\nCumulative incidence, also known as risk, is the proportion of a population initially at risk that develops the condition over a specified time interval. It is calculated for a fixed cohort. The formula is:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during the period}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the number of new cases over the $1$-year period, $I = 50$, and the size of the population initially at risk, $N_0 = 10,000$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{50}{10,000} = 0.005\n$$\nThis quantity is a unitless proportion. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nCI = 0.005000\n$$\n\n**3. Point Prevalence ($P$)**\n\nPrevalence is the proportion of a population that has a condition at a specific point in time. The problem states that steady-state conditions apply, the incidence rate is constant, and the condition is rare. Under these specific assumptions, a fundamental relationship exists between prevalence ($P$), incidence rate ($IR$), and the average duration of the disease ($D$):\n$$\nP \\approx IR \\times D\n$$\nThis approximation holds because, in a steady state, the rate at which new cases are added to the prevalent pool must equal the rate at which they are removed (due to recovery or death). The rate of new cases is $IR \\times N_{\\text{total}}$, and the rate of removal is $\\frac{\\text{Number of prevalent cases}}{D} = \\frac{P \\times N_{\\text{total}}}{D}$. Equating these gives $IR \\approx \\frac{P}{D}$.\n\nUsing the incidence rate calculated previously ($IR = 0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}$) and the given average duration of the disease ($D = 4$ years):\n$$\nP \\approx (0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}) \\times (4 \\text{ years}) = 0.04\n$$\nPrevalence is a unitless proportion. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nP = 0.04000\n$$\n\nThe three computed quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Incidence rate: $0.01000$\n- $1$-year cumulative incidence: $0.005000$\n- Point prevalence: $0.04000$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01000 & 0.005000 & 0.04000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4393149"}, {"introduction": "A diagnostic test's accuracy is often described by its sensitivity and specificity, but these values don't tell the whole story of its performance in the real world.

This is the complement of sensitivity.\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nThe probability of a false positive is the conditional probability that the test is positive, given that the individual does not have the disease. This is the complement of specificity.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\n**1. Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is defined as the conditional probability that an individual has the disease, given that the test result is positive. This is expressed as $P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can write:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the law of total probability. The event $T^+$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: a true positive ($T^+$ and $D$) and a false positive ($T^+$ and $D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we have:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV, we derive the general expression for PPV in terms of prevalence (prev), sensitivity (sens), and specificity (spec):\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} = \\frac{\\text{sens} \\times \\text{prev}}{(\\text{sens} \\times \\text{prev}) + ((1 - \\text{spec}) \\times (1 - \\text{prev}))}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.02}{(0.90 \\times 0.02) + (0.05 \\times 0.98)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.2686567...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.2687$.\n\n**2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is defined as the conditional probability that an individual does not have the disease, given that the test result is negative. This is expressed as $P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we again use the law of total probability. The event $T^-$ can be partitioned into a true negative ($T^-$ and $D^c$) and a false negative ($T^-$ and $D$).\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem formula for NPV, we derive the general expression for NPV:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)} = \\frac{\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev})}{(\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev})) + ((1 - \\text{sens}) \\times \\text{prev})}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.98}{(0.95 \\times 0.98) + (0.10 \\times 0.02)} = \\frac{0.931}{0.931 + 0.002} = \\frac{0.931}{0.933}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9978563...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9979$.\n\n**3. Dependence of PPV and NPV on Assay and Population Characteristics**\n\nThe derived expressions allow for an analysis of how PPV and NPV change with prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\n**Dependence of PPV:** $PPV = \\frac{\\text{sens} \\times \\text{prev}}{(\\text{sens} \\times \\text{prev}) + ((1 - \\text{spec}) \\times (1 - \\text{prev}))}$\n- **Prevalence:** PPV is strongly dependent on and increases with prevalence. For a given test, a positive result is much more likely to be a true positive in a high-prevalence population (e.g., symptomatic individuals) than in a low-prevalence population (e.g., general screening). Mathematically, as prevalence $(\\text{prev})$ increases, the numerator increases and the denominator's second term, $(1 - \\text{spec})(1 - \\text{prev})$, decreases, both of which cause PPV to increase.\n- **Sensitivity:** PPV increases with sensitivity. A higher sensitivity means fewer false negatives, which does not directly enter the PPV formula, but a more sensitive test increases the number of true positives $(\\text{sens} \\times \\text{prev})$ relative to the total number of positives, thus increasing the PPV.\n- **Specificity:** PPV increases with specificity. A higher specificity reduces the number of false positives $((1 - \\text{spec}) \\times (1 - \\text{prev}))$. This decreases the denominator of the PPV expression, thereby increasing the value of the PPV.\n\n**Dependence of NPV:** $NPV = \\frac{\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev})}{(\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev})) + ((1 - \\text{sens}) \\times \\text{prev})}$\n- **Prevalence:** NPV decreases as prevalence increases. In a population with higher prevalence, there is a greater a priori chance of having the disease, which makes a negative test result less certain to be a true negative. Mathematically, as prevalence $(\\text{prev})$ increases, the numerator $(\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev}))$ decreases, while the false negative term in the denominator $((1 - \\text{sens}) \\times \\text{prev})$ increases, both of which cause NPV to decrease.\n- **Sensitivity:** NPV increases with sensitivity. Higher sensitivity reduces the number of false negatives $((1 - \\text{sens}) \\times \\text{prev})$. This decreases the denominator of the NPV expression, thereby increasing the value of the NPV.\n- **Specificity:** NPV increases with specificity. A higher specificity increases the number of true negatives $(\\text{spec} \\times (1 - \\text{prev}))$. This increases the numerator of the NPV expression more than it increases the denominator, leading to an overall increase in NPV.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2687 & 0.9979 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4393129"}, {"introduction": "Effectively communicating the benefits of a health intervention is a core skill in both clinical practice and public health.

Using the provided definition, we rearrange the formula $RRR = 1 - RR$ to solve for $RR$:\n$$RR = 1 - RRR$$\nSubstituting the given value of $RRR$:\n$$RR = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$$\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk under treatment, $R_t$.
