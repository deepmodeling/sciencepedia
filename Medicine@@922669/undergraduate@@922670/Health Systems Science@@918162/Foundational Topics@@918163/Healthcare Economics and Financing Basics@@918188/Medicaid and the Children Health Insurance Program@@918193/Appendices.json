The parents are unmarried and live together with three children. Parent A has annual wage income of $49,200, and Parent B has annual net self-employment income of $7,300. The parents will each file taxes as single and do not file a joint return. Parent A expects to claim all three children as tax dependents. The children are ages $0.8$ years (ten months), $4$, and $15$. The $15$-year-old has seasonal earned income of $3,000$; the other two children have $0$ income. None of the children are required to file a federal tax return based on their income levels. There are no other income sources, and no members are eligible for non-MAGI categories.\n\nUse the following well-established rules and facts as the fundamental base:\n- Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) household composition for Medicaid is determined by federal regulation. For an individual who is expected to be claimed as a tax dependent and who lives with both parents who do not expect to file a joint tax return, the non-filer household rules are used for that individual. Under non-filer rules, a child's household includes the child, the child's parents living in the home, and the child's siblings under age $19$ living in the home.\n- Under MAGI, a household's countable income for a child's eligibility includes the income of members in the child's household who are required to file taxes, plus the child's own income if the child is required to file. Income of household members not required to file is not counted.\n- A standard MAGI income disregard equal to $5\\%$ of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for the applicable household size is applied to the individual's income when determining eligibility for MAGI-based categories.\n- For $2024$, the annual Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for a household size of $5$ in the continental United States is $36,580.\n- In State Theta, the Medicaid income standards for children are: ages $0$ to $1$ year, up to $2.00$ times FPL; ages $1$ through $5$, up to $1.70$ times FPL; ages $6$ through $18$, up to $1.38$ times FPL. Children with income above the Medicaid limit but at or below $2.55$ times FPL are eligible for CHIP.\n\nUsing only the information above and MAGI methodology with the $5\\%$ FPL disregard, determine the number of the three children who are eligible for Medicaid (not CHIP). Provide your final answer as a single integer. Do not use a percent sign; no rounding is required for the final answer.", "solution": "The task is to determine the number of children in a family of five who are eligible for Medicaid by applying Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) rules. The solution involves determining household composition, calculating countable income, applying the income disregard, and comparing the final income to age-specific eligibility thresholds.\n\nFirst, we determine the MAGI household composition for the children. The problem states that for a tax dependent living with both parents who do not file a joint return, the non-filer household rules apply. This rule states: \"a child's household includes the child, the child's parents living in the home, and the child's siblings under age $19$ living in the home.\"\nIn this family, all three children (ages $0.8$, $4$, and $15$) are under age $19$ and live with both parents. Therefore, the household for each child is identical and consists of the child, both parents, and the two other siblings.\nThe household size, $N$, is $1$ (child) $+ 2$ (parents) $+ 2$ (siblings) $= 5$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the household's total countable income. The rule is to include the income of household members required to file taxes.\n- Parent A's income of $\\$49,200$ is above the filing threshold.\n- Parent B's self-employment income of $\\$7,300$ is above the $\\$400$ threshold for self-employment, so they must file.\n- The children are not required to file, so their income is not counted.\nThe total countable household income, $I_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the parents' incomes:\n$$I_{\\text{total}} = 49,200 + 7,300 = 56,500$$\nThe household's total countable income is $\\$56,500$.\n\nThird, we apply the $5\\%$ MAGI income disregard. The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for a household of size $5$ is given as $\\$36,580$.\nThe disregard amount, $D$, is:\n$$D = 0.05 \\times 36,580 = 1,829$$\nThis disregard is subtracted from the total countable income to find the final income for the eligibility test, $I_{\\text{MAGI}}$.\n$$I_{\\text{MAGI}} = 56,500 - 1,829 = 54,671$$\nThe final income for comparison is $\\$54,671$.\n\nFourth, we evaluate each child's eligibility by comparing $I_{\\text{MAGI}}$ to their age-specific Medicaid income limit.\n\n- Child 1 (age $0.8$ years):\nThe limit for children aged $0$ to $1$ year is $2.00 \\times \\text{FPL}$.\n$$ \\text{Limit}_1 = 2.00 \\times 36,580 = 73,160 $$\nSince $\\$54,671 \\le \\$73,160$, Child 1 is eligible for Medicaid.\n\n- Child 2 (age $4$ years):\nThe limit for children aged $1$ through $5$ years is $1.70 \\times \\text{FPL}$.\n$$ \\text{Limit}_2 = 1.70 \\times 36,580 = 62,186 $$\nSince $\\$54,671 \\le \\$62,186$, Child 2 is eligible for Medicaid.\n\n- Child 3 (age $15$ years):\nThe limit for children aged $6$ through $18$ years is $1.38 \\times \\text{FPL}$.\n$$ \\text{Limit}_3 = 1.38 \\times 36,580 = 50,480.40 $$\nSince $\\$54,671 > \\$50,480.40$, Child 3 is not eligible for Medicaid.\n\nCounting the number of children eligible for Medicaid, we have Child 1 and Child 2.

Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is a bounded matching rate defined by statute as a function of the ratio of State Per Capita Income (SPI) to United States Per Capita Income (USPI). In this framework, the federal share declines as the state becomes wealthier relative to the nation, with a statutory lower bound of $0.50$ and an upper bound of $0.83$. A well-tested calibration fact is that at parity income, where $SPI = USPI$, the federal share equals $0.55$. The statutory construction bases the dependence on the square of the income ratio.
