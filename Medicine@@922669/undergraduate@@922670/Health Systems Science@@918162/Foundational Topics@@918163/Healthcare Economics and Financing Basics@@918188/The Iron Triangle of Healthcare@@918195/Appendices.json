All necessary data and definitions are provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and decomposition of total healthcare spending, defined by the identity $S = P \\times Q$, where $S$ is total spending, $P$ is the average price per case, and $Q$ is the volume of cases.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline and post-policy values for price and quantity.\n\nThe baseline values are given as:\n- Average price per case, $P_{0} = 5000$.\n- Case volume, $Q_{0} = 10000$.\n\nThe problem states that after a policy implementation, the average price rises by $10\\%$ and the number of cases rises by $5\\%$. We can calculate the new price, $P_{1}$, and new quantity, $Q_{1}$, as follows:\n$$P_{1} = P_{0} \\times (1 + \\frac{10}{100}) = P_{0} \\times 1.10 = 5000 \\times 1.10 = 5500$$\n$$Q_{1} = Q_{0} \\times (1 + \\frac{5}{100}) = Q_{0} \\times 1.05 = 10000 \\times 1.05 = 10500$$\n\nNow, we can address the three parts of the problem.\n\n1.

Compute the post-policy total spending, $S_{1}$.\nUsing the calculated post-policy values:\n$$S_{1} = P_{1} \\times Q_{1} = 5500 \\times 10500 = 57{,}750{,}000$$\n\n3.  Decompose the total spending change, $\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0}$, into components attributable to price and quantity changes.\nThe total change in spending is:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0} = 57{,}750{,}000 - 50{,}000{,}000 = 7{,}750{,}000$$\n\nThe problem specifies a particular decomposition method. The change is to be separated into two components:\n- The component due to the change in price, holding quantity fixed at the baseline level ($Q_{0}$).

Health systems constantly evaluate whether new, often more expensive, interventions are \"worth it.\" This practice introduces the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), a core metric for relating the additional cost of an intervention to the additional health benefits it provides, and also prompts consideration of how access barriers can impact a program's overall success [@problem_id:4399721].", "problem": "A regional health system is evaluating a new preventive screening program compared with current practice. Relative to the current practice, the program’s average incremental cost per participant is $\\Delta C = 2000$ and its average incremental health benefit per participant is $\\Delta QALY = 0.1$, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY). Starting from core definitions used in health technology assessment, compute the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Express the final ICER in United States dollars per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (USD/QALY). Provide the exact value; no rounding is required. Then, using the iron triangle of healthcare (cost, access, quality) as the conceptual base, explain how an upfront participant charge could deter participation and thereby influence access, even if the computed cost-effectiveness is favorable.", "solution": "The iron triangle of healthcare articulates that cost, access, and quality are interdependent; improving one dimension often imposes trade-offs on the others. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) provides a summary of how much additional cost is incurred per additional unit of health benefit gained when moving from a comparator to an intervention. The core definition in health technology assessment is that the ICER measures dollars per health unit gained, which must be constructed from the incremental quantities available: incremental cost and incremental health gain.\n\nLet $\\Delta C$ denote the incremental cost of the intervention relative to current practice and $\\Delta E$ denote the incremental effectiveness. In this context, effectiveness is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY), so $\\Delta E = \\Delta QALY$. The objective is to obtain a quantity with units of dollars per QALY. Dimensional analysis guides the construction of such a measure: dividing dollars by QALY yields dollars per QALY, which is the desired unit of cost-effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, starting from the definition of average incremental cost per unit of health gained, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is given by\n$$\nICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta QALY}.\n$$\nSubstituting the provided incremental quantities,\n$$\nICER = \\frac{2000}{0.1}.\n$$\nCarrying out the division,\n$$\nICER = 20000.\n$$\nInterpreted in units, this means the program requires $20,000$ United States dollars per one QALY gained, on average, relative to current practice.\n\nConceptual implications for access under the iron triangle: Even if an ICER of $20,000$ per QALY is considered favorable by prevailing willingness-to-pay thresholds, introducing or maintaining an upfront participant charge (for example, a copayment or deductible) can reduce access by deterring participation, particularly among individuals with liquidity constraints or lower incomes. The ICER is a marginal, per-participant efficiency metric; it does not directly capture uptake. If upfront costs reduce the proportion of eligible individuals who enroll, the population-level health gains (aggregate QALYs) will be lower, and the distribution of benefits will skew toward those less sensitive to price, potentially exacerbating inequities. Thus, policies that lower cost at the point of service (e.g., reducing copayments) can increase access, but may raise system-level expenditures, illustrating the iron triangle trade-off: decreasing patient-facing costs to increase access may require higher payer expenditures, while cost-sharing designed to contain spending may decrease access and thereby diminish realized quality at the population level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20000}$$", "id": "4399721"}, {"introduction": "The abstract principles of the Iron Triangle come to life in the daily operational decisions of healthcare facilities. A classic example is managing hospital bed occupancy, which involves a direct conflict between financial efficiency and quality of care. This final exercise challenges you to model this trade-off, using marginal analysis to find an optimal occupancy level that balances the cost of idle capacity against the quality and access risks of hospital congestion [@problem_id:4399649].", "problem": "A regional acute-care hospital is attempting to set a target bed occupancy to balance the three aims of the iron triangle of healthcare (cost, access, quality). The hospital’s leadership accepts two widely observed, foundational facts: (1) as utilization approaches full capacity, average waiting time for service in queuing systems rises nonlinearly, which increases risks of delayed treatment and care errors; and (2) unoccupied staffed beds carry an opportunity cost due to staffing, fixed overhead, and unsold capacity. They want to formalize this trade-off using marginal analysis grounded in these facts.\n\nLet the occupancy proportion be $o \\in [0,1)$, defined as the ratio of average census to staffed bed capacity. Define the expected daily monetized quality harm from congestion and delay as $H(o)$ and the expected daily cost of idle capacity as $I(o)$. To capture the nonlinearity of delay risk as capacity saturates, the hospital adopts the functional form\n$H(o) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1\\right)$,\nwhich is zero at $o=0$ and rises rapidly as $o \\to 1$. To represent the cost of idle staffed beds, they adopt\n$I(o) = \\beta(1-o)$.\n\nThese specifications are anchored to measurable quantities for a hospital with $400$ staffed beds:\n- The expected cost of an unoccupied staffed bed-day is estimated at United States dollars (USD) $2{,}500$. Hence, when $1-o=1$ (all beds idle), the total daily idle capacity cost would be $\\beta = 400 \\times 2{,}500 = \\text{USD } 1{,}000{,}000$.\n- Based on observed associations between delayed care, healthcare-associated infections, and adverse outcomes, the organization’s monetization of expected quality harm yields $\\alpha = \\text{USD } 22{,}500$.\n\nAssume the hospital’s objective is to minimize the daily total expected social loss $L(o) = H(o) + I(o)$ over $o \\in [0,1)$.

Set a target of $90\\%$ occupancy, because fixed costs are high and the harm from congestion rises roughly linearly; therefore, running closer to full maximizes efficiency without major quality compromise.\n\nD. Set a target of $95\\%$ occupancy, because maximizing access takes priority and any added delay or infection risk at very high occupancy is modest compared with the savings from minimizing idle capacity.", "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The occupancy proportion is denoted by $o \\in [0,1)$.\n- The expected daily monetized quality harm is $H(o) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1\\right)$.\n- The expected daily cost of idle capacity is $I(o) = \\beta(1-o)$.\n- The hospital's objective is to minimize the total daily expected social loss, $L(o) = H(o) + I(o)$.\n- The hospital has a capacity of $400$ staffed beds.\n- The cost of an unoccupied staffed bed-day is United States dollars (USD) $2{,}500$.\n- The parameter $\\beta$ is the total daily idle capacity cost when all beds are idle ($o=0$, so $1-o=1$), which is calculated as $\\beta = 400 \\times 2{,}500 = \\text{USD } 1{,}000{,}000$.\n- The parameter $\\alpha$ for monetized quality harm is given as $\\alpha = \\text{USD } 22{,}500$.\n- The task is to find the optimal target occupancy $o$ that minimizes $L(o)$ and select the statement that correctly provides this value and its justification.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is grounded in the principles of queuing theory and operations management, which are standard analytical tools in health systems engineering. The functional form for harm, $H(o)$, is analogous to the behavior of waiting times in queuing systems (e.g., M/M/1 queues) where delays increase nonlinearly and diverge as utilization approaches capacity. The cost function for idle capacity, $I(o)$, is a reasonable linear approximation. The concept of an \"iron triangle\" and balancing competing objectives is central to health systems science. The model is a valid, simplified representation of a real-world trade-off.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clearly defined objective function, $L(o)$, to be minimized over a specified interval, $o \\in [0,1)$. The function is continuous and twice-differentiable on this interval. The second derivative will be shown to be positive, indicating a convex function, which ensures a unique minimum exists. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, mathematical terms. All parameters are explicitly defined and quantified. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims in the problem setup.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary parameters ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) and functional forms are provided. The values are internally consistent. The calculation of $\\beta$ is shown and correct. The problem is self-contained.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as being unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. The values are within a plausible range for hospital economics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Optimal Occupancy\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total social loss function $L(o)$ with respect to the occupancy proportion $o$:\n$$L(o) = H(o) + I(o) = \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1\\right) + \\beta(1-o)$$\n\nTo find the minimum, we must apply marginal optimization logic. This involves taking the first derivative of $L(o)$ with respect to $o$ and setting it to zero. This first-order condition identifies candidate points for an extremum.\n\nFirst, we calculate the derivative of $L(o)$:\n$$\\frac{dL}{do} = \\frac{d}{do} \\left[ \\alpha\\left((1-o)^{-1} - 1\\right) + \\beta(1-o) \\right]$$\nWe differentiate term by term:\n$$\\frac{d}{do} \\left[ \\alpha\\left((1-o)^{-1} - 1\\right) \\right] = \\alpha \\left[ (-1)(1-o)^{-2} \\cdot (-1) - 0 \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2}$$\nThis term, $\\frac{dH}{do}$, represents the marginal harm of congestion.\n$$\\frac{d}{do} \\left[ \\beta(1-o) \\right] = \\beta(-1) = -\\beta$$\nThis term, $\\frac{dI}{do}$, represents the marginal change in idle cost as occupancy increases. A negative value indicates that the cost of idle capacity decreases as occupancy increases. The marginal benefit (or cost saving) of increasing occupancy is $-\\frac{dI}{do} = \\beta$.\n\nThe first-order condition for an optimum is $\\frac{dL}{do} = 0$:\n$$\\frac{dL}{do} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} - \\beta = 0$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} = \\beta$$\nThis equation has a clear interpretation: the optimal occupancy is reached when the marginal harm from increasing occupancy equals the marginal cost saving from increasing occupancy (which is equivalent to the marginal cost of an idle bed).\n\nNow, we solve for the optimal occupancy, $o_{opt}$:\n$$(1-o_{opt})^2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\n$$1-o_{opt} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$\nWe take the positive square root because occupancy $o$ must be less than $1$, so $1-o$ must be positive.\n$$o_{opt} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$\n\nSubstitute the given numerical values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$\\alpha = 22{,}500$\n$\\beta = 1{,}000{,}000$\n$$o_{opt} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{22{,}500}{1{,}000{,}000}} = 1 - \\sqrt{0.0225}$$\nThe square root of $0.0225$ is $0.15$.\n$$o_{opt} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$$\nThe optimal occupancy is $0.85$, or $85\\%$.\n\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2L}{do^2} = \\frac{d}{do} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-o)^2} - \\beta \\right) = \\alpha \\cdot (-2)(1-o)^{-3} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{(1-o)^3}$$\nSince $\\alpha = 22{,}500 > 0$ and $o \\in [0,1)$, the term $(1-o)^3$ is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2L}{do^2} > 0$ for all valid $o$, which confirms that the function $L(o)$ is convex and our solution $o_{opt} = 0.85$ is a unique global minimum.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on this result.\n\n**A. Set a target of $80\\%$ occupancy, because congestion effects begin at moderate utilization; at this point the marginal harm of delay and infection already equals the marginal cost of idle capacity.**\n\n- The proposed target occupancy is $80\\%$. Our calculated optimum is $85\\%$. The numerical value is incorrect.\n- The justification states that at $80\\%$ occupancy, the marginal harm equals the marginal cost of idle capacity. This is the optimality condition, which we found to be met at $85\\%$, not $80\\%$. At $o=0.80$, the marginal harm is $\\frac{dH}{do} = \\frac{22{,}500}{(1-0.80)^2} = \\frac{22{,}500}{0.04} = 562{,}500$, while the marginal benefit (cost saving) is $\\beta = 1{,}000{,}000$. Since the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal harm, it is advantageous to increase occupancy further.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Set a target of $85\\%$ occupancy, because the optimal interior solution occurs where the marginal congestion harm equals the marginal cost of idle capacity; at this occupancy, nonlinear delay and infection risk are meaningfully contained without excessive idle bed cost.**\n\n- The proposed target occupancy is $85\\%$. This matches our calculated optimum, $o_{opt} = 0.85$.\n- The justification states that the optimum occurs where \"marginal congestion harm equals the marginal cost of idle capacity.\" This is an accurate informal statement of the optimality condition $\\frac{dH}{do} = \\beta$. The phrase \"marginal cost of idle capacity\" correctly refers to $\\beta$, the cost per unit of idle capacity. The concluding phrase is a good qualitative description of the outcome of this optimization.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Set a target of $90\\%$ occupancy, because fixed costs are high and the harm from congestion rises roughly linearly; therefore, running closer to full maximizes efficiency without major quality compromise.**\n\n- The proposed target occupancy is $90\\%$. Our calculated optimum is $85\\%$. The numerical value is incorrect.\n- The justification claims that \"the harm from congestion rises roughly linearly.\" This is a direct contradiction of both the explicit problem statement (\"rises nonlinearly\") and the given functional form $H(o) = \\alpha(\\frac{1}{1-o} - 1)$, which is highly nonlinear, especially as $o$ approaches $1$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Set a target of $95\\%$ occupancy, because maximizing access takes priority and any added delay or infection risk at very high occupancy is modest compared with the savings from minimizing idle capacity.**\n\n- The proposed target occupancy is $95\\%$. Our calculated optimum is $85\\%$. The numerical value is incorrect.\n- The justification claims that at very high occupancy, the added risk is \"modest.\" Let's check this at $o=0.95$. The marginal harm is $\\frac{dH}{do} = \\frac{22{,}500}{(1-0.95)^2} = \\frac{22{,}500}{0.0025} = 9{,}000{,}000$. This is nine times larger than the marginal saving of $\\beta=1{,}000{,}000$. The claim that the risk is \"modest\" compared to the savings is quantitatively false. It is immense. Furthermore, the problem is to minimize total social loss as defined, not to prioritize one component (access) over others.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4399649"}]}
