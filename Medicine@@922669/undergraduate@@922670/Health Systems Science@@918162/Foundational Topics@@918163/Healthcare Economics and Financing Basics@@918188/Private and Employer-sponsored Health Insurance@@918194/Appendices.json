Under these provisions, an offer is considered affordable if the employee’s required monthly contribution for the lowest-cost self-only plan does not exceed a specified affordability parameter times a proxy for household income. Employers are permitted to use three distinct affordability safe harbors: the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 (W-2) wages safe harbor, the rate of pay safe harbor, and the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) safe harbor.\n\nUse the following well-tested facts and definitions as the fundamental base:\n- The Affordable Care Act (ACA) affordability test compares the employee’s required monthly contribution for self-only coverage to a threshold defined as the product of an affordability parameter and a proxy for annual income, standardized to a monthly basis.\n- The affordability parameter for the plan year is given as $\\alpha = 0.0912$.\n- For the W-2 wages safe harbor, the proxy is the employee’s annual W-2 Box $1$ wages, denoted $W$, converted to a monthly basis by dividing by $12$.\n- For the rate of pay safe harbor, the proxy is the monthly earnings computed as the hourly rate multiplied by $130$ hours, consistent with the widely used full-time monthly hours standard derived from $30$ hours per week.\n- For the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) safe harbor, the proxy is the annual FPL for a one-person household, denoted $F$, converted to a monthly basis by dividing by $12$.\n\nArborCare LLC provides the following data for plan year $2024$:\n- Annual W-2 wages for the employee: $W = 28{,}900$ United States dollars.\n- Hourly rate of pay at the start of the coverage period: $r = 17.00$ United States dollars per hour.\n- Annual Federal Poverty Line for a one-person household (Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines): $F = 15{,}060$ United States dollars.\n\nStarting exclusively from the above definitions, derive the maximum affordable monthly employee premium contribution for self-only coverage under each of the three safe harbors, and then determine the single most restrictive maximum (i.e., the minimum of the three).

The final objective is to identify the single most restrictive (i.e., lowest) of these three maximums.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that an offer of coverage is deemed affordable if the employee's required monthly contribution, let's denote it as $C$, does not exceed a specified threshold. This threshold is calculated as the product of a given affordability parameter, $\\alpha$, and a proxy for the employee's monthly household income. The maximum affordable contribution, $C_{max}$, is thus defined as:\n$$C_{max} = \\alpha \\times (\\text{monthly income proxy})$$\nThe problem provides the affordability parameter for the plan year as $\\alpha = 0.0912$. We will now calculate $C_{max}$ for each of the three safe harbors using the provided data.\n\n1.  **Form W-2 Wages Safe Harbor**\n    Under this safe harbor, the income proxy is the employee’s annual W-2 Box $1$ wages, denoted by $W$, converted to a monthly basis.

The monthly income proxy is $r \\times 130$.\n    The maximum affordable monthly contribution, $C_{ROP}$, is given by:\n    $$C_{ROP} = \\alpha \\times (r \\times 130)$$\n    The problem provides the hourly rate of pay as $r = 17.00$ United States dollars per hour.
