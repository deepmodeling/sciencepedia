The problem states that the service exhibits a constant uncompensated price elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon$, equal to $-0.2$. The price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the infinitesimal percentage change in quantity demanded, $Q$, to the infinitesimal percentage change in price, $P$.
