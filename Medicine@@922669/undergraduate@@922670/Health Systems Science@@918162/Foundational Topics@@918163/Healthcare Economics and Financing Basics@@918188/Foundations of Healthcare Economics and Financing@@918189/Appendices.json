The system sets a uniform cash price $P$ for the test. Market demand for the test is linear and given in direct form by $Q = A - B P$, with parameters satisfying $A > 0$ and $B > 0$. The hospital’s technology yields constant marginal cost (MC) equal to $c$, with $0  c  \\frac{A}{B}$, and zero fixed cost (i.e., fixed cost equals $0$). Assume the hospital’s objective is to maximize economic profit.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of total revenue $R$, total cost $C$, and profit $\\pi$ (that is, $R = P \\times Q$, $C = c \\times Q$, and $\\pi = R - C$), and using only logically necessary steps that follow from these definitions and standard differentiability assumptions:\n\n1) Derive the monopoly price $P^{*}$ and the corresponding monopoly quantity $Q^{*}$ as explicit functions of $A$, $B$, and $c$.\n\n2) Using your expressions, determine how $P^{*}$ varies with $c$ and $B$ while holding $A$ fixed.

The core definitions are provided:\nTotal Revenue: $R = P \\times Q$\nTotal Cost: $C = c \\times Q$ (since fixed cost is zero)\nProfit: $\\pi = R - C$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for $R$ and $C$ into the profit function gives:\n$$ \\pi = (P \\times Q) - (c \\times Q) = (P - c) Q $$\nThis profit function depends on two variables, the price $P$ and the quantity $Q$. To perform the optimization, we must express profit as a function of a single variable. The market demand function, $Q = A - B P$, provides the necessary relationship. We substitute the expression for $Q$ into the profit function to express profit as a function of price, $\\pi(P)$:\n$$ \\pi(P) = (P - c)(A - B P) $$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$ \\pi(P) = A P - B P^2 - A c + B c P $$\nTo facilitate differentiation, we group the terms by powers of $P$:\n$$ \\pi(P) = -B P^2 + (A + B c) P - A c $$\nThis is a quadratic function of $P$. Given the constraint $B > 0$, the coefficient of the $P^2$ term is negative ($-B  0$), which means the graph of $\\pi(P)$ is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum profit is located at the vertex of this parabola.\n\n1) To find the profit-maximizing price, $P^{*}$, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to $P$ and set it to zero. This is the first-order condition for a maximum.\n$$ \\frac{d\\pi}{dP} = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( -B P^2 + (A + B c) P - A c \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ -2 B P + (A + B c) = 0 $$\nSolving for $P$ gives the optimal monopoly price, $P^{*}$:\n$$ 2 B P = A + B c $$\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A + B c}{2 B} $$\nThis expression can also be written as $P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2}$. The problem statement provides the condition $c  \\frac{A}{B}$, which ensures that $P^{*} > c$, a necessary condition for profitable operation.\n\nTo find the corresponding monopoly quantity, $Q^{*}$, we substitute the optimal price $P^{*}$ back into the demand equation $Q = A - B P$:\n$$ Q^{*} = A - B \\left( P^{*} \\right) = A - B \\left( \\frac{A + B c}{2 B} \\right) $$\n$$ Q^{*} = A - \\frac{A + B c}{2} $$\n$$ Q^{*} = \\frac{2A - (A + B c)}{2} = \\frac{2A - A - B c}{2} $$\n$$ Q^{*} = \\frac{A - B c}{2} $$\nThe condition $c  \\frac{A}{B}$ is equivalent to $A > B c$, which ensures that the optimal quantity $Q^{*}$ is positive.\n\n2) Now we determine how the optimal price $P^{*}$ varies with the marginal cost $c$ and the demand parameter $B$. This requires calculating the partial derivatives of $P^{*}$ with respect to $c$ and $B$.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $P^{*}$ with respect to $c$, holding $A$ and $B$ constant:\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left( \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} \\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe sign of $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial c}$ is positive.\nEconomic Interpretation: An increase in the marginal cost of providing the test leads the monopolist to increase its price. Specifically, the hospital passes on exactly half of any marginal cost increase to its patients in the form of a higher price.\n\nSecond, we find the partial derivative of $P^{*}$ with respect to $B$, holding $A$ and $c$ constant:\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{A}{2B} + \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{A}{2} B^{-1} + \\frac{c}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial B} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} \\left( \\frac{A}{2} B^{-1} + \\frac{c}{2} \\right) = \\frac{A}{2} (-1) B^{-2} + 0 = -\\frac{A}{2B^2} $$\nGiven that $A > 0$ and $B > 0$ from the problem statement, both $A$ and $2B^2$ are positive quantities. Therefore, the sign of $\\frac{\\partial P^{*}}{\\partial B}$ is negative.\nEconomic Interpretation: The parameter $B$ measures the price sensitivity of demand. A larger value of $B$ means consumers are more responsive to price changes. If demand becomes more price-sensitive (i.e., $B$ increases), the hospital system will lower its price to retain customers and maximize profit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{A + Bc}{2B}  \\frac{A - Bc}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4371487"}, {"introduction": "While some markets are dominated by single providers, others are more competitive, where the principles of supply and demand are key to understanding policy effects.

Pre-tax Competitive Equilibrium**\n\nIn a competitive market without taxation, the equilibrium price $P^{*}$ and quantity $Q^{*}$ are found where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, $Q_{D}(P) = Q_{S}(P)$.\n\n$$40{,}000 - 200P = 10{,}000 + 100P$$\n\nTo solve for the equilibrium price $P^{*}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$40{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 200P + 100P$$\n$$30{,}000 = 300P$$\n$$P^{*} = \\frac{30{,}000}{300} = 100$$\n\nThe pre-tax equilibrium price is $P^{*} = \\$100$. Now, we find the equilibrium quantity $Q^{*}$ by substituting $P^{*}$ into either the demand or supply function. Using the demand function:\n$$Q^{*} = Q_{D}(P^{*}) = 40{,}000 - 200(100) = 40{,}000 - 20{,}000 = 20{,}000$$\nUsing the supply function as a check:\n$$Q^{*} = Q_{S}(P^{*}) = 10{,}000 + 100(100) = 10{,}000 + 10{,}000 = 20{,}000$$\nThe results are consistent. The pre-tax competitive equilibrium is at a price of $P^{*} = 100$ and a quantity of $Q^{*} = 20{,}000$ sessions.\n\n**2. Point Price Elasticities at Equilibrium**\n\nWe use the provided definitions for elasticity. First, we find the derivatives of the demand and supply functions with respect to price $P$.\nFor the demand function $Q_{D}(P) = 40{,}000 - 200P$:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP} = -200$$\nFor the supply function $Q_{S}(P) = 10{,}000 + 100P$:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP} = 100$$\nThese derivatives are constant because the functions are linear. Now, we calculate the point elasticities at the equilibrium point $(P^{*}, Q^{*}) = (100, 20{,}000)$.\n\nThe price elasticity of demand $\\epsilon_{D}$ is:\n$$\\epsilon_{D} = \\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P^{*}}{Q^{*}} = -200 \\cdot \\frac{100}{20{,}000} = -200 \\cdot \\frac{1}{200} = -1$$\n\nThe price elasticity of supply $\\epsilon_{S}$ is:\n$$\\epsilon_{S} = \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P^{*}}{Q^{*}} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{100}{20{,}000} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo, at the equilibrium point, the price elasticity of demand is $\\epsilon_{D} = -1$ and the price elasticity of supply is $\\epsilon_{S} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**3. Tax Incidence and Consumer Share**\n\nA per-unit tax $t$ is levied on providers. This creates a wedge between the price consumers pay, $P_{c}$, and the price producers receive, $P_{p}$, such that $P_{p} = P_{c} - t$. The new market equilibrium is established where the quantity demanded at price $P_{c}$ equals the quantity supplied at price $P_{p}$:\n$$Q_{D}(P_{c}) = Q_{S}(P_{p})$$\nSubstituting the tax wedge relation:\n$$Q_{D}(P_{c}) = Q_{S}(P_{c} - t)$$\nWe analyze the effect of an infinitesimal change in the tax, $dt$, on the consumer price, $dP_{c}$. To do this, we differentiate the equilibrium condition with respect to $t$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP_{c}} \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} = \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} \\frac{dP_{p}}{dt}$$\nFrom the tax wedge $P_{p} = P_{c} - t$, we differentiate with respect to $t$ to find $\\frac{dP_{p}}{dt}$:\n$$\\frac{dP_{p}}{dt} = \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} - 1$$\nSubstituting this into our differentiated equilibrium condition:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP_{c}} \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} = \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} \\left( \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} - 1 \\right)$$\nOur goal is to find the fraction of the tax borne by consumers, which is the pass-through rate $\\frac{dP_{c}}{dt}$. We solve for this term:\n$$\\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP_{c}} \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} = \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} - \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}}$$\n$$\\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} = \\left( \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} - \\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP_{c}} \\right) \\frac{dP_{c}}{dt}$$\n$$\\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} = \\frac{\\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}}}{\\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP_{p}} - \\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP_{c}}}$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of the tax passed through to consumers. For an infinitesimal tax, the derivatives are evaluated at the pre-tax equilibrium point. We can express this result using the elasticities calculated previously.\nFrom the definition of elasticity, $\\epsilon_{S} = \\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP} \\frac{P^{*}}{Q^{*}}$ which implies $\\frac{dQ_{S}}{dP} = \\epsilon_{S} \\frac{Q^{*}}{P^{*}}$. Similarly, $\\frac{dQ_{D}}{dP} = \\epsilon_{D} \\frac{Q^{*}}{P^{*}}$.\nSubstituting these into the pass-through formula:\n$$\\frac{dP_{c}}{dt} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{S} \\frac{Q^{*}}{P^{*}}}{\\epsilon_{S} \\frac{Q^{*}}{P^{*}} - \\epsilon_{D} \\frac{Q^{*}}{P^{*}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{S}}{\\epsilon_{S} - \\epsilon_{D}}$$\nThis is the general formula for the consumer's share of tax incidence in terms of elasticities.\nUsing the values we calculated, $\\epsilon_{D} = -1$ and $\\epsilon_{S} = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\text{Consumer Share} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - (-1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}}$$\n$$\\text{Consumer Share} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nTherefore, the fraction of the tax borne by consumers is $\\frac{1}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "4371506"}, {"introduction": "The structure of a market, whether competitive or concentrated, has profound implications for prices and access to care.
