The beneficiary has hospital insurance (Medicare Part A) and medical insurance (Medicare Part B). Consider a single benefit period in which the beneficiary is hospitalized for $5$ consecutive days and, separately, receives several outpatient physician and supplier services. Assume the following cost-sharing parameters, which reflect generic, plausible levels for one year:\n\n- The Part A deductible per benefit period is $D_{A} = 1{,}632$ dollars. For an inpatient stay entirely within days $1$ through $60$ of the benefit period, there is no additional coinsurance beyond $D_{A}$.\n- The Part B annual deductible is $D_{B} = 240$ dollars. After the deductible is met, the standard Part B coinsurance rate is $\\alpha = 0.2$ applied to Medicare-allowed charges.\n- All providers accept assignment. There are no excess charges, no non-covered services, and no other surcharges.\n- Ignore any monthly premiums for Medicare or supplemental insurance, and ignore any out-of-pocket maximums; compute only cost-sharing owed at the point of service.\n\nThe beneficiary’s services and corresponding Medicare-allowed charges are:\n- Inpatient hospital stay of $5$ days (Part A). The hospital’s payment is determined prospectively; for the beneficiary, cost-sharing is governed only by $D_{A}$ because the stay is within days $1$–$60$.\n- Outpatient services (Part B): one established patient physician visit with allowed charge $200$ dollars; one advanced imaging study with allowed charge $600$ dollars; four physical therapy sessions with total allowed charges $300$ dollars; clinical laboratory testing with allowed charge $100$ dollars; and durable medical equipment with allowed charge $500$ dollars.\n\nNow, suppose the beneficiary either has no supplemental coverage or carries a standardized Supplemental Insurance (Medigap) Plan G policy. Standardized Medigap Plan G is defined as covering all Part A cost-sharing (including the deductible and coinsurance) and all Part B coinsurance and excess charges, but not the Part B annual deductible $D_{B}$.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of deductibles and coinsurance and the benefit period rules described above, compute the beneficiary’s total out-of-pocket liability under:\n1.

No supplemental coverage.\n    2.  Standardized Supplemental Insurance (Medigap) Plan G.\n-   **Medigap Plan G Definition:** Covers all Part A cost-sharing (including `$D_{A}$`), all Part B coinsurance, but not the Part B deductible `$D_{B}$`.\n-   **Required Output:** Compute the total out-of-pocket liability for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, expressed as a row vector.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is rooted in health systems science, a field explicitly permitted. It models the financial structure of the U.S. Medicare program, a real-world system. The parameters and rules, while simplified, are based on established facts, not speculation. The problem is directly relevant to the topic of *Medicare structure and financing*.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is structured to yield a unique solution. It provides all necessary numerical values (deductibles, coinsurance rates, charges) and a clear set of rules for calculation. The objective is unambiguous.\n-   **Objective:** The language is quantitative and precise, free from subjectivity or bias.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It defines all relevant terms and provides all data needed for the calculation. The explicit instruction to ignore premiums and out-of-pocket maximums eliminates potential ambiguity and ensures consistency.\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The financial values and patient scenario are realistic and plausible within the context of the Medicare system.\n-   **Structure and Complexity:** The problem is not trivial; it requires the correct, sequential application of financial rules (deductibles applied before coinsurance), which is a valid test of understanding a rule-based system. It is not ill-posed or tautological.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The analysis proceeds to a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the beneficiary's total out-of-pocket (OOP) liability, which is the sum of cost-sharing for Part A and Part B services. Let `$C_{OOP}$` denote the total OOP liability.\n\n$$ C_{OOP} = C_{A} + C_{B} $$\n\nwhere `$C_{A}$` is the liability for Part A services and `$C_{B}$` is the liability for Part B services.\n\nFirst, we determine the total allowed charges for all Part B services, denoted as `$C_{B,total}$`.\n$$ C_{B,total} = \\$200 + \\$600 + \\$300 + \\$100 + \\$500 = \\$1700 $$\n\nWe now analyze the two scenarios.\n\n**1. Scenario 1: Original Medicare without Supplemental Coverage**\n\n-   **Part A Liability (`$C_{A,1}$`):** The beneficiary had an inpatient stay of `$5$` days. For a stay between days `$1$` and `$60$` of a benefit period, the beneficiary's responsibility is limited to the Part A deductible.\n    $$ C_{A,1} = D_{A} = \\$1,632 $$\n\n-   **Part B Liability (`$C_{B,1}$`):** The beneficiary is responsible for the Part B annual deductible first, followed by coinsurance on the remaining Medicare-allowed charges. The annual deductible is `$D_{B} = \\$240$`. Since `$C_{B,total} = \\$1700 > \\$240$`, the full deductible is met. The amount of charges subject to coinsurance is the total charges less the deductible:\n    $$ \\text{Charges subject to coinsurance} = C_{B,total} - D_{B} = \\$1700 - \\$240 = \\$1460 $$\n    The coinsurance payment is `$20\\%` (or `$\\alpha = 0.2$`) of this amount:\n    $$ \\text{Coinsurance amount} = \\alpha \\times (\\$1460) = 0.2 \\times \\$1460 = \\$292 $$\n    The total Part B liability is the sum of the deductible and the coinsurance:\n    $$ C_{B,1} = D_{B} + \\text{Coinsurance amount} = \\$240 + \\$292 = \\$532 $$\n\n-   **Total Out-of-Pocket Liability (`$C_{OOP,1}$`)**: The total liability is the sum of the Part A and Part B liabilities.\n    $$ C_{OOP,1} = C_{A,1} + C_{B,1} = \\$1,632 + \\$532 = \\$2,164 $$\n\n**2. Scenario 2: Original Medicare with Medigap Plan G**\n\nMedigap Plan G covers specific cost-sharing obligations. We re-calculate the beneficiary's liability based on its defined coverage.\n\n-   **Part A Liability (`$C_{A,2}$`):** Medigap Plan G is defined to cover all Part A cost-sharing, which includes the deductible `$D_{A}$`. Therefore, the Medigap plan pays the `$1,632$` deductible. The beneficiary's liability is zero.\n    $$ C_{A,2} = \\$0 $$\n\n-   **Part B Liability (`$C_{B,2}$`):** Medigap Plan G does not cover the Part B annual deductible `$D_{B}$`. The beneficiary must pay this amount.\n    $$ \\text{Beneficiary's deductible payment} = D_{B} = \\$240 $$\n    Medigap Plan G *does* cover all Part B coinsurance. The coinsurance amount, calculated previously as `$292$`, is paid by the Medigap plan, not the beneficiary.\n    Thus, the beneficiary's only liability for Part B services is the annual deductible.\n    $$ C_{B,2} = D_{B} = \\$240 $$\n\n-   **Total Out-of-Pocket Liability (`$C_{OOP,2}$`)**: The total liability is the sum of the beneficiary's remaining Part A and Part B liabilities.\n    $$ C_{OOP,2} = C_{A,2} + C_{B,2} = \\$0 + \\$240 = \\$240 $$\n\nThe final results are `$2,164$` dollars for the first scenario and `$240$` dollars for the second scenario.
