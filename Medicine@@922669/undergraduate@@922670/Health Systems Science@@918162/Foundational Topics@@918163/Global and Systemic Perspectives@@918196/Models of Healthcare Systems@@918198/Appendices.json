In a Bismarck-style social health insurance model with fee-for-service, providers are paid a per-service fee; in a Beveridge-style National Health Service (NHS) or National Health Insurance (NHI) model with capitation, providers receive a fixed payment per enrolled patient that does not depend on the number of services delivered.\n\nConsider a single provider treating a representative patient (normalize the patient mass to $1$ for tractability). The provider chooses a service intensity $q \\ge 0$. The patient’s health benefit is $B(q) = a q - \\frac{1}{2} d q^{2}$ with parameters $a > 0$ and $d > 0$. The provider’s cost is $C(q) = c q + \\frac{1}{2} k q^{2}$ with parameters $c \\ge 0$ and $k > 0$. The provider is partially altruistic and maximizes $U = \\pi + \\lambda B(q)$ with altruism weight $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, where $\\pi$ denotes monetary profit.\n\nUnder fee-for-service, the revenue is $r q$ where $r > 0$ is the per-service fee, so $\\pi_{\\text{FFS}} = r q - C(q)$. Under capitation, the revenue is a fixed amount $R$ per patient, independent of $q$, so $\\pi_{\\text{CAP}} = R - C(q)$.\n\nTasks:\n- Using only the definitions of profit as revenue minus cost and the standard first-order condition for interior optima under concavity, derive the provider’s optimal $q_{\\text{FFS}}$ and $q_{\\text{CAP}}$ and the socially efficient $q^{S}$ that a social planner would choose by maximizing $B(q) - C(q)$.\n- Characterize, in terms of the primitives $\\{a,c,d,k,\\lambda,r\\}$, when fee-for-service induces overtreatment relative to the social benchmark (i.e., $q_{\\text{FFS}} > q^{S}$) and when capitation induces under-provision relative to the social benchmark (i.e., $q_{\\text{CAP}} < q^{S}$), assuming interior solutions.\n- Finally, derive the fee-per-service threshold $r^{*}$ such that $q_{\\text{FFS}} = q^{S}$. Values of $r$ above this threshold lead to $q_{\\text{FFS}} > q^{S}$ (overtreatment) and values below lead to $q_{\\text{FFS}} < q^{S}$ (under-provision) when comparing to the social benchmark, holding all other parameters fixed.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single closed-form expression for $r^{*}$ in terms of $\\{a,c,d,k,\\lambda\\}$. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required. Do not include any units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard microeconomic model used in health economics to analyze provider incentives under different payment systems. All functions and parameters are clearly defined, and the objectives are quantifiable. The quadratic forms for benefit and cost functions ensure strictly concave objective functions for the provider and the social planner, which guarantees that the first-order conditions yield unique interior maxima, as assumed by the problem statement. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we derive the optimal service intensity for the social planner, $q^S$, the provider under fee-for-service, $q_{\\text{FFS}}$, and the provider under capitation, $q_{\\text{CAP}}$.\n\nThe social planner's objective is to maximize the social welfare function, $W(q)$, defined as the patient's health benefit minus the provider's cost:\n$$W(q) = B(q) - C(q) = \\left(aq - \\frac{1}{2}dq^2\\right) - \\left(cq + \\frac{1}{2}kq^2\\right)$$\n$$W(q) = (a-c)q - \\frac{1}{2}(d+k)q^2$$\nTo find the socially efficient service intensity, $q^S$, we take the first derivative of $W(q)$ with respect to $q$ and set it to zero. This is the first-order condition (FOC) for a maximum.\n$$\\frac{dW}{dq} = a - c - (d+k)q = 0$$\nSolving for $q$ gives the socially optimal level:\n$$q^S = \\frac{a-c}{d+k}$$\nFor this to be an interior solution ($q^S > 0$), it is required that $a > c$, meaning the marginal benefit at zero intensity exceeds the marginal cost. The second derivative is $\\frac{d^2W}{dq^2} = -(d+k) < 0$ since $d>0$ and $k>0$, confirming this is a maximum.\n\nNext, we consider the provider under a fee-for-service (FFS) payment model. The provider's utility function is $U_{\\text{FFS}} = \\pi_{\\text{FFS}} + \\lambda B(q)$, where $\\pi_{\\text{FFS}} = rq - C(q)$.\n$$U_{\\text{FFS}}(q) = rq - C(q) + \\lambda B(q) = rq - \\left(cq + \\frac{1}{2}kq^2\\right) + \\lambda\\left(aq - \\frac{1}{2}dq^2\\right)$$\n$$U_{\\text{FFS}}(q) = (r-c+\\lambda a)q - \\frac{1}{2}(k+\\lambda d)q^2$$\nThe FOC is found by setting the first derivative with respect to $q$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dU_{\\text{FFS}}}{dq} = r - c + \\lambda a - (k+\\lambda d)q = 0$$\nSolving for $q$ gives the provider's optimal intensity under FFS:\n$$q_{\\text{FFS}} = \\frac{r-c+\\lambda a}{k+\\lambda d}$$\nThe second derivative is $\\frac{d^2U_{\\text{FFS}}}{dq^2} = -(k+\\lambda d) < 0$ since $k>0$, $d>0$, and $\\lambda \\ge 0$, confirming a maximum.\n\nFinally, we consider the provider under a capitation (CAP) payment model. The provider's utility is $U_{\\text{CAP}} = \\pi_{\\text{CAP}} + \\lambda B(q)$, where $\\pi_{\\text{CAP}} = R - C(q)$.\n$$U_{\\text{CAP}}(q) = R - C(q) + \\lambda B(q) = R - \\left(cq + \\frac{1}{2}kq^2\\right) + \\lambda\\left(aq - \\frac{1}{2}dq^2\\right)$$\n$$U_{\\text{CAP}}(q) = R + (\\lambda a - c)q - \\frac{1}{2}(k+\\lambda d)q^2$$\nThe FOC is found by setting the first derivative with respect to $q$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dU_{\\text{CAP}}}{dq} = \\lambda a - c - (k+\\lambda d)q = 0$$\nSolving for $q$ gives the provider's optimal intensity under capitation:\n$$q_{\\text{CAP}} = \\frac{\\lambda a - c}{k+\\lambda d}$$\nThe second derivative is $\\frac{d^2U_{\\text{CAP}}}{dq^2} = -(k+\\lambda d) < 0$, again confirming a maximum.\n\nSecond, we characterize the conditions for overtreatment under FFS ($q_{\\text{FFS}} > q^S$) and under-provision under capitation ($q_{\\text{CAP}} < q^S$).\nFor FFS overtreatment, we require:\n$$q_{\\text{FFS}} > q^S \\implies \\frac{r-c+\\lambda a}{k+\\lambda d} > \\frac{a-c}{d+k}$$\nSince both denominators are positive, we can cross-multiply:\n$$(r-c+\\lambda a)(d+k) > (a-c)(k+\\lambda d)$$\n$$rd + rk - cd - ck + \\lambda ad + \\lambda ak > ak + a\\lambda d - ck - c\\lambda d$$\nCanceling the $-ck$ term and rearranging to solve for $r$:\n$$r(d+k) > ak + a\\lambda d - cd - \\lambda ad - \\lambda ak + c\\lambda d$$\n$$r(d+k) > ak(1-\\lambda) + cd - c\\lambda d - a\\lambda d + a\\lambda d$$\n$$r(d+k) > ak(1-\\lambda) + cd(1-\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)(ak+cd)$$\nThe condition for FFS overtreatment is:\n$$r > \\frac{(1-\\lambda)(ak+cd)}{d+k}$$\n\nFor capitation under-provision, we require:\n$$q_{\\text{CAP}} < q^S \\implies \\frac{\\lambda a - c}{k+\\lambda d} < \\frac{a-c}{d+k}$$\nAssuming an interior solution for $q_{\\text{CAP}}$ (i.e., $\\lambda a - c > 0$), and knowing the denominators are positive, we can cross-multiply:\n$$(\\lambda a - c)(d+k) < (a-c)(k+\\lambda d)$$\n$$\\lambda ad + \\lambda ak - cd - ck < ak + a\\lambda d - ck - c\\lambda d$$\nCanceling $-ck$ from both sides:\n$$\\lambda ad + \\lambda ak - cd < ak + a\\lambda d - c\\lambda d$$\n$$(\\lambda a - a)k < (cd - c\\lambda d) - (\\lambda ad - a\\lambda d) $$\n$$-ak(1-\\lambda) < cd(1-\\lambda)$$\nIf $\\lambda = 1$, the inequality is $0 < 0$, which is false. In this case, $q_{\\text{CAP}} = q^S$, as expected for a fully altruistic provider. If $\\lambda < 1$, then $1-\\lambda > 0$, and we can divide by it:\n$$-ak < cd \\implies ak+cd > 0$$\nSince $a>0$, $k>0$, $c \\ge 0$, and $d>0$, the term $ak+cd$ is always positive. Thus, for any provider who is not perfectly altruistic ($\\lambda < 1$) and provides a non-zero quantity of services under capitation, under-provision relative to the social optimum is guaranteed.\n\nThird, we derive the fee-per-service threshold $r^*$ such that $q_{\\text{FFS}} = q^S$. This is the fee that aligns the provider's incentives with the social planner's. We set the expressions for $q_{\\text{FFS}}$ and $q^S$ equal, substituting $r$ with $r^*$:\n$$\\frac{r^*-c+\\lambda a}{k+\\lambda d} = \\frac{a-c}{d+k}$$\nWe solve for $r^*$:\n$$r^* - c + \\lambda a = (a-c)\\frac{k+\\lambda d}{d+k}$$\n$$r^* = c - \\lambda a + (a-c)\\frac{k+\\lambda d}{d+k}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator, which is $d+k$:\n$$r^* = \\frac{(c - \\lambda a)(d+k) + (a-c)(k+\\lambda d)}{d+k}$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = (cd + ck - \\lambda ad - \\lambda ak) + (ak + a\\lambda d - ck - c\\lambda d)$$\nWe cancel and group terms: the $+ck$ and $-ck$ terms cancel; the $-\\lambda ad$ and $+a\\lambda d$ terms cancel.\n$$\\text{Numerator} = cd - \\lambda ak + ak - c\\lambda d$$\nFactoring by $1-\\lambda$:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = ak(1-\\lambda) + cd(1-\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)(ak+cd)$$\nThus, the threshold fee $r^*$ is:\n$$r^* = \\frac{(1-\\lambda)(ak+cd)}{d+k}$$\nThis expression matches the threshold derived in the analysis of overtreatment. For $r > r^*$, the system induces overtreatment ($q_{\\text{FFS}} > q^S$), and for $r < r^*$, it induces under-provision ($q_{\\text{FFS}} < q^S$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(1-\\lambda)(ak+cd)}{d+k}}$$", "id": "4383728"}, {"introduction": "While provider incentives are critical, the patient's role is equally important, especially in systems with fee-for-service payments.

The expectation of a finite sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. Therefore, we can move the expectation operator inside the summation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}] = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\mathbb{E}[r_j Q_j]\n$$\nWithin each term of the sum, the fee $r_j$ is a non-random constant. A property of expectation is that for any constant $a$ and random variable $X$, $\\mathbb{E}[aX] = a\\mathbb{E}[X]$. Applying this property, we can factor out the constant $r_j$ from each expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}] = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} r_j \\mathbb{E}[Q_j]\n$$\nThe problem defines the mean quantity of service $j$ as $\\bar{q}_j = \\mathbb{E}[Q_j]$. Substituting this definition into our expression yields the final closed-form expression for the expected total expenditure:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}] = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} r_j \\bar{q}_j\n$$\n\nb) Derivation of $\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c)$ under a behavioral model.\n\nWe are given a behavioral model where the mean demand for each service is a linear function of the coinsurance rate $c$:\n$$\n\\bar{q}_j(c) = \\alpha_j - \\beta_j c r_j\n$$\nHere, the mean quantity $\\bar{q}_j$ and consequently the expected expenditure become functions of $c$. We start with the result from part a), adapted for the dependence on $c$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} r_j \\bar{q}_j(c)\n$$\nNow, substitute the given expression for $\\bar{q}_j(c)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} r_j (\\alpha_j - \\beta_j c r_j)\n$$\nWe can distribute the $r_j$ term inside the parentheses:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} (\\alpha_j r_j - \\beta_j c r_j^2)\n$$\nUsing the additivity property of summation, we can separate this into two sums:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\alpha_j r_j - \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_j c r_j^2\n$$\nIn the second sum, the coinsurance rate $c$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $j$.

The first term, $\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\alpha_j r_j$, is a constant with respect to $c$, so its derivative is $0$. The second term is a product of $c$ and the constant sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_j r_j^2$. The derivative of $k \\cdot c$ with respect to $c$ is $k$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc}\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) = 0 - \\frac{d}{dc}\\left( c \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_j r_j^2 \\right) = - \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_j r_j^2\n$$\nSign of the derivative: The problem states that $\\beta_j > 0$ for all $j$. The fee schedule rates $r_j$ are squared, so $r_j^2 \\ge 0$. Assuming at least one service has a non-zero fee, the term $\\beta_j r_j^2$ is strictly positive for that service and non-negative for all others. The sum of non-negative terms, at least one of which is positive, is strictly positive: $\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\beta_j r_j^2 > 0$. The derivative is the negative of this sum. Therefore, the sign of the marginal effect is negative:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dc}\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c) < 0\n$$\nInterpretation: The derivative $\\frac{d}{dc}\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Spend}](c)$ measures the change in expected total healthcare spending for a one-unit increase in the coinsurance rate $c$. A negative sign indicates that as the patient's share of the cost ($c$) increases, the expected total expenditure for the health system decreases. This occurs because a higher out-of-pocket price for the patient ($c r_j$) leads to a lower quantity of services demanded ($\\bar{q}_j(c) = \\alpha_j - \\beta_j c r_j$ decreases as $c$ increases, since $\\beta_j > 0$). This behavioral response, where consumption of an insured service decreases as patient cost-sharing increases, demonstrates the mitigation of moral hazard.

This is the sum of probabilities for all outcomes of $R$ that are greater than or equal to $0.10$.\n\nFor the Beveridge region ($B$):\nThe values of $R$ are $\\{0.02, 0.06, 0.11, 0.20\\}$.\nThe values $\\ge 0.10$ are $\\{0.11, 0.20\\}$.\n$P(R \\ge 0.10 | M=B) = P(R=0.11) + P(R=0.20) = 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20$.\n\nFor the Bismarck region ($S$):\nThe values of $R$ are $\\{0.03, 0.08, 0.15, 0.30\\}$.\nThe values $\\ge 0.10$ are $\\{0.15, 0.30\\}$.\n$P(R \\ge 0.10 | M=S) = P(R=0.15) + P(R=0.30) = 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20$.\n\nFor the NHI region ($N$):\nThe values of $R$ are $\\{0.04, 0.10, 0.18, 0.35\\}$.\nThe values $\\ge 0.10$ are $\\{0.10, 0.18, 0.35\\}$.\n$P(R \\ge 0.10 | M=N) = P(R=0.10) + P(R=0.18) + P(R=0.35) = 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.65$.\n\nFor the OOP region ($O$):\nThe values of $R$ are $\\{0.05, 0.12, 0.25, 0.40\\}$.\nThe values $\\ge 0.10$ are $\\{0.12, 0.25, 0.40\\}$.\n$P(R \\ge 0.10 | M=O) = P(R=0.12) + P(R=0.25) + P(R=0.40) = 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nThe national incidence at $\\theta = 0.10$ is:\n$$\n\\text{inc}(0.10) = w_B \\cdot P(R \\ge 0.10|M=B) + w_S \\cdot P(R \\ge 0.10|M=S) + w_N \\cdot P(R \\ge 0.10|M=N) + w_O \\cdot P(R \\ge 0.10|M=O)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{inc}(0.10) = (0.30)(0.20) + (0.25)(0.20) + (0.25)(0.65) + (0.20)(0.80)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{inc}(0.10) = 0.0600 + 0.0500 + 0.1625 + 0.1600 = 0.4325\n$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the national incidence for $\\theta = 0.25$.\nWe repeat the process for the threshold $\\theta = 0.25$.\n\nFor the Beveridge region ($B$):\nThe values of $R$ are $\\{0.02, 0.06, 0.11, 0.20\\}$.
