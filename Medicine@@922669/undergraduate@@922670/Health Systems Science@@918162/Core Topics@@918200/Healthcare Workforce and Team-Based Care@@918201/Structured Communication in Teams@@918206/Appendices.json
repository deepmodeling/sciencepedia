Before we can determine the impact of a structured communication tool like Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR), we must first quantify how consistently and completely it is being used.

Consider a completeness metric for SBAR in which each handoff is evaluated across the four SBAR components.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that requires the calculation of a weighted arithmetic mean. All data required for the calculation are provided, and the definitions are clear and unambiguous.\n\nThe objective is to compute the average SBAR completeness score, which we will denote as $\\bar{C}$, across a set of $N$ audited handoffs. The problem states that this average is the arithmetic mean of the individual per-handoff scores. Since the handoffs are grouped by their completeness scores, this calculation is equivalent to finding a weighted average.\n\nThe total number of audited handoffs is given as $N=20$. The data are provided in three distinct groups:\n1. A group of $n_1 = 12$ handoffs, each with a completeness score of $C_1 = 1$.\n2.

This exercise bridges the gap between a process change—the adoption of SBAR—and its effect on patient outcomes.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires the calculation of three standard measures of effect in epidemiology, based on a given baseline risk and an intervention effect.\n\nLet $R_C$ be the risk in the control group (baseline) and $R_T$ be the risk in the treatment group (post-intervention).\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- Baseline risk: $R_C = p = 0.15$\n- Post-intervention risk: $R_T = f p = 0.6 \\times 0.15$\n\nFirst, we calculate the post-intervention risk, $R_T$:\n$$R_T = 0.6 \\times 0.15 = 0.09$$\n\nNext, we compute the three required quantities: Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$), Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$), and Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$).\n\n1.  **Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$)**\n    The $ARR$ is the absolute difference in risk between the control and treatment groups.\n    $$ARR = R_C - R_T$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ARR = 0.15 - 0.09 = 0.06$$\n\n2.  **Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$)**\n    The $RRR$ is the proportional reduction in risk in the treatment group relative to the control group. It can be calculated as the $ARR$ divided by the baseline risk $R_C$.\n    $$RRR = \\frac{R_C - R_T}{R_C} = \\frac{ARR}{R_C}$$\n    Substituting the calculated $ARR$ and the given $R_C$:\n    $$RRR = \\frac{0.06}{0.15}$$\n    To simplify the fraction:\n    $$RRR = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n    Alternatively, we can express $RRR$ in terms of the given factors $p$ and $f$:\n    $$RRR = \\frac{p - f p}{p} = \\frac{p(1 - f)}{p} = 1 - f$$\n    Using the given value $f = 0.6$:\n    $$RRR = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n    This confirms the previous calculation.\n\n3.  **Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$)**\n    The $NNT$ is defined as the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome.\n    $$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n    Using the calculated value of $ARR = 0.06$:\n    $$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.06} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{6}{100}} = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3}$$\n    As a decimal, this is approximately $16.666...$\n\n**Rounding to Three Significant Figures**\nThe problem requires the final numerical answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\n- For $ARR = 0.06$, the first significant digit is $6$. To express this value with three significant figures, we add two trailing zeros: $0.0600$.\n- For $RRR = 0.4$, the first significant digit is $4$. To express this value with three significant figures, we add two trailing zeros: $0.400$.\n- For $NNT \\approx 16.666...$, the first three significant digits are $1$, $6$, and the third digit, $6$. The fourth digit is $6$ (which is $\\geq 5$), so we round up the third digit. This results in $16.7$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- $ARR = 0.0600$\n- $RRR = 0.400$\n- $NNT = 16.7$\n\nThese values are to be presented as a row matrix in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.0600 & 0.400 & 16.7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4397038"}, {"introduction": "The 'Assessment' component of SBAR is arguably the most critical, as it synthesizes information into a clinical judgment.
