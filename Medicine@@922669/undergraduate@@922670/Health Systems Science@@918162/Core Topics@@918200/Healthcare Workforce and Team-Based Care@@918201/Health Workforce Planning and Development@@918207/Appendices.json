The concepts of supply ($S$), demand ($D$), and shortage ($D-S$) are fundamental and well-established. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($S$ and $D$) and specifies the exact calculations and reporting formats required. A unique and meaningful solution can be determined. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements. The problem is objective.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem does not violate any other validation criteria. It is complete, consistent, realistic, and directly formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two distinct metrics based on the provided supply and demand figures for a clinical workforce.\n\nFirst, we identify the given quantities:\n- The supply of clinicians, $S = 8,500$.\n- The demand for clinicians, $D = 9,200$.\n\nA shortage exists because the demand ($D$) is greater than the supply ($S$).\n$$D > S \\implies 9,200 > 8,500$$\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the **absolute workforce shortage**, which will be denoted as $A_{shortage}$. This is defined as the difference between the number of clinicians demanded and the number of clinicians supplied.\n$$A_{shortage} = D - S$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A_{shortage} = 9,200 - 8,500$$\n$$A_{shortage} = 700$$\nThus, the absolute shortage is $700$ clinicians.\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the **shortage proportion relative to demand**, which will be denoted as $P_{shortage}$. This is a normalized measure of the shortage, calculated by dividing the absolute shortage by the total demand. This metric expresses the shortage as a fraction of the required workforce.\n$$P_{shortage} = \\frac{A_{shortage}}{D}$$\nSubstituting the calculated absolute shortage and the given demand:\n$$P_{shortage} = \\frac{700}{9,200}$$\nTo obtain the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$P_{shortage} = \\frac{7}{92} \\approx 0.0760869565...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. Significant figures begin at the first non-zero digit. In the value $0.0760869565...$, the first significant figure is $7$, the second is $6$, the third is $0$, and the fourth is $8$. To round to four significant figures, we inspect the fifth significant figure, which is $6$. Since $6 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\nThe fourth significant figure, $8$, is rounded up to $9$.\nTherefore, the shortage proportion rounded to four significant figures is $0.07609$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two computed quantities—absolute shortage and shortage proportion—to be presented in that specific order.\n- Absolute shortage: $700$.\n- Shortage proportion: $0.07609$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n700  0.07609\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4375499"}, {"introduction": "While a simple headcount of clinicians provides some information, it doesn't capture the true service capacity, as many individuals may work part-time.

This practice synthesizes several key concepts to solve a common, real-world staffing challenge: meeting a mandated nurse-to-patient ratio in a unit that operates 24/7. It crucially introduces the distinction between paid hours and productive hours available for direct patient care, a vital factor in ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels.

The unit operates three identical $8$-hour shifts per day. The organization defines one Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) as $40$ paid hours per week. On average, each FTE has a non-productive paid time fraction of $0.10$ (education, meetings, paid leave) and an unscheduled absenteeism fraction of $0.05$, both of which reduce the hours available for direct patient care. Assume these two fractions are non-overlapping and fully reduce productive hours available for direct care.\n\nThe current baseline staffing for bedside registered nurses on this unit is $70$ FTE. Using only the following foundational definitions from health workforce planning—nurse-to-patient ratio as the number of nurses required per patient, FTE as a standardized weekly hour equivalent, and continuous shift coverage as the requirement to staff all hours in the week—compute the additional FTE required to meet the mandated ratio under the stated conditions.\n\nExpress your final answer in FTE and round your result to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in health workforce planning principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe objective is to compute the additional Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) required for a hospital unit to meet a mandated nurse-to-patient ratio. The calculation proceeds in a structured manner.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of direct-care registered nurses that must be on duty at all times. The unit has a continuous average census of $C = 64$ patients, and the mandated ratio is $1$ nurse for every $4$ patients.\nThe number of nurses required on duty, $N_{duty}$, is:\n$$N_{duty} = \\frac{\\text{Patient Census}}{\\text{Patients per Nurse}} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\text{ nurses}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of direct-care nursing hours required to staff the unit for an entire week. The unit operates continuously, which is $24$ hours a day, $7$ days a week. The problem states there are three $8$-hour shifts, confirming the $24$-hour coverage ($3 \\times 8 = 24$).\nThe total hours in a week, $H_{week}$, is:\n$$H_{week} = 24 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} = 168 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe total required direct-care nursing hours per week, $H_{required}$, is the product of the number of nurses needed on duty and the total hours in the week:\n$$H_{required} = N_{duty} \\times H_{week} = 16 \\times 168 = 2688 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nNow, we must determine the number of productive, direct-care hours that a single FTE provides per week. An FTE is defined as $H_{paid} = 40$ paid hours per week. However, not all paid hours are available for direct patient care. We are given a non-productive time fraction, $f_{np} = 0.10$, and an unscheduled absenteeism fraction, $f_a = 0.05$. These fractions are specified as non-overlapping and reduce the hours available for direct care.\nThe total fraction of paid time that is not productive for direct care is the sum of these two fractions:\n$$f_{non-productive\\_total} = f_{np} + f_a = 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15$$\nThe fraction of an FTE's time that is productive for direct care is therefore:\n$$f_{productive} = 1 - f_{non-productive\\_total} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$$\nThe number of productive direct-care hours provided by one FTE per week, $H_{productive}$, is:\n$$H_{productive} = H_{paid} \\times f_{productive} = 40 \\times 0.85 = 34 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nWith the total required direct-care hours and the productive hours per FTE, we can calculate the total number of FTEs required to staff the unit, $FTE_{required}$:\n$$FTE_{required} = \\frac{H_{required}}{H_{productive}} = \\frac{2688}{34} \\approx 79.05882...$$\n\nThe problem states that the current baseline staffing for the unit is $FTE_{current} = 70$. The question asks for the *additional* FTE required, $FTE_{additional}$, which is the difference between the required FTE and the current FTE:\n$$FTE_{additional} = FTE_{required} - FTE_{current} = 79.05882... - 70 = 9.05882...$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number is $9.05882...$. The first three significant figures are $9$, $0$, and $5$.
