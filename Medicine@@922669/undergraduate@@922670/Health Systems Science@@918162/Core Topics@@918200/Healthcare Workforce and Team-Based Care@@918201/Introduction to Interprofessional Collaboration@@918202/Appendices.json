The network has $n=5$ nodes, representing roles in a healthcare team: $1=$ Physician, $2=$ Registered Nurse (RN), $3=$ Pharmacist, $4=$ Social Worker, and $5=$ Physical Therapist. The graph is undirected and unweighted.\n\nThe adjacency matrix is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this matrix, we can determine the edges of the graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. An edge $(i, j)$ exists if $A_{ij}=1$. The edges are:\n$(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,5)$. The graph structure consists of a path $1-2-4-5$ and a triangle formed by nodes $\\{2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nTo compute the betweenness centrality of each node, we must first identify all geodesic (shortest) paths between all unordered pairs of distinct nodes. There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ such pairs. Let $\\sigma_{st}$ be the number of shortest paths between nodes $s$ and $t$, and let $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ be the number of those paths that pass through an intermediary node $v$.\n\n1.  Pair $(1,2)$: The shortest path is the direct edge $1-2$. The path length is $1$. There are no intermediary nodes. $\\sigma_{12}=1$.\n2.  Pair $(1,3)$: The shortest path is $1-2-3$. The length is $2$. Node $2$ is an intermediary. $\\sigma_{13}=1$, $\\sigma_{13}(2)=1$.\n3.  Pair $(1,4)$: The shortest path is $1-2-4$. The length is $2$.

There are no intermediary nodes. $\\sigma_{45}=1$.\n\nThe betweenness centrality $C_B(v)$ of a node $v$ is the sum of the fractions of shortest paths that pass through $v$ for all pairs of nodes $(s, t)$ where $s, t \\neq v$:\n$$\nC_B(v) = \\sum_{s<t; s, t \\neq v} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}\n$$\nWe calculate this for each node:\n-   $C_B(1)$ (Physician): Node $1$ is an endpoint in all paths involving it and is never an intermediary. Thus, $C_B(1) = 0$.\n-   $C_B(2)$ (RN): Node $2$ is an intermediary for pairs $(1,3)$, $(1,4)$, and $(1,5)$.\n    $$C_B(2) = \\frac{\\sigma_{13}(2)}{\\sigma_{13}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{14}(2)}{\\sigma_{14}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{15}(2)}{\\sigma_{15}} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} = 3$$\n-   $C_B(3)$ (Pharmacist): Node $3$ is not on any of the unique shortest paths listed above (except as an endpoint). For example, the shortest path between nodes $2$ and $4$ is the direct edge, not via node $3$. Thus, $C_B(3) = 0$.\n-   $C_B(4)$ (Social Worker): Node $4$ is an intermediary for pairs $(1,5)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,5)$.\n    $$C_B(4) = \\frac{\\sigma_{15}(4)}{\\sigma_{15}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{25}(4)}{\\sigma_{25}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{35}(4)}{\\sigma_{35}} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} = 3$$\n-   $C_B(5)$ (Physical Therapist): Node $5$ is an endpoint in all paths involving it and is never an intermediary. Thus, $C_B(5) = 0$.\n\nThe betweenness centrality scores are: $C_B(1)=0$, $C_B(2)=3$, $C_B(3)=0$, $C_B(4)=3$, $C_B(5)=0$.\n\nNext, we identify the key brokers, which are nodes whose removal would fragment the network into more than one connected component. These are known as articulation points or cut vertices.\n-   Removal of node $1$: The remaining graph on nodes $\\{2,3,4,5\\}$ is connected.\n-   Removal of node $2$: Node $1$ becomes isolated from the connected subgraph on $\\{3,4,5\\}$. The network splits into two components. Node $2$ is an articulation point.\n-   Removal of node $3$: The remaining graph on nodes $\\{1,2,4,5\\}$ is connected.\n-   Removal of node $4$: Node $5$ becomes isolated from the connected subgraph on $\\{1,2,3\\}$. The network splits into two components. Node $4$ is an articulation point.\n-   Removal of node $5$: The remaining graph on nodes $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is connected.\nThe key brokers are node $2$ (RN) and node $4$ (Social Worker), which aligns with them having the highest betweenness centrality scores. They serve as critical bridges in the communication network.\n\nFinally, we compute the maximum normalized betweenness centrality. The normalization for an undirected graph with $n$ nodes is performed by dividing the raw score by the maximum possible score, which is the number of pairs of other nodes: $\\binom{n-1}{2}$.\nFor $n=5$, the normalization factor is $\\binom{5-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\nThe normalized betweenness centrality $C'_B(v)$ is given by $C_B(v)/6$.\n-   $C'_B(1) = 0/6 = 0$\n-   $C'_B(2) = 3/6 = 0.5$\n-   $C'_B(3) = 0/6 = 0$\n-   $C'_B(4) = 3/6 = 0.5$\n-   $C'_B(5) = 0/6 = 0$\nThe maximum normalized betweenness centrality value observed in this network is $0.5$. The problem requires this to be reported to four significant figures, which is $0.5000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "4377891"}, {"introduction": "An effective interprofessional team doesn't just communicate well; it manages the flow of patients efficiently. Queuing theory offers fundamental insights into system dynamics, and Little's Law is a cornerstone principle that connects patient arrival rates, time spent in the system, and the number of patients currently in the clinic. In this practice, you will apply Little's Law ($L = \\lambda W$) to a clinical scenario, transforming abstract concepts of patient flow into a tangible measure of system congestion, known as work-in-process [@problem_id:4377886].

Patients arrive according to a long-run average rate, and each patient experiences a total time in the system that includes waiting and service across all professions. Under steady-state conditions, assume flow conservation holds and long-run averages are well defined.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and conservation-of-flow, first state in words the relationship commonly known as Little’s Law, then derive the mathematical relation that connects the long-run average number of patients in the system, the long-run average arrival rate, and the average time a patient spends in the system.\n\nFinally, apply your derived relation to this clinic with average arrival rate $\\lambda = 6$ patients per hour and average time in system $W = 1.5$ hours to compute the clinic’s average work-in-process (WIP), defined as the long-run average number of patients either waiting or being served by any professional. Express your answer in patients. Do not round unless necessary; if rounding is needed, round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for three distinct parts: a verbal statement of Little's Law, its mathematical derivation from fundamental principles, and its application to a specific scenario.\n\nFirst, the verbal statement of Little’s Law. Under steady-state conditions for any system where the long-run average input rate equals the long-run average output rate (flow conservation), the long-run average number of items in the system is equal to the long-run average arrival rate of items multiplied by the average time an item spends in the system. This law is remarkably general and holds true regardless of the arrival process distribution, the service time distribution, or the number of servers, provided the system is stable and in a steady state.\n\nSecond, the derivation of the mathematical relation. Let us define the following quantities for a system observed over a time interval from $0$ to $T$:\n- $A(t)$: The cumulative number of arrivals to the system up to time $t$.\n- $D(t)$: The cumulative number of departures from the system up to time $t$.\n- $N(t) = A(t) - D(t)$: The number of items (patients) in the system at time $t$.\n\nThe long-run average arrival rate, $\\lambda$, is defined as the limit of the average rate of arrivals over a very long time interval:\n$$ \\lambda = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{A(T)}{T} $$\nThe long-run average number of patients in the system, which the problem calls Work-in-Process (WIP) and we will denote by $L$, is the time-average of $N(t)$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T N(t) dt $$\nThe total time spent in the system by all patients who arrived and departed within a very long interval $[0, T]$ is represented by the area between the cumulative arrival curve $A(t)$ and the cumulative departure curve $D(t)$. This area is exactly the integral of the number of patients in the system over time, $\\int_0^T N(t) dt$.\n\nThe average time a patient spends in the system, $W$, is the total time spent by all patients divided by the total number of patients who have passed through the system. For a large time $T$, the number of patients who have passed through the system is approximately the number of arrivals, $A(T)$. Therefore, $W$ is given by:\n$$ W = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\text{Total time spent by all patients}}{\\text{Total number of patients}} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\int_0^T N(t) dt}{A(T)} $$\nTo derive the relationship, we can manipulate the expression for $W$ by multiplying and dividing by $T$:\n$$ W = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\int_0^T N(t) dt}{T} \\cdot \\frac{T}{A(T)} \\right) $$\nAssuming the individual limits exist, which is true for a stable system in a steady state, we can separate the limit of the product into the product of the limits:\n$$ W = \\left( \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T N(t) dt \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{T}{A(T)} \\right) $$\nBy substituting our definitions for $L$ and $\\lambda$, we obtain:\n$$ W = L \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{A(T)}{T}} \\right) = L \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} $$\nRearranging this equation gives the standard mathematical form of Little's Law:\n$$ L = \\lambda W $$\nThis relationship connects the long-run average number of patients in the system ($L$), the long-run average arrival rate ($\\lambda$), and the average time a patient spends in the system ($W$).\n\nFinally, we apply this derived relation to the clinic. The problem provides the following values:\n- Average arrival rate, $\\lambda = 6$ patients per hour.\n- Average time in system, $W = 1.5$ hours.\nThe clinic's average work-in-process (WIP) is defined as the long-run average number of patients in the system, which is precisely the quantity $L$. Using the derived formula $L = \\lambda W$:\n$$ L = (6 \\text{ patients/hour}) \\times (1.5 \\text{ hours}) $$\nThe units of hours cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity representing the number of patients.\n$$ L = 6 \\times 1.5 = 9 $$\nThus, the clinic’s average work-in-process is $9$ patients.
