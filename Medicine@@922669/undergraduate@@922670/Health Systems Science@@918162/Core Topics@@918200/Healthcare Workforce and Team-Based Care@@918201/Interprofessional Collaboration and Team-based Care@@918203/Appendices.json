This suggests a balance: the team is cohesive enough for information to circulate effectively but not so dense as to create an overwhelming communication burden on team members. This supports reasonably efficient coordination.\n    \\item **Degree Centralization ($C_D = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$)**: This value is low. A value of $1$ would indicate a star graph where one member is central to all communication. The low centralization signifies a decentralized, egalitarian communication structure. No single team member acts as a dominant hub or bottleneck. This structure is highly **resilient** because the removal of any single node (e.g., a team member is unavailable) will not fragment the network. For **efficiency**, this decentralized structure is beneficial for complex, collaborative tasks requiring input from multiple disciplines, as it facilitates parallel communication and avoids overloading a central coordinator.\n    \\item **Global Clustering Coefficient ($T = \\frac{6}{13} \\approx 0.46$)**: This value is moderately high, indicating a strong tendency for team members' collaborators to also collaborate with each other. This high degree of \"cliquishness\" promotes **efficiency** in coordination within small subgroups (the triangles). It fosters trust, shared understanding, and rapid information exchange for localized tasks. For example, the triangle $\\{1,2,3\\}$ (Physician, RN, Pharmacist) can coordinate efficiently on medication management. The overlaps between these clusters (e.g., node 1 participates in three triangles) act as crucial bridges, ensuring that these cohesive subgroups remain integrated within the broader team, which enhances overall network **resilience** by preventing siloing.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn summary, the observed structure with low centralization, moderate density, and high clustering supports a team that is likely both resilient to disruption and efficient at collaborative, complex care planning.\n\nThe three metrics, in the specified order, are: density $\\frac{11}{21}$, degree centralization $\\frac{1}{5}$, and global clustering coefficient $\\frac{6}{13}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{11}{21} & \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{6}{13}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4376960"}, {"introduction": "One of the most critical functions of team-based care is enhancing patient safety.

The checks are conducted in a way that justifies modeling their detection events as independent, and the double-check system is designed so that an error is considered detected if at least one professional detects it (a parallel reliability configuration).\n\nStarting from the axioms of probability, the definition of independence, and the reliability interpretation of parallel subsystems (system success occurs if any component succeeds), derive a closed-form expression for the overall conditional probability that the team detects the error in terms of $p_1$ and $p_2$. Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression. No rounding is required and no units are needed.", "solution": "The derivation proceeds from the foundational principles of probability as requested. Let the sample space be defined for the condition that an error is present in a medication order.\n\nLet $D_1$ be the event that the pharmacist detects the error.\nLet $D_2$ be the event that the nurse detects the error.\n\nThe problem provides the conditional probabilities for these events, given that an error exists:\n$P(D_1) = p_1$\n$P(D_2) = p_2$\n\nThe problem states that the double-check system is a parallel reliability configuration, where the system succeeds (i.e., the error is detected by the team) if at least one of the professionals detects it. This corresponds to the union of the individual detection events. Let $D_{team}$ be the event that the team detects the error. Then, by definition:\n$$D_{team} = D_1 \\cup D_2$$\nOur objective is to find $P(D_{team}) = P(D_1 \\cup D_2)$.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways, both rooted in the axioms of probability and the definition of independence. The most direct method for a parallel system involves analyzing the complementary event, which corresponds to system failure.\n\nThe complementary event to $D_{team}$ is $D_{team}^c$, which represents the team failing to detect the error. From the axioms of probability, the relationship between the probability of an event and its complement is:\n$$P(D_{team}) = 1 - P(D_{team}^c)$$\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements:\n$$D_{team}^c = (D_1 \\cup D_2)^c = D_1^c \\cap D_2^c$$\nHere, $D_1^c$ is the event that the pharmacist fails to detect the error, and $D_2^c$ is the event that the nurse fails to detect the error. The event $D_1^c \\cap D_2^c$ means that both the pharmacist and the nurse fail to detect the error. This is the condition for system failure.\n\nThe probabilities of these individual failure events are derived from the probability of their complements:\n$$P(D_1^c) = 1 - P(D_1) = 1 - p_1$$\n$$P(D_2^c) = 1 - P(D_2) = 1 - p_2$$\n\nThe problem states that the checks are independent. A fundamental consequence of the definition of independence is that if two events $D_1$ and $D_2$ are independent, then their complements $D_1^c$ and $D_2^c$ are also independent.\n\nBy the definition of independence, the probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(D_1^c \\cap D_2^c) = P(D_1^c) P(D_2^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the probabilities of the individual failure events, we find the probability of system failure:\n$$P(D_{team}^c) = P(D_1^c \\cap D_2^c) = (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)$$\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of the team detecting the error, $P(D_{team})$, by substituting this result back into the complement rule:\n$$P(D_{team}) = 1 - P(D_{team}^c) = 1 - (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)$$\n\nTo obtain the simplified closed-form expression, we expand the product:\n$$1 - (1 - p_2 - p_1 + p_1p_2)$$\n$$1 - 1 + p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2$$\n$$p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2$$\n\nAlternatively, one can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two events, which is derived from the axioms of probability:\n$$P(D_1 \\cup D_2) = P(D_1) + P(D_2) - P(D_1 \\cap D_2)$$\nSince the events $D_1$ and $D_2$ are independent, the probability of their intersection is $P(D_1 \\cap D_2) = P(D_1)P(D_2) = p_1p_2$.\nSubstituting this into the inclusion-exclusion formula yields the same result:\n$$P(D_1 \\cup D_2) = p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2$$\n\nBoth rigorous paths lead to the same final expression for the overall conditional probability that the team detects the error.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2}$$", "id": "4376976"}, {"introduction": "Effective team workflows are not accidental; they are the result of carefully balancing competing demands.
