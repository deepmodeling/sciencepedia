Leadership has mandated that for safety, coordination, and conflict resolution, each unordered pair of professions must maintain a direct dyadic communication channel for daily check-ins.

It presents a clear, self-contained, and objective question rooted in combinatorial principles and applied to a plausible scenario in health systems science. The concept that communication overhead scales non-linearly with team size is a well-established principle in organizational theory and systems engineering. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Channel Count Function $C(n)$**\n\nLet the set of $n$ distinct professions be denoted by $P$, where the size of the set is $|P| = n$. A communication channel is defined for each unordered pair of professions. The total number of channels, $C(n)$, is therefore the number of ways to choose $2$ distinct elements from the set $P$, which is equivalent to finding the number of $2$-element subsets of $P$.\n\nAs per the instruction to use first principles, we will derive this quantity without invoking the binomial coefficient formula directly.\n\nConsider the process of forming an *ordered* pair of two distinct professions, $(p_i, p_j)$, where $p_i, p_j \\in P$ and $p_i \\neq p_j$.\nThere are $n$ choices for the first profession in the pair.\nSince the second profession must be distinct from the first, there are $n-1$ choices remaining for the second profession.\nBy the fundamental principle of counting, the total number of such ordered pairs is the product of the number of choices for each position:\n$$\n\\text{Number of ordered pairs} = n(n-1)\n$$\nHowever, the problem specifies that communication channels are for \"unordered pairs\", and they are \"bidirectional\". This means the channel connecting profession $p_i$ to $p_j$ is identical to the channel connecting $p_j$ to $p_i$. In combinatorial terms, the unordered pair $\\{p_i, p_j\\}$ represents a single channel.\n\nEach unique unordered pair of distinct professions, $\\{p_i, p_j\\}$, gives rise to exactly two ordered pairs: $(p_i, p_j)$ and $(p_j, p_i)$. Therefore, to find the number of unordered pairs, we must divide the total number of ordered pairs by the number of permutations of a $2$-element set, which is $2! = 2$.\n\nThe expression for the dyadic channel count $C(n)$ is thus:\n$$\nC(n) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the number of edges in a complete graph with $n$ vertices, which correctly models a fully connected network of $n$ entities.\n\n**Evaluation of $C(5)$ and $C(10)$**\n\nUsing the derived expression, we evaluate the number of channels for team sizes of $n=5$ and $n=10$.\n\nFor a team of $n=5$ professions:\n$$\nC(5) = \\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n$$\nThere are $10$ required communication channels.\n\nFor a team of $n=10$ professions:\n$$\nC(10) = \\frac{10(10-1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n$$\nThere are $45$ required communication channels.\n\n**Computation of the Amplification Factor $R$**\n\nThe amplification factor $R$ is defined as the ratio of the channel count for the larger team to that of the smaller team:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C(10)}{C(5)}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nR = \\frac{45}{10} = 4.5\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of $R$**\n\nThe value $R=4.5$ represents the multiplicative factor by which the coordination complexity increases when the team size is doubled from $n=5$ to $n=10$. A $2$-fold increase in team size leads to a $4.5$-fold increase in the number of required communication links. This demonstrates the principle of non-linear scaling of communication overhead in growing teams; the burden of maintaining coordination does not grow in direct proportion to the number of members but rather quadratically. Leadership must therefore anticipate that a modest increase in team personnel will demand a disproportionately larger investment in resources for communication and conflict resolution.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer for $R$ to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $4.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $4.500$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.500}\n$$", "id": "4397287"}, {"introduction": "Beyond managing communication, high-performing teams build robust processes to catch errors before they can cause harm. A cornerstone of safety science is the principle of redundancy, which in healthcare often takes the form of independent 'double-checks' for critical tasks. This practice [@problem_id:4397291] uses fundamental probability theory to quantify the powerful effect of such a system, demonstrating how adding just one independent verification step can dramatically reduce the overall probability of failure.", "problem": "A hospital unit leader implements a structured conflict resolution and leadership intervention that standardizes how medication orders are verified.

It provides all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution based on established principles of probability theory. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation for the new system failure probability, $p'$, and the computation of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). We will address these in order.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events and probabilities based on the givens.\nThe original process has a single verification step. The probability that this single step fails to catch a medication-order error is given as $p$.\nLet $F$ be the event that a single verification step fails. The problem states:\n$$P(F) = p = 0.07$$\n\nThe new process consists of $2$ independent verification steps. Let $F_1$ be the event that the first verification step fails to catch an error, and let $F_2$ be the event that the second verification step fails to catch an error. Since each step is functionally equivalent to the original single step, their individual failure probabilities are the same:\n$$P(F_1) = p = 0.07$$\n$$P(F_2) = p = 0.07$$\n\nThe problem states that these two verification steps are independent. By the definition of independence, the probability that two independent events both occur is the product of their individual probabilities. The new system fails to catch an error only if *both* the first step and the second step fail. This corresponds to the intersection of events $F_1$ and $F_2$. The new system failure probability, denoted by $p'$, is therefore:\n$$p' = P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$$\nApplying the multiplication rule for independent events:\n$$p' = P(F_1) \\times P(F_2) = p \\times p = p^2$$\nThis is the derived expression for the new probability that the system fails to catch an error.\n\nNext, we are asked to define and compute the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The problem defines ARR as the difference between the original single-step failure probability, $p$, and the new two-step failure probability, $p'$.\nLet $ARR$ denote the absolute risk reduction. Following the provided definition:\n$$ARR = p - p'$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $p'$ into this definition, we obtain the ARR in terms of $p$:\n$$ARR = p - p^2$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for the ARR using the given value $p = 0.07$.\nFirst, we calculate the new failure probability, $p'$:\n$$p' = p^2 = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049$$\nNext, we calculate the ARR:\n$$ARR = p - p' = 0.07 - 0.0049 = 0.0651$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

A culture of psychological safety is critical for encouraging team members to 'speak up' about latent safety threats, an act that involves a personal cost-benefit analysis.

Consider a single decision episode in which a team member contemplates speaking up about a suspected medication error. Let the latent safety threat be present with probability $p$. If the threat is present and the team member speaks up, the action averts harm and yields a patient-centered benefit of magnitude $B$ measured on a cardinal utility scale that is commensurate across harms and social costs. Speaking up also imposes a social-psychological cost $C$ on the speaker (for example, time, stress, or potential friction), which is incurred regardless of whether the threat is actually present. Assume that remaining silent has zero expected net benefit on the same scale.\n\nStarting from the definition of expected value and a rational choice rule that selects the action with nonnegative expected net benefit, derive the decision threshold for the speaking-up action as a condition on the probability $p$. Then, given $B=2.35$ and $C=0.412$ (in the same utility units), solve for the minimum value of $p$ that makes speaking up weakly preferable to remaining silent.

It then asks for the calculation of this threshold for specific values of benefit and cost.\n\nFirst, let us validate the problem statement.\nThe problem is well-defined and rooted in the established principles of decision theory, specifically the concept of expected utility. The scenario described—a cost-benefit analysis of speaking up in a clinical setting—is a standard application in health systems science and studies on High Reliability Organizations (HROs). The givens are:\n- The probability of a latent safety threat being present: $p$.\n- The benefit of averting harm if the threat is present and the team member speaks up: $B$.\n- The social-psychological cost of speaking up, incurred regardless of the threat's presence: $C$.\n- The expected net benefit of remaining silent is defined as $0$.\n- A rational agent chooses an action if its expected net benefit is nonnegative, and in a comparative scenario, chooses the action with the higher expected utility. Specifically, the action \"speak up\" is weakly preferable if its expected utility is greater than or equal to that of \"remain silent\".\n- The specific values provided for calculation are $B = 2.35$ and $C = 0.412$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information without contradiction. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. We will formulate the expected net benefit (or expected utility, $E[U]$) for the action of speaking up. There are two mutually exclusive states of the world: the threat is present (with probability $p$) or the threat is not present (with probability $1-p$).\n\n1.  If the threat is present, speaking up yields a benefit $B$ but incurs a cost $C$. The net utility is $B - C$.\n2.  If the threat is not present, speaking up yields no benefit but still incurs the cost $C$. The net utility is $0 - C = -C$.\n\nThe expected utility of speaking up, denoted as $E[U_{\\text{speak up}}]$, is the sum of the utilities of each outcome weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$\nE[U_{\\text{speak up}}] = p(B - C) + (1-p)(-C)\n$$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$$\nE[U_{\\text{speak up}}] = pB - pC - C + pC\n$$\n$$\nE[U_{\\text{speak up}}] = pB - C\n$$\nThe problem states that the expected net benefit of remaining silent is zero. Let us denote this as:\n$$\nE[U_{\\text{remain silent}}] = 0\n$$\nAccording to the rational choice rule, the team member should choose to speak up if this action is weakly preferable to remaining silent. This means the expected utility of speaking up must be greater than or equal to the expected utility of remaining silent.\n$$\nE[U_{\\text{speak up}}] \\ge E[U_{\\text{remain silent}}]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected utilities:\n$$\npB - C \\ge 0\n$$\nTo find the decision threshold for the probability $p$, we solve this inequality for $p$.\n$$\npB \\ge C\n$$\nAssuming that the benefit $B$ is a positive quantity ($B>0$), which is logically necessary for it to be a \"benefit\", we can divide both sides by $B$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\np \\ge \\frac{C}{B}\n$$\nThis inequality represents the decision threshold. It states that for speaking up to be the rational choice, the probability of the threat being present must be at least the ratio of the cost of speaking up to the benefit of averting the threat.\n\nThe problem then asks for the minimum value of $p$ that makes speaking up weakly preferable.
