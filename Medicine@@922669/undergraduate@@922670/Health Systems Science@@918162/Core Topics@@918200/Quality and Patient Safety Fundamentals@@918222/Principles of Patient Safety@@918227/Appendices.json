The ordered dose is given as a rate per unit of body mass. Therefore, the total mass of the drug is the product of the patient's body mass and the ordered dose rate.\n\nLet $m_{patient}$ be the mass of the patient and $D_{rate}$ be the dose rate.\n$$ M_{drug} = m_{patient} \\times D_{rate} $$\nTo verify the dimensional consistency of this step, we analyze the units:\n$$ [\\text{Mass of drug}] = [\\text{Mass of patient}] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Mass of drug}}{\\text{Mass of patient}} \\right] $$\nSubstituting the given units:\n$$ [\\text{mg}] = [\\text{kg}] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\right] $$\nThe units are consistent, yielding a result in milligrams ($mg$), which is a unit of mass.\n\nNext, we determine the volume of the solution, $V$, that contains the required mass of the drug, $M_{drug}$. The medication is supplied as a solution with a known concentration, $C$, defined as mass of drug per unit volume of solution.\n\nTo find the volume needed, we divide the total mass of the drug by the concentration of the solution.\n$$ V = \\frac{M_{drug}}{C} $$\nAgain, we perform a dimensional analysis to verify the expression:\n$$ [\\text{Volume}] = \\frac{[\\text{Mass of drug}]}{\\left[ \\frac{\\text{Mass of drug}}{\\text{Volume of solution}} \\right]} = [\\text{Mass of drug}] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Volume of solution}}{\\text{Mass of drug}} \\right] $$\nSubstituting the given units:\n$$ [\\text{mL}] = \\frac{[\\text{mg}]}{\\left[ \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\right]} = [\\text{mg}] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{mg}} \\right] $$\nThe units are consistent, yielding a result in milliliters ($mL$), which is a unit of volume, as required.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $M_{drug}$ into the equation for $V$, we derive the general expression for the volume to administer based on the initial givens:\n$$ V = \\frac{m_{patient} \\times D_{rate}}{C} $$\nThis is the formal expression derived from the foundational principles described.\n\nNow, we compute the exact numeric volume for this patient by substituting the provided values into the derived expression:\n- $m_{patient} = 15$ kg\n- $D_{rate} = 0.1$ mg/kg\n- $C = 1$ mg/mL\n\nFirst, calculate the total mass of the drug:\n$$ M_{drug} = 15 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} = 1.5 \\text{ mg} $$\nNext, calculate the volume to administer:\n$$ V = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}} = 1.5 \\text{ mL} $$\nThe calculation is exact and does not require rounding.

The condition is $RPN'_C  192$.\n\nWe analyze the three possible cases of increasing a single score for mode C.\n\nCase 1: Increase Severity ($S_C$) by an integer amount $\\Delta_S$.\nThe new severity score is $S'_C = S_C + \\Delta_S = 7 + \\Delta_S$.\nThe score must not exceed $10$, so $7 + \\Delta_S \\le 10$, which implies $\\Delta_S \\le 3$.\nThe new $RPN$ is $RPN'_C = (7 + \\Delta_S) \\times 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\times (7 + \\Delta_S)$.\nWe require $15 \\times (7 + \\Delta_S)  192$.\n$7 + \\Delta_S  \\frac{192}{15} = \\frac{64}{5} = 12.8$.\n$\\Delta_S  12.8 - 7 = 5.8$.\nThe smallest integer $\\Delta_S$ satisfying this is $6$.

We will proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient experiences a true clinical deterioration. Let $D^c$ be the complementary event that a patient does not experience such a deterioration. Let $A$ be the event that the bedside alarm triggers an alert.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we will formalize using the language of probability:\n\n1.  The proportion of patients who experience a true deterioration event is the prevalence of the condition.\n    $$P(D) = 0.05$$\n    The proportion of patients who do not experience a true event is therefore:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\n\n2.  The probability that the alarm correctly identifies a true event is the sensitivity of the alarm. This is the conditional probability of the alarm triggering ($A$) given that a deterioration event has occurred ($D$).\n    $$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(A | D) = 0.9$$\n\n3.  The probability that the alarm correctly identifies a non-event is the specificity of the alarm. This is the conditional probability of the alarm not triggering ($A^c$) given that no deterioration event has occurred ($D^c$).\n    $$\\text{Specificity} = P(A^c | D^c) = 0.8$$\n    From this, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of the alarm triggering ($A$) given that no deterioration event has occurred ($D^c$).\n    $$P(A | D^c) = 1 - P(A^c | D^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient truly has the condition (a deterioration event, $D$) given that the test is positive (the alarm triggers, $A$). In formal terms, we must find $P(D | A)$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D | A) = \\frac{P(D \\cap A)}{P(A)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap A)$, is the probability of a true positive: the joint probability that a patient has a deterioration event *and* the alarm triggers. We can express this using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\cap A) = P(A | D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(A)$, is the total probability that the alarm triggers. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the alarm triggers for a patient with a true event) or a false positive (the alarm triggers for a patient with no event). We can express $P(A)$ using the law of total probability, summing over the partition of the sample space by $\\{D, D^c\\}$:\n$$P(A) = P(A \\cap D) + P(A \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$P(A) = P(A | D) P(D) + P(A | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(D | A)$, we derive the expression for the PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | A) = \\frac{P(A | D) P(D)}{P(A | D) P(D) + P(A | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis expression for PPV is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.

A PPV of $0.1915$ signifies that for every alarm that triggers, the probability of it being a true deterioration event is only approximately $19\\%$. Conversely, the probability of the alarm being a false positive is $1 - 0.1915 = 0.8085$, or approximately $81\\%$. This means that roughly four out of every five alarms are false.\n\nThis high false alarm rate has serious implications for patient safety:\n1.  **Alarm Fatigue**: A constant stream of non-actionable alarms desensitizes clinical staff. Nurses and doctors may begin to ignore, delay their response to, or even deactivate the alarms. This learned behavior defeats the purpose of the warning system and creates a significant risk that a true event will be missed, leading to patient harm or death.\n2.  **Misallocation of Clinical Resources and Iatrogenic Harm**: Each alarm, whether true or false, requires staff to stop their current task and investigate. A high false alarm rate leads to a substantial waste of valuable clinical time and effort, diverting attention from other patient care duties. Furthermore, responding to a false alarm may trigger a cascade of unnecessary diagnostic tests (e.g., blood draws, ECGs, radiographs) and consultations, which not only are costly but also expose the patient to potential iatrogenic harm (e.g., from radiation exposure or complications from procedures) with no clinical benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the alarm's high sensitivity ($90\\%$), its moderate specificity ($80\\%$) is insufficient to overcome the low prevalence ($5\\%$) of the target event. The resulting low PPV ($19.15\\%$) indicates that the alarm would generate an overwhelmingly high number of false positives. Such a system is not likely to be clinically useful and may, paradoxically, decrease patient safety due to alarm fatigue and the consequences of unnecessary clinical responses.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1915}\n$$", "id": "4391580"}]}
