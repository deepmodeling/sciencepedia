The denominator is defined from first principles as follows: the measurement year is $2024$; a member is age-eligible if the date of the second birthday occurs within $2024$ (that is, between January $1$, $2024$ and December $31$, $2024$, inclusive). For each product line, the member must be continuously enrolled in that same product line from the date of birth through the date of the second birthday (inclusive), where total accumulated gaps in coverage for that product line across the window are allowed up to $45$ days. Any period not covered by the specified product line (including enrollment in a different product line) is counted as uncovered time (a gap) for that product line. The plan constructs product-line-specific denominators; here, focus on the Commercial product line only. Stratify age eligibility into calendar-quarter strata by the calendar quarter of the second birthday: Q1 for January $1$–March $31$, Q2 for April $1$–June $30$, Q3 for July $1$–September $30$, Q4 for October $1$–December $31$ of $2024$.\n\nYou are given a synthetic member file for $15$ members.

It provides a standard biostatistical task based on established principles (binomial proportions, confidence intervals) with all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for four quantities related to a health plan's performance on a quality measure. The given data are:\n- The total number of eligible members, which is the denominator or sample size: $n = 10,000$.\n- The number of members who met the clinical criterion, which is the numerator or number of successes: $x = 7,200$.\n- A performance benchmark: $b = 0.75$.\n- The confidence level for the interval is $95\\%$, which corresponds to a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe underlying probabilistic model is that the number of successes $X$ follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$, where $p$ is the true, unknown proportion of members meeting the criterion in the population from which the sample is drawn.\n\nFirst, we compute the observed rate, or sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$.\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{7,200}{10,000} = 0.72\n$$\n\nSecond, we quantify the comparison to the benchmark by computing the difference $d$.\n$$\nd = \\hat{p} - b = 0.72 - 0.75 = -0.03\n$$\n\nThird, we construct the $95\\%$ Wilson score confidence interval for the true proportion $p$.
