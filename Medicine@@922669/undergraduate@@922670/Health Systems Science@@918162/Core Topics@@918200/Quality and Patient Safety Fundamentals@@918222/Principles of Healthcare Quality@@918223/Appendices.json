It is a standard application of Statistical Process Control (SPC), a core topic in quality engineering and statistics. The premises are scientifically grounded in statistical theory (binomial distribution, Central Limit Theorem). The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary information to compute a unique, meaningful answer. The language is objective and uses standard terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the p-Chart Control Limits**\n\nLet $X_i$ be the number of defects found in a subgroup of size $n$. Under the assumption that the probability of a defect, $p$, is constant and items are independent, $X_i$ follows a binomial distribution, $X_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$.\n\nThe mean and variance of $X_i$ are:\n$$E[X_i] = np$$\n$$\\text{Var}(X_i) = np(1-p)$$\n\nThe statistic plotted on a $p$-chart is the sample proportion of defects, $\\hat{p}_i = \\frac{X_i}{n}$. The expected value and variance of this sample proportion are:\n$$E[\\hat{p}_i] = E\\left[\\frac{X_i}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}E[X_i] = \\frac{1}{n}(np) = p$$\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_i) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{X_i}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\text{Var}(X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(np(1-p)) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$\nThe standard deviation of the sample proportion is therefore $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.\n\nFor a large subgroup size $n$ (typically when $np \\ge 5$ and $n(1-p) \\ge 5$), the Central Limit Theorem allows the binomial distribution to be approximated by a normal distribution. Thus, the distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}_i$ is approximately normal:\n$$\\hat{p}_i \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)$$\n\nIn SPC, the true process proportion $p$ is unknown and is estimated from data collected during a stable (in-control) period. The problem provides this estimate as the baseline average defect proportion, $\\bar{p}$. We use $\\bar{p}$ as the center line (CL) for the control chart and to estimate the standard deviation of $\\hat{p}_i$.\n$$\\text{CL} = \\bar{p}$$\nThe estimated standard deviation of the sample proportion is:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}$$\nThe Shewhart $3\\sigma$ control limits are defined as the center line plus or minus $3$ times this estimated standard deviation.\nUpper Control Limit (UCL):\n$$\\text{UCL}_p = \\bar{p} + 3\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}$$\nLower Control Limit (LCL):\n$$\\text{LCL}_p = \\bar{p} - 3\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}$$\nSince a proportion cannot be negative, the lower control limit is set to $0$ if the calculation yields a negative value.

The observed defect proportion for the subsequent week is $p_{\\text{obs}}=0.14$.\nComparing the observed value to the limits:\n$$p_{\\text{obs}} = 0.14 > \\text{UCL}_p \\approx 0.13755$$\nSince the observed point falls outside the upper control limit, it signals the presence of special-cause variation. The process is not in a state of statistical control.\n\n**Calculation of the Standardized Deviation (z-score)**\n\nThe final task is to compute the standardized deviation ($z$-score) of the observation $p_{\\text{obs}}$ relative to the baseline process. The $z$-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.\nThe formula is:\n$$z = \\frac{\\text{observation} - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{obs}} - \\bar{p}}{\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{p}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$z = \\frac{0.14 - 0.08}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.08(1-0.08)}{200}}} = \\frac{0.06}{\\sqrt{0.000368}}$$\n$$z \\approx \\frac{0.06}{0.019183326} \\approx 3.127699$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $3.128$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.128}$$", "id": "4390759"}, {"introduction": "When a new quality improvement initiative is implemented, how can we be sure it was the cause of any observed improvements? Simply comparing outcomes 'before and after' can be misleading, as other factors may also change over time.

It presents a well-posed question in the field of quantitative health services research, a discipline that combines principles of statistics, epidemiology, and health systems science. The problem is scientifically grounded in the potential outcomes framework for causal inference and uses a standard quasi-experimental design, the difference-in-differences (DiD) method. All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and the problem is free from ambiguity, contradiction, or scientific error.\n\nWe are tasked with estimating the causal effect of a quality improvement initiative on the absolute probability of hospital readmission. We will use the difference-in-differences framework grounded in potential outcomes.\n\nLet us define the necessary notation.\nLet $G$ be an indicator variable for the group, where $G=1$ for the intervention group and $G=0$ for the control group.\nLet $T$ be an indicator variable for the time period, where $T=1$ for the post-intervention period and $T=0$ for the pre-intervention period.\nLet $Y$ be the outcome of interest, which is the mean readmission probability (or rate).\nThe observed mean outcome for group $G$ in period $T$ is denoted by $E[Y|G, T]$.\n\nThe provided data can be summarized as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Mean readmission rate for the intervention group in the pre-period: $E[Y|G=1, T=0] = 0.12$\n    \\item Mean readmission rate for the intervention group in the post-period: $E[Y|G=1, T=1] = 0.09$\n    \\item Mean readmission rate for the control group in the pre-period: $E[Y|G=0, T=0] = 0.10$\n    \\item Mean readmission rate for the control group in the post-period: $E[Y|G=0, T=1] = 0.09$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe causal effect we wish to estimate is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), which represents the effect of the initiative on the intervention group in the post-intervention period. Within the potential outcomes framework, we define $Y_1(1)$ as the potential outcome for the intervention group had they received the intervention (which they did), and $Y_1(0)$ as the potential outcome for the intervention group had they *not* received the intervention (the counterfactual). Both outcomes are considered in the post-period ($T=1$).\n\nThe ATT is the difference between the expected value of these two potential outcomes for the intervention group ($G=1$):\n$$ \\text{ATT} = E[Y_1(1) | G=1] - E[Y_1(0) | G=1] $$\nThe first term, $E[Y_1(1) | G=1]$, is the factual outcome. It is what we observe for the intervention group in the post-period.\n$$ E[Y_1(1) | G=1] = E[Y | G=1, T=1] = 0.09 $$\nThe second term, $E[Y_1(0) | G=1]$, is the counterfactual outcome. It represents what the readmission rate for the intervention group would have been in the post-period if they had not implemented the initiative. This term is unobservable and must be estimated.\n\nTo estimate the counterfactual, we invoke the key **parallel trends assumption**. This assumption states that the change in the outcome for the control group reflects the change that the intervention group would have experienced in the absence of the intervention. Mathematically, the trend in untreated potential outcomes is the same for both groups:\n$$ E[Y_1(0) - Y_0(0) | G=1] = E[Y_1(0) - Y_0(0) | G=0] $$\nHere, $Y_t(0)$ is the potential outcome in period $t$ without the intervention.\nFor the control group ($G=0$), they are never treated, so their observed outcomes are their untreated potential outcomes: $Y_t(0)|_{G=0} = Y_t|_{G=0}$. Thus, the right-hand side of the parallel trends assumption is the observed change in the control group:\n$$ E[Y_1(0) - Y_0(0) | G=0] = E[Y|G=0, T=1] - E[Y|G=0, T=0] $$\nFor the intervention group ($G=1$), their pre-period outcome is also an untreated outcome: $Y_0(0)|_{G=1} = Y_0|_{G=1}$. We can now rearrange the parallel trends assumption to solve for the unobserved counterfactual:\n$$ E[Y_1(0) | G=1] = E[Y_0(0) | G=1] + \\left( E[Y_1(0) | G=0] - E[Y_0(0) | G=0] \\right) $$\nSubstituting the observable quantities:\n$$ E[Y_1(0) | G=1] = E[Y|G=1, T=0] + \\left( E[Y|G=0, T=1] - E[Y|G=0, T=0] \\right) $$\nThis expression states that the counterfactual for the intervention group is their own baseline outcome plus the secular trend observed in the control group.\n\nNow we substitute this expression for the counterfactual back into the ATT formula:\n$$ \\text{ATT} = E[Y|G=1, T=1] - \\left[ E[Y|G=1, T=0] + \\left( E[Y|G=0, T=1] - E[Y|G=0, T=0] \\right) \\right] $$\nRearranging the terms gives the difference-in-differences estimator:\n$$ \\text{ATT}_{\\text{DiD}} = \\left( E[Y|G=1, T=1] - E[Y|G=1, T=0] \\right) - \\left( E[Y|G=0, T=1] - E[Y|G=0, T=0] \\right) $$\nThis is the difference in the \"pre-post\" change for the intervention group and the \"pre-post\" change for the control group.\n\nWe can now compute the value using the given data.\nFirst, calculate the change over time for the intervention group:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{Intervention}} = E[Y|G=1, T=1] - E[Y|G=1, T=0] = 0.09 - 0.12 = -0.03 $$\nNext, calculate the change over time for the control group. This represents the secular trend that would have affected both groups in the absence of the intervention:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{Control}} = E[Y|G=0, T=1] - E[Y|G=0, T=0] = 0.09 - 0.10 = -0.01 $$\nThe difference-in-differences estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$ \\text{ATT}_{\\text{DiD}} = \\Delta_{\\text{Intervention}} - \\Delta_{\\text{Control}} = (-0.03) - (-0.01) = -0.03 + 0.01 = -0.02 $$\nThe numerical estimate of the causal effect is $-0.02$.\n\nThe final step is to interpret this causal contrast in words.\nThe observed readmission rate in the intervention hospitals decreased by $3$ percentage points (from $12\\%$ to $9\\%$). However, not all of this improvement can be attributed to the initiative. During the same period, the readmission rate in the control hospitals also decreased by $1$ percentage point (from $10\\%$ to $9\\%$). This suggests a general secular trend of improving readmission rates, independent of the initiative. The difference-in-differences method assumes this $1$ percentage point improvement would also have occurred in the intervention hospitals even without the initiative. By subtracting this secular trend from the total observed change in the intervention group, we isolate the effect of the initiative itself. The resulting estimate of $-0.02$ means that the quality improvement initiative caused the absolute readmission probability in the intervention hospitals to decrease by $2$ percentage points, beyond any general trends affecting all hospitals.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.02} $$", "id": "4390741"}, {"introduction": "Proving an intervention is effective is only half the battle; in a world of limited resources, we must also ask if it provides good value.
