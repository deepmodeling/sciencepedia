Consider the following three cases and the generalized statements offered by the quality committee:\n\nCase $1$: A $55$-year-old patient receives cisplatin-based chemotherapy per protocol with appropriate prehydration, magnesium supplementation, and dosing according to institutional guidelines. Informed consent documents the known risk of nephrotoxicity. Despite full adherence to protocol, the patient develops a rise in serum creatinine from $0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ after cycle $1$, consistent with cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

Before evaluating the given statements, we must first establish the precise definitions of the key terms and apply them to the three cases presented.\n\n### Foundational Definitions\n\n1.  **Iatrogenic Injury**: This term refers to any harm to a patient that results from medical diagnosis or treatment, rather than the patient's underlying disease. The origin of the term is from the Greek *iatros* (healer) and *genesis* (origin). An iatrogenic injury does not, by itself, imply that a mistake or error was made.\n\n2.  **Medical Error**: According to the Institute of Medicine, a medical error is the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (an error of execution) or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (an error of planning). An error may or may not result in harm.\n\n3.  **Adverse Event (AE)**: An injury resulting from a medical intervention. An adverse event is a form of iatrogenic injury. Adverse events can be further classified based on their relationship to error.\n\n4.  **Non-preventable Adverse Event**: An adverse event (harm) that occurs despite the correct application of the best-known medical practice. These are known complications of a therapy or procedure that are not attributable to an error.\n\n5.  **Preventable Adverse Event**: An adverse event (harm) that is the result of a medical error.\n\n6.  **Near Miss (or Close Call)**: An error that has the potential to cause an adverse event but does not result in harm, either due to chance or timely interception.\n\n### Analysis of Cases based on Definitions\n\n**Case 1 Analysis**:\nA patient receiving cisplatin chemotherapy develops nephrotoxicity, a known side effect. The case explicitly states that all protocols were followed correctly (\"No deviations from the care plan are identified\").\n-   **Harm**: Yes, the rise in serum creatinine from $0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ signifies kidney injury.\n-   **Cause**: The harm was caused by the medical treatment (cisplatin). Therefore, it is an **iatrogenic injury** and an **adverse event**.\n-   **Error**: No. The care was delivered according to standard, accepted protocols.\n-   **Classification**: This is a **non-preventable adverse event**. It is a known complication of a correctly administered therapy.\n\n**Case 2 Analysis**:\nA patient suffers severe harm (neutropenia, sepsis) after receiving a $30\\%$ overdose of a cytotoxic drug due to a miscalculation.\n-   **Harm**: Yes, grade $4$ neutropenia and sepsis requiring intensive care.\n-   **Cause**: The harm was caused by the overdose of a cytotoxic agent, a medical intervention. This is an **iatrogenic injury**.\n-   **Error**: Yes. \"A patient’s body surface area is miscalculated, resulting in a $30\\%$ overdose.\" This is a clear error of execution or planning.\n-   **Classification**: Because the harm was caused by an error, this is a **preventable adverse event**.\n\n**Case 3 Analysis**:\nA patient with a documented penicillin allergy receives penicillin and suffers anaphylaxis. This occurred because a nurse, under time pressure, skipped the allergy verification step.\n-   **Harm**: Yes, anaphylaxis.\n-   **Cause**: The harm was caused by the administration of penicillin, a medical intervention. This is an **iatrogenic injury**.\n-   **Error**: Yes, multiple errors occurred. A registration error led to a mismatched bracelet, and, more proximally, the nurse committed an error of omission by failing to perform the standard allergy verification.\n-   **Classification**: Because the harm was caused by an error, this is a **preventable adverse event**.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n**A. In Case $1$, the kidney injury meets the definition of iatrogenic injury and an adverse event but does not meet the definition of medical error; it should be documented through adverse event and pharmacovigilance reporting and monitored via quality improvement, without labeling it as an error unless a process deviation is identified.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This statement is perfectly aligned with our analysis of Case $1$. The kidney injury is an iatrogenic injury and an adverse event. Since no error occurred, it is a non-preventable adverse event. Reporting such events is critical for pharmacovigilance (monitoring drug safety) and quality improvement (tracking outcomes), while correctly *not* classifying it as an error is vital for a just culture.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In Case $1$, because nephrotoxicity was disclosed and consented, it is not iatrogenic and should not be reported at all.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This is incorrect on two counts. First, \"iatrogenic\" refers to the origin of the harm (medical treatment), irrespective of consent or foreseeability. The nephrotoxicity is unequivocally iatrogenic. Second, informed consent does not eliminate the need for reporting. Reporting all adverse events, whether preventable or not, is crucial for public health, pharmacovigilance, and quality assurance.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In Case $2$, the harm is both an iatrogenic injury and a medical error and is appropriately classified as a preventable adverse event; it should be reported in the institutional incident reporting system and reviewed for system and human factors contributing causes.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This statement is a precise application of patient safety principles to Case $2$. The harm is iatrogenic, and it was caused by an error, making the entire event a preventable adverse event. The proper response is to report it via the incident reporting system and conduct a root cause analysis to identify and mitigate underlying system and human factors to prevent recurrence.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In Case $3$, the anaphylaxis is not iatrogenic because the underlying disease required penicillin; therefore the event is a disease-related complication and should not be classified as error.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This statement is fundamentally flawed. The anaphylaxis was directly caused by the administration of penicillin (a medical intervention), making it iatrogenic. The claim that the disease \"required\" penicillin is highly questionable for a patient with a known allergy and does not change the classification. The event was due to a failure to follow safety procedures, which is a medical error. Therefore, it is a preventable adverse event, not a \"disease-related complication\".\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Iatrogenic injury and medical error are synonymous; any harm due to medical care automatically indicates an error.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This statement is a common misconception that is fundamentally false in health systems science. As demonstrated by Case $1$, iatrogenic harm can occur in the absence of any error. The distinction between iatrogenic injury (harm from treatment) and medical error (a mistake in process) is a central tenet of patient safety theory.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Near-misses without patient harm, such as catching the dose miscalculation before administration, are excluded from reporting frameworks in health systems science.**\n-   **Evaluation**: This statement is the opposite of modern patient safety practice. Near-miss reporting is strongly encouraged and is a cornerstone of a robust safety culture. Analyzing near misses allows systems to identify and correct weaknesses before they cause actual harm, providing \"free lessons\" in safety improvement.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4381485"}, {"introduction": "Once an adverse event is identified, the critical next question is whether it was preventable.

The omission was based on a misinterpretation of renal function; the estimated glomerular filtration rate was $70$ $\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$, platelet count was $200\\times 10^9/\\mathrm{L}$, and there was no active bleeding, neuraxial catheter, or other contraindication. At the time of care, an authoritative guideline recommended initiation of low-molecular-weight heparin within $12$ hours after hip arthroplasty for at least $10$ days. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in hip arthroplasty patients reported symptomatic venous thromboembolism rates of approximately $4\\%$ without pharmacologic prophylaxis and $1.5\\%$ with low-molecular-weight heparin, corresponding to a relative risk of $0.38$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of $0.24$ to $0.59$.

Preventability cannot be determined without patient-specific proof that this individual would not have had pulmonary embolism if low-molecular-weight heparin had been given; group-level RCT evidence and guidelines are insufficient, so the event should be classified as indeterminate and not reported as preventable.\n\nD. Any preventive step (e.g., sequential compression devices) fulfills the standard-of-care; because some prophylaxis was provided, the counterfactual test is satisfied and the event is nonpreventable, regardless of whether pharmacologic prophylaxis was omitted.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a realistic clinical scenario grounded in established medical and epidemiological principles, provides clear definitions, and is internally consistent and well-posed. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Counterfactual Test for Preventability\n\nThe problem provides the fundamental definitions required to construct a formal test for preventability. Let us analyze and synthesize these definitions.\n\n-   **Adverse Event (AE)**: An AE is defined as harm caused by medical management rather than the underlying disease. In this scenario, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism (PE), a serious form of harm. While the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an inherent complication of total hip arthroplasty (THA), the standard of care is designed to mitigate this risk. An occurrence of harm that guideline-concordant care is intended to reduce can be considered an adverse event related to medical management, especially when guideline-concordant care was omitted. Thus, the PE qualifies as an AE.\n\n-   **Preventable Adverse Event (PAE)**: A PAE is defined as an AE for which a feasible, guideline-concordant alternative process existed that would have materially reduced the probability of harm.\n\n-   **Causal Preventability**: This concept is defined as resting on a counterfactual comparison of the probability of harm under the actual versus an achievable alternative.\n\nLet $E$ denote the adverse event (the PE). Let $A$ denote the actual course of action (management with sequential compression devices (SCDs) only). Let $A^{\\star}$ denote the alternative course of action (management with SCDs plus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)). Based on the provided definitions, an adverse event $E$ that occurred under care process $A$ is classified as **preventable** if and only if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n1.  **Existence and Feasibility of an Alternative ($A^{\\star}$)**: There must have been an alternative care process, $A^{\\star}$, that was both clinically and logistically feasible at the time of care. Feasibility implies that there were no patient-specific contraindications to $A^{\\star}$ and that the necessary resources (e.g., medications, personnel, protocols) were available.\n\n2.  **Guideline Concordance of the Alternative**: The alternative process $A^{\\star}$ must be consistent with the recognized standard of care, typically established by authoritative clinical practice guidelines.\n\n3.  **Probabilistic Causal Efficacy**: There must be sufficient evidence that the alternative process $A^{\\star}$ would have \"materially reduced the probability of harm.\" This is a probabilistic, not a deterministic, criterion. The evidentiary standard for this requires:\n    a.  **High-Quality Evidence**: The claim must be supported by high-quality scientific evidence, such as meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which allow for robust estimation of event probabilities.\n    b.  **Probabilistic Superiority**: The evidence must show that the probability of the event given the alternative, $P(E \\mid A^{\\star})$, is less than the probability of the event given the actual care, $P(E \\mid A)$.\n    c.  **Statistical Significance**: The observed difference in probabilities must be statistically significant. A common criterion is that the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the relative risk ($RR = P(E \\mid A^{\\star}) / P(E \\mid A)$) must not include the null value of $1$. Specifically, for a beneficial intervention, the entire interval must be less than $1$.\n    d.  **Clinical Significance (\"Materiality\")**: The magnitude of the risk reduction must be clinically meaningful. This is often expressed as an absolute risk reduction, $ARR = P(E \\mid A) - P(E \\mid A^{\\star})$, that exceeds a certain threshold of clinical importance.\n\nThis formal test rejects both deterministic certainty (i.e., that $P(E \\mid A^{\\star})$ must be $0$) and the demand for individual-level proof (i.e., that one must prove *this specific patient* would have been unharmed). Instead, it relies on the same principles of evidence-based medicine used to make clinical decisions: applying probabilistic, group-level evidence to individual cases.\n\n### Step 2: Application of the Test to the Scenario\n\nWe apply the derived test to the provided clinical case.\n\n1.  **Existence and Feasibility of $A^{\\star}$**: The alternative, adding LMWH, existed. It was feasible.\n    -   **Patient-specific**: The problem explicitly states there were no contraindications. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was $70$ $\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$ (well above the typical threshold for dose adjustment or avoidance), platelet count was normal at $200\\times 10^9/\\mathrm{L}$, and there was no active bleeding or neuraxial catheter.\n    -   **System-specific**: The hospital had LMWH on formulary and the workflows to support its administration.\n\n2.  **Guideline Concordance of $A^{\\star}$**: The problem states an \"authoritative guideline recommended initiation of low-molecular-weight heparin within $12$ hours after hip arthroplasty.\" The alternative $A^{\\star}$ aligns with this standard; the actual care $A$ was a deviation from it, based on an error (\"misinterpretation of renal function\").\n\n3.  **Probabilistic Causal Efficacy**:\n    a.  **High-Quality Evidence**: The evidence is a \"meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,\" which represents a high level of evidence.\n    b.  **Probabilistic Superiority**: The evidence shows $P(E \\mid A) \\approx 4\\%$ and $P(E \\mid A^{\\star}) \\approx 1.5\\%$. Clearly, $1.5\\% < 4\\%$.\n    c.  **Statistical Significance**: The relative risk is $RR = 0.38$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of $0.24$ to $0.59$. Since the entire interval is below $1.0$, the risk reduction is statistically significant.\n    d.  **Clinical Significance**: The absolute risk reduction is $ARR = 4\\% - 1.5\\% = 2.5\\%$. A $2.5\\%$ reduction in a serious outcome like symptomatic VTE is widely considered a material and clinically important benefit. The number needed to treat to prevent one event is $1/ARR = 1/0.025 = 40$, which is a strong indicator of efficacy.\n\n**Conclusion**: All criteria of the counterfactual test for preventability are met. The omission of LMWH was an error that departed from a feasible, guideline-concordant standard of care, and high-quality evidence confirms this omission materially increased the probability of the harm that subsequently occurred. Therefore, the event is a preventable adverse event.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. An event is a preventable adverse event if there existed, at the time of care, a feasible, standard-of-care alternative action $A^{\\star}$ (e.g., guideline-concordant low-molecular-weight heparin) for which high-quality evidence shows that $P(E\\mid A^{\\star})$ is meaningfully lower than $P(E\\mid A)$ by a clinically important amount $\\Delta\\ge\\delta$ (e.g., absolute risk reduction of a few percentage points), with the lower bound of the $95\\%$ confidence interval indicating benefit, and there were no patient-specific contraindications. Because the omission was a documented deviation and the RCT meta-analysis shows $4\\%$ without versus $1.5\\%$ with prophylaxis, this event meets preventability and should be classified and reported as a preventable adverse event.**\nThis option correctly articulates the counterfactual test, incorporating the key elements of feasibility, standard of care, reliance on high-quality probabilistic evidence, and clinical/statistical significance. The phrasing regarding the confidence interval, while slightly imprecise (the upper bound is more critical for a relative risk), captures the correct intent of requiring robust evidence of benefit. The application to the case is also entirely correct. It correctly concludes the event is a preventable adverse event.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. An event is nonpreventable unless adherence to an alternative action would reduce $P(E\\mid A^{\\star})$ to $0$; because pulmonary embolism can still occur despite low-molecular-weight heparin, this event is a nonpreventable complication and should not be classified as preventable.**\nThis option proposes a standard of deterministic preventability ($P(E \\mid A^{\\star}) = 0$). This directly contradicts the problem's definition, which speaks of a \"reduced probability\" of harm. This standard is philosophically flawed and practically useless, as few medical interventions offer absolute guarantees.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Preventability cannot be determined without patient-specific proof that this individual would not have had pulmonary embolism if low-molecular-weight heparin had been given; group-level RCT evidence and guidelines are insufficient, so the event should be classified as indeterminate and not reported as preventable.**\nThis option demands an impossible standard of proof: certainty about an individual-level counterfactual. The entire framework of evidence-based medicine and public health, as well as the definitions of preventability provided, rests on the valid application of group-level, probabilistic evidence to individual cases. Rejecting this principle makes the concept of preventability moot.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Any preventive step (e.g., sequential compression devices) fulfills the standard-of-care; because some prophylaxis was provided, the counterfactual test is satisfied and the event is nonpreventable, regardless of whether pharmacologic prophylaxis was omitted.**\nThis option misconstrues the standard of care. The standard is not just \"do something,\" but \"do what is shown by evidence and recommended by guidelines to be effective.\" In this high-risk scenario, guidelines recommended pharmacologic prophylaxis (LMWH). Providing only mechanical prophylaxis was a deviation from the standard of care. The correct counterfactual comparison is between actual care (suboptimal) and guideline-concordant care (optimal), not between some care and no care.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4381536"}, {"introduction": "To manage and improve patient safety, we must be able to measure it.

Over a continuous $120$-day period in a $200$-licensed-bed hospital with an average occupancy of $75\\%$, trained reviewers classify events from the voluntary reporting system as follows: $56$ events are NCC MERP categories $E$ through $I$ (errors that reached the patient and caused temporary harm or worse), and $140$ events are NCC MERP categories $A$ through $D$ (circumstances or events that did not reach the patient or reached without harm). For the purpose of an outcome error rate, only categories $E$ through $I$ are considered numerator events.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to health systems science, use the core definitions that a rate is the ratio of counted events to exposure time and that rare, independent events occurring at a constant average hazard over time can be modeled as a Poisson process.

It presents a standard biostatistical task based on realistic data and established methodologies in health systems science. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of a medication error rate and its corresponding $95\\%$ confidence interval. The core of the problem rests on modeling the occurrence of rare events over a defined period of exposure using a Poisson distribution.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters based on the problem statement.\nLet $N$ be the observed number of events of interest. These are the medication errors corresponding to NCC MERP categories $E$ through $I$.\nFrom the problem, $N = 56$.\nLet $\\mathcal{T}$ be the total observation time in days. From the problem, $\\mathcal{T} = 120$ days.\nThe hospital has $B = 200$ licensed beds with an average occupancy rate of $\\rho = 75\\% = 0.75$.\n\nThe total exposure, which we will denote as $T_{exp}$, is measured in patient-days. It is the denominator for the rate calculation.\n$$ T_{exp} = (\\text{Number of beds}) \\times (\\text{Average occupancy}) \\times (\\text{Observation period}) $$\n$$ T_{exp} = B \\times \\rho \\times \\mathcal{T} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ T_{exp} = 200 \\times 0.75 \\times 120 = 150 \\times 120 = 18000 \\text{ patient-days} $$\n\nThe problem states that the count of events $N$ follows a Poisson distribution. Let $\\lambda$ be the true, constant underlying rate of events per patient-day. The expected number of events, $\\mu$, over the total exposure period $T_{exp}$ is given by:\n$$ \\mu = E[N] = \\lambda \\times T_{exp} $$\nThe distribution of the observed count is thus $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda T_{exp})$.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the Poisson parameter $\\mu$ is simply the observed count $N$. Therefore, an estimator for $\\mu$ is $\\hat{\\mu} = N$.\nFrom this, we can derive the estimator for the rate $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}}{T_{exp}} = \\frac{N}{T_{exp}} $$\nThe problem asks for the rate per $1{,}000$ patient-days, which we will denote as $\\lambda_{1000}$. The relationship is $\\lambda_{1000} = \\lambda \\times 1000$.\nThe estimator for this rate, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{1000}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda}_{1000} = \\hat{\\lambda} \\times 1000 = \\frac{N}{T_{exp}} \\times 1000 $$\n\nNext, we derive the large-sample $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\lambda_{1000}$. The problem specifies using a Poisson approximation, which for a \"large sample\" (i.e., a sufficiently large count $N$) implies the use of the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution. For large $\\mu$, the distribution of $N$ can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\mu$:\n$$ N \\approx \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\mu) $$\nThe standard error of the count $N$ is $\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(N)} = \\sqrt{\\mu}$, which is estimated by $\\sqrt{N}$.\nA two-sided $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for the expected count $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{\\mu} = [N - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{N}, N + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{N}] $$\nFor a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding standard normal quantile is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nThus, the $95\\%$ CI for $\\mu$ is:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{\\mu, 95\\%} \\approx [N - 1.96\\sqrt{N}, N + 1.96\\sqrt{N}] $$\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the rate per patient-day, $\\lambda = \\mu/T_{exp}$, we divide the bounds of the CI for $\\mu$ by $T_{exp}$. To obtain the CI for the rate per $1{,}000$ patient-days, $\\lambda_{1000}$, we further multiply by $1000$.\n$$ \\text{CI}_{\\lambda_{1000}, 95\\%} \\approx \\left[ \\left(\\frac{N - 1.96\\sqrt{N}}{T_{exp}}\\right) \\times 1000, \\left(\\frac{N + 1.96\\sqrt{N}}{T_{exp}}\\right) \\times 1000 \\right] $$\n\nThe key assumptions required for this derivation and calculation are:\n1.  **Poisson Process Assumptions**: The medication errors (categories $E-I$) occur independently of one another. The underlying average rate of errors per patient-day is constant throughout the $120$-day period and across the patient population. The probability of two or more errors occurring in an infinitesimally small interval of patient-time is negligible.\n2.  **Data Validity**: The number of events recorded in the voluntary reporting system, $N=56$, is an accurate count of events of this type. The provided hospital characteristics (bed count, occupancy) are accurate and stable over the observation period.\n3.  **Approximation Validity**: The number of observed events, $N=56$, is sufficiently large for the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution to be reasonably accurate for constructing the confidence interval. A common rule of thumb is $N > 20$, which is satisfied here.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations.\nGiven values:\n$N = 56$\n$T_{exp} = 18000$ patient-days\n\nThe estimated rate per $1{,}000$ patient-days is:\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda}_{1000} = \\frac{56}{18000} \\times 1000 = \\frac{56}{18} = \\frac{28}{9} \\approx 3.1111... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{1000} = 3.111$.\n\nFor the $95\\%$ confidence interval, we first calculate the margin of error term for the count:\n$z_{0.975}\\sqrt{N} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{56} \\approx 1.96 \\times 7.48331477 \\approx 14.66729695$\nThe $95\\%$ CI for the count $\\mu$ is approximately:\n$$ [56 - 14.667297, 56 + 14.667297] = [41.332703, 70.667297] $$\nNow, we convert this to a CI for the rate per $1{,}000$ patient-days:\nLower Bound:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{41.332703}{18000} \\times 1000 = \\frac{41.332703}{18} \\approx 2.296261 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the lower bound is $2.296$.\n\nUpper Bound:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{70.667297}{18000} \\times 1000 = \\frac{70.667297}{18} \\approx 3.925961 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the upper bound is $3.926$.\n\nThe point estimate for the medication administration error rate is $3.111$ events per $1{,}000$ patient-days, and the $95\\%$ confidence interval is approximately $[2.296, 3.926]$ events per $1{,}000$ patient-days.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four significant figures as requested, are the rate estimate, the lower confidence limit, and the upper confidence limit.\nRate: $3.111$\nLower CI limit: $2.296$\nUpper CI limit: $3.926$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3.111 & 2.296 & 3.926\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4381542"}]}
