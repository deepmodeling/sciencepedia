The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and posterior probability are standard components of Bayesian statistics as applied to medical diagnostics. All provided numerical values are within valid probability ranges ($0$ to $1$) and represent a realistic clinical scenario. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probabilities of a patient having the disease ($D$) given a positive test result ($+$) or a negative test result ($-$). These are denoted by $p(D\\mid +)$ and $p(D\\mid -)$, respectively. We will start from the core definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability to derive the results.\n\nThe givens are:\nPrevalence: $p(D) = 0.2$\nSensitivity: $p(+\\mid D) = 0.9$\nSpecificity: $p(-\\mid D^{c}) = 0.8$\n\nFrom the prevalence, we can determine the probability of the absence of disease, denoted by $D^c$:\n$$p(D^c) = 1 - p(D) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nThe test results are binary (positive or negative). Therefore, we can find the probabilities of the complementary events for sensitivity and specificity:\nThe false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present:\n$$p(-\\mid D) = 1 - p(+\\mid D) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent:\n$$p(+\\mid D^c) = 1 - p(-\\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nWe will now compute $p(D\\mid +)$, the positive predictive value.\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$p(D\\mid +) = \\frac{p(D \\cap +)}{p(+)}$$\nThe numerator, the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, can be rewritten using the definition of conditional probability as $p(D \\cap +) = p(+\\mid D)p(D)$.\nThe denominator, the total probability of a positive test, is found using the law of total probability by conditioning on the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$p(+) = p(+ \\cap D) + p(+ \\cap D^c) = p(+\\mid D)p(D) + p(+\\mid D^c)p(D^c)$$\nCombining these gives Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$p(D\\mid +) = \\frac{p(+\\mid D)p(D)}{p(+\\mid D)p(D) + p(+\\mid D^c)p(D^c)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$p(D\\mid +) = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.2}{(0.9 \\times 0.2) + (0.2 \\times 0.8)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} = \\frac{0.18}{0.34}$$\nExpressing this as an exact fraction:\n$$p(D\\mid +) = \\frac{18}{34} = \\frac{9}{17}$$\n\nNext, we compute $p(D\\mid -)$, the probability of disease given a negative test.\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$p(D\\mid -) = \\frac{p(D \\cap -)}{p(-)}$$\nThe numerator can be rewritten as $p(D \\cap -) = p(-\\mid D)p(D)$.\nThe denominator, the total probability of a negative test, is found using the law of total probability:\n$$p(-) = p(- \\cap D) + p(- \\cap D^c) = p(-\\mid D)p(D) + p(-\\mid D^c)p(D^c)$$\nAlternatively, since the test outcome is binary, $p(-) = 1 - p(+) = 1 - 0.34 = 0.66$.\nCombining these gives the corresponding form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$p(D\\mid -) = \\frac{p(-\\mid D)p(D)}{p(-\\mid D)p(D) + p(-\\mid D^c)p(D^c)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$p(D\\mid -) = \\frac{0.1 \\times 0.2}{(0.1 \\times 0.2) + (0.8 \\times 0.8)} = \\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} = \\frac{0.02}{0.66}$$\nExpressing this as an exact fraction:\n$$p(D\\mid -) = \\frac{2}{66} = \\frac{1}{33}$$\n\nFor clinical relevance, we compare these posterior probabilities to the given thresholds: the treatment threshold $\\tau_{\\mathrm{treat}}=0.3$ and the rule-out threshold $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ruleout}}=0.05$.\nThe prior probability of disease, $p(D)=0.2$, lies between these thresholds ($0.05  0.2  0.3$), indicating that a decision cannot be made without further information, warranting the test.\nAfter a positive test, the posterior probability is $p(D\\mid +) = \\frac{9}{17} \\approx 0.529$.

The foundational base for this problem consists of the following well-tested definitions and facts: propositional logic with conjunction and disjunction defined by truth-functional semantics, the closed-world assumption in knowledge-based systems (unspecified facts are treated as false), and a standard linear weighted aggregation of rule activations used in clinical decision support. Conjunction is defined such that for propositions $X$ and $Y$, the truth value $t(X \\land Y)$ equals $1$ if and only if $t(X) = 1$ and $t(Y) = 1$, otherwise $0$. Disjunction is defined such that $t(X \\lor Y) = 1$ if and only if $t(X) = 1$ or $t(Y) = 1$, otherwise $0$. Under closed-world assumption, any antecedent literal not present in the patient data is assigned $0$.\n\nConsider the following patient facts and rule base designed to detect renal and gastrointestinal risk associated with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). The patient has an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of $g = 45$ milliliters per minute per $1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$, is currently taking ibuprofen (an NSAID), and has no gastrointestinal (GI) bleed history. There is no active anticoagulant and no active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Encode these facts as Boolean propositions: $A$ denotes “active ibuprofen,” $H$ denotes “history of GI bleed,” $B$ denotes “active anticoagulant,” and $P$ denotes “active ACE inhibitor.” Numeric comparisons of $g$ against thresholds are treated as antecedent literals yielding $1$ if true and $0$ if false. The system’s three rules are:\n\n- Rule $R_1$: $A \\land (g  60) \\Rightarrow$ renal risk; weight $w_1 = 0.57$.\n- Rule $R_2$: $A \\land (H \\lor B) \\Rightarrow$ GI risk; weight $w_2 = 0.28$.\n- Rule $R_3$: $(g  30) \\lor (A \\land P) \\Rightarrow$ high-severity contraindication; weight $w_3 = 0.42$.\n\nThe alert severity score $S$ is computed by summing the products of each rule’s weight and its truth value, that is, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \\cdot t(R_i)$, where $t(R_i) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the truth value of rule $R_i$ obtained by evaluating its antecedent with the given patient facts.

It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions, facts, and rules necessary to compute a unique solution using established principles of propositional logic and weighted aggregation, which are standard in the field of clinical decision support systems.\n\nThe objective is to compute the alert severity score, $S$, for a given patient based on a set of rules and determine if an alert is triggered. The score is calculated using the formula $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \\cdot t(R_i)$, where $w_i$ is the weight of rule $R_i$ and $t(R_i)$ is the Boolean truth value ($1$ for true, $0$ for false) of its antecedent.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the patient's clinical data into truth values for the propositional literals defined in the problem. The patient data are:\n- Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, $g = 45$.\n- Active ibuprofen use, which corresponds to the proposition $A$.\n- No history of GI bleed, which corresponds to the proposition $H$.\n- No active anticoagulant, which corresponds to the proposition $B$.\n- No active ACE inhibitor, which corresponds to the proposition $P$.\n\nBased on these facts, we assign truth values to the propositions:\n- $t(A) = 1$ because the patient is taking ibuprofen.\n- $t(H) = 0$ because there is no history of GI bleed.\n- $t(B) = 0$ because there is no active anticoagulant.\n- $t(P) = 0$ because there is no active ACE inhibitor.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical comparison literals involving the patient's eGFR, $g = 45$:\n- The literal $(g  60)$ evaluates to $45  60$, which is true. Therefore, $t(g  60) = 1$.\n- The literal $(g  30)$ evaluates to $45  30$, which is false. Therefore, $t(g  30) = 0$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the antecedent of each rule to determine its truth value, $t(R_i)$.\n\nEvaluation of Rule $R_1$: The antecedent is $A \\land (g  60)$.\nThe truth value $t(R_1)$ is the truth value of the conjunction $t(A \\land (g  60))$.\nUsing the definition of conjunction, $t(X \\land Y)$ is $1$ if and only if $t(X)=1$ and $t(Y)=1$.\nWe have $t(A) = 1$ and $t(g  60) = 1$.\nThus, $t(R_1) = 1 \\land 1 = 1$. Rule $R_1$ is activated.\n\nEvaluation of Rule $R_2$: The antecedent is $A \\land (H \\lor B)$.\nThe truth value $t(R_2)$ is $t(A \\land (H \\lor B))$. We first evaluate the disjunction $(H \\lor B)$.\nUsing the definition of disjunction, $t(X \\lor Y)$ is $1$ if and only if $t(X)=1$ or $t(Y)=1$.\nWe have $t(H) = 0$ and $t(B) = 0$.\nThus, $t(H \\lor B) = 0 \\lor 0 = 0$.\nNow we evaluate the conjunction $A \\land (H \\lor B)$. We have $t(A) = 1$ and $t(H \\lor B) = 0$.\nThus, $t(R_2) = 1 \\land 0 = 0$. Rule $R_2$ is not activated.\n\nEvaluation of Rule $R_3$: The antecedent is $(g  30) \\lor (A \\land P)$.\nThe truth value $t(R_3)$ is $t((g  30) \\lor (A \\land P))$. We first evaluate the conjunction $(A \\land P)$.\nWe have $t(A) = 1$ and $t(P) = 0$.\nThus, $t(A \\land P) = 1 \\land 0 = 0$.\nNow we evaluate the disjunction $(g  30) \\lor (A \\land P)$. We have $t(g  30) = 0$ and $t(A \\land P) = 0$.\nThus, $t(R_3) = 0 \\lor 0 = 0$. Rule $R_3$ is not activated.\n\nWith the truth values for each rule's antecedent determined ($t(R_1) = 1$, $t(R_2) = 0$, $t(R_3) = 0$), we can now compute the alert severity score $S$. The rule weights are given as $w_1 = 0.57$, $w_2 = 0.28$, and $w_3 = 0.42$.\n$$ S = w_1 \\cdot t(R_1) + w_2 \\cdot t(R_2) + w_3 \\cdot t(R_3) $$\n$$ S = (0.57 \\cdot 1) + (0.28 \\cdot 0) + (0.42 \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ S = 0.57 + 0 + 0 $$\n$$ S = 0.57 $$\nThe alert threshold is given as $\\theta = 0.50$. The system fires an alert if $S \\ge \\theta$.\nSince $S = 0.57$, and $0.57 \\ge 0.50$, an alert is indeed generated.\n\nThe problem requires the final alert severity score $S$ to be expressed as a dimensionless real number rounded to $4$ significant figures.
