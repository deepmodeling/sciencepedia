Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)**\n\nThe $PPV$ is the probability that a lesion is truly malignant given that the classifier has returned a positive result, i.e., $P(M | T^+)$. We use Bayes' Theorem to express this:\n$$ PPV = P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We can expand it using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence (letting $p = P(M)$), we get:\n$$ P(T^+) = (Sens)(p) + (FPR)(1-p) = (Sens)(p) + (1 - Spec)(1-p) $$\nSubstituting this back into the Bayes' Theorem expression for $PPV$, we obtain the general formula:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c)} = \\frac{(Sens)(p)}{(Sens)(p) + (1 - Spec)(1 - p)} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $p = 0.10$, $Sens = 0.92$, and $Spec = 0.85$.\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.92)(0.10)}{(0.92)(0.10) + (1 - 0.85)(1 - 0.10)} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.092}{0.092 + (0.15)(0.90)} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.092}{0.092 + 0.135} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.092}{0.227} \\approx 0.40528634... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.4053 $$\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that a lesion is truly benign given that the classifier has returned a negative result, i.e., $P(M^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' Theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(M^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | M^c) P(M^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | M^c) P(M^c) + P(T^- | M) P(M) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ P(T^-) = (Spec)(1-p) + (FNR)(p) = (Spec)(1-p) + (1-Sens)(p) $$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' Theorem expression for $NPV$:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | M^c) P(M^c)}{P(T^- | M^c) P(M^c) + P(T^- | M) P(M)} = \\frac{(Spec)(1-p)}{(Spec)(1-p) + (1 - Sens)(p)} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $p = 0.10$, $Sens = 0.92$, and $Spec = 0.85$.\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.85)(1-0.10)}{(0.85)(1-0.10) + (1-0.92)(0.10)} $$\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.90)}{(0.85)(0.90) + (0.08)(0.10)} $$\n$$ NPV = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.008} $$\n$$ NPV = \\frac{0.765}{0.773} \\approx 0.98965071... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ NPV \\approx 0.9897 $$\n\n**3. Interpretation of Patient Safety Implications**\n\nThe calculated values of $PPV$ and $NPV$ have direct and significant implications for patient safety within the telehealth workflow.\n\nA **$PPV$ of $0.4053$** signifies that when the classifier flags a lesion as positive (suspicious for malignancy), there is a $40.53\\%$ chance that it is actually malignant. Conversely, there is a $1 - 0.4053 = 59.47\\%$ chance that it is a **false positive**.\n*   **Implication of False Positives**: From a patient safety perspective, a low $PPV$ is generally acceptable for a screening or triage tool. A positive result triggers an escalation in care, typically an in-person dermatology consult and potentially a biopsy. The high rate of false positives means a majority of these escalated cases ($~60\\%$) will be for benign lesions. This creates costs to the healthcare system (unnecessary appointments, procedures) and can cause significant patient anxiety. However, the harm from an unnecessary biopsy (e.g., minor pain, scarring) is considered far less severe than the harm from missing a true cancer. Therefore, the workflow correctly prioritizes not missing a malignancy over avoiding benign follow-ups.\n\nAn **$NPV$ of $0.9897$** signifies that when the classifier deems a lesion to be negative (benign), there is a $98.97\\%$ chance that it is indeed benign.\n*   **Implication of False Negatives**: A negative result in this workflow typically means the patient is reassured and advised on routine self-monitoring without immediate specialist referral. The high $NPV$ suggests this is a very reliable outcome. However, the probability of a **false negative** is $1 - NPV = 1 - 0.9897 = 0.0103$, or $1.03\\%$. This represents the most critical patient safety risk of the system: a patient with a true malignancy is incorrectly reassured and their diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Such a delay can lead to disease progression, increased morbidity, and potentially mortality. While the risk is small on a per-patient basis (approximately $1$ in every $97$ negative results will be incorrect), for a large population, this can represent a significant number of missed cancers. The high sensitivity ($0.92$) of the test is designed to minimize these events, but the risk is non-zero. Robust safety-netting protocols are essential to mitigate this risk, such as automated reminders for follow-up, clear instructions for patients to report any changes in the lesion, and potentially periodic re-evaluation even after a negative result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4053 & 0.9897 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4397556"}, {"introduction": "This practice puts you in the role of a practice manager to model the financial impact of adopting telehealth.
