This exercise is crucial for understanding how plans are designed and evaluated under the ACA framework [@problem_id:4398148].", "problem": "Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Actuarial Value (AV) of a health plan is defined as the expected fraction of total allowed costs for a defined standard population that the plan pays. Using only this definition and standard cost-sharing mechanics for deductibles, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket limits, compute the AV for the following plan and determine its metal tier under specified de minimis bands.\n\nPlan design and cost-sharing rules:\n- All covered essential health benefits (non-preventive) are subject to an annual deductible of $D = \\$2{,}000$, followed by a coinsurance rate of $r = 0.10$ for allowed spending above the deductible.\n- There is an annual out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM) of $M = \\$7{,}000$; once the member’s cumulative cost sharing reaches $M$, the plan pays all additional allowed costs for the remainder of the year.\n- Preventive services are excluded from consideration in this calculation. Assume all allowed costs described below are subject to the deductible and coinsurance and count toward the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nStandard population utilization distribution:\nLet annual allowed spending per member be the random variable $S$ that takes the following values with associated probabilities:\n- $S = \\$0$ with probability $0.15$,\n- $S = \\$500$ with probability $0.20$,\n- $S = \\$2{,}000$ with probability $0.25$,\n- $S = \\$5{,}000$ with probability $0.20$,\n- $S = \\$10{,}000$ with probability $0.10$,\n- $S = \\$40{,}000$ with probability $0.10$.\n\nUse the following classification bands to identify the metal tier; these bands include de minimis variation around the canonical $0.60$, $0.70$, $0.80$, and $0.90$ targets:\n- Bronze if $0.58 \\leq \\text{AV}  0.62$,\n- Silver if $0.68 \\leq \\text{AV}  0.72$,\n- Gold if $0.78 \\leq \\text{AV}  0.82$,\n- Platinum if $0.88 \\leq \\text{AV} \\leq 0.92$.\nIf $\\text{AV}$ falls outside all bands, treat the plan as not meeting any metal tier.\n\nTasks:\n1.

This will be accomplished in three main steps: first, deriving the plan's payment liability as a function of total allowed spending; second, calculating the expected plan liability and expected total spending for the given population distribution; and third, computing the AV and identifying the metal tier.\n\nThe plan's cost-sharing parameters are given as:\n- Annual deductible, $D = 2000$.\n- Coinsurance rate, $r = 0.10$.\n- Annual out-of-pocket maximum, $M = 7000$.\n\nLet $S$ be the random variable for annual allowed spending. The member's cost-sharing, denoted by $C(S)$, depends on the value of $S$. The plan's liability, $P(S)$, is the difference between the total allowed spending and the member's cost-sharing, i.e., $P(S) = S - C(S)$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the function for the member's cost-sharing, $C(S)$.\n1.  For spending at or below the deductible ($S \\le D$), the member pays the full amount.\n    $C(S) = S$, for $0 \\le S \\le 2000$.\n2.  For spending above the deductible ($S  D$), the member pays the full deductible $D$, plus a coinsurance amount of $r$ on the spending that exceeds $D$.\n    $C(S) = D + r(S - D)$, for $S  2000$.\n3.  This continues until the member's total cumulative cost-sharing reaches the out-of-pocket maximum, $M$. The member's cost-sharing includes payments towards the deductible and coinsurance. We must find the spending level, $S_{OOPM}$, at which this maximum is reached.\n    $C(S_{OOPM}) = M$\n    $D + r(S_{OOPM} - D) = M$\n    $r(S_{OOPM} - D) = M - D$\n    $S_{OOPM} = D + \\frac{M - D}{r}$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $S_{OOPM} = 2000 + \\frac{7000 - 2000}{0.10} = 2000 + \\frac{5000}{0.10} = 2000 + 50000 = 52000$.\n4.  For any spending above this level ($S  S_{OOPM}$), the member's liability is capped at $M$.\n    $C(S) = M$, for $S  52000$.\n\nCombining these pieces, the member's cost-sharing function is:\n$C(S) = \\begin{cases} S  \\text{if } 0 \\le S \\le 2000 \\\\ 2000 + 0.10(S - 2000)  \\text{if } 2000  S \\le 52000 \\\\ 7000  \\text{if } S  52000 \\end{cases}$\n\nThe plan's liability function, $P(S) = S - C(S)$, is therefore:\n$P(S) = \\begin{cases} S - S = 0  \\text{if } 0 \\le S \\le 2000 \\\\ S - [2000 + 0.10(S - 2000)]  \\text{if } 2000  S \\le 52000 \\\\ S - 7000  \\text{if } S  52000 \\end{cases}$\nSimplifying the middle expression:\n$P(S) = (1-r)(S-D) = (1-0.10)(S-2000) = 0.90(S-2000)$.\nSo, the plan's liability function is:\n$P(S) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } 0 \\le S \\le 2000 \\\\ 0.90(S - 2000)  \\text{if } 2000  S \\le 52000 \\\\ S - 7000  \\text{if } S  52000 \\end{cases}$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total allowed costs, $\\mathbb{E}[S]$, using the provided discrete probability distribution for $S$:\n$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\sum_{i} S_i \\cdot p(S_i)$\nThe given distribution is:\n- $S=0$ with probability $0.15$\n- $S=500$ with probability $0.20$\n- $S=2000$ with probability $0.25$\n- $S=5000$ with probability $0.20$\n- $S=10000$ with probability $0.10$\n- $S=40000$ with probability $0.10$\n\n$\\mathbb{E}[S] = (0 \\times 0.15) + (500 \\times 0.20) + (2000 \\times 0.25) + (5000 \\times 0.20) + (10000 \\times 0.10) + (40000 \\times 0.10)$\n$\\mathbb{E}[S] = 0 + 100 + 500 + 1000 + 1000 + 4000$\n$\\mathbb{E}[S] = 6600$\n\nNow, we calculate the expected plan liability, $\\mathbb{E}[P(S)]$.

There are $2$ risk types: low-risk ($L$) and high-risk ($H$). Let the population share of high-risk individuals be $s_H \\in (0,1)$ and the share of low-risk individuals be $s_L = 1 - s_H$. The expected annual medical expenditures (actuarial costs) are $c_L$ for $L$ and $c_H$ for $H$, with $c_H  c_L  0$.

A full pooling equilibrium is a state where both high-risk ($H$) and low-risk ($L$) individuals choose to purchase the insurance plan offered.\n\nFirst, we establish the conditions for this equilibrium. The market is defined by two types of individuals, low-risk and high-risk, with population shares $s_L = 1 - s_H$ and $s_H$, respectively. Their respective expected annual medical costs are $c_L$ and $c_H$, with $c_H  c_L  0$.\n\nThe insurer operates under a community rating system, setting a single premium, $P$, for all enrollees. This premium must satisfy the actuarial break-even condition, meaning it must equal the average expected cost of the individuals who enroll in the plan. In a full pooling equilibrium, the entire population enrolls. Therefore, the premium, which we can call the pooling premium $P_{pool}$, is the weighted average of the costs of the two risk types, where the weights are their shares in the population.\n\nThe pooling premium is calculated as:\n$$P_{pool} = s_L c_L + s_H c_H$$\nGiven that $s_L = 1 - s_H$, we can express the premium in terms of $s_H$, $c_L$, and $c_H$:\n$$P_{pool} = (1 - s_H) c_L + s_H c_H$$\n\nNext, we must consider the individual enrollment decision. An individual of type $i \\in \\{L, H\\}$ will enroll in the insurance plan if and only if the premium $P$ is less than or equal to their willingness to pay, $v_i$. That is, the condition for enrollment is $P \\le v_i$.\n\nFor a full pooling equilibrium to be sustained, both types must find it rational to enroll at the premium $P_{pool}$. This requires two conditions to be met simultaneously:\n$1$. For high-risk individuals: $P_{pool} \\le v_H$.\n$2$. For low-risk individuals: $P_{pool} \\le v_L$.\n\nLet us analyze the first condition for high-risk individuals. The problem states the assumption that $v_H \\ge c_H$. The pooling premium $P_{pool}$ is a convex combination of $c_L$ and $c_H$. Since $s_H \\in (0,1)$ and $c_L  c_H$, the premium must lie strictly between the two costs: $c_L  P_{pool}  c_H$.\nCombining this with the assumption about $v_H$, we have the relationship:\n$$P_{pool}  c_H \\le v_H$$\nThis implies that $P_{pool} \\le v_H$ is always satisfied. Thus, high-risk individuals will always enroll in the plan at the pooling premium, given the problem's setup.\n\nThe critical condition for the stability of the pooling equilibrium is therefore the second one, which concerns the low-risk individuals. The equilibrium is sustained if and only if low-risk individuals are willing to pay the pooling premium:\n$$P_{pool} \\le v_L$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{pool}$:\n$$(1 - s_H) c_L + s_H c_H \\le v_L$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal low-risk willingness to pay threshold, $\\hat{v}_L$, that allows the full pooling equilibrium to exist. This threshold represents the boundary case. If $v_L$ falls below this threshold, the inequality $P_{pool} \\le v_L$ would be violated, low-risk individuals would exit the market, the pool would \"unravel,\" and the pooling equilibrium would collapse. The minimal value for $v_L$ that satisfies the enrollment condition is the one that makes the condition hold with equality. Any value of $v_L$ at or above this threshold will sustain the equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the minimal threshold $\\hat{v}_L$ is equal to the pooling premium itself:\n$$\\hat{v}_L = P_{pool}$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $P_{pool}$, we obtain the final form for the threshold:\n$$\\hat{v}_L = (1 - s_H) c_L + s_H c_H$$\nThis expression represents the minimum value of $v_L$ required to prevent adverse selection from causing the market to unravel into a \"death spiral,\" where only high-risk individuals remain, leading to higher premiums.
