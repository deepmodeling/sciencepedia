Suppose the inverse linear demand for SSBs is $P(q) = \\alpha - \\beta q$ with $\\alpha > c$ and $\\beta > 0$, where $q$ denotes quantity and $c > 0$ is constant marginal private cost. The market is competitive, and the health externality from consumption generates a marginal external harm function $H(q) = a q$ with $a > 0$. The authority can set a per-unit tax $t$ on producers. Using the fundamental welfare principle that the socially optimal quantity equates marginal benefit with social marginal cost, and that the private market without regulation equates marginal benefit with marginal private cost, derive the tax $t^*$ that decentralizes the social optimum (the Pigouvian tax). Then, compute the deadweight loss (DWL) in the unregulated market relative to the social optimum.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "First, we identify the key functions and conditions.\nThe inverse demand function, which represents the marginal benefit ($MB$) to consumers, is given by $P(q) = \\alpha - \\beta q$.\nThe marginal private cost ($MPC$) of production is constant, so $MPC(q) = c$.\nThe marginal external harm ($H$) from consumption is given by the function $H(q) = a q$.\nThe social marginal cost ($SMC$) is the sum of the marginal private cost and the marginal external harm: $SMC(q) = MPC(q) + H(q) = c + a q$.\n\nThe problem states that the unregulated private market equates marginal benefit with marginal private cost. Let $q_{mkt}$ be the equilibrium quantity in the unregulated market.\n$$MB(q_{mkt}) = MPC(q_{mkt})$$\n$$\\alpha - \\beta q_{mkt} = c$$\nSolving for $q_{mkt}$:\n$$\\beta q_{mkt} = \\alpha - c$$\n$$q_{mkt} = \\frac{\\alpha - c}{\\beta}$$\nThe condition $\\alpha > c$ ensures that $q_{mkt} > 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the socially optimal quantity, $q^*$, which equates marginal benefit with social marginal cost.\n$$MB(q^*) = SMC(q^*)$$\n$$\\alpha - \\beta q^* = c + a q^*$$\nSolving for $q^*$:\n$$\\alpha - c = a q^* + \\beta q^*$$\n$$\\alpha - c = (a + \\beta) q^*$$\n$$q^* = \\frac{\\alpha - c}{a + \\beta}$$\nSince $a > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, the denominator is larger than that for $q_{mkt}$, which implies $q^*  q_{mkt}$ as expected for a negative externality.\n\nThe problem asks for the per-unit tax, $t^*$, that decentralizes the social optimum. This is the Pigouvian tax. A tax on producers shifts the marginal private cost curve upward to $MPC_{tax}(q) = c + t$. The market will then produce a quantity $q$ where $MB(q) = MPC_{tax}(q)$. We need to find the tax $t^*$ that makes this new equilibrium quantity equal to $q^*$.\n$$MB(q^*) = c + t^*$$\n$$\\alpha - \\beta q^* = c + t^*$$\nSolving for $t^*$:\n$$t^* = \\alpha - c - \\beta q^*$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $q^*$:\n$$t^* = \\alpha - c - \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - c}{a + \\beta} \\right)$$\n$$t^* = (\\alpha - c) \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\beta}{a + \\beta} \\right)$$\n$$t^* = (\\alpha - c) \\left( \\frac{(a + \\beta) - \\beta}{a + \\beta} \\right)$$\n$$t^* = (\\alpha - c) \\left( \\frac{a}{a + \\beta} \\right) = \\frac{a(\\alpha - c)}{a + \\beta}$$\nAlternatively, a Pigouvian tax must be equal to the marginal external harm at the socially optimal quantity, $t^* = H(q^*)$.\n$$t^* = a q^* = a \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - c}{a + \\beta} \\right) = \\frac{a(\\alpha - c)}{a + \\beta}$$\nThis confirms the result.\n\nFinally, we compute the deadweight loss (DWL) in the unregulated market. The DWL is the total loss of social surplus due to the overproduction from $q^*$ to $q_{mkt}$. It is represented by the area of the triangle between the $SMC$ curve and the $MB$ curve, over the range of quantities from $q^*$ to $q_{mkt}$.\nThe area can be calculated by integrating the difference between the social marginal cost and the marginal benefit from $q^*$ to $q_{mkt}$:\n$$DWL = \\int_{q^*}^{q_{mkt}} (SMC(q) - MB(q)) dq$$\n$$DWL = \\int_{q^*}^{q_{mkt}} ((c + aq) - (\\alpha - \\beta q)) dq = \\int_{q^*}^{q_{mkt}} ((a + \\beta)q - (\\alpha - c)) dq$$\nLet's define the integrand as $g(q) = (a+\\beta)q - (\\alpha-c)$. At the optimal quantity $q^* = \\frac{\\alpha-c}{a+\\beta}$, the integrand is $g(q^*) = (a+\\beta) \\frac{\\alpha-c}{a+\\beta} - (\\alpha-c) = 0$. We can therefore write $g(q) = (a+\\beta)(q-q^*)$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$DWL = \\int_{q^*}^{q_{mkt}} (a+\\beta)(q-q^*) dq$$\n$$DWL = (a+\\beta) \\left[ \\frac{(q-q^*)^2}{2} \\right]_{q^*}^{q_{mkt}} = \\frac{1}{2}(a+\\beta)(q_{mkt}-q^*)^2$$\nWe now need to calculate the difference in quantities, $q_{mkt} - q^*$:\n$$q_{mkt} - q^* = \\frac{\\alpha-c}{\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha-c}{a+\\beta}$$\n$$q_{mkt} - q^* = (\\alpha-c) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\frac{1}{a+\\beta} \\right) = (\\alpha-c) \\left( \\frac{(a+\\beta) - \\beta}{\\beta(a+\\beta)} \\right)$$\n$$q_{mkt} - q^* = \\frac{a(\\alpha-c)}{\\beta(a+\\beta)}$$\nSubstituting this difference back into the expression for DWL:\n$$DWL = \\frac{1}{2}(a+\\beta) \\left( \\frac{a(\\alpha-c)}{\\beta(a+\\beta)} \\right)^2$$\n$$DWL = \\frac{1}{2}(a+\\beta) \\frac{a^2(\\alpha-c)^2}{\\beta^2(a+\\beta)^2}$$\n$$DWL = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{a^2(\\alpha-c)^2}{\\beta^2(a+\\beta)}$$\n\nThe two required expressions are the optimal tax, $t^*$, and the deadweight loss, $DWL$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{a(\\alpha - c)}{a + \\beta}  \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{a^2 (\\alpha - c)^2}{\\beta^2 (a + \\beta)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4399091"}, {"introduction": "Health policymakers rarely have the luxury of implementing every good idea; they must choose the most efficient options among competing strategies.

Analyze the Post-Implementation State**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the equity metrics post-implementation and compare them to the baseline and the stated standards.\n\n-   **Absolute Disparity (AD)**: The absolute difference in rates between the two groups, $AD = R_D - R_A$.\n    -   Baseline: $AD_0 = R_{D,0} - R_{A,0} = 12 - 8 = 4$ per 1000.\n    -   Post-implementation: $AD_1 = R_{D,1} - R_{A,1} = 11 - 6 = 5$ per 1000.\n    -   The absolute disparity has increased by $AD_1 - AD_0 = 5 - 4 = 1$ unit. This indicates a worsening of equity in absolute terms.\n\n-   **Relative Disparity (Risk Ratio, RR)**: The ratio of the rates, $RR = R_D / R_A$.\n    -   Baseline: $RR_0 = R_{D,0} / R_{A,0} = 12 / 8 = 1.5$.\n    -   Post-implementation: $RR_1 = R_{D,1} / R_{A,1} = 11 / 6 \\approx 1.833$.\n    -   The relative disparity has also increased, since $1.833 > 1.5$. This indicates a worsening of equity in relative terms.\n\n**2. Evaluate Against Stated Principles**\n\n-   **Balance Health Gain and Equity**: There was a net population health gain, as given by $\\Delta Q = 900$ QALYs. However, both absolute and relative equity have worsened. The decision must address this trade-off.\n\n-   **Non-Negotiable Equity Floor**: The policy requires $RR \\le r^* = 1.15$.\n    -   The calculated post-implementation risk ratio is $RR_1 \\approx 1.833$.\n    -   Since $1.833 > 1.15$, the \"non-negotiable\" equity floor has been **breached**. This is a critical failure of the policy according to the stated principles.\n\n-   **Feasibility of Incremental Change**: A proposed modification would take 4 months and cost 3.5% of the budget. This is within the feasibility constraints of $T^* = 6$ months and $B^* = 4\\%$. Therefore, an incremental modification is a feasible option.\n\n**3. Analyze the Effect of the Feasible Incremental Modification**\n\nThe problem states the feasible modification could, at most, reduce the risk ratio by 0.08.\n-   New Risk Ratio after modification: $RR_{new} = RR_1 - 0.08 \\approx 1.833 - 0.08 = 1.753$.\n-   We must check if this restores the equity floor: $1.753 > 1.15$.\n-   The equity floor **remains breached** even after the best-case feasible incremental modification.\n\n**4. Inequality-Sensitive Social Welfare Assessment**\n\nThe problem provides an inequality aversion parameter, $\\lambda = 1000$ QALYs per unit increase in absolute disparity. This can be used to create an inequality-adjusted welfare metric. A common form is $W = \\Delta Q_{total} - \\lambda \\times (\\text{change in AD})$.\n-   The change in absolute disparity is $\\Delta(AD) = AD_1 - AD_0 = 1$.\n-   The welfare cost of increased inequality is $\\lambda \\times \\Delta(AD) = 1000 \\times 1 = 1000$ QALYs.\n-   The inequality-sensitive welfare is $W = \\Delta Q - 1000 = 900 - 1000 = -100$ QALYs.\n-   The negative value signifies that, from this perspective, the harm caused by the increase in inequality outweighs the overall health benefits.\n\n**5. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nNow we evaluate each proposed decision rule based on the analysis above and the fundamental principles.\n\n**A. Proceed with incremental modification whenever $\\Delta Q > 0$ and proposed changes fit within $T^*$ and $B^*$, because net health gain and feasibility suffice to justify continuing implementation, regardless of changes in disparities.**\nThis rule ignores equity. It explicitly states to proceed \"regardless of changes in disparities\". This violates the principle of balancing health gain with equity and, most critically, ignores the \"non-negotiable\" equity floor. In our case, it would lead to proceeding with a policy that has critically failed on a non-negotiable standard.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Return to formulation whenever any increase in disparity is observed (either absolute or relative), regardless of total health gains or whether implementation changes could feasibly mitigate the increase within $T^*$ and $B^*$.**\nThis rule is too rigid. It makes any increase in disparity an absolute-veto criterion, which contradicts the principle of \"balancing\" health gain and equity. It also ignores the possibility of correcting a minor equity issue with a feasible incremental change, a mechanism explicitly provided for in the problem setup. A very small equity worsening might be acceptable in the face of a very large health gain, or if it can be easily fixed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Return to formulation if either the equity floor is breached and cannot be restored within $T^*$ and $B^*$ by feasible incremental changes, or the inequality-sensitive welfare becomes negative when applying $\\lambda$; otherwise, proceed with incremental modification while prioritizing gap-closing during implementation.**\nThis rule provides a sophisticated, multi-part test that aligns perfectly with the problem's principles.\n-   **Part 1**: \"Return to formulation if...the equity floor is breached and cannot be restored...by feasible incremental changes\". This correctly operationalizes the \"non-negotiable\" standard while allowing for simple fixes. Our analysis shows the floor is breached ($1.833 > 1.15$) and the feasible fix is insufficient ($1.753 > 1.15$). This condition is met.\n-   **Part 2**: \"Return to formulation if...the inequality-sensitive welfare becomes negative\". This operationalizes the \"balance\" principle using the provided quantitative tool ($\\lambda$). Our analysis shows the welfare is negative ($-100$ QALYs). This condition is also met.\n-   The rule uses \"or\", so either condition triggers a return to formulation. In this case, both do. The \"otherwise\" clause correctly specifies that if these critical failures are not present, an incremental modification is the appropriate path. This rule comprehensively and correctly applies all the given principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Proceed with incremental modification as long as the proposed changes move disparity metrics in the right direction (reduce either risk ratio or absolute difference) within $T^*$ and $B^*$, even if the equity floor remains breached and the inequality-sensitive welfare is negative, because continual implementation is preferred over revisiting formulation.**\nThis rule suggests that any minor improvement is sufficient to continue, even in the face of catastrophic failure on core principles. It explicitly tolerates a breached \"non-negotiable\" equity floor and a negative welfare outcome. The justification \"continual implementation is preferred\" is an ad-hoc assumption not supported by the problem's description of a policy cycle. This rule violates the core principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4399151"}]}
