This practice guides you through creating a mathematical function for a patient's out-of-pocket liability based on the plan's deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum. Mastering this foundational model is the first step toward analyzing financial risk in healthcare [@problem_id:4403176].", "problem": "A health insurance plan with cost-sharing features can cause patients to be effectively uninsured for a portion of their spending and underinsured over another portion. Consider a plan defined by a deductible of $D$, a constant coinsurance rate of $\\gamma$ once the deductible is met, and an out-of-pocket maximum of $Z$. Let $M$ denote a patient's total covered medical expenditure in dollars. Define the patient's out-of-pocket liability function $L(M)$ using the following standard cost-sharing principles: (i) expenditures up to the deductible are paid fully by the patient, (ii) beyond the deductible, the patient pays a constant fraction equal to the coinsurance rate until the out-of-pocket maximum is reached, and (iii) once the out-of-pocket maximum is reached, the patient's out-of-pocket liability stops increasing.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the piecewise functional form of $L(M)$ as a function of $M$, $D$, $\\gamma$, and $Z$. Then, for a plan with $D = 2{,}000$ dollars, $\\gamma = 0.2$, and $Z = 6{,}000$ dollars, compute $L(M)$ for $M = 1{,}500$ dollars, $M = 5{,}000$ dollars, and $M = 40{,}000$ dollars. Finally, determine the effective marginal price schedule implied by cost-sharing, defined as $p(M) = \\frac{dL}{dM}$, and sketch it, clearly labeling the breakpoints in $M$ at which $p(M)$ changes value.\n\nExpress each computed out-of-pocket liability in dollars. No rounding is required. The final numerical answer should report the three liabilities as a single row vector.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions of cost-sharing in health insurance. The deductible is the amount of spending the patient pays in full before any insurance payments occur. The coinsurance rate is the constant fractional share of marginal spending the patient pays once the deductible has been met. The out-of-pocket maximum caps the total out-of-pocket liability; once the cap is reached, further spending does not increase the patient's out-of-pocket payments.\n\nLet $M$ be total covered medical expenditure. We construct $L(M)$ by applying these principles over ranges of $M$:\n\n1. For expenditures up to the deductible, the patient pays the full amount. Thus, for $M \\leq D$, the liability is $L(M) = M$.\n\n2. For expenditures beyond the deductible but before the out-of-pocket maximum is reached, the patient has already paid $D$ for the first $D$ dollars, and then pays a fraction $\\gamma$ of each additional dollar. For $M  D$, absent the out-of-pocket maximum, the liability would be $D + \\gamma \\left(M - D\\right)$.\n\n3. The out-of-pocket maximum $Z$ imposes the cap $L(M) \\leq Z$. Therefore, the liability function is the minimum among the amounts implied by the ranges:\n$$\nL(M) = \\min\\left\\{\\, M,\\; D + \\gamma \\left(M - D\\right),\\; Z \\,\\right\\}.\n$$\n\nTo make the piecewise form explicit, we determine the spending level at which the coinsurance path would hit the cap.

The discounted charge, $C'$, is:\n$$C' = C \\times (1 - 0.40) = 14000 \\times 0.60 = 8400$$\nNext, the one-time charity grant, $G$, is subtracted from the discounted charge to determine the final patient liability, $L_U$.\n$$L_U = C' - G = 8400 - 500 = 7900$$\nThus, the patient's liability for Scenario U is $7900$ USD.\n\n**Scenario H: Underinsured, High-Deductible Plan**\nFor an insured patient with an in-network provider, the liability is based on the insurer's allowed amount, $A_H$, not the chargemaster $C$. The difference, $C - A_H = 14000 - 5000 = 9000$, is a contractual write-off by the hospital and is not the patient's responsibility.\n\nThe patient's liability is calculated by sequentially applying the deductible and then the coinsurance, subject to the OOP maximum.\n\n1.  **Deductible Calculation:**\n    The remaining annual deductible to be met is the total deductible minus the amount already met:\n    $$D_H^{\\text{rem}} = D_H - d_H = 3000 - 1200 = 1800$$\n    The patient's payment towards the deductible for this visit is the lesser of the allowed amount and the remaining deductible.\n    $$\\text{Payment}_{\\text{ded}} = \\min(A_H, D_H^{\\text{rem}}) = \\min(5000, 1800) = 1800$$\n\n2.  **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n    The portion of the allowed amount subject to coinsurance is the amount remaining after the deductible portion has been satisfied.\n    $$A_H' = A_H - \\text{Payment}_{\\text{ded}} = 5000 - 1800 = 3200$$\n    The coinsurance payment is this remaining amount multiplied by the coinsurance rate, $r_H$.\n    $$\\text{Payment}_{\\text{coins}} = A_H' \\times r_H = 3200 \\times 0.30 = 960$$\n\n3.  **Total Potential Liability and OOP Maximum Check:**\n    The total potential liability for this visit is the sum of the deductible and coinsurance payments.\n    $$L_{H}^{\\text{potential}} = \\text{Payment}_{\\text{ded}} + \\text{Payment}_{\\text{coins}} = 1800 + 960 = 2760$$\n    This amount must be checked against the remaining OOP maximum for the year.
