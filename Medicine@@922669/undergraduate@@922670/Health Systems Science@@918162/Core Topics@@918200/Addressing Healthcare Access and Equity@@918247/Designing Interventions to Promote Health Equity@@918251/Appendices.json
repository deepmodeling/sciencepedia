Access to reliable broadband is a Social Determinant of Health (SDOH). The network stratifies its panel into three socioeconomic strata: low-income, middle-income, and high-income. Let the strata be indexed by $s \\in \\{L, M, H\\}$ with population shares $w_L = 0.46$, $w_M = 0.34$, and $w_H = 0.20$, respectively, where $\\sum_{s} w_{s} = 1$. Before the intervention, the no-show probabilities by stratum are $n_L = 0.29$, $n_M = 0.19$, and $n_H = 0.11$. By definition, the attendance probability in a stratum is $a_s = 1 - n_s$.\n\nThe equity-focused broadband subsidy is offered to low-income and middle-income strata only. Within each eligible stratum $s \\in \\{L, M\\}$, a fraction $p_s$ of patients adopt the subsidized broadband, while the remaining fraction $1 - p_s$ do not. The adoption fractions are $p_L = 0.62$ and $p_M = 0.28$. Among adopters, the absolute no-show probability is reduced by $d_s$ due to improved access to telehealth and digital reminders; among non-adopters and among high-income patients (who are ineligible), there is no change from baseline. The effect sizes are $d_L = 0.09$ and $d_M = 0.05$.

Round your answer to $4$ significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in probability theory and health systems modeling, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the absolute change in the overall clinic-wide attendance probability, $\\Delta A$, and evaluate it. The overall attendance probability is the weighted average of the stratum-specific attendance probabilities, where the weights are the population shares.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{pre}}$ and $A_{\\text{post}}$ be the overall attendance probabilities before and after the intervention, respectively. The absolute change is defined as $\\Delta A = A_{\\text{post}} - A_{\\text{pre}}$.\n\nFirst, we define the pre-intervention state. For each stratum $s \\in \\{L, M, H\\}$, the no-show probability is $n_s$ and the attendance probability is $A_{s, \\text{pre}} = 1 - n_s$.\nUsing the law of total probability (or the linearity of expectation), the overall pre-intervention attendance probability is the weighted sum of the stratum-specific probabilities:\n$$A_{\\text{pre}} = \\sum_{s \\in \\{L,M,H\\}} w_s A_{s, \\text{pre}} = w_L A_{L, \\text{pre}} + w_M A_{M, \\text{pre}} + w_H A_{H, \\text{pre}}$$\nSubstituting $A_{s, \\text{pre}} = 1 - n_s$:\n$$A_{\\text{pre}} = w_L(1 - n_L) + w_M(1 - n_M) + w_H(1 - n_H)$$\n\nNext, we define the post-intervention state. The intervention affects strata $L$ and $M$. For stratum $H$, which is ineligible, the attendance probability remains unchanged: $A_{H, \\text{post}} = A_{H, \\text{pre}} = 1 - n_H$.\n\nFor an eligible stratum $s \\in \\{L, M\\}$, the population is divided into two sub-groups: adopters and non-adopters.\nA fraction $p_s$ of patients in stratum $s$ adopts the intervention. For this group, the no-show probability is reduced by $d_s$, becoming $n_s - d_s$. Their new attendance probability is $1 - (n_s - d_s)$.\nThe remaining fraction, $1 - p_s$, does not adopt. Their probabilities are unchanged, so their attendance probability remains $1 - n_s$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability again, the new average attendance probability for stratum $s \\in \\{L, M\\}$ is the weighted average of the attendance probabilities of its sub-groups:\n$$A_{s, \\text{post}} = p_s \\left(1 - (n_s - d_s)\\right) + (1 - p_s)(1 - n_s)$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$A_{s, \\text{post}} = p_s(1 - n_s + d_s) + (1 - p_s)(1 - n_s)$$\n$$A_{s, \\text{post}} = p_s(1 - n_s) + p_s d_s + (1 - n_s) - p_s(1 - n_s)$$\n$$A_{s, \\text{post}} = (1 - n_s) + p_s d_s$$\nSince $A_{s, \\text{pre}} = 1 - n_s$, we find a simple relationship:\n$$A_{s, \\text{post}} = A_{s, \\text{pre}} + p_s d_s$$\n\nNow we can write the expression for the overall post-intervention attendance probability:\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = \\sum_{s \\in \\{L,M,H\\}} w_s A_{s, \\text{post}}$$\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = w_L A_{L, \\text{post}} + w_M A_{M, \\text{post}} + w_H A_{H, \\text{post}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{s, \\text{post}}$:\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = w_L (A_{L, \\text{pre}} + p_L d_L) + w_M (A_{M, \\text{pre}} + p_M d_M) + w_H A_{H, \\text{pre}}$$\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = (w_L A_{L, \\text{pre}} + w_M A_{M, \\text{pre}} + w_H A_{H, \\text{pre}}) + w_L p_L d_L + w_M p_M d_M$$\n\nThe term in the parentheses is precisely the definition of $A_{\\text{pre}}$. Therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = A_{\\text{pre}} + w_L p_L d_L + w_M p_M d_M$$\n\nThe absolute change in the overall clinic-wide attendance probability, $\\Delta A$, is:\n$$\\Delta A = A_{\\text{post}} - A_{\\text{pre}} = (A_{\\text{pre}} + w_L p_L d_L + w_M p_M d_M) - A_{\\text{pre}}$$\n$$\\Delta A = w_L p_L d_L + w_M p_M d_M$$\nThis expression, derived from first principles, represents the change. It is the sum of the changes in attendance within each eligible stratum, weighted by that stratum's share of the total population.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- Population shares: $w_{L} = 0.46$, $w_{M} = 0.34$.\n- Adoption fractions: $p_{L} = 0.62$, $p_{M} = 0.28$.\n- Effect sizes (absolute no-show reduction): $d_{L} = 0.09$, $d_{M} = 0.05$.\n\n$$\\Delta A = (0.46)(0.62)(0.09) + (0.34)(0.28)(0.05)$$\nFirst term:\n$$(0.46)(0.62)(0.09) = (0.2852)(0.09) = 0.025668$$\nSecond term:\n$$(0.34)(0.28)(0.05) = (0.0952)(0.05) = 0.00476$$\nSumming the terms:\n$$\\Delta A = 0.025668 + 0.00476 = 0.030428$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
