Each care coordinator is trained to a standardized workflow and completes an average of $\\mu = 7$ tasks per day, producing a stable per-coordinator service rate.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the fundamental definitions of capacity, demand, and utilization in a service system.\n\n**1. Single-Coordinator Utilization**\n\nUtilization, denoted by the symbol $\\rho$, is a dimensionless quantity that represents the proportion of time a server or system is busy. It is defined from first principles as the ratio of the average rate of demand (work arriving) to the average rate of capacity (work that can be processed).\n\n- Average demand rate = Arrival rate of tasks = $\\lambda$.\n- Average capacity rate for a single server = Service rate of one coordinator = $\\mu$.\n\nFor a system with a single coordinator ($s=1$), the utilization, which we denote as $\\rho_1$, is:\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{\\text{Average Demand Rate}}{\\text{Average Capacity Rate}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\lambda = 58 \\text{ tasks/day}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = 7 \\text{ tasks/day}\n$$\nThe single-coordinator utilization is:\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{58}{7}\n$$\nSince $\\rho_1 = \\frac{58}{7} \\approx 8.28 > 1$, a single coordinator's capacity is insufficient to handle the average demand. This indicates an unstable system where the backlog of tasks would grow without bound.\n\n**2. Generalized Utilization and Stability Condition**\n\nFor a system with $s$ parallel coordinators, where each coordinator works independently at an average rate of $\\mu$, the total system capacity is the sum of the individual capacities.\n- Total System Capacity = $s \\times \\mu$.\n\nThe utilization for the $s$-coordinator system, $\\rho_s$, is the ratio of the total demand rate to the total system capacity:\n$$\n\\rho_s = \\frac{\\lambda}{s \\mu}\n$$\nThe fundamental condition for queueing stability dictates that the long-term average system capacity must exceed the long-term average demand rate. If the demand rate is greater than or equal to the capacity rate, the queue of waiting tasks will grow indefinitely.\n- **Backlog Stabilizes (Stable System):** Average Demand Rate $<$ Average Capacity Rate $\\implies \\lambda < s \\mu$. This is equivalent to the utilization being strictly less than one: $\\rho_s = \\frac{\\lambda}{s \\mu} < 1$.\n- **Backlog Grows (Unstable System):** Average Demand Rate $\\geq$ Average Capacity Rate $\\implies \\lambda \\geq s \\mu$. This is equivalent to the utilization being greater than or equal to one: $\\rho_s = \\frac{\\lambda}{s \\mu} \\geq 1$.\n\n**3. Minimum Number of Coordinators ($s$)**\n\nThe hospital's operating policy imposes a stricter condition than simple stability ($\\rho_s < 1$). It requires a resilience threshold where the utilization must be strictly less than $0.85$ to absorb variability and prevent excessive delays.\nThe condition is:\n$$\n\\rho_s < 0.85\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda}{s \\mu} < 0.85\n$$\nWe are given $\\lambda = 58$ and $\\mu = 7$. We must solve for the minimum integer $s$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{58}{s \\cdot 7} < 0.85\n$$\nTo solve for $s$, we can rearrange the inequality. Since $s$ represents the number of coordinators, it must be a positive integer, so we can multiply both sides by $s$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$\n\\frac{58}{7} < 0.85 \\cdot s\n$$\nNow, isolate $s$:\n$$\ns > \\frac{58}{7 \\cdot 0.85}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$\n7 \\cdot 0.85 = 5.95\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the inequality:\n$$\ns > \\frac{58}{5.95}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\ns > 9.747899...\n$$\nSince $s$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $s$ that is strictly greater than $9.747899...$ is $10$.\nTherefore, a minimum of $s=10$ care coordinators are needed to meet the resilience threshold.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the utilization with $s=10$:\n$$\n\\rho_{10} = \\frac{58}{10 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{58}{70} \\approx 0.82857...\n$$\nThis value is indeed less than the required threshold of $0.85$. If we were to use $s=9$:\n$$\n\\rho_9 = \\frac{58}{9 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{58}{63} \\approx 0.9206...\n$$\nThis value exceeds the $0.85$ threshold. Thus, the minimum integer number of coordinators is confirmed to be $10$.\n\nThe computed values are:\n1.  Single-coordinator utilization: $\\frac{58}{7}$.\n2.  Minimum integer $s$: $10$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{58}{7} & 10 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4362697"}, {"introduction": "Once a team is in place, the focus shifts to the quality and reliability of the care processes they manage.

The solution process will now be executed.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet $S_{DE}$, $S_{MR}$, and $S_{FS}$ be the events that the primary processes for Discharge Education, Medication Reconciliation, and Follow-up Scheduling are successful, respectively. Their probabilities (reliabilities) are given as:\n$P(S_{DE}) = R_{DE} = 0.88$\n$P(S_{MR}) = R_{MR} = 0.92$\n$P(S_{FS}) = R_{FS} = 0.80$\n\nLet $S'_{DE}$, $S'_{MR}$, and $S'_{FS}$ be the events that the corresponding redundant checks are successful. Their reliabilities are given as:\n$P(S'_{DE}) = r_{DE} = 0.70$\n$P(S'_{MR}) = r_{MR} = 0.96$\n$P(S'_{FS}) = r_{FS} = 0.65$\n\n**1. Baseline Probability of Successful Transition ($P_{baseline}$)**\n\nA successful transition requires all three primary processes to succeed. Since these events are independent, the baseline probability of a successful transition, $P_{baseline}$, is the product of their individual probabilities (multiplication rule for independent events). This is a series system.\n$$P_{baseline} = P(S_{DE} \\cap S_{MR} \\cap S_{FS})$$\n$$P_{baseline} = P(S_{DE}) \\times P(S_{MR}) \\times P(S_{FS})$$\n$$P_{baseline} = R_{DE} \\times R_{MR} \\times R_{FS}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{baseline} = 0.88 \\times 0.92 \\times 0.80 = 0.64768$$\n\n**2. Improved Probability of Successful Transition ($P_{improved}$)**\n\nWith the addition of redundant checks, each of the three components is now a parallel system. A component is successful if either its primary process or its redundant check is successful. The overall system remains a series of these three improved components.\n\nFirst, we calculate the reliability of each improved component. It is most direct to use the complement rule: the probability of a component succeeding is $1$ minus the probability of the component failing. A parallel component fails only if all its sub-components fail.\n\nLet $R'_{DE}$, $R'_{MR}$, and $R'_{FS}$ be the reliabilities of the improved components.\n\nFor Discharge Education (DE):\nThe component fails if both the primary process and the redundant check fail. Using the complement rule and the independence assumption:\n$P(\\text{DE component fails}) = P(\\text{not } S_{DE}) \\times P(\\text{not } S'_{DE}) = (1 - R_{DE})(1 - r_{DE})$\nThe reliability of the improved DE component is:\n$R'_{DE} = 1 - (1 - R_{DE})(1 - r_{DE})$\n$R'_{DE} = 1 - (1 - 0.88)(1 - 0.70) = 1 - (0.12)(0.30) = 1 - 0.036 = 0.964$\n\nFor Medication Reconciliation (MR):\nSimilarly, the reliability of the improved MR component is:\n$R'_{MR} = 1 - (1 - R_{MR})(1 - r_{MR})$\n$R'_{MR} = 1 - (1 - 0.92)(1 - 0.96) = 1 - (0.08)(0.04) = 1 - 0.0032 = 0.9968$\n\nFor Follow-up Scheduling (FS):\nSimilarly, the reliability of the improved FS component is:\n$R'_{FS} = 1 - (1 - R_{FS})(1 - r_{FS})$\n$R'_{FS} = 1 - (1 - 0.80)(1 - 0.65) = 1 - (0.20)(0.35) = 1 - 0.07 = 0.93$\n\nThe improved probability of a successful transition, $P_{improved}$, is the product of the reliabilities of these three independent, improved components:\n$$P_{improved} = R'_{DE} \\times R'_{MR} \\times R'_{FS}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$P_{improved} = 0.964 \\times 0.9968 \\times 0.93 \\approx 0.893636256$$\n\n**3.
