This practice challenges you to bridge that gap by calculating a test's Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$), demonstrating how profoundly a population's disease prevalence ($p$) influences a test's predictive power. Mastering this application of Bayes' theorem is fundamental to correctly interpreting screening results and avoiding common clinical misjudgments.

It uses standard, well-defined concepts from epidemiology and biostatistics (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) and their relationships as described by Bayes' Theorem. The provided numerical values are realistic for a medical screening test.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is formalizable using the axioms and theorems of probability theory.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nLet $D$ denote the event that an individual has the disease, and $D^c$ denote the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe given information can be written as:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.03$. From this, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$.\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$.\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.97$.\n\nFrom these, we can also deduce the probabilities of the complementary conditional events:\n- False Negative Rate: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\n- False Positive Rate: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$.\n\n**1. Derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe $PPV$ is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease, i.e., $PPV = P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing Bayes' Theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator is the product of the sensitivity and the prevalence: $P(T^+ | D) P(D) = Se \\cdot p$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We find this using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nCombining these, the general expression for $PPV$ is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\n\n**2. Derive the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that an individual with a negative test result is truly disease-free, i.e., $NPV = P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing Bayes' Theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe numerator is the product of the specificity and the probability of not having the disease: $P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) = Sp \\cdot (1 - p)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - p)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot p)$$\nCombining these, the general expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{(Sp \\cdot (1 - p)) + (1 - Se)p}$$\n\n**3. Compute Numerical Values**\nUsing the given parameters: $p = 0.03$, $Se = 0.92$, and $Sp = 0.97$.\n\nFor $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.03}{(0.92 \\cdot 0.03) + (1 - 0.97)(1 - 0.03)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + (0.03)(0.97)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + 0.0291}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0567} \\approx 0.48677248677$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.4868$.\n\nFor $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.97 \\cdot (1 - 0.03)}{(0.97 \\cdot (1 - 0.03)) + (1 - 0.92)(0.03)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.97 \\cdot 0.97}{(0.97 \\cdot 0.97) + (0.08)(0.03)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9409}{0.9409 + 0.0024}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9409}{0.9433} \\approx 0.99745574048$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9975$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Clinical Meanings**\n- **PPV = 0.4868**: In this specific population, if an individual receives a positive screening test result, there is a $48.68\\%$ probability that they actually have the chronic condition. This indicates that a positive result is almost as likely to be a false positive (a probability of $1 - 0.4868 = 0.5132$ or $51.32\\%$) as it is to be a true positive. This is a common finding for screening tests in low-prevalence populations and underscores the need for confirmatory diagnostic testing following a positive screen.\n- **NPV = 0.9975**: If an individual from this population receives a negative screening test result, there is a $99.75\\%$ probability that they are truly free of the condition. This very high $NPV$ indicates that a negative result is extremely reliable for ruling out the disease in this context. It provides a high degree of reassurance to the patient and clinician.\n\nThe ordered pair of computed values is $(PPV, NPV) = (0.4868, 0.9975)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.4868  0.9975\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4374026"}, {"introduction": "Moving from evaluating a test to evaluating a health promotion program, it's crucial to communicate its impact clearly.

The relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the treated group ($p_1$) to the baseline risk in the untreated group ($p_0$).\n$$RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $p_1$:\n$$p_1 = RR \\times p_0$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$p_1 = 0.8 \\times 0.10 = 0.08$$\nThus, the one-year risk of the adverse outcome for an individual in the program is $0.08$, or $8 \\%$.\n\nNext, we derive the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$). The $ARR$ is the arithmetic difference in risk between the untreated group and the treated group. It quantifies the absolute effect of the intervention.\n$$ARR = p_0 - p_1$$\nUsing the given value for $p_0$ and the calculated value for $p_1$:\n$$ARR = 0.10 - 0.08 = 0.02$$\nThis means the program reduces the absolute risk of the outcome by $2$ percentage points.\n\nNow, we derive the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is defined as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50$$\nThe problem specifies that this value should be reported rounded to four significant figures.

The analysis compares two mutually exclusive strategies, where Strategy 2 is more effective ($E_2 > E_1$) and more costly ($C_2 > C_1$) than Strategy 1.\n\nFirst, we define the incremental cost and incremental effectiveness, which represent the additional cost incurred to achieve an additional unit of health benefit when moving from the comparator (Strategy 1) to the new intervention (Strategy 2).\n\nThe incremental cost, denoted by $\\Delta C$, is the difference between the cost of Strategy 2 and Strategy 1:\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_2 - C_1\n$$\nThe incremental effectiveness, denoted by $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the effectiveness of Strategy 2 and Strategy 1:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\$800 - \\$500 = \\$300\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = 10.25 \\text{ QALYs} - 10.20 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.05 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
