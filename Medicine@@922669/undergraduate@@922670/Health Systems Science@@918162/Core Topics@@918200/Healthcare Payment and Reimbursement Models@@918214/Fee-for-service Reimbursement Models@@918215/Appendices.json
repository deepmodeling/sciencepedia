The clinic operates under Fee-for-Service (FFS) reimbursement.\n2.  Total Revenue ($TR$) is defined as price per unit ($P$) times quantity ($V$).\n3.  Total Cost ($TC$) is defined as fixed cost ($FC$) plus variable cost per unit ($VC$) times quantity ($V$).\n4.  Break-even occurs when Total Revenue equals Total Cost ($TR = TC$).\n5.  Specific values for a clinic: $FC = 200,000$ USD, $P = 120$ USD per visit, and $VC = 60$ USD per visit.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in fundamental economic principles, well-posed with all necessary definitions and data, and objective in its language. It is directly relevant to health systems science and can be formalized and solved using basic algebra. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nLet $V$ represent the volume of services (visits).\nLet $P$ be the price per service, which is the uniform payment in the FFS model.\nLet $VC$ be the variable cost per service.\nLet $FC$ be the period-specific fixed costs.\n\nAccording to the definitions provided in the problem statement:\nTotal Revenue ($TR$) is given by the expression:\n$$TR = P \\times V$$\n\nTotal Cost ($TC$) is the sum of fixed and total variable costs:\n$$TC = FC + (VC \\times V)$$\n\nThe break-even point is defined as the volume at which total revenue equals total cost. Let us denote the break-even volume as $V_{BE}$. At this volume, the condition is:\n$$TR = TC$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $TR$ and $TC$:\n$$P \\times V_{BE} = FC + (VC \\times V_{BE})$$\n\nTo derive an expression for the break-even volume, $V_{BE}$, we must solve this equation for $V_{BE}$. We begin by isolating the terms containing $V_{BE}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$P \\times V_{BE} - VC \\times V_{BE} = FC$$\n\nNext, we factor out $V_{BE}$ from the terms on the left side:\n$$V_{BE} (P - VC) = FC$$\n\nFinally, we divide by the term $(P - VC)$ to solve for $V_{BE}$. The term $(P - VC)$ represents the contribution margin per visit—that is, the amount of revenue from each visit that is available to cover fixed costs.\n$$V_{BE} = \\frac{FC}{P - VC}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the break-even volume.\n\nNext, we explain how each of the three quantities affects the break-even volume, based on the derived expression.\n1.  **Fixed Cost ($FC$):** The break-even volume, $V_{BE}$, is directly proportional to the fixed cost, $FC$. As seen in the formula, $FC$ is in the numerator. An increase in $FC$ will lead to a proportional increase in the number of visits required to break even, assuming $P$ and $VC$ remain constant. This is because higher fixed costs require more total contribution margin to be covered before the clinic can become profitable.\n2.  **Price per Service ($P$):** The break-even volume, $V_{BE}$, is inversely related to the price per service, $P$. The price $P$ appears in the denominator as part of the contribution margin $(P - VC)$. An increase in $P$ increases the denominator, which in turn decreases $V_{BE}$. A higher price means each visit contributes more towards covering the fixed costs, thus fewer visits are needed to reach the break-even point.\n3.  **Variable Cost per Service ($VC$):** The break-even volume, $V_{BE}$, is directly related to the variable cost per service, $VC$. The variable cost $VC$ is subtracted from $P$ in the denominator. An increase in $VC$ decreases the denominator $(P - VC)$, which in turn increases $V_{BE}$. A higher variable cost reduces the contribution margin from each visit, meaning more visits are required to accumulate enough funds to cover the fixed costs.\n\nFinally, we compute the break-even volume for the given clinic values.\nThe given values are:\nFixed Cost, $FC = 200,000$\nPrice per visit, $P = 120$\nVariable Cost per visit, $VC = 60$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for $V_{BE}$:\n$$V_{BE} = \\frac{200,000}{120 - 60}$$\n$$V_{BE} = \\frac{200,000}{60}$$\n$$V_{BE} = \\frac{20,000}{6} = \\frac{10,000}{3}$$\n$$V_{BE} = 3333.333...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numeric answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth digit is a $3$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the break-even volume, rounded to four significant figures, is $3333$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3333}$$", "id": "4371088"}, {"introduction": "While break-even analysis uses a simplified \"price per service,\" the reality of FFS reimbursement is far more detailed.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Payment Expression**\n\nThe problem states that the total payment is derived from three resource components (work, practice expense, malpractice), each represented by a Relative Value Unit ($RVU$). Each component's $RVU$ is first adjusted for local cost variations using a corresponding Geographic Practice Cost Index ($GPCI$). The total locally adjusted $RVU$ for a service is the sum of these adjusted components.

Therefore, the payment expression is:\n$$P = CF \\cdot RVU_{total, adj}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $RVU_{total, adj}$, we derive the complete payment formula from first principles:\n$$P = CF \\cdot [(RVU_{w} \\cdot GPCI_{w}) + (RVU_{pe} \\cdot GPCI_{pe}) + (RVU_{mp} \\cdot GPCI_{mp})]$$\n\n**Computation of the Payer's Allowed Amount**\n\nUsing the given values:\n- $RVU_{w} = 2.4$\n- $RVU_{pe} = 1.8$\n- $RVU_{mp} = 0.2$\n- $GPCI_{w} = 1.05$\n- $GPCI_{pe} = 0.98$\n- $GPCI_{mp} = 1.00$\n- $CF = 36$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total adjusted $RVU$:\n$$RVU_{total, adj} = (2.4 \\cdot 1.05) + (1.8 \\cdot 0.98) + (0.2 \\cdot 1.00)$$\n$$RVU_{total, adj} = 2.52 + 1.764 + 0.20$$\n$$RVU_{total, adj} = 4.484$$\nNext, we calculate the total payment $P$ by applying the conversion factor:\n$$P = 36 \\cdot 4.484$$\n$$P = 161.424$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final allowed amount to four significant figures. The value $161.424$ rounded to four significant figures is $161.4$.\nSo, the payer's allowed amount is $\\$161.40$.\n\n**Interpretation of Component Contributions**\n\nTo interpret the relative contributions, we calculate the dollar amount attributable to each component.\nThe payment for the work component, $P_w$, is:\n$$P_w = CF \\cdot (RVU_{w} \\cdot GPCI_{w}) = 36 \\cdot (2.4 \\cdot 1.05) = 36 \\cdot 2.52 = 90.72$$\nThe payment for the practice expense component, $P_{pe}$, is:\n$$P_{pe} = CF \\cdot (RVU_{pe} \\cdot GPCI_{pe}) = 36 \\cdot (1.8 \\cdot 0.98) = 36 \\cdot 1.764 = 63.504$$\nThe payment for the malpractice component, $P_{mp}$, is:\n$$P_{mp} = CF \\cdot (RVU_{mp} \\cdot GPCI_{mp}) = 36 \\cdot (0.2 \\cdot 1.00) = 36 \\cdot 0.2 = 7.20$$\nThe sum of these component payments is $P_w + P_{pe} + P_{mp} = 90.72 + 63.504 + 7.20 = 161.424$, which matches the total allowed amount.\n\nNow, we calculate the share of the total payment for each component:\n- **Work Share**: $\\frac{P_w}{P} = \\frac{90.72}{161.424} \\approx 0.56196$, or approximately $56.20\\%$.\n- **Practice Expense Share**: $\\frac{P_{pe}}{P} = \\frac{63.504}{161.424} \\approx 0.39339$, or approximately $39.34\\%$.\n- **Malpractice Share**: $\\frac{P_{mp}}{P} = \\frac{7.20}{161.424} \\approx 0.04460$, or approximately $4.46\\%$.\n\nIn summary, for this particular service and location, the total allowed payment is $\\$161.424$.
