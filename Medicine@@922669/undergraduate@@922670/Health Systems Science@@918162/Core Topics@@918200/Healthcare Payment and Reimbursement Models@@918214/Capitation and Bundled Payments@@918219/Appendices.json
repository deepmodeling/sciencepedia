We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two tasks as specified in the problem statement. First, we derive a closed-form expression for the per member per month (PMPM) capitation rate, $r$. Second, we compute the total member months, $M$, and then calculate the numerical value of $r$ for the given scenario.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the PMPM Capitation Rate ($r$)\n\nThe derivation begins with the actuarially fair pricing principle stated in the problem: the expected premium revenue over the period must equal the expected total requirement to fund all costs. We can express this as an equation:\n\n$$\n\\text{Expected Premium Revenue} = \\text{Expected Total Requirement}\n$$\n\nWe will now formalize each side of this equation using the provided definitions.\n\n**Left-Hand Side: Expected Premium Revenue**\nThe problem states that for a PMPM rate of $r$ and a total of $M$ member months over the period, the total premium revenue is given by the product of these two quantities.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Premium Revenue} = r \\times M\n$$\n\n**Right-Hand Side: Expected Total Requirement**\nThe expected total requirement is defined as the sum of the expected medical claims cost and the administrative cost plus margin.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = \\text{Expected Claims} + (\\text{Admin Cost} + \\text{Margin})\n$$\nThe expected annual claims cost is given as $E[C]$. The administrative cost plus margin is modeled as a proportion of the expected claims, determined by a loading factor $\\ell$.\n$$\n\\text{Admin Cost} + \\text{Margin} = \\ell \\times E[C]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the total requirement yields:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = E[C] + \\ell \\times E[C]\n$$\nWe can factor out $E[C]$ from the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Total Requirement} = (1 + \\ell) E[C]\n$$\n\n**Assembling the Equation and Solving for $r$**\nNow, we equate the expressions for revenue and a total requirement:\n$$\nr \\times M = (1 + \\ell) E[C]\n$$\nTo find the closed-form expression for the PMPM rate $r$, we isolate $r$ by dividing both sides of the equation by the total member months, $M$. This is permissible as $M$ represents a total count of enrolled members over time and must be positive.\n$$\nr = \\frac{(1 + \\ell) E[C]}{M}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the PMPM capitation rate $r$ in terms of the expected annual claims cost $E[C]$, the total member months $M$, and the loading factor $\\ell$.\n\n### Task 2: Numerical Calculation of $M$ and $r$\n\nWe are given the following values for the scenario:\n- Expected annual claims cost, $E[C] = \\$13,750,000$.\n- Loading factor, $\\ell = 0.145$.\n- Monthly enrollment counts for the one-year period (January to December): $980$, $1000$, $1010$, $1025$, $1040$, $1055$, $1065$, $1070$, $1060$, $1050$, $1030$, $1005$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute Total Member Months ($M$)**\nThe total member months $M$ is the sum of the monthly enrollment counts over the $12$-month period.\n$$\nM = 980 + 1000 + 1010 + 1025 + 1040 + 1055 + 1065 + 1070 + 1060 + 1050 + 1030 + 1005\n$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$\nM = 12390 \\text{ member months}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the PMPM Rate ($r$)**\nWe now substitute the numerical values for $E[C]$, $\\ell$, and the computed value of $M$ into the derived expression for $r$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{(1 + 0.145) \\times 13,750,000}{12390}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which represents the expected total requirement in dollars:\n$$\n(1 + 0.145) \\times 13,750,000 = 1.145 \\times 13,750,000 = 15,743,750\n$$\nNow, divide this total requirement by the total member months, $M$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{15,743,750}{12390}\n$$\n$$\nr \\approx 1270.6820016...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nr \\approx 1271\n$$\nThus, the PMPM capitation rate is approximately $\\$1271$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1271}$$", "id": "4362250"}, {"introduction": "Shifting from population-based payments, we now turn to episode-based models like bundled payments.

The group considers adding one standardized unit of service intensity (for example, one evidence-based follow-up visit-equivalent) to its care pathway. Assume the following, grounded in standard definitions of payment models and microeconomic concepts:\n\n- Under capitation, revenue is fixed per covered life and does not increase with service volume; however, performance bonuses and shared savings are commonly tied to quality and total cost of care. For this additional unit of appropriate service, the expected incremental payment attributable to improved quality and lower total cost is $r_{\\mathrm{cap}} = 30$ dollars per patient within capitation.\n\n- Under bundled payments, the episode payment is fixed for a predefined care episode; incremental services inside an episode typically do not increase payment, but high performance can generate gainsharing. For this additional unit, the expected incremental payment from gainsharing is $r_{\\mathrm{bun}} = 18$ dollars per patient within bundles.\n\n- Under fee-for-service, revenue increases with each billable unit of service at the marginal price.

It is based on established microeconomic principles applied to standard healthcare payment models. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.
