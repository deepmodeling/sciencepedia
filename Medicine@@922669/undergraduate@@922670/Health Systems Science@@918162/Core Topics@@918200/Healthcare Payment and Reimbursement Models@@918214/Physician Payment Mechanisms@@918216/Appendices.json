It describes the standard calculation for physician payment under the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) and provides all necessary data to arrive at a unique solution.\n\nThe total payment for a physician service under the RBRVS is determined by summing the geographically adjusted relative value units for each of its three components and then multiplying this sum by a national conversion factor. The three components are physician work (w), practice expense (pe), and malpractice (mp).\n\nThe formula for the total payment, denoted as $P_{total}$, can be expressed as:\n$$P_{total} = \\left[ (RVU_w \\times GPCI_w) + (RVU_{pe} \\times GPCI_{pe}) + (RVU_{mp} \\times GPCI_{mp}) \\right] \\times CF$$\nwhere:\n- $RVU_w$, $RVU_{pe}$, and $RVU_{mp}$ are the relative value units for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice, respectively.\n- $GPCI_w$, $GPCI_{pe}$, and $GPCI_{mp}$ are the corresponding component-specific Geographic Practice Cost Indices.\n- $CF$ is the conversion factor.\n\nThe term inside the brackets represents the total geographically adjusted relative value units for the service.

The calculated value is $135.864$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $5$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $6$.
