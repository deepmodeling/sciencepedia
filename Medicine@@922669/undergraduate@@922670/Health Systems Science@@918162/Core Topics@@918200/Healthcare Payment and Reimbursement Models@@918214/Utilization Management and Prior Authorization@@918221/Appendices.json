The concepts of utilization management, prior authorization, opportunity cost, and billable time are standard and well-defined. The numerical values are plausible for a multispecialty outpatient clinic setting.

The instructions for calculation are explicit and unambiguous. A unique solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is clear and unbiased. All terms are defined quantitatively.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, arithmetical problem based on a realistic scenario in healthcare administration. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is determined by a step-by-step application of the fundamental definitions provided.\n\n**Part 1: Total Annual Clinician Time on Prior Authorization**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time spent on PA activities per clinic day, denoted as $T_{day}$. This is the product of the number of PA requests per day and the time required for each request.\n$$ T_{day} = N_{PA/day} \\times T_{PA} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ T_{day} = 50 \\times 12 \\text{ min} = 600 \\text{ min} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total annual time spent on PA activities, $T_{annual}$, by multiplying the daily time by the number of clinic days per year.\n$$ T_{annual} = T_{day} \\times D_{year} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ T_{annual} = 600 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{day}} \\times 250 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{year}} = 150000 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{year}} $$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed in hours. We convert minutes to hours by dividing by $60 \\text{ min/hr}$. Let $T_{annual, hr}$ be the annual time in hours.\n$$ T_{annual, hr} = \\frac{T_{annual}}{60} $$\n$$ T_{annual, hr} = \\frac{150000 \\text{ min}}{60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{hr}}} = 2500 \\text{ hr} $$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $2500$ unambiguously with three significant figures, we use scientific notation: $2.50 \\times 10^3$.\n\n**Part 2: Estimated Annual Revenue Lost**\n\nThe annual revenue loss is an opportunity cost resulting from clinician time being diverted from billable visits to PA activities. First, we determine the amount of clinician time that displaces billable visits. This is given as a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total annual PA time. Let this displaced time be $T_{displaced}$.\n$$ T_{displaced} = \\alpha \\times T_{annual} $$\nUsing the total annual time in minutes for dimensional consistency with the time per visit:\n$$ T_{displaced} = 0.20 \\times 150000 \\text{ min} = 30000 \\text{ min} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of billable visits lost, $N_{lost}$, by dividing the displaced time by the average time required for a single billable visit, $T_{visit}$.\n$$ N_{lost} = \\frac{T_{displaced}}{T_{visit}} $$\n$$ N_{lost} = \\frac{30000 \\text{ min}}{20 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{visit}}} = 1500 \\text{ visits} $$\n\nFinally, the estimated annual revenue lost, $L_{revenue}$, is the product of the number of lost visits and the average net revenue per visit, $R_{visit}$.\n$$ L_{revenue} = N_{lost} \\times R_{visit} $$\n$$ L_{revenue} = 1500 \\text{ visits} \\times 120 \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{visit}} = 180000 \\text{ dollars} $$\nThis result must also be reported to three significant figures. We express $180000$ in scientific notation to make the number of significant figures unambiguous: $1.80 \\times 10^5$.\n\nThe computed values are:\n- Total annual clinician time on PA: $2.50 \\times 10^3$ hours.\n- Estimated annual revenue lost: $1.80 \\times 10^5$ United States dollars.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2.50 \\times 10^{3} & 1.80 \\times 10^{5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4403566"}, {"introduction": "While effective UM aims to prevent denials, managing denials that do occur is a crucial function with a direct financial impact.

Assume the following foundational definitions and conditions: a denial rate is the probability that a submitted case yields no net revenue due to claim denial; for independent cases with identical revenue opportunity, the expected total revenue over $N$ cases equals $N$ times the expected revenue per case; and a denied case yields $0$ net revenue while an approved case yields a constant average net revenue $r$.

This final practice moves from process efficiency to the substance of decision-making by introducing cost-effectiveness analysis [@problem_id:4403541].

From the payer perspective, the device has an incremental cost of $\\$5{,}000$ relative to standard care and confers an expected incremental benefit of $0.06$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), where Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a standard measure of health benefit that weights life-years by health-related quality of life.

It is based on standard, formalizable principles of cost-effectiveness analysis within health economics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. We can therefore proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a decision rule for prior authorization and the calculation of the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). Let us define the relevant quantities symbolically.\nLet $\\Delta C$ represent the incremental cost of the new intervention relative to standard care.\nLet $\\Delta E$ represent the incremental effectiveness, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\nLet $\\lambda$ represent the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, expressed in dollars per QALY.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n$\\Delta C = \\$5,000$\n$\\Delta E = 0.06 \\text{ QALYs}$\n$\\lambda = \\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}$\n\nFirst, we derive the decision rule. The core metric in cost-effectiveness analysis is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental health benefit:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nA medical intervention is considered \"cost-effective\" and thus a candidate for approval if its ICER is less than or equal to the payer's willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$. This gives the decision rule for prior authorization:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\le \\lambda\n$$\nAn intervention should be approved if the cost per QALY gained does not exceed the maximum amount the plan is willing to pay for that QALY.\n\nNext, we compute the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The NMB is an alternative formulation of the decision rule that linearizes the relationship and expresses the value of an intervention in monetary terms. We can derive the NMB formula by rearranging the decision rule inequality. Given that the incremental benefit $\\Delta E$ is positive (as stated in the problem, $\\Delta E = 0.06 > 0$), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta E$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\le \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E\n$$\nRearranging this to bring all terms to one side yields:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C \\ge 0\n$$\nThe expression on the left-hand side is defined as the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB):\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe decision rule can now be expressed in terms of NMB: the intervention is cost-effective and should be approved if $\\text{NMB} \\ge 0$. The NMB represents the value of the intervention in monetary units, after accounting for its cost. A positive NMB indicates that the monetary value of the health gain exceeds the intervention's cost.\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the NMB formula to compute its value:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}) \\cdot (0.06 \\text{ QALYs}) - \\$5,000\n$$\nFirst, calculate the monetized incremental benefit, $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E = 100,000 \\cdot 0.06 = \\$6,000\n$$\nNow, subtract the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = \\$6,000 - \\$5,000 = \\$1,000\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures.
