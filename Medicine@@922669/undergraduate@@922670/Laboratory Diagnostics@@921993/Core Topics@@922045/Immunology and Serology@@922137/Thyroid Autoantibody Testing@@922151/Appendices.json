From method comparison against a commutable reference method, the assay shows a mean relative bias of $5\\%$ (absolute value).

The provided data and definitions are consistent with standard principles of quality management in clinical laboratory diagnostics. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and interpretation of the sigma metric ($\\sigma$) for an anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) immunoassay. The sigma metric is a quantitative measure of process quality, which in this context assesses the analytical performance of a laboratory test relative to its defined quality requirement.\n\nThe definition provided states that the sigma metric is \"the count of standard deviation units that can fit within the remaining error budget after accounting for systematic error, when all quantities are expressed on the same relative scale.\" This can be formalized into a mathematical expression.\n\nLet $TEa$ be the Total Allowable Error, which represents the total error budget.\nLet $|\\text{bias}|$ be the absolute value of the systematic error.\nLet $CV$ be the coefficient of variation, which represents the random error as a relative standard deviation.\n\nAll these quantities are given as percentages, so they are on the same relative scale.\n\nThe remaining error budget after accounting for systematic error is the difference between the total allowable error and the bias:\n$$\n\\text{Remaining Error Budget} = TEa - |\\text{bias}|\n$$\n\nThe size of one \"standard deviation unit\" in this relative scale is given by the $CV$.\n\nTherefore, the sigma metric, $\\sigma$, which is the number of these standard deviation units that fit into the remaining budget, is calculated by the formula:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{TEa - |\\text{bias}|}{CV}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Total Allowable Error, $TEa = 20\\%$\n- Absolute bias, $|\\text{bias}| = 5\\%$\n- Coefficient of Variation, $CV = 4\\%$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the sigma metric:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{20\\% - 5\\%}{4\\%}\n$$\nThe percentage units cancel out, yielding a unitless number:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value of $3.75$ already has exactly three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. In the framework of Six Sigma for laboratory quality management, the sigma metric is used to evaluate method performance and guide Quality Control (QC) strategy. The generally accepted performance benchmarks are:\n- $\\sigma \\ge 6$: World-class performance. Minimal QC is required (e.g., few control levels, wide control limits).\n- $5 \\le \\sigma < 6$: Excellent performance. Standard QC protocols are sufficient.\n- $4 \\le \\sigma < 5$: Good performance. Requires moderate QC strategies.\n- $3 \\le \\sigma < 4$: Marginal performance. The method is prone to producing errors that exceed the allowable limit. It requires intensified QC measures, such as using more control samples per run and applying more stringent statistical QC rules (e.g., multi-rule procedures like Westgard rules).\n- $\\sigma < 3$: Poor or unacceptable performance. The method is not stable enough for routine clinical use and should be improved or replaced.\n\nThe calculated sigma metric for the anti-Tg assay is $\\sigma = 3.75$. This value falls into the \"marginal\" performance category ($3 \\le \\sigma < 4$).\n\nTherefore, the method is not operationally ready for routine use with simple or minimal QC procedures. The marginal performance indicates a significant probability of reporting results with unacceptable error. To mitigate this risk, the laboratory should implement an intensified QC strategy. This would typically involve using more levels of QC material, increasing the frequency of QC runs, and/or employing a multi-rule QC procedure (e.g., using rules like $1_{3s}$, $2_{2s}$, $R_{4s}$, $4_{1s}$) to improve error detection. Alternatively, the laboratory should consider actions to improve the method's intrinsic performance, either by reducing its bias or its imprecision ($CV$) before placing it into routine service.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.75} $$", "id": "5238681"}, {"introduction": "After validating a test method, the laboratory must convert raw analytical signals into clinically meaningful results. This exercise focuses on a competitive immunoassay for Thyrotropin-Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins (TBII), where the signal is inversely proportional to the autoantibody concentration.

This is the absolute difference between the maximal signal ($S_{neg}$) and the observed sample signal ($S_{sample}$).\n$$\n\\text{Absolute Signal Decrease} = S_{neg} - S_{sample}\n$$\nNext, we formalize the \"fractional decrease... relative to the negative control.\" This is achieved by dividing the absolute signal decrease by the reference value, which is the negative control signal, $S_{neg}$.\nThis gives the formula for the inhibition index $I$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{S_{neg} - S_{sample}}{S_{neg}}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified to an alternative, equivalent form:\n$$\nI = \\frac{S_{neg}}{S_{neg}} - \\frac{S_{sample}}{S_{neg}} = 1 - \\frac{S_{sample}}{S_{neg}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula.\nGiven:\n$S_{sample} = 0.85$\n$S_{neg} = 1.00$\n\nUsing the formula:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1.00 - 0.85}{1.00} = \\frac{0.15}{1.00} = 0.15\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures.
