The problem specifies three prevalence values: $p_1 = 1\\% = 0.01$, $p_2 = 5\\% = 0.05$, and $p_3 = 20\\% = 0.20$.\n\nThe quantity to be determined is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient has the disease given that the test result is positive. Mathematically, this is the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nWe begin by applying Bayes' theorem to express the PPV:\n$$\nPPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly given: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ and $P(D) = p$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by marginalizing over the disease status (present or absent):\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nWe can express the terms in this expansion using the given definitions:\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ (Sensitivity)\n- $P(D) = p$ (Prevalence)\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual, also known as the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity. Since for a non-diseased individual the test can be either positive or negative, we have $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$. The specificity is $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - S_p$. For this problem, $1 - S_p = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (S_e)(p) + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expanded form of $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for the PPV:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the derived general expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the PPV for the given dsDNA assay at the three specified prevalences.

This requires the laboratory to establish a \"cutoff\" threshold to classify results, creating a necessary trade-off between correctly identifying those with the disease (sensitivity) and correctly clearing those without it (specificity).

The Trade-off Between Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nThe trade-off arises from the dependency of both metrics on the chosen cutoff value, $c$. Let us analyze the effect of changing $c$ from a value $c_1$ to a higher value $c_2$, such that $c_2 > c_1$.\n\nThe condition for a positive test is $I \\geq c$. If we increase the cutoff from $c_1$ to $c_2$, the condition for a positive test becomes stricter. Consequently, the set of patients with an index $I$ such that $I \\geq c_2$ is a subset of the set of patients for whom $I \\geq c_1$. This implies that fewer (or an equal number of) patients will test positive at the higher cutoff $c_2$ compared to the lower cutoff $c_1$.\n\nThis affects the counts of true positives and false positives:\n- The number of true positives at $c_2$, denoted $\\text{TP}(c_2)$, will be less than or equal to the number of true positives at $c_1$, denoted $\\text{TP}(c_1)$. That is, $\\text{TP}(c_2) \\leq \\text{TP}(c_1)$. Since sensitivity is directly proportional to $\\text{TP}$ (i.e., $\\text{Sensitivity} = \\text{TP}/N_{+}$), it follows that $\\text{Sensitivity}(c_2) \\leq \\text{Sensitivity}(c_1)$. Thus, increasing the cutoff tends to decrease sensitivity.\n\n- Similarly, the number of false positives at $c_2$, $\\text{FP}(c_2)$, will be less than or equal to the number of false positives at $c_1$, $\\text{FP}(c_1)$. That is, $\\text{FP}(c_2) \\leq \\text{FP}(c_1)$. Specificity is defined as $\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{N_{-} - \\text{FP}}{N_{-}}$. As $\\text{FP}$ decreases, the numerator $N_{-} - \\text{FP}$ increases, and therefore specificity increases. It follows that $\\text{Specificity}(c_2) \\geq \\text{Specificity}(c_1)$. Thus, increasing the cutoff tends to increase specificity.\n\nIn summary, increasing the cutoff value $c$ leads to a decrease in sensitivity and an increase in specificity. Conversely, decreasing the cutoff $c$ makes the test positive criterion less strict, leading to an increase in sensitivity and a decrease in specificity. This inverse relationship constitutes the fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic testing based on a continuous marker. The Youden index $J$ is a measure that attempts to find a balance in this trade-off.\n\n**2.

Determination of the Optimal Cutoff**\n\nThe optimal cutoff among the candidates is the one that maximizes the Youden index, $J$.
