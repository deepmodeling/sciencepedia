Let $T_+$ denote a positive test result. The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between pretest odds and post-test odds.\n\nThe pretest probability of infection is $P(I)$. The pretest odds of infection are defined as the ratio of the probability of infection to the probability of non-infection:\n$$Odds_{pre} = \\frac{P(I)}{P(I^c)} = \\frac{P(I)}{1 - P(I)}$$\n\nWe are given the test's sensitivity, $S = P(T_+ | I)$, and specificity, $C = P(T_- | I^c)$, where $T_-$ is a negative test result. From the definition of specificity, the probability of a positive test in an uninfected individual (the false positive rate) is $P(T_+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T_- | I^c) = 1 - C$.\n\nThe post-test probability, $P(I | T_+)$, is the probability of infection given a positive test result. According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(I | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+)}$$\nUsing the law of total probability, the denominator can be expanded:\n$$P(T_+) = P(T_+ | I) P(I) + P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)$$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$P(I | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+ | I) P(I) + P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)}$$\n\nThe post-test odds of infection are analogously defined as:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{P(I | T_+)}{P(I^c | T_+)}$$\nWe can find an expression for $P(I^c | T_+)$ using Bayes' theorem as well:\n$$P(I^c | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)}{P(T_+)}$$\nForming the ratio for the post-test odds, the common denominator $P(T_+)$ cancels:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)} = \\left( \\frac{P(T_+ | I)}{P(T_+ | I^c)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{P(I)}{P(I^c)} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and pretest odds, we get:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\left( \\frac{S}{1 - C} \\right) Odds_{pre}$$\nThe term $\\frac{S}{1-C}$ is the Positive Likelihood Ratio, denoted $LR_+$. Thus, the rule for updating odds is $Odds_{post} = LR_+ \\cdot Odds_{pre}$. This completes the required derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the given problem.

A common and effective dilution series is $1:10$, $1:100$, and $1:1000$. These dilutions are typically made using the assay-specific diluent buffer. Each diluted sample, along with the neat (undiluted) sample, is then re-assayed.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The results from the diluted samples are interpreted as follows:\n    *   If all dilutions and the neat sample remain nonreactive, the original result is confirmed as a true negative.\n    *   If one or more of the dilutions become reactive (positive), the prozone effect is confirmed. Typically, the signal (e.g., optical density) will increase as the sample is diluted from neat to $1:10$ or $1:100$, and then will decrease at higher dilutions ($1:1000$) as the antigen concentration falls below the assay's lower limit of detection.\n3.  **Quantification:** To report a final quantitative result, the scientist must select the dilution that provides a signal within the assay's quantifiable range (i.e., between the lower and upper limits of quantification, LLOQ and ULOQ). The concentration value obtained from the assay's calibration curve for this dilution, $c_{\\mathrm{measured}}$, is then multiplied by the dilution factor to determine the concentration in the original sample, $c_{\\mathrm{final}}$. For instance, if the $1:100$ dilution yields a measured concentration of $c_{\\mathrm{measured}}$, the final reported concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{final}} = c_{\\mathrm{measured}} \\times 100$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal dilution factor, $F$, required to bring the sample concentration below the prozone-suppressing regime.\nFirst, we convert the mass concentration of p24 in the undiluted plasma, $c_{\\mathrm{p24}}$, to a molar concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$.\nGiven: $c_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 1.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 24{,}000 \\, \\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 1.0 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 1.0 \\, \\frac{10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{g}}{10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{L}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{p24}}}{M_{\\mathrm{p24}}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}}{24{,}000 \\, \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mol}} = \\frac{1.0}{24 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^3} \\, \\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L} = \\frac{1}{24} \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}} \\approx 4.1667 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M} = 41.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the critical antigen concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, using the derived formula and the given parameters $K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} = 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ and $t=0.05$.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} \\frac{1-t}{t} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\frac{1 - 0.05}{0.05} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\frac{0.95}{0.05} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM})(19) = 38 \\, \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nThe minimal dilution factor $F$ is a factor that reduces the sample concentration to be at or below this critical value:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{F} \\le [\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nThus, the minimal dilution factor $F$ is:\n$$\nF \\ge \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{41.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{38 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} \\approx 1.0965\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal dilution factor is $F = 1.10$. This means even a slight dilution is sufficient to begin to alleviate the hook effect under these specific conditions. For example, a $1:2$ dilution would be more than adequate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.10}\n$$", "id": "5229416"}]}
