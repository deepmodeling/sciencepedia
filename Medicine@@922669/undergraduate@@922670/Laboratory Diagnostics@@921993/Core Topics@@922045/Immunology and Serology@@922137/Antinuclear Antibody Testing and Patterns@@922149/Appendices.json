The use of HEp-2 cells, the dilution series format ($1:40$ screen followed by two-fold titrations), and the definition of a titer are all standard and factually correct within the field of laboratory diagnostics.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data ($C_0$, dilution steps) and definitions to compute the two required values.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution requires two calculations: the total dilution factor to find the final concentration, and the identification of the highest positive dilution to determine the titer.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total dilution factor, denoted by $D$. In a serial dilution, the total dilution factor is the product of the individual dilution factors of each step. The protocol involves an initial $1:40$ dilution, followed by four subsequent $1:2$ dilutions.\n\nThe dilution factor for the screening step is $40$.\nThe dilution factor for each of the four subsequent steps is $2$.\n\nThus, the total dilution factor $D$ is:\n$$D = 40 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 40 \\times 2^4$$\nCalculating the value of $2^4$:\n$$2^4 = 16$$\nSo, the total dilution factor is:\n$$D = 40 \\times 16 = 640$$\nThis means the final solution is a $1$ in $640$ dilution of the original sample.\n\nNext, we calculate the final IgG concentration, $C_f$, using the provided formula $C_f = \\frac{C_0}{D}$.\nThe initial concentration is given as $C_0 = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. We just calculated the total dilution factor as $D = 640$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$C_f = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}}{640}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the exact final concentration:\n$$C_f = \\frac{1}{320}\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$$\n\nFinally, we determine the ANA titer denominator. The problem states that the titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution that still yields a detectable fluorescence pattern. It is explicitly given that the pattern is \"detectable at each dilution up to and including the last applied dilution.\" The last applied dilution corresponds to the total dilution factor, $D = 640$.\nTherefore, the highest positive dilution is $1:640$.\nThe problem asks for the ANA titer denominator, which for a titer of $1:640$ is the number $640$.\n\nThe two requested values are the final IgG concentration in $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$, which is $\\frac{1}{320}$, and the ANA titer denominator, which is $640$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{320} & 640\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5206287"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting an antinuclear antibody (ANA) pattern is more than just matching a picture in an atlas; it is an exercise in diagnostic reasoning based on cell biology.

It asks for a logical inference based on this information, which leads to a single best answer among the options.\n- **Objective**: The language is objective and descriptive. The pattern is described using precise localization terms (\"within nucleoli,\" \"on condensed chromosomes\"), avoiding subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors. It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe identity of the target antigen class can be deduced by systematically comparing the observed immunofluorescence pattern with the known behavior of different cellular components during the cell cycle, as outlined in the problem's context.\n\n$1$. **Interphase Localization**: The signal is described as intense and restricted to the nucleoli. The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment primarily responsible for ribosome biogenesis. This observation strongly implies that the target antigen is a constituent of the nucleolus.\n\n$2$. **Mitotic Localization**: During mitosis, the signal is absent from the condensed chromosomes. The problem's context explicitly states that the nucleolus disassembles during prophase and its protein constituents redistribute, not remaining associated with the condensed chromatin. This behavior is a key distinguishing feature.\n\n$3$. **Synthesis**: The antigen must be a molecule that is ($i$) localized within the nucleolus during interphase and ($ii$) becomes dispersed and does not co-localize with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis. The molecules that fit this description are the functional components of the nucleolus itself, such as the proteins and ribonucleoproteins involved in rRNA transcription, processing, and ribosome assembly.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Double-stranded DNA and histone-associated chromatin proteins**\n- **Analysis**: These antigens are the primary components of chromatin, which is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm in interphase cells. Antibodies to these targets would produce a diffuse or homogeneous staining of the entire nucleus, not a pattern restricted to the nucleoli. Crucially, as chromatin condenses to form chromosomes during mitosis, these antigens remain integral to the chromosome structure. Therefore, this class of antigens would result in strong staining of the metaphase chromosomes.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The predicted pattern (homogeneous nuclear staining, positive mitotic chromosomes) is inconsistent with the observed pattern (nucleolar staining, negative mitotic chromosomes).\n\n**B. Nucleolar ribonucleoproteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and transcriptional machinery of the nucleolar organizer regions**\n- **Analysis**: This class of molecules is, by definition, located within the nucleolus during interphase, where they perform their functions related to ribosome biogenesis. This matches the interphase observation perfectly. As stated in the provided context and known from cell biology, the nucleolus disassembles during mitosis, and these functional proteins disperse. They do not remain bound to the condensed chromosomes. This behavior perfectly matches the mitotic observation. Examples of such antigens include fibrillarin, U3-RNP, RNA polymerase $\\mathrm{I}$, and PM/Scl.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. The localization and mitotic behavior of this antigen class are in complete agreement with the described immunofluorescence pattern.\n\n**C. Nuclear envelope structural proteins such as lamins and nuclear pore complex components**\n- **Analysis**: These proteins are localized to the boundary of the nucleus. Antibodies against them would produce a peripheral or \"rim-like\" staining pattern in interphase cells. While these proteins do disperse during nuclear envelope breakdown in mitosis and do not stain the condensed chromosomes, their interphase pattern is fundamentally different from the observed nucleolar pattern.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The interphase pattern does not match the observation.\n\n**D. Centromere and kinetochore proteins within the CENP family**\n- **Analysis**: Centromeres are specific domains within chromatin. In interphase, antibodies against centromere proteins (e.g., CENP-B) produce a pattern of $40-60$ discrete speckles throughout the nucleus. During mitosis, these proteins remain at the centromeric constriction of each condensed chromosome, leading to a highly characteristic pattern of paired dots aligned at the metaphase plate.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Both the interphase pattern (speckled, not nucleolar) and the mitotic pattern (positive dots on chromosomes, not negative) are inconsistent with the observations.\n\n**E. Cytoplasmic microtubule-associated proteins**\n- **Analysis**: These proteins are located in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. An autoantibody targeting these antigens would produce a cytoplasmic staining pattern, which might show a fibrillar or diffuse signal throughout the cytoplasm. It would not produce a pattern restricted to the nucleoli within the nucleus.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.

We begin with the definition of conditional probability, which is the foundation of Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D\\mid +) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}\n$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap +)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(+\\mid D)$:\n$$\nP(+\\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(D)}\n$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\nP(D \\cap +) = P(+\\mid D) P(D)\n$$\nHere, $P(+\\mid D)$ is the sensitivity of the test, and $P(D)$ is the prevalence of the disease.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. According to the law of total probability, this can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: a true positive (testing positive with the disease) and a false positive (testing positive without the disease).\n$$\nP(+) = P(+\\mid D)P(D) + P(+\\mid \\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})\n$$\nWe need to express the terms in this expansion using the given quantities.\n- $P(+\\mid D)$ is the sensitivity.\n- $P(D)$ is the prevalence.\n- $P(\\bar{D})$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is complementary to the prevalence: $P(\\bar{D}) = 1 - P(D)$.\n- $P(+\\mid \\bar{D})$ is the false positive rate. This is complementary to the specificity, $P(-\\mid \\bar{D})$, since a subject without the disease can either test positive or negative. Thus:\n$$\nP(+\\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - P(-\\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - \\text{specificity}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})\n$$\nNow, we assemble the complete expression for the positive predictive value, $P(D\\mid +)$:\n$$\nP(D\\mid +) = \\frac{P(+\\mid D)P(D)}{P(+\\mid D)P(D) + (1 - P(-\\mid \\bar{D}))(1 - P(D))}\n$$\nLet's denote sensitivity as $S_e$, specificity as $S_p$, and prevalence as $P_r$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{S_e \\cdot P_r}{S_e \\cdot P_r + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - P_r)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the positive predictive value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- Sensitivity, $S_e = 0.90$\n- Specificity, $S_p = 0.85$\n- Prevalence, $P_r = 0.10$\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of not having the disease and the false positive rate:\n- $1 - P_r = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n- $1 - S_p = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n\nNow, substitute these into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90) \\cdot (0.10)}{(0.90) \\cdot (0.10) + (0.15) \\cdot (0.90)}\n$$\nCalculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $(0.90) \\cdot (0.10) = 0.09$\n- Denominator, first term: $(0.90) \\cdot (0.10) = 0.09$\n- Denominator, second term: $(0.15) \\cdot (0.90) = 0.135$\n\nSum the terms in the denominator:\n$$\nP(+) = 0.09 + 0.135 = 0.225\n$$\nFinally, calculate the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.09}{0.225}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{90}{225} = \\frac{2 \\times 45}{5 \\times 45} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = 0.4000\n$$\nThis result signifies that for a patient selected from this population who tests positive with an ANA titer of $1:160$, there is a $40\\%$ probability that they actually have one of the systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4000}\n$$", "id": "5206293"}]}
