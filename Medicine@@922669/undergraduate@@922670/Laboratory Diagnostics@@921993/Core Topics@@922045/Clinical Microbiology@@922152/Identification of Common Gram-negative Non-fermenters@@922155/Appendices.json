Let Ox+ and Ox- be the events of a positive and negative oxidase test result, respectively. Let MALDI be the event that MALDI-TOF MS is performed.\n\nThe given prior probabilities are:\n$P(\\text{PA}) = 0.55$\n$P(\\text{AB}) = 0.45$\n\nThe conditional probabilities for the oxidase test are:\n$P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{PA}) = 0.98$\n$P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{AB}) = 0.05$\nFrom this, we can derive the probabilities for a negative result:\n$P(\\text{Ox-}|\\text{PA}) = 1 - P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{PA}) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n$P(\\text{Ox-}|\\text{AB}) = 1 - P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{AB}) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$\n\nThe costs and time parameters are:\nMonetary cost of oxidase test: $C_M(\\text{Ox}) = \\$15$\nTurnaround time of oxidase test: $T(\\text{Ox}) = 0.25$ hours\nMonetary cost of MALDI-TOF MS: $C_M(\\text{MALDI}) = \\$150$\nTurnaround time of MALDI-TOF MS: $T(\\text{MALDI}) = 1.5$ hours\nProbability of misidentification by MALDI-TOF MS: $P(\\text{_misID_}|\\text{MALDI}) = 0.03$\nTime penalty cost rate: $C_T = \\$250$ per hour\nMisidentification risk cost: $C_{risk} = \\$4000$\n\nThe total expected cost for any policy, $E[C_{\\text{total}}]$, is the sum of the expected monetary cost $E[C_M]$, the expected time penalty cost $E[C_T]$, and the expected misidentification risk cost $E[C_{risk}]$.\n$$E[C_{\\text{total}}] = E[C_M] + E[C_T] + E[C_{risk}]$$\nThe reporting rules are: if MALDI is used, its result is definitive. If only oxidase is used, Ox+ implies a report of PA, and Ox- implies a report of AB.\n\nThe marginal probabilities of the oxidase test results are:\n$P(\\text{Ox+}) = P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{PA})P(\\text{PA}) + P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{AB})P(\\text{AB}) = (0.98)(0.55) + (0.05)(0.45) = 0.539 + 0.0225 = 0.5615$\n$P(\\text{Ox-}) = 1 - P(\\text{Ox+}) = 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385$\n\nNow, we calculate the expected total cost for each of the five policies.\n\n**Policy 1: Perform MALDI-TOF MS for all specimens without oxidase.**\n- $E[C_M] = C_M(\\text{MALDI}) = \\$150$.\n- $E[C_T] = T(\\text{MALDI}) \\times C_T = 1.5 \\times \\$250 = \\$375$.\n- $E[C_{risk}] = P(\\text{_misID_}|\\text{MALDI}) \\times C_{risk} = 0.03 \\times \\$4000 = \\$120$.\n- Total Expected Cost ($E[C_1]$): $E[C_1] = \\$150 + \\$375 + \\$120 = \\$645$.\n\n**Policy 2: Perform oxidase only.**\n- $E[C_M] = C_M(\\text{Ox}) = \\$15$.\n- $E[C_T] = T(\\text{Ox}) \\times C_T = 0.25 \\times \\$250 = \\$62.50$.\n- Misidentification occurs if the organism is PA but the test is Ox- (reported as AB), or if the organism is AB but the test is Ox+ (reported as PA).\n  $P(\\text{_misID_}) = P(\\text{Ox-}, \\text{PA}) + P(\\text{Ox+}, \\text{AB}) = P(\\text{Ox-}|\\text{PA})P(\\text{PA}) + P(\\text{Ox+}|\\text{AB})P(\\text{AB})$\n  $P(\\text{_misID_}) = (0.02)(0.55) + (0.05)(0.45) = 0.011 + 0.0225 = 0.0335$.\n  $E[C_{risk}] = P(\\text{_misID_}) \\times C_{risk} = 0.0335 \\times \\$4000 = \\$134$.\n- Total Expected Cost ($E[C_2]$): $E[C_2] = \\$15 + \\$62.50 + \\$134 = \\$211.50$.\n\n**Policy 3: Perform oxidase first, then MALDI-TOF MS conditional on oxidase-positive.**\n- $E[C_M] = C_M(\\text{Ox}) + P(\\text{Ox+}) \\times C_M(\\text{MALDI}) = \\$15 + (0.5615) \\times \\$150 = \\$15 + \\$84.225 = \\$99.225$.\n- $E[T] = P(\\text{Ox-}) \\times T(\\text{Ox}) + P(\\text{Ox+}) \\times (T(\\text{Ox}) + T(\\text{MALDI})) = (0.4385)(0.25) + (0.5615)(1.75) = 0.109625 + 0.982625 = 1.09225$ hours.\n  $E[C_T] = 1.09225 \\times \\$250 = \\$273.0625$.\n- Misidentification occurs if the path is Ox- and the organism is PA (reported as AB), or if the path is Ox+ and the MALDI is incorrect.\n  $P(\\text{_misID_}) = P(\\text{Ox-}, \\text{PA}) + P(\\text{Ox+}) \\times P(\\text{_misID_}|\\text{MALDI}) = (0.02)(0.55) + (0.5615)(0.03) = 0.011 + 0.016845 = 0.027845$.\n  $E[C_{risk}] = 0.027845 \\times \\$4000 = \\$111.38$.\n- Total Expected Cost ($E[C_3]$): $E[C_3] = \\$99.225 + \\$273.0625 + \\$111.38 = \\$483.6675$.\n\n**Policy 4: Perform oxidase first, then MALDI-TOF MS conditional on oxidase-negative.**\n- $E[C_M] = C_M(\\text{Ox}) + P(\\text{Ox-}) \\times C_M(\\text{MALDI}) = \\$15 + (0.4385) \\times \\$150 = \\$15 + \\$65.775 = \\$80.775$.\n- $E[T] = P(\\text{Ox+}) \\times T(\\text{Ox}) + P(\\text{Ox-}) \\times (T(\\text{Ox}) + T(\\text{MALDI})) = (0.5615)(0.25) + (0.4385)(1.75) = 0.140375 + 0.767375 = 0.90775$ hours.\n  $E[C_T] = 0.90775 \\times \\$250 = \\$226.9375$.\n- Misidentification occurs if the path is Ox+ and the organism is AB (reported as PA), or if the path is Ox- and the MALDI is incorrect.\n  $P(\\text{_misID_}) = P(\\text{Ox+}, \\text{AB}) + P(\\text{Ox-}) \\times P(\\text{_misID_}|\\text{MALDI}) = (0.05)(0.45) + (0.4385)(0.03) = 0.0225 + 0.013155 = 0.035655$.\n  $E[C_{risk}] = 0.035655 \\times \\$4000 = \\$142.62$.\n- Total Expected Cost ($E[C_4]$): $E[C_4] = \\$80.775 + \\$226.9375 + \\$142.62 = \\$450.3325$.\n\n**Policy 5: Perform oxidase first and then perform MALDI-TOF MS in all cases.**\n- $E[C_M] = C_M(\\text{Ox}) + C_M(\\text{MALDI}) = \\$15 + \\$150 = \\$165$.\n- $T_{total} = T(\\text{Ox}) + T(\\text{MALDI}) = 0.25 + 1.5 = 1.75$ hours.\n  $E[C_T] = 1.75 \\times \\$250 = \\$437.50$.\n- $E[C_{risk}] = P(\\text{_misID_}|\\text{MALDI}) \\times C_{risk} = 0.03 \\times \\$4000 = \\$120$.\n- Total Expected Cost ($E[C_5]$): $E[C_5] = \\$165 + \\$437.50 + \\$120 = \\$722.50$.\n\nComparing the total expected costs:\n$E[C_1] = \\$645.00$\n$E[C_2] = \\$211.50$\n$E[C_3] \\approx \\$483.67$\n$E[C_4] \\approx \\$450.33$\n$E[C_5] = \\$722.50$\n\nThe minimal expected total cost is $E[C_2] = \\$211.50$.
