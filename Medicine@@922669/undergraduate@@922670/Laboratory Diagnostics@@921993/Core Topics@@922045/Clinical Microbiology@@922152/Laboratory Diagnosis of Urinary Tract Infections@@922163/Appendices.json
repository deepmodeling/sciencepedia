During incubation, a swarming phenotype consistent with Proteus species spreads across the plate, making later quadrants confluent and unreadable. The earliest quadrant unaffected by swarming, Quadrant $2$, shows discrete colonies that can be counted reliably, with $67$ visible colonies. The laboratory has previously validated the streaking protocol and determined that, in the absence of swarming, the fraction of the originally plated cells that are deposited as isolated colonies in Quadrants $1$ through $4$ are $f_1 = 0.60$, $f_2 = 0.25$, $f_3 = 0.10$, and $f_4 = 0.05$, respectively.
