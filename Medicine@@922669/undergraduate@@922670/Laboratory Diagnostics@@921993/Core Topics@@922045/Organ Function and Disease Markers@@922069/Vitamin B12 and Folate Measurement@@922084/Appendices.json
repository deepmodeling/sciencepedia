A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core principle is the conservation of the amount of folate. For a given volume of whole blood, $V_{\\text{total}}$, the total amount of folate, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the amount of folate in the red blood cell (RBC) compartment, $A_{\\text{RBC}}$, and the amount in the plasma compartment, $A_{\\text{plasma}}$.\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{RBC}} + A_{\\text{plasma}}$$\nThe amount of a substance in a given volume is the product of its concentration and that volume. Let $[\\text{WB folate}]$, $[\\text{RBC folate}]$, and $[\\text{Plasma folate}]$ represent the folate concentrations in whole blood, RBCs, and plasma, respectively.\nThe total amount of folate is:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{WB folate}] \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\nThe volume of the RBC compartment, $V_{\\text{RBC}}$, and the plasma compartment, $V_{\\text{plasma}}$, are defined by the hematocrit, $Hct$:\n$$V_{\\text{RBC}} = Hct \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{plasma}} = (1 - Hct) \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\nThe amounts of folate in the RBC and plasma compartments are therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{RBC}} = [\\text{RBC folate}] \\cdot V_{\\text{RBC}} = [\\text{RBC folate}] \\cdot Hct \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$A_{\\text{plasma}} = [\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot V_{\\text{plasma}} = [\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot (1 - Hct) \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the initial conservation equation:\n$$[\\text{WB folate}] \\cdot V_{\\text{total}} = ([\\text{RBC folate}] \\cdot Hct \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}) + ([\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot (1 - Hct) \\cdot V_{\\text{total}})$$\nSince $V_{\\text{total}}$ is a common, non-zero factor in all terms, it can be cancelled from the equation. This yields the relationship between the concentrations:\n$$[\\text{WB folate}] = [\\text{RBC folate}] \\cdot Hct + [\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot (1 - Hct)$$\nThe problem requires an expression for $[\\text{RBC folate}]$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this term. First, we isolate the term containing $[\\text{RBC folate}]$:\n$$[\\text{RBC folate}] \\cdot Hct = [\\text{WB folate}] - [\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot (1 - Hct)$$\nAssuming $Hct \\neq 0$ (which is a biological necessity), we can divide by $Hct$ to obtain the final derived expression:\n$$[\\text{RBC folate}] = \\frac{[\\text{WB folate}] - [\\text{Plasma folate}] \\cdot (1 - Hct)}{Hct}$$\nThis is the general formula for RBC folate concentration.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to calculate the specific concentration:\n- $[\\text{WB folate}] = 500 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$\n- $[\\text{Plasma folate}] = 15 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$\n- $Hct = 0.40$\n\n$$[\\text{RBC folate}] = \\frac{500 - 15 \\cdot (1 - 0.40)}{0.40}$$\nFirst, evaluate the term in the parentheses:\n$$1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\nNext, calculate the product in the numerator:\n$$15 \\cdot 0.60 = 9$$\nNow, complete the subtraction in the numerator:\n$$500 - 9 = 491$$\nFinally, perform the division:\n$$[\\text{RBC folate}] = \\frac{491}{0.40} = 1227.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $1227.5$ has five significant figures. The first three are $1$, $2$, and $2$. The fourth digit is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the third digit.\n$$1227.5 \\approx 1230$$\nTo express this unambiguously with three significant figures, scientific notation is used.\n$$1230 = 1.23 \\times 10^3$$\nThus, the calculated RBC folate concentration, rounded to three significant figures, is $1.23 \\times 10^3$ ng/mL of packed red blood cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.23 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "5239975"}, {"introduction": "The concentration of analytes in a random urine sample can be misleading due to variations in patient hydration.
