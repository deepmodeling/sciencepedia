We can use equation $(1)$ and rearrange it to solve for $b$:\n$$b = A_1 - mC_1$$\nSubstituting the known values for $A_1$, $C_1$, and the calculated value for $m$:\n$$b = 0.034 - (0.056)(0.50)$$\n$$b = 0.034 - 0.028 = 0.006$$\nThe intercept $b$ has units of absorbance.\n\nThus, the complete calibration equation for this enzymatic assay is:\n$$A = 0.056 \\cdot C + 0.006$$\n\nNow, we use this equation to determine the creatinine concentration $C_s$ of the patient sample, given its measured absorbance $A_s = 0.196$.\n$$A_s = mC_s + b$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $C_s$:\n$$mC_s = A_s - b$$\n$$C_s = \\frac{A_s - b}{m}$$\nSubstituting the values for $A_s$, $m$, and $b$:\n$$C_s = \\frac{0.196 - 0.006}{0.056}$$\n$$C_s = \\frac{0.190}{0.056}$$\n$$C_s \\approx 3.39285714... \\text{ mg/dL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
