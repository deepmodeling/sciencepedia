[@problem_id:5236563]", "problem": "A patient with a urinary tract infection is started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Two days later, routine laboratory tests show an increase in plasma creatinine concentration, denoted $P_{cr}$, from $0.90$ mg/dL to $1.10$ mg/dL, while Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) remains at $14$ mg/dL. Urine output is unchanged, and urinalysis is unremarkable. Vital signs are stable, and there is no clinical evidence of volume depletion. The patient’s medications and diet are otherwise unchanged, and there is no muscle injury. You are asked to reason from fundamental definitions in renal physiology and laboratory diagnostics: at steady state, endogenous solute concentrations reflect the balance between production and excretion, where excretion consists of filtration at the glomerulus plus any tubular secretion minus any tubular reabsorption. Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per unit time.

Trimethoprim inhibits proximal tubular creatinine secretion, reducing secretory contribution to creatinine excretion without changing filtration, so $P_{cr}$ rises while BUN remains stable; verify filtration by obtaining serum cystatin C to compute a cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate and, if needed for higher precision, measure GFR directly using an exogenous filtration marker such as iohexol plasma clearance or inulin clearance.\n\nB.

The rise in $P_{cr}$ reflects increased creatinine production from muscle breakdown induced by infection and antibiotics; verify this by checking creatine kinase and urine myoglobin, and confirm renal function by noting that cystatin C should rise in parallel with $P_{cr}$ if GFR is stable.\n\nD. The rise in $P_{cr}$ most likely reflects acute interstitial nephritis from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; confirm with immediate renal biopsy and eosinophiluria testing, and note that cystatin C would be expected to remain unchanged even if GFR has fallen modestly.\n\nChoose the single best option.", "solution": "Let us analyze the steady-state balance for creatinine ($cr$) and urea. At steady state, the rate of production of a solute equals its rate of excretion.\n\n**For Creatinine ($cr$):**\nCreatinine is produced from creatine phosphate in muscle at a relatively constant rate. The problem statement specifies \"no muscle injury\" and \"diet... unchanged,\" so we can assume the production rate of creatinine, Prod$_{cr}$, is constant.\n\nThe total excretion rate of creatinine (Excr$_{cr}$) is the sum of the rate of glomerular filtration and the rate of tubular secretion.

Since Prod$_{cr}$ is constant, the total excretion rate, $\\text{Excr}_{cr}$, must also be the same at the new steady state as it was at the old one.

If GFR itself is unchanged, $P_{cr}$ must rise.\n\n**For Urea (BUN):**\nUrea is the end product of protein metabolism. The problem states the patient's diet is unchanged, so we assume its production rate, Prod$_{BUN}$, is constant.\n\nThe excretion of urea involves glomerular filtration and significant, variable tubular reabsorption.

This would cause *both* $P_{cr}$ and BUN to rise. The fact that BUN is stable at $14$ mg/dL argues strongly against a significant decrease in GFR. Conditions that reduce GFR, such as prerenal azotemia (ruled out by \"no volume depletion\") or intrinsic kidney disease (like acute interstitial nephritis, AIN), would be expected to elevate BUN.\n- This leaves Hypothesis 2 as the most plausible explanation: an isolated decrease in creatinine secretion. The drug trimethoprim is a known competitive inhibitor of the organic cation transporters (specifically OCT2) in the proximal tubule, which are responsible for secreting creatinine from the blood into the tubular fluid. By inhibiting this pathway, trimethoprim reduces the overall clearance of creatinine without affecting GFR. To maintain a constant total excretion rate (equal to the constant production rate), the plasma concentration $P_{cr}$ must rise to increase the amount of creatinine that is filtered. This phenomenon is a well-known \"pseudo-nephrotoxicity\" because it raises $P_{cr}$ without a true decline in GFR.\n\n**Verification Plan:**\nSince $P_{cr}$ is now a confounded measure of GFR, an alternative method is needed to assess true renal filtration function.\n1.  **Use an alternative endogenous marker:** Cystatin C is a small protein produced by all nucleated cells at a constant rate. It is freely filtered by the glomerulus and is not secreted. Its serum concentration is therefore inversely proportional to the GFR and is not affected by muscle mass, diet, or drugs that inhibit tubular secretion of creatinine. A cystatin C-based eGFR calculation would provide a more accurate estimate of the true GFR in this situation. If GFR is truly unchanged, the serum cystatin C level should be stable.\n2.  **Use an exogenous filtration marker:** For the highest level of precision (a \"gold standard\" measurement), one can measure the clearance of an exogenous substance that is handled exclusively by glomerular filtration (i.e., not secreted or reabsorbed). Examples include inulin, iohexol, or iothalamate. The clearance of such a marker is by definition equal to the GFR. This provides a direct and unconfounded measurement.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**A. Trimethoprim inhibits proximal tubular creatinine secretion, reducing secretory contribution to creatinine excretion without changing filtration, so $P_{cr}$ rises while BUN remains stable; verify filtration by obtaining serum cystatin C to compute a cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate and, if needed for higher precision, measure GFR directly using an exogenous filtration marker such as iohexol plasma clearance or inulin clearance.**\n- **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies the known pharmacological mechanism of trimethoprim's effect on creatinine handling. It accurately explains why $P_{cr}$ rises while BUN remains stable, which is the key feature of the clinical presentation. The proposed verification plan is scientifically rigorous and appropriate. It correctly suggests using cystatin C as an alternative endogenous marker and mentions the gold-standard methods (iohexol/inulin clearance) for definitive measurement.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The rise in $P_{cr}$ indicates prerenal azotemia due to mild hypovolemia; verify a true fall in filtration by calculating the BUN to creatinine ratio, which should increase markedly, and if it does not, proceed with intravenous fluids and repeat creatinine only.**\n- **Analysis:** This explanation is contradicted by the problem data. The patient has no clinical evidence of volume depletion, and vital signs and urine output are stable. Furthermore, in prerenal azotemia, BUN typically rises more than creatinine, leading to an increased BUN:$P_{cr}$ ratio (often $> 20$). Here, the ratio decreased from $14/0.90 \\approx 15.6$ to $14/1.10 \\approx 12.7$. The proposed plan is therefore based on a false premise.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The rise in $P_{cr}$ reflects increased creatinine production from muscle breakdown induced by infection and antibiotics; verify this by checking creatine kinase and urine myoglobin, and confirm renal function by noting that cystatin C should rise in parallel with $P_{cr}$ if GFR is stable.**\n- **Analysis:** This is contradicted by the problem statement \"no muscle injury\". More importantly, the verification plan contains a fundamental error in physiology. If GFR is stable, an increase in $P_{cr}$ due to overproduction would *not* be accompanied by a rise in cystatin C. Cystatin C production is independent of muscle mass. If both markers were to rise, it would imply a true fall in GFR, not stable GFR.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The rise in $P_{cr}$ most likely reflects acute interstitial nephritis from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; confirm with immediate renal biopsy and eosinophiluria testing, and note that cystatin C would be expected to remain unchanged even if GFR has fallen modestly.**\n- **Analysis:** Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) would cause a true fall in GFR, which would be expected to raise both BUN and $P_{cr}$. The stable BUN makes this diagnosis less likely than the one in option A. The urinalysis is also \"unremarkable,\" which argues against AIN (though not definitively). A renal biopsy is an invasive procedure and not warranted as a first step here. Most critically, the statement that \"cystatin C would be expected to remain unchanged even if GFR has fallen\" is factually incorrect. Cystatin C concentration is inversely proportional to GFR; if GFR falls, cystatin C concentration must rise.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5236563"}]}
