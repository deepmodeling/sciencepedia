In laboratory diagnostics, the CK-MB relative index is used to normalize organ-specific CK-MB release to the overall CK burden to help distinguish myocardial from skeletal muscle sources, given that skeletal muscle contains predominantly creatine kinase muscle-type subunits (CK-MM) whereas myocardium contains a higher fraction of CK-MB.

The problem provides the total creatine kinase (CK) activity and the mass concentration of the CK-MB isoenzyme.\n\nIn laboratory medicine, the CK-MB relative index, let's denote it as $I_R$, is a calculated parameter used to improve the diagnostic specificity of CK-MB for myocardial injury. It normalizes the CK-MB concentration to the total CK activity. The standard formula for this index, when CK-MB is measured by a mass immunoassay and expressed in ng/mL, and total CK activity is in U/L, is:\n$$\nI_R = \\frac{C_{\\text{CK-MB}}}{A_{\\text{CK,total}}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{CK-MB}}$ is the mass concentration of CK-MB in units of ng/mL and $A_{\\text{CK,total}}$ is the total CK activity in units of U/L. Conventionally, this ratio is often multiplied by $100$ to be expressed as a percentage. However, the problem explicitly requests the result as a decimal fraction.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Total CK activity, $A_{\\text{CK,total}} = 360 \\text{ U/L}$.\n- CK-MB mass concentration, $C_{\\text{CK-MB}} = 14 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the relative index:\n$$\nI_R = \\frac{14}{360}\n$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$\nI_R = 0.038888...\n$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $8$, $8$, and $8$. The fifth significant digit is $8$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$\nI_R \\approx 0.03889\n$$\nThis is the calculated CK-MB relative index as a decimal fraction.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The relative index helps to distinguish between myocardial and skeletal muscle sources of elevated total CK.\n- Myocardial tissue has a significantly higher proportion of the CK-MB isoenzyme (approximately $15\\%$ to $20\\%$ of its total CK) compared to skeletal muscle (typically $ 5\\%$).\n- In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), damaged cardiac myocytes release their contents, including CK-MB, into the bloodstream. This leads to a substantial increase in both total CK and CK-MB, resulting in a high relative index.\n- In cases of extensive skeletal muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis), the total CK can be extremely high (often much higher than in AMI), but since skeletal muscle is poor in CK-MB, the relative index remains low.\n\nStandard interpretive thresholds for the relative index (expressed as a percentage) are:\n- $I_R (\\text{in } \\%)  3.0\\%$: Suggestive of a skeletal muscle source.\n- $I_R (\\text{in } \\%)  5.0\\%$: Highly suggestive of a myocardial source.\n- $3.0\\% \\le I_R (\\text{in } \\%) \\le 5.0\\%$: A grey zone, which may indicate minor myocardial injury, concomitant skeletal and cardiac muscle injury, or certain other conditions. However, values in this range, particularly in the context of acute retrosternal pain, increase the suspicion for a cardiac etiology.\n\nOur calculated relative index as a decimal fraction is $0.03889$. To compare with the standard percentage thresholds, we multiply by $100$:\n$$\nI_R (\\text{in } \\%) = 0.03889 \\times 100 = 3.889\\%\n$$\nThis value of $3.889\\%$ falls into the intermediate or \"grey\" zone, but it is clearly above the typical cutoff of $3.0\\%$ used to rule out a primary skeletal muscle source. Given the clinical presentation of acute retrosternal pain, a relative index of $3.889\\%$ significantly raises the likelihood of an acute myocardial event. Therefore, the source is more likely myocardial than skeletal muscle.

Calculation of the Composite Diagnostic Score ($D$)**\n\nThe score $D$ is defined by the following logical conditions:\n$D = 1$ if ($I(t) \\ge I_{threshold}$ at either $t_1$ or $t_2$) AND ($\\Delta_{MB} \\ge \\Delta_{threshold}$).\nOtherwise, $D = 0$.\n\nWe must evaluate these conditions using the exact fractional values to avoid rounding errors affecting the binary outcome, as specified in the problem.\n\n*   **Condition A: Relative Index Threshold**\n    We need to check if $I(t_1) \\ge 0.025$ or $I(t_2) \\ge 0.025$.

Thus, $I(t_1) \\ge 0.025$ is TRUE.\n\n    Since the condition is met at $t_1$, the compound condition ($I(t) \\ge I_{threshold}$ at either $t_1$ or $t_2$) is TRUE. We do not need to check $t_2$, but for completeness:\n    For $t_2$: Is $I(t_2) \\ge \\frac{1}{40}$?\n    We compare $I(t_2) = \\frac{3}{82}$ with $\\frac{1}{40}$.

All provided data are biologically and biochemically plausible. The terminology used (CK, CK-MB, cTnI, isoenzyme electrophoresis, PEG precipitation, macro-CK) is standard in clinical chemistry and laboratory diagnostics. The question asks for the most logical interpretation of a set of findings, which is a standard diagnostic reasoning task. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. There are no contradictions or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Correct Interpretation\nThe central task is to explain the marked elevation in total CK ($1{,}460\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$) in a patient with no clear evidence of acute cardiac or skeletal muscle tissue necrosis.\n\n1.  **Evaluate for Myocardial Injury**: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary concern with elevated CK. However, multiple findings argue against it:\n    -   **Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI)**: The patient's cTnI is $6\\,\\mathrm{ng/L}$, which is well within the normal reference range ($14\\,\\mathrm{ng/L}$). Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for myocardial necrosis. A normal cTnI level effectively rules out a significant acute MI.\n    -   **Clinical Presentation**: The patient reports no chest pain, and her physical exam and ECG are normal. This clinical picture is not typical for an MI.\n    -   **CK-MB Relative Index (CKI)**: This index helps differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac sources of CK-MB. It is calculated as:\n        $$ \\text{CKI} = \\frac{[\\text{CK-MB mass (ng/mL)}]}{[\\text{Total CK activity (U/L)}]} \\times 100 $$\n        For this patient:\n        $$ \\text{CKI} = \\frac{3.2}{1460} \\times 100 \\approx 0.22\\% $$\n        A CKI greater than $2.5\\%-3\\%$ is typically suggestive of a myocardial source. A value as low as $0.22\\%$ is strongly indicative of a non-cardiac origin for the CK elevation and effectively rules out MI as the cause.\n\n2.  **Evaluate for Skeletal Muscle Injury**: The predominant CK-MM band is consistent with a skeletal muscle source. Conditions like rhabdomyolysis or myopathy can cause high CK. The patient's history of autoimmune thyroiditis may be associated with hypothyroidism, which is a known cause of myopathy and elevated CK-MM. This could explain a portion of the high total CK. However, this diagnosis alone does not account for the other key laboratory findings.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Atypical Findings**: The most specific clues are the atypical electrophoretic band and the result of the PEG precipitation test.\n    -   **CK Isoenzyme Electrophoresis**: The standard isoenzymes migrate in the order of CK-BB (most anodal, fastest towards the positive electrode), CK-MB (intermediate), and CK-MM (least anodal/cathodal, slowest). The finding of an atypical band migrating between the CK-MB and CK-BB positions is highly significant. This location is not characteristic of any standard isoenzyme or of mitochondrial CK (mCK). It is, however, a classic location for **macro-CK type 1**.\n    -   **Macro-CK Type 1**: This is a high-molecular-mass complex formed when a normal CK isoenzyme (most commonly CK-BB, but sometimes CK-MM) associates with an immunoglobulin, typically IgG. This occurs more frequently in individuals with autoimmune diseases, such as the patient's autoimmune thyroiditis. The large size of this complex ($200$ kDa) slows its clearance from the bloodstream, leading to a benign but persistent elevation of total CK activity. The electrophoretic mobility of the complex is altered, resulting in the characteristic atypical band.\n    -   **PEG Precipitation**: Polyethylene glycol is used to precipitate large molecules and is a screening test for macroenzymes. The fact that PEG precipitation removed approximately $20\\%$ of the total CK activity provides strong confirmatory evidence for the presence of a high-molecular-weight macro-CK complex. This $20\\%$ reduction is in excellent agreement with the electrophoresis report that the atypical band accounts for approximately $15\\%$ of total CK activity (the values are concordant within typical laboratory measurement variability).\n\n4.  **Synthesize Findings**: The patient's presentation is best explained by the presence of macro-CK type 1. This accounts for the autoimmune history, the atypical electrophoretic band, and the positive PEG precipitation test. This finding is benign and is an analytical interference rather than a marker of tissue damage. The remaining CK elevation (the predominant CK-MM band) is likely due to a mild, chronic myopathy, possibly related to her underlying thyroid condition, which would also explain her symptom of chronic fatigue. The presence of macro-CK is the most critical finding for guiding the diagnostic interpretation and preventing an erroneous diagnosis of MI.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n-   **A. Macro-creatine kinase type $1$ (CK-BB complexed with Immunoglobulin G (IgG)) causing a benign, persistent elevation of total CK with an intermediate-migrating band and low CK-MB mass**: This option aligns perfectly with the analysis. The presence of macro-CK type 1 explains the high total CK, the link to her autoimmune disease, the specific atypical band on electrophoresis, and the low CK-MB mass leading to a negligible relative index. The phenomenon is indeed benign. This interpretation correctly identifies the cause of the confounding laboratory results.\n    -   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n-   **B. Acute myocardial infarction with significant CK-MB release, where the CK-MB mass assay is falsely low due to timing**: This is incorrect. The normal cardiac troponin I level is definitive evidence against a significant MI. The clinical picture (no chest pain, normal ECG) is also inconsistent. This option fails to explain the atypical electrophoretic band and the positive PEG precipitation test.\n    -   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n-   **C. Macro-creatine kinase type $2$ (mitochondrial CK), typically seen in critically ill patients, producing a band cathodal to CK-MM and elevating total CK**: This is incorrect. Macro-CK type 2 (mCK) is associated with severe illness and poor prognosis, which does not match this ambulatory patient. Most importantly, mCK migrates cathodal to (i.e., behind) CK-MM, whereas the observed atypical band is between CK-MB and CK-BB (anodal to CK-MM).\n    -   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n-   **D. Skeletal muscle rhabdomyolysis with increased CK-MB mass arising from skeletal muscle, explaining the atypical band and low troponin**: This is incorrect. While rhabdomyolysis would cause high CK and normal troponin, it does not produce an atypical electrophoretic band migrating between CK-MB and CK-BB. The presence of this band and the confirmatory PEG precipitation result are the key findings, which this option completely ignores and cannot explain.\n    -   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5220763"}]}
