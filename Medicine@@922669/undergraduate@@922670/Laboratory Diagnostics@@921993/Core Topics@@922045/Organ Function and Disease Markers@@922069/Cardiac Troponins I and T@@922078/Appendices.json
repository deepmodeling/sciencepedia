Consider the early phase in which the cytosolic pool releases into blood with first-order kinetics and the circulating cTn is cleared from blood with first-order kinetics. Let the amount of cTn in the cytosolic pool be denoted by $S(t)$ (mass), the circulating concentration be $C(t)$ (mass per volume), the release rate constant be $k_{r}$ (per time), the clearance rate constant be $k_{c}$ (per time), the initial cytosolic amount be $M_{0}$, and the apparent distribution volume be $V_{d}$.\n\nUsing conservation of mass and the definitions of first-order release and first-order clearance, derive the governing differential equation for the circulating concentration $C(t)$ during the early rise following necrosis.

This is a standard, fundamental model (often leading to the Bateman function) used in pharmacology and clinical chemistry to describe the concentration-time course of a substance in the body. The biological premise—release of cTn from necrotic cardiomyocytes into circulation—is factually correct. The model is a valid simplification of a complex biological process.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the derivation and solution of a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations with specified initial conditions. This constitutes a well-posed initial value problem, which admits a unique, stable solution. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language. It is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is validated as a \"valid\" problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation and Solution\n\nThe process is modeled by two compartments: the cytosolic pool (source) and the circulation (central compartment).\n\n1.  **Modeling the Cytosolic Pool, $S(t)$**:\n    The release of cTn from the cytosolic pool is a first-order process. This means the rate of decrease of the amount $S(t)$ in the pool is proportional to the amount currently present.\n    $$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -k_r S(t) $$\n    This is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using the initial condition $S(0) = M_0$.\n    $$ \\int_{M_0}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_r dt' $$\n    $$ \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(M_0) = -k_r t $$\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(t)}{M_0}\\right) = -k_r t $$\n    Exponentiating both sides gives the expression for the amount of cTn remaining in the cytosolic pool at time $t$:\n    $$ S(t) = M_0 \\exp(-k_r t) $$\n\n2.  **Modeling the Circulating Concentration, $C(t)$**:\n    The change in the amount of cTn in the circulation, which is given by the product of concentration and volume, $V_d C(t)$, is governed by the principle of conservation of mass. The rate of change equals the rate of cTn entering the circulation minus the rate of cTn leaving it.\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt}(V_d C(t)) = (\\text{Rate of Release}) - (\\text{Rate of Clearance}) $$\n    -   The rate of release from the pool is the rate at which $S(t)$ decreases: $-\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_r S(t)$.\n    -   The rate of clearance from the circulation is a first-order process with respect to the amount present in circulation, $V_d C(t)$. Thus, the rate of clearance is $k_c (V_d C(t))$.\n\n    Substituting these rates into the conservation equation:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt}(V_d C(t)) = k_r S(t) - k_c V_d C(t) $$\n    Since $V_d$ is a constant, we can write:\n    $$ V_d \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_r S(t) - k_c V_d C(t) $$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $S(t) = M_0 \\exp(-k_r t)$:\n    $$ V_d \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_r M_0 \\exp(-k_r t) - k_c V_d C(t) $$\n    Dividing by $V_d$ yields the governing differential equation for the circulating concentration $C(t)$:\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\exp(-k_r t) - k_c C(t) $$\n    This can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dt} + k_c C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\exp(-k_r t) $$\n\n3.  **Solving the Differential Equation for $C(t)$**:\n    We solve this equation using an integrating factor, $\\mu(t)$.\n    $$ \\mu(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_c dt\\right) = \\exp(k_c t) $$\n    Multiplying the standard form ODE by $\\mu(t)$:\n    $$ \\exp(k_c t) \\frac{dC}{dt} + k_c \\exp(k_c t) C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\exp(-k_r t) \\exp(k_c t) $$\n    The left side is the derivative of the product $\\mu(t)C(t)$:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(C(t) \\exp(k_c t)\\right) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\exp((k_c - k_r)t) $$\n    Integrate both sides with respect to $t$. We assume $k_r \\neq k_c$, which is true for the given parameters.\n    $$ \\int \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(C(t) \\exp(k_c t)\\right) dt = \\int \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\exp((k_c - k_r)t) dt $$\n    $$ C(t) \\exp(k_c t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d} \\frac{1}{k_c - k_r} \\exp((k_c - k_r)t) + A $$\n    where $A$ is the constant of integration. To find $C(t)$, we multiply by $\\exp(-k_c t)$:\n    $$ C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} \\exp(-k_r t) + A \\exp(-k_c t) $$\n    Now, apply the initial condition $C(0) = 0$:\n    $$ 0 = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} \\exp(0) + A \\exp(0) $$\n    $$ A = -\\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} $$\n    Substitute $A$ back into the expression for $C(t)$:\n    $$ C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} \\exp(-k_r t) - \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} \\exp(-k_c t) $$\n    Factoring yields the final closed-form expression for $C(t)$:\n    $$ C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_c - k_r)} \\left( \\exp(-k_r t) - \\exp(-k_c t) \\right) $$\n    For convenience, we can rewrite this as:\n    $$ C(t) = \\frac{k_r M_0}{V_d(k_r - k_c)} \\left( \\exp(-k_c t) - \\exp(-k_r t) \\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we compute the value of $C(t)$ at $t = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$ using the given parameters.
