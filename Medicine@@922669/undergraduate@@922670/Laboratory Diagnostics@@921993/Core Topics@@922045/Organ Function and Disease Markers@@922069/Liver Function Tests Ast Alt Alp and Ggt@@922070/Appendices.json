The fundamental principles governing the calculation are the Beer-Lambert law, which relates absorbance to concentration, and the principles of enzyme kinetics, which relate reaction rate to enzyme activity, including accounting for sample dilution.\n\nFirst, the relationship between absorbance ($A$) and concentration ($c$) is given by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon \\ell c$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, and $\\ell$ is the pathlength of the cuvette. For this kinetic assay, we are interested in the rate of change of concentration over time. By differentiating the Beer-Lambert law with respect to time ($t$), we obtain:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\epsilon \\ell \\frac{dc}{dt}$$\nIn this specific assay, the reaction progress is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at $340\\ \\text{nm}$ due to the oxidation of NADH. Therefore, the concentration $c$ corresponds to the concentration of NADH, denoted as $[\\text{NADH}]$. The problem provides the magnitude of the initial rate of absorbance decrease, $\\left|\\frac{\\Delta A_{340}}{\\Delta t}\\right| = 0.120\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$. Since NADH is consumed, its concentration and absorbance decrease, meaning $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ is negative. The rate of NADH consumption in the cuvette, which corresponds to the volumetric enzyme activity in the cuvette ($v_{\\text{cuvette}}$), is thus:\n$$v_{\\text{cuvette}} = -\\frac{d[\\text{NADH}]}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\ell} \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\ell} \\left(-\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{|\\Delta A_{340}/\\Delta t|}{\\epsilon_{\\text{NADH},340} \\ell}$$\nThe stoichiometry between ALT turnover and NADH oxidation is given as $1:1$, so this rate is equal to the rate of substrate conversion by ALT in the cuvette.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\\left|\\frac{\\Delta A_{340}}{\\Delta t}\\right| = 0.120\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{NADH},340} = 6.22 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\ell = 1.00\\ \\text{cm}$\n\nThe activity in the cuvette is:\n$$v_{\\text{cuvette}} = \\frac{0.120\\ \\text{min}^{-1}}{(6.22 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) \\times (1.00\\ \\text{cm})} = \\frac{0.120}{6220}\\ \\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$$\nThe unit of enzyme activity is defined as $1\\ \\text{U} = 1\\ \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.

In the absence of hemolysis, serum AST reflects extracellular enzymatic activity. When red blood cells lyse, intracellular AST is released and adds to the measured serum activity.

The algorithm must rely only on the tissue distributions of enzymes and well-established clinical associations. The following foundational facts are taken as the starting point: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced predominantly by liver canalicular epithelium and osteoblasts; gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is produced by hepatobiliary tissues and is inducible in cholestasis and with certain exposures (for example, alcohol and enzyme-inducing drugs), but GGT is not produced by bone; 5'-nucleotidase (5'NT) is a liver-associated enzyme that, like GGT, is not produced by bone; elevations in ALP due to cholestasis are typically accompanied by increased GGT and often increased 5'NT; elevations in ALP due to increased osteoblastic activity (for example, vitamin D deficiency, fractures healing, Paget disease) are not accompanied by increases in GGT or 5'NT.

If ALP is above the reference interval, measure GGT; if GGT is also above its reference interval, classify a hepatobiliary cholestatic pattern; if GGT is within its reference interval, favor a bone source of ALP and evaluate with ALP isoenzyme fractionation or 5'NT, along with bone turnover assessment (for example, vitamin D, calcium, phosphate).
