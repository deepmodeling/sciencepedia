This problem is based on the application of the Beer–Lambert law in the context of an empirical calibration.\n\nThe Beer–Lambert law describes the linear relationship between absorbance, $A$, and the concentration, $c$, of an absorbing species, given by $A = \\epsilon b c$, where $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity and $b$ is the path length. In instrumental analysis such as AAS, a practical calibration curve is generated by plotting measured absorbance values against known concentrations of a series of standards.\n\nThe problem states that for low concentrations, this calibration relationship is linear and, after blank subtraction, the intercept is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, the governing equation for the calibration can be expressed as:\n$$A = m \\cdot c$$\nwhere $A$ is the measured absorbance, $c$ is the analyte concentration, and $m$ is the slope of the linear calibration plot.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe slope of the calibration curve, $m = 2.20 \\times 10^{-4}$ absorbance per $\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$.\nThe characteristic concentration, $c_0$, is defined as the concentration of the analyte that produces a specific absorbance, which we will denote as $A_0$. The value for this absorbance is given as $A_0 = 0.0044$. This value corresponds to a fractional absorption of $0.01$ (or $1\\%$), as confirmed by the relationship $A = -\\log_{10}(1 - \\text{fractional absorption}) = -\\log_{10}(1 - 0.01) = -\\log_{10}(0.99) \\approx 0.00436$, which is commonly rounded to $0.0044$ in this context.\n\nTo find the characteristic concentration $c_0$, we rearrange the calibration equation to solve for concentration:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{m}$$\nSubstituting the specific values for the characteristic concentration, we get:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{A_0}{m}$$\nNow, we insert the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$A_0 = 0.0044$$\n$$m = 2.20 \\times 10^{-4} \\frac{\\text{absorbance}}{\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}}$$\nSo, the calculation for $c_0$ is:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{0.0044}{2.20 \\times 10^{-4}} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we can write the numerator in scientific notation:\n$$c_0 = \\frac{4.4 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.20 \\times 10^{-4}} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = \\left(\\frac{4.4}{2.20}\\right) \\times 10^{-3 - (-4)} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = 2 \\times 10^{1} \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\n$$c_0 = 20 \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Calculation of the F-statistic and Interpretation**\n\nThe degrees of freedom for lack of fit are $df_{LOF} = g - p = 5 - 2 = 3$.\nThe mean square for lack of fit is $MS_{LOF} = SS_{LOF} / df_{LOF} = (6.069 \\times 10^{-4}) / 3 = 2.023 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe F-statistic is the ratio of the mean squares:\n$F = \\frac{MS_{LOF}}{MS_{PE}} = \\frac{2.023 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-6}} = 126.4375$\n\nTo interpret this result, we compare it to the critical value from the $F$-distribution at $\\alpha = 0.05$ with $df_{LOF} = 3$ and $df_{PE} = 10$. The critical value is $F_{0.05, 3, 10} \\approx 3.71$.\nSince our calculated $F$-statistic ($126.4$) is much larger than the critical value ($3.71$), we reject the null hypothesis that the linear model is adequate.
