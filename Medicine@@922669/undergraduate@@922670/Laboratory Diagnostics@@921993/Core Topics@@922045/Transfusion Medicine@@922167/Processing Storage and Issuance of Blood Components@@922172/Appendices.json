The definition of hematocrit is correct. The process described—centrifugation of whole blood, separation of components, and addition of a preservative/additive solution—is standard practice for producing PRC units. The values provided for whole blood volume ($450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$), hematocrit ($0.42$), and additive solution volume ($70\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) are all within realistic clinical ranges. The concept of a processing yield or fractional loss ($0.10$) is a standard and practical consideration in manufacturing and laboratory processes. The assumption of additive volumes is a reasonable simplification for this context.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique numerical solution. The objective is clearly stated.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or biased statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, consistent, realistic, and well-posed.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to calculate the final volume of the Packed Red Cell (PRC) unit, denoted as $V_{PRC}$. The problem states that this final volume is the sum of the recovered red blood cell volume and the volume of the added solution.\n\nLet's define the variables based on the givens:\n-   $V_{WB}$: Initial volume of whole blood, given as $450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n-   $HCT$: Hematocrit of the whole blood, given as $0.42$.\n-   $V_{RBC, initial}$: The initial volume of red blood cells in the whole blood sample.\n-   $f_{loss}$: The fractional loss of red blood cells during processing, given as $0.10$.\n-   $V_{RBC, recovered}$: The volume of red blood cells remaining after the processing loss.\n-   $V_{add}$: The volume of the additive solution, given as $70\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n-   $V_{PRC}$: The final volume of the PRC unit.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of hematocrit as the ratio of red blood cell volume to whole blood volume. We can express this mathematically as:\n$$HCT = \\frac{V_{RBC, initial}}{V_{WB}}$$\nFrom this definition, we can calculate the initial volume of red blood cells in the whole blood sample:\n$$V_{RBC, initial} = HCT \\times V_{WB}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{RBC, initial} = 0.42 \\times 450\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 189\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nNext, we account for the fractional loss of red blood cells during component preparation. The fractional loss is given as $f_{loss} = 0.10$. The volume of red blood cells that is lost is:\n$$V_{loss} = f_{loss} \\times V_{RBC, initial}$$\nThe volume of red blood cells recovered after processing is the initial volume minus the lost volume:\n$$V_{RBC, recovered} = V_{RBC, initial} - V_{loss} = V_{RBC, initial} - (f_{loss} \\times V_{RBC, initial})$$\nFactoring out $V_{RBC, initial}$, we get:\n$$V_{RBC, recovered} = V_{RBC, initial} \\times (1 - f_{loss})$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$V_{RBC, recovered} = 189\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times (1 - 0.10) = 189\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.90 = 170.1\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nFinally, the problem states that the PRC unit is created by adding the additive solution to the recovered red blood cells. Based on the instruction to compute the sum of the red blood cell volume after losses and the additive solution volume, and the assumption that volumes are additive, the final volume of the PRC unit is:\n$$V_{PRC} = V_{RBC, recovered} + V_{add}$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$V_{PRC} = 170.1\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 70\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 240.1\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $240.1$. The first three significant figures are $2$, $4$, and $0$. The fourth digit is $1$, so we round down, keeping the third significant digit as $0$. The value rounded to three significant figures is $240$.\nTo express $240$ in scientific notation, we write it as a number between $1$ and $10$ multiplied by a power of $10$.\n$$240 = 2.40 \\times 10^2$$\nThe trailing zero is significant and must be included to correctly represent the precision of three significant figures.\nThe final symbolic expression for the answer is:\n$$V_{PRC} = (HCT \\times V_{WB} \\times (1 - f_{loss})) + V_{add}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.40 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "5235820"}, {"introduction": "Red blood cells undergo changes during storage, a process known as \"storage lesion,\" with hemolysis being a key indicator of cell quality.

The storage of RBC units at approximately $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for up to $42$ days is common practice (depending on the anticoagulant-preservative solution used). Hemolysis, the rupture of RBCs and release of hemoglobin into the surrounding plasma, is a known storage lesion. The measurement of plasma-free hemoglobin as a percentage or fraction of total hemoglobin is a key quality control metric. A common regulatory limit for hemolysis is less than $1\\%$ of the red cell mass, which corresponds to a free hemoglobin fraction of $0.01$. The values provided ($f_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.009$, $f_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.010$, $m_{\\mathrm{total}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{g}$) are physically and biologically realistic for a unit of packed RBCs near the end of its shelf life. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data ($f_{\\mathrm{free}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$, $m_{\\mathrm{total}}$) and definitions (the condition for QC acceptance and the definition of the decision variable $D$) to arrive at a unique solution for the two requested quantities ($D$ and $m_{\\mathrm{free}}$).\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective elements.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is free from any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe solution involves two parts: determining the QC decision ($D$) and calculating the mass of free hemoglobin ($m_{\\mathrm{free}}$).\n\n**Part 1: Determine the QC Decision ($D$)**\n\nThe QC criterion states that the unit is accepted if the measured free hemoglobin fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{free}}$, does not exceed the acceptance threshold, $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{free}} \\leq f_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.009$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.010$$\nWe evaluate the inequality:\n$$0.009 \\leq 0.010$$\nThis statement is true. Therefore, the RBC unit meets the quality control criteria.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, the decision variable $D$ is set to $1$ if the unit meets QC criteria. Since the criterion is met, we have:\n$$D = 1$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Mass of Free Hemoglobin ($m_{\\mathrm{free}}$)**\n\nThe free hemoglobin fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{free}}$, is defined as the ratio of the mass of free hemoglobin, $m_{\\mathrm{free}}$, to the total hemoglobin content, $m_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{free}}}{m_{\\mathrm{total}}}$$\nTo find the mass of free hemoglobin, we rearrange this equation:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{free}} = f_{\\mathrm{free}} \\times m_{\\mathrm{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.009$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{total}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nThe calculation is:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.009 \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nThe mass of free hemoglobin is $0.45$ grams.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a row matrix with entries $D$ and $m_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\nThe values are $D=1$ and $m_{\\mathrm{free}}=0.45$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.45 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.45 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5235805"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of blood banking is a safe and effective transfusion, which requires understanding the clinical impact of stored components.
