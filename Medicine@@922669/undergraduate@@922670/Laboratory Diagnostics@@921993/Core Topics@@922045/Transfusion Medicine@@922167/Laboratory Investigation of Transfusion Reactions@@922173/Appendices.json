Two group-compatible packed RBC units are transfused without immediate issues. On day 7 post-transfusion, the patient develops low-grade fever and jaundice, with laboratory testing showing total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (indirect fraction predominant), lactate dehydrogenase 580 U/L, haptoglobin undetectable, and hemoglobin decreasing from 9.6 g/dL pre-transfusion to 8.2 g/dL.

The clinical signs (fever, jaundice), laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis (elevated indirect bilirubin and LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, inappropriate hemoglobin drop), and serological findings (newly positive IgG DAT, new positive IAT/antibody screen) are all internally consistent and grounded in fundamental principles of immunohematology and transfusion medicine. The timing of the reaction (day $7$) is characteristic of an anamnestic (secondary) immune response.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of data that allows for a definitive a posteriori diagnosis and the formulation of a standard investigative plan. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the information.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is described using precise, objective clinical and laboratory terminology and quantitative data. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws that would prevent a rigorous analysis. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## PRINCIPLE-BASED DERIVATION AND OPTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided data points to a coherent diagnosis through a systematic application of immunohematological principles.\n\n1.  **Evidence of Hemolysis**: The patient's clinical signs (jaundice) and laboratory results (elevated indirect bilirubin, elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin) are definitive indicators of red blood cell destruction (hemolysis). The drop in hemoglobin from $9.6$ g/dL to $8.2$ g/dL, despite the transfusion of two RBC units, confirms that the transfused cells are being prematurely destroyed. The predominance of indirect bilirubin and the delayed onset (day $7$) point towards an extravascular hemolytic process, where antibody-coated RBCs are cleared by macrophages in the spleen and liver.\n\n2.  **Immune-Mediated Nature of Hemolysis**:\n    *   The positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) with anti-IgG demonstrates that the patient's circulating red blood cells are coated *in vivo* with IgG antibodies. This is direct proof of an immune-mediated process targeting RBCs.\n    *   The negative result with anti-complement in the DAT suggests the IgG antibody is not a significant activator of the complement cascade, which is consistent with extravascular hemolysis rather than acute intravascular hemolysis.\n    *   The newly positive antibody screen (an Indirect Antiglobulin Test or IAT) indicates the presence of a circulating, unbound RBC alloantibody in the patient's plasma that was not present or detectable before the transfusion.\n    *   The newly incompatible crossmatches are a direct consequence of this new alloantibody in the patient's plasma reacting with antigens on donor RBCs.\n\n3.  **Kinetics of the Immune Response**:\n    *   The patient had a negative antibody screen before transfusion. The retained pretransfusion sample re-tested as negative. This rules out a simple clerical error where a pre-existing antibody was missed.\n    *   The appearance of a detectable IgG antibody on day $7$ post-transfusion is characteristic of an anamnestic (secondary) immune response. The patient was likely sensitized to a specific RBC antigen in the past (e.g., via pregnancy or a previous transfusion), but the antibody level had waned over time to become undetectable by standard methods. The recent transfusion with antigen-positive RBCs served as an antigenic challenge, triggering a rapid and robust production of IgG antibody. A primary immune response is less likely to produce a significant IgG titer this quickly.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The most plausible explanation is a **delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) caused by an anamnestic IgG alloantibody response**.\n\n5.  **Required Investigative Steps**: The goals are to identify the causative antibody and provide safe blood for future transfusions.\n    *   **Identify the antibody on the RBCs**: An **elution** procedure must be performed on the patient's DAT-positive RBCs. This physically detaches the bound IgG, creating a solution (eluate) containing the purified antibody.\n    *   **Determine antibody specificity**: The eluate and the patient's plasma (which contains the unbound antibody) must be tested against a panel of reagent RBCs with known antigen profiles. This allows for the identification of the antibody's specificity (e.g., anti-Jkᵃ, anti-K, etc.).\n    *   **Confirm the alloantibody status**: The patient should lack the antigen corresponding to the identified antibody. Patient RBCs (ideally from the pretransfusion sample to avoid confusion from circulating donor cells) must be phenotyped. For example, if anti-Jkᵃ is identified, the patient should type as Jk(a-).\n    *   **Provide compatible blood**: All subsequent RBC units for transfusion must be phenotypically negative for the implicated antigen and must be crossmatch-compatible at the AHG phase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Explanation: Passive transfer of a clinically significant alloantibody from donor plasma caused hemolysis. Steps: Test residual plasma from the transfused RBC units for alloantibodies, administer Rh immune globulin, and switch to group O RhD-negative units without further serologic workup.**\n*   **Analysis**: The explanation is incorrect. Passive antibody transfer from donor plasma would not result in a new, sustained production of antibody by the patient, as evidenced by the newly positive antibody screen appearing a week later. The patient's immune system is actively producing the antibody. The proposed steps are inappropriate and unsafe; Rh immune globulin is irrelevant without evidence of an RhD issue, and transfusing units without identifying and matching for the specific causative antigen is negligent.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Explanation: Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction due to an anamnestic IgG alloantibody response against an antigen present on the transfused donor RBCs but absent on screening cells or previously below detection. Steps: Perform polyspecific and monospecific DAT; perform an acid elution and test the eluate against an identification panel; repeat the IAT with enhanced methods (for example, polyethylene glycol) and selected cells to define specificity; phenotype the patient’s pretransfusion RBCs for the implicated antigen and antigen-type the donor units; issue antigen-negative units crossmatch-compatible at the AHG phase.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option provides a perfectly accurate explanation consistent with all the data: a DHTR from an anamnestic response where the pre-existing antibody was at an undetectable titer. The proposed steps represent the complete, correct, and standard-of-care laboratory investigation required to resolve such a case and ensure future transfusion safety. Each step logically follows from the principles of immunohematology.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Explanation: Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia unrelated to transfusion timing. Steps: Skip elution and antigen typing; perform autoadsorptions until all serum reactivity is removed and then issue least-incompatible units without regard to antigen matching.**\n*   **Analysis**: While a warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) is a differential diagnosis for a positive IgG DAT, dismissing the transfusion event that occurred exactly in the time frame of a classic DHTR is poor clinical reasoning. The most critical error is in the proposed steps. Skipping the elution prevents differentiation between an alloantibody and an autoantibody. If an underlying alloantibody exists (which is highly likely here), it could be missed, leading to transfusion with antigen-positive blood and exacerbation of hemolysis. Issuing \"least-incompatible\" units is a measure of last resort for WAIHA, not a primary strategy when a specific alloantibody is the probable cause.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Explanation: Bacterial contamination of a transfused unit caused intravascular hemolysis that altered the crossmatch. Steps: Culture the transfused units and patient blood; if positive, treat infection and proceed with routine crossmatching without antibody investigations.**\n*   **Analysis**: This explanation is inconsistent with the clinical picture. Bacterial contamination causes an acute, septic reaction, usually within hours of transfusion, and is associated with severe intravascular hemolysis. This patient's reaction is delayed (day $7$) and shows signs of extravascular hemolysis. Most importantly, bacterial contamination does not induce the formation of a specific IgG RBC alloantibody, which is the central serological finding in this case (positive DAT and positive IAT). The proposed steps completely ignore the immunological evidence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Explanation: Cold agglutinin disease with complement-mediated hemolysis emerged post-transfusion. Steps: Perform a cold agglutinin titer at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, prewarm all serologic tests, and transfuse warmed RBCs without elution or antigen typing studies.**\n*   **Analysis**: This explanation is directly contradicted by the laboratory data. Cold agglutinin disease is mediated by IgM antibodies that are reactive in the cold and typically fix complement. This patient's DAT is positive for IgG and negative for complement. The serological reactions (incompatible crossmatch) are occurring at the AHG phase, which requires incubation at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, indicating a \"warm-reactive\" antibody. The explanation and the corresponding investigative steps are therefore incorrect.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5229741"}, {"introduction": "Once a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction is suspected, the investigation must build a definitive, evidence-based case to identify the cause.

[@problem_id:5229828]", "problem": "A patient case is investigated for a suspected hemolytic transfusion reaction using immunohematology principles. Consider the following scenario. A 62-year-old individual with red blood cells (RBCs) phenotyped as Rh system $E$ antigen negative receives 2 group-compatible packed RBC units. The pretransfusion antibody screen detects no clinically significant alloantibodies. Within 48 hours, the patient develops fever, back pain, and laboratory changes compatible with hemolysis: hemoglobin decreases from 10.4 g/dL to 8.2 g/dL, plasma free hemoglobin increases from 20 mg/dL to 120 mg/dL, and indirect bilirubin increases from 0.8 mg/dL to 2.5 mg/dL. Posttransfusion testing shows the following:\n\n- Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 2+ strength and negative for complement.\n- Acid elution from the patient’s RBCs yields an eluate that reacts only with $E$-positive reagent cells and does not react with $E$-negative cells.\n- When the patient’s posttransfusion RBCs are tested with anti-$E$ reagent, mixed-field agglutination is observed, consistent with two circulating RBC populations.\n- Donor unit segments retained from the two transfused units are phenotyped: Unit $1$ is $E$ negative, Unit $2$ is $E$ positive.\n- Retrospective serologic crossmatch using the patient’s posttransfusion plasma at the antihuman globulin (AHG) phase (Indirect Antiglobulin Test, IAT) is compatible with Unit $1$ and incompatible with Unit $2$.\n- No other clinically significant alloantibodies are detected on a posttransfusion antibody identification panel.\n\nBased only on first principles of antigen–antibody specificity, in vivo sensitization detected by the DAT, and antibody recovery by elution, which option correctly concludes whether the $E$-positive donor unit was implicated in an anti-$E$ mediated hemolytic transfusion reaction and specifies the minimum laboratory evidence required to justify that implication?\n\nA. The $E$-positive donor unit is implicated. Minimum laboratory evidence includes: demonstration that the transfused unit carries the target antigen ($E$), in vivo coating of patient RBCs by the corresponding antibody (DAT IgG positive), recovery of specificity from the patient’s RBCs by elution (anti-$E$ in the eluate), serologic incompatibility of the implicated unit with the patient’s plasma at the AHG phase, and exclusion of other $E$-positive units among those transfused.\n\nB. The $E$-positive donor unit is implicated solely because the eluate shows anti-$E$; no donor segment antigen typing or retrospective crossmatch is required when mixed-field agglutination is observed with anti-$E$.\n\nC. The $E$-positive donor unit is not implicated because the pretransfusion crossmatch was compatible; delayed hemolysis can occur despite pretransfusion compatibility and therefore crossmatch findings cannot be used retrospectively.\n\nD. The $E$-positive donor unit cannot be implicated without complement involvement; a DAT positive only for IgG at 2+ strength does not provide sufficient evidence of immune-mediated hemolysis or of unit-specific incompatibility.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and objectivity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Profile:** A $62$-year-old individual.\n-   **Patient Phenotype:** Red blood cells (RBCs) are Rh system $E$ antigen negative.\n-   **Transfusion Details:** Received $2$ group-compatible packed RBC units.\n-   **Pretransfusion Serology:** Antibody screen detected no clinically significant alloantibodies.\n-   **Posttransfusion Clinical Presentation (within $48$ hours):** Fever, back pain.\n-   **Posttransfusion Laboratory Data (Hemolysis Markers):**\n    -   Hemoglobin: Decreased from $10.4$ g/dL to $8.2$ g/dL.\n    -   Plasma free hemoglobin: Increased from $20$ mg/dL to $120$ mg/dL.\n    -   Indirect bilirubin: Increased from $0.8$ mg/dL to $2.5$ mg/dL.\n-   **Posttransfusion Immunohematology Workup:**\n    -   Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT): Positive for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) at $2+$ strength; negative for complement.\n    -   Elution: Acid eluate from the patient's RBCs reacts only with $E$-positive reagent cells and not with $E$-negative cells.\n    -   RBC Phenotyping with Reagent: Patient's posttransfusion RBCs tested with anti-$E$ reagent show mixed-field agglutination.\n    -   Donor Unit Phenotyping: Unit $1$ is $E$-negative; Unit $2$ is $E$-positive.\n    -   Retrospective Crossmatch (posttransfusion plasma, Antihuman Globulin - AHG - phase): Compatible with Unit $1$; incompatible with Unit $2$.\n    -   Posttransfusion Antibody Panel: No other clinically significant alloantibodies detected.\n-   **Question:** Conclude whether the $E$-positive donor unit was implicated in an anti-$E$ mediated hemolytic transfusion reaction and specify the minimum laboratory evidence required.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR), likely due to an anamnestic (secondary immune) response. The patient, initially lacking a detectable antibody, is exposed to an antigen they lack (the $E$ antigen from Unit $2$). This triggers a rapid production of alloantibody (anti-$E$), leading to the destruction of the transfused antigen-positive cells. All serologic tests described (DAT, elution, mixed-field agglutination, retrospective crossmatch) and the clinical/laboratory markers of hemolysis are standard, correct, and central to the investigation of such reactions in transfusion medicine. The entire scenario is scientifically sound and factually correct within the domain of immunohematology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a comprehensive set of clinical and laboratory data, sufficient to arrive at a definite conclusion. The question is precise, asking for a conclusion and the basis for it according to established principles. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical, presenting data without bias or subjective interpretation. Terms like `mixed-field agglutination` and `2+ strength` are standard, objective descriptors in serology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is internally consistent. The patient is $E$-negative and receives an $E$-positive unit. Post-transfusion, anti-$E$ is identified on the patient's RBCs (via elution). The DAT is positive, indicating `in vivo` sensitization. The retrospective crossmatch is incompatible with the $E$-positive unit. Mixed-field agglutination with anti-$E$ confirms the presence of two cell populations ($E$-negative patient cells and $E$-positive donor cells). All findings logically converge to a single diagnosis. The setup is complete.\n-   **Realism:** The case is highly realistic and represents a standard HTR investigation that a clinical laboratory scientist would perform.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, internally consistent, and realistic. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine if Unit $2$ is responsible for the patient's hemolytic reaction and to define the necessary serologic evidence. A definitive link requires a chain of evidence based on fundamental immunohematology principles.\n\n1.  **Principle of Immune Hemolysis:** An immune-mediated hemolytic reaction occurs when a recipient's antibody binds to an antigen on transfused donor RBCs, leading to their premature destruction. For this to happen, the patient must lack the antigen present on the donor cells.\n    -   *Evidence:* Patient is $E$-negative. Donor Unit $2$ is $E$-positive. This fulfills the prerequisite condition.\n\n2.  **Principle of In Vivo Sensitization (DAT):** The binding of antibody to RBCs within the patient's circulation (`in vivo`) is detected by the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT). A positive DAT is the cornerstone finding that indicates an immune process is occurring on the surface of circulating RBCs.\n    -   *Evidence:* The DAT is positive for IgG. This confirms that RBCs in the patient's circulation are coated with an IgG antibody.\n\n3.  **Principle of Antibody Specificity (Elution):** To prove which antibody is causing the positive DAT, the bound antibody is detached from the RBCs (elution) and its specificity is determined. The eluate should react with reagent cells carrying the suspected antigen and not with cells lacking it.\n    -   *Evidence:* The eluate contains an antibody that reacts only with $E$-positive cells. This identifies the coating antibody as anti-$E$.\n\n4.  **Principle of Unit Implication (Donor Typing and Retrospective Crossmatch):** To implicate a specific donor unit, it must be shown to possess the target antigen, and the patient's antibody must be shown to react with that unit's cells.\n    -   *Evidence A (Antigen Presence):* Phenotyping of donor segments confirms Unit $2$ is $E$-positive.\n    -   *Evidence B (Antibody-Cell Reactivity):* The retrospective crossmatch using the patient's posttransfusion plasma is incompatible with Unit $2$. This directly demonstrates that the antibody now present in the patient's plasma (anti-$E$) reacts with the cells from Unit $2$.\n\n5.  **Principle of Exclusion:** To solidify the conclusion, other possibilities must be ruled out. This involves ensuring no other clinically significant antibodies are present and that other transfused units did not carry the offending antigen.\n    -   *Evidence:* The posttransfusion antibody panel detected no other antibodies. Phenotyping confirmed Unit $1$ was $E$-negative. This isolates the causality to anti-$E$ and Unit $2$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of these findings provides irrefutable evidence. The minimum set of laboratory evidence required to implicate the $E$-positive donor unit is: a positive DAT demonstrating `in vivo` sensitization, an eluate confirming the specificity of the coating antibody (anti-$E$), phenotyping to show the implicated unit carries the target antigen ($E$), a retrospective crossmatch demonstrating incompatibility between the patient's antibody and the implicated unit's cells, and exclusion of other units/antibodies as the cause.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The $E$-positive donor unit is implicated. Minimum laboratory evidence includes: demonstration that the transfused unit carries the target antigen ($E$), in vivo coating of patient RBCs by the corresponding antibody (DAT IgG positive), recovery of specificity from the patient’s RBCs by elution (anti-$E$ in the eluate), serologic incompatibility of the implicated unit with the patient’s plasma at the AHG phase, and exclusion of other $E$-positive units among those transfused.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option accurately and comprehensively lists the essential components of the serologic investigation required to definitively implicate a specific donor unit in a hemolytic transfusion reaction, as derived from first principles above. It includes donor antigen status, `in vivo` sensitization (DAT), antibody specificity (elution), direct proof of incompatibility (retrospective crossmatch), and exclusion of alternatives.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The $E$-positive donor unit is implicated solely because the eluate shows anti-$E$; no donor segment antigen typing or retrospective crossmatch is required when mixed-field agglutination is observed with anti-$E$.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. While the eluate is critical, it only identifies the antibody. To implicate a specific *unit*, one must prove that unit possessed the corresponding antigen. Without donor typing, it's impossible to know which of the $2$ units was the source of the $E$ antigen. The retrospective crossmatch is also a required confirmatory step. Relying solely on the eluate and mixed-field agglutination is incomplete and fails to establish a direct causal link to a specific unit.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The $E$-positive donor unit is not implicated because the pretransfusion crossmatch was compatible; delayed hemolysis can occur despite pretransfusion compatibility and therefore crossmatch findings cannot be used retrospectively.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option is fundamentally flawed. A compatible pretransfusion test is the hallmark of an anamnestic response leading to a DHTR, as the initial antibody level is too low for detection. The core purpose of a retrospective crossmatch is to demonstrate the *newly developed* incompatibility, which is powerful evidence *for*, not against, unit implication. The conclusion that the unit is not implicated and that retrospective findings are invalid is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The $E$-positive donor unit cannot be implicated without complement involvement; a DAT positive only for IgG at $2{+}$ strength does not provide sufficient evidence of immune-mediated hemolysis or of unit-specific incompatibility.**\n-   **Analysis:** This is scientifically false. Many significant alloantibodies, particularly those in the Rh system like anti-$E$, are primarily non-complement-binding IgG antibodies that cause extravascular hemolysis. A DAT positive for IgG alone is sufficient proof of `in vivo` sensitization and is a very common finding in DHTRs. The absence of complement does not exonerate the antibody or the unit. The positive IgG DAT is the critical first step that prompts the full investigation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5229828"}, {"introduction": "A critical aspect of laboratory diagnostics is recognizing when unexpected results point not to a complex biological event, but to a pre-analytical error.

Wrong-blood-in-tube (WBIT) events are due to collection/labeling errors.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The scenario is a classic and realistic problem in transfusion medicine. All concepts—ABO typing, DAT, transfusion reactions, sample collection protocols, and potential errors like WBIT—are fundamental and well-established in laboratory diagnostics. The foundational facts provided are correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a clear discrepancy between the patient's known historical/pre-transfusion blood type ($O$) and the post-reaction sample's type ($AB$). The provided data are sufficient to deduce the most logical cause of this discrepancy and determine the appropriate corrective action. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective laboratory terminology (e.g., \"strong agglutination,\" \"negative DAT,\" \"plasma hemolysis index\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem contains a significant but intentional discrepancy in the laboratory results, which is the core of the diagnostic challenge. It does not contain contradictions in its own premises. The setup is complete and logically consistent for a problem of this type. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central issue is the discrepancy between the patient's well-established Group $O$ status and the post-reaction sample typing as Group $AB$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Discrepancy:**\n    - A patient with blood group $O$ has red blood cells (RBCs) that lack A and B antigens and plasma that contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.\n    - A sample typing as blood group $AB$ has RBCs with both A and B antigens and plasma that lacks both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.\n    - The foundational fact that ABO antigens are genetically determined and do not change acutely rules out a true biological change from type $O$ to type $AB$. Therefore, the discrepancy must stem from a procedural or technical error.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Causes for the Discrepancy:**\n    - **Technical Artifact:** Could a testing issue create a false $AB$ type?\n        - Nonspecific agglutination (e.g., from cold autoagglutinins) would likely cause reactions with all reagents, including the Rh control (if used), and would not typically yield a clean, concordant $AB$ reverse type. The problem notes strong, specific-looking reactions. This makes a technical artifact less likely.\n    - **Sample Admixture (In Vivo or In Vitro):**\n        - The patient (type $O$) received a type $O$ RBC unit. Admixture of the patient's blood with the donor blood, either in vivo (in the patient's circulation) or in vitro (by drawing the sample from the infusion line), would result in a mixture of type $O$ cells. This mixture would still type as $O$. It cannot explain the appearance of A and B antigens.\n    - **Wrong-Blood-In-Tube (WBIT):**\n        - This hypothesis posits that the post-reaction EDTA tube was drawn from a different patient and mislabeled with the correct patient's information.\n        - If the tube came from a patient who is genuinely blood group $AB$, the laboratory results would be:\n            - Forward type: Agglutination with anti-A and anti-B reagents.\n            - Reverse type: No agglutination with A1 or B cells.\n        - These results perfectly match the findings from the post-reaction EDTA tube. This is the most parsimonious and comprehensive explanation for the serological findings.\n    - **Clinical Context:** The patient's clinical reaction (fever and rigors) with a negative DAT and no hemolysis is consistent with a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). Since the patient is type $O$ and received type $O$ RBCs, an ABO-incompatible hemolytic reaction is not the cause of the clinical symptoms. The WBIT event for the post-reaction sample is a separate, critical error discovered during the investigation of the FNHTR.\n\n3.  **Determine the Corrective Action:**\n    - Given the high probability of a WBIT event, the identity of the post-reaction sample is compromised. All results from this sample are invalid for the patient in question.\n    - The absolute priority is to obtain a new, verifiably correct sample from the patient.\n    - Standard protocol for resolving a suspected WBIT involves strict positive patient identification at the bedside and collection of new specimen(s) from a venipuncture site not associated with any intravenous infusions.\n    - To ensure the highest level of safety and to eliminate the possibility of a repeat error, collecting two independently drawn samples is best practice.\n    - Concurrently, all existing materials (retained pre-transfusion sample, donor unit segment) must be re-tested to confirm all baseline data are correct. This comprehensive approach is necessary to definitively resolve the discrepancy and ensure patient safety.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In vitro hemolysis in the post-reaction EDTA sample interfered with typing; recollect a single clotted tube via the existing intravenous (IV, Intravenous) line after flushing for $2$ minutes and repeat testing.**\n**Analysis:** The premise is contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies the `visual plasma hemolysis index is within normal limits`. Furthermore, the corrective action is dangerous and violates standard phlebotomy practices for transfusion medicine. Drawing from an IV line, even after flushing, carries a high risk of contamination with infusate.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Cold autoagglutinins caused nonspecific panagglutination in forward typing; perform warm saline washes and repeat ABO testing at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ on the same sample; no recollection is necessary.**\n**Analysis:** The serological findings are not consistent with cold autoagglutinins. The forward typing showed agglutination only with anti-A and anti-B (not panagglutination), and the DAT was negative. The reverse typing was also clean. Therefore, the proposed cause is incorrect, and the corrective action is inappropriate. A new sample is absolutely necessary.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Admixture of donor red blood cells into the post-reaction sample drawn from the infusion arm converted the type; recollect one EDTA tube from the same arm distal to the IV site after pausing the transfusion for $5$ minutes.**\n**Analysis:** The premise is logically flawed. The patient is type $O$ and received type $O$ RBCs. Admixture of type $O$ cells with type $O$ cells cannot produce a type $AB$ result. The corrective action is also suboptimal; the standard of care is to use a different limb entirely for recollection to avoid any risk of contamination.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Wrong-blood-in-tube (mislabeled post-reaction EDTA tube from another patient) created a historical ABO discrepancy; immediately obtain two independently collected and labeled specimens (one EDTA and one clotted) from a vein not used for infusion, using strict positive patient identification, and repeat ABO/RhD, antibody screen, crossmatch, and DAT; concurrently retype the retained pre-transfusion sample and the donor unit segment.**\n**Analysis:** This option correctly identifies the most plausible cause of the ABO discrepancy—a WBIT event. The results on the post-reaction sample are perfectly explained if the sample belonged to a type $AB$ individual. The proposed corrective action is the comprehensive, gold-standard protocol for resolving such a critical incident. It emphasizes strict patient identification, collection of new samples from an uncompromised site, and re-verification of all existing samples. This is the most appropriate and safest course of action.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Acute adsorption of soluble A and B antigens from donor plasma transiently altered the patient’s red cell phenotype; defer testing and redraw a single EDTA tube in $24$ hours when the effect has dissipated.**\n**Analysis:** The premise is scientifically unsound in this context. The transfused unit was type $O$ packed RBCs, which contain neither A nor B antigens, nor significant amounts of plasma with soluble A/B substances. Even if such a phenomenon were possible, it would not explain the change in the reverse type (loss of anti-A and anti-B) or the strong forward grouping. Deferring investigation for $24$ hours in the face of a critical sample integrity issue and a potential transfusion reaction is clinically inappropriate.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "5229834"}]}
