Starting only from the fundamental relationships of circular motion, namely centripetal acceleration $a_{c} = \\omega^{2} r$, the definition $RCF = a_{c} / g$, and the kinematic link $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$ with $f = \\mathrm{RPM} / 60$, derive an expression for the required rotational speed in terms of $RCF$, $g$, and $r$, then compute the numerical value for this setup. Use $g = 9.80665$ m s$^{-2}$ and convert $r$ to meters. Express the final rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics, specifically circular motion, and is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and data for a unique solution. The parameters are realistic for a laboratory setting. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) and then calculate its numerical value for the given parameters. The derivation must start from the fundamental relationships provided.\n\nLet $N$ be the rotational speed in RPM. The provided relationships are:\n1.  Centripetal acceleration: $a_{c} = \\omega^{2} r$\n2.  Definition of Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF): $RCF = \\frac{a_{c}}{g}$\n3.  Angular velocity and frequency: $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$\n4.  Frequency and RPM: $f = \\frac{N}{60}$\n\nThe problem states a target RCF of $900 \\times g$. This is a common but slightly informal way of stating that the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ should be $900$ times the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. Using the formal definition provided, $RCF = \\frac{a_{c}}{g}$, we can determine the dimensionless value of RCF. If $a_c = 900g$, then $RCF = \\frac{900g}{g} = 900$. Thus, the numerical value for the variable $RCF$ is $900$.\n\nWe begin the derivation by combining the first two equations to relate RCF to the angular velocity $\\omega$.\nFrom the definition $RCF = \\frac{a_{c}}{g}$, we can express the centripetal acceleration as:\n$$a_{c} = RCF \\cdot g$$\nSubstituting the expression for centripetal acceleration, $a_{c} = \\omega^{2} r$, we get:\n$$\\omega^{2} r = RCF \\cdot g$$\nNow, we solve for the angular velocity $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega^{2} = \\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}$$\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nThe angular velocity $\\omega$ is in units of radians per second. The problem requires the final answer in revolutions per minute ($N$). We use the provided kinematic links to convert $\\omega$ to $N$.\nFirst, we relate angular velocity $\\omega$ to frequency $f$ (in Hz or revolutions per second):\n$$\\omega = 2 \\pi f$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\omega$:\n$$2 \\pi f = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nSolving for frequency $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nNext, we relate frequency $f$ to the rotational speed $N$ in RPM. Since there are $60$ seconds in a minute, the frequency in revolutions per second is the RPM value divided by $60$:\n$$f = \\frac{N}{60}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $f$:\n$$\\frac{N}{60} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $N$ to obtain the desired general expression for the rotational speed in RPM:\n$$N = \\frac{60}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the required rotational speed in terms of $RCF$, $g$, and $r$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are:\n-   $RCF = 900$ (dimensionless)\n-   $g = 9.80665 \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$\n-   $r = 10 \\, \\text{cm}$\n\nWe must use consistent units. The radius $r$ is converted to meters:\n$$r = 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.10 \\, \\text{m}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the derived formula for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{900 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}}{0.10 \\, \\text{m}}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\\frac{900 \\times 9.80665}{0.10} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} = \\frac{8825.985}{0.10} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} = 88259.85 \\, \\text{s}^{-2}$$\nNow, we take the square root:\n$$\\sqrt{88259.85 \\, \\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 297.085595 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we multiply by the pre-factor $\\frac{30}{\\pi}$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 297.085595 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe unit $\\text{s}^{-1}$ is revolutions per second. The factor of $60$ included in the derivation (via the term $30 = 60/2$) converts this to revolutions per minute.\n$$N \\approx 9.54929658 \\times 297.085595 \\approx 2836.953 \\, \\text{RPM}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N \\approx 2840 \\, \\text{RPM}$$\nTo express this with three significant figures unambiguously, we use scientific notation: $2.84 \\times 10^{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.84 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "5205327"}, {"introduction": "Once a potential red blood cell sensitization is detected, the investigation shifts from technique to diagnostic strategy. A positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is a critical finding, but it opens up more questions: are the cells coated with IgG, complement, or both?

Base your answer on core definitions and well-established facts: the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) detects in vivo coating of RBCs by adding Anti-Human Globulin (AHG) to thoroughly washed patient RBCs; polyspecific AHG contains both anti-IgG and anti-complement activity, whereas monospecific AHG contains only anti-IgG or only anti-complement (commonly anti–Complement component 3d (C3d)); Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulation prevents in vitro complement activation by chelating divalent cations. Check cells are required to validate negative antiglobulin tests. Choose the single best algorithm that will reliably discriminate the three sensitization categories while maintaining internal controls and scientific rigor.\n\nWhich of the following testing sequences is most appropriate?\n\nA. Collect EDTA-anticoagulated blood to prevent in vitro complement fixation. Wash patient RBCs to remove unbound serum proteins. Perform a DAT with polyspecific AHG. If negative, validate with IgG-sensitized check cells and report no significant in vivo coating. If positive, test the same washed RBCs in parallel with monospecific anti-IgG and monospecific anti-C3d. Interpret as follows: anti-IgG positive with anti-C3d negative indicates IgG-only; anti-IgG negative with anti-C3d positive indicates complement-only; both positive indicates mixed sensitization. Validate each negative monospecific tube with appropriate control cells (IgG-sensitized control cells for anti-IgG or polyspecific AHG; C3d-coated control cells for anti-C3d).\n\nB. Collect clotted blood (serum). Perform a DAT using monospecific anti-IgG only; if nonreactive, call complement-only coating; if reactive, call IgG-only coating; no further testing is required because anti-IgG reactivity excludes complement coating.\n\nC.

Because the patient’s red cell phenotype is unreliable post-transfusion, you plan to resolve the antibody specificity using a selected-cell mini-panel. The design principle must be based on first principles: antigen-antibody specificity (antibodies bind epitopes present on target antigens), the requirement that a specificity be demonstrated by reactivity to antigen-positive cells and nonreactivity to antigen-negative cells, and the phenomenon of dosage in the Rhesus system (stronger reactions when the target antigen is homozygously expressed).
