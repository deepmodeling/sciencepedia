Pulse**\n- Measured value: $x_{pulse} = 105\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$.\n- Acceptable range: $[L_{pulse}, U_{pulse}] = [50, 100]\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$.\n- Here, $x_{pulse}  U_{pulse}$, since $105  100$. The value exceeds the upper bound.\n- The fractional exceedance is calculated as $E_{pulse} = \\frac{x_{pulse} - U_{pulse}}{U_{pulse}}$.\n$$E_{pulse} = \\frac{105 - 100}{100} = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05$$\n\n**4. Temperature**\n- Measured value: $x_{temp} = 38.0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Acceptable range: Temperature $\\le 37.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This defines an upper bound $U_{temp} = 37.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Here, $x_{temp}  U_{temp}$, since $38.0  37.5$. The value exceeds the upper bound.\n- The fractional exceedance is calculated as $E_{temp} = \\frac{x_{temp} - U_{temp}}{U_{temp}}$.\n$$E_{temp} = \\frac{38.0 - 37.5}{37.5} = \\frac{0.5}{37.5} = \\frac{1}{75}$$\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{1}{75} \\approx 0.013333...$\n\nBased on these calculations, the donor is ineligible for donation because both the pulse and temperature are outside their respective acceptable ranges.\n\nThe total normalized exceedance $T$ is the sum of these individual values:\n$$T = E_{SBP} + E_{DBP} + E_{pulse} + E_{temp} = 0 + 0 + 0.05 + \\frac{1}{75}$$\n$$T = 0.05 + 0.013333... = 0.063333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

This signifies that a negative test result is highly reliable. The probability that a donor with a negative result is truly free of HCV infection is $99.998\\%$. Therefore, the assay is very effective at ruling out uninfected donors, ensuring the safety of the blood supply from those who test negative.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.28407$) is surprisingly low. This means that among all donors who test positive with this screening assay, only about $28.4\\%$ are actually infected with HCV. The remaining $71.6\\%$ of positive results are false positives. This outcome is a classic and critical consequence of applying a screening test, even one with high sensitivity and specificity, to a population with very low disease prevalence.\n\nThe low PPV dictates the necessity of a two-step testing strategy. It would be scientifically and ethically unsound to permanently defer a blood donor based solely on a single positive screening result, as more than $2$ out of $3$ such results are incorrect. Therefore, all initial positive screening results must be followed by a more specific, confirmatory test (e.g., a Nucleic Acid Test or NAT). The role of the initial screening assay is to be highly sensitive to cast a wide net and minimize the chance of missing an infected unit of blood (i.e., minimize false negatives). The role of the confirmatory test is to have extremely high specificity to accurately distinguish the true positives from the large number of false positives generated by the initial screen. This workflow ensures both the safety of the blood supply and the fair treatment of donors, preventing the unnecessary loss of healthy individuals from the donor pool.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.28407  0.99998 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5211909"}]}
