The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate the requested concentration.

The information about the dose ($2 \\, \\text{mg}$) is not required for the calculation but does not contradict other given information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information and fundamental pharmacokinetic principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to calculate the expected tacrolimus concentration for the morning trough sample taken after a missed evening dose.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in understanding the drug concentration at the time of the missed dose. The problem states the patient is at steady-state, with a trough concentration $C_{ss,trough} = 6.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$ just before each dose. This means that on a normal day, $12$ hours after the morning dose, the concentration has decayed to $6.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$, at which point the evening dose would be administered.\n\nOn the day in question, the patient does not take the evening dose. Therefore, at the time of the scheduled evening dose, the drug concentration is $C_{ss,trough} = 6.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$. Since no drug is administered, this concentration simply continues to decay according to first-order elimination kinetics.\n\nThe blood sample is drawn the next morning, which is one dosing interval, $\\tau = 12$ hours, after the missed evening dose. We must calculate the concentration after it has decayed for this duration.\n\nThe first-order elimination process is described by the equation:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration, $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, and $t$ is the elapsed time.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The initial concentration is the concentration at the time of the missed dose, so $C_0 = C_{ss,trough} = 6.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$.\n- The elapsed time is the interval between the missed dose and the measurement, so $t = \\tau = 12$ hours.\n\nThe elimination rate constant, $k_e$, is related to the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by the formula:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nGiven that $t_{1/2} = 12$ hours, the rate constant is:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12} \\text{ hr}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the decay equation to find the expected concentration, $C_{missed}$:\n$$C_{missed} = C_{ss,trough} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\n$$C_{missed} = (6.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL}) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12 \\text{ hr}}\\right) \\times 12 \\text{ hr}\\right)$$\n$$C_{missed} = 6.5 \\times \\exp(-\\ln(2))$$\nSince $\\exp(-\\ln(x)) = \\exp(\\ln(x^{-1})) = x^{-1}$, we have $\\exp(-\\ln(2)) = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$C_{missed} = 6.5 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$C_{missed} = 3.25 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$$\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.25 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$ already has exactly three significant figures.\n\nThe second task is to briefly discuss the clinical implications. A maintenance dose adjustment should **not** be made based on this single low trough concentration. The reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Identifiable Cause**: The low concentration is not a result of a change in the patient's intrinsic pharmacokinetics (e.g., increased metabolism or clearance). It is the direct, predictable, and fully-explained consequence of a known instance of non-adherence (the missed dose).\n2.  **Non-Steady-State Condition**: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is predicated on measurements taken at steady state to guide dosing. A sample taken after a missed dose is, by definition, not a steady-state sample and does not reflect the drug exposure the patient experiences on their prescribed regimen.\n3.  **Risk of Overcorrection**: If the dose were to be increased in response to this artifactually low level, the patient, upon resuming their normal adherent dosing schedule, would achieve a new, higher steady-state concentration. This would place them at an increased risk of supratherapeutic levels and dose-related toxicity (e.g., nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity).\n4.  **Appropriate Action**: The correct clinical action is to recognize the cause of the low level, counsel the patient on the importance of adherence, and continue the current maintenance dose. A follow-up trough level should be re-measured only after the patient has resumed the prescribed regimen for a sufficient period to re-establish steady state (typically $3-5$ half-lives).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.25}$$", "id": "5231937"}, {"introduction": "While linear models are useful, the pharmacokinetics of many drugs are governed by more complex, non-linear processes.

The core of the problem lies in the non-linear relationship between the whole-blood concentration $C_b$ and the plasma concentration $C_p$, which arises from the saturable partitioning of tacrolimus into erythrocytes.\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial plasma concentration, $C_{p,0}$, that corresponds to the given initial whole-blood concentration, $C_{b,0} = 6.0 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$.

The partition coefficient, $K_{ep}(C_p) = K_{\\infty} + (K_0 - K_{\\infty})\\frac{K_d}{K_d + C_p}$, is a decreasing function of the plasma concentration $C_p$. As the dose is doubled, $C_p$ doubles from $C_{p,0} \\approx 1.28 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$ to $C_{p,1} \\approx 2.56 \\, \\text{ng/mL}$. This increase in $C_p$ causes $K_{ep}$ to decrease, meaning the erythrocytes become relatively more saturated and take up proportionally less drug.\nSpecifically, $K_{ep}(C_{p,0}) \\approx 9.184$ while $K_{ep}(C_{p,1}) \\approx 8.644$.\nThe whole-blood concentration $C_b$ does not scale linearly with $C_p$. The relationship is $C_b = C_p \\times \\left[(1-H)+H \\cdot K_{ep}(C_p)\\right]$. Since the term in the brackets decreases as $C_p$ increases, the overall increase in $C_b$ is attenuated, resulting in a fold-change less than the fold-change in plasma concentration (and dose). If partitioning were linear ($K_{ep}$ constant), then $C_b$ would be directly proportional to $C_p$, and doubling the dose would double $C_b$. The saturable nature of erythrocyte binding breaks this simple proportionality.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.896}\n$$", "id": "5232002"}]}
