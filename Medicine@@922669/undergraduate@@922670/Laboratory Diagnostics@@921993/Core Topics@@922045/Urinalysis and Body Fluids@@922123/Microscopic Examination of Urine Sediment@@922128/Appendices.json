The stage micrometer has a $1\\,\\text{mm}$ scale divided into $100$ parts.\nLet $L_{SMD}$ be the length of one stage micrometer division.\n$$L_{SMD} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{mm}}{100} = 0.01\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nNext, we use the calibration data to find the physical length corresponding to a single EPM division. It is given that $26$ EPM divisions coincide with $11.5$ stage micrometer divisions. Let $L_{cal}$ be the total physical length used for calibration.\n$$L_{cal} = 11.5 \\times L_{SMD} = 11.5 \\times 0.01\\,\\text{mm} = 0.115\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThis physical length, $L_{cal}$, corresponds to $26$ EPM divisions. Let $C$ be the calibration factor, representing the physical length in millimeters per EPM division.\n$$C = \\frac{L_{cal}}{26\\,\\text{EPM divisions}} = \\frac{0.115\\,\\text{mm}}{26} \\approx 0.004423077\\,\\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{EPM division}}$$\nThis is the calibrated length per EPM division.\n\nNow, we can calculate the diameter of the field of view, $D_{FOV}$, in millimeters. The diameter is measured to be $103$ EPM divisions.\n$$D_{FOV} = 103\\,\\text{EPM divisions} \\times C = 103 \\times \\frac{0.115\\,\\text{mm}}{26}$$\n$$D_{FOV} = \\frac{11.845\\,\\text{mm}}{26} \\approx 0.45557692\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_{FOV} \\approx 0.4556\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the area of the circular field of view, $A_{FOV}$, in square millimeters. The area of a circle is given by $A = \\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$. Using the unrounded value for the diameter to maintain precision, we have:\n$$A_{FOV} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D_{FOV}^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( \\frac{11.845}{26} \\right)^2 \\text{mm}^2$$\n$$A_{FOV} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} (0.45557692)^2 \\text{mm}^2 \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} (0.20755013) \\text{mm}^2 \\approx 0.1630105\\,\\text{mm}^2$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$A_{FOV} \\approx 0.1630\\,\\text{mm}^2$$\n\nThe requested values are the field diameter and the field area, rounded to four significant figures.\nDiameter: $0.4556\\,\\text{mm}$\nArea: $0.1630\\,\\text{mm}^2$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4556  0.1630 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5231404"}, {"introduction": "With a calibrated microscope, you can now translate the number of cells observed in a single field into a clinically meaningful concentration.

The solution will be derived from the provided first principles and data.\n\nLet us define the given variables:\n- Initial volume of the urine specimen: $V_{o} = 15\\,\\text{mL}$\n- Final volume of the resuspended sediment: $V_{s} = 0.5\\,\\text{mL}$\n- Average number of RBCs per High Power Field: $N_{HPF} = 5$\n- Projected area of the High Power Field: $A = 0.18\\,\\text{mm}^2$\n- Thickness of the fluid layer under the coverslip: $h = 0.02\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three logical steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of a single High Power Field ($V_{HPF}$).

Concentration is defined as the number of particles per unit volume. The problem states that the average count of $N_{HPF} = 5$ RBCs is observed within the volume $V_{HPF}$. The assumption of uniform distribution allows us to use this ratio to define the concentration.\n$$C_{s} = \\frac{N_{HPF}}{V_{HPF}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$C_{s} = \\frac{5\\,\\text{RBC}}{3.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{mL}}$$\n\nThird, we relate the concentration in the sediment ($C_s$) to the concentration in the original specimen ($C_o$). The problem states that there is no loss or lysis of cells. This implies that the total number of cells, $N_{total}$, is conserved throughout the process.\nThe total number of cells in the resuspended sediment is the product of its concentration and volume:\n$$N_{total} = C_{s} \\times V_{s}$$\nThis same total number of cells was originally present in the initial urine volume $V_{o}$. Therefore, the original concentration $C_{o}$ is:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{N_{total}}{V_{o}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{total}$:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{C_{s} \\times V_{s}}{V_{o}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $C_{s}$:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{N_{HPF}}{V_{HPF}}\\right) \\times V_{s}}{V_{o}} = \\frac{N_{HPF} \\times V_{s}}{V_{HPF} \\times V_{o}}$$\nThis final expression relates the desired original concentration $C_o$ to the quantities given in the problem.

The first four significant digits are $4$, $6$, $2$, and $9$. The fifth digit is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$C_{o} \\approx 46300\\,\\text{RBC/mL}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation to explicitly show four significant figures:\n$$C_{o} = 4.630 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{RBC/mL}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.630 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "5231429"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative microscopy is not just about a single count; it's about the consistency and reliability of your measurements.
