The solution is based on the principle of conservation of cell counts in a mixture.\n\nLet the following variables represent the concentrations of cells (in cells/$\\mu$L):\n- $[WBC]_{syn, meas}$: The measured white blood cell concentration in the synovial fluid.\n- $[RBC]_{syn, meas}$: The measured red blood cell concentration in the synovial fluid.\n- $[WBC]_{syn, native}$: The true, native white blood cell concentration in the synovial fluid.\n- $[WBC]_{contam}$: The concentration of contaminating white blood cells from peripheral blood.\n- $[RBC]_{contam}$: The concentration of contaminating red blood cells from peripheral blood.\n- $R_{blood}$: The ratio of white blood cells to red blood cells in the peripheral blood, given as $\\frac{[WBC]_{blood}}{[RBC]_{blood}}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n$[WBC]_{syn, meas} = 5.43 \\times 10^{3}$\n$[RBC]_{syn, meas} = 1.00 \\times 10^{5}$\n$R_{blood} = 0.010$\n\nThe problem is governed by three key assumptions which we formalize as follows:\n1.  All observed synovial fluid RBCs are from peripheral blood contamination. This implies that the measured RBC concentration in the synovial fluid is equal to the concentration of contaminating RBCs.\n    $$[RBC]_{contam} = [RBC]_{syn, meas}$$\n2.  The contribution of contaminating WBCs scales with the peripheral blood WBC-to-RBC ratio. This means the ratio of contaminating WBCs to contaminating RBCs is equal to the ratio found in peripheral blood.\n    $$\\frac{[WBC]_{contam}}{[RBC]_{contam}} = R_{blood}$$\n3.  The native and contaminant WBC concentrations are additive. The total measured WBC concentration is the sum of the native concentration and the concentration from contamination.\n    $$[WBC]_{syn, meas} = [WBC]_{syn, native} + [WBC]_{contam}$$\n\nOur objective is to find $[WBC]_{syn, native}$. From assumption $3$, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the native concentration:\n$$[WBC]_{syn, native} = [WBC]_{syn, meas} - [WBC]_{contam}$$\n\nTo find $[WBC]_{contam}$, we use assumptions $1$ and $2$. From assumption $2$, we have:\n$$[WBC]_{contam} = R_{blood} \\times [RBC]_{contam}$$\nSubstituting $[RBC]_{contam}$ with $[RBC]_{syn, meas}$ from assumption $1$:\n$$[WBC]_{contam} = R_{blood} \\times [RBC]_{syn, meas}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value for the contaminating WBC concentration:\n$$[WBC]_{contam} = 0.010 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{5}) = 1000 = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this value back into the equation for the native WBC concentration:\n$$[WBC]_{syn, native} = [WBC]_{syn, meas} - [WBC]_{contam}$$\n$$[WBC]_{syn, native} = (5.43 \\times 10^{3}) - (1.00 \\times 10^{3})$$\n$$[WBC]_{syn, native} = (5.43 - 1.00) \\times 10^{3}$$\n$$[WBC]_{syn, native} = 4.43 \\times 10^{3}$$\n\nThe calculated corrected synovial white blood cell concentration is $4.43 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$.

The language is objective and uses standard medical terminology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe determination of the type of joint effusion is based on the analysis of several key laboratory parameters. We will evaluate the given data in the context of the four standard classifications of synovial fluid: noninflammatory, inflammatory, septic, and hemorrhagic.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- White Blood Cell (WBC) count = $18{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n- Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil (PMN) fraction = $85\\%$\n- Gross appearance = turbid yellow\n- Synovial glucose ($G_{\\text{synovial}}$) = $40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- Concurrent serum glucose ($G_{\\text{serum}}$) = $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\n1.  **Analysis of Parameters:**\n    - **WBC Count:** A WBC count of $18{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ is markedly elevated. Normal synovial fluid has a WBC count less than $200/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Noninflammatory effusions (e.g., from osteoarthritis) typically have WBC counts below $2{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Inflammatory effusions (e.g., from rheumatoid arthritis or gout) generally fall in the range of $2{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ to $75{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Septic (infectious) arthritis is characterized by very high WBC counts, usually greater than $50{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The observed value of $18{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ fits within the inflammatory category, but it is also a possible, albeit low, finding for septic arthritis. It definitively rules out a noninflammatory process.\n    - **PMN Fraction:** The PMN fraction of $85\\%$ indicates a strong neutrophilic predominance. Normal and noninflammatory fluids have a PMN fraction of less than $25\\%$. Inflammatory conditions typically show a PMN fraction greater than $50\\%$. Septic arthritis is distinguished by a very high percentage of neutrophils, almost always greater than $75\\%$ and often exceeding $90\\%$. The measured value of $85\\%$ is a strong pointer towards a septic process, although severe acute inflammatory conditions, such as crystal-induced arthritis, can occasionally present with similar PMN levels.\n    - **Gross Appearance:** The fluid's appearance is described as \"turbid yellow\". Turbidity in synovial fluid is caused by a high concentration of cells (leukocytes), fibrin, or crystals, which scatter light. This appearance is inconsistent with the clear, transparent nature of normal or noninflammatory fluid. It is characteristic of both inflammatory and septic effusions. Hemorrhagic effusions would appear red, pink, or brown.\n    - **Serum-to-Synovial Glucose Differential ($\\Delta G$):** Glucose enters the synovium from the blood via passive diffusion. In a healthy or noninflammatory state, the glucose concentration in the synovial fluid is nearly equal to that in the serum. The serum-to-synovial glucose differential, $\\Delta G$, is defined as $\\Delta G = G_{\\text{serum}} - G_{\\text{synovial}}$. In conditions with high cellular activity, particularly septic arthritis, glucose is consumed by both the infectious microorganisms and the numerous phagocytic neutrophils. This metabolic activity leads to a significant drop in the synovial glucose level and a large differential.\n    We compute the differential using the given values:\n    $$ \\Delta G = G_{\\text{serum}} - G_{\\text{synovial}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} - 40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\n    A differential of less than $10\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is normal. In most inflammatory conditions, the differential remains relatively small (e.g., $25\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$). A differential greater than $25\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, and especially one greater than $40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, is a classic and highly specific indicator of septic arthritis.\n\n2.  **Synthesis and Classification:**\n    When synthesizing the results, the WBC count of $18{,}000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ and the high PMN fraction of $85\\%$ clearly point away from a noninflammatory process and towards a severe inflammatory or septic one. The turbid appearance is consistent with this. However, the most decisive parameter in this case is the serum-to-synovial glucose differential. The calculated value of $\\Delta G = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is profoundly large and is the most powerful indicator, among the data provided, for a septic process. The combination of a PMN fraction $75\\%$ and a glucose differential $40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is highly characteristic of septic arthritis. Therefore, the most consistent classification for this effusion is **septic**.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The problem requires the calculation of the serum-to-synovial glucose differential, $\\Delta G$, rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$ \\Delta G = 90 - 40 = 50 $$\n    To express the result $50$ to three significant figures, we write it as $50.0$.

The problem provides the following values:\n- Pretest probability: $P(\\text{PJI}) = P(D) = 0.35$\n- Positive Likelihood Ratio: $\\text{LR}^+ = 26$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$P(\\text{PJI} \\mid \\text{alpha-defensin positive}) = \\frac{26 \\cdot 0.35}{26 \\cdot 0.35 + (1 - 0.35)}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the products and sums:\n- Numerator: $26 \\times 0.35 = 9.1$\n- Denominator: $(26 \\times 0.35) + (1 - 0.35) = 9.1 + 0.65 = 9.75$\n\nSo, the post-test probability is:\n$$P(\\text{PJI} \\mid \\text{alpha-defensin positive}) = \\frac{9.1}{9.75}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\frac{9.1}{9.75} \\approx 0.933333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
