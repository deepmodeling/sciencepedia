Therefore, each molecule contributes one osmotically active particle.

This means that for each mole of a sodium salt (e.g., $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) or a potassium salt (e.g., $\\mathrm{KCl}$), two moles of osmotically active particles are produced upon dissociation (one cation and one anion).\n\n    The total concentration of the given cations is the sum of the sodium and potassium concentrations:\n    $$C_{cations} = C_{Na} + C_K = 100\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} + 50\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$$\n    These cations contribute $150\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$ to the total osmolarity.\n\n    To maintain electroneutrality, the total concentration of monovalent counter-anions, $C_{anions}$, must equal the total concentration of cations:\n    $$C_{anions} = C_{cations} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$$\n    These anions contribute an additional $150\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$ to the total osmolarity.\n\n    Therefore, the total osmolar contribution from the electrolytes is the sum of the contributions from the cations and their counter-anions:\n    $$Osm_{electrolytes} = C_{cations} + C_{anions} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 150\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} = 300\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$$\n    This can be expressed equivalently as $2 \\times (C_{Na} + C_K)$.\n\nThe total calculated osmolarity, $Osm_{calc}$, is the sum of the contributions from all solutes:\n$$Osm_{calc} = (\\text{Contribution from urea}) + (\\text{Contribution from glucose}) + (\\text{Contribution from electrolytes})$$\n$$Osm_{calc} = C_{urea} + C_{glucose} + 2 \\times (C_{Na} + C_K)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$Osm_{calc} = 200\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 50\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 2 \\times (100\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 50\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L})$$\n$$Osm_{calc} = 250\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 2 \\times (150\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L})$$\n$$Osm_{calc} = 250\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L} + 300\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$$\n$$Osm_{calc} = 550\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/L}$$\n\nBased on the problem's simplifying assumption, this osmolarity value is taken to be numerically equal to the osmolality:\n$$Osm_{calc} = 550\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg\\ H_2O}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the osmolar gap, $Osm_{gap}$.

The rest of the reagent strip is unremarkable for blood, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and protein. No obvious turbidity is noted, and the color is light yellow.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning:\n- Specific gravity (SG) is defined as the ratio of the density of a solution to the density of water at a specified temperature; reagent strip SG estimates ionic strength by a polyelectrolyte indicator and is therefore primarily responsive to ionic solutes.\n- Osmolality is defined as the number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of solvent; FPD osmometry relies on the colligative property that the depression of the freezing point is proportional to total solute particle concentration, regardless of charge or molecular identity.\n- Refractometry-based SG responds to the refractive index of the solution and therefore tracks total solute concentration, including nonionic solutes.\n\nA discrepancy exists: dipstick SG is low, but FPD osmolality is high. From first principles and the core definitions above, this pattern suggests an abundance of osmotically active particles that are not primarily ionic, leading to an underestimation by the dipstick SG but a high osmolality by FPD.\n\nWhich of the following test sequences is the most appropriate to resolve the discrepancy and converge on a likely cause?\n\nA. Verify patient identification and sample integrity; immediately repeat FPD osmolality to confirm reproducibility; measure SG by refractometry; if refractometer SG is high relative to the dipstick, screen for nonionic osmoles by enzymatic urine glucose and review medications for mannitol, glycine, or sorbitol exposure; if still unexplained, request a vapor pressure osmometry measurement to assess for volatile solutes; integrate results by calculating a urinary osmolar gap from urinary electrolytes and urea to corroborate the presence of unmeasured nonionic osmoles.\n\nB. Accept the FPD osmolality as definitive and report the sample as highly concentrated; disregard the dipstick SG as methodologically inferior and perform no further testing, since FPD osmolality reflects a fundamental colligative property.\n\nC. Assume interference by radiographic contrast media; order only a refractometer SG and, if high, attribute the pattern to contrast medium contamination without further tests, because contrast agents increase total solute concentration and thus cause both high refractometer SG and high FPD osmolality.\n\nD. Replace the FPD method with a conductivity-based osmometer to obtain an “ionic osmolality” that should match the dipstick SG; if the conductivity osmolality is low, report instrument interference for the FPD osmometer and do not pursue glucose testing or medication review, since ionic contribution determines the clinically relevant urine concentration.", "solution": "The correct answer is **A**.\n\nThis clinical scenario presents a classic discrepancy: a very low reagent strip specific gravity ($1.005$) indicating low ionic strength, alongside a high freezing point depression osmolality ($780$ mOsm/kg) indicating a high total concentration of solute particles.
