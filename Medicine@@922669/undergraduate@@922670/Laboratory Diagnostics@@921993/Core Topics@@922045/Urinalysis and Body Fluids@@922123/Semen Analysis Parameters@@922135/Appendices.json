The use of an Improved Neubauer hemocytometer, sample dilution, and manual counting are standard procedures in andrology and cell biology. The dimensions given for the chamber are correct ($A=1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, $d=0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The assumption that counting variability follows a Poisson distribution is a fundamental and correct principle for randomly and independently distributed particles. The problem is well-posed, as it asks for a standard statistical quantity (a confidence interval) based on sufficient data. It is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe problem requires the determination of a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true sperm concentration in an undiluted sample, based on a single count from a diluted sample.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the number of counted sperm, $N$, and the estimated sperm concentration in the original sample, $\\hat{C}_{orig}$. The volume of the chamber in which the sperm were counted is given by the product of the area and depth:\n$$V_{chamber} = A \\times d$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{chamber} = (1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2) \\times (0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3$$\nThe final result must be in units involving milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$). We must convert the volume from cubic millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^3$) to milliliters. The conversion is $1\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3 = (10\\,\\mathrm{mm})^3 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3$. Therefore, $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3 = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V_{chamber} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe concentration in the diluted sample, $\\hat{C}_{dil}$, is the number of sperm counted divided by the volume in which they were counted:\n$$\\hat{C}_{dil} = \\frac{N}{V_{chamber}} = \\frac{200}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{sperm/mL}$$\nTo find the concentration in the original, undiluted sample, we must multiply by the dilution factor, $D$.\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = \\hat{C}_{dil} \\times D = (2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{sperm/mL}) \\times 20 = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{sperm/mL}$$\nThis value, $\\hat{C}_{orig}$, is a point estimate of the true concentration. The problem asks for a $95\\%$ confidence interval, which requires us to account for the statistical uncertainty in the count, $N$.\n\nThe problem states that the counting variability is described by Poisson statistics. This means the observed count, $N$, is a single realization of a Poisson random variable, whose true mean and variance are both equal to an unknown parameter, $\\lambda$. Our best estimate for $\\lambda$ is the observed count, $N=200$.\n$$N \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$$\n$$E[N] = \\lambda, \\quad \\mathrm{Var}(N) = \\lambda$$\nFor a large number of counts (typically $N > 30$), the Poisson distribution can be well approximated by a Normal (Gaussian) distribution. Since $N=200$, this approximation is highly accurate.\n$$N \\approx \\mathcal{N}(\\lambda, \\lambda)$$\nWe seek a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true mean count, $\\lambda$. Using the Normal approximation, where the standard deviation is estimated as $\\sqrt{N}$, the confidence interval is constructed as:\n$$\\lambda \\in [N - z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{N}, N + z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{N}]$$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. The critical value $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$ from the standard Normal distribution is approximately $1.96$.\nThe observed count is $N=200$. The estimated standard deviation of the count is $\\sigma_N \\approx \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe margin of error for the count is:\n$$E_{count} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{200} \\approx 1.96 \\times 14.1421356 \\approx 27.718585$$\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true mean count $\\lambda$ is therefore:\n$$\\lambda \\in [200 - 27.718585, 200 + 27.718585]$$\n$$\\lambda \\in [172.281415, 227.718585]$$\nThis is the confidence interval for the true number of sperm in the counting volume $V_{chamber}$ for the diluted sample. To find the confidence interval for the true concentration in the original sample, $C_{orig}$, we apply the same conversion formula used for the point estimate. The relationship is $C_{orig} = \\frac{\\lambda \\times D}{V_{chamber}}$.\nLet the conversion factor be $k = \\frac{D}{V_{chamber}}$:\n$$k = \\frac{20}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 2 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nThe confidence interval for the concentration is obtained by multiplying the endpoints of the interval for $\\lambda$ by this factor $k$.\nLower bound of concentration, $C_{lower}$:\n$$C_{lower} = k \\times \\lambda_{lower} = (2 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\times 172.281415 = 344.56283 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1} = 34.456283 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nUpper bound of concentration, $C_{upper}$:\n$$C_{upper} = k \\times \\lambda_{upper} = (2 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\times 227.718585 = 455.43717 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1} = 45.543717 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the endpoints to be expressed in units of $10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ and rounded to four significant figures.\nRounding the lower bound:\n$$34.456283 \\to 34.46$$\nRounding the upper bound:\n$$45.543717 \\to 45.54$$\nThus, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true sperm concentration is $[34.46 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}, 45.54 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n34.46 & 45.54\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5237116"}, {"introduction": "Many clinically significant parameters are derived from several individual measurements, and this practice focuses on one such key indicator: the Total Motile Sperm Count ($TMSC$).

This value is outside the $+3\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}$ limit of $69.0$. This is a rejection event, indicating potential random error.\n\n2.  **$2\\text{-}2\\sigma$ Rule:** Two consecutive control observations are outside $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$ on the same side of the mean. This applies within a single control level or across control levels within the same run.\n    -   **Violation (within a level):** On day $5$, the low-level control is $18.0$, exactly on the $+2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}$ limit. On day $6$, it is $18.3$, which is $+2.20\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}$. These are two consecutive measurements exceeding $+2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (or on the limit for the first point). This violates the $2\\text{-}2\\sigma$ rule and constitutes a rejection, indicating systematic error.\n\n3.  **$R\\text{-}4\\sigma$ Rule:** The range between two control observations within a single run exceeds $4\\sigma$. This is typically applied as one control being $>+2\\sigma$ and the other being $<-2\\sigma$.\n    -   **Violation:** On day $4$, the low-level control is $12.0$ (at $-2.00\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}$) and the high-level control is $66.5$ (at $+2.17\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}$). The two points are on opposite sides of the mean and are both outside their respective $2\\sigma$ limits (or on the limit for the low control). This is a classic $R\\text{-}4\\sigma$ violation and a rejection event, pointing to random error affecting the two levels differently.\n\n4.  **$4\\text{-}1\\sigma$ Rule:** Four consecutive observations exceed $\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma$ on the same side of the mean.\n    -   **Violation:** For the high-level control, the results for days $1, 2, 3,$ and $4$ are $63.5$ ($+1.17\\sigma$), $63.8$ ($+1.27\\sigma$), $63.6$ ($+1.20\\sigma$), and $66.5$ ($+2.17\\sigma$). All four are consecutive and exceed the $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}} + 1\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}$ limit of $63.0$. This is a $4\\text{-}1\\sigma$ violation and a rejection event, indicating systematic error.\n\n5.  **$10x$ Rule:** Ten consecutive observations fall on the same side of the mean.\n    -   **Violation:** For the high-level control, all $10$ reported values (from $61.2$ to $69.5$) are greater than the mean of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}} = 60.0$. This constitutes a $10x$ violation and a rejection event, strongly indicating a systematic error, such as a positive bias or a shift in the mean.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe quality control data exhibit multiple rejection rule violations ($1\\text{-}3\\sigma$, $2\\text{-}2\\sigma$, $R\\text{-}4\\sigma$, $4\\text{-}1\\sigma$, and $10x$). These violations indicate the presence of both significant random error (suggested by $1\\text{-}3\\sigma$ and $R\\text{-}4\\sigma$) and significant systematic error (suggested by $2\\text{-}2\\sigma$, $4\\text{-}1\\sigma$, and $10x$). The analytical process is clearly out of statistical control. Therefore, the entire run must be rejected, and patient testing must be halted until the root causes are identified and corrected.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Accept the run because only $1\\text{-}2\\sigma$ warning conditions occurred; continue patient testing and monitor the next few control points.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The analysis reveals multiple hard *rejection* rules have been violated, not just the $1\\text{-}2\\sigma$ *warning* rule. Continuing patient testing under these conditions would be a major breach of laboratory protocol and could lead to erroneous patient results.\n\n**B. Reject the run because multiple Westgard reject rules are violated ($1\\text{-}3\\sigma$, $2\\text{-}2\\sigma$, $R\\text{-}4\\sigma$, $4\\text{-}1\\sigma$, and $10x$); halt testing, investigate both random and systematic causes (verify latex bead suspension mixing and pipetting, inspect the counting chamber or CASA calibration and detection thresholds, check control lot integrity), re-establish $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ if the lot or method changed, then re-run controls and all affected patient specimens after corrective actions.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. It accurately identifies that the run must be rejected. It correctly lists the specific rejection rules that my analysis has confirmed are violated. The proposed corrective actions are comprehensive and scientifically appropriate for addressing the types of errors detected (both random and systematic). It includes halting testing, investigating potential causes (instrumental, reagent, procedural), considering the need to re-characterize control materials, and finally, re-running controls and affected patient samples. This represents the standard of care in clinical laboratory quality management.\n\n**C. Reject only the low-level control due to $2\\text{-}2\\sigma$; the high-level control is acceptable, so proceed with patient testing after re-running the low-level control.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. It correctly identifies one violation on the low-level control but completely ignores the multiple, severe violations on the high-level control ($1\\text{-}3\\sigma, 4\\text{-}1\\sigma, 10x$) and the across-level \"range\" rule ($R\\text{-}4\\sigma$). SQC rules apply to the entire analytical run; one cannot selectively accept one control level while rejecting another. The entire run is invalid.\n\n**D. Accept the run but shift the control means to the observed values and continue testing without re-running patient specimens, because the data indicate a stable mean shift.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. While the $10x$ rule violation suggests a mean shift, the process is not stable, as evidenced by the random error violations ($1\\text{-}3\\sigma$ and $R\\text{-}4\\sigma$). A mean cannot be arbitrarily shifted without a thorough investigation to identify the cause. Furthermore, accepting the run and not re-running patient specimens is against fundamental QC principles, as the patient results from this run are unreliable. New means may only be established after the system is proven to be stable under new, corrected conditions.\n\n**E. Reject the run but only repeat the single outlier associated with the $1\\text{-}3\\sigma$ rule; no broader investigation or re-testing is needed.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. This action is grossly insufficient. While the $1\\text{-}3\\sigma$ violation is cause for rejection, it is only one of many flags. The other violations ($2\\text{-}2\\sigma, 4\\text{-}1\\sigma, 10x$) point to a deep-seated systematic problem that will not be solved by repeating a single control point. A comprehensive investigation is required to restore the integrity of the analytical system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5237124"}]}
