This approach aggregates the data before estimation, effectively weighting the data by the amount of sample represented on each plate.\n\nThe total number of colonies counted is $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$.\nThe volume of the original specimen effectively plated to yield $C_1$ is $V_{eff,1} = V d_1$.\nThe volume of the original specimen effectively plated to yield $C_2$ is $V_{eff,2} = V d_2$.\nThe total effective volume of the original specimen across both plates is $V_{eff,total} = V_{eff,1} + V_{eff,2} = V d_1 + V d_2 = V(d_1 + d_2)$.\n\nThe combined estimator for the concentration, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is therefore:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{C_{total}}{V_{eff,total}} = \\frac{C_1 + C_2}{V(d_1 + d_2)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$C_1 + C_2 = 280 + 22 = 302$$\n$$V(d_1 + d_2) = (10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mL})(10^{-1} + 10^{-2}) = (10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mL})(0.1 + 0.01) = (10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mL})(0.11)$$\nSo, the estimated concentration is:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{302}{0.11 \\times 10^{-3}} \\frac{\\mathrm{CFU}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{302}{1.1 \\times 10^{-4}} \\frac{\\mathrm{CFU}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nNext, we must identify the applicable threshold for significant bacteriuria.
