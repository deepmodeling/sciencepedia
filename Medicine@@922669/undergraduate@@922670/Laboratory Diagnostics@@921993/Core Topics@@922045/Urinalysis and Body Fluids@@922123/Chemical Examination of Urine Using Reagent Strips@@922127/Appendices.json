It is a standard, well-posed problem in applied biochemistry and bioprocess engineering. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: model construction, derivation of the signal expression, and numerical computation.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the GOx Rate Model**\n\nThe enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidation by glucose oxidase (GOx) follows the general scheme for an enzyme ($E$) acting on a substrate ($S$) to form a product ($P$), with an intermediate enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$). Here, $S$ is glucose and $P$ is hydrogen peroxide.\n\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} E + P\n$$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rates of change for the involved species are described by differential equations. The rate of formation of the $ES$ complex is given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1[E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] = k_1[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]\n$$\n\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over time, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$.\n\n$$\nk_1[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]\n$$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ is constant and is the sum of the free enzyme $[E]$ and the complexed enzyme $[ES]$:\n\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_T - [ES]\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation:\n\n$$\nk_1([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]\n$$\n\nRearranging to solve for $[ES]$:\n\n$$\nk_1[E]_T[S] - k_1[ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] \\\\\nk_1[E]_T[S] = (k_1[S] + k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] \\\\\n[ES] = \\frac{k_1[E]_T[S]}{k_1[S] + k_{-1} + k_2}\n$$\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T[S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}}\n$$\n\nThe rate of the reaction, $v$, is the rate of product formation, which is proportional to the concentration of the $ES$ complex:\n\n$$\nv = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[ES]\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n\n$$\nv = \\frac{k_2[E]_T[S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}}\n$$\n\nWe define two key parameters:\n1.  The maximum reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$, which occurs when the enzyme is saturated with substrate ($[ES] \\approx [E]_T$): $V_{\\max} = k_2[E]_T$.\n2.  The Michaelis constant, $K_m$, which is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{\\max}$: $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions yields the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\n\nThis equation is the required rate model for the GOx enzyme.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Signal Expression $S(c)$**\n\nNow, we adapt this general model to the specific conditions of the reagent strip.\nThe substrate is glucose. The effective glucose concentration in the pad, $[S]$, is given as a fraction $\\lambda$ of the bulk urine concentration $c$:\n\n$$\n[S] = \\lambda c\n$$\n\nThe rate of production of hydrogen peroxide, $v = \\frac{d[H_2O_2]}{dt}$, is therefore:\n\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}(\\lambda c)}{K_m + \\lambda c}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that this rate $v$ can be considered constant over the readout time $\\tau$. The total concentration of $H_2O_2$ produced and accumulated during this interval, denoted as $[H_2O_2]_{\\text{acc}}$, is the rate multiplied by the time duration:\n\n$$\n[H_2O_2]_{\\text{acc}} = v \\cdot \\tau = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} \\lambda c}{K_m + \\lambda c} \\right) \\tau\n$$\n\nThe colorimetric signal $S(c)$ is directly proportional to this accumulated concentration with a calibration factor $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\nS(c) = \\alpha \\cdot [H_2O_2]_{\\text{acc}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the accumulated peroxide, we obtain the final analytic expression for the signal as a function of the bulk glucose concentration $c$:\n\n$$\nS(c) = \\alpha \\tau \\frac{V_{\\max} \\lambda c}{K_m + \\lambda c}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the signal $S$ for a glucose concentration of $c = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ using the given parameters:\n- $K_{m} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $V_{\\max} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mM\\,min^{-1}}$\n- $\\lambda = 0.60$\n- $\\tau = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\alpha = 200\\,\\mathrm{a.u.\\,mM^{-1}}$\n- $c = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistency in units. The rate $V_{\\max}$ is given in $\\mathrm{mM\\,min^{-1}}$, while the time $\\tau$ is in seconds.

The light sensitivity of bilirubin and its photoconversion to biliverdin are well-established facts in clinical chemistry. Modeling this process as a first-order decay is a standard and appropriate kinetic model for unimolecular reactions under constant conditions (i.e., constant light intensity).

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe unimolecular photodegradation of bilirubin is stated to follow first-order kinetics. The fundamental rate law for a first-order decay of a reactant with concentration $C$ is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant and $t$ is time.\n\nTo find the time-dependent concentration $C(t)$, we solve this differential equation by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial condition at $t=0$, where the concentration is $C_0$, to a later time $t$, where the concentration is $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} \\, dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(C')]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt\n$$\nThis can be rearranged using the properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the derived expression for the time-dependent concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe rate constant $k$ is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time at which the concentration has decreased to half of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = C_0/2$.
