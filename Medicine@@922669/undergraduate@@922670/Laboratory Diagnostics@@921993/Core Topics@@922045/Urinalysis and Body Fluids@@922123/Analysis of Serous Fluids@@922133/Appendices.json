In laboratory diagnostics, exudative versus transudative pleural effusions are distinguished based on physicochemical properties that reflect the underlying pathophysiology of fluid formation. From first principles, transudates arise due to imbalances in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures with intact vascular permeability, whereas exudates result from increased capillary permeability and local inflammation, leading to higher macromolecule content and cellular enzymes in the effusion compared to serum. A well-tested operationalization of these differences uses pleural fluid to serum comparisons of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as the pleural fluid LDH relative to the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for serum LDH.\n\nYou are provided the following measured values from the same time point:\n- Pleural fluid total protein: $3.9$ g/dL\n- Serum total protein: $6.5$ g/dL\n- Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): $360$ U/L\n- Serum LDH: $180$ U/L\n- Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for serum LDH for the laboratory method used: $220$ U/L\n\nUsing the standard pleural fluid classification criteria applied in clinical practice, compute the pleural fluid to serum ratio for total protein and the pleural fluid to serum ratio for LDH, and assess whether the pleural fluid LDH exceeds two-thirds of the serum LDH ULN. An effusion is classified as exudate if any one of these comparisons indicates a pleural fluid elevation consistent with increased permeability; otherwise, it is classified as transudate. Define a classification code $I$ such that $I=1$ if the effusion is an exudate and $I=0$ if it is a transudate. Report the single value of $I$ as your final answer. No rounding is required.

A well-tested set of criteria operationalizes this difference using comparisons of pleural fluid and serum protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), commonly known as Light’s criteria, which classify an effusion as exudate if any of the following hold: the pleural fluid to serum protein ratio exceeds a threshold, the pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio exceeds a threshold, or the pleural fluid LDH exceeds two-thirds of the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for serum LDH.\n\nCompute the pleural fluid to serum protein ratio.

The laboratory procedure and observations are as follows. The specimen is first diluted at a ratio of $1:5$ (one part fluid to four parts isotonic diluent) to minimize protein-related clumping and facilitate counting. The diluted specimen is loaded onto a Neubauer hemocytometer, whose large squares each have area $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ and chamber depth $d = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Nucleated cells are counted in $k = 5$ large squares, with counts: $23$, $27$, $25$, $31$, and $24$.

Use foundational definitions that relate number, volume, dilution, and proportions to derive the absolute PMN concentration in the original fluid.\n\nStarting only from the definitions that concentration is number per volume, that a dilution by a factor $D$ reduces measured concentration by $D$, and that a fraction determined by a differential count applies to the entire nucleated cell population, perform the following:\n\n1.
