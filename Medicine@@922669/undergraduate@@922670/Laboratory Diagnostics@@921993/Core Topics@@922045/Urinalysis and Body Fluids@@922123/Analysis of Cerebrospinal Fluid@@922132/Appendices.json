The hemocytometer has chamber depth $d = 0.1\\,\\text{mm}$ and each large square has area $A = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}^2$, so the volume under one large square is $V = A \\cdot d = 0.1\\,\\text{mm}^3$, which equals $0.1\\,\\mu\\text{L}$ (since $1\\,\\text{mm}^3 = 1\\,\\mu\\text{L}$). Two chambers are loaded from the same CSF aliquot.\n\nFor WBCs, the CSF is diluted $1{:}1$ with Türk solution, so the dilution factor is $D_{\\mathrm{W}}=2$.

For a total count $N_{\\text{total}}$, which is the sum of independent Poisson counts, the variance is equal to the mean, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma_{N} = \\sqrt{N_{\\text{total}}}$. Since the concentration $C$ is a linear function of $N_{\\text{total}}$ ($C = k N_{\\text{total}}$ with $k = D/V_{\\text{counted}}$), the standard deviation of the concentration, $\\sigma_C$, can be found by propagating the uncertainty:\n$$ \\sigma_C = |k| \\sigma_N = \\frac{D}{V_{\\text{counted}}} \\sqrt{N_{\\text{total}}} $$\nA two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for the concentration, using the large-sample normal approximation, is given by:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = C \\pm z_{0.975} \\sigma_C $$\nwhere $z_{0.975}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a cumulative probability of $0.975$, which is approximately $1.96$.\n\nWe will apply this framework first to the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and then to the Red Blood Cell (RBC) count.\n\n**Analysis of White Blood Cell (WBC) Concentration**\n\nFirst, we aggregate the provided data for the WBC count.\nThe raw counts are $3, 2, 4, 3$ in chamber $1$ and $2, 3, 1, 3$ in chamber $2$.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and matched serum are collected under standardized conditions that minimize blood contamination.

Report your final index value as a dimensionless quantity and round your answer to three significant figures. Do not include units in your final reported value.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction and calculation of a dimensionless index to quantify relative intrathecal immunoglobulin G ($IgG$) synthesis using provided concentrations of $IgG$ and albumin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum.\n\nThe fundamental principle is to differentiate between proteins that enter the CSF from the blood via passive diffusion across the blood–CSF barrier and those that are synthesized locally within the central nervous system (intrathecally).\n\nAlbumin is a protein synthesized exclusively in the liver. Its presence in the CSF is solely due to transfer from the blood. Therefore, the ratio of its concentration in CSF to that in serum, known as the albumin quotient ($Q_{\\text{Alb}}$), serves as a quantitative measure of the blood–CSF barrier's permeability to macromolecules.\nThe albumin quotient is defined as:\n$$Q_{\\text{Alb}} = \\frac{[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{CSF}}}{[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{serum}}}$$\nwhere $[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{CSF}}$ is the concentration of albumin in CSF and $[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{serum}}$ is the concentration of albumin in serum.\n\nSimilarly, the quotient for immunoglobulin G ($IgG$) is defined as:\n$$Q_{\\text{IgG}} = \\frac{[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{CSF}}}{[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{serum}}}$$\nwhere $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{CSF}}$ and $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{serum}}$ are the respective concentrations in CSF and serum.\n\nHowever, unlike albumin, $IgG$ in the CSF can originate from two sources: passive diffusion from the blood and intrathecal synthesis. The $Q_{\\text{IgG}}$ value reflects the sum of both contributions. To isolate the component of intrathecal synthesis, we must normalize for the contribution from passive diffusion, which is dependent on the individual patient's barrier permeability. This normalization is achieved by comparing the $Q_{\\text{IgG}}$ to the $Q_{\\text{Alb}}$.\n\nThe appropriate dimensionless index for this purpose is the IgG Index. It is constructed as the ratio of the IgG quotient to the albumin quotient. This normalization effectively corrects for variations in barrier function. An index value significantly greater than the expected physiological ratio indicates that the amount of $IgG$ in the CSF is disproportionately high compared to albumin, implying an additional source of $IgG$ from within the CNS.\n\nThe IgG Index is formally defined as:\n$$IgG \\text{ Index} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{IgG}}}{Q_{\\text{Alb}}}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the quotients, we obtain the expression for calculation:\n$$IgG \\text{ Index} = \\frac{[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{CSF}} / [\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{serum}}}{[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{CSF}} / [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{serum}}}$$\nFor calculation, this expression can be conveniently rearranged:\n$$IgG \\text{ Index} = \\frac{[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{CSF}}}{[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{CSF}}} \\times \\frac{[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{serum}}}{[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{serum}}}$$\n\nWe are given the following measurements:\n- CSF albumin, $[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{CSF}} = 280\\,\\text{mg/L}$\n- Serum albumin, $[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{serum}} = 42\\,\\text{g/L}$\n- CSF IgG, $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{CSF}} = 34\\,\\text{mg/L}$\n- Serum IgG, $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{serum}} = 12\\,\\text{g/L}$\n\nTo ensure the index is dimensionless, the units for each substance's concentrations must be consistent between CSF and serum.

Interpretation of Findings and Determination of Infectious Category**\n\nThe second task is to use the provided laboratory values and their expected physiological context to determine the most likely infectious category.\n\nThe key findings are:\na. A significantly reduced CSF-to-plasma glucose ratio ($r_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.35$, compared to the expected $r_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 0.60$). This condition is termed hypoglycorrhachia.\nb. A markedly elevated CSF lactate concentration of $5.8$ mmol/L.\n\nThe physiological interpretation is as follows:\n- **Glucose Metabolism:** In a healthy state, CSF glucose is maintained at approximately $60\\%$ of the plasma glucose concentration via facilitated diffusion across the blood–brain barrier. The observed ratio of $0.35$ indicates a severe disruption of this balance. This disruption is caused by a substantial increase in glucose consumption within the central nervous system (CNS).\n- **Lactate Production:** CSF lactate is the end product of anaerobic glycolysis. The problem states that values above about $3.5$ mmol/L are strongly associated with bacterial meningitis. The patient's CSF lactate of $5.8$ mmol/L is well above this threshold, indicating significant anaerobic metabolism is occurring within the CNS.\n\nThese two findings are linked. Bacterial pathogens, along with the numerous neutrophils recruited to the CSF during the host's inflammatory response, are metabolically active. They consume glucose at a high rate. Since the CSF is a relatively enclosed environment with limited oxygen diffusion, this metabolism is largely anaerobic, leading to the dual findings of profound glucose depletion (low $r_{\\mathrm{obs}}$) and lactate accumulation (high CSF lactate).\n\nIn contrast, viral meningitis typically incites a lymphocytic inflammatory response, which is less metabolically demanding than a neutrophilic response. Furthermore, viruses themselves do not consume glucose. Consequently, in typical viral meningitis, CSF glucose is often near normal or only slightly decreased, and CSF lactate is usually within the normal range or only mildly elevated (typically remaining below the $3.5$ mmol/L threshold).\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of severe hypoglycorrhachia (a glucose ratio of $0.35$) and markedly elevated CSF lactate ($5.8$ mmol/L) is the classic biochemical signature of bacterial meningitis. The data strongly support this infectious category over viral meningitis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.250}$$", "id": "5203487"}]}
