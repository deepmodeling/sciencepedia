This test assesses red blood cell resilience by exposing them to a gradient of hypotonic stress, a process that necessitates a meticulously prepared series of saline solutions with decreasing concentrations.

Mastering this step ensures that the osmotic challenge presented to the cells is both accurate and consistent, which is paramount for valid results [@problem_id:5223672].", "problem": "A patient with suspected hemolytic anemia is evaluated using two complementary laboratory approaches: the osmotic fragility panel and an enzyme assay for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD). The osmotic fragility panel requires a graded series of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions decreasing from isotonic to hypotonic to characterize red blood cell (RBC) membrane stability.

Therefore, for a given species (hemoglobin), the term $\\epsilon l$ is a constant. Let us define this constant as $k = \\epsilon l$. The Beer–Lambert law simplifies to a direct proportionality between absorbance and concentration:\n$$A = k c$$\n\nThe absorbance measurement of any sample is a composite of the signal from the analyte of interest (hemoglobin) and any background signal from the cuvette, solvent, and other reagents. The reagent blank measurement, $A_{0}$, quantifies this background absorbance. To find the true absorbance due to hemoglobin alone, we must subtract the blank absorbance from the measured absorbance of the samples.\n\nThe corrected absorbance for the test tube supernatant is:\n$$A'_{\\mathrms} = A_{\\mathrms} - A_{0}$$\nThis corrected absorbance is proportional to the concentration of hemoglobin in the test supernatant, $c_{\\mathrms}$:\n$$A_{\\mathrms} - A_{0} = k c_{\\mathrms}$$\n\nThe corrected absorbance for the $100\\%$ lysis control is:\n$$A'_{100} = A_{100} - A_{0}$$\nThis corrected absorbance is proportional to the concentration of hemoglobin in the $100\\%$ lysis control supernatant, $c_{100}$. This concentration, $c_{100}$, represents the total amount of hemoglobin available from the initial erythrocyte suspension.\n$$A_{100} - A_{0} = k c_{100}$$\n\nFractional hemolysis, $f$, is defined as the ratio of the amount of hemoglobin released into the supernatant in the test sample to the total amount of hemoglobin present in the erythrocytes. Assuming the volume of the supernatant is the same for both the test sample and the control, this ratio of amounts is equivalent to the ratio of their respective concentrations.\n$$f = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of hemoglobin in test supernatant}}{\\text{Total hemoglobin concentration (from 100\\% lysis control)}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrms}}{c_{100}}$$\n\nWe can now express the concentrations $c_{\\mathrms}$ and $c_{100}$ in terms of the measured absorbances.\nFrom our earlier equations:\n$$c_{\\mathrms} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrms} - A_{0}}{k}$$\n$$c_{100} = \\frac{A_{100} - A_{0}}{k}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{A_{\\mathrms} - A_{0}}{k} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{A_{100} - A_{0}}{k} \\right)}$$\n\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for fractional hemolysis in terms of the absorbance values:\n$$f = \\frac{A_{\\mathrms} - A_{0}}{A_{100} - A_{0}}$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $f$ using the provided data:\n$A_{\\mathrms} = 0.362$\n$A_{100} = 1.210$\n$A_{0} = 0.014$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$f = \\frac{0.362 - 0.014}{1.210 - 0.014}$$\n$$f = \\frac{0.348}{1.196}$$\n$$f \\approx 0.29096989966...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$f \\approx 0.2910$$\nThe fractional hemolysis is $0.2910$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2910}$$", "id": "5223651"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of any diagnostic test is not just to generate data, but to interpret it in a clinical context.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe solution requires a systematic analysis of the provided osmotic fragility data in light of the patient's clinical history.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Osmotic Fragility Curve**:\n    A standard osmotic fragility curve for a healthy individual shows minimal hemolysis above a sodium chloride concentration of $0.50\\%$, with hemolysis proceeding in a single smooth, sigmoidal fashion until it is complete at approximately $0.30\\%$ NaCl. The provided data deviates significantly from this pattern. We can plot the change in hemolysis for each decrement in NaCl concentration to visualize the phases:\n    *   From $0.70\\%$ to $0.65\\%$: $\\Delta \\text{hemolysis} = 30\\%$. This is a very large increase, indicating a highly fragile population.\n    *   From $0.65\\%$ to $0.60\\%$: $\\Delta \\text{hemolysis} = 20\\%$. Still a significant increase.\n    *   At a concentration of $0.60\\%$ NaCl, total hemolysis has reached $58\\%$. Normal cells would show very little, if any, hemolysis at this concentration. This indicates that a large subpopulation of cells (approximately $58\\%-62\\%$ of the total) is osmotically fragile. Based on the provided principles, these are spherocytes.\n    *   From $0.60\\%$ to $0.45\\%$: The total hemolysis only increases from $58\\%$ to $66\\%$. This represents a plateau phase where the fragile population has mostly lysed, and the more resistant population has not yet begun to lyse significantly.\n    *   From $0.45\\%$ to $0.30\\%$: Hemolysis increases from $66\\%$ to $100\\%$. This second phase of lysis occurs in the concentration range expected for normal, or even slightly resistant, red blood cells. This represents the lysis of the remaining population of cells, which constitute approximately $100\\% - 64\\% \\approx 36\\%$ of the total (using the midpoint of the plateau).\n\n2.  **Synthesis with Clinical Information**:\n    *   We have identified two distinct RBC populations: a fragile population of spherocytes (comprising $\\approx 60\\%$ of total RBCs) and a normal-to-resistant population (comprising $\\approx 40\\%$ of total RBCs).\n    *   The patient has a history of chronic hemolysis (chronic jaundice, splenomegaly), which is the cause of the spherocyte population. Conditions like hereditary spherocytosis (HS) or warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) are prime candidates.\n    *   Critically, the patient was transfused $3$ days ago. A transfusion of packed RBCs introduces a large population of healthy, discocytic donor cells. These donor cells would have normal osmotic fragility.\n    *   The presence of a $ \\approx 40\\%$ population of cells with normal osmotic fragility is perfectly explained by the recent transfusion. The remaining $ \\approx 60\\%$ population of fragile cells represents the patient's own pathological spherocytes.\n\n3.  **Conclusion from First Principles**:\n    The only coherent explanation is that the patient has an underlying disorder causing spherocytosis (the fragile population) and has recently received a transfusion of normal red blood cells (the normal fragility population). The biphasic curve is the sum of the lysis of these two populations. The proportions seen on the curve ($\\approx 60\\%$ patient cells, $\\approx 40\\%$ donor cells) are consistent with a recent, significant blood transfusion.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **A. Recent transfusion into a patient with hereditary spherocytosis producing two RBC subpopulations (patient spherocytes that lyse at higher sodium chloride and donor normocytes that lyse at lower sodium chloride), with roughly $30$–$40\\%$ donor cells**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our derivation. Hereditary spherocytosis is a classic cause of chronic hemolysis, splenomegaly, and spherocytes, which are osmotically fragile. The recent transfusion explains the presence of the second, normal population of RBCs. The biphasic curve is the expected result of mixing these two populations. The quantitative estimate of $30\\%-40\\%$ donor cells is consistent with the data, where the second phase of lysis accounts for approximately $100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%$ of the cells.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Heterozygous beta-thalassemia trait without transfusion, producing globally decreased osmotic fragility and a single left-shifted curve**\n    This is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, it states \"without transfusion,\" which contradicts the problem statement. Second, beta-thalassemia causes the formation of target cells and other microcytic, hypochromic cells which have an increased surface-area-to-volume ratio. This leads to *decreased* osmotic fragility, which would manifest as a single, *left-shifted* curve (lysis at lower NaCl concentrations). The data shows a predominantly *right-shifted*, biphasic curve.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. Acute hemolytic episode in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency producing a biphasic osmotic fragility curve because oxidant-damaged cells lyse at higher sodium chloride while reticulocytes resist lysis**\n    This is a less plausible explanation. While a mixture of damaged cells and young reticulocytes in a G6PD crisis could theoretically produce a biphasic curve, this option ignores the most critical and explicit piece of information: the recent transfusion of a large volume of normal RBCs. The transfusion itself is the most direct and certain cause of a mixed cell population. Furthermore, the patient has *chronic* jaundice, whereas G6PD deficiency typically causes *acute*, episodic hemolysis.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Technical artifact from collection in sodium fluoride, creating uniform partial hemolysis across concentrations and a flat curve**\n    This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states the sample was collected in EDTA, not sodium fluoride. Moreover, a technical artifact causing uniform hemolysis would likely result in baseline hemolysis at isotonic concentrations (e.g., at $0.85\\%$ NaCl) and would not produce the distinct, two-phase sigmoidal curve observed in the data. The data shows $0\\%$ hemolysis at $0.80\\%$ NaCl, arguing against such an artifact. The curve is not flat.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia without transfusion, producing spherocytes intermixed with discocytes and therefore a distinctly biphasic osmotic fragility curve**\n    This is incorrect because it explicitly states \"without transfusion,\" directly contradicting the patient's history. While warm AIHA does cause spherocytosis and can produce a biphasic curve (patient's spherocytes vs. patient's remaining discocytes), the given history of transfusion provides a much more definitive explanation for a large ($\\approx 40\\%$) subpopulation of normal cells. Option A, which incorporates the transfusion, is a superior and more complete explanation of the facts provided.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5223632"}]}
