It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem describes a standard and fundamental calibration procedure in light microscopy, essential for quantitative morphometric analysis in fields like hematology. The provided data are physically realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to first derive a general expression for the calibration factor of an ocular micrometer and then to compute its specific value for a given microscope configuration.\n\nAn ocular micrometer is a glass disc with an arbitrary ruled scale, placed in one of the eyepieces at the plane of the intermediate image formed by the objective lens. Its scale has no intrinsic dimensional value until it is calibrated against a known standard. The standard used is a stage micrometer, which is a microscope slide with a precisely inscribed scale of known length (e.g., $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ divided into $100$ increments of $0.01\\ \\mathrm{mm}$).\n\nThe principle of calibration relies on superimposing the image of the stage micrometer onto the ocular micrometer scale. The objective lens magnifies the stage micrometer, projecting its image onto the same focal plane where the ocular micrometer resides. The eyepiece then magnifies both scales together for the observer. Since both scales are subjected to the same eyepiece magnification, the relative alignment between the ocular scale and the image of the stage scale is independent of the eyepiece. The calibration factor is therefore specific to the objective lens being used.\n\nLet $L_{stage}$ be a known length on the stage micrometer.\nLet $N_{ocular}$ be the number of divisions on the ocular micrometer that perfectly align with the length $L_{stage}$.\n\nThe calibration factor, which we will denote by $C$, is defined as the real length in the specimen plane that corresponds to a single division on the ocular micrometer. The total length measured on the stage is the product of the number of ocular divisions and this calibration factor.\n$$L_{stage} = N_{ocular} \\times C$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, we can derive the expression for the calibration factor $C$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$C = \\frac{L_{stage}}{N_{ocular}}$$\nThis expression directly maps an ocular micrometer measurement (in divisions) to a physical length (in units such as micrometers). The units of $C$ will be length per division (e.g., $\\mathrm{\\mu m/div}$).\n\nNow, we will apply this derived formula to the specific data provided in the problem.\n\nThe given alignment data are:\n1. The number of ocular divisions measured, $N_{ocular}$, is from the zero line to the $125$th division, so $N_{ocular} = 125\\ \\mathrm{div}$.\n2. The corresponding length on the stage micrometer, $L_{stage}$, is from the $0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ mark to the $0.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ mark. Thus, $L_{stage} = 0.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe final answer is required in units of micrometers per division ($\\mathrm{\\mu m/div}$). Therefore, we must convert the length $L_{stage}$ from millimeters to micrometers. The conversion factor is $1\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n$$L_{stage} = 0.11\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 110\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values for $L_{stage}$ and $N_{ocular}$ into our derived expression for the calibration factor $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{110\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{125\\ \\mathrm{div}}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$C = 0.88\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/div}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value of the calculation is $0.88$. To express this numerical value with four significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros.\n$$C = 0.8800\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/div}$$\nThis is the calibrated scale factor for the $100\\times$ oil immersion objective. For any subsequent measurement of a cell on a slide using this microscope setup, the length of the cell in ocular divisions would be multiplied by this factor to obtain its actual size in micrometers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8800}$$", "id": "5233078"}, {"introduction": "With a calibrated microscope, we can translate visual observations into meaningful data.
