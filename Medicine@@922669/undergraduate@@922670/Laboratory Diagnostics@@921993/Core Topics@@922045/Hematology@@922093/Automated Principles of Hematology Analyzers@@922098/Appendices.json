A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution begins from the first principle that the uncorrected count measured by the analyzer is an aggregate of all particles that meet the size criteria for leukocytes in the impedance channel. In this case, these particles are the true white blood cells (WBCs) and the misclassified nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs).\n\nLet $WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}}$ be the uncorrected particle concentration reported by the analyzer.\nLet $WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$ be the true concentration of white blood cells.\nLet $C_{\\text{NRBC}}$ be the concentration of nucleated red blood cells.\n\nThe total measured concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the constituent particles:\n$$WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}} = WBC_{\\text{corrected}} + C_{\\text{NRBC}}$$\n\nThe problem provides a ratio from a manual blood smear review: \"$25$ NRBC per $100$ WBC\". This ratio, established by a method that correctly differentiates the cell types, relates the quantity of NRBCs to the quantity of *true* WBCs. Let us define this ratio as $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Number of NRBCs}}{\\text{Number of true WBCs}} = \\frac{25}{100}$$\nSince concentration ($C$) is defined as the number of particles ($N$) per unit volume ($V$), the ratio of concentrations of two particle types in the same sample is equal to the ratio of their numbers:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{NRBC}}}{WBC_{\\text{corrected}}} = R$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of NRBCs as a function of the true WBC concentration:\n$$C_{\\text{NRBC}} = R \\times WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{\\text{NRBC}}$ into the primary equation for the uncorrected count:\n$$WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}} = WBC_{\\text{corrected}} + (R \\times WBC_{\\text{corrected}})$$\nTo derive the required expression, we factor out $WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}} = WBC_{\\text{corrected}} \\times (1 + R)$$\nSolving for $WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$ gives the general formula for the correction:\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = \\frac{WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}}}{1 + R}$$\nThis is the derived expression. The ratio $R$ as used in this formula is specifically the number of NRBCs per *one* WBC, which corresponds to the value $\\frac{25}{100}$ from the problem statement.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$WBC_{\\text{uncorrected}} = 18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$\n$R = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = \\frac{18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{18.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}}{1.25}$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = 14.4 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$$\nThe problem asks for the final numerical value to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $14.4$ already has three significant figures. The final answer should be the numerical coefficient of $10^{9}/\\text{L}$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative question on reporting the absolute NRBC concentration:\nIn a modern laboratory workflow, it is best practice to report the NRBC concentration as an absolute count (e.g., number of cells per liter, such as $N \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$), rather than as a ratio per $100$ WBCs. This absolute value provides direct, clinically actionable information. This concentration, $C_{\\text{NRBC}}$, is calculated based on the manually determined ratio ($R$) and the *corrected* WBC count ($WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$). The quantity is calculated using the relationship derived previously: $C_{\\text{NRBC}} = R \\times WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$. Many advanced hematology analyzers automate this process by including a dedicated channel (e.g., using fluorescence flow cytometry) that directly measures the absolute NRBC concentration, thereby providing a more accurate result and automatically reporting the corrected WBC count. Irrespective of the method, reporting an absolute concentration is the standard of care.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.4}$$", "id": "5208886"}, {"introduction": "Modern hematology analyzers have evolved far beyond simple counting, employing sophisticated techniques to classify cells into subpopulations, such as the white blood cell differential. This is achieved by measuring multiple physical properties of each cell simultaneously, creating a unique multi-dimensional signature. This advanced exercise [@problem_id:5208849] introduces you to the powerful statistical method of Mahalanobis distance, which analyzers use to classify a cell based on its Volume, Conductivity, and Scatter (VCS) properties, demonstrating how data science is integral to modern hematology.", "problem": "A three-dimensional cell feature vector from a White Blood Cell (WBC) differential measured on a Volume–Conductivity–Scatter (VCS) analyzer is recorded as $x = (\\text{Volume}, \\text{Conductivity}, \\text{Scatter}) = (85 \\text{ fL}, 34 \\text{ a.u.}, 230 \\text{ a.u.})$. The analyzer provides class centroids for three WBC populations based on a large, previously curated training set: lymphocytes with $\\mu_{\\text{L}} = (90 \\text{ fL}, 32 \\text{ a.u.}, 180 \\text{ a.u.})$, monocytes with $\\mu_{\\text{M}} = (170 \\text{ fL}, 40 \\text{ a.u.}, 190 \\text{ a.u.})$, and neutrophils with $\\mu_{\\text{N}} = (150 \\text{ fL}, 38 \\text{ a.u.}, 260 \\text{ a.u.})$. In routine automated classification, features within each class are modeled as being drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with a common covariance across classes due to consistent instrument noise and shared acquisition physics of impedance (volume), radiofrequency conductivity (internal composition), and light scatter (granularity). The pooled covariance matrix estimated from the training data is\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n100 & 5 & 120 \\\\\n5 & 9 & 15 \\\\\n120 & 15 & 400\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere the units are consistent with the corresponding feature pairs.

The Mahalanobis distances are dimensionless; do not include units in the final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of automated hematology and statistical pattern recognition, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated in objective, formal language. The covariance matrix is invertible, ensuring a unique solution exists.\n\nThe problem asks for two primary tasks: first, to explain the rationale behind using a common pooled covariance matrix for cell classification, and second, to compute the squared Mahalanobis distances for a given cell feature vector to three class centroids and classify the cell.\n\n### Part 1: Rationale for a Common Covariance Matrix\n\nThe use of a common (pooled) covariance matrix, $\\Sigma$, across all classes (lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil) is a foundational assumption of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a widely used classification method. The justification stems from both the statistical model and the physical principles of the measurement instrument.\n\n**1. Statistical Modeling Principle:**\nThe decision rule in this context is derived from Bayes' theorem. To classify a feature vector $x$, one assigns it to the class $C_k$ that maximizes the posterior probability $P(C_k|x)$. Assuming equal prior probabilities for the classes, this is equivalent to maximizing the class-conditional probability density $p(x|C_k)$. The model assumes that for each class $k$, the feature vectors are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\\mu_k$ and covariance $\\Sigma_k$:\n$$ p(x|C_k) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{d/2} |\\Sigma_k|^{1/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\mu_k)^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} (x-\\mu_k)\\right) $$\nwhere $d$ is the number of features. The term in the exponent is one-half the squared Mahalanobis distance. If we make the simplifying assumption that all classes share a common covariance matrix, i.e., $\\Sigma_k = \\Sigma$ for all $k$, the decision boundary between any two classes becomes a linear function of $x$. This reduces the complexity of the classifier and makes the estimation of the covariance more robust, as it is \"pooled\" from a larger dataset comprising all classes. Without this assumption, the model becomes Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), which has quadratic decision boundaries and requires estimating a separate covariance matrix for each class, demanding more data.\n\n**2. Instrument Physics Principle:**\nThe problem states that the features Volume ($V$), Conductivity ($C$), and Scatter ($S$) are measured by a VCS analyzer. The covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ quantifies the variance of each feature and the covariance between pairs of features.\n- $\\sigma_{VV}$: Variance in Volume measurement.\n- $\\sigma_{CC}$: Variance in Conductivity measurement.\n- $\\sigma_{SS}$: Variance in Scatter measurement.\n- $\\sigma_{VC}$, $\\sigma_{VS}$, $\\sigma_{CS}$: Covariances between the feature pairs.\n\nThe total variability in measurements arises from two sources: intrinsic biological variation within a cell population and measurement error/noise from the instrument. The assumption of a common covariance matrix implies that the variability structure introduced by the measurement process is dominant and consistent for all cell types.\n- **Volume (Impedance):** All cells pass through the same physical aperture and are subject to the same electronic noise in the impedance-sensing circuitry.\n- **Conductivity (Radiofrequency):** All cells are interrogated by the same RF field, and the signals are processed by the same electronics, leading to consistent noise characteristics.\n- **Scatter (Laser Optics):** All cells are illuminated by the same laser beam, and the scattered light is detected by the same photodetectors, which have a consistent noise profile.\n\nSince the physical measurement system and its associated sources of random error are identical for every cell analyzed, it is a reasonable approximation to model this contribution to the covariance as being the same for all cell classes. Pooling the data to compute one common $\\Sigma$ provides a more stable and reliable estimate of this shared noise and variability structure.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Squared Mahalanobis Distances\n\nThe squared Mahalanobis distance from a feature vector $x$ to a class centroid $\\mu$, given a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$, is defined as:\n$$ D_M^2(x, \\mu) = (x - \\mu)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu) $$\nClassification is performed by assigning $x$ to the class $C_k$ for which $D_M^2(x, \\mu_k)$ is minimized.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Feature vector: $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 85 \\\\ 34 \\\\ 230 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Class centroids:\n  $\\mu_{\\text{L}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 90 \\\\ 32 \\\\ 180 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Lymphocyte),\n  $\\mu_{\\text{M}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 170 \\\\ 40 \\\\ 190 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Monocyte),\n  $\\mu_{\\text{N}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 150 \\\\ 38 \\\\ 260 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Neutrophil)\n- Covariance matrix:\n$$ \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 100 & 5 & 120 \\\\ 5 & 9 & 15 \\\\ 120 & 15 & 400 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Step 1: Compute the inverse of the covariance matrix, $\\Sigma^{-1}$.**\nFirst, we find the determinant of $\\Sigma$:\n$$ \\det(\\Sigma) = 100(9 \\cdot 400 - 15^2) - 5(5 \\cdot 400 - 15 \\cdot 120) + 120(5 \\cdot 15 - 9 \\cdot 120) $$\n$$ \\det(\\Sigma) = 100(3600 - 225) - 5(2000 - 1800) + 120(75 - 1080) $$\n$$ \\det(\\Sigma) = 100(3375) - 5(200) + 120(-1005) = 337500 - 1000 - 120600 = 215900 $$\nThe inverse is $\\Sigma^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\Sigma)} \\text{adj}(\\Sigma)$.
