It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe objective is to compute the dimensionless ratio of the surface area-to-volume ratio of an RBC to that of a sphere with the same volume.\n\nFirst, we calculate the surface area-to-volume ratio for the Red Blood Cell, denoted as $(S/V)_{\\text{RBC}}$.\nThe givens are the surface area $S_{\\text{RBC}} = 140\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and the volume $V_{\\text{RBC}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL}$.\nUsing the provided unit equivalence, $1\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, the volume can be expressed as $V_{\\text{RBC}} = 90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{S}{V}\\right)_{\\text{RBC}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{RBC}}}{V_{\\text{RBC}}} = \\frac{140\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = \\frac{14}{9}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area-to-volume ratio for a sphere with the same volume, denoted as $(S/V)_{\\text{sphere}}$.\nThe volume of this sphere is $V_{\\text{sphere}} = V_{\\text{RBC}} = 90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.

A sphere encloses a given volume with the minimum possible surface area. The ratio $R \\approx 1.44$ quantifies that the RBC possesses approximately $44\\%$ more surface area than a sphere of the same volume. This \"excess\" surface area is crucial for the cell's function. It allows the RBC to deform substantially, for example, by folding or bending, as it squeezes through narrow capillaries whose diameters can be smaller than the resting diameter of the cell. This deformation occurs without stretching the cell membrane, which would be energetically costly and increase the risk of lysis (rupture). A sphere, being already taut with minimal surface area for its volume, is rigid and cannot deform without membrane stretching. Thus, the high surface area-to-volume ratio, captured by this computed dimensionless value, is a key structural determinant of RBC deformability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.44}\n$$", "id": "5238338"}, {"introduction": "A red blood cell is more than just a passive container; its internal environment actively regulates how tightly hemoglobin binds to oxygen, ensuring efficient delivery to tissues.
