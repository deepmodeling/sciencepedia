It is based on established principles of laboratory hematology for monitoring vitamin K antagonist therapy. The Prothrombin Time ($PT$), International Sensitivity Index ($ISI$), and International Normalized Ratio ($INR$) are standard, well-defined parameters in clinical practice. The values provided ($PT$ and $ISI$) are realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to compute the $INR$.

It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or factual errors. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe International Normalized Ratio ($INR$) is a standardized measure used to report the results of prothrombin time blood tests. The problem states that the $INR$ is conceptually \"the standardized ratio of the patient-to-control PT adjusted for this sensitivity\". This translates into the formal mathematical equation used in clinical laboratories:\n$$INR = \\left( \\frac{PT_{patient}}{PT_{control}} \\right)^{ISI}$$\nwhere $PT_{patient}$ is the measured prothrombin time for the patient, $PT_{control}$ is the mean normal prothrombin time for the laboratory, and $ISI$ is the International Sensitivity Index of the thromboplastin reagent used.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $PT_{patient} = 18\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $PT_{control} = 12\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $ISI = 1.0$\n\nFirst, we calculate the prothrombin time ratio ($PTR$):\n$$PTR = \\frac{PT_{patient}}{PT_{control}} = \\frac{18\\,\\mathrm{s}}{12\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 1.5$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we substitute the $PTR$ and the $ISI$ into the $INR$ formula:\n$$INR = (PTR)^{ISI} = (1.5)^{1.0}$$\nAny number raised to the power of $1$ is the number itself.\n$$INR = 1.5$$\nThe problem requires the final $INR$ to be expressed to three significant figures. Therefore, we write the result as $1.50$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to classify the anticoagulant intensity. The provided therapeutic range for most indications of vitamin K antagonist therapy is an $INR$ from $2.0$ to $3.0$.\n- An $INR$ below $2.0$ is considered **subtherapeutic**, indicating insufficient anticoagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis.\n- An $INR$ between $2.0$ and $3.0$ is considered **therapeutic**, indicating the desired level of anticoagulation.\n- An $INR$ above $3.0$ is considered **supratherapeutic**, indicating excessive anticoagulation and an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nOur calculated $INR$ is $1.50$. Comparing this value to the therapeutic range:\n$$1.50  2.0$$\nThe patient's $INR$ falls below the lower limit of the therapeutic range.

In secondary hemostasis, the aPTT reflects the integrity of the intrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of laboratory hematology and coagulation testing, specifically the interpretation of mixing studies for prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary quantitative data and a clear definition of the desired calculation. The terminology is standard and objective.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the Rosner index for the incubated $1:1$ mix. The Rosner index, also known as the index of circulating anticoagulant (ICA), is defined in the problem as a comparison of \"the residual prolongation in the mix to the initial prolongation in the patient relative to the NPP baseline.\" This can be formalized into a mathematical ratio.\n\nLet the relevant aPTT measurements be denoted as follows:\n- $T_P$: Patient baseline aPTT, given as $82.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- $T_N$: Normal Pooled Plasma (NPP) aPTT, given as $28.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- $T_{M, \\text{imm}}$: Immediate $1:1$ mix aPTT, given as $33.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- $T_{M, \\text{inc}}$: Incubated $1:1$ mix aPTT, given as $74.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe \"initial prolongation in the patient relative to the NPP baseline\" is the difference between the patient's aPTT and the normal control's aPTT. This serves as the denominator of the index:\n$$ \\text{Initial Prolongation} = T_P - T_N $$\n\nThe \"residual prolongation in the mix\" is the difference between the mixture's aPTT and the normal control's aPTT. This serves as the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Residual Prolongation} = T_{\\text{mix}} - T_N $$\n\nCombining these, the Rosner index, $I_R$, is given by the formula:\n$$ I_R = \\frac{T_{\\text{mix}} - T_N}{T_P - T_N} $$\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the index for the *incubated* mix. Therefore, we must use $T_{M, \\text{inc}}$ for $T_{\\text{mix}}$. Let us denote this specific index as $I_{R, \\text{inc}}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ I_{R, \\text{inc}} = \\frac{T_{M, \\text{inc}} - T_N}{T_P - T_N} = \\frac{74.0\\,\\mathrm{s} - 28.0\\,\\mathrm{s}}{82.0\\,\\mathrm{s} - 28.0\\,\\mathrm{s}} $$\n\nPerforming the subtractions in the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ I_{R, \\text{inc}} = \\frac{46.0\\,\\mathrm{s}}{54.0\\,\\mathrm{s}} $$\n\nThe units of seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$) cancel, rendering the index a dimensionless quantity. The fraction simplifies to:\n$$ I_{R, \\text{inc}} = \\frac{46}{54} = \\frac{23}{27} $$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$ I_{R, \\text{inc}} = 23 \\div 27 \\approx 0.85185185... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $5$, $1$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth figure.\n$$ I_{R, \\text{inc}} \\approx 0.8519 $$\n\nAs part of the reasoning, we must interpret this result. A mixing study distinguishes between a factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor.\n$1$. The immediate mix aPTT ($T_{M, \\text{imm}} = 33.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$) shows significant \"correction\" towards the NPP value ($T_N = 28.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$). A Rosner index for the immediate mix would be $I_{R, \\text{imm}} = (33.0 - 28.0) / (82.0 - 28.0) = 5.0/54.0 \\approx 0.0926$. This low value (typically $0.15$) indicates that the patient's plasma is not immediately inhibitory to the factors in the NPP. This initial pattern is consistent with either a factor deficiency or a time- and temperature-dependent inhibitor. It is not consistent with a typical lupus anticoagulant, which acts immediately and would fail to correct.\n$2$. The incubated mix aPTT ($T_{M, \\text{inc}} = 74.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$) shows a dramatic loss of this correction, with the time returning nearly to the original patient value ($T_P = 82.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Our calculated Rosner index of approximately $0.8519$ confirms quantitatively that about $85\\%$ of the original prolongation has re-emerged after incubation.\n$3$. This classic pattern of initial correction followed by time-dependent loss of correction at 37°C is the hallmark of a specific factor inhibitor, such as an antibody against Factor VIII. The inhibitor in the patient's plasma requires time and physiological temperature to neutralize the corresponding coagulation factor supplied by the NPP. A simple factor deficiency would have remained corrected upon incubation. Therefore, the results are most consistent with a specific factor inhibitor.\n\nThe final answer required is only the numerical value of the Rosner index for the incubated mix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8519}$$", "id": "5237027"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific factor deficiency, such as Hemophilia A, is diagnosed, the focus shifts to treatment with factor replacement therapy.
