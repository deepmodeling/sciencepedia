A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the final concentration of the citrate anticoagulant in the plasma phase must remain constant, regardless of the patient's hematocrit. Since the initial concentration of the citrate solution is fixed, this is equivalent to maintaining a constant ratio of the anticoagulant volume, $V_c$, to the plasma volume, $V_p$.\n$$ \\frac{V_c}{V_p} = \\text{constant} $$\nWe first determine the value of this constant from the reference conditions.\n\nUnder reference conditions, the hematocrit is $Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 40$. The problem states that the standard ratio of anticoagulant to whole blood is $1:9$. Let $V_{c, \\mathrm{ref}}$ and $V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}}$ denote the volumes of anticoagulant and whole blood, respectively, in the reference case.\n$$ \\frac{V_{c, \\mathrm{ref}}}{V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nThe volume of plasma in the reference case, $V_{p, \\mathrm{ref}}$, is given by the plasma fraction of the whole blood volume:\n$$ V_{p, \\mathrm{ref}} = V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}} \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right) $$\nThe constant ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{V_c}{V_p}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V_{c, \\mathrm{ref}}}{V_{p, \\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{V_{c, \\mathrm{ref}}}{V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}} \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right)} $$\nSubstituting the $1:9$ ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{V_c}{V_p}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{9} V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}}}{V_{b, \\mathrm{ref}} \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{9 \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right)} $$\nNow, we apply this constant ratio to the patient's sample. For a patient with hematocrit $Hct$ from whom a volume of whole blood $V_b$ is drawn, the plasma volume is:\n$$ V_p = V_b \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct}{100}\\right) $$\nThe corrected volume of citrate, $V_c$, must satisfy the condition:\n$$ \\frac{V_c}{V_p} = \\left(\\frac{V_c}{V_p}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the ratios and plasma volumes:\n$$ \\frac{V_c}{V_b \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct}{100}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{9 \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right)} $$\nSolving for $V_c$ yields the general expression for the corrected citrate volume:\n$$ V_c = V_b \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\frac{Hct}{100}}{9 \\left(1 - \\frac{Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{100}\\right)} $$\nThis can be written more conveniently as:\n$$ V_c = \\frac{V_b (100 - Hct)}{9 (100 - Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}})} $$\nThis is the general expression for the corrected citrate volume $V_c$ as a function of the patient's hematocrit $Hct$ and the whole blood volume $V_b$.\n\nNext, we compute the specific value of $V_c$ for the given case. The problem provides:\n- Whole blood volume, $V_b = 2.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Patient's hematocrit, $Hct = 65$\n- Reference hematocrit, $Hct_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 40$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ V_c = \\frac{2.7 \\cdot (100 - 65)}{9 \\cdot (100 - 40)} $$\n$$ V_c = \\frac{2.7 \\cdot 35}{9 \\cdot 60} $$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ V_c = \\frac{94.5}{540} $$\nTo simplify, we can also compute it as:\n$$ V_c = \\left(\\frac{2.7}{9}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{35}{60}\\right) = 0.3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{7 \\cdot 5}{12 \\cdot 5}\\right) = 0.3 \\cdot \\frac{7}{12} $$\n$$ V_c = \\frac{2.1}{12} = \\frac{0.7}{4} = 0.175 $$\nThe corrected citrate volume is $V_c = 0.175\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
