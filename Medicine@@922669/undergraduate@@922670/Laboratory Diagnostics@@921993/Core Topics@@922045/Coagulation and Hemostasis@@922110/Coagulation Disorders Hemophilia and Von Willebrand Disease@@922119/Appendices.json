Let $V_{\\mathrm{wb}}$ be the volume of whole blood, $V_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ be the volume of plasma, and $V_{\\mathrm{rbc}}$ be the volume of erythrocytes. The total volume of whole blood is the sum of the plasma and erythrocyte volumes:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{wb}} = V_{\\mathrm{pl}} + V_{\\mathrm{rbc}}$$\nHematocrit, $H$, is defined as the volume fraction of erythrocytes in whole blood:\n$$H = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rbc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{wb}}}$$\nFrom these two relations, we can express the volume of plasma as a function of the whole blood volume and the hematocrit:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pl}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb}} - V_{\\mathrm{rbc}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb}} - H \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{wb}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb}}(1 - H)$$\nThe problem states that the efficacy of the citrate anticoagulant depends on the ratio of the citrate volume, $V_{\\mathrm{cit}}$, to the plasma volume, $V_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. Let this critical ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit}}}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}$$\nThe standard collection tube is optimized for a reference hematocrit, $H_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.42$. The standard tube contains a citrate volume, which we denote as $V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, and is designed to be filled with a whole blood volume of $V_{\\mathrm{wb,ref}} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\nThe plasma volume under these reference conditions is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pl,ref}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb,ref}}(1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = (4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL})(1 - 0.42) = (4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL})(0.58)$$\nThe optimal reference ratio, $R_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}}}{V_{\\mathrm{pl,ref}}} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{(4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL})(0.58)}$$\nNow, we consider the patient's sample, which has a high hematocrit of $H_{\\mathrm{pt}} = 0.65$. The tube is filled with the same volume of whole blood, $V_{\\mathrm{wb,pt}} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The plasma volume in the patient's sample is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pl,pt}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb,pt}}(1 - H_{\\mathrm{pt}}) = (4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL})(1 - 0.65) = (4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL})(0.35)$$\nTo ensure a valid test result, the citrate-to-plasma ratio in the patient's sample must be adjusted to match the reference ratio. Let the required adjusted volume of citrate be $V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}}$. The condition is $R_{\\mathrm{pt}} = R_{\\mathrm{ref}}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}}}{V_{\\mathrm{pl,pt}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}}}{V_{\\mathrm{pl,ref}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the plasma volumes:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}}}{V_{\\mathrm{wb,pt}}(1 - H_{\\mathrm{pt}})} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}}}{V_{\\mathrm{wb,ref}}(1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}})}$$\nGiven that $V_{\\mathrm{wb,pt}} = V_{\\mathrm{wb,ref}} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, these terms cancel, and we can solve for $V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}} = V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}} \\frac{1 - H_{\\mathrm{pt}}}{1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}} = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}) \\frac{1 - 0.65}{1 - 0.42} = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}) \\frac{0.35}{0.58} \\approx 0.301724\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem asks for the volume of citrate that must be removed from the standard tube. This is the difference between the initial citrate volume and the adjusted volume:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{removed}} = V_{\\mathrm{cit,ref}} - V_{\\mathrm{cit,adj}}$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{removed}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL} - 0.301724\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\approx 0.198276\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.1983\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nSeparately, we explain the qualitative consequences of failing to make this adjustment.\nA high hematocrit ($H = 0.65$) means that for a given volume of whole blood, the plasma fraction is significantly reduced. If a standard tube containing $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of citrate is filled with $4.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of this patient's blood, the fixed volume of anticoagulant will be mixed with a smaller-than-intended volume of plasma. This results in an \"over-citrated\" sample, where the concentration of citrate in the plasma is excessively high.\n\nThe anticoagulant action of trisodium citrate is to chelate calcium ions ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), which are essential cofactors for the activation and function of several coagulation factors (e.g., Factors II, VII, IX, and X). The aPTT test measures the clotting time of plasma after the addition of an activator and a standardized amount of calcium chloride ($\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$). The added calcium is meant to reverse the anticoagulant effect and initiate the coagulation cascade.\n\nIn an over-citrated sample, a significant portion of the added reagent calcium is consumed by binding to the excess citrate. This reduces the concentration of free $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ available to participate in the coagulation reactions. Since the enzymatic steps of the clotting cascade are dependent on calcium concentration, the overall process is slowed down. This leads to a longer time to form a fibrin clot, resulting in a **falsely prolonged** or **artificially elevated** aPTT value.\n\n**Interpretive Consequences for Hemophilia and von Willebrand Disease (vWD):**\nA prolonged aPTT is a key indicator of Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency). An artifactually prolonged aPTT from an uncorrected high-hematocrit sample can lead to a false-positive screening result, suggesting hemophilia in a patient who does not have it, or it can overestimate the severity of a known hemophiliac's condition. This can lead to incorrect diagnoses and inappropriate treatment decisions.\n\nIn von Willebrand Disease, the aPTT may be normal or prolonged depending on the type and severity, particularly on the extent of a secondary Factor VIII deficiency. A falsely prolonged aPTT can confound the diagnostic picture, incorrectly suggesting a more severe form of vWD or a co-existing hemophilia. This pre-analytical error compromises the integrity of the test result, making it an unreliable reflection of the patient's true hemostatic function and complicating the diagnostic evaluation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1983}\n$$", "id": "5217319"}, {"introduction": "Once a valid sample is obtained, a prolonged activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is a frequent finding that requires further investigation.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: a calculation of the final FVIII activity and an interpretation of the expected aPTT result.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of FVIII Activity in the Mixture**\n\nLet $V_P$ be the volume of the patient's plasma and $V_N$ be the volume of the pooled normal plasma. The total volume of the mixture is $V_T = V_P + V_N$.\nThe problem states a mixture of one part patient's plasma to four parts normal plasma. We can set $V_P = 1$ arbitrary unit of volume and $V_N = 4$ arbitrary units of volume.\nTherefore, the total volume corresponds to $V_T = 1 + 4 = 5$ parts.\n\nThe volume fraction of the patient's plasma, $f_P$, in the mixture is:\n$$f_P = \\frac{V_P}{V_T} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nThe volume fraction of the normal plasma, $f_N$, in the mixture is:\n$$f_N = \\frac{V_N}{V_T} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\n\nThe FVIII activity of the patient's plasma is given as $A_P = 0.03$.\nThe FVIII activity of the pooled normal plasma is given as $A_N = 1.00$.\n\nThe problem states that the FVIII activity of the mixture, $A_M$, is a linear, volume-weighted property of the components. This can be expressed as a weighted average:\n$$A_M = f_P \\cdot A_P + f_N \\cdot A_N$$\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n$$A_M = (0.2) \\cdot (0.03) + (0.8) \\cdot (1.00)$$\n$$A_M = 0.006 + 0.800$$\n$$A_M = 0.806$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.806$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we append a zero.\n$$A_M = 0.8060$$\nThis corresponds to an FVIII activity of $80.60\\%$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of aPTT Correction**\n\nThe activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is a screening test that measures the integrity of the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. Factor VIII is a critical component of the intrinsic pathway.\nThe patient's baseline FVIII activity is $3\\%$ ($0.03$ of normal), which is significantly below the normal range (typically $50\\%$ to $150\\%$, or $0.50$ to $1.50$). This severe deficiency would cause a prolongation of the aPTT.\n\nA mixing study is performed to differentiate a factor deficiency from the presence of a circulating inhibitor.\n- If the prolonged aPTT is due to a simple factor deficiency (like Hemophilia A), adding normal plasma (which contains all coagulation factors at normal levels) will replenish the deficient factor. This should \"correct\" the aPTT, meaning the clotting time of the mixture will return to the normal range.\n- If the prolonged aPTT is due to a circulating inhibitor, the inhibitor in the patient's plasma will also inhibit the factors present in the added normal plasma, and the aPTT will fail to correct.\n\nOur calculation shows that the FVIII activity in the $1:4$ mixture, $A_M$, is $0.8060$, or $80.6\\%$. This level is well within the normal range for FVIII activity. Since the FVIII level is successfully restored to a hemostatically sufficient level, the function of the intrinsic pathway is restored in the mixed sample. Consequently, the aPTT test performed on this mixture would be expected to yield a result within the normal reference interval. This phenomenon is referred to as \"correction.\"\nTherefore, based on the provided principle, the aPTT is expected to correct toward the normal range, a classic finding for a factor deficiency.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value for the FVIII activity of the mixture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8060}$$", "id": "5217275"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic mixing study, this problem delves into a more complex diagnostic scenario.

An aPTT mixing study is a standard laboratory procedure to investigate the cause of a prolonged aPTT, differentiating between a coagulation factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor. The provided aPTT values are clinically plausible for such a scenario. The Rosner index is a recognized (though not universally adopted) quantitative measure for mixing study results. The principles for interpretation (correction versus non-correction, effect of incubation) are fundamental to diagnostic hematology. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data for the calculations and interpretation are provided, and the requested outputs are clearly defined. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe may now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary purpose of a mixing study is to distinguish between a factor deficiency and an inhibitor. In a $1{:}1$ mixture with normal pooled plasma, a factor deficiency is 'corrected' because the normal plasma provides a sufficient concentration of the missing factor (typically achieving $\\approx 50\\%$ activity, which is adequate for normalizing the aPTT). Conversely, if an inhibitor is present, it will also act on the factors in the added normal plasma, and the aPTT will fail to correct or will only partially correct.\n\nThe Rosner index (RI), also known as the index of circulating anticoagulant (ICA), quantifies the degree of correction. It is calculated using the formula:\n$$\nRI = \\frac{aPTT_{mix} - aPTT_N}{aPTT_P}\n$$\nwhere $aPTT_{mix}$ is the aPTT of the $1{:}1$ mix, $aPTT_N$ is the aPTT of the normal control plasma, and $aPTT_P$ is the patient's baseline aPTT. A low index (typically $0.15$) suggests correction and is consistent with a factor deficiency, while a high index (typically $>0.15$) suggests the presence of an inhibitor. The problem asks for the index as a decimal fraction.\n\nWe will calculate the Rosner index for both the immediate and the incubated mixtures.\n\n**1. Immediate Rosner Index ($RI_{imm}$)**\nUsing the provided values for the immediate mixture:\n- $aPTT_P = 72\\,\\text{s}$\n- $aPTT_N = 30\\,\\text{s}$\n- $aPTT_{mix,imm} = 38\\,\\text{s}$\n\nThe immediate Rosner index is:\n$$\nRI_{imm} = \\frac{aPTT_{mix,imm} - aPTT_N}{aPTT_P} = \\frac{38 - 30}{72} = \\frac{8}{72} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$\nRI_{imm} \\approx 0.1111... \\approx 0.111\n$$\n\n**2. Incubated Rosner Index ($RI_{inc}$)**\nNext, we calculate the index for the mixture after a $2$-hour incubation at $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. This step is crucial for identifying time- and temperature-dependent inhibitors, such as those targeting Factor VIII.\nUsing the provided values for the incubated mixture:\n- $aPTT_P = 72\\,\\text{s}$\n- $aPTT_N = 30\\,\\text{s}$\n- $aPTT_{mix,inc} = 60\\,\\text{s}$\n\nThe incubated Rosner index is:\n$$\nRI_{inc} = \\frac{aPTT_{mix,inc} - aPTT_N}{aPTT_P} = \\frac{60 - 30}{72} = \\frac{30}{72}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\nRI_{inc} = \\frac{5 \\times 6}{12 \\times 6} = \\frac{5}{12}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$\nRI_{inc} \\approx 0.4166... \\approx 0.417\n$$\n\n**3. Diagnostic Interpretation**\nThe pattern of results must be interpreted.\n- The immediate mix shows significant correction: the aPTT shortens from $72\\,\\text{s}$ to $38\\,\\text{s}$, which is close to the normal control of $30\\,\\text{s}$. The low immediate Rosner index of $0.111$ supports this interpretation of correction.\n- After incubation, the aPTT of the mix prolongs substantially from $38\\,\\text{s}$ to $60\\,\\text{s}$. This demonstrates a loss of the initial correction over time. The incubated Rosner index of $0.417$ is high, indicating a strong inhibitory effect after incubation.\n\nThis specific pattern—initial correction followed by subsequent prolongation upon incubation—is the classic signature of a time- and temperature-dependent inhibitor. A simple factor deficiency would show sustained correction in both the immediate and incubated samples. An immediate-acting inhibitor would show a lack of correction in both samples. Therefore, the findings are consistent with an inhibitor.\n\nAccording to the problem's encoding scheme, 'deficiency' is coded as $0$ and 'inhibitor' is coded as $1$. The correct interpretation code is $1$.\n\n**Final Result Assembly**\nThe final result is a row matrix containing, in order:\n1.
