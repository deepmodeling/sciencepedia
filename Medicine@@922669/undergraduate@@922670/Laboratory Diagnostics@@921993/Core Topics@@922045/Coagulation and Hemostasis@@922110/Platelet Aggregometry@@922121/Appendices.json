It is a well-posed quantitative problem based on the fundamental principle of conservation of solute in a dilution, using scientifically realistic parameters for a common laboratory procedure (Light Transmission Aggregometry). All necessary information is provided, and the terms are unambiguous.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of the amount of solute (in this case, Adenosine Diphosphate or ADP) during the dilution process. The amount of ADP in the volume of the working solution added to the cuvette must be equal to the total amount of ADP in the final reaction mixture, as the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is stated to contain no ADP initially.\n\nLet us define the variables as follows:\n- $C_w$ is the concentration of the ADP working solution.\n- $V_w$ is the volume of the ADP working solution to be added.\n- $C_f$ is the final concentration of ADP in the cuvette.\n- $V_f$ is the final total volume of the reaction mixture in the cuvette.\n\nThe amount of solute, $n$, in a given volume, $V$, of a solution with concentration, $C$, is given by the definition of molar concentration:\n$$n = C \\times V$$\n\nThe amount of ADP added from the working solution, $n_w$, is:\n$$n_w = C_w V_w$$\n\nThe total amount of ADP in the final reaction volume, $n_f$, is:\n$$n_f = C_f V_f$$\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of solute, the amount of ADP added must equal the amount present in the final mixture:\n$$n_w = n_f$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_w$ and $n_f$ yields the standard dilution equation:\n$$C_w V_w = C_f V_f$$\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the volume of the working solution, $V_w$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $V_w$:\n$$V_w = \\frac{C_f V_f}{C_w}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values provided in the problem statement:\n- $C_w = 100\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $C_f = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $V_f = 500\\ \\mu\\text{L}$\n\nPlugging these values into the equation for $V_w$:\n$$V_w = \\frac{(5\\ \\mu\\text{M}) \\times (500\\ \\mu\\text{L})}{100\\ \\mu\\text{M}}$$\n\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\text{M}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the result in units of volume ($\\mu\\text{L}$), as required.\n$$V_w = \\frac{2500}{100}\\ \\mu\\text{L}$$\n$$V_w = 25\\ \\mu\\text{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The underlying principle—that platelet aggregation reduces the turbidity of plasma, thereby increasing light transmission—is scientifically correct. PRP is turbid (low transmission) and represents the baseline ($0\\%$ aggregation), while PPP is clear (high transmission) and represents the maximum ($100\\%$ aggregation). The condition $I_{PPP} > I_{PRP}$ ($0.92 > 0.35$) is consistent with this principle.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is a classic two-point linear interpolation. It provides two points on a line (intensity vs. aggregation) and asks to find the aggregation value corresponding to an intermediate intensity. This structure guarantees a unique and stable solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms. The data provided are objective measurements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Transformation\nLet $A(t)$ be the aggregation at time $t$, expressed as a percentage. Let $I(t)$ be the measured light intensity. The problem states that the relationship between aggregation and intensity is linear. We can express this relationship as:\n$$A(I) = mI + c$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the y-intercept of the line.\n\nWe are given two calibration points:\n1.  For PRP, the intensity is $I_{PRP}$, and the aggregation is defined as $0\\%$. So, $A(I_{PRP}) = 0$.\n2.  For PPP, the intensity is $I_{PPP}$, and the aggregation is defined as $100\\%$. So, $A(I_{PPP}) = 100$.\n\nWe can use these two points to form a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $m$ and $c$:\n$$m \\cdot I_{PRP} + c = 0$$\n$$m \\cdot I_{PPP} + c = 100$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$m \\cdot I_{PPP} - m \\cdot I_{PRP} = 100 - 0$$\n$$m(I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}) = 100$$\nSolving for the slope $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{100}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the intercept $c$ using the first equation:\n$$c = -m \\cdot I_{PRP} = -\\frac{100 \\cdot I_{PRP}}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n\nSubstituting $m$ and $c$ back into the linear equation $A(I) = mI + c$, we obtain the general transformation from any measured intensity $I$ to the corresponding percent aggregation $A_{\\%}(I)$:\n$$A_{\\%}(I) = \\left(\\frac{100}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}\\right) I - \\frac{100 \\cdot I_{PRP}}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n$$A_{\\%}(I) = \\frac{100 \\cdot (I - I_{PRP})}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a dimensionless decimal fraction of $1$. Let's call this fractional aggregation $A_{f}$. This is simply the percentage aggregation divided by $100$:\n$$A_{f}(I) = \\frac{A_{\\%}(I)}{100} = \\frac{I - I_{PRP}}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n\n### Computation of Aggregation\nWe are asked to compute the aggregation at a time $t^{\\ast}$ where the measured intensity is $I(t^{\\ast}) = 0.73$. The other given values are $I_{PRP} = 0.35$ and $I_{PPP} = 0.92$. The time value $t^{\\ast} = 240$ seconds simply specifies the moment of measurement and is not required for the calculation itself.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the derived formula for fractional aggregation:\n$$A_{f}(I(t^{\\ast})) = \\frac{I(t^{\\ast}) - I_{PRP}}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\n$$A_{f}(0.73) = \\frac{0.73 - 0.35}{0.92 - 0.35}$$\n$$A_{f}(0.73) = \\frac{0.38}{0.57}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$A_{f}(0.73) = \\frac{38}{57} \\approx 0.666666...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$A_{f}(0.73) \\approx 0.6667$$\n\n### Units of Aggregation\nThe computed aggregation, $A_{f}$, is a dimensionless quantity. This can be seen from its definition:\n$$A_{f} = \\frac{I - I_{PRP}}{I_{PPP} - I_{PRP}}$$\nThe numerator $(I - I_{PRP})$ has units of intensity (arbitrary units in this case). The denominator $(I_{PPP} - I_{PRP})$ also has units of intensity. As the units in the numerator and denominator are identical, they cancel out, resulting in a pure, dimensionless ratio.
