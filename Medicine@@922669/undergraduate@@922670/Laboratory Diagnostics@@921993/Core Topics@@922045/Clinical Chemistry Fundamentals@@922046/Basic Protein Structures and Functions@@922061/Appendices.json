The protein concentration will be estimated using ultraviolet absorbance at $280~\\text{nm}$, which primarily reflects the contributions of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine in the protein’s primary structure.

The law states that the absorbance ($A$) is directly proportional to the concentration ($c$) of the absorbing species and the pathlength ($l$) of the light through the sample. The constant of proportionality is the molar extinction coefficient ($\\epsilon$), a characteristic of the substance at a specific wavelength.\n\nThe fundamental statement of the Beer-Lambert law is:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nIn this problem, the absorbance is measured at a wavelength of $280~\\text{nm}$, so the relevant parameters are $A_{280}$ and $\\epsilon_{280}$.

The target concentration is given as $c_{\\text{target}} = 15~\\mu\\text{M}$. The formula for the absolute fractional deviation is:\n$$\\text{Deviation} = \\frac{|c - c_{\\text{target}}|}{c_{\\text{target}}}$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $c$ for accuracy, we substitute the values for $c$ and $c_{\\text{target}}$, both in units of $\\mu\\text{M}$:\n$$\\text{Deviation} = \\frac{|16.666... - 15|}{15}$$\n$$\\text{Deviation} = \\frac{1.666...}{15}$$\n$$\\text{Deviation} = 0.1111...$$\nRounding this unitless value to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\text{Deviation} \\approx 0.1111$$\n\nAs an internal check, we compare this deviation to the stated tolerance. The allowable fractional tolerance is $\\pm 0.20$, which corresponds to an absolute fractional deviation limit of $0.20$. Since the calculated deviation $0.1111$ is less than $0.20$, the sample concentration is within the required tolerance for the downstream assay.

However, SDS does **not** cleave covalent bonds like disulfide bridges.\n    - Therefore, in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the majority of the protein remains as a $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dimer, explaining the predominant band at this position.\n    - The faint $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band represents a small population of monomers that were not covalently linked.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Proposed Experiment (Reducing SDS-PAGE):**\n    - The sample is treated with Dithiothreitol (DTT), a chemical reducing agent. The primary function of DTT is to cleave disulfide bonds (S-S) by reducing them to pairs of free thiol groups (-SH).\n    - **Effect on Intermolecular Bond:** The $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ DTT will effectively reduce and cleave the single intermolecular disulfide bond that holds the two monomers together. This will dissociate the $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dimer into its constituent $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ monomers.\n    - **Effect on Intramolecular Bonds:** The DTT will also reduce the $2$ intramolecular disulfide bonds within each monomer. These bonds are responsible for holding parts of the polypeptide chain together in specific loops, contributing to a more compact structure.\n    - **Predicted Gel Pattern:**\n        - The dissociation of the dimer means the band at $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ will disappear.\n        - The entire protein population will now consist of monomers. Consequently, a single predominant band will appear. The theoretical mass of this monomer is $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.\n        - **Mobility Shift:** The principle of SDS-PAGE is that proteins migrate based on their size (sieving), as SDS imparts a roughly uniform charge-to-mass ratio. However, a protein's effective hydrodynamic radius, or \"shape\", is also a factor. A protein with intact intramolecular disulfide bonds, even when denatured by SDS, may retain a more compact, somewhat globular conformation compared to a fully reduced polypeptide chain. When DTT breaks these internal cross-links, the monomeric polypeptide chain becomes fully linearized and more extended. A more extended, \"floppy\" molecule experiences greater frictional resistance as it moves through the pores of the polyacrylamide gel. This increased drag causes it to migrate more slowly. A slower migration in SDS-PAGE is interpreted as a higher apparent molecular mass.\n        - **Conclusion:** The new, predominant band corresponding to the fully reduced monomer will appear at an apparent molecular mass slightly *greater than* $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ because it migrates more slowly than a hypothetical non-reduced monomer. The faint $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band seen in the non-reducing gel (which consisted of non-reduced monomers) will be replaced by this new, intense band.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band disappears and a predominant band appears at approximately $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$; reduction of intramolecular disulfides yields a more extended polypeptide, causing the $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ monomer to migrate slightly more slowly (appearing at a somewhat higher apparent molecular mass than the non-reduced monomer band).**\n- This option correctly predicts that the $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dimer band will disappear and be replaced by a predominant monomer band.\n- Critically, it also correctly explains the subtle effect of reducing the intramolecular disulfide bonds: the polypeptide becomes more extended, leading to slower migration and a slightly higher apparent molecular mass. This comprehensive description aligns perfectly with the derived outcome.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. No significant change; SDS alone denatures and cleaves disulfide bonds, so the $96\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band remains predominant and the $48\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band remains faint.**\n- The premise that \"SDS alone ... cleaves disulfide bonds\" is factually incorrect. SDS is a denaturant but not a reducing agent. Covalent disulfide bonds are stable in the presence of SDS alone. This option misrepresents the function of SDS.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Multiple new bands above $96\\,\\mathrm\"kDa}$ appear because DTT promotes covalent crosslinking between cysteines, forming higher-order oligomers during SDS-PAGE.**\n- This option incorrectly describes the function of DTT. DTT is a *reducing* agent that *breaks* disulfide bonds. It prevents, rather than promotes, the formation of covalent crosslinks.

Two lower bands near $24\\,\\mathrm\"kDa}$ emerge because DTT hydrolyzes peptide bonds at cysteine residues, fragmenting the monomer into halves.**\n- This option incorrectly attributes a proteolytic function to DTT.
