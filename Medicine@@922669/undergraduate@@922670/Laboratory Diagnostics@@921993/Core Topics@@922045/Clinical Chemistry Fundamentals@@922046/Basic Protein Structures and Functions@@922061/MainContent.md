## Introduction
Proteins are the workhorses of life, performing a vast array of functions from catalyzing metabolic reactions to providing structural support and defending against pathogens. The incredible [functional diversity](@entry_id:148586) of proteins stems from their ability to fold into precise three-dimensional structures. But how does a simple linear chain of amino acids specify a complex, functional molecular machine? This article bridges the gap between fundamental chemistry and biological function, providing a foundational understanding of protein architecture.

Across the following chapters, you will embark on a journey from the building blocks to the final assembly. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will explore the physicochemical properties of amino acids and the forces that govern the hierarchy of [protein structure](@entry_id:140548), from the primary sequence to the stable tertiary fold. We will then examine how this structure enables key functions like [molecular binding](@entry_id:200964) and catalysis. In "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will see how these principles are applied in the laboratory through techniques like [electrophoresis](@entry_id:173548) and [immunoassays](@entry_id:189605), which are central to modern diagnostics. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will challenge you to apply this knowledge to solve realistic biochemical problems. Let's begin by examining the fundamental principles that dictate how proteins are built and how they work.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Building Blocks: Physicochemical Properties of Amino Acids

The remarkable diversity of [protein structure and function](@entry_id:272521) originates from the chemical properties of its fundamental building blocks, the 20 standard **amino acids**. While all share a common backbone structure consisting of a central alpha-carbon ($C_{\alpha}$) bonded to an amino group, a [carboxyl group](@entry_id:196503), and a hydrogen atom, it is the fourth [substituent](@entry_id:183115)—the **side chain (R-group)**—that defines each amino acid's unique identity. The sequence of these side chains dictates how a [protein folds](@entry_id:185050) into a specific three-dimensional shape and how it interacts with its environment and other molecules. Understanding protein function therefore begins with a systematic classification of these [side chains](@entry_id:182203) based on their physicochemical properties, primarily polarity, charge, and size.

These properties are not abstract; they have direct consequences for protein behavior in the aqueous environments typical of biological systems and laboratory assays, such as a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at physiological pH ($7.4$) [@problem_id:5210572]. We can group the [amino acid side chains](@entry_id:164196) as follows:

*   **Nonpolar, Aliphatic Side Chains**: This group includes [glycine](@entry_id:176531) (Gly), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and methionine (Met). Their side chains are composed primarily of hydrocarbon chains, which are hydrophobic (water-fearing). In an aqueous solution, these [side chains](@entry_id:182203) are poorly solvated. Their tendency to avoid water and associate with each other is a primary driving force for protein folding, a phenomenon known as the **[hydrophobic effect](@entry_id:146085)**. This effect causes [nonpolar side chains](@entry_id:186313) to be preferentially buried in the protein's core, away from the aqueous solvent. Proline (Pro) is also in this class, but its side chain forms a rigid ring by bonding back to the backbone nitrogen atom, imposing unique conformational constraints.

*   **Aromatic Side Chains**: Phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp) contain aromatic rings. Phenylalanine is strongly nonpolar, similar to the aliphatic amino acids. However, tyrosine's hydroxyl group and tryptophan's nitrogen-containing indole ring impart significant polar character, allowing them to participate in hydrogen bonding. These large, rigid side chains are often found in the protein interior, where they can engage in favorable packing interactions, but their polar features also permit them to be located on the protein surface.

*   **Polar, Uncharged Side Chains**: Serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), [cysteine](@entry_id:186378) (Cys), asparagine (Asn), and glutamine (Gln) possess [side chains](@entry_id:182203) with [functional groups](@entry_id:139479) capable of forming hydrogen bonds. The hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine, and the amide groups of asparagine and glutamine, can act as both **hydrogen bond donors** and **hydrogen bond acceptors**. This makes them hydrophilic (water-loving). Consequently, these residues are commonly found on the solvent-exposed surface of proteins, where they can interact favorably with water molecules, contributing to the protein's solubility.

*   **Positively Charged (Basic) Side Chains**: Lysine (Lys), arginine (Arg), and histidine (His) have [side chains](@entry_id:182203) that are positively charged at physiological pH. The amino group of lysine and the guanidinium group of arginine have high **$pK_a$ values** (typically around $10.5$ and $12.5$, respectively). The **$pK_a$** is the pH at which a titratable group is 50% protonated and 50% deprotonated. According to the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**, $\mathrm{pH} = pK_a + \log \frac{[\text{conjugate base}]}{[\text{acid}]}$, when the pH is significantly below the $pK_a$, the group exists predominantly in its protonated, conjugate acid form. Thus, at pH $7.4$, lysine and arginine are overwhelmingly protonated and carry a $+1$ charge. In this state, they are excellent hydrogen bond donors but cannot act as acceptors. Histidine is unique because its imidazole side chain has a $pK_a$ near physiological pH (typically $\approx 6.0$ in proteins, though it can vary). This means that at pH $7.4$, a significant fraction of histidine residues are in their neutral, deprotonated form, allowing histidine to act as both a [proton donor](@entry_id:149359) and acceptor in chemical reactions. This property makes histidine a key residue in many enzyme [active sites](@entry_id:152165).

*   **Negatively Charged (Acidic) Side Chains**: Aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) have carboxyl groups in their [side chains](@entry_id:182203) with low $pK_a$ values (around $3.9$ and $4.1$, respectively). At pH $7.4$, these groups are almost completely deprotonated to their carboxylate forms ($\mathrm{-COO^-}$), carrying a $-1$ charge. The carboxylate group is an excellent [hydrogen bond acceptor](@entry_id:139503). The presence of these charged hydrophilic groups on the protein surface enhances solubility through favorable interactions with water and electrostatic repulsion between protein molecules [@problem_id:5210572].

The collective acid-base behavior of all these ionizable groups determines a protein's overall net charge at a given pH. The pH at which the net charge is exactly zero is a crucial property known as the **[isoelectric point](@entry_id:158415) ($pI$)**. At a pH below its $pI$, a protein has a net positive charge; at a pH above its $pI$, it has a net negative charge. This principle is the basis for separation techniques like **Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)**, where a protein migrates in a pH gradient until it reaches the position where $\mathrm{pH} = pI$ and its migration halts [@problem_id:5210603].

The $pI$ of a protein is dictated by the number and type of its ionizable residues. A protein rich in basic residues like lysine and arginine will have a high $pI$, as a more alkaline environment is needed to deprotonate the positive groups to achieve neutrality. Conversely, a protein rich in acidic residues like aspartate and glutamate will have a low $pI$. This dependency can be illustrated by considering a hypothetical peptide with an N-terminus ($pK_a=8.0$), a C-terminus ($pK_a=3.1$), and [side chains](@entry_id:182203) of lysine ($pK_a=10.5$), histidine ($pK_a=6.0$), and glutamate ($pK_a=4.1$). By tracking the protonation state of each group as the pH increases, one can determine that the peptide's net charge transitions from $+1$ to $0$ in the pH range between $6.0$ and $8.0$. The $pI$ for this peptide is therefore found by balancing these charges, yielding a value very close to $7.0$. This calculation highlights how the $pI$ is a direct consequence of the protein's amino acid composition. Furthermore, any chemical modification that alters a charge will shift the $pI$. For example, the acetylation of lysine's amino group converts it to a neutral amide, removing a positive charge and thus lowering the protein's $pI$ [@problem_id:5210603].

### The Polypeptide Chain: From Primary to Secondary Structure

The covalent linkage of amino acids into a [linear polymer](@entry_id:186536) creates the protein's **primary structure**. This linkage is the **[peptide bond](@entry_id:144731)**, an amide bond formed between the [carboxyl group](@entry_id:196503) of one amino acid and the amino group of the next. The properties of this bond are fundamental to all subsequent levels of protein architecture.

A key feature of the [peptide bond](@entry_id:144731) is its rigidity and planarity. This arises because of **resonance**, where the lone pair of electrons on the amide nitrogen is delocalized into the [carbonyl group](@entry_id:147570). This gives the $\mathrm{C-N}$ bond significant (about 40%) [partial double-bond character](@entry_id:173537). As a result, rotation around this bond is highly restricted. This [constraint forces](@entry_id:170257) the six atoms of the peptide group—the alpha-carbon of the first residue ($C_{\alpha,i}$), its carbonyl carbon and oxygen ($C'_i, O_i$), and the amide nitrogen, hydrogen, and alpha-carbon of the next residue ($N_{i+1}, H_{i+1}, C_{\alpha,i+1}$)—to lie in a single plane [@problem_id:5210612].

While rotation around the [peptide bond](@entry_id:144731) (angle $\omega$) is restricted, two main conformations are possible. The **trans conformation** ($\omega \approx 180^\circ$), where the adjacent alpha-carbons are on opposite sides of the [peptide bond](@entry_id:144731), is overwhelmingly favored for most amino acid pairs due to minimized [steric clash](@entry_id:177563) between [side chains](@entry_id:182203). The **cis conformation** ($\omega \approx 0^\circ$), with alpha-carbons on the same side, is sterically unfavorable and thus very rare. However, peptide bonds preceding a **proline** residue are an important exception. Because proline's side chain is cyclized onto its own backbone nitrogen, the steric difference between its cis and trans forms is much smaller. Consequently, a significant fraction (5–10%) of X-Pro peptide bonds in proteins are found in the cis conformation.

This structural peculiarity has significant functional consequences. For instance, in laboratory techniques like **[bottom-up proteomics](@entry_id:167180)**, proteins are often digested by enzymes like trypsin, which cleaves after lysine and arginine residues. However, [trypsin](@entry_id:167497)'s action is strongly inhibited if the residue following the cleavage site (the P1' position) is proline. The rigid ring of [proline](@entry_id:166601) in this position creates a conformation that fits poorly into the enzyme's active site. This leads to "missed cleavages" at Lys-Pro or Arg-Pro sequences, a common observation that is directly explained by the unique chemistry of the [peptide bond](@entry_id:144731) involving [proline](@entry_id:166601) [@problem_id:5210612].

With the peptide bond being rigid and planar, the conformation of the [polypeptide backbone](@entry_id:178461) is determined by rotation around the two other single bonds connected to the alpha-carbon: the $N-C_{\alpha}$ bond (torsion angle $\boldsymbol{\phi}$) and the $C_{\alpha}-C'$ bond (torsion angle $\boldsymbol{\psi}$). Not all combinations of $\phi$ and $\psi$ are possible, as many would lead to severe steric clashes between atoms. The **Ramachandran plot** is a two-dimensional map of all possible ($\phi, \psi$) pairs, highlighting the sterically "allowed" regions. These allowed regions are not uniformly populated; rather, certain combinations are particularly stable because they permit the formation of regular patterns of hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. These stable, repeating local structures constitute the protein's **[secondary structure](@entry_id:138950)**.

The Ramachandran plot reveals that the vast majority of residues in [globular proteins](@entry_id:193087) fall into a few well-defined basins [@problem_id:5210622]:
1.  The largest allowed region, in the upper-left quadrant (e.g., $\phi \approx -135^\circ, \psi \approx +135^\circ$), corresponds to the extended conformation found in **$\beta$-strands**.
2.  A distinct region in the lower-left quadrant (around $\phi \approx -60^\circ, \psi \approx -45^\circ$) corresponds to the compact coil of the **right-handed $\alpha$-helix**.
3.  A smaller region in the upper-right quadrant, corresponding to the left-handed $\alpha$-helix, is sterically disfavored for L-amino acids but can be occupied by **glycine**. Glycine's side chain is just a single hydrogen atom, allowing it much greater conformational freedom and access to regions of the Ramachandran plot that are forbidden to all other amino acids.
4.  **Proline**, in contrast, has its $\phi$ angle locked by its ring structure to a narrow range around $-60^\circ$, severely restricting its conformational possibilities.

The two major types of secondary structure are the $\alpha$-helix and the $\beta$-sheet.
*   The **$\alpha$-helix** is a right-handed coil stabilized by a regular pattern of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide proton of residue $i+4$. These hydrogen bonds are nearly parallel to the helix axis. This regular arrangement results in characteristic dihedral angles of approximately $\phi \approx -57^\circ$ and $\psi \approx -47^\circ$. A noteworthy property of the $\alpha$-helix is its **macrodipole**, arising from the cumulative alignment of all peptide bond dipoles, which creates a partial positive charge at the N-terminus and a partial negative charge at the C-terminus.
*   The **$\beta$-sheet** is built from extended polypeptide segments called $\beta$-strands. Unlike the helix, its hydrogen bonds are inter-strand, linking two or more different segments of the chain that lie side-by-side. The strands can run in the same direction (**parallel $\beta$-sheet**) or in opposite directions (**antiparallel $\beta$-sheet**). Antiparallel sheets are particularly stable because they allow for nearly linear, and thus stronger, hydrogen bonds between the strands. Residues in $\beta$-sheets adopt extended conformations with [dihedral angles](@entry_id:185221) in the upper-left quadrant of the Ramachandran plot (e.g., $\phi \approx -139^\circ, \psi \approx 135^\circ$ for antiparallel sheets) [@problem_id:5210594].

### Folding and Stability: From Tertiary Structure to a Stable Fold

The overall three-dimensional arrangement of a single polypeptide chain, including the spatial disposition of its various secondary structure elements and the turns and loops connecting them, is known as its **[tertiary structure](@entry_id:138239)**. The process by which a linear polypeptide chain adopts its unique, functional [tertiary structure](@entry_id:138239) is called protein folding. This process is not random; it is a thermodynamically driven search for the lowest free-energy conformation in a given environment.

The Gibbs free energy of folding, $\Delta G_{\text{fold}}$, determines the stability of the native state relative to the unfolded ensemble of conformations. The relationship $\Delta G_{\text{fold}} = \Delta H_{\text{fold}} - T\Delta S_{\text{fold}}$ shows that folding is a balance between enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and entropy ($\Delta S$). We can dissect the entropy term further into contributions from the protein and the solvent: $\Delta S_{\text{fold}} = \Delta S_{\text{protein}} + \Delta S_{\text{solvent}}$. Folding a disordered polypeptide chain into a single native structure dramatically decreases the protein's conformational entropy ($\Delta S_{\text{protein}} \lt 0$), which is a large unfavorable contribution to the overall free energy. For folding to be spontaneous ($\Delta G_{\text{fold}} \lt 0$), this entropic penalty must be overcome by favorable enthalpic contributions (from forming non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts) and/or a favorable change in the solvent's entropy.

For most [globular proteins](@entry_id:193087) in water, the dominant driving force for folding is the **hydrophobic effect**, which is fundamentally an entropic effect of the solvent [@problem_id:5210551]. When a nonpolar side chain is exposed to water, the water molecules cannot form their preferred hydrogen bonds with the nonpolar group. Instead, they are forced to arrange themselves into ordered, cage-like "clathrate" structures around the nonpolar surface to maximize their hydrogen bonding with each other. This ordering of solvent molecules represents a highly unfavorable decrease in the solvent's entropy. Protein folding solves this problem by sequestering [nonpolar side chains](@entry_id:186313) into the protein's core, minimizing their contact with water. This releases the ordered water molecules into the bulk solvent, leading to a large, favorable increase in solvent entropy ($\Delta S_{\text{solvent}} \gg 0$). This large positive [entropy change](@entry_id:138294) makes the $-T\Delta S_{\text{solvent}}$ term strongly negative, overpowering the unfavorable loss of the protein's [conformational entropy](@entry_id:170224) and driving the folding process. This can also be viewed from the perspective of **cavity formation free energy** ($\Delta G_{\text{cav}}$), the positive free energy cost of creating a void in the solvent to accommodate a solute. Folding minimizes the total surface area that requires such cavities, thus minimizing this energetic cost [@problem_id:5210551].

This thermodynamic principle directly explains the general architecture of [globular proteins](@entry_id:193087): a [hydrophobic core](@entry_id:193706) packed with nonpolar residues, and a hydrophilic surface decorated with polar and charged residues that can interact favorably with water [@problem_id:5210614]. This partitioning is not just an abstract concept; it has profound practical implications. For instance, in designing an immunoassay like an **ELISA**, one must choose an appropriate **epitope** (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody). A peptide chosen from a solvent-exposed, hydrophilic loop of a protein will likely be stable and soluble in the aqueous assay buffer, retaining its native conformation and remaining accessible for antibody binding. In contrast, a peptide from a hydrophobic transmembrane segment would be unstable in water, tending to aggregate with itself or denature upon adsorption to the hydrophobic plastic plate, destroying the epitope and leading to poor assay performance [@problem_id:5210614].

The stability of the native fold is a delicate balance. **Denaturation**, the loss of native secondary and [tertiary structure](@entry_id:138239), can be induced by changes in temperature, pH, or the presence of chemical agents. This process should be distinguished from proteolysis or hydrolysis, as denaturation typically leaves the [primary structure](@entry_id:144876)'s covalent bonds intact. For many small proteins, denaturation can be a reversible process of **unfolding** (Native Folded, F $\rightleftharpoons$ Unfolded, U). However, the unfolded state often exposes the [hydrophobic core](@entry_id:193706) residues that are normally buried. These "sticky" patches can lead to intermolecular association, forming **aggregates** (A). Aggregation is often kinetically irreversible and represents a major pathway for loss of protein function, as aggregated protein is removed from the pool of refoldable molecules. The stability of protein reagents in diagnostic labs is a critical concern, as a temperature excursion can shift the equilibrium toward the unfolded state, accelerating the rate of irreversible aggregation and leading to a permanent loss of activity, even after returning to the correct storage temperature [@problem_id:5210593].

Protein stability is also sensitive to buffer composition. The [helix macrodipole](@entry_id:163714) and the charged [side chains](@entry_id:182203) on a protein's surface interact with each other and with ions in the solution. At physiological [ionic strength](@entry_id:152038) ($\approx 150\,\mathrm{mM}$ salt), these [electrostatic interactions](@entry_id:166363) are screened. Lowering the ionic strength enhances these interactions, which can be either stabilizing (if attractive) or destabilizing (if repulsive). Furthermore, changing the pH alters the protonation state of acidic and basic residues. For example, lowering the pH from $7.4$ to $5.0$ would protonate acidic residues (like glutamate), neutralizing their negative charge. This could disrupt a stabilizing [salt bridge](@entry_id:147432) or a favorable interaction with the positive end of an $\alpha$-[helix macrodipole](@entry_id:163714), leading to destabilization of the structure [@problem_id:5210594]. Chemical denaturants like urea act by weakening the [hydrophobic effect](@entry_id:146085); they are good solvents for nonpolar groups, reducing the entropic penalty of exposing them to the solvent and thus making the unfolded state more favorable [@problem_id:5210551].

### Protein Function: Binding, Assembly, and Catalysis

A protein's precisely folded structure is the key to its function, which is most often realized through specific interactions with other molecules.

#### Molecular Recognition and Binding Affinity

The binding of a protein (P) to a ligand (L), such as an antibody binding to an antigen, can be described by the reversible equilibrium $P + L \rightleftharpoons PL$. The strength of this interaction is quantified by the **equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d$)**, defined by the law of mass action:

$K_d = \frac{[P][L]}{[PL]}$

where $[P]$, $[L]$, and $[PL]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of free protein, free ligand, and the protein-ligand complex, respectively. A smaller $K_d$ value signifies a tighter binding interaction. Kinetically, $K_d$ is the ratio of the dissociation rate constant ($k_{\text{off}}$) to the association rate constant ($k_{\text{on}}$), i.e., $K_d = k_{\text{off}} / k_{\text{on}}$.

The extent of binding is often described by the **fractional occupancy ($\theta$)**, which is the fraction of protein binding sites that are occupied by the ligand. For a simple one-to-one binding model, this is given by the Langmuir [binding isotherm](@entry_id:164935):

$\theta = \frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$

This equation reveals the direct experimental meaning of $K_d$: it is the free ligand concentration at which half of the binding sites are occupied ($\theta = 0.5$). In a diagnostic assay like an ELISA, where the signal is proportional to the amount of bound complex, the titration of an antigen will produce a hyperbolic binding curve. The $K_d$ can be determined as the antigen concentration that yields a half-maximal signal [@problem_id:5210547].

#### Quaternary Structure and Avidity

Many proteins function as assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits). This level of organization is termed **[quaternary structure](@entry_id:137176)**. A complex of two identical subunits is a **homodimer**, while a complex of four subunits with at least two different types is a **heterotetramer**. These assemblies can be stable or **transient**, forming and dissociating on a biologically relevant timescale [@problem_id:5210573].

Quaternary structure provides a powerful mechanism for enhancing binding strength through **multivalency**. An antibody, for example, is bivalent, having two identical antigen-binding sites. If its target antigen is also multivalent (e.g., a homodimer with two identical epitopes), the antibody can bind to both epitopes simultaneously. This multivalent binding is significantly stronger than the corresponding monovalent interaction, an effect known as **avidity**.

The mechanism behind [avidity](@entry_id:182004) is kinetic. Once one arm of the antibody binds to one epitope, the second epitope on the antigen is held at a very high effective local concentration, dramatically increasing the rate of the second binding event. More importantly, for the entire complex to dissociate, both binding interactions must break. If one bond breaks, the other holds the complex together, giving the first bond a high probability of reforming before the second one can also dissociate. This drastically reduces the overall, or apparent, dissociation rate of the complex. In an ELISA, this means that a stable homodimeric or heterotetrameric antigen will remain bound to a capture antibody far more tenaciously during wash steps than its monomeric counterpart. A transient dimer, however, cannot fully capitalize on this effect; if the dimer itself falls apart while bound, the [avidity](@entry_id:182004) is lost, and it reverts to weaker monovalent binding, leading to a much lower retained signal [@problem_id:5210573].

#### Catalysis and Enzyme Kinetics

Perhaps the most celebrated protein function is catalysis. **Enzymes** are proteins that accelerate the rate of biochemical reactions, often by many orders of magnitude. The kinetics of many enzymes can be described by the **Michaelis-Menten model**, where the enzyme (E) binds a substrate (S) to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES), which then turns over to release product (P) and regenerate the free enzyme: $E + S \rightleftharpoons ES \rightarrow E + P$.

The initial velocity ($v$) of the reaction follows the Michaelis-Menten equation:

$v = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$

The parameters in this equation provide crucial insights into an enzyme's performance [@problem_id:5210630]:
*   **$V_{max}$ (maximal velocity)** is the reaction rate when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($[S] \gg K_m$). It is proportional to the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_t$, via the relation $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_t$.
*   **$k_{cat}$ (turnover number)** is the intrinsic maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per [enzyme active site](@entry_id:141261) per unit time. It has units of $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and represents the enzyme's catalytic speed when it is not waiting for substrate.
*   **$K_m$ (Michaelis constant)** is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{max}$. It is a composite of rate constants ($K_m = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})/k_1$) and reflects how effectively the enzyme binds and converts the substrate. A low $K_m$ often indicates a high affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.

While $k_{cat}$ describes performance at high substrate concentrations, many physiological and diagnostic scenarios involve low substrate concentrations. In the limit where $[S] \ll K_m$, the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies to:

$v \approx \frac{k_{cat}}{K_m} [E]_t [S]$

This reveals that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the ratio **$k_{cat}/K_m$**, known as the **[catalytic efficiency](@entry_id:146951)** or [specificity constant](@entry_id:189162). This [second-order rate constant](@entry_id:181189) is the best measure for comparing enzyme performance at low substrate levels. When designing a sensitive diagnostic assay to measure a low-abundance substrate, one should choose an enzyme with the highest possible $k_{cat}/K_m$, even if its maximal turnover rate ($k_{cat}$) is not the highest. An enzyme with a very low $K_m$ can be highly efficient at "capturing" scarce substrate molecules, leading to a much higher reaction rate and thus greater sensitivity than an enzyme with a higher $k_{cat}$ but also a much higher $K_m$ [@problem_id:5210630].
