This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum[\\text{Cations}] = \\sum[\\text{Anions}]\n$$\nIn clinical laboratory diagnostics, these ions are partitioned into those that are routinely measured and those that are not (unmeasured). The standard anion gap calculation uses the principal measured cation, sodium ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$), and the principal measured anions, chloride ($[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$) and bicarbonate ($[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$). The electroneutrality equation can be conceptually written as:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + \\text{Unmeasured Cations (UC)} = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] + \\text{Unmeasured Anions (UA)}\n$$\nThe standard anion gap, denoted $AG$, is defined as the difference between the unmeasured anions and unmeasured cations.

Albumin is a major contributor to the $AG$ because it carries a net negative charge at physiological blood $pH$. Consequently, a lower-than-normal albumin concentration (hypoalbuminemia) leads to a reduction in the total concentration of unmeasured anions, which can mask an underlying high anion gap metabolic acidosis by artificially lowering the calculated $AG$.\n\nTo address this, the problem provides an empirical basis for correcting the $AG$.
