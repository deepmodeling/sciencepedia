The error is $+0.975\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$. While in this specific case the misreading does not lead to an incorrect clinical classification (both values are euglycemic), the systematic positive bias of this GDH-PQQ meter poses a significant risk. The primary clinical risk is the masking of hypoglycemia (blood glucose $< 3.9\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$). If a patient's true glucose were dangerously low, the maltose interference could cause the meter to display a value in the normal range. For example, a true glucose of $3.5\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$ would be reported as $3.5 + 0.975 = 4.475\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$. This failure to detect and report a hypoglycemic state would prevent timely, life-saving treatment, posing a severe risk to the patient.
