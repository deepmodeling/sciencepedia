At the $2$-hour time point, a central laboratory reports a venous plasma glucose concentration of $9.80\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. A point-of-care device used in some OGTT settings measures glucose in whole blood and, depending on calibration, may not directly report plasma-equivalent values. You are asked to explain, from first principles, why a whole-blood glucose concentration differs from a plasma glucose concentration and to derive a conversion from plasma to whole-blood concentration using physically realistic parameters.\n\nUse the following well-established facts and definitions as your starting base:\n- Glucose is freely permeable across the red blood cell (RBC) membrane via facilitative transport (for example, GLUT1), so at steady state its concentration in the aqueous phase is equal in plasma water and erythrocyte (RBC) intracellular water.\n- A reported concentration is the amount of analyte per unit bulk volume of the specimen, not per unit of water volume.\n- Let $H$ denote the hematocrit, the fraction of whole blood volume occupied by erythrocytes. Typical adult values are $H \\approx 0.45$.\n- Let $f_{P}$ denote the plasma water fraction (volume of water per unit volume of plasma), and $f_{E}$ denote the erythrocyte water fraction (volume of water per unit volume of packed erythrocytes).

Express the final answer in $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a three-part response: a qualitative explanation for the difference between whole-blood and plasma glucose concentrations, a symbolic derivation of the conversion formula, and a numerical calculation based on provided data. We will address each part in sequence, starting from the fundamental principles given.\n\nLet $c_{P}$ be the glucose concentration in plasma and $c_{W}$ be the glucose concentration in whole blood. The units of concentration are amount of substance per unit volume of the specimen (e.g., $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). Let $H$ be the hematocrit, defined as the volume fraction of erythrocytes (RBCs) in whole blood. Thus, for a total volume of whole blood $V_{W}$, the volume of erythrocytes is $V_{E} = H V_{W}$ and the volume of plasma is $V_{P} = (1-H)V_{W}$. Let $f_{P}$ be the volume fraction of water in plasma, and $f_{E}$ be the volume fraction of water in erythrocytes.\n\n1. Qualitative Explanation\n\nThe discrepancy between whole-blood glucose concentration ($c_W$) and plasma glucose concentration ($c_P$) arises from two key facts: (1) glucose is dissolved only in the aqueous phase of blood compartments, and (2) the aqueous fraction is not uniform across these compartments.\n\nPlasma and erythrocytes are not entirely water; they contain proteins (e.g., albumin in plasma, hemoglobin in erythrocytes) and other solids that occupy volume. The water fraction of plasma is given as $f_{P} = 0.93$, while for erythrocytes it is $f_{E} = 0.71$. This means that a unit volume of plasma contains more water than a unit volume of erythrocytes.\n\nThe problem states that glucose concentration is at a steady state and is equal in the *aqueous phase* of both plasma and erythrocytes. Let's denote this uniform aqueous concentration by $c_{aq}$. The reported bulk concentrations, $c_P$ and $c_W$, are the total amount of glucose divided by the total bulk volume of the specimen (plasma or whole blood).\n\nSince the concentration $c_{aq}$ is uniform in the water of both plasma and erythrocytes, the amount of glucose in any given volume of a compartment is proportional to the volume of water in that compartment. Because erythrocytes have a lower water fraction ($f_E  f_P$), a unit volume of erythrocytes contains less water and therefore less glucose than a unit volume of plasma.\n\nWhole blood is a mixture of plasma and the \"glucose-poorer\" (per unit volume) erythrocytes. Consequently, the volume-weighted average concentration of glucose in whole blood ($c_W$) must be lower than the concentration in plasma ($c_P$).\n\n2. Symbolic Derivation\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $c_{W}$ in terms of $c_{P}$, $H$, $f_{P}$, and $f_{E}$.\n\nThe total amount of glucose in a volume of whole blood, $n_{W}$, is the sum of the glucose in the plasma, $n_{P}$, and the glucose in the erythrocytes, $n_{E}$:\n$$n_{W} = n_{P} + n_{E}$$\nThe concentration in whole blood is defined as the total amount of glucose per total volume of whole blood:\n$$c_{W} = \\frac{n_{W}}{V_{W}} = \\frac{n_{P} + n_{E}}{V_{W}}$$\n\nLet us express $n_{P}$ and $n_{E}$ in terms of the given variables.\nThe reported plasma concentration is $c_{P} = \\frac{n_{P}}{V_{P}}$. This allows us to write $n_{P} = c_{P}V_{P}$. Substituting $V_{P} = (1-H)V_{W}$, we get:\n$$n_{P} = c_{P}(1-H)V_{W}$$\n\nTo find $n_{E}$, we must use the principle that glucose concentration is uniform in the water phase. Let $c_{aq}$ be this concentration. The amount of glucose in any compartment is $c_{aq}$ multiplied by the volume of water in that compartment.\n\nFor plasma, the volume of water is $V_{P,water} = f_{P}V_{P}$. The amount of glucose is $n_{P} = c_{aq} V_{P,water} = c_{aq} f_{P} V_{P}$.\nWe can now relate the physically fundamental concentration $c_{aq}$ to the measured bulk concentration $c_{P}$:\n$$c_{P} = \\frac{n_{P}}{V_{P}} = \\frac{c_{aq} f_{P} V_{P}}{V_{P}} = c_{aq} f_{P}$$\nThis gives us a crucial relationship:\n$$c_{aq} = \\frac{c_{P}}{f_{P}}$$\n\nNow we apply this to the erythrocytes. The volume of erythrocytes is $V_{E} = H V_{W}$. The volume of water within these erythrocytes is $V_{E,water} = f_{E}V_{E} = f_{E}H V_{W}$.\nThe amount of glucose in the erythrocytes, $n_{E}$, is:\n$$n_{E} = c_{aq} V_{E,water} = \\left(\\frac{c_{P}}{f_{P}}\\right) (f_{E}H V_{W})$$\n$$n_{E} = c_{P} H \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} V_{W}$$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $n_{P}$ and $n_{E}$ back into the equation for $c_{W}$:\n$$c_{W} = \\frac{n_{P} + n_{E}}{V_{W}} = \\frac{c_{P}(1-H)V_{W} + c_{P} H \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} V_{W}}{V_{W}}$$\nThe term $V_{W}$ cancels out:\n$$c_{W} = c_{P}(1-H) + c_{P} H \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}}$$\nFactoring out $c_{P}$, we arrive at the final symbolic expression:\n$$c_{W} = c_{P} \\left[ (1-H) + H \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} \\right]$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$c_{W} = c_{P} \\left[ 1 - H + H \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} \\right] = c_{P} \\left[ 1 - H \\left( 1 - \\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} \\right) \\right]$$\nThis expression relates the whole-blood concentration to the plasma concentration using the hematocrit and the water fractions of the two compartments.\n\n3. Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Plasma glucose concentration, $c_{P} = 9.80\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n- Hematocrit, $H = 0.45$\n- Plasma water fraction, $f_{P} = 0.93$\n- Erythrocyte water fraction, $f_{E} = 0.71$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$c_{W} = 9.80 \\left[ 1 - 0.45 \\left( 1 - \\frac{0.71}{0.93} \\right) \\right]$$\nFirst, calculate the ratio of water fractions:\n$$\\frac{f_{E}}{f_{P}} = \\frac{0.71}{0.93} \\approx 0.76344086$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression in the parentheses:\n$$1 - \\frac{0.71}{0.93} \\approx 1 - 0.76344086 = 0.23655914$$\nNext, multiply by the hematocrit:\n$$0.45 \\times 0.23655914 \\approx 0.106451613$$\nNow, evaluate the term in the square brackets:\n$$1 - 0.106451613 = 0.893548387$$\nFinally, multiply by the plasma concentration $c_{P}$:\n$$c_{W} = 9.80 \\times 0.893548387 \\approx 8.75677419\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$c_{W} \\approx 8.757\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$$\nThis result confirms the qualitative reasoning that the whole-blood glucose concentration is lower than the plasma glucose concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.757}$$", "id": "5232397"}]}
