Derivation of the General Expression**\n\nThe net current, $I_{\\mathrm{net}}$, measured by the amperometric sensor is directly proportional to the rate of electron transfer at the electrode. According to Faraday's law of electrolysis, this is given by:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = n F (\\text{molar rate of electron transfer})$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of analyte ($n=2$ for BHB), and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nThe molar rate of electron transfer is derived from the enzymatic reaction. The total molar rate of BHB conversion within the sensor strip is the product of the volumetric reaction rate, $v$, and the effective reaction volume, $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Each converted BHB molecule yields $n$ electrons. Thus, the molar rate of electron transfer is $n \\cdot v \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The current is then:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = F \\cdot (n \\cdot v \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = n F v V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the following dependencies:\n- Linearized Michaelis–Menten kinetics: $v = \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M}\\right) E_t [\\mathrm{BHB}]$, where $k_{cat}$ is the catalytic turnover number, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, and $E_t$ is the total enzyme concentration.\n- Hematocrit-corrected volume: $V_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1 - H) V$, where $H$ is the hematocrit and $V$ is the geometric volume.\n- Temperature-dependent catalytic turnover: $k_{cat}(T) = k_{cat}(25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\, Q_{10}^{\\frac{T - 25}{10}}$, where $T$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $I_{\\mathrm{net}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = n F \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}(25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) \\, Q_{10}^{\\frac{T - 25}{10}}}{K_M} E_t [\\mathrm{BHB}] \\right) \\left( (1 - H) V \\right)$$\n\nWe can consolidate all lot-specific, temperature-independent parameters into a single calibration constant, $C$:\n$$C = n F \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}(25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})}{K_M}\\right) E_t V$$\nThis simplifies the relationship between net current and BHB concentration to:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = C \\cdot [\\mathrm{BHB}] \\cdot (1 - H) \\cdot Q_{10}^{\\frac{T - 25}{10}}$$\nThe net current is the difference between the raw measured current $I_{\\mathrm{raw}}$ and the baseline current $I_b$, so $I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{raw}} - I_b$.\n\n**2. Use of Calibration Data**\n\nThe constant $C$ is determined using the calibration data, denoted with a 'cal' subscript: $T_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 25 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $H_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 0$, $[\\mathrm{BHB}]_{\\mathrm{cal}}$, $I_{\\mathrm{raw, cal}}$, and $I_{\\mathrm{b, cal}}$.\nFor the calibration, the temperature-correction term is $Q_{10}^{\\frac{25 - 25}{10}} = Q_{10}^{0} = 1$, and the hematocrit-correction term is $(1 - 0) = 1$.
