The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nLet $C_{HDL,true}$ represent the true concentration of HDL-C in the specimen. Let $C_{non-HDL}$ represent the concentration of all non-HDL cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. The total cholesterol concentration, $C_{total}$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$C_{total} = C_{HDL,true} + C_{non-HDL}$$\n\nThe described laboratory method aims to isolate HDL-C by precipitating all non-HDL components. In an ideal scenario, the precipitate would contain all the non-HDL lipoproteins, and the supernatant would contain only the HDL lipoproteins. An enzymatic assay for cholesterol performed on this ideal supernatant would yield the true HDL-C concentration, $C_{HDL,true}$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the precipitation is incomplete. A fixed fraction, let's call it $f$, of the non-HDL-C remains in the supernatant. The problem specifies that this fraction is $f = 1\\%$, which is numerically equivalent to $f = 0.01$.
