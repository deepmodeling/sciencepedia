A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to convert a mass concentration to a molar concentration. Let the given mass concentration be $C_{mass} = 180\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$. Let the molar mass be $M$. The molar concentration $c$ is defined as the amount of substance $n$ per unit volume $V$, i.e., $c = n/V$. The amount of substance is defined as mass $m$ per molar mass $M$, i.e., $n = m/M$.\n\nCombining these definitions yields an expression for molar concentration in terms of mass, volume, and molar mass:\n$$c = \\frac{n}{V} = \\frac{m/M}{V} = \\frac{m}{V \\cdot M}$$\nThe term $m/V$ is the mass concentration, $C_{mass}$. Thus, the fundamental relationship is $c = C_{mass}/M$. For this equation to hold, the units must be consistent. We are given $C_{mass}$ in $\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$ and $M$ in $\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and we desire $c$ in $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$. We must therefore perform a unit analysis.\n\nWe will establish a general formula to convert $C_{mass}$ in $\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$ to $c$ in $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$. This requires the standard unit prefixes: $1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{dL}$, and $1\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$.\n\nStarting with the value of $C_{mass}$ in $\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$, we convert it to the SI base units for mass and volume, $\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$:\n$$C_{mass} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] = C_{mass} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right] \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}} \\times \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{dL}}{1\\,\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{10}{1000} C_{mass} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] = 0.01 \\cdot C_{mass} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right]$$\nNow, we calculate the molar concentration in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$:\n$$c \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] = \\frac{C_{mass} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right]}{M \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\right]}$$\nFinally, we convert this to $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$:\n$$c \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] = c \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mol}}$$\nCombining these steps, if $C_{mass\\_num}$ is the numerical value of mass concentration in $\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$ and $M_{num}$ is the numerical value of molar mass in $\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, the numerical value of molar concentration $c_{num}$ in $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$ is:\n$$c_{num} = \\left( C_{mass\\_num} \\times \\frac{10}{1000} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{M_{num}} \\times 1000 = \\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass\\_num}}{M_{num}}$$\n\n**First Task: Calculate Concentration $c_{885}$**\nUsing the derived conversion formula with $C_{mass\\_num} = 180$ and $M_{num} = M_1 = 885$:\n$$c_{885} = \\frac{10 \\times 180}{885} = \\frac{1800}{885}$$\n$$c_{885} \\approx 2.0338983...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c_{885} \\approx 2.034$.\n\n**Second Task: Quantify Relative Difference $\\Delta$**\nThe relative difference is defined as $\\Delta = \\frac{|c_{860} - c_{885}|}{c_{885}}$. We use our general conversion formula for $c_{860}$ and $c_{885}$:\n$$c_{860} = \\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass}}{M_2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{885} = \\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass}}{M_1}$$\nwhere $C_{mass}$ is the numerical value $180$, $M_1=885$, and $M_2=860$.\nSubstituting into the definition for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass}}{M_2} - \\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass}}{M_1} \\right|}{\\frac{10 \\cdot C_{mass}}{M_1}}$$\nThe term $10 \\cdot C_{mass}$ cancels, which shows that the relative difference is independent of the measured triglyceride concentration:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{1}{M_2} - \\frac{1}{M_1} \\right|}{\\frac{1}{M_1}} = \\left| M_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{M_2} - \\frac{1}{M_1} \\right) \\right| = \\left| \\frac{M_1}{M_2} - 1 \\right|$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the molar masses $M_1 = 885$ and $M_2 = 860$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left| \\frac{885}{860} - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{885 - 860}{860} \\right| = \\frac{25}{860}$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.029069767...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $\\Delta \\approx 0.02907$.\n\nThe requested values are (i) the concentration $c_{885}$ and (ii) the relative difference $\\Delta$.\n(i) Concentration: $2.034\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n(ii) Relative difference: $0.02907$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.034 & 0.02907 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5239434"}]}
