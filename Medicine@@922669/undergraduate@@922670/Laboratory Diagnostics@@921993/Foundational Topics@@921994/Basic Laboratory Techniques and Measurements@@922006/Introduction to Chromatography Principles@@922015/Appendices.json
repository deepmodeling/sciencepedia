It is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to determine the elution order of toluene, benzoic acid, and aniline in a normal-phase HPLC system. The elution order is the sequence in which analytes exit the column, from the lowest retention time ($t_R$) to the highest. Retention time in normal-phase chromatography is determined by the strength of the analyte's interaction with the polar stationary phase. A stronger interaction leads to a longer retention time.\n\nThe stationary phase is polar silica, with surface silanol groups ($\\text{Si-OH}$), which are described as being weakly acidic. The mobile phase is predominantly nonpolar ($95\\%$ hexane) with a small amount of a polar modifier ($5\\%$ isopropanol).\n\nWe must analyze the interaction of each analyte with the stationary phase.\n\n1.  **Toluene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{CH}_3$):** Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. It is a nonpolar molecule. Its only possible interactions with the polar silica surface are weak London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals interaction). Due to its nonpolar nature, it has a high affinity for the nonpolar mobile phase and a very low affinity for the polar stationary phase. Therefore, toluene will interact the most weakly and will be eluted first, exhibiting the shortest retention time.\n\n2.  **Benzoic Acid ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{COOH}$):** Benzoic acid is a polar molecule containing a carboxylic acid functional group. This group is capable of strong polar interactions. Specifically, it can act as both a hydrogen bond donor (from its acidic proton, $\\text{-O-H}$) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (at its carbonyl oxygen, $\\text{C=O}$, and its hydroxyl oxygen). It can form strong hydrogen bonds with the surface silanol groups ($\\text{Si-OH}$) of the stationary phase. As an acid interacting with a weakly acidic surface, the primary interaction is strong hydrogen bonding, not a strong acid-base reaction.\n\n3.  **Aniline ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{NH}_2$):** Aniline is also a polar molecule, containing a primary amine functional group. This group makes aniline a hydrogen bond donor (via its $\\text{N-H}$ bonds) and, more importantly, a strong hydrogen bond acceptor due to the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. Crucially, aniline is a weak base, while the silica surface is described as weakly acidic. This allows for a specific and very strong acid-base interaction between the basic nitrogen of aniline and the acidic proton of a surface silanol group ($\\text{Si-O-H} \\cdots \\text{NH}_2\\text{-Ph}$). The problem statement explicitly notes that \"acid–base interactions that generate an ionic pair at the surface are typically stronger than mere hydrogen bonding.\" The interaction between the basic aniline and the acidic silanol is stronger than the hydrogen-bonding interactions available to benzoic acid.\n\n**Ranking the Interaction Strengths:**\n\n*   **Toluene:** Weakest interaction (dispersion forces).\n*   **Benzoic Acid:** Strong interaction (hydrogen bonding).\n*   **Aniline:** Strongest interaction (acid-base interaction, which is a particularly strong form of hydrogen bonding, potentially leading to partial or full proton transfer).\n\nThe strength of interaction with the stationary phase thus follows the order:\n$$ \\text{Aniline}  \\text{Benzoic Acid}  \\text{Toluene} $$\n\nSince retention time ($t_R$) is directly proportional to the interaction strength, the retention times are ordered as:\n$$ t_R(\\text{Aniline})  t_R(\\text{Benzoic Acid})  t_R(\\text{Toluene}) $$\n\nThe elution order is the sequence from the smallest $t_R$ to the largest $t_R$. Therefore, the predicted elution order is:\n$$ \\text{Toluene}  \\text{Benzoic Acid}  \\text{Aniline} $$\n\n**3. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Toluene  Benzoic acid  Aniline**\n    *   This option correctly identifies toluene as the first to elute due to its nonpolar nature and weak interactions. It correctly places aniline last, recognizing that the basic aniline interacts more strongly with the acidic silica surface than the acidic benzoic acid does. This aligns perfectly with the derived elution order.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Toluene  Aniline  Benzoic acid**\n    *   This option correctly identifies toluene as eluting first. However, it incorrectly posits that benzoic acid is retained more strongly than aniline. This contradicts the principle that the specific acid-base interaction of basic aniline with the acidic stationary phase is stronger than the hydrogen-bonding interactions of acidic benzoic acid with the same surface.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Benzoic acid  Toluene  Aniline**\n    *   This option incorrectly places toluene, the nonpolar analyte, between the two polar analytes. In normal-phase chromatography, the least polar compound has the weakest interaction and is always eluted first.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Aniline  Benzoic acid  Toluene**\n    *   This option presents the reverse of the correct retention order. It implies that the analyte with the strongest interaction (aniline) elutes first, and the one with the weakest interaction (toluene) elutes last. This would be characteristic of reversed-phase chromatography, not the normal-phase system described in the problem.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5226456"}, {"introduction": "While predicting elution order is essential, quantifying the quality of a separation is what transforms chromatography from an art into a science.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Resolution Equation\n\nThe resolution, $R_s$, between two chromatographic peaks is fundamentally defined as the difference in their retention times, $t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}$, normalized by the average of their baseline peak widths, $W_1$ and $W_2$. Assuming Gaussian peak shapes:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{\\frac{1}{2}(W_1 + W_2)} $$\nFor closely eluting peaks, it is a common and acceptable approximation to assume their widths are nearly equal, $W_1 \\approx W_2 \\approx W$. Specifically, we use the width of the later, broader peak, $W = W_2$, for a conservative estimate of resolution. The definition simplifies to:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{W_2} $$\nThe number of theoretical plates, $N$, is a measure of column efficiency and is related to the retention time $t_R$ and the peak width at its base $W$ by the expression:\n$$ N = 16 \\left( \\frac{t_R}{W} \\right)^2 $$\nApplying this definition to the second (later-eluting) analyte, we can express its peak width $W_2$ in terms of its retention time $t_{R,2}$ and the plate number $N$:\n$$ W_2 = \\frac{4 t_{R,2}}{\\sqrt{N}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $W_2$ into the simplified resolution equation yields:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{\\frac{4 t_{R,2}}{\\sqrt{N}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left( \\frac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{t_{R,2}} \\right) $$\nThe retention time $t_R$ of an analyte is related to the column's dead time $t_M$ (the time for an unretained species to pass through) and the analyte's retention factor $k'$ (also known as the capacity factor) by:\n$$ t_R = t_M(1 + k') $$\nWe apply this relationship to both analytes, denoting their retention factors as $k'_1$ and $k'_2$:\n$$ t_{R,1} = t_M(1 + k'_1) $$\n$$ t_{R,2} = t_M(1 + k'_2) $$\nSubstituting these into the resolution expression gives:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left( \\frac{t_M(1 + k'_2) - t_M(1 + k'_1)}{t_M(1 + k'_2)} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left( \\frac{k'_2 - k'_1}{1 + k'_2} \\right) $$\nThe selectivity factor, $\\alpha$, is defined as the ratio of the retention factors of the two analytes, with the larger retention factor in the numerator, such that $\\alpha \\ge 1$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k'_2}{k'_1} $$\nFrom this, we can express $k'_1$ in terms of $k'_2$ and $\\alpha$: $k'_1 = \\frac{k'_2}{\\alpha}$. Substituting this into the equation for $R_s$:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left( \\frac{k'_2 - \\frac{k'_2}{\\alpha}}{1 + k'_2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left( \\frac{k'_2 (1 - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})}{1 + k'_2} \\right) $$\nBy finding a common denominator for the term $(1 - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})$, we get $\\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha}$. This leads to the final analytic expression, known as the Purnell equation or master resolution equation. As the problem gives the retention factor for the later-eluting analyte, we replace $k'_2$ with the given symbol $k'$:\n$$ R_s = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k'}{1 + k'}\\right) $$\nThis expression connects resolution to the three key factors controlling it: column efficiency ($N$), selectivity ($\\alpha$), and retention ($k'$).\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $N = 10,000$\n- $\\alpha = 1.20$\n- $k' = 2.0$ (for the later-eluting analyte)\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $R_s$:\n$$ R_s = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10,000}}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1.20 - 1}{1.20}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2.0}{1 + 2.0}\\right) $$\nLet's evaluate each term separately:\n- The efficiency term: $\\frac{\\sqrt{10,000}}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25$\n- The selectivity term: $\\frac{1.20 - 1}{1.20} = \\frac{0.20}{1.20} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n- The retention term: $\\frac{2.0}{1 + 2.0} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nMultiplying these terms together gives the resolution:\n$$ R_s = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{50}{18} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.777... $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$ R_s \\approx 2.78 $$\n\n### Assessment of Separation\nThe criterion for baseline separation is given as $R_s \\ge 1.5$.

The assumption of rapid interconversion relative to the chromatographic timescale is critical.
