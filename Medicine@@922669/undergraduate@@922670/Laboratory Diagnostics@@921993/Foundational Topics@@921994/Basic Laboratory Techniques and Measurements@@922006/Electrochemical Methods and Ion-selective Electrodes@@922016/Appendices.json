The values and conditions are standard for clinical chemistry.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides two calibration points, sufficient to determine the two parameters (slope and intercept) of a linear response model. It then provides the necessary information to calculate the unknown pH. The problem is self-contained and structured to yield a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language.\n- **Consistency Check:** The Nernst equation for a cation-selective electrode predicts that potential *decreases* as concentration decreases (i.e., pH increases).

While this is contrary to the standard theoretical convention for raw electrode potential, it is a common convention for the processed output of clinical analyzers. The problem refers to what \"the instrument records,\" which can include such signal processing. Crucially, the magnitude of the empirical slope is physically realistic and the data is internally consistent. The problem remains solvable by using the calibration data to define the instrument's specific response function.\n\n**1.3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is **valid**. Although the sign of the slope is unconventional from a purely theoretical standpoint, it is plausible for an instrument's reported potential and is internally consistent within the provided dataset. We proceed to solve the problem based on the given instrumental response.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe potential $E$ of an ion-selective electrode system is typically a linear function of the logarithm of the analyte's activity, which for hydrogen ions is expressed as $\\mathrm{pH}$. The general form of this relationship is:\n$$E = E_0 \\pm S(T) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}$$\nwhere $E_0$ is a constant potential term incorporating the reference electrode and liquid junction potentials, and $S(T)$ is the temperature-dependent slope of the electrode response.\n\nFrom the calibration data, the measured potential $E$ increases as the $\\mathrm{pH}$ increases. Therefore, the specific response function for this instrument is of the form:\n$$E = E_0 + S(T) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}$$\nThe problem states that any temperature dependence is solely through the term $S(T)$, which implies that $E_0$ is temperature-independent. The term $S(T)$ is assumed to follow the ideal Nernstian temperature dependence, meaning it is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the parameters $E_0$ and the slope at the calibration temperature, $S_{\\mathrm{cal}}$, using the provided two-point calibration data at $T_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe slope, $S_{\\mathrm{cal}}$, is determined from the two calibration points $(\\mathrm{pH}_1, E_1)$ and $(\\mathrm{pH}_2, E_2)$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{cal}} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}} = \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{\\mathrm{pH}_2 - \\mathrm{pH}_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{cal}} = \\frac{426.190\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 248.680\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{7.000 - 4.000} = \\frac{177.510\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{3.000} = 59.170\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThis value represents the instrument's response slope at $T_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nNext, we determine the temperature-independent intercept, $E_0$, by rearranging the response equation and using one of the calibration points (e.g., point 1):\n$$E_0 = E_1 - S_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}_1$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$E_0 = 248.680\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (59.170\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot (4.000) = 248.680\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 236.680\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 12.000\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nWe can verify this with point 2: $E_0 = 426.190\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (59.170\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot (7.000) = 426.190\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 414.190\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 12.000\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The intercept is consistent.\n\nThe instrument's general response function is thus established as $E(T) = E_0 + S(T) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}$. The slope $S(T)$ scales linearly with absolute temperature from the calibration point:\n$$S(T) = S_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\left( \\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{cal}}} \\right)$$\nThe patient sample is measured at $T_{\\mathrm{s}} = 37.0\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = 310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$. We must calculate the slope $S_{\\mathrm{s}}$ at this temperature:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{s}} = S_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{s}}}{T_{\\mathrm{cal}}} \\right) = (59.170\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}}{298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\right)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{s}} \\approx (59.170) \\cdot (1.040248) \\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx 61.5534\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH of the patient sample, $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{s}}$, by rearranging the response equation and substituting the sample potential $E_{\\mathrm{s}} = 440.300\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the intercept $E_0$, and the corrected slope $S_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{s}} - E_0}{S_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{440.300\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 12.000\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{61.5534\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{428.300}{61.5534}$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 6.95821$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThus, $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{s}} = 6.958$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.958}$$", "id": "5220880"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, an ISE would only respond to its target ion, but in reality, other ions can interfere with the measurement.

The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\n\nThe potential, $E$, of an ideal ISE responsive to a primary ion $i$ with charge $z_i$ and activity $a_i$ is described by the Nernst equation:\n$$E = E_{\\text{const}} + S \\ln(a_i)$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{const}}$ is a term encompassing constant potentials (e.g., reference electrode potential, junction potentials), and $S$ is the Nernstian slope, given by $S = \\frac{RT}{z_i F}$. Here, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nFor the potassium ion, $\\mathrm{K^+}$, the charge is $z_{\\mathrm{K}}=+1$. If the electrode were calibrated using only standard solutions of $\\mathrm{K^+}$, the measured potential would be assumed to follow this simple relationship.

The problem states that for monovalent ions, the selectivity coefficient acts as a linear multiplicative weight on the interfering ion's activity. For a primary ion $\\mathrm{K^+}$ and interfering ions $\\mathrm{j}$, the equation is:\n$$E_{\\text{meas}} = E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{K}} F} \\ln \\left( a_{\\mathrm{K^+}} + \\sum_{j} K_{\\mathrm{K,j}} (a_j)^{z_{\\mathrm{K}}/z_j} \\right)$$\nIn this specific problem, the primary ion is $\\mathrm{K^+}$ and the interfering ions are $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$.

Therefore, we set the two expressions for $E_{\\text{meas}}$ equal:\n$$E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K^+},\\mathrm{app}}) = E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( a_{\\mathrm{K^+}} + K_{\\mathrm{K,Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} + K_{\\mathrm{K,NH_4}} a_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} \\right)$$\n\nBy canceling the $E_{\\text{const}}$ term and the pre-logarithmic factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$ from both sides of the equation, we are left with the arguments of the natural logarithm being equal.
