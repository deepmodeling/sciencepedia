The solution strategy involves three main steps:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of the weak acid ($\\text{HA}$) and its conjugate base ($\\text{A}^-$) in the buffer mixture.\n2.  Determine the stoichiometric effect of adding hydrochloric acid ($\\text{HCl}$) on the moles of $\\text{HA}$ and $\\text{A}^-$.\n3.  Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the new molar quantities of $\\text{HA}$ and $\\text{A}^-$ to find the final $\\text{pH}$.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Moles of Buffer Components**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles ($n$) of acetic acid ($\\text{HA}$) and acetate ($\\text{A}^-$) initially mixed. Sodium acetate ($\\text{NaA}$) is a salt that fully dissociates in solution, providing the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid.\n\nMoles of acetic acid, $n_{\\text{HA}}$:\n$$n_{\\text{HA}} = [\\text{HA}]_{\\text{initial}} \\times V_{\\text{HA}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{HA}} = (0.250\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (0.0800\\ \\mathrm{L}) = 0.0200\\ \\text{mol}$$\n\nMoles of acetate from sodium acetate, $n_{\\text{A}^-}$:\n$$n_{\\text{A}^-} = [\\text{NaA}]_{\\text{initial}} \\times V_{\\text{NaA}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{A}^-} = (0.200\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (0.1200\\ \\mathrm{L}) = 0.0240\\ \\text{mol}$$\n\nThese initial amounts are present in the $1.000\\ \\text{L}$ buffer before the $\\text{HCl}$ is added.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with Added Strong Acid**\nNext, $5.00\\ \\text{mL}$ of $0.100\\ \\mathrm{M}\\ \\text{HCl}$ is added. $\\text{HCl}$ is a strong acid and dissociates completely to provide hydronium ions ($\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$, which we will denote as $\\text{H}^+$ for simplicity).\n\nMoles of $\\text{H}^+$ added, $n_{\\text{H}^+}$:\n$$n_{\\text{H}^+} = [\\text{HCl}] \\times V_{\\text{HCl}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{H}^+} = (0.100\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (0.00500\\ \\mathrm{L}) = 0.000500\\ \\text{mol}$$\n\nThe added strong acid ($\\text{H}^+$) will react quantitatively with the conjugate base ($\\text{A}^-$) present in the buffer to form the weak acid ($\\text{HA}$), according to the neutralization reaction:\n$$\\text{A}^- (aq) + \\text{H}^+ (aq) \\longrightarrow \\text{HA} (aq)$$\n\nThis reaction goes essentially to completion. We update the moles of $\\text{A}^-$ and $\\text{HA}$:\nNew moles of acetate, $n'_{\\text{A}^-}$:\n$$n'_{\\text{A}^-} = n_{\\text{A}^-} - n_{\\text{H}^+} = 0.0240\\ \\text{mol} - 0.000500\\ \\text{mol} = 0.0235\\ \\text{mol}$$\n\nNew moles of acetic acid, $n'_{\\text{HA}}$:\n$$n'_{\\text{HA}} = n_{\\text{HA}} + n_{\\text{H}^+} = 0.0200\\ \\text{mol} + 0.000500\\ \\text{mol} = 0.0205\\ \\text{mol}$$\n\nThese are the final stoichiometric amounts of the conjugate base and weak acid in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Final pH Calculation**\nThe $\\text{pH}$ of the final buffer solution is determined by the equilibrium of the weak acid:\n$$\\text{HA} (aq) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ (aq) + \\text{A}^- (aq)$$\nThe equilibrium expression is given by the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}$$\nSolving for $[\\text{H}^+]$ and taking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides yields the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\text{p}K_a$:\n$$\\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(1.75 \\times 10^{-5})$$\n$$\\text{p}K_a \\approx 4.75696$$\n\nThe concentrations $[\\text{A}^-]$ and $[\\text{HA}]$ are the molar amounts divided by the total final volume. The total final volume, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the volume of the diluted buffer plus the volume of added $\\text{HCl}$:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 1.000\\ \\text{L} + 0.00500\\ \\text{L} = 1.005\\ \\text{L}$$\nSo, $[\\text{A}^-] = \\frac{n'_{\\text{A}^-}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$ and $[\\text{HA}] = \\frac{n'_{\\text{HA}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{n'_{\\text{A}^-}/V_{\\text{total}}}{n'_{\\text{HA}}/V_{\\text{total}}}\\right)$$\nThe volume term $V_{\\text{total}}$ cancels out, allowing us to use the ratio of moles directly:\n$$\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{n'_{\\text{A}^-}}{n'_{\\text{HA}}}\\right)$$\nThis is a standard feature of buffer calculations and simplifies the process. Now we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\\text{pH} = 4.75696 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.0235}{0.0205}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{pH} = 4.75696 + \\log_{10}(1.14634...)$$\n$$\\text{pH} = 4.75696 + 0.05931...$$\n$$\\text{pH} \\approx 4.81627$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{pH} = 4.816$$\n\nThis result is chemically reasonable. The initial buffer had a higher concentration of base than acid (molar ratio $0.0240 / 0.0200 = 1.2$), so its $\\text{pH}$ would be slightly above the $\\text{p}K_a$ ($4.757$). The addition of a strong acid lowered the $\\text{pH}$, but only slightly, demonstrating the buffering capacity of the solution. The final ratio of base to acid is $0.0235 / 0.0205 \\approx 1.15$, still greater than $1$, so the final $\\text{pH}$ of $4.816$ remains slightly above the $\\text{p}K_a$, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.816}$$", "id": "5233114"}, {"introduction": "Moving from buffer preparation to analysis, this practice explores the bicarbonate buffer system, which is paramount for maintaining physiological pH.

The problem is solvable.\n\nThe titration of a sample containing carbonate ($\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$) and bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid ($\\mathrm{HCl}$) involves two sequential neutralization reactions, which correspond to the two endpoints observed.\n\nLet $n_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}}$ be the initial moles of carbonate ions and $n_{\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$ be the initial moles of bicarbonate ions in the sample volume $V_{s}$.
