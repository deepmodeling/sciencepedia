The request to calculate an \"anti-Stokes shift\" for a process where the emission wavelength is longer than the excitation wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}$) is not a flaw; it is a test of applying a formal definition. The result of such a calculation will be negative, correctly indicating that the process is in fact a Stokes-shifted one, involving a net loss of energy. All necessary data are provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be provided.\n\nConceptual Definitions of Stokes and Anti-Stokes Shifts\nFluorescence is a photophysical process wherein a molecule absorbs a photon, promoting it from its ground electronic state (typically a singlet state, $S_0$) to an excited electronic state ($S_1$, $S_2$, etc.). This absorption is very rapid, on the order of femtoseconds ($10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{s}$).\n\nAccording to Kasha's rule, a molecule in a higher excited electronic state ($S_2$, $S_3$, etc.) typically undergoes rapid, non-radiative internal conversion to the lowest excited singlet state, $S_1$. Furthermore, upon arrival in any excited electronic state, the molecule is often in a higher vibrational energy level. It then rapidly loses this excess vibrational energy to the surrounding solvent medium as heat, a process known as vibrational relaxation. This non-radiative relaxation to the lowest vibrational level of the $S_1$ state is extremely fast, typically occurring on a picosecond ($10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}$) timescale.\n\nFluorescence emission is the radiative transition from this relaxed, lowest vibrational level of the first excited singlet state ($S_1, v=0$) back to one of the vibrational levels of the ground electronic state ($S_0, v=n$).\n\nThe Stokes shift is the resulting difference in energy between the absorbed and emitted photons. Because energy is lost non-radiatively through vibrational relaxation prior to emission, the emitted photon almost invariably has less energy ($E_{\\mathrm{em}}$) than the absorbed photon ($E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$). Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength ($\\lambda$), this corresponds to an emission spectrum that is red-shifted (at longer wavelengths) relative to the absorption spectrum. Thus, for a Stokes shift, $E_{\\mathrm{em}}  E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}$.\n\nThe anti-Stokes shift describes the much less common phenomenon where the emitted photon has a higher energy than the absorbed photon ($E_{\\mathrm{em}}  E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$), leading to emission at a shorter wavelength than absorption ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}$). This can occur if the initial absorption event originates from a thermally populated, higher vibrational level ($v0$) of the ground electronic state $S_0$. The molecule absorbs additional thermal energy from its surroundings to populate this state before excitation. After excitation and subsequent vibrational relaxation to the $S_1, v=0$ level, the emitted photon's energy is the sum of the absorbed photon's energy and the initial thermal energy.\n\nDerivation of Expressions in Wavenumbers\nThe energy $E$ of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\nu$ is the frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nWavenumber, denoted by $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is defined as the reciprocal of wavelength, $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. It is a unit of frequency, expressed typically in reciprocal centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), and is directly proportional to the photon's energy:\n$$E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$$\nThe wavenumber of absorbed light is $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}}$, and for emitted light is $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}}$.\n\nThe Stokes shift, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}}$, is the reduction in energy from absorption to emission, expressed in wavenumbers. It is conventionally defined as a positive quantity:\n$$\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{abs}} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}}$$\nSince $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ for a Stokes shift, $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}}  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}}$, ensuring $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}}  0$.\n\nThe anti-Stokes shift, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{anti-Stokes}}$, is the increase in energy from absorption to emission. To also define this as a positive quantity for a true anti-Stokes process, the terms are reversed:\n$$\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{em}} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}}$$\nFor a true anti-Stokes process, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, so $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}}  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}}$, ensuring $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{anti-Stokes}}  0$.\n\nComputations\nThe wavelengths must be converted to centimeters for the calculation. The conversion factor is $1\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\n(i) Stokes shift between the absorption maximum and the emission maximum.\nWe use $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\max} = 320\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 320 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}^{\\max} = 500\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\nUsing the derived expression for the Stokes shift:\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}} = \\frac{1}{320 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{1}{500 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{320} - \\frac{1}{500}\\right) \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}} = (0.003125 - 0.002) \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{Stokes}} = 0.001125 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 11250\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Stokes shift is $11300\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is best expressed as $1.13 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n(ii) Anti-Stokes shift for excitation at the blue-shifted shoulder and emission at the maximum.\nWe use $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\mathrm{shoulder}} = 310\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 310 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{em}}^{\\max} = 500\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\nWe apply the formal definition for the anti-Stokes shift.

At the excitation wavelength, this is given by:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l$$\nThe problem specifies that to maintain a linear response and minimize inner-filter effects, the excitation absorbance must satisfy the condition $A_{\\mathrm{ex}}  0.05$.

The calculated value is $2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{M}$, which is already in the desired format.\n\nPart 2: Justification of the Linear Response Regime\n\nThe fluorescence intensity, $F$, is directly proportional to the rate at which excitation photons are absorbed by the analyte. This rate is proportional to the intensity of absorbed light, $I_{\\mathrm{abs}}$. Given an incident intensity $I_0$ and a transmitted intensity $I$, the absorbed intensity is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{abs}} = I_0 - I$$\nFluorescence intensity can be expressed as $F = k I_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, where $k$ is a constant incorporating the fluorescence quantum yield and instrumental factors. Thus:\n$$F = k (I_0 - I) = k I_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)$$\nThe term $1 - I/I_0$ represents the fraction of incident light that is absorbed by the sample.\n\nFrom the definition of absorbance, $A_{\\mathrm{ex}} = -\\log_{10}(I/I_0)$, we can express the transmission ratio $I/I_0$ as:\n$$\\frac{I}{I_0} = 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for fluorescence intensity gives the exact relationship:\n$$F = k I_0 (1 - 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}})$$\nUsing the Beer-Lambert law, $A_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l$, we have:\n$$F = k I_0 (1 - 10^{-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l})$$\nFor the assay to be in the linear response regime, the fluorescence intensity $F$ must be directly proportional to the analyte concentration $c$. This requires the term $(1 - 10^{-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l})$ to be approximately a linear function of $c$.\n\nTo justify this, we analyze the function for small values of absorbance. We use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential term. First, we convert the base from $10$ to $e$:\n$$10^{-x} = \\exp(\\ln(10^{-x})) = \\exp(-x \\ln(10))$$\nThe Taylor series expansion of $\\exp(u)$ around $u=0$ is $1 + u + \\frac{u^2}{2!} + \\frac{u^3}{3!} + \\dots$. Let $x = A_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The expansion for $10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}}$ is:\n$$10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}} = 1 - A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10) + \\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10))^2}{2} - \\dots$$\nSubstituting this series into the expression for the fraction of absorbed light $(1 - 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}})$:\n$$1 - 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}} \\approx 1 - \\left(1 - A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10) + \\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10))^2}{2}\\right) = A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10) - \\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10))^2}{2} + \\dots$$\nFor small $A_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, we can neglect the second-order and higher terms, leading to the small-absorbance approximation:\n$$1 - 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{ex}}} \\approx A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10)$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation for fluorescence intensity:\n$$F \\approx k I_0 (A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10))$$\nNow, replacing $A_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l$ from the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$F \\approx k I_0 (\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} c l \\ln(10)) = (k I_0 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} l \\ln(10)) c$$\nSince all terms within the parentheses are constants for a given experiment, this demonstrates a direct proportionality between fluorescence intensity $F$ and concentration $c$ ($F \\propto c$), which is the definition of the linear response regime.\n\nThe validity of this linear approximation depends on the magnitude of the neglected higher-order terms. The ratio of the magnitude of the second-order term to the first-order term provides a measure of the deviation from linearity:\n$$\\text{Relative deviation} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10))^2}{2}}{A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10)} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ln(10)}{2}$$\nAt the maximum allowed absorbance, $A_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 0.05$, the deviation is approximately:\n$$\\frac{0.05 \\times \\ln(10)}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.05 \\times 2.3026}{2} \\approx 0.0576$$\nThis indicates a deviation from linearity of less than $6\\%$.
