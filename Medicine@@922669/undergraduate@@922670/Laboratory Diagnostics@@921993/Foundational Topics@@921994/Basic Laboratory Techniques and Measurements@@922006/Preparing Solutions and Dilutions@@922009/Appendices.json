The procedure requires diluting a stock solution of 1.250 M HCl. The student accurately transfers a 10.00 mL aliquot of the stock solution using a Class A volumetric pipet (with a stated tolerance of ±0.02 mL). However, instead of using the prescribed 100.00 mL Class A volumetric flask (tolerance ±0.08 mL), the student uses a 100 mL graduated cylinder (tolerance ±1 mL) for the dilution, adding deionized water up to the 100 mL mark.\n\nAssuming the student performs all other steps, such as reading the meniscus, perfectly, which of the following statements best describes the primary type of measurement error introduced into the final concentration of the prepared solution due to the use of the graduated cylinder?\n\nA. A random error is introduced, because repeated dilutions using the graduated cylinder would result in concentrations that are scattered symmetrically around the intended value.\nB. A gross error, or blunder, is introduced, which is so significant that the resulting solution is completely invalid for any quantitative purpose.\nC. A systematic error is introduced, because the inherent inaccuracy of the graduated cylinder's volume markings creates a consistent, reproducible bias in the final concentration value away from the true value.\nD. No significant error is introduced, as the precision of the Class A volumetric pipet compensates for the imprecision of the graduated cylinder.", "solution": "We denote the stock concentration by $C_{i}$, the nominal pipetted volume by $V_{i,\\text{nom}}$, and the nominal final volume by $V_{f,\\text{nom}}$.

If a Class A volumetric flask is used, $|\\delta V_{f}|$ is very small. If a graduated cylinder is used instead, $|\\delta V_{f}|$ can be much larger due to its much poorer tolerance.\n\nThe problem stipulates that the student performs all reading steps perfectly. This removes random reading fluctuations as a dominant source of error. Under this condition, the principal contribution from the graduated cylinder is its calibration offset at the fill mark, which is an instrument-dependent bias $\\delta V_{f}$ that is reproducible across repeated preparations with the same cylinder. Consequently, the error term $-\\delta V_{f}/V_{f,\\text{nom}}$ introduces a consistent shift of $C_{f}$ away from the true value in the same direction every time, i.e., a systematic error. It is neither a gross blunder (the solution remains usable, albeit less accurate) nor is it compensated by the accurate pipet, since $C_{f}$ depends on both $V_{i}$ and $V_{f}$.\n\nTherefore, the primary error introduced by using the graduated cylinder in place of a Class A volumetric flask, given perfect technique otherwise, is a systematic error due to the cylinder’s inherent calibration bias at the final volume mark.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1461064"}, {"introduction": "A frequent task in any clinical or research lab is preparing a working solution from a highly concentrated commercial stock.

Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the molarity of the glacial acetic acid stock solution and the volume of this stock required to prepare a specific buffer. We will solve this in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: Molarity of the Glacial Acetic Acid Stock Solution**\n\nMolarity ($M$) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.\n$$M = \\frac{\\text{moles of solute}}{\\text{liters of solution}}$$\nThe problem provides the properties of the stock solution: a density of $\\rho = 1.049\\,\\text{g/mL}$, a weight-to-weight (w/w) percentage of $99.8\\%$, and the molar mass of acetic acid ($\\mathrm{HA}$, where $\\mathrm{HA} = \\mathrm{CH_3COOH}$) as $M_{\\mathrm{HA}} = 60.052\\,\\text{g/mol}$.\n\nLet's consider a volume of $V_{\\text{sol}} = 1\\,\\text{L} = 1000\\,\\text{mL}$ of the stock solution.\nThe mass of this solution, $m_{\\text{sol}}$, can be calculated using its density:\n$$m_{\\text{sol}} = \\rho \\times V_{\\text{sol}} = (1.049\\,\\text{g/mL}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{mL}) = 1049\\,\\text{g}$$\nThe mass fraction of acetic acid, $w_{\\mathrm{HA}}$, is given as $99.8\\%$, which is $0.998$ as a dimensionless ratio. The mass of pure acetic acid, $m_{\\mathrm{HA}}$, in this solution is:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{HA}} = m_{\\text{sol}} \\times w_{\\mathrm{HA}} = 1049\\,\\text{g} \\times 0.998 = 1046.902\\,\\text{g}$$\nThe number of moles of acetic acid, $n_{\\mathrm{HA}}$, is found by dividing its mass by its molar mass:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{HA}}}{M_{\\mathrm{HA}}} = \\frac{1046.902\\,\\text{g}}{60.052\\,\\text{g/mol}} = 17.4332...\\,\\text{mol}$$\nSince this is the number of moles in $1\\,\\text{L}$ of solution, the molarity of the stock solution, $M_{\\text{stock}}$, is $17.4332...\\,\\text{mol/L}$.\n\nCombining these steps into a single formula for molarity $M_{\\text{stock}}$:\n$$M_{\\text{stock}} = \\frac{\\rho \\times w_{\\mathrm{HA}} \\times 1000\\,\\text{mL/L}}{M_{\\mathrm{HA}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{\\text{stock}} = \\frac{(1.049\\,\\text{g/mL}) \\times (0.998) \\times (1000\\,\\text{mL/L})}{60.052\\,\\text{g/mol}} \\approx 17.436\\,\\text{mol/L}$$\nThe slight difference from the step-by-step calculation is due to rounding in the intermediate steps. The single-formula calculation is more precise.

The analysis will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we address the feasibility of a single-step dilution to achieve a factor of $D = 10^6$. A single dilution step is defined by the relation $D = V_{\\text{total}}/V_{\\text{sample}}$, where $V_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{sample}} + V_{\\text{diluent}}$. The problem specifies two critical constraints: the total volume cannot exceed the tube capacity, $V_{\\text{total}} \\le 2.0\\,\\text{mL} = 2000\\,\\mu\\text{L}$, and the volume of any single dispense, including the sample transfer, must be within the pipette's usable range of $10\\,\\mu\\text{L}$ to $1000\\,\\mu\\text{L}$. To achieve the highest possible dilution factor, one must maximize the total volume and minimize the sample volume. The maximum total volume is $V_{\\text{total, max}} = 2000\\,\\mu\\text{L}$. The minimum sample volume is $V_{\\text{sample, min}} = 10\\,\\mu\\text{L}$.

To achieve $D = 10^6$ within a $V_{\\text{total}} \\le 2000\\,\\mu\\text{L}$, the required sample volume would be $V_{\\text{sample}} = V_{\\text{total}}/D \\le 2000\\,\\mu\\text{L} / 10^6 = 0.002\\,\\mu\\text{L}$, which is far below the pipette's minimum delivery volume of $10\\,\\mu\\text{L}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the uncertainty for the two multi-step protocols.
