The dominant error source for the cylinder is its large Class B calibration tolerance, not the reading resolution. The drainage ($b_{drain} = -0.10\\,\\text{mL}$) and parallax ($b_{parallax,V} \\approx +0.15\\,\\text{mL}$) do not cancel to a negligible value; the net bias is $+0.05\\,\\text{mL}$, which is double the flask's bias.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.

The flask's narrow neck *reduces* the volume error from a given height error. Our calculation showed the flask's parallax bias is only $+0.024\\,\\text{mL}$. The value of $\\approx+0.15\\,\\text{mL}$ is the parallax bias for the *cylinder* with its *wide* bore. A wide bore amplifies, not mitigates, volume errors from meniscus height errors.

For a narrow tube of radius $r$, the capillary rise is given by Jurin's Law:\n$$h = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension, $\\theta$ is the contact angle, $\\rho$ is the liquid density, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. A larger value of $h$ corresponds to a more curved, more concave meniscus. The factor determining this curvature is the product $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n\nWe must compare this factor for the clean condition (subscript $0$) and the contaminated condition (subscript $1$).\n\n*   Clean condition:\n    $$\\gamma_0 \\cos\\theta_0 = (0.072\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\cos(20^\\circ) \\approx (0.072)(0.9397) \\approx 0.06766\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\n*   Contaminated condition:\n    $$\\gamma_1 \\cos\\theta_1 = (0.050\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\cos(5^\\circ) \\approx (0.050)(0.9962) \\approx 0.04981\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\n\nSince $\\gamma_1 \\cos\\theta_1 < \\gamma_0 \\cos\\theta_0$, the capillary rise is reduced in the presence of the surfactant. A smaller capillary rise results in a **flatter, less concave meniscus**.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Delivered Volume Bias**\n\nA \"to deliver\" (TD) burette is calibrated to account for the volume of liquid that remains on the wetted inner wall after delivery, which is the drainage film. The calibration is performed for the clean condition, where the film has a thickness $t_0$.\n\nThe bias in delivered volume arises because the actual film thickness under contaminated conditions, $t_1$, is different from the calibrated film thickness, $t_0$.\n\nThe total volume that passes the burette's final graduation mark is $V_{nom} = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The volume actually delivered, $V_{del}$, is this nominal volume minus the volume retained on the wall, $V_{ret}$.\n$$V_{del} = V_{nom} - V_{ret}$$\nThe burette is calibrated assuming a retained volume of $V_{ret,0} = A_{wetted} \\cdot t_0$. The intended delivered volume is thus $V_{intended} = V_{nom} - V_{ret,0}$.\nUnder contaminated conditions, the actual retained volume is $V_{ret,1} = A_{wetted} \\cdot t_1$. The actual delivered volume is $V_{actual} = V_{nom} - V_{ret,1}$.\n\nThe bias is the error, defined as the actual delivered volume minus the intended delivered volume:\n$$\\text{Bias} = V_{actual} - V_{intended} = (V_{nom} - V_{ret,1}) - (V_{nom} - V_{ret,0}) = V_{ret,0} - V_{ret,1}$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = A_{wetted}(t_0 - t_1)$$\nSince $t_1 > t_0$ ($7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} > 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), the bias will be **negative**. This means more liquid is retained on the wall than accounted for, so less liquid is delivered than intended.\n\nTo calculate the magnitude of the bias, we first find the wetted surface area, $A_{wetted}$. The volume of a cylindrical segment of the burette is $V = \\pi r^2 L$, where $L$ is the length. The lateral surface area of this segment is $A_{wetted} = 2 \\pi r L$. We can relate $A_{wetted}$ to the dispensed volume $V_{nom}$:\n$$L = \\frac{V_{nom}}{\\pi r^2} \\implies A_{wetted} = 2 \\pi r \\left( \\frac{V_{nom}}{\\pi r^2} \\right) = \\frac{2V_{nom}}{r}$$\nFirst, we convert units to be consistent (SI units):\n*   $V_{nom} = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3 = 10.00 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 = 1.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$\n*   $r = 3.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n*   $t_0 = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n*   $t_1 = 7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 7 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nNow, we calculate the bias:\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\frac{2V_{nom}}{r} (t_0 - t_1) = \\frac{2 \\times (1.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3)}{3.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}} (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} - 7 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\left( \\frac{2.000 \\times 10^{-5}}{3.25 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\right) (-5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$\\text{Bias} \\approx (6.1538 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (-5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\approx -3.077 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$$\nTo convert the bias to milliliters ($1\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$):\n$$\\text{Bias} \\approx (-3.077 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3) \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3} \\right) = -0.03077\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding to two significant figures consistent with the options, the bias is approximately $-0.031\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Trace surfactant lowers $\\theta$ and $\\gamma$, producing a flatter, less concave meniscus and a negative delivered-volume bias of approximately $-0.031\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ for the $10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ TD delivery.**\n    *   The problem states $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$ are lowered. This is correct.\n    *   Our analysis confirms the meniscus becomes flatter and less concave. This is correct.\n    *   Our analysis confirms the bias is negative. This is correct.\n    *   Our calculation yields a bias of approximately $-0.031\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. This is correct.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Trace surfactant raises $\\theta$ and makes the meniscus more convex, yielding a positive delivered-volume bias of about $+0.031\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ for the $10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ TD delivery.**\n    *   The surfactant lowers $\\theta$, it does not raise it ($\\theta_1 = 5^\\circ < \\theta_0 = 20^\\circ$). The statement is factually wrong.\n    *   An acute contact angle ($\\theta_1=5^\\circ$) produces a concave meniscus, not a convex one. This is incorrect.\n    *   The bias is negative, not positive. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Trace surfactant lowers $\\gamma$ but increases capillary rise, making the meniscus more concave, and causes a negative delivered-volume bias of roughly $-0.15\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ for the $10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ TD delivery.**\n    *   It lowers $\\gamma$, which is correct. However, it claims this increases capillary rise. Our analysis of $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$ showed the capillary rise decreases. This is incorrect.\n    *   Consequently, the meniscus becomes flatter (less concave), not more concave. This is incorrect.\n    *   The magnitude of the bias, $-0.15\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, is inconsistent with our calculation of $-0.031\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The changes in $\\theta$ and $\\gamma$ cancel, so meniscus shape and delivered volume remain effectively unchanged for the $10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ TD delivery.**\n    *   The change in $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$ is significant ($\\approx 26\\%$ decrease), so the meniscus shape changes.\n    *   The change in film thickness from $t_0=2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $t_1=7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is a $250\\%$ increase, which directly causes a non-negligible volume bias. There is no cancellation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5239319"}]}
