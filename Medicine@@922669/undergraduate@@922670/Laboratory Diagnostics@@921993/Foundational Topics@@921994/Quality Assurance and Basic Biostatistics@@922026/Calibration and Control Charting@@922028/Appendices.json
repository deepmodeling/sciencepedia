The specified regression methods are standard techniques for this purpose. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data (measurements, error magnitudes) to perform the analysis. The assumptions given (Gaussian errors, constant variance) are common and allow for a specific, well-defined analytical approach. The data are numerically and physically consistent. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and is well-posed. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested: selection of the regression method and calculation of the bias.\n\n**Part 1: Selection and Justification of Regression Method**\n\nThe choice of a regression method depends on the assumptions made about the error structure of the data. We analyze the given options:\n\n1.  **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**: OLS assumes that the independent variable ($X$) is measured without error, and all measurement error resides in the dependent variable ($Y$). It minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances between the data points and the regression line. In this problem, Method $X$ is a reference procedure but is explicitly stated to have a measurement error characterized by $\\sigma_X = 1.5$ mg/dL. The core assumption of OLS is therefore violated. Using OLS would lead to a biased estimate of the slope, a phenomenon known as regression dilution.\n\n2.  **Weighted Least Squares (WLS) Regression**: WLS is an extension of OLS used when the error variance of the dependent variable ($Y$) is not constant (i.e., heteroscedastic). It assigns less weight to observations with higher variance. The problem states that the imprecision for Method $Y$ is constant ($\\sigma_Y = 1.0$ mg/dL). Thus, the primary reason for using WLS is not present. Furthermore, like OLS, standard WLS still assumes the independent variable ($X$) is error-free.\n\n3.  **Passing–Bablok Regression**: This is a non-parametric method, meaning it does not require the measurement errors to follow a specific distribution (like Gaussian). It is robust to outliers. While the problem states errors are \"approximately Gaussian\", a non-parametric approach is a valid consideration. However, when the assumptions of a parametric test are met, the parametric test is generally more statistically powerful (i.e., provides more precise estimates for a given sample size). Since the error distribution is specified, a parametric approach that utilizes this information is preferable.\n\n4.  **Deming Regression**: This is an \"errors-in-variables\" model. It is specifically designed for situations where both the independent ($X$) and dependent ($Y$) variables are subject to measurement error. This perfectly matches the problem description, where both methods have known, non-zero imprecision ($\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$). Deming regression minimizes the sum of squared distances from the data points to the regression line, where the distances are weighted according to the error variances of $X$ and $Y$. The method requires the ratio of the error variances, $\\lambda = \\sigma_Y^2 / \\sigma_X^2$, to be known. This ratio can be directly calculated from the provided data.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1**: Deming regression is the most appropriate method. Its underlying assumptions align precisely with the conditions specified in the problem: linear relationship, approximately Gaussian errors, and—most critically—the presence of measurement error in both variables with a known variance ratio.\n\n**Part 2: Bias Estimation using Deming Regression**\n\nWe model the relationship between the true values of $Y$ and $X$ (denoted $\\eta$ and $\\xi$ respectively) as $\\eta = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\xi$. The observed values are $x_i = \\xi_i + \\delta_i$ and $y_i = \\eta_i + \\epsilon_i$, where $\\delta_i$ and $\\epsilon_i$ are the measurement errors. The problem gives $\\text{Var}(\\delta_i) = \\sigma_X^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$ and $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma_Y^2 = (1.0)^2 = 1.0$.\n\nThe ratio of the error variances is $\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{\\sigma_X^2} = \\frac{1.0}{2.25} = \\frac{1}{9/4} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nThe Deming regression slope and intercept estimators, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, are found by first calculating the following sample statistics from the $n=5$ data pairs:\n-   Sample mean of $X$: $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{10+20+30+40+50}{5} = \\frac{150}{5} = 30$.\n-   Sample mean of $Y$: $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \\frac{13+24+35+46+57}{5} = \\frac{175}{5} = 35$.\n\nNext, we need the sum of squared deviations and the sum of products of deviations:\n-   $S_{xx}' = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (10-30)^2 + (20-30)^2 + (30-30)^2 + (40-30)^2 + (50-30)^2 = 400 + 100 + 0 + 100 + 400 = 1000$.\n-   $S_{yy}' = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = (13-35)^2 + (24-35)^2 + (35-35)^2 + (46-35)^2 + (57-35)^2 = (-22)^2 + (-11)^2 + 0^2 + 11^2 + 22^2 = 484 + 121 + 0 + 121 + 484 = 1210$.\n-   $S_{xy}' = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = (-20)(-22) + (-10)(-11) + (0)(0) + (10)(11) + (20)(22) = 440 + 110 + 0 + 110 + 440 = 1100$.\n\nThe formula for the Deming regression slope estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{(S_{yy}' - \\lambda S_{xx}') + \\sqrt{(S_{yy}' - \\lambda S_{xx}')^2 + 4\\lambda (S_{xy}')^2}}{2 S_{xy}'} $$\nNote that some formulations use sample variances $S_{xx} = S_{xx}'/(n-1)$, etc. The $(n-1)$ factor cancels, so we can use the sum of squares directly.\n\nLet's compute the term $S_{yy}' - \\lambda S_{xx}'$:\n$$ S_{yy}' - \\lambda S_{xx}' = 1210 - \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)(1000) = 1210 - \\frac{4000}{9} = \\frac{10890 - 4000}{9} = \\frac{6890}{9} $$\nNow substitute all values into the slope formula:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{6890}{9}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right) (1100)^2}}{2(1100)} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\sqrt{\\frac{47472100}{81} + \\frac{16}{9}(1210000)}}{2200} = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\sqrt{\\frac{47472100}{81} + \\frac{19360000 \\times 9}{81}}}{2200} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\sqrt{\\frac{47472100 + 174240000}{81}}}{2200} = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\frac{\\sqrt{221712100}}{9}}{2200} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\frac{6890}{9} + \\frac{14890}{9}}{2200} = \\frac{\\frac{21780}{9}}{2200} = \\frac{2420}{2200} = \\frac{242}{220} = \\frac{11 \\times 22}{10 \\times 22} = 1.1 $$\nThe estimated slope is $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 1.1$.\n\nThe Deming regression line passes through the centroid of the data $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. The intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is therefore:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x} = 35 - (1.1)(30) = 35 - 33 = 2 $$\nThe fitted regression equation is $\\hat{Y} = 2 + 1.1 X$.\n\nFinally, we estimate the bias of Method $Y$ at the decision threshold $x_0 = 45$ mg/dL.

At a medical decision level $x_0$, define the absolute bias as the expected difference between the method and the true value, and the relative bias as the absolute bias divided by the true value. The laboratory quality system expresses acceptability using Total Allowable Error (TEa) and Analytical Coefficient of Variation (CVa).

At the concentration level $x_0$, the absolute total allowable error is $TEa \\times x_0$.\nThe systematic error at $x_0$ is the absolute bias, $B_{abs}(x_0)$. The magnitude of this error is $|B_{abs}(x_0)|$.\nThe portion of the error budget available for random error (imprecision) is the total allowable error minus the magnitude of the bias:\n$$\\text{Allowable margin for imprecision} = (TEa \\times x_0) - |B_{abs}(x_0)|$$\n\nThe imprecision is quantified by the standard deviation, $SD$. The analytical coefficient of variation, $CVa$, is the relative imprecision, defined as $CVa = \\frac{SD}{x_0}$. Thus, the absolute imprecision is $SD = CVa \\times x_0$. The given value is $CVa = 0.018$.\n\nThe sigma metric is the ratio of the allowable margin for imprecision to the standard deviation of imprecision:\n$$\\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{(TEa \\times x_0) - |B_{abs}(x_0)|}{CVa \\times x_0}$$\n\nTo express this in terms of relative bias, we substitute $|B_{abs}(x_0)| = |B_{rel}(x_0)| \\times x_0$:\n$$\\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{(TEa \\times x_0) - (|B_{rel}(x_0)| \\times x_0)}{CVa \\times x_0}$$\nFactoring out $x_0$ from the numerator and denominator yields the final formula for the sigma metric at a level $x_0$:\n$$\\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{TEa - |B_{rel}(x_0)|}{CVa}$$\n\nNow, we compute the value of the sigma metric using the given data and a rounding to three significant figures.\n$TEa = 0.10$\n$CVa = 0.018$\n$|B_{rel}(x_0)| = |\\frac{1}{450}|$\n\n$$\\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{0.10 - \\frac{1}{450}}{0.018}$$\nTo perform the calculation exactly, we use fractions:\n$TEa = \\frac{1}{10}$\n$CVa = \\frac{18}{1000} = \\frac{9}{500}$\n$$ \\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{450}}{\\frac{9}{500}} = \\frac{\\frac{45-1}{450}}{\\frac{9}{500}} = \\frac{\\frac{44}{450}}{\\frac{9}{500}} = \\frac{44}{450} \\times \\frac{500}{9} = \\frac{44}{9 \\times 50} \\times \\frac{10 \\times 50}{9} = \\frac{44 \\times 10}{9 \\times 9} = \\frac{440}{81} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{metric} \\approx 5.4320987... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $5.43$.\n\n**Part 3: Conceptual Explanation of Calibration's Influence**\n\nThe process of calibration for an analytical method establishes the relationship between the instrument's signal and the analyte concentration. This process directly determines the operational intercept ($\\hat{\\alpha}$) and slope ($\\hat{\\beta}$) of the method's response curve. The sigma metric, $\\sigma_{metric} = \\frac{TEa - |B_{rel}(x_0)|}{CVa}$, is a function of three components: the total allowable error ($TEa$), the method's imprecision ($CVa$), and its systematic error or bias ($B_{rel}(x_0)$). Both $TEa$ and $CVa$ are typically considered fixed characteristics, representing an external quality goal and the inherent random variability of the method, respectively. Calibration does not affect $CVa$. Therefore, the primary way to improve the sigma metric is to reduce the magnitude of the relative bias, $|B_{rel}(x_0)|$. A different calibration choice, such as using different calibrator values or a different fitting algorithm, would result in new values for $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$. An effective recalibration would adjust these parameters to make the term $|B_{rel}(x_0)| = |\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{x_0} + \\hat{\\beta} - 1|$ closer to zero. By minimizing the systematic error at the medical decision level $x_0$, the numerator of the sigma metric formula ($TEa - |B_{rel}(x_0)|$) increases, which in turn increases the value of $\\sigma_{metric}$.

The ARL is the expected number of measurements (or runs) until an out-of-control signal is detected. For a process where each run is an independent Bernoulli trial with a constant probability of signaling, $p$, the number of runs until the first signal follows a geometric distribution. The problem statement's reference to an absorbing Markov chain with a single transient state is a formal way of describing this geometric process. The ARL is the mean of this distribution, given by:\n$$\nARL = \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the probability of a signal on any given single run.\n\nThe problem defines a quality control measurement, $X$, from a process that has experienced a mean shift.

The probability of a signal in a single run, $p_{WG}$, is:\n$$\np_{WG} = P(X < \\mu - 2\\sigma) + P(X > \\mu + 2\\sigma)\n$$\nWe convert these conditions on $X$ to conditions on $Z$:\nFor the lower limit:\n$$\nX < \\mu - 2\\sigma \\\\\n\\frac{X - (\\mu+0.7\\sigma)}{\\sigma} < \\frac{(\\mu - 2\\sigma) - (\\mu+0.7\\sigma)}{\\sigma} \\\\\nZ < \\frac{-2.7\\sigma}{\\sigma} \\\\\nZ < -2.7\n$$\nFor the upper limit:\n$$\nX > \\mu + 2\\sigma \\\\\n\\frac{X - (\\mu+0.7\\sigma)}{\\sigma} > \\frac{(\\mu + 2\\sigma) - (\\mu+0.7\\sigma)}{\\sigma} \\\\\nZ > \\frac{1.3\\sigma}{\\sigma} \\\\\nZ > 1.3\n$$\nThus, the probability of a $1$–$2s$ signal is:\n$$\np_{WG} = P(Z < -2.7) + P(Z > 1.3) = \\Phi(-2.7) + (1 - \\Phi(1.3))\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the ARL of the Shewhart chart to the ARL of the $1$–$2s$ Westgard rule.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{ARL_{SH}}{ARL_{WG}} = \\frac{1/p_{SH}}{1/p_{WG}} = \\frac{p_{WG}}{p_{SH}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\Phi(-2.7) + 1 - \\Phi(1.3)}{\\Phi(-3.7) + 1 - \\Phi(2.3)}\n$$\nWe now use standard values for the normal CDF:\n$\\Phi(1.3) \\approx 0.9031995$\n$\\Phi(2.3) \\approx 0.9892759$\n$\\Phi(-2.7) = 1 - \\Phi(2.7) \\approx 1 - 0.9965330 = 0.0034670$\n$\\Phi(-3.7) = 1 - \\Phi(3.7) \\approx 1 - 0.9998922 = 0.0001078$\n\nNow we compute the numerator and denominator.\n$p_{WG} = 0.0034670 + (1 - 0.9031995) = 0.0034670 + 0.0968005 = 0.1002675$\n$p_{SH} = 0.0001078 + (1 - 0.9892759) = 0.0001078 + 0.0107241 = 0.0108319$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.1002675}{0.0108319} \\approx 9.256722\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $9.257$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.257}$$", "id": "5213878"}]}
