Under the given assumption that particle penetration through the filter is negligible and there are no internal sources, any particles detected inside the mask arrived via face-seal leakage. A higher ambient concentration relative to the in-mask concentration implies a better fit. Therefore, the fit factor is defined as the ratio of the ambient (outside) particle concentration, $C_{\\text{out}}$, to the in-mask (inside) particle concentration, $C_{\\text{in}}$.\n\n$$F = \\frac{C_{\\text{out}}}{C_{\\text{in}}}$$\n\nThis expression is the direct mathematical formulation of the \"fit factor\" concept based on the problem's premises.\n\n**2) Calculation of Concentrations and Fit Factor**\n\nThe particle number concentration, $C$, is defined as the number of particles, $k$, per unit volume, $V$. The volume of air sampled, $V$, is the product of the volumetric flow rate, $q$, and the sampling duration, $t$. Thus, $C = k/(q \\cdot t)$. We must ensure consistent units for a valid calculation. We will convert all units to centimeters ($cm$) and seconds ($s$).\n\nThe conversion for the flow rate is:\n$1 \\ \\mathrm{L} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1} = 1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{min}}{60 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1000}{60} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{50}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ambient concentration $C_{\\text{out}}$.\nThe ambient flow rate is $q_{\\text{out}} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{L} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$q_{\\text{out}} = 0.30 \\times \\frac{50}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{15}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe volume of the ambient sample, $V_{\\text{out}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{out}} = q_{\\text{out}} \\cdot t_{\\text{out}} = (5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (120 \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 600 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$$\nThe ambient concentration, $C_{\\text{out}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{out}}}{V_{\\text{out}}} = \\frac{5.40 \\times 10^{5}}{600 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = \\frac{5.40 \\times 10^{5}}{6 \\times 10^{2}} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 0.9 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 900 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the in-mask concentration $C_{\\text{in}}$.\nThe in-mask flow rate is $q_{\\text{in}} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{L} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$q_{\\text{in}} = 0.50 \\times \\frac{50}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{25}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe volume of the in-mask sample, $V_{\\text{in}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{in}} = q_{\\text{in}} \\cdot t_{\\text{in}} = (\\frac{25}{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (180 \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 25 \\cdot 60 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3} = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$$\nThe in-mask concentration, $C_{\\text{in}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{V_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{1.62 \\times 10^{4}}{1500 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = \\frac{16200}{1500} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = \\frac{162}{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10.8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fit factor $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{C_{\\text{out}}}{C_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{900}{10.8} = 83.333...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required:\n$$F \\approx 83.3$$\n\n**3) Determination of the Pass Indicator**\n\nThe pass indicator, $I$, is determined by comparing the calculated fit factor, $F$, to the minimum required fit factor, $F_{\\min}$.\nThe criterion is $I=1$ if $F \\ge F_{\\min}$ and $I=0$ otherwise.\nGiven $F_{\\min} = 100$.\nOur calculated fit factor is $F = 83.3$.\nSince $83.3 < 100$, the condition $F \\ge F_{\\min}$ is not met.\nTherefore, the pass indicator is:\n$$I = 0$$\n\nThe final result is the row matrix $(F, I)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 83.3 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5239718"}, {"introduction": "Effective use of PPE extends beyond selecting the right equipment; it includes the procedures for putting it on and, crucially, taking it off.

The parameters are physically plausible probabilities and fractions. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous objective. The underlying principles are based on standard probability theory (Bernoulli trials, independence of events).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet the three items be gloves ($g$), gown ($o$), and face protection ($f$). The first step is to calculate the probability, $s_i$, that removing item $i$ contaminates the hands. This is the joint probability that the item's surface is contaminated ($p_i$) and that a transfer occurs during contact ($\\tau_i$). Due to independence, this is $s_i = p_i \\tau_i$.\n\nFor gloves:\n$s_g = p_{\\text{gloves}} \\tau_{\\text{gloves}} = 0.60 \\times 0.15 = 0.09$\n\nFor the gown:\n$s_o = p_{\\text{gown}} \\tau_{\\text{gown}} = 0.35 \\times 0.08 = 0.028$\n\nFor face protection:\n$s_f = p_{\\text{face}} \\tau_{\\text{face}} = 0.20 \\times 0.05 = 0.01$\n\nLet a doffing sequence be denoted by an ordered triplet $(i, j, k)$, where $i$ is removed first, $j$ second, and $k$ third. ABHR is performed between the removal of $j$ and $k$. We need to find the final probability of hand contamination, $P_{\\text{final}}$.\n\nLet $C_{pre}$ be the event that hands are contaminated before the ABHR step. This occurs if contamination happens during the removal of item $i$ or item $j$. The probability of not being contaminated by item $i$ is $(1-s_i)$, and by item $j$ is $(1-s_j)$. Due to independence, the probability of being not contaminated by either is $(1-s_i)(1-s_j)$. Therefore, the probability of being contaminated is:\n$P(C_{pre}) = 1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)$\n\nAfter the ABHR is performed, any existing contamination on the hands is reduced. The problem states that the contamination is multiplied by the residual fraction $r$. In this probabilistic model, this means that if the hands are contaminated, the contamination persists with probability $r$. Let $C_{survive}$ be the event that contamination from the first two steps survives the ABHR. The probability of this event is:\n$P(C_{survive}) = P(C_{pre}) \\times r = r [1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$\n\nFinally, item $k$ is removed, which can contaminate the hands with probability $s_k$. The final hand contamination event, $C_{\\text{final}}$, occurs if the pre-ABHR contamination survives ($C_{survive}$) OR if contamination occurs from the final item $k$. These two events are independent. Thus, the probability of $C_{\\text{final}}$ is:\n$P(C_{\\text{final}}) = P(C_{survive} \\cup C_k) = P(C_{survive}) + P(C_k) - P(C_{survive})P(C_k)$\n$P(C_{\\text{final}}) = P(C_{survive}) + s_k - P(C_{survive})s_k = s_k + P(C_{survive})(1-s_k)$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(C_{survive})$:\n$P_{\\text{final}}(i, j, k) = s_k + r(1-s_k)[1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum of $P_{\\text{final}}$ over all $3! = 6$ permutations of $(g, o, f)$. Since the order of the first two items $(i, j)$ does not change the value of $[1 - (1-s_i)(1-s_j)]$, we only need to test the three possible choices for the final item, $k$.\n\nThe contamination probabilities are $s_g = 0.09$, $s_o = 0.028$, and $s_f = 0.01$.
