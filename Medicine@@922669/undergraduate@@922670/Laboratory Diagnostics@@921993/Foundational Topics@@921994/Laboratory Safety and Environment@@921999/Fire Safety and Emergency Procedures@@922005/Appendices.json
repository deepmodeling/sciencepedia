The analysis proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the formula for energy stored in a capacitor; second, the calculation of the potential electrostatic discharge energy; and third, the comparison of this energy to the minimum ignition energy of acetone.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the energy $E$ stored in a capacitance $C$ charged to a potential difference $V$. The definition of capacitance is the ratio of the magnitude of the charge $Q$ on one conductor to the potential difference $V$ between the conductors:\n$$C = \\frac{Q}{V}$$\nThe work $dW$ done in moving an infinitesimal charge $dq$ across a potential difference $v$ is given by:\n$$dW = v \\, dq$$\nAs a capacitor is charged from a state of zero charge to a final charge $Q$, the potential difference across it increases from $0$ to $V$. At any intermediate state where the charge is $q$, the potential difference is $v = q/C$. Substituting this into the expression for the differential work done gives:\n$$dW = \\frac{q}{C} \\, dq$$\nThe total energy $E$ stored in the capacitor is the total work done to charge it. This is found by integrating $dW$ from the initial charge of $q=0$ to the final charge $q=Q$:\n$$E = W = \\int_0^Q \\frac{q}{C} \\, dq$$\nSince the capacitance $C$ is a constant for a given physical configuration, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_0^Q q \\, dq$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{C} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}q^2 \\right]_0^Q = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}Q^2 - 0 \\right) = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$$\nTo express this energy in terms of the directly provided parameters $C$ and $V$, we substitute $Q = CV$ into the derived energy expression:\n$$E = \\frac{(CV)^2}{2C} = \\frac{C^2 V^2}{2C} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship for the energy stored in a capacitor.\n\nNext, we calculate the electrostatic discharge energy $E_{\\text{discharge}}$ for the given system.

The given value is $E_{\\mathrm{MIE}} = 1.15\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$.\n$$R = \\frac{E_{\\text{discharge}}}{E_{\\mathrm{MIE}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$R = \\frac{14.4\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}{1.15\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}$$\n$$R \\approx 12.521739...$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 12.5$$\nAccording to the specified criterion, anti-static controls are required if $R \\geq 1$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe transient behavior of a contaminant in a well-mixed volume is described by the mass balance equation:\nRate of Accumulation = Rate of Inflow - Rate of Outflow\nLet $C(t)$ be the volume fraction of hydrogen in the room at time $t$. The volume of hydrogen in the room is $V C(t)$. The rate of accumulation is $V \\frac{dC}{dt}$.\nThe inflow rate is the leak rate $S$.

Regular emergency drills are essential to ensure procedural fluency.\n4.  **Warning Signage:** Prominent, unambiguous signs must be placed at all entrances to the protected area, warning of the presence of a life-threatening $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ suppression system.\n5.  **System Lockout/Tagout Procedures:** A formal lockout/tagout procedure must be in place to mechanically and electrically disable the automatic activation of the system during maintenance or other non-emergency activities within the space, preventing accidental discharge.\n6.  **Ensuring Occupant Evacuation:** The system should never be discharged with personnel known to be inside. Procedures must be in place to account for all personnel before a manual activation, and automatic systems rely on a time delay sufficient for self-evacuation.\nThese measures are critical to mitigate the significant life safety risk posed by total-flooding $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ systems in normally occupied areas.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.571}$$", "id": "5221731"}]}
