A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution begins with the first-order microbial death kinetics model, which states that the rate of inactivation is proportional to the number of viable microorganisms, $N(t)$, present at time $t$.\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k N(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order death rate constant.\n\nThis linear first-order ordinary differential equation is solved by separation of variables and integration. We integrate from time $t=0$, where the population is $N_{0}$, to a final time $t_{exp}$, where the population is $N_{f}$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_{0}}^{N_{f}} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_{0}^{t_{exp}} -k \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N_{f}) - \\ln(N_{0}) = -k t_{exp}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k t_{exp}\n$$\nIn sterilization microbiology, it is conventional to work with base-$10$ logarithms. Using the relationship $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k t_{exp}\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} t_{exp}\n$$\nThe decimal reduction time, or $D$-value, is defined as the time required at a specific temperature to achieve a $1$-logarithm (i.e., $90\\%$) reduction in the microbial population. When $t_{exp} = D$, the final population is $N_{f} = N_{0}/10$. Substituting this definition into the equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{0}/10}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} D\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}(10^{-1}) = -1 = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} D\n$$\nThis allows us to express the rate constant term as $\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{D}$. Substituting this back into the kinetic equation yields the standard survival curve equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{t_{exp}}{D}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the exposure time, $t_{exp}$:\n$$\nt_{exp} = -D \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = D \\left( \\log_{10}(N_{0}) - \\log_{10}(N_{f}) \\right)\n$$\nThe Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) is defined as the probability of a single nonsterile unit after the sterilization process.
