Let this ratio be denoted by $R$.\n\nFirst, we establish this ratio for the reference condition. The reference whole-blood volume is given as $V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}$. The corresponding plasma volume, $V_{p,\\mathrm{ref}}$, is the fraction of the whole-blood volume that is not occupied by red blood cells. Given the reference hematocrit $H_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, this volume is:\n$$V_{p,\\mathrm{ref}} = (1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}) V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}$$\nThe volume of citrate anticoagulant under reference conditions is $V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}}$. Therefore, the required constant ratio $R$ of citrate-to-plasma volume is:\n$$R = \\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}}}{V_{p,\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}}}{(1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}) V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}}$$\nNext, we consider the patient with a measured hematocrit of $H$. To maintain the integrity of the test, the phlebotomist will still draw the same nominal volume of whole blood, $V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}$, into the tube. The plasma volume for this patient's blood sample, $V_{p}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{p} = (1 - H) V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}$$\nThe volume of citrate in the tube must be adjusted to a new value, $V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}$, such that the citrate-to-plasma ratio for the patient's sample is equal to the reference ratio $R$.\n$$\\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}}{V_{p}} = R$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{p}$ and $R$:\n$$\\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}}{(1 - H) V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}} = \\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}}}{(1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}) V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}}$$\nThe term for the nominal blood volume, $V_{b,\\mathrm{nom}}$, appears in the denominator on both sides of the equation and can be canceled. This is logical, as the ratio correction depends only on the hematocrit values and the initial citrate volume, not the amount of blood drawn (provided it is consistent).\n$$\\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}}{1 - H} = \\frac{V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}}}{1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nSolving for the adjusted citrate volume, $V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} = V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}} \\frac{1 - H}{1 - H_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the adjusted citrate volume.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}}$ using the provided data:\n- $V_{c,\\mathrm{nom}} = 0.500$ mL\n- $H_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.42$\n- $H = 0.62$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} = 0.500 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.62}{1 - 0.42}$$\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} = 0.500 \\times \\frac{0.38}{0.58}$$\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} \\approx 0.500 \\times 0.6551724...$$\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} \\approx 0.3275862... \\text{ mL}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V_{c,\\mathrm{adj}} \\approx 0.328 \\text{ mL}$$\nThus, for a patient with a hematocrit of $0.62$, the volume of citrate anticoagulant in the collection tube must be adjusted to approximately $0.328$ mL to maintain the correct anticoagulant-to-plasma ratio.
