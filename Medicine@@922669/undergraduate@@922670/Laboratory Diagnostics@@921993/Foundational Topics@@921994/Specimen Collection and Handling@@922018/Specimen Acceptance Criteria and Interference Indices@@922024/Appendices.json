The positive bias is defined as the concentration increment due to the potassium introduced by the additive alone. This can be calculated using the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nFirst, we define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement:\n- The volume of the $\\text{K}_2\\text{EDTA}$ additive carryover is $V_{additive} = 0.1$ mL.\n- The volume of the serum is $V_{serum} = 4.0$ mL.\n- The concentration of potassium in the $\\text{K}_2\\text{EDTA}$ additive is $C_{additive} = 1.5$ mmol/mL.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the amount (in moles) of potassium introduced by the additive is conserved and becomes distributed throughout the final volume of the mixed sample.\n\nThe amount of potassium substance, $n_{K,add}$, introduced by the additive is the product of the additive's concentration and its volume:\n$$n_{K,add} = C_{additive} \\times V_{additive}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$n_{K,add} = (1.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{mL}}) \\times (0.1 \\, \\text{mL}) = 0.15 \\, \\text{mmol}$$\n\nNext, we determine the final volume of the mixture.

The derivation will be based on the principles of mass conservation, using a basis of $1 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ of whole blood as specified.\n\nFirst, let us define the provided variables and constants:\n- Measured free hemoglobin concentration in plasma, $[Hb]_{plasma, free} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{g/L}$.\n- Patient's hematocrit, $\\mathrm{Hct} = 0.45$.

This fraction can be found by comparing the mass of hemoglobin released into the plasma to the total mass of hemoglobin originally contained within the RBCs.\n\nThe total mass of hemoglobin, $m_{Hb, total}$, within the RBCs of our $1 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ blood sample is determined by the MCHC and the volume of RBCs:\n$$m_{Hb, total} = \\mathrm{MCHC} \\times V_{RBC}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$m_{Hb, total} = 330 \\ \\mathrm{g/L} \\times 0.45 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 148.5 \\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe mass of hemoglobin released into the plasma, $m_{Hb, released}$, is determined by the measured free hemoglobin concentration in plasma and the volume of plasma:\n$$m_{Hb, released} = [Hb]_{plasma, free} \\times V_{plasma}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$m_{Hb, released} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{g/L} \\times 0.55 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 0.275 \\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe fraction of lysed RBCs, $f_{lysed}$, is the ratio of the released hemoglobin mass to the total hemoglobin mass:\n$$f_{lysed} = \\frac{m_{Hb, released}}{m_{Hb, total}} = \\frac{[Hb]_{plasma, free} \\times V_{plasma}}{\\mathrm{MCHC} \\times V_{RBC}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of potassium (in moles) released into the plasma due to this lysis.

The increase in serum potassium concentration, $\\Delta[K^+]_{serum}$, is therefore the amount of released potassium divided by the plasma volume:\n$$\\Delta[K^+]_{serum} = \\frac{n_{K^+, released}}{V_{plasma}} = \\frac{1}{V_{plasma}} \\left( \\frac{[Hb]_{plasma, free} \\times V_{plasma} \\times [K^+]_{RBC}}{\\mathrm{MCHC}} \\right)$$\nThe term for plasma volume, $V_{plasma}$, also cancels out, leading to a remarkably simple final expression:\n$$\\Delta[K^+]_{serum} = \\frac{[Hb]_{plasma, free} \\times [K^+]_{RBC}}{\\mathrm{MCHC}}$$\nThis result shows that the increase in potassium concentration due to hemolysis is independent of the patient's hematocrit.
