This is fundamentally limited by the diffraction of light. We begin with the description of the image of a point source. Due to diffraction by the circular aperture of the microscope objective, a point source of light is not imaged as a perfect point but as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular radius of the Airy disk (the angle from the center to the first minimum) is given by the formula for diffraction from a circular aperture:\n$$ \\sin\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda'}{D} $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angular half-width of the central maximum, $\\lambda'$ is the wavelength of light in the medium through which it is being imaged, and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion for resolution, as specified for incoherent imaging, states that two point sources are just resolvable if the center of the Airy pattern of one source is located on the first minimum of the Airy pattern of the other. This means the minimum angular separation between two resolvable point sources, $\\theta_{min}$, is equal to the angular radius of the Airy disk.\n$$ \\theta_{min} \\approx \\sin\\theta_{min} = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda'}{D} $$\nThe small angle approximation is valid for typical microscope magnifications.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum resolvable linear separation, $d_{min}$, in the specimen plane (object space). This distance is related to the angular resolution. The radius of the Airy disk, when projected back onto the specimen plane, corresponds to this minimum resolvable distance $d_{min}$. A standard derivation in optics shows that this projected radius is given by:\n$$ d_{min} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda'}{\\sin\\alpha} $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the half-angle of the cone of light collected by the objective lens from the specimen. The factor $0.61$ is half of $1.22$.\n\nThe wavelength of light in the immersion medium, $\\lambda'$, is related to the vacuum wavelength $\\lambda$ by the refractive index of the medium, $n$.\n$$ \\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda}{n} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d_{min}$:\n$$ d_{min} = \\frac{0.61 (\\lambda/n)}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{n \\sin\\alpha} $$\nThe quantity $n \\sin\\alpha$ is defined as the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the objective lens.\n$$ \\text{NA} = n \\sin\\alpha $$\nTherefore, substituting the definition of NA into our expression yields the final formula for the minimum resolvable separation (also known as the lateral resolution limit) for an incoherent imaging system:\n$$ d_{min} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{\\text{NA}} $$\nThis derived expression connects the minimum resolvable separation to the illumination wavelength and the numerical aperture of the objective.\n\nNow, we can use the parameters given in the problem statement to compute the minimum resolvable separation for the specified microscope configuration.\nThe givens are:\nIllumination wavelength, $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nNumerical Aperture, $\\text{NA} = 1.4$.\nThe refractive index of the immersion medium, $n \\approx 1.515$, is consistent with the stated NA (since $\\sin\\alpha = \\text{NA}/n = 1.4/1.515 \\approx 0.924  1$, which is physically possible), but it is not directly needed for the calculation as its effect is already included in the value of the NA.\n\nSubstituting the values for $\\lambda$ and NA into our derived formula:\n$$ d_{min} = \\frac{0.61 \\times (550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.4} $$\n$$ d_{min} = \\frac{335.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.4} $$\n$$ d_{min} \\approx 239.6428...\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ d_{min} \\approx 0.2396428...\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ d_{min} \\approx 0.240\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nThis is the theoretical limit of resolution for this microscope setup.\n\nFinally, we must decide whether the two protein clusters on the bacterial envelope can be resolved.

A smear is prepared from the culture and subjected to the standard Gram stain procedure, which involves the sequential application of crystal violet, Gram's iodine, a decolorizer (ethanol-acetone), and a counterstain (safranin). Upon microscopic examination at 1000x magnification, the field is observed to be populated by purple, rod-shaped cells. Notably, many of these purple cells exhibit a distinct, ovoid, and completely unstained area, characteristically located at one end of the rod, giving them a \"tennis racket\" appearance.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for the presence of this specific unstained structure within the purple-staining bacterial cell?\n\nA. It is a large storage granule, such as a poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusion, which is lipid-rich and thus hydrophobic, repelling the aqueous staining reagents.\n\nB.

In the Gram stain, crystal violet (a basic dye) binds to negatively charged cellular components and forms an insoluble complex with iodine (the crystal violet-iodine complex). In Gram-positive bacteria, the thick peptidoglycan layer retains this complex during the ethanol-acetone decolorization step, so the cells remain purple after counterstaining.\n\nIn sporulating Gram-positive rods such as Clostridium tetani, a developing endospore forms an ovoid, highly refractile structure that is classically terminal, producing a “tennis racket” or “drumstick” morphology. Endospores are characterized by a multilayered protective architecture: an exosporium, a proteinaceous spore coat rich in keratin-like proteins, a cortex of modified peptidoglycan, and a core that is markedly dehydrated and contains high concentrations of calcium-dipicolinate. These features make the spore highly impermeable to many dyes used in routine staining methods. In the standard Gram stain, the spore does not take up either the primary dye or the counterstain, so it appears as a clear, unstained area within an otherwise purple-stained vegetative cell.
