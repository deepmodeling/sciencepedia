The derivation is based on two foundational principles of physical chemistry: Dalton's law of partial pressures and Henry's law.\n\nFirst, we apply Dalton's law to the gas phase in the chamber. The total pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the partial pressures of all gaseous components. The problem states that the headspace is saturated with water vapor at the incubation temperature of $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of water vapor, $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, is equal to the given saturated water vapor pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}$. The remaining pressure is exerted by the components of the dry gas, which we denote as $p_{\\mathrm{dry}}$.\n\nMathematically, Dalton's law is expressed as:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{tot}} = p_{\\mathrm{dry}} + p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$$\nGiven that $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}$, we can solve for the pressure of the dry gas components:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{dry}} = p_{\\mathrm{tot}} - p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}$$\nNext, we determine the partial pressure of oxygen, $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. The problem gives the mole fraction of oxygen in the dry gas as $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. The partial pressure of a component in an ideal gas mixture is the product of its mole fraction and the total pressure of the mixture it is part of. In this case, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is the mole fraction within the dry gas portion of the atmosphere. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{dry}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{\\mathrm{dry}}$ from Dalton's law, we find the partial pressure of oxygen in terms of the total chamber pressure and water vapor pressure:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (p_{\\mathrm{tot}} - p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}})$$\nFinally, we use Henry's law, which states that at equilibrium, the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in the phase above the liquid. The law is given by:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = k_H \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is the molar concentration of dissolved oxygen and $k_H$ is the Henry's law constant for oxygen at the specified temperature.\n\nBy substituting our derived expression for $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ into Henry's law, we obtain the requested general expression that relates the dissolved oxygen concentration to the given variables:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = k_H(37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) \\left[ y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (p_{\\mathrm{tot}} - p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}}) \\right]$$\nWe now proceed with the numerical evaluation using the provided values:\n$p_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.000\\ \\mathrm{atm}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.047\\ \\mathrm{atm}$\n$y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.18$\n$k_H(37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) = 1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{atm}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial pressure of oxygen, $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.18 \\times (1.000\\ \\mathrm{atm} - 0.047\\ \\mathrm{atm}) = 0.18 \\times 0.953\\ \\mathrm{atm} = 0.17154\\ \\mathrm{atm}$$\nNext, we use this partial pressure in Henry's law to find the dissolved oxygen concentration in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = (1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{atm}^{-1}) \\times (0.17154\\ \\mathrm{atm})$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 2.05848 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the concentration to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.
