It is scientifically grounded in the principles of optical physics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum Numerical Aperture (NA) required to resolve the transverse width of a *Mycobacterium* bacillus using a brightfield microscope limited by diffraction. The resolution of a light microscope is the smallest distance between two points that can be distinguished as separate entities. This limit is imposed by the diffraction of light.\n\nAccording to the Abbe theory of image formation for a trans-illuminated microscope, the theoretical maximum resolving power is determined by the wavelength of illumination ($\\lambda$), the numerical aperture of the objective lens ($\\text{NA}_{\\text{obj}}$), and the numerical aperture of the condenser ($\\text{NA}_{\\text{cond}}$). The minimum resolvable distance, $R$, is given by the expression:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\text{NA}_{\\text{obj}} + \\text{NA}_{\\text{cond}}} $$\nIn this equation, the numerical aperture, $\\text{NA}$, is defined as $\\text{NA} = n \\sin(\\theta)$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the specimen, and $\\theta$ is the half-angle of the cone of light that can enter or exit the lens.\n\nTo achieve the highest possible resolution (i.e., the smallest possible $R$), one must maximize the denominator. This is accomplished by using a short wavelength of light and high numerical apertures for both the objective and the condenser. The problem specifies the use of an oil-immersion objective and proper Köhler illumination, which implies that the system is set up for optimal performance. Under such conditions, it is standard practice to use an oil-immersion condenser and to open its diaphragm such that its numerical aperture matches that of the objective lens. Therefore, we can set $\\text{NA}_{\\text{cond}} \\approx \\text{NA}_{\\text{obj}}$.\n\nLetting $\\text{NA}$ represent the numerical aperture of the objective lens, such that $\\text{NA} = \\text{NA}_{\\text{obj}}$, the expression for the resolution limit simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\lambda}{2 \\cdot \\text{NA}} $$\nThis expression represents the best possible resolution achievable by the optical system.\n\nThe problem requires resolving a feature with a transverse width of $w$. This means the resolving power of the microscope, $R$, must be at least as small as the width $w$. The limiting case, which defines the minimum required numerical aperture, occurs when the minimum resolvable distance is exactly equal to the feature width:\n$$ w = \\frac{\\lambda}{2 \\cdot \\text{NA}} $$\nThis equation relates the feature size to be resolved, the wavelength of light, and the required numerical aperture. To fulfill the first part of the problem's request, we now derive an expression for the minimum required $\\text{NA}$ by rearranging this equation:\n$$ \\text{NA}_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2 w} $$\nThis is the general expression for the minimum numerical aperture required to resolve a feature of size $w$ using light of wavelength $\\lambda$ under optimal illumination conditions.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the specific values given in the problem. The givens are:\n- Feature width, $w = 0.30 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n- Illumination wavelength, $\\lambda = 546 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency in the calculation, we must express both quantities in the same units. We will convert the width $w$ from micrometers to nanometers:\n$$ w = 0.30 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{nm}}{1 \\, \\mu\\text{m}} = 300 \\, \\text{nm} $$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into our derived expression for $\\text{NA}_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$ \\text{NA}_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{546 \\, \\text{nm}}{2 \\times (300 \\, \\text{nm})} $$\n$$ \\text{NA}_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{546}{600} $$\n$$ \\text{NA}_{\\text{min}} = 0.91 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to three significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as:\n$$ \\text{NA}_{\\text{min}} = 0.910 $$\nThis value is physically realistic. While high-dry objectives can approach this NA, it is comfortably achieved and exceeded by standard oil-immersion objectives, which typically have NAs in the range of $1.25$ to $1.4$, consistent with the setup described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.910}$$", "id": "5202025"}, {"introduction": "Observing acid-fast bacilli on a slide is only the first step; a quantitative report requires careful calculation.

Round your final numerical answer for $PPV$ to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percentage sign).", "solution": "### Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease (smear-positive tuberculosis), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T$ be the event of a positive test result, and let $T^c$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n1.  The pretest prevalence, $p$, is the prior probability of having the disease, $P(D) = p$. From this, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n2.  The sensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present (the true positive rate), $P(T|D) = Se$.\n3.  The specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent (the true negative rate), $P(T^c|D^c) = Sp$.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the posterior probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $\\text{PPV} = P(D|T)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which relates $P(D|T)$ to the quantities defined above:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive states of having the disease ($D$) or not having the disease ($D^c$):\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c) $$\n\nWe have expressions for $P(T|D)$ and $P(D)$. We need an expression for $P(T|D^c)$, which is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a test result for a non-diseased individual must be either positive or negative, we have:\n$$ P(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1 $$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$ P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $P(T|D)$, $P(D)$, $P(T|D^c)$, and $P(D^c)$ into the equation for $P(T)$ yields:\n$$ P(T) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expanded form of $P(T)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + (1-Sp)(1-p)} $$\nThis is the final derived expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)} $$\n\n### Numerical Computation of PPV\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $p = 0.10$\n- $Se = 0.65$\n- $Sp = 0.98$\n\nFrom these, we can calculate the other necessary terms:\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n- $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived formula for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.65)(0.10)}{(0.65)(0.10) + (0.02)(0.90)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator (the probability of a true positive result among the entire population):\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 0.065 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms in the denominator:\n- The probability of a true positive: $(0.65)(0.10) = 0.065$\n- The probability of a false positive: $(0.02)(0.90) = 0.018$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T) = 0.065 + 0.018 = 0.083 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.065}{0.083} \\approx 0.78313253... $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.7831 $$\n\n### Interpretation of Clinical Implications\n\nA Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of $0.7831$ indicates that in this specified patient population (symptomatic adults in a high-burden clinic), an individual with a positive ZN smear result has a $78.31\\%$ probability of truly having smear-positive tuberculosis.\n\nThe clinical implications for decision-making are significant. In a context where untreated tuberculosis has high morbidity, mortality, and potential for community transmission, a probability of nearly $80\\%$ is substantial. For a patient presenting with classic symptoms (prolonged cough, weight loss), a positive smear with this PPV provides strong evidence in favor of the diagnosis. Therefore, it is clinically reasonable, and often standard practice in such settings, to initiate anti-tubercular therapy on the basis of this single positive smear result.\n\nHowever, the result also implies that there is a complementary probability of $1 - \\text{PPV} = 1 - 0.7831 = 0.2169$, or $21.69\\%$, that the positive result is a false positive. This is a non-trivial false positive rate. Treating a patient unnecessarily exposes them to the risks of drug toxicity and incurs costs. Consequently, while initiating presumptive treatment is justified by the high risk of inaction, it is imperative to follow up with a more definitive confirmatory test, such as mycobacterial culture or a nucleic acid amplification test (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF). Such tests can confirm the diagnosis, rule out a false positive, and, in the case of molecular tests, provide information on drug resistance. The decision to treat is thus a probabilistic judgment balancing the severe consequences of a false negative clinical decision (not treating a true positive) against the less severe, yet still significant, consequences of a false positive clinical decision (treating a false positive).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7831}\n$$", "id": "5202034"}]}
