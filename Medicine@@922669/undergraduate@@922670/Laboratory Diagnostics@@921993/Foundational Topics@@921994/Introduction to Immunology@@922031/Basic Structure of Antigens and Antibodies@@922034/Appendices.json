In both cases, proteins are exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which denatures proteins by disrupting noncovalent interactions; in the reducing condition, dithiothreitol (DTT) is also present to reduce disulfide bonds.

Problem Statement Validation**\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **Antigen:** A secreted protein antigen, protein $P$, which is a single polypeptide.\n-   **Structure of Protein P:** Stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds between Cys$20$–Cys$75$ and Cys$120$–Cys$150$.\n-   **Experimental Technique:** Western blotting.\n-   **Sample Treatment Conditions:**\n    1.  **Non-reducing (NR) SDS:** Proteins are treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).\n    2.  **Reducing (R) SDS:** Proteins are treated with SDS and dithiothreitol (DTT).\n-   **Reagent Functions:**\n    -   SDS: Denatures proteins by disrupting noncovalent interactions.\n    -   DTT: Reduces disulfide bonds.\n-   **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):**\n    -   **mAb-L:** Generated against a linear synthetic peptide of residues $30$–$45$. This region contains no cysteines.\n    -   **mAb-C:** Generated against the native folded protein. The epitope is conformational, formed by residues $18$–$22$ and $72$–$77$, which are brought into proximity by the Cys$20$–Cys$75$ disulfide bond.\n    -   **mAb-S:** Generated against a linear synthetic peptide of residues $118$–$152$, which spans the Cys$120$–Cys$150$ pair. The immunizing peptide was in reduced form.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the fundamental principles of biochemistry and immunology. The functions of SDS and DTT, the nature of protein denaturation, the existence of linear and conformational epitopes, and the methodology of Western blotting are all standard and accurately described concepts in molecular biology.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear set of conditions and asks for a logical prediction based on these conditions.

The nature of the protein, the epitopes, and the experimental conditions are all specified, allowing for a rigorous deduction.\n-   **Realism:** The scenario is highly realistic and represents a common experimental design for characterizing antibody specificity and protein properties.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution requires predicting the binding of each antibody under two distinct denaturing conditions. Let us first analyze the state of protein $P$ in each condition.\n\n-   **Non-reducing (NR) SDS condition:** SDS disrupts noncovalent interactions, unfolding the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. However, covalent disulfide bonds are not affected. Therefore, protein $P$ will be largely unfolded, but the loops formed by the Cys$20$–Cys$75$ and Cys$120$–Cys$150$ bonds will remain intact. The protein is denatured but not fully linearized.\n-   **Reducing (R) SDS condition:** SDS disrupts noncovalent interactions, and DTT reduces the disulfide bonds, breaking them into free sulfhydryl (–SH) groups. In this condition, protein $P$ is both denatured and fully reduced, resulting in a completely linearized polypeptide chain.\n\nNow, we will analyze the binding of each monoclonal antibody based on its epitope.\n\n-   **mAb-L:** This antibody was raised against a linear synthetic peptide (residues $30$–$45$). The epitope's recognition depends only on the primary amino acid sequence. This sequence is not involved in a disulfide bond. In both NR and R conditions, the SDS treatment denatures the protein, which serves to expose this linear epitope. The presence or absence of DTT does not alter the primary sequence. Therefore, **mAb-L is expected to detect a band in both non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) conditions.**\n\n-   **mAb-C:** This antibody recognizes a conformational epitope formed by two separate regions of the polypeptide chain (residues $18$–$22$ and $72$–$77$) held together by the Cys$20$–Cys$75$ disulfide bond. Such an epitope depends on a specific three-dimensional arrangement.\n    -   In the NR condition, while the disulfide bond is intact, the potent denaturing agent SDS disrupts the delicate noncovalent interactions that define the precise local conformation of the peptide backbones and side chains. Western blotting is generally incompatible with antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes because SDS-induced denaturation typically destroys them.\n    -   In the R condition, the Cys$20$–Cys$75$ disulfide bond is broken by DTT, and the protein is fully linearized. The two segments forming the epitope are now physically separated, completely obliterating the epitope.\n    -   Thus, it is most plausible that the conformational epitope is destroyed by SDS denaturation in both cases. Therefore, **mAb-C is expected to detect no band in either NR or R conditions.**\n\n-   **mAb-S:** This antibody was raised against a linear, reduced peptide corresponding to residues $118$–$152$. This explicitly indicates that the antibody recognizes the flexible, unconstrained linear form of this sequence. The epitope region contains the Cys$120$ and Cys$150$ residues.\n    -   In the NR condition, the Cys$120$–Cys$150$ disulfide bond is intact, forcing this segment of the protein into a constrained loop. This conformation is different from the linear, reduced immunogen, and will likely prevent the antibody from binding.\n    -   In the R condition, DTT breaks the Cys$120$–Cys$150$ disulfide bond. The protein segment from residue $118$ to $152$ becomes a linear, flexible chain. This state matches the structure of the immunogen, allowing the antibody to bind effectively.\n    -   Therefore, **mAb-S is expected to detect no band in the NR condition but a band in the R condition.**\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   **mAb-L:** Band in NR and R.\n-   **mAb-C:** No band in NR or R.\n-   **mAb-S:** No band in NR, band in R.\n\n**3.

This is the opposite of our prediction.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. mAb-L: band only in R; mAb-C: band in NR and R; mAb-S: no band in NR or R**\n    -   `mAb-L`: \"band only in R\".

This is incorrect; the epitope is destroyed by reduction.\n    -   `mAb-S`: \"no band in NR or R\".

First, we find an expression for $(1-\\theta)$:\n$$\n1-\\theta = 1 - \\frac{K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]}{1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]} = \\frac{(1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]) - K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]}{1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the prozone onset condition:\n$$\nv \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\right) = 2\n$$\nWe now solve this equation algebraically for $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to complete the derivation:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{2} = 1 + K [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\n$$\nK [{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{v}{2} - 1\n$$\n$$\n[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{1}{K} \\left(\\frac{v}{2} - 1\\right) = \\frac{v-2}{2K}\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the threshold free antibody concentration.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters: $v=10$ and $K=2.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$.\n$$\n[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{10 - 2}{2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1})} = \\frac{8}{4.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe problem also provides the total microparticle concentration, $[{\\mathrm{Ag}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}=1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and suggests that the approximation $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}] \\approx [{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ may be justified. We can verify this. The total concentration of epitopes in the system is $[{\\mathrm{E}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = v [{\\mathrm{Ag}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nAt the prozone threshold, the condition $v(1-\\theta_{\\mathrm{th}}) = 2$ implies $10(1-\\theta_{\\mathrm{th}}) = 2$, which gives $1-\\theta_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.2$, so the fractional saturation is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.8$.\nThe concentration of bound epitopes is $[{\\mathrm{E-Ab}}] = \\theta_{\\mathrm{th}} [{\\mathrm{E}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.8 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{M}) = 8.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nThis is also the concentration of bound antibody binding sites. Since each IgG antibody has two binding sites, the concentration of bound antibody molecules, $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{bound}}$, will be on the order of $[{\\mathrm{E-Ab}}]$, specifically between $[{\\mathrm{E-Ab}}]/2$ (if all antibodies are doubly bound) and $[{\\mathrm{E-Ab}}]$ (if all are singly bound). In either case, $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\le 8.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nComparing the concentration of bound antibody to the free antibody concentration at threshold:\n$$\n\\frac{[{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{bound}}}{[{\\mathrm{Ab}}_{\\mathrm{f}}]_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\le \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{M}} = 0.04 = 4\\%\n$$\nSince the concentration of bound antibody is only a small fraction of the free antibody concentration, the total antibody concentration $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{f}} + [{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ is indeed well approximated by $[{\\mathrm{Ab}}]_{\\mathrm{f}}$. The problem's premise is consistent.\n\nThe calculated value is exactly $2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{M}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Although the input parameter $K$ is given with two significant figures, which would conventionally limit the result's precision, we will adhere to the explicit instruction. Expressing the result with three significant figures gives $2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^{-7}}\n$$", "id": "5210926"}]}
