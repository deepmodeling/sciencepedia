The Reference Change Value (RCV) sets the smallest change between two results that is likely to be real (not due to normal biological fluctuation or analytical imprecision) under a chosen confidence level. For a two-sided decision at a confidence level associated with the standard normal deviate $z$, the RCV is derived from first principles using the following foundational bases:\n\n- The coefficient of variation $CV$ of a measurement is the ratio of its standard deviation $\\sigma$ to its mean $\\mu$, so that relative variability can be combined across independent sources as variances.\n- The total relative variance of a single measured value combines independent biological and analytical components as $CV_{\\text{total}}^{2}=CV_{i}^{2}+CV_{a}^{2}$, where $CV_{i}$ is the intra-individual biological variation and $CV_{a}$ is the analytical variation.\n- For two independent measurements on the same individual, the variance of the difference equals the sum of the variances, making the standard deviation of the difference scale by $\\sqrt{2}$ compared to a single measurement.\n- Under the normal approximation, a two-sided decision threshold at confidence level specified by the standard normal deviate $z$ is $z$ times the relevant standard deviation.\n\nAssume serum creatinine has intra-individual biological variation $CV_{i}=5\\%$, the assay method has analytical variation $CV_{a}=3\\%$, and the laboratory uses a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence decision with $z=1.96$.

The problem statement provides the principles to derive the formula for the two-sided $RCV$.\n\nLet the intra-individual biological coefficient of variation be $CV_{i}$ and the analytical coefficient of variation be $CV_{a}$. These are given as dimensionless fractions (or percentages). The total coefficient of variation for a single measurement, $CV_{\\text{total}}$, which combines these two independent sources of variation, is found by adding their variances:\n$$CV_{\\text{total}}^{2} = CV_{i}^{2} + CV_{a}^{2}$$\nThus, the total relative standard deviation for a single measurement is:\n$$CV_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{CV_{i}^{2} + CV_{a}^{2}}$$\nWe are interested in the difference between two measurements, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Assuming these measurements are independent, the variance of their difference is the sum of their individual variances.

For a two-sided test, this threshold is determined by the standard normal deviate, $z$, corresponding to the chosen confidence level. The $RCV$ is therefore $z$ times the standard deviation of the relative difference ($CV_{d}$):\n$$RCV = z \\cdot CV_{d} = z \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{CV_{i}^{2} + CV_{a}^{2}}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$CV_{i} = 5\\% = 0.05$\n$CV_{a} = 3\\% = 0.03$\n$z = 1.96$ (for a $95\\%$ confidence level)\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for the $RCV$.

We are given $P(E) = 0.2\\% = 0.002$.\n-   The sensitivity is the probability of an alert given that a true error has occurred. This is the conditional probability $P(A|E)$. We are given $P(A|E) = 0.80$. This is the true positive rate (TPR).\n-   The specificity is the probability of no alert given that no true error has occurred. This is the conditional probability $P(A^c|E^c)$. We are given $P(A^c|E^c) = 0.95$. This is the true negative rate (TNR).\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the positive predictive value (PPV). The PPV is the probability that a true error has actually occurred, given that a delta alert has been triggered. In our notation, this is the conditional probability $P(E|A)$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$\nP(E|A) = \\frac{P(E \\cap A)}{P(A)}\n$$\nwhere $P(E \\cap A)$ is the probability of the intersection of events $E$ and $A$ (i.e., a true error occurs AND an alert is triggered), and $P(A)$ is the total probability of an alert being triggered.\n\nWe can express the numerator, $P(E \\cap A)$, using the definition of conditional probability for $P(A|E)$:\n$$\nP(A|E) = \\frac{P(E \\cap A)}{P(E)} \\implies P(E \\cap A) = P(A|E) \\times P(E)\n$$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive.\n\nNext, we must express the denominator, $P(A)$, using the law of total probability. An alert (event $A$) can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either a true error has occurred ($E$) or no true error has occurred ($E^c$). Therefore, we can write $P(A)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$\nP(A) = P(A \\cap E) + P(A \\cap E^c)\n$$\nWe already have an expression for the first term, $P(A \\cap E) = P(A|E) \\times P(E)$.\nFor the second term, $P(A \\cap E^c)$, we use the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$\nP(A \\cap E^c) = P(A|E^c) \\times P(E^c)\n$$\nThis term represents the probability of a false positive. We need to find the values for $P(A|E^c)$ and $P(E^c)$.\n\n$P(E^c)$ is the probability that no true error has occurred, which is simply $1$ minus the prevalence:\n$$\nP(E^c) = 1 - P(E)\n$$\n$P(A|E^c)$ is the probability of an alert when no error has occurred (the false positive rate, FPR). It is related to the specificity, $P(A^c|E^c)$. Since an alert is either triggered ($A$) or not ($A^c$), the sum of their probabilities for a given condition is $1$:\n$$\nP(A|E^c) + P(A^c|E^c) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$\nP(A|E^c) = 1 - P(A^c|E^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}\n$$\nNow we can assemble the full expression for $P(A)$:\n$$\nP(A) = (P(A|E) \\times P(E)) + (P(A|E^c) \\times P(E^c))\n$$\n$$\nP(A) = (P(A|E) \\times P(E)) + ((1 - P(A^c|E^c)) \\times (1 - P(E)))\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for PPV, $P(E|A)$, we get:\n$$\nP(E|A) = \\frac{P(A|E) \\times P(E)}{(P(A|E) \\times P(E)) + ((1 - P(A^c|E^c)) \\times (1 - P(E)))}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the PPV in terms of sensitivity ($P(A|E)$), specificity ($P(A^c|E^c)$), and prevalence ($P(E)$), derived from first principles.\n\n### Numerical Computation\nNow we substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n-   Sensitivity, $S_e = P(A|E) = 0.80$\n-   Specificity, $S_p = P(A^c|E^c) = 0.95$\n-   Prevalence, $P_{rev} = P(E) = 0.002$\n\nThe PPV calculation is:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{S_e \\times P_{rev}}{(S_e \\times P_{rev}) + ((1 - S_p) \\times (1 - P_{rev}))}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.002}{(0.80 \\times 0.002) + ((1 - 0.95) \\times (1 - 0.002))}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the components:\nThe numerator, which is the probability of a true positive result:\n$$\n\\text{True Positives} = 0.80 \\times 0.002 = 0.0016\n$$\nThe probability of a false positive result:\n$$\n\\text{False Positives} = (1 - 0.95) \\times (1 - 0.002) = 0.05 \\times 0.998 = 0.0499\n$$\nThe denominator is the sum of true positives and false positives, which is the total probability of an alert:\n$$\nP(A) = 0.0016 + 0.0499 = 0.0515\n$$\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.0016}{0.0515} \\approx 0.03106796...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.03107\n$$\n\n### Discussion on Alert Fatigue\nThe computed Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is approximately $0.03107$, or $3.107\\%$. This result has critical implications for quality monitoring and alert fatigue. A PPV of $3.107\\%$ means that when a delta alert is triggered, there is only a $3.107\\%$ probability that it represents a genuine preanalytical or analytical error. Conversely, this implies that $1 - 0.03107 = 0.96893$, or approximately $96.9\\%$ of all delta alerts, are false positives.\n\nAlert fatigue is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals become desensitized to frequent alarms and may consequently ignore or fail to respond to them appropriately. In a clinical laboratory setting with a high volume of false positive alerts, staff are conditioned to expect that the vast majority of alerts do not signify a true problem. This leads to a routine dismissal of alerts, thereby undermining the primary purpose of the quality monitoring system. The low PPV demonstrates that the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio is very poor; for every $100$ alerts investigated, on average, fewer than $4$ will correspond to a real error. This high investigative burden for a low yield of true positives directly contributes to alert fatigue. The danger is that a rare but clinically significant true error, when it does occur and trigger an alert, is more likely to be overlooked, potentially leading to the release of an incorrect patient result. This analysis underscores the fundamental challenge in designing automated alert systems for rare events: optimizing sensitivity to catch errors often leads to a low PPV (especially when prevalence is low), which can paradoxically compromise safety by inducing alert fatigue.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03107}\n$$", "id": "5220249"}, {"introduction": "Our initial models for delta checks account for biological and analytical variation, but real-world systems can introduce other sources of 'noise'.

This rounding process can be modeled by adding a rounding error, $E_{R,i}$, to the unrounded measurement:\n$$R_i = M_i + E_{R,i}$$\nThe problem states that the rounding error can be treated as independent of $M_i$. For rounding to the nearest integer, the error $E_{R,i}$ is well-approximated by a continuous uniform distribution over the interval $[-\\Delta/2, \\Delta/2]$. With $\\Delta=1$, we have:\n$$E_{R,i} \\sim U(-0.5, 0.5)$$\nThe mean of this distribution is $0$. The variance of a uniform distribution $U(a,b)$ is $(b-a)^2/12$.
