To prioritize risk-reduction efforts using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), the team assigns ordinal ratings on a scale from $1$ to $10$ for Severity $(S)$, Occurrence $(O)$, and Detection $(D)$, where higher values represent greater risk impact, more frequent occurrence, and poorer detectability, respectively. Risk prioritization requires aggregating $S$, $O$, and $D$ into a single scalar measure that is strictly increasing in each argument, treats the ratings as independent contributors, and preserves proportional changes when any one factor is scaled while others are held fixed.\n\nStarting from these foundational FMEA assumptions and the principle that expected consequence scales with both impact and frequency while worsening detectability should increase the priority measure, derive the simplest aggregation expression that satisfies independence, monotonicity, and proportionality in $S$, $O$, and $D$. Then, for centrifuge imbalance incidents rated $S=8$, $O=3$, and $D=4$, compute the baseline risk priority value.\n\nAdditionally, consistent with Lean and Six Sigma principles in laboratory diagnostics, propose $2$ concrete actions targeting reductions in $O$ and $D$ for this failure mode.

We begin from core definitions and properties:\n\n- $S$ (Severity) is an ordinal score of impact per occurrence.\n- $O$ (Occurrence) is an ordinal score proportional to how frequently the failure mode appears.\n- $D$ (Detection) is an ordinal score where higher values correspond to poorer detectability; therefore risk priority should increase with $D$.\n- The aggregation should be strictly increasing in each argument and reflect independence of the contributory dimensions, meaning changing one dimension while holding others fixed should have a proportional, separable effect on $R$.\n- In risk assessment, expected consequence scales with both impact and frequency; detectability acts as an amplifying factor when detection is poor (higher $D$), indicating higher priority for mitigation.\n\nTo obtain a minimal functional form consistent with these axioms, we require:\n\n1. Monotonicity: If $S$ increases with $O$ and $D$ fixed, $R$ increases; similarly in $O$ and $D$.\n2. Proportionality and separability: A change in one rating should scale $R$ by a factor dependent only on that rating; mathematically, this suggests a multiplicative separation:\n   $$R(S,O,D) = k \\, f(S) \\, g(O) \\, h(D),$$\n   for some positive constant $k$ and strictly increasing positive functions $f$, $g$, $h$.\n3. Ordinality and simplicity: Ratings are on the same bounded ordinal scale from $1$ to $10$ and are intended to be directly comparable contributors. The simplest choice consistent with proportional scaling is linear in each rating:\n   $$f(S)=S,\\quad g(O)=O,\\quad h(D)=D.$$\n\nWith these choices and with normalization $k=1$ (since the ratings are already scaled and dimensionless), the aggregation reduces to the standard Risk Priority Number (RPN) form:\n$$R(S,O,D) = S \\times O \\times D.$$\n\nNow compute the baseline value for the given centrifuge imbalance ratings $S=8$, $O=3$, and $D=4$:\n$$R(8,3,4) = 8 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24 \\times 4 = 96.$$\n\nLean and Six Sigma actions targeting reductions in $O$ and $D$ for this failure mode can include:\n\n- Occurrence reduction ($O$):\n  - Implement standardized rotor balancing and tube loading Standard Work with visual controls and mistake-proofing (for example, keyed buckets that enforce symmetric loading), plus preventive maintenance scheduling based on usage hours to reduce imbalance frequency.\n- Detection improvement ($D$):\n  - Install vibration/imbalance sensors with automatic spin abort and alarm interlocks, and require a pre-spin checklist with tactile confirmation of bucket symmetry; incorporate Statistical Process Control (SPC) monitoring of spin vibration signatures to detect emerging issues earlier.\n\nThese actions aim to reduce $O$ and $D$, thereby lowering $R(S,O,D)$ according to the multiplicative structure derived above.
