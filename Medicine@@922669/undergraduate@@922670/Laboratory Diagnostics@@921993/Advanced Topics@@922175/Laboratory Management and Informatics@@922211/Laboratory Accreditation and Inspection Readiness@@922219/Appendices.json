To determine the combined measurement uncertainty, we will calculate the standard uncertainty contribution, $u_i$, from each of the five specified sources. These components are assumed to be independent, so their variances will be summed to find the combined variance, $u_c^2$.\n\nThe model for the combined variance is:\n$$u_c^2 = u_{\\text{cal}}^2 + u_{\\text{rep}}^2 + u_{\\text{br}}^2 + u_{\\text{dilution}}^2 + u_{\\text{matrix}}^2$$\n\nWe will now derive each component variance.\n\n1.  **Calibrator Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{cal}}$)**\n    The calibrator certificate gives an expanded uncertainty $U_{\\text{cal,cert}} = 1.50 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$ at a coverage factor of $k=2$ for a calibrator concentration of $c_{\\text{cal}} = 100.0 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. The standard uncertainty of the calibrator's assigned value is:\n    $$u(c_{\\text{cal}}) = \\frac{U_{\\text{cal,cert}}}{k} = \\frac{1.50 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}}{2} = 0.75 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n    This is treated as a multiplicative scale uncertainty. We calculate its relative standard uncertainty:\n    $$u_{\\text{rel}}(c_{\\text{cal}}) = \\frac{u(c_{\\text{cal}})}{c_{\\text{cal}}} = \\frac{0.75}{100.0} = 0.0075$$\n    This relative uncertainty propagates to the patient result, $c$. The absolute standard uncertainty contribution from the calibrator is:\n    $$u_{\\text{cal}} = c \\times u_{\\text{rel}}(c_{\\text{cal}}) = 98.0 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} \\times 0.0075 = 0.735 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n    The variance is $u_{\\text{cal}}^2 = (0.735)^2 = 0.540225 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$.\n\n2.  **Repeatability Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{rep}}$)**\n    The standard deviation of a single measurement is given as $s_{\\text{rep}} = 1.8 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. The patient result is the mean of $m=3$ replicate measurements. The standard uncertainty of the mean (Type A uncertainty) is:\n    $$u_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{s_{\\text{rep}}}{\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{1.8 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n    The variance is $u_{\\text{rep}}^2 = \\frac{(1.8)^2}{3} = \\frac{3.24}{3} = 1.08 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$.\n\n3.  **Between-Run Variation Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{br}}$)**\n    The long-term standard deviation from quality control data is $s_{\\text{br}} = 1.2 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. This component accounts for variability between analytical runs and is not reduced by averaging replicates within a single run. Thus, its standard uncertainty contribution is directly the standard deviation itself:\n    $$u_{\\text{br}} = s_{\\text{br}} = 1.2 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n    The variance is $u_{\\text{br}}^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$.\n\n4.  **Dilution Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{dilution}}$)**\n    The dilution factor is $D = \\frac{V_s + V_d}{V_s}$, where $V_s$ is the sample volume and $V_d$ is the diluent volume. The reported concentration $c$ is directly proportional to $D$. Therefore, the relative uncertainty in $c$ due to dilution equals the relative uncertainty in $D$: $u_{\\text{rel}}(c)_{\\text{dilution}} = u_{\\text{rel}}(D) = u(D)/D$.\n\n    First, we find the standard uncertainties for the volumes. Both are given with tolerances that define a rectangular distribution. For a rectangular distribution with semi-width $a$, the standard uncertainty is $u = a / \\sqrt{3}$.\n    For sample volume $V_s=200 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ with tolerance $\\pm 0.6 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$:\n    $$u(V_s) = \\frac{0.6 \\, \\mu\\text{L}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n    For diluent volume $V_d=800 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$ with tolerance $\\pm 2.4 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$:\n    $$u(V_d) = \\frac{2.4 \\, \\mu\\text{L}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n    The total volume is $V_{\\text{total}} = V_s + V_d = 1000 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$. Since $V_s$ and $V_d$ are independent, the variance of the total volume is:\n    $$u(V_{\\text{total}})^2 = u(V_s)^2 + u(V_d)^2 = \\frac{(0.6)^2}{3} + \\frac{(2.4)^2}{3} = \\frac{0.36 + 5.76}{3} = \\frac{6.12}{3} = 2.04 \\, (\\mu\\text{L})^2$$\n    The dilution factor is $D = V_{\\text{total}} / V_s$. The inputs $V_{\\text{total}}$ and $V_s$ are correlated because $V_s$ is a component of $V_{\\text{total}}$. The covariance is $u(V_s, V_{\\text{total}}) = \\text{cov}(V_s, V_s+V_d) = \\text{var}(V_s) = u(V_s)^2$. We have $u(V_s)^2 = (0.6)^2/3 = 0.12 \\, (\\mu\\text{L})^2$.\n\n    The law of propagation for a quotient $D = V_{\\text{total}}/V_s$ with correlated inputs gives the relative variance as:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{u(D)}{D}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{u(V_{\\text{total}})}{V_{\\text{total}}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u(V_s)}{V_s}\\right)^2 - 2 \\frac{u(V_s, V_{\\text{total}})}{V_s V_{\\text{total}}}$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{u(D)}{D}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2.04}{(1000)^2} + \\frac{0.12}{(200)^2} - 2\\frac{0.12}{200 \\times 1000}$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{u(D)}{D}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2.04}{1000000} + \\frac{0.12}{40000} - \\frac{0.24}{200000} = 2.04 \\times 10^{-6} + 3.0 \\times 10^{-6} - 1.2 \\times 10^{-6} = 3.84 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n    The uncertainty contribution to the concentration is $u_{\\text{dilution}} = c \\times \\frac{u(D)}{D}$. The variance contribution is:\n    $$u_{\\text{dilution}}^2 = c^2 \\left(\\frac{u(D)}{D}\\right)^2 = (98.0)^2 \\times (3.84 \\times 10^{-6}) = 9604 \\times 3.84 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 0.036879 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$$\n\n5.  **Matrix Effects Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{matrix}}$)**\n    A potential bias is estimated as $\\pm 2.0 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$ and is modeled with a symmetric triangular distribution of semi-width $a=2.0 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. The standard uncertainty for this distribution is $u = a / \\sqrt{6}$.\n    $$u_{\\text{matrix}} = \\frac{2.0 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}}{\\sqrt{6}}$$\n    The variance is $u_{\\text{matrix}}^2 = \\frac{(2.0)^2}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666667 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$.\n\n**Combined and Expanded Uncertainty**\nNow, we sum the individual variances to get the combined variance $u_c^2$:\n$$u_c^2 = u_{\\text{cal}}^2 + u_{\\text{rep}}^2 + u_{\\text{br}}^2 + u_{\\text{dilution}}^2 + u_{\\text{matrix}}^2$$\n$$u_c^2 = 0.540225 + 1.08 + 1.44 + 0.036879 + 0.666667 = 3.763771 \\, (\\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})^2$$\nThe combined standard uncertainty $u_c$ is the square root of this value:\n$$u_c = \\sqrt{3.763771} \\approx 1.93999 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $u_c = 1.94 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, the expanded uncertainty $U$ is calculated using the given coverage factor $k=2$:\n$$U = k \\times u_c = 2 \\times 1.93999 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} \\approx 3.87998 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $U = 3.88 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final values required are the combined standard uncertainty $u_c$ and the expanded uncertainty $U$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$u_c \\approx 1.94 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$\n$U \\approx 3.88 \\, \\mu\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.94  3.88\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5228654"}]}
