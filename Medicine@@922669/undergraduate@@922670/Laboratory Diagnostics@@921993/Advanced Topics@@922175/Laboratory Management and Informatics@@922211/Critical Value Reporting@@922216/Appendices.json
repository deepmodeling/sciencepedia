A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe resting membrane potential of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, under the simplifying assumption that it is dominated by potassium ion flux, can be approximated by the potassium equilibrium potential, $E_K$. This potential is described by the Nernst equation:\n\n$$E_{K} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right)$$\n\nHere, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion (for $K^{+}$, $z = +1$), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $[K^{+}]_{o}$ and $[K^{+}]_{i}$ are the extracellular and intracellular potassium concentrations, respectively.\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in this potential, $\\Delta E$, when the extracellular potassium concentration drops from a typical value, $[K^{+}]_{o,1} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, to a value indicative of marked hypokalemia, $[K^{+}]_{o,2} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The change is defined as:\n\n$$\\Delta E = E_{K}([K^{+}]_{o,2}) - E_{K}([K^{+}]_{o,1})$$\n\nSubstituting the Nernst equation for each term:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\left( \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,2}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,1}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) \\right)$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$ and use the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(\\frac{a}{b})$ to simplify the expression:\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,2}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,1}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left( \\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,2}/[K^{+}]_{i}}{[K^{+}]_{o,1}/[K^{+}]_{i}} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o,2}}{[K^{+}]_{o,1}}\\right)$$\n\nThis simplified form shows that the change in equilibrium potential depends only on the ratio of the two extracellular concentrations, not on the intracellular concentration. Now, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $z = 1$\n- $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $[K^{+}]_{o,1} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n- $[K^{+}]_{o,2} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(1)(96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}}{4.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}}\\right)$$\n\nThe units of the pre-factor are $\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}}$, which is equal to Volts ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{2577.34}{96485}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\ln(0.55)$$\n$$\\Delta E \\approx (0.026712\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\cdot (-0.597837)$$\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -0.015969\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$). To convert from Volts to millivolts, we multiply by $1000$:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -0.015969 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -15.969\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx -16.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\n**Argument regarding the critical value:**\nThe calculated change, $\\Delta E = -16.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, represents a significant hyperpolarization of the cardiomyocyte resting membrane potential. A typical resting potential is approximately $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (calculated with $[K^{+}]_{o} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). The drop to $[K^{+}]_{o} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ would shift this potential to approximately $-106\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. While hyperpolarization moves the cell further from the threshold for firing a normal action potential, this state is paradoxically pro-arrhythmic. The increased negativity enhances the activity of certain ion channels (e.g., the hyperpolarization-activated \"funny\" current, $I_f$), which can promote abnormal automaticity. Furthermore, severe hypokalemia prolongs the repolarization phase of the action potential, increasing the risk of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes. The substantial magnitude of this voltage shift, driven by a change in potassium that is clinically defined as severe hypokalemia, provides a strong biophysical justification for establishing a lower critical value near $2.5\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. Such a policy ensures that clinicians are immediately notified of a condition that poses an imminent risk of lethal cardiac arrhythmia, allowing for prompt corrective action.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-16.0} $$", "id": "5219417"}, {"introduction": "Critical value reporting hinges on the confidence that a result reflects the patient's true state, not an artifact.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine a new, adjusted lower critical limit, $L_{\\text{adj}}$, for serum potassium such that the probability of a false critical call for a non-critical sample is no more than $0.05$.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the measurement error, $\\varepsilon$. The problem states that $\\varepsilon$ is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of zero. Its standard deviation, $\\sigma$, corresponds to the standard measurement uncertainty, $u(y)$. The relationship between the expanded uncertainty $U$, the coverage factor $k$, and the standard uncertainty $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$U = k \\sigma$$\nGiven $U = 0.2$ mmol/L and $k = 2$, we can calculate the standard deviation of the measurement error:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{U}{k} = \\frac{0.2 \\, \\text{mmol/L}}{2} = 0.1 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$$\nSo, the measurement error follows a normal distribution $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, (0.1)^2)$.\n\nNext, we formalize the \"producer risk\". The producer risk is the probability of incorrectly classifying a result as critical when the true value $x$ is at or above the lower critical limit $L$. A result is called critical if the measured value $y  L_{\\text{adj}}$. Therefore, the producer risk is $P(y  L_{\\text{adj}} \\mid x \\geq L)$. We are required to ensure this risk is no greater than $0.05$:\n$$P(y  L_{\\text{adj}} \\mid x \\geq L) \\leq 0.05$$\nThe probability of obtaining a measured value $y  L_{\\text{adj}}$ for a given true value $x$ is:\n$$P(y  L_{\\text{adj}} \\mid x) = P(x + \\varepsilon  L_{\\text{adj}}) = P(\\varepsilon  L_{\\text{adj}} - x)$$\nSince $\\varepsilon$ is a normal random variable with mean $0$, this probability increases as the term $L_{\\text{adj}} - x$ increases, which means the probability increases as $x$ decreases. To ensure the condition $P(y  L_{\\text{adj}} \\mid x \\geq L) \\leq 0.05$ holds for all $x \\geq L$, we must satisfy the condition for the worst-case scenario, which is the value of $x$ in the acceptable range $[L, \\infty)$ that maximizes the probability. This maximum occurs at the lowest possible value of $x$, which is $x=L$.\nThus, the constraint simplifies to:\n$$P(y  L_{\\text{adj}} \\mid x = L) \\leq 0.05$$\nSubstituting the measurement model $y = x + \\varepsilon$ with $x=L$:\n$$P(L + \\varepsilon  L_{\\text{adj}}) \\leq 0.05$$\n$$P(\\varepsilon  L_{\\text{adj}} - L) \\leq 0.05$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\varepsilon$ by defining a standard normal variable $Z = \\frac{\\varepsilon - 0}{\\sigma}$. The inequality becomes:\n$$P\\left(Z  \\frac{L_{\\text{adj}} - L}{\\sigma}\\right) \\leq 0.05$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, representing $P(Z \\leq z)$. The condition is $\\Phi\\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{adj}} - L}{\\sigma}\\right) \\leq 0.05$.\nTo find the value of $L_{\\text{adj}}$ that meets this condition while being as close as possible to $L$ (i.e., making the guard band as small as necessary), we set the probability to its maximum allowed value:\n$$\\Phi\\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{adj}} - L}{\\sigma}\\right) = 0.05$$\nThis means that the term $\\frac{L_{\\text{adj}} - L}{\\sigma}$ must be equal to the $5^{th}$ percentile of the standard normal distribution, denoted as $z_{0.05}$. This value is the inverse CDF evaluated at $0.05$, $\\Phi^{-1}(0.05)$. From standard statistical tables, $z_{0.05} \\approx -1.645$.\nSo, we have the equation:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\text{adj}} - L}{\\sigma} = z_{0.05}$$\nSolving for $L_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{adj}} = L + \\sigma \\cdot z_{0.05}$$\nNow we can substitute the numerical values: $L = 2.5$ mmol/L, $\\sigma = 0.1$ mmol/L, and $z_{0.05} \\approx -1.645$.\n$$L_{\\text{adj}} = 2.5 + (0.1) \\cdot (-1.645)$$\n$$L_{\\text{adj}} = 2.5 - 0.1645$$\n$$L_{\\text{adj}} = 2.3355 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to three significant figures.
