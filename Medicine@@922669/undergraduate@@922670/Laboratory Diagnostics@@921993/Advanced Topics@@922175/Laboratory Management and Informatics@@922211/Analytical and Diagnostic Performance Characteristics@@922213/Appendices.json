Assume replicate measurements at three target concentrations are obtained under stable conditions. You are given eight within-run replicates at each concentration of analyte mass concentration in nanograms per milliliter, denoted $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$: low target around $2.0 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$, medium around $20.0 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$, and high around $200.0 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.

Then, using the replicates above, compute this metric, the Coefficient of Variation (CV), for each concentration stratum.

Round your final value of $H$ to three significant figures and report it as a decimal without a percentage sign and without units.", "solution": "The problem requires a justification for using the Coefficient of Variation (CV) to assess imprecision in a system with multiplicative error, followed by the calculation of specific CVs and a heteroscedasticity index $H$.\n\nFirst, we address the theoretical justification. A proportional or multiplicative error structure implies that the magnitude of the measurement error is proportional to the true value of the quantity being measured. Let the true analyte concentration be $\\mu$. A single measurement, $X$, can be modeled as:\n$$X = \\mu \\cdot \\epsilon$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless random error term. For the measurement to be unbiased, the expected value of the error term must be $1$, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 1$. The variability of the error term is captured by its variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2$. We assume that this error term $\\epsilon$ is independent of the true concentration $\\mu$.\n\nFrom this model, we can derive the expected value and variance of the measurement $X$. The expected value (a measure of location) is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu \\cdot \\epsilon] = \\mu \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = \\mu \\cdot 1 = \\mu$$\nThe variance of the measurement (the square of a measure of scale) is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mu \\cdot \\epsilon) = \\mu^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\mu^2 \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2$$\nThe standard deviation ($\\mathrm{SD}$) of the measurement is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\mathrm{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{\\mu^2 \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2} = |\\mu| \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$$\nSince concentration $\\mu$ must be non-negative, this simplifies to $\\mathrm{SD}(X) = \\mu \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThis result shows that the standard deviation of the measurements is directly proportional to the mean concentration $\\mu$. In such cases of heteroscedasticity (error changing with magnitude), the standard deviation itself is not a good metric for comparing imprecision across different concentration levels. A dimensionless metric is required. The Coefficient of Variation ($\\mathrm{CV}$) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SD}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]}$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for the multiplicative error model:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\mu \\sigma_{\\epsilon}}{\\mu} = \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$$\nThis demonstrates that for a pure multiplicative error structure, the $\\mathrm{CV}$ is constant across all concentration levels and is equal to the standard deviation of the underlying multiplicative error term, $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}$. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{CV}$, which is a ratio of a scale parameter ($\\mathrm{SD}$) to a location parameter (mean), is the appropriate dimensionless metric for characterizing imprecision because it remains stable across the measurement range.\n\nNext, we compute the required sample statistics from the provided data. The sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) for a set of $n$ measurements $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ are given by:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\nThe sample Coefficient of Variation is then $\\mathrm{CV} = s / \\bar{x}$.\n\nFor the low concentration stratum, the data are: $1.92, 1.98, 2.05, 2.10, 1.95, 2.02, 2.08, 1.99$.

The first step is to establish the theoretical framework based on the provided definitions and the assumption of Gaussian measurement error.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing a measured concentration. We assume that for a sample with a true concentration $C$, the measurement $X$ follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $C$ and some standard deviation $\\sigma$, i.e., $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(C, \\sigma^2)$. The problem states that the standard deviation for low-level concentrations is denoted by $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$.\n\nThe Limit of Blank (LoB) is given as $\\mathrm{LoB} = 0.060 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. It is defined as the $95\\%$ upper quantile of the blank measurement distribution. A blank sample has a true concentration of $C=0$. Let $X_{\\text{blank}}$ be the measurement of a blank. Then $X_{\\text{blank}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}^2)$. The definition implies $P(X_{\\text{blank}} \\leq \\mathrm{LoB}) = 0.95$. Standardizing the variable gives $P\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{blank}} - 0}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}} \\leq \\frac{\\mathrm{LoB}}{\\sigma_{\\text{blank}}}\\right) = 0.95$. For a standard normal variable $Z$, $P(Z \\leq z_{0.95}) = 0.95$, where $z_{0.95}$ is the critical value for $95\\%$ cumulative probability. Thus, $\\mathrm{LoB} = z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{blank}}$. The commonly used value for $z_{0.95}$ is approximately $1.645$.\n\nThe Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the smallest true concentration $C = \\mathrm{LoD}$ at which the probability that a measured result exceeds the LoB is $0.95$. This corresponds to a false-negative rate $(\\beta)$ of $1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. Let $X_{\\text{LoD}}$ be the measurement of a sample with true concentration LoD. Then $X_{\\text{LoD}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathrm{LoD}, \\sigma_{\\text{low}}^2)$. The definition is stated as $P(X_{\\text{LoD}} > \\mathrm{LoB}) = 0.95$.\nStandardizing this variable, we get:\n$$ P\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{LoD}} - \\mathrm{LoD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}} > \\frac{\\mathrm{LoB} - \\mathrm{LoD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.95 $$\nLet $Z$ be a standard normal variable. The value $z_{crit}$ for which $P(Z > z_{crit}) = 0.95$ is the $5^{th}$ percentile of the distribution, which is $z_{0.05} = -z_{0.95} \\approx -1.645$.\nTherefore, we have the relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{LoB} - \\mathrm{LoD}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}} = -z_{0.95} $$\nRearranging for LoD, we obtain the formula for its calculation:\n$$ \\mathrm{LoD} = \\mathrm{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}} $$\nTo compute the LoD, we need an estimate for $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$. This is obtained by calculating the sample standard deviation ($s$) from one of the provided low-level sets.\n\nThe next step is to select the most appropriate low-level set. The standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ should represent the measurement variability at a concentration near the LoD. The ideal low-level sample for estimating this parameter should therefore have a true concentration close to the expected LoD. Since $\\mathrm{LoD} = \\mathrm{LoB} + z_{0.95}\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, the LoD must be greater than the LoB of $0.060 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n- Low-level set L1 has a nominal concentration of $0.050 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$, which is below the LoB. This set is not ideal as it is likely below the true LoD.\n- Low-level set L3 has a nominal concentration of $0.200 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. This is over $3$ times the LoB. In many analytical methods, measurement variability increases with concentration (heteroscedasticity). Using this set might overestimate $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, leading to an inflated LoD value.\n- Low-level set L2 has a nominal concentration of $0.080 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. This value is modestly above the LoB and is a plausible candidate for a concentration near the LoD. It aligns with CLSI guidelines which suggest using samples with concentrations in the range of $1$ to $5$ times the LoB.\n\nTherefore, we select low-level set L2 as the most appropriate for estimating $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$. Its concentration is close to the decision threshold (LoB) but distinctly above it, providing the most relevant estimate of variance for determining the LoD.\n\nNow we calculate the sample standard deviation, $s_{\\text{L2}}$, from the L2 data: $\\{0.071, 0.079, 0.086, 0.104, 0.091, 0.081\\}$, with $n=6$ replicates.\nFirst, we find the sample mean, $\\bar{x}_{\\text{L2}}$:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{\\text{L2}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^6 x_i = \\frac{0.071 + 0.079 + 0.086 + 0.104 + 0.091 + 0.081}{6} = \\frac{0.512}{6} \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL} $$\nNext, we calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean, $\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x}_{\\text{L2}})^2$.
