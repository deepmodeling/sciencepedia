The PT provider reports an assigned value of $50$ and a program standard deviation used for proficiency assessment of $2$. Your laboratory’s reported result for the PT sample is $53$. In interlaboratory performance assessment, standardization is used to compare an individual result to a reference by expressing the difference in units of the dispersion measure, and many PT schemes classify performance using an absolute standard score threshold, where results with $|z| \\le 2$ are considered acceptable.\n\nUsing only first principles of standardization from statistics as applied in laboratory quality assessment, compute the standard score $z$ for your laboratory’s result relative to the assigned value and the given dispersion.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistics as applied to laboratory quality assurance, is well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the standard score, or $z$-score, for a laboratory's reported result in a Proficiency Testing (PT) program. The standard score is a dimensionless quantity that quantifies the deviation of an individual data point from the mean of a distribution, measured in terms of standard deviations. The fundamental formula for the $z$-score of an observation $x$, relative to a distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, is given by:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values to compute this score:\n1.

The program standard deviation, which is the measure of dispersion $\\sigma$ used for the assessment. We are given $\\sigma = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these given values into the standard score formula yields:\n$$z = \\frac{53 - 50}{2}$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator, which represents the deviation of the laboratory's result from the assigned value:\n$$53 - 50 = 3$$\n\nNext, we divide this deviation by the standard deviation:\n$$z = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the exact value of the $z$-score:\n$$z = 1.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. Expressing $1.5$ to $3$ significant figures gives $1.50$.\n\nThe problem also introduces a performance criterion where a result is considered acceptable if its absolute standard score is less than or equal to $2$, i.e., $|z| \\le 2$. We can check if the laboratory's performance meets this criterion.\nThe absolute value of the calculated $z$-score is:\n$$|z| = |1.50| = 1.50$$\nSince $1.50 \\le 2$, the laboratory's performance is classified as acceptable according to the specified criterion.

The sigma-metric provides a powerful, integrated measure of quality by relating a method's observed random error ($CV$) and systematic error (bias) to the total allowable error ($TEa$). Mastering the sigma-metric calculation allows you to grade method performance on a universal scale, guiding critical decisions about method selection and quality control strategy [@problem_id:5229950].", "problem": "A laboratory manager is evaluating a new chemistry analyzer method within a clinical laboratory diagnostics service. As part of method performance assessment and selection of appropriate statistical quality control procedures, the manager wishes to compute the method’s sigma-metric, a dimensionless indicator of quality that connects allowable performance specifications to observed imprecision and systematic error.\n\nStart from the core definitions:\n- Total Allowable Error (TEa) is a performance specification that represents the maximum combined impact of systematic error and random error that can be tolerated without compromising clinical use.\n- Bias is the systematic error, defined as the absolute difference between the method’s mean and a reference target, expressed relative to the measurand.\n- Coefficient of Variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed relative to the measurand, and represents the size of one standard deviation in relative units.\n\nUsing these definitions and the conceptual interpretation that the portion of the allowable error not consumed by bias constitutes the remaining margin for random error, derive an expression for the sigma-metric $SM$ in terms of $TEa$, $\\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert$, and $CV$.

The concepts of Total Allowable Error ($TEa$), bias, Coefficient of Variation ($CV$), and the sigma-metric ($SM$) are standard, well-established principles in laboratory medicine, analytical chemistry, and quality management, particularly within the Six Sigma framework. The relationship described is the fundamental definition of a process sigma level in this context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear definitions and a conceptual model from which a unique mathematical expression can be derived. The data provided ($TEa$, bias, $CV$) are sufficient for calculating a single, meaningful value for the sigma-metric.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with objective and precise language. All terms are defined, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions, constraints, and data. There are no contradictions. The values are given in consistent relative units (percentages), which is standard practice.\n- **Realism**: The provided values ($TEa = 10\\%$, $\\text{bias} = 2\\%$, $CV = 3\\%$) are realistic for many common clinical chemistry analytes, making the scenario plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent setup. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins from the conceptual model provided. The Total Allowable Error, $TEa$, represents the total \"error budget\". The systematic error, represented by the absolute value of the bias, $\\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert$, consumes a portion of this budget. The remaining portion is the margin available to accommodate random error.\n\nLet the margin for random error be denoted by $M_R$. According to the problem statement:\n$$ M_R = TEa - \\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert $$\nThe Coefficient of Variation, $CV$, represents the magnitude of one standard deviation of random error, expressed in the same relative units as $TEa$ and $\\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert$.\n\nThe sigma-metric, $SM$, is a dimensionless quantity that quantifies how many standard deviations of random error can fit into the allowable margin for random error, $M_R$. Therefore, the sigma-metric is the ratio of the random error margin to the size of a single standard deviation:\n$$ SM = \\frac{M_R}{CV} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_R$, we arrive at the general formula for the sigma-metric:\n$$ SM = \\frac{TEa - \\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert}{CV} $$\nThis expression fulfills the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we evaluate this expression using the provided values:\n- $TEa = 10\\%$\n- $\\text{bias} = 2\\%$, which implies $\\lvert \\text{bias} \\rvert = 2\\%$ since bias is given as a positive value representing a magnitude.\n- $CV = 3\\%$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ SM = \\frac{10\\% - 2\\%}{3\\%} $$\nSince all terms are expressed in the same units of percent, the units cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless value for $SM$, as required.\n$$ SM = \\frac{10 - 2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\nThe value of the sigma-metric is $\\frac{8}{3}$. This is an exact, simplified fraction.\n\nFor interpretative purposes, as requested by the prompt, we can classify this result. The value $\\frac{8}{3}$ is approximately $2.667$.

The total variable costs are the product of the variable cost per test, $V$, and the number of tests, $Q$.\n$$ TC = F + (V \\times Q) $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $TR$ and $TC$ into the profit equation gives:\n$$ P = (R \\times Q) - (F + V \\times Q) $$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$ P = (R - V) \\times Q - F $$\nThe term $(R - V)$ is known as the contribution margin per unit, which is the amount each test contributes towards covering fixed costs and generating profit.\n\nUsing the given values:\n$R = \\$280$\n$V = \\$200$\n$Q = 500$\n$F = \\$20,000$\n\nFirst, calculate the contribution margin per test:\n$$ R - V = \\$280 - \\$200 = \\$80 $$\n\nNow, calculate the monthly operating profit, $P$:\n$$ P = (\\$80 \\text{ per test}) \\times (500 \\text{ tests}) - \\$20,000 $$\n$$ P = \\$40,000 - \\$20,000 $$\n$$ P = \\$20,000 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the break-even monthly test volume, which we will denote as $Q_{BE}$. The break-even point is the volume of tests at which the total revenue equals the total costs, resulting in a profit of zero ($P=0$).\nSetting the profit equation to zero:\n$$ 0 = (R - V) \\times Q_{BE} - F $$\nSolving for $Q_{BE}$:\n$$ (R - V) \\times Q_{BE} = F $$\n$$ Q_{BE} = \\frac{F}{R - V} $$\n\nUsing the given values for $F$ and the calculated contribution margin $(R - V)$:\n$$ F = \\$20,000 $$\n$$ R - V = \\$80 $$\n$$ Q_{BE} = \\frac{\\$20,000}{\\$80 \\text{ per test}} $$\n$$ Q_{BE} = 250 \\text{ tests} $$\n\nThus, the monthly operating profit for the test line is $\\$20,000$, and the break-even volume is $250$ tests per month.
