The assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service times are standard for this model. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($\\lambda$ and $\\mu$) to calculate the desired quantity (expected TAT). A crucial condition for the existence of a steady-state solution in an M/M/1 queue is that the arrival rate must be less than the service rate, i.e., $\\lambda  \\mu$. In this case, $22/\\text{hour}  28/\\text{hour}$, so this condition is met. Therefore, a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective terminology from queueing theory and laboratory diagnostics. No subjective or opinion-based statements are present.\n4.  **Other Flaws:** The problem is complete, consistent, realistic, and formally structured. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe system is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with arrival rate $\\lambda$ and service rate $\\mu$. The traffic intensity, denoted by $\\rho$, is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\n$$\nFor a steady-state solution to exist, the traffic intensity must be less than $1$, which means $\\lambda  \\mu$. With the given values $\\lambda = 22/\\text{hour}$ and $\\mu = 28/\\text{hour}$, we have:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{22}{28} = \\frac{11}{14} \\approx 0.7857\n$$\nSince $\\rho  1$, the system is stable and will reach a steady state.\n\nThe turnaround time (TAT) is defined as the total time a specimen spends in the system. In queueing theory, this is denoted by $W$. The expected total time in the system, $W$, is the sum of the expected time spent waiting in the queue, $W_q$, and the expected service time, $T_s$.\n$$\nW = W_q + T_s\n$$\nFor a service time that is exponentially distributed with rate $\\mu$, the expected service time is its mean, which is:\n$$\nT_s = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$\nThus, we can write:\n$$\nW = W_q + \\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$\nTo find $W_q$, we employ Little's Law, which relates the expected number of items in a system to the expected time spent in that system. For the queue specifically, Little's Law states:\n$$\nL_q = \\lambda W_q\n$$\nwhere $L_q$ is the expected number of specimens in the queue. This can be rearranged to find $W_q$:\n$$\nW_q = \\frac{L_q}{\\lambda}\n$$\nOur task now reduces to finding an expression for $L_q$. We first find the steady-state probabilities, $P_n$, for having $n$ specimens in the system (in queue plus in service). For an M/M/1 queue, these probabilities are given by a geometric distribution:\n$$\nP_n = (1-\\rho)\\rho^n \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThe expected number of specimens in the entire system, $L$, is the mean of this distribution:\n$$\nL = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P_n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n (1-\\rho)\\rho^n = (1-\\rho) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n\n$$\nThe summation is a known arithmetico-geometric series result: $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n x^n = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}$ for $|x|1$.\n$$\nL = (1-\\rho) \\left( \\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\rho)^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}\n$$\nNow we relate the expected number in the system, $L$, to the expected number in the queue, $L_q$. The total number of items in the system is the sum of the number in the queue and the number in service. By linearity of expectation, $L = L_q + L_s$, where $L_s$ is the expected number of items in service. The number of items in service is either $1$ (if the system is not empty) or $0$ (if the system is empty). The probability that the system is not empty is $1-P_0 = 1 - (1-\\rho)\\rho^0 = \\rho$. Therefore, the expected number in service is $L_s = 1 \\cdot P(\\text{system not empty}) + 0 \\cdot P(\\text{system empty}) = \\rho$.\n$$\nL = L_q + \\rho\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho} = L_q + \\rho\n$$\nSolving for $L_q$:\n$$\nL_q = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho} - \\rho = \\frac{\\rho - \\rho(1-\\rho)}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{\\rho - \\rho + \\rho^2}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{\\rho^2}{1-\\rho}\n$$\nNow we can compute $W_q$ using $W_q = L_q / \\lambda$:\n$$\nW_q = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\rho^2}{1-\\rho} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{(\\lambda/\\mu)^2}{1 - \\lambda/\\mu} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^2/\\mu^2}{(\\mu-\\lambda)/\\mu} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\mu^2} \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu-\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu-\\lambda)}\n$$\nFinally, we can find the expected total time in the system, $W$:\n$$\nW = W_q + T_s = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu-\\lambda)} + \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\lambda + (\\mu-\\lambda)}{\\mu(\\mu-\\lambda)} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu(\\mu-\\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\mu-\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental expression for the expected steady-state TAT in an M/M/1 system, derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\lambda = 22 \\text{ hour}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = 28 \\text{ hour}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{28 - 22} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in minutes. We perform the conversion:\n$$\nW_{\\text{minutes}} = W_{\\text{hours}} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{hour}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 60 = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\nThe final step is to report this value rounded to four significant figures.

The solution can now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet us define the relevant events and parameters using mathematical notation.\n- Let $A$ be the event that a patient's TSH result is abnormal. We are given the probability $\\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.15$.\n- Let $N$ be the event that a patient's TSH result is normal.

The calculated value $9.585$ already has four significant figures ($9$, $5$, $8$, $5$). Thus, the expected cost is $9.585$ USD.\n\n#### 2. Diagnostic Yield\nThe diagnostic yield, $Y$, is defined as the fraction of patients for whom the protocol produces a definitive abnormal free T4 result.

The condition for an observation $x_i$ to be an outlier is:\n$$ |x_i - \\tilde{x}|  3 \\times \\text{MAD} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the median and MAD:\n$$ |x_i - 102|  3 \\times 10 $$\n$$ |x_i - 102|  30 $$\nWe now check each data point's absolute deviation (from the set $D$) against this threshold of $30$. The deviations greater than $30$ are:\n$48$, $58$, $108$, and $318$.\nThese correspond to the following original TAT values:\n- For TAT=$150$: $|150 - 102| = 48$, which is $ 30$. This is an outlier.\n- For TAT=$160$: $|160 - 102| = 58$, which is $ 30$. This is an outlier.\n- For TAT=$210$: $|210 - 102| = 108$, which is $ 30$. This is an outlier.\n- For TAT=$420$: $|420 - 102| = 318$, which is $ 30$. This is an outlier.\n\nThere are $4$ TAT values that are flagged as outliers under this policy.\n\n**Justification of Robustness**\nThis approach is robust to right-skew for two primary reasons related to the definitions of the median and MAD.\n1.  **Robustness of the Median:** The sample median is determined by the rank order of the data, not the magnitude of all data points. As the $50^{\\text{th}}$ percentile, it is only influenced by the value(s) in the middle of the sorted distribution. Extreme values, such as the large TATs ($210$ and $420$ minutes) caused by reflex testing, do not pull the median upwards in the same way they would pull the arithmetic mean. The mean incorporates the magnitude of every point, making it sensitive to outliers, whereas the median is resistant.\n2.  **Robustness of the MAD:** The MAD is the median of the absolute deviations. Just like the sample median, it is not affected by the magnitude of extreme deviations. A few very large deviations (e.g., $108$ and $318$) do not inflate the MAD, as they are simply treated as high-ranking values in the set of deviations. In contrast, the standard deviation squares the deviations, giving disproportionately large weight to outliers and causing the measure of spread to become heavily inflated by them.\n\nBecause both the measure of central tendency (median) and the measure of scale (MAD) are resistant to the influence of extreme values, the resulting outlier detection rule is stable and reflects the properties of the bulk of the data, correctly identifying the few extreme points without being distorted by them. This makes the method ideal for skewed distributions like TAT data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "5239179"}]}
