The serum volume is $0.60$ milliliters, and the measured IgG concentration specific to the target antigen is $0.50$ milligrams per milliliter. Assume the molar mass of IgG is $1.50 \\times 10^{5}$ grams per mole. The RBCs express the relevant antigen at a density of $6.0 \\times 10^{5}$ antigen sites per RBC, but only a fraction $0.85$ of these sites are accessible under the chosen adsorption conditions. Assume that under the adsorption conditions each accessible antigen site can bind at most one IgG molecule and that binding is effectively stoichiometric at equilibrium for the purposes of capacity estimation.\n\nThe technologist will use a suspension of packed RBCs at a hematocrit (Hct) of $0.40$ (that is, RBCs occupy a volume fraction of $0.40$ of the suspension). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the RBCs is $90$ femtoliters. Take the Avogadro constant to be $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ per mole and note that $1$ femtoliter equals $10^{-15}$ liters and $1$ liter equals $10^{3}$ milliliters.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that hematocrit is the RBC volume fraction and mean corpuscular volume is the average volume per RBC, determine the minimal volume of the RBC suspension (in milliliters) required to provide enough accessible antigen sites to adsorb at least $0.95$ of all IgG molecules present in the serum. Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures. Express the final volume in milliliters.", "solution": "The determination of the minimal volume of the red blood cell (RBC) suspension requires a systematic calculation. The logical steps are as follows: first, calculate the total number of IgG molecules that must be removed from the serum; second, determine the number of RBCs required to provide the necessary number of accessible antigen binding sites; third, calculate the total volume of these packed RBCs; and finally, use the hematocrit to find the required volume of the RBC suspension.\n\n**1. Calculate the number of IgG molecules to be adsorbed.**\n\nThe total mass of IgG in the serum sample is the product of the serum volume, $V_{serum}$, and the IgG concentration, $C_{IgG}$. We must ensure consistent units.\nThe mass of IgG, $m_{IgG}$, is:\n$$m_{IgG} = V_{serum} \\times C_{IgG} = (0.60 \\text{ mL}) \\times (0.50 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}) = 0.30 \\text{ mg}$$\nTo find the number of moles, we convert the mass to grams ($1 \\text{ mg} = 10^{-3} \\text{ g}$) and divide by the molar mass, $M_{IgG}$.\n$$m_{IgG} = 0.30 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ g}$$\nThe total moles of IgG, $n_{IgG, total}$, are:\n$$n_{IgG, total} = \\frac{m_{IgG}}{M_{IgG}} = \\frac{0.30 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ g}}{1.50 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ g/mol}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol}$$\nThe total number of IgG molecules, $N_{IgG, total}$, is found by multiplying the number of moles by the Avogadro constant, $N_A$.\n$$N_{IgG, total} = n_{IgG, total} \\times N_A = (2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ mol}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}) = 1.2044 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ molecules}$$\nThe problem requires adsorbing a fraction $f_{adsorb} = 0.95$ of these molecules.

Determine the total number of RBCs required.**\n\nThe problem states that binding is stoichiometric, with one IgG molecule binding to one accessible antigen site. Therefore, the number of required accessible antigen sites, $N_{sites, req}$, equals the number of IgG molecules to be adsorbed.\n$$N_{sites, req} = N_{IgG, adsorb} \\approx 1.14418 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ sites}$$\nEach RBC has $D_{antigen} = 6.0 \\times 10^5$ antigen sites, but only a fraction $f_{access} = 0.85$ are accessible. The number of accessible sites per RBC, $N_{sites/RBC}$, is:\n$$N_{sites/RBC} = D_{antigen} \\times f_{access} = (6.0 \\times 10^5 \\text{ sites/RBC}) \\times 0.85 = 5.1 \\times 10^5 \\text{ sites/RBC}$$\nThe total number of RBCs required, $N_{RBC}$, is the total number of required sites divided by the number of accessible sites per RBC.\n$$N_{RBC} = \\frac{N_{sites, req}}{N_{sites/RBC}} = \\frac{1.14418 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ sites}}{5.1 \\times 10^5 \\text{ sites/RBC}} \\approx 2.24349 \\times 10^9 \\text{ RBCs}$$\n\n**3.

We must first convert the $MCV$ to milliliters.\nGiven $1 \\text{ fL} = 10^{-15} \\text{ L}$ and $1 \\text{ L} = 10^3 \\text{ mL}$, we have:\n$$MCV = 90 \\text{ fL} = 90 \\times (10^{-15} \\text{ L}) = 90 \\times 10^{-15} \\times (10^3 \\text{ mL}) = 90 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ mL}$$\nNow, we can calculate the packed RBC volume:\n$$V_{RBC, packed} = N_{RBC} \\times MCV = (2.24349 \\times 10^9 \\text{ RBCs}) \\times (90 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{RBC}})$$\n$$V_{RBC, packed} \\approx 201.914 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mL} \\approx 0.201914 \\text{ mL}$$\n\n**4. Calculate the minimal volume of the RBC suspension.**\n\nThe hematocrit, $Hct$, is defined as the volume fraction of RBCs in the suspension:\n$$Hct = \\frac{V_{RBC, packed}}{V_{suspension}}$$\nTo find the minimal volume of the suspension, $V_{suspension}$, we rearrange this formula:\n$$V_{suspension} = \\frac{V_{RBC, packed}}{Hct} = \\frac{0.201914 \\text{ mL}}{0.40} \\approx 0.504785 \\text{ mL}$$\n\n**Final Answer Rounding**\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V_{suspension} \\approx 0.505 \\text{ mL}$$\nThis represents the minimal volume of the specified RBC suspension required to adsorb at least $95\\%$ of the autoantibody from the patient's serum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.505}$$", "id": "5202617"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the numbers, selecting the correct adsorption strategy is paramount, especially in complex clinical cases. This practice presents a scenario where a patient's recent transfusion history makes a simple autoadsorption unsafe, as it could mask a dangerous alloantibody [@problem_id:5202673]. You will explore how to choose and design an optimal alloadsorption procedure, a critical skill for resolving antibody identification challenges in transfused patients.", "problem": "A patient presents with panreactivity in the indirect antiglobulin test that is consistent with a warm-reactive autoantibody, and the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is positive for Immunoglobulin G (IgG). The patient was transfused $14$ days earlier. You are tasked with preparing an adsorption to remove the warm autoantibody from the patient’s plasma to allow detection of any underlying alloantibodies. You must select and prepare Red Blood Cells (RBCs) to optimize the removal of autoantibody while minimizing the unintended adsorption of clinically significant alloantibodies.\n\nBegin from the following fundamental bases and core definitions relevant to immunohematology and laboratory diagnostics:\n\n- Antigen–antibody binding follows an equilibrium in which the association constant $K_a$ satisfies $K_a = \\dfrac{[AB]}{[A][B]}$, where $[A]$ is free antibody, $[B]$ is available antigen sites, and $[AB]$ is antigen–antibody complex.\n- Warm-reactive IgG antibodies exhibit optimal binding near $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ because $K_a$ for IgG–RBC antigen interactions is favored at physiologic temperature; cold-reactive Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies largely bind at temperatures below $30^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n- Reduction of the effective ionic shielding (zeta potential) between RBCs and antibodies increases the probability of productive collisions and complex formation; Low Ionic Strength Saline (LISS) and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) promote adsorption by enhancing effective binding (increasing $[AB]$ for a given $[A]$ and $[B]$).\n- Proteolytic enzymes such as ficin or papain enhance expression of certain antigens (e.g., Rh, Kidd, Lewis) and reduce others (e.g., MNSs, Duffy), thereby altering $[B]$. Dithiothreitol (DTT) reduces disulfide bonds, destroying Kell antigens and thus preventing Kell-specific adsorption.\n- Chloroquine diphosphate treatment dissociates IgG from RBC surfaces to facilitate antigen typing but does not increase antigen density or reduce zeta potential for adsorption from plasma.\n- Autoadsorption using patient RBCs is contraindicated after recent transfusion (e.g., within the prior $3$ months) because the patient’s RBCs may include donor RBCs carrying antigens the patient does not have, risking removal of alloantibodies.\n\nThe patient’s phenotype is partially known and suggests an Rh-positive profile, but complete extended phenotyping is not yet available due to the positive DAT. You must choose the RBC selection and preparation strategy for adsorption. Which option best achieves removal of warm autoantibody while preserving potential clinically significant alloantibodies, under scientifically sound conditions?\n\nA. Use the patient’s own RBCs, untreated, incubated at $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ for $60$ minutes in normal ionic strength saline to perform autoadsorption.\n\nB. Use phenotype-selected group O donor RBCs representing $R_1R_1$ (DCe/DCe), $R_2R_2$ (DcE/DcE), and $rr$ (dce/dce), treat them with the combined Dithiothreitol (DTT) and proteolytic enzyme reagent (commonly called ZZAP), then incubate the adsorptions at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), repeating sequential adsorptions until panreactivity resolves.\n\nC. Use Kell-positive $R_1R_1$ donor RBCs treated only with chloroquine diphosphate, incubated at $25^\\circ\\text{C}$ in high ionic strength saline, performing a single adsorption.\n\nD. Use the patient’s RBCs treated with DTT alone and incubate at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ without enzyme augmentation, performing a single autoadsorption.\n\nE. Use group AB donor RBCs treated with papain (no DTT), incubated at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ in Low Ionic Strength Saline (LISS), selecting only $R_1R_1$ phenotype cells for adsorption.", "solution": "Starting from the equilibrium $K_a = \\dfrac{[AB]}{[A][B]}$, the goal in adsorption is to maximize the formation of antigen–antibody complexes $[AB]$ between the warm autoantibody in the patient’s plasma (species $[A]$) and selected RBC antigens (species $[B]$) that represent the autoantibody’s targets. Warm autoantibodies are typically broad-reacting IgG that bind optimally at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$, thus increasing $K_a$ and favoring higher $[AB]$. Enhancing adsorption uses strategies that increase effective antigen availability $[B]$ (enzyme treatment, multiple Rh antigen combinations), reduce the zeta potential (use of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) or Low Ionic Strength Saline (LISS)), and ensure proper incubation temperature for IgG ($37^\\circ\\text{C}$). At the same time, preservation of clinically significant alloantibodies requires avoiding adsorption to targeted antigens the patient may lack, such as Kell, to prevent depletion of potential anti-K. Dithiothreitol (DTT) destroys Kell antigens (via reduction of disulfide bonds), ensuring that anti-K in plasma is not adsorbed, while proteolytic enzymes (ficin/papain) elevate expression of Rh antigens and decrease zeta potential, increasing the effective $[B]$ for warm autoantibody adsorption.\n\nAutoadsorption is contraindicated when the patient has been transfused within the prior $3$ months because the patient’s RBCs can be a mixture of autologous and donor RBCs. Using mixed RBC populations risks removing alloantibodies directed against donor antigens, thereby compromising detection of underlying alloantibodies. Therefore, alloadsorption using carefully selected donor RBCs (e.g., group O cells representing common Rh phenotypes $R_1R_1$, $R_2R_2$, $rr$) is preferred in this scenario.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Use the patient’s own RBCs, untreated, incubated at $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ for $60$ minutes in normal ionic strength saline to perform autoadsorption.\n- Principle analysis: Autoadsorption with patient RBCs is contraindicated after recent transfusion (the patient was transfused $14$ days prior, within $3$ months). Untreated RBCs may retain bound IgG and complement on the surface, reducing available antigen sites $[B]$. Incubation at $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ favors IgM binding rather than IgG; warm autoantibodies (IgG) have reduced $K_a$ at $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, lowering $[AB]$. Normal ionic strength saline maintains a higher zeta potential, decreasing productive collisions.\n- Verdict: Incorrect, due to safety (recent transfusion), inappropriate temperature for IgG, and suboptimal ionic strength.\n\nB. Use phenotype-selected group O donor RBCs representing $R_1R_1$ (DCe/DCe), $R_2R_2$ (DcE/DcE), and $rr$ (dce/dce), treat them with the combined Dithiothreitol (DTT) and proteolytic enzyme reagent (commonly called ZZAP), then incubate the adsorptions at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), repeating sequential adsorptions until panreactivity resolves.\n- Principle analysis: Alloadsorption with group O donor RBCs avoids ABO antigen interactions that could remove IgG anti-A/anti-B if present, maintaining focus on warm autoantibody removal. Using multiple Rh phenotype RBCs ($R_1R_1$, $R_2R_2$, $rr$) increases the representation of Rh antigens, increasing effective $[B]$ for warm autoantibody binding. ZZAP (DTT plus enzyme) removes any bound IgG/complement from the adsorbing RBCs (increasing $[B]$) and enhances antigen exposure; critically, DTT destroys Kell antigens, preserving any anti-K alloantibody in plasma. Incubation at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ maximizes $K_a$ for IgG; PEG reduces zeta potential and excludes water, increasing effective collisions and $[AB]$. Repeated sequential adsorptions progressively reduce $[A]$ (autoantibody concentration) until panreactivity is resolved, which is standard practice.\n- Verdict: Correct, optimally balancing adsorption efficiency with alloantibody preservation under scientifically sound conditions.\n\nC. Use Kell-positive $R_1R_1$ donor RBCs treated only with chloroquine diphosphate, incubated at $25^\\circ\\text{C}$ in high ionic strength saline, performing a single adsorption.\n- Principle analysis: Chloroquine diphosphate is used to dissociate IgG from RBCs for antigen typing, not to enhance adsorption from plasma; it does not increase antigen density nor reduce zeta potential effectively for adsorption. Incubation at $25^\\circ\\text{C}$ compromises IgG binding ($K_a$ is reduced compared with $37^\\circ\\text{C}$). High ionic strength saline increases ionic shielding, maintaining higher zeta potential and decreasing effective collisions. Using Kell-positive RBCs risks adsorbing anti-K, depleting a clinically significant alloantibody.\n- Verdict: Incorrect, due to suboptimal temperature, ionic strength, and risk of removing anti-K.\n\nD. Use the patient’s RBCs treated with DTT alone and incubate at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ without enzyme augmentation, performing a single autoadsorption.\n- Principle analysis: Although DTT would destroy Kell antigens (preserving anti-K), autoadsorption remains contraindicated after recent transfusion. Without proteolytic enzyme, Rh antigen expression and reduction of zeta potential are less enhanced, reducing adsorption efficiency (lower effective $[B]$ and fewer productive collisions). A single adsorption may be insufficient to remove a broad warm autoantibody.\n- Verdict: Incorrect, primarily due to recent transfusion and insufficient enhancement of adsorption.\n\nE. Use group AB donor RBCs treated with papain (no DTT), incubated at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ in Low Ionic Strength Saline (LISS), selecting only $R_1R_1$ phenotype cells for adsorption.\n- Principle analysis: Papain enhances Rh antigen expression and LISS lowers zeta potential, both favoring adsorption ($[AB]$ increase). However, group AB RBCs express A and B antigens; any IgG anti-A or anti-B in plasma could be adsorbed unintentionally. Without DTT, Kell antigens persist, risking adsorption of anti-K. Using only $R_1R_1$ misses coverage of other Rh antigen combinations ($R_2R_2$, $rr$), potentially reducing $[B]$ diversity and adsorption effectiveness for broad autoantibodies.\n- Verdict: Incorrect, due to risk of removing ABO and Kell alloantibodies and insufficient Rh coverage.\n\nTherefore, option B best satisfies the scientific requirements for effective and safe adsorption in this transfused patient with a warm IgG autoantibody.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5202673"}, {"introduction": "After recovering an antibody from red blood cells via elution, the final step is to determine its identity.

An acid eluate is prepared from the patient’s red blood cells (RBC; red blood cell) using a standard glycine-acid method and tested by the anti-human globulin (AHG; anti-human globulin) phase at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ against a 10-cell reagent panel. The reagent cell antigen profiles include the Rhesus (Rh; Rhesus) antigens and selected non-Rh antigens. The following observations are made:\n\n- Of the 10 reagent cells, 9 are $e+$ and 1 is $e-$ by phenotype. The eluate reacts at $2+$ with each of the 9 $e+$ cells and shows $0$ reactivity with the single $e-$ cell.\n- After ficin enzyme treatment of the same reagent panel (ficin enhances expression of certain antigens and destroys others), the eluate’s reactivity increases to $3+$ with each $e+$ cell and remains $0$ with the $e-$ cell.\n- Parallel testing shows that Duffy Fy(a) antigen-bearing cells do not exhibit a consistent pattern: the eluate’s reactivity with Fy(a)+ versus Fy(a)- cells tracks the $e$ status, not the Fy(a) status, and any weak reactivity observed in pre-enzyme tests does not persist after ficin treatment.\n- The patient’s RBC phenotype for Rh antigens is $D+$, $C-$, $E-$, $c+$, $e+$.\n\nUsing adsorption and elution principles, the immunohematology laboratory wants to determine whether the eluate’s apparent “cross-reactivity” across many reagent cells reflects a specific antibody or non-specific binding, and to choose a confirmatory step. Base your reasoning on the following foundational facts:\n\n- Adsorption is the reversible binding of antibody to antigen on a solid phase (RBC surface), governed by the law of mass action, where the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ of antigen sites by antibody increases with antibody concentration and affinity (lower dissociation constant $K_D$) and with antigen site density.\n- Elution recovers antibody from antigen by altering conditions (e.g., pH), and the recovered antibody reflects what was actually bound in vivo or in vitro.\n- Enzyme treatment with ficin typically enhances reactivity to Rh antigens (e.g., $D$, $C$, $E$, $c$, $e$), Kidd ($Jk$), Lewis ($Le$), and P system antigens by increasing accessibility or removing sialic acid, while destroying or markedly reducing reactivity to Duffy ($Fy$) and MNS system antigens ($M$, $N$, $S$, $s$).\n\nWhich of the following conclusions and confirmatory steps most parsimoniously explain the eluate’s cross-reactivity pattern and will appropriately validate the interpretation?\n\nA. The eluate contains a warm autoantibody with apparent specificity to the high-prevalence Rh $e$ antigen; confirm by adsorbing the eluate with $e$-positive RBCs at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ to abolish reactivity and demonstrate specificity.\n\nB. The eluate contains an anti-Fy(a) alloantibody; confirm by demonstrating that reactivity persists or increases after ficin treatment of reagent cells, which is characteristic of Duffy antibodies.\n\nC.

The eluate contains non-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM; Immunoglobulin M) causing complement-mediated panreactivity; confirm by repeating the DAT with anti-C3d and demonstrating strong positivity for complement binding.", "solution": "## Solution ##\n\nThe goal is to interpret the serological findings and identify the most appropriate confirmatory test.\n\n1.  **Initial Interpretation of DAT and Elution:** The patient has hemolysis and a positive `DAT` for `IgG` only (negative `C3d`). This indicates the presence of an `IgG` antibody coating the patient's `RBCs` in vivo, causing them to be cleared from circulation (hemolysis). This is characteristic of Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (`WAIHA`). The purpose of the acid elution is to recover this specific `IgG` antibody from the patient's `RBC` surface for identification. The resulting eluate therefore contains the causative autoantibody.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Eluate Reactivity Pattern:** The eluate was tested against a 10-cell panel. The reactivity pattern is unambiguous: it reacts with all 9 cells positive for the $e$ antigen and does not react with the single cell negative for the $e$ antigen. This constitutes strong evidence that the antibody has specificity for the $e$ antigen.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Enzyme Treatment Effect:** The reactivity with $e+$ cells is enhanced (from $2+$ to $3+$) after the cells are treated with the ficin enzyme. According to the foundational principles provided, ficin enhances reactivity to `Rh` system antigens. Since $e$ is an `Rh` antigen, this observation further supports the conclusion that the antibody is an anti-$e$. This finding also helps rule out antibodies to antigens destroyed by enzymes, such as those in the Duffy (`Fy`) or MNS systems. The specific note about `Fy(a)` confirms this, stating that reactivity tracks $e$ status and is destroyed by ficin, which is inconsistent with an anti-Fy(a).\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Identification of Antibody:**\n    - The antibody reacts at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and is of the `IgG` class, making it a \"warm\" antibody.\n    - It has a clear specificity for the $e$ antigen.\n    - The patient's own `RBCs` are $e+$. Since the antibody was eluted from the patient's own cells, it must be an **autoantibody**.\n    - Therefore, the most parsimonious conclusion is that the eluate contains a **warm autoantibody with apparent anti-e specificity**. Autoantibodies frequently show specificity for common `Rh` antigens like $e$.\n\n5.  **Selection of a Confirmatory Test:** To confirm that an antibody has a specific reactivity pattern (i.e., its reactivity is entirely due to the named specificity), an **adsorption** experiment is the standard procedure.\n    - **Principle:** If the eluate truly contains only anti-$e$, incubating (adsorbing) it with `RBCs` that possess the $e$ antigen will cause the anti-$e$ to bind to these `RBCs` and be removed from the solution.\n    - **Procedure:** The eluate is incubated with an aliquot of $e+$ `RBCs` at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. After incubation and centrifugation, the supernatant (the adsorbed eluate) is tested against the original panel.\n    - **Expected Result:** If the hypothesis is correct, the anti-$e$ will have been removed from the eluate. The adsorbed eluate should now be non-reactive with all cells on the panel, including the $e+$ cells with which it was previously reactive. This abolishment of reactivity confirms the specificity.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis ##\n\n**A. The eluate contains a warm autoantibody with apparent specificity to the high-prevalence Rh $e$ antigen; confirm by adsorbing the eluate with $e$-positive RBCs at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ to abolish reactivity and demonstrate specificity.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement accurately reflects the derived conclusion. The antibody is warm ($37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, `IgG`), an autoantibody (eluted from the patient's own $e+$ cells), and has apparent specificity for the $e$ antigen based on the panel results. The proposed confirmatory test—adsorption with $e+$ `RBCs` at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ to show that reactivity is abolished—is the correct and definitive laboratory procedure to prove this specificity.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The eluate contains an anti-Fy(a) alloantibody; confirm by demonstrating that reactivity persists or increases after ficin treatment of reagent cells, which is characteristic of Duffy antibodies.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the foundational facts state that ficin *destroys* Duffy (`$Fy$`) antigens, so reactivity with Duffy antibodies would decrease or be abolished, not persist or increase. The observed reactivity *increased*. Second, the problem statement explicitly notes that the reactivity pattern does not correlate with `Fy(a)` status and that any weak reactivity is eliminated by ficin, directly refuting this hypothesis.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The eluate is contaminated with residual plasma anti-D from passive Rhesus immune globulin; confirm by showing non-reactivity with D-negative cells and specificity only to D-positive cells.**\n- **Analysis:** This is inconsistent with the data. The observed specificity is for the $e$ antigen, not the $D$ antigen. Furthermore, the patient is $D+$. An antibody eluted from a $D+$ patient's cells cannot be a passively acquired anti-$D$ from Rhesus immune globulin (which is given to D-negative individuals). It would have to be an auto-anti-$D$, but the serological pattern does not support this.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The eluate contains non-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM; Immunoglobulin M) causing complement-mediated panreactivity; confirm by repeating the DAT with anti-C3d and demonstrating strong positivity for complement binding.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contradicts the given information. The `DAT` was positive for `IgG`, not `IgM`. The `DAT` was explicitly *negative* for `C3d`, ruling out significant complement fixation. Finally, the eluate's reactivity is not \"panreactivity\" (reacting with all cells); it shows clear specificity for the $e$ antigen. The entire premise is flawed.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5202627"}]}
