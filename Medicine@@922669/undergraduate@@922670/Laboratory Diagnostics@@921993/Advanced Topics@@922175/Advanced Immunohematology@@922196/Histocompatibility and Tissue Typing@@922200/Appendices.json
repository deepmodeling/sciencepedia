[@problem_id:5224484]", "problem": "A laboratory evaluates Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) compatibility among siblings by considering the transmission of intact HLA haplotypes across the classical HLA region, which is a tightly linked segment on chromosome $6$. A haplotype is the ordered set of alleles across the HLA region carried on one chromosome. Let one parent carry haplotypes denoted by $H_1$ and $H_2$, and the other parent carry haplotypes denoted by $H_3$ and $H_4$. Consider two full siblings born to these parents. Assume the HLA region transmits as intact haplotypes per meiosis, consistent with tight linkage across the region and negligible recombination within this region.\n\nUsing only core genetic principles, specifically Mendel’s First Law of Segregation (each parent transmits one of its two haplotypes with probability $1/2$) and the independence of maternal and paternal transmissions, derive the exact probabilities that the two siblings are:\n- HLA-identical (the siblings inherit the same unordered pair of parental haplotypes),\n- haploidentical (the siblings share exactly one haplotype), and\n- mismatched (the siblings share no haplotypes),\n\nunder the assumption that recombination within the HLA region is negligible.\n\nNext, introduce a recombination fraction $r$ for the HLA region, where $r$ is the probability that, in a single meiosis, the transmitted gamete harbors a recombinant haplotype within the HLA region (that is, neither $H_1$ nor $H_2$ for the first parent, and neither $H_3$ nor $H_4$ for the second parent).

The problem setup is internally consistent. (Criterion fulfilled)\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The assumption of negligible recombination within the classical HLA region is a valid and common approximation, as the region exhibits strong linkage disequilibrium, meaning the recombination fraction $r$ is very small (typically $r \\approx 0.01$). (Criterion fulfilled)\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThis solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Probabilities with Negligible Recombination ($r = 0$)**\n\nLet the parents be Parent $P_A$ with haplotypes $\\{H_1, H_2\\}$ and Parent $P_B$ with haplotypes $\\{H_3, H_4\\}$. We assume the four haplotypes are distinct.\n\nAccording to Mendel's Law of Segregation, during meiosis, each parent transmits one of their two haplotypes to an offspring with equal probability.\n-   $P_A$ transmits $H_1$ with probability $1/2$ and $H_2$ with probability $1/2$.\n-   $P_B$ transmits $H_3$ with probability $1/2$ and $H_4$ with probability $1/2$.\n\nSince the maternal and paternal transmissions are independent, we can determine the possible genotypes for any child. The genotype is the unordered pair of haplotypes inherited. The four possible genotypes are:\n1.  $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$, with probability $P(H_1) \\times P(H_3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$, with probability $P(H_1) \\times P(H_4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$, with probability $P(H_2) \\times P(H_3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$, with probability $P(H_2) \\times P(H_4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet Sibling 1 ($S_1$) and Sibling 2 ($S_2$) be the two children. The genotype of $S_1$ is independent of the genotype of $S_2$. There are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ equally likely pairs of genotypes for the pair $(S_1, S_2)$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$. We can now calculate the required probabilities by counting the favorable outcomes.\n\n-   **HLA-identical (sharing 2 haplotypes):** This occurs if $S_1$ and $S_2$ have the exact same genotype. This corresponds to the cases where the genotype of $S_1$ is the same as the genotype of $S_2$. There are $4$ such cases on the diagonal of our $4 \\times 4$ possibility space: $(\\{H_1, H_3\\}, \\{H_1, H_3\\})$, $(\\{H_1, H_4\\}, \\{H_1, H_4\\})$, etc.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these $4$ outcomes:\n    $$P(\\text{identical}) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n-   **Mismatched (sharing 0 haplotypes):** This occurs if the set of haplotypes for $S_1$ is disjoint from the set for $S_2$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$. This pair of outcomes has probability $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these $4$ outcomes:\n    $$P(\\text{mismatched}) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n-   **Haploidentical (sharing 1 haplotype):** This is the only remaining possibility. The sum of probabilities for all outcomes must be $1$.\n    $$P(\\text{haploidentical}) = 1 - P(\\text{identical}) - P(\\text{mismatched})$$\n    $$P(\\text{haploidentical}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    Alternatively, there are $16$ total outcomes. We found $4$ are identical and $4$ are mismatched. The remaining $16 - 4 - 4 = 8$ outcomes must be haploidentical. The probability is therefore $\\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Recombination ($r > 0$)**\n\nLet $r$ be the recombination fraction for the HLA region per meiosis. The probability of transmitting an intact, non-recombinant haplotype is $(1-r)$. The probability of transmitting a recombinant haplotype is $r$. Since there are two parental haplotypes, the probability of transmitting a specific intact haplotype (e.g., $H_1$) is $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n\nThe classical probabilities of $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$ are conditional on four successful transmissions of intact parental haplotypes—one from each parent to each of the two siblings. Let us examine the validity of this condition.\n\n1.  Each sibling's genotype is the result of two meiotic events (one maternal, one paternal). For two siblings, a total of four meiotic events are involved.\n2.  The probability of a single meiotic event producing a non-recombinant gamete is $(1-r)$.\n3.  The probability of all four independent meiotic events producing non-recombinant gametes is $(1-r)^4$.\n4.  The probability of at least one recombination event occurring across these four meioses is $P(\\text{at least one recombo}) = 1 - (1-r)^4$.\n5.  Using the binomial expansion for $(1-r)^4 = 1 - 4r + 6r^2 - 4r^3 + r^4$, we find:\n    $$P(\\text{at least one recombo}) = 1 - (1 - 4r + 6r^2 - \\dots) = 4r - 6r^2 + \\dots$$\n6.  For small $r$ (as is the case for the HLA region), the higher-order terms $O(r^2)$ are negligible compared to the first-order term. Thus, the probability of having at least one recombination event is approximately $4r$. This is a probability of order $r$.\n\nAny deviation, or \"correction,\" to the classical probabilities derived in Part 1 must arise from these scenarios where one or more recombination events occur. Since the total probability of such scenarios is of order $r$, the net change to the probabilities of the three outcomes must also be of order $r$.\n\nTo be more specific, let's analyze the probability of being HLA-identical. The problem defines this state as the siblings \"must receive the same pair of intact haplotypes.\" This definition implies that for two siblings to be HLA-identical, all four haplotypes transmitted to them must be of the intact parental type.\n-   The probability that all four transmitted haplotypes are intact is, as derived, $(1-r)^4$.\n-   *Given* that all four are intact, the probabilities revert to the classical case calculated in Part 1. The conditional probability of being identical is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Therefore, the total probability of being HLA-identical with non-zero recombination is:\n    $$P(\\text{identical}, r>0) = P(\\text{identical}|r=0) \\times P(\\text{all 4 non-recombinant})$$\n    $$P(\\text{identical}, r>0) = \\frac{1}{4} (1-r)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - 4r + O(r^2)) = \\frac{1}{4} - r + O(r^2)$$\nThe correction to the classical probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $\\Delta P_{id} = -r + O(r^2)$, which is a term of order $r$.\n\nSince the sum of the probabilities must always be $1$, i.e., $P_{id}(r) + P_{hap}(r) + P_{mis}(r) = 1$, the sum of the corrections must be zero: $\\Delta P_{id} + \\Delta P_{hap} + \\Delta P_{mis} = 0$. As $\\Delta P_{id}$ is of order $r$, the sum $\\Delta P_{hap} + \\Delta P_{mis}$ must also be of order $r$, implying that the corrections to the other probabilities are also generally of order $r$. For a physically small region like HLA, $r$ is very small (e.g., $r < 0.01$), making corrections of this order negligible for most clinical purposes and justifying the use of the simple $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}$ fractions.\n\nThe final answer requires the probabilities for the case with negligible recombination ($r=0$).\n\nProbabilities for (HLA-identical, haploidentical, mismatched): $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5224484"}, {"introduction": "Accurate, high-resolution HLA typing is essential for matching donors and recipients, but the diploid nature of our genome presents unique technical challenges.

At the HLA-B locus, the specimen is heterozygous at two informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one in exon $2$ and one in exon $3$, separated by approximately $600$ base pairs (bp). The laboratory amplifies a region that includes both SNPs and sequences the pooled amplicons directly from both directions. The chromatograms show clear, balanced double peaks at each SNP (for example, the exon $2$ site shows $A/G$ and the exon $3$ site shows $C/T$ at approximately $50\\%$ each), but the allele assignment is ambiguous because it is unknown whether the exon $2$ and exon $3$ variants co-occur on the same chromosomal molecule.

It accurately describes a fundamental challenge in molecular genetics known as haplotype phasing. All the provided information, including the context of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing, the methodology of Sequence-Based Typing (SBT), the nature of the data (heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs), and the observed results (balanced double peaks in Sanger chromatograms), is consistent with established scientific principles and common laboratory practice. The foundational facts provided are correct and form the basis for a rigorous analysis. The problem is well-posed, objective, and Factual.\n\nThe core of the problem is the inability of standard Sanger sequencing on a mixed population of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplicons to determine the physical linkage of alleles on a chromosome. Let the two homologous chromosomes be $H_1$ and $H_2$. The specimen is heterozygous for a SNP in exon $2$ (let's denote the alleles as $E_2^A$ and $E_2^G$) and a SNP in exon $3$ (alleles $E_3^C$ and $E_3^T$). This means the genotype at these two loci is $(E_2^A/E_2^G, E_3^C/E_3^T)$. The phase ambiguity lies in determining which alleles are on the same chromosome. There are two possibilities for the haplotypes:\n\n1.  **Coupling (cis) phase:** The chromosomes are $H_1 = E_2^A - E_3^C$ and $H_2 = E_2^G - E_3^T$. The full genotype is $E_2^A E_3^C / E_2^G E_3^T$.\n2.  **Repulsion (trans) phase:** The chromosomes are $H_1 = E_2^A - E_3^T$ and $H_2 = E_2^G - E_3^C$. The full genotype is $E_2^A E_3^T / E_2^G E_3^C$.\n\nWhen PCR is performed on the genomic DNA, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ serve as templates, creating a pool of amplicon molecules. In either phase scenario, the pool contains a mixture of molecules. Sanger sequencing then analyzes this entire pool at once. At the exon $2$ position, the sequencer detects both $E_2^A$ and $E_2^G$ bases in approximately a $50\\%:50\\%$ ratio, resulting in a double peak. Similarly, at the exon $3$ position, it detects both $E_3^C$ and $E_3^T$ bases. The sequencing process does not preserve the information about which exon $2$ allele came from the same original molecule as which exon $3$ allele. Therefore, both phase possibilities produce identical Sanger results, leading to ambiguity.\n\nTo resolve phase, a technique must be employed that can ascertain the sequence of single DNA molecules spanning both polymorphic sites.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. In a diploid heterozygote with two biallelic SNPs $A/a$ and $B/b$, bulk Sanger SBT of pooled PCR products cannot distinguish whether the true haplotypes are $AB+ab$ versus $Ab+aB$ because the observed traces at each site are a $50\\%/50\\%$ superposition from two homologs; cloning individual amplicon molecules into plasmids and sequencing single colonies converts the mixed pool into single-molecule templates, thereby resolving phase.**\n\nThis statement is entirely correct. The first part accurately summarizes the problem of phase ambiguity as explained above. The second part proposes a valid classical solution. Molecular cloning involves inserting individual PCR amplicons into plasmids, which are then used to transform bacteria. Each resulting bacterial colony originates from a single bacterium that took up a single plasmid. Therefore, all plasmids within a colony are clones of one original amplicon molecule. By picking individual colonies and sequencing the plasmids, one is effectively sequencing single molecules from the original PCR pool. This physically separates the amplicons derived from the two different parental chromosomes, thereby resolving the phase. If sequencing of several colonies yields only haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$, the phase is determined.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increasing the number of PCR cycles to $45$ will preferentially amplify one allele, suppress double peaks, and thereby reliably reveal the correct phase across the two SNPs without additional controls.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that PCR can exhibit amplification bias, especially with a high number of cycles (e.g., $45$), this phenomenon, known as \"allelic dropout\" or \"stochastic amplification,\" is unpredictable and not a reliable method for phasing. One allele might be preferentially amplified in one experiment, while the other allele might be favored in a repeat experiment, or the bias may not be complete. Relying on an uncontrolled artifact for a diagnostic result is scientifically unsound and would lead to erroneous or non-reproducible allele assignments. Robust scientific methods require controlled, predictable outcomes.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Long-range PCR that spans both SNPs followed by Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing or Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing, which generate reads that traverse both SNPs on single DNA molecules, can directly resolve the phase between exon $2$ and exon $3$ variants.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The SNPs are separated by approximately $600$ base pairs (bp). Modern long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio SMRT sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, are designed to generate reads that are thousands or even tens of thousands of base pairs long. A read length well in excess of $600$ bp is routine for these platforms. By generating reads that span the entire region from exon $2$ to exon $3$ on a single molecule, these methods directly observe the haplotype. For example, a single read might contain the sequence ...$A$...$C$..., while another read contains ...$G$...$T$.... Aggregating many such reads provides a definitive determination of the haplotypes present and their relative abundance. This is a primary application of long-read sequencing.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Sequencing both forward and reverse strands by Sanger automatically resolves phase because reading both directions provides twice as much information to link the exon $2$ and exon $3$ bases on the same molecule.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Sequencing with both forward and reverse primers is standard practice for quality control and to obtain a full, high-quality consensus sequence of the amplicon. However, both sequencing reactions are performed on the same pooled PCR product, which contains a mixture of amplicons from both homologous chromosomes. While the reverse read provides the sequence of the complementary strand, it is still a superposition of signals from all molecules in the pool. It will show the same ambiguity (double peaks at heterozygous sites) as the forward read. It provides no information to link the SNP in exon $2$ to the SNP in exon $3$ on the same molecule.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Performing paired-end short-read Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) with $2 \\times 150$ bp reads and an average insert size of $300$ bp will link the exon $2$ and exon $3$ SNPs separated by $600$ bp and resolve phase by overlapping mates.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Paired-end sequencing reads the two ends of a DNA fragment of a certain length, known as the \"insert size.\" Here, the insert size is $300$ bp. For phasing to be possible with this method, a single DNA fragment (and its corresponding read pair) must contain information from both SNP loci. The SNPs are separated by $600$ bp. A fragment of only $300$ bp in length cannot possibly span two points that are $600$ bp apart. Therefore, no single read pair can provide linkage information between the exon $2$ and exon $3$ SNPs. For paired-end reads to phase two SNPs, the insert size must be larger than the distance between the SNPs, but this method as described is inadequate. The reads will not overlap and will not cover both variant sites within a single read-pair.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. Designing allele-specific primers that discriminate the exon $2$ SNP at the $3^{\\prime}$ end to amplify only a short amplicon confined within exon $2$ for each allele will resolve the phase between the exon $2$ and exon $3$ variants in this specimen.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The proposed technique is Allele-Specific PCR (AS-PCR). This method can indeed be used to selectively amplify DNA from one specific allele at the exon $2$ SNP. However, the option specifies that the resulting amplicon is \"confined within exon $2$\". If the amplified product does not extend to include the SNP in exon $3$, then no information about the exon $3$ allele can be obtained from it. Thus, this procedure cannot resolve the phase linkage between the two exons. To successfully use AS-PCR for phasing, one would need to use an allele-specific primer for the exon $2$ SNP paired with another primer located downstream of the exon $3$ SNP, thereby creating a long amplicon whose sequence would reveal the haplotype. The method as described in the option is flawed by design.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "5224466"}, {"introduction": "The final crossmatch before transplantation is a critical safety check, but interpreting the results is not always straightforward.

IgG is less efficient and typically requires multiple molecules in close proximity.\n2.  **HLA Antigen Expression:** T lymphocytes primarily express HLA class I antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C). B lymphocytes express both HLA class I and HLA class II antigens (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP).\n3.  **Antibody Isotypes:** IgM and IgG are the main immunoglobulin classes of interest. Clinically significant donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) that mediate rejection are typically IgG. IgM antibodies against HLA are often naturally occurring, transient, or not associated with graft rejection.\n4.  **Dithiothreitol (DTT):** This reducing agent cleaves disulfide bonds, which are critical for maintaining the pentameric structure of IgM. DTT treatment effectively inactivates IgM's ability to agglutinate or fix complement, while IgG, a monomer, is largely unaffected.\n\n**Analysis of Provided Data:**\n- **T-cell CDC Crossmatch: Negative.** T cells express only HLA class I. A negative T-cell CDC indicates the absence of significant levels of complement-fixing antibodies, of either IgM or IgG isotype, directed against the donor's HLA class I antigens.\n\n- **B-cell CDC Crossmatch: Positive ($50\\%$ lysis at neat, $30\\%$ at $1:2$, $0\\%$ at $1:4$).** B cells express both HLA class I and class II. Since the T-cell crossmatch was negative, the reactivity is unlikely to be against class I antigens. This points towards antibodies against HLA class II antigens or non-HLA antigens expressed on B cells. The low titer (activity disappears by $1:4$ dilution) is noted.\n\n- **AHG-CDC Crossmatch: T-cell negative; B-cell positive.** Anti-human globulin (AHG) is an antibody against human immunoglobulins. It cross-links IgG antibodies bound to the cell surface, enhancing their ability to fix complement. A negative AHG-CDC T-cell result further strengthens the conclusion that no clinically relevant anti-HLA class I IgG is present. A positive AHG-CDC B-cell result could suggest low levels of non-complement-fixing IgG against B cells (e.g., anti-class II), but it does not rule out an IgM-mediated cause.\n\n- **Flow Cytometric Crossmatch (FCXM) for IgG: T-cell negative; B-cell negative.** The FCXM is a more sensitive method than CDC for detecting antibody *binding*, irrespective of complement-fixing ability. A negative IgG FCXM for both T and B cells is very strong evidence against the presence of any significant amount of donor-specific IgG antibody, for both class I and class II antigens. This finding starts to contradict the hypothesis that the positive B-cell CDC is due to anti-HLA IgG.\n\n- **Luminex Single-Antigen Bead (SAB) Assay for anti-HLA IgG DSAs: Negative.** This is the most sensitive and specific solid-phase assay for detecting and identifying anti-HLA IgG antibodies. A negative result provides the most definitive evidence available that the recipient does not have circulating donor-specific IgG antibodies against any of the donor's HLA antigens.\n\n- **Autologous CDC Crossmatch: B-cell weakly positive ($\\approx 20\\%$ lysis).** The recipient's serum reacts with their own B lymphocytes. This indicates the presence of a B-cell specific *autoantibody*. A true donor-specific antibody would not react with the recipient's own cells (unless the donor and recipient share the target antigen by chance, and the antibody is an alloantibody that cross-reacts).\n\n- **Effect of DTT Treatment: B-cell CDC becomes negative.** DTT inactivates IgM. The fact that the B-cell CDC positivity is completely abrogated by DTT treatment is conclusive proof that the antibody responsible is an IgM, not an IgG.\n\n- **Panel Reactivity: Strong CDC against EBV-transformed B-cell lines; no reactivity against fresh B cells.** This is a classic pattern for a specific type of B-cell reactive non-HLA autoantibody. These IgM autoantibodies often recognize B-cell activation antigens or other determinants that are highly expressed on cultured, virally transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines but are absent or expressed at very low levels on resting, freshly isolated B cells. They are typically considered clinically insignificant for transplantation.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe collective evidence overwhelmingly points to a single conclusion: the positive B-cell CDC crossmatch is a \"false positive\" in the context of predicting transplant outcome. It is caused by a low-titer, B-cell-specific IgM autoantibody that is not directed against donor HLA antigens. This is supported by: 1) DTT sensitivity (proves IgM); 2) negative IgG-specific assays (FCXM, Luminex); 3) positive auto-crossmatch (proves auto-reactivity); and 4) characteristic reactivity pattern with EBV-transformed cell lines. Such antibodies are known artifacts in CDC crossmatching and do not pose a risk for antibody-mediated rejection.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. The pattern is best explained by high-titer donor-specific anti-HLA class II IgG; confirm by repeating CDC with anti-human globulin enhancement and, if negative at higher dilution ($\\geq 1:8$), proceed with transplantation.**\n**Incorrect.** This explanation is contradicted by multiple pieces of evidence. The titer is low, not high. Most importantly, the most sensitive tests for anti-HLA IgG (FCXM and Luminex SAB) were negative, and the DTT treatment proved the antibody is IgM, not IgG. The proposed confirmation step is illogical.\n\n**B. The pattern is most consistent with IgM cold-reactive autoantibodies and antibodies against EBV-related B-cell antigens causing false-positive B-cell CDC; confirm by DTT treatment to abolish IgM effects, performing FCXM to detect IgG-specific binding, and comparing reactivity against EBV-transformed B-cell lines versus freshly isolated donor B cells.**\n**Correct.** This option accurately synthesizes all the data. It correctly identifies the antibody as IgM, its auto-reactive nature, and its common target on transformed B cells, all of which explain the \"false-positive\" result. The confirmatory steps listed in this option are precisely the set of tests that were performed and led to the resolution of the case. They represent the standard-of-care approach to investigate and dismiss such a finding.\n\n**C. The pattern reflects a prozone effect from extremely high-titer donor-specific IgG; confirm by testing at higher dilutions and adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to block complement.**\n**Incorrect.** A prozone effect would show increased reactivity at higher dilutions, whereas the observed reactivity decreases with dilution. The negative IgG-specific tests (FCXM, Luminex) rule out extremely high-titer IgG. Adding EDTA is a control to show that lysis is complement-dependent; it does not resolve a prozone phenomenon.\n\n**D. The pattern is due to anti-complementary activity in the recipient serum causing pan-reactivity; confirm by heat-inactivating recipient complement and repeating CDC with exogenous complement as the sole source.**\n**Incorrect.** Anti-complementary serum would inhibit the assay, causing a false *negative*, not a false positive. The observed reactivity is specific to B-cells, not a pan-reactive effect. The proposed confirmation is a standard control but is irrelevant to explaining a positive result of this nature.\n\n**E. The pattern is due to Fc receptor-mediated binding of circulating immune complexes to donor B cells; confirm by pronase-treating donor B cells to reduce Fc receptor expression and repeating the CDC crossmatch.**\n**Incorrect.** While Fc receptor binding is a potential artifact, it is less likely to cause a positive CDC assay than a direct IgM-mediated effect. Most crucially, the DTT treatment result points directly and definitively to an IgM-mediated mechanism. The IgM pentamer does not typically bind to classical Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR). This explanation ignores the most conclusive piece of data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5224435"}]}
