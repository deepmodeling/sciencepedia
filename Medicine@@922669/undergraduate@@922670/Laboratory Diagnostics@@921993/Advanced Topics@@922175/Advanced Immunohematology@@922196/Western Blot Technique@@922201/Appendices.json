Relying on definitions and well-tested facts, consider the following scenario. In Western blotting, proteins separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) are transferred to a membrane with finite protein binding capacity. Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection yields a signal that is linear with respect to the transferred target protein mass up to a known upper bound.
