For Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status assessment in breast cancer, a locus-specific identifier probe targets the HER2 gene, while a centromere enumeration probe targets chromosome $17$ (CEP17).

The requirement to apply ASCO/CAP cutoffs relies on standard, established clinical guidelines, which are considered fundamental principles in this context. The problem is objective and contains no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. Let $h_i$ denote the integer count of HER2 signals in nucleus $i$ and $c_i$ denote the integer count of CEP17 signals in nucleus $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\nAccording to the problem statement, the sample mean is the arithmetic average of per-nucleus counts. Thus, the mean HER2 signals per nucleus, which we denote as $\\bar{H}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{H} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i $$\nSimilarly, the mean CEP17 signals per nucleus, denoted as $\\bar{C}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i $$\nThe problem asks for an expression that quantifies amplification by \"comparing HER2 counts to CEP17 counts\" and using \"normalization to a chromosomal reference.\" This standardly implies calculating the ratio of the target gene's average copy number to the reference chromosome's average copy number. This ratio corrects for aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), as a proportional increase in both HER2 and chromosome $17$ would not represent true gene amplification. The amplification quantity, which we will call $R$, is therefore the ratio of the mean HER2 count to the mean CEP17 count.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\bar{H}}{\\bar{C}} $$\nThis expression represents the derived amplification quantity. It is a dimensionless number.\n\nNext, we apply this expression to the provided dataset. The given values are:\n- Mean HER2 signals per nucleus, $\\bar{H} = 6.2$\n- Mean CEP17 signals per nucleus, $\\bar{C} = 2.1$\n- Number of nuclei, $N = 60$ (Note: this value is extraneous for calculating the ratio from the provided means, but confirms the adequacy of the sample size as per guidelines).\n\nSubstituting the given means into the derived expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{6.2}{2.1} $$\nCalculating the value of this ratio:\n$$ R \\approx 2.9523809523... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2 testing in breast cancer define a sample as positive for HER2 amplification if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is $\\ge 2.0$, with additional criteria based on the average HER2 copy number per cell. In this case, the calculated ratio is $R \\approx 2.952$, which is greater than or equal to the cutoff of $2.0$. Furthermore, the average HER2 signals per nucleus is $6.2$, which is well above the threshold of $4.0$ used to resolve certain equivocal cases.

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Expected Volume Fraction\n\nLet us set up a coordinate system where the $z$-axis is normal to the section. The section (slab) occupies the region $-\\frac{t}{2} \\le z \\le \\frac{t}{2}$. A nucleus is a sphere of radius $R$ with its center at a position $z_0$ on the $z$-axis. The total volume of a nucleus is $V_{\\text{nuc}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$.\n\nThe problem states that for the population of observed (intersecting) nuclei, the center position $z_0$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $\\left[-\\left(R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right), \\, R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right]$. The length of this interval is $L = \\left(R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\left(R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)\\right) = 2R+t$. The probability density function (PDF) for $z_0$ is therefore:\n$$\np(z_0) = \\frac{1}{2R+t} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad z_0 \\in \\left[-\\left(R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right), \\, R + \\frac{t}{2}\\right]\n$$\nand $p(z_0) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nWe need to find the volume of the nucleus that lies within the slab, $V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)$, as a function of its center's position $z_0$. This volume is found by integrating the area of the circular cross-sections of the sphere over the slab's thickness. The sphere's equation is $x^2 + y^2 + (z-z_0)^2 \\le R^2$. The area of a circular slice of the sphere at a plane $z$ is $A(z, z_0) = \\pi (R^2 - (z-z_0)^2)$, provided that the plane intersects the sphere, i.e., $|z-z_0| \\le R$.\n\nThe volume of the nucleus inside the slab is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{in}}(z_0) = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} A(z, z_0) \\, dz = \\int_{\\max(-t/2, z_0-R)}^{\\min(t/2, z_0+R)} \\pi (R^2 - (z-z_0)^2) \\, dz\n$$\nThe expected volume, $\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle$, is a weighted average of $V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)$ over all possible values of $z_0$, with the weighting given by the PDF $p(z_0)$:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{\\text{in}}(z_0) \\, p(z_0) \\, dz_0 = \\frac{1}{2R+t} \\int_{-(R+t/2)}^{R+t/2} V_{\\text{in}}(z_0) \\, dz_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)$, we get a double integral:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2R+t} \\int_{z_0 = -(R+t/2)}^{R+t/2} \\left[ \\int_{z = -t/2}^{t/2} \\pi (R^2 - (z-z_0)^2) \\, \\mathbb{I}(|z-z_0| \\le R) \\, dz \\right] dz_0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function. The domain of integration in the $(z, z_0)$ plane is the intersection of three regions:\n1.  Section slab: $-t/2 \\le z \\le t/2$\n2.  Observed nuclei centers: $-(R+t/2) \\le z_0 \\le R+t/2$\n3.  Sphere interior: $z-R \\le z_0 \\le z+R$\n\nDirectly evaluating this integral is cumbersome. A more elegant approach is to change the order of integration. Let's integrate with respect to $z_0$ first, for a fixed $z$. For any given $z$ within the slab (i.e., $|z| \\le t/2$), the range of centers $z_0$ for which the plane at $z$ intersects the nucleus is $z_0 \\in [z-R, z+R]$. We must also satisfy the condition that the nucleus is in the observed population, i.e., $|z_0| \\le R+t/2$.\nSince $|z| \\le t/2$, we have $z-R \\ge -t/2-R > -(R+t/2)$ and $z+R \\le t/2+R < R+t/2$. Therefore, for any $z$ inside the slab, the interval $[z-R, z+R]$ is fully contained within the interval $[-(R+t/2), R+t/2]$. The limits for the inner integral over $z_0$ are simply $z-R$ and $z+R$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi}{2R+t} \\int_{z=-t/2}^{t/2} \\left[ \\int_{z_0 = z-R}^{z+R} (R^2 - (z-z_0)^2) \\, dz_0 \\right] dz\n$$\nLet's evaluate the inner integral. Let $u = z_0-z$, so $du = dz_0$. The limits become $u=-R$ to $u=R$.\n$$\n\\int_{-R}^{R} (R^2 - u^2) \\, du = \\left[R^2 u - \\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_{-R}^{R} = \\left(R^3 - \\frac{R^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(-R^3 - \\frac{(-R)^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2R^3}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2R^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}R^3\n$$\nThis is $V_{\\text{nuc}}/\\pi$. So, the inner integral is a constant, independent of $z$: $\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{3}R^3\\right) = V_{\\text{nuc}}$.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the outer integral:\n$$\n\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2R+t} \\int_{z=-t/2}^{t/2} V_{\\text{nuc}} \\, dz = \\frac{V_{\\text{nuc}}}{2R+t} [z]_{-t/2}^{t/2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{nuc}}}{2R+t} \\left(\\frac{t}{2} - (-\\frac{t}{2})\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{nuc}} \\cdot t}{2R+t}\n$$\nThe expected fraction of a nucleus's volume that lies within the section, $f_{\\text{obs}}$, is the ratio of the average intersecting volume to the total nuclear volume:\n$$\nf_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle}{V_{\\text{nuc}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{nuc}} \\cdot t / (2R+t)}{V_{\\text{nuc}}} = \\frac{t}{2R+t}\n$$\nUsing the diameter $D=2R$, this can also be written as $f_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{t}{D+t}$.\n\n### Step 3: Justification for FISH Copy Number\n\nThe problem states that gene loci are \"uniformly and independently distributed throughout the nuclear volume.\" This is the crucial assumption. If the loci are uniformly distributed, the probability of finding any single locus within a given sub-volume is equal to the ratio of that sub-volume to the total volume.\nLet $N$ be the true copy number of a specific gene (the total number of loci) in a nucleus.\nFor a nucleus whose center is at $z_0$, the volume inside the section is $V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)$. The probability that a single locus is found within the section is $p(z_0) = V_{\\text{in}}(z_0) / V_{\\text{nuc}}$. The number of observed loci, $N_{\\text{obs}}$, for this specific nucleus follows a binomial distribution $B(N, p(z_0))$. The expected number of observed loci for this nucleus is $E[N_{\\text{obs}}|z_0] = N \\cdot p(z_0) = N \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)}{V_{\\text{nuc}}}$.\n\nThe overall expected fraction of copy number is the expectation of $N_{\\textobs}/N$ over the population of all intersecting nuclei, i.e., averaged over the distribution of $z_0$:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Fraction} = E\\left[\\frac{N_{\\text{obs}}}{N}\\right] = \\int p(z_0) E\\left[\\frac{N_{\\text{obs}}}{N} \\Big| z_0 \\right] dz_0 = \\int p(z_0) \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}(z_0)}{V_{\\text{nuc}}} dz_0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V_{\\text{nuc}}} \\int p(z_0) V_{\\text{in}}(z_0) dz_0 = \\frac{\\langle V_{\\text{in}} \\rangle}{V_{\\text{nuc}}} = f_{\\text{obs}}\n$$\nThus, $f_{\\text{obs}}$ directly predicts the expected fraction of the true copy number that will be observed in a FISH counting experiment under the stated assumptions.\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given:\n-   Nuclear diameter $D = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, so radius $R = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Section thickness $t = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nUsing the derived formula, the expected fraction is:\n$$\nf_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{t}{2R+t} = \\frac{t}{D+t} = \\frac{4}{10+4} = \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is $2 \\div 7 \\approx 0.2857142857...$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.2857$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2857}$$", "id": "4330821"}]}
