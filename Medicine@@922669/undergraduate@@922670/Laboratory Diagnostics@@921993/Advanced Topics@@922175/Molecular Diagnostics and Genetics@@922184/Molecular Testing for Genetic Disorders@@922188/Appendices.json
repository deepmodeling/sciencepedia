Ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at $260$ nm and $280$ nm is used to assess nucleic acid purity. Assume the Beer–Lambert law holds, where absorbance $A$ at wavelength $\\lambda$ satisfies $A_{\\lambda} = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}\\,c\\,\\ell$, with $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda}$ the mass-specific absorption coefficient, $c$ the mass concentration, and $\\ell$ the optical path length.\n\nYou are given the following empirically established, mass-specific absorption coefficients for pure dsDNA:\n- $\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} = 20$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$,\n- $\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} = 11.1$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$.\n\nFor a typical protein contaminant, use:\n- $\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{prot}} = 0.60$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$,\n- $\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{prot}} = 1.00$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a $1.00$ cm path length cuvette.

The data provided are standard, accepted values in molecular biology. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the Beer–Lambert law, which states that for a given substance, absorbance at a specific wavelength is directly proportional to its concentration and the optical path length of the light through the sample. The law is expressed as:\n$$A_{\\lambda} = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}\\,c\\,\\ell$$\nwhere $A_{\\lambda}$ is the absorbance at wavelength $\\lambda$, $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda}$ is the mass-specific absorption coefficient at that wavelength, $c$ is the mass concentration of the absorbing species, and $\\ell$ is the optical path length. When multiple species are present in a mixture and do not interact, the total absorbance is the sum of the individual absorbances.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected absorbance ratio $A_{260}/A_{280}$ for a pure sample of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).\nFor a pure dsDNA solution with concentration $c_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$, the absorbances at $260$ nm and $280$ nm are given by:\n$$A_{260} = \\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, \\ell$$\n$$A_{280} = \\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, \\ell$$\nThe ratio $A_{260}/A_{280}$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, \\ell}{\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} \\, \\ell} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}}}{\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}}}$$\nThis demonstrates that for a pure substance, the ratio of absorbances at two different wavelengths is independent of concentration and path length, and is solely determined by the ratio of the absorption coefficients. Using the provided values:\n$$\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} = 20 \\text{ mL mg}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} = 11.1 \\text{ mL mg}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$$\nThe theoretical ratio for pure dsDNA is:\n$$\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} = \\frac{20}{11.1} \\approx 1.8018$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested for the final answer, the expected ratio is $1.80$. This value is a benchmark for high-purity dsDNA.\n\nNext, we consider the contaminated sample containing both dsDNA and protein. The total absorbance at each wavelength is the sum of the contributions from each component.\nGiven concentrations are $c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} = 0.100$ mg mL$^{-1}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{prot}} = 0.020$ mg mL$^{-1}$. The path length is $\\ell = 1.00$ cm. The absorption coefficients for protein are $\\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{prot}} = 0.60$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and $\\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{prot}} = 1.00$ mL mg$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$.\n\nThe total absorbance at $260$ nm, $A_{260}^{\\mathrm{total}}$, is:\n$$A_{260}^{\\mathrm{total}} = ( \\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} + \\varepsilon_{260}^{\\mathrm{prot}} c_{\\mathrm{prot}} ) \\ell$$\n$$A_{260}^{\\mathrm{total}} = ( (20)(0.100) + (0.60)(0.020) ) (1.00) = (2.00 + 0.012)(1.00) = 2.012$$\nThe total absorbance at $280$ nm, $A_{280}^{\\mathrm{total}}$, is:\n$$A_{280}^{\\mathrm{total}} = ( \\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{DNA}} c_{\\mathrm{DNA}} + \\varepsilon_{280}^{\\mathrm{prot}} c_{\\mathrm{prot}} ) \\ell$$\n$$A_{280}^{\\mathrm{total}} = ( (11.1)(0.100) + (1.00)(0.020) ) (1.00) = (1.11 + 0.020)(1.00) = 1.130$$\n\nThe $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio for the contaminated sample is:\n$$\\frac{A_{260}^{\\mathrm{total}}}{A_{280}^{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{2.012}{1.130} \\approx 1.7805$$\nThis ratio of approximately $1.78$ is lower than the pure dsDNA ratio of $1.80$. This deviation is characteristic of protein contamination. The reason for this is that proteins, due to the absorbance of aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and tyrosine, absorb more strongly at $280$ nm relative to $260$ nm. The $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio for the protein contaminant is $\\frac{0.60}{1.00} = 0.60$. When a substance with a low ratio ($0.60$) is mixed with a substance with a high ratio ($1.80$), the resulting mixture's ratio is lowered. The protein contaminant adds disproportionately more to the absorbance at $280$ nm (the denominator) than to the absorbance at $260$ nm (the numerator), thereby decreasing the overall ratio. A ratio below the ideal $\\approx 1.80$ is a standard diagnostic indicator of protein contamination in a DNA preparation.\n\nFinally, to correct this deviation and improve DNA purity, several realistic cleanup steps can be employed to remove the protein contaminant:\n1.  **Phenol-Chloroform Extraction:** This is a classic biochemical technique. An equal volume of a phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol ($25:24:1$) mixture is added to the aqueous DNA sample. Phenol denatures the proteins, causing them to precipitate. Upon centrifugation, two phases form: an upper aqueous phase containing the polar DNA and a lower organic phase. The denatured proteins collect at the interphase. The aqueous phase is carefully recovered, and the DNA is typically precipitated with ethanol. This method is effective but uses hazardous organic solvents.\n2.  **Protease Digestion:** The sample can be treated with a protease, such as Proteinase K, which is a broad-spectrum serine protease. It efficiently degrades most proteins into small peptides. The reaction is typically carried out at an elevated temperature (e.g., $56^\\circ$C). Following digestion, the protease itself and the peptide fragments must be removed, often through a subsequent purification step like phenol-chloroform extraction or column chromatography.\n3.  **Silica-based Spin Column Chromatography:** This is a widely used modern method. The principle is based on the selective binding of nucleic acids to a silica membrane in the presence of high concentrations of chaotropic salts (e.g., guanidinium thiocyanate). Under these conditions, DNA binds to the column, while most proteins and other contaminants do not and are washed away. After several wash steps, the purified DNA is eluted from the membrane using a low-salt buffer or nuclease-free water. This method is rapid, scalable, and avoids toxic organic solvents, making it a staple in modern molecular biology labs.\n\nEach of these methods selectively targets and removes proteins based on their distinct chemical and physical properties compared to DNA, thus leading to a purer DNA sample. A successful cleanup would result in an $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio closer to the ideal value of $1.80$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.80}$$", "id": "5231777"}, {"introduction": "Once a high-quality sample is secured, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is often employed to measure the amount of a specific DNA target.

Assume the reaction proceeds with a constant per-cycle amplification efficiency and a fixed detection threshold.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that, under constant per-cycle efficiency, the number of target molecules after $c$ cycles is $N_c=N_0(1+E)^c$, where $N_0$ is the initial target copy number and $E$ is the amplification efficiency (a dimensionless fraction), derive the linear relationship between $C_t$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$ under a fixed detection threshold $N_t$, identify the slope $m$ in terms of $E$, and from this obtain an explicit expression for $E$ in terms of $m$. Then, using the measured $m=-3.50$, compute the amplification efficiency $E$. Round your final numerical value for $E$ to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (not a percent).\n\nBriefly explain, based on your derivation, how deviations of $E$ from $1$ influence the accuracy of copy number quantification across the $6$-log dynamic range, without performing any additional calculations.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the cycle threshold ($C_t$) and the initial copy number ($N_0$) in a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay, and then to use this relationship to calculate the amplification efficiency ($E$) from a measured standard curve slope ($m$).\n\nThe fundamental equation describing the number of target molecules, $N_c$, after $c$ cycles of amplification is given as:\n$$N_c = N_0 (1+E)^c$$\nHere, $N_0$ is the initial number of target molecules, and $E$ is the amplification efficiency, representing the fractional increase in product per cycle. An efficiency of $E=1$ corresponds to a perfect, $100\\%$ doubling of product in each cycle.\n\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is defined as the cycle number at which the amount of amplified DNA reaches a fixed detection threshold, $N_t$. By substituting $c = C_t$ and $N_c = N_t$ into the amplification equation, we get:\n$$N_t = N_0 (1+E)^{C_t}$$\n\nTo derive the linear relationship between $C_t$ and the logarithm of the starting copy number, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_t) = \\log_{10}(N_0 (1+E)^{C_t})$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a^x) = x\\log(a)$, we can expand the right side:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_t) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + C_t \\log_{10}(1+E)$$\n\nNow, we rearrange this equation to express $C_t$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(N_0)$:\n$$C_t \\log_{10}(1+E) = \\log_{10}(N_t) - \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\n$$C_t = \\frac{-\\log_{10}(N_0)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)} + \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_t)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\n\nThis equation has the form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $y=C_t$ and $x=\\log_{10}(N_0)$.

The entire quantification framework rests on the linear model $C_t = m \\log_{10}(N_0) + b$. This model's validity, and thus the accuracy of the assay, depends critically on the assumption that the efficiency $E$ is constant across the entire dynamic range of concentrations and is the same for both standards and unknown samples. The derived slope, $m = -1/\\log_{10}(1+E)$, is a function of $E$. If the real efficiency is not constant—a common occurrence in reactions where $E$ deviates significantly from the ideal $E=1$ due to factors like reagent limitation at high concentrations or stochastic effects at low concentrations—then the slope $m$ is not constant. This means the relationship between $C_t$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$ is not truly linear. Forcing a single linear fit to such inherently non-linear data will result in concentration-dependent errors in the calculated copy number, reducing the accuracy of quantification, especially at the high and low ends of the $6$-log dynamic range. Similarly, if an unknown sample contains inhibitors that alter its specific efficiency relative to the standards, using the standard curve's slope will yield an inaccurate copy number result.

The prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are defined as:\n- Prevalence: $p = P(D)$\n- Sensitivity: $S_e = P(T^+ \\mid D)$\n- Specificity: $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$, where $D^c$ is the complement of $D$ (no disease) and $T^-$ is a negative test result.\n\nThe PPV is defined as the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D \\mid T^+)$.
