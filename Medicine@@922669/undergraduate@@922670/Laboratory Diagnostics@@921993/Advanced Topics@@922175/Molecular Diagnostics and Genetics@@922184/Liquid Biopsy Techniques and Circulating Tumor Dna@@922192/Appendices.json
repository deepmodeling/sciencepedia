Mastering this calculation is essential for understanding sample yield and ensuring data from different samples are comparable.", "problem": "A plasma specimen is processed for a liquid biopsy to quantify circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) and infer the number of human genome equivalents in the input plasma, a quantity often used to normalize circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) measurements across samples. The specimen volume entering extraction is $3.5$ milliliters. After extraction, fluorometry with a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid dye reports a total cfDNA mass of $8.25$ nanograms recovered in the eluate. The validated extraction protocol has a recovery efficiency of $0.50$ (fraction of input cfDNA mass captured). Assume the cfDNA population is overwhelmingly nuclear diploid human DNA and that the mass of one diploid human genome is approximately $6.6$ picograms, a well-tested empirical fact in human molecular diagnostics. Use only these facts and the definition of a genome equivalent (one diploid genome’s worth of deoxyribonucleic acid) to derive, from first principles, an expression that converts a measured cfDNA mass in nanograms to genome equivalents, then use it to compute the recovered genome equivalents, correct to the input plasma, and finally compute the input concentration in genome equivalents per milliliter.\n\nReport the final concentration in genome equivalents per milliliter (GE per mL) and round your numerical answer to four significant figures.\n\nAdditionally, briefly justify, based on the principles of fluorescent dye binding and polymerase chain reaction kinetics and analyte specificity, when quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)–based quantification provides a more accurate estimate of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) than fluorometric mass measurement.

Do not include this justification in your numerical answer.", "solution": "The objective is to convert a measured cfDNA mass to a count of genome equivalents and then to a concentration per milliliter, correcting for extraction efficiency. The fundamental facts we use are:\n\n- A genome equivalent is defined as the mass of one diploid human genome.\n- The mass of one diploid human genome is approximately $6.6$ picograms.\n- Conversion between mass units: $1$ nanogram equals $10^{3}$ picograms.\n\nLet the measured cfDNA mass be $m_{ng}$ in nanograms. Converting to picograms gives\n$$\nm_{pg} = 10^{3} \\, m_{ng}.\n$$\nIf one genome equivalent has mass $m_{\\text{GE}} = 6.6$ picograms, then the number of genome equivalents in the recovered eluate is given by\n$$\nGE_{\\text{captured}} = \\frac{m_{pg}}{m_{\\text{GE}}} = \\frac{10^{3} \\, m_{ng}}{6.6}.\n$$\nLet the extraction efficiency be $\\eta$ (a fraction between $0$ and $1$). The captured mass represents only a fraction $\\eta$ of the input mass, so the estimated genome equivalents in the input plasma volume is\n$$\nGE_{\\text{input}} = \\frac{GE_{\\text{captured}}}{\\eta} = \\frac{10^{3} \\, m_{ng}}{6.6 \\, \\eta}.\n$$\nIf the plasma input volume is $V_{p}$ in milliliters, the input concentration is\n$$\nC_{\\text{GE/mL}} = \\frac{GE_{\\text{input}}}{V_{p}} = \\frac{10^{3} \\, m_{ng}}{6.6 \\, \\eta \\, V_{p}}.\n$$\n\nNow substitute the given values $m_{ng} = 8.25$, $\\eta = 0.50$, and $V_{p} = 3.5$:\n$$\nGE_{\\text{captured}} = \\frac{10^{3} \\times 8.25}{6.6} = \\frac{8250}{6.6} = 1250,\n$$\n$$\nGE_{\\text{input}} = \\frac{1250}{0.50} = 2500,\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{GE/mL}} = \\frac{2500}{3.5} = \\frac{2500}{3.5} \\approx 714.285714\\ldots.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the concentration is $714.3$ genome equivalents per milliliter.\n\nJustification for when quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)–based quantification is preferable to fluorometric mass measurement:\n\n- Fluorometry measures total double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid mass irrespective of origin or sequence, and thus cannot distinguish circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid from background circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid derived from non-malignant cells. When the ctDNA fraction is low (for example, low tumor burden or post-treatment minimal residual disease), fluorometric mass measurements are dominated by background deoxyribonucleic acid and can substantially overestimate ctDNA.\n- Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction leverages sequence specificity and exponential amplification kinetics. By using primers and probes targeting a tumor-specific variant (for example, a point mutation or rearrangement), qPCR quantifies the ctDNA fraction sensitively even in the presence of abundant wild-type deoxyribonucleic acid, improving accuracy for ctDNA estimation at low variant allele fractions.\n- qPCR is also preferable when co-extracted nucleic acids or contaminants inflate dye-based signals (for example, ribonucleic acid or single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid partially binding dye, residual phenol, or proteins), or when samples contain highly fragmented deoxyribonucleic acid where fluorometric assumptions about dye binding efficiency vary with fragment length. In contrast, qPCR can be designed to amplify short amplicons matching the fragment size distribution of ctDNA, improving sensitivity and specificity.\n\nTherefore, qPCR-based quantification is generally more accurate for ctDNA when tumor-origin sequences must be discriminated from high background and when the absolute mass measurement does not reflect sequence-specific abundance, whereas fluorometry is acceptable for total deoxyribonucleic acid load estimation in cleaner, high-mass contexts without the need for sequence specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{714.3}$$", "id": "5230433"}, {"introduction": "Once cfDNA is sequenced, we can measure the frequency of tumor-specific mutations, known as the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF). However, the VAF is not the same as the tumor fraction ($f$), which is the proportion of all cfDNA that originates from the tumor. This practice problem demonstrates the fundamental relationship between these two values by considering the genetic makeup of the tumor cells [@problem_id:5230413]. Understanding this conversion is the key to translating raw sequencing data into a clinically meaningful estimate of a patient's tumor burden.", "problem": "In a plasma liquid biopsy for a patient with a solid tumor, targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) detects a single-nucleotide variant with an observed Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) of $0.05$ after quality control and error suppression. Let the tumor fraction in cfDNA be denoted by $f$, defined as the fraction of total cfDNA molecules that originate from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Consider the following scientifically standard assumptions:\n\n- The tumor locus is diploid, so the total tumor copy number at the locus is $c_t=2$.\n- The mutation is present on exactly one of the tumor copies at this locus, so the number of mutant copies in tumor cells is $m_t=1$ (heterozygous in tumor).\n- The normal cfDNA contribution is diploid at this locus with total copy number $2$ and carries zero mutant alleles.\n- Sequencing reads sample alleles proportionally to their abundance, with equal per-copy representation and no allelic bias.\n\nStarting from the definition that VAF is the fraction of mutant alleles among all alleles sampled from the mixture of tumor-derived and normal-derived cfDNA, derive a relationship between $VAF$, $f$, $m_t$, and $c_t$, and use it to solve for $f$ given $VAF=0.05$, $m_t=1$, and $c_t=2$. Express your final $f$ as a pure decimal fraction with no units. Finally, briefly interpret the result under the diploid tumor model described above.", "solution": "The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the ratio of mutant allele copies to the total number of allele copies at a specific locus in a cell-free DNA sample.\n$$VAF = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}}$$\nThe sample is a mixture of DNA from tumor cells (fraction $f$) and normal cells (fraction $1-f$). The number of alleles from each source depends on the tumor fraction, the ploidy (copy number), and the allelic state. The total number of mutant alleles comes only from the tumor fraction ($f \\times m_t$, where $m_t$ is the number of mutant alleles per tumor genome). The total number of all alleles is the sum from the tumor fraction ($f \\times c_t$, where $c_t$ is the tumor's total copy number) and the normal fraction ($(1-f) \\times 2$, for diploid normal cells).\n\nThis gives the general relationship:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\cdot m_t}{f \\cdot c_t + 2(1-f)}$$\n\nFor this problem, the mutation is heterozygous ($m_t=1$) in a diploid tumor ($c_t=2$). Substituting these values simplifies the equation dramatically:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\cdot 1}{f \\cdot 2 + 2(1-f)} = \\frac{f}{2f + 2 - 2f} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nThis well-known rule of thumb states that for a heterozygous, diploid mutation, the VAF is half the tumor fraction. Given the observed $VAF = 0.05$, we can solve for $f$:\n$$f = 2 \\times VAF = 2 \\times 0.05 = 0.1$$\n\nThe calculated tumor fraction is $f=0.1$. This means that an estimated 10% of the total cell-free DNA in the patient's plasma is derived from the tumor (ctDNA), while the remaining 90% is from normal cells. Since the mutation is heterozygous, only half of the alleles at this locus *within the tumor-derived fraction* carry the mutation. Therefore, the mutant allele's frequency in the total cfDNA pool is half of the tumor fraction, or $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.1 = 0.05$, matching the observed VAF.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1}\n$$", "id": "5230413"}, {"introduction": "Detecting minimal residual disease after treatment requires finding a very small number of ctDNA molecules in a vast background of normal DNA.
