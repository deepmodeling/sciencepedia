It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and requires a rigorous derivation based on first principles as specified. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe process of DNA extension can be modeled as a sequence of independent trials, where each trial is the incorporation of a single nucleotide. For each incorporation step, there are two possible outcomes based on the template: the polymerase incorporates a dNTP, allowing the chain to continue, or it incorporates a ddNTP, causing the chain to terminate. This is a sequence of Bernoulli trials.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of termination in a single step. Let $p$ be the probability of termination (incorporating a ddNTP) and $q$ be the probability of continuation (incorporating a dNTP). The problem states that the selection probability for a nucleotide is proportional to its molar concentration. For any given template base, the polymerase chooses between the corresponding dNTP and ddNTP.\n\nLet $C_{dNTP}$ be the concentration of the specific dNTP and $C_{ddNTP}$ be the concentration of the corresponding ddNTP. The given molar ratio is $r = \\frac{C_{ddNTP}}{C_{dNTP}}$.\nThe probability of incorporating a ddNTP is the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of available nucleotides for that position:\n$$p = P(\\text{termination}) = \\frac{C_{ddNTP}}{C_{dNTP} + C_{ddNTP}}$$\nWe can express this probability in terms of $r$. By dividing the numerator and the denominator by $C_{dNTP}$ (which is non-zero), we get:\n$$p = \\frac{C_{ddNTP}/C_{dNTP}}{C_{dNTP}/C_{dNTP} + C_{ddNTP}/C_{dNTP}} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$$\nThe probability of continuation, $q$, is a complementary event:\n$$q = P(\\text{continuation}) = \\frac{C_{dNTP}}{C_{dNTP} + C_{ddNTP}} = \\frac{C_{dNTP}/C_{dNTP}}{C_{dNTP}/C_{dNTP} + C_{ddNTP}/C_{dNTP}} = \\frac{1}{1+r}$$\nAs a check, $p+q = \\frac{r}{1+r} + \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1+r}{1+r} = 1$, as required.\n\nThe first task is to derive the probability that the fragment length $L$ is exactly $k$, where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. A fragment of length $L=k$ means that there were $k-1$ successful continuation steps followed by one termination step at the $k$-th position.\nThe first step must be a continuation (if $k > 1$), with probability $q$.\nThe second step must be a continuation (if $k > 2$), with probability $q$.\n...\nThe $(k-1)$-th step must be a continuation, with probability $q$.\nThe $k$-th step must be a termination, with probability $p$.\n\nSince all steps are assumed to be independent, the probability of this sequence of events is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(L=k) = \\underbrace{q \\times q \\times \\cdots \\times q}_{k-1 \\text{ times}} \\times p = q^{k-1}p$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p$ and $q$ in terms of $r$:\n$$P(L=k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{k-1} \\left(\\frac{r}{1+r}\\right) = \\frac{r}{(1+r)^k}$$\nThis is the probability mass function for the fragment length $L$, which follows a geometric distribution with success parameter $p = \\frac{r}{1+r}$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the expected fragment length, $\\mathbb{E}[L]$, from this probability distribution. The expected value of a discrete random variable is defined as the sum of each possible value multiplied by its probability:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(L=k)$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $P(L=k)$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot \\frac{r}{(1+r)^k}$$\nWe can factor out the constant terms (those not dependent on $k$):\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = r \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{(1+r)^k}$$\nTo evaluate this summation, we use a known result for geometric series. Consider the general geometric series for $|x|<1$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x^k = \\frac{x}{1-x}$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$ allows us to introduce the factor of $k$ seen in our expectation sum:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x^k\\right) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)$$\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kx^{k-1} = \\frac{(1)(1-x) - (x)(-1)}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$$\nOur summation is $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{(1+r)^k}$. To match the form $\\sum kx^{k-1}$, we let $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. Since $r$ is a molar ratio, $r \\ge 0$. If $r=0$, the problem is trivial (infinite length, undefined expectation here), so we assume $r > 0$. This ensures that $|x| = \\frac{1}{1+r} < 1$.\nLet's rewrite our summation to use this identity:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = r \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^k = r \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{k-1}$$\nLet $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = r \\cdot x \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kx^{k-1}$$\nUsing the derivative identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kx^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = r \\cdot x \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$$\nNow substitute $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$ back into the expression:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = r \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^2}$$\nSimplify the term in the denominator:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{(1+r)-1}{1+r} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{r}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{r}{1+r}\\right)^2} = \\frac{r}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{(1+r)^2}{r^2}$$\nNow, we cancel terms. Assuming $r>0$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1+r}{r}$$\nThis is the simplified closed-form expression for the expected fragment length.\nIt can also be written as $\\mathbb{E}[L] = 1 + \\frac{1}{r}$. This form makes it clear that the expected length is always greater than $1$ and approaches $1$ as $r \\to \\infty$ (termination is highly probable) and approaches $\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$ (termination is highly improbable).\nThe expected value of a geometric distribution with success probability $p$ is $\\frac{1}{p}$. In our case, $p = \\frac{r}{1+r}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{1}{r/(1+r)} = \\frac{1+r}{r}$, which confirms our derivation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1+r}{r}}$$", "id": "5234864"}, {"introduction": "Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) revolutionized genomics by sequencing millions of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragments in parallel, but this \"shotgun\" approach means coverage across the genome is random.

The problem provides all necessary information to derive the requested expression.\n\nLet us proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem states that the number of sequencing reads covering any particular base of the genome can be modeled as a Poisson random variable. Let this random variable be denoted by $K$. The problem also provides that the mean of this distribution, which represents the average coverage depth, is $\\lambda$. Symbolically, we have:\n$$\nK \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n$$\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ events (in this case, reads covering a base) for a non-negative integer $k$. The PMF is given by:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the fraction of bases in the genome that receive zero coverage. Let us first consider a single, arbitrary base in the genome. The probability that this specific base has zero coverage corresponds to the case where $k=0$. We can calculate this probability by substituting $k=0$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$\nP(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!}\n$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $\\lambda^0 = 1$), and the factorial of $0$ is also $1$ (i.e., $0! = 1$). Substituting these values into the expression gives:\n$$\nP(K=0) = \\frac{1 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda}}{1} = e^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThis result, $e^{-\\lambda}$, is the probability that a single, randomly chosen base has zero coverage. The problem asks for the *expected fraction* of the entire genome that receives zero coverage. Let the total length of the genome be $G$ bases.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of two distinct parts. The first part is a combinatorial design problem concerning Hamming distance, and the second is a theoretical derivation concerning the error-correcting properties of codes under the Levenshtein distance metric.\n\n**Part 1: Maximal Minimal Pairwise Hamming Distance**\n\nLet the set of $4$ barcodes be denoted by $C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$. Each barcode $c_j$ is a sequence of length $L=8$ over the nucleotide alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{A, C, G, T\\}$.\n\nThe core constraint is the per-cycle balance requirement: for each position $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 8\\}$, the multiset of bases $\\{c_1[i], c_2[i], c_3[i], c_4[i]\\}$ must be identical to the set $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$. This implies that for any given position $i$, the four bases in that column of the barcode alignment must be distinct.\n\nWe need to determine the maximal achievable minimal pairwise Hamming distance, $d_H^{\\text{min}}$, for such a set $C$. The Hamming distance between two strings $c_j$ and $c_k$ of equal length is the number of positions at which their corresponding symbols are different.\n\nLet us consider any two distinct barcodes from the set, say $c_j$ and $c_k$ where $j \\neq k$. According to the per-cycle balance constraint, for any position $i$, it must be that $c_j[i] \\neq c_k[i]$. If, for some position $i_0$, it were true that $c_j[i_0] = c_k[i_0]$, then the multiset of bases $\\{c_1[i_0], c_2[i_0], c_3[i_0], c_4[i_0]\\}$ would contain at most $3$ distinct nucleotides, which violates the constraint that it must contain all $4$.\n\nTherefore, for any pair of distinct barcodes $c_j, c_k \\in C$, they must differ at every position from $i=1$ to $i=8$. The Hamming distance is thus:\n$$d_H(c_j, c_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\mathbb{I}(c_j[i] \\neq c_k[i])$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function. Since $c_j[i] \\neq c_k[i]$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 8\\}$, the sum becomes:\n$$d_H(c_j, c_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} 1 = 8$$\n\nThis demonstrates that any set of barcodes satisfying the per-cycle balance constraint has a constant pairwise Hamming distance of $8$ between any two distinct barcodes. Consequently, the minimal pairwise Hamming distance for such a set is $8$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximization* of this minimal distance. Since the constraint forces the minimal distance to be $8$, and the maximum possible Hamming distance for strings of length $8$ is also $8$, the maximal minimal pairwise Hamming distance is $8$.\n\nTo confirm that such a set can be constructed, consider the following example set $C$:\n- $c_1 = \\text{AAAAAAAA}$\n- $c_2 = \\text{CCCCCCCC}$\n- $c_3 = \\text{GGGGGGGG}$\n- $c_4 = \\text{TTTTTTTT}$\n\nThis set satisfies the per-cycle balance constraint, as at each position $i$, the set of bases is $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$. The pairwise Hamming distance for any pair is $8$. Thus, the maximal minimal pairwise Hamming distance is indeed $8$.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal Edit Distance Requirement for Error Correction**\n\nThe second task is to derive the minimal Levenshtein distance requirement for a code that guarantees the correction of any single-base error event. A single-base error event is defined as one substitution, one insertion, or one deletion. The demultiplexing rule is nearest-neighbor decoding.\n\nLet $C$ be the set of valid barcodes (codewords). Let $d_{min} = \\min_{c_j, c_k \\in C, j \\neq k} d_L(c_j, c_k)$ be the minimum pairwise Levenshtein distance of the code.\n\nSuppose a codeword $c_j \\in C$ is transmitted. A single-base error event occurs, resulting in a received string $r$. By the definition of the Levenshtein distance, such an event implies that the distance between the original codeword and the received string is $1$:\n$$d_L(c_j, r) = 1$$\n\nA nearest-neighbor decoder decodes the received string $r$ to a codeword $c_k \\in C$ that minimizes the distance $d_L(r, c_k)$. For the error to be corrected, the decoder must uniquely identify $c_j$ as the intended codeword. This requires that $r$ is strictly closer to $c_j$ than to any other codeword $c_k \\in C$ where $k \\neq j$. Mathematically:\n$$d_L(r, c_j) < d_L(r, c_k) \\quad \\forall k \\neq j$$\nSubstituting $d_L(r, c_j) = 1$, the condition for guaranteed correction becomes:\n$$1 < d_L(r, c_k) \\quad \\forall k \\neq j$$\nSince the Levenshtein distance is an integer, this is equivalent to:\n$$d_L(r, c_k) \\ge 2 \\quad \\forall k \\neq j$$\n\nTo establish a condition on the minimum distance $d_{min}$ of the code, we use the triangle inequality, which holds for the Levenshtein distance metric:\n$$d_L(c_j, c_k) \\le d_L(c_j, r) + d_L(r, c_k)$$\nRearranging this inequality provides a lower bound for $d_L(r, c_k)$:\n$$d_L(r, c_k) \\ge d_L(c_j, c_k) - d_L(c_j, r)$$\nWe know that $d_L(c_j, r) = 1$, and by definition, $d_L(c_j, c_k) \\ge d_{min}$ for any $k \\neq j$. Substituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$d_L(r, c_k) \\ge d_{min} - 1$$\nTo satisfy the condition for error correction, $d_L(r, c_k) \\ge 2$, we must ensure that the lower bound from the triangle inequality also meets this criterion. Thus, we must impose the condition:\n$$d_{min} - 1 \\ge 2$$\nThis leads to the final requirement for the minimum pairwise Levenshtein distance of the code:\n$$d_{min} \\ge 3$$\nThe minimal integer value for $d_{min}$ that satisfies this inequality is $3$. Therefore, the minimal edit distance requirement to guarantee the correction of any single-base error event is $3$. This is the general condition for any single-error-correcting code.\n\nThe set of barcodes designed in Part 1, where the pairwise distance is $8$, comfortably satisfies this condition ($8 \\ge 3$) and can in fact correct up to $t$ errors where $2t+1 \\le 8$, which implies $t \\le 3.5$, so $t=3$ errors. However, the question asks for the general minimal requirement, which is $3$.\n\nThe two results are:\n1. Maximal minimal pairwise Hamming distance: $8$.\n2. Minimal edit distance requirement for single-error correction: $3$.\n\nThese are to be presented as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5234857"}]}
