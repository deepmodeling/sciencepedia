The purpose is to generate an interpretable numeric activity score to inform phenotype interpretation for dosing.

Explain the justification for phenotype boundaries based on the activity score framework.\n- Final answer format: The numeric activity score, expressed as a unitless, exact value.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, enzyme kinetics, and pharmacogenomics. The core assumptions—that total enzyme activity in a diploid organism is the sum of contributions from each allele and that these contributions can be quantified with numerical coefficients—form the basis of clinical pharmacogenomic testing guidelines, such as those from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). The problem statement is scientifically sound and realistic as a pedagogical exercise.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (allelic coefficients, patient's diplotype) and a clear principle for combining them (summation of per-allele contributions). The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of a general expression for an activity score ($AS$) for a diploid genotype and its application to a specific case. The foundation is that the total enzyme activity is the sum of independent contributions from the two alleles.\n\nLet the diploid genotype consist of two alleles, Allele $1$ and Allele $2$. Let their corresponding per-allele function coefficients be $c_1$ and $c_2$. The problem states that the total enzyme concentration is the sum of per-allele contributions. Since the overall catalytic capacity (and thus the activity score) is directly proportional to the total enzyme concentration, the activity score for the diplotype can be defined as the sum of the individual allele function coefficients.\n\nThus, the general expression for the activity score ($AS$) is:\n$$\nAS = c_1 + c_2\n$$\n\nThis expression formalizes the principle of additive allelic contribution into a quantitative metric.\n\nNext, we compute the activity score for the specified patient. The patient's diplotype consists of one null allele and one reduced-function allele.\nUsing the provided coefficient assignments:\n- The coefficient for the null allele is $c_1 = c_{null} = 0$.\n- The coefficient for the reduced-function allele is $c_2 = c_{reduced} = 0.25$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived general expression:\n$$\nAS_{patient} = c_{null} + c_{reduced} = 0 + 0.25 = 0.25\n$$\nThe activity score for this patient is $0.25$.\n\n### Justification of Phenotype Boundaries\n\nThe activity score framework provides a quantitative basis for categorizing patients into metabolizer phenotypes. The justification for these boundaries is established by defining a reference \"normal\" activity level and comparing other scores to it.\n\n$1$. **Normal Metabolizer (NM) Baseline**: A standard diploid genotype consists of two normal-function alleles. The activity score for such an individual serves as the reference for normal metabolic capacity.\n$$\nAS_{normal} = c_{normal} + c_{normal} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\n$$\nAn activity score of $1.0$ represents the typical, fully functional enzyme activity expected in a healthy, wild-type reference population.\n\n$2$. **Poor Metabolizer (PM)**: This phenotype corresponds to little or no enzyme function. The lowest possible score is for a diplotype with two null alleles:\n$$\nAS_{PM} = c_{null} + c_{null} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nAn activity score of $0$ represents a complete absence of catalytic function. Scores slightly above $0$, such as the patient's score of $0.25$ (from a null and a reduced-function allele), also indicate severely impaired metabolism and are typically classified as either poor or intermediate metabolizer, depending on the specific drug-gene pair guidelines.\n\n$3$. **Intermediate Metabolizer (IM)**: This phenotype describes individuals with enzyme activity between that of poor and normal metabolizers. For example, a diplotype of one normal-function allele and one reduced-function allele would yield:\n$$\nAS_{IM} = c_{normal} + c_{reduced} = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75\n$$\nThis score is quantifiably lower than the normal baseline of $1.0$ but significantly greater than the PM score of $0$.\n\n$4$. **Ultrarapid Metabolizer (UM)**: This phenotype corresponds to enzyme activity significantly above the normal baseline. This typically arises from genotypes involving gene duplications or alleles with intrinsically higher activity. The problem assigns a coefficient of $1.0$ to a \"gain-of-function allele,\" which in practice often represents a duplicated normal-function allele locus. A diplotype with one normal allele and one such gain-of-function locus would have a score of:\n$$\nAS_{UM} = c_{normal} + c_{gain} = 0.5 + 1.0 = 1.5\n$$\nScores such as $1.5$, $2.0$, or higher clearly delineate a group with greater-than-normal enzyme activity, justifying the UM category.\n\nIn summary, the activity score creates a continuous numerical scale ($0, 0.25, 0.5, ..., 1.0, ..., 2.0$, etc.) that directly maps genotype to a quantitative measure of enzyme function. This allows for the establishment of rational, data-driven, and non-arbitrary thresholds to define the discrete phenotypic categories (PM, IM, NM, UM) used in clinical decision-making for drug dosing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.25}$$", "id": "5227565"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational concept of the activity score, this practice delves into a realistic clinical scenario involving the highly variable *CYP2D6* gene. You will apply the scoring system to a complex genotype that includes not only different types of alleles but also a gene duplication, a common source of high variability in drug metabolism.

The laboratory uses the Cytochrome P450 2D6 activity score framework to translate genotype into an activity score and then into a metabolizer phenotype. The following foundational facts are adopted by the laboratory as part of its standard operating procedure:\n\n1. CYP2D6 allele functional categories and their activity values: normal function allele contributes activity value $1.0$, decreased function allele contributes activity value $0.25$, and no function allele contributes activity value $0$.\n\n2. Gene dosage principle: if a specific allele is duplicated, each additional copy contributes the same activity value as the original allele, and the total activity score is the sum of the activity values across all gene copies.\n\n3. Activity score to phenotype map (based on widely used clinical practice guidelines): \n   - Poor metabolizer (PM): activity score $\\mathrm{AS} = 0$.\n   - Intermediate metabolizer (IM): $0  \\mathrm{AS}  1.25$.\n   - Normal metabolizer (NM): $1.25 \\leq \\mathrm{AS} \\leq 2.25$.\n   - Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM): $\\mathrm{AS} > 2.25$.\n\nThe alleles CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*10 are classified as follows for this pipeline: *4 is a no function allele and *10 is a decreased function allele. A patient’s genotype is reported as a diplotype *4/*10 with a single gene duplication on *10 (that is, there are two copies of *10 and one copy of *4, for a total of $3$ CYP2D6 gene copies).\n\nUsing only the facts above and first principles of additivity of gene dosage, compute the CYP2D6 activity score and assign the metabolizer category.

The genotype is given as a diplotype *4/*10 with a single gene duplication on the *10 allele. This indicates the patient has a total of $3$ gene copies: $1$ copy of the *4 allele and $2$ copies of the *10 allele.\n\nSecond, we must assign an activity value to each allele based on the provided classifications.\n- The allele CYP2D6*4 is defined as a no function allele. According to the foundational facts, a no function allele contributes an activity value of $0$.\n- The allele CYP2D6*10 is defined as a decreased function allele. A decreased function allele contributes an activity value of $0.25$.\n\nThird, we calculate the total activity score, $\\mathrm{AS}$, by summing the activity values of all gene copies, as per the gene dosage principle. The total score is the sum of the contributions from each allele copy present.\nThe contribution from the single *4 allele is $1 \\times 0 = 0$.\nThe contribution from the two *10 alleles is $2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$.\nThe total activity score is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\mathrm{AS} = (1 \\times 0) + (2 \\times 0.25) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{AS} = 0 + 0.5 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{AS} = 0.5 $$\n\nFourth, we map this activity score to a metabolizer phenotype using the provided activity score to phenotype map. The map is defined as:\n- Poor metabolizer (PM): $\\mathrm{AS} = 0$.\n- Intermediate metabolizer (IM): $0  \\mathrm{AS}  1.25$.\n- Normal metabolizer (NM): $1.25 \\leq \\mathrm{AS} \\leq 2.25$.\n- Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM): $\\mathrm{AS} > 2.25$.\n\nOur calculated activity score is $\\mathrm{AS} = 0.5$. We check which category this falls into. The condition for an Intermediate Metabolizer is $0  \\mathrm{AS}  1.25$. Since $0  0.5  1.25$, the patient's phenotype is Intermediate Metabolizer (IM).\n\nFifth, we encode this phenotype into the specified numeric code, $c$. The problem states the following mapping:\n- Poor metabolizer (PM) $\\rightarrow c=0$\n- Intermediate metabolizer (IM) $\\rightarrow c=1$\n- Normal metabolizer (NM) $\\rightarrow c=2$\n- Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) $\\rightarrow c=3$\n\nSince the phenotype is Intermediate Metabolizer, the corresponding numeric code is $c=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer as a two-entry row vector $(\\mathrm{AS}, c)$.

An additive linear model is used, where a baseline contribution represents the expected dose for a reference genotype, and each allele-specific genetic effect contributes proportionally to the counted alleles.
