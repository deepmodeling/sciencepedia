Consider an idealized large genome modeled as a stationary sequence of independently and identically distributed bases with equal base frequencies, that is, each base is adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine with probability $1/4$ independently at each position. Assume a restriction enzyme recognizes a single exact motif of length $k$ bases (no degeneracy and no mismatches), and each potential start position in the genome is evaluated for motif match using the standard multiplication rule for independent events.\n\nUsing only the independence assumption and equal base frequencies, derive from first principles the expected recognition site density (defined as expected sites per base pair when the genome length is large) and the expected average fragment length between consecutive cuts, first for a $k=4$ cutter and then for a $k=6$ cutter.

It is scientifically grounded as a standard theoretical model in molecular biology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated objectively. The model utilizes simplifying assumptions, such as independently and identically distributed bases and treating recognition sites as a Bernoulli process, which are explicitly stated and are common in foundational biophysical and bioinformatic problems.\n\nLet us proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem models a large genome as a sequence of bases where each position is independently chosen from the set $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$ with equal probability. The probability of any specific base at any given position is therefore $P_{base} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nA restriction enzyme recognizes a specific, non-degenerate nucleotide motif of length $k$. Since the bases are independent, the probability of a specific $k$-base motif starting at any given position in the sequence is the product of the probabilities of each of the $k$ bases appearing in the required order.\nLet $p_k$ be the probability of finding the recognition motif of length $k$ at a specific position.\n$$p_k = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\quad (k \\text{ times})$$\n$$p_k = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k$$\n\nThe problem asks us to calculate two quantities: the expected recognition site density and the expected average fragment length.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expected recognition site density, $D_k$. This is defined as the expected number of sites per base pair. The problem instructs us to treat the occurrence of a cut site at each base position as a Bernoulli trial with a success probability equal to the per-position motif probability, $p_k$.\nFor a long genome of length $N$ base pairs, there are $N$ potential starting positions for the motif (for simplicity in a large genome, we ignore minor edge effects). Let $S_i$ be a random variable that is $1$ if a recognition site starts at position $i$ and $0$ otherwise. Then $S_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with $P(S_i = 1) = p_k$.\nThe total number of expected sites in the genome, $E[\\text{Total Sites}]$, is the sum of the expectations at each position:\n$$E[\\text{Total Sites}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[S_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_k = N p_k$$\nThe density $D_k$ is the expected number of sites per base pair, which is $E[\\text{Total Sites}]$ divided by the length $N$.\n$$D_k = \\frac{E[\\text{Total Sites}]}{N} = \\frac{N p_k}{N} = p_k = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k$$\n\nSecond, we consider the expected average fragment length, $L_k$. A fragment is the stretch of DNA between two consecutive cut sites. The model of Bernoulli trials at each position means we are looking for the number of positions (trials) until the next success (cut). This is a classic waiting time problem, and the number of trials until the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials follows a geometric distribution. The mean (expected value) of a geometric distribution with success probability $p$ is $\\frac{1}{p}$.\nTherefore, the expected average fragment length $L_k$ is the reciprocal of the probability of a cut at any given site, $p_k$.\n$$L_k = \\frac{1}{p_k} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k} = 4^k$$\nThis result emerges directly from the mandated instruction to \"use the standard result for the mean waiting time in such a process.\"\n\nNow we apply these general formulas for the specified values of $k=4$ and $k=6$.\n\nFor a $k=4$ cutter:\nThe probability of a specific $4$-base motif is:\n$$p_4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{256}$$\nThe expected recognition site density is:\n$$D_4 = p_4 = \\frac{1}{256} \\text{ sites/base pair}$$\nThe expected average fragment length is:\n$$L_4 = \\frac{1}{p_4} = 4^4 = 256 \\text{ base pairs}$$\n\nFor a $k=6$ cutter:\nThe probability of a specific $6$-base motif is:\n$$p_6 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{4096}$$\nThe expected recognition site density is:\n$$D_6 = p_6 = \\frac{1}{4096} \\text{ sites/base pair}$$\nThe expected average fragment length is:\n$$L_6 = \\frac{1}{p_6} = 4^6 = 4096 \\text{ base pairs}$$\n\nThe problem requires reporting four quantities in the order: (1) density for $k=4$, (2) average fragment length for $k=4$, (3) density for $k=6$, and (4) average fragment length for $k=6$.\nThe values are:\n1. $D_4 = \\frac{1}{256}$\n2. $L_4 = 256$\n3. $D_6 = \\frac{1}{4096}$\n4. $L_6 = 4096$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{256} & 256 & \\frac{1}{4096} & 4096\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5236746"}, {"introduction": "Once a DNA sample is amplified and digested, the crucial step is to interpret the resulting pattern of bands on a gel.

No essential information is missing, and there are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nLet us denote the allele lacking the restriction site as $A_1$ and the allele containing the restriction site as $A_2$. Since the locus is diploid, an individual can have one of three genotypes: $A_1A_1$ (homozygous for the non-cuttable allele), $A_2A_2$ (homozygous for the cuttable allele), or $A_1A_2$ (heterozygous).\n\nWe can predict the expected banding pattern for each genotype after PCR and complete restriction digestion:\n\n1.  **Genotype $A_1A_1$ (Homozygous non-cutter):** PCR will only produce amplicons of type $A_1$. Since these lack the restriction site, they will not be digested. The resulting gel would show a single band at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n2.  **Genotype $A_2A_2$ (Homozygous cutter):** PCR will only produce amplicons of type $A_2$. Assuming complete digestion, all $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ amplicons will be cleaved into $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragments. The resulting gel would show two bands at $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, and no band at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. If digestion were incomplete (partial), some $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ amplicons would remain, resulting in three bands: $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n3.  **Genotype $A_1A_2$ (Heterozygous):** PCR will produce an approximately equal mixture of amplicons of type $A_1$ and $A_2$. Upon digestion, the $A_1$ amplicons remain uncut at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The $A_2$ amplicons are cleaved into $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragments. Therefore, the resulting gel must show three bands at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The presence of the $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band from the $A_1$ allele is an intrinsic feature of this genotype and does not depend on the completeness of digestion.\n\nThe observed result is two bands at $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, with a notable absence of a $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band. Comparing this observation with the three predicted patterns, it perfectly matches the expectation for a homozygous cutter ($A_2A_2$) with complete digestion. The problem statement notes that the reaction was run under validated conditions with excess enzyme, which makes complete digestion the most probable outcome.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The sample is homozygous for the allele carrying the restriction site; digestion was effectively complete. Partial digestion would have produced a residual band at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, which is not observed.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. A homozygous individual for the cuttable allele ($A_2A_2$) would yield only $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragments upon complete digestion. The absence of the $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band confirms that digestion was not partial. The experimental conditions described (\"excess enzyme\", \"validated on controls\") lend strong support to the conclusion of complete digestion. This is the most direct and parsimonious explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The sample is heterozygous, and complete digestion of the cuttable allele converted its $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ amplicon entirely into $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragments, removing the $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band.**\nThis interpretation is fundamentally flawed. A heterozygous individual ($A_1A_2$) possesses one non-cuttable allele ($A_1$). The amplicons generated from this allele will always remain at $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ because they lack the restriction site. Therefore, a heterozygous sample will *always* produce a $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band. The statement incorrectly implies that digestion of the cuttable allele's product would somehow eliminate the product of the non-cuttable allele.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The sample is homozygous for the allele lacking the restriction site, but the enzyme exhibited star activity that generated exactly $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragments.**\nThis is a highly improbable explanation. Star activity refers to relaxed sequence specificity under non-optimal conditions. While it can lead to cleavage at sites other than the canonical recognition sequence, it is extremely unlikely that such non-specific cleavage would coincidentally generate the two exact fragments ($8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) corresponding to the specific restriction site. Star activity typically produces a smear or a complex pattern of many bands. Furthermore, the problem explicitly states that the digestion was performed under \"standard conditions with excess enzyme, appropriate buffer, and incubation time validated on controls,\" which are precisely the measures taken to *prevent* star activity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The sample is heterozygous, but the $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ fragment failed to enter the gel or was not detectable under the electrophoresis conditions, so only the $8.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $5.4\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ bands were observed.**\nThis explanation is directly contradicted by the information provided in the problem statement. It is explicitly mentioned that \"A molecular weight ladder confirms that fragments of size $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ are resolvable under the run conditions.\" This control experiment rules out any systematic failure of the gel system to detect or resolve a $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band. Invoking a special failure for the sample's $13.5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ band, while the ladder's equivalent band is fine, is an ad hoc hypothesis with no basis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5236713"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosing a single individual, RFLP is a powerful tool for analyzing genetic variation across entire populations.
