In a standard mixing study, equal volumes of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma are combined ($1:1$ mix).

It provides a clear, simplified model of a standard laboratory procedure, the mixing study for coagulation factor deficiencies, which is based on established hematological principles. All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe primary principle for this analysis is the conservation of factor activity upon mixing, in the absence of inhibitors. The total amount of a given coagulation factor in the final mixture is the sum of the amounts contributed by each component plasma. The activity concentration in the mixture is then this total amount divided by the total volume.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{patient}}$ be the factor activity in the patient's plasma and $f_{\\text{normal}}$ be the factor activity in the normal pooled plasma. The problem states these activities are measured in percent units, with $f_{\\text{normal}} = 100$.\n\nLet $V_{\\text{patient}}$ and $V_{\\text{normal}}$ be the volumes of the patient plasma and normal pooled plasma, respectively. A $1:1$ mix implies that $V_{\\text{patient}} = V_{\\text{normal}}$.

This result is consistent with a factor deficiency without the presence of a circulating inhibitor.\n\nThe problem requires the final mixed factor activity to be expressed as a decimal fraction. The calculated activity is $52.5$ in percent units.

It describes a standard clinical laboratory procedure (aPTT mixing study) with plausible data points. The concepts of factor deficiency, inhibitors, percent correction, and the Rosner index are all well-established in the field of hematology and coagulation diagnostics. The problem statement is self-contained, providing all necessary data for the requested calculations and interpretation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe purpose of a mixing study is to distinguish between two primary causes of a prolonged clotting time such as the aPTT: a deficiency of one or more coagulation factors, or the presence of an inhibitor that interferes with the coagulation cascade.\n\nLet $T_P$ be the patient's aPTT, $T_N$ be the aPTT of pooled normal plasma (PNP), and $T_M$ be the aPTT of a $1:1$ mixture of patient plasma and PNP.\n\nThe foundational principle is as follows:\n$1$. **Factor Deficiency**: If the patient's plasma has a prolonged aPTT due to a deficiency of one or more coagulation factors, mixing it $1:1$ with PNP will introduce a sufficient quantity of the missing factor(s). PNP contains, by definition, approximately $100\\%$ activity of all factors. A $1:1$ mix will therefore have at least $50\\%$ activity of every factor. For the aPTT, a normal clotting time is typically achieved if factor levels are above a critical threshold of approximately $30-40\\%$. Since $50\\%$ is above this threshold, the aPTT of the mixture is expected to \"correct,\" meaning its value ($T_M$) will become close to the normal value ($T_N$).\n\n$2$. **Inhibitor Presence**: If the patient's plasma contains an inhibitor (e.g., a lupus anticoagulant or an antibody against a specific factor), this inhibitor will also act on the factors supplied by the PNP in the $1:1$ mix. The inhibitor neutralizes the coagulation factors, preventing the clotting cascade from proceeding normally. Consequently, the aPTT of the mixture ($T_M$) will fail to correct and will remain significantly prolonged, closer to the patient's original value ($T_P$).\n\nTo quantify these effects, we can define indices for the degree of correction and the residual prolongation.\n\n**Quantification of Correction: \"Percent Correction\"**\n\nWe can derive a measure of correction from first principles by considering the total possible correction. The initial prolongation of the patient's aPTT relative to the normal aPTT is the interval $T_P - T_N$. This represents the total \"abnormality\" that could potentially be corrected. The observed correction in the mixture is the extent to which the mix aPTT has moved from the patient's aPTT toward the normal aPTT, which is given by the difference $T_P - T_M$.\n\nThe \"percent correction,\" expressed as a decimal fraction, is the ratio of the observed correction to the total possible correction. Let's denote this as $C_{frac}$.\n\n$$C_{frac} = \\frac{\\text{Observed Correction}}{\\text{Total Possible Correction}} = \\frac{T_P - T_M}{T_P - T_N}$$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$T_P = 88 \\text{ s}$\n$T_N = 32 \\text{ s}$\n$T_M = 44 \\text{ s}$\n\n$$C_{frac} = \\frac{88 - 44}{88 - 32} = \\frac{44}{56} = \\frac{11}{14}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$C_{frac} \\approx 0.785714... \\approx 0.7857$$\n\n**Quantification of Residual Prolongation: \"Rosner Index\"**\n\nThe Rosner index ($I_R$) is a standardized measure designed to quantify the effect of a suspected inhibitor, particularly a lupus anticoagulant. It quantifies the residual prolongation of the mix aPTT ($T_M$) above the normal aPTT ($T_N$), and normalizes this prolongation by the patient's baseline aPTT ($T_P$). This normalization accounts for the severity of the initial prolongation. The formula is:\n\n$$I_R = \\frac{T_M - T_N}{T_P}$$\n(Note: This is often multiplied by $100$ in clinical reports, but the problem explicitly requests a unitless decimal fraction).\n\nUsing the given values:\n$$I_R = \\frac{44 - 32}{88} = \\frac{12}{88} = \\frac{3}{22}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$I_R \\approx 0.136363... \\approx 0.1364$$\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- **Percent Correction ($C_{frac}$)**: The calculated value is $0.7857$, or $78.57\\%$. A significant correction (typically defined as $>50\\%$ or correction of the aPTT into the normal range) is characteristic of a factor deficiency. A value of $78.57\\%$ represents a strong correction, strongly suggesting that the prolonged aPTT is due to a factor deficiency.\n\n- **Rosner Index ($I_R$)**: The calculated value is $0.1364$. Clinical thresholds for the Rosner index (when multiplied by $100$) are typically:\n  - $< 12$: Negative for inhibitor\n  - $12 - 15$: Equivocal/Indeterminate\n  - $> 15$: Positive for inhibitor\nTranslated to the requested decimal fraction format, these thresholds are $< 0.12$, $0.12 - 0.15$, and $> 0.15$. Our calculated value of $0.1364$ falls into the equivocal range. However, it is not strongly positive and, in the context of the very high percent correction, it does not provide strong evidence for a potent inhibitor.\n\n**Conclusion on Pattern**: The combination of a high percent correction ($78.57\\%$) and a Rosner index ($0.1364$) that is not definitively positive strongly indicates that the cause of the markedly prolonged aPTT is a **factor deficiency**, not the presence of a clinically significant inhibitor.\n\nThe final numerical answers requested are the decimal fractions for the percent correction and the Rosner index, rounded to four significant figures.\nPercent Correction = $0.7857$\nRosner Index = $0.1364$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7857 & 0.1364 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5231635"}, {"introduction": "The classic mixing study involves measuring the aPTT both immediately and after incubation, as some inhibitors take time to act.

There are no contradictions or fallacies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe initial laboratory results show a normal PT and a markedly prolonged aPTT. The PT measures the integrity of the extrinsic pathway (Factor VII) and common pathway (Factors X, V, II, and I/fibrinogen). The aPTT measures the integrity of the intrinsic pathway (Factors XII, XI, IX, VIII) and the common pathway. Since the PT is normal, the defect must lie within the intrinsic pathway (Factors XII, XI, IX, or VIII). The normal fibrinogen and platelet count rule out deficiencies in these components as the primary cause.\n\nThe purpose of the $1{:}1$ mixing study is to differentiate between a factor deficiency and the presence of a coagulation inhibitor.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Immediate Mix**: A $1{:}1$ mixture of patient plasma and NPP should contain at least $50\\%$ of the normal concentration of all coagulation factors. Most coagulation assays, including the aPTT, will yield a normal result if factor levels are above approximately $30\\% \\text{ to } 40\\%$.\n    - If the prolonged aPTT is due to a simple factor deficiency, the $\\ge 50\\%$ factor activity in the mix should be sufficient to 'correct' the aPTT into the normal range.\n    - If the prolonged aPTT is due to an inhibitor, the inhibitor in the patient's plasma will also act on the factors present in the NPP, and the aPTT will typically remain prolonged (fail to correct).\n\n    In this case, the immediate mixed aPTT is $33$ seconds, which meets the laboratory's criterion for correction. This initial result points towards a factor deficiency.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of the Incubated Mix**: The incubation step at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is performed to detect a specific class of inhibitors that are time- and temperature-dependent.\n    - The mixed aPTT after incubation for $120$ minutes is $56$ seconds. This is a significant prolongation compared to the immediate mix result of $33$ seconds and is well outside the normal range.\n    - This pattern—initial correction followed by subsequent prolongation upon incubation—indicates that an inhibitor present in the patient's plasma progressively inactivated the corresponding coagulation factor from the NPP over the $2$-hour incubation period.\n\n3.  **Synthesis**: The overall pattern of \"correction\" on the immediate mix followed by \"non-correction\" or prolongation on the incubated mix is the classic signature of a **time-dependent inhibitor**. The most common time-dependent specific factor inhibitor is an autoantibody directed against Factor VIII (acquired hemophilia A), which fits the clinical picture of severe spontaneous bruising in an elderly individual.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A time-dependent, specific coagulation factor inhibitor (for example, an autoantibody to factor VIII) that progressively inactivates donor factor during incubation; the immediate “correction” reflects transiently adequate factor activity before inactivation reduces it below the threshold required for a normal aPTT.**\nThis explanation is perfectly consistent with the derived synthesis. The initial mix provides sufficient Factor VIII ($\\ge 50\\%$) to normalize the aPTT (or bring it to the borderline of normal, as seen here with $33$ seconds). During the $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ incubation, the autoantibody has time to bind to and inactivate the Factor VIII from the NPP, leading to a drop in factor activity and a consequent prolongation of the aPTT to $56$ seconds. This is the textbook explanation for this specific mixing study pattern.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A simple factor deficiency in the patient that is initially corrected by the donor plasma, with subsequent prolongation caused by instability and spontaneous degradation of clotting factors in normal plasma during $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ incubation.**\nWhile a simple factor deficiency would explain the initial correction, it does not account for the significant prolongation after incubation. While labile factors like V and VIII do lose activity over time at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the degradation is not so profound as to increase the aPTT from $33$ seconds to $56$ seconds in a $1{:}1$ mix with NPP. A control sample of NPP incubated under the same conditions would show only a minor, clinically insignificant increase in its aPTT. This explanation is therefore inadequate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid antibody), which is diluted by normal plasma to yield initial correction; the delayed prolongation reflects progressive antibody binding to phospholipid over time.**\nLupus anticoagulants (LAs) are typically immediate-acting inhibitors. They interfere with the phospholipid surfaces required for coagulation factor assembly. In a mixing study, LAs characteristically fail to correct on the immediate mix, because the inhibitor acts on the test reagents and is not overcome by the addition of normal plasma. While a very weak LA might show borderline correction, the pattern of marked prolongation after incubation from a corrected state is not characteristic of an LA. The defining feature of an LA is immediate inhibition, not time-dependent inhibition of this nature.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Heparin contamination in the patient sample that is neutralized in the immediate mix by antithrombin from normal plasma; during $120$ minutes at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, antithrombin is consumed, allowing heparin’s effect to reappear and prolong the aPTT.**\nThis mechanism is biochemically flawed. Heparin is an immediate-acting anticoagulant that works by potentiating antithrombin. If present, it would cause a failure to correct on the immediate mix. The premise that antithrombin from NPP \"neutralizes\" heparin is incorrect. Furthermore, antithrombin would not be \"consumed\" over $120$ minutes in a way that would cause the heparin effect to \"reappear.\" The heparin-antithrombin interaction is catalytic and rapid. This explanation does not align with the known pharmacology of heparin or the observed results.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5231681"}]}
