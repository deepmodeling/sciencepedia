Thus, the data perfectly follows the relation $y_i = y_1 - 1.5 C_i$.\n\nPerforming a least squares regression on $(C_i, y_i)$ will yield a perfect fit. The coefficients $\\alpha_0$ and $\\alpha_1$ are:\n$$ \\alpha_1 = -1.5 \\quad (\\text{exactly}) $$\n$$ \\alpha_0 = y_1 = -1.203972804 $$\nThe fitted log-linear model is $\\ln(r_{pred}) = -1.203972804 - 1.5 C$.\n\nThe residuals, $e'_i = y_i - (\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 C_i)$, are all exactly $0$.\nTherefore, the residual sum of squares for this model is:\n$$ \\mathrm{RSS}_{log} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (e'_i)^2 = 0 $$\n\n**Model Comparison and Justification**\nThe log-linear model is unequivocally the more appropriate choice. This conclusion is based on two key observations:\n1.  **Magnitude of RSS**: The residual sum of squares for the log-linear model is $\\mathrm{RSS}_{log} = 0$, while for the linear model it is $\\mathrm{RSS}_{lin} \\approx 0.00157$. An RSS of zero indicates a perfect fit to the data, whereas the non-zero RSS of the linear model quantifies its lack of fit.\n2.  **Pattern of Residuals**: The residuals of the log-linear model are all zero, indicating no systematic error. In contrast, the residuals of the linear model exhibit a distinct U-shaped pattern, which is a classic sign of model misspecification. The data possesses a curvilinear nature that the linear model cannot capture.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the inhibition of an enzyme (Factor Xa) by an inhibitor (heparin-antithrombin complex) is expected to follow an exponential decay or hyperbolic relationship, not a linear one. The log-linear model, which is equivalent to an exponential model $r(C) = A \\exp(kC)$, is therefore more biochemically and mechanistically plausible.\n\n**Final Calibration Function**\nThe chosen model is the log-linear one. The fitted equation is:\n$$ \\ln(r) = -1.203972804 - 1.5 C $$\nTo express this as a function for $r(C)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ r(C) = \\exp(-1.203972804 - 1.5 C) = \\exp(-1.203972804) \\exp(-1.5 C) $$\nThe coefficients of this exponential function are the pre-exponential factor $A = \\exp(-1.203972804)$ and the rate constant $k = -1.5$.\nWe calculate $A$:\n$$ A = \\exp(-1.203972804) = 0.3000 $$\nThe problem requires reporting the coefficients rounded to four significant figures.\n$A = 0.3000$\n$k = -1.500$\nThus, the chosen calibration function is:\n$$ r(C) = 0.3000 \\exp(-1.500 C) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3000 \\exp(-1.500 C)}$$", "id": "5204970"}, {"introduction": "Once a reliable calibration curve is established, it can be used to determine the heparin activity in a patient sample.

Let $R_{\\text{target}}$ be the infusion rate that would achieve exactly this target level.\n$$\\frac{A_{\\text{target}}}{A_0} = \\frac{R_{\\text{target}}}{R_0}$$\nThe required ratio of the rates is:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{target}}}{R_0} = \\frac{0.3\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}}{0.15\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}} = 2$$\nSo, the infusion rate must be at least doubled.\n\nThe infusion rate is adjusted in discrete steps. Let $n$ be the number of adjustment steps. Each step increases the current infusion rate by $10\\%$. This means the rate is multiplied by a factor of $1.1$ at each step. This constitutes a geometric progression for the rate $R_n$ after $n$ steps:\n$$R_n = R_0 (1.1)^n$$\nWe need to find the minimum integer value of $n$ for which the resulting anti-Xa level, $A_n$, is at least $A_{\\text{target}}$. Since $A_n = A_0 \\frac{R_n}{R_0}$, we have:\n$$A_n = A_0 (1.1)^n$$\nThe condition is $A_n \\ge A_{\\text{target}}$:\n$$A_0 (1.1)^n \\ge A_{\\text{target}}$$\n$$(1.1)^n \\ge \\frac{A_{\\text{target}}}{A_0}$$\nWe have already determined that $\\frac{A_{\\text{target}}}{A_0} = 2$. The inequality to be solved for $n$ is:\n$$(1.1)^n \\ge 2$$\nTo find $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. As the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln((1.1)^n) \\ge \\ln(2)$$\n$$n \\ln(1.1) \\ge \\ln(2)$$\nSince $\\ln(1.1)$ is a positive constant, we can divide by it without changing the inequality:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.1)}$$\nUsing numerical values for the logarithms, $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$ and $\\ln(1.1) \\approx 0.09531$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{0.69315}{0.09531} \\approx 7.2725$$\nSince the number of steps $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $n$ that satisfies this condition is $8$.\n\nTo verify, let's check the anti-Xa levels for $n=7$ and $n=8$.\nFor $n=7$: $A_7 = A_0 (1.1)^7 = (0.15) \\times (1.1)^7 \\approx 0.15 \\times 1.9487 \\approx 0.2923\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$. This is below the target of $0.3\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$.\nFor $n=8$: $A_8 = A_0 (1.1)^8 = (0.15) \\times (1.1)^8 \\approx 0.15 \\times 2.1436 \\approx 0.3215\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$. This value meets and exceeds the target of $0.3\\,\\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$, placing it within the therapeutic range.\n\nTherefore, the minimum integer number of adjustment steps required is $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "5204945"}]}
