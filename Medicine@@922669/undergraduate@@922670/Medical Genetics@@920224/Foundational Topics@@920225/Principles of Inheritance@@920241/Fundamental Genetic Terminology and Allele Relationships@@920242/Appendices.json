We will use the foundational principles stated in the problem.\n\nLet the two mating individuals be Parent $1$ and Parent $2$. Both have the genotype $Aa$.\n\nAccording to the Law of Segregation, the two alleles in a heterozygote segregate equally into gametes. This means that for each parent, the probability of producing a gamete carrying the $A$ allele is equal to the probability of producing a gamete carrying the $a$ allele. Since there are only two possibilities, each probability must be $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor Parent $1$ (genotype $Aa$):\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$: $P_1(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$: $P_1(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFor Parent $2$ (genotype $Aa$):\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$: $P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$: $P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe problem states that zygote genotypes form by the random union of gametes, and the probability of a zygote's genotype is the product of the probabilities of the uniting gametes. We can now calculate the probabilities for each of the three possible offspring genotypes: $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$.\n\n1.  **Genotype $AA$**: This genotype results from the fusion of an $A$ gamete from Parent $1$ and an $A$ gamete from Parent $2$.\n    $$P(AA) = P_1(A) \\times P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n2.  **Genotype $aa$**: This genotype results from the fusion of an $a$ gamete from Parent $1$ and an $a$ gamete from Parent $2$.\n    $$P(aa) = P_1(a) \\times P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n3.  **Genotype $Aa$**: This heterozygous genotype can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    - An $A$ gamete from Parent $1$ fuses with an $a$ gamete from Parent $2$. The probability of this event is $P_1(A) \\times P_2(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    - An $a$ gamete from Parent $1$ fuses with an $A$ gamete from Parent $2$. The probability of this event is $P_1(a) \\times P_2(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n    The total probability of forming an $Aa$ zygote is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    $$P(Aa) = (P_1(A) \\times P_2(a)) + (P_1(a) \\times P_2(A)) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe expected genotype proportions among the offspring are therefore:\n- Proportion of $AA$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- Proportion of $Aa$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- Proportion of $aa$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThese proportions sum to $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nFinally, we must compute the probability that a randomly chosen offspring is a carrier. The problem defines a carrier as a heterozygote, which has the genotype $Aa$. Therefore, the probability of an offspring being a carrier is equal to the probability of an offspring having the genotype $Aa$.\n\n$$P(\\text{carrier}) = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe final answer requires a single row matrix containing the proportions for $AA$, $Aa$, $aa$, and the carrier probability, in that order. The values are $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4}  \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{4}  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5032869"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of segregation, this practice explores the nuances of allele interactions by introducing incomplete dominance.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by tracking the genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes through the specified generations, guided by Mendel's law of segregation.\n\n1.  **Parental (P) Generation and Gamete Formation:**\n    The two parental lines are stated to be inbred, meaning they are homozygous. Their genotypes are given as $AA$ and $aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each individual produces gametes containing only one allele from its diploid genotype.\n    - The $AA$ parent produces only gametes containing the $A$ allele.\n    - The $aa$ parent produces only gametes containing the $a$ allele.\n\n2.  **First Filial ($F_1$) Generation:**\n    The $F_1$ generation is the result of a cross between the two parental lines ($AA \\times aa$). Fertilization combines one gamete from each parent.\n    - Every offspring in the $F_1$ generation receives an $A$ allele from the $AA$ parent and an $a$ allele from the $aa$ parent.\n    - Consequently, all individuals in the $F_1$ generation have the genotype $Aa$.\n\n3.  **Gamete Formation in the $F_1$ Generation:**\n    The $F_1$ individuals are intercrossed to produce the $F_2$ generation. This cross is $Aa \\times Aa$. Each $F_1$ individual, having genotype $Aa$, produces two types of gametes. By the law of equal segregation, these gametes are produced in equal proportions.\n    - The probability of a gamete containing the $A$ allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    - The probability of a gamete containing the $a$ allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n4.  **Second Filial ($F_2$) Generation Genotypes:**\n    The $F_2$ genotypes result from the random fusion of gametes from the $F_1$ intercross. The probabilities of the offspring genotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the contributing gametes. This is commonly visualized with a Punnett square.\n    - The probability of genotype $AA$ is the probability of an $A$ gamete fusing with another $A$ gamete: $Pr(AA) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    - The probability of genotype $aa$ is the probability of an $a$ gamete fusing with another $a$ gamete: $Pr(aa) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    - The probability of genotype $Aa$ can occur in two ways: an $A$ gamete from one parent fusing with an $a$ gamete from the other, or vice versa. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: $Pr(Aa) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    The sum of probabilities is $ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1 $, as expected.\n    The expected genotypic ratio in the $F_2$ generation is $1 \\, AA : 2 \\, Aa : 1 \\, aa$.\n\n5.  **$F_2$ Generation Phenotypes:**\n    The problem statement defines the phenotype for each genotype under the condition of incomplete dominance.\n    - Genotype $AA$ corresponds to the high-activity phenotype.\n    - Genotype $aa$ corresponds to the low-activity phenotype.\n    - Genotype $Aa$ corresponds to the intermediate phenotype.\n    Because each of the three genotypes produces a distinct phenotype, the phenotypic ratio is identical to the genotypic ratio.\n    - The expected phenotypic ratio in the $F_2$ generation is $1$ (high) : $2$ (intermediate) : $1$ (low).\n\n6.  **Proportion of the Intermediate Phenotype:**\n    From the derived phenotypic ratio $1:2:1$, the total number of proportional parts is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. The intermediate phenotype corresponds to $2$ of these parts.\n    Therefore, the proportion of $F_2$ individuals exhibiting the intermediate phenotype is $\\frac{2}{4}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    This result is also directly obtained from the probability of the $Aa$ genotype, $Pr(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "5032908"}, {"introduction": "This final practice scales our perspective from individual family crosses to the genetic makeup of an entire population.
