We are asked to find the probability that a clinically unaffected child of an affected heterozygous parent carries the pathogenic variant for an autosomal dominant disorder.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the child carries the pathogenic variant.\n- $C^c$: The event that the child does not carry the pathogenic variant.\n- $U_a$: The event that the child is clinically unaffected at their current age $a$.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability $P(C | U_a)$. To achieve this, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{P(U_a | C) P(C)}{P(U_a)}$$\nWe must determine each of the three terms on the right-hand side of the equation from first principles.\n\nFirst, let us establish the prior probability, $P(C)$. The problem states that one parent is heterozygous for the pathogenic variant, let us denote their genotype as $Gg$, where $G$ is the pathogenic allele and $g$ is the wild-type allele. The other parent is unaffected, unrelated, and the problem specifies no phenocopies, which implies this parent has the genotype $gg$. According to the principles of Mendelian segregation for this $Gg \\times gg$ cross, each child has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the $G$ allele from the affected parent. Therefore, the prior probability of the child carrying the pathogenic variant is:\n$$P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe probability of the child not carrying the variant is the complement:\n$$P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nAs requested, we will first develop the logic using lifetime penetrance, $p$, before refining it for the age-specific case. Let $U$ be the event that a person is unaffected throughout their lifetime. The probability we would seek in this context is $P(C|U)$. The lifetime penetrance, $p$, is the probability that a carrier ($C$) becomes affected ($U^c$) at some point in their life, so $P(U^c|C) = p$. The probability of a carrier remaining unaffected for life is the complement, $P(U|C) = 1 - p$. For a non-carrier ($C^c$), the absence of phenocopies ensures they will remain unaffected, so $P(U|C^c) = 1$. By the law of total probability, the overall probability of being unaffected is $P(U) = P(U|C)P(C) + P(U|C^c)P(C^c) = (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2-p}{2}$. Applying Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of being a carrier given one is unaffected for life is $P(C|U) = \\frac{P(U|C)P(C)}{P(U)} = \\frac{(1-p)\\frac{1}{2}}{(2-p)\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1-p}{2-p}$. This establishes the general form of the solution.\n\nNow, we refine this derivation using the age-specific information provided. The logic remains identical, but the events and probabilities are now conditioned on the child's current age, $a$. We are given the event $U_a$, that the child is unaffected at age $a$.\n\nNext, we determine the conditional probability, $P(U_a | C)$. This is the likelihood of the evidence (being unaffected at age $a$) given the hypothesis (the child is a carrier). The problem defines the age-specific cumulative penetrance, $p(a)$, as the probability that a variant carrier has manifested the disorder by age $a$. Let $A_a$ be the event that a carrier is affected by age $a$. Then, by definition, $P(A_a | C) = p(a)$. The event $U_a$ for a carrier is the complement of $A_a$. Therefore:\n$$P(U_a | C) = 1 - P(A_a | C) = 1 - p(a)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the marginal probability of the evidence, $P(U_a)$, using the law of total probability. We partition the sample space based on the child's carrier status ($C$ or $C^c$):\n$$P(U_a) = P(U_a | C) P(C) + P(U_a | C^c) P(C^c)$$\nWe need to find $P(U_a | C^c)$, which is the probability of being unaffected at age $a$ given the child does not carry the pathogenic variant. The problem's assumption of \"no phenocopies\" implies that an individual without the variant cannot develop the disorder. Thus, a non-carrier is guaranteed to be unaffected.\n$$P(U_a | C^c) = 1$$\nSubstituting the known values into the law of total probability:\n$$P(U_a) = (1 - p(a)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(U_a) = \\frac{1 - p(a)}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 - p(a) + 1}{2} = \\frac{2 - p(a)}{2}$$\n\nWe now have all the necessary components to calculate the posterior probability $P(C | U_a)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{P(U_a | C) P(C)}{P(U_a)}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{(1 - p(a)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{2 - p(a)}{2}}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the numerator and denominator yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{1 - p(a)}{2 - p(a)}$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the clinically unaffected child of age $a$ carries the pathogenic variant, expressed as a function of the age-specific cumulative penetrance $p(a)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1 - p(a)}{2 - p(a)}}$$", "id": "5013293"}]}
