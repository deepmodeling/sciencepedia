According to the principle of Mendelian segregation, her ova will carry the $X^{A}$ allele with a probability of $P(X^{A}_{\\text{ovum}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the $X^{a}$ allele with a probability of $P(X^{a}_{\\text{ovum}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe father has genotype $X^{A}Y$. His sperm will carry the $X^{A}$ chromosome with a probability of $P(X^{A}_{\\text{sperm}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the $Y$ chromosome with a probability of $P(Y_{\\text{sperm}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe can construct a Punnett square to determine the possible genotypes of the offspring and their respective probabilities. Each cell in the square represents a possible zygote, and its probability is the product of the probabilities of the corresponding gametes.\n\n|                | Father's Gamete $X^{A}$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | Father's Gamete $Y$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Mother's Gamete $X^{A}$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $X^{A}X^{A}$ (Unaffected daughter)       | $X^{A}Y$ (Unaffected son)              |\n|                | $P = \\frac{1}{4}$                         | $P = \\frac{1}{4}$                      |\n| Mother's Gamete $X^{a}$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $X^{A}X^{a}$ (Carrier daughter)         | $X^{a}Y$ (Affected son)                |\n|                | $P = \\frac{1}{4}$                         | $P = \\frac{1}{4}$                      |\n\nThe four possible offspring genotypes, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$, are:\n1. $X^{A}X^{A}$: An unaffected, non-carrier daughter.\n2. $X^{A}X^{a}$: An unaffected, carrier daughter.\n3. $X^{A}Y$: An unaffected son.\n4. $X^{a}Y$: An affected son (due to full penetrance).\n\nThe problem asks for conditional probabilities.\n\n**1.

It is a standard application of Bayes' theorem to a genetic scenario. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThis problem requires the application of Bayes' theorem to update the probabilities of a child's genotype based on their observed phenotype. Let $G_{Aa}$ be the event that the child has genotype $Aa$, and $G_{aa}$ be the event that the child has genotype $aa$. Let $U$ be the event that the child is clinically unaffected. We are asked to compute the posterior probabilities $P(G_{aa} \\mid U)$ and $P(G_{Aa} \\mid U)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the prior probabilities of the child's possible genotypes based on the parental cross, which is $Aa \\times aa$. Using a standard Punnett square for Mendelian segregation:\n- The parent with genotype $Aa$ can produce gametes $A$ and $a$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The parent with genotype $aa$ can only produce gametes $a$, with probability $1$.\n\nThe possible genotypes for an offspring are $Aa$ and $aa$. The prior probabilities are:\n$P(G_{Aa}) = P(A \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(G_{aa}) = P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNext, we establish the conditional probabilities of the observed phenotype (unaffected) given each possible genotype. These are derived from the penetrance values given in the problem.\nThe penetrance for genotype $Aa$ is given as $P(\\text{affected} \\mid G_{Aa}) = 0.8$. Therefore, the probability of being unaffected given genotype $Aa$ is:\n$P(U \\mid G_{Aa}) = 1 - P(\\text{affected} \\mid G_{Aa}) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 = \\frac{1}{5}$\n\nThe problem states there are no phenocopies, meaning individuals with genotype $aa$ are never affected. This is given as $P(\\text{affected} \\mid G_{aa}) = 0$. Thus, the probability of being unaffected given genotype $aa$ is:\n$P(U \\mid G_{aa}) = 1 - P(\\text{affected} \\mid G_{aa}) = 1 - 0 = 1$\n\nNow, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The general form is $P(G \\mid U) = \\frac{P(U \\mid G) P(G)}{P(U)}$. To use this, we first need to calculate the total probability of being unaffected, $P(U)$, using the law of total probability:\n$P(U) = P(U \\mid G_{Aa})P(G_{Aa}) + P(U \\mid G_{aa})P(G_{aa})$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$P(U) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nWith $P(U)$ calculated, we can find the posterior probabilities for each genotype.\n\nFor genotype $aa$:\n$P(G_{aa} \\mid U) = \\frac{P(U \\mid G_{aa}) P(G_{aa})}{P(U)}$\n$P(G_{aa} \\mid U) = \\frac{1 \\times \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n\nFor genotype $Aa$:\n$P(G_{Aa} \\mid U) = \\frac{P(U \\mid G_{Aa}) P(G_{Aa})}{P(U)}$\n$P(G_{Aa} \\mid U) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nAs a check, the sum of the posterior probabilities should be $1$:\n$P(G_{aa} \\mid U) + P(G_{Aa} \\mid U) = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$.\nThe results are consistent. The requested probabilities are $P(aa \\mid \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{5}{6}$ and $P(Aa \\mid \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{1}{6}$.

The inbreeding coefficient of an individual is the probability that the two alleles at any autosomal locus are identical by descent (IBD). It can be calculated by summing the contributions of all independent paths of descent connecting the individual's parents through their common ancestors.\n\nThe parents of individual $4-1$ are individual $2-1$ (the father) and individual $3-1$ (the mother). Individual $2-1$ is the maternal uncle of individual $3-1$.\n\nWe must identify the common ancestors of the parents, $2-1$ and $3-1$.\n- The parents of $2-1$ are the founders $1-1$ and $1-2$.\n- The parents of $3-1$ are $2-2$ and $2-3$.\n- The parents of $2-2$ are the founders $1-1$ and $1-2$.\nTherefore, the common ancestors of $2-1$ and $3-1$ are $1-1$ and $1-2$.\n\nThe formula for the inbreeding coefficient $F_I$ of an individual $I$ is given by Wright's path-counting method:\n$$F_I = \\sum \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_1+n_2+1} (1 + F_A)$$\nwhere the sum is over all unique common ancestors $A$ of the parents of $I$. Here, $n_1$ is the number of generations separating one parent from $A$, and $n_2$ is the number of generations separating the other parent from $A$. The term $F_A$ is the inbreeding coefficient of the common ancestor $A$. In this problem, all founders ($1-1$, $1-2$, and $2-3$) are stated to be non-inbred, so their inbreeding coefficients are a priori $0$. Thus, $F_{1-1} = 0$ and $F_{1-2} = 0$.\n\nWe enumerate the contributions from the two common ancestors:\n\n1.  Contribution via common ancestor $1-1$: For the parents $2-1$ and $3-1$, the common ancestor is $1-1$.\n    - The path from parent $2-1$ to ancestor $1-1$ spans $n_1=1$ generation.\n    - The path from parent $3-1$ to ancestor $1-1$ goes through $2-2$, spanning $n_2=2$ generations.\n    - The contribution is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+2+1}(1+F_{1-1}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4(1+0) = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n2.

Let the deleterious recessive allele be denoted by $a$ and the dominant allele by $A$. The frequency of allele $a$ in the base population is given as $q$. An individual is affected if their genotype is $aa$.\n\nThe probability of having genotype $aa$ can be determined by considering two mutually exclusive events based on the identity by descent (IBD) status of the two alleles at the locus. The total probability is given by the law of total probability:\n$$P(aa) = P(aa \\mid \\text{IBD}) P(\\text{IBD}) + P(aa \\mid \\text{not IBD}) P(\\text{not IBD})$$\nBy definition, $P(\\text{IBD})$ is the inbreeding coefficient $F_{4-1}$, which we found to be $\\frac{1}{8}$. Consequently, $P(\\text{not IBD}) = 1 - F_{4-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nWe evaluate the conditional probabilities:\n1.  $P(aa \\mid \\text{IBD})$: If the two alleles are identical by descent, they are copies of a single allele from a common ancestor. For the individual to be of genotype $aa$, this single ancestral allele must have been $a$. Since the founders are drawn from a large, randomly mating population, the probability that a random allele in the founding generation is $a$ is its population frequency, $q$. Thus, $P(aa \\mid \\text{IBD}) = q$.\n\n2.  $P(aa \\mid \\text{not IBD})$: If the two alleles are not identical by descent, they can be considered as two independent draws from the gene pool of the base population. The base population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The probability of drawing one $a$ allele is $q$, and the probability of independently drawing a second $a$ allele is also $q$. Therefore, $P(aa \\mid \\text{not IBD}) = q \\times q = q^2$.\n\nSubstituting these probabilities back into the total probability formula:\n$$P(\\text{affected in } 4-1) = P(aa) = (q) \\left(F_{4-1}\\right) + (q^2) \\left(1 - F_{4-1}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the calculated value $F_{4-1} = \\frac{1}{8}$:\n$$P(\\text{affected in } 4-1) = q\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) + q^2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{8}\\right)$$\n$$P(\\text{affected in } 4-1) = \\frac{1}{8}q + \\frac{7}{8}q^2$$\nThis expression can be written as $\\frac{7q^2+q}{8}$.\n\nThe two required results are $F_{4-1} = \\frac{1}{8}$ and $P(\\text{affected in } 4-1) = \\frac{7q^2+q}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{7q^2+q}{8}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5069956"}]}
