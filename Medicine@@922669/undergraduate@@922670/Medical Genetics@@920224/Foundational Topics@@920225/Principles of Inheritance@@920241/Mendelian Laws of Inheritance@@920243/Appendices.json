It describes a classic scenario of autosomal recessive inheritance. The problem is well-posed, stating all necessary assumptions and providing all data required for a unique solution. These assumptions—Mendel's laws, random gamete fusion, complete penetrance, no mutation, and independence of events—are standard and necessary for creating a formal, solvable model. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of any scientific or factual unsoundness, incompleteness, contradictions, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of a probability for a sequence of independent events, which can be modeled using the principles of Mendelian genetics and binomial probability.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability of a single child being affected by the autosomal recessive disease. The parents are both heterozygous carriers, with genotypes $Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $1/2$.\n\nThe possible genotypes of an offspring are determined by the random union of these gametes. We can use a Punnett square to visualize the outcomes and their associated probabilities:\n\n-   Probability of genotype $AA$: $P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Probability of genotype $Aa$: $(P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother})) + (P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother})) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Probability of genotype $aa$: $P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe disease is expressed only in individuals with the genotype $aa$, and penetrance is complete. Therefore, the probability that any given child is affected is equal to the probability of that child having the $aa$ genotype. Let $p$ be the probability of a child being affected.\n$$p = P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nConsequently, the probability that a child is unaffected (having genotype $AA$ or $Aa$) is $q$.\n$$q = P(\\text{unaffected}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nAlternatively, $q = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe couple plans to have $n=3$ children. The outcome for each child is an independent event. We need to find the probability that exactly $k=1$ of these $3$ children will be affected. This scenario is described by the binomial probability distribution. The probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials is given by the formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$$\nHere, a \"success\" is defined as a child being affected. We substitute the values $n=3$, $k=1$, $p=1/4$, and $q=3/4$ into the formula:\n$$P(X=1) = \\binom{3}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^1 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{3-1}$$\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{1}$ represents the number of ways to choose $1$ affected child out of $3$ children, which is calculated as:\n$$\\binom{3}{1} = \\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = \\frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3$$\nNow, we can compute the final probability:\n$$P(X=1) = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$$\n$$P(X=1) = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{9}{16}$$\n$$P(X=1) = \\frac{3 \\times 1 \\times 9}{4 \\times 16} = \\frac{27}{64}$$\nThis is the probability that exactly one of the three children will be affected. The result is an exact fraction as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{27}{64}}$$", "id": "5058315"}, {"introduction": "While standard Mendelian ratios provide a baseline, real biological systems often present variations, such as lethal alleles that alter expected outcomes.

A solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem describes a cross between two heterozygous parents, both of genotype $Aa$.\n$$\nAa \\times Aa\n$$\nAccording to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces gametes containing allele $A$ and allele $a$ with equal probability. Thus, for each parent, the probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$ is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$ is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring at conception and their corresponding probabilities can be determined by considering the random combination of these gametes. A Punnett square is a useful tool for this analysis.\n\n|          | Parent 2: $A$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | Parent 2: $a$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) |\n|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Parent 1: $A$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $AA$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          | $Aa$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n| Parent 1: $a$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $aA$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          | $aa$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n\nThe probabilities for each offspring genotype at conception are:\n-   Probability of genotype $AA$: $P(AA) = P(A) \\times P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Probability of genotype $Aa$: $P(Aa) = (P(A) \\times P(a)) + (P(a) \\times P(A)) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   Probability of genotype $aa$: $P(aa) = P(a) \\times P(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected. The initial Mendelian genotypic ratio is $1:2:1$ for $AA:Aa:aa$.\n\nThe problem states that the genotype $AA$ is embryonic lethal. This means that individuals with this genotype do not survive to be born. Therefore, they are excluded from the population of liveborn offspring. The viable (liveborn) genotypes are $Aa$ and $aa$.\n\nThe total probability of an offspring being liveborn is the sum of the probabilities of the viable genotypes:\n$$\nP(\\text{liveborn}) = P(Aa) + P(aa) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe problem asks for $p$, the probability that a randomly selected **liveborn** offspring exhibits the phenotype. This is a conditional probability. The event of exhibiting the phenotype corresponds to the genotype $Aa$, as given in the problem statement.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a liveborn offspring exhibits the phenotype, and let $L$ be the event that an offspring is liveborn. We are asked to compute $p = P(E|L)$.\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\np = P(E|L) = \\frac{P(E \\cap L)}{P(L)}\n$$\nThe event $E \\cap L$ is \"the offspring exhibits the phenotype AND is liveborn\". The only genotype that satisfies both conditions is $Aa$. Therefore, the event $E \\cap L$ is equivalent to the offspring having the genotype $Aa$. The probability of this event at conception is $P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the probabilities into the conditional probability formula:\n$$\np = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(\\text{liveborn})} = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(Aa) + P(aa)}\n$$\nUsing the values we calculated:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}}\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThus, among the liveborn offspring, the expected genotypic ratio is $2:1$ for $Aa:aa$.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, determining the probabilities of the relevant offspring phenotypes from the specified genetic cross, and second, applying a combinatorial formula to calculate the probability of the specified family composition.\n\n**Step I: Offspring Phenotype Probabilities**\n\nThe cross is between a dihybrid individual, $AaBb$, and a homozygous recessive individual, $aabb$.\n\n1.  **Gamete Formation**:\n    -   The heterozygous parent ($AaBb$) produces four types of gametes due to independent assortment: $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$. According to the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, each gamete is produced with equal probability: $P(AB) = P(Ab) = P(aB) = P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   The homozygous recessive parent ($aabb$) produces only one type of gamete: $ab$, with a probability of $1$.\n\n2.  **Offspring Genotypes and Phenotypes**:\n    We can determine the expected genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of the offspring by combining the gametes.\n    -   Gamete $AB$ from parent 1 and $ab$ from parent 2 yields genotype $AaBb$. The phenotype is dominant at both loci (A and B). This is the \"double dominant phenotype\". The probability of this outcome for any given child is $P(\\text{double dominant}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   Gamete $Ab$ from parent 1 and $ab$ from parent 2 yields genotype $Aabb$. The phenotype is dominant at locus A and recessive at locus B. The probability is $P(A-bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   Gamete $aB$ from parent 1 and $ab$ from parent 2 yields genotype $aaBb$. The phenotype is recessive at locus A and dominant at locus B. The probability is $P(aaB-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   Gamete $ab$ from parent 1 and $ab$ from parent 2 yields genotype $aabb$. The phenotype is recessive at both loci. This is the \"double recessive phenotype\". The probability of this outcome for any given child is $P(\\text{double recessive}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $p_{DD}$ be the probability of a child having the double dominant phenotype, so $p_{DD} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nLet $p_{RR}$ be the probability of a child having the double recessive phenotype, so $p_{RR} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe probability of a child having any other phenotype is $p_{\\text{Other}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of probabilities is $p_{DD} + p_{RR} + p_{\\text{Other}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as expected.\n\n**Step II: Multinomial Probability Calculation**\n\nWe are asked for the probability of a specific composition of $n=5$ children: exactly $k_{DD}=3$ with the double dominant phenotype and exactly $k_{RR}=2$ with the double recessive phenotype. This implies that there are $k_{\\text{Other}} = n - k_{DD} - k_{RR} = 5 - 3 - 2 = 0$ children with any other phenotype.\n\nThis is a problem of multiple discrete outcomes for a fixed number of independent trials, which is described by the multinomial distribution. The probability of obtaining exactly $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ outcomes in $n$ trials, where the probabilities of the outcomes are $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$, is given by the formula:\n$$ P(X_1=k_1, \\ldots, X_m=k_m) = \\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \\cdots k_m!} p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_m^{k_m} $$\nIn our case, $n=5$, and the outcomes are:\n-   Outcome 1: Double dominant phenotype, with $k_{DD}=3$ and $p_{DD}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Outcome 2: Double recessive phenotype, with $k_{RR}=2$ and $p_{RR}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Outcome 3: Other phenotype, with $k_{\\text{Other}}=0$ and $p_{\\text{Other}}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the multinomial formula:\n$$ P(\\text{3 DD, 2 RR, 0 Other}) = \\frac{5!}{3! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 0!} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0 $$\n\nNow, we compute each part of the expression.\n1.  The multinomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to arrange the outcomes:\n    $$ \\frac{5!}{3! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 0!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 $$\n    This is equivalent to the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{3}$ or $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n\n2.  The probability of any one specific arrangement (e.g., DDDDRR):\n    $$ p_{DD}^3 \\cdot p_{RR}^2 \\cdot p_{\\text{Other}}^0 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^5 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4^5} $$\n    Calculating the denominator: $4^5 = (2^2)^5 = 2^{10} = 1024$.\n    So, the probability term is $\\frac{1}{1024}$.\n\n3.  The total probability is the product of the number of arrangements and the probability of one arrangement:\n    $$ P = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{10}{1024} $$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer as a simplified fraction. We simplify by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$.\n$$ \\frac{10 \\div 2}{1024 \\div 2} = \\frac{5}{512} $$\nTherefore, the probability that the couple has exactly $3$ children with the double dominant phenotype and $2$ with the double recessive phenotype is $\\frac{5}{512}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{512}}$$", "id": "5058308"}]}
