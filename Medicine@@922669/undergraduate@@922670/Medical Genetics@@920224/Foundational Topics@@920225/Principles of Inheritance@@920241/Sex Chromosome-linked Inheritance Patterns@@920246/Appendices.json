The standard phenotype is a white crest. Through extensive breeding experiments, it is determined that the crest color is controlled by a single gene located on the X chromosome. The allele for the blue crest, denoted as $C$, is dominant over the allele for the white crest, denoted as $c$.\n\nA male finch with a vibrant blue crest mates with a female finch that has a normal white crest. Assuming Mendelian inheritance patterns for this sex-linked trait, which one of the following statements accurately describes the expected phenotypic distribution among their direct offspring (the F1 generation)?\n\nA. 50% of the daughters will have a blue crest, and 50% of the sons will have a blue crest.\n\nB.

A dominant allele on the $X$ chromosome is expressed in both hemizygous males and heterozygous or homozygous females. Although avian species typically have a $ZW$ system, the problem explicitly specifies an $X$-linked gene; we follow this assumption.\n\nAssign alleles: $C$ is the dominant blue-crest allele, $c$ is the recessive white-crest allele.\n- The male has a blue crest and is $XY$, so his genotype must be $X^{C}Y$ (one $C$ allele on his single $X$ suffices for the dominant phenotype).\n- The female has a white crest and is $XX$, so with a dominant $C$, she must be homozygous recessive $X^{c}X^{c}$ (a heterozygote $X^{C}X^{c}$ would be blue).\n\nGametes:\n- Male $X^{C}Y$ produces $X^{C}$ or $Y$ gametes.\n- Female $X^{c}X^{c}$ produces only $X^{c}$ gametes.\n\nZygote combinations and phenotypes:\n- Daughters receive the paternal $X$ and the maternal $X$: $X^{C}$ (from father) with $X^{c}$ (from mother) gives $X^{C}X^{c}$, which is phenotypically blue due to the dominant $C$.\n- Sons receive the paternal $Y$ and the maternal $X$: $Y$ (from father) with $X^{c}$ (from mother) gives $X^{c}Y$, which is phenotypically white because only $c$ is present on the single $X$.\n\nTherefore, all daughters will have a blue crest, and all sons will have a white crest, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1520250"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics of a single genetic cross, this practice [@problem_id:1507945] delves into the analysis of a simple pedigree for an X-linked recessive disorder.

The disorder is X-linked recessive.\n\nGeorge is affected, so his genotype is $X^{c}Y$. His wife has normal vision with no family history; we take this to mean she is not a carrier, so her genotype is $X^{N}X^{N}$. Sons inherit their X chromosome from their mother and Y from their father, so Henry must be $X^{N}Y$ (normal).\n\nHenry passes $X^{N}$ to all daughters.

Her mother is an obligate carrier for the disorder.

Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a posterior probability using the principles of Mendelian genetics and Bayesian inference. Let us define the events and parameters rigorously.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that the woman is a heterozygous carrier for the X-linked recessive allele. Her genotype would be $X^A X^a$, where $X^A$ is the normal allele and $X^a$ is the mutant allele.\nLet $N$ be the event that the woman is not a carrier, meaning she is homozygous for the normal allele. Her genotype would be $X^A X^A$.\nLet $S_k$ be the event that the woman has $k$ sons, all of whom are clinically unaffected by the disorder.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier, given the evidence of her $k$ unaffected sons, $P(C | S_k)$. The fact that her mother is an obligate carrier provides the basis for our prior probabilities.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(C | S_k) = \\frac{P(S_k | C) P(C)}{P(S_k)}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we must determine each term based on the provided information.\n\nFirst, we determine the prior probability, $P(C)$. The woman's mother is an obligate carrier, which means her genotype is $X^A X^a$. The woman is phenotypically normal, so her father must have a normal phenotype; his genotype is $X^A Y$. The woman inherits one X chromosome from her mother and one from her father.\nFrom her father, she must inherit the $X^A$ chromosome.\nFrom her mother ($X^A X^a$), she has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the $X^A$ allele and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the $X^a$ allele.\nTherefore, the woman's possible genotypes are $X^A X^A$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) or $X^A X^a$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe event $C$ corresponds to the genotype $X^A X^a$, and the event $N$ corresponds to the genotype $X^A X^A$.\nThe problem states that heterozygous females are phenotypically normal, so the woman's normal phenotype is consistent with both possibilities. Thus, the prior probabilities are:\n$$\nP(C) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\nP(N) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the likelihood, $P(S_k | C)$. This is the probability of observing $k$ unaffected sons, given that the woman is a carrier (genotype $X^A X^a$). A son inherits his single X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. If the mother is a carrier, she can transmit either $X^A$ or $X^a$ to a son, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nA son inheriting $X^A$ will have genotype $X^A Y$ and be unaffected. This occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nA son inheriting $X^a$ will have genotype $X^a Y$ and be affected, as the problem states complete penetrance in males. This occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that any one son is unaffected, given the mother is a carrier, is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince the genotypes of the sons are conditionally independent given the mother's genotype, the probability of having $k$ unaffected sons is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(S_k | C) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k = \\frac{1}{2^k}\n$$\n\nThird, we expand the denominator of Bayes' theorem, $P(S_k)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(S_k) = P(S_k | C) P(C) + P(S_k | N) P(N)\n$$\nWe need to find $P(S_k | N)$, the probability of having $k$ unaffected sons given the woman is not a carrier (genotype $X^A X^A$). If she is of this genotype, she can only transmit the $X^A$ allele to her offspring. Therefore, any son she has will have the genotype $X^A Y$ and be unaffected. The probability of one son being unaffected is $1$. For $k$ sons, the probability is:\n$$\nP(S_k | N) = 1^k = 1\n$$\nNow, we can compute the total probability of the evidence $S_k$:\n$$\nP(S_k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 + 2^k}{2^{k+1}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all components back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(C | S_k) = \\frac{P(S_k | C) P(C)}{P(S_k)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{1 + 2^k}{2^{k+1}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}}{\\frac{1 + 2^k}{2^{k+1}}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final answer:\n$$\nP(C | S_k) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2^k}\n$$\nThis expression represents the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier, updated from the prior probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ by the evidence of having $k$ unaffected sons. For $k=0$, the probability is $\\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which matches the prior probability, as expected. As $k$ increases, the probability approaches $0$, reflecting the growing evidence against her being a carrier.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1+2^k}}\n$$", "id": "2815654"}]}
