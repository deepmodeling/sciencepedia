All concepts (autosomal recessive inheritance, allele frequency, HWE, penetrance) are fundamental and correctly stated. The allele frequencies are realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and constraints (allele frequencies, mode of inheritance, unaffected status of parents) to calculate a unique, meaningful probability. The assumptions (HWE, no new mutations) are explicitly stated to create a solvable, idealized model.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem statement is both complete and internally consistent. The crucial information that both partners are phenotypically unaffected is provided, which is essential for calculating their respective carrier probabilities. There are no contradictions.\n- **Feasibility**: The scenario is a realistic and common problem encountered in genetic counseling. The calculations required are standard and feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and complete. It meets all criteria for a solvable problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the probability that a child of the specified couple will be affected by the autosomal recessive disease. An individual is affected if and only if their genotype is homozygous for the recessive allele, denoted as $aa$. For a child to have genotype $aa$, both parents must be heterozygous carriers (genotype $Aa$) and both must transmit the recessive allele ($a$) to the child.\n\nThe overall probability is the product of the probabilities of three independent events:\n$1$. The probability that Partner A is a carrier, $P(A_{\\text{carrier}})$.\n$2$. The probability that Partner B is a carrier, $P(B_{\\text{carrier}})$.\n$3$. The probability that two carrier parents have an affected child, which is $\\frac{1}{4}$ according to Mendelian genetics.\n\nTherefore, the risk to the child, $P(\\text{child is } aa)$, is given by:\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = P(A_{\\text{carrier}}) \\times P(B_{\\text{carrier}}) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nWe must first determine the probability that each partner is a carrier, given that they are phenotypically unaffected. For a general population in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with a wild-type allele frequency $p$ and a recessive disease allele frequency $q$ (where $p+q=1$), the genotype frequencies at birth are:\n- $P(AA) = p^2$ (homozygous wild-type, unaffected)\n- $P(Aa) = 2pq$ (heterozygous, carrier, unaffected)\n- $P(aa) = q^2$ (homozygous recessive, affected)\n\nAn individual being \"unaffected\" means their genotype is either $AA$ or $Aa$. The probability of an individual from the general population being unaffected is $P(\\text{unaffected}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = p^2 + 2pq$. This can also be expressed as $1 - P(aa) = 1 - q^2$.\n\nThe probability of being a carrier is $P(Aa) = 2pq$. The probability that a phenotypically unaffected individual is a carrier is a conditional probability:\n$$P(\\text{carrier} | \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{P(\\text{carrier} \\cap \\text{unaffected})}{P(\\text{unaffected})}$$\nSince carriers ($Aa$) are by definition unaffected for a recessive disease, the event \"carrier and unaffected\" is identical to the event \"carrier\". Thus:\n$$P(\\text{carrier} | \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{P(\\text{carrier})}{P(\\text{unaffected})} = \\frac{2pq}{p^2 + 2pq}$$\nUsing the relation $p = 1 - q$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$P(\\text{carrier} | \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{2(1-q)q}{(1-q)^2 + 2(1-q)q} = \\frac{2(1-q)q}{(1-q)[(1-q) + 2q]} = \\frac{2q}{1+q}$$\nThis is the general formula for the carrier risk of an unaffected individual from a population in HWE.\n\nNow we apply this formula to each partner.\nFor Partner A, from a population where the allele frequency is $q_A = 0.02$:\n$$P(A_{\\text{carrier}}) = \\frac{2q_A}{1+q_A} = \\frac{2(0.02)}{1+0.02} = \\frac{0.04}{1.02}$$\n\nFor Partner B, from a population where the allele frequency is $q_B = 0.005$:\n$$P(B_{\\text{carrier}}) = \\frac{2q_B}{1+q_B} = \\frac{2(0.005)}{1+0.005} = \\frac{0.01}{1.005}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of the child being affected:\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = P(A_{\\text{carrier}}) \\times P(B_{\\text{carrier}}) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = \\left( \\frac{2q_A}{1+q_A} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{2q_B}{1+q_B} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4 q_A q_B}{4(1+q_A)(1+q_B)} = \\frac{q_A q_B}{(1+q_A)(1+q_B)}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$q_A = 0.02$$\n$$q_B = 0.005$$\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = \\frac{(0.02)(0.005)}{(1+0.02)(1+0.005)} = \\frac{0.0001}{(1.02)(1.005)}$$\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$(1.02) \\times (1.005) = 1.0251$$\nNow, perform the division:\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = \\frac{0.0001}{1.0251} \\approx 0.000097551458...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is the first significant figure.\n$$0.00009755$$\n\nThe final pre-test risk that the child will be affected is $0.00009755$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00009755}$$", "id": "5036061"}, {"introduction": "Carrier screening is a powerful tool for risk reduction, but a negative result does not always eliminate risk due to the imperfect sensitivity of genetic tests.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the residual risk that a future child will be affected by the condition, given that both partners have tested negative. Let us define the following events:\n- $C_1$: Partner $1$ is a carrier.\n- $C_2$: Partner $2$ is a carrier.\n- $N_1$: Partner $1$ tests negative.\n- $N_2$: Partner $2$ tests negative.\n- $A$: A future child is affected.\n\nWe are asked to find the conditional probability $P(A | N_1 \\cap N_2)$.\n\nFor an autosomal recessive condition with no de novo mutations, a child can only be affected if both parents are carriers. The probability of having an affected child, given that both parents are carriers, is given as $P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2) = \\frac{1}{4}$. If at least one parent is not a carrier, the probability of an affected child is $0$.\n\nWe can express the desired probability using the law of total probability, conditioning on the carrier status of the parents:\n$$P(A | N_1 \\cap N_2) = P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2 \\cap N_1 \\cap N_2) P(C_1 \\cap C_2 | N_1 \\cap N_2)$$\nThe events of the child's genotype are conditionally independent of the parents' test results, given the parents' genotypes. Therefore, $P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2 \\cap N_1 \\cap N_2) = P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThis simplifies our expression to:\n$$P(A | N_1 \\cap N_2) = \\frac{1}{4} P(C_1 \\cap C_2 | N_1 \\cap N_2)$$\nOur task is now to find the joint posterior probability that both partners are carriers, given their negative test results.\n\nThe problem states that the partners are unrelated and their carrier statuses are independent. The screening tests performed on each partner are also independent events. This means that the posterior probability of Partner $1$ being a carrier is independent of Partner $2$'s test result, and vice versa. Therefore, the joint posterior probability is the product of the individual posterior probabilities:\n$$P(C_1 \\cap C_2 | N_1 \\cap N_2) = P(C_1 | N_1) P(C_2 | N_2)$$\nWe must now calculate the posterior probability of being a carrier for each partner individually, using Bayes' theorem. Let's compute this for an arbitrary partner $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The posterior probability $P(C_i | N_i)$ is given by:\n$$P(C_i | N_i) = \\frac{P(N_i | C_i) P(C_i)}{P(N_i)}$$\nLet's analyze each term in this expression:\n1.  $P(C_i)$: This is the prior (pre-test) probability that partner $i$ is a carrier, given as $c_i$.\n2.  $P(N_i | C_i)$: This is the probability of a negative test result given that partner $i$ is a carrier. The detection rate, $d_i$, is the probability of a positive test given the person is a carrier ($P(\\text{positive} | C_i)$). Since a test is either positive or negative, this term is the false negative rate: $P(N_i | C_i) = 1 - d_i$.\n3.  $P(N_i)$: This is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. We calculate this using the law of total probability, conditioning on the carrier status of partner $i$:\n    $$P(N_i) = P(N_i | C_i) P(C_i) + P(N_i | \\neg C_i) P(\\neg C_i)$$\n    - $P(\\neg C_i)$ is the probability that partner $i$ is not a carrier, which is $1 - P(C_i) = 1 - c_i$.\n    - $P(N_i | \\neg C_i)$ is the probability of a negative test given that partner $i$ is not a carrier. This is the test's specificity, which is given as perfect ($1$).\n    Substituting these values:\n    $$P(N_i) = (1 - d_i) c_i + (1)(1 - c_i) = c_i - c_i d_i + 1 - c_i = 1 - c_i d_i$$\n\nNow we can substitute these components back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability for partner $i$:\n$$P(C_i | N_i) = \\frac{(1 - d_i) c_i}{1 - c_i d_i}$$\nThis expression represents the residual risk for partner $i$ to be a carrier after receiving a negative test result.\n\nApplying this result for Partner $1$ and Partner $2$:\n- The posterior carrier probability for Partner $1$ is $P(C_1 | N_1) = \\frac{c_1(1 - d_1)}{1 - c_1 d_1}$.\n- The posterior carrier probability for Partner $2$ is $P(C_2 | N_2) = \\frac{c_2(1 - d_2)}{1 - c_2 d_2}$.\n\nThe joint posterior probability that both are carriers is the product of these individual probabilities:\n$$P(C_1 \\cap C_2 | N_1 \\cap N_2) = \\left( \\frac{c_1(1 - d_1)}{1 - c_1 d_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{c_2(1 - d_2)}{1 - c_2 d_2} \\right)$$\nFinally, the residual risk of having an affected child is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this joint probability:\n$$P(A | N_1 \\cap N_2) = \\frac{1}{4} P(C_1 \\cap C_2 | N_1 \\cap N_2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{c_1(1 - d_1)}{1 - c_1 d_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{c_2(1 - d_2)}{1 - c_2 d_2} \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the couple's residual risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{c_{1}(1 - d_{1})}{1 - c_{1}d_{1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c_{2}(1 - d_{2})}{1 - c_{2}d_{2}}\\right)}$$", "id": "5036153"}, {"introduction": "While population frequencies provide a crucial starting point, a known family history dramatically alters our initial risk assessment.

Extraction of Givens**\n- A nuclear family has two phenotypically unaffected parents who are untested.\n- They have two children: one is affected with a fully penetrant autosomal recessive disease, the other is unaffected.\n- The disease is caused by a single pathogenic variant.\n- The disease is rare, and de novo mutations, non-paternity, and affected children without two carrier parents are considered negligible.\n- The unaffected sibling undergoes a molecular test.\n- The test's sensitivity for carrier detection is $S$.\n- The test's specificity is perfect (no false positives).\n\n**2. Validation using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics (autosomal recessive inheritance) and probability theory (conditional probability and Bayes' theorem). All assumptions, such as full penetrance and the rarity of the disease, are standard for simplifying pedigree analysis in a theoretical context.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, consistent information to derive the two requested probabilities. The objectives are clearly stated.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective content.\n\n**3. Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined problem in medical genetics that can be solved from first principles.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet the normal allele be denoted by $A$ and the pathogenic recessive allele by $a$. Given that the disease is autosomal recessive, the genotypes map to phenotypes as follows:\n- $AA$: Unaffected, non-carrier.\n- $Aa$: Unaffected, carrier.\n- $aa$: Affected.\n\nThe problem states that the parents are phenotypically unaffected and have one affected child. An affected child has the genotype $aa$ and must inherit one $a$ allele from each parent. Since the parents are themselves unaffected, their genotype cannot be $aa$. Therefore, both parents must be heterozygous carriers with the genotype $Aa$.\n\nThe Mendelian segregation of alleles from two carrier parents ($Aa \\times Aa$) results in the following genotypic probabilities for any given offspring:\n- $P(\\text{genotype is } AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(\\text{genotype is } Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(\\text{genotype is } aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Part 1: Posterior Probability of Being a Carrier (Prior to Testing)**\n\nWe are asked for the probability that the unaffected sibling is a carrier. This is a conditional probability. Let $U$ be the event that a child is phenotypically unaffected, and let $C$ be the event that a child is a carrier (genotype $Aa$). We need to find $P(C|U)$.\n\nThe event $U$ corresponds to the genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$. The total probability of a child being unaffected is:\n$$P(U) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe event $C$ corresponds to the genotype $Aa$. The probability of being a carrier, $P(C)$, is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe intersection of the events $C$ and $U$ ($C \\cap U$) is the event of being a carrier AND being unaffected. Since all carriers ($Aa$) are unaffected, this intersection is simply the event $C$. Thus, $P(C \\cap U) = P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(C|U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)}$, we can calculate the probability that the unaffected sibling is a carrier:\n$$P(C|U) = \\frac{P(C)}{P(U)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThis is the prior probability of the unaffected sibling being a carrier, given the family history.\n\n**Part 2: Posterior Probability of Being a Carrier (Conditional on a Negative Test)**\n\nNow, we update this probability using the result of a molecular test. Let $T_{neg}$ be the event that the unaffected sibling receives a negative test result. We want to find the posterior probability $P(C | U \\cap T_{neg})$. As the person being tested is the same unaffected sibling from Part 1, the event $C$ is already conditioned on $U$. Therefore, we seek to calculate $P(C|T_{neg})$, where our prior probabilities for the sibling's status are based on them being unaffected.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C|T_{neg}) = \\frac{P(T_{neg}|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(T_{neg})}$$\n\nLet's define the components:\n1.  $P(C)$: This is the prior probability that the unaffected sibling is a carrier, which we calculated as $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n2.  Let $NC$ be the event that the unaffected sibling is a non-carrier (genotype $AA$). The prior probability is $P(NC) = P(AA | U) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n3.  $P(T_{neg}|C)$: This is the conditional probability of a negative test given the sibling is a carrier. This is related to the test's sensitivity, $S$. Sensitivity is defined as $S = P(T_{pos}|C)$, the probability of a positive test in a carrier. Therefore, the probability of a false negative is:\n    $$P(T_{neg}|C) = 1 - S$$\n\n4.  $P(T_{neg})$: This is the total probability of a negative test result. We calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the possible genotypes of the unaffected sibling:\n    $$P(T_{neg}) = P(T_{neg}|C) \\cdot P(C) + P(T_{neg}|NC) \\cdot P(NC)$$\n    We need $P(T_{neg}|NC)$, the probability of a negative test given the sibling is a non-carrier. This is the test's specificity. The problem states the specificity is perfect, meaning there are no false positives.\n    $$Specificity = P(T_{neg}|NC) = 1$$\n    Now we can calculate $P(T_{neg})$:\n    $$P(T_{neg}) = (1 - S) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} + (1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2(1-S)}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2 - 2S + 1}{3} = \\frac{3-2S}{3}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all these components back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C|T_{neg}) = \\frac{P(T_{neg}|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(T_{neg})} = \\frac{(1 - S) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{3-2S}{3}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $3$ simplifies the expression:\n$$P(C|T_{neg}) = \\frac{2(1-S)}{3-2S}$$\n\nThe two requested probabilities are $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{2(1-S)}{3-2S}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{2(1-S)}{3-2S} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5036161"}]}
