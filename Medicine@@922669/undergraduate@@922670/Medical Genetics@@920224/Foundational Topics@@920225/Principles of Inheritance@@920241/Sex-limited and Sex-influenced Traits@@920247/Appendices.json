{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the nuances of sex-influenced inheritance begins with mastering the fundamental concept of \"dominance reversal.\" This introductory problem provides a classic scenario where an allele that is dominant in one sex is recessive in the other. By predicting the phenotypes of the F1 generation from a pure-breeding cross, you will practice applying these sex-specific rules of expression to a single heterozygous genotype [@problem_id:1519952].", "problem": "In the fictional species of Crimson-Crested Sunlizard (*Solisaurus rubicrista*), the presence of a vibrant, inflatable throat pouch is a trait governed by a single gene with two alleles: the allele for pouch development ($P$) and the allele for no pouch ($p$). The expression of this trait is sex-influenced. In males, the allele for a pouch ($P$) is dominant over the allele for no pouch ($p$). In females, the allele for a pouch ($P$) is recessive to the allele for no pouch ($p$).\n\nA pure-breeding male lizard that displays a prominent throat pouch is crossed with a pure-breeding female lizard that completely lacks a pouch. Assuming a typical Mendelian inheritance pattern for the alleles, which of the following statements correctly describes the expected phenotypes of their first-generation (F1) offspring?\n\nA. All F1 offspring, both male and female, will have a throat pouch.\n\nB. All F1 offspring, both male and female, will lack a throat pouch.\n\nC. All F1 male offspring will lack a throat pouch, while all F1 female offspring will have a throat pouch.\n\nD. All F1 male offspring will have a throat pouch, while all F1 female offspring will lack a throat pouch.\n\nE. 50% of the male offspring will have a throat pouch, and 50% of the female offspring will have a throat pouch.\n\nF. All F1 offspring will have a pouch of intermediate size.", "solution": "The trait is sex-influenced with different dominance in the two sexes. In males, $P$ is dominant to $p$, so male phenotypes are: pouch for $PP$ or $Pp$, and no pouch for $pp$. In females, $P$ is recessive to $p$, so female phenotypes are: pouch only for $PP$, and no pouch for $Pp$ or $pp$.\n\nThe male parent is described as pure-breeding with a pouch. Pure-breeding implies homozygosity, and since a male with a pouch must carry at least one $P$, the male genotype is $PP$. The female parent is described as pure-breeding without a pouch. Pure-breeding again implies homozygosity, and in females the no-pouch phenotype occurs for $Pp$ or $pp$, but only $pp$ is homozygous, so the female genotype is $pp$.\n\nCrossing these parents gives:\n$$PP \\times pp \\rightarrow \\text{F1 all } Pp.$$\nThe gametes are $P$ from the male and $p$ from the female, so every F1 offspring is $Pp$.\n\nApplying the sex-influenced expression to the F1:\n- For F1 males with genotype $Pp$, because $P$ is dominant in males, they express a pouch.\n- For F1 females with genotype $Pp$, because $P$ is recessive in females, they do not express a pouch.\n\nTherefore, all F1 male offspring will have a throat pouch, and all F1 female offspring will lack a throat pouch, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1519952"}, {"introduction": "In nature, organisms are a mosaic of traits governed by different inheritance patterns. This exercise elevates the challenge by presenting a cross involving two independent genes: one exhibiting sex-limited expression and the other showing sex-influenced expression. Solving this problem requires you to carefully distinguish between these two modes of inheritance and synthesize your understanding with the principle of independent assortment to accurately predict outcomes in the offspring [@problem_id:1519981].", "problem": "In a fictional species of mountain ungulate known as the Glimmerhorn, two genetic traits are under investigation: horn shape and coat color. The genes for these two traits assort independently.\n\nHorn shape is a sex-limited trait. The allele for normal, straight horns, denoted by $H$, is dominant. The recessive allele, $h$, causes curled horns, a phenotype that is only expressed in males. Females with the $hh$ genotype have normal horns.\n\nCoat color is a sex-influenced trait. The allele for black coat color, $B$, is dominant in males but recessive in females. The allele for a brown coat, $b$, is recessive in males but dominant in females.\n\nA male Glimmerhorn with curled horns and a black coat is crossed with a female Glimmerhorn that has a brown coat. It is known that the male's father had a brown coat. The female is known to be heterozygous for the horn-shape gene, and her mother had a black coat.\n\nAssuming these are the only alleles involved, what proportion of their female offspring are expected to have normal horns and a brown coat? Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "We use Mendelian inheritance with independent assortment of the two genes and account for sex-limited and sex-influenced expression.\n\nHorn shape (sex-limited): $H$ dominant for normal horns; $h$ recessive for curled horns but expressed only in males. Therefore:\n- The male with curled horns must be $hh$.\n- The given female is heterozygous, $Hh$.\n- All female offspring, regardless of $H/h$ genotype, have normal horns because the curled phenotype is male-limited. Hence, among female offspring, the horn phenotype is always normal.\n\nCoat color (sex-influenced): In males, $B$ is dominant (male black if $BB$ or $Bb$; brown only if $bb$). In females, $b$ is dominant (female black only if $BB$; brown if $Bb$ or $bb$).\n\nDeduce parental coat genotypes:\n- The male is black and his father was a brown-coated male. A brown male must be $bb$, so the male received a $b$ from his father. Since the male is black, he must carry at least one $B$. Therefore the male is $Bb$.\n- The female is brown and her mother was a black-coated female. A black female must be $BB$, so the mother contributed a $B$. Since the daughter is brown, she must carry at least one $b$. Therefore the female is $Bb$.\n\nThus the coat-color cross is $Bb \\times Bb$, yielding offspring genotypes with probabilities:\n$$\nP(BB)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Bb)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(bb)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nAmong female offspring, the phenotype brown occurs for $Bb$ and $bb$, while $BB$ females are black. Therefore, the probability a female offspring is brown is\n$$\nP(\\text{brown} \\mid \\text{female})=P(Bb)+P(bb)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\n\nBecause horn shape and coat color assort independently and female horn phenotype is always normal, the proportion of female offspring with normal horns and a brown coat is\n$$\n\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "1519981"}, {"introduction": "The principles of Mendelian genetics can be scaled up to understand gene frequencies across entire populations. This final practice bridges the gap between individual crosses and population genetics by incorporating the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Using observational data from one sex, you will calculate allele frequencies for a sex-influenced trait and then use those frequencies to predict phenotypic proportions in the other sex, a powerful application of genetic principles in ecological and evolutionary studies [@problem_id:1519997].", "problem": "In a particular species of bird, the Golden-plumed Warbler, the coloration of the throat patch is determined by a single gene with two alleles, $C^G$ (for a gold patch) and $C^Y$ (for a yellow patch).

A large, isolated population of these warblers is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for this gene.\n\nA field study is conducted on this population, and it is observed that 36% of the males have a yellow throat patch. Based on this information, what proportion of the females in this population are expected to have a gold throat patch?\n\nCalculate this proportion and express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the allele frequency of $C^{G}$ and $q$ be the allele frequency of $C^{Y}$, with $p+q=1$.
