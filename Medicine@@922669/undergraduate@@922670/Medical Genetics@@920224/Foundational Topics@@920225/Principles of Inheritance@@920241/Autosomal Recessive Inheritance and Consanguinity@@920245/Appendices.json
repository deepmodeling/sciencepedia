This exercise demonstrates a crucial principle: how observing an affected child provides definitive evidence about the parental genotypes.

Assume complete penetrance, no phenocopies, negligible de novo mutation rate, and accurate diagnosis. A first-cousin couple are both clinically unaffected and have exactly one child who is affected by the AR disorder, thereby having genotype $aa$. Treat siblings’ genotypes as conditionally independent given parental genotypes. Using only fundamental principles of Mendelian segregation and the axioms of conditional probability (without invoking any memorized recurrence-risk shortcuts), derive the exact posterior probability that the couple’s next child will be affected by the disorder. Express your final probability as a fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability that a couple's next child will be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, given that the parents are unaffected but have already had one affected child. We will derive this probability from fundamental principles of genetics and probability theory.\n\nLet $A$ be the dominant allele and $a$ be the recessive allele responsible for the disorder. The possible genotypes are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Given complete penetrance, individuals with genotype $aa$ are affected, while individuals with genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$ are unaffected.\n\nLet $G_1$ and $G_2$ denote the genotypes of the two parents. Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ denote the genotypes of their first and second children, respectively.\n\nWe are given the following information, which we define as the evidence, $E$:\n$1$. The first parent is unaffected.\n$2$. The second parent is unaffected.\n$3$. The first child is affected, meaning $C_1 = aa$.\n\nWe are asked to calculate the probability that the second child is affected, conditioned on this evidence. This is the posterior probability $P(C_2 = aa | E)$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, we can express this by conditioning on all possible parental genotype pairs, $(G_1, G_2)$:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\sum_{(G_1, G_2)} P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2), E) \\cdot P((G_1, G_2) | E)$$\nThe sum is over all nine possible ordered pairs of parental genotypes: $(AA, AA)$, $(AA, Aa)$, $(AA, aa)$, $(Aa, AA)$, $(Aa, Aa)$, $(Aa, aa)$, $(aa, AA)$, $(aa, Aa)$, and $(aa, aa)$.\n\nThe problem states that siblings' genotypes are conditionally independent given parental genotypes. This is a standard assumption in genetics and means that knowing the genotype of one child provides no additional information about another child if the parents' genotypes are already known. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2), E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2))$$\nThe evidence $E$ about the first child is redundant for predicting the second child's genotype once $(G_1, G_2)$ is specified.\nOur expression simplifies to:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\sum_{(G_1, G_2)} P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2)) \\cdot P((G_1, G_2) | E)$$\n\nNow, we must determine the posterior probability distribution of the parental genotypes, $P((G_1, G_2) | E)$. This term represents the probability of the parents having a particular genotype pair, given the evidence $E$.\n\nLet us analyze the evidence $E$ to constrain the possible parental genotypes:\n-   From the fact that the first child is affected ($C_1 = aa$), we can deduce that the child must have inherited one $a$ allele from each parent. Therefore, both parents must be carriers of the $a$ allele.\n-   From the fact that both parents are clinically unaffected, we know that neither parent can have the genotype $aa$.\n\nCombining these two logical deductions, the genotype of each parent must include one $a$ allele (to be a carrier) but cannot be $aa$ (to be unaffected). The only genotype that satisfies these conditions is $Aa$.\nTherefore, the evidence $E$ leads to the logical certainty that both parents have the genotype $Aa$.\n$$G_1 = Aa \\quad \\text{and} \\quad G_2 = Aa$$\nThere is no other possibility for the parental genotypes. This means the posterior probability distribution $P((G_1, G_2) | E)$ is:\n$$P((G_1, G_2) = (Aa, Aa) | E) = 1$$\n$$P((G_1, G_2) | E) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all other pairs } (G_1, G_2) \\neq (Aa, Aa)$$\n\nSubstituting this into our summation, all terms where $(G_1, G_2)$ is not $(Aa, Aa)$ become zero. The sum collapses to a single term:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa)) \\cdot P((G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa) | E)$$\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa)) \\cdot 1$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the probability of an offspring being $aa$ from a mating between two heterozygous parents ($Aa \\times Aa$). This is a fundamental principle of Mendelian segregation. We can visualize this with a Punnett square:\n\n|       | $A$   | $a$   |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$A$** | $AA$  | $Aa$  |\n| **$a$** | $Aa$  | $aa$  |\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Assuming fair Mendelian segregation, these genotypes occur with the following probabilities:\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThus, the probability that the next child will be affected (genotype $aa$) is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nIt is important to note that information such as the couple being first cousins and the population being in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium would be necessary to calculate the *prior* probability that two unaffected individuals are both carriers. However, the problem provides definitive *posterior* evidence: the existence of an affected child. This evidence updates our knowledge of the parental genotypes to certainty, rendering the prior probabilities associated with consanguinity and population allele frequencies irrelevant for calculating the recurrence risk. The derivation confirms that the conditioning on observed evidence is the crucial step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "5013763"}, {"introduction": "While recurrence risk for future offspring is a key concern, assessing the carrier status of existing unaffected relatives is equally important. This practice moves into the realm of modern diagnostics, where test results are not always perfect.

According to Mendelian segregation for a cross between two $Aa$ parents, the prior probabilities for the genotype of any child are:\n-   $P(AA)$ (homozygous non-carrier) $= \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   $P(Aa)$ (heterozygous carrier) $= \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(aa)$ (homozygous affected) $= \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe problem states that the sibling is clinically unaffected. This information allows us to update the prior probabilities by conditioning on the event \"unaffected.\" An unaffected individual cannot have the $aa$ genotype. Let $U$ be the event that the sibling is unaffected. The sample space is reduced to the genotypes $\\{AA, Aa\\}$.\nThe probability of being unaffected is $P(U) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe updated prior probabilities for the unaffected sibling's genotype, before considering the genetic test, are:\n-   The prior probability of being a heterozygous carrier ($Aa$), given the sibling is unaffected:\n    $$P(Aa \\mid U) = \\frac{P(Aa \\cap U)}{P(U)} = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(U)} = \\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n-   The prior probability of being a homozygous non-carrier ($AA$), given the sibling is unaffected:\n    $$P(AA \\mid U) = \\frac{P(AA \\cap U)}{P(U)} = \\frac{P(AA)}{P(U)} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nLet $H$ denote the event that the sibling is a heterozygous carrier ($Aa$) and $\\neg H$ denote the event that the sibling is a homozygous non-carrier ($AA$).

The genotype of interest is the homozygous recessive $aa$, which corresponds to the affected phenotype.\n\nScenario 1: Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)\n\nUnder HWE, the population is assumed to be mating randomly. The frequency of a genotype is determined by the chance combination of alleles drawn from the population's gene pool. An individual with genotype $aa$ must inherit one $a$ allele from each parent.

The two alleles are identical by descent (IBD).\n    The probability of this event is, by definition, $F$. If the two alleles are IBD, they are guaranteed to be identical. For the individual to be of genotype $aa$, this common ancestral allele must have been an $a$ allele. The probability of drawing such an ancestral allele from the gene pool is its frequency, $q$.
