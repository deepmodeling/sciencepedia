No rounding is required.", "solution": "The process of translation involves reading an mRNA sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides, called codons, starting from a specific reading frame. An open reading frame (ORF) is a segment of the sequence that can be translated into a protein. A valid ORF must begin with a start codon and end with an in-frame stop codon. According to standard eukaryotic and prokaryotic translation initiation, the primary start codon is AUG, which also codes for the amino acid Methionine. The three standard stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA; these codons signal termination and do not code for an amino acid.\n\nThe given mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGGUGUGAUAA-3'. This sequence is 12 nucleotides long. We will analyze the three possible reading frames in the 5' → 3' direction.\n\n**Frame +1**\nThe reading frame starts with the first nucleotide. The sequence is partitioned into codons as follows:\n$$5'-\\text{AUG GUG UGA UAA}-3'$$\n- The first codon is AUG. This is the standard start codon, so translation initiates here. The first amino acid is incorporated.\n- The second codon is GUG. This codon codes for the amino acid Valine. The second amino acid is incorporated.\n- The third codon is UGA. This is a standard stop codon. Translation terminates at this point. The stop codon itself is not translated into an amino acid.\nThe resulting peptide consists of the amino acids encoded by the AUG and GUG codons. The length of this peptide is 2 amino acids.\nTherefore, the length for frame +1 is $L_{1} = 2$.\n\n**Frame +2**\nThe reading frame starts with the second nucleotide. The first nucleotide is ignored. The sequence is partitioned into codons as follows:\n$$5'-\\text{A UGG UGU GAU AA}-3'$$\nThe codons are UGG, UGU, and GAU. The remaining two nucleotides, AA, do not form a complete codon. We must scan this frame for a start codon (AUG) to initiate an ORF.\n- The first codon, UGG, is not a start codon.\n- The second codon, UGU, is not a start codon.\n- The third codon, GAU, is not a start codon.\nSince there is no start codon within this reading frame, no ORF is identified, and no translation occurs. According to the problem statement, a frame that contains no ORF contributes 0 to the length.\nTherefore, the length for frame +2 is $L_{2} = 0$.\n\n**Frame +3**\nThe reading frame starts with the third nucleotide. The first two nucleotides are ignored. The sequence is partitioned into codons as follows:\n$$5'-\\text{AU GGU GUG AUA A}-3'$$\nThe codons are GGU, GUG, and AUA. The remaining nucleotide, A, does not form a complete codon. We scan this frame for a start codon (AUG).\n- The first codon, GGU, is not a start codon.\n- The second codon, GUG, is not the standard start codon AUG. While GUG can occasionally serve as an alternative start codon in some biological contexts, the problem specifies \"standard translational initiation,\" which strictly implies the use of AUG.\n- The third codon, AUA, is not a start codon.\nAs in the previous case, no standard start codon is present in this reading frame. No ORF is initiated, and no translation occurs.\nTherefore, the length for frame +3 is $L_{3} = 0$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe problem requires the computation of the sum $S = L_{1} + L_{2} + L_{3}$. Using the lengths determined for each frame:\n$$L_{1} = 2$$\n$$L_{2} = 0$$\n$$L_{3} = 0$$\nThe sum $S$ is:\n$$S = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$$\nThe final result is an integer, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "5086316"}, {"introduction": "While the genetic code has 61 codons for amino acids, cells do not need 61 distinct types of tRNA to decode them, an efficiency achieved through the 'wobble' in codon-anticodon pairing.

The error frequency, $f$, is defined as the ratio of the initial rate of mischarging valine (Val) onto $\\mathrm{tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}$ to the initial rate of correctly charging isoleucine (Ile).\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the initial reaction velocity and the given kinetic parameters. The charging of an amino acid (AA) onto its cognate tRNA by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), denoted as $E$, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to the amino acid concentration, $[\\mathrm{AA}]$. The reaction can be simplified as:\n$$ E + \\mathrm{AA} + \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{tRNA} \\xrightarrow{K_M} \\dots \\xrightarrow{k_{cat}} E + \\mathrm{AA-tRNA} + \\mathrm{AMP} + \\mathrm{PP_i} $$\nGiven that ATP and tRNA are saturating, the initial velocity, $v$, of product formation (AA-tRNA) is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation as a function of the amino acid concentration $[\\mathrm{AA}]$:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{cat} [E]_T [\\mathrm{AA}]}{K_M + [\\mathrm{AA}]} $$\nwhere $[E]_T$ is the total enzyme concentration, $k_{cat}$ is the turnover number, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant for the amino acid.\n\nThe problem states that the cellular concentrations of both Ile and Val are in the \"low-substrate\" regime, where $[\\mathrm{AA}] \\ll K_M$. Under this condition, the denominator of the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies to $K_M + [\\mathrm{AA}] \\approx K_M$. The initial velocity equation thus becomes:\n$$ v \\approx \\frac{k_{cat} [E]_T [\\mathrm{AA}]}{K_M} = \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M} \\right) [E]_T [\\mathrm{AA}] $$\nThe term $k_{cat}/K_M$ is the specificity constant, which measures the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for a given substrate at low concentrations. The initial velocity, or flux ($J$), is therefore proportional to the specificity constant and the substrate concentration: $v \\propto (k_{cat}/K_M)[\\mathrm{AA}]$. The constant of proportionality is the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, which is the same for both the cognate (Ile) and near-cognate (Val) reactions as they compete for the same enzyme.\n\nLet's define the fluxes:\nThe flux for correct charging with isoleucine is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Ile}} = v_{\\mathrm{Ile}} = [E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Ile}] $$\nThe flux for mischarging with valine depends on whether the editing mechanism is active.\nWithout editing, the flux is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}} = v_{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}} = [E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Val}] $$\nWith editing, the flux is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Val,edit}} = v_{\\mathrm{Val,edit}} = [E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Val}] $$\n\nThe error frequency, $f$, is defined as the ratio of the mischarging flux to the correct charging flux.\nWithout editing, the error frequency $f_{\\mathrm{no\\ edit}}$ is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{no\\ edit}} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}}}{J_{\\mathrm{Ile}}} = \\frac{[E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Val}]}{[E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Ile}]} $$\nWith editing, the error frequency $f_{\\mathrm{edit}}$ is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{edit}} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{Val,edit}}}{J_{\\mathrm{Ile}}} = \\frac{[E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}} \\right) [\\mathrmVal]}{[E]_T \\left( \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}}{K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}} \\right) [\\mathrm{Ile}]} $$\nThe problem states that the cellular concentrations are equal, i.e., $[\\mathrm{Ile}] = [\\mathrm{Val}] = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

This prevents the erroneous Val-$\\mathrm{tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}$ from being released and participating in protein synthesis. This hydrolytic pathway effectively diverts the product of the mischarging reaction, thus drastically reducing the net rate of release of Val-$\\mathrm{tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}$. This reduction is reflected as a decrease in the apparent overall turnover number, $k_{cat}$, for valine. The initial binding and activation steps, which primarily determine $K_M$, are upstream of the editing step and thus are not affected, which explains why $K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}$ is the same with or without a functional editing domain.\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold reduction in error frequency, $R$, which is defined as:\n$$ R \\equiv \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{no\\ edit}}}{f_{\\mathrm{edit}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{no\\ edit}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{edit}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{ \\frac{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}} \\right) }{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} \\right) } }{ \\frac{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}} \\right) }{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} \\right) } } $$\nThe term for the cognate substrate, $\\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} \\right)$, cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ R = \\frac{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}} \\right) }{ \\left( k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}} / K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}} \\right) } $$\nSince $K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}}$ is the same for the enzyme with and without editing activity, it also cancels out:\n$$ R = \\frac{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}}}{k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}}} $$\nThis elegant result shows that the fold improvement in fidelity due to editing is simply the ratio of the apparent catalytic rates for the non-cognate substrate without and with the editing function.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,no\\ edit}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{cat}^{\\mathrm{Val,edit}} = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$ R = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.003\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.2}{0.003} = 400 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $400$. To express this unambiguously with three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation.\n\n$$ R = 4.00 \\times 10^2 $$\nThis represents a $400$-fold reduction in the error rate of charging valine onto $\\mathrm{tRNA}^{\\mathrm{Ile}}$, attributable to the enzyme's proofreading capability. Note that we did not need the kinetic parameters for Ile or the specific substrate concentrations, as they cancelled out in the ratio, demonstrating that $R$ is an intrinsic property of the enzyme's handling of the near-cognate substrate.\nThe validity of the low-substrate approximation should be confirmed.\nFor Ile: $[\\mathrm{Ile}]/K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Ile}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} / 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 0.1$, which is much less than $1$.\nFor Val: $[\\mathrm{Val}]/K_{M}^{\\mathrm{Val}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} / 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} / 10000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 0.002$, which is also much less than $1$.\nThe approximation is justified.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "5086298"}]}
