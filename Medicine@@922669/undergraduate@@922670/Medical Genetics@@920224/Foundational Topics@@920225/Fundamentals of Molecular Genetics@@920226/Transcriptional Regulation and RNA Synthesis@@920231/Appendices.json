By analyzing patterns of protection from enzymatic cleavage, you will deduce the architecture of the PIC and understand how mutations in key promoter elements can disrupt this critical assembly process [@problem_id:5088009].", "problem": "A researcher studying a human blood cell differentiation gene investigates how General Transcription Factors (GTFs) assemble on its core promoter to form the Preinitiation Complex (PIC) and initiate RNA synthesis. The promoter fragment analyzed spans from position $-50$ to position $+30$ relative to the transcription start site at $+1$. The following foundational facts are taken as the starting point:\n\n- By the Central Dogma, genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) with assistance from General Transcription Factors (GTFs) that assemble on the promoter to form a stable Preinitiation Complex (PIC).\n- In DNase I footprinting, the endonuclease DNase I preferentially cleaves naked DNA, while protein-bound DNA exhibits protection (reduced cleavage) at binding sites and may show flanking hypersensitive cleavage sites due to protein-induced DNA bending or altered accessibility.\n- The TATA-binding protein (TBP), a subunit of Transcription Factor IID (TFIID), recognizes and binds the TATA box; Transcription Factor IIB (TFIIB) recognizes a B recognition element (BRE) and bridges TBP to RNA Polymerase II, contacting promoter DNA.\n- The BRE can be located upstream of the TATA box (BRE upstream, often abbreviated BREu) and is recognized by TFIIB to stabilize PIC assembly and influence start-site selection.\n\nThe researcher performs DNase I footprinting on the promoter fragment under four conditions with the wild-type sequence, and then with a mutant in which a putative BRE upstream sequence is altered. Observations are summarized below. In all cases, positions refer to base pairs relative to the transcription start site at $+1$.\n\nWild-type promoter:\n- DNA alone: relatively uniform cleavage from $-50$ to $+30$.\n- DNA $+$ TBP: a strong protected region from $-34$ to $-25$; hypersensitive bands appear near $-41$ and $-18$.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB: upstream protection extends further to $-40$ to $-33$; a new hypersensitive band appears near $-22$; faint protection is observed extending into the downstream region near $-10$ to $+5$.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB $+$ Pol II $+$ TFIIF: a broader protected region spanning approximately $-40$ to $+10$ consistent with PIC assembly.\n\nMutant promoter (BREu mutated by substituting a $6$-base GC-rich tract between approximately $-38$ and $-33$ to adenine/thymine bases):\n- DNA $+$ TBP: protection from $-34$ to $-25$ and hypersensitive bands near $-41$ and $-18$, similar to wild-type.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB: no extension of protection upstream; the hypersensitive band near $-22$ is diminished; protection remains primarily at $-34$ to $-25$.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB $+$ Pol II $+$ TFIIF: overall protection is weaker, particularly downstream; under modest increases in ionic strength, protection at $-34$ to $-25$ erodes faster than wild-type, and cleavage increases across $-40$ to $+10$.\n\nBased on these footprinting patterns and first principles of promoter recognition and PIC assembly, which option best identifies the likely binding positions of TBP and TFIIB on the wild-type promoter and predicts the consequence of mutating the upstream BRE on PIC stability and transcription initiation?\n\nA. TBP binds the TATA box centered near $-30$ (protection approximately $-34$ to $-25$), while TFIIB engages an upstream BRE between approximately $-38$ and $-33$ (extension of upstream protection and a new hypersensitive site near $-22$). Mutating the BRE reduces TFIIB occupancy, destabilizes the PIC, lowers initiation frequency, and increases start-site heterogeneity.\n\nB. TBP primarily binds the BRE, whereas TFIIB binds the TATA box; mutating the BRE improves TBP binding and stabilizes the PIC, increasing initiation frequency and start-site precision.\n\nC. TBP binds at the transcription start site near $+1$, while TFIIB recognizes a downstream BRE between approximately $-18$ and $-12$; mutating the upstream element has negligible effects on PIC stability and initiation.\n\nD. TBP binds the TATA box, but TFIIB does not contact promoter DNA directly; mutating the BRE primarily affects elongation but leaves PIC assembly and initiation unaffected.\n\nE. TBP binds the TATA box, and TFIIB binds the upstream BRE; mutating the BRE abolishes TBP binding entirely, preventing any protection near $-34$ to $-25$ even in the absence of TFIIB.", "solution": "Begin from first principles relevant to transcriptional regulation and RNA synthesis:\n\n- The Central Dogma links DNA to RNA via transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). Efficient transcription initiation at eukaryotic promoters requires the ordered assembly of General Transcription Factors (GTFs) to form the Preinitiation Complex (PIC).\n- In DNase I footprinting, binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences reduces DNase I cleavage at those positions, generating protection footprints. Proteins that bend or distort DNA can create hypersensitive cleavage bands adjacent to their binding sites due to altered local accessibility. Thus, mapping protected and hypersensitive regions allows localization of protein-DNA contacts.\n- The TATA-binding protein (TBP), part of Transcription Factor IID (TFIID), recognizes the TATA box and imposes a sharp bend, typically centered near the TATA sequence, often around $-31$ relative to $+1$ in many human promoters. TBP binding yields protection spanning the TATA box and flanking hypersensitive bands consistent with DNA bending.\n- Transcription Factor IIB (TFIIB) recognizes the B recognition element (BRE), which in many promoters lies upstream of the TATA box (BRE upstream or BREu). TFIIB binds DNA and interacts with TBP, helping recruit Pol II and other factors (for example, Transcription Factor IIF, abbreviated TFIIF), stabilizing the PIC and influencing the precision of start-site selection.\n\nApply these principles to the observed footprinting patterns.\n\nWild-type promoter analysis:\n- DNA $+$ TBP: The protected region from $-34$ to $-25$ and hypersensitive bands near $-41$ and $-18$ are classic for TBP bound to a TATA box centered near $-30$. TBP binding protects the TATA sequence and induces flanking hypersensitivity due to DNA bending.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB: The extension of upstream protection to $-40$ to $-33$ and the appearance of a new hypersensitive band near $-22$ indicate additional protein-DNA contacts beyond TBP. Given TFIIB’s known recognition of an upstream BRE, the upstream extension implicates TFIIB engaging a BRE between approximately $-38$ and $-33$. The hypersensitive site near $-22$ is consistent with TFIIB’s additional contacts downstream and structural reorganization as it bridges TBP and positions Pol II.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB $+$ Pol II $+$ TFIIF: The broader protection from $-40$ to $+10$ is consistent with assembly of a PIC wherein multiple components occupy and shield the promoter region.\n\nMutant promoter analysis (BREu mutated):\n- DNA $+$ TBP: Protection remains at $-34$ to $-25$ with flanking hypersensitive bands, indicating that TBP still binds the TATA box; the mutation is upstream and does not abolish TBP’s TATA recognition.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB: Loss of upstream extension and diminished hypersensitive band near $-22$ indicate TFIIB’s reduced or absent binding to the mutated upstream BRE. Without TFIIB’s stable engagement, bridging interactions and downstream contacts are weakened.\n- DNA $+$ TBP $+$ TFIIB $+$ Pol II $+$ TFIIF: Weaker overall protection and increased sensitivity to ionic strength imply decreased PIC stability. TFIIB contributes to PIC stability and start-site selection; when BRE recognition is compromised, initiation frequency typically decreases and start-site choice can become more heterogeneous.\n\nSynthesize the interpretation into the choice that properly identifies TBP and TFIIB positions and predicts the effects of the BRE mutation:\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: TBP binding near the TATA centered at approximately $-30$ explains protection from $-34$ to $-25$ and hypersensitive bands near $-41$ and $-18$. TFIIB engaging an upstream BRE between approximately $-38$ and $-33$ explains the upstream protection extension and new hypersensitive site near $-22$. The predicted consequences—reduced TFIIB occupancy, destabilized PIC, lowered initiation frequency, and increased start-site heterogeneity—fit the mutant footprint and known roles of TFIIB in stabilizing the PIC and enforcing start-site selection. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: It reverses the roles, claiming TBP binds the BRE and TFIIB binds the TATA box. This contradicts fundamental definitions (TBP recognizes the TATA box; TFIIB recognizes the BRE). Furthermore, the mutant exhibits decreased, not increased, PIC stability. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: It positions TBP at the start site ($+1$) and TFIIB at a downstream BRE ($-18$ to $-12$), while stating the upstream mutation has negligible effects. The observed upstream extension with TFIIB in the wild-type and its loss in the mutant indicate that the relevant BRE is upstream; TBP does not bind at $+1$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: It asserts that TFIIB does not contact promoter DNA and that BRE mutation affects elongation but not initiation. TFIIB is known to contact the BRE and promoter DNA, and the footprint changes on mutation demonstrate effects on PIC assembly, a pre-initiation event, not selective elongation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option E: It correctly states TBP binds the TATA box and TFIIB binds the upstream BRE but incorrectly concludes that BRE mutation abolishes TBP binding. The mutant data show retained TBP protection from $-34$ to $-25$, indicating TBP still binds. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the option that best matches the DNase I footprinting patterns and predicts the consequence of BRE mutation on PIC stability is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5088009"}, {"introduction": "After initiating transcription, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) often pauses just downstream of the promoter, creating a major regulatory checkpoint that controls gene output.

This problem challenges you to apply the loop extrusion model, our leading theory for how these Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are formed by Cohesin and the insulator protein CTCF. By predicting how the inversion of a single CTCF binding site rewires the 3D landscape, you will explore how chromatin architecture dictates which enhancers can access which genes, with profound consequences for expression [@problem_id:5087969].", "problem": "A linear locus is organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and Cohesin such that enhancer-promoter communication occurs primarily within a Topologically Associating Domain (TAD). Use the following foundational principles as your starting point: (i) the Central Dogma asserts that transcriptional output depends on regulatory DNA elements that modulate access and activity of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at promoters; (ii) enhancers increase transcription of compatible promoters when brought into physical proximity via chromatin looping; (iii) loop extrusion by Cohesin enlarges a chromatin loop until extrusion is halted at CTCF sites in a convergent motif orientation, establishing loop anchors that demarcate domains which constrain enhancer reach.\n\nConsider a locus with elements ordered from left to right on the same chromosome with the following coordinates and features (coordinates are distances from the leftmost feature): CTCF-L at $0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ with motif orientation >, Enhancer $\\mathrm{E1}$ at $20\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ (moderate-strength), promoter of gene A at $40\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, CTCF-R at $60\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ with motif orientation <, Enhancer $\\mathrm{E2}$ at $80\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ (stronger than $\\mathrm{E1}$), promoter of gene B at $100\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, and an additional CTCF-R2 at $140\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ with motif orientation <.

Now, it is also accessible to the stronger enhancer E2. This \"enhancer hijacking\" is expected to significantly increase the transcriptional activation of gene A. Thus, gene A mRNA levels should **increase**.\n- **Gene B:** The promoter of gene B was previously regulated by the strong enhancer E2. Now, E2 is in the same TAD as the promoter of gene A. This leads to \"enhancer competition,\" where E2's activity is now split between the two promoters.
