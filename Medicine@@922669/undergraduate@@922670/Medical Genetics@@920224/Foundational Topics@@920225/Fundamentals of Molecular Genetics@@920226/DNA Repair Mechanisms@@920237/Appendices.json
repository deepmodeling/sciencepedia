This first practice problem walks you through the logic of a classic genetic screen using replica plating, a powerful technique for identifying mutants with specific traits. By simulating the process of screening for bacteria that are hypersensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, you will connect a physical stressor to its underlying molecular consequence, a cornerstone of genetic analysis [@problem_id:2062561].", "problem": "A microbiologist is attempting to isolate bacterial mutants that are deficient in their DNA repair mechanisms. The experiment begins with a liquid culture of wild-type bacteria, which is treated with a chemical mutagen to induce random mutations throughout the population. A diluted sample of this mutagenized culture is then spread onto a plate containing a complete nutrient agar, which is incubated until individual colonies are visible. This plate is designated the \"master plate.\"\n\nThe researcher then uses the replica-plating technique to screen for mutants. A sterile velvet-covered block is pressed onto the master plate, picking up cells from each colony. The block is then used to transfer the cells onto two new plates:\n1.  **Plate R1**: A plate containing complete nutrient agar.\n2.  **Plate R2**: A plate containing complete nutrient agar, which is subsequently exposed to a dose of Ultraviolet (UV) light. This dose is known to be sublethal for the wild-type strain but is expected to be lethal for mutants with compromised DNA repair systems.\n\nBoth replica plates are incubated to allow for growth. The goal is to identify colonies of UV-hypersensitive mutants. Which of the following patterns of colony growth correctly identifies a colony from the master plate as a potential UV-hypersensitive mutant?\n\nA. The colony grows on the master plate and Plate R1, but does not grow on Plate R2.\n\nB. The colony grows on the master plate and Plate R2, but does not grow on Plate R1.\n\nC. The colony grows on the master plate, but fails to grow on both Plate R1 and Plate R2.\n\nD. The colony grows on all three plates: the master plate, Plate R1, and Plate R2.\n\nE. The colony fails to grow on the master plate but grows on Plate R1 and Plate R2.", "solution": "The experimental design uses replica plating to test the UV sensitivity of colonies originally grown on complete medium (master plate). Key principles:\n1) Cells from each master-plate colony are transferred identically to both replica plates, so growth patterns across plates correspond to the same original colony.\n2) Both Plate R1 and Plate R2 contain complete medium; thus, in the absence of UV, any viable colony that grew on the master plate should also grow on Plate R1.\n3) Plate R2 is exposed to a UV dose that is sublethal for wild-type cells but lethal for DNA repair-deficient (UV-hypersensitive) mutants. Therefore:\n   - Wild type: grows on master, grows on R1, grows on R2.\n   - UV-hypersensitive mutant: grows on master, grows on R1, fails to grow on R2.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Grows on master and R1, not on R2. This matches the expected phenotype of a UV-hypersensitive mutant: viability in normal conditions but death after UV exposure.\n- B: Grows on master and R2, not on R1. Since R1 is identical medium to master without UV, failure on R1 while growing on both master and R2 is inconsistent and not indicative of UV hypersensitivity.\n- C: Grows on master, fails on both R1 and R2. This suggests a transfer failure or general inviability post-transfer, not specifically UV sensitivity.\n- D: Grows on all three plates. This indicates UV resistance comparable to wild type; not a UV-hypersensitive mutant.\n- E: Fails on master but grows on R1 and R2. This is internally inconsistent because the replica derives from the master-plate colonies.\n\nTherefore, the correct pattern identifying a UV-hypersensitive mutant is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2062561"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to identify a repair-deficient mutant, we now turn to predicting the specific consequences of a well-defined genetic defect. This exercise focuses on the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, the cell's primary defense against damage to individual DNA bases, such as that caused by spontaneous depurination. By considering a yeast cell missing the crucial enzyme AP endonuclease, you will apply your knowledge of the BER pathway to deduce how the accumulation of a specific type of DNA lesion affects cell survival [@problem_id:1483559].", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The BER pathway is crucial for correcting single-base DNA damage. A key enzyme in this pathway is AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endonuclease, which recognizes a site in the DNA backbone where a base is missing (an AP site) and initiates the repair process by cleaving the DNA strand at that location.\n\nThe geneticist creates a mutant yeast strain with a complete deletion of the gene encoding AP endonuclease. This mutant strain and a wild-type (non-mutant) strain are cultured separately. Both cultures are then exposed to a chemical mutagen that significantly increases the rate of spontaneous depurination, a process where a purine base (adenine or guanine) is cleaved from the deoxyribose sugar, leaving behind an AP site in the DNA.\n\nAfter a period of exposure to this mutagen, the two cultures are plated on nutrient agar to assess cell viability. Which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected phenotype of the AP endonuclease-deficient mutant strain when compared to the wild-type strain?\n\nA. The mutant strain will be highly resistant to the mutagen because the inability to cleave the DNA at AP sites prevents the formation of potentially lethal single-strand breaks.\n\nB. The mutant strain will exhibit a survival rate similar to the wild-type, but will display a much higher frequency of C-to-A transversion mutations.\n\nC. The mutant strain will be hypersensitive to the mutagen, showing a significantly lower survival rate than the wild-type strain.\n\nD. The mutant strain will be unaffected by the mutagen, as the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway will fully compensate for the loss of AP endonuclease function.\n\nE. The mutant strain will grow faster than the wild-type, as it does not expend energy on repairing the AP sites.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the phenotype of a yeast strain lacking AP endonuclease when exposed to an agent that creates apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. To solve this, we must understand the role of AP endonuclease within the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway and the consequences of its absence.\n\n1.  **Identify the Damage and the Primary Repair Pathway:** The chemical agent causes depurination, creating AP sites. This type of damage, involving a missing base without major distortion of the DNA helix, is primarily repaired by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway.\n\n2.  **Outline the Steps of the BER Pathway:**\n    *   **Step A: Damage Recognition and Base Removal:** In many cases, BER starts with a DNA glycosylase recognizing and removing a damaged or incorrect base (e.g., uracil). This action creates an AP site. In this problem's scenario, the mutagen directly creates the AP site, so the pathway effectively begins at the next step.\n    *   **Step B: AP Site Processing:** An AP endonuclease recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone at the baseless site. Its critical function is to incise the phosphodiester backbone, typically on the 5' side of the AP site. This creates a nick in the DNA, which is an essential prerequisite for the subsequent repair steps.\n    *   **Step C: Synthesis and Ligation:** A DNA polymerase uses the intact opposite strand as a template to insert the correct nucleotide at the nick. The same polymerase or another enzyme then removes the baseless sugar-phosphate remnant. Finally, DNA ligase seals the nick in the backbone, restoring the integrity of the DNA strand.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Consequence of the Mutation:** The mutant strain has a complete deletion of the gene for AP endonuclease. This means that Step B of the BER pathway is completely blocked. When the mutagen creates AP sites in the DNA of this mutant, the cell is unable to incise the backbone at these locations.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cellular Fate:** The AP sites themselves are highly toxic lesions. They do not contain any genetic information and thus block the progression of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. When a replication fork encounters an unrepaired AP site, it can stall and collapse. This collapse often leads to the formation of more complex and lethal DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks. The accumulation of these unrepaired AP sites and the subsequent replication-dependent damage leads to widespread genomic instability and ultimately triggers apoptosis or cell death.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A. The mutant strain will be highly resistant...:** This is incorrect. The AP site itself is the primary problem. Preventing its repair by removing AP endonuclease does not confer resistance; it makes the cell unable to resolve the toxic lesion, leading to increased sensitivity.\n    *   **B. The mutant strain will exhibit a similar survival rate but higher mutation frequency...:** This is incorrect. The primary consequence of numerous AP sites is not a specific type of point mutation, but rather replication fork collapse and cell death. Therefore, the survival rate will be drastically lower, not similar. Certain error-prone polymerases can insert a base (often an 'A') opposite an AP site (the 'A-rule'), but the sheer number of sites created by the mutagen would overwhelm this system and lead to lethality.\n    *   **C. The mutant strain will be hypersensitive...:** This is correct. The inability to repair the flood of AP sites leads to the accumulation of toxic lesions, replication fork collapse, and catastrophic DNA damage, resulting in a very low survival rate compared to the wild-type, which can efficiently repair these sites.\n    *   **D. The mutant strain will be unaffected...:** This is incorrect. The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway primarily recognizes and repairs bulky lesions that distort the DNA helix (e.g., thymine dimers caused by UV light). While there can be minor overlaps, NER is not the primary pathway for AP sites and cannot efficiently compensate for a complete loss of the essential BER enzyme, AP endonuclease.\n    *   **E. The mutant strain will grow faster...:** This is incorrect. DNA repair is a fundamental process for survival. The energy cost is negligible compared to the lethal consequences of unrepaired DNA damage. The mutant strain will experience severe stress and cell cycle arrest, not faster growth.\n\nTherefore, the loss of AP endonuclease function renders the cell unable to complete the BER pathway, leading to the accumulation of toxic AP sites and profound sensitivity to agents that cause this type of damage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1483559"}, {"introduction": "DNA fidelity is not the result of a single perfect process, but rather a multi-layered system of quality control, from polymerase proofreading to post-replicative mismatch repair.

In this `mutL-` strain, the efficiency of the MMR system is reduced to $E'_{MMR} = 0.600$ (i.e., 60.0%), while the DNA polymerase's intrinsic error rate and proofreading efficiency remain unchanged.\n\nA single `mutL-` bacterium is used to inoculate a fresh culture medium.
