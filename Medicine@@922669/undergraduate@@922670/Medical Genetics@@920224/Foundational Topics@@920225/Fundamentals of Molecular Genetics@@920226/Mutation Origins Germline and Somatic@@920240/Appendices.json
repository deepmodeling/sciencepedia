All definitions (diploidy, heterozygosity, VAF) and concepts are standard in medical genetics. The scenario is biologically plausible.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to calculate a single, unique VAF. The assumptions, while idealized (e.g., equal contribution of blastomeres), are explicitly stated and create a solvable model.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) for a mosaic mutation. The VAF is defined as the ratio of variant allele copies to the total number of allele copies in the assayed tissue sample.\n\nLet's denote the fraction of cells in the adult tissue that are derived from the single mutated blastomere as $f_{mosaic}$. According to the problem statement, the mutation occurred in $1$ of the $4$ blastomeres at the $4$-cell stage, and all $4$ blastomeres are assumed to contribute equally to the adult tissue. Therefore, the fraction of cells in the tissue that carry the mutation is:\n$$f_{mosaic} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe remaining fraction of cells, which are wild-type (unmutated), is:\n$$1 - f_{mosaic} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nThe locus is autosomal and diploid, which means every cell contains $2$ copies of the gene locus.\nThe cells derived from the mutated blastomere are heterozygous for the variant. This means each of these cells contains $1$ variant allele and $1$ reference allele.\nThe cells derived from the other $3$ non-mutated blastomeres are homozygous for the reference allele. This means each of these cells contains $0$ variant alleles and $2$ reference alleles.\n\nTo calculate the VAF, we need to find the total number of variant alleles and the total number of all alleles in a representative sample of the tissue. Let the total number of cells in the sample be $N$.\n\nThe number of mutated cells in the sample, $N_{mut}$, is:\n$$N_{mut} = f_{mosaic} \\times N = \\frac{1}{4}N$$\nThe number of wild-type cells in the sample, $N_{wt}$, is:\n$$N_{wt} = (1 - f_{mosaic}) \\times N = \\frac{3}{4}N$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of variant allele copies, $C_{variant}$, in the sample. This is the sum of variant alleles from both the mutated and wild-type cell populations.\n$$C_{variant} = (N_{mut} \\times \\text{variant alleles per mutated cell}) + (N_{wt} \\times \\text{variant alleles per wild-type cell})$$\n$$C_{variant} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}N \\times 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}N \\times 0\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}N$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of all allele copies, $C_{total}$, in the sample. Since each of the $N$ cells is diploid, each contributes $2$ alleles to the total count.\n$$C_{total} = N \\times (\\text{alleles per cell}) = N \\times 2 = 2N$$\n\nFinally, we compute the VAF using its definition:\n$$\\text{VAF} = \\frac{C_{variant}}{C_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}N}{2N}$$\nThe variable $N$ representing the total number of cells cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\text{VAF} = \\frac{1/4}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\nThe expected VAF is the VAF of the heterozygous state ($1/2$) multiplied by the fraction of cells that carry the mutation ($1/4$), which gives $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$. This confirms the result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n$$", "id": "5063730"}, {"introduction": "In oncology, distinguishing between somatic mutations acquired by a tumor and inherited germline mutations is critical for diagnosis and treatment. This task is complicated because tumor biopsies are often mixtures of cancerous and normal cells, which affects the interpretation of genetic data. This practice challenges you to move beyond simple allele fractions and integrate read-depth data to differentiate a somatic deletion within a tumor from a constitutional (germline) deletion that would be present in all cells [@problem_id:5063777].", "problem": "A biopsy specimen from a diploid human tissue is sequenced with high coverage. The specimen is a mixture of normal cells and neoplastic cells. The fraction of neoplastic cells in the specimen is the sample purity, denoted by $p$. Within the neoplastic cell population, a fraction $c$ forms a clone that carries a heterozygous somatic deletion at a locus that is otherwise biallelic and heterozygous in the germline. Assume the deletion removes the $B$ allele in the clone, leaving only the $A$ allele in those cells. All other cells (normal cells and neoplastic cells outside the clone) retain two copies, one $A$ and one $B$, at the locus.\n\nUse the following foundational principles and definitions:\n- In medical genetics, a germline mutation is present in all cells of an individual, whereas a somatic mutation arises in a subset of cells and is absent from the germline.\n- At a biallelic site, the variant allele fraction (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads supporting a chosen allele (e.g., the $B$ allele) relative to the total reads at that site, and under ideal conditions is proportional to the aggregate copy number of that allele across all cells sampled.\n- Read-depth at a locus scales (on average) with total copy number in the sampled cells; a normalized read-depth ratio can be defined by dividing the expected total copy number in the sample by the diploid baseline of $2$.\n\nLet the sample purity be $p = 0.55$ and the clone fraction be $c = 0.65$.

Round your answer to four significant figures and express it as a decimal without units.\n\nIn your derivation, also state the general expression for the expected normalized read-depth ratio at the locus (relative to a matched diploid normal) under the somatic deletion scenario, and explain how the expected VAF and read-depth values for this somatic deletion differ conceptually from those for a germline heterozygous deletion at the same locus.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical genetics and cancer genomics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and presented in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expected minor-allele fraction (MAF) and the normalized read-depth ratio for a somatic deletion in a mixed-cell population. We begin by dissecting the composition of the sample.\n\nLet the total number of cells in the biopsy specimen be $N$. The sample is composed of three distinct populations based on genotype at the locus of interest:\n1.  **Normal cells**: These cells are diploid and heterozygous, with genotype $AB$. Their fraction in the sample is $(1-p)$. The number of such cells is $N(1-p)$.\n2.  **Neoplastic, non-clonal cells**: These are the tumor cells that do not carry the specific somatic deletion. They are also diploid and heterozygous, with genotype $AB$. Their fraction in the sample is $p(1-c)$. The number of such cells is $N p(1-c)$.\n3.  **Neoplastic, clonal cells**: These are the tumor cells that carry the heterozygous somatic deletion of allele $B$. They are hemizygous at this locus, with genotype $A0$ (one $A$ allele, zero $B$ alleles). Their fraction in the sample is $pc$. The number of such cells is $N p c$.\n\nThe variant allele fraction (VAF) is proportional to the total count of an allele across all cells divided by the total count of all alleles at that locus. Let us calculate the expected aggregate copy number for each allele, $N_A$ and $N_B$.\n\nThe total number of $A$ alleles, $N_A$, is the sum of contributions from each population:\n-   From normal cells: $N(1-p)$ cells $\\times$ $1$ copy of $A$ = $N(1-p)$ copies.\n-   From non-clonal neoplastic cells: $N p (1-c)$ cells $\\times$ $1$ copy of $A$ = $N p (1-c)$ copies.\n-   From clonal neoplastic cells: $N p c$ cells $\\times$ $1$ copy of $A$ = $N p c$ copies.\nSumming these gives:\n$$N_A = N(1-p) + N p (1-c) + N p c = N(1-p+p-pc+pc) = N$$\n\nThe total number of $B$ alleles, $N_B$, is similarly calculated:\n-   From normal cells: $N(1-p)$ cells $\\times$ $1$ copy of $B$ = $N(1-p)$ copies.\n-   From non-clonal neoplastic cells: $N p(1-c)$ cells $\\times$ $1$ copy of $B$ = $N p(1-c)$ copies.\n-   From clonal neoplastic cells: $N p c$ cells $\\times$ $0$ copies of $B$ = $0$ copies.\nSumming these gives:\n$$N_B = N(1-p) + N p (1-c) + 0 = N(1-p+p-pc) = N(1-pc)$$\n\nThe total number of alleles at the locus in the entire sample, $N_{total}$, is the sum of $N_A$ and $N_B$:\n$$N_{total} = N_A + N_B = N + N(1-pc) = N(2-pc)$$\n\nThe expected VAF for each allele is the ratio of its total count to the total allele count:\n$$VAF_A = \\frac{N_A}{N_{total}} = \\frac{N}{N(2-pc)} = \\frac{1}{2-pc}$$\n$$VAF_B = \\frac{N_B}{N_{total}} = \\frac{N(1-pc)}{N(2-pc)} = \\frac{1-pc}{2-pc}$$\n\nTo find the minor-allele fraction (MAF), we must identify the allele with the lower VAF. We compare the numerators of $VAF_A$ and $VAF_B$, which are $1$ and $1-pc$. Since the sample purity $p$ and clone fraction $c$ are fractions ($0 < p < 1$, $0 < c < 1$), their product $pc$ is a positive number less than $1$. Therefore, $1-pc < 1$. This implies $VAF_B < VAF_A$. The $B$ allele is the minor allele.\nThe MAF is thus equal to $VAF_B$:\n$$MAF = \\frac{1-pc}{2-pc}$$\n\nWe are given $p = 0.55$ and $c = 0.65$. We compute the product $pc$:\n$$pc = 0.55 \\times 0.65 = 0.3575$$\nSubstituting this value into the MAF expression:\n$$MAF = \\frac{1 - 0.3575}{2 - 0.3575} = \\frac{0.6425}{1.6425} \\approx 0.39117199...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the numerical value for the MAF is $0.3912$.\n\nNext, we derive the general expression for the normalized read-depth ratio. This is defined as the expected total copy number in the sample divided by the diploid baseline of $2$. The \"expected total copy number\" refers to the average copy number per cell.\nAverage copy number per cell $= \\frac{N_{total}}{N} = \\frac{N(2-pc)}{N} = 2-pc$.\nThe normalized read-depth ratio is then:\n$$\\text{Normalized Read-Depth Ratio} = \\frac{2-pc}{2} = 1 - \\frac{pc}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we compare the somatic deletion scenario with a germline heterozygous deletion at the same locus.\n1.  **Somatic Deletion (this problem):**\n    -   **Origin and State:** The deletion is a somatic event occurring in a subpopulation of cells. The sample is a mosaic of diploid cells (genotype $AB$) and cells with a copy number loss (genotype $A0$).\n    -   **MAF:** The MAF is given by $\\frac{1-pc}{2-pc}$. This value is dependent on sample purity $p$ and clonal fraction $c$, and is typically between $0$ and $0.5$ (but not equal to $0$ or $0.5$, unless in trivial cases). It reflects the residual heterozygosity at the sample level. For the given parameters, $MAF \\approx 0.3912$.\n    -   **Read-Depth:** The normalized read-depth ratio is $1 - \\frac{pc}{2}$, which is less than $1$ but greater than $0.5$ (for $pc < 1$). The depth reduction is partial, reflecting the average copy number across the mixed cell population. For the given parameters, the ratio is $1 - \\frac{0.3575}{2} = 0.82125$.\n\n2.  **Germline Heterozygous Deletion:**\n    -   **Origin and State:** The deletion is a constitutional (germline) event present in the zygote. Therefore, *every* cell in the individual's body, normal and neoplastic alike, carries the deletion. All cells have the genotype $A0$. The individual is uniformly hemizygous.\n    -   **MAF:** Since the $B$ allele is absent from all cells, sequencing reads will only support the $A$ allele. Thus, $VAF_A = 1$ and $VAF_B = 0$. The MAF is $0$. There is no heterozygosity.\n    -   **Read-Depth:** Every cell has one copy of the locus instead of the normal two. The average copy number per cell is exactly $1$. The normalized read-depth ratio is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\nIn summary, a somatic deletion leads to a mosaic cellular population, resulting in a non-zero MAF (less than $0.5$) and a partial reduction in read depth. A germline deletion results in a uniform hemizygous state across all cells, leading to a MAF of $0$ (complete loss of heterozygosity) and a read-depth ratio of precisely $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3912}$$", "id": "5063777"}, {"introduction": "The increasing sensitivity of genetic sequencing presents new clinical challenges, particularly when interpreting low-frequency variants.

All provided information is scientifically grounded and internally consistent.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The concepts presented—LFS, $TP53$ mutations, germline vs. somatic variation, CHIP, NGS, and VAF—are fundamental to modern oncology and medical genetics. The association of LFS with germline $TP53$ alterations and CHIP with age-related somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells (including in the $TP53$ gene) are well-established scientific facts. The provided VAF of $3\\%$ is a plausible value for a CHIP clone. The lack of a supporting personal or family history for LFS is also a key detail that aligns with the overall picture. The problem is free of pseudoscience or factual errors.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides specific data (patient age, VAF, gene, clinical history) and definitions, asking for the most logical interpretation and subsequent clinical action. The information is sufficient to allow a reasoned deduction.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical language. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe core of this problem lies in interpreting the significance of a pathogenic $TP53$ variant detected at a variant allele fraction (VAF) of $3\\%$.\n\n1.  **Analysis of a Germline Variant:** A canonical germline heterozygous mutation is present from the zygote stage and is expected to be in every diploid somatic cell of the organism. In a diploid genome, there are two alleles for a given gene. A heterozygous variant exists on one of these two alleles. Therefore, in a large, representative sample of diploid cells (such as leukocytes from a blood draw), the expected VAF for a germline heterozygous variant is approximately $50\\%$ (or $0.5$). The observed VAF of $3\\%$ (or $0.03$) is substantially and significantly lower than this expected value. The problem explicitly rules out copy number changes that could potentially alter this ratio. Thus, a classic germline mutation causing LFS is extremely unlikely. The patient's phenotype (advanced age of $70$ with no personal or family history of LFS-spectrum cancers) further argues against a diagnosis of classic LFS.\n\n2.  **Analysis of a Somatic Variant:** A somatic mutation arises post-zygotically and is therefore present in only a subset of the body's cells. The VAF reflects the proportion of cells in the tested sample that carry the mutation. A VAF of $3\\%$ in a blood sample indicates that approximately $6\\%$ of the nucleated cells (leukocytes) in that sample are heterozygous for the $TP53$ mutation (since VAF $\\approx$ [fraction of mutant cells] / $2$). This points to a clonal expansion of a single cell that acquired this mutation.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Somatic Scenarios: CHIP vs. Constitutional Mosaicism:**\n    *   **Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP):** This phenomenon, as defined in the problem, involves a somatic mutation occurring in a hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell, which then gives rise to a clonal population of blood cells. CHIP is strongly associated with increasing age, and pathogenic mutations in $TP53$ are known causes. The patient's age ($70$) and the low VAF ($3\\%$) of a $TP53$ mutation in a blood sample are the classic hallmarks of $TP53$-mutant CHIP.\n    *   **Constitutional (or Somatic) Mosaicism:** This occurs if the somatic mutation happened very early in embryonic development, leading to its presence in multiple tissues derived from different germ layers, not just the hematopoietic lineage. While this would also result in a VAF lower than $50\\%$, CHIP is a far more common explanation for a low-VAF $TP53$ mutation in the blood of a $70$-year-old with an unremarkable history.\n\n4.  **Formulating the Next Step:** The most likely diagnosis is CHIP. However, the less likely possibility of constitutional mosaicism cannot be entirely dismissed on the basis of a blood test alone. The clinical implications differ profoundly: CHIP carries risks for hematologic malignancy and cardiovascular disease, whereas constitutional mosaicism for a pathogenic $TP53$ variant would imply a mosaic form of LFS with risks for solid tumors and potential for transmission to offspring. Therefore, the critical next step is to determine if the mutation is confined to the blood lineage. This is accomplished by testing a tissue of non-hematopoietic origin. The gold standard for this is a skin biopsy followed by culturing of dermal fibroblasts. If the $TP53$ variant is absent in the fibroblasts, it confirms an etiology of CHIP. A diagnosis of LFS (even mosaic LFS) should not be made, and its intensive surveillance protocol should not be initiated, unless the variant is proven to be constitutional (present outside the blood).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Classify the finding as a germline heterozygous $TP53$ mutation consistent with LFS and initiate full LFS surveillance immediately; further tissue testing is unnecessary.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The VAF of $3\\%$ is fundamentally inconsistent with the expected $\\approx 50\\%$ for a germline heterozygous mutation. The patient's age and lack of cancer history also contradict a typical LFS diagnosis. Initiating LFS surveillance based on this finding would be clinically inappropriate.\n\n**B. The finding is most consistent with $TP53$-mutant CHIP confined to hematopoietic cells in an older adult; recommend confirmatory testing of non-hematopoietic tissue (for example, cultured skin fibroblasts) to exclude germline mosaicism, and do not diagnose LFS unless the variant is confirmed outside blood.**\nThis is **Correct**. It accurately identifies CHIP as the most probable cause given the patient's age and the low VAF. It correctly proposes the definitive follow-up test (non-hematopoietic tissue analysis) to distinguish CHIP from the less likely constitutional mosaicism. It also correctly outlines the diagnostic logic: the LFS diagnosis is contingent on proving the mutation is not restricted to the blood.\n\n**C. The signal is most likely an NGS sequencing artifact typical of older age; dismiss the finding and pursue no additional work-up.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The problem states the lab used high-depth ($>1000\\times$) sequencing and confirmed the signal across independent replicates. These quality control measures make a sequencing artifact highly unlikely. Dismissing a confirmed pathogenic variant in $TP53$ without further investigation is medically negligent.\n\n**D. The low VAF reflects constitutional somatic mosaicism across all tissues originating in early embryogenesis; treat this as LFS and begin surveillance regardless of findings in other tissues.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. While constitutional mosaicism is a theoretical possibility, CHIP is a much more frequent explanation in this specific context. Furthermore, this option wrongly jumps to a conclusion and recommends initiating burdensome surveillance \"regardless of findings in other tissues,\" which defeats the purpose of diagnostic precision and is contrary to good clinical practice.\n\n**E. Obtain saliva DNA only, which will definitively distinguish CHIP from germline origin because saliva is free of hematopoietic cells; if present in saliva, diagnose LFS.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The premise that saliva is free of hematopoietic cells is factually wrong. Saliva samples contain a variable but often significant number of white blood cells exfoliated into the oral cavity. Therefore, a mutation present in blood due to CHIP will likely be detectable in DNA extracted from saliva, making it an unreliable sample for distinguishing CHIP from constitutional mosaicism. One cannot definitively diagnose LFS based on a positive saliva test in this context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5052316"}]}
