The process relies on differential centrifugation, a technique that separates components of a mixture by spinning them in a centrifuge at various speeds. The sedimentation of a particle depends on its size and density; larger and denser particles form a solid pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube at lower centrifugal forces than smaller, less dense particles. For a typical mammalian liver cell, nuclei are significantly larger and denser than mitochondria. The initial sample is the total cell homogenate.\n\nThe goal is to obtain two separate fractions: one enriched with nuclei and another enriched with mitochondria. Which of the following procedures correctly describes the sequence of steps to achieve this separation?\n\nA. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the supernatant and discard the pellet. Then, centrifuge this supernatant at a low speed (e.g., 600 x g) and collect the resulting pellet as the mitochondrial fraction and the final supernatant as the nuclear fraction.\n\nB. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction.\n\nC. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains a mix of both organelles. Resuspend this pellet and centrifuge again at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the resulting supernatant as the mitochondrial fraction and the pellet as the nuclear fraction.\n\nD. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction.", "solution": "Differential centrifugation separates cellular components by their sedimentation velocities under a centrifugal field. In the Stokes regime, the terminal sedimentation velocity of a roughly spherical particle of radius $a$ and density $\\rho_{p}$ in a medium of density $\\rho_{m}$ and viscosity $\\eta$, at angular speed $\\omega$ and radial position $r$, scales as\n$$\nv=\\frac{2 a^{2}(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m}) \\omega^{2} r}{9 \\eta}.\n$$\nThus, larger and denser particles have greater $v$ at a given $\\omega$, so they pellet at lower centrifugal forces and/or shorter times than smaller, less dense particles. For mammalian cell homogenates, nuclei are larger and denser than mitochondria, so at a low centrifugal force, nuclei pellet while mitochondria remain in the supernatant; at a higher centrifugal force applied to that supernatant, mitochondria pellet.\n\nApplying this principle to the options:\n- Option A starts with a high-speed spin, which would pellet both nuclei and many mitochondria together; discarding this pellet would lose the desired organelles, and a subsequent low-speed spin cannot pellet mitochondria. Therefore A is incorrect.\n- Option B performs a low-speed spin first to pellet nuclei (nuclear fraction), then applies a higher-speed spin to the supernatant to pellet mitochondria (mitochondrial fraction). This matches the expected sequence from the dependence of $v$ on $a$ and $(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m})$. Therefore B is correct.\n- Option C uses a high-speed spin first to pellet both organelles together, then a low-speed spin on the resuspended pellet to pellet nuclei and leave mitochondria in the supernatant. However, mitochondria would not be pelleted in that step and would remain in the supernatant mixed with smaller components; calling that supernatant the mitochondrial fraction without a subsequent higher-speed pelleting step is incorrect. Therefore C is incorrect.\n- Option D asserts that low speed pellets mitochondria and that high speed then pellets nuclei from the supernatant; this inverts the known order and contradicts the velocity scaling, so D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is to pellet nuclei at low speed, then pellet mitochondria from the supernatant at higher speed, as described in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1705289"}, {"introduction": "The intricate structure of an organelle is directly tied to its function, a principle beautifully illustrated by the mitochondrion. This practice invites you to use simple geometric modeling to quantify the immense increase in surface area provided by the inner membrane's folds, known as cristae.

We model it as consisting of two components: the 'inner boundary membrane' and the 'cristae'. The inner boundary membrane is approximated as the lateral surface area of the cylinder (ignoring the end caps).

In its natural form, Factor-H is known to be a nuclear protein. Through genetic engineering, the researchers create a fusion construct where the gene for Factor-H is ligated to the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). They then make a critical modification to the Factor-H portion of the construct: they specifically delete the genetic sequence that codes for the first 20 amino acids at the N-terminus, which is known to be the protein's only signal peptide for the endomembrane system. However, the modified Factor-H protein retains its three internal, non-overlapping amino acid sequences that are known to function as Nuclear Localization Signals (NLSs). This modified fusion protein is then expressed in a line of cultured human cells.\n\nAssuming the protein folds correctly and the GFP tag is functional, where would you expect to observe the highest concentration of green fluorescence when examining these cells with a fluorescence microscope?\n\nA. Secreted into the extracellular culture medium.\n\nB. Embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nC. Uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol, excluding the nucleus and organelles.\n\nD. Concentrated within the nucleus.\n\nE. Localized to the Golgi apparatus.\n\nF. Bound to the external surface of the plasma membrane.", "solution": "Step 1: Determine the site of translation and entry into cellular pathways. In eukaryotic cells, proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide targeting the endomembrane system are translated on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and enter the secretory pathway. Deleting the only signal peptide for the endomembrane system from Factor-H prevents its cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, the fusion protein will be synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and will not enter the ER-Golgi-secretory pathway.\n\nStep 2: Assess potential secretion or membrane localization. Without ER entry, the protein cannot be processed through the Golgi apparatus, cannot be secreted into the extracellular medium, and cannot be embedded in membranes via the secretory pathway. Thus, options A (secreted), E (Golgi), and F (plasma membrane surface) are excluded.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate mitochondrial localization. Targeting to mitochondria requires an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence or other specific mitochondrial targeting signals. The construct retains only nuclear localization signals and lacks mitochondrial targeting sequences; thus, option B (inner mitochondrial membrane) is excluded.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate nuclear localization. Nuclear import of large proteins requires nuclear localization signals that are recognized by importins and transported through nuclear pore complexes. The modified Factor-H retains three functional internal NLSs. Given the large size of the GFP-Tagged Factor-H (on the order of greater than 100 kDa), passive diffusion through nuclear pores is not feasible; therefore, active import via the NLS-importin pathway will occur. Consequently, the protein will accumulate in the nucleus.\n\nStep 5: Exclude uniform cytosolic distribution. Because functional NLSs are present, the protein will not remain uniformly distributed in the cytosol but will be actively transported and concentrated in the nucleus, excluding option C.\n\nConclusion: The highest concentration of green fluorescence will be observed in the nucleus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1705292"}]}
