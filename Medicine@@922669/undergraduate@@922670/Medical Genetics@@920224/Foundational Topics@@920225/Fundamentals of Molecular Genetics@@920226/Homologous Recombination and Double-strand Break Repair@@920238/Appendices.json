This practice emphasizes how the failure of even the final step—resolving the interconnected DNA strands—can be just as catastrophic as failing to start the repair at all.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying DNA repair mechanisms in a species of bacterium that relies on homologous recombination to repair Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs). A mutant strain of this bacterium has been engineered to possess a null mutation in the gene encoding the RuvC resolvase, rendering the RuvC protein completely non-functional. An actively dividing culture of this mutant strain is exposed to a chemical agent that specifically induces DSBs in the bacterial chromosome. Assuming the homologous recombination pathway is successfully initiated in response to these breaks and a homologous DNA template is available, what is the most likely primary consequence and ultimate cellular fate for the majority of the affected cells?\n\nChoose from the following options:\n\nA. The cells will be unable to perform strand invasion, leading to the persistence of the original DSBs and subsequent cell death.\n\nB. The cells will form stable Holliday junctions but will fail to resolve them, leading to an inability to segregate chromosomes during cell division and eventual cell death.\n\nC. The repair process will stall prior to the formation of Holliday junctions because the necessary protein complexes cannot assemble correctly at the site of the break.\n\nD. The cells will complete the repair process, but the absence of RuvC will cause an alternative, error-prone polymerase to be recruited, resulting in a high mutation rate but allowing the cells to survive.\n\nE. The Holliday junctions will be resolved by a different, less efficient enzyme system, allowing the cell to survive but with a significantly slower growth rate.", "solution": "We identify the key mechanistic role of RuvC in bacterial homologous recombination following a double-strand break. In the canonical pathway, a DSB is processed by nucleases (for example, RecBCD in many bacteria) to produce 3-prime single-stranded overhangs. RecA then mediates strand invasion into a homologous duplex, forming a displacement loop and subsequent capture of the second end, yielding one or two Holliday junctions. The RuvAB complex promotes branch migration of the Holliday junction(s), and RuvC is the endonuclease that specifically resolves Holliday junctions by coordinated endonucleolytic cleavage to generate ligatable DNA ends that can be sealed to complete repair.\n\nGiven that the mutant strain has a null mutation in the gene encoding RuvC, the resolvase activity required to cleave Holliday junctions is absent. The problem states that homologous recombination is successfully initiated and a homologous template is available. Therefore, upstream steps—end resection, RecA-mediated strand invasion, and formation of Holliday junctions—will proceed. RuvAB-mediated branch migration can still occur, but without RuvC, the junctions cannot be resolved by the canonical cleavage mechanism.\n\nThe primary consequence is the accumulation of unresolved Holliday junctions that physically link sister chromatids and generate persistent recombination intermediates. These structures impede completion of chromosome replication and block proper chromosome segregation during cell division. This failure leads to a division defect, activation of stress responses (such as the SOS response), and, for the majority of affected cells, eventual death due to catastrophic segregation failure or lethal genomic entanglements.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is incorrect because strand invasion is mediated by RecA and does not require RuvC; initiation still occurs.\nC is incorrect because assembly of the early homologous recombination machinery is upstream of RuvC’s function.\nD is incorrect because RuvC is a resolvase, not a DNA polymerase; its absence does not redirect to an error-prone polymerase to complete repair.\nE is generally incorrect in this context; while some organisms may harbor alternative resolvases (e.g., RusA under specific conditions or different systems in other taxa), the question frames the strain as RuvC-null without invoking compensatory resolvases, and the most likely primary consequence for the majority of cells is failure to resolve Holliday junctions and death.\nThus, the correct choice is that cells form Holliday junctions but cannot resolve them, leading to segregation failure and eventual death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050155"}, {"introduction": "When faced with a double-strand break, a cell doesn't just have one repair option; it has a toolkit of different pathways. The choice of which tool to use depends on factors like the cell cycle stage and the local DNA sequence. This problem presents a scenario where a break occurs between two repeated DNA sequences, creating a choice between high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) and the mutagenic single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway [@problem_id:2050179]. By contrasting their outcomes, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how repair pathway choice dictates the genetic fate of the cell, leading to either perfect restoration or a permanent, and potentially lethal, deletion.", "problem": "In a diploid eukaryotic cell line, a researcher identifies an essential gene required for cell survival, designated `GeneAlpha`. The genomic locus for `GeneAlpha` has the following structure on a particular chromosome: 5'-[Promoter]-[Exon 1]-[SeqA]-[Exon 2]-[SeqB]-[Exon 3]-3'. The sequences `SeqA` and `SeqB` are identical, 400-base-pair direct repeats. The entirety of `Exon 2`, which codes for a critical catalytic domain of the GeneAlpha protein, is located between `SeqA` and `SeqB`.\n\nDuring the G2 phase of the cell cycle, a single, clean double-strand break (DSB) occurs within `Exon 2`. The cell's repair machinery can resolve this damage through one of two major pathways: (1) high-fidelity Homologous Recombination (HR), which in the G2 phase preferentially uses the undamaged sister chromatid as a template, or (2) Single-Strand Annealing (SSA), a pathway that can utilize the flanking repeats `SeqA` and `SeqB`.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the genetic and cellular consequences of repairing this specific DSB by the HR pathway versus the SSA pathway?\n\nA. Both HR and SSA will perfectly restore the original sequence of `GeneAlpha`. As a result, the cell will survive regardless of the pathway used.\n\nB. Repair by HR will restore the original `GeneAlpha` sequence, leading to cell survival. Repair by SSA will also lead to cell survival but will result in the inversion of `Exon 2`.\n\nC. Repair by HR is error-prone and will cause a deletion of `Exon 2`, leading to cell death. Repair by SSA is a high-fidelity process that will restore the gene, allowing the cell to survive.\n\nD. Repair by HR will faithfully restore the original `GeneAlpha` sequence, allowing the cell to survive. Repair by SSA will result in the deletion of `Exon 2` and one of the repeats, leading to a non-functional essential gene and subsequent cell death.\n\nE. The SSA pathway cannot be initiated because the DSB is located between the repeats, not within them. Therefore, the cell will only survive if the HR pathway is used.", "solution": "The locus is 5'-[Promoter]-[Exon 1]-[SeqA]-[Exon 2]-[SeqB]-[Exon 3]-3', where SeqA and SeqB are identical direct repeats, and the DSB is within Exon 2 during G2. The two candidate pathways are homologous recombination (HR), which in G2 preferentially uses the intact sister chromatid as a template, and single-strand annealing (SSA), which anneals resected single-stranded DNA at homologous direct repeats and necessarily deletes the intervening DNA.\n\nFor HR in G2, the canonical steps are 5' to 3' resection at the break ends to create 3' single-stranded overhangs, RAD51-mediated strand invasion of the undamaged sister chromatid, DNA synthesis templated by the sister, and resolution of joint molecules. Because the sister chromatid carries the correct sequence, including the intact Exon 2, templated synthesis reconstructs the original sequence across the DSB site. Thus HR is high fidelity in this context and restores the original GeneAlpha sequence, preserving the catalytic domain encoded by Exon 2 and allowing cell survival.\n\nFor SSA, the necessary condition is the presence of homologous direct repeats flanking the break. After extensive 5' to 3' resection from the DSB, single-stranded sequences encompassing SeqA and SeqB are exposed. Because SeqA and SeqB are identical direct repeats, they anneal to each other. The nonhomologous 3' flaps are cleaved, gaps are filled, and ligation completes repair. The structural consequence of SSA between direct repeats is the deletion of one repeat copy and all intervening sequence. In this locus, the intervening sequence is the entirety of Exon 2; therefore, SSA deletes Exon 2 along with one copy of the repeat (either SeqA or SeqB), yielding a rearranged allele lacking the catalytic domain. This outcome is inherently mutagenic and produces a nonfunctional essential gene, which leads to loss of viability.\n\nTherefore, HR restores the original gene and supports survival, whereas SSA causes deletion of Exon 2 and one repeat, inactivating the essential gene and resulting in cell death. This excludes inversion (which would require inverted repeats), excludes the claim that SSA cannot initiate when the break is between repeats (this is precisely when SSA acts), and excludes the notion that HR is error-prone in this setting.\n\nHence, the most accurate statement is that HR is faithful and preserves viability, whereas SSA deletes Exon 2 and one repeat, producing a nonfunctional allele and cell death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2050179"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative descriptions, modern biology often uses mathematical models to understand and predict cellular behavior.
