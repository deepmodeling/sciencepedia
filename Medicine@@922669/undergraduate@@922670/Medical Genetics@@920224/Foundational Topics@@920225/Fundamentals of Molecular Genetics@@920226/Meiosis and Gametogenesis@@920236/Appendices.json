In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. A single nondisjunction event in meiosis I means one pair of homologous autosomes fails to separate at anaphase I, so both homologs migrate to the same pole. Therefore, the two secondary spermatocytes at the end of meiosis I have chromosome numbers\n$$\nn+1=6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n-1=4,\n$$\nbecause one cell receives both homologs from the affected pair (extra chromosome), and the other receives none from that pair (missing chromosome). All other chromosome pairs segregate normally.\n\nIn meiosis II, sister chromatids separate normally in both secondary spermatocytes. This preserves the chromosome counts set by meiosis I, yielding two spermatids from the $n+1$ secondary spermatocyte (each with $6$ chromosomes) and two spermatids from the $n-1$ secondary spermatocyte (each with $4$ chromosomes).

The sampling of each of the $n=3$ cells is considered an independent event.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of trisomic cells found in the sample of $n=3$ cells. Each cell draw is an independent Bernoulli trial with a probability of success (drawing a trisomic cell) of $p = 0.30$.
