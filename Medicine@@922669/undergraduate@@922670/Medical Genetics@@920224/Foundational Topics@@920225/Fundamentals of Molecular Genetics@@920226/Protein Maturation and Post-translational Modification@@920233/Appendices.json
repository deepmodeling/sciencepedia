It describes lysine acetylation, a fundamental post-translational modification in molecular biology, particularly in the context of histone proteins and chromatin regulation.

No violations of the validation criteria are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The derivation of a solution will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Change in Net Charge, $\\Delta Q$**\n\nThe change in the net charge of the protein, $\\Delta Q$, is the difference between its final charge ($Q_{\\text{final}}$) and its initial charge ($Q_{\\text{initial}}$).\n$$ \\Delta Q = Q_{\\text{final}} - Q_{\\text{initial}} $$\nGiven the assumption that we only consider the $n$ lysine residues being modified, this change is $n$ times the average change in charge for a single lysine residue, $\\Delta q_{\\text{lys}}$.\n$$ \\Delta Q = n \\cdot \\Delta q_{\\text{lys}} = n \\cdot (\\langle q_{\\text{after}} \\rangle - \\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle) $$\nHere, $\\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle$ is the average charge of a single lysine side chain before acetylation, and $\\langle q_{\\text{after}} \\rangle$ is its average charge after acetylation.\n\nFirst, we determine $\\langle q_{\\text{after}} \\rangle$. The problem states that after acetylation, the side chain is a neutral amide, contributing $0$ to the net charge.\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{after}} \\rangle = 0 $$\n\nNext, we determine $\\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle$. Before acetylation, the lysine $\\varepsilon$-amino group is a basic site involved in the following acid-base equilibrium:\n$$ \\text{Lys-NH}_3^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Lys-NH}_2 + \\text{H}^+ $$\nThe protonated form ($\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+$) has a charge of $+1$, and the deprotonated form ($\\text{Lys-NH}_2$) has a charge of $0$. The average charge of the residue, $\\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle$, is equal to the mole fraction of the protonated, positively charged form, which we denote as $f_{\\text{prot}}$.\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle = (+1) \\cdot f_{\\text{prot}} + (0) \\cdot (1 - f_{\\text{prot}}) = f_{\\text{prot}} $$\nThe fraction $f_{\\text{prot}}$ is given by:\n$$ f_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]}{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+] + [\\text{Lys-NH}_2]} $$\nTo find this fraction, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, and the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_a + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{Lys-NH}_2]}{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]} \\right) $$\nRearranging to solve for the ratio of concentrations:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{Lys-NH}_2]}{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]} \\right) $$\n$$ 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a} = \\frac{[\\text{Lys-NH}_2]}{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]} $$\nNow, we substitute this ratio back into the expression for $f_{\\text{prot}}$. By dividing the numerator and denominator by $[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]$, we get:\n$$ f_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{Lys-NH}_2]}{[\\text{Lys-NH}_3^+]}} $$\nSubstituting the expression from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$ f_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}} $$\nSo, the average charge of a single lysine residue before acetylation is:\n$$ \\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}} $$\nNow we can calculate the total change in charge, $\\Delta Q$, for the acetylation of $n$ such residues.\n$$ \\Delta Q = n \\cdot (\\langle q_{\\text{after}} \\rangle - \\langle q_{\\text{before}} \\rangle) = n \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta Q = - \\frac{n}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 10.5$:\n$$ \\Delta Q = - \\frac{n}{1 + 10^{7.4 - 10.5}} $$\n$$ \\Delta Q = - \\frac{n}{1 + 10^{-3.1}} $$\nThis expression represents the total decrease in the protein's net charge, in units of elementary charge, due to the acetylation of $n$ lysine residues. Since $\\mathrm{pH}  \\mathrm{p}K_a$, the exponent is negative, the denominator is close to $1$, and the charge of each lysine residue is close to $+1$ before modification. The change in charge is therefore negative and close to $-n$, as expected.\n\n**Mechanistic Explanation of Influence on Protein–DNA Interactions**\n\nThe derived negative change in charge, $\\Delta Q  0$, signifies a reduction in the net positive charge of the chromatin-associated protein. In the context of chromatin, proteins such as histones are rich in basic residues like lysine and arginine, giving their histone tail domains a significant net positive charge at physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$. This positive charge promotes strong electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of DNA. This attraction is a key force in compacting DNA into a condensed, heterochromatin-like state, which is generally transcriptionally silent.\n\nThe acetylation of $n$ lysine residues neutralizes $n$ positive charges, thereby reducing the protein's overall positive charge. This weakens the electrostatic affinity between the protein and the DNA backbone. As a result, the chromatin structure becomes less condensed and more \"open\" or \"relaxed\" (euchromatin-like). This decondensation increases the accessibility of the DNA to the transcriptional machinery, including transcription factors and RNA polymerase. Consequently, lysine acetylation is a canonical mark of transcriptionally active or poised genes, as it facilitates the process of gene expression by remodeling the local chromatin environment.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{n}{1 + 10^{-3.1}}} $$", "id": "5075864"}, {"introduction": "Beyond altering a protein's function, PTMs can also serve as signals that determine a protein's lifespan within the cell.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution involves three parts as requested: deriving the general expression for half-life, computing the mutant half-life, and providing a qualitative justification for the phenotypic consequences.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the general expression for protein half-life ($t_{1/2}$)**\n\nThe decay of the protein is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = -k_{\\deg}P $$\nwhere $P(t)$ is the protein abundance at time $t$ and $k_{\\deg}$ is the degradation rate constant. This is a separable differential equation. We separate the variables $P$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{P} = -k_{\\deg} dt $$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. Let the initial protein abundance at $t=0$ be $P(0) = P_0$. We integrate from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{P_0}^{P(t)} \\frac{1}{P'} dP' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\deg} dt' $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ [\\ln(P')]_{P_0}^{P(t)} = [-k_{\\deg}t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(P_0) = -k_{\\deg}t $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(t)}{P_0}\\right) = -k_{\\deg}t $$\nTo solve for $P(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\exp(-k_{\\deg}t) $$\n$$ P(t) = P_0 \\exp(-k_{\\deg}t) $$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the protein abundance to decrease to half of its initial value, i.e., $P(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{P_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $P(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{P_0}{2} = P_0 \\exp(-k_{\\deg}t_{1/2}) $$\nDividing by $P_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\deg}t_{1/2}) $$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\deg}t_{1/2} $$\nSince $\\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, the equation becomes:\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k_{\\deg}t_{1/2} $$\nTherefore, the general expression for the half-life is:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\deg}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the mutant half-life**\n\nFirst, we must determine the degradation rate constant for the mutant protein, $k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}$.\nThe wild-type degradation rate constant is given as $k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}} = 0.12~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nLet the E3 ligase binding occupancy for the wild-type protein be $O_{\\text{WT}}$. The mutant protein exhibits a $60\\%$ reduction in E3 binding occupancy relative to the wild type. This means the occupancy of the mutant, $O_{\\text{mutant}}$, is:\n$$ O_{\\text{mutant}} = O_{\\text{WT}} - 0.60 \\times O_{\\text{WT}} = (1 - 0.60) O_{\\text{WT}} = 0.40 \\times O_{\\text{WT}} $$\nThe problem states that the effective degradation rate constant, $k_{\\deg}$, scales linearly with E3 occupancy, $O$. This can be expressed as $k_{\\deg} = c \\times O$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\nFor the wild-type and mutant proteins, we have:\n$$ k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}} = c \\times O_{\\text{WT}} $$\n$$ k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}} = c \\times O_{\\text{mutant}} $$\nWe can find the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}}{k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}}} = \\frac{c \\times O_{\\text{mutant}}}{c \\times O_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{mutant}}}{O_{\\text{WT}}} = 0.40 $$\nTherefore, the mutant degradation rate constant is $40\\%$ of the wild-type rate constant:\n$$ k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}} = 0.40 \\times k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}} = 0.40 \\times 0.12~\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.048~\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nNow, we use the half-life formula derived in Part 1 to compute the mutant half-life, $t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}}$:\n$$ t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.048~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.048}~\\mathrm{h} \\approx 14.44056~\\mathrm{h} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ t_{1/2, \\text{mutant}} \\approx 14.4~\\mathrm{h} $$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative justification of phenotypic consequences**\n\nAt steady state, the rate of protein synthesis, $S$, is equal to the rate of protein degradation. The rate of degradation for a protein following first-order kinetics is the product of its degradation rate constant, $k_{\\deg}$, and its steady-state abundance, $P_{\\text{ss}}$.\n$$ S = k_{\\deg} \\times P_{\\text{ss}} $$\nSolving for the steady-state abundance gives:\n$$ P_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{S}{k_{\\deg}} $$\nThe problem states that the synthesis rate $S$ is unchanged for the mutant. We have calculated that the mutant's degradation rate constant is lower than the wild-type's: $k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}  k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}}$ ($0.048~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ vs $0.12~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\nSince $P_{\\text{ss}}$ is inversely proportional to $k_{\\deg}$, a decrease in the degradation rate constant will lead to an increase in the steady-state abundance of the protein. Specifically, the ratio of mutant to wild-type steady-state levels is:\n$$ \\frac{P_{\\text{ss, mutant}}}{P_{\\text{ss, WT}}} = \\frac{S/k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}}{S/k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}}} = \\frac{k_{\\deg, \\text{WT}}}{k_{\\deg, \\text{mutant}}} = \\frac{0.12}{0.048} = 2.5 $$\nThe mutant transcription factor will accumulate to a steady-state level $2.5$ times higher than the wild-type protein.\nThe protein is described as a \"dosage-sensitive transcription factor that controls cell-cycle entry.\" The term \"dosage-sensitive\" implies that the cellular phenotype is sensitive to the precise amount of this protein. An overabundance of a positive regulator of cell-cycle entry would be expected to promote progression through the cell cycle. Therefore, the significant increase in the steady-state level of this transcription factor is likely to cause aberrant or uncontrolled cell proliferation. Phenotypically, this could manifest as tissue overgrowth (hyperplasia) and may predispose the individual to cancer, as uncontrolled cell-cycle entry is a hallmark of cancer.
