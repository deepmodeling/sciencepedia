By the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is transcribed to mRNA, which is then translated into protein by reading codons. Single-nucleotide substitutions in a codon can yield distinct mutation classes: a synonymous substitution produces the same amino acid, a missense substitution produces a different amino acid, and a nonsense substitution produces a stop codon.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, it is valid, and a solution may be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Classification of Single-Nucleotide Substitutions\n\nThe starting codon is `CGA`, which encodes the amino acid Arginine (Arg) under the Standard Genetic Code. We must enumerate and classify the $9$ possible codons resulting from a single nucleotide change.\n\nThe $9$ altered codons are generated by changing one of the three positions to one of the other three possible nucleotides.\n\n**1. Substitutions at Position 1 (C $\\rightarrow$ A, G, U):**\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `AGA`: According to the Standard Genetic Code, `AGA` encodes Arginine (Arg). Since the amino acid is unchanged, this is a **synonymous** substitution.\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `GGA`: `GGA` encodes Glycine (Gly). Since the amino acid changes from Arginine to Glycine, this is a **missense** substitution.\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `UGA`: `UGA` is a stop codon (specifically, the \"Opal\" stop codon). A substitution that creates a stop codon is a **nonsense** substitution.\n\n**2. Substitutions at Position 2 (G $\\rightarrow$ A, C, U):**\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CAA`: `CAA` encodes Glutamine (Gln). This is a **missense** substitution (Arg $\\rightarrow$ Gln).\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CCA`: `CCA` encodes Proline (Pro). This is a **missense** substitution (Arg $\\rightarrow$ Pro).\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CUA`: `CUA` encodes Leucine (Leu). This is a **missense** substitution (Arg $\\rightarrow$ Leu).\n\n**3. Substitutions at Position 3 (A $\\rightarrow$ C, G, U):**\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CGC`: `CGC` encodes Arginine (Arg). This is a **synonymous** substitution.\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CGG`: `CGG` encodes Arginine (Arg). This is a **synonymous** substitution.\n- `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CGU`: `CGU` encodes Arginine (Arg). This is a **synonymous** substitution.\n\n**Summary of Classifications:**\n- **Synonymous codons ($4$):** `AGA`, `CGU`, `CGC`, `CGG` (all encode Arginine).\n- **Missense codons ($4$):** `GGA` (Gly), `CAA` (Gln), `CCA` (Pro), `CUA` (Leu).\n- **Nonsense codon ($1$):** `UGA` (Stop).\n\nTotal altered codons evaluated: $4 + 4 + 1 = 9$. The classification is complete.\n\n#### Part 2: Analysis of Missense Mutations using Grantham Distance\n\nThe problem states that lower Grantham distance implies a more conservative substitution, which is more likely to be functionally tolerated. We must find which of the four missense amino acid substitutions has the smallest Grantham distance relative to the original amino acid, Arginine (Arg).\n\nThe missense substitutions are:\n1.  Arginine (Arg) $\\rightarrow$ Glycine (Gly)\n2.  Arginine (Arg) $\\rightarrow$ Glutamine (Gln)\n3.  Arginine (Arg) $\\rightarrow$ Proline (Pro)\n4.  Arginine (Arg) $\\rightarrow$ Leucine (Leu)\n\nConsulting a standard Grantham Distance matrix (Grantham, R. 1974. Science 185:862-864), we find the following distances:\n- Distance(Arg, Gly) = $123$\n- Distance(Arg, Gln) = $29$\n- Distance(Arg, Pro) = $73$\n- Distance(Arg, Leu) = $95$\n\nComparing these values: $29 < 73 < 95 < 123$.\n\nThe smallest distance is $29$, which corresponds to the substitution of Arginine (Arg) with Glutamine (Gln). Therefore, the missense mutation resulting from the codon change `CGA` $\\rightarrow$ `CAA` is predicted to be the most tolerated among the missense possibilities.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Synonymous: AGA, CGU, CGC, CGG; nonsense: UGA; missense: GGA (glycine), CAA (glutamine), CCA (proline), CUA (leucine). Among the missense outcomes, CAA (glutamine) is most biochemically similar to arginine by Grantham distance and thus most likely to be tolerated relative to the others.**\n- The classification of all $9$ mutations is correct according to our derivation.\n- The analysis of Grantham distance is also correct. The substitution to Glutamine (Gln, codon `CAA`) has the lowest Grantham distance ($29$) and is thus predicted to be the most tolerated.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Synonymous: CGU, CGC, CGG only; nonsense: UAA; missense: AGA (lysine), GGA (glycine), CAA (glutamine), CCA (proline), CUA (leucine). Among the missense outcomes, GGA (glycine) is most similar to arginine and thus most likely tolerated.**\n- The classification is incorrect. It omits `AGA` from the synonymous list and incorrectly classifies it as a missense mutation to Lysine. In the Standard Genetic Code, `AGA` encodes Arginine.\n- It incorrectly identifies the nonsense codon as `UAA` instead of `UGA`.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Synonymous: AGA, CGU; nonsense: UGA; missense: CGC (arginine), CGG (arginine), CAA (glutamine), CCA (proline), CUA (leucine). Among the missense outcomes, CUA (leucine) is more biochemically similar to arginine than CAA (glutamine) by Grantham distance.**\n- The classification is incorrect. It omits `CGC` and `CGG` from the synonymous list and incorrectly classifies them as missense. A missense mutation must, by definition, change the amino acid.\n- The Grantham distance comparison is incorrect. Distance(Arg, Gln) is $29$ and Distance(Arg, Leu) is $95$. Glutamine is biochemically more similar to Arginine than Leucine is.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. All third-position changes (CGA to CGU/CGC/CGG) are missense because the third base uniquely determines the amino acid. The first-position change to UGA is synonymous, and among the missense outcomes, proline is most similar to arginine by Grantham distance.**\n- This option contains multiple fundamental errors. The three third-position changes listed are all synonymous, not missense. The premise that the third base uniquely determines the amino acid is false; this position is known for its \"wobble\" or degeneracy.\n- The change to `UGA` is a nonsense mutation, not synonymous.\n- The claim that Proline is most similar to Arginine is false; Glutamine is more similar (Distance $29$ vs. $73$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Synonymous: AGA, CGU, CGC, CGG; nonsense: UGA; missense: GGA (glycine), CAA (glutamine), CCA (proline), CUA (leucine). Among the missense outcomes, CUA (leucine) is most biochemically similar to arginine by Grantham distance and thus most likely to be tolerated.**\n- The classification of the mutations is correct.\n- However, the conclusion about Grantham distance is incorrect. As calculated, the Arg $\\rightarrow$ Gln substitution (distance $29$) is far more conservative than the Arg $\\rightarrow$ Leu substitution (distance $95$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5064308"}, {"introduction": "Unlike single nucleotide substitutions, the insertion or deletion (indel) of nucleotides can drastically alter a protein by disrupting the triplet reading frame.

The concepts described—exons, codons of length $3$, translation, reading frames, and indel mutations—are fundamental and accurately portrayed principles of molecular biology and genetics. The effect of an indel's length on the reading frame (i.e., a frameshift mutation) is a core concept.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective and all the necessary probabilistic information to arrive at a unique solution. The condition for preserving the reading frame is explicitly linked to codon partitioning, which has a precise mathematical meaning in this context.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective and precise language, free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The exon length of $150$ is extraneous information, as the condition for frame preservation is independent of the total sequence length. Similarly, the equal likelihood of an insertion versus a deletion is also irrelevant because the preservation of the reading frame depends only on the magnitude of the length change (the value of $k$), not its sign (addition or removal). This does not render the problem invalid, but rather tests the ability to discern relevant from irrelevant data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central principle of this problem is the nature of the genetic code's reading frame. The sequence of nucleotides in a protein-coding gene is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. An event preserves the downstream reading frame if and only if it does not alter the starting position of subsequent codons relative to the established frame.\n\nAn indel mutation, by definition, is the insertion or deletion of a block of nucleotides. Let the length of this block be $k$ nucleotides.\n-   An insertion of $k$ nucleotides shifts the sequence downstream of the insertion point forward by $k$ positions.\n-   A deletion of $k$ nucleotides shifts the sequence downstream of the deletion point backward by $k$ positions.\n\nIn either case, the reading frame is based on a modulus of $3$. For a downstream nucleotide at original position $n$ (where $n$ is the first base of a codon), its new position will be $n+k$ or $n-k$. For this new position to also be the first base of a codon in the original reading frame, the shift amount $k$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $k$ is not a multiple of $3$, the grouping of nucleotides into codons is disrupted, causing a frameshift mutation.\n\nThe problem states that the reading frame is preserved if \"the net change in coding sequence length leaves codon partitioning unaltered\". This is a formal statement of the condition that the length of the indel, $k$, must be a multiple of $3$.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that the reading frame is preserved. Event $E$ occurs if and only if $k$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nThe problem provides the probability distribution for the random variable $k$, the length of the indel. The set of possible values for $k$ is:\n$$ S_k = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} $$\nThe problem states that each length is equally likely. The size of the sample space is $|S_k| = 6$. Therefore, the probability of any specific length $k_i \\in S_k$ is:\n$$ P(k=k_i) = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nWe are interested in the probability of event $E$, which corresponds to the outcomes in $S_k$ that are multiples of $3$. The subset of $S_k$ that satisfies this condition is:\n$$ A = \\{k \\in S_k \\mid k \\pmod 3 = 0\\} = \\{3, 6\\} $$\nThe event $E$ occurs if $k=3$ or $k=6$. Since these are mutually exclusive events, the probability of $E$ is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P(E) = P(k=3) + P(k=6) $$\nUsing the uniform probability distribution for $k$:\n$$ P(E) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$ P(E) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe information regarding the exon length ($150$ base pairs) and the equal probability of insertions versus deletions is superfluous to the calculation, as the preservation of the reading frame depends exclusively on the length of the indel, $k$, and its divisibility by $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "5064286"}, {"introduction": "Cells have evolved sophisticated quality-control systems to protect against the potentially harmful effects of truncated proteins produced from mutated genes.

During pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) splicing, Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) are deposited approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of exon–exon junctions on the mature mRNA. According to the Central Dogma of molecular biology, ribosomes translate the coding sequence in triplet codons of length $3$ nucleotides, and translation normally terminates at the physiological stop codon in the last exon, where the proximity of Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) facilitates normal termination. In contrast, translation termination at a premature termination codon (PTC, a nonsense mutation) can recruit the Up-Frameshift (UPF) surveillance factors and trigger Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) if one or more EJCs remain downstream of the terminating ribosome. Empirically, the widely used $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule states that a PTC located at least about $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction is likely to elicit NMD.\n\nConsider a $5$-exon transcript in which the coding sequence of the last exon begins at codon position $200$ (that is, the exon–exon junction between the penultimate and last exons occurs immediately before codon $200$), and a nonsense mutation introduces a PTC at codon position $120$. Assume that codon boundaries align with exon boundaries, that codons are contiguous without introns within exons, and that the distance for applying the $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule is measured from the last nucleotide of the PTC triplet to the nucleotide immediately upstream of the last exon–exon junction.

Provide the value of $S(d)$ as your final answer (no units). No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed exercise in molecular genetics. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of gene expression, mRNA splicing, and the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway. The parameters and definitions are clear, self-contained, and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe molecular basis for NMD, as described in the problem, begins with the process of pre-mRNA splicing in the cell nucleus. During this process, non-coding regions (introns) are removed, and coding regions (exons) are ligated together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). A key event in this process is the deposition of a multiprotein complex, the Exon Junction Complex (EJC), on the newly formed mRNA, typically at a position $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon–exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing history of the mRNA.\n\nAfter being exported to the cytoplasm, the mature mRNA is engaged by a ribosome, which initiates translation. The ribosome traverses the mRNA, reading the genetic code in triplet codons of length $3$ nucleotides and synthesizing a corresponding polypeptide chain. As the ribosome progresses, it displaces the EJCs that lie in its path. Under normal circumstances, translation proceeds until the ribosome encounters a physiological stop codon, which is almost always located in the final exon. By the time the ribosome reaches this point, it will have cleared all EJCs from the mRNA. Termination at a normal stop codon is an efficient process, often facilitated by the interaction of release factors with the Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) bound to the mRNA's poly(A) tail.\n\nA nonsense mutation introduces a premature termination codon (PTC) into the coding sequence. When the translating ribosome encounters a PTC, it stalls and dissociates from the mRNA prematurely. The critical determinant for NMD activation is the position of this PTC relative to the downstream EJCs. If the ribosome terminates at a location that leaves at least one EJC remaining on the mRNA downstream of the termination site, this EJC acts as a signal of aberrant translation. The presence of a downstream EJC, in conjunction with the stalled ribosome at the PTC, leads to the recruitment of the core NMD surveillance factors, including the Up-Frameshift (UPF) proteins (e.g., UPF1, UPF2, UPF3). This surveillance complex then orchestrates the rapid degradation of the faulty mRNA, preventing the synthesis of a potentially deleterious truncated protein.\n\nThe so-called $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule is an empirically derived guideline that formalizes this concept. It posits that a PTC located more than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction is likely to trigger NMD. This distance ensures that an EJC (located $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of that junction) remains on the mRNA after the ribosome has terminated at the PTC, thereby providing the signal for NMD.\n\nWe can now apply this framework to the specific problem. We are given a transcript where a PTC is introduced at codon position $120$, and the final exon–exon junction occurs immediately before codon position $200$. The length of each codon is $3$ nucleotides.\n\nLet the nucleotide positions be indexed starting from $1$ at the beginning of the coding sequence. The position of the last nucleotide of any given codon $n$ is given by $3n$.\n\nThe PTC is at codon $120$. The position of the last nucleotide of this PTC is:\n$$p_{\\text{PTC}} = 3 \\times 120 = 360$$\n\nThe last exon–exon junction is located immediately before codon $200$. This means the penultimate exon ends with codon $199$. The nucleotide immediately upstream of this junction is the last nucleotide of codon $199$. Its position is:\n$$p_{\\text{junction}} = 3 \\times 199 = 597$$\n\nThe problem defines the distance $d$ as the measure from the last nucleotide of the PTC triplet to the nucleotide immediately upstream of the last exon–exon junction. This distance corresponds to the number of nucleotides separating position $p_{\\text{PTC}}$ from position $p_{\\text{junction}}$. This can be calculated as the difference in their positional indices.\n$$d = p_{\\text{junction}} - p_{\\text{PTC}}$$\n$$d = 597 - 360 = 237$$\nAlternatively, the number of full codons between the PTC (codon $120$) and the start of the last exon (codon $200$) is from codon $121$ to codon $199$, inclusive. The count of these codons is $199 - 121 + 1 = 79$. The total nucleotide distance covered by these codons is $79 \\text{ codons} \\times 3 \\text{ nucleotides/codon} = 237 \\text{ nucleotides}$. Thus, $d = 237$.\n\nThe problem states that NMD is predicted to occur if this distance $d$ is greater than or equal to a threshold of $55$ nucleotides. We evaluate the indicator variable $S(d)$:\n$$\nS(d) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } d \\ge 55 \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } d < 55\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe have calculated $d = 237$. Comparing this value to the threshold:\n$$237 \\ge 55$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the PTC is located sufficiently far upstream of the final exon–exon junction to trigger NMD. According to the defined indicator function, the value of $S(d)$ is $1$.
