This exercise explores the direct consequences of alternative splicing on the protein-coding sequence, focusing on how the length of a skipped exon determines whether the resulting protein is simply shorter or fundamentally altered by a frameshift. By working through this problem, you will solidify your understanding of the \"rule of three\" in molecular genetics and its importance in predicting the outcome of splicing variations [@problem_id:2294332].", "problem": "The gene *G1* in a eukaryotic organism codes for a structural protein. Its primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains five exons. Through alternative splicing, two different mature mRNA molecules are produced in the cell. The first, `mRNA-A`, represents the canonical transcript containing all five exons. The second, `mRNA-B`, is an isoform where exon 3 is precisely skipped, causing exon 2 to be joined directly to exon 4. Analysis reveals that the skipped exon 3 is exactly 63 nucleotides long. Both `mRNA-A` and `mRNA-B` are stable and successfully translated into `Protein-A` and `Protein-B`, respectively. The start codon for translation is located in exon 1 and the stop codon is located in exon 5.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of `Protein-B` compared to `Protein-A`?\n\nA. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by 21 amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids coded by exons 4 and 5 will be identical to that in `Protein-A`.\n\nB. The splicing event that creates `mRNA-B` will cause a shift in the translational reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence for the part of the protein coded by exons 4 and 5, likely resulting in a severely truncated protein.\n\nC. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by exactly 63 amino acids.\n\nD. The ribosome will be unable to translate `mRNA-B` past the novel junction between exon 2 and exon 4, resulting in a very short, non-functional protein fragment containing only the amino acids coded by exons 1 and 2.\n\nE. The amino acid sequence of `Protein-B` will be identical to `Protein-A` because the splicing machinery automatically inserts filler nucleotides to preserve the reading frame.", "solution": "The genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets (codons), so translation proceeds in a fixed reading frame determined by the start codon in exon 1. A deletion or insertion that changes the coding sequence by a number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 causes a frameshift; conversely, removal of a segment whose length is a multiple of 3 preserves the reading frame.\n\nLet the length of exon 3 be $L_{E3}=63$ nucleotides. Since each codon has length $c=3$ nucleotides, the number of codons encoded by exon 3 is\n$$\nn_{\\Delta}=\\frac{L_{E3}}{c}=\\frac{63}{3}=21.\n$$\nSkipping exon 3 therefore removes exactly $21$ codons from the open reading frame without altering the downstream reading frame, because\n$$\nL_{E3}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nThus, the length of Protein-B relative to Protein-A satisfies\n$$\nN_{B}=N_{A}-21,\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ and $N_{B}$ are the amino acid lengths of Protein-A and Protein-B, respectively. Because the reading frame is preserved, the codon boundaries at the exon 2–exon 4 junction align with the original frame, and the codon sequences in exons 4 and 5 are identical to those in the canonical mRNA-A. The start codon in exon 1 and stop codon in exon 5 remain correctly positioned in-frame, so translation proceeds normally through exons 4 and 5 with unchanged amino acid sequence in those regions.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is correct: Protein-B is shorter by $21$ amino acids, and the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 4 and 5 are identical to Protein-A.\n- Option B is incorrect because there is no frameshift when $63$ nucleotides (a multiple of $3$) are removed.\n- Option C is incorrect because $63$ nucleotides correspond to $21$ amino acids, not $63$ amino acids.\n- Option D is incorrect because ribosomes translate contiguous codons across exon-exon junctions; the junction does not impede translation when the frame is preserved.\n- Option E is incorrect because the splicing machinery does not insert filler nucleotides; frame preservation here results from the exon length being a multiple of $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2294332"}, {"introduction": "Alternative splicing is a key mechanism for expanding the coding potential of the genome, allowing a single gene to produce multiple distinct protein isoforms. This practice moves from the consequence of a single splicing event to the quantification of splicing activity across a population of transcripts. You will calculate the total number of individual splicing reactions required to produce a specific mixture of two different mRNA isoforms, reinforcing the concept that splicing is a discrete and quantifiable cellular process [@problem_id:2294350].", "problem": "In a specific eukaryotic cell line, a hypothetical gene known as *Regulin* is actively transcribed. The primary transcript of the *Regulin* gene is composed of a sequence containing 7 exons separated by 6 introns. Through the process of alternative splicing, two distinct mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms are produced from this single gene: Isoform X and Isoform Y.\n\n- **Isoform X** is the full-length version, which includes all 7 exons spliced together in their correct sequence.\n- **Isoform Y** is a variant where exon 3 and exon 5 are both skipped. The remaining exons (1, 2, 4, 6, 7) are spliced together in their original numerical order.\n\nDuring a particular experiment, it is observed that for every 150 primary *Regulin* transcripts that undergo processing, 90 are converted into Isoform X and the remaining 60 are converted into Isoform Y.\n\nCalculate the total number of individual splicing ligation events that occur to process this batch of 150 primary transcripts. A single splicing event is defined as the enzymatic process that removes one continuous intronic sequence and ligates the two flanking exons.", "solution": "We model each splicing ligation event as the removal of one continuous intronic segment with ligation of its two flanking exons, which corresponds to forming one exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA. For a linear transcript containing $E$ exons in the final mRNA, the number of exon-exon junctions (and thus splicing events) required is $E-1$.\n\nFor Isoform X (full-length), the number of exons retained is $E_{X}=7$, so the number of splicing events per transcript is\n$$\ns_{X}=E_{X}-1=7-1=6.\n$$\nFor Isoform Y (with exon 3 and exon 5 skipped), the retained exons are $1,2,4,6,7$, so $E_{Y}=5$, and the number of splicing events per transcript is\n$$\ns_{Y}=E_{Y}-1=5-1=4.\n$$\nGiven $N_{X}=90$ transcripts form Isoform X and $N_{Y}=60$ form Isoform Y, the total number of splicing ligation events $S$ across all processed transcripts is\n$$\nS=N_{X}s_{X}+N_{Y}s_{Y}=90\\cdot 6+60\\cdot 4=540+240=780.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of individual splicing ligation events is $780$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{780}$$", "id": "2294350"}, {"introduction": "In modern medical genetics and molecular biology research, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a powerful lens to observe and quantify gene expression, including alternative splicing.
