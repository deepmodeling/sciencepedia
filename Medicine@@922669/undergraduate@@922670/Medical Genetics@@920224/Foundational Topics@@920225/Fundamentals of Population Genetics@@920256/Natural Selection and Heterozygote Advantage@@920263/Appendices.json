A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation of the Equilibrium Allele Frequency\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the sickle allele $S$, and $q = 1 - p$ be the frequency of the normal allele $A$ in the zygote population of a given generation. Under the assumption of a large, randomly mating population, the genotype frequencies at the zygote stage are given by the Hardy–Weinberg principle:\n-   Frequency of genotype $AA$: $f(AA) = q^2$\n-   Frequency of genotype $AS$: $f(AS) = 2pq$\n-   Frequency of genotype $SS$: $f(SS) = p^2$\n\nViability selection occurs between the zygote stage and the adult stage. The relative fitnesses of the genotypes are given as $w_{AA} = 1 - s_{m}$, $w_{AS} = 1$, and $w_{SS} = 1 - s_{h}$. The frequencies of the genotypes among the adult population after selection are proportional to the product of their initial frequencies and their respective fitnesses.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, which is the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses, with the weights being the genotype frequencies at the zygote stage.\n$$\n\\bar{w} = f(AA) w_{AA} + f(AS) w_{AS} + f(SS) w_{SS}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for frequencies and fitnesses:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = q^2(1 - s_{m}) + 2pq(1) + p^2(1 - s_{h})\n$$\n\nAfter selection, the frequencies of the genotypes in the adult population (which will contribute to the next generation's gene pool) are normalized by the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$:\n-   Frequency of adults with genotype $AA$: $f'(AA) = \\frac{q^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{q^2(1 - s_{m})}{\\bar{w}}$\n-   Frequency of adults with genotype $AS$: $f'(AS) = \\frac{2pq w_{AS}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{2pq}{\\bar{w}}$\n-   Frequency of adults with genotype $SS$: $f'(SS) = \\frac{p^2 w_{SS}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^2(1 - s_{h})}{\\bar{w}}$\n\nThe frequency of the $S$ allele in the next generation, denoted by $p'$, is the frequency of $S$ alleles in the gene pool of the surviving adult population. Each $SS$ individual contributes two $S$ alleles, and each $AS$ individual contributes one $S$ allele. Thus, the frequency of the $S$ allele is the frequency of $SS$ adults plus half the frequency of $AS$ adults:\n$$\np' = f'(SS) + \\frac{1}{2} f'(AS)\n$$\n$$\np' = \\frac{p^2 w_{SS}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2pq w_{AS}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^2 w_{SS} + pq w_{AS}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nWe can factor out $p$ from the numerator:\n$$\np' = \\frac{p(p w_{SS} + q w_{AS})}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\n\nAn equilibrium is reached when the allele frequency does not change from one generation to the next, i.e., $p' = p$. This equilibrium frequency is denoted by $p^{\\ast}$.\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{p^{\\ast}(p^{\\ast} w_{SS} + q^{\\ast} w_{AS})}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nwhere $q^{\\ast} = 1 - p^{\\ast}$ and $\\bar{w}$ is calculated at the equilibrium frequencies.\n\nThis equation has trivial solutions at the boundaries $p^{\\ast} = 0$ (fixation of allele $A$) and $p^{\\ast} = 1$ (fixation of allele $S$). The problem asks for the internal equilibrium, where $0  p^{\\ast}  1$. For this case, we can divide both sides by $p^{\\ast}$ (since $p^{\\ast} \\neq 0$):\n$$\n1 = \\frac{p^{\\ast} w_{SS} + q^{\\ast} w_{AS}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nThis implies that at equilibrium:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p^{\\ast} w_{SS} + q^{\\ast} w_{AS}\n$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $\\bar{w}$ at equilibrium:\n$$\n(q^{\\ast})^2 w_{AA} + 2p^{\\ast}q^{\\ast} w_{AS} + (p^{\\ast})^2 w_{SS} = p^{\\ast} w_{SS} + q^{\\ast} w_{AS}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n(q^{\\ast})^2 w_{AA} + 2p^{\\ast}q^{\\ast} w_{AS} - q^{\\ast} w_{AS} = p^{\\ast} w_{SS} - (p^{\\ast})^2 w_{SS}\n$$\nFactor out common terms:\n$$\nq^{\\ast}(q^{\\ast} w_{AA} + (2p^{\\ast} - 1) w_{AS}) = p^{\\ast}(1 - p^{\\ast}) w_{SS}\n$$\nSince $q^{\\ast} = 1 - p^{\\ast}$ and $2p^{\\ast} - 1 = p^{\\ast} - (1 - p^{\\ast}) = p^{\\ast} - q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nq^{\\ast}(q^{\\ast} w_{AA} + (p^{\\ast} - q^{\\ast}) w_{AS}) = p^{\\ast}q^{\\ast} w_{SS}\n$$\nFor an internal equilibrium, $q^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, so we can divide by $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nq^{\\ast} w_{AA} + p^{\\ast} w_{AS} - q^{\\ast} w_{AS} = p^{\\ast} w_{SS}\n$$\nRearrange to group terms with $p^{\\ast}$ and $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} w_{AS} - p^{\\ast} w_{SS} = q^{\\ast} w_{AS} - q^{\\ast} w_{AA}\n$$\nFactor out $p^{\\ast}$ and $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(w_{AS} - w_{SS}) = q^{\\ast}(w_{AS} - w_{AA})\n$$\nThis is a general condition for internal equilibrium under viability selection. Now, we substitute the specific fitness values given in the problem:\n$w_{AS} = 1$, $w_{SS} = 1 - s_{h}$, and $w_{AA} = 1 - s_{m}$.\n$$\np^{\\ast}(1 - (1 - s_{h})) = q^{\\ast}(1 - (1 - s_{m}))\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast}(s_{h}) = q^{\\ast}(s_{m})\n$$\nSubstitute $q^{\\ast} = 1 - p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} s_{h} = (1 - p^{\\ast}) s_{m}\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} s_{h} = s_{m} - p^{\\ast} s_{m}\n$$\nBring all terms involving $p^{\\ast}$ to one side:\n$$\np^{\\ast} s_{h} + p^{\\ast} s_{m} = s_{m}\n$$\nFactor out $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} (s_{h} + s_{m}) = s_{m}\n$$\nFinally, solving for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{s_{m}}{s_{m} + s_{h}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the stable internal equilibrium frequency of the sickle allele $S$ as a function of the selection coefficients against the two homozygous genotypes.

Under the assumption of random mating, the genotype frequencies at the zygote stage follow Hardy–Weinberg proportions:\n-   Frequency of $DD$: $p^2$\n-   Frequency of $ND$: $2pq$\n-   Frequency of $NN$: $q^2 = (1-p)^2$\n\nThe relative viabilities (fitnesses) of the genotypes are given as $w_{DD} = 1 - s_h$, $w_{ND} = 1$, and $w_{NN} = 1 - s_m$.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average fitness weighted by the genotype frequencies:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{DD} + 2pq w_{ND} + q^2 w_{NN} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2(1 - s_h) + 2p(1-p)(1) + (1-p)^2(1 - s_m) $$\n\nThe change in the frequency of the $D$ allele in one generation, $\\Delta p$, is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta p = p' - p = \\frac{p(pw_{DD} + qw_{ND})}{\\bar{w}} - p $$\nFactoring out $p$ and finding a common denominator gives:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p(pw_{DD} + qw_{ND} - \\bar{w})}{\\bar{w}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p(pw_{DD} + qw_{ND} - (p^2w_{DD} + 2pqw_{ND} + q^2w_{NN}))}{\\bar{w}} $$\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p(p(1-p)w_{DD} - pqw_{ND} - q^2w_{NN})}{\\bar{w}} $$\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq(pw_{DD} - pw_{ND} - qw_{NN})}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThe expression can be simplified to a more standard form:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq}{\\bar{w}} [p(w_{DD} - w_{ND}) + q(w_{ND} - w_{NN})] $$\n\nAt equilibrium, the allele frequency does not change, so $\\Delta p = 0$. For a polymorphic equilibrium to exist (where $0  p  1$ and $0  q  1$), the term in the square brackets must be zero. Let $p^{\\ast}$ be the equilibrium frequency of the $D$ allele.\n$$ p^{\\ast}(w_{DD} - w_{ND}) + (1-p^{\\ast})(w_{ND} - w_{NN}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the given fitness values $w_{DD} = 1 - s_h$, $w_{ND} = 1$, and $w_{NN} = 1 - s_m$:\n$$ p^{\\ast}((1 - s_h) - 1) + (1-p^{\\ast})(1 - (1 - s_m)) = 0 $$\n$$ p^{\\ast}(-s_h) + (1-p^{\\ast})(s_m) = 0 $$\n$$ -p^{\\ast}s_h + s_m - p^{\\ast}s_m = 0 $$\nRearranging to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$ s_m = p^{\\ast}s_h + p^{\\ast}s_m $$\n$$ s_m = p^{\\ast}(s_m + s_h) $$\nThis yields the equilibrium frequency for the $D$ allele:\n$$ p^{\\ast} = \\frac{s_m}{s_m + s_h} $$\n\nThe problem specifies the new environmental conditions after a medical intervention:\n-   $s_m = 0.10$\n-   $s_h = 0.30$\n\nWe can now calculate the new equilibrium frequency $p^{\\ast}$ using these values:\n$$ p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.10}{0.10 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.10}{0.40} = 0.25 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the new population-level burden of disease, defined as $B_{\\text{new}} \\equiv s_{h} \\, (p^{\\ast})^{2}$. We use the new values for both $s_h$ and $p^{\\ast}$.\n$$ B_{\\text{new}} = (0.30) \\times (0.25)^2 $$\nFirst, we calculate $(p^{\\ast})^2$:\n$$ (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 $$\nNow we calculate $B_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$ B_{\\text{new}} = 0.30 \\times 0.0625 = 0.01875 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.01875$ already has exactly four significant figures ($1$, $8$, $7$, $5$). Therefore, no rounding is necessary.\nThe new population-level burden of disease at equilibrium is $0.01875$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.01875}\n$$", "id": "5064591"}]}
