The Wright-Fisher model is a canonical and fundamental model used to study the effects of genetic drift. The scenario described (a founder event leading to a change in allele frequency) is a classic example of this process.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($N$, $p$) and a clear model (Wright-Fisher) to define a probability distribution. The question asks for a specific probability derived from this distribution, which is a mathematically unambiguous task.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. The setup is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of a founder event where the allele frequency of the small founder group is assumed to be identical to that of the large source population. This is an explicit modeling choice, not a contradiction. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the sampling distribution of the allele count in the next generation and a specific probability derived from it.\n\nThe formation of the next generation's gene pool is described by the Wright-Fisher model. In this model, the $2N$ alleles of the next generation are drawn with replacement from the gene pool of the current generation (the founders). This process is equivalent to a series of independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of pathogenic alleles in the offspring generation.\nThe number of trials, $n$, corresponds to the total number of alleles in the offspring population, which is $n = 2N$.\nGiven $N = 25$, we have $n = 2 \\times 25 = 50$.\n\nThe probability of \"success\" in each trial (i.e., the probability of drawing a pathogenic allele) is given as the allele frequency in the parental generation, $p = 0.01$.\n\nThe number of successes, $K$, in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with a constant probability of success $p$ follows a binomial distribution. Therefore, the sampling distribution of the next-generation allele copy count $K$ is:\n$$\nK \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)\n$$\nwith parameters $n = 50$ and $p = 0.01$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for this distribution, which gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ pathogenic alleles, is:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \\binom{50}{k} (0.01)^k (1 - 0.01)^{50-k}\n$$\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\binom{50}{k} (0.01)^k (0.99)^{50-k}\n$$\nThis is the sampling distribution of $K$.\n\nThe problem then requires us to compute the probability that the pathogenic allele frequency in the offspring generation is at least $0.05$. The allele frequency in the offspring generation is $\\frac{K}{2N} = \\frac{K}{50}$. We need to find the probability:\n$$\nP\\left(\\frac{K}{50} \\ge 0.05\\right)\n$$\nTo find the condition on the integer count $K$, we multiply the inequality by $50$:\n$$\nP(K \\ge 50 \\times 0.05) = P(K \\ge 2.5)\n$$\nSince $K$ must be an integer (it is a count of alleles), the condition $K \\ge 2.5$ is equivalent to $K \\ge 3$. Thus, we need to calculate $P(K \\ge 3)$.\n\nIt is computationally more convenient to calculate the probability of the complementary event, $P(K  3)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$\nP(K \\ge 3) = 1 - P(K  3) = 1 - [P(K=0) + P(K=1) + P(K=2)]\n$$\nWe now calculate each term using the PMF:\nFor $k=0$:\n$$\nP(K=0) = \\binom{50}{0} (0.01)^0 (0.99)^{50} = 1 \\times 1 \\times (0.99)^{50} = (0.99)^{50}\n$$\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\nP(K=1) = \\binom{50}{1} (0.01)^1 (0.99)^{49} = 50 \\times 0.01 \\times (0.99)^{49} = 0.5 \\times (0.99)^{49}\n$$\nFor $k=2$:\n$$\nP(K=2) = \\binom{50}{2} (0.01)^2 (0.99)^{48} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} \\times (0.01)^2 \\times (0.99)^{48} = 1225 \\times (0.0001) \\times (0.99)^{48} = 0.1225 \\times (0.99)^{48}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$\nP(K=0) \\approx 0.60500606\n$$\n$$\nP(K=1) \\approx 0.5 \\times \\frac{(0.99)^{50}}{0.99} \\approx 0.5 \\times \\frac{0.60500606}{0.99} \\approx 0.30555862\n$$\n$$\nP(K=2) \\approx 0.1225 \\times \\frac{(0.99)^{50}}{(0.99)^2} \\approx 0.1225 \\times \\frac{0.60500606}{0.9801} \\approx 0.07561502\n$$\nSumming these probabilities:\n$$\nP(K  3) \\approx 0.60500606 + 0.30555862 + 0.07561502 \\approx 0.9861797\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the desired probability:\n$$\nP(K \\ge 3) = 1 - P(K  3) \\approx 1 - 0.9861797 = 0.0138203\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n0.0138203 \\approx 0.01382\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that genetic drift in a small population can cause a substantial increase in the frequency of a rare allele in a single generation.

It is not trivial or tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-formulated problem in population genetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for $H_t$\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles based on the Wright-Fisher model of random genetic drift. In this model, a population of constant effective size $N_e$ consists of $2N_e$ alleles at a diploid locus. The alleles for generation $t+1$ are obtained by sampling $2N_e$ times with replacement from the gene pool of generation $t$.\n\nThe expected heterozygosity, $H_t$, is defined as the probability that two alleles sampled at random from the population in generation $t$ are different by state. Let $I_t$ be the probability that two randomly sampled alleles are identical by state. By definition, $H_t = 1 - I_t$. We will first find a recurrence relation for $I_t$.\n\nConsider two alleles sampled randomly from the population at generation $t+1$. We trace their ancestry back to generation $t$. There are two possibilities for their parental alleles in generation $t$:\n1.  The two alleles are copies of the *same* parental allele. In a gene pool of size $2N_e$, the probability of picking one allele and then picking a copy of that same allele again (sampling with replacement) is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. If the two alleles descend from the same parental allele, they are necessarily identical by state.\n2.  The two alleles are copies of *different* parental alleles. The probability of this event is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. If they descend from two different parental alleles, the probability that they are identical by state is simply the probability that any two random alleles in generation $t$ were identical, which is $I_t$.\n\nCombining these two mutually exclusive cases, the total probability of identity by state in generation $t+1$, denoted $I_{t+1}$, is given by the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$ I_{t+1} = (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) + (I_t) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n$$ I_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + I_t - \\frac{I_t}{2N_e} $$\n\nNow, we convert this relationship from identity ($I_t$) to heterozygosity ($H_t$) using $I_t = 1 - H_t$ and $I_{t+1} = 1 - H_{t+1}$:\n$$ 1 - H_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + (1 - H_t) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n$$ 1 - H_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + 1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e} - H_t + \\frac{H_t}{2N_e} $$\n$$ 1 - H_{t+1} = 1 - H_t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n$$ H_{t+1} = H_t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n\nThis is a recursive formula describing the change in heterozygosity over one generation. To find the expression for $H_t$ as a function of the initial heterozygosity $H_0$ and time $t$, we can solve this recurrence relation by iteration:\n$$ H_1 = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n$$ H_2 = H_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^2 $$\nBy induction, the expression for $H_t$ after $t$ generations is:\n$$ H_t = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nThis is the required discrete-time expression for $H_t$ derived from first principles.\n\n### Calculation of Time $t$\nThe second part of the problem asks for the number of generations $t$ required for the expected heterozygosity to be reduced by $0.10$ relative to $H_0$. This corresponds to the condition $H_t = (1 - 0.10)H_0 = 0.90\\,H_0$.\n\nWe substitute this condition into the derived expression for $H_t$:\n$$ 0.90\\,H_0 = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nAssuming $H_0 > 0$ (a non-monomorphic initial population), we can divide both sides by $H_0$:\n$$ 0.90 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(0.90) = \\ln\\left[\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t\\right] $$\n$$ \\ln(0.90) = t \\cdot \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given effective population size, $N_e = 1000$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 1000}\\right)} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2000}\\right)} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln(0.9995)} $$\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\ln(0.90) \\approx -0.10536051565 $$\n$$ \\ln(0.9995) \\approx -0.00050012502 $$\n$$ t \\approx \\frac{-0.10536051565}{-0.00050012502} \\approx 210.66801 $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final numerical answer to four significant figures.\n$$ t \\approx 210.7 $$\nThus, it will take approximately $210.7$ generations for the expected heterozygosity to decrease to $90\\%$ of its initial value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{210.7}$$", "id": "5037145"}, {"introduction": "The final consequence of persistent genetic drift in a finite population without new mutations is the fixation of one allele and the loss of all others.
