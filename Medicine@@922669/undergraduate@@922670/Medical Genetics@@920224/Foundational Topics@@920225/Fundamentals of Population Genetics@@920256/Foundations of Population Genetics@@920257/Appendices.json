It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem that lies at the core of population genetics. All necessary conditions and variables are provided, and the task is a standard derivation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle for a three-allele system.\n\nThe derivation of the expected genotype frequencies under Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) proceeds from the fundamental assumption of random mating in a large population. This is mathematically equivalent to the random union of gametes. We consider a very large gamete pool where the frequencies of the alleles $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$, respectively. The condition $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$ ensures that these are the only alleles at this locus.\n\nThe formation of a diploid genotype in the next generation is the result of the fusion of two gametes, one contributed by a male parent and one by a female parent. The key HWE assumptions relevant here are:\n1.  **Random Mating**: Any individual in the population has an equal chance of mating with any other individual of the opposite sex. This implies that the parental gametes that form the zygotes are drawn randomly and independently from the gene pool.\n2.  **Equal Allele Frequencies in Sexes**: The allele frequencies $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ are the same in male and female gametes.\n3.  **Independence of Allele Contributions**: The allele contributed by one parent is independent of the allele contributed by the other parent.\n\nLet us denote the event of drawing an allele $A_i$ from the paternal gamete pool as $P_i$ and from the maternal gamete pool as $M_i$. Based on the problem's premises, the probabilities of these events are:\n$P(\\text{drawing } A_1) = p_1$\n$P(\\text{drawing } A_2) = p_2$\n$P(\\text{drawing } A_3) = p_3$\n\nThese probabilities are identical for both the paternal and maternal gamete pools. We can now calculate the frequency of each of the six possible unordered genotypes by applying the rules of elementary probability.\n\n**Homozygous Genotypes**\nA homozygous genotype, such as $A_1A_1$, is formed when a gamete carrying the $A_1$ allele fuses with another gamete also carrying the $A_1$ allele. Due to the independence of gamete selection, the probability of this event is the product of the individual probabilities.\n-   **Frequency of $A_1A_1$**: The probability of receiving an $A_1$ allele from the father is $p_1$, and the probability of receiving an $A_1$ allele from the mother is also $p_1$.\n    $$P(A_1A_1) = P(\\text{paternal is } A_1 \\text{ AND maternal is } A_1) = P(\\text{paternal is } A_1) \\times P(\\text{maternal is } A_1) = p_1 \\times p_1 = p_1^2$$\n-   **Frequency of $A_2A_2$**: By the same logic, the probability of forming an $A_2A_2$ genotype is:\n    $$P(A_2A_2) = p_2 \\times p_2 = p_2^2$$\n-   **Frequency of $A_3A_3$**: Similarly, the probability of forming an $A_3A_3$ genotype is:\n    $$P(A_3A_3) = p_3 \\times p_3 = p_3^2$$\n\n**Heterozygous Genotypes**\nA heterozygous genotype, such as $A_1A_2$, can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways: the $A_1$ allele can come from the father and the $A_2$ from the mother, or vice versa. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n-   **Frequency of $A_1A_2$**:\n    The probability of ($A_1$ from father AND $A_2$ from mother) is $p_1 \\times p_2$.\n    The probability of ($A_2$ from father AND $A_1$ from mother) is $p_2 \\times p_1$.\n    Since these two events are mutually exclusive, the total probability of forming an unordered $A_1A_2$ genotype is:\n    $$P(A_1A_2) = (p_1 \\times p_2) + (p_2 \\times p_1) = 2p_1p_2$$\n-   **Frequency of $A_1A_3$**: By the same logic, the probability of forming an $A_1A_3$ genotype is:\n    $$P(A_1A_3) = (p_1 \\times p_3) + (p_3 \\times p_1) = 2p_1p_3$$\n-   **Frequency of $A_2A_3$**: Similarly, the probability of forming an $A_2A_3$ genotype is:\n    $$P(A_2A_3) = (p_2 \\times p_3) + (p_3 \\times p_2) = 2p_2p_3$$\n\nThese derived frequencies represent the expected proportions of each genotype in the population after one generation of random mating. They are the terms of the trinomial expansion of $(p_1 + p_2 + p_3)^2$.

The frequency of each genotype among the surviving adults is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness. The normalization constant is the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}_t$:\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = p_t^2 w_{AA} + 2p_t q_t w_{Aa} + q_t^2 w_{aa} = p_t^2(1-s_1) + 2p_t q_t(1) + q_t^2(1-s_2) $$\nBy expanding $p_t^2+2p_t q_t+q_t^2 = 1$, we can simplify this to:\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = 1 - s_1 p_t^2 - s_2 q_t^2 $$\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is its frequency in the gametes produced by the surviving adults. This is the frequency of $AA$ adults plus half the frequency of $Aa$ adults:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t^2 (1-s_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(2p_t q_t)}{\\bar{w}_t} = \\frac{p_t^2(1-s_1) + p_t q_t}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\nFactoring out $p_t$ from the numerator and substituting $q_t = 1-p_t$:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t[p_t(1-s_1) + (1-p_t)]}{\\bar{w}_t} = \\frac{p_t(1-s_1 p_t)}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\nThis gives the full recursion relation $p_{t+1} = f(p_t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the Internal Equilibrium ($p^*$**)\n\nAn equilibrium is reached when the allele frequency no longer changes, i.e., $p_{t+1} = p_t$. Let this equilibrium frequency be $p^*$. This occurs when the change in allele frequency per generation, $\\Delta p$, is zero. A general formula for $\\Delta p$ is:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p_t q_t [p_t(w_{AA}-w_{Aa}) + q_t(w_{Aa}-w_{aa})]}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\nSubstituting the given fitness values: $w_{AA}-w_{Aa} = -s_1$ and $w_{Aa}-w_{aa} = s_2$.\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p_t q_t [-s_1 p_t + s_2 q_t]}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\nFor an internal equilibrium, we need $0  p^*  1$, which means $p^* \\neq 0$ and $q^* \\neq 0$. Thus, for $\\Delta p=0$, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$ -s_1 p^* + s_2 q^* = 0 \\implies -s_1 p^* + s_2(1-p^*) = 0 $$\n$$ s_2 = s_1 p^* + s_2 p^* = p^*(s_1 + s_2) $$\nSolving for $p^*$:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2} $$\n\n**Part 3: Stability Analysis ($f'(p^*)$)**\n\nTo assess stability, we evaluate the derivative of the recursion function, $f'(p_t) = \\frac{d p_{t+1}}{d p_t}$, at the equilibrium point $p^*$. The equilibrium is locally stable if $|f'(p^*)|  1$.\nThe recursion is $f(p) = N(p)/D(p)$, where $N(p) = p(1-s_1 p)$ and $D(p) = \\bar{w}(p)$. A key insight is that for overdominance, the internal equilibrium maximizes mean fitness, so the derivative of the mean fitness is zero at this point: $D'(p^*) = \\bar{w}'(p^*) = 0$.\nThe derivative of the recursion, via the quotient rule, simplifies greatly at this point:\n$$ f'(p^*) = \\frac{N'(p^*)D(p^*) - N(p^*)D'(p^*)}{[D(p^*)]^2} = \\frac{N'(p^*)D(p^*) - 0}{[D(p^*)]^2} = \\frac{N'(p^*)}{D(p^*)} $$\nWe find the terms $N'(p^*)$ and $D(p^*)$:\n1. $N'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(p - s_1 p^2) = 1 - 2s_1 p$. So, $N'(p^*) = 1 - 2s_1 p^*$.\n2. From the equilibrium condition $p^* = f(p^*) = N(p^*)/D(p^*)$, we have $D(p^*) = N(p^*)/p^* = \\frac{p^*(1-s_1 p^*)}{p^*} = 1 - s_1 p^*$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f'(p^*)$:\n$$ f'(p^*) = \\frac{1 - 2s_1 p^*}{1 - s_1 p^*} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $p^* = \\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2}$:\n$$ f'(p^*) = \\frac{1 - 2s_1\\left(\\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2}\\right)}{1 - s_1\\left(\\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{s_1 + s_2 - 2s_1 s_2}{s_1 + s_2}}{\\frac{s_1 + s_2 - s_1 s_2}{s_1 + s_2}} $$\n$$ f'(p^*) = \\frac{s_1 + s_2 - 2s_1 s_2}{s_1 + s_2 - s_1 s_2} $$\nFor heterozygote advantage ($s_1, s_2 > 0$) with biologically plausible fitness values (implying $s_1, s_2 \\le 1$), the condition $|f'(p^*)|  1$ holds, indicating that the equilibrium is stable.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the exact conditional distribution of genotype counts, given the observed number of alleles. This is the basis for Fisher's exact test adapted for HWE. We begin from the specified first principles.\n\nUnder HWE, the probability of observing a particular set of genotype counts $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ in a sample of size $n$ is given by the multinomial distribution:\n$$P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | p) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} (p^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{Aa}} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{aa}}$$\nLet $h = n_{Aa}$ be the number of heterozygotes. We can rewrite the probability by collecting terms with $p$ and $(1-p)$:\n$$P(n_{AA}, h, n_{aa} | p) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!} 2^h p^{2n_{AA}+h} (1-p)^{2n_{aa}+h}$$\nThe total number of $A$ alleles in the sample is $m = 2n_{AA} + h$, and the total number of $a$ alleles is $2n - m = 2n_{aa} + h$. The total number of alleles is $2n$. Substituting $m$ into the equation:\n$$P(n_{AA}, h, n_{aa} | p) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!} 2^h p^m (1-p)^{2n-m}$$\nThe exact test for HWE conditions on the observed allele counts $(m, 2n-m)$. This is achieved by dividing the probability of the genotype configuration by the probability of observing $m$ copies of allele $A$ out of $2n$ total alleles. The number of $A$ alleles in the sample, $m$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $2n$ and $p$:\n$$P(m | p) = \\binom{2n}{m} p^m (1-p)^{2n-m}$$\nThe conditional probability of the genotype configuration, given the allele count $m$, is:\n$$P(n_{AA}, h, n_{aa} | n, m) = \\frac{P(n_{AA}, h, n_{aa} | p)}{P(m | p)} = \\frac{\\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!} 2^h p^m (1-p)^{2n-m}}{\\binom{2n}{m} p^m (1-p)^{2n-m}}$$\nThe terms involving the unknown allele frequency $p$ cancel out, yielding a distribution that is independent of $p$:\n$$P(n_{AA}, h, n_{aa} | n, m) = \\frac{n! \\, 2^h}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}! \\binom{2n}{m}}$$\nThis is the exact conditional distribution. Note that given $n$ and $m$, the genotype counts are determined by a single variable, $h$. The counts for homozygotes can be expressed in terms of $h$:\n$m = 2n_{AA} + h \\implies n_{AA} = \\frac{m - h}{2}$\n$n = n_{AA} + h + n_{aa} \\implies n_{aa} = n - h - n_{AA} = n - h - \\frac{m-h}{2} = n - \\frac{m+h}{2}$\nFor $n_{AA}$ and $n_{aa}$ to be non-negative integers, $h$ must have the same parity as $m$, and $h \\leq m$.\n\nNow we apply this to the given data.\nThe total number of individuals is $n=10$. The total number of alleles is $2n=20$.\nThe observed genotype counts are $n_{AA}=3, n_{Aa}=2, n_{aa}=5$.\nThe observed number of $A$ alleles is $m = 2 \\times n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = 2 \\times 3 + 2 = 8$.\nThe observed number of heterozygotes is $h_{obs} = 2$.\n\n**1. Enumerate feasible values of $h$ and their probabilities:**\nWe need to find all possible integer values for $h$ given $n=10$ and $m=8$.\nThe constraints on $h$ are:\n- $h \\ge 0$\n- $n_{AA} = (8-h)/2 \\ge 0 \\implies h \\le 8$.\n- $n_{aa} = 10 - (8+h)/2 \\ge 0 \\implies 20 \\ge 8+h \\implies h \\le 12$.\n- $h$ and $m$ must have the same parity. Since $m=8$ is even, $h$ must be even.\nCombining these, the set of feasible values for $h$ is $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n\nWe calculate the probability for each feasible $h$ using the derived formula. First, we compute the constant denominator:\n$$D = \\binom{2n}{m} = \\binom{20}{8} = \\frac{20!}{8!12!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times \\dots \\times 13}{8 \\times 7 \\times \\dots \\times 1} = 125970$$\nThe probability for a given $h$ is $P(h) = \\frac{N(h)}{D}$, where $N(h) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^h}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!}$.\n\n- For $h=0$: $n_{AA} = (8-0)/2 = 4$, $n_{aa} = 10-(8+0)/2 = 6$.\n$N(0) = \\frac{10!}{4!0!6!} 2^0 = \\binom{10}{4} = 210$.\n$P(h=0) = \\frac{210}{125970}$.\n\n- For $h=2$ (observed case): $n_{AA} = (8-2)/2 = 3$, $n_{aa} = 10-(8+2)/2 = 5$.\n$N(2) = \\frac{10!}{3!2!5!} 2^2 = 2520 \\times 4 = 10080$.\n$P(h=2) = \\frac{10080}{125970}$.\n\n- For $h=4$: $n_{AA} = (8-4)/2 = 2$, $n_{aa} = 10-(8+4)/2 = 4$.\n$N(4) = \\frac{10!}{2!4!4!} 2^4 = 3150 \\times 16 = 50400$.\n$P(h=4) = \\frac{50400}{125970}$.\n\n- For $h=6$: $n_{AA} = (8-6)/2 = 1$, $n_{aa} = 10-(8+6)/2 = 3$.\n$N(6) = \\frac{10!}{1!6!3!} 2^6 = 840 \\times 64 = 53760$.\n$P(h=6) = \\frac{53760}{125970}$.\n\n- For $h=8$: $n_{AA} = (8-8)/2 = 0$, $n_{aa} = 10-(8+8)/2 = 2$.\n$N(8) = \\frac{10!}{0!8!2!} 2^8 = 45 \\times 256 = 11520$.\n$P(h=8) = \\frac{11520}{125970}$.\n\n(Check: $210+10080+50400+53760+11520 = 125970$.

Preference for Exact Tests over Chi-Square Tests in Medical Genetics:**\nChi-square tests for HWE are asymptotic tests, meaning their validity relies on large sample sizes. The chi-square statistic is assumed to follow a $\\chi^2$ distribution, an approximation that becomes poor when expected genotype counts are low (a common rule-of-thumb is an expected count of less than $5$). In medical genetics, particularly in studies of rare diseases or rare variants, two conditions often lead to low expected counts: small sample sizes and low allele frequencies. For a rare allele, the expected count of the rare homozygote genotype, and possibly the heterozygote, will be very small even in a moderately sized sample. In these situations, the chi-square approximation fails, and the resulting $p$-value may be inaccurate, leading to an inflated Type I error rate or reduced power. Exact tests, such as the one performed here, do not rely on asymptotic approximations. They calculate the $p$-value directly from the exact discrete conditional distribution of the data. This guarantees that the test is correctly calibrated (i.e., the Type I error rate is controlled at the nominal significance level), making them the preferred and more reliable method for HWE testing in scenarios with small samples or rare alleles, which are common in medical genetics research.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08169}$$", "id": "5032375"}]}
