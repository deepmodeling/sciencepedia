Its reliance on the central limit theorem fails badly for proportions near $0$ or $1$. The generation of a negative lower bound for $p$ demonstrates its incoherence at the boundary $p \\approx 0$. Its actual coverage probability for such parameters is known to be systematically lower than the nominal $95\\%$.\n\n*   **Wilson Interval:** This interval shows much more coherent behavior. It never produces endpoints outside $[0, 1]$ and gives a reasonable result for $k=1$. Its average coverage is close to the nominal level. However, its coverage probability is not *guaranteed* to be at least $95\\%$ for all values of $p$; it can exhibit unwelcome dips below the nominal level.\n\n*   **Clopper-Pearson Interval:** This interval is defined by its conservative but robust property: it is constructed to guarantee that the true coverage probability is *at least* the nominal $95\\%$ for every possible value of $p \\in [0, 1]$. This guarantee makes it the preferred choice in contexts where understating uncertainty (i.e., producing an interval that is too narrow and fails to contain the true parameter) is more serious than overstating it.\n\nGiven the prioritization of \"guaranteed nominal coverage,\" the **Clopper-Pearson interval** is unequivocally the most appropriate choice. It provides the necessary conservative assurance required in many medical and scientific applications, especially when dealing with rare events where statistical approximations may be unreliable.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe most appropriate interval is the Clopper-Pearson interval. The upper bound of this interval is $p_U \\approx 0.0027815$. The problem requires rounding this value to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $2, 7, 8, 1$. The following digit is $5$, so we round up the last significant digit.\n$$ p_U \\approx 0.002782 $$\nThis is the final numerical value to be reported.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.002782}\n$$", "id": "5010987"}]}
