The total sample size is $N = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa} = 130 + 60 + 10 = 200$, which is consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Goodness-of-Fit Test**\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, is that the population is not in HWE. Under $H_0$, the genotype frequencies for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are expected to be $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively, where $p$ is the frequency of allele $A$ and $q$ is the frequency of allele $a$.\n\nFirst, we estimate the allele frequencies from the observed sample data using the method of maximum likelihood. The total number of alleles in the sample is $2N = 2 \\times 200 = 400$.\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted by $\\hat{p}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2N} = \\frac{2(130) + 60}{400} = \\frac{260 + 60}{400} = \\frac{320}{400} = 0.8 $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted by $\\hat{q}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{2n_{aa} + n_{Aa}}{2N} = \\frac{2(10) + 60}{400} = \\frac{20 + 60}{400} = \\frac{80}{400} = 0.2 $$\nAs a check, we verify that $\\hat{p} + \\hat{q} = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected genotype counts under HWE using these estimated allele frequencies.\nExpected count of $AA$: $E_{AA} = N \\times \\hat{p}^2 = 200 \\times (0.8)^2 = 200 \\times 0.64 = 128$.\nExpected count of $Aa$: $E_{Aa} = N \\times 2\\hat{p}\\hat{q} = 200 \\times 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.2 = 200 \\times 0.32 = 64$.\nExpected count of $aa$: $E_{aa} = N \\times \\hat{q}^2 = 200 \\times (0.2)^2 = 200 \\times 0.04 = 8$.\nAs a check, the sum of expected counts is $128 + 64 + 8 = 200 = N$.\n\nNow, we compute the Pearson's chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) test statistic, which measures the discrepancy between observed and expected counts:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(n_{AA} - E_{AA})^2}{E_{AA}} + \\frac{(n_{Aa} - E_{Aa})^2}{E_{Aa}} + \\frac{(n_{aa} - E_{aa})^2}{E_{aa}} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(130 - 128)^2}{128} + \\frac{(60 - 64)^2}{64} + \\frac{(10 - 8)^2}{8} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{2^2}{128} + \\frac{(-4)^2}{64} + \\frac{2^2}{8} = \\frac{4}{128} + \\frac{16}{64} + \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = 0.03125 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.78125 $$\n\nThe degrees of freedom ($df$) for this test are calculated as the number of genotype categories minus $1$, minus the number of independent parameters estimated from the data. We have $3$ genotype categories ($AA$, $Aa$, $aa$) and we estimated $1$ independent parameter ($\\hat{p}$, since $\\hat{q}=1-\\hat{p}$).\n$$ df = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 $$\n\nWe compare our calculated $\\chi^2$ statistic to the critical value from the $\\chi^2$ distribution with $df=1$ at the specified significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical value is $\\chi^2_{1, 0.05} = 3.841$.\n\nSince our test statistic $\\chi^2 = 0.78125$ is less than the critical value of $3.841$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. We conclude that the observed genotype counts are not statistically significantly different from those expected under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level.\n\n**Step 2: Estimation of Carrier Frequency**\n\nBecause HWE was not rejected, we can proceed to estimate the carrier frequency as defined in the problem: the population frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) under the HWE model. This is given by the term $2pq$. Using our estimated allele frequencies $\\hat{p} = 0.8$ and $\\hat{q} = 0.2$, the estimated carrier frequency is:\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2\\hat{p}\\hat{q} = 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.2 = 0.32 $$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} = 0.3200 $$\n\n**Step 3: Explanation of the Role of $\\alpha$**\n\nThe significance level $\\alpha$ is the pre-specified probability of committing a Type I error, which is the rejection of a true null hypothesis. In the context of this problem's \"test-then-estimate\" protocol, the null hypothesis is that the population is in HWE.\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | H_0 \\text{ is true}) = 0.05$.\n\nThis means there is a $5\\%$ chance that we would conclude the population is *not* in HWE, even if it truly is, simply due to random sampling fluctuations. Following the protocol, such a conclusion would cause us to incorrectly halt the process and refuse to provide the HWE-based estimate ($2\\hat{p}\\hat{q}$). Thus, $\\alpha$ controls the probability of a \"false negative\" for the estimation step: failing to provide the HWE-based estimate when it is, in fact, the appropriate model.\n\nConversely, this testing framework is also subject to a Type II error (probability $\\beta$), which is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. In this context, it would mean we conclude the population is in HWE when it is not. This would lead to a \"false positive\" for the estimation step: we would proceed to erroneously calculate and report the carrier frequency as $2\\hat{p}\\hat{q}$ when this model is not valid for the population. The choice of $\\alpha$ represents a trade-off; a lower $\\alpha$ reduces the risk of the Type I error described above but increases the risk ($\\beta$) of a Type II error, and vice-versa.

These are standard, well-established concepts in genetics and medical genetics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary parameters ($p$, $q$, $f$) and assumptions (HWE, random mating) to derive a unique solution for the two requested quantities.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard and well-formulated question in population genetics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Quantities\n\n**1. Genotype Frequencies in the Total Population**\nUnder the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes are:\n- Frequency of homozygous wild-type ($\\mathrm{AA}$): $P(\\mathrm{AA}) = p^2$\n- Frequency of heterozygous carriers ($\\mathrm{Aa}$): $P(\\mathrm{Aa}) = 2pq$\n- Frequency of homozygous recessive ($\\mathrm{aa}$): $P(\\mathrm{aa}) = q^2$\n\nThe sum of these frequencies is $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, as expected.\n\n**2. Phenotype Frequencies in the Total Population**\nWe must determine the frequencies of clinically affected and clinically unaffected individuals.\n- Individuals with genotype $\\mathrm{AA}$ or $\\mathrm{Aa}$ are always clinically unaffected.\n- Individuals with genotype $\\mathrm{aa}$ are clinically affected with probability $f$ and clinically unaffected with probability $1-f$.\n\nThe total frequency of clinically affected individuals is the frequency of the $\\mathrm{aa}$ genotype multiplied by its penetrance:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(\\text{affected} | \\mathrm{aa}) \\times P(\\mathrm{aa}) = f \\times q^2 = fq^2$$\n\nThe frequency of clinically unaffected individuals is the sum of the frequencies of the unaffected genotypes.\n- All $\\mathrm{AA}$ individuals are unaffected: frequency $p^2$.\n- All $\\mathrm{Aa}$ individuals are unaffected: frequency $2pq$.\n- A fraction $(1-f)$ of $\\mathrm{aa}$ individuals are unaffected: frequency $(1-f)q^2$.\nSo, the total frequency of unaffected individuals is:\n$$P(\\text{unaffected}) = P(\\mathrm{AA}) + P(\\mathrm{Aa}) + (1-f)P(\\mathrm{aa})$$\n$$P(\\text{unaffected}) = p^2 + 2pq + (1-f)q^2$$\nAlternatively, since the population is partitioned into affected and unaffected individuals, we can calculate this as:\n$$P(\\text{unaffected}) = 1 - P(\\text{affected}) = 1 - fq^2$$\nThese two expressions for $P(\\text{unaffected})$ are equivalent, since $p^2 + 2pq + (1-f)q^2 = (p^2 + 2pq + q^2) - fq^2 = 1 - fq^2$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Two Required Quantities**\n\n**Quantity 1: Carrier frequency among all individuals**\nA \"carrier\" is a heterozygote ($\\mathrm{Aa}$). The frequency of carriers in the total population is simply the frequency of the $\\mathrm{Aa}$ genotype.\n$$\\text{Carrier frequency (all)} = P(\\mathrm{Aa}) = 2pq$$\n\n**Quantity 2: Carrier frequency among clinically unaffected individuals**\nThis is a conditional probability. We are seeking the probability that an individual has the genotype $\\mathrm{Aa}$ given that they are clinically unaffected.\n$$P(\\mathrm{Aa} | \\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{Aa} \\text{ and } \\text{unaffected})}{P(\\text{unaffected})}$$\n- The numerator is the frequency of individuals who are both carriers ($\\mathrm{Aa}$) and clinically unaffected. By the problem definition, all heterozygotes have $0$ penetrance, so they are all unaffected. Therefore, $P(\\mathrm{Aa} \\text{ and } \\text{unaffected}) = P(\\mathrm{Aa}) = 2pq$.\n- The denominator is the frequency of all clinically unaffected individuals in the population, which we calculated as $1 - fq^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the conditional probability formula:\n$$\\text{Carrier frequency (unaffected)} = \\frac{2pq}{1 - fq^2}$$\n\n**4. Clinical Context of the Second Quantity**\nThe second quantity, $\\frac{2pq}{1 - fq^2}$, represents the risk of being a carrier for an individual selected from the sub-population of healthy (clinically unaffected) people. This is the relevant measure for genetic counseling and screening programs that target asymptomatic individuals. For example, in preconception carrier screening, prospective parents are typically healthy adults. Their risk of being a carrier is conditioned on their healthy status. If the disease is lethal before reproductive age, or if affected individuals are institutionalized, the general adult population available for screening consists entirely of unaffected individuals. In these scenarios, the population being sampled is the \"unaffected\" sub-population, making the conditional frequency the correct one to use. Notice that since $1-fq^2 < 1$, the conditional carrier frequency $\\frac{2pq}{1-fq^2}$ is slightly greater than the overall carrier frequency $2pq$. This reflects the removal of affected individuals (who are genotype $\\mathrm{aa}$ and thus never carriers) from the denominator, which slightly enriches the proportion of carriers among the remaining individuals.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Among all individuals: $2pq$; among clinically unaffected individuals: $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - f q^2}$. The second quantity is appropriate when carrier screening is performed in samples restricted to clinically unaffected people (for example, preconception carrier screening in healthy adults or populations where clinically affected individuals are excluded or rare due to disease lethality).**\n- The expression for carrier frequency among all individuals, $2pq$, is correct.\n- The expression for carrier frequency among clinically unaffected individuals, $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - f q^2}$, is correct.\n- The described clinical context for using the second quantity is appropriate and accurately reflects its application in genetic screening of asymptomatic populations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Among all individuals: $pq$; among clinically unaffected individuals: $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - q^2}$. The second quantity is appropriate when the disease is autosomal dominant and penetrance is complete.**\n- The expression for carrier frequency among all individuals, $pq$, is incorrect. The HWE frequency of heterozygotes is $2pq$.\n- The expression for the second quantity is incorrect. The denominator $1 - q^2$ would only be correct if penetrance were complete ($f=1$). The general form is $1 - fq^2$.\n- The clinical context is incorrect. The problem is stated as autosomal recessive, not dominant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Among all individuals: $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - f q^2}$; among clinically unaffected individuals: $2pq$. The second quantity is appropriate in case–control studies when cases are oversampled.**\n- This option swaps the two quantities. The carrier frequency among all individuals is $2pq$, not $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - f q^2}$.\n- The clinical context is described confusingly. While the carrier frequency *in the control group* of a case-control study is $\\dfrac{2pq}{1 - f q^2}$, this option incorrectly states the quantity is $2pq$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Among all individuals: $2pq$; among clinically unaffected individuals: $2pq(1 - f q^2)$. The second quantity is appropriate only when penetrance is complete, $f = 1$, because partial penetrance would invalidate conditioning.**\n- The expression for carrier frequency among all individuals, $2pq$, is correct.\n- The expression for the second quantity, $2pq(1 - f q^2)$, is a product, not a conditional probability (which requires a ratio). It is dimensionally and conceptually incorrect.\n- The reasoning provided is false. Conditioning is a standard and valid probabilistic operation. Incomplete penetrance ($f<1$) not only doesn't invalidate conditioning, it is the reason the parameter $f$ is necessary in the calculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5018040"}, {"introduction": "A central task in medical genetics is to integrate population-level statistics with specific family information.

For an autosomal recessive condition, if two unaffected parents have an affected child, both parents are obligate carriers, and this conclusion does not depend on population allele frequencies.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of Mendelian genetics. An affected child with an autosomal recessive condition has genotype $aa$. This child inherited one $a$ allele from each parent. As the parents are unaffected, they cannot have the $aa$ genotype. The only genotype that allows an unaffected individual to pass on an $a$ allele is $Aa$. Therefore, both parents must be heterozygous carriers ($Aa$). This deduction relies solely on the mode of inheritance and the observed phenotypes in the family (the trio of parents and child), not on population-level data like allele frequencies.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In this population, the expected carrier frequency is approximately $1$ in $50$.**\nThe carrier frequency in the population is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype, $Aa$, which is given by $2pq$ under HWE.\nUsing the calculated allele frequencies:\n$$f(Aa) = 2pq = 2 \\times 0.99 \\times 0.01 = 0.0198$$\nThe value $0.0198$ is approximately $0.02$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{100}$ or $\\frac{1}{50}$.

This is significantly different from the population carrier frequency of approximately $1/50$.

Under the stated rare-allele assumption and no affected individuals in the grandparents’ generation, the mother’s unaffected sister has a prior probability of $1/2$ of being a carrier.**\nWe have established that the mother is a carrier ($Aa$). She must have inherited the $a$ allele from one of her parents (the maternal grandparents). This means at least one of the maternal grandparents must be a carrier. The problem states to assume \"the chance that both maternal grandparents carry the allele is negligible.\" This simplifies the scenario to one where exactly one maternal grandparent is a carrier ($Aa$) and the other is not ($AA$). The grandparents' generation had \"no known family history of the disease,\" which is consistent with one being a carrier and the other a non-carrier.\nThe cross between the maternal grandparents is therefore $Aa \\times AA$.\nThe possible genotypes for their children (the mother and her sister) are:\n- $AA$ with probability $1/2$\n- $Aa$ with probability $1/2$\nThe mother's sister is a child of this cross. Her probability of being a carrier ($Aa$) is $1/2$.

The expected carrier frequency ($2pq$) is approximately $2q$ for a rare allele, which is $2 \\times (1/100) = 2/100 = 1/50$.
