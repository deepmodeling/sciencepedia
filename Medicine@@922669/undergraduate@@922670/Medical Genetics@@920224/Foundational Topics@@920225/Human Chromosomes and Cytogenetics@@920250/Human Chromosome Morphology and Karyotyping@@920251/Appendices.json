It is scientifically grounded in the principles of human cytogenetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the centromeric index ($CI$), its numerical evaluation, and the subsequent morphological classification of the chromosome.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions. A chromosome is partitioned by its centromere into a short arm (p arm) of length $p$ and a long arm (q arm) of length $q$. The total length of the chromosome, $L$, is the sum of the lengths of these two arms.\n$$L = p + q$$\nThe centromeric index, $CI$, is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the length of the short arm to the total length of the chromosome. Based on this definition, the expression for the centromeric index is:\n$$CI = \\frac{p}{L} = \\frac{p}{p+q}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the centromeric index in terms of the measured arm lengths $p$ and $q$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n-   Short arm length, $p = 2.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   Long arm length, $q = 5.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe problem specifies that these values should be treated as exact for the calculation. Substituting these values into the formula for $CI$:\n$$CI = \\frac{2.3}{2.3 + 5.7} = \\frac{2.3}{8.0}$$\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value of the centromeric index:\n$$CI = 0.2875$$\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be expressed with four significant figures. The calculated value $0.2875$ has precisely four significant figures, so no rounding is needed.\n\nFinally, we must use this value to classify the chromosome's morphology according to the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) conventions. Chromosome morphology is categorized based on the position of the centromere, which is quantified by the centromeric index. The standard classification scheme is as follows:\n-   **Metacentric**: The centromere is located near the middle of the chromosome. The arms are of nearly equal length, corresponding to a $CI$ value in the approximate range of $[0.40, 0.50]$.\n-   **Submetacentric**: The centromere is distinctly off-center, creating arms of unequal length. This morphology corresponds to a $CI$ value in the approximate range of $[0.25, 0.40)$.\n-   **Acrocentric**: The centromere is located very near one end of the chromosome, resulting in a very short p arm. This corresponds to a $CI$ value in the approximate range of $(0, 0.25)$. Human acrocentric chromosomes include numbers $13$, $14$, $15$, $21$, and $22$.\n-   **Telocentric**: The centromere is at the terminal tip of the chromosome, meaning there is effectively no p arm ($p=0$) and thus $CI=0$. This morphology is not found in a normal human karyotype.\n\nThe calculated centromeric index for the chromosome in question is $CI = 0.2875$. We compare this value to the standard ranges:\n$$0.25 \\le 0.2875 < 0.40$$\nThe computed value falls within the defined range for a submetacentric chromosome.\n\nTo further validate this classification, one can calculate the arm ratio, $r = \\frac{q}{p}$:\n$$r = \\frac{5.7}{2.3} \\approx 2.478$$\nStandard classifications based on the arm ratio (e.g., Levan et al., 1964) are:\n-   Metacentric: $1.0 \\le r \\le 1.7$\n-   Submetacentric: $1.7 < r \\le 3.0$\n-   Acrocentric/Subtelocentric: $r > 3.0$\nSince our calculated arm ratio $r \\approx 2.478$ falls within the range for submetacentric chromosomes, this provides strong corroboration for the classification.\n\nThus, based on a rigorous application of cytogenetic definitions, the chromosome with the given arm lengths is classified as submetacentric. The specific numerical answer requested is the value of the centromeric index.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2875}$$", "id": "5048501"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing a single chromosome, cytogenetics requires a precise language to document the entire set of chromosomes, especially when abnormalities are present.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical cytogenetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively phrased using standard terminology. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived.\n\nThe task is to construct the complete International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) karyotype string for a male patient and to determine the total number of chromosomal breakpoints ($B$) based on the provided analysis.\n\nFirst, we will construct the karyotype string by systematically describing the findings according to ISCN rules. The ISCN provides a standardized format to describe a karyotype, starting with the total chromosome number, followed by the sex chromosome constitution, and then a description of any numerical or structural abnormalities.\n\n1.  **Total Chromosome Number and Sex Chromosomes:**\n    The problem states a \"normal chromosome number of $46$\" and that the specimen is from a \"male patient\".\n    - The total number of chromosomes is $46$.\n    - The sex chromosome constitution for a male is $XY$.\n    According to ISCN, these two components are written first, separated by a comma. This gives the initial part of the string: `$46,XY$`.\n\n2.  **Description of Chromosomal Abnormalities:**\n    Any abnormalities are listed after the sex chromosome constitution, separated by a comma. If multiple distinct abnormalities are present, they are also separated by commas and are conventionally ordered alphabetically based on their ISCN abbreviation. The given abnormalities are a deletion (`del`) and a translocation (`t`). Alphabetically, `del` precedes `t`.\n\n3.  **Notation for the Deletion:**\n    The problem describes a \"terminal deletion\" on the \"long arm of chromosome $7$\" with a \"breakpoint at band $q31$\".\n    - The abbreviation for deletion is `del`.\n    - The chromosome involved is specified in parentheses: `($7$)`.\n    - The breakpoint(s) are specified in a second set of parentheses. For a terminal deletion, only the single breakpoint is listed. The long arm is denoted by `q`. Thus, the breakpoint is `$q31$`.\n    - Combining these elements, the full notation for the deletion is `$del(7)(q31)$`. This notation precisely describes the loss of the chromosomal segment from band `$q31` to the terminus of the long arm of chromosome $7$.\n\n4.  **Notation for the Reciprocal Translocation:**\n    The problem describes a \"reciprocal exchange between the long arm of chromosome $9$ at sub-band $q34$ and the long arm of chromosome $22$ at sub-band $q11.2$\". This is a classic reciprocal translocation.\n    - The abbreviation for a translocation is `t`.\n    - The chromosomes involved are listed in a single set of parentheses, ordered numerically and separated by a semicolon: `($9;22$)`.\n    - The breakpoints on each chromosome are listed in a second set of parentheses, in the same order as the chromosomes, and separated by a semicolon. The breakpoint on chromosome $9$ is on the long arm (`q`) at band `$34$`, written as `$q34$`. The breakpoint on chromosome $22$ is on the long arm (`q`) at band `$11.2$`, written as `$q11.2$`. This gives `($q34;q11.2$)`.\n    - Combining these elements, the full notation for the translocation is `$t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)$`. This translocation is clinically significant and is known as the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Complete Karyotype String:**\n    We combine the components in the correct order: (chromosome count, sex chromosomes, alphabetically ordered abnormalities).\n    - Start with `$46,XY$`.\n    - Add the deletion: `$del(7)(q31)$`.\n    - Add the translocation: `$t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)$`.\n    The complete and correct ISCN string is: `$46,XY,del(7)(q31),t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)$`.\n\nNext, we must determine $B$, the total number of distinct chromosomal breakpoints. A breakpoint is defined as a physical cleavage of a chromosome that precedes rearrangement.\n\n-   **Breakpoints from the Reciprocal Translocation:** A reciprocal translocation, by definition, involves the exchange of segments between two non-homologous chromosomes. This requires a single break on each of the participating chromosomes.\n    -   One break occurs on chromosome $9$ at location `$q34$`.\n    -   One break occurs on chromosome $22$ at location `$q11.2$`.\n    -   Therefore, the translocation event accounts for $2$ breakpoints.\n\n-   **Breakpoints from the Terminal Deletion:** A terminal deletion involves a single break on a chromosome, resulting in the loss of the acentric fragment (the segment distal to the break).\n    -   One break occurs on chromosome $7$ at location `$q31$`.\n    -   Therefore, the deletion event accounts for $1$ breakpoint.\n\n-   **Total Number of Breakpoints ($B$):** The total number of breakpoints is the sum of the breakpoints from each independent cytogenetic event.\n    $$B = (\\text{breakpoints from translocation}) + (\\text{breakpoints from deletion})$$\n    $$B = 2 + 1 = 3$$\nThe analysis implies a total of $3$ distinct chromosomal breaks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "5048544"}, {"introduction": "A karyotype is not just a static snapshot; it holds predictive power for future generations.

She conceives with a cytogenetically normal male partner ($46,XY$). Assume the following foundational facts and constraints:\n- In meiosis I of a Robertsonian translocation carrier, chromosomes $14$, $21$, and the derivative der(14;21) form a trivalent. Under the random segregation assumption, each of the distinct gametic chromosomal complements generated by this trivalent is equally likely, and there is no pre- or post-zygotic selection other than the viability constraints stated below.\n- After fertilization by a cytogenetically normal sperm, the $6$ possible zygotic outcomes from the carrier’s six distinct gametic complements are: karyotypically normal, balanced carrier, trisomy $21$, monosomy $21$, trisomy $14$, and monosomy $14$.\n- Widely accepted clinical facts: autosomal monosomies (e.g., monosomy $14$, monosomy $21$) and trisomy $14$ are embryonically lethal, while trisomy $21$ (Down syndrome) can survive to term; a balanced carrier and a karyotypically normal conceptus are viable.\n\nStarting strictly from these facts and the rules of Mendelian segregation in meiosis, derive the theoretical probability that a liveborn child from this couple will have trisomy $21$ under the random segregation assumption described above, i.e., compute the conditional probability of trisomy $21$ given live birth when all six meiotic products are equally likely at conception and the only selection is the stated viability at term.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of human cytogenetics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient constraints, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nThe objective is to compute the theoretical probability that a liveborn child of a specific couple will have trisomy $21$. This is a conditional probability problem. The couple consists of a female who is a balanced carrier of a Robertsonian translocation, with karyotype 45,XX,der(14;21), and a cytogenetically normal male with karyotype $46,XY$.\n\nFirst, we must understand the genetic contribution of each parent. The normal male produces gametes (sperm) that are all cytogenetically normal, each containing one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$.\n\nThe female carrier's meiosis is more complex. Her relevant chromosomes are one normal chromosome $14$, one normal chromosome $21$, and the derivative chromosome, der(14;21). The problem states that during meiosis, these form a trivalent, and segregation leads to $6$ distinct and equally likely gametic complements (ova) with respect to chromosomes $14$ and $21$. Let's denote the event of producing the $i$-th gamete as $G_i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The assumption of equal likelihood means the probability of any specific gamete is:\n$$P(G_i) = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nUpon fertilization by a normal sperm (containing one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$), these $6$ gametes result in $6$ distinct zygotic outcomes. The problem lists these outcomes, which we can map to the specific gametes:\n1.  **Normal Gamete** $\\{14, 21\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Normal Zygote** $\\{14, 14, 21, 21\\}$.\n2.  **Balanced Gamete** $\\{der(14;21)\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Balanced Carrier Zygote** $\\{14, 21, der(14;21)\\}$.\n3.  **Unbalanced Gamete** $\\{21, der(14;21)\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Trisomy $21$ Zygote**. The zygote has one chromosome $14$, two normal chromosomes $21$, and the der(14;21), which also carries most of chromosome $21$.\n4.  **Unbalanced Gamete** $\\{14\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Monosomy $21$ Zygote**. The zygote has two chromosomes $14$ but only one chromosome $21$.\n5.  **Unbalanced Gamete** $\\{14, der(14;21)\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Trisomy $14$ Zygote**. The zygote has two normal chromosomes $14$, one chromosome $21$, and the der(14;21), which carries most of chromosome $14$.\n6.  **Unbalanced Gamete** $\\{21\\}$ + Normal Sperm $\\{14, 21\\} \\rightarrow$ **Monosomy $14$ Zygote**. The zygote has one chromosome $14$ and two chromosomes $21$.\n\nSince each gamete is equally likely, each of these $6$ zygotic outcomes at conception is also equally likely, with a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nNext, we apply the viability constraints given in the problem. Let $L$ be the event of a live birth. A live birth only occurs if the zygote is viable.\nThe viable outcomes are:\n-   Normal Zygote\n-   Balanced Carrier Zygote\n-   Trisomy $21$ Zygote\n\nThe non-viable (lethal) outcomes are:\n-   Monosomy $21$ Zygote\n-   Trisomy $14$ Zygote\n-   Monosomy $14$ Zygote\n\nThere are $3$ viable outcomes out of $6$ initial possibilities. The total probability of a live birth, $P(L)$, is the sum of the probabilities of the viable outcomes:\n$$P(L) = P(\\text{Normal}) + P(\\text{Balanced Carrier}) + P(\\text{Trisomy } 21)$$\n$$P(L) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of a liveborn child having trisomy $21$. This is the conditional probability $P(\\text{Trisomy } 21 | L)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(\\text{Trisomy } 21 | L) = \\frac{P(\\text{Trisomy } 21 \\cap L)}{P(L)}$$\nThe event \"Trisomy $21$ and Live Birth\" ($\\text{Trisomy } 21 \\cap L$) is simply the event \"Trisomy $21$\", because Trisomy $21$ is stated to be a viable outcome. Therefore, $P(\\text{Trisomy } 21 \\cap L) = P(\\text{Trisomy } 21)$.\nThe initial probability of a Trisomy $21$ zygote at conception is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n$$P(\\text{Trisomy } 21) = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nSubstituting the probabilities into the conditional probability formula:\n$$P(\\text{Trisomy } 21 | L) = \\frac{1/6}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe theoretical probability is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$. To express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333333...$$\nRounding gives $0.3333$.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question: Empirically observed risks for a liveborn child with Down syndrome from a female der(14;21) carrier are typically in the range of $10\\%-15\\%$, which is significantly lower than the theoretical risk of $\\frac{1}{3}$ (approximately $33.3\\%$). This discrepancy arises primarily because the model's assumption of random segregation is an oversimplification; biological mechanisms may favor the formation of normal or balanced gametes, and there is a higher rate of spontaneous abortion for aneuploid conceptuses (including trisomy $21$) than for balanced ones, much of which occurs very early in gestation and may go undetected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3333}$$", "id": "5048488"}]}
