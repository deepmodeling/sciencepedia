In the remaining fraction $1 - p$ of meioses this autosome forms a normal bivalent. A univalent configuration means the two homologous chromosomes do not pair and each homolog behaves independently at the first meiotic division. Under the assumption of random segregation of univalents at the first meiotic division, and regular separation of sister chromatids at the second meiotic division, each univalent homolog has an equal probability of migrating to either pole, and the two homologs have an equal probability of migrating to the same pole or to opposite poles. Assume that:\n- in bivalent meioses for this chromosome, separation is regular at both divisions, so each gamete produced carries exactly one copy of the chromosome;\n- in univalent meioses for this chromosome, there is no post-meiotic selection and gametes produced from a given meiosis are equally represented;\n- all other chromosomes segregate normally and do not affect the calculation for this chromosome.\n\nLet $p = 0.20$. Using the definitions above and first principles of meiotic division, derive from scratch the expected fractions of gametes that are:\n- normal for this chromosome (carry exactly one copy),\n- disomic for this chromosome (carry two copies, which would produce a trisomic zygote upon fertilization by a normal haploid gamete),\n- nullisomic for this chromosome (carry zero copies, which would produce a monosomic zygote upon fertilization by a normal haploid gamete).\n\nExpress each fraction as a decimal number without a percentage sign.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of meiotic cell division and genetics, specifically modeling achiasmate nondisjunction. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary conditions and parameters defined, allowing for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the expected fractions of normal (haploid, $n$), disomic (aneuploid, $n+1$), and nullisomic (aneuploid, $n-1$) gametes for a specific autosome, given that it fails to form a bivalent in a fraction $p$ of meioses. The total fraction of any gamete type is the weighted average of the outcomes from the two classes of meiosis: normal bivalent meiosis and problematic univalent meiosis.\n\nThe fraction of meioses where the chromosome forms a normal bivalent is $1 - p$.\nThe fraction of meioses where the chromosome exists as two univalents is $p$.\n\nLet $F_{normal}$, $F_{disomic}$, and $F_{nullisomic}$ represent the final fractions of normal, disomic, and nullisomic gametes, respectively. We can express these fractions as:\n$$ F_{\\text{type}} = (\\text{Fraction from bivalent meiosis}) \\times (1 - p) + (\\text{Fraction from univalent meiosis}) \\times p $$\n\nFirst, we analyze the outcome of normal bivalent meiosis, which occurs with probability $1 - p$.\nThe problem states that in these cases, segregation is regular, and \"each gamete produced carries exactly one copy of the chromosome\". Therefore, $100\\%$ of gametes resulting from this pathway are normal.\nThe contribution to the final gamete pool from this pathway is:\n- For normal gametes: $1 \\times (1 - p)$\n- For disomic gametes: $0 \\times (1 - p)$\n- For nullisomic gametes: $0 \\times (1 - p)$\n\nSecond, we analyze the outcome of univalent meiosis, which occurs with probability $p$.\nIn this scenario, the two homologous chromosomes, let's call them $H_1$ and $H_2$, are univalents and segregate independently and randomly during Meiosis I. Each homolog is composed of two sister chromatids.\n\nAt Meiosis I, for each homolog, there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of it migrating to one pole and $\\frac{1}{2}$ to the other. There are four equally likely outcomes for the segregation of the two independent univalents:\n1.  Both $H_1$ and $H_2$ migrate to Pole A. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  Both $H_1$ and $H_2$ migrate to Pole B. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  $H_1$ migrates to Pole A and $H_2$ migrates to Pole B. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  $H_1$ migrates to Pole B and $H_2$ migrates to Pole A. This happens with probability $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThese outcomes can be grouped into two main cases for the products of Meiosis I:\n- **Case 1: Meiosis I Nondisjunction.** Both homologous chromosomes migrate to the same pole. This corresponds to outcomes 1 and 2, so the total probability is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This meiotic division produces one secondary meiocyte that is diploid for this chromosome (containing both $H_1$ and $H_2$) and one secondary meiocyte that is nullisomic for this chromosome.\n- **Case 2: Proper Meiosis I Segregation.** The homologous chromosomes migrate to opposite poles. This corresponds to outcomes 3 and 4, so the total probability is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This meiotic division produces two secondary meiocytes, each of which is haploid for this chromosome (one containing $H_1$, the other containing $H_2$).\n\nNow, we consider Meiosis II, which is stated to have regular separation of sister chromatids.\n- In Case 1 (Meiosis I nondisjunction):\n    - The diploid secondary meiocyte undergoes Meiosis II. Regular separation of sister chromatids results in two **disomic** ($n+1$) gametes.\n    - The nullisomic secondary meiocyte undergoes Meiosis II. It produces two **nullisomic** ($n-1$) gametes.\n    - Therefore, a single meiotic event of this type produces 2 disomic and 2 nullisomic gametes, so the fraction of gametes are $\\frac{1}{2}$ disomic and $\\frac{1}{2}$ nullisomic.\n- In Case 2 (Proper Meiosis I segregation):\n    - Both haploid secondary meiocytes undergo Meiosis II. Regular separation of sister chromatids in each cell results in two **normal** ($n$) gametes from each.\n    - Therefore, a single meiotic event of this type produces 4 normal gametes, so the fraction of gametes is $1$ normal.\n\nTo find the average fractions of gamete types from the entire set of univalent meioses, we weight the outcomes by their probabilities:\n- Fraction of normal gametes: $(\\frac{1}{2}_{\\text{prob of case 2}}) \\times (1_{\\text{outcome of case 2}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Fraction of disomic gametes: $(\\frac{1}{2}_{\\text{prob of case 1}}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}_{\\text{outcome of case 1}}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- Fraction of nullisomic gametes: $(\\frac{1}{2}_{\\text{prob of case 1}}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}_{\\text{outcome of case 1}}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\nAs a check, $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nNow, we combine the contributions from both bivalent and univalent meiosis pathways to find the total fractions.\n- $F_{normal} = (1 \\times (1 - p)) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times p) = 1 - p + \\frac{p}{2} = 1 - \\frac{p}{2}$\n- $F_{disomic} = (0 \\times (1 - p)) + (\\frac{1}{4} \\times p) = \\frac{p}{4}$\n- $F_{nullisomic} = (0 \\times (1 - p)) + (\\frac{1}{4} \\times p) = \\frac{p}{4}$\n\nThe problem provides the value $p = 0.20$. We substitute this value into the derived expressions:\n- $F_{normal} = 1 - \\frac{0.20}{2} = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n- $F_{disomic} = \\frac{0.20}{4} = 0.05$\n- $F_{nullisomic} = \\frac{0.20}{4} = 0.05$\n\nThe question asks for the final answer as a single row matrix in the order: normal, trisomy-producing (disomic), and monosomy-producing (nullisomic) gametes.

The conclusion is logically derived from the data and verifiable principles of genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe goal is to determine the parental origin and meiotic mechanism of the trisomy $18$ event. This requires a systematic analysis of the STR marker data.\n\n**1. Determination of Parental Origin of Nondisjunction**\n\nThe presence of three alleles for a given chromosome indicates a trisomy. The parental origin of the extra chromosome can be determined by comparing the fetal alleles to the parental genotypes.\n\n*   **Marker $M_{1}$:** The father is homozygous ($210/210$) and the mother is heterozygous ($198/206$). The fetus shows peaks for alleles $206$ and $210$. The $210$ allele must have been inherited from the father. The $206$ allele must have been inherited from the mother. The peak area ratio is approximately $2:1$ for $206:210$, indicating the fetus has two copies of the $206$ allele and one copy of the $210$ allele. Therefore, the fetus inherited two chromosomes from the mother and one from the father. The nondisjunction event is **maternal**.\n*   **Marker $M_{2}$:** The father is homozygous ($190/190$), the mother is heterozygous ($178/186$). The fetus has alleles $178$ and $190$. The ratio is $2:1$ ($178:190$), meaning two copies of the maternal $178$ allele and one copy of the paternal $190$ allele. This independently confirms a **maternal** origin.\n*   **Marker $M_{3}$:** The father is homozygous ($216/216$), the mother is heterozygous ($224/232$). The fetus has three alleles ($216, 224, 232$) with a $1:1:1$ ratio. This means one copy of the paternal $216$ allele, one copy of the maternal $224$ allele, and one copy of the maternal $232$ allele. This also confirms a **maternal** origin.\n\n**2. Determination of the Meiotic Stage of Nondisjunction**\n\nThe stage of meiotic error (Meiosis I vs. Meiosis II) is determined by the pattern of heterozygosity of the inherited maternal chromosomes.\n\n*   **Principle of Meiosis I Nondisjunction (NDJ-I):** In NDJ-I, homologous chromosomes fail to separate. A disomic gamete resulting from this event inherits both homologous centromeres from the mother. Consequently, for any marker close to the centromere for which the mother is heterozygous, the gamete will also be heterozygous.\n*   **Principle of Meiosis II Nondisjunction (NDJ-II):** In NDJ-II, sister chromatids fail to separate. If no crossover has occurred between the centromere and a heterozygous marker, the sister chromatids are identical. A disomic gamete from NDJ-II would inherit two identical chromosomes, resulting in **homozygosity** for that marker. If a crossover has occurred between the centromere and the marker, the sister chromatids become non-identical, and an NDJ-II event would result in **heterozygosity** for that marker.\n\n**3. Application to Fetal Genotype**\n\nLet's analyze the maternal alleles in the fetus:\n*   **Marker $M_{1}$ (pericentromeric):** The maternal contribution is two $206$ alleles. This is **homozygosity**. According to the principles above, homozygosity at a pericentromeric marker is the definitive sign of a **Meiosis II nondisjunction**. An NDJ-I event would have resulted in inheriting both the $198$ and $206$ alleles, which is contrary to the observation.\n*   **Marker $M_{2}$ (interstitial):** The maternal contribution is two $178$ alleles. This is also **homozygosity**. This is consistent with an NDJ-II event.\n*   **Marker $M_{3}$ (telomeric):** The maternal contribution is one $224$ allele and one $232$ allele. This is **heterozygosity**.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Explanation of the Crossover Event**\n\nWe have established a maternal NDJ-II. We must now explain the switch from homozygosity at the proximal markers ($M_{1}, M_{2}$) to heterozygosity at the distal marker ($M_{3}$).\n\n*   A crossover during Meiosis I between non-sister chromatids creates recombinant chromatids.\n*   Consider the maternal homologous chromosomes: one carries the haplotype $(198)-(186)-(224)$ and the other carries $(206)-(178)-(232)$.\n*   For a maternal NDJ-II to occur, Meiosis I must complete successfully. For the resulting sister chromatids to be heterozygous for $M_3$, a crossover must have occurred proximal to $M_3$.\n*   Let's model a crossover between markers $M_{2}$ and $M_{3}$.\n    1.  During Prophase I, a crossover occurs between the non-sister chromatids of the bivalent.\n    2.  In Meiosis I, homologous centromeres separate correctly. One secondary oocyte receives the two chromatids attached to one centromere. Because of the crossover, these two \"sister\" chromatids are no longer identical.\n    3.  Let's trace the chromatids derived from the homolog that carried the $(206)-(178)-(232)$ haplotype. After the crossover, the two chromatids attached to its centromere will be:\n        *   One recombinant chromatid: $(206)-(178)-(224)$\n        *   One non-recombinant chromatid: $(206)-(178)-(232)$\n    4.  In Meiosis II, these two non-identical sister chromatids fail to separate (NDJ-II).\n    5.  The resulting disomic gamete contains both of these chromatids.\n    6.  The genetic content of this gamete is:\n        *   At $M_{1}$, two copies of allele $206$. (Homozygous)\n        *   At $M_{2}$, two copies of allele $178$. (Homozygous)\n        *   At $M_{3}$, one copy of allele $224$ and one copy of allele $232$. (Heterozygous)\n    7.  This perfectly matches the fetal data (after adding the single paternal chromosome). The fetal genotype is therefore $(206, 206, 210)$ for $M_{1}$, $(178, 178, 190)$ for $M_{2}$, and $(224, 232, 216)$ for $M_{3}$. The peak ratios ($2:1$, $2:1$, and $1:1:1$, respectively) are fully explained.\n\nThe only mechanism consistent with all data points is a maternal meiosis II nondisjunction with a required single crossover event between marker $M_{2}$ and marker $M_{3}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Maternal meiosis I nondisjunction with at least one crossover between the centromere and $M_{3}$.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. A maternal meiosis I nondisjunction would result in the fetus inheriting both maternal homologous centromeres. This would lead to heterozygosity for the pericentromeric marker $M_{1}$ (i.e., fetal alleles $198/206/210$). The data clearly show homozygosity for the maternal allele at $M_1$ ($206/206$), ruling out NDJ-I.\n\n*   **B. Maternal meiosis II nondisjunction with a single crossover between $M_{2}$ and $M_{3}$.**\n    This is **Correct**. As derived above, this mechanism perfectly explains the observed data: (1) The origin is maternal. (2) The NDJ is in meiosis II, as shown by homozygosity at the proximal markers $M_1$ and $M_2$. (3) The crossover between $M_2$ and $M_3$ explains the switch to heterozygosity at the distal marker $M_3$.\n\n*   **C. Paternal meiosis II nondisjunction without recombination.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. All three markers are informative and unequivocally point to a maternal origin for the nondisjunction event. Paternal origin is definitively ruled out.\n\n*   **D. Postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction resulting in uniform duplication of one parental homolog across chromosome $18$.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. A postzygotic duplication of one entire parental chromosome would result in a consistent dosage pattern across all markers (either $2:1$ or $1:2$ for all heterozygous loci). It cannot explain the switch from homozygosity ($2:1$ dosage for maternal alleles) at proximal markers to heterozygosity ($1:1:1$ overall dosage) at a distal marker. This specific pattern is a hallmark of a meiotic error involving recombination.\n\n*   **E. The data are uninformative due to null alleles at $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. First, the problem explicitly states to assume no null alleles. Second, the data are not uninformative; they are highly informative and internally consistent, allowing for a precise deduction of the meiotic error.
