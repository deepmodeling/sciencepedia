Your task is to decide the most accurate statement about the likelihood of visualizing this deletion and select the best justification.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts and definitions to reason your answer:\n- In chromosome ideogram nomenclature, `22q11.2` denotes the long arm ($q$) of chromosome $22$, region $1$, band $1$, sub-band $2$. Sub-bands become resolvable only at higher cytogenetic resolution.\n- At a stated resolution of $550$ bands, the haploid human complement is segmented into approximately $550$ discernible G-bands across all $24$ chromosomes (chromosomes $1$–$22$ plus $X$ and $Y$), with band sizes varying by region and compaction state.\n- The human haploid genome comprises approximately $3.2\\times 10^9$ base pairs. One megabase (Mb) equals $10^6$ base pairs.\n- Morphological detection of a structural imbalance on a G-banded metaphase karyotype generally requires a size change on the order of the width of a visible band at the working resolution, recognizing regional variability.\n\nWhich option best reflects whether a 2.5 Mb deletion at `22q11.2` is likely to be visible at $550$-band resolution, and why?\n\nA. Yes; a 2.5 Mb deletion at `22q11.2` is likely visible at $550$ bands because each band averages approximately 2 Mb at this resolution, so the deletion spans more than one band.\n\nB. No; it is unlikely to be visible on a routine $550$-band G-banded karyotype because the average discernible band size at this resolution is on the order of $5$–$10$ Mb, making 2.5 Mb below the morphological detection threshold. Detection would require Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA).\n\nC. Yes, but only if it lies within a light (euchromatic) band; light bands are sufficiently expanded at $550$ bands that deletions as small as $1$–$3$ Mb are routinely visible.\n\nD.

The association between the clinical phenotype and the genetic locus is classic for DiGeorge syndrome/Velocardiofacial syndrome. The concepts of G-banding, karyotype resolution, genome size, and detection thresholds are standard in the field.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks a specific question that can be answered by applying the provided information to derive a quantitative estimate and compare it with established cytogenetic principles.\n-   **Objective**: The language is clear, precise, and objective. It relies on defined technical terms and quantitative data.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides sufficient data to perform the necessary calculation (genome size and band number) to estimate the average band size. There are no internal contradictions. The provided facts are consistent with established knowledge in genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically and logically sound question representative of a common issue in genetic diagnostics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to determine if a deletion of size 2.5 Mb is likely to be detected by a karyotype analysis at $550$-band resolution. According to the problem's stated principle, detection requires the deletion size to be \"on the order of the width of a visible band.\" Therefore, we must first estimate the average size of a single band at this resolution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the average DNA content per band:**\n    The human haploid genome size is given as $3.2\\times 10^9$ base pairs.\n    The karyotype resolution is given as $550$ bands for the haploid genome.\n    Average size per band = $\\frac{\\text{Total haploid genome size}}{\\text{Number of bands}}$\n    $$ \\text{Average size} = \\frac{3.2\\times 10^9\\ \\text{base pairs}}{550\\ \\text{bands}} \\approx 5.818 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{base pairs/band} $$\n    Since $1\\ \\text{Mb} = 10^6$ base pairs, the average band size is approximately 5.8 Mb.\n\n2.  **Compare the deletion size to the detection threshold:**\n    The deletion in question is 2.5 Mb in size.\n    The calculated average band size is ~5.8 Mb. It is generally accepted in cytogenetics that the lower limit of detection for standard G-banding ($400$–$550$ bands) is in the range of $5$–$10$ Mb. This range accounts for the fact that bands are not uniform in size; some are larger and some are smaller than the average.\n    The 2.5 Mb deletion is significantly smaller than the average band size (5.8 Mb) and falls well below the commonly cited morphological detection threshold of $5$–$10$ Mb.\n\n3.  **Conclusion based on principles:**\n    A deletion of 2.5 Mb would constitute a loss of less than half of an average-sized band at this resolution. Such a small change is highly unlikely to be reliably visualized as a discernible change in banding pattern or chromosome length using conventional light microscopy. The term \"microdeletion,\" often used for the pathogenic deletion at `22q11.2`, was specifically coined to describe deletions that are too small to be seen on a routine karyotype. Therefore, a $550$-band karyotype would not be expected to show this deletion. For such microdeletions, more sensitive molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) targeting the specific `22q11.2` region or a genome-wide Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA), are the standard diagnostic methods.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Yes; a 2.5 Mb deletion at `22q11.2` is likely visible at $550$ bands because each band averages approximately 2 Mb at this resolution, so the deletion spans more than one band.**\nThis option contains a faulty premise. The calculation that each band averages approximately 2 Mb is incorrect. As calculated above, the average is closer to 5.8 Mb. Consequently, the conclusion that the deletion is visible is based on this erroneous calculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. No; it is unlikely to be visible on a routine $550$-band G-banded karyotype because the average discernible band size at this resolution is on the order of $5$–$10$ Mb, making 2.5 Mb below the morphological detection threshold. Detection would require Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA).**\nThis option correctly concludes that the deletion is unlikely to be visible. The justification provided is entirely consistent with our derivation and established cytogenetic principles. The stated range for the average band size ($5$–$10$ Mb) correctly encompasses our calculated average of ~5.8 Mb and reflects the practical detection limit of the technique. The statement correctly identifies the deletion size of 2.5 Mb as being below this threshold. Finally, it accurately names the appropriate higher-resolution technologies (FISH and CMA) required for detection.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Yes, but only if it lies within a light (euchromatic) band; light bands are sufficiently expanded at $550$ bands that deletions as small as $1$–$3$ Mb are routinely visible.**\nThis option claims that deletions as small as $1$–$3$ Mb are \"routinely visible\" in euchromatic regions at $550$-band resolution. This is a significant overstatement. While G-negative (light) bands are less condensed than G-positive (dark) bands, a 2.5 Mb deletion is still at or below the practical limit of detection for even a skilled cytogeneticist under ideal conditions. It is certainly not \"routinely visible.\" The standard of care would not rely on G-banding for this diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. It depends entirely on chromosome size; deletions on smaller chromosomes like $22$ are always visible at $550$ bands because they occupy a larger fraction of total chromosomal length.**\nThe reasoning here is flawed. The visibility of a deletion depends on its absolute size relative to the width of the chromosomal band it affects, not its size relative to the total length of the chromosome. A 2.5 Mb segment is the same absolute amount of DNA whether on chromosome $1$ or chromosome $22$. The G-banding technique provides the \"ruler\" for measurement, and at $550$-band resolution, this ruler is too coarse to measure a 2.5 Mb difference reliably, irrespective of the chromosome. The assertion that they are \"always visible\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. It would not be visible at $550$ bands but would be reliably visible at $850$-band prometaphase G-banding without targeted probes, since 2.5 Mb exceeds the high-resolution band width.**\nThis option correctly states the deletion would not be visible at $550$ bands. However, it then claims \"reliable\" visibility at $850$-band resolution. Let's calculate the average band size at this higher resolution:\n$$ \\text{Average size} = \\frac{3.2\\times 10^9\\ \\text{base pairs}}{850\\ \\text{bands}} \\approx 3.76 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{base pairs/band} \\approx 3.8\\ \\text{Mb} $$\nAt $850$-band resolution, the average band size is ~3.8 Mb. The deletion size of 2.5 Mb is still smaller than this average. While detection becomes more plausible at this resolution, it is far from \"reliably visible.\" The diagnosis would still be challenging and not the standard of care. Molecular methods (FISH/CMA) remain superior in reliability. The claim of reliable visibility is an overstatement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5020793"}, {"introduction": "Once a chromosomal abnormality is large enough to be detected, it must be described using a precise and universal language.

The use of a linear coordinate model to approximate chromosome structure is a valid simplification for quantitative analysis.

The location of the proximal breakpoint in a more proximal band (`5p15.2`) than the distal breakpoint (`5p15.3`) is consistent with the definition of an interstitial deletion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks given in the problem statement.\n\n#### Part 1: ISCN Nomenclature for the Deletion\n\nThe first task is to determine the correct ISCN string for the described interstitial deletion. This requires applying the provided ISCN rules.\n\n1.  **Identify Chromosome and Arm:** The deletion is on chromosome $5$, on the short arm, denoted by $p$.\n2.  **Determine Proximal and Distal Breakpoints:**\n    - The problem states the deletion is between sub-bands `5p15.2` and `5p15.3`. Specifically, the proximal breakpoint is within `5p15.2` and the distal breakpoint is within `5p15.3`.\n    - According to ISCN Rule 2, band numbering increases with distance from the centromere. According to ISCN Rule 3, for sub-bands, the suffix also increases with distance from the centromere.\n    - Therefore, the order of bands from the centromere outwards is: centromere $\\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow 5\\mathrm{p}15.1 \\rightarrow 5\\mathrm{p}15.2 \\rightarrow 5\\mathrm{p}15.3 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow$ telomere.\n    - This establishes that band `5p15.2` is proximal to band `5p15.3`.\n3.  **Construct the ISCN String:**\n    - ISCN Rule 4 specifies the format for an interstitial deletion as $\\mathrm{del}(n)(\\text{breakpoint}_1\\ \\text{breakpoint}_2)$, where $n$ is the chromosome number, $\\text{breakpoint}_1$ is the proximal breakpoint, and $\\text{breakpoint}_2$ is the distal breakpoint.\n    - For this case, $n=5$. The band containing the proximal breakpoint is `p15.2`. The band containing the distal breakpoint is `p15.3`.\n    - In ISCN, when a break occurs within a band, the entire band is named as the breakpoint.\n    - Following the rule to list the proximal breakpoint first, we have breakpoint 1 = `p15.2` and breakpoint 2 = `p15.3`.\n    - Assembling these components results in the final ISCN string.\n\n**Justification:** The order of breakpoints is `p15.2` followed by `p15.3` because the ISCN mandates that for an interstitial deletion, the breakpoint closer to the centromere (proximal) must be written first. Based on the provided rules for band and sub-band numbering, `5p15.2` is proximal to `5p15.3`. Thus, the correct ISCN string is `del(5)(p15.2 p15.3)`.\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation of the Deletion Size\n\nThe second task is to compute the physical size, $S$, of the deleted segment in megabases (Mb). This requires calculating the genomic coordinates of the proximal and distal breakpoints.\n\nLet $x_p$ be the coordinate of the proximal breakpoint and $x_d$ be the coordinate of the distal breakpoint. The size of the deletion is $S = x_d - x_p$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Proximal Breakpoint Coordinate ($x_p$):**\n    - The proximal breakpoint is in band `5p15.2`, which spans the interval $[38.5, 42.0]$ Mb.\n    - The proximal boundary of this band is $x_{15.2, \\text{prox}} = 38.5$ Mb.\n    - The distal boundary of this band is $x_{15.2, \\text{dist}} = 42.0$ Mb.\n    - The width of this band is $W_{15.2} = x_{15.2, \\text{dist}} - x_{15.2, \\text{prox}} = 42.0 - 38.5 = 3.5$ Mb.\n    - The breakpoint is at a fractional position $f_p = 0.40$ from the proximal boundary.\n    - The coordinate is calculated as:\n    $$x_p = x_{15.2, \\text{prox}} + f_p \\times W_{15.2}$$\n    $$x_p = 38.5 + 0.40 \\times (42.0 - 38.5) = 38.5 + 0.40 \\times 3.5 = 38.5 + 1.4 = 39.9\\ \\text{Mb}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Distal Breakpoint Coordinate ($x_d$):**\n    - The distal breakpoint is in band `5p15.3`, which spans the interval $[42.0, 50.0]$ Mb.\n    - The proximal boundary of this band is $x_{15.3, \\text{prox}} = 42.0$ Mb.\n    - The distal boundary of this band is $x_{15.3, \\text{dist}} = 50.0$ Mb.\n    - The width of this band is $W_{15.3} = x_{15.3, \\text{dist}} - x_{15.3, \\text{prox}} = 50.0 - 42.0 = 8.0$ Mb.\n    - The breakpoint is at a fractional position $f_d = 0.85$ from the proximal boundary.\n    - The coordinate is calculated as:\n    $$x_d = x_{15.3, \\text{prox}} + f_d \\times W_{15.3}$$\n    $$x_d = 42.0 + 0.85 \\times (50.0 - 42.0) = 42.0 + 0.85 \\times 8.0 = 42.0 + 6.8 = 48.8\\ \\text{Mb}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Deletion Size ($S$):**\n    - The size of the deleted segment is the difference between the distal and proximal breakpoint coordinates.\n    $$S = x_d - x_p = 48.8 - 39.9 = 8.9\\ \\text{Mb}$$\n\n4.  **Final Formatting:**\n    - The problem requires the final answer for $S$ to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $8.9$. To express this with four significant figures, we append two zeros.\n    $$S = 8.900\\ \\text{Mb}$$\nThis fulfills the requirements of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.900}$$", "id": "5020731"}, {"introduction": "Modern genetics integrates data from DNA sequencing with classical cytogenetic maps.

The formula for this linear normalization is:\n$$P_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{x - s}{e - s}$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n- SNP coordinate: $x = 41,200,000$\n- Sub-band start: $s = 40,500,000$\n- Sub-band end: $e = 43,000,000$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$P_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{41,200,000 - 40,500,000}{43,000,000 - 40,500,000}$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the denominator:\n- Numerator: $x - s = 41,200,000 - 40,500,000 = 700,000$\n- Denominator: $e - s = 43,000,000 - 40,500,000 = 2,500,000$\n\nNow, we compute the fraction:\n$$P_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{700,000}{2,500,000} = \\frac{7}{25}$$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$P_{\\text{norm}} = 0.28$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a single dimensionless decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.28$ has two significant figures. To express it with four significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros.\n$$P_{\\text{norm}} = 0.2800$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2800}$$", "id": "5020808"}]}
