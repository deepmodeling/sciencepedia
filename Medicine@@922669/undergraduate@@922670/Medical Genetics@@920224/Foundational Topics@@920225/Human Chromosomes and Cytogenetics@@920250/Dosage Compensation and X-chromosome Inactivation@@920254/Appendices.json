The problem states that the *SHOX* gene is in a pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and that PAR genes are expressed from every sex chromosome (X and Y) that carries them. This implies that the number of active *SHOX* gene copies, $n$, is equal to the total number of sex chromosomes in the individual's karyotype.\n\nFor an individual with karyotype $47,\\mathrm{XXY}$ (Klinefelter syndrome), there are three sex chromosomes: two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the probability that the autosome $A^{\\ast}$ undergoes ectopic autosomal silencing. According to the problem statement, silencing of a chromosome is a direct consequence of the *Xist* RNA being transcribed from the Xic on that same chromosome and spreading in cis. This is stipulated to occur with a probability of $1$ once an Xic is chosen. Therefore, the event \"autosome $A^{\\ast}$ undergoes silencing\" is equivalent to the event \"the Xic on autosome $A^{\\ast}$ is chosen by the counting-and-choice mechanism to upregulate *Xist*\".\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible outcomes for the selection made by the counting-and-choice mechanism. The problem states that there are $3$ Xist-competent loci available for selection: the one on chromosome $X_1$, the one on chromosome $X_2$, and the one on autosome $A^{\\ast}$. The mechanism selects exactly one of these loci. Thus, the sample space of possible choices is:\n$$S = \\{ \\text{choose } X_1, \\text{choose } X_2, \\text{choose } A^{\\ast} \\}$$\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the size of the sample space, which is $|S| = 3$.\n\nThe problem states that the choice among these $3$ loci is equiprobable. This means that each elementary event in the sample space $S$ has the same probability. The probability of any single outcome is given by:\n$$P(\\text{outcome}) = \\frac{1}{|S|} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nSpecifically, the probabilities for choosing each locus are:\n$$P(\\text{choose } X_1) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(\\text{choose } X_2) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$P(\\text{choose } A^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nLet $E$ be the event that the autosome $A^{\\ast}$ undergoes ectopic autosomal silencing. As established, this event occurs if and only if the Xic on $A^{\\ast}$ is the one selected to upregulate *Xist*. Therefore, the probability of event $E$ is equal to the probability of the elementary event \"choose $A^{\\ast}$\".\n$$P(E) = P(\\text{choose } A^{\\ast})$$\nSubstituting the value calculated from the equiprobable assumption:\n$$P(E) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe question requires the answer to be expressed as an exact fraction.
