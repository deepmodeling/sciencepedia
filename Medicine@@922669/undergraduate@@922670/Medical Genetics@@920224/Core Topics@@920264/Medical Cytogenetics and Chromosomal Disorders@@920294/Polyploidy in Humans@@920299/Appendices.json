Genomic imprinting refers to parent-of-origin–specific epigenetic regulation of gene expression, wherein paternal and maternal genomes exert differing influences on extraembryonic versus embryonic tissues.

Diandric triploidy as the cause of a partial hydatidiform mole is a classic example in this field. The \"parental conflict hypothesis\" of genomic imprinting, which posits opposing effects of paternal and maternal genomes on placental and fetal growth, is a well-accepted theory explaining these phenomena. The role of p57 ($CDKN1C$, a maternally expressed, paternally imprinted gene) as a diagnostic marker is standard clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific genetic condition (diandric triploidy) and asks for the corresponding clinical, sonographic, and pathological phenotype, linking them to the underlying genetic mechanisms. A single logical and factually correct answer exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The information provided is sufficient and internally consistent. The genetic finding ($3n$, diandric) is correctly linked to the concept of a partial mole, and the descriptions of imprinting, histopathology, and p57 staining are all mutually consistent and factually accurate.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived by applying the given principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\nThe problem concerns a case of diandric triploidy, where the chromosome complement is $69$ with two sets from the father and one from the mother ($2p:1m$). We must deduce the expected phenotype by applying the principles of genomic imprinting.\n\n1.  **Effect of Genomic Imbalance:** The problem states that paternal genomes promote placental growth (trophoblast proliferation), while maternal genomes favor embryonic development and restrict placental growth. In diandric triploidy, the $2p:1m$ dosage results in an excess of paternally expressed genes relative to maternally expressed genes. This imbalance creates a strong drive for placental proliferation and a relative deficit in the factors promoting organized embryonic development.\n\n2.  **Placental Phenotype:** The excessive paternal drive leads to trophoblastic hyperplasia. This results in an abnormally large and thick placenta. Pathologically, this manifests as a partial hydatidiform mole, characterized by the histological features provided: focal trophoblastic hyperplasia and swelling of chorionic villi (hydropic change), which can form macroscopic cysts (cisterns). On ultrasound, this appears as an enlarged, multicystic or \"Swiss cheese\" placenta.\n\n3.  **Fetal Phenotype:** While the placenta is overgrown, the fetus itself is genetically abnormal with $69$ chromosomes. This profound aneuploidy is incompatible with normal development and results in multiple severe structural anomalies. Fetal growth is typically restricted, although this may be mild or proportionate early in gestation before becoming more severe. Crucially, unlike a complete mole, a fetus or fetal tissue is present.\n\n4.  **Maternal Endocrine Phenotype:** The hyperplastic trophoblast of the partial mole produces large quantities of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The resulting elevated maternal serum hCG levels can hyperstimulate the ovaries, leading to the development of large, bilateral theca lutein cysts.\n\n5.  **Immunohistochemical Marker (p57):** The gene encoding the p57 protein, $CDKN1C$, is located on chromosome $11p15.5$. It is a key example of an imprinted gene: the maternal allele is expressed, while the paternal allele is silenced (methylated). In diandric triploidy, a maternal set of chromosomes is present ($1m$). Therefore, the maternal $CDKN1C$ allele will be expressed, and the resulting p57 protein can be detected in the nuclei of cytotrophoblasts and villous stromal cells. This leads to a positive p57 immunohistochemistry result. This feature helps distinguish partial moles (p57-positive) from complete moles, which are typically androgenetic (lacking a maternal genome) and thus p57-negative.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The expected clinical picture for diandric triploidy at $12$ weeks is an enlarged, cystic placenta (partial mole), a coexistent fetus with growth restriction and anomalies, elevated maternal hCG, and possibly theca lutein cysts. The placental histology confirms a partial mole, and immunohistochemistry is positive for p57.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Enlarged, multicystic placenta with a “partial mole” appearance, a coexistent fetus with mild or proportionate growth restriction and structural anomalies, maternal bilateral theca lutein ovarian cysts, and elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); attributable to trophoblastic hyperplasia and hydropic villi driven by excess paternal genome dosage, with partial mole histopathology showing p57 positivity due to retained maternal genome.**\n- This option precisely matches the derived phenotype. It correctly identifies the enlarged, cystic (partial mole) placenta, the presence of an abnormal fetus, the high hCG and its consequence (theca lutein cysts). Furthermore, it provides the correct underlying mechanism: excess paternal genome dosage driving trophoblastic hyperplasia, and correctly states that the presence of the maternal genome results in p57 positivity.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Markedly small, thin, noncystic placenta, severe asymmetric fetal growth restriction with relative macrocephaly and oligohydramnios, and low maternal hCG; attributable to trophoblast underdevelopment driven by excess maternal genome dosage, with villi showing minimal hydropic change and p57 negativity.**\n- This option describes the phenotype of **digynic triploidy** ($1p:2m$), not diandric. In digynic triploidy, the excess maternal genome restricts placental development, leading to a small placenta, low hCG, and severe fetal growth restriction. The statement that p57 is negative is also incorrect; since a maternal genome is present, digynic triploidy is also p57 positive.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Normal-sized placenta without cystic change, fetal anomalies typical of autosomal trisomy (e.g., trisomy $13$), and normal maternal hCG; attributable to balanced parental genome dosage, with no molar histopathologic features and nonspecific placental immunohistochemistry.**\n- This option is incorrect on multiple counts. The placenta in diandric triploidy is not normal-sized but enlarged and cystic. Maternal hCG is elevated, not normal. The parental genome dosage ($2p:1m$) is fundamentally unbalanced, which is the cause of the pathology.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Enlarged placenta without cystic change, polyhydramnios, normal maternal hCG, and maternal ovaries without luteinized cysts; attributable to nonimprinted, nonspecific placental hyperplasia, with histology showing normal villous morphology and variable p57 staining.**\n- This option incorrectly states the placenta is without cystic change and that hCG is normal. The hyperplasia is absolutely a result of imprinting, not nonspecific. Villous morphology is abnormal (molar), not normal. p57 staining is reliably positive, not variable.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Diffuse “snowstorm” placenta with no identifiable fetus, very high maternal hCG, bilateral theca lutein cysts, and early-onset preeclampsia; attributable to androgenetic diploidy with complete mole histopathology and absent maternal genomic contribution, producing p57 negativity.**\n- This option describes a **complete hydatidiform mole**, not a partial mole. Complete moles are typically diploid and androgenetic ($2p:0m$), lack fetal tissue, and are p57 negative due to the absence of a maternal genome. The problem specifies triploidy ($3n$) with a maternal contribution.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5073086"}, {"introduction": "Once a clinical suspicion of a chromosomal abnormality is raised, laboratory analysis provides the definitive diagnosis.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, allowing for a rigorous derivation of the solution from the first principles provided. I will now proceed to solve the problem.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem lies in applying the given definition of B-allele frequency (BAF) to the different genomic states described. The BAF is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{BAF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of B copies}}{\\text{Total allele copies at the locus}}\n$$\n\nWe must analyze two distinct conditions: triploidy and trisomy.\n\n**1. Analysis of Triploidy**\n\nIn triploidy, every autosome has a copy number of $3$. This means that for any biallelic SNP (with alleles A and B) located on any autosome, there are a total of $3$ alleles. We can enumerate the possible genotypes and calculate their corresponding BAF values:\n\n- **Genotype $AAA$**: Number of B copies = $0$. Total copies = $3$.\n  $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0 $$\n- **Genotype $AAB$**: Number of B copies = $1$. Total copies = $3$.\n  $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n- **Genotype $ABB$**: Number of B copies = $2$. Total copies = $3$.\n  $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n- **Genotype $BBB$**: Number of B copies = $3$. Total copies = $3$.\n  $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 $$\n\nTherefore, for a triploid genome, analysis of SNPs across all autosomes will reveal BAF clusters centered at $0$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, and $1$. The heterozygous BAF cluster normally seen at $\\frac{1}{2}$ in diploid samples will be absent.\n\n**2. Analysis of Trisomy**\n\nIn a case of trisomy (e.g., Trisomy $21$), one specific autosome has a copy number of $3$, while all other autosomes remain diploid with a copy number of $2$. This requires analyzing SNPs on the trisomic chromosome separately from those on the diploid chromosomes.\n\n- **SNPs on the trisomic chromosome**: The total copy number is $3$. This situation is identical to the triploidy case, but localized to a single chromosome.\n    - Possible genotypes: $AAA, AAB, ABB, BBB$.\n    - Expected BAF clusters: $0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1$.\n\n- **SNPs on the diploid chromosomes**: The total copy number is $2$. This is the standard state for a healthy diploid individual.\n    - **Genotype $AA$**: Number of B copies = $0$. Total copies = $2$.\n      $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0 $$\n    - **Genotype $AB$**: Number of B copies = $1$. Total copies = $2$.\n      $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n    - **Genotype $BB$**: Number of B copies = $2$. Total copies = $2$.\n      $$ \\text{BAF} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $$\n    - Expected BAF clusters: $0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1$.\n\n**Summary and Differentiation**\n\n- **Triploidy**: A genome-wide BAF plot will show four distinct bands at $0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1$. A plot for any individual autosome will show these same four bands.\n- **Trisomy**: A genome-wide BAF plot will show a composite of the two patterns. The majority of SNPs (from the $22$ diploid autosome pairs) will generate BAF clusters at $0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1$. A smaller subset of SNPs (from the single trisomic autosome) will generate clusters at $0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1$. The most striking difference from triploidy is the presence of the large heterozygous cluster at BAF = $\\frac{1}{2}$. When BAF is plotted on a per-chromosome basis, the distinction is even clearer: $22$ autosome pairs will show the standard three BAF bands ($0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1$), while the single trisomic autosome will show the four BAF bands ($0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each option against my derived results.\n\n**A. Triploidy: across all autosomes, possible genotypes are $AAA$, $AAB$, $ABB$, $BBB$ with BAF clusters at $0$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, and $1$ genome-wide.

It describes a diploid (copy number $2$) state, not a triploid (copy number $3$) state.\n- The description for trisomy is also inaccurate as it implies the genome-wide pattern is exclusively the four-band pattern, ignoring the contribution from the numerous diploid chromosomes.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Triploidy and trisomy cannot be distinguished by BAF; both show genome-wide clusters only at $0$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, and $1$.**\n\n- This statement is false. As derived, they are clearly distinguishable. A trisomic genome contains a large number of diploid chromosomes, which results in a prominent BAF cluster at $\\frac{1}{2}$ that is absent in a triploid genome.

Triploidy: across all autosomes, possible genotypes are $AAAA$, $AAAB$, $ABBB$, $BBBB$ with BAF clusters at $0$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$, and $1$. Trisomy: on the trisomic chromosome, genotypes are $AAA$, $AAB$, $ABB$, $BBB$ with BAF clusters at $0$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, and $1$, while other chromosomes show $AA$, $AB$, $BB$ with BAF clusters at $0$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$.**\n\n- The description for triploidy is incorrect. The genotypes and BAF values listed correspond to tetraploidy (copy number $4$), not triploidy (copy number $3$). Furthermore, it omits the $AABB$ genotype and its corresponding BAF of $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- While the description for trisomy is correct, the initial premise regarding triploidy is flawed, making the entire option incorrect as a complete statement.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a fully correct and complete description of the BAF patterns for both triploidy and trisomy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5073160"}, {"introduction": "The field of genetics is built on precise definitions that have profound diagnostic implications.

This problem [@problem_id:5073116] requires you to think like a clinical geneticist, devising a rigorous, evidence-based sampling plan that uses fundamental principles of developmental biology and genotyping to distinguish between a condition arising from a post-zygotic error in a single embryo versus one originating from two or more embryos.", "problem": "A clinical geneticist is asked to draft operational definitions and an evidence-based sampling plan to distinguish mosaic polyploidy from chimerism in humans, for use in a diagnostic workup. The plan must be grounded in core developmental and genetic principles: a single fertilized egg (zygote) generates all somatic lineages through mitotic divisions, the genome sequence (barring somatic mutation) remains consistent across clonal descendants, and polyploidy arises via post-zygotic cell cycle errors (for example, failure of cytokinesis), whereas chimerism denotes coexistence of cell lineages derived from more than one zygote. The plan must specify how to use tissue sampling across germ layers, ploidy measurement, and genotype concordance to differentiate these conditions in an adult patient who may have had prior transfusions or transplants. Which option provides a precise operational definition of mosaic polyploidy and chimerism and delineates sampling and lineage criteria that would reliably distinguish them in clinical practice?\n\nA. Mosaic polyploidy is the presence, within one individual derived from a single zygote, of two or more cell populations that differ in ploidy (for example, a mixture of diploid and tetraploid cells), caused by post-zygotic mitotic errors. Chimerism is the coexistence, within one individual, of cell lineages derived from two or more distinct zygotes, which may or may not include polyploid cells. Distinguishing them requires sampling multiple tissues spanning germ layers (for example, ectodermal buccal epithelium, mesodermal blood, endodermal intestinal mucosa, plus skin fibroblasts), measuring ploidy by karyotype, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), or flow cytometry, and assessing genotype concordance by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays or Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling. Mosaic polyploidy will show one underlying genotype across tissues with variable proportions of polyploid cells aligned with developmental lineage patterns, whereas chimerism will show two or more genotypes with donor- or twin-derived lineages enriched in tissues with engraftment (for example, blood after bone marrow transplant).\n\nB. Mosaic polyploidy is a uniform whole-body polyploid state established at fertilization, whereas chimerism is a somatic mutation within one zygote that produces a second lineage. Distinguishing them requires only a single peripheral blood sample; if polyploid cells are detected at $>50\\%$, the case is mosaic polyploidy, otherwise chimerism.\n\nC. Mosaic polyploidy is due to meiotic nondisjunction generating a triploid embryo; chimerism is an epigenetic mixture of cell states within single tissues without genetic differences. Distinguishing them requires exclusively karyotyping of skin fibroblasts; if triploid cells are observed in any fraction, the diagnosis is mosaic polyploidy, otherwise chimerism.\n\nD. Mosaic polyploidy is a post-zygotic process producing both polyploid and diploid cells that can be detected by the presence of two genotypes within one tissue, whereas chimerism is acquired only via organ transplantation and is identified when all tissues share one genotype but exhibit different ploidy states.

I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating each option.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nBased on the provided principles, a logical diagnostic strategy can be constructed.\n1.  **Mosaic Polyploidy:** An individual originates from a single zygote, which is typically diploid ($2n$). During post-zygotic development, a mitotic error (e.g., endoreduplication, failure of cytokinesis) occurs in a single cell, giving rise to a polyploid cell (e.g., tetraploid, $4n$). All subsequent descendants of this cell will form a polyploid lineage. The individual is thus a \"mosaic\" of the original diploid ($2n$) cell line and the new polyploid ($4n$) cell line. Crucially, because both cell lines originate from the same zygote, they will share the **same fundamental genotype** (i.e., the same set of inherited alleles). The key characteristics are therefore: (i) presence of cells with different ploidy levels and (ii) a single, consistent underlying genotype across all cells. The distribution of the polyploid cells will depend on when and where in embryogenesis the mitotic error occurred, potentially being widespread or confined to specific tissues.\n\n2.  **Chimerism:** An individual is composed of cells derived from two or more distinct zygotes. This can occur congenitally (e.g., fusion of two embryos in utero) or be acquired iatrogenically (e.g., bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, or even blood transfusion, which introduces temporary chimerism). Because the cell lineages originate from different zygotes, they will possess **different genotypes**. The ploidy of these cell lines is typically diploid ($2n$), but the defining feature is the genetic difference, not the ploidy. The key characteristic is the presence of two or more distinct genotypes within the individual.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Strategy:** The core of the diagnostic problem is to differentiate between \"one genotype, multiple ploidies\" (mosaic polyploidy) and \"multiple genotypes\" (chimerism).\n    *   **Ploidy Analysis:** This is required to detect the polyploidy that defines one of the conditions. Techniques like karyotyping, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), or flow cytometry can measure DNA content or count chromosomes.\n    *   **Genotype Analysis:** This is the decisive test. Techniques like Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays can identify the unique genetic fingerprint of a cell population. In mosaic polyploidy, all tissues and cell fractions (separated by ploidy if possible) will show a single genotype. In chimerism, two distinct genotypes will be detected.\n    *   **Tissue Sampling:** Sampling from multiple tissues derived from different embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) is critical. This is because: (a) a mosaic condition might be restricted to certain tissues, and a single sample could miss it; (b) it helps differentiate congenital chimerism (where both genotypes might be widespread) from iatrogenic chimerism (where the second genotype is often restricted, e.g., to the blood system after a bone marrow transplant). The patient's history of transplants or transfusions is a critical confounding factor that a multi-tissue approach helps resolve.\n\nA reliable plan must, therefore, integrate multi-tissue sampling with both ploidy and genotype analysis to interpret the findings correctly.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mosaic polyploidy is the presence, within one individual derived from a single zygote, of two or more cell populations that differ in ploidy (for example, a mixture of diploid and tetraploid cells), caused by post-zygotic mitotic errors. Chimerism is the coexistence, within one individual, of cell lineages derived from two or more distinct zygotes, which may or may not include polyploid cells. Distinguishing them requires sampling multiple tissues spanning germ layers (for example, ectodermal buccal epithelium, mesodermal blood, endodermal intestinal mucosa, plus skin fibroblasts), measuring ploidy by karyotype, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), or flow cytometry, and assessing genotype concordance by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays or Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling. Mosaic polyploidy will show one underlying genotype across tissues with variable proportions of polyploid cells aligned with developmental lineage patterns, whereas chimerism will show two or more genotypes with donor- or twin-derived lineages enriched in tissues with engraftment (for example, blood after bone marrow transplant).**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option provides scientifically accurate and precise definitions for both mosaic polyploidy and chimerism, correctly attributing the former to a single zygote and post-zygotic error, and the latter to multiple zygotes. The proposed diagnostic plan is comprehensive and methodologically sound. It correctly specifies the need for multi-germ-layer tissue sampling, lists the appropriate techniques for both ploidy (karyotype, FISH, flow cytometry) and genotype (SNP, STR) analysis, and correctly predicts the expected outcomes for each condition. The interpretation correctly links a single genotype to mosaic polyploidy and multiple genotypes to chimerism, while also accounting for the context of transplantation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct.**\n\n**B. Mosaic polyploidy is a uniform whole-body polyploid state established at fertilization, whereas chimerism is a somatic mutation within one zygote that produces a second lineage. Distinguishing them requires only a single peripheral blood sample; if polyploid cells are detected at $>50\\%$, the case is mosaic polyploidy, otherwise chimerism.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect on multiple counts. The definition of mosaic polyploidy is wrong; \"mosaic\" is by definition not uniform, and it arises post-zygotically, not at fertilization. The definition of chimerism is also incorrect; it describes genetic mosaicism (one zygote, somatic mutation), not chimerism (multiple zygotes). The proposed diagnostic plan is grossly inadequate: a single blood sample is insufficient, and the $>50\\%$ threshold is arbitrary and biologically meaningless for this differential diagnosis. It fails to incorporate the critical step of genotyping.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mosaic polyploidy is due to meiotic nondisjunction generating a triploid embryo; chimerism is an epigenetic mixture of cell states within single tissues without genetic differences. Distinguishing them requires exclusively karyotyping of skin fibroblasts; if triploid cells are observed in any fraction, the diagnosis is mosaic polyploidy, otherwise chimerism.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is riddled with errors. The definition of mosaic polyploidy's origin is inaccurate; it describes the origin of non-mosaic triploidy (a meiotic error), whereas mosaicism is a mitotic phenomenon. The definition of chimerism is completely wrong; confusing it with epigenetic variation is a fundamental conceptual error, as chimerism is defined by genetic differences. The diagnostic plan is insufficient, relying exclusively on a single tissue type (skin fibroblasts) and a single method (karyotyping), which cannot reliably detect chimerism or map the distribution of mosaicism. The diagnostic logic is flawed.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mosaic polyploidy is a post-zygotic process producing both polyploid and diploid cells that can be detected by the presence of two genotypes within one tissue, whereas chimerism is acquired only via organ transplantation and is identified when all tissues share one genotype but exhibit different ploidy states. Distinguishing them requires sampling a single mesoderm-derived tissue (blood) and does not require cross-tissue genotype comparison; finding more than one genotype indicates mosaic polyploidy.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option presents definitions that are fundamentally confused and reversed. It incorrectly states that mosaic polyploidy is detected by two genotypes; this is the definition of chimerism. It then incorrectly defines chimerism using the characteristics of mosaic polyploidy (one genotype, different ploidy states). It also wrongly restricts chimerism to only transplantation, ignoring congenital forms. The diagnostic plan is based on this inverted logic, leading to the erroneous conclusion that finding more than one genotype indicates mosaic polyploidy.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5073116"}]}
