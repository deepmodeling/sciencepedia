We will proceed to determine the required values by applying fundamental principles of human medical genetics, specifically those governing X-chromosome inactivation and gene dosage.\n\n### Governing Principles\n\n1.  **X-Inactivation and Barr Bodies**: In human somatic cells, dosage compensation for X-linked genes is achieved by inactivating all but one X chromosome. The inactivated X chromosome condenses to form a heterochromatic structure known as a Barr body. The number of Barr bodies is therefore determined by the total number of X chromosomes ($N_X$) according to the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of Barr bodies} = N_X - 1 $$\n\n2.  **Expression of Genes Escaping X-Inactivation**: A subset of genes on the X chromosome escapes the inactivation process. These genes are expressed from the active X chromosome as well as from any inactivated X chromosomes (Barr bodies).\n\n3.  **Expression of Pseudoautosomal Region (PAR) Genes**: PAR genes are located in homologous regions on both the X and Y chromosomes. They do not undergo X-inactivation. Consequently, these genes are expressed from every X and every Y chromosome present in the cell.\n\n### Baseline Karyotype: $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ (Diploid Male)\n\nBefore analyzing the aneuploid cases, let us establish the expression levels in the baseline $46,\\mathrm{XY}$ male.\n-   **Karyotype**: $1$ X chromosome, $1$ Y chromosome.\n-   **Barr Bodies**: $N_X = 1$, so the number of Barr bodies is $1 - 1 = 0$.\n-   **Category 1 Gene Copies**: (X-chromosomal, escape inactivation, no Y homolog). The gene is present on the single X chromosome, which is active. Thus, **$1$ copy** is expressed.\n-   **Category 2 Gene Copies**: (PAR genes on X and Y, escape inactivation). The gene is present on the X and the Y chromosome. Both are active. Thus, $1 + 1 = \\mathbf{2}$ **copies** are expressed.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of expressed copies in the test subjects. The options provide absolute copy numbers, confirming this interpretation.\n\n### Analysis of Karyotype $48,\\mathrm{XXYY}$\n\n-   **Givens**: The karyotype is $48,\\mathrm{XXYY}$.

Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.

The sensitivity of the test, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the condition (the true positive rate):\n    $$ Se = P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.95 $$\n3.

The $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cell line originated from this background but lost one of the X chromosomes. Due to random segregation, across the population of $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells, the single retained X chromosome will carry the $A$ allele for approximately half of these heterozygous loci and the $B$ allele for the other half. This leads to two distinct scenarios for BAF calculations at these heterozygous sites.\n\n**Case 1: The $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells retained the X chromosome carrying the $A$ allele.**\nFor a locus in this category, the allelic counts in the total sample of $N$ cells are:\n- Number of $A$ alleles:\n  - From $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells: $1 \\times (\\text{number of } 45,\\mathrm{X} \\text{ cells}) = 1 \\times fN = fN$.\n  - From $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ cells: $1 \\times (\\text{number of } 46,\\mathrm{XX} \\text{ cells}) = 1 \\times (1-f)N = (1-f)N$.\n- Number of $B$ alleles:\n  - From $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells: $0 \\times (\\text{number of } 45,\\mathrm{X} \\text{ cells}) = 0$.\n  - From $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ cells: $1 \\times (\\text{number of } 46,\\mathrm{XX} \\text{ cells}) = 1 \\times (1-f)N = (1-f)N$.\n  - Total number of $B$ alleles = $(1-f)N$.\n\nThe total number of X chromosome copies at this locus across the entire sample is:\n- Total alleles = (Alleles from $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells) + (Alleles from $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ cells)\n- Total alleles = ($1 \\times fN$) + ($2 \\times (1-f)N$) = $fN + 2N - 2fN = (2-f)N$.\n\nThe B-allele frequency, $BAF_1$, is the ratio of the total count of B-alleles to the total count of all alleles (A and B).\n$$BAF_1 = \\frac{\\text{Total B alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{(1-f)N}{(2-f)N} = \\frac{1-f}{2-f}$$\nThis expression gives the position of the lower heterozygous band.\n\n**Case 2: The $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells retained the X chromosome carrying the $B$ allele.**\nFor a locus in this category, the allelic counts are:\n- Number of $A$ alleles:\n  - From $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells: $0$.\n  - From $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ cells: $1 \\times (1-f)N = (1-f)N$.\n- Number of $B$ alleles:\n  - From $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells: $1 \\times fN = fN$.\n  - From $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ cells: $1 \\times (1-f)N = (1-f)N$.\n  - Total number of $B$ alleles = $fN + (1-f)N = N$.\n\nThe total number of X chromosome copies remains $(2-f)N$, as calculated before.\nThe B-allele frequency, $BAF_2$, for this case is:\n$$BAF_2 = \\frac{\\text{Total B alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{N}{(2-f)N} = \\frac{1}{2-f}$$\nThis expression gives the position of the upper heterozygous band.\n\nThe derived expressions for the two heterozygous BAF bands are $\\frac{1-f}{2-f}$ and $\\frac{1}{2-f}$.\n\n### Calculation of the Mosaic Fraction $f$\n\nWe are given that the observed bands are at $0.375$ and $0.625$. Since $f$ must be between $0$ and $1$, it is clear that for $f>0$, $\\frac{1-f}{2-f} < \\frac{1}{2-f}$. Therefore, we can equate the expressions to the observed values:\n$$ \\frac{1-f}{2-f} = 0.375 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2-f} = 0.625 $$\nWe can solve for $f$ using either equation. Let's use the second one as it is algebraically simpler.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2-f} = 0.625 $$\n$$ 1 = 0.625 \\times (2-f) $$\n$$ 1 = 1.25 - 0.625f $$\n$$ 0.625f = 1.25 - 1 $$\n$$ 0.625f = 0.25 $$\n$$ f = \\frac{0.25}{0.625} = \\frac{250}{625} = \\frac{2 \\times 125}{5 \\times 125} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $$\n\nTo confirm, we can substitute $f=0.4$ into the first equation:\n$$ BAF_1 = \\frac{1-0.4}{2-0.4} = \\frac{0.6}{1.6} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $$\nThis matches the observed lower band position, confirming the consistency of the model and the result.\n\nThe fraction $f$ of $45,\\mathrm{X}$ cells is $0.4$.
