The described findings are characteristic of a specific type of CNV. The values and descriptions are realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient and consistent data to arrive at a single, best-fit interpretation among the choices. It is a standard diagnostic reasoning task in medical genetics.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The terms used are precise and objective (e.g., log base $2$ ratio, hemizygosity, heterozygous genotype).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. The analysis will proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nIn a normal diploid human genome, each autosomal locus is present in two copies ($CN=2$). SNP microarrays measure two key parameters to assess copy number:\n\n1.  **Log R Ratio (LRR)**: This is a measure of total signal intensity, normalized against a reference diploid genome. It is calculated as the base-$2$ logarithm of the observed intensity ratio: $LRR = \\log_2(\\text{Observed Intensity} / \\text{Expected Diploid Intensity})$.\n    - For a normal diploid state ($CN=2$), the ratio is $1$, so the theoretical $LRR = \\log_2(1) = 0$.\n    - For a heterozygous deletion (one-copy loss, $CN=1$), the intensity is halved. The theoretical $LRR = \\log_2(1/2) = -1$.\n    - For a homozygous deletion (two-copy loss, $CN=0$), the intensity is zero. The theoretical $LRR$ approaches $-\\infty$.\n    - For a three-copy duplication ($CN=3$), the intensity is $1.5$ times normal. The theoretical $LRR = \\log_2(3/2) = \\log_2(1.5) \\approx +0.585$.\n\n2.  **SNP Allele Pattern**: This reflects the genotype at each SNP locus. It is often visualized as a B-Allele Frequency (BAF) plot, which ranges from $0$ to $1$. In a diploid region, three genotype clusters are expected: homozygous AA (BAF $\\approx 0$), heterozygous AB (BAF $\\approx 0.5$), and homozygous BB (BAF $\\approx 1$).\n    - In a region of heterozygous deletion, one of the two parental chromosomes is lost. Therefore, any locus that was heterozygous (AB) in the germline now only has one allele (A or B). This state is called **hemizygosity**. It manifests as an **absence of heterozygous genotypes** (no markers with BAF $\\approx 0.5$), resulting in two distinct bands of SNP calls at BAF $\\approx 0$ and BAF $\\approx 1$.\n    - In a region of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH), the copy number is normal ($CN=2$), but both copies originate from the same parental chromosome. This also results in an absence of heterozygous genotypes but is distinguished by a normal LRR (close to $0$).\n\n**Applying Principles to a Validated Problem**\n\nThe provided data are:\n- $LRR = -0.58$: This is a negative value, indicating a loss of genetic material (a deletion). While the theoretical value for a one-copy loss is $-1$, experimental LRRs for constitutional heterozygous deletions typically fall in the range of $-0.4$ to $-0.8$ due to experimental noise, sample quality, and normalization effects. This value is strongly suggestive of a one-copy loss and is inconsistent with a two-copy loss ($LRR \\to -\\infty$), a copy-neutral state ($LRR \\approx 0$), or a duplication ($LRR > 0$).\n- **Hemizygosity and Absence of Heterozygous Genotypes**: This allele pattern is the quintessential signature of a deletion. It confirms that only one copy of the chromosomal segment is present. This finding, combined with the LRR, definitively points to a one-copy loss. It rules out CN-LOH (which would have $LRR \\approx 0$) and a homozygous deletion (which would have no SNP signal at all).\n- **Size ($800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$)**: This size is $0.8$ megabases (Mb). Changes below the resolution of conventional karyotyping (typically $< 5\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$) are termed microdeletions or microduplications. Therefore, \"microdeletion\" is the correct classification for this event.\n\nThe combination of an LRR of $-0.58$ and a clear pattern of hemizygosity provides compelling evidence for a heterozygous (one-copy) microdeletion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Heterozygous microdeletion (one-copy loss) across the $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ interval**\n- This interpretation is fully consistent with both the LRR and the allele pattern. The LRR of $-0.58$ is a typical experimental value for a one-copy loss. The description of hemizygosity and absence of heterozygous genotypes is the classic allelic signature for a one-copy loss. The $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ size makes it a microdeletion.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Homozygous deletion (zero-copy) across the $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ interval**\n- A zero-copy state would result in an LRR approaching negative infinity (practically, a value much more negative than $-0.58$) and a complete absence of SNP signals in the region, not a pattern of hemizygosity.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Microduplication to $3$ copies across the $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ interval**\n- A three-copy state would produce a positive LRR, theoretically around $+0.585$. The observed LRR is negative ($-0.58$). The allele pattern for a duplication would involve four clusters of SNPs, not hemizygosity.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity across the $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ interval**\n- This event is characterized by a loss of heterozygous genotypes, but crucially, the copy number is normal ($CN=2$). This would correspond to an LRR value near $0$. The observed LRR of $-0.58$ clearly indicates a loss of copy number.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Mosaic heterozygous deletion present in approximately $60$–$70\\%$ of cells across the $800\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ interval**\n- If a fraction $f$ of cells has a heterozygous deletion, the average copy number is $CN_{avg} = 2(1-f) + 1(f) = 2-f$. The corresponding LRR is $LRR = \\log_2(CN_{avg}/2) = \\log_2(1 - f/2)$. For $f=0.65$ ($65\\%$), $LRR = \\log_2(1 - 0.325) = \\log_2(0.675) \\approx -0.57$. The LRR value of $-0.58$ is numerically well-explained by this mosaicism level. However, in a mosaic sample, the allele pattern would not show a clean \"absence of heterozygous genotypes\". The normal cells ($30$–$40\\%$ of the population) would still contribute a heterozygous signal. This would result in attenuated or \"split\" heterozygous clusters, not a clean absence. The problem states a clear \"absence of heterozygous genotypes\" and \"hemizygosity,\" which are definitive terms for a non-mosaic state. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the allele pattern description. Option A, which represents the standard interpretation of such data in a clinical context, is the better fit despite the LRR deviating from the theoretical integer-copy value of $-1$.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5059403"}, {"introduction": "Building on the qualitative interpretation of array data, our next exercise delves into the quantitative models that underpin automated copy number variation (CNV) detection.

We first need to define these outcomes and calculate their respective probabilities for any single conception.\n\nLet's define the possible outcomes for one child:\n1.  **Deletion with Severe Phenotype (S):** The child inherits the deletion, manifests a phenotype, and the phenotype is severe.\n2.  **Deletion with Mild Phenotype (M):** The child inherits the deletion, manifests a phenotype, and the phenotype is mild.\n3.  **Deletion with No Phenotype (N):** The child inherits the deletion but does not manifest a clinically significant phenotype (incomplete penetrance).\n4.  **No Deletion (U):** The child does not inherit the deletion.\n\nThe probabilities of these four disjoint events for any single child are calculated as follows, based on the provided assumptions of independence:\n\n-   The probability of inheriting the deletion is given as $P(\\text{del}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   The probability of not inheriting the deletion is $P(\\text{no del}) = 1 - P(\\text{del}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n-   The probability of outcome **S** (Severe) is the product of the probabilities of inheriting the deletion, manifesting the phenotype given the deletion, and the phenotype being severe given manifestation:\n    $$ p_S = P(\\text{del}) \\times P(\\text{manifest}|\\text{del}) \\times P(\\text{severe}|\\text{manifest}) $$\n    $$ p_S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times s \\times r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.4 \\times 0.3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{12}{200} = \\frac{3}{50} $$\n\n-   The probability of outcome **M** (Mild) is the product of the probabilities of inheriting the deletion, manifesting the phenotype, and the phenotype being mild:\n    $$ p_M = P(\\text{del}) \\times P(\\text{manifest}|\\text{del}) \\times P(\\text{mild}|\\text{manifest}) $$\n    $$ p_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\times s \\times (1-r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.4 \\times 0.7 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{28}{200} = \\frac{7}{50} $$\n\n-   The probability of outcome **U** (No Deletion) is:\n    $$ p_U = P(\\text{no del}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nThe problem specifies an outcome for a family of $n=5$ children where:\n-   Exactly $1$ child has outcome S (severe phenotype).\n-   Exactly $1$ child has outcome M (mild phenotype).\n-   The problem states \"exactly $2$ children inherit the $16\\mathrm{p}11.2$ deletion, and, among those $2$ ... one manifests a severe phenotype and the other manifests a mild phenotype.\" This implies that the other $n-2 = 3$ children do not inherit the deletion.\n-   Therefore, exactly $3$ children must have outcome U (no deletion).\n-   This also implies that $0$ children have outcome N (deletion with no phenotype).\n\nWe are looking for the probability of the specific configuration of counts $(k_S=1, k_M=1, k_N=0, k_U=3)$ out of $n=5$ trials. We use the multinomial probability formula:\n$$ P(k_S, k_M, k_N, k_U) = \\frac{n!}{k_S! k_M! k_N! k_U!} p_S^{k_S} p_M^{k_M} p_N^{k_N} p_U^{k_U} $$\nHere, we only need the probabilities $p_S$, $p_M$, and $p_U$, as $p_N^{k_N}$ will be $p_N^0 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n-   $n = 5$\n-   $k_S = 1$\n-   $k_M = 1$\n-   $k_N = 0$\n-   $k_U = 3$\n-   $p_S = \\frac{3}{50}$\n-   $p_M = \\frac{7}{50}$\n-   $p_U = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe probability $P$ is:\n$$ P = \\frac{5!}{1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 0! \\cdot 3!} \\left(\\frac{3}{50}\\right)^1 \\left(\\frac{7}{50}\\right)^1 (p_N)^0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 $$\nThe multinomial coefficient is calculated as:\n$$ \\frac{5!}{1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 0! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 $$\nNow substitute this back into the probability equation:\n$$ P = 20 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{50}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{7}{50}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 $$\n$$ P = 20 \\times \\frac{3}{50} \\times \\frac{7}{50} \\times \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ P = \\frac{20 \\times 3 \\times 7}{50 \\times 50 \\times 8} $$\n$$ P = \\frac{420}{20000} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can cancel common factors:\n$$ P = \\frac{42}{2000} = \\frac{21}{1000} $$\nThe fraction $\\frac{21}{1000}$ is in its simplest form, since the prime factors of $21$ are $3$ and $7$, neither of which are factors of $1000 = 10^3 = (2 \\times 5)^3 = 2^3 \\times 5^3$.\nThus, the final probability is $\\frac{21}{1000}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{21}{1000}}$$", "id": "5059395"}]}
