Consider a balanced carrier of a Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes $14$ and $21$, denoted $\\text{rob}(14;21)$. The carrier’s karyotypic content for the involved chromosomes at the start of meiosis is one $\\text{rob}(14;21)$, one normal chromosome $14$, and one normal chromosome $21$.\n\nUsing core definitions of meiotic pairing and segregation and the fact that homologous centromeres segregate at meiosis I, a trivalent forms among the normal chromosome $14$, the normal chromosome $21$, and the $\\text{rob}(14;21)$. In meiosis, alternate segregation can produce balanced gametes, and adjacent segregation can produce unbalanced gametes. After fertilization by a normal partner who contributes one normal chromosome $14$ and one normal chromosome $21$ to the zygote, viability depends on autosomal copy number: autosomal monosomy is lethal; most autosomal trisomies are lethal with the notable exception of trisomy $21$, which causes Down syndrome.\n\nFor this question, define an “euploid outcome” as a zygote with $46$ chromosomes and two copies of each long arm of chromosomes $14$ and $21$ without any translocation, and define “Down syndrome outcome” as a viable zygote with trisomy $21$ (three long-arm copies of chromosome $21$) and disomy $14$ (two long-arm copies of chromosome $14$).

The primary segregation patterns for a trivalent are:\n\n1.  **Alternate Segregation:** The two normal chromosomes segregate to one pole, and the translocated chromosome segregates to the opposite pole.\n2.  **Adjacent-1 Segregation:** The normal chromosome $14$ and the translocated chromosome segregate to one pole, and the normal chromosome $21$ segregates to the other.\n3.  **Adjacent-2 Segregation:** The normal chromosome $21$ and the translocated chromosome segregate to one pole, and the normal chromosome $14$ segregates to the other.\n\nThese segregation patterns produce six possible types of gametes from the carrier (after Meiosis II):\n\n*   From Alternate Segregation:\n    *   Gamete Type 1: $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$\n    *   Gamete Type 2: $\\{\\text{rob}(14;21)\\}$\n*   From Adjacent-1 Segregation:\n    *   Gamete Type 3: $\\{N_{14}, \\text{rob}(14;21)\\}$\n    *   Gamete Type 4: $\\{N_{21}\\}$\n*   From Adjacent-2 Segregation:\n    *   Gamete Type 5: $\\{N_{21}, \\text{rob}(14;21)\\}$\n    *   Gamete Type 6: $\\{N_{14}\\}$\n\nNext, we analyze the zygote formed upon fertilization of each of these gametes with a normal gamete, which contributes $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$. The long-arm content is what determines the phenotype. A normal gamete provides one copy of the long arm of chromosome $14$ ($14q$) and one copy of the long arm of chromosome $21$ ($21q$).

Consider a representative protein-coding gene located on chromosome 21 with a per-copy basal transcription rate $r$ (in arbitrary mRNA units per unit time) and a first-order mRNA degradation rate constant $d$ (per unit time). Assume that steady-state transcript abundance arises from the balance between transcription and degradation, that transcripts from each gene copy are produced independently, and that $r$ and $d$ are unchanged across karyotypes under the linear dosage assumption.

For a gene with $n$ copies, if each copy contributes independently and identically to transcription, and mRNA degradation is first order with rate constant $d$, then the net mRNA dynamics can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = n r - d m,\n$$\nwhere $m$ denotes the total mRNA abundance attributable to the gene.

Several mechanistic factors can produce nonlinearity:\n\n- Transcriptional feedback and resource limitation: The cellular pool of general transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, nucleotides, and chromatin remodeling complexes is finite. Increasing the number of templates (copies) can reduce per-copy transcriptional efficiency via competition, leading to attenuation of $r$ as $n$ increases.\n- Post-transcriptional regulation: MicroRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, including those encoded on chromosome $21$, can alter mRNA stability and translation. If the abundance of destabilizing factors increases with $n$, the effective degradation rate $d$ may increase in trisomy, reducing the observed fold-change.\n- Chromatin and nuclear organization: Changes in three-dimensional genome organization and epigenetic marks with aneuploidy can alter promoter accessibility and transcriptional burst kinetics, decoupling expression from copy number.\n- Proteostasis and stoichiometry: Imbalances in protein complexes due to dosage changes can trigger stress responses that globally modulate transcription and mRNA decay, further buffering expression.\n\nTo formalize one such attenuation effect, consider the minimal model in which the per-copy transcription rate is reduced with total dosage:\n$$\nr_{\\text{eff}}(n) = \\frac{r}{1+\\beta n}, \\quad \\beta>0.\n$$\nThe steady-state expression with this attenuation is\n$$\nE_{\\beta}(n) = \\frac{n \\, r_{\\text{eff}}(n)}{d} = \\frac{n}{d} \\cdot \\frac{r}{1+\\beta n} = \\frac{n r}{d(1+\\beta n)}.\n$$\nTherefore, the trisomy-to-disomy fold-change under attenuation is\n$$\nF_{\\beta} = \\frac{E_{\\beta}(3)}{E_{\\beta}(2)} = \\frac{\\frac{3 r}{d(1+3\\beta)}}{\\frac{2 r}{d(1+2\\beta)}} = \\frac{3(1+2\\beta)}{2(1+3\\beta)}.\n$$\nThis expression shows how attenuation lowers the fold-change relative to the linear value.
