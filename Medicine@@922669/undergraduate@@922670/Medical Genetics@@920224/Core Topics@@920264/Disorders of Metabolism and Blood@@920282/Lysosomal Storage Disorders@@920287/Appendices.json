Consider a single-compartment lysosome in which the substrate concentration is denoted by $S(t)$. Substrate enters the lysosome at a constant influx $J_{\\text{in}}$ (units: $\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) and is degraded by a single enzyme following Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with degradation rate $v(S) = \\dfrac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S}$, where $V_{\\max}$ has units $\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and $K_m$ has units $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. At steady state, $S(t)$ is constant and denoted by $S^{*}$.\n\nStarting from the mass balance principle for a well-mixed compartment and the definition of steady state, derive an expression for $S^{*}$ in terms of $J_{\\text{in}}$, $V_{\\max}$, and $K_m$.

The rate of change of $S(t)$ is the difference between the constant influx rate, $J_{\\text{in}}$, and the degradation rate, $v(S)$, which follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics. For a well-mixed compartment of constant volume, the ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = J_{\\text{in}} - v(S)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Michaelis–Menten rate, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = J_{\\text{in}} - \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S}\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration is constant, so $S(t) = S^{*}$ and $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$.

Since $J_{\\text{in}} \\ge 0$ and the Michaelis constant $K_m > 0$, the numerator $J_{\\text{in}} K_m$ is non-negative. Therefore, the denominator must be strictly positive to ensure a physically meaningful and finite solution ($S^{*} \\ge 0$). This gives the necessary condition:\n$$\nV_{\\max} - J_{\\text{in}} > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad V_{\\max} > J_{\\text{in}}\n$$\nThis condition means that the maximum possible rate of enzyme-catalyzed degradation must be greater than the rate of substrate influx.
