Let $Hb$ represent a hemoglobin molecule and $O_2$ represent an oxygen molecule. The effective reaction is modeled as:\n$$ Hb + n\\,O_2 \\rightleftharpoons Hb(O_2)_n $$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill coefficient, an empirical parameter representing the degree of cooperativity, not necessarily the true stoichiometry.\n\nThe law of mass action for this equilibrium gives the association constant, $K_a$:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{[Hb][O_2]^n} $$\nIn this context, the concentration of the ligand, $[O_2]$, is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen, $pO_2$. We can thus write the expression using $pO_2$:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{[Hb](pO_2)^n} $$\nThe oxygen saturation, $Y$, is defined as the fraction of occupied binding sites. In this simplified model, this is the ratio of the concentration of oxygen-bound hemoglobin to the total concentration of hemoglobin:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{[Hb]_{total}} = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{[Hb] + [Hb(O_2)_n]} $$\nFrom the association constant expression, we can write $[Hb]$ in terms of $[Hb(O_2)_n]$:\n$$ [Hb] = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{K_a (pO_2)^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $Y$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{\\frac{[Hb(O_2)_n]}{K_a (pO_2)^n} + [Hb(O_2)_n]} $$\nThe term $[Hb(O_2)_n]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ Y = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{K_a (pO_2)^n} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $K_a (pO_2)^n$ yields a more common form:\n$$ Y = \\frac{K_a (pO_2)^n}{1 + K_a (pO_2)^n} $$\nThe problem defines $P_{50}$ as the partial pressure of oxygen at which saturation is half-maximal, i.e., $Y = \\frac{1}{2}$ when $pO_2 = P_{50}$. We use this definition to relate $K_a$ to $P_{50}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_a (P_{50})^n}{1 + K_a (P_{50})^n} $$\nSolving for $K_a$:\n$$ 1 + K_a (P_{50})^n = 2 K_a (P_{50})^n $$\n$$ 1 = K_a (P_{50})^n $$\n$$ K_a = \\frac{1}{(P_{50})^n} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $K_a$ back into the general equation for $Y$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{\\frac{1}{(P_{50})^n} (pO_2)^n}{1 + \\frac{1}{(P_{50})^n} (pO_2)^n} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{pO_2}{P_{50}}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{pO_2}{P_{50}}\\right)^n} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(P_{50})^n$ gives the final, standard form of the Hill equation:\n$$ Y = \\frac{(pO_2)^n}{(P_{50})^n + (pO_2)^n} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Deoxygenated Fraction**\n\nThe problem requires calculating the deoxygenated fraction, $1 - Y$, for HbS under specified conditions.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $pO_2 = 25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{50} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $n = 2.5$\n\nFirst, we calculate the oxygen saturation, $Y$, using the derived Hill equation:\n$$ Y = \\frac{(25)^{2.5}}{(30)^{2.5} + (25)^{2.5}} $$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use the alternative form of the equation:\n$$ Y = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{25}{30}\\right)^{2.5}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{25}{30}\\right)^{2.5}} $$\nLet the ratio $x = \\frac{25}{30} = \\frac{5}{6}$. The expression becomes:\n$$ Y = \\frac{x^n}{1+x^n} = \\frac{(\\frac{5}{6})^{2.5}}{1 + (\\frac{5}{6})^{2.5}} $$\nWe evaluate the term $(\\frac{5}{6})^{2.5}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{2.5} \\approx (0.83333...)^{2.5} \\approx 0.6339446 $$\nNow, we compute $Y$:\n$$ Y \\approx \\frac{0.6339446}{1 + 0.6339446} = \\frac{0.6339446}{1.6339446} \\approx 0.3880004 $$\nThe deoxygenated fraction is $1 - Y$:\n$$ 1 - Y \\approx 1 - 0.3880004 = 0.6119996 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ 1 - Y \\approx 0.6120 $$\nThis result signifies that under the low-oxygen conditions of a postcapillary venule, approximately $61.2\\%$ of sickle hemoglobin is in the deoxygenated T-state, which is prone to polymerization and sickling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6120}$$", "id": "5081479"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of deoxygenation, this exercise introduces the critical biophysical principle of supersaturation.

A fundamental property of such a process is that the waiting time, $T$, until the first event occurs follows an exponential distribution.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the waiting time $T$ is given by:\n$$\np(t) = k \\exp(-kt) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nThe probability that sickling occurs within a time interval of duration $t_{\\text{transit}}$ is equivalent to the probability that the waiting time $T$ is less than or equal to $t_{\\text{transit}}$. This is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution, evaluated at $t = t_{\\text{transit}}$.\n$$\nP(\\text{sickle}) = P(T \\le t_{\\text{transit}}) = \\int_0^{t_{\\text{transit}}} k \\exp(-k\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\nP(\\text{sickle}) = \\left[ -\\exp(-k\\tau) \\right]_0^{t_{\\text{transit}}} = (-\\exp(-k \\cdot t_{\\text{transit}})) - (-\\exp(0)) = 1 - \\exp(-k \\cdot t_{\\text{transit}})\n$$\nThe problem asks for this probability to be expressed in terms of $t_{\\text{transit}}$ and a characteristic delay time, $t_d$. For an exponential waiting-time distribution, the mean waiting time until the event is $E[T] = 1/k$. This mean time is the natural definition for the characteristic delay time of the process. We therefore define:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting $k = 1/t_d$ into the probability expression yields the first required result:\n$$\nP(\\text{sickle}) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\text{transit}}}{t_d}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the probability of sickling as a function of the transit time relative to the characteristic delay time for nucleation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this probability using the provided physiological parameters. The hazard rate $k$ depends on the model parameters as follows:\n$$\nk = k_{\\max} \\, f_{\\text{deoxy}}^{\\,m}\n$$\nwhere the deoxygenated fraction is $f_{\\text{deoxy}} = 1 - S$.
