Let the population be large, randomly mating, and subject to no mutation, no migration, no natural selection on the locus, and no assortative mating. These conditions define Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), which holds when allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations in the absence of evolutionary forces and given random mating.\n\nSuppose the frequency of allele $S$ in the population is $p$, and the frequency of allele $A$ is $q$, with $p+q=1$.

Let the two alleles be $A$ and $S$. The frequency of the allele $S$ is given as $p$, and the frequency of the allele $A$ is given as $q$. As there are only two alleles at this locus, the sum of their frequencies must be unity, so $p + q = 1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the foundational principle of random mating in a large population where other evolutionary influences are absent. Under these conditions, the formation of diploid genotypes in the next generation can be modeled as the random union of gametes drawn from a large gene pool. The frequency of an allele in the gene pool is equivalent to its frequency in the population. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a gamete carrying the allele $A$ is $q$, and the probability of randomly selecting a gamete carrying the allele $S$ is $p$.\n\nTo form a diploid individual, two gametes must fuse. Since mating is random, the choice of the allele from the paternal gamete is independent of the choice of the allele from the maternal gamete. We can calculate the probability of each of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $AS$, and $SS$) by considering the probabilities of these independent events.\n\n1.  **Genotype $AA$**: An individual has the genotype $AA$ if they inherit an $A$ allele from the paternal gamete AND an $A$ allele from the maternal gamete. The probability of inheriting an $A$ allele from the paternal gamete is $q$, and the probability of inheriting an $A$ allele from the maternal gamete is also $q$. The joint probability is the product of these independent probabilities.\n    $$ \\text{Frequency}(AA) = P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother}) = q \\times q = q^{2} $$\n\n2.  **Genotype $SS$**: Similarly, an individual has the genotype $SS$ if they inherit an $S$ allele from the paternal gamete AND an $S$ allele from the maternal gamete. The probability of inheriting an $S$ allele from either parent is $p$.\n    $$ \\text{Frequency}(SS) = P(S \\text{ from father}) \\times P(S \\text{ from mother}) = p \\times p = p^{2} $$\n\n3.  **Genotype $AS$**: A heterozygous individual, $AS$, can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    a) Inheriting an $A$ allele from the father and an $S$ allele from the mother. The probability of this event is $P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(S \\text{ from mother}) = q \\times p$.\n    b) Inheriting an $S$ allele from the father and an $A$ allele from the mother. The probability of this event is $P(S \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother}) = p \\times q$.\n\n    The total probability of forming an $AS$ heterozygote is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n    $$ \\text{Frequency}(AS) = (q \\times p) + (p \\times q) = 2pq $$\n\nThe expected genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are therefore $q^{2}$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $AS$, and $p^{2}$ for $SS$.\n\nAs a consistency check, the sum of these genotype frequencies must equal $1$, reflecting the entire population.\n$$ \\text{Sum of frequencies} = \\text{Freq}(AA) + \\text{Freq}(AS) + \\text{Freq}(SS) = q^{2} + 2pq + p^{2} $$\nThis expression is the binomial expansion of $(q+p)^{2}$.

By calculating the probability of misclassification, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the principles of diagnostic accuracy and the crucial role of confirmatory testing in medical genetics.", "problem": "A clinical laboratory uses alkaline electrophoresis to screen for hemoglobin (Hb) variants in a population where the beta-globin gene has known variant alleles. Hemoglobin S (HbS) arises from a pathogenic missense variant in the beta-globin gene ($HBB$) causing the amino acid substitution glutamate to valine at position $6$ of the beta chain, which promotes polymerization under deoxygenated conditions. Hemoglobin D-Punjab (HbD-Punjab) arises from a distinct missense variant in $HBB$ causing the amino acid substitution glutamate to glutamine at position $121$, which does not promote polymerization. At alkaline pH, the laboratory’s electrophoretic method produces a single co-migrating band for HbS and HbD-Punjab, and the laboratory’s screening rule is to report “HbS present” if this co-migrating band is observed.\n\nAssume the following, consistent with well-tested facts in medical genetics and hemoglobin biochemistry:\n- The population genotype proportions are: HbA/HbA (normal) with probability $0.93$, HbA/HbS (HbS trait) with probability $0.05$, and HbA/HbD$^{\\text{Punjab}}$ (HbD-Punjab trait) with probability $0.02$.\n- The alkaline electrophoresis screen has probability $1$ of showing the co-migrating band if either HbS or HbD-Punjab is present and has probability $0$ of showing that band if both are absent. The method cannot distinguish HbS from HbD-Punjab based on band position alone.\n- The laboratory’s report “HbS present” is issued whenever the co-migrating band is present, without further testing.\n\nStarting from the definitions of probability and conditional probability, derive an expression for the expected misclassification rate among all individuals reported as “HbS present,” where “misclassification” is defined as being reported “HbS present” when the individual’s true genotype is HbA/HbD$^{\\text{Punjab}}$ rather than any genotype containing HbS.

A misclassification is defined as an individual with genotype HbA/HbD$^{\\text{Punjab}}$ (event $D$) being reported as \"HbS present\" (event $R$). Therefore, we are asked to compute the conditional probability $P(D|R)$, which is the probability of the true genotype being $D$ given that the report is $R$.\n\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(D|R) = \\frac{P(D \\cap R)}{P(R)} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap R)$, is the probability that an individual has genotype $D$ and is reported as $R$.
