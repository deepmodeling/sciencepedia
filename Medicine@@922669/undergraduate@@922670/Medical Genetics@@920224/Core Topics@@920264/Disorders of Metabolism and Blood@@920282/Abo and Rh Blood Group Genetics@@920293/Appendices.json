The inheritance of the ABO blood group is determined by three alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$.

Therefore:\n- The mother, who is Type A, must be $I^{A}i$ (since $I^{A}I^{A}$ cannot donate $i$).\n- The father must carry at least one $i$ allele. Thus his ABO genotype must be one of $I^{A}i$ (Type A), $I^{B}i$ (Type B), or $ii$ (Type O). A father with Type AB has genotype $I^{A}I^{B}$ and cannot donate $i$, so any AB phenotype is impossible as a father.\n\nFor the Rh system, Rh-negative phenotype is $rr$. By segregation, the child’s $rr$ requires each parent to contribute an $r$ allele. The mother is Rh-positive, so her Rh genotype must be $Rr$ (since $RR$ cannot donate $r$). The father must be either $Rr$ (Rh-positive) or $rr$ (Rh-negative). Therefore, Rh-positive fathers are possible if heterozygous $Rr$, and Rh-negative fathers are also possible.\n\nBecause the ABO and Rh loci assort independently, impossibility is determined by whether any genotype consistent with the stated phenotype can supply the required alleles $i$ and $r$. The only ABO phenotype that can never supply $i$ is AB; thus any AB option is impossible regardless of Rh.
