It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and applies these principles to a real-world example of an autosomal recessive disorder, Phenylketonuria (PKU). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the data are consistent.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: a definition and derivation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the application of this principle to relate disease incidence to allele frequencies for an autosomal recessive trait, and a calculation of the carrier frequency based on a given incidence.\n\nFirst, we define the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a single biallelic locus. Let us consider a gene with two alleles, a dominant allele denoted by $A$ and a recessive allele denoted by $a$. In the context of PKU, $A$ represents the functional allele of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, and $a$ represents a loss-of-function (recessive, disease-causing) allele.\n\nLet the frequency of allele $A$ in the population's gene pool be $p$, and the frequency of allele $a$ be $q$. Since these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a population satisfying certain ideal conditions, the allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. The necessary assumptions for HWE, as stated in the problem, are:\n$1$. The population is infinitely large (in practice, large enough to prevent random fluctuations in allele frequencies, i.e., genetic drift).\n$2$. Mating is random (panmixia).\n$3$. There is no mutation ($A$ does not change to $a$, or vice versa).\n$4$. There is no natural selection (all genotypes have equal viability and fertility).\n$5$. There is no gene flow (no migration of individuals into or out of the population).\n\nUnder these assumptions, we can predict the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the next generation based on the allele frequencies in the current generation. Random mating is equivalent to the random union of gametes. The probability that a sperm or egg carries the $A$ allele is $p$, and the probability that it carries the $a$ allele is $q$. The frequencies of the genotypes formed by the union of these gametes are:\n-   The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, $f(AA)$, is the probability of receiving an $A$ allele from both parents: $p \\times p = p^2$.\n-   The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, $f(aa)$, is the probability of receiving an $a$ allele from both parents: $q \\times q = q^2$.\n-   The frequency of the heterozygous genotype, $f(Aa)$, is the probability of receiving an $A$ from one parent and an $a$ from the other. This can happen in two ways: $A$ from the father and $a$ from the mother (probability $p \\times q$), or $a$ from the father and $A$ from the mother (probability $q \\times p$). Thus, the total frequency is $pq + qp = 2pq$.\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies must equal $1$, which provides a check on our derivation:\n$$f(AA) + f(Aa) + f(aa) = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$$\nThis equation, $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$, is the mathematical expression of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nNext, we relate the disease incidence of an autosomal recessive disorder to the underlying allele frequencies. PKU is specified as an autosomal recessive disorder with complete penetrance. This means that only individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$, will manifest the disease. Therefore, the incidence of the disease in the population is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype. Based on the HWE derivation above, this relationship is:\n$$\\text{Incidence} = f(aa) = q^2$$\nwhere $q$ is the frequency of the recessive (disease-causing) allele.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected carrier frequency for PKU. Carriers are defined as heterozygous individuals ($Aa$) who do not express the disease but can pass the recessive allele to their offspring. The frequency of carriers is given by the term $f(Aa) = 2pq$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed incidence of PKU is $1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$q^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nWe can solve for $q$, the frequency of the recessive allele $a$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.01$$\n\nNow, we can find the frequency of the dominant allele $p$ using the relation $p + q = 1$:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nWith the frequencies of both alleles known, we can calculate the carrier frequency, $2pq$:\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq = 2 \\times (0.99) \\times (0.01)$$\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2 \\times (0.0099) = 0.0198$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.0198$. To express this decimal with four significant figures, we must add a trailing zero.\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 0.01980$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01980}$$", "id": "5011160"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of PKU is a molecular defect: a reduction in the catalytic efficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is based on the principle of mass balance at steady state. For plasma phenylalanine ($[\\mathrm{Phe}]$), this means the rate of its appearance from dietary intake, $J_{in}$, must equal its rate of removal via metabolic clearance, $J_{clear}$.\n\nThe rate of clearance is given as a first-order process:\n$$J_{clear} = CL \\cdot [\\mathrm{Phe}]$$\nwhere $CL$ is the clearance coefficient.\n\nAt steady state, $J_{in} = J_{clear}$. Therefore, the steady-state concentration, $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_{ss}$, is given by:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_{ss} = \\frac{J_{in}}{CL}$$\n\nWe are to analyze two distinct scenarios: a baseline (normal) state and an intervention state.\n\n**1. Baseline State (State 0):**\nLet the parameters for the healthy baseline state be denoted with a subscript $0$. The steady-state equation is:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_0 = \\frac{J_{in,0}}{CL_0}$$\nWe are given that $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_0 = 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol/L}$.\n\n**2. Intervention State (State 1):**\nLet the parameters for the state with the pathogenic variant and dietary intervention be denoted with a subscript $1$. The steady-state equation is:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1 = \\frac{J_{in,1}}{CL_1}$$\nOur goal is to determine $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1$. To do this, we must relate the parameters of State $1$ to those of State $0$.\n\nThe problem states that the clearance coefficient, $CL$, is directly proportional to the enzyme's catalytic efficiency, $E = k_{cat}/K_m$. We can write this relationship as $CL = c \\cdot E$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\n- For State 0: $CL_0 = c \\cdot E_0$.\n- For State 1, the catalytic efficiency is reduced to $10\\%$ of normal. Thus, $E_1 = 0.10 \\cdot E_0$.\nThe clearance coefficient in State 1 is therefore:\n$$CL_1 = c \\cdot E_1 = c \\cdot (0.10 \\cdot E_0) = 0.10 \\cdot (c \\cdot E_0) = 0.10 \\cdot CL_0$$\n\nThe problem also states that dietary phenylalanine intake is reduced by $60\\%$ relative to baseline. This means the intake rate in State 1 is $100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%$ of the baseline intake rate.\n$$J_{in,1} = (1 - 0.60) \\cdot J_{in,0} = 0.40 \\cdot J_{in,0}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the equation for $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1$:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1 = \\frac{J_{in,1}}{CL_1} = \\frac{0.40 \\cdot J_{in,0}}{0.10 \\cdot CL_0}$$\n\nWe can re-group the terms to isolate the expression for the baseline concentration:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.10}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{J_{in,0}}{CL_0}\\right)$$\nSince we know that $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_0 = \\frac{J_{in,0}}{CL_0}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.10}\\right) \\cdot [\\mathrm{Phe}]_0 = 4 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Phe}]_0$$\n\nFinally, we use the given value for the baseline concentration, $[\\mathrm{Phe}]_0 = 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol/L}$, to calculate the final answer:\n$$[\\mathrm{Phe}]_1 = 4 \\cdot 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol/L} = 280\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol/L}$$\n\nThe calculation results in an integer, so no rounding is necessary.

The problem is thus deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core principle for this problem is the mass-balance equation at steady state. The problem states that the plasma compartment is in a steady state, which implies that the rate of Phe entering the system (dietary intake) must equal the rate of Phe leaving the system (elimination).\nLet $I_{\\text{rate}}$ be the rate of dietary intake and $E_{\\text{rate}}$ be the rate of elimination.
