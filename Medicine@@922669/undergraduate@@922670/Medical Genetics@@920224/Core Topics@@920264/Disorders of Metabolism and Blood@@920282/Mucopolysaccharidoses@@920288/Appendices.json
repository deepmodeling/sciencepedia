The target enzyme is $\\alpha$-L-iduronidase (IDUA), the deficiency of which causes Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). The assay uses a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-$\\alpha$-L-iduronide, and reports product formation as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) released per hour per milligram of protein. To assess assay validity and pH dependence, reactions are run in parallel at an acidic pH approximating lysosomal conditions and at neutral pH, each with a matched heat-inactivated control. A concurrently run laboratory normal control verifies assay performance. A second, unrelated lysosomal hydrolase is measured in the patient sample as a process control to assess specimen integrity.\n\nFundamental bases to use:\n- Enzyme activity is defined operationally as the rate of product formation per unit time per unit enzyme or per unit protein; for a fluorogenic hydrolase, this is proportional to the slope of product accumulation with time under initial rate conditions.\n- Ionizable active-site residues in lysosomal hydrolases confer pH dependence, with maximal activity in the acidic range; thus, activity measured at lysosomal pH should be substantially higher than at neutral pH for a functioning enzyme.\n- Heat inactivation abolishes catalytic activity, leaving only non-enzymatic background; subtracting the heat-inactivated rate from the active rate estimates net enzymatic activity.\n- In a heterozygous carrier for an autosomal recessive enzyme deficiency, the expected enzyme concentration (and hence activity under substrate-excess, initial rate conditions) is typically approximately half of the normal mean in the same tissue under the same assay conditions.\n- Technical artifact is suggested by inconsistent findings across controls, global failure of other lysosomal enzymes in the same specimen, or signals dominated by background/autohydrolysis not corrected by controls.\n\nData:\n- Patient sample, IDUA at acidic pH $4.5$ (triplicate active reactions): $0.4$, $0.5$, $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n- Patient sample, IDUA heat-inactivated at pH $4.5$ (triplicate): $0.3$, $0.3$, $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n- Patient sample, IDUA at neutral pH $7.4$ (triplicate active reactions): $0.3$, $0.3$, $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n- Patient sample, IDUA heat-inactivated at pH $7.4$ (triplicate): $0.3$, $0.3$, $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n- Laboratory normal control, IDUA at pH $4.5$ (triplicate active reactions): $22$, $21$, $23$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$; heat-inactivated: $0.3$, $0.3$, $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n- Patient sample, acid $\\beta$-glucosidase (process control enzyme) at pH $4.5$ (triplicate active reactions): $9$, $10$, $8$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$; laboratory reference interval for this assay: $7$–$15$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$.\n\nQuestion: Using the fundamentals above, compute the net IDUA activity in the patient at pH $4.5$ and pH $7.4$, compare these to the concurrently run normal control at pH $4.5$, and integrate the process control enzyme result to decide which interpretation best fits the data:\n\nA.

It provides a complete dataset from a lysosomal enzyme assay, including all necessary controls, and asks for a logical interpretation based on fundamental biochemical and genetic principles. All provided data are scientifically plausible and internally consistent.\n\nThe first step is to compute the net enzyme activities by subtracting the background rate (from heat-inactivated controls) from the total rate (from active reactions). For each condition, the mean of the triplicate measurements will be used.

This confirms the integrity of the patient's leukocyte sample and shows that the profound deficiency is specific to IDUA, not a general problem with lysosomal function or sample preparation.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n-   Net Patient IDUA Activity (pH $4.5$): $0.1$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$\n-   Net Normal Control IDUA Activity (pH $4.5$): $21.7$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$\n-   Patient activity as a percentage of normal: $$ \\left(\\frac{0.1}{21.7}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 0.46\\% $$\n-   Patient Process Control Enzyme: Normal activity.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this quantitative analysis.\n\n**A. Technical artifact causing falsely low IDUA due to substrate autohydrolysis or fluorescence interference.**\nThis option suggests the low activity is an artifact. The data contradict this. First, substrate autohydrolysis or other background signals are measured by the heat-inactivated control, which consistently shows a rate of $0.3$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$. The net activity calculation correctly subtracts this background. Second, the concurrently run laboratory normal control yielded a high net activity of $21.7$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, proving the assay system is working correctly and can detect high enzyme activity when present. Third, and most critically, the patient's process control enzyme (acid $\\beta$-glucosidase) is within the normal range. This rules out a sample-specific issue such as an inhibitor, poor sample quality, or incorrect protein measurement that would affect enzymes globally. The defect is specific to IDUA.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Heterozygous carrier for MPS I with approximately half-normal IDUA activity.**\nA heterozygous carrier for an autosomal recessive disorder is expected to have approximately $50\\%$ of the normal mean enzyme activity. Based on the normal control's net activity of $21.7$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, a carrier's activity would be approximately $$ 0.50 \\times 21.7 = 10.85 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1} $$ The patient's measured net activity is $0.1$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, which is approximately $0.46\\%$ of normal. This is profoundly deficient and is nowhere near the $50\\%$ level expected for a carrier.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. True deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase consistent with MPS I.**\nThe patient's net IDUA activity ($0.1$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$) is less than $1\\%$ of the normal control activity ($21.7$ $\\mathrm{nmol}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$). Such a profound reduction in enzyme activity is the definitive biochemical finding for a patient affected with the corresponding autosomal recessive disorder, in this case, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). The specificity of this finding is confirmed by the normal activity of the unrelated process control enzyme. All data points—the severely low IDUA activity, the correct pH profile (no activity at pH $7.4$), and the normal process control—coherently support the diagnosis of a true $\\alpha$-L-iduronidase deficiency.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Pseudodeficiency allele that lowers activity only against the artificial substrate but not physiological substrates.**\nA pseudodeficiency allele is a variant that causes low activity in a laboratory assay using an artificial substrate but does not cause disease because activity toward the natural substrate is sufficient. While this is a theoretical possibility for any enzyme assay, the presented data itself provides no evidence to support this specific conclusion over that of a true deficiency. The most direct and parsimonious interpretation of a profoundly deficient enzyme assay, which is the gold standard for diagnosis, is that the patient has a true deficiency leading to disease. Without additional information (e.g., normal urinary glycosaminoglycan levels, specific molecular testing identifying a known pseudodeficiency allele), invoking pseudodeficiency is speculative. The data best fits the classic pattern of a true, disease-causing deficiency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5062248"}, {"introduction": "The clinical signs of MPS arise from a molecular \"traffic jam\" inside the cell's lysosomes, where undegraded molecules accumulate.
