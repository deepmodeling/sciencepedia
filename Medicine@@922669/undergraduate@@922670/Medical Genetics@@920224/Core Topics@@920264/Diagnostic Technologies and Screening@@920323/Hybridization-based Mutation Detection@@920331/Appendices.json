The concept of mosaicism and the calculation of an average copy number from different cell subpopulations are central to interpreting aCGH data from heterogeneous samples like tumors. All provided data are consistent (cell fractions sum to $1.00$), and the question is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive a unique solution.

A positive log-ratio indicates that $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{test}}}{I_{\\mathrm{ref}}}  1$, which in turn implies that the average copy number in the test sample is greater than the reference copy number ($\\langle CN_{\\mathrm{test}} \\rangle = 2.1  CN_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2$). This signifies a net gain of genetic material at this locus across the mixed cell population.\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of $r$ is small ($|r| \\approx 0.07$). For comparison, a non-mosaic sample with a pure single-copy duplication ($CN=3$) would yield $r = \\log_{2}(3/2) = \\log_{2}(1.5) \\approx +0.585$, while a pure heterozygous deletion ($CN=1$) would yield $r = \\log_{2}(1/2) = -1.0$. The small positive value calculated here is characteristic of mosaicism, where the copy-number change is present in only a fraction of cells.
