In MLPA, the total amplicon size is engineered using a non-hybridizing stuffer sequence to ensure that each probe’s PCR product has a distinct length that can be separated by Capillary Electrophoresis (CE). Consider an MLPA probe whose final PCR product is designed to have a total length of $280$ base pairs.

The principle that CE separates DNA fragments based on length-dependent mobility in a sieving polymer is a cornerstone of molecular biology techniques. The given lengths are realistic for a typical MLPA assay. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient, non-contradictory information to calculate the stuffer sequence length. The total length is the sum of its components, a well-defined relationship. The question is unambiguous and has a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total length of an MLPA amplicon, denoted $L_{total}$, is the sum of the lengths of its constituent parts. These parts are: the two target-specific hybridizing arms ($L_{hybrid}$), the two universal primer sequences that bind to the probe for amplification ($L_{primer}$), and the non-hybridizing stuffer sequence ($L_{stuffer}$) used to adjust the total length.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n$$L_{total} = L_{hybrid} + L_{primer} + L_{stuffer}$$\nThe problem provides the values for $L_{total}$, $L_{hybrid}$, and $L_{primer}$. We are tasked with computing $L_{stuffer}$. The equation can be rearranged to solve for $L_{stuffer}$:\n$$L_{stuffer} = L_{total} - L_{hybrid} - L_{primer}$$\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n- $L_{total} = 280$ bp\n- $L_{hybrid} = 80$ bp\n- $L_{primer} = 20$ bp\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$L_{stuffer} = 280 - 80 - 20$$\n$$L_{stuffer} = 200 - 20$$\n$$L_{stuffer} = 180 \\text{ bp}$$\nThe required length of the stuffer sequence is $180$ base pairs.\n\n### Explanation of Electrophoretic Resolution\nThe second part of the problem requires an explanation of how stuffer length affects amplicon resolution in a multiplex assay, based on the first principles of electrophoretic separation.\n\n1.  **Principle of Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) for DNA**: In CE, DNA fragments are separated in a capillary filled with a sieving polymer matrix. DNA has a constant negative charge-to-mass ratio due to its phosphate backbone. When an electric field is applied, all DNA fragments are driven towards the anode. Without a sieving matrix, fragments of different sizes would migrate at nearly the same velocity. The polymer matrix acts as a molecular sieve, creating a size-dependent drag.\n\n2.  **Fragment Length and Mobility**: The electrophoretic mobility, $\\mu$, of a DNA fragment is inversely related to its length, $N$ (in base pairs). Larger fragments ($N$ is high) interact more with the polymer network, experience greater frictional drag, and thus migrate more slowly through the capillary. Smaller fragments move more quickly. This difference in migration speed is the basis for separation.\n\n3.  **Role of Stuffer Length in Multiplexing**: A multiplex MLPA assay simultaneously analyzes multiple genomic targets. To distinguish the signal from each target, each probe pair is designed to produce an amplicon of a unique and predetermined total length. The stuffer sequence is the variable component used to engineer these unique lengths. For instance, probes for Target A, Target B, and Target C might be designed with different stuffer lengths to yield total amplicons of $272$ bp, $280$ bp, and $288$ bp, respectively.\n\n4.  **Resolution and Separability**: Resolution in CE is the measure of how well two adjacent peaks (representing two different amplicons) are separated. For two fragments to be resolved, the difference in their migration times must be large enough relative to their peak widths. The difference in total amplicon length, $\\Delta L_{total}$, between two probes directly translates into a difference in migration time. A larger $\\Delta L_{total}$ generally leads to a greater separation in time, improving resolution. Therefore, the choice of stuffer lengths across the probe set is critical. The lengths must be chosen so that the resulting $\\Delta L_{total}$ for any two adjacent amplicons in the size series is sufficient to achieve baseline separation, preventing peak overlap and ensuring accurate quantification. The stuffer length is thus the key design parameter that enables the simultaneous, distinguishable analysis of multiple DNA sequences in a single reaction.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{180} $$", "id": "5063687"}, {"introduction": "Raw data from an MLPA experiment, such as peak areas, is just the beginning; the key to a meaningful result lies in robust normalization.

It requires the construction of a data normalization strategy from first principles and its application to a provided dataset.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the principles of MLPA into a mathematical model. The observed peak area, $A$, for a given probe depends on several factors: the initial copy number of the target sequence in the DNA sample, $N$; the intrinsic efficiency of the probe, $E$; and a sample-specific scaling factor, $K$, that accounts for variations in sample loading, amplification, and detection between electrophoresis runs.\n\nFor a specific probe $i$ in a sample $s$, the peak area $A_{i,s}$ can be modeled as being directly proportional to these factors:\n$$A_{i,s} = K_s \\cdot E_i \\cdot N_{i,s}$$\nHere, $s$ can be either the patient sample ($P$) or the control sample ($C$). The index $i$ can denote either the test probe ($t$) or one of the $n$ reference probes ($r=1, ..., n$). The problem states that $n=5$.\n\nThe problem specifies that:\n1. Probe-specific efficiencies, $E_i$, are consistent across samples. This is captured by $E_i$ not having a sample-specific subscript $s$.\n2. A multiplicative scaling factor, $K_s$, affects all probes equally within a given sample. This is captured by $K_s$ not having a probe-specific subscript $i$.\n3. Reference probes are copy-number stable, meaning their copy number is the same in the patient and control samples. We can express this as $N_{r,P} = N_{r,C}$ for all reference probes $r$. Typically, in diploid organisms, the copy number for stable autosomal genes is $2$, so we assume $N_{r,P} = N_{r,C} = N_{ref}$, where $N_{ref}$ is the reference copy number. The control sample is also assumed to have a normal copy number for the test probe's target, so $N_{t,C} = N_{ref}$.\n\nThe goal is to determine the Dosage Quotient ($DQ$), which is defined as the copy number ratio of the test probe's target in the patient versus the control sample:\n$$DQ = \\frac{N_{t,P}}{N_{t,C}}$$\n\nTo compute this, we must devise a normalization strategy that eliminates the unknown factors $K_s$ and $E_i$. A robust method is to first normalize the test probe signal within each sample against the reference probes from that same sample. This intra-sample normalization cancels the sample-specific scaling factor $K_s$. Let us define a normalized ratio, $R_s$, for each sample $s$ by dividing the test probe's area by the sum of the areas of all reference probes.\n\nFor any sample $s$, this ratio is:\n$$R_s = \\frac{A_{t,s}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{n} A_{r,s}} = \\frac{K_s E_t N_{t,s}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{n} (K_s E_r N_{r,s})} = \\frac{K_s E_t N_{t,s}}{K_s \\sum_{r=1}^{n} (E_r N_{r,s})} = \\frac{E_t N_{t,s}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,s}}$$\nThis ratio $R_s$ is independent of the sample-specific factor $K_s$.\n\nNow we can compare the normalized ratio of the patient sample, $R_P$, to that of the control sample, $R_C$.\nFor the patient sample:\n$$R_P = \\frac{E_t N_{t,P}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,P}}$$\nFor the control sample:\n$$R_C = \\frac{E_t N_{t,C}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,C}}$$\nThe Dosage Quotient, $DQ$, is the ratio of $R_P$ to $R_C$:\n$$DQ = \\frac{R_P}{R_C} = \\frac{E_t N_{t,P} / \\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,P}}{E_t N_{t,C} / \\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,C}}$$\nUsing the assumption that the reference probes are copy-number stable ($N_{r,P} = N_{r,C}$), the summation terms in the denominators become identical: $\\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,P} = \\sum_{r=1}^{n} E_r N_{r,C}$.\nThe expression for $DQ$ simplifies elegantly:\n$$DQ = \\frac{E_t N_{t,P}}{E_t N_{t,C}} = \\frac{N_{t,P}}{N_{t,C}}$$\nThis confirms that the constructed normalization strategy correctly isolates the desired copy number ratio. The final working formula for $DQ$ is:\n$$DQ = \\frac{ A_{t,P} / \\sum_{r=1}^{n} A_{r,P} }{ A_{t,C} / \\sum_{r=1}^{n} A_{r,C} }$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the provided data.\nGiven data for the control sample:\nTest probe area, $A_{t,C} = 950$.\nReference probe areas: $800, 950, 1100, 900, 1000$.\nSum of reference probe areas for the control:\n$$\\sum_{r=1}^{5} A_{r,C} = 800 + 950 + 1100 + 900 + 1000 = 4750$$\nThe normalized ratio for the control is:\n$$R_C = \\frac{A_{t,C}}{\\sum_{r} A_{r,C}} = \\frac{950}{4750}$$\n\nGiven data for the patient sample:\nTest probe area, $A_{t,P} = 430$.\nReference probe areas: $720, 855, 990, 810, 900$.\nSum of reference probe areas for the sample:\n$$\\sum_{r=1}^{5} A_{r,P} = 720 + 855 + 990 + 810 + 900 = 4275$$\nThe normalized ratio for the patient sample is:\n$$R_P = \\frac{A_{t,P}}{\\sum_{r} A_{r,P}} = \\frac{430}{4275}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Dosage Quotient $DQ$:\n$$DQ = \\frac{R_P}{R_C} = \\frac{430 / 4275}{950 / 4750} = \\frac{430}{4275} \\times \\frac{4750}{950}$$\nWe can simplify the fraction $\\frac{4750}{950} = \\frac{475}{95} = 5$.\n$$DQ = \\frac{430}{4275} \\times 5 = \\frac{2150}{4275}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$DQ \\approx 0.5029239766...$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$$DQ \\approx 0.503$$\nAccording to the provided interpretation thresholds, a $DQ$ value near $0.5$ indicates a heterozygous deletion.

Assume the following foundational facts: (i) MLPA peak areas are proportional to target copy number per haploid genome equivalent contributed in the mixture, (ii) each cell contributes equally to the extracted DNA, (iii) a normal diploid cell has $2$ copies at the probed locus, and a cell with a heterozygous deletion has $1$ copy, and (iv) under equal normalization, the scaling factor is set by unaffected reference probes so that their normalized signals are $1$ on average, and the expected normalized signal for a $2$-copy state is $1$.

Mosaicism is the presence of two or more cell populations with different genotypes within a single individual, where these populations have originated from a single zygote. In the context of this problem and MLPA analysis for copy number variations, mosaicism refers to the condition where the analyzed DNA sample is a mixture derived from at least two distinct cell lines: one cell line with a normal diploid copy number at a specific locus, and another cell line with an aberrant copy number (e.g., a deletion or duplication) at the same locus. The consequence for MLPA signal interpretation is that the measured signal for a probe targeting the mosaic locus will not correspond to a simple integer copy number. Instead, the signal, and consequently the calculated Dosage Quotient ($DQ$), will be a weighted average reflecting the proportional contribution of each cell line to the bulk DNA sample. This results in a $DQ$ value that falls between the discrete values expected for non-mosaic states (e.g., between $0.5$ for a heterozygous deletion and $1.0$ for a normal diploid state).\n\nNext, we derive the expected Dosage Quotient, $DQ$, as a function of the mosaic fraction, $f$.\n\nLet $S$ represent the raw signal intensity (e.g., peak area) from an MLPA probe. According to assumption (i), this signal is directly proportional to the number of target DNA copies, $C$, present in the sample. We can express this relationship as:\n$$S = k \\cdot C$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nThe DNA sample under analysis is a mixture of two cell populations.\n1.  A fraction $f$ of the cells has a heterozygous deletion at the target locus. According to assumption (iii), these cells have a copy number $C_{del} = 1$.\n2.  The remaining fraction, $1 - f$, consists of normal diploid cells. According to assumption (iii), these cells have a copy number $C_{norm} = 2$.\n\nBased on assumption (ii), each cell contributes equally to the total extracted DNA. Therefore, the average copy number per cell, $\\bar{C}_{test}$, for the test probe at the affected locus is the weighted average of the copy numbers of the two populations:\n$$\\bar{C}_{test} = f \\cdot C_{del} + (1 - f) \\cdot C_{norm}$$\nSubstituting the copy number values:\n$$\\bar{C}_{test} = f \\cdot 1 + (1 - f) \\cdot 2 = f + 2 - 2f = 2 - f$$\n\nThe raw signal for the test probe, $S_{test,raw}$, is proportional to this average copy number:\n$$S_{test,raw} = k \\cdot \\bar{C}_{test} = k(2 - f)$$\n\nNormalization is performed using signals from unaffected reference probes. These probes target loci where all cells in the sample are diploid, so their copy number is $C_{ref} = 2$. The raw signal for a reference probe is:\n$$S_{ref,raw} = k \\cdot C_{ref} = k \\cdot 2 = 2k$$\n\nAccording to assumption (iv), the normalization procedure adjusts the signals such that the normalized signal for these unaffected reference probes averages to $1$. The normalized signal, $S_{norm}$, is obtained by dividing the raw signal by a normalization factor, $N$.\n$$S_{ref,norm} = \\frac{S_{ref,raw}}{N} = \\frac{2k}{N} = 1$$\nFrom this, we can determine the normalization factor $N$:\n$$N = 2k$$\n\nThis same normalization factor is applied to the test probe's raw signal to obtain its normalized signal, $S_{test,norm}$:\n$$S_{test,norm} = \\frac{S_{test,raw}}{N} = \\frac{k(2 - f)}{2k}$$\nThe proportionality constant $k$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$S_{test,norm} = \\frac{2 - f}{2} = 1 - \\frac{f}{2}$$\n\nFinally, the Dosage Quotient ($DQ$) is defined as the normalized ratio of the test sample signal to the expected signal for a disomic ($2$-copy) state.
