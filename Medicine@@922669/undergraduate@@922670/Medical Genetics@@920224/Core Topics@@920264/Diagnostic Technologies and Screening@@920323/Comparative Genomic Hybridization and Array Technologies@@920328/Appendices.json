A fraction $p$ of cells has copy number $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}}$, and the remaining fraction $(1-p)$ has the normal diploid copy number of $2$. The measured intensity from a bulk sample reflects the average copy number of the cell population. The average copy number, $\\text{CN}_{\\text{avg}}$, in the sample is the weighted average of the copy numbers of the subpopulations:\n$$\\text{CN}_{\\text{avg}} = p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + (1-p) \\cdot 2$$\nThe total intensity from the sample is therefore proportional to this average copy number:\n$$I_{\\text{sample}} = k \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{avg}} = k \\cdot (p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2(1-p))$$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $I_{\\text{sample}}$ and $I_{\\text{reference}}$ into the definition of $r$:\n$$r = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{k \\cdot (p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2(1-p))}{k \\cdot 2}\\right)$$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ cancels, which is critical for the robustness of the measurement:\n$$r = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2 - 2p}{2}\\right)$$\nThis is the quantitative model for $r$ in terms of $p$ and $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}}$.\n\nThe second step is to algebraically solve this model for $p$. We begin with the derived model:\n$$r = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2 - 2p}{2}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $p$, we first exponentiate both sides with base $2$:\n$$2^r = \\frac{p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2 - 2p}{2}$$\nMultiply both sides by $2$:\n$$2 \\cdot 2^r = 2^{r+1} = p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} + 2 - 2p$$\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms containing $p$:\n$$2^{r+1} - 2 = p \\cdot \\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} - 2p$$\nFactor out $p$ from the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$2^{r+1} - 2 = p(\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} - 2)$$\nFinally, we solve for $p$ by dividing by $(\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} - 2)$, assuming $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} \\neq 2$ (if $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} = 2$, the sample is purely diploid and $r=0$ for any $p$):\n$$p = \\frac{2^{r+1} - 2}{\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} - 2}$$\nThis equation expresses the mosaic fraction $p$ as a function of the measured log-ratio $r$ and the copy number of the altered cell population $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}}$.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $p$ for the given values: a single-copy loss, where $\\text{CN}_{\\text{alt}} = 1$, and a measured log-ratio of $r = -0.321928094$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{2^{(-0.321928094) + 1} - 2}{1 - 2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{2^{0.678071906} - 2}{-1}$$\n$$p = 2 - 2^{0.678071906}$$\nWe can also write this as $p = 2(1 - 2^r)$.\n$$p = 2(1 - 2^{-0.321928094})$$\nThe specific numeric value $r = -0.321928094$ is the high-precision decimal representation of $\\log_{2}(0.8)$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of comparative genomic hybridization, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is stated objectively without ambiguity. All provided data and definitions are consistent and physically realistic within the context of microarray experiments.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two parts as requested by the problem statement: a justification for using sex-matched references and a calculation of the genome-wide mean baseline offset for a sex-mismatched experiment.\n\nFirst, we analyze the expected log-ratio $L$ for different genomic regions. The expected intensity $I$ for a locus with absolute copy number $C$ is given by the model $I = aC + b$, with $a > 0$ and $b \\ge 0$. The background $b$ is given as a fraction of a single-copy intensity, $b = \\alpha a$, where $\\alpha = 0.05$.

Thus, $C_{\\text{sample}} = 2$ and $C_{\\text{reference}} = 2$.\n    The expected log-ratio is:\n    $$L_{\\text{autosome}} = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2 + \\alpha}{2 + \\alpha}\\right) = \\log_{2}(1) = 0$$\n    This is the expected value for a region with no copy number difference.\n\n2.  **Chromosome X**: For loci on chromosome X, the $\\text{XY}$ sample has one copy ($C_{\\text{sample}} = 1$) and the $\\text{XX}$ reference has two copies ($C_{\\text{reference}} = 2$).\n    The expected log-ratio is:\n    $$L_{X} = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{1 + \\alpha}{2 + \\alpha}\\right)$$\n    Since $1+\\alpha < 2+\\alpha$, $L_{X}$ will be a negative value, artifactually appearing as a copy number loss.\n\n3.  **Chromosome Y**: For loci on chromosome Y, the $\\text{XY}$ sample has one copy ($C_{\\text{sample}} = 1$) and the $\\text{XX}$ reference has zero copies ($C_{\\text{reference}} = 0$).\n    The expected log-ratio is:\n    $$L_{Y} = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{1 + \\alpha}{0 + \\alpha}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{1 + \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)$$\n    Since $1+\\alpha > \\alpha$, $L_{Y}$ will be a positive value, artifactually appearing as a copy number gain.

These deviations are not indicative of any pathology in the test sample but are artifacts of the experimental comparison. They complicate the interpretation of results for the sex chromosomes and can skew genome-wide normalization procedures that often assume the median or mean log-ratio across all probes is zero. In contrast, a sex-matched reference (e.g., $\\text{XY}$ vs. $\\text{XY}$) would have $C_{\\text{sample}} = C_{\\text{reference}}$ for all chromosomes (assuming a normal karyotype), resulting in an expected log-ratio of $L=0$ across the entire genome. This provides a clean baseline, simplifying data analysis and the detection of true aneuploidies or structural variations.\n\n**Calculation of the Genome-Wide Mean Baseline Offset:**\nThe genome-wide mean baseline offset, which we denote as $\\bar{L}$, is the average of the expected log-ratios across all probes on the array.
