The sonographer measures a Nuchal Translucency (NT) thickness of $2.8$ mm. The population reference for this CRL indicates an expected median NT of $1.5$ mm. In first-trimester genetic screening, risk modeling commonly uses standardized representations of markers: the difference from the expected median (denoted $\\Delta \\mathrm{NT}$), the Multiples of the Median (MoM), and a $z$-score that reflects how many Standard Deviations (SD) the measurement lies above or below the population mean at that gestational size.

In first-trimester screening, typical biomarkers include Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), free beta subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (free $\\beta$-hCG), and Nuchal Translucency (NT). The MoM for a marker is defined as $ \\text{MoM} = \\dfrac{\\text{observed concentration}}{\\text{expected median concentration at the same gestational age}} $, where the expected median concentration is estimated for a defined reference population. It is well established that maternal covariates such as maternal weight, smoking status, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) alter the expected median concentrations through empirically determined scaling factors derived from population models, and that these effects are treated multiplicatively under the assumption that each covariate independently scales the expected median.\n\nStarting from the definition of MoM and the concept that covariates scale the expected median by strictly positive multiplicative factors, derive the mathematical relationship between a raw MoM (computed against a reference median without covariate adjustment) and an adjusted MoM that normalizes the raw MoM to the reference population with no covariate effects. Assume the following covariates apply: maternal weight of 90 $\\text{kg}$, smoker, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and that the corresponding correction factors are given as $c_w = 0.85$, $c_{\\text{smk}} = 1.1$, and $c_{\\text{DM1}} = 0.9$. The correction factors are defined such that each one represents the multiplicative scaling of the expected median attributable to the covariate relative to the reference state, with all factors strictly positive.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each test case below, computes the adjusted MoMs for a fixed marker order: PAPP-A, free $\\beta$-hCG, NT, using the covariate correction factors specified above.
