The explicit mention of a \"rare-event approximation\" and the approximation $G - L + 1 \\approx G$ are standard and valid in this context, making the problem well-structured for a solution.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\nThe problem requires finding the minimal integer probe length, $L$, such that the probability of observing at least one unintended perfect match in the genome is at most $10^{-6}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable for the number of unintended perfect matches. The total length of the haploid genome is $G = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs. A probe of length $L$ can potentially start at any of the first $G-L+1$ positions. Since one of these positions is the intended target, the number of unintended loci to consider is $n = (G-L+1) - 1 = G-L$. Given that $G \\gg L$, we can approximate this number as $n \\approx G$. The problem statement assumes approximately $G$ independent trials. To be slightly more precise, let's consider the number of unintended sites to be $n=G-1$, which is also excellently approximated by $G$.\n\nAt each unintended locus, the probability of a perfect match, $p$, is given by the probability of matching each of the $L$ bases independently. With four equally likely bases, this probability is:\n$$ p = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{L} = 4^{-L} $$\n\nThe number of unintended matches, $N$, follows a binomial distribution, $N \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, where $n \\approx G$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the success probability per trial. Since $n$ is very large (on the order of $10^9$) and $p$ is very small, we can use the Poisson approximation, as suggested by the problem's reference to \"rare-event approximations.\" The distribution of $N$ is well-approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = np$.\n$$ \\lambda = n \\cdot p \\approx G \\cdot p = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot 4^{-L} $$\n\nThe problem specifies the constraint on the probability of at least one unintended match:\n$$ P(N \\geq 1) \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nFor a Poisson-distributed variable, the probability of observing at least one event is $P(N \\geq 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$. The probability of zero events is $P(N=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$ 1 - e^{-\\lambda} \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nFor a very small upper bound on probability, such as $10^{-6}$, the expression $1 - e^{-\\lambda}$ can be approximated by $\\lambda$. This comes from the Taylor expansion $e^{-\\lambda} \\approx 1 - \\lambda$ for small $\\lambda$, which makes $1 - e^{-\\lambda} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\lambda) = \\lambda$. Thus, the condition simplifies to a constraint on the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of $L$:\n$$ (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot 4^{-L} \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n\nWe can now solve this inequality for $L$. First, we isolate the term containing $L$:\n$$ 4^{-L} \\leq \\frac{10^{-6}}{3.2 \\times 10^{9}} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ 4^{L} \\geq \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{9}}{10^{-6}} $$\n$$ 4^{L} \\geq 3.2 \\times 10^{15} $$\n\nTo solve for $L$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(4^{L}) \\geq \\ln(3.2 \\times 10^{15}) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$ L \\ln(4) \\geq \\ln(3.2) + \\ln(10^{15}) $$\n$$ L \\cdot (2 \\ln(2)) \\geq \\ln(3.2) + 15 \\ln(10) $$\nIsolating $L$ gives:\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{\\ln(3.2) + 15 \\ln(10)}{2 \\ln(2)} $$\n\nBy substituting the numerical values of the logarithms ($\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$, $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30259$, $\\ln(3.2) \\approx 1.16315$):\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{1.16315 + 15(2.30259)}{2(0.69315)} $$\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{1.16315 + 34.53885}{1.3863} $$\n$$ L \\geq \\frac{35.702}{1.3863} $$\n$$ L \\geq 25.7529... $$\n\nSince the probe length $L$ must be an integer, we must choose the smallest integer that satisfies this condition.

We can expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ P(T^+) = (\\text{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - \\pi) $$\nTherefore, the full expression for PPV is:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Se})(\\pi)}{(\\text{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - \\pi)} $$\n\nThe NPV is the post-test probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, defined as $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. We expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ P(T^-) = (\\text{Sp})(1 - \\pi) + (1 - \\text{Se})(\\pi) $$\nTherefore, the full expression for NPV is:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Sp})(1 - \\pi)}{(\\text{Sp})(1 - \\pi) + (1 - \\text{Se})(\\pi)} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for PPV and NPV using the given parameters: $\\text{Se} = 0.98$, $\\text{Sp} = 0.995$, and $\\pi = 0.02$.\n\nFor the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.98)(0.02)}{(0.98)(0.02) + (1 - 0.995)(1 - 0.02)} = \\frac{0.0196}{0.0196 + (0.005)(0.98)} = \\frac{0.0196}{0.0196 + 0.0049} = \\frac{0.0196}{0.0245} = 0.8 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} = 0.8000$.\n\nFor the NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.995)(1 - 0.02)}{(0.995)(1 - 0.02) + (1 - 0.98)(0.02)} = \\frac{(0.995)(0.98)}{(0.995)(0.98) + (0.02)(0.02)} = \\frac{0.9751}{0.9751 + 0.0004} = \\frac{0.9751}{0.9755} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9995899538698104... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} = 0.9996$.\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation of these values and a comparison with spectral karyotyping (SKY) is required.\nA PPV of $0.8000$ indicates that for a patient in this high-risk cohort who receives a positive FISH result, there is an $80.00\\%$ probability that the fetus is actually affected with trisomy $21$. While this is a high probability, it also means there is a $20.00\\%$ chance the result is a false positive. This significant residual uncertainty makes it ethically and medically imperative to recommend a definitive, diagnostic confirmatory test, such as a full karyotype analysis from cultured amniocytes or chorionic villus sampling, before any irreversible clinical decisions (e.g., pregnancy termination) are considered.\nAn NPV of $0.9996$ is extremely high. It signifies that a negative FISH result is highly reassuring, with a $99.96\\%$ probability that the fetus is not affected by trisomy $21$. The post-test probability of having the disease despite the negative result is only $1 - 0.9996 = 0.0004$, or $1$ in $2500$. For most patients, this level of certainty is sufficient to rule out trisomy $21$, and no further invasive testing for this specific aneuploidy would be indicated.\nThe role of FISH is thus a rapid screening or preliminary test. Its main advantage is speed (results in $24-48$ hours), which reduces parental anxiety. However, it is targeted only to specific chromosomes. In contrast, spectral karyotyping (SKY), like conventional G-banded karyotyping, provides a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of all chromosomes but requires cell culture and has a longer turnaround time ($1-2$ weeks). SKY is superior for detecting complex chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., translocations, insertions, deletions) that are invisible to a targeted FISH panel. Therefore, the strategy is to use FISH for rapid risk assessment. A positive FISH result mandates confirmation with a full karyotype (or SKY for complex cases) to ensure diagnostic accuracy and to assess the entire chromosome complement for abnormalities that FISH would miss. SKY acts as the gold-standard diagnostic tool, whereas FISH functions as a highly effective triage instrument.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8000  0.9996\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "5031352"}]}
