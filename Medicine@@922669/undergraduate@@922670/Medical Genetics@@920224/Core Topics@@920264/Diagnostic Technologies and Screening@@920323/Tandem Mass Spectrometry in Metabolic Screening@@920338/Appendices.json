A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nLet $C_A$ represent the concentration of the analyte (C8-carnitine) and $C_{IS}$ represent the concentration of the internal standard. Let $R_A$ and $R_{IS}$ be the instrument responses (peak areas) for the analyte and internal standard, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the instrument signal is proportional to the concentration. This can be written as two equations:\n$$R_A = k_A \\cdot C_A$$\n$$R_{IS} = k_{IS} \\cdot C_{IS}$$\nwhere $k_A$ and $k_{IS}$ are the respective response factors, which are constants of proportionality.\n\nThe analyte-to-internal-standard area ratio, which we will denote as $Y$, is defined as:\n$$Y = \\frac{R_A}{R_{IS}}$$\n\nSubstituting the proportionality expressions into the equation for the ratio $Y$ gives:\n$$Y = \\frac{k_A \\cdot C_A}{k_{IS} \\cdot C_{IS}}$$\n\nThis relationship can be rearranged to express the ratio $Y$ as a function of the analyte concentration $C_A$:\n$$Y = \\left(\\frac{k_A}{k_{IS} \\cdot C_{IS}}\\right) \\cdot C_A$$\n\nIn isotope-dilution mass spectrometry, the internal standard is added at a fixed concentration, $C_{IS}$, to all samples and calibrators. The response factors $k_A$ and $k_{IS}$ are also considered constant under stable instrument conditions. Therefore, the term in the parenthesis is a constant. Let's define this constant as the slope, $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{k_A}{k_{IS} \\cdot C_{IS}}$$\n\nThe equation for the ratio $Y$ now takes the form of a linear equation with a zero intercept, which is consistent with the problem statement:\n$$Y = m \\cdot C_A$$\n\nThis is the fundamental relationship of the calibration curve. The problem asks for the derivation of the relationship needed to compute the analyte concentration, $C_A$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, a clear objective (optimization of Youden's index), and an unambiguous tie-breaking rule. The language is objective and formal. The problem adheres to all criteria for validity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of two features, the absolute phenylalanine concentration ($\\text{Phe}$) and the phenylalanine-to-tyrosine ratio ($\\text{Phe}/\\text{Tyr}$), and to determine an optimal decision threshold for the ratio feature. The performance of a binary classifier based on a threshold $T$ is assessed by its sensitivity and specificity.\n\nLet $D_1$ denote the set of confirmed PKU cases (positives) and $D_0$ denote the set of controls (negatives). We are given $N_1 = |D_1| = 12$ and $N_0 = |D_0| = 21$.\nA specimen with feature value $x$ is classified as positive if $x \\geq T$ and negative if $x < T$. This leads to four outcomes:\n- True Positive (TP): A specimen from $D_1$ with $x \\geq T$.\n- False Negative (FN): A specimen from $D_1$ with $x < T$.\n- True Negative (TN): A specimen from $D_0$ with $x < T$.\n- False Positive (FP): A specimen from $D_0$ with $x \\geq T$.\n\nSensitivity, or True Positive Rate (TPR), is the fraction of positive cases correctly identified:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity(T)} = \\text{TPR}(T) = \\frac{\\text{TP}(T)}{N_1} $$\nSpecificity, or True Negative Rate (TNR), is the fraction of negative cases correctly identified:\n$$ \\text{Specificity(T)} = \\text{TNR}(T) = \\frac{\\text{TN}(T)}{N_0} $$\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of $\\text{TPR}$ versus the False Positive Rate ($\\text{FPR} = 1 - \\text{Specificity}$) for all possible thresholds $T$. A better classifier has an ROC curve that is closer to the point $(0, 1)$, which represents perfect classification.\n\nYouden’s index, $J(T)$, is a metric that captures the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test. It is defined as:\n$$ J(T) = \\text{Sensitivity}(T) + \\text{Specificity}(T) - 1 $$\nThe optimal threshold $T_{opt}$ is the one that maximizes $J(T)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the rationale for using the ratio $x = \\text{Phe}/\\text{Tyr}$. Phenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. This metabolic block leads to an accumulation of $\\text{Phe}$ and potentially a deficit of $\\text{Tyr}$. However, absolute concentrations of both amino acids can be influenced by other factors, such as dietary protein intake. By taking the ratio $\\text{Phe}/\\text{Tyr}$, we create a feature that is less sensitive to such common-mode variations and more specific to the enzymatic block itself. This normalization is expected to improve the separation between the feature distributions for the PKU and control populations. Better separation results in a superior ROC curve and a higher achievable Youden's index.\n\nLet's examine the two features with the given data.\nFor the feature $x = \\text{Phe}$:\n- PKU cases ($D_1$): concentrations range from $\\min(\\text{Phe}_1) = 280\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$ to $\\max(\\text{Phe}_1) = 700\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Controls ($D_0$): concentrations range from $\\min(\\text{Phe}_0) = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$ to $\\max(\\text{Phe}_0) = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$.\nThe ranges of the two populations overlap, since $\\max(\\text{Phe}_0) = 300 > \\min(\\text{Phe}_1) = 280$. This overlap implies that no threshold $T$ on the absolute $\\text{Phe}$ concentration can perfectly separate the two groups. Consequently, for any threshold $T$, either there will be false positives ($\\text{Specificity} < 1$) or false negatives ($\\text{Sensitivity} < 1$), or both. The maximum Youden's index will be less than $1$.\n\nNow, for the feature $x = \\text{Phe}/\\text{Tyr}$. We must compute the ratio for each specimen.\nFor the $N_1 = 12$ PKU cases, the ratios are:\n$400/60 \\approx 6.667$, $380/55 \\approx 6.909$, $420/70 = 6.000$, $500/65 \\approx 7.692$, $600/80 = 7.500$, $450/45 = 10.00$, $520/50 = 10.40$, $700/70 = 10.00$, $360/65 \\approx 5.538$, $310/80 = 3.875$, $280/85 \\approx 3.294$, $330/95 \\approx 3.474$.\nSorted ratios for PKU cases ($x_1$):\n$\\{3.294..., 3.474..., 3.875, 5.538..., 6.000, 6.667..., 6.909..., 7.500, 7.692..., 10.00, 10.00, 10.40 \\}$.\nThe minimum case ratio is $\\min(x_1) = 280/85$.\n\nFor the $N_0 = 21$ control cases, the ratios are:\n$65/95 \\approx 0.684$, $70/85 \\approx 0.824$, $55/90 \\approx 0.611$, $80/100 = 0.800$, $90/70 \\approx 1.286$, $110/75 \\approx 1.467$, $95/85 \\approx 1.118$, $50/100 = 0.500$, $120/80 = 1.500$, $130/95 \\approx 1.368$, $75/110 \\approx 0.682$, $85/105 \\approx 0.810$, $100/90 \\approx 1.111$, $105/100 = 1.050$, $150/100 = 1.500$, $160/70 \\approx 2.286$, $115/95 \\approx 1.211$, $125/70 \\approx 1.786$, $240/130 \\approx 1.846$, $260/140 \\approx 1.857$, $300/180 \\approx 1.667$.\nSorted ratios for controls ($x_0$):\n$\\{0.500, 0.611..., 0.682..., 0.684..., 0.800, 0.810..., 0.824..., 1.050, 1.111..., 1.118..., 1.211..., 1.286..., 1.368..., 1.467..., 1.500, 1.500, 1.667..., 1.786..., 1.846..., 1.857..., 2.286... \\}$.\nThe maximum control ratio is $\\max(x_0) = 160/70$.\n\nWe observe that $\\max(x_0) = 160/70 \\approx 2.286$ and $\\min(x_1) = 280/85 \\approx 3.294$.\nSince $\\max(x_0) < \\min(x_1)$, there is a clear separation between the two groups. Any threshold $T$ chosen in the interval $(\\max(x_0), \\min(x_1)]$ will perfectly classify all specimens in this dataset. Specifically, for any $T$ such that $160/70 < T \\leq 280/85$:\n- For all cases $x_i \\in D_1$, $x_i \\ge \\min(x_1) \\geq T$, so all $12$ cases are correctly classified as positive. Thus, $\\text{TP}(T) = 12$ and $\\text{FN}(T) = 0$, yielding $\\text{Sensitivity}(T) = 12/12 = 1$.\n- For all controls $x_j \\in D_0$, $x_j \\le \\max(x_0) < T$, so all $21$ controls are correctly classified as negative. Thus, $\\text{TN}(T) = 21$ and $\\text{FP}(T) = 0$, yielding $\\text{Specificity}(T) = 21/21 = 1$.\n\nFor any such threshold $T$, Youden's index is:\n$$ J(T) = \\text{Sensitivity}(T) + \\text{Specificity}(T) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 $$\nThis is the maximum possible value for Youden's index, confirming the superior discriminatory power of the ratio feature which enables perfect classification of this dataset. This corresponds to the point $(0,1)$ on the ROC curve.\n\nSince an entire interval of thresholds yields the maximum Youden's index, we must apply the specified tie-breaking rule: \"select the midpoint between the largest control ratio and the smallest case ratio\".\nThe largest control ratio is $\\max(x_0) = 160/70$.\nThe smallest case ratio is $\\min(x_1) = 280/85$.\n\nThe optimal threshold $T_{opt}$ is calculated as:\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\max(x_0) + \\min(x_1) \\right) $$\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{160}{70} + \\frac{280}{85} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the fractions:\n$$ \\frac{160}{70} = \\frac{16}{7} $$\n$$ \\frac{280}{85} = \\frac{5 \\times 56}{5 \\times 17} = \\frac{56}{17} $$\nNow, we compute the midpoint:\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{16}{7} + \\frac{56}{17} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{16 \\times 17}{7 \\times 17} + \\frac{56 \\times 7}{17 \\times 7} \\right) $$\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{272}{119} + \\frac{392}{119} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{272 + 392}{119} \\right) $$\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{664}{119} \\right) = \\frac{332}{119} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$ T_{opt} = \\frac{332}{119} \\approx 2.789915966... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.790$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.790}$$", "id": "5084924"}]}
