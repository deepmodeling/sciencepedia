The fundamental principles of HWE state that for a biallelic locus with allele frequencies $p$ and $q$, where $p+q=1$, the genotype frequencies in the population are $p^{2}$ for homozygous non-carriers, $2pq$ for heterozygous carriers, and $q^{2}$ for homozygous affected individuals.\n\nThe problem provides the carrier frequency, $f$, which is defined as the heterozygote frequency. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\nf = 2pq\n$$\nThe affected birth rate corresponds to the frequency of homozygous affected individuals in the population at birth, which is given by $q^{2}$. Our goal is to determine $q^{2}$ from the given value of $f$.\n\nThe problem specifies a derivation path that explicitly involves the concepts of \"couple risk\" and \"offspring risk\". Let us follow this path first.\n\n1.  **Couple Risk**: This is the probability that a randomly selected couple from the population both consist of heterozygous carriers. Assuming random mating, the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of an individual being a carrier is $f$. Thus, the probability that both partners in a couple are carriers is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Couple Risk} = f \\times f = f^2\n    $$\n\n2.  **Offspring Risk**: This is the conditional probability that a child is affected, given that both parents are heterozygous carriers. For an autosomal recessive trait, a mating between two heterozygotes ($Aa \\times Aa$) results in offspring with genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ in the Mendelian ratio of $1:2:1$. The probability of producing an affected ($aa$) offspring is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\text{Offspring Risk} = \\frac{1}{4}\n    $$\n\nCombining these two concepts, one might approximate the affected birth rate by multiplying the couple risk by the offspring risk. This calculates the proportion of births that are affected specifically from carrier-carrier unions:\n$$\n\\text{Affected Birth Rate (approx.)} = (\\text{Couple Risk}) \\times (\\text{Offspring Risk}) = f^2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{f^2}{4}\n$$\nThis calculation is a common and useful approximation in clinical genetics, as it correctly assumes that the vast majority of affected children are born to two carrier parents, especially when the disease is rare (i.e., $q$ is small). Matings involving an affected individual (who has genotype $aa$) are much rarer and contribute negligibly to the overall rate in such cases.\n\nHowever, the problem demands the **exact** expected affected birth rate. The exact rate under HWE is, by definition, $q^{2}$. To find this, we must establish the exact mathematical relationship between $q$ and $f$.\n\nWe start with the two fundamental HWE equations:\n1.  $p + q = 1 \\implies p = 1 - q$\n2.  $f = 2pq$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\nf = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^2\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation in terms of the variable $q$:\n$$\n2q^2 - 2q + f = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $q$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(2)(f)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8f}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}\n$$\nThis yields two possible solutions for $q$. For a recessive \"disease\", the affected allele ($q$) is typically the rarer of the two alleles, meaning its frequency must be less than $0.5$. The solution $q = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}$ would result in $q > 0.5$ (unless $f=0.5$, which makes $q=0.5$). The correct solution for a rare recessive allele is therefore the one with the negative sign:\n$$\nq = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2}\n$$\nThe exact affected birth rate is $q^2$. Squaring the expression for $q$, we obtain the exact affected birth rate as a function of the carrier frequency $f$:\n$$\n\\text{Affected Birth Rate} = q^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2f}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the given measured carrier frequency, $f = 0.04$, into this exact formula.\n$$\nq^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 2(0.04)}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nq^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 0.08}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{0.92}}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.92} \\approx 0.9591663\n$$\n$$\nq^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.9591663}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.0408337}{2} \\right)^2 = (0.02041685)^2\n$$\n$$\nq^2 \\approx 0.0004168476\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.0004168$.\nFor comparison, the approximate formula $\\frac{f^2}{4}$ would have given $\\frac{(0.04)^2}{4} = \\frac{0.0016}{4} = 0.0004$, which is close but not the exact value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0004168}\n$$", "id": "5029894"}, {"introduction": "Moving from population-level statistics to individual risk assessment is the core purpose of carrier screening.

It is a standard problem in medical genetics involving Mendelian inheritance and Bayesian inference.

Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the person is not a carrier. Thus, $P(T_f^- | \\neg C_f) = 1$ and $P(T_m^- | \\neg C_m) = 1$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive other conditional probabilities:\n- The false negative rate for the female's test is $P(T_f^- | C_f) = 1 - s_f = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\n- The false negative rate for the male's test is $P(T_m^- | C_m) = 1 - s_m = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- The false positive rate for both tests is $1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 1 = 0$. So, $P(T_f^+ | \\neg C_f) = 0$ and $P(T_m^+ | \\neg C_m) = 0$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the probability that the next child is affected, given the couple's test results: $P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-)$.\n\nFor an autosomal recessive condition with complete penetrance, a child is affected if and only if both parents are carriers and both transmit the recessive allele to the child. The probability of a carrier parent transmitting the recessive allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability of an affected child, given that both parents are carriers, is $P(A | C_f, C_m) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. If either parent is not a carrier, the probability of having an affected child is $0$.\n\nThe overall probability can be expressed as:\n$$P(A | T_f^+, T_m^-) = P(A | C_f, C_m) \\times P(C_f, C_m | T_f^+, T_m^-)$$\nSince the partners are unrelated, their carrier status is independent, and their test results are conditionally independent given their true carrier status.
