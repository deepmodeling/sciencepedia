The in silico PCR tolerance permits up to $m = 2$ mismatches anywhere except in the last two $3'$ bases, which must be exact matches.

Probability of a Reverse Primer Binding Site ($P_R$)**\nThe reverse primer binds to the minus strand. A match means the primer base is the Watson-Crick complement of the minus strand template base. If a primer base is, say, 'A', the minus strand must be 'T', which implies the plus strand must be 'A'. Due to the symmetry in the genome model ($p_{\\mathrm{A}}=p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{G}}=p_{\\mathrm{C}}$), the probability of finding a complementary base is the same as finding an identical base.\nFor example, for a G/C position in the primer: if the primer base is G, the template base on the minus strand must be C. The probability of finding C on the minus strand is the same as finding G on the plus strand, which is $p_{\\mathrm{G}} = 0.2$. This is same as the match probability for the forward primer.\nThe same logic applies to the 'AA' anchor. The reverse primer's 3' 'AA' requires a 'TT' on the minus strand, which corresponds to an 'AA' on the plus strand. The probability is again $p_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 = 0.09$.\nTherefore, the calculation is identical for the reverse primer: $P_R = P_F$.\n\n**3.

The desired relative quantification ratio, $R$, is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\text{Normalized abundance in Patient}}{\\text{Normalized abundance in Control}} = \\frac{ \\left( Q_{0,t}^{(P)} / Q_{0,r}^{(P)} \\right) }{ \\left( Q_{0,t}^{(C)} / Q_{0,r}^{(C)} \\right) }\n$$\nFrom the threshold equation $Q_T = Q_0 F^{C_t}$, we can express the initial quantity as $Q_0 = Q_T F^{-C_t}$. The problem specifies that the detection threshold $Q_T$ is identical across all runs. Let $F_t$ and $F_r$ be the amplification factors for the target and reference genes, respectively, which are determined by their corresponding standard curve slopes ($m_t, m_r$).\n\nWe can write the initial quantities for each gene in each sample:\n- Patient, target gene: $Q_{0,t}^{(P)} = Q_T (F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}}$\n- Control, target gene: $Q_{0,t}^{(C)} = Q_T (F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}}$\n- Patient, reference gene: $Q_{0,r}^{(P)} = Q_T (F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(P)}}$\n- Control, reference gene: $Q_{0,r}^{(C)} = Q_T (F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(C)}}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{ \\left( Q_T(F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}} / Q_T(F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(P)}} \\right) }{ \\left( Q_T(F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}} / Q_T(F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(C)}} \\right) }\n$$\nThe $Q_T$ terms cancel out:\n$$\nR = \\frac{ F_t^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(P)}} }{ F_t^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(C)}} } = F_t^{C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(P)} - C_{t,r}^{(C)}}\n$$\nThis expression, known as the Pfaffl equation, provides the efficiency-corrected relative quantification. To make it more compact, let's define the difference in $C_t$ values between the control and patient samples for each gene:\n- Target gene: $\\Delta C_{t,t} = C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)}$\n- Reference gene: $\\Delta C_{t,r} = C_{t,r}^{(C)} - C_{t,r}^{(P)}$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula gives:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(F_t)^{\\Delta C_{t,t}}}{(F_r)^{\\Delta C_{t,r}}}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Slopes: $m_t = -3.50$ and $m_r = -3.40$.\n- Target gene $C_t$ values: $C_{t,t}^{(P)} = 23.10$ and $C_{t,t}^{(C)} = 24.00$.\n- Reference gene $C_t$ values: $C_{t,r}^{(P)} = 19.50$ and $C_{t,r}^{(C)} = 19.20$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amplification factors $F_t$ and $F_r$ using the derived relation $F = 10^{-1/m}$:\n$$\nF_t = 10^{-1/(-3.50)} = 10^{1/3.50}\n$$\n$$\nF_r = 10^{-1/(-3.40)} = 10^{1/3.40}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the $\\Delta C_t$ values:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{t,t} = C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)} = 24.00 - 23.10 = 0.90\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta C_{t,r} = C_{t,r}^{(C)} - C_{t,r}^{(P)} = 19.20 - 19.50 = -0.30\n$$\nNow, substitute all values into the final expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(10^{1/3.50})^{0.90}}{(10^{1/3.40})^{-0.30}} = \\frac{10^{0.90/3.50}}{10^{-0.30/3.40}}\n$$\nUsing the property $a^x / a^y = a^{x-y}$:\n$$\nR = 10^{\\left(\\frac{0.90}{3.50} - \\left(-\\frac{0.30}{3.40}\\right)\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{0.90}{3.50} + \\frac{0.30}{3.40}\\right)}\n$$\nWe compute the exponent:\n$$\n\\frac{0.90}{3.50} + \\frac{0.30}{3.40} = \\frac{9}{35} + \\frac{3}{34} = \\frac{9 \\times 34 + 3 \\times 35}{35 \\times 34} = \\frac{306 + 105}{1190} = \\frac{411}{1190}\n$$\nSo, the fold change is:\n$$\nR = 10^{411/1190} \\approx 10^{0.34537815...} \\approx 2.215093...\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures yields $2.215$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.215}$$", "id": "5072590"}]}
