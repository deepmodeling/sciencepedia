The laboratory must quantify Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in each sample before clinical interpretation. Using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) genotyping on a trio (mother, father, fetus), the lab observes capillary electrophoresis peak heights for STR alleles. Assume the following foundational principles and facts: (i) Mendelian inheritance, in which the fetus inherits one allele from each parent; (ii) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) product peak height measured by capillary electrophoresis (CE) is approximately proportional to the number of amplifiable template copies of that allele present in the reaction; (iii) in a two-source mixture model, if the maternal fraction is $f$ (as a proportion of total diploid DNA) and the fetal fraction is $1 - f$, then expected allele-specific signal at a locus is a linear combination of maternal and fetal contributions weighted by their respective allele copy numbers; (iv) measurement noise on peak heights is dominated by counting noise approximated by Poisson statistics at high signal, so the variance of a peak height is approximately equal to its mean and different loci are independent.\nFirst, define Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in the contexts of CVS and amniocentesis, and outline the design of a trio-based STR assay that can quantify the MCC fraction $f$ from allelic peak heights. Your outline should identify the type of loci that are most informative, the role of paternal-specific alleles, and how trio information constrains the expected fetal genotype at each locus.\nThen, using only the principles above and without assuming any pre-derived shortcut formulas, derive from first principles an estimator for the MCC fraction $f$ at a single fully informative locus where the mother is homozygous for allele $A$ and the father is homozygous for allele $B$ (so the true fetal genotype must be $A/B$ by Mendelian reasoning). Let the observed peak heights in the mixed fetal sample at that locus be $H_{A}$ for the maternal allele and $H_{B}$ for the paternal-specific allele. Next, under the Poisson noise model in (iv), derive an inverse-variance optimal way to combine per-locus estimates across independent fully informative loci into a single estimate $\\hat{f}$ that eliminates per-locus amplification efficiency constants.\nFinally, apply your derivation to the following three fully informative loci assayed on one mixed fetal specimen. In each case the mother is homozygous for allele $A$, the father is homozygous for allele $B$, and the fetal genotype is therefore $A/B$.

It is based on established principles of Mendelian genetics, molecular biology (PCR), and statistical data analysis. The provided information is complete and consistent, allowing for a rigorous derivation and a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, a conceptual outline of Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) and its quantification; second, a derivation of an optimal estimator for the MCC fraction $f$; and third, the application of this estimator to the provided data.\n\n### Part 1: Definition of MCC and Assay Design\n\nMaternal Cell Contamination (MCC) refers to the presence of maternal cells, and therefore maternal DNA, within a fetal sample intended for prenatal genetic diagnosis. The clinical context determines the source of both fetal and maternal cells.\n- In Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS), the sample consists of chorionic villi, which are of fetal (placental) origin. Contamination arises from the co-collection of maternal decidua, the uterine lining to which the placenta is attached.\n- In amniocentesis, the sample is amniotic fluid, which contains fetal cells (amniocytes, fibroblasts). Contamination typically occurs if the amniocentesis needle traverses the placenta or punctures a maternal blood vessel, introducing maternal blood cells into the amniotic fluid.\nHigh levels of MCC (greater than $5\\%-10\\%$) can lead to misdiagnosis of the fetal genotype, potentially masking a fetal aneuploidy or a pathogenic variant. Therefore, accurate quantification of the MCC fraction, denoted $f$, is a critical quality control step.\n\nA trio-based Short Tandem Repeat (STR) assay is the standard method for MCC quantification. The design is as follows:\n1.  **Trio Genotyping**: DNA from the mother, father, and the mixed fetal sample are genotyped using a panel of polymorphic STR markers.\n2.  **Informative Loci Selection**: The parental genotypes are used to infer the true fetal genotype at each locus according to Mendelian inheritance. The most informative loci are those where the maternal and fetal genotypes are distinguishable. A \"fully informative\" locus, as specified in the problem, occurs when the mother is homozygous for one allele (e.g., genotype $A/A$) and the father is homozygous for a different allele ($B/B$). In this case, the fetus must inherit allele $A$ from the mother and allele $B$ from the father, resulting in an obligate heterozygous fetal genotype of $A/B$.\n3.  **Role of the Paternal-Specific Allele (PSA)**: In the fully informative $A/A$ (mother) and $B/B$ (father) case, allele $B$ is a PSA in the fetal sample. It is inherited from the father and is absent in the mother. The signal from this allele ($H_B$) serves as an unambiguous marker for the fetal component of the sample. Its quantity provides an internal reference against which the combined maternal-fetal signal can be compared.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of an Estimator for $f$\n\nLet us derive an estimator for the MCC fraction $f$ from first principles for a single, fully informative locus where the mother's genotype is $A/A$, the father's is $B/B$, and the fetus's is therefore $A/B$.\n\nLet $f$ be the fraction of maternal DNA in the mixed sample, and $(1-f)$ be the fraction of fetal DNA. The sample is a two-component mixture of maternal cells (genotype $A/A$) and fetal cells (genotype $A/B$).\n\nAccording to principle (iii), the expected signal for an allele is a weighted sum of contributions from each source. The contribution is proportional to the number of copies of that allele in the genotype.\n- The maternal genotype $A/A$ has $2$ copies of allele $A$ and $0$ copies of allele $B$.\n- The fetal genotype $A/B$ has $1$ copy of allele $A$ and $1$ copy of allele $B$.\n\nLet $k$ be a locus-specific constant representing amplification and detection efficiency. According to principle (ii), the expected peak heights, $E[H_A]$ and $E[H_B]$, are proportional to the total number of template copies of each allele in the mixture.\n\nThe expected number of copies of allele $A$ is proportional to the sum of contributions from the maternal and fetal fractions:\n$f \\cdot (\\text{copies of A in mother}) + (1-f) \\cdot (\\text{copies of A in fetus}) = f \\cdot 2 + (1-f) \\cdot 1 = 2f + 1 - f = 1+f$.\nSo, the expected peak height for allele $A$ is:\n$$E[H_A] = k(1+f)$$\n\nThe expected number of copies of allele $B$ is similarly derived:\n$f \\cdot (\\text{copies of B in mother}) + (1-f) \\cdot (\\text{copies of B in fetus}) = f \\cdot 0 + (1-f) \\cdot 1 = 1-f$.\nSo, the expected peak height for allele $B$ is:\n$$E[H_B] = k(1-f)$$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown, locus-specific constant $k$, we can take the ratio of the observed peak heights, $H_A$ and $H_B$, as an approximation for the ratio of their expectations:\n$$\\frac{H_A}{H_B} \\approx \\frac{E[H_A]}{E[H_B]} = \\frac{k(1+f)}{k(1-f)} = \\frac{1+f}{1-f}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $f$:\n$$H_A(1-f) = H_B(1+f)$$\n$$H_A - H_A f = H_B + H_B f$$\n$$H_A - H_B = f(H_A + H_B)$$\nThis gives the single-locus estimator for $f$:\n$$\\hat{f} = \\frac{H_A - H_B}{H_A + H_B}$$\n\n### Part 3: Derivation of the Optimal Combined Estimator\n\nTo obtain a more robust estimate, we must combine information across multiple independent loci. The problem requires an \"inverse-variance optimal\" method that eliminates per-locus efficiency constants. We can derive such an estimator using the principle of maximum likelihood, given the Poisson noise model (principle iv).\n\nFor each independent locus $i$, we observe peak heights $H_{A,i}$ and $H_{B,i}$. We model these as independent Poisson random variables:\n$$H_{A,i} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{A,i}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H_{B,i} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{B,i})$$\nThe Poisson means (rates) $\\lambda$ are the expected peak heights derived previously, with locus-specific efficiency constants $k_i$:\n$$\\lambda_{A,i} = k_i(1+f)$$\n$$\\lambda_{B,i} = k_i(1-f)$$\nThe parameters to be estimated are the global MCC fraction $f$ and the set of nuisance parameters $\\{k_i\\}$. The log-likelihood function for the observed data across all $N$ loci is the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\\mathcal{L}(f, \\{k_i\\} | \\{H_{A,i}, H_{B,i}\\}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ \\ln(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{A,i})\\lambda_{A,i}^{H_{A,i}}}{H_{A,i}!}) + \\ln(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{B,i})\\lambda_{B,i}^{H_{B,i}}}{H_{B,i}!}) \\right]$$\nIgnoring constant terms involving factorials, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ H_{A,i}\\ln(\\lambda_{A,i}) - \\lambda_{A,i} + H_{B,i}\\ln(\\lambda_{B,i}) - \\lambda_{B,i} \\right]$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_{A,i}$ and $\\lambda_{B,i}$:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ H_{A,i}\\ln(k_i(1+f)) - k_i(1+f) + H_{B,i}\\ln(k_i(1-f)) - k_i(1-f) \\right]$$\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ (H_{A,i}+H_{B,i})\\ln(k_i) + H_{A,i}\\ln(1+f) + H_{B,i}\\ln(1-f) - 2k_i \\right]$$\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), we take the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter and set them to zero. First, we solve for the nuisance parameters $k_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k_i} = \\frac{H_{A,i}+H_{B,i}}{k_i} - 2 = 0 \\implies \\hat{k}_i = \\frac{H_{A,i}+H_{B,i}}{2}$$\nThis confirms that the sum of peak heights at a locus is the best estimator for $2k_i$.\nNext, we substitute this back into the likelihood and differentiate with respect to $f$, or, more directly, we differentiate the original log-likelihood with respect to $f$ and then evaluate it at the MLEs for $k_i$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial f} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ \\frac{H_{A,i}}{1+f} - \\frac{H_{B,i}}{1-f} \\right] = 0$$\nThis equation must hold for the MLE $\\hat{f}$. We can solve for $\\hat{f}$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{H_{A,i}(1-\\hat{f}) - H_{B,i}(1+\\hat{f})}{(1+\\hat{f})(1-\\hat{f})} = 0$$\nSince the denominator is non-zero for $f \\in [0,1)$, the sum of the numerators must be zero:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( H_{A,i} - H_{A,i}\\hat{f} - H_{B,i} - H_{B,i}\\hat{f} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} - H_{B,i}) - \\hat{f} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} + H_{B,i}) = 0$$\n$$\\hat{f} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} + H_{B,i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} - H_{B,i})$$\nThis yields the optimal combined estimator, which is the MLE for $f$:\n$$\\hat{f} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} - H_{B,i})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (H_{A,i} + H_{B,i})}$$\nThis estimator elegantly combines data by summing the allele height differences across all loci and dividing by the sum of total allele heights. This effectively pools the data into a single \"macro-locus\", thereby eliminating the influence of the individual, unknown per-locus efficiency constants $k_i$.\n\n### Part 4: Calculation for the Given Specimen\n\nWe apply the derived optimal estimator to the provided data for three loci ($N=3$).\nThe data are:\n- Locus $1$: $H_{A,1} = 1780$, $H_{B,1} = 1220$.\n- Locus $2$: $H_{A,2} = 1530$, $H_{B,2} = 1020$.\n- Locus $3$: $H_{A,3} = 1460$, $H_{B,3} = 940$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the differences for the numerator:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (H_{A,i} - H_{B,i}) = (1780 - 1220) + (1530 - 1020) + (1460 - 940)$$\n$$= 560 + 510 + 520 = 1590$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the sums for the denominator:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (H_{A,i} + H_{B,i}) = (1780 + 1220) + (1530 + 1020) + (1460 + 940)$$\n$$= 3000 + 2550 + 2400 = 7950$$\n\nFinally, we compute the combined estimate $\\hat{f}$:\n$$\\hat{f} = \\frac{1590}{7950} = \\frac{159}{795} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Expressing $0.2$ with four significant figures gives $0.2000$.\nThis corresponds to an estimated Maternal Cell Contamination of $20.00\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2000}\n$$", "id": "5019269"}, {"introduction": "Once a sample is validated, the test is performed.

This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, which relates conditional probabilities.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events based on the problem statement:\n- Let $D$ be the event that the fetus truly has trisomy $21$ (the \"disease\" is present).\n- Let $D^c$ be the event that the fetus does not have trisomy $21$.\n- Let $T+$ be the event that the QF-PCR test result is positive.\n- Let $T-$ be the event that the QF-PCR test result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the information provided in the problem statement using probabilistic notation:\n1.  The prior probability of the fetus having trisomy $21$ is given as $P(D) = 0.05$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the QF-PCR test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present. This is given as $P(T+|D) = 0.99$.\n3.  The specificity of the QF-PCR test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent.

We use Bayes' theorem for this calculation:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D) P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D) P(D) + P(T+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis expression for $P(T+)$ represents the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: a true positive (disease present and test is positive) and a false positive (disease absent but test is positive).\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P(T+)$ into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D) P(D)}{P(T+|D) P(D) + P(T+|D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nWe can now substitute the numerical values we have established:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{(0.99)(0.05)}{(0.99)(0.05) + (0.005)(0.95)}$$\nLet's compute the values for the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nThe numerator, which is the probability of a true positive, is:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D) = P(T+|D) P(D) = 0.99 \\times 0.05 = 0.0495$$\nThe second term in the denominator, which is the probability of a false positive, is:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D^c) = P(T+|D^c) P(D^c) = 0.005 \\times 0.95 = 0.00475$$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$P(T+) = 0.0495 + 0.00475 = 0.05425$$\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{0.0495}{0.05425}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$P(D|T+) \\approx 0.9124423963...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Let $T_N$ be the event that the quantitative fluorescence–polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) test result is normal (disomy $21$). We are asked to find the post-test probability of Down syndrome given a normal test result, which is denoted by the conditional probability $P(DS | T_N)$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the pre-test probability of Down syndrome is given as:\n$$P(DS) = \\frac{1}{500}$$\nThe probability of the fetus not having Down syndrome is therefore:\n$$P(\\overline{DS}) = 1 - P(DS) = 1 - \\frac{1}{500} = \\frac{499}{500}$$\nTo find the desired post-test probability, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(DS | T_N) = \\frac{P(T_N | DS) \\cdot P(DS)}{P(T_N)}$$\nThe term $P(T_N)$ in the denominator can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T_N) = P(T_N | DS) \\cdot P(DS) + P(T_N | \\overline{DS}) \\cdot P(\\overline{DS})$$\nThus, Bayes' theorem can be written as:\n$$P(DS | T_N) = \\frac{P(T_N | DS) \\cdot P(DS)}{P(T_N | DS) \\cdot P(DS) + P(T_N | \\overline{DS}) \\cdot P(\\overline{DS})}$$\nWe must now determine the conditional probabilities $P(T_N | DS)$ and $P(T_N | \\overline{DS})$ from the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's determine $P(T_N | DS)$, the probability of a normal test result given that the fetus has Down syndrome. This corresponds to the false negative rate of the test. The problem states that DS cases can be divided into two categories:\n$1$. Cases detectable by QF-PCR: These constitute $98\\%$ of DS cases. For these, the test is abnormal (positive).\n$2$. Mosaic cases where the aneuploid cell line is below the limit of detection (LOD): These constitute $2\\%$ of DS cases. The problem specifies that in these cases, the aneuploid cell line is $5\\%$ of amniocytes, while the assay's LOD is $10\\%$.\nSince $5\\% < 10\\%$, the QF-PCR assay will fail to detect the aneuploidy in this mosaic subgroup. Therefore, these cases will yield a normal test result ($T_N$). The test will correctly identify the detectable forms, yielding an abnormal result. A false negative ($T_N$ for a $DS$ fetus) occurs only for the undetectable mosaic cases. The probability of this is the probability of having this form of mosaicism, given the fetus has DS.\nTherefore, the false negative rate is:\n$$P(T_N | DS) = 0.02$$\n\nNext, we determine $P(T_N | \\overline{DS})$, the probability of a normal test result given that the fetus does not have Down syndrome. This is the definition of the test's specificity. The problem states that the QF-PCR has \"perfect specificity for disomy $21$ (i.e., no false positives)\". A false positive occurs when the test is abnormal for a fetus that does not have DS. So, the probability of a false positive is $P(\\text{Abnormal Test} | \\overline{DS}) = 0$.
