Given that the value of $-0.3$ is an approximation itself and LRR values in real data show considerable variance, a value of $-0.3219$ is well within the expected range for a mosaic heterozygous deletion.

Let $f$ be the mosaic fraction of cells carrying the deletion, and $(1-f)$ be the fraction of normal diploid cells.\n\n**1. Derivation of BAF Cluster Expressions**\n\nFor a heterozygous SNP locus with alleles $A$ and $B$, the B Allele Frequency (BAF) reflects the relative signal contribution of the $B$ allele. In a mosaic scenario with a single-copy deletion, some cells have lost one allele. For a large number of heterozygous loci across the deleted segment, we expect that, by random chance, the deletion will affect the homolog carrying the $A$ allele in approximately half of the cases and the homolog carrying the $B$ allele in the other half. This leads to two distinct populations of heterozygous loci, which in turn generate two BAF clusters.\n\nThe BAF is defined as the ratio of the B-allele signal intensity, $I_B$, to the total signal intensity, $I_A + I_B$. The signal intensity from a population of cells is proportional to the total number of copies of the allele in that population.\n\nCase 1: The homolog carrying the $A$ allele is deleted.\n- Normal cells (fraction $1-f$): These are diploid with genotype $AB$. They contribute one copy of allele $A$ and one copy of allele $B$ each. Their contribution to the total signal intensity is proportional to $(1-f)$ for both $I_A$ and $I_B$.\n- Deleted cells (fraction $f$): These are hemizygous with genotype $B$ (the $A$ allele was lost). They contribute zero copies of allele $A$ and one copy of allele $B$ each. Their contribution to the total signal intensity is proportional to $0$ for $I_A$ and $f$ for $I_B$.\n\nThe total signal intensities are thus:\n- $I_A \\propto (1-f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 0 = 1-f$\n- $I_B \\propto (1-f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nThe expected BAF for this cluster, which we will call $\\text{BAF}_1$, is:\n$$ \\text{BAF}_1 = \\frac{I_B}{I_A + I_B} = \\frac{1}{(1-f) + 1} = \\frac{1}{2-f} $$\n\nCase 2: The homolog carrying the $B$ allele is deleted.\n- Normal cells (fraction $1-f$): Genotype $AB$, contributing one copy of $A$ and one of $B$. Their signal contribution is proportional to $(1-f)$ for both $I_A$ and $I_B$.\n- Deleted cells (fraction $f$): Genotype $A$ (the $B$ allele was lost). They contribute one copy of $A$ and zero copies of $B$. Their signal contribution is proportional to $f$ for $I_A$ and $0$ for $I_B$.\n\nThe total signal intensities are:\n- $I_A \\propto (1-f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 1 = 1$\n- $I_B \\propto (1-f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 0 = 1-f$\n\nThe expected BAF for this second cluster, $\\text{BAF}_2$, is:\n$$ \\text{BAF}_2 = \\frac{I_B}{I_A + I_B} = \\frac{1-f}{1 + (1-f)} = \\frac{1-f}{2-f} $$\n\nFor any $f \\in (0,1)$, we have $1 > 1-f$ and $2-f < 2$. It follows that $\\frac{1}{2-f} > \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-f}{2-f} < \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\text{BAF}_1$ corresponds to the BAF cluster above $0.5$ and $\\text{BAF}_2$ corresponds to the cluster below $0.5$. The derived expressions for the two BAF cluster centers are $\\frac{1}{2-f}$ and $\\frac{1-f}{2-f}$.\n\n**2. Estimation of the Mosaic Fraction $f$**\n\nThe problem provides that the two observed BAF clusters are centered near $0.60$ and $0.40$. We can equate these values to our derived expressions:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2-f} \\approx 0.60 $$\n$$ \\frac{1-f}{2-f} \\approx 0.40 $$\n\nWe can solve for $f$ using either equation. Using the first (simpler) equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2-f} = 0.60 $$\n$$ 1 = 0.60 \\times (2-f) $$\n$$ 1 = 1.20 - 0.60f $$\n$$ 0.60f = 1.20 - 1 $$\n$$ 0.60f = 0.20 $$\n$$ f = \\frac{0.20}{0.60} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nTo verify, we can use the second equation:\n$$ \\frac{1-f}{2-f} = 0.40 $$\n$$ 1-f = 0.40 \\times (2-f) $$\n$$ 1-f = 0.80 - 0.40f $$\n$$ 1 - 0.80 = f - 0.40f $$\n$$ 0.20 = 0.60f $$\n$$ f = \\frac{0.20}{0.60} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nBoth equations yield the same result, confirming the consistency of the model with the data. The mosaic fraction of cells with the deletion is $f = 1/3$.\nRounding to three significant figures, $f \\approx 0.333$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of BAF Spread and LRR Consistency**\n\n**BAF Spread:** The problem notes a small within-cluster standard deviation of approximately $0.015$. This value quantifies the spread, or noise, of individual probe BAF measurements around the cluster center. A small standard deviation indicates that the data points are tightly clustered, implying a high signal-to-noise ratio. This high precision in the measurement of the BAF cluster centers ($0.40$ and $0.60$) lends high confidence to the estimate of the mosaic fraction $f$ derived from them. A larger spread would introduce more uncertainty in the location of the cluster centers, and thus more uncertainty in the calculated value of $f$.\n\n**LRR Consistency:** The Log R Ratio (LRR) is defined as $\\text{LRR} = \\log_2(\\frac{R_{obs}}{R_{exp}})$, where $R_{obs}$ is the observed total signal intensity and $R_{exp}$ is the expected total signal intensity in a normal diploid state.\n- The total signal intensity is proportional to the average copy number across the cell population.\n- The expected copy number for a normal diploid region is $2$. Thus, $R_{exp}$ is proportional to $2$.\n- In the mosaic sample, a fraction $(1-f)$ of cells has copy number $2$, and a fraction $f$ of cells has copy number $1$ (hemizygous deletion).\n- The average copy number in the sample is therefore $(1-f) \\times 2 + f \\times 1 = 2 - 2f + f = 2 - f$.\n- Thus, $R_{obs}$ is proportional to $(2-f)$.\n\nThe expected LRR is:\n$$ \\text{LRR} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{k \\cdot (2-f)}{k \\cdot 2}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2-f}{2}\\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nSince $f = 1/3$, which is in the range $0 < f < 1$, the term $2-f$ is in the range $1 < 2-f < 2$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{2-f}{2}$ is in the range $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{2-f}{2} < 1$. The base-$2$ logarithm of any number between $0$ and $1$ is negative.\nFor $f=1/3$, the expected LRR is:\n$$ \\text{LRR} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2 - 1/3}{2}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{5/3}{2}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) \\approx -0.263 $$\nThis predicted negative LRR value is qualitatively consistent with the observation of a \"slight negative deviation\" in the LRR, reinforcing the validity of the single-copy mosaic deletion model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.333}$$", "id": "5082767"}]}
