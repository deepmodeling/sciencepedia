Consider a sample with a total of $30{,}000{,}000$ uniquely mapped autosomal reads, of which $1{,}050{,}000$ map to chromosome $21$. The euploid reference cohort yields a mean fraction for chromosome $21$ of $0.015$ and a between-sample standard deviation of $0.0005$ for the same normalization and counting scheme.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statistical notion of standardization—viewing the observed fraction as a realization from a distribution characterized by a reference mean and standard deviation under the null hypothesis of euploidy—and assuming that, due to the large number of reads, the standardized deviate is approximately standard normal, compute the standardized deviate (z-score) for chromosome $21$ in this sample.\n\nThen, interpret whether the result is consistent with overrepresentation of chromosome $21$ that would be used to flag a potential trisomy $21$ call in a research setting that uses a two-sided normal cutoff of $|z| \\ge 3$.\n\nReport only the z-score as a pure number, rounded to three significant figures, in your final numeric answer.

This score is used to assess whether the observed fraction is statistically deviant from a reference population of euploid samples, which would suggest a chromosomal aneuploidy like trisomy $21$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$ in the given sample. Let $N_{total}$ be the total number of uniquely mapped autosomal reads and $N_{21}$ be the number of those reads that map to chromosome $21$.\n\nThe given values are:\nTotal autosomal reads, $N_{total} = 30{,}000{,}000$.\nChromosome $21$ reads, $N_{21} = 1{,}050{,}000$.\n\nThe observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$, denoted as $f_{obs}$, is the ratio of $N_{21}$ to $N_{total}$:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{N_{21}}{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{1{,}050{,}000}{30{,}000{,}000} = \\frac{1.05}{30} = 0.035$$\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score.

This is a very strong statistical signal indicating a significant overrepresentation of chromosome $21$. Such a result is highly consistent with the presence of an extra copy of chromosome $21$ in the fetal genome, and would be flagged as high-risk for trisomy $21$.\n\nThe final answer requires the z-score as a pure number rounded to three significant figures.

The solution involves three main steps: modeling the expected chromosome $21$ fraction in a cfDNA mixture, modeling the total variance of the measurement, and solving for $f$ using the definition of the z-score.\n\nFirst, let's define the baseline fraction of chromosome $21$ in a euploid sample. This is given by the ratio of the mappable length of chromosome $21$, $L_{21}$, to the total mappable autosomal genome length, $L_{\\text{auto}}$.\n$$p = \\frac{L_{21}}{L_{\\text{auto}}}$$\nWith the given values, $L_{21} = 47 \\,\\text{Mb}$ and $L_{\\text{auto}} = 3100 \\,\\text{Mb}$, this fraction is:\n$$p = \\frac{47}{3100}$$\n\nNext, we model the expected observed fraction of chromosome $21$, which we denote as $p_{\\text{obs}}$, in a plasma sample from a pregnant individual carrying a fetus with trisomy $21$.

The mother is assumed to be euploid, so her cfDNA contributes chromosome $21$ reads at the baseline proportion $p$. The fetus has trisomy $21$, meaning it has $3$ copies of chromosome $21$ instead of the usual $2$. This results in a $3/2 = 1.5$ times overrepresentation of chromosome $21$ from the fetal cfDNA component.\nThe expected observed fraction $p_{\\text{obs}}$ is the weighted average of the contributions from the maternal and fetal fractions:\n$$p_{\\text{obs}} = (1-f)p + f(1.5p)$$\n$$p_{\\text{obs}} = p - fp + 1.5fp$$\n$$p_{\\text{obs}} = p(1 + 0.5f)$$\nThe deviation of this observed fraction from the euploid baseline $p$ is the signal for trisomy $21$ detection:\n$$\\text{Signal} = p_{\\text{obs}} - p = p(1 + 0.5f) - p = 0.5fp$$\n\nNext, we determine the total standard deviation, $\\sigma$, of the measurement of the chromosome $21$ fraction.

Their variances add.\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{sampling}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{technical}}^2$$\n\nThe sampling variation is modeled as a binomial process. For a total of $N$ reads, the number of reads from chromosome $21$ is a random variable. The measured fraction is an estimate of the true proportion. The variance of this estimated proportion, under the null hypothesis (i.e., for a euploid sample with fraction $p$), is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{sampling}}^2 = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$$\n\nThe technical noise is given by a coefficient of variation (CV), $c_t$. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.

The PPV is the posterior probability that a fetus has the condition given a positive test result.

This corresponds to the disease being present.\n- $D^c$: The event that a fetus does not have Trisomy $21$.\n- $T^+$: The event that the NIPT result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the NIPT result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the givens of the problem in terms of probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of Trisomy $21$ is given as $1/700$. This is the prior probability of the condition, $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = \\frac{1}{700}$$\n    From this, the probability of not having the condition is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\frac{1}{700} = \\frac{699}{700}$$\n\n2.
