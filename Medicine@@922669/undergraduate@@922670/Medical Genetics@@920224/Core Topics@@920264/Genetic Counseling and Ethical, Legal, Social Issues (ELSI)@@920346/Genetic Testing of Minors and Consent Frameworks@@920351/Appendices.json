It is a standard application of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle of probability theory, to a realistic scenario in clinical genetics. All variables are clearly defined, and the necessary data for a unique solution are provided. The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and free from ambiguity or contradiction. The contextual information about the patient's age ($15$) and the consent framework, while relevant to clinical practice, does not alter the mathematical structure of the problem and does not render it invalid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Posterior Probability from First Principles**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the minor has the pathogenic variant.\nLet $\\neg D$ be the event that the minor does not have the pathogenic variant.\nLet $+$ be the event that the test result is positive.\nLet $-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the posterior probability $P(D|+)$, which is the probability of having the variant given a positive test result.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\nApplying this definition to our problem, with $A=D$ and $B=+$, we have:\n$$ P(D|+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap +)$, is the joint probability of having the variant and testing positive. It can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability again: $P(+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(D)}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$ P(D \\cap +) = P(+|D) P(D) $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the individual has the variant and tests positive, or the individual does not have the variant and tests positive. Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$ P(+) = P(D \\cap +) + P(\\neg D \\cap +) $$\nAgain, applying the definition of conditional probability to each term:\n$$ P(D \\cap +) = P(+|D) P(D) $$\n$$ P(\\neg D \\cap +) = P(+|\\neg D) P(\\neg D) $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $P(+)$ gives:\n$$ P(+) = P(+|D) P(D) + P(+|\\neg D) P(\\neg D) $$\n\nNow, substituting the expressions for the numerator $P(D \\cap +)$ and the denominator $P(+)$ into our initial formula for $P(D|+)$ yields Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D) P(D)}{P(+|D) P(D) + P(+|\\neg D) P(\\neg D)} $$\n\nThe final step in the derivation is to express all terms on the right-hand side using the givens: $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$.\n- The prior probability is given as $P(D) = p$.\n- The probability of not having the variant is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n- The sensitivity is given as $Se = P(+|D)$.\n- The specificity is given as $Sp = P(-|\\neg D)$. We need $P(+|\\neg D)$, the probability of a false positive. Since for any given condition (like $\\neg D$), the test must be either positive or negative, we have $P(+|\\neg D) + P(-|\\neg D) = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ P(+|\\neg D) = 1 - P(-|\\neg D) = 1 - Sp $$\n\nSubstituting these symbolic representations into the derived formula for $P(D|+)$ yields the final expression:\n$$ P(D|+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)} $$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $p = 0.1$\n- $Se = 0.95$\n- $Sp = 0.98$\n\nWe can also compute:\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$\n- $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived expression for $P(D|+)$:\n$$ P(D|+) = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.1}{(0.95 \\times 0.1) + (0.02 \\times 0.9)} $$\nFirst, compute the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $0.95 \\times 0.1 = 0.095$\n- Denominator, first term: $0.95 \\times 0.1 = 0.095$\n- Denominator, second term: $0.02 \\times 0.9 = 0.018$\n\nNow, sum the terms in the denominator:\n- Denominator: $0.095 + 0.018 = 0.113$\n\nFinally, compute the posterior probability:\n$$ P(D|+) = \\frac{0.095}{0.113} $$\n$$ P(D|+) \\approx 0.8407079646... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $4$, $0$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last digit.\n$$ P(D|+) \\approx 0.8407 $$\nThis is the posterior probability that the minor has the pathogenic variant, given a positive test result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8407}$$", "id": "5038701"}, {"introduction": "Moving from an individual case to a population perspective, modern genomics often involves sequencing large cohorts, which uncovers not only primary results but also \"secondary findings.\" This exercise applies the binomial model and its normal approximation to a real-world scenario: estimating the number of reportable secondary findings in a pediatric exome sequencing program.

The problem states that each exome represents an independent trial with a constant probability of success (finding a reportable variant) $p = 0.02$.

This approximation is justified by the Central Limit Theorem and is considered reliable when both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are sufficiently large (a common rule of thumb is $> 5$).\n\nLet's verify these conditions:\n$$\nnp = 1000 \\times 0.02 = 20 > 5\n$$\n$$\nn(1-p) = 1000 \\times (1 - 0.02) = 1000 \\times 0.98 = 980 > 5\n$$\nSince both conditions are met, the normal approximation is appropriate.\n\nThe binomial distribution $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ can be approximated by a normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with mean $\\mu = np$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$.\n\nThe mean $\\mu$ is the expected value calculated previously:\n$$\n\\mu = 20\n$$\nThe variance $\\sigma^2$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = np(1-p) = (1000)(0.02)(0.98) = 20(0.98) = 19.6\n$$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{19.6}\n$$\nAn approximate two-sided $95\\%$ probability interval for the random variable $X$ is constructed around its mean.

The parents and the child will meet with a genetic counselor before testing. The counselor aims to adhere to established principles for testing minors, including parental permission and age-appropriate assent, the best interests standard, and transparent communication about the interpretive limits of genomic findings. Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), defined under the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) framework as changes in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) for which the available evidence is insufficient to classify the variant as pathogenic or benign, are common in gene panels and exome tests, often appearing in approximately $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ of results depending on the gene set and population. VUS are not intended to guide medical decision-making until their classification changes with new evidence. Many laboratories offer periodic reinterpretation or reanalysis of exome data, typically within $12$ to $24$ months, and may contact families if variant classification changes, but policies vary and recontact is not guaranteed unless families consent to recontact and maintain current contact information.\n\nThe counselor must structure pre-test counseling to prepare the family for the possibility of a VUS result and set expectations about uncertainty, timelines for reinterpretation, and the need for follow-up testing that may involve parental or sibling samples for segregation analysis.

The problem states typical reinterpretation occurs over $12$ to $24$ months with no guarantee of resolution.\n- **Violation of Consent**: Performing trio sequencing (which involves testing the parents) without explicit parental permission is a severe ethical and legal breach.\n- **Incorrect VUS Management**: Recommending therapeutic changes based on a VUS, even if it fits the phenotype, directly contradicts the established principle that a VUS is not clinically actionable. This could lead to significant harm (maleficence).\n\nThis plan is unethical, scientifically unsound, and dangerous.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Focus counseling exclusively on pathogenic and benign results to avoid alarming the family; omit discussion of VUS because they are speculative; and encourage the family to rely on clinician judgment if uncertain results occur rather than seeking reinterpretation.**\n\nThis option advocates for a paternalistic and incomplete model of counseling.\n- **Violation of Informed Consent**: Omitting the discussion of VUS, a common outcome (occurring in $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ of results), prevents the family from being truly informed. This undermines the entire consent process. The family would be unprepared for a very possible result, leading to anxiety and confusion.\n- **Undermining Patient Autonomy**: Encouraging the family to passively rely on clinicians and discouraging them from seeking reinterpretation is contrary to the collaborative model of modern medicine and the active process of VUS resolution.\n\nThis plan fails the principle of transparent communication.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Advise the parents to regard a VUS as equivalent to “likely pathogenic” when the phenotype matches, in order to avoid delays in care; defer obtaining assent because the child is under $10$ years; and inform the family that adult-onset secondary findings will be returned to the child regardless of parental preferences because they may be important in the future.**\n\nThis option promotes misinterpretation of results and violates established ethical norms for testing minors.\n- **Incorrect VUS Management**: Equating a VUS with a \"likely pathogenic\" variant is a gross misclassification. The ACMG/AMP framework strictly defines these as separate categories with different clinical implications. Acting on a VUS as if it were pathogenic could lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.\n- **Violation of a Minor's Rights**: Deferring assent for a $7$-year-old is inappropriate. The principle of age-appropriate assent is a standard of care and respects the developing autonomy of the child. While a $7$-year-old cannot give legal consent, they can and should participate in the decision-making process at a level they can understand.\n- **Handling of Secondary Findings**: The automatic return of adult-onset secondary findings to a minor is a highly contentious issue. Most professional guidelines recommend against this practice to protect the child's future right \"not to know\" and to make their own choices as an adult, especially when there are no interventions during childhood. Forcing these results on the family and child against their wishes is ethically problematic.\n\nThis plan is scientifically incorrect and ethically flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Emphasize that because exome sequencing is comprehensive, uncertainty is minimal; promise that a definitive diagnosis is likely; and discourage any follow-up segregation testing of relatives, which is rarely useful for clarifying VUS classifications.**\n\nThis option is based on false premises and gives poor advice.\n- **False Reassurance**: Stating that uncertainty is \"minimal\" and a definitive diagnosis is \"likely\" directly contradicts the provided information that VUS are found in $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ of exome results. This sets the family up for disappointment and erodes trust.\n- **Incorrect Scientific Information**: The claim that segregation testing is \"rarely useful\" is factually wrong. Segregation analysis (determining if the variant tracks with the disease in the family) is a primary and powerful tool used to gather evidence for or against the pathogenicity of a VUS.\n\nThis plan misrepresents the nature of exome sequencing and provides scientifically unsound guidance.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5038748"}]}
