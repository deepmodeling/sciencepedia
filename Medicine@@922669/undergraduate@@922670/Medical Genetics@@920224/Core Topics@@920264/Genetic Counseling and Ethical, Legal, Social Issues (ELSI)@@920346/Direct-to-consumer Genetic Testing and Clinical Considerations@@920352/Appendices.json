Under an additive genetic model for complex traits, each SNP contributes to an unstandardized genetic liability index in proportion to its per-allele effect size derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS), and the count of the risk allele in the individual's genotype. The company then reports a standardized value by centering the unstandardized index using a population mean and scaling by the population standard deviation. Consider an individual with $3$ SNPs whose per-allele effect sizes are $\\beta = [0.1, 0.05, -0.02]$ and whose genotype risk-allele counts are $x = [2, 1, 0]$. The reference population distribution used for standardization has mean $0$ and standard deviation $0.2$. Starting from the additive model and the definition of standardization, compute the individual's standardized PRS as a $z$-score. Round your final $z$-score to four significant figures.

The use of an additive model to calculate a PRS from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their associated effect sizes from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a standard methodology in statistical genetics. The values for effect sizes are small, which is realistic for complex traits where individual SNPs have minor effects. The allele counts ($0$, $1$, or $2$) are biologically correct for a diploid organism. The process of standardizing a raw score into a $z$-score using a reference population's mean and standard deviation is a fundamental statistical procedure. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\nThe additive model posits that the total unstandardized genetic liability index, which we denote as $S_{raw}$, is the sum of the contributions from each SNP. The contribution of each SNP is the product of its per-allele effect size ($\\beta_i$) and the number of risk alleles the individual possesses at that SNP's locus ($x_i$).\n\nThe formula for the unstandardized genetic liability index is:\n$$S_{raw} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\beta_i x_i$$\nIn vector notation, this is the dot product of the effect size vector and the allele count vector:\n$$S_{raw} = \\beta \\cdot x = \\beta^T x$$\nThe problem provides $N=3$ SNPs, with effect sizes $\\beta = [0.1, 0.05, -0.02]$ and allele counts $x = [2, 1, 0]$. We can substitute these values into the formula:\n$$S_{raw} = (0.1 \\times 2) + (0.05 \\times 1) + (-0.02 \\times 0)$$\nCalculating the individual terms:\n$$S_{raw} = 0.2 + 0.05 + 0$$\nSumming the terms gives the unstandardized score:\n$$S_{raw} = 0.25$$\nNext, this unstandardized score must be standardized to a $z$-score using the provided reference population parameters. The formula for a $z$-score is:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\text{value} - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}$$\nIn this context, the 'value' is the individual's unstandardized score, $S_{raw}$, and the mean and standard deviation are those of the reference population, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, respectively.\n$$Z = \\frac{S_{raw} - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nThe problem states that the reference population mean is $\\mu = 0$ and the standard deviation is $\\sigma = 0.2$. Substituting the calculated $S_{raw}$ and the given population parameters:\n$$Z = \\frac{0.25 - 0}{0.2}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$Z = \\frac{0.25}{0.2} = 1.25$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $1.25$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we append a zero:\n$$Z = 1.250$$\nFinally, the problem asks for a brief interpretation of this $z$-score. A $z$-score quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution. In this case, a $z$-score of $1.250$ implies that the individual's calculated genetic liability is $1.250$ standard deviations above the mean genetic liability of the reference population. This places the individual at approximately the $89.4^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the distribution (assuming a normal distribution of scores in the population), indicating a higher-than-average genetic predisposition for the trait in question, based on the limited set of SNPs included in this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.250}$$", "id": "5024243"}, {"introduction": "A positive result from a genetic screen can be alarming, but its true meaning depends heavily on the rarity of the condition in the general population. Bayes' theorem is the essential mathematical tool for determining the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which tells us the actual probability that a positive result is a true positive.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical genetics and probability theory, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires the application of Bayes' theorem to update the probability of an individual being a carrier of a genetic condition after receiving a negative test result.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n- $C$: The event that the individual is a carrier.\n- $C^c$: The event that the individual is not a carrier (the complement of $C$).\n- $T-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n- $T+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The prior probability of being a carrier, which is the population carrier frequency:\n$$ P(C) = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02 $$\n2. The prior probability of not being a carrier:\n$$ P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 $$\n3.

The analytic specificity of the assay, which is the probability of a negative test given the individual is not a carrier:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T- \\mid C^c) = 1 $$\n\nWe need to compute the residual probability that the individual is a carrier given the negative test result, which is the posterior probability $P(C \\mid T-)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$ P(C \\mid T-) = \\frac{P(T- \\mid C) P(C)}{P(T-)} $$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine the terms on the right-hand side.\n\nThe term $P(T- \\mid C)$ is the probability of a negative test result given the individual is a carrier. This is also known as the false negative rate. It is the complement of the sensitivity:\n$$ P(T- \\mid C) = 1 - P(T+ \\mid C) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe term $P(T-)$ represents the total probability of receiving a negative test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of being a carrier ($C$) or not ($C^c$):\n$$ P(T-) = P(T- \\mid C)P(C) + P(T- \\mid C^c)P(C^c) $$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$ P(T-) = (0.05)(0.02) + (1)(0.98) $$\n$$ P(T-) = 0.001 + 0.98 = 0.981 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the posterior probability $P(C \\mid T-)$:\n$$ P(C \\mid T-) = \\frac{P(T- \\mid C) P(C)}{P(T-)} = \\frac{(0.05)(0.02)}{0.981} $$\n$$ P(C \\mid T-) = \\frac{0.001}{0.981} \\approx 0.00101936799... $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(C \\mid T-) \\approx 0.001019 $$\n\nBrief discussion of counseling implications:\nThe calculation demonstrates that while the negative test result significantly reduces the individual's probability of being a carrier from $0.02$ (or $1$ in $50$) to approximately $0.001019$ (or about $1$ in $981$), the risk is not eliminated. This non-zero residual risk has critical counseling implications in the context of DTC testing.\n\nThe most important implication is the potential for misinterpretation by the consumer. An individual receiving a \"negative\" result may incorrectly assume they have zero risk of being a carrier, leading to false reassurance. Counseling is essential to explain that the test is a screening test, not a definitive diagnostic test, and a residual risk remains due to the test's limitations (in this case, an analytic sensitivity of less than 100%, which is characteristic of targeted panels that do not detect all possible pathogenic variants).\n\nFor reproductive decision-making, this residual risk is highly relevant. If the individual's partner is a known carrier or also has a residual risk after testing, the risk of having a child with the autosomal recessive condition is not zero. The couple's reproductive risk must be calculated using this updated posterior probability. Depending on the couple's risk tolerance, this residual risk may still warrant consideration of more comprehensive carrier screening (such as full gene sequencing) or consultation with a genetic counselor to make fully informed decisions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.001019}$$", "id": "5024297"}]}
