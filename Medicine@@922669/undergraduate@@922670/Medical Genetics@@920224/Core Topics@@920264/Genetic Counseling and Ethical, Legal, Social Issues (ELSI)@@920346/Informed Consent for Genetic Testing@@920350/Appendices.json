Mastering this calculation and learning to explain it using intuitive natural frequencies is a cornerstone of effective and ethical pre-test counseling [@problem_id:5051206].", "problem": "You are counseling a patient considering a population-screening genetic test for a well-characterized, high-penetrance pathogenic variant. The test was validated in the same clinical context and has measured sensitivity $0.95$, specificity $0.98$, and the pathogenic variant prevalence in the intended screening population is $0.01$. In pre-test informed consent, you must quantify the chance that a positive result reflects true variant carriage and the chance that a negative result reflects true absence, and you must explain these quantities in a way that prevents base-rate neglect and corrects common misinterpretations of Positive Predictive Value as though it were sensitivity.\n\nStarting only from core definitions in probability and epidemiological test performance appropriate to medical genetics (definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and conditional probability via Bayes’ theorem and the law of total probability), derive expressions for Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV), compute their numerical values using the parameters given, and then formulate a brief consent-friendly explanation using natural frequencies that corrects base-rate neglect and the misinterpretation of PPV.\n\nReport your final numeric answers in the order $PPV$ and $NPV$, expressed as decimals in $[0,1]$ and rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with the derivation and explanation as requested.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the pathogenic variant, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens are translated into conditional probabilities and a prior probability:\n1.  Prevalence of the pathogenic variant: $P(D) = 0.01$. This is the prior probability that a randomly selected individual from the population has the variant. The probability of not having the variant is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n2.  Test Sensitivity: $S_e = P(T^+|D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a positive test given the patient truly has the variant. The False Negative Rate is its complement: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - S_e = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n3.  Test Specificity: $S_p = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.98$. This is the probability of a negative test given the patient truly does not have the variant. The False Positive Rate is its complement: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe task requires deriving and calculating two quantities:\n-   Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$): The probability that a patient has the variant given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$.\n-   Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$): The probability that a patient does not have the variant given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is stated as:\n$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$\nThe denominator, $P(B)$, is the total probability of event $B$, calculated using the law of total probability: $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe $PPV$ is $P(D|T^+)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive ($T^+$ and $D$) or a false positive ($T^+$ and $D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (S_e \\times P(D)) + ((1-S_p) \\times P(D^c))$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the formula for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{S_e \\cdot P(D)}{S_e \\cdot P(D) + (1-S_p) \\cdot (1-P(D))}$$\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.95 \\times 0.01 + (1 - 0.98) \\times (1 - 0.01)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.02 \\times 0.99}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0198} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0293}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.324232...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.3242$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is $P(D^c|T^-)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we apply the law of total probability. A negative test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true negative ($T^-$ and $D^c$) or a false negative ($T^-$ and $D$).\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^-) = (S_p \\times P(D^c)) + ((1-S_e) \\times P(D))$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the formula for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)} = \\frac{S_p \\cdot (1-P(D))}{(1-S_e) \\cdot P(D) + S_p \\cdot (1-P(D))}$$\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.98 \\times (1 - 0.01)}{(1 - 0.95) \\times 0.01 + 0.98 \\times (1 - 0.01)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.99}{0.05 \\times 0.01 + 0.98 \\times 0.99}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9702}{0.0005 + 0.9702} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.9707}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.999484...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9995$.\n\n**Consent-Friendly Explanation Using Natural Frequencies**\n\nTo prevent base-rate neglect and correct common misinterpretations, we can re-frame these probabilities using a hypothetical cohort.\n\n\"Let's consider a group of $10,000$ people who are representative of the population being screened.\n\nBased on the prevalence of this genetic variant ($1\\%$, or $0.01$), we expect that $100$ of these $10,000$ people actually have the variant, and the remaining $9,900$ do not.\n\nNow, let's see how the test performs on these two groups:\n-   Of the $100$ people who **do** have the variant, the test is $95\\%$ sensitive. It will correctly identify $95$ of them as positive (these are true positives). It will miss the variant in the other $5$ people, who will get a negative result (these are false negatives).\n-   Of the $9,900$ people who **do not** have the variant, the test is $98\\%$ specific. It will correctly identify $9,702$ of them as negative (these are true negatives). It will incorrectly identify the other $198$ people as positive (these are false positives).\n\nSo, if you receive a **positive result**, what does it mean? A total of $95 + 198 = 293$ people in our cohort received a positive result. However, only $95$ of those individuals actually have the variant. Therefore, the probability that a positive result is a true positive is $95$ out of $293$, which is about $32.4\\%$. It is critical to understand this: a positive result means there is a $32.4\\%$ chance you have the variant. This is not $95\\%$. The $95\\%$ sensitivity refers to the test's ability to find the variant in people who are already known to have it. The reason your chance is lower is because the variant itself is uncommon, so most positive results are actually false alarms from the much larger group of people who do not have the variant. This is a common point of confusion known as base-rate neglect.\n\nIf you receive a **negative result**, what does it mean? A total of $5 + 9,702 = 9,707$ people in our cohort received a negative result. Of these, $9,702$ truly do not have the variant. Therefore, the probability that a negative result is a true negative is $9,702$ out of $9,707$, which is about $99.95\\%$. A negative result is therefore extremely reassuring that you do not carry the variant.\"", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3242 & 0.9995 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5051206"}, {"introduction": "With the rise of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for common diseases, patients are often presented with risk information as a relative multiplier, such as having \"1.5 times the average risk.\" While mathematically correct, this relative risk can be difficult to interpret and may cause undue anxiety if the baseline risk is low. This practice focuses on the essential skill of converting a relative risk ($RR$) into an absolute risk ($R_{abs}$), which provides a much clearer and more actionable picture of a patient's health outlook, empowering them to make truly informed decisions [@problem_id:5051242].", "problem": "A clinical genetics service is preparing informed consent materials for offering polygenic risk score (PRS) testing for a common adult-onset condition, where population data indicate a baseline cumulative risk to age $75$ of $0.10$ in the patient’s ancestry-matched reference group.

The definition of relative risk is given as the ratio of the cumulative risk in the risk-elevated group (the patient) to the baseline cumulative risk. This can be expressed by the formula:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{abs}}{R_{base}}$$\n\nThe task is to derive the patient's absolute cumulative risk, $R_{abs}$, to age $75$.

This assumption is scientifically reasonable because it is the standard method for applying population-level data to an individual; the baseline risk represents the average risk for the population, and the polygenic risk score acts as a specific modifier for that individual. Without this assumption, no baseline risk could ever be applied.\nFurthermore, we must assume that the polygenic risk score and the associated $RR$ have been properly calibrated and validated for the patient's specific ancestral population. The phrase \"ancestry-matched reference group\" in the problem statement implies that this condition is met, which is consistent with best practices in genomic medicine to avoid confounding by population stratification.\nThe resulting absolute risk, $R_{abs} = 0.15$, is a probability and must be between $0$ and $1$, which it is. This confirms the simple multiplicative model does not produce a mathematically invalid result in this instance.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to articulate why absolute risk is preferable to relative risk for consent clarity.\nAbsolute risk is preferable for consent clarity because it communicates the patient's actual probability of developing the condition (e.g., a $15\\%$ lifetime chance), which is a concrete and interpretable figure for personal health decisions, whereas relative risk (e.g., a $1.5$-fold or $50\\%$ increase in risk) is a comparative measure that can be misinterpreted, especially if the baseline risk is very low.\n\nThe calculated absolute cumulative risk is $0.15$.
