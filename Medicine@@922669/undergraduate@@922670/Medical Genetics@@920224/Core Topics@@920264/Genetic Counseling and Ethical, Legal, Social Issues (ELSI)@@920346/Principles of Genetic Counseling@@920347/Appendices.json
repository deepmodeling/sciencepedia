The first is affected (genotype $aa$). The second is clinically unaffected.\n-   **Assumptions**: No new mutations, no gametic selection, independent assortment across pregnancies.\n-   **Task**:\n    1.  Derive the recurrence risk for the next pregnancy resulting in an affected child.\n    2.  Derive the probability that the existing unaffected child is a carrier.\n-   **Constraints**: Derivations must be from first principles (Mendelian segregation, conditional probability).

The assumptions of no new mutations, full penetrance, and independent assortment are standard for idealized genetic problems and are scientifically sound in this context.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The parental genotypes are explicitly given ($Aa \\times Aa$), and the questions are precise. All necessary information to calculate the required probabilities is provided. The existence of an affected child ($aa$) is consistent with and confirmatory of the stated parental genotypes.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in clear, objective, and precise scientific language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely specified, and objective. It is a standard, formalizable problem in medical genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the foundational principles of Mendelian segregation for the given parental cross. The parents both have the genotype $Aa$. Each parent produces gametes containing either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele with equal probability, $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The random fusion of these gametes during fertilization determines the genotype of an offspring.\n\nThe probabilities for the three possible offspring genotypes are derived as follows:\n-   **Genotype $AA$ (unaffected, non-carrier)**: This requires an $A$ allele from each parent. The probability is $P(AA) = P(A_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{mother}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   **Genotype $Aa$ (unaffected, carrier)**: This can occur in two ways: $A$ from the father and $a$ from the mother, or $a$ from the father and $A$ from the mother. The total probability is $P(Aa) = (P(A_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{mother}})) + (P(a_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{mother}})) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   **Genotype $aa$ (affected)**: This requires an $a$ allele from each parent. The probability is $P(aa) = P(a_{\\text{father}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{mother}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\n**1) Recurrence Risk for the Next Pregnancy**\n\nThe problem asks for the recurrence risk, which is the probability that the next child will be affected. A core assumption is the independence of pregnancies. This means the genotypes of previous children have no influence on the genotype of a future child. The parental genotypes remain $Aa \\times Aa$, and the Mendelian probabilities for their offspring are constant for each pregnancy.\n\nAn \"affected\" child corresponds to the genotype $aa$, as the condition is fully penetrant. The probability of having a child with genotype $aa$ was derived directly from the principles of segregation.\n\nRecurrence risk $= P(\\text{next child is affected}) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**2) Probability that the Unaffected Child is a Carrier**\n\nThis calculation requires the use of conditional probability. We are given the information that the second child is clinically unaffected, and we want to find the probability that this child is a carrier.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a child is a carrier (genotype $Aa$).\nLet $U$ be the event that a child is clinically unaffected.\n\nWe need to calculate the conditional probability $P(C \\mid U)$. According to the formal definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(C \\mid U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of the conditioning event, $P(U)$. A child is unaffected if their genotype is either $AA$ or $Aa$. These are mutually exclusive events.\n$$P(U) = P(AA \\cup Aa) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nNext, we determine the probability of the intersection, $P(C \\cap U)$. This is the probability that a child is both a carrier ($C$) and unaffected ($U$). The only genotype that satisfies both conditions is $Aa$.\n$$P(C \\cap U) = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the conditional probability formula:\n$$P(C \\mid U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}}$$\n$$P(C \\mid U) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the unaffected child is a carrier is $\\frac{2}{3}$. This result can be understood intuitively: among the unaffected offspring from an $Aa \\times Aa$ cross, there are two $Aa$ individuals for every one $AA$ individual, so the chance of an unaffected child being a carrier is 2 out of 3.\n\nThe final answers are the recurrence risk ($\\frac{1}{4}$) and the carrier probability for the unaffected sibling ($\\frac{2}{3}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{2}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5075587"}, {"introduction": "While pedigree analysis is vital, genetic counselors often assess risk for individuals with no known family history of a particular condition. This requires shifting our perspective from the family to the entire population.

The genotype frequencies in zygotes are given by the probabilities of combining gametes:\n- The probability of genotype $AA$ is the probability that both gametes contribute $A$, which is $p \\times p = p^{2}$.\n- The probability of genotype $aa$ is the probability that both gametes contribute $a$, which is $q \\times q = q^{2}$.\n- The probability of genotype $Aa$ (heterozygote) is the probability of one gamete contributing $A$ and the other contributing $a$, which has two mutually exclusive ways: $A$ from one parent and $a$ from the other, or $a$ from one parent and $A$ from the other. Therefore, the probability is $p \\times q + q \\times p = 2pq$.\n\nThus, the carrier frequency (heterozygote proportion) under HWE is $2pq$.\n\nNow, apply the assumption $q \\ll 1$ and $p \\approx 1$. Since $p=1-q$, we have\n$$\n2pq = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^{2}.\n$$\nWhen $q \\ll 1$, the term $q^{2}$ is negligible compared to $q$, so the leading-order approximation is\n$$\n2pq \\approx 2q.\n$$\nThis is the carrier frequency expressed purely in terms of $q$ under the small-$q$ approximation.\n\nTherefore, the final simplified expression for the carrier frequency, in terms of $q$ only, is $2q$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2q}$$", "id": "5075584"}, {"introduction": "Genetic testing provides powerful information, but its results must be interpreted carefully within a probabilistic framework. A negative result rarely means zero risk. This hands-on practice demonstrates how to update a patient's initial population-based risk using the detection rate of a carrier screen.

Let us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the patient is a carrier.\n- $NC$: The event that the patient is not a carrier.\n- $Pos$: The event of a positive test result.\n- $Neg$: The event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The pretest (prior) probability of being a carrier: $P(C) = p = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n- The detection rate (sensitivity): $P(Pos \\mid C) = D = 0.95$.\n- The probability of a false positive is negligible, so the specificity is effectively perfect.

When $p$ is small, the product $Dp$ is also small ($Dp \\ll 1$). Consequently, the denominator of the exact expression, $1 - Dp$, is approximately equal to $1$:\n$$ 1 - Dp \\approx 1 $$\nApplying this approximation to the exact formula yields the desired approximate expression for the residual carrier probability:\n$$ P(C \\mid Neg) \\approx (1 - D)p $$\nThis approximation is physically meaningful: when the condition is rare, the vast majority of negative test results come from true non-carriers, so the total probability of a negative result is close to $1$.
