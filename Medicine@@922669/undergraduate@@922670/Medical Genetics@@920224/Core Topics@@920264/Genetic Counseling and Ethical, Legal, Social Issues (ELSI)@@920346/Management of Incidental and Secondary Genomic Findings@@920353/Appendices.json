A test with high sensitivity and specificity can feel definitive, but this intuition can be misleading, especially for rare conditions. This exercise [@problem_id:5055933] guides you through a foundational calculation using Bayes' theorem to determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), revealing the actual probability that a positive screen is correct. Mastering this concept is essential for appreciating why confirmatory testing is a non-negotiable cornerstone of managing incidental findings.", "problem": "A regional health system is implementing opportunistic screening for incidental pathogenic variants in a set of medically actionable genes recommended for disclosure. The screening assay has analytically validated test characteristics and is used in individuals undergoing genome sequencing for non-genetic indications. Assume that the true prevalence of carrying a pathogenic variant in the actionable set for this population is $Prev = 0.002$. The assay’s sensitivity (the probability of a positive test given the variant is truly present) is $Se = 0.99$, and its specificity (the probability of a negative test given the variant is truly absent) is $Sp = 0.995$.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and the canonical definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), defined as the probability that a person truly carries a pathogenic variant given a positive screen. Then compute the numeric value of $PPV$ for the parameters given. Round your answer to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (not a percentage). Finally, based on this value, briefly explain whether immediate disclosure of a positive incidental finding is justified, or if confirmatory testing prior to disclosure is indicated, grounding your reasoning in the quantitative result and standard principles for managing incidental and secondary genomic findings in medical genetics. Do not include any qualitative interpretation in your final numeric answer.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the problem asks for a standard application of Bayes' theorem in a medical diagnostics context, which is a valid and formalizable task. The provided parameters are realistic for genetic screening. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a person truly carries a pathogenic variant, and let $D^c$ be the event that the person does not. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The prevalence of the condition, $P(D) = Prev = 0.002$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay, $P(T^+ | D) = Se = 0.99$.\n3.  The specificity of the assay, $P(T^- | D^c) = Sp = 0.995$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce:\n- The probability of not having the condition is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - Prev = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$.\n- The probability of a positive test in a person without the variant (the false positive rate) is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that a person has the variant given a positive test result, denoted $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the PPV is given by:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, this can be expanded to:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV, we get:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis is the general expression for PPV. Now, we substitute the standard symbols for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity. The derived expression for PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot Prev}{Se \\cdot Prev + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - Prev)}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the numeric value of the PPV using the provided parameters: $Prev = 0.002$, $Se = 0.99$, and $Sp = 0.995$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.002}{0.99 \\cdot 0.002 + (1 - 0.995) \\cdot (1 - 0.002)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nNumerator (True Positives probability): $0.99 \\cdot 0.002 = 0.00198$.\nDenominator term 1 (True Positives probability): $0.00198$.\nDenominator term 2 (False Positives probability): $(0.005) \\cdot (0.998) = 0.00499$.\nNow, we compute the final value:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.00198}{0.00198 + 0.00499} = \\frac{0.00198}{0.00697}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.28407459...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the numeric value is $0.2841$.\n\nFinally, we address the clinical interpretation. A Positive Predictive Value of $0.2841$ means that when a patient receives a positive screening result, there is only a $28.41\\%$ chance that they truly have the pathogenic variant. Conversely, there is a $71.59\\%$ chance that the result is a false positive. According to standard principles for managing incidental and secondary genomic findings, such as those established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), a screening result is not considered a definitive diagnosis. Given that a positive result in this scenario is substantially more likely to be false than true, immediate disclosure of this finding to the patient would be inappropriate and potentially harmful, as it could cause significant distress and lead to unwarranted medical decisions. The low-to-moderate PPV mandates that a confirmatory test be performed using an independent and analytically validated method (e.g., Sanger sequencing) to verify the finding. Only a confirmed positive result should be disclosed to the patient as a definitive diagnosis.

This problem [@problem_id:5055885] delves into the practice of variant curation, a core skill in medical genetics that leverages large-scale population databases. You will apply the logic behind the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Benign Strong 1 (BS1) criterion by calculating a \"maximum credible allele frequency\" for a pathogenic variant.

Use Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and the definition of penetrance to derive, from first principles, the maximum credible allele frequency $f^{*}$ at which a single pathogenic variant could plausibly exist without exceeding the disease burden it could cause. Then calculate $f$ from the gnomAD counts, compare $f$ to $f^{*}$, and define a disclosure decision variable $D$ using the following rule based on the ACMG/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) Benign Strong $1$ (BS1) criterion and an institutional policy that discloses only pathogenic or likely pathogenic secondary findings:\n\n- If $f>f^{*}$ (i.e., BS1 applies, favoring a benign classification in the absence of other pathogenic evidence), set $D=0$ (do not disclose).\n- If $f\\le f^{*}$ (BS1 does not apply), set $D=1$ (disclose, given gene actionability and absent conflicting benign evidence).\n\nReport the single numeric value of $D$ as your final answer. No rounding is required and no units should be included.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a disclosure decision variable, $D$, for an incidental genetic variant. This decision is based on a comparison between the variant's observed allele frequency, $f$, and a calculated maximum credible allele frequency, $f^{*}$, for a pathogenic variant. If the observed frequency exceeds this maximum ($f > f^{*}$), the variant is too common to be a pathogenic cause of the disease under the given model, triggering the Benign Strong 1 (BS1) criterion and leading to a decision not to disclose ($D=0$). Otherwise ($f \\le f^{*}$), the variant's frequency is consistent with pathogenicity, and disclosure is warranted ($D=1$).\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for $f^{*}$ from first principles.\nLet $\\pi$ be the total prevalence of the disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) in the adult population.\nLet $g$ be the proportion of the disease attributable to pathogenic variants in the gene *MYH7*.\nThe prevalence of the disease specifically caused by *MYH7* variants is therefore $\\pi_{MYH7} = \\pi \\cdot g$.\n\nThe problem states that $a$ is a conservative upper bound on the fraction of *MYH7* cases attributable to any single pathogenic variant. Therefore, the maximum disease prevalence that can be explained by a single pathogenic *MYH7* variant, $\\pi_{variant}$, is given by:\n$$ \\pi_{variant} = \\pi_{MYH7} \\cdot a = \\pi \\cdot g \\cdot a $$\n\nNext, we relate this disease prevalence to the allele frequency of the variant, $f^{*}$, using principles of population genetics. The disease is autosomal dominant. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle, for a rare allele with frequency $f^{*}$, the population consists of individuals with three genotypes: wild-type/wild-type, wild-type/variant (heterozygote), and variant/variant (homozygote). Their frequencies are approximately $(1-f^{*})^2$, $2f^{*}(1-f^{*})$, and $(f^{*})^2$, respectively.\n\nFor a rare disease allele, $f^{*} \\ll 1$, which allows for simplification. The frequency of heterozygotes can be approximated as $2f^{*}(1-f^{*}) \\approx 2f^{*}$. The frequency of homozygotes, $(f^{*})^2$, is negligible compared to the heterozygote frequency. We can therefore reasonably assume that nearly all individuals carrying the variant are heterozygotes.\n\nLet $\\rho$ be the penetrance of the variant, defined as the probability that a heterozygous individual will manifest the disease. The prevalence of the disease caused by this specific variant, $\\pi_{variant}$, can be expressed as the frequency of carriers multiplied by the penetrance:\n$$ \\pi_{variant} \\approx (\\text{frequency of heterozygotes}) \\times \\rho \\approx (2f^{*}) \\cdot \\rho $$\n\nBy equating the two derived expressions for $\\pi_{variant}$, we can establish a relationship between the disease parameters and the maximum credible allele frequency, $f^{*}$:\n$$ \\pi \\cdot g \\cdot a = 2f^{*}\\rho $$\n\nSolving for $f^{*}$ yields the formula for the maximum credible allele frequency for a pathogenic variant under the specified model:\n$$ f^{*} = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot g \\cdot a}{2\\rho} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula to calculate the numerical value of $f^{*}$:\n- Total disease prevalence, $\\pi = 2 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- Proportion of disease due to *MYH7*, $g = 0.4$\n- Fraction of *MYH7* cases due to a single variant, $a = 0.02$\n- Variant penetrance, $\\rho = 0.6$\n\n$$ f^{*} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (0.4) \\cdot (0.02)}{2 \\cdot (0.6)} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 0.008}{1.2} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.2} $$\nTo simplify this fraction:\n$$ f^{*} = \\frac{1.6}{1.2} \\times 10^{-5} = \\frac{16}{12} \\times 10^{-5} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThe next step is to calculate the observed allele frequency, $f$, from the provided gnomAD population data:\n- Allele Count, $AC = 75$\n- Allele Number, $AN = 250000$\n\nThe allele frequency $f$ is the ratio of the allele count to the total number of alleles genotyped:\n$$ f = \\frac{AC}{AN} = \\frac{75}{250000} = \\frac{3 \\times 25}{100 \\times 2500} = \\frac{3}{10000} = 3 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n\nFinally, we compare the observed frequency $f$ with the maximum credible frequency $f^{*}$ to determine the value of the decision variable $D$.\n- $f = 3 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- $f^{*} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nTo facilitate comparison, we express both frequencies with the same power of $10$:\n- $f = 3 \\times 10^{-4} = 30 \\times 10^{-5}$\n- $f^{*} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nComparing the two values, we see that $30 > \\frac{4}{3}$. Therefore, $f > f^{*}$.\n\nThe rule for the disclosure decision variable $D$ is:\n- If $f > f^{*}$, set $D=0$.\n- If $f \\le f^{*}$, set $D=1$.\n\nSince our calculated $f$ is greater than $f^{*}$, the condition for the BS1 criterion is met. The allele is too frequent in the general population to be a plausible cause of the disease given the specified parameters of prevalence, genetic architecture, and penetrance.
