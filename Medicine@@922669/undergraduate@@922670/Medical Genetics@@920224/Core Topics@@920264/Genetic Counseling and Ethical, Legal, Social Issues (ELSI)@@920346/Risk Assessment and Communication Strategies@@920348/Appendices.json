The problem requires a standard, formalizable calculation used in risk assessment.\n\nLet $p_0$ represent the baseline absolute risk (probability) for the general population, and $p'$ represent the carrier's absolute risk. The problem provides $OR=3$ for the odds ratio and a baseline risk of $p_0 = 0.05$. The task is to derive and compute $p'$.\n\nThe derivation follows the three steps outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we define the odds of an event with probability $P$ as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. The baseline odds for the general population, which we denote as $\\text{odds}_0$, are calculated from the baseline probability $p_0$:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $p_0 = 0.05$:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_0 = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}\n$$\n\nSecond, the odds ratio ($OR$) is defined as the ratio of the odds for the group with the variant (carriers) to the odds for the baseline group (general population). Let $\\text{odds}'$ be the odds for a carrier.

The relationship between probability and odds is invertible. Given the odds, the probability $p'$ is calculated as:\n$$\np' = \\frac{\\text{odds}'}{1 + \\text{odds}'}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\text{odds}'$:\n$$\np' = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{1 + \\frac{3}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{\\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{3}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{\\frac{22}{19}} = \\frac{3}{22}\n$$\n\nTo derive a general formula for $p'$ in terms of $p_0$ and $OR$, we can substitute the symbolic expressions:\n$$\np' = \\frac{\\text{odds}'}{1 + \\text{odds}'} = \\frac{OR \\times \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}}{1 + OR \\times \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1 - p_0)$:\n$$\np' = \\frac{OR \\times p_0}{(1 - p_0) + (OR \\times p_0)} = \\frac{OR \\cdot p_0}{1 - p_0 + OR \\cdot p_0}\n$$\nUsing this general formula with the given values $OR=3$ and $p_0=0.05$ confirms our result:\n$$\np' = \\frac{3 \\times 0.05}{1 - 0.05 + (3 \\times 0.05)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.95 + 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{1.10} = \\frac{15}{110} = \\frac{3}{22}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $p'$ and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\np' = \\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.13636363...\n$$\nThe first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $6$, and $3$.

In logistic regression, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) of disease is modeled as linear in predictors. For a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with additive coding, the model can be described as\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) \\text{ is linear in the predictors,}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the disease probability. In an additive genetic model, each SNP contributes a term proportional to its genotype count and its per-allele effect size on the log-odds scale. These per-allele effect sizes are typically denoted $\\beta_{j}$ for SNP $j$, and the genotype counts are $G_{j} \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ for the number of effect alleles. Under additivity on the log-odds scale, the genetic component of the log-odds is the sum of the per-allele contributions.\n\nA polygenic risk score (PRS) is an aggregate quantity that captures the genetic component of risk by summing these per-allele log-odds contributions. Conceptually, it represents the portion of the log-odds attributable to the set of SNPs under consideration. Given three SNPs with effect sizes $\\beta=(0.2, 0.1, -0.05)$ and genotypes $(2, 1, 0)$, the PRS is obtained by summing the three contributions:\n$$\n\\text{PRS} = (0.2)\\cdot 2 + (0.1)\\cdot 1 + (-0.05)\\cdot 0.\n$$\nCompute term by term:\n$$\n(0.2)\\cdot 2 = 0.4, \\quad (0.1)\\cdot 1 = 0.1, \\quad (-0.05)\\cdot 0 = 0.\n$$\nSumming these,\n$$\n\\text{PRS} = 0.4 + 0.1 + 0 = 0.5.\n$$\n\nInterpretation relative to baseline: Because the PRS is on the log-odds scale, a positive value indicates an increase in log-odds relative to the baseline intercept (the non-genetic part of the model), whereas a negative value indicates a decrease relative to baseline. Here, $\\text{PRS} = 0.5$ is positive, so it raises risk relative to the baseline.\n\nFor communication, it is often helpful to connect the log-odds to an odds ratio, which is multiplicative on the odds scale. The odds ratio corresponding to the PRS is\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\exp(\\text{PRS}) = \\exp(0.5).\n$$\nThis value is greater than $1$, reinforcing that the genetic profile increases odds relative to baseline. If baseline probability $p$ were known, one could translate this into an updated probability using\n$$\n\\text{updated odds} = \\text{OR} \\times \\frac{p}{1-p}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{\\text{updated}} = \\frac{\\text{OR}\\cdot p}{1 - p + \\text{OR}\\cdot p}.\n$$\nIn patient-centered risk communication, one might explain that the genetic profile increases the odds by a factor of $\\exp(0.5)$, while also emphasizing that the absolute change in probability depends on the baseline risk and that the PRS represents only the genetic component, not environmental or clinical factors.
