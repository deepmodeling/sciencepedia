There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the time $T$**\n\nThe rate of change of the SCh concentration, $C(t)$, in a single compartment where elimination is governed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics is described by the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of elimination and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant, which is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{\\max}$. The negative sign indicates that the concentration is decreasing over time.\n\nTo find the time $T$ required for the concentration to decrease from an initial value $C_{0}$ to a threshold value $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, we must solve this differential equation. We can separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\ndt = - \\frac{K_{m} + C}{V_{\\max} C} dC\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The time $t$ goes from $0$ to $T$, while the concentration $C$ goes from $C_0$ to $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{C_{0}}^{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}} - \\frac{K_{m} + C}{V_{\\max} C} dC\n$$\nTo simplify the integration, we can reverse the limits of integration on the right side, which removes the negative sign:\n$$\nT = \\int_{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}^{C_{0}} \\frac{K_{m} + C}{V_{\\max} C} dC\n$$\nWe can separate the integrand into two terms:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\int_{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}^{C_{0}} \\left( \\frac{K_{m}}{C} + 1 \\right) dC\n$$\nNow, we perform the integration with respect to $C$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_{m} \\ln|C| + C \\right]_{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}^{C_{0}}\n$$\nSince concentration is always non-negative, the absolute value is not necessary. Evaluating the definite integral gives:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( (K_{m} \\ln(C_{0}) + C_{0}) - (K_{m} \\ln(C_{\\mathrm{thr}}) + C_{\\mathrm{thr}}) \\right)\n$$\nCombining the terms, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for $T$:\n$$\nT = T(V_{\\max}, K_{m}, C_{0}, C_{\\mathrm{thr}}) = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the ratio $R(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe problem states that a BChE-deficient individual has a total enzyme concentration that is a fraction $\\alpha$ of the normal concentration. The maximal velocity $V_{\\max}$ is directly proportional to the total enzyme concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$, stated as $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n\nLet $V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}$ be the maximal velocity in an individual with normal BChE levels, corresponding to an enzyme concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{T, normal}}$.\n$$V_{\\max, \\text{normal}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{T, normal}}$$\nFor a deficient individual, the enzyme concentration is $[E]_{\\mathrm{T, deficient}} = \\alpha [E]_{\\mathrm{T, normal}}$. The corresponding maximal velocity is:\n$$V_{\\max, \\text{deficient}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{T, deficient}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} (\\alpha [E]_{\\mathrm{T, normal}}) = \\alpha (k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{T, normal}}) = \\alpha V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}$$\nThe problem specifies that $K_{m}$ is unchanged. The initial concentration $C_{0}$ (determined by dose and volume of distribution) and the threshold concentration $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ (a clinical definition) are also independent of the enzyme variant.\n\nUsing the expression for $T$ derived in Part 1, we can write the time for a normal and a deficient individual:\n$$T_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)$$\n$$T_{\\text{deficient}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max, \\text{deficient}}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)$$\nsubstituting $V_{\\max, \\text{deficient}} = \\alpha V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}$ into the expression for $T_{\\text{deficient}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{deficient}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)$$\nNow we compute the ratio $R(\\alpha) = \\dfrac{T_{\\text{deficient}}}{T_{\\text{normal}}}$:\n$$\nR(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\alpha V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) + C_{0} - C_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe term in the large parentheses is a non-zero constant that cancels out, as does $V_{\\max, \\text{normal}}$. This leaves a remarkably simple result:\n$$\nR(\\alpha) = \\frac{1/\\alpha}{1} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the duration of action of succinylcholine is inversely proportional to the fractional activity of the BChE enzyme, a direct consequence of the structure of the Michaelis-Menten rate law.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical evaluation of $R(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $R(\\alpha)$ when the enzyme concentration is reduced to a fraction $\\alpha = 0.250$ of normal.\nUsing the expression from Part 2:\n$$\nR(0.250) = \\frac{1}{0.250} = 4\n$$\nThe input value $\\alpha = 0.250$ is given with three significant figures. The numerator $1$ is an exact number. Therefore, the result should be reported to three significant figures.\n$$\nR(0.250) = 4.00\n$$\nThis result implies that an individual with only $25\\%$ of the normal BChE activity will experience the effects of succinylcholine for a duration that is $4$ times longer than a person with normal enzyme activity, under the assumptions of this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00}$$", "id": "5017466"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the individual to the population level is crucial for public health and genetic counseling.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and conditions to derive the requested expressions and provide the conceptual explanation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the expected frequency of the homozygous genotype $A/A$ in a single, large, randomly mating population under Hardy-Weinberg conditions. The second part asks for a conceptual explanation of how population subdivision affects this frequency.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Homozygote Frequency in a Panmictic Population**\n\nWe are given a single autosomal locus with two alleles, $A$ (atypical) and $N$ (normal). The frequency of allele $A$ in the population's gene pool is denoted by $p$, and the frequency of allele $N$ is denoted by $q$. By definition, the sum of allele frequencies at a locus must be $1$, so $p + q = 1$.\n\nThe problem states the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: a large population size (implying negligible genetic drift), random mating (panmixia), no selection, no mutation, and no migration. Under these conditions, the allele and genotype frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next.\n\nThe formation of genotypes in the offspring generation can be modeled as the random union of gametes drawn from the gene pool of the parent generation. The probability that a randomly selected gamete (either sperm or egg) carries the $A$ allele is equal to its frequency in the gene pool, which is $p$. Similarly, the probability that a randomly selected gamete carries the $N$ allele is $q$.\n\nAn individual with the homozygous genotype $A/A$ is formed by the fusion of two gametes, both of which must carry the $A$ allele. Since mating is random, the choice of the two gametes that form a zygote are independent events. The probability of two independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the $A/A$ genotype as $f(A/A)$.\nThe probability that the sperm cell carries allele $A$ is $p$.\nThe probability that the egg cell carries allele $A$ is $p$.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the $A/A$ genotype is:\n$$f(A/A) = (\\text{Probability of A in sperm}) \\times (\\text{Probability of A in egg}) = p \\times p = p^2$$\n\nSimilarly, we can determine the frequencies of the other genotypes:\nThe frequency of the homozygous genotype $N/N$ is $f(N/N) = q \\times q = q^2$.\nThe frequency of the heterozygous genotype $A/N$ is the sum of two possibilities: an $A$ sperm fertilizing an $N$ egg (probability $p \\times q$) and an $N$ sperm fertilizing an $A$ egg (probability $q \\times p$).\n$$f(A/N) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq$$\n\nThe sum of the genotype frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$f(A/A) + f(A/N) + f(N/N) = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the derivation. The expected frequency of the $A/A$ homozygote in terms of $p$ is $p^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Population Subdivision (Wahlund Effect)**\n\nThe second part of the problem describes a scenario of population subdivision. The total population is composed of two subpopulations that do not interbreed.\n- Subpopulation $1$ comprises a proportion $w$ of the total population and has an allele $A$ frequency of $p_1$.\n- Subpopulation $2$ comprises a proportion $1 - w$ of the total population and has an allele $A$ frequency of $p_2$.\n\nWithin each subpopulation, mating is random, meaning each subpopulation is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to its own allele frequencies.\n- In subpopulation $1$, the frequency of $A/A$ homozygotes is $f_1(A/A) = p_1^2$.\n- In subpopulation $2$, the frequency of $A/A$ homozygotes is $f_2(A/A) = p_2^2$.\n\nThe overall frequency of $A/A$ homozygotes in the total population, $f_{total}(A/A)$, is the weighted average of the frequencies in the two subpopulations:\n$$f_{total}(A/A) = w \\cdot f_1(A/A) + (1-w) \\cdot f_2(A/A) = w p_1^2 + (1-w) p_2^2$$\n\nNow, we must compare this to the expected frequency in a hypothetical single panmictic population with an equivalent overall allele frequency. The average allele frequency, $\\bar{p}$, across the total population is given as:\n$$\\bar{p} = w p_1 + (1-w) p_2$$\nIf the two subpopulations were to merge and mate randomly (i.e., form a single panmictic population), the expected frequency of $A/A$ homozygotes, $f_{panmictic}(A/A)$, would be $(\\bar{p})^2$:\n$$f_{panmictic}(A/A) = (\\bar{p})^2 = (w p_1 + (1-w) p_2)^2$$\n\nPopulation structure changes the expected overall frequency of homozygotes because the average of the squares is not equal to the square of the average. The function $f(x) = x^2$ is a convex function. For any convex function, Jensen's inequality states that the expected value of the function of a random variable is greater than or equal to the function of the expected value of the random variable. In this context, the frequency of $A/A$ homozygotes in the subdivided population, $w p_1^2 + (1-w) p_2^2$, is the expectation of the squared allele frequency. The frequency in the hypothetical panmictic population, $(w p_1 + (1-w) p_2)^2$, is the square of the expected allele frequency.\n\nTherefore, $w p_1^2 + (1-w) p_2^2 \\ge (w p_1 + (1-w) p_2)^2$. Equality holds only if $p_1 = p_2$, in which case there is no genetic differentiation between the subpopulations.\n\nIn words, population subdivision increases the overall frequency of homozygotes (and decreases the frequency of heterozygotes) compared to what would be expected if the entire population were mating randomly. This phenomenon is known as the Wahlund effect. The lack of gene flow between subpopulations prevents the \"averaging\" of allele frequencies that occurs through the formation of heterozygotes in a panmictic population. Consequently, homozygotes are more common in a structured population than in a single, unstructured population with the same overall allele frequencies. This is because homozygote frequencies depend on squared allele frequencies, and squaring values before averaging them (as is the case in a subdivided population) yields a larger result than averaging the values first and then squaring the average (as is the case for a panmictic population).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p^2}$$", "id": "5017520"}]}
