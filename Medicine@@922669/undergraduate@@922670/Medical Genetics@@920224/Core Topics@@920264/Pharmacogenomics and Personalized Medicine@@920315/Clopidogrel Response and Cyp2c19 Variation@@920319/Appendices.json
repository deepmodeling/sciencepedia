For a prodrug like clopidogrel, the speed of its activation by an enzyme is the critical first step. This exercise uses the classic Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics to quantify how a change in genotype, such as being a *CYP2C19* poor metabolizer, directly impacts the rate of drug activation. By calculating the change in metabolic flux, you will gain a concrete understanding of the biochemical basis for variable drug response [@problem_id:5021794].", "problem": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires bioactivation in the liver to an active thiol metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y12 receptor. The rate-limiting oxidative step is catalyzed predominantly by Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19). Consider an in vitro hepatic microsomal system in which formation of the active metabolite from clopidogrel behaves as a single-enzyme, single-substrate system under the quasi–steady-state assumption. Assume that the catalytic efficiency differences between genotypes arise from changes in the maximal velocity due to altered functional enzyme abundance, while substrate affinity is unchanged across genotypes.\n\nLet the normal metabolizer genotype (*CYP2C19* *1/*1*) have a maximal velocity $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}}$ equal to $120$ pmol per minute per milligram of microsomal protein, and the poor metabolizer genotype (e.g., *CYP2C19* *2/*2*) have a maximal velocity $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}}$ equal to $18$ pmol per minute per milligram of microsomal protein. Let the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ be the same for both genotypes and equal to $6$ micromolar. During a short infusion experiment, the free intrahepatic clopidogrel concentration is held constant at $C = 3$ micromolar.\n\nUsing only the standard single-enzyme mechanism under the quasi–steady-state assumption and the definition of maximal velocity in enzyme kinetics, compute the fold-change in metabolic flux to the active metabolite for the poor metabolizer relative to the normal metabolizer, defined as $v_{\\mathrm{P}}/v_{\\mathrm{N}}$, at the stated substrate concentration. Express your final answer as a decimal with no units, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fold-change in metabolic flux for a poor metabolizer relative to a normal metabolizer of clopidogrel. The system is described as a single-enzyme, single-substrate reaction that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics under the quasi-steady-state assumption.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing this system is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which relates the initial reaction velocity ($v$) to the substrate concentration ($[S]$), the maximum velocity ($V_{\\max}$), and the Michaelis constant ($K_{m}$):\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the normal metabolizer (N) and poor metabolizer (P) genotypes:\n\nFor the normal metabolizer (genotype *CYP2C19* *1/*1*):\nThe maximal velocity is $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}} = 120$ pmol per minute per milligram of microsomal protein.\n\nFor the poor metabolizer (genotype e.g., *CYP2C19* *2/*2*):\nThe maximal velocity is $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}} = 18$ pmol per minute per milligram of microsomal protein.\n\nFor both genotypes, the Michaelis constant is the same:\n$K_{m} = 6$ micromolar.\n\nThe intrahepatic clopidogrel concentration, which serves as the substrate concentration $[S]$, is held constant at:\n$[S] = C = 3$ micromolar.\n\nThe problem states that the difference between genotypes is due to altered functional enzyme abundance, which manifests as a change in $V_{\\max}$, while the substrate affinity, reflected by $K_m$, remains constant. This is consistent with the provided data.\n\nFirst, we write the expression for the metabolic flux (velocity) for the normal metabolizer, $v_{\\mathrm{N}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}\n$$\n\nNext, we write the expression for the metabolic flux for the poor metabolizer, $v_{\\mathrm{P}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change in metabolic flux for the poor metabolizer relative to the normal metabolizer, which is the ratio $\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{P}}}{v_{\\mathrm{N}}}$. We can construct this ratio using the expressions above:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{P}}}{v_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This simplification is a direct consequence of the fact that the substrate concentration $[S]$ and the Michaelis constant $K_m$ are identical for both conditions being compared.\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{P}}}{v_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}}}{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}}}\n$$\nThis result shows that, under the given assumptions, the ratio of the reaction velocities at any constant substrate concentration is simply equal to the ratio of the maximal velocities. The specific values of $K_m$ and $[S]$ are not needed to calculate this ratio, although they would be required to calculate the absolute velocities $v_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{P}}$ and $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{N}}$ into the simplified expression:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{P}}}{v_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{18}{120}\n$$\n\nCalculating this fraction gives:\n$$\n\\frac{18}{120} = \\frac{3 \\times 6}{20 \\times 6} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.15$. To express this with four significant figures, we append two trailing zeros.\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{P}}}{v_{\\mathrm{N}}} = 0.1500\n$$\nThus, the metabolic flux to the active metabolite for the poor metabolizer is $0.1500$ times that of the normal metabolizer at the specified substrate concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1500}$$", "id": "5021794"}, {"introduction": "A change in enzyme function is only clinically meaningful if it leads to a different health outcome.
