The relationship between the *VKORC1* gene, its protein product's role as the target of warfarin, and the effect of the -1639G>A polymorphism (rs9923231) on warfarin dose is a foundational concept in the field. The premise that warfarin dose requirement is proportional to the amount of target enzyme is a scientifically plausible and common simplifying assumption in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling. The relative expression levels, with the $\\mathrm{G}$ allele associated with higher expression and the $\\mathrm{A}$ allele with lower expression, are consistent with published scientific literature. The problem does not violate fundamental principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, quantitative relationship (direct proportionality) and all necessary numerical data to compute a unique answer. The question is specific and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, objective, and uses standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws from the invalidity checklist. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and asks for a verifiable calculation based on the premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ represent the expected steady-state maintenance dose of warfarin, and let $E$ represent the relative expression level of VKORC1. The subscripts $\\mathrm{GG}$ and $\\mathrm{AA}$ will denote the respective genotypes.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following given values for relative expression:\n$$ E_{GG} = 1.0 $$\n$$ E_{AA} = 0.3 $$\n\nThe core premise is that the dose scales directly with the expression level. This relationship can be formulated as a direct proportionality:\n$$ D \\propto E $$\nThis implies that there exists a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that:\n$$ D = kE $$\nwhere $k$ encapsulates all other factors affecting the dose that are held constant across the genotypes, such as target INR, patient weight, and other metabolic pathways.\n\nApplying this relationship to the genotypes of interest, we have:\n$$ D_{GG} = k \\cdot E_{GG} $$\n$$ D_{AA} = k \\cdot E_{AA} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"reduction in expected maintenance dose for genotype $\\mathrm{AA}$ relative to genotype $\\mathrm{GG}$\". This is a measure of relative change, which is calculated by taking the absolute change and dividing it by the reference value. The reference genotype is $\\mathrm{GG}$.\nLet $R$ be the relative reduction. The formula for $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\frac{D_{GG} - D_{AA}}{D_{GG}} $$\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $D_{GG}$ and $D_{AA}$ from the proportionality relationship into this formula:\n$$ R = \\frac{k \\cdot E_{GG} - k \\cdot E_{AA}}{k \\cdot E_{GG}} $$\n\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ is non-zero (otherwise the dose would always be zero) and thus can be factored out and cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ R = \\frac{k(E_{GG} - E_{AA})}{k \\cdot E_{GG}} = \\frac{E_{GG} - E_{AA}}{E_{GG}} $$\n\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$ R = 1 - \\frac{E_{AA}}{E_{GG}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the relative expression levels, $E_{GG} = 1.0$ and $E_{AA} = 0.3$:\n$$ R = 1 - \\frac{0.3}{1.0} $$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ R = 1 - 0.3 $$\n$$ R = 0.7 $$\n\nThe reduction in expected maintenance dose for an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{AA}$ relative to an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{GG}$ is $0.7$. This is already in the requested decimal fraction format.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7}$$", "id": "5070751"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the drug's target, its clearance from the body—a key pharmacokinetic parameter—is also under genetic control. This practice shifts our focus to warfarin's metabolism, which is primarily handled by the CYP2C9 enzyme. You will explore how a common reduced-function *CYP2C9* allele slows down warfarin clearance, thereby increasing its half-life in the body [@problem_id:5070765].

The relationships between half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance are fundamental. The role of CYP2C9 in warfarin metabolism, the impact of the $*3$ allele, and the characterization of warfarin as a low extraction drug are all scientifically accurate.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to determine a unique numerical answer for the patient's half-life.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and objective, using standard terminology from the field.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided data are self-consistent. The statement that $V_d$ is genotype-independent is consistent with providing a single value $V_d = 10 \\text{ L}$ for the patient, which thus also applies to the wild-type. The problem is self-contained and requires no external information.\n- **Feasibility**: The numerical values given ($V_d = 10 \\text{ L}$, $t_{1/2, wild-type} = 36 \\text{ h}$, clearance reduction factor of $0.40$) are realistic for warfarin and CYP2C9 genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the fundamental principles of first-order elimination kinetics. The half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of a drug is related to its volume of distribution ($V_d$) and its total body clearance ($CL$) by the equation:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{CL}$$\nLet the subscript 'wt' denote a wild-type individual and 'p' denote the patient with the CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype.\n\nFor the wild-type individual, the half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2, wt} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_{d, wt}}{CL_{wt}}$$\nFor the patient, the half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2, p} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_{d, p}}{CL_p}$$\nThe problem states that the volume of distribution is genotype-independent, therefore:\n$$V_{d, p} = V_{d, wt} = V_d = 10 \\text{ L}$$\nThe problem also states that warfarin is a low extraction drug and that it is primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism. This means we can approximate the total clearance $CL$ with the hepatic clearance $CL_H$. For low extraction drugs, the hepatic clearance is approximately proportional to the intrinsic clearance of the metabolizing enzymes, $CL_{int}$, and the fraction of unbound drug, $f_u$. The relationship is $CL_H \\approx f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$. Since genetics are not stated to affect protein binding, $f_u$ can be considered constant between the patient and the wild-type. The problem simplifies this by stating that $CL_H$ scales in proportion to $CL_{int}$. Therefore, we can establish the proportionality relationship:\n$$CL \\approx CL_H \\propto CL_{int}$$\nThis is the proportionality relationship used in this solution. This implies that the ratio of clearances between the patient and the wild-type is equal to the ratio of their intrinsic clearances:\n$$\\frac{CL_p}{CL_{wt}} = \\frac{CL_{int, p}}{CL_{int, wt}}$$\nWe are given that the patient's intrinsic clearance is $0.40$ times that of a wild-type individual:\n$$CL_{int, p} = 0.40 \\cdot CL_{int, wt}$$\nSubstituting this into the ratio of clearances gives:\n$$\\frac{CL_p}{CL_{wt}} = \\frac{0.40 \\cdot CL_{int, wt}}{CL_{int, wt}} = 0.40$$\nSo, the patient's clearance is $CL_p = 0.40 \\cdot CL_{wt}$.\n\nTo find the patient's half-life, we can take the ratio of the half-life equations for the patient and the wild-type:\n$$\\frac{t_{1/2, p}}{t_{1/2, wt}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{CL_p}}{\\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{CL_{wt}}}$$\nThe terms $\\ln(2)$ and $V_d$ cancel out, yielding a simple inverse relationship between half-life and clearance:\n$$\\frac{t_{1/2, p}}{t_{1/2, wt}} = \\frac{CL_{wt}}{CL_p}$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the patient's clearance and the wild-type's clearance:\n$$\\frac{t_{1/2, p}}{t_{1/2, wt}} = \\frac{CL_{wt}}{0.40 \\cdot CL_{wt}} = \\frac{1}{0.40} = 2.5$$\nWe can now solve for the patient's half-life, $t_{1/2, p}$, by multiplying the wild-type half-life by this factor:\n$$t_{1/2, p} = 2.5 \\cdot t_{1/2, wt}$$\nUsing the given wild-type half-life of $t_{1/2, wt} = 36 \\text{ h}$:\n$$t_{1/2, p} = 2.5 \\cdot 36 \\text{ h} = 90 \\text{ h}$$\nA decrease in clearance leads to a proportional increase in half-life. A reduction of clearance to $40\\%$ of the original value results in the half-life increasing by a factor of $1/0.40 = 2.5$.\nThe calculated value is $90$. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
