In pharmacogenetics, the widely applied principle is that gene dosage scales enzyme capacity: each allelic copy contributes an amount proportional to its functional class, and the total capacity is the additive sum of contributions from all copies. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines operationalize this with an additive “activity score,” where each allele’s per-copy functional class is assigned a value and copy-number variation multiplies that value per copy.\n\nAssume the following allele function classes and per-copy values: normal function $= 1.0$, decreased function $= 0.5$, and nonfunctional $= 0$.

The solution must be derived from fundamental pharmacokinetic principles for a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and multiple oral doses, where absorption is approximated as instantaneous.\n\nFirst, we establish the concentration dynamics. For a one-compartment model, the concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ after a single intravenous bolus dose is $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.
