It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and their application to medical diagnostics, a core topic in medical genetics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—a prior probability, sensitivity, and specificity—to calculate a unique posterior probability. The definitions and values are standard and realistic for a clinical genetics context. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the posterior probability that a patient carries a pathogenic variant given a positive test result, and then to evaluate this expression numerically. We will begin by formally defining the events and translating the given information into the language of probability theory.\n\nLet `$V$` be the event that the patient carries a pathogenic variant in the *BRCA1* gene.\nLet `$V^c$` be the complementary event that the patient does not carry such a variant.\nLet `$T^+$` be the event that the clinical assay returns a positive result.\nLet `$T^-$` be the event that the assay returns a negative result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The pre-test or prior probability of carrying the variant: `$P(V) = \\pi = 0.10$`.\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay, defined as the probability of a positive result given that the patient carries the variant: `$P(T^+ | V) = s = 0.95$`. This is the true positive rate.\n3.  The specificity of the assay, defined as the probability of a negative result given that the patient does not carry the variant: `$P(T^- | V^c) = c = 0.99$`. This is the true negative rate.\n\nFrom these givens, we can deduce two additional probabilities:\n- The prior probability of not carrying the variant is `$P(V^c) = 1 - P(V) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$`.\n- The probability of a positive result given that the patient does not carry the variant (the false positive rate) is `$P(T^+ | V^c) = 1 - P(T^- | V^c) = 1 - c = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$`.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the posterior probability `$P(V | T^+)$`, which is the probability of carrying the variant given that the test result is positive.\n\nAs per the problem's directive, we start from the axiomatic definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our specific events, we get:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{P(V \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator, `$P(V \\cap T^+)$`, is the joint probability of carrying the variant and testing positive. We can re-express this term using the definition of conditional probability again: `$P(T^+ | V) = \\frac{P(V \\cap T^+)}{P(V)}$`, which rearranges to `$P(V \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | V) P(V)$`. Substituting our symbols, the numerator is `$s\\pi$`.\n\nThe denominator, `$P(T^+)$`, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. The problem requires us to use the law of total probability. A positive result can occur via two mutually exclusive pathways:\n1.  The patient has the variant and tests positive (a true positive). The probability of this is `$P(T^+ \\cap V) = P(T^+ | V) P(V) = s\\pi$`.\n2.  The patient does not have the variant but tests positive (a false positive). The probability of this is `$P(T^+ \\cap V^c) = P(T^+ | V^c) P(V^c) = (1-c)(1-\\pi)$`.\n\nBy the law of total probability, the total probability of a positive test, `$P(T^+)$`, is the sum of the probabilities of these two pathways:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | V) P(V) + P(T^+ | V^c) P(V^c)$$\nSubstituting our symbolic representations:\n$$P(T^+) = s\\pi + (1 - c)(1 - \\pi)$$\nNow, we combine the expressions for the numerator and the denominator to obtain the final derived expression for the posterior probability, which is a form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | V) P(V)}{P(T^+ | V) P(V) + P(T^+ | V^c) P(V^c)} = \\frac{s\\pi}{s\\pi + (1 - c)(1 - \\pi)}$$\nThis completes the derivation of the general expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values: `$\\pi = 0.10$`, `$s = 0.95$`, and `$c = 0.99$`.\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the numerator:\n$$s\\pi = (0.95)(0.10) = 0.095$$\nNext, calculate the value of the denominator:\n$$s\\pi + (1 - c)(1 - \\pi) = (0.95)(0.10) + (1 - 0.99)(1 - 0.10)$$\n$$= 0.095 + (0.01)(0.90)$$\n$$= 0.095 + 0.009$$\n$$= 0.104$$\nFinally, compute the posterior probability by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$P(V | T^+) = \\frac{0.095}{0.104} \\approx 0.913461538...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are `$9$`, `$1$`, `$3$`, and `$4$`. The fifth significant figure is `$6$`, which is `$\\ge 5$`, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(V | T^+) \\approx 0.9135$$\nThus, after a positive test result, the patient's probability of carrying the *BRCA1* pathogenic variant increases from the prior probability of `$10\\%$` to a posterior probability of approximately `$91.35\\%$`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9135}$$", "id": "5045261"}, {"introduction": "Just as a positive test requires careful interpretation, so does a negative one.
