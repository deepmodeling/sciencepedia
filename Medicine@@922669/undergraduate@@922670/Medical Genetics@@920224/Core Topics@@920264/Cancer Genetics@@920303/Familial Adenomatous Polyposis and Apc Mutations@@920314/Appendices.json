This exercise focuses on a common scenario in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP): a truncating mutation in the $APC$ gene. By calculating the change in the protein's molecular weight, you will connect the genetic information to a physical, measurable property and predict how it would appear in a standard laboratory analysis like a Western blot.", "problem": "Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is commonly caused by truncating mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene that introduce premature termination codons, leading to shortened APC proteins. Consider a patient with a germline APC nonsense mutation reported at codon $1309$, a hotspot in FAP. The full-length APC protein is annotated as having $2843$ amino acids. Use the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein) and the well-established approximation that, in denaturing conditions such as Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), polypeptide migration correlates with the number of amino acids and thus with the molecular mass. Assume an average mass per amino acid of $110$ daltons. For the purpose of this calculation, define “stop at codon $1309$” to mean the truncated protein contains residues $1$ through $1308$.\n\nCompute the predicted change in molecular weight, in kilodaltons (kDa), between the full-length APC protein and the truncated protein that ends at residue $1308$. State the decrease as a single positive number corresponding to $M_{\\text{full}} - M_{\\text{trunc}}$, where $M_{\\text{full}}$ is the mass of full-length APC and $M_{\\text{trunc}}$ is the mass of the truncated variant. Round your final numeric answer to four significant figures and express it in kilodaltons (kDa). Briefly explain, in words, how this mass change would be expected to affect Western blot band positions and detection sensitivity when using an antibody that recognizes an amino-terminal epitope.\n\nProvide only the single numeric value for the mass decrease as the final answer.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular biology and genetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is formulated with objective, precise language.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the change in molecular weight between a full-length and a truncated protein, and an explanation of the consequences for a Western blot analysis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the predicted change in molecular weight. The following data are provided:\n-   The number of amino acids in the full-length APC protein, $N_{\\text{full}} = 2843$.\n-   A nonsense mutation at codon $1309$ results in a truncated protein containing amino acid residues $1$ through $1308$. Thus, the number of amino acids in the truncated protein is $N_{\\text{trunc}} = 1308$.\n-   The average mass of an amino acid is given as $m_{\\text{aa}} = 110 \\text{ Da}$.\n\nThe molecular mass of the full-length protein, $M_{\\text{full}}$, can be approximated as:\n$$M_{\\text{full}} = N_{\\text{full}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 2843 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 312730 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nThe molecular mass of the truncated protein, $M_{\\text{trunc}}$, can be approximated as:\n$$M_{\\text{trunc}} = N_{\\text{trunc}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 1308 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 143880 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the decrease in molecular weight, $\\Delta M$, which is the difference between the mass of the full-length protein and the mass of the truncated protein.\n$$\\Delta M = M_{\\text{full}} - M_{\\text{trunc}}$$\nAlternatively, this can be calculated from the number of amino acids that are lost due to the truncation. The number of lost C-terminal amino acids is:\n$$N_{\\text{lost}} = N_{\\text{full}} - N_{\\text{trunc}} = 2843 - 1308 = 1535 \\text{ amino acids}$$\nThe corresponding mass decrease is:\n$$\\Delta M = N_{\\text{lost}} \\times m_{\\text{aa}} = 1535 \\times 110 \\text{ Da} = 168850 \\text{ Da}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilodaltons (kDa). We use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ kDa} = 1000 \\text{ Da}$:\n$$\\Delta M = \\frac{168850 \\text{ Da}}{1000 \\text{ Da/kDa}} = 168.85 \\text{ kDa}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta M \\approx 168.9 \\text{ kDa}$$\n\nSecond, we explain the expected effects on a Western blot.\nIn a Western blot, proteins are first separated by SDS-PAGE, primarily based on their molecular mass. The truncated APC protein, being significantly smaller ($M_{\\text{trunc}} \\approx 143.9 \\text{ kDa}$) than the full-length protein ($M_{\\text{full}} \\approx 312.7 \\text{ kDa}$), will migrate faster through the polyacrylamide gel. Consequently, the band corresponding to the truncated protein will appear lower on the blot (i.e., will have migrated further from the loading well) than the band for the full-length protein.\n\nThe question specifies that the antibody used for detection recognizes an amino-terminal epitope. The truncated protein consists of residues $1$ through $1308$ and therefore retains the amino-terminus of the original protein. This means the antibody's epitope is present in both the full-length and the truncated protein variants. As a result, the antibody is expected to detect both forms. Regarding detection sensitivity, while the antibody's intrinsic ability to bind the epitope is unchanged, the observed signal strength on the blot depends on the abundance of the target protein. In many biological systems, mRNAs containing premature termination codons are degraded by a process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and the resulting truncated proteins are often unstable and rapidly cleared by cellular degradation machinery. This would lead to a lower steady-state concentration of the truncated protein compared to the full-length protein expressed from the wild-type allele. Therefore, on a Western blot of proteins from a heterozygous FAP patient, one would anticipate observing a band for the full-length protein and a second, typically much fainter, band at a lower molecular weight corresponding to the truncated protein.\n\nThe final answer, however, is restricted to the numerical value of the mass decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{168.9}$$", "id": "5030276"}, {"introduction": "Genetic testing is a cornerstone of managing hereditary cancer syndromes like FAP, but interpreting the results requires careful quantitative reasoning. This practice problem applies Bayes' theorem to a realistic clinical scenario, allowing you to calculate the positive predictive value of an $APC$ genetic test.

Consider a clinically validated assay that returns a binary call of a clearly pathogenic variant versus no pathogenic variant detected (variants of uncertain significance are reported separately and are not considered “positive” for this problem). In this clinic population, the pre-test probability that an evaluated proband truly carries a pathogenic APC variant is $\\pi = 0.30$.

Then, briefly interpret what this value implies for pre- and post-test counseling in this high-risk clinic setting (your interpretation will not be graded numerically, but your calculation must be correct).", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided for a unique solution using established principles of probability theory.\n\nThe task is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) for a genetic test, given the pre-test probability of the condition, and the test's sensitivity and specificity. The PPV is the posterior probability that a patient truly has the condition, given a positive test result. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n$D$: The event that a patient from the high-risk clinic truly carries a pathogenic Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) variant.\n$D^c$: The event that a patient does not carry a pathogenic APC variant.\n$T^+$: The event that the test result is positive for a pathogenic variant.\n$T^-$: The event that the test result is negative (no pathogenic variant detected).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pre-test probability, or prior probability, of carrying a pathogenic variant is given as $\\pi$.\n$$P(D) = \\pi = 0.30$$\nThe probability of not carrying a pathogenic variant is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\nThe clinical sensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the pathogenic variant.\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95$$\nThe clinical specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the pathogenic variant.\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.99$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient has the pathogenic variant given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states (having the variant or not having the variant):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe have $P(T^+ | D)$ and $P(D)$. We need to find $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a patient without the variant can either test positive or negative, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\nNow we can substitute the known values to calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95)(0.30) + (0.01)(0.70)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.285 + 0.007 = 0.292$$\nFinally, we can substitute all components back into the Bayes' theorem formula to find the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.30)}{0.292}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.285}{0.292} \\approx 0.976027397...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$PPV \\approx 0.9760$$\n\nThe primary assumption made is that the provided values for prior probability, sensitivity, and specificity are accurate for any randomly selected individual within this specific high-risk clinic population. The problem's simplification of the test outcome to a binary result (pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic), explicitly excluding variants of uncertain significance, is a necessary condition for this calculation.\n\nFor the interpretation, the calculation shows that while a patient in this high-risk clinic has a pre-test probability of $30\\%$ of carrying a pathogenic APC variant, a positive test result dramatically increases this probability to approximately $97.6\\%$. For pre-test counseling, this means explaining the initial substantial risk. For post-test counseling following a positive result, this implies that the result is highly likely to be a true positive. This high degree of certainty is critical for making significant medical decisions, such as a recommendation for prophylactic colectomy and initiating cascade testing for at-risk family members. The residual $2.4\\%$ chance of a false positive, while small, should also be communicated for informed consent.

This exercise presents such a scenario: two children have FAP, yet their parent tests negative for the mutation, raising the possibility of germline mosaicism.

FAP due to heterozygous APC pathogenic variants is an autosomal dominant condition with complete penetrance in early adulthood. Transmission from a heterozygous carrier occurs with probability $0.5$ per child.\n2. If the parent is a gonadal (germline) mosaic for the APC variant, the probability of transmitting the variant to any given child is a parameter $\\theta$ assumed to be constant across conceptions. Assume $\\theta = 0.2$.\n3. The probability that the parent’s blood NGS test is negative given gonadal mosaicism (i.e., the somatic blood cellular compartment does not carry the variant above the assay’s detection threshold) is $s_{m} = 0.9$.\n4. If the parent is not a carrier and not mosaic, each affected child arises from an independent de novo APC mutation event with probability $\\mu$ per conception.

Prior to observing any children, the prior probability that this parent is a gonadal mosaic for the APC variant is $\\pi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, reflecting the rarity of pathogenic APC gonadal mosaicism at the population level.\n6. Conditional on the parental state (mosaic versus non-carrier), transmissions to different offspring are independent events, and the blood test result is independent of transmissions given the parental state.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and treating the two affected children and the negative blood test as the observed data, compute the posterior probability that the parent is a gonadal mosaic, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{mosaic} \\mid \\text{two affected children, negative blood test})$.
