The first part requires the derivation of the heterozygous carrier frequency under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and its numerical evaluation. The second part requires a conceptual explanation of how selection against heterozygotes affects genotype frequencies.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation and Calculation under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium\n\nWe begin by defining the alleles at a single locus. Let $A$ represent the pathogenic allele (e.g., in $BRCA1$ or $BRCA2$) and $a$ represent the non-pathogenic, or wild-type, allele.\nThe frequency of the pathogenic allele $A$ in the population's gene pool is given as $p$.\nThe frequency of the wild-type allele $a$ is $q$.\nSince there are only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to $1$.\n$$p + q = 1$$\nTherefore, the frequency of the wild-type allele can be expressed in terms of $p$ as $q = 1 - p$.\n\nThe problem states to assume Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), which is achieved under conditions of random mating in a large population with no mutation, migration, or selection. Deriving the genotype frequencies from first principles involves considering the combinations of alleles from the gamete pool to form zygotes in the next generation.\n\nUnder random mating, the probability that a gamete (sperm or egg) carries a specific allele is equal to that allele's frequency in the population.\n- Probability of a gamete carrying allele $A$ is $p$.\n- Probability of a gamete carrying allele $a$ is $q$.\n\nThe formation of a diploid zygote involves the random union of one paternal and one maternal gamete. We can determine the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) by calculating the probabilities of these unions:\n\n1.  **Homozygous pathogenic ($AA$)**: The zygote receives an $A$ allele from the father (with probability $p$) AND an $A$ allele from the mother (with probability $p$). The frequency of this genotype is the product of these independent probabilities:\n    $$f(AA) = p \\times p = p^2$$\n\n2.  **Homozygous wild-type ($aa$)**: The zygote receives an $a$ allele from the father (with probability $q$) AND an $a$ allele from the mother (with probability $q$). The frequency of this genotype is:\n    $$f(aa) = q \\times q = q^2$$\n\n3.  **Heterozygous ($Aa$)**: A heterozygous individual carries one pathogenic allele ($A$) and one wild-type allele ($a$). This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    - The zygote receives an $A$ allele from the father (probability $p$) and an $a$ allele from the mother (probability $q$). The probability of this event is $p \\times q$.\n    - The zygote receives an $a$ allele from the father (probability $q$) and an $A$ allele from the mother (probability $p$). The probability of this event is $q \\times p$.\n\nThe total frequency of heterozygous carriers, $f(Aa)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$f(Aa) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the expected frequency of heterozygous carriers under HWE, derived from the first principles of Mendelian segregation and random mating. To express this solely as a function of $p$, we substitute $q = 1 - p$:\n$$f(Aa) = 2p(1 - p) = 2p - 2p^2$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given pathogenic allele frequency, $p = 0.01$.\n$$f(Aa) = 2 \\times 0.01 \\times (1 - 0.01)$$\n$$f(Aa) = 2 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.99$$\n$$f(Aa) = 0.02 \\times 0.99$$\n$$f(Aa) = 0.0198$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is $0.0198$, which has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$f(Aa) = 0.01980$$\n\n### Part 2: Effect of Directional Selection Against Heterozygotes\n\nNow, we consider the case where the HWE assumption of \"no selection\" is violated. Specifically, we examine directional selection against heterozygotes ($Aa$). This implies that heterozygous individuals have a lower reproductive fitness compared to wild-type homozygotes ($aa$).\n\nLet the relative fitness of the three genotypes be denoted by $w_{AA}$, $w_{Aa}$, and $w_{aa}$. We can set the fitness of the most fit genotype, the wild-type homozygote, to $1$.\n$$w_{aa} = 1$$\nSelection against heterozygotes means their fitness is reduced by a selection coefficient, $s_h > 0$.\n$$w_{Aa} = 1 - s_h$$\nThe fitness of the pathogenic homozygote ($AA$), $w_{AA}$, is typically less than or equal to that of the heterozygote. We can denote it as $w_{AA} = 1-s_d$, where $s_d \\ge s_h$. For many severe genetic disorders, $w_{AA}$ is close to $0$ (i.e., $s_d \\approx 1$).\n\nStarting with the HWE genotype frequencies in zygotes ($p^2$, $2pq$, $q^2$), selection acts before reproduction. The frequency of each genotype among the surviving, reproducing adults is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness.\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the weighted average of the genotype fitnesses:\n$$\\bar{w} = f(AA)w_{AA} + f(Aa)w_{Aa} + f(aa)w_{aa} = p^2w_{AA} + 2pqw_{Aa} + q^2w_{aa}$$\nThe frequencies of the genotypes in the surviving adult population are normalized by $\\bar{w}$:\n$$f'(AA) = \\frac{p^2w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}}, \\quad f'(Aa) = \\frac{2pqw_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}}, \\quad f'(aa) = \\frac{q^2w_{aa}}{\\bar{w}}$$\nThese surviving adults then mate randomly to produce the next generation. The allele frequency of $A$ in the gametes produced by this selected population, $p'$, is:\n$$p' = f'(AA) + \\frac{1}{2}f'(Aa) = \\frac{p^2w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{pqw_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(pw_{AA} + qw_{Aa})}{\\bar{w}}$$\nSince $w_{Aa} = 1-s_h < 1$ and $w_{AA} \\le w_{Aa}$, the term $(pw_{AA} + qw_{Aa})$ is less than $(p(1) + q(1)) = 1$. This causes the numerator to be smaller than $p$ relative to the denominator $\\bar{w}$. Consequently, the allele frequency of $A$ will decrease from one generation to the next, so $p' < p$.\n\nThe zygotes of the next generation will be formed in Hardy-Weinberg proportions based on these new allele frequencies, $p'$ and $q' = 1 - p'$. The frequency of heterozygous carriers in this new generation will be:\n$$f_{next}(Aa) = 2p'q'$$\nThe initial carrier frequency under HWE was $f_{initial}(Aa) = 2pq$.\nFor a rare pathogenic allele, its frequency $p$ is small (i.e., $p \\ll 0.5$). In the interval $[0, 0.5]$, the function $f(x) = 2x(1-x)$ is strictly increasing. Since selection against carriers (and pathogenic homozygotes) causes the allele frequency to decrease ($p' < p$), it follows that the frequency of heterozygotes in the next generation will also be lower than the initial HWE frequency:\n$$2p'q' < 2pq$$\nIn summary, directional selection against heterozygotes purges the pathogenic allele from the population, reducing its frequency ($p' < p$). This, in turn, leads to a lower frequency of heterozygous carriers in the subsequent generation than would be expected under the simple HWE model based on the initial allele frequency $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01980}$$", "id": "5044910"}, {"introduction": "An individual's genetic risk is not a fixed number; it evolves as we gather more information about their family and personal health.

The provided data are realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability that a $40$-year-old woman (the proband), who is currently unaffected by breast or ovarian cancer, is a carrier of a familial pathogenic variant in the BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2).\n\nLet's define the relevant hypotheses and evidence:\n$H_C$: The hypothesis that the proband is a carrier of the BRCA2 pathogenic variant.\n$H_{NC}$: The hypothesis that the proband is not a carrier of the BRCA2 pathogenic variant.\n$E$: The evidence that the proband is unaffected by breast or ovarian cancer at her current age of $40$.\n\nWe need to compute the posterior probability $P(H_C|E)$, which is the probability of the proband being a carrier given that she is unaffected at age $40$. We will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation.\n\nFirst, we establish the prior probabilities of the hypotheses, $P(H_C)$ and $P(H_{NC})$. The proband's mother is a known carrier of a BRCA2 pathogenic variant. Since BRCA2-associated cancer risk is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, there is a $50\\%$ chance for a child to inherit the variant from an affected parent. This is based on Mendelian segregation.\nTherefore, the prior probability that the proband is a carrier is:\n$$ P(H_C) = 0.5 $$\nThe prior probability that she is not a carrier is complementary:\n$$ P(H_{NC}) = 1 - P(H_C) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\n\nNext, we determine the conditional probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis. These are also known as the likelihoods, $P(E|H_C)$ and $P(E|H_{NC})$. The problem provides penetrance data, which is the cumulative risk of developing cancer by a certain age.\nLet $A_{40}$ be the event that a woman develops breast or ovarian cancer by age $40$. The problem gives:\nThe risk for a carrier by age $40$: $P(A_{40}|H_C) = 0.19$.\nThe risk for a non-carrier by age $40$: $P(A_{40}|H_{NC}) = 0.016$.\n\nThe evidence $E$ is that the proband is *unaffected*, which is the complement of the event $A_{40}$. Thus, the likelihoods are:\nThe probability of a carrier being unaffected at age $40$:\n$$ P(E|H_C) = P(\\text{not } A_{40}|H_C) = 1 - P(A_{40}|H_C) = 1 - 0.19 = 0.81 $$\nThe probability of a non-carrier being unaffected at age $40$:\n$$ P(E|H_{NC}) = P(\\text{not } A_{40}|H_{NC}) = 1 - P(A_{40}|H_{NC}) = 1 - 0.016 = 0.984 $$\n\nNow, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $P(H_C|E)$:\n$$ P(H_C|E) = \\frac{P(E|H_C) P(H_C)}{P(E)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of the evidence, which is calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(E) = P(E|H_C) P(H_C) + P(E|H_{NC}) P(H_{NC}) $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $P(E)$:\n$$ P(E) = (0.81)(0.5) + (0.984)(0.5) $$\n$$ P(E) = 0.405 + 0.492 = 0.897 $$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the Bayes' theorem formula for the posterior probability:\n$$ P(H_C|E) = \\frac{(0.81)(0.5)}{0.897} = \\frac{0.405}{0.897} $$\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$$ P(H_C|E) \\approx 0.4515050167... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(H_C|E) \\approx 0.4515 $$\nThe information about the maternal aunt and the penetrance data for age $70$ are not required for this specific calculation, which focuses on the proband's current risk at age $40$ given her mother's confirmed carrier status.
