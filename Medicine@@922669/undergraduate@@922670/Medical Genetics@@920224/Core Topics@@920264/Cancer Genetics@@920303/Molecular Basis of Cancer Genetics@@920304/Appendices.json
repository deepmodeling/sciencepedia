Let $x(t)$ represent the concentration of PIP3. We will first formulate a kinetic model based on the principles of mass-action kinetics to describe the dynamics of $x(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of PIP3, $\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$, is the difference between its rate of production and its rate of degradation.\n$$\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = V_{p} - V_{d}\n$$\nwhere $V_p$ is the rate of production of PIP3 and $V_d$ is the rate of its dephosphorylation (degradation).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the production of PIP3 is catalyzed by PI3K from PIP2. The rate is described by mass-action kinetics and is proportional to the product of the concentrations of PI3K and PIP2. The problem specifies that $[\\mathrm{PI}3\\mathrm{K}]$ and $[\\mathrm{PIP}2]$ are constant over the timescale of interest. Therefore, the production rate, $V_p$, is a constant. Let us denote this constant production rate as $R_p$.\n$$\nV_p = R_p = \\text{constant}\n$$\n\nThe dephosphorylation of PIP3 back to PIP2 is catalyzed by PTEN. The problem states this process also follows mass-action kinetics. In a reaction where an enzyme (PTEN) acts on a substrate (PIP3), the rate is proportional to the product of the enzyme and substrate concentrations. Thus, the rate of dephosphorylation, $V_d$, can be written as:\n$$\nV_d = k_{d} [\\mathrm{PTEN}] x(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_d$ is the second-order rate constant for the reaction catalyzed by PTEN, and $[\\mathrm{PTEN}]$ is the concentration of the PTEN enzyme.\n\nCombining these terms, we obtain the ordinary differential equation governing the concentration of PIP3:\n$$\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = R_p - k_{d} [\\mathrm{PTEN}] x(t)\n$$\n\nThe system is said to reach a steady state, where the concentration of PIP3 becomes time-invariant. We denote this steady-state concentration as $x^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the rate of change is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our differential equation yields:\n$$\n0 = R_p - k_{d} [\\mathrm{PTEN}] x^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe can solve for the steady-state concentration $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nk_{d} [\\mathrm{PTEN}] x^{\\ast} = R_p \\implies x^{\\ast} = \\frac{R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the steady-state concentration of PIP3 is inversely proportional to the concentration of the PTEN enzyme.\n\nNow, we apply this general result to the two specific conditions described in the problem: wild-type (WT) and PTEN haploinsufficient (haplo).\n\nFor the wild-type case, let the PTEN concentration be $[\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The corresponding steady-state PIP3 concentration, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, is:\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}}\n$$\n\nFor the haploinsufficient case, the functional PTEN concentration is reduced by one-half. Let this concentration be $[\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{haplo}}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{haplo}} = \\frac{1}{2} [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe problem states that all other quantities and rate constants, namely $R_p$ and $k_d$, remain unchanged. The new steady-state concentration, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}} = \\frac{R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{haplo}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{haplo}}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}} = \\frac{R_p}{k_d \\left(\\frac{1}{2} [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}\\right)} = \\frac{2 R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative effect (fold-change), which is the ratio $\\frac{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}}}{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$. We compute this ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}}}{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}}}{\\frac{R_p}{k_d [\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}}}\n$$\nThe terms $R_p$, $k_d$, and $[\\mathrm{PTEN}]_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ cancel out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{haplo}}}{x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = 2\n$$\nThus, halving the concentration of the PTEN enzyme leads to a doubling of the steady-state concentration of its substrate, PIP3.

[@problem_id:5061451]", "problem": "A single protein-coding gene $G$ is surveyed across a cohort of $T = 1000$ human tumors. Somatic mutations in $G$ arise through a context-dependent mutation process acting on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), such that each potential site-to-site change has a known per-tumor probability determined by its trinucleotide context. Assume synonymous changes are effectively neutral with respect to fitness, whereas nonsynonymous changes may be subject to selection. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) is used to quantify selection, with the neutral expectation near $1$.\n\nFor $G$, the coding sequence contains two dominant trinucleotide contexts, denoted $C_1$ and $C_2$. Across the codons of $G$, the number of potential synonymous changes available in context $C_1$ is $S_1 = 800$, and in context $C_2$ is $S_2 = 400$.

The ratio $\\omega = d_N / d_S$ is expected to be approximately $1$ under neutrality, greater than $1$ under positive selection, and less than $1$ under negative (purifying) selection.\n\nTo account for the fact that mutation rates depend on the local DNA sequence (trinucleotide context), we must first calculate the expected number of mutations under a neutral model that incorporates this heterogeneity.\n\n**1. Derivation of Expected Mutation Counts**\n\nThe number of mutations of a given type is modeled as a Poisson process. The expected number of events is the product of the total number of opportunities and the probability per opportunity. Here, an \"opportunity\" is a single nucleotide site in a single tumor.\n\nThe total number of opportunities for synonymous mutations is the sum of opportunities across both contexts, multiplied by the number of tumors, $T$. The expected number of synonymous mutations, $E[s]$, is the sum of the expected counts from each context:\n$$ E[s] = (S_1 \\times T \\times p_1) + (S_2 \\times T \\times p_2) = T(S_1 p_1 + S_2 p_2) $$\nHere, $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the numbers of potential synonymous sites in contexts $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the corresponding per-site per-tumor mutation probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, the expected number of nonsynonymous mutations under the null hypothesis of neutrality, $E[n]_{\\text{neutral}}$, is calculated using the same background mutation probabilities, but applied to the number of potential nonsynonymous sites, $N_1$ and $N_2$:\n$$ E[n]_{\\text{neutral}} = (N_1 \\times T \\times p_1) + (N_2 \\times T \\times p_2) = T(N_1 p_1 + N_2 p_2) $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$T = 1000$\n$S_1 = 800$, $S_2 = 400$\n$N_1 = 2200$, $N_2 = 1800$\n$p_1 = 2 \\times 10^{-6}$, $p_2 = 6 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe expected number of synonymous mutations is:\n$$ E[s] = 1000 \\left( (800)(2 \\times 10^{-6}) + (400)(6 \\times 10^{-6}) \\right) $$\n$$ E[s] = 1000 \\left( 1600 \\times 10^{-6} + 2400 \\times 10^{-6} \\right) = 1000 (4000 \\times 10^{-6}) = 4.0 $$\n\nThe expected number of nonsynonymous mutations under neutrality is:\n$$ E[n]_{\\text{neutral}} = 1000 \\left( (2200)(2 \\times 10^{-6}) + (1800)(6 \\times 10^{-6}) \\right) $$\n$$ E[n]_{\\text{neutral}} = 1000 \\left( 4400 \\times 10^{-6} + 10800 \\times 10^{-6} \\right) = 1000 (15200 \\times 10^{-6}) = 15.2 $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Context-Normalized dN/dS Estimator**\n\nThe dN/dS ratio, $\\omega$, is the ratio of the nonsynonymous mutation rate ($d_N$) to the synonymous mutation rate ($d_S$).

Interpretation of Selection**\n\nThe point estimate for the dN/dS ratio is $\\hat{\\omega} \\approx 1.58$. Since this value is greater than $1$, it suggests an excess of nonsynonymous mutations compared to the neutral expectation, which could be a signal of positive selection. However, to assess the statistical significance of this finding, we examine the $95\\%$ confidence interval, which is approximately $[0.71, 3.52]$. Because this interval contains the value of $1$ (the null hypothesis of neutrality), we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. Therefore, while there is a trend towards an excess of nonsynonymous mutations, the data do not provide statistically significant evidence of selection acting on gene $G$ in this tumor cohort.
