The final answer must be an analytic expression only (not an equation or inequality).", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe derivation of the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the age at tumor onset, $T$, proceeds from first principles.\n\nLet $T_i$ be the random variable representing the time at which the second-hit event occurs in the $i$-th retinal progenitor cell, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$. The problem states that for each cell, these events occur at a constant rate $\\lambda$. This describes a Poisson process, and the waiting time for the first event in such a process follows an exponential distribution. Therefore, for each cell $i$, the time $T_i$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nThe survival function for a single cell $i$, which is the probability that a second hit has *not* occurred by time $t$, is given by:\n$$ S_{T_i}(t) = P(T_i > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nConsequently, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a single cell, which is the probability that a second hit *has* occurred by time $t$, is:\n$$ F_{T_i}(t) = P(T_i \\le t) = 1 - S_{T_i}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\nThe age at tumor onset, $T$, is defined as the time of the *first* second-hit event in *any* of the $N$ susceptible cells. Mathematically, this corresponds to the minimum of the individual event times:\n$$ T = \\min\\{T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_N\\} $$\n\nTo find the distribution of $T$, we first derive its survival function, $S_T(t) = P(T > t)$. The event $\\{T > t\\}$ is equivalent to the event that the minimum of all $T_i$ is greater than $t$. This only occurs if *all* individual event times $T_i$ are greater than $t$:\n$$ P(T > t) = P(\\min\\{T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_N\\} > t) = P(T_1 > t \\text{ and } T_2 > t \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } T_N > t) $$\nThe problem states that the second-hit events are independent across the $N$ cells. Therefore, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ S_T(t) = P(T > t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(T_i > t) $$\nSince all $T_i$ are identically distributed, $P(T_i > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for all $i$. Substituting this into the product gives:\n$$ S_T(t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp(-\\lambda t) = (\\exp(-\\lambda t))^N = \\exp(-N\\lambda t) $$\nThis shows that $T$, the time to the first event in the system of $N$ cells, is also exponentially distributed, but with a total rate of $N\\lambda$.\n\nThe unconditional CDF of $T$ is therefore:\n$$ F_T(t) = P(T \\le t) = 1 - S_T(t) = 1 - \\exp(-N\\lambda t) $$\nThis function gives the probability of a tumor forming by age $t$, assuming the process can continue indefinitely.\n\nThe problem, however, specifies a developmental window $[0, T_d]$ and asks for the *conditional* CDF, $F_{T}(t \\mid T \\le T_d)$, for times $t$ within this window, i.e., for $0 \\le t \\le T_d$. This is the probability of tumor onset by time $t$, given that onset occurs at some point within the developmental window.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, we set event $A = \\{T \\le t\\}$ and event $B = \\{T \\le T_d\\}$. The conditional CDF is:\n$$ F_{T}(t \\mid T \\le T_d) = P(T \\le t \\mid T \\le T_d) = \\frac{P(\\{T \\le t\\} \\cap \\{T \\le T_d\\})}{P(T \\le T_d)} $$\nSince the expression is sought for $t$ in the interval $0 \\le t \\le T_d$, the event $\\{T \\le t\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{T \\le T_d\\}$. If $T \\le t$ is true, then $T \\le T_d$ must also be true.

The p53 protein, often called the \"guardian of the genome,\" provides a classic case of a dominant-negative effect, where one mutant subunit can disable an entire protein complex. This practice explores the biochemical basis for this phenomenon, using probability to quantify how a single mutant allele can dramatically cripple the cell's tumor-suppressing capacity. [@problem_id:5088822]", "problem": "A tumor suppressor gene such as Tumor Protein p53 (*TP53*) encodes the p53 protein, which must form a tetramer to bind DNA and activate transcription of target genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In the classical two-hit model for tumor suppressors, complete loss of function typically requires inactivation of both alleles. However, p53 is known to assemble into a tetramer, and certain missense alleles produce subunits that can incorporate into tetramers but render any tetramer they join nonfunctional (a dominant-negative effect).\n\nConsider a heterozygous cell carrying one wild-type *TP53* allele and one dominant-negative missense *TP53* allele. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- By the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, both alleles are transcribed and translated into p53 monomers and, under a given stimulus, total p53 monomer abundance increases without changing the relative contribution of the two alleles.\n- Random tetramer assembly occurs from a well-mixed, large pool of monomers so that the identity of each subunit in a tetramer can be treated as an independent random draw from the pool.\n- A tetramer is functional only if all four subunits are wild-type; any tetramer that contains at least one mutant subunit is nonfunctional due to the dominant-negative effect.\n- Let the fraction of monomers contributed by the wild-type allele be $p$ and by the mutant allele be $1-p$. In a heterozygous cell with equal expression from both alleles, take $p=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Transcriptional output of p53 target genes under the stimulus is proportional to the fraction of functional tetramers, and the wild-type homozygous cell’s output under the same stimulus is normalized to $1$.\n\nUsing these assumptions and first principles of probability for independent draws, derive the fraction of functional tetramers that assemble in the heterozygous cell and use it to predict the normalized transcriptional output. Provide the final answer as a single real number. No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular biology and genetics, specifically concerning the function of tumor suppressor genes like *TP53*, the concept of dominant-negative mutations, and protein oligomerization. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear set of assumptions and definitions that are internally consistent and sufficient to derive a unique, meaningful solution using fundamental principles of probability theory. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe problem asks for the normalized transcriptional output of target genes in a heterozygous cell, which is proportional to the fraction of functional p53 tetramers. We will solve this by determining the probability that a randomly assembled tetramer is functional.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of p53 monomers that are wild-type (WT) and $1-p$ be the fraction that are mutant (M). According to the problem statement, in a heterozygous cell with equal expression from both alleles, we have $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means that the probability of randomly selecting a WT monomer from the cellular pool is $P(W) = p = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of selecting a mutant monomer is $P(M) = 1-p = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nA p53 tetramer is composed of $4$ subunits. The problem states that the assembly involves independent random draws from a large, well-mixed pool of monomers. This allows us to model the composition of a single tetramer as a sequence of $4$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial is the selection of one subunit.\n\nThe condition for a tetramer to be functional is that all $4$ of its subunits must be of the WT type. Let $F$ denote the event that a tetramer is functional. This event occurs if and only if the first subunit is WT, AND the second subunit is WT, AND the third subunit is WT, AND the fourth subunit is WT.\n\nBecause the selections are independent events, the probability of their conjunction is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of a single subunit being WT is $p$. Therefore, the probability that all $4$ subunits are WT is:\n$$P(F) = P(W_1 \\cap W_2 \\cap W_3 \\cap W_4) = P(W_1) \\times P(W_2) \\times P(W_3) \\times P(W_4)$$\n$$P(F) = p \\times p \\times p \\times p = p^4$$\nThis probability, $P(F)$, represents the fraction of all assembled tetramers that are functional.\n\nFor the specific case of the heterozygous cell described, $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value into our derived formula gives the fraction of functional tetramers:\n$$P(F) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1^4}{2^4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThe problem states that the transcriptional output is proportional to the fraction of functional tetramers. Let $O$ be the transcriptional output and $f_{func}$ be the fraction of functional tetramers. We can write this relationship as $O = k \\cdot f_{func}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo determine $k$, we use the provided normalization condition: a wild-type homozygous cell has a normalized transcriptional output of $1$. In a wild-type homozygous cell, both alleles are WT, so all monomers produced are WT. Thus, for such a cell, $p=1$. The fraction of functional tetramers is:\n$$f_{func, WT} = (1)^4 = 1$$\nThe transcriptional output for this cell is given as $O_{WT} = 1$. Using our proportionality relationship:\n$$O_{WT} = k \\cdot f_{func, WT}$$\n$$1 = k \\cdot 1$$\nThis implies that the constant of proportionality is $k=1$. Therefore, the normalized transcriptional output is numerically equal to the fraction of functional tetramers.\n\nFinally, for the heterozygous cell where we calculated the fraction of functional tetramers to be $\\frac{1}{16}$, the normalized transcriptional output is:\n$$O_{het} = 1 \\cdot P(F) = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThis result demonstrates the potent effect of a dominant-negative mutation. Even with one fully functional wild-type allele, the cell's functional p53 capacity is reduced not by half, but to only $\\frac{1}{16}$ of the wild-type level (a reduction of $93.75\\%$), explaining why such mutations can severely compromise tumor suppressor function and often do not follow the classical two-hit model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "5088822"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to clinical reality requires tools to measure genetic events within a patient's tumor.

The subclonal tumor cells that have not undergone deletion contribute 2 alleles each, instead of 1. The total allele count would be derived from three populations: normal cells (2 alleles/cell), clonal tumor cells with deletion (1 allele/cell), and subclonal tumor cells without deletion (2 alleles/cell).\n- A higher total allele count in the denominator for the same number of variant alleles in the numerator necessarily leads to a lower VAF.
