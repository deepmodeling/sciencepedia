The *TP53* gene, the p.R337H mutation, and its association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome are well-established facts in medical genetics. The specified carrier prevalence of $0.3\\%$ is consistent with observed frequencies for this founder mutation in certain populations (e.g., Southern Brazil), making the premise factually sound and realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (prevalence, cohort size) and clearly defines the random variables and the objective (to derive the expected number of carriers). The request to derive the result from first principles provides a clear constraint on the method.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and directly formalizable as a standard probability theory exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet $p$ be the carrier prevalence of the p.R337H variant in the population. The problem states this prevalence is $0.3\\%$. We convert this to a decimal for calculation:\n$$p = 0.3\\% = \\frac{0.3}{100} = 0.003$$\nThe size of the cohort is given as $N = 100{,}000$.\n\nFor each individual $i$ in the cohort (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$), we define a random variable $X_i$ as specified:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if individual } i \\text{ is a carrier} \\\\\n0  \\text{if individual } i \\text{ is not a carrier}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince each individual is sampled independently from the population, each $X_i$ is an independent Bernoulli random variable. The probability of \"success\" (the individual being a carrier) is the prevalence $p$. The probability mass function (PMF) for each $X_i$ is:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$$\n\nThe expected value of a discrete random variable is the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability. From this fundamental definition, we can find the expected value of a single indicator variable, $E[X_i]$:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0))$$\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p$$\nSo, the expected value for any single individual being a carrier is simply the prevalence $p$.\n\nLet $N_c$ be the total number of carriers in the cohort of $N$ individuals. This total number is the sum of the individual indicator variables:\n$$N_c = X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nWe are asked to find the expected number of carriers, which is the expected value of $N_c$, denoted as $E[N_c]$.\n$$E[N_c] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right]$$\n\nA fundamental principle of probability is the linearity of expectation, which states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nWe have already established that $E[X_i] = p$ for every individual $i$. Substituting this into the sum:\n$$E[N_c] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p$$\nThis is the sum of a constant, $p$, added to itself $N$ times. Therefore, the sum is equal to the product of $N$ and $p$.\n$$E[N_c] = N \\cdot p$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula.\n$$N = 100{,}000$$\n$$p = 0.003$$\n$$E[N_c] = 100{,}000 \\times 0.003$$\n$$E[N_c] = 100{,}000 \\times \\frac{3}{1000} = 100 \\times 3 = 300$$\n\nThe expected number of carriers in the cohort is $300$.

This practice models the random assembly of p53 subunits to quantify the dramatic loss of functional tetramers, illustrating why these mutations have such a profound impact on cellular function [@problem_id:5052365].", "problem": "Inherited variants in Tumor Protein p53 (TP53) underlie Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a cancer predisposition disorder in which the p53 transcription factor functions as a tetramer composed of $4$ identical subunits. The Central Dogma of molecular biology (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to protein) implies that a heterozygous loss-of-function *TP53* allele produces a pool of mutant p53 monomers alongside wild-type monomers. Empirical observations establish that p53 tetramer function requires integrity of its subunits: a single mutant subunit within a tetramer exerts a dominant-negative (DN) effect, rendering that tetramer nonfunctional.\n\nConsider a large cell population in which the fraction of p53 monomers that are mutant is $p$, with $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$.

It provides a self-contained and consistent framework for a probabilistic analysis of protein complex formation based on established principles of molecular biology and genetics, specifically concerning dominant-negative mutations in oligomeric proteins like p53. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction of fully functional p53 tetramers, denoted as $F(p)$, in a large cell population where the fraction of mutant p53 monomers is $p$.\n\nFirst, we define the probabilities of selecting a single monomer of each type from the large cellular pool.\nLet $M$ be the event that a randomly selected monomer is mutant.\nLet $W$ be the event that a randomly selected monomer is wild-type.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the fraction of mutant monomers is $p$. As the pool consists only of mutant and wild-type monomers, the probabilities of these events are:\n$P(M) = p$\n$P(W) = 1 - p$\nThe condition $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$ ensures that these are valid probabilities.\n\nA p53 transcription factor is a tetramer, meaning it is composed of $4$ subunits. The problem states that tetramers assemble randomly and the composition of each can be modeled by independently drawing $4$ subunits from the monomer pool. The assumption of a \"large pool\" implies that the probability of drawing a mutant or wild-type monomer remains constant for each of the $4$ draws; this is analogous to sampling with replacement.\n\nThe condition for a tetramer to be functional is that it must be composed entirely of wild-type subunits. A single mutant subunit is sufficient to render the entire tetramer nonfunctional, a phenomenon known as a dominant-negative effect.\n\nTherefore, to form a functional tetramer, all $4$ independent draws must result in a wild-type monomer. Let the four draws be represented by the events $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. A functional tetramer corresponds to the compound event where $S_1=W$, $S_2=W$, $S_3=W$, and $S_4=W$.\n\nThe probability of this compound event, which we will call $P_{\\text{functional}}$, is the joint probability of these four individual events occurring:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = P(S_1=W \\cap S_2=W \\cap S_3=W \\cap S_4=W)$$\nBecause the draws are independent events, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = P(S_1=W) \\times P(S_2=W) \\times P(S_3=W) \\times P(S_4=W)$$\nSubstituting the probability of drawing a single wild-type monomer, $P(W) = 1 - p$:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times (1 - p)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$P_{\\text{functional}} = (1 - p)^{4}$$\nThis expression gives the probability that any single tetramer, formed by random assembly, will be functional.\n\nBy the law of large numbers, for a large population of such tetramers, the expected fraction of fully functional tetramers, $F(p)$, will be equal to this probability.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the expected fraction of fully functional p53 tetramers is:\n$$F(p) = (1 - p)^{4}$$\nThis is a simplified analytic expression in terms of $p$, as required. For a heterozygous individual where transcription and translation from both alleles are equal, one might approximate $p=0.5$. In this specific case, the fraction of functional tetramers would be $(1 - 0.5)^4 = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625$, or $6.25\\%$, illustrating the potent effect of the dominant-negative mutation.
