The experimental model is a human epithelial cell line that has been genetically engineered to have a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the *TP53* gene. The *TP53* gene normally encodes the p53 protein, a critical tumor suppressor. This p53 protein acts as a transcription factor that, in response to DNA damage, activates the expression of genes like *CDKN1A*, which encodes the p21 protein. The p21 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks the G1/S transition.\n\nThe scientist exposes a culture of these *TP53*-deficient cells to a moderate dose of gamma radiation, which is known to cause significant double-strand breaks in the DNA. Based on the function of the p53 pathway, what is the most likely immediate fate of a typical cell from this culture as it progresses through the cell cycle?\n\nA. The cell will successfully arrest at the G1/S checkpoint, as alternative DNA damage response pathways will compensate for the absence of functional p53.\n\nB.

The cell will enter a permanent state of non-division known as senescence as soon as the DNA damage occurs.", "solution": "The relevant DNA damage response for the G1/S checkpoint in human epithelial cells is the p53-p21-RB pathway. Upon double-strand DNA breaks (as caused by gamma radiation), ATM/ATR signaling normally stabilizes and activates p53. Activated p53 acts as a transcription factor to induce *CDKN1A*, which encodes p21. The p21 protein inhibits G1/S cyclin-dependent kinases, especially CDK2 bound to cyclin E and cyclin A. Inhibition of these CDKs maintains RB in its hypophosphorylated state, preventing E2F-mediated transcription necessary for S-phase entry; thus cells arrest at the G1/S checkpoint.\n\nIn the engineered cells described, there is homozygous loss-of-function in *TP53*, so functional p53 protein is absent or nonfunctional. Consequently, DNA damage cannot induce *CDKN1A* transcription via p53, and p21 levels do not rise appropriately. Without p21-mediated inhibition, CDK2-cyclin E/A activity persists, RB becomes phosphorylated, E2F remains active, and the G1/S checkpoint fails. Therefore, despite DNA damage, the typical cell will proceed from G1 into S phase and attempt to replicate damaged DNA.\n\nConsidering the alternatives:\n- Option A is incorrect because the principal G1/S DNA damage checkpoint depends on p53-driven p21 induction; p53-independent compensation at G1 is generally insufficient in *TP53*-null cells.\n- Option C is less accurate as an immediate fate; while p53-independent mechanisms (ATR/CHK1 inhibiting CDC25 and promoting Wee1 activity) can enforce G2/M or intra-S checkpoints, the defining early defect in *TP53*-null cells is failure of the G1/S arrest, leading them into S phase first.\n- Option D is unlikely because p53 is a key mediator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis; its absence reduces the likelihood of immediate apoptosis in response to radiation.\n- Option E is unlikely because p53 is also a central driver of senescence; immediate senescence upon damage typically requires intact p53 or robust p16INK4a-pRB signaling, which is not specified here and is not the immediate response.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate fate is failure to arrest at G1/S and entry into S phase with damaged DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533367"}, {"introduction": "Many tumor suppressor genes are inactivated when both copies are lost, but p53 often behaves differently.

Dominant-negative mutations are a clinically and experimentally established mechanism for loss of p53 function in heterozygous individuals, contributing to cancer predisposition syndromes like Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

This allows for the derivation of a unique and meaningful analytical solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language. It is free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe assembly of a p53 tetramer involves the selection of $4$ monomeric subunits from a large intracellular pool. The problem states that this process is one of random independent sampling. We are given two types of monomers in the pool: mutant and wild-type.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of mutant p53 monomers in the pool.\nSince the pool consists only of mutant and wild-type monomers, the fraction of wild-type (WT) monomers must be $1-p$.\n\nThe problem defines a functional tetramer as one composed exclusively of $4$ wild-type subunits. A tetramer is nonfunctional if it contains at least $1$ mutant subunit. We are asked to find the expected fraction of functional tetramers. Under the assumption of random assembly from a large pool, this expected fraction is equivalent to the probability that any single tetramer formed is functional.\n\nThe formation of a tetramer can be modeled as a sequence of $4$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial is the selection of a single monomer.\nLet's define the event of selecting a wild-type monomer as a \"success\".\nThe probability of success in a single trial is the probability of selecting a wild-type monomer, which is $P(\\text{WT}) = 1-p$.\nThe probability of \"failure\" in a single trial is the probability of selecting a mutant monomer, which is $P(\\text{mutant}) = p$.\n\nFor a tetramer to be functional, all $4$ selections must be wild-type monomers. Since the selections are independent events, the probability of this compound event is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.\n\nLet $F$ denote the event that a tetramer is functional.\n$F$ occurs if and only if the first subunit is WT, AND the second subunit is WT, AND the third subunit is WT, AND the fourth subunit is WT.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(F) = P(\\text{1st is WT}) \\times P(\\text{2nd is WT}) \\times P(\\text{3rd is WT}) \\times P(\\text{4th is WT})$$\n\nSubstituting the probability for each independent event:\n$$P(F) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p)$$\n$$P(F) = (1-p)^4$$\n\nAlternatively, this can be framed using the binomial probability distribution. The number of wild-type subunits, $k$, in a tetramer of size $n=4$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ and success probability $P(\\text{WT})=1-p$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ wild-type subunits is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} (1-p)^k p^{n-k}$$\n\nFor a tetramer to be functional, we require exactly $k=4$ wild-type subunits.\n$$P(\\text{functional}) = P(X=4) = \\binom{4}{4} (1-p)^4 p^{4-4}$$\nWe evaluate the terms:\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{4} = \\frac{4!}{4! (4-4)!} = \\frac{4!}{4! 0!} = 1$, since $0! = 1$.\nThe term $p^{4-4} = p^0 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\n$$P(\\text{functional}) = 1 \\times (1-p)^4 \\times 1 = (1-p)^4$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The expected fraction of functional tetramers is the probability of forming a functional tetramer, which is an analytic function of the mutant monomer fraction $p$.\nThe final expression is $(1-p)^4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1-p)^4}$$", "id": "5069086"}, {"introduction": "The inactivation of tumor suppressors often follows a \"two-hit\" model, where both alleles of the gene are lost. This advanced practice challenges you to act as a cancer genomicist, integrating multiple types of sequencing data to uncover this process in action. By analyzing copy number, allele frequencies, and variant fractions from a tumor sample, you will learn to infer the occurrence of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [@problem_id:5069093], a sophisticated mechanism that provides the \"second hit\" to achieve biallelic inactivation of TP53.", "problem": "A tissue sample from a patient with carcinoma is subjected to bulk whole-exome sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis focused on the tumor protein p53 gene (*TP53*). The tumor cell fraction (tumor purity) is estimated to be $p = 0.70$. Segmentation of the *TP53* locus shows a total tumor copy number of $2$ with allele-specific imbalance: the major allele copy number is $2$ and the minor allele copy number is $0$ in the tumor cells. Across germline heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the *TP53* region, the B-allele frequency (BAF; the fraction of reads supporting one predefined allele at a germline heterozygous site) is strongly skewed toward $0.90$ and $0.10$ rather than $0.50$. In the exome data, a truncating somatic *TP53* variant is detected with a variant allele fraction (VAF; the fraction of sequencing reads bearing the somatic variant) of $0.70$.\n\nUsing core definitions from classical genetics and cancer biology—heterozygosity versus homozygosity at a locus, loss of heterozygosity (LOH; the state in which one allele at a previously heterozygous locus is lost in tumor cells), copy number variation (CNV), and the Knudson $2$-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressor genes—reason from first principles to determine how LOH at the *TP53* locus can be inferred from copy number and allele-specific data and how this relates to biallelic inactivation of *TP53*. In your reasoning, consider the expected VAF under different allele configurations given a mixed tumor-normal sample and the provided purity $p$.\n\nWhich option best explains the observations and correctly links them to biallelic inactivation status?\n\nA. The data are most consistent with copy-neutral LOH at *TP53*, in which the wild-type allele is lost in the tumor cells and the mutant allele is duplicated to two copies; the observed VAF equal to $p$ reflects that both tumor copies carry the mutant, indicating biallelic inactivation of *TP53* in tumor cells.\n\nB. The data indicate a simple heterozygous *TP53* mutation without LOH; the expected VAF for a clonal heterozygous mutation in a sample with purity $p = 0.70$ is $p/2 = 0.35$, matching the observed VAF of $0.70$, so biallelic inactivation has not occurred.\n\nC. The data indicate a hemizygous deletion of *TP53* removing the mutant allele and leaving the wild-type allele; the high VAF of $0.70$ is explained by stromal contamination, so *TP53* remains functionally monoallelic and not biallelically inactivated.\n\nD. The data indicate whole-genome doubling at *TP53* with retention of both alleles and a subclonal *TP53* mutation; the expected VAF would be approximately $0.35$, and the allele-specific imbalance is an artifact, so biallelic inactivation cannot be inferred.", "solution": "The problem requires a rigorous, step-by-step interpretation of genomic data from a tumor sample to deduce the genetic state of the *TP53* gene. The analysis must integrate information from tumor purity, copy number analysis, allele-specific frequencies, and somatic variant allele fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\nThe problem statement provides a set of quantitative data and asks for an interpretation based on established principles of cancer genetics.\n\n**1.1. Extracted Givens:**\n- Subject: A tissue sample from a patient with carcinoma.\n- Analyses: Bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.\n- Tumor purity (tumor cell fraction): $p = 0.70$.\n- *TP53* locus copy number state in tumor cells (from SNP array segmentation):\n    - Total tumor copy number: $C_T = 2$.\n    - Major allele copy number: $C_{T,maj} = 2$.\n    - Minor allele copy number: $C_{T,min} = 0$.\n- B-allele frequency (BAF) at germline heterozygous SNPs in the *TP53* region: Skewed toward $0.90$ and $0.10$.\n- Somatic variant in *TP53* (from WES):\n    - Type: Truncating.\n    - Variant Allele Fraction (VAF): $VAF_{obs} = 0.70$.\n\n**1.2. Validation against Criteria:**\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly based on standard concepts and techniques in cancer genomics, including tumor purity, copy number variation (CNV), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), B-allele frequency (BAF), variant allele fraction (VAF), and the Knudson $2$-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressors like *TP53*. All concepts are standard and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness & Consistency:** The problem is to determine the state of *TP53* by synthesizing the provided data. Let us verify the consistency of the numerical data.\n    - The sample is a mixture of tumor cells (fraction $p = 0.70$) and normal cells (fraction $1-p = 0.30$). Normal cells are assumed to be diploid with a copy number $C_N = 2$.\n    - The tumor cell copy number data ($C_T = 2$, $C_{T,maj}=2$, $C_{T,min}=0$) defines a state of **copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH)**. In this state, a locus that was heterozygous in the germline (e.g., genotype A/B) becomes homozygous in the tumor (e.g., A/A or B/B) by losing one allele and duplicating the other, while maintaining a total copy number of $2$.\n    - Let's calculate the expected BAF based on this cnLOH model. At a germline heterozygous site, normal cells are A/B.\n        - The number of alleles of a specific type (e.g., B) in the mixed sample is proportional to the weighted sum from normal and tumor cells. The denominator for BAF is the total number of alleles.\n        - Expected BAF = $\\frac{p \\cdot C_{T,B} + (1-p) \\cdot C_{N,B}}{p \\cdot C_T + (1-p) \\cdot C_N}$.\n        - In normal cells at a heterozygous locus, $C_{N,B} = 1$ and $C_N = 2$.\n        - In tumor cells with cnLOH, there are two possibilities:\n            1. The B allele is lost: $C_{T,B}=0$. BAF = $\\frac{p \\cdot 0 + (1-p) \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1-p}{2} = \\frac{1-0.70}{2} = 0.15$.\n            2. The A allele is lost and the B allele is duplicated: $C_{T,B}=2$. BAF = $\\frac{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1+p}{2} = \\frac{1+0.70}{2} = 0.85$.\n        - The problem states the BAF is skewed to $0.10$ and $0.90$. These values are very close to the theoretical values of $0.15$ and $0.85$. Such minor discrepancies are common in real data due to imperfections in purity estimation or other technical factors. The strong BAF skew is fully consistent with the cnLOH indicated by the copy number segmentation.\n    - Now, let's analyze the VAF of the somatic mutation. The expected VAF for a somatic variant is calculated as:\n        - Expected VAF = $\\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{p \\cdot m_T}{p \\cdot C_T + (1-p) \\cdot C_N}$, where $m_T$ is the number of mutant alleles per tumor cell.\n        - Using the given data: $p=0.70$, $C_T=2$, $C_N=2$.\n        - Expected VAF = $\\frac{0.70 \\cdot m_T}{0.70 \\cdot 2 + (1-0.70) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot m_T}{1.4 + 0.6} = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot m_T}{2.0} = 0.35 \\cdot m_T$.\n        - The problem states the observed VAF is $0.70$. We can solve for $m_T$: $0.70 = 0.35 \\cdot m_T \\implies m_T = 2$.\n    - This calculation implies that there are $2$ mutant *TP53* alleles in each tumor cell. Since the total *TP53* copy number in the tumor is $2$, this means the tumor cells are homozygous for the truncating mutation.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. The provided data points converge on a single, coherent genetic scenario. The problem is **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Correct Answer and Option Analysis\n\nThe data collectively point to a two-hit inactivation mechanism for the *TP53* tumor suppressor gene, consistent with the Knudson hypothesis.\n\n1.  **First Hit:** A truncating somatic mutation occurred on one of the two alleles of *TP53* in a progenitor cell. This rendered one copy non-functional, leaving the cell heterozygous for the mutation (mutant/wild-type).\n2.  **Second Hit:** A subsequent event of copy-neutral LOH occurred. The chromosome arm containing the remaining wild-type *TP53* allele was lost, and the arm containing the mutant *TP53* allele was duplicated.\n3.  **Resulting Tumor State:** The tumor cells are now homozygous for the truncating mutation (mutant/mutant). This constitutes **biallelic inactivation** of *TP53*.\n\nThis scenario perfectly explains all observations:\n- **Total Tumor CN = $2$, Major CN = $2$, Minor CN = $0$**: This is the direct definition of the cnLOH event.\n- **BAF skewed to $\\sim 0.1/0.9$**: This is the expected signature of cnLOH in a sample with high tumor purity.\n- **VAF = $0.70$**: As derived above, a VAF of $0.70$ in a sample with $p=0.70$ purity and copy number of $2$ in both tumor and normal compartments indicates that the mutation is present on both alleles within the tumor cells ($m_T = 2$). The theoretical VAF for this scenario is precisely VAF = $p = 0.70$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. The data are most consistent with copy-neutral LOH at *TP53*, in which the wild-type allele is lost in the tumor cells and the mutant allele is duplicated to two copies; the observed VAF equal to $p$ reflects that both tumor copies carry the mutant, indicating biallelic inactivation of *TP53* in tumor cells.**\n- This option correctly identifies copy-neutral LOH, which is directly supported by the tumor copy number data ($C_T=2$, $C_{T,maj}=2$, $C_{T,min}=0$) and the BAF skew.\n- It correctly describes the mechanism linking a somatic mutation with LOH to achieve homozygosity for the mutation.\n- It correctly relates the observed VAF ($0.70$) to the purity ($p=0.70$), noting that VAF=$p$ is the signature of a homozygous clonal mutation in a copy-neutral region.\n- It correctly concludes that this state represents biallelic inactivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The data indicate a simple heterozygous *TP53* mutation without LOH; the expected VAF for a clonal heterozygous mutation in a sample with purity $p = 0.70$ is $p/2 = 0.35$, matching the observed VAF of 0.70, so biallelic inactivation has not occurred.**\n- The premise of \"without LOH\" is contradicted by the allele-specific copy number data and the skewed BAF.\n- The calculation of the expected VAF for a heterozygous mutation ($VAF = p/2 = 0.35$) is correct. However, the claim that this value \"matches\" the observed VAF of $0.70$ is factually incorrect. The observed VAF is exactly double the expected VAF for this scenario.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The data indicate a hemizygous deletion of *TP53* removing the mutant allele and leaving the wild-type allele; the high VAF of 0.70 is explained by stromal contamination, so *TP53* remains functionally monoallelic and not biallelically inactivated.**\n- \"Hemizygous deletion\" implies a total tumor copy number of $1$, which contradicts the given data ($C_T=2$).\n- \"Removing the mutant allele\" would result in a VAF of $0$, which contradicts the observed VAF of $0.70$.\n- The explanation that \"high VAF... is explained by stromal contamination\" is nonsensical; stromal (normal cell) contamination dilutes the VAF, it does not increase it.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data indicate whole-genome doubling at *TP53* with retention of both alleles and a subclonal *TP53* mutation; the expected VAF would be approximately 0.35, and the allele-specific imbalance is an artifact, so biallelic inactivation cannot be inferred.**\n- \"Whole-genome doubling at *TP53*\" implies a total tumor copy number of $4$, which contradicts the given data ($C_T=2$).\n- \"Retention of both alleles\" contradicts the minor allele copy number of $0$ and the skewed BAF.\n- A \"subclonal\" mutation would, by definition, have a VAF *lower* than a clonal one. The observed VAF of $0.70$ is very high, suggesting a clonal and homozygous event, the opposite of subclonal.\n- Dismissing the allele-specific imbalance data as an \"artifact\" is an unscientific rejection of clear evidence.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5069093"}]}
