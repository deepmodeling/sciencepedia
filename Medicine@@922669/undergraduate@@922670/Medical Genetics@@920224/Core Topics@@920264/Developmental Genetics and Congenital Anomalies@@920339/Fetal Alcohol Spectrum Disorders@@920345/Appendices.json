The analysis is theoretically sound, and the parameters are reasonable for a population genetics problem.

This principle states that in a large, randomly mating population free from evolutionary influences, both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation.\n\nThe alleles for the *ALDH2* gene are *A* (normal) and *a* (impaired). The frequency of allele *a* is given as $p$, and the frequency of allele *A* is given as $q$. According to the problem statement, $p = 0.3$ and $q = 1 - p$. Therefore, $q = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$. The sum of allele frequencies for a single locus must be unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nUnder the assumption of random mating, the frequencies of the genotypes (*AA*, *Aa*, and *aa*) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(q+p)^2$.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive these genotype frequencies in terms of $p$ and $q$.\n- The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, *AA*, is the probability of inheriting two *A* alleles, which is $q \\times q$.\n$$\\text{Frequency}(AA) = q^2$$\n- The frequency of the heterozygous genotype, *Aa*, results from inheriting an *A* allele from one parent and an *a* allele from the other. This can occur in two ways (*A* from mother, *a* from father; or *a* from mother, *A* from father). Its frequency is $2 \\times q \\times p$.\n$$\\text{Frequency}(Aa) = 2pq$$\n- The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, *aa*, is the probability of inheriting two *a* alleles, which is $p \\times p$.\n$$\\text{Frequency}(aa) = p^2$$\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies is $q^2 + 2pq + p^2 = (q+p)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, which accounts for the entire population.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the proportion of fetuses at risk for acetaldehyde accumulation. The problem specifies that risk is associated only with the recessive genotype *aa*. Therefore, the proportion of at-risk fetuses is equivalent to the frequency of the *aa* genotype in the population.\n$$\\text{Proportion at risk} = \\text{Frequency}(aa) = p^2$$\n\nUsing the given value for the frequency of the impaired allele, $p = 0.3$, we can calculate this proportion:\n$$\\text{Proportion at risk} = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$$\n\nThe final result, expressed as a decimal fraction, is $0.09$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09}$$", "id": "5030970"}, {"introduction": "The effects of teratogens like ethanol are critically dependent on the timing of exposure during fetal development. This practice [@problem_id:5030972] delves into this principle by modeling the \"critical window\" for craniofacial morphogenesis with a time-dependent sensitivity function. You will use this model to quantify how a specific profile of alcohol exposure translates into a measurable developmental outcome—the palpebral fissure length—providing insight into why the timing of exposure is as important as the dose.", "problem": "In Medical Genetics, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are understood through fundamental embryological principles: craniofacial structures have defined developmental windows, teratogenic effects scale with dose and timing, and standardized anthropometric measures (for example, palpebral fissure length) are compared to normative distributions using the $z$-score definition $z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Consider a mechanistic model in which ethanol exposure during gestation perturbs facial morphogenesis via timing-dependent sensitivity. Let gestational time $t$ be measured in weeks. Assume the palpebral fissure length response to ethanol is proportional to the cumulative sensitivity-weighted exposure over the facial morphogenesis window, modeled by a Gaussian timing kernel. Specifically, suppose the instantaneous reduction in expected palpebral fissure length, $\\mathrm{d}L$, at time $t$ scales as $\\mathrm{d}L = - r \\, u(t) \\, s(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t$, where $u(t)$ is a standardized, unitless exposure intensity and $s(t)$ is a timing sensitivity function. Let the timing sensitivity function be $s(t) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(t - 7)^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ with $\\sigma = 1$, which centers sensitivity near $t = 7$. Assume a standardized weekly exposure profile across gestational weeks $t \\in \\{4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\\}$ given by $u(4) = 0.2$, $u(5) = 0.4$, $u(6) = 0.7$, $u(7) = 1.0$, $u(8) = 0.6$, $u(9) = 0.3$, $u(10) = 0.1$, $u(11) = 0.0$, and $u(12) = 0.0$. Use a Riemann sum with $\\Delta t = 1$ week, treating $u(t)$ and $s(t)$ as constant within each integer week.

Express the final $z$-score as a unitless decimal.", "solution": "The problem presents a quantitative model for the teratogenic effect of ethanol on fetal development, grounded in the principle of critical developmental windows. It asks for a qualitative explanation of this principle for one craniofacial structure (the philtrum) and a quantitative calculation of an outcome measure (the palpebral fissure length $z$-score).\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative question regarding philtrum development. The problem establishes that teratogenic effects are timing-dependent and provides a sensitivity function, $s(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - 7)^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ with $\\sigma = 1$, which peaks at gestational age $t=7$ weeks. This function models the critical window for facial morphogenesis. The philtrum is a key craniofacial structure, and its development is part of this process. The principle states that the impact of a teratogen like ethanol is greatest when exposure coincides with the peak of developmental sensitivity.\nTherefore, if ethanol exposure is concentrated around $t=7$ weeks, when $s(t)$ is at its maximum ($s(7)=1$), the development of the philtrum will be most severely affected. This would lead to a higher probability of observing characteristic features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), such as a smooth or indistinct philtrum.\nConversely, if the same total dose of ethanol is consumed either significantly earlier (e.g., at $t=4$ weeks, where $s(4)$ is small) or later (e.g., at $t=10$ weeks, where $s(10)$ is also small) relative to this peak, the value of the sensitivity function $s(t)$ is much lower. Consequently, the resulting perturbation to philtrum development would be substantially less pronounced. This illustrates that the timing of exposure, relative to the specific developmental window of a given structure, is a critical determinant of the teratogenic outcome.\n\nNext, we perform the quantitative calculation for the palpebral fissure length $z$-score. The total reduction in the expected length, denoted as $L_{\\text{red}}$, is the cumulative effect over the exposure period. The problem models the instantaneous reduction as $\\mathrm{d}L = - r \\, u(t) \\, s(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t$. We are instructed to approximate the integral of this expression using a Riemann sum with a time step of $\\Delta t = 1$ week.
