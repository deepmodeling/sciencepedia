A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires starting from the first principles of the Michaelis–Menten framework. The reaction velocity, $v$, as a function of the concentration of a substrate or cofactor, $[S]$, is given by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nHere, the velocity is dependent on the concentration of the FAD cofactor, $[S]$.\n\nFirst, we write the expression for the reaction velocity of the wild-type (WT) enzyme, $v^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, using its specific parameters, $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} [S]}{K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}} + [S]}$$\nThe problem states that the velocity should be evaluated at a physiological FAD concentration of $[S] = K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. Substituting this condition into the equation for $v^{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} (K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}})}{K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}} + K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{2 K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nThe term $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ cancels, yielding:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of $K_m$ as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nNext, we write the expression for the reaction velocity of the variant (VAR) enzyme, $v^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$, using its parameters, $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$ and $K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}} [S]}{K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}} + [S]}$$\nWe evaluate this velocity at the same physiological FAD concentration, $[S] = K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $v^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}} (K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}})}{K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}} + K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given relationships for the variant's parameters: $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = (1 - 0.35) \\, V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.65 \\, V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\alpha \\, K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{(0.65 \\, V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) (K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}})}{(\\alpha \\, K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nWe can factor out $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ from the denominator:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{0.65 \\, V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\, K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}} (\\alpha + 1)}$$\nCanceling the common term $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ gives the expression for the variant velocity in terms of the wild-type $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and the parameter $\\alpha$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{0.65}{\\alpha + 1} V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the relative flux, $R$, which is defined as the ratio of the variant velocity to the wild-type velocity, $R = \\dfrac{v^{\\mathrm{VAR}}}{v^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\left( \\dfrac{0.65}{\\alpha + 1} V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\right)}{\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2} V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\right)}$$\nThe term $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$R = \\frac{\\dfrac{0.65}{\\alpha + 1}}{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives:\n$$R = 2 \\times \\frac{0.65}{\\alpha + 1} = \\frac{1.3}{\\alpha + 1}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the relative flux in terms of $\\alpha$.
