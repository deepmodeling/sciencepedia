The equation becomes $D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0$.\n        *   This is a homogeneous second-order linear ODE.\n        *   The characteristic equation is $D r^2 - k = 0$, which gives $r^2 = k/D$.\n        *   The roots are $r = \\pm \\sqrt{k/D}$.\n        *   The general solution is $C(x) = A \\exp(\\sqrt{k/D}x) + B \\exp(-\\sqrt{k/D}x)$.\n        *   Let's define the characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This simplifies the solution to $C(x) = A \\exp(x/\\lambda) + B \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Now apply the boundary conditions. The problem is symmetric around $x=0$, so we can solve for $x>0$ and use symmetry.\n        *   For $x > 0$, the boundary condition is that $C(x)$ must be finite as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $A \\exp(x/\\lambda)$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, we must have $A=0$.\n        *   So, for $x > 0$, the solution has the form $C(x) = C_R \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $C_R$ is a constant.\n        *   Similarly, for $x < 0$, the boundary condition is that $C(x)$ must be finite as $x \\to -\\infty$. The term $B \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ diverges. So, we must have $B=0$.\n        *   The solution for $x < 0$ has the form $C(x) = C_L \\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the problem (source at origin, uniform medium), we expect $C(x) = C(-x)$. This implies $C_L = C_R$. Let's call this constant $C_0$.\n        *   So, the general solution for all $x \\neq 0$ is $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Note that $C_0$ is the concentration at $x=0$. More precisely, $C_0 = C(0^+) = C(0^-)$. This matches the definition in the problem.\n        *   The characteristic length scale is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This is the distance over which the concentration decays by a factor of $1/e$. It represents the balance between diffusion (which spreads the morphogen) and degradation (which removes it).\n\n    *   **Part 2: Relate C₀ to S, D, and k**\n        *   To find the constant $C_0$, we need to use the source term $S\\delta(x)$. We integrate the full differential equation over a small interval around the origin, from $-\\epsilon$ to $+\\epsilon$, and then take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n        *   $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC(x) + S\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0$.\n        *   $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx + S \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = 0$.\n        *   Let's evaluate each term:\n            *   $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} dx = D \\left[ \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} = D \\left( \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=\\epsilon} - \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=-\\epsilon} \\right)$. This is the jump in the flux at the origin.\n            *   $-k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, if $C(x)$ is finite at $x=0$, this integral goes to zero. $C(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$, so this term vanishes.\n            *   $S \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = S \\times 1 = S$.\n        *   So, in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the equation becomes: $D \\left( \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^+} - \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^-} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   This is the \"jump condition\" for the derivative.\n        *   Now we need the derivatives of our solution $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$.\n            *   For $x > 0$, $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n            *   At $x=0^+$, $\\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^+} = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda}$.\n            *   For $x < 0$, $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n            *   At $x=0^-$, $\\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^-} = \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   Substitute these into the jump condition:\n        *   $D \\left( -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} - \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   $D \\left( -\\frac{2C_0}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   $S = \\frac{2DC_0}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   We need to relate $C_0$ to $S, D, k$. So rearrange: $C_0 = \\frac{S\\lambda}{2D}$.\n        *   Substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$: $C_0 = \\frac{S \\sqrt{D/k}}{2D} = \\frac{S}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$.\n        *   This gives the relationship between the peak concentration $C_0$ and the system parameters. The problem asks to relate $C_0$ to $S, D, k$, which we have done. Let's explicitly check the problem statement: \"relate the near-source amplitude $C_{0} \\equiv C(0^{+})$ to the source strength $S$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, and the degradation rate constant $k$\". This is it.\n\n    *   **Part 3: Find x_T**\n        *   We have the concentration profile for $x > 0$: $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   We are given a threshold concentration $C_T$. We need to find the position $x_T$ where $C(x_T) = C_T$.\n        *   $C_T = C_0 \\exp(-x_T/\\lambda)$.\n        *   We need to solve for $x_T$.\n        *   $\\frac{C_T}{C_0} = \\exp(-x_T/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: $\\ln \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right) = -\\frac{x_T}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   $x_T = -\\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right)$.\n        *   Using log properties, $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right)^{-1} \\right) = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   This makes physical sense: since $C_T < C_0$ for a boundary to exist, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, and $x_T$ is positive.\n\n    *   **Part 4: Final expression for x_T and robustness explanation**\n        *   The problem asks for $x_T$ as a function of $D, k, C_0, C_T$.\n        *   We have $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   We need to substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$.\n        *   So, $x_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   This is the final analytical expression for $x_T$. The variables are $D, k, C_0, C_T$. This is exactly what the problem asks for.\n\n    *   **Part 5: Robustness explanation**\n        *   The question asks how $\\lambda$ influences the robustness of positional information.\n        *   The position of the threshold, $x_T$, is given by $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C_T)$.\n        *   Positional information is \"robust\" if the position $x_T$ is insensitive to fluctuations in the parameters, particularly the source strength $S$.\n        *   Let's look at the sensitivity of $x_T$ to changes in $S$. From Part 2, we found $C_0 = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$.\n        *   Substitute this into the expression for $x_T$:\n            $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{S / (2\\sqrt{Dk})}{C_T} \\right) = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk}} \\right)$.\n        *   The position $x_T$ depends logarithmically on the source strength $S$.\n        *   Let's calculate the sensitivity of $x_T$ to a change in source strength $S$ by computing the derivative $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S}$.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} = \\lambda \\frac{1}{S / (2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk})} \\frac{1}{2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{S}$.\n        *   So, a small change $\\Delta S$ leads to a change $\\Delta x_T \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{S} \\Delta S$.\n        *   The absolute shift in the boundary position $x_T$ is directly proportional to $\\lambda$. So a larger $\\lambda$ (a longer gradient) leads to a larger absolute shift in the boundary for the same fluctuation in source strength $S$.\n        *   This means that a system with a smaller characteristic length $\\lambda$ (steeper gradient) is more robust in the sense that the absolute positions of its boundaries are less affected by fluctuations in the source production rate $S$.\n        *   This seems like a solid, principled explanation grounded in the derivation.\n        *   So, the explanation should be:\n                1.  The derived expression is $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C_T)$.\n                2.  The peak concentration is $C_0 = S/(2\\sqrt{Dk}) = S\\lambda/(2D)$.\n                3.  So $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(S\\lambda / (2DC_T))$.\n                4.  The sensitivity of $x_T$ to a change in source strength $S$ is given by the derivative $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S}$.\n                5.  $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} = \\lambda \\frac{1}{S\\lambda / (2DC_T)} \\frac{\\lambda}{2DC_T} = \\lambda \\frac{2DC_T}{S\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda}{2DC_T} = \\frac{\\lambda}{S}$.\n                6.  For a small fluctuation $\\Delta S$ in the source, the shift in boundary position is $\\Delta x_T \\approx \\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} \\Delta S = \\frac{\\lambda}{S} \\Delta S$.\n                7.  This shows that the absolute shift $\\Delta x_T$ is directly proportional to the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$.\n                8.  Therefore, a smaller $\\lambda$ (resulting from lower diffusion $D$ or higher degradation $k$) creates a steeper gradient that is more robust to fluctuations in source strength, meaning the absolute position of the threshold boundary shifts less.\n                9.  What about tissue properties $D,k$? They affect $\\lambda$ itself. We want robustness of $x_T$ to fluctuations in $D,k$.\n                    *   $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{C_0} \\frac{\\partial C_0}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{S\\lambda/2D} \\frac{S}{2D} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + 1$.\n                    *   Since $\\lambda = (D/k)^{1/2}$, fluctuations in $D$ and $k$ cause fluctuations in $\\lambda$.\n                    *   The shift $\\Delta x_T \\approx (\\ln(C_0/C_T) + 1)\\Delta \\lambda$. The position of the boundary is quite sensitive to fluctuations in the parameters that define the length scale itself. This is expected.\n                10. The question specifically asks about robustness to fluctuations in *source strength and tissue properties*. The relationship $\\Delta x_T \\propto \\lambda \\frac{\\Delta S}{S}$ is the key insight for source strength. A smaller $\\lambda$ improves robustness against source fluctuations.\n                11. A smaller $\\lambda$ also implies a steeper gradient, which means that any noise in the *reading* of the concentration $C$ by a cell translates into a smaller error in the inferred position $x$. Let's quantify this. From $C = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, we get $x = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C)$. So $\\frac{dx}{dC} = \\lambda ( \\frac{1}{C_0/C} ) (-\\frac{C_0}{C^2}) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{C}$. So $\\Delta x \\approx -\\frac{\\lambda}{C} \\Delta C$, or $|\\Delta x| \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{C} |\\Delta C|$. The positional error due to noise in concentration reading is proportional to $\\lambda$. Again, a smaller $\\lambda$ is more robust.\n\nOk, this all seems consistent.

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the decrease in the total length of embryonic tissue where at least one of two target genes (Wnt or BMP) is active, when extracellular antagonists are introduced. We will first calculate the total active length in the absence of antagonists and then in their presence, and finally compute the difference.\n\nA target gene is activated where the free concentration of its corresponding morphogen ligand exceeds a specific threshold.\n\n### Part 1: Activation Boundaries without Antagonists\n\nIn the absence of antagonists, the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration.\nThe Wnt target gene is active where the free Wnt concentration, $[W](x)$, is greater than the threshold $\\theta_W$. Without antagonists, $[W](x) = W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x)$. The activation domain is defined by the inequality $W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x) \\ge \\theta_{W}$.\nThe boundary of this domain, $x_W$, is found by setting the concentration equal to the threshold:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_W) = W_{0}\\exp(-x_W/\\lambda_{W}) = \\theta_{W}$$\nSolving for $x_W$:\n$$\\exp(-x_W/\\lambda_{W}) = \\frac{\\theta_{W}}{W_{0}}$$\n$$-x_W/\\lambda_{W} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{W}}{W_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$x_W = -\\lambda_{W}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{W}}{W_{0}}\\right) = \\lambda_{W}\\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{0}}{\\theta_{W}}\\right)$$\nThe Wnt target is active in the posterior region from $x=0$ to $x=x_W$, so the Wnt activation domain is $[0, x_W]$.\n\nSimilarly, the BMP target gene is active where $[B](x) > \\theta_B$. Without antagonists, $[B](x) = B_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x)$. The activation boundary $x_B$ is found by solving:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x_B) = B_{0}\\exp(-(L-x_B)/\\lambda_{B}) = \\theta_{B}$$\nSolving for $x_B$:\n$$\\exp(-(L-x_B)/\\lambda_{B}) = \\frac{\\theta_{B}}{B_{0}}$$\n$$-(L-x_B)/\\lambda_{B} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{B}}{B_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$L-x_B = -\\lambda_{B}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{B}}{B_{0}}\\right) = \\lambda_{B}\\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{0}}{\\theta_{B}}\\right)$$\n$$x_B = L - \\lambda_{B}\\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{0}}{\\theta_{B}}\\right)$$\nThe BMP target is active in the anterior region from $x=x_B$ to $x=L$, so the BMP activation domain is $[x_B, L]$.\n\nThe total length of tissue active for at least one target is the length of the union of these two domains, i.e., length($[0, x_W] \\cup [x_B, L]$). If $x_W \\ge x_B$, the domains overlap or meet, and the total active length is $L$. If $x_W < x_B$, the domains are disjoint, and the total active length is $x_W + (L - x_B)$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$W_{0} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $\\lambda_{W} = 250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta_{W} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$x_W = (250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{5}\\right) = 250\\ln(20)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 748.93\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$B_{0} = 120\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $\\lambda_{B} = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta_{B} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $L = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$x_B = (1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) - (300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})\\ln\\left(\\frac{120}{10}\\right) = 1000 - 300\\ln(12)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 254.53\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nSince $x_W \\approx 748.93\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} > x_B \\approx 254.53\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the two activation domains overlap.

Let's consider the Wnt pathway. The binding equilibrium is $W + A_W \\rightleftharpoons WA_W$, where $W$ is free Wnt, $A_W$ is the free antagonist, and $WA_W$ is the inactive complex. The dissociation constant is $K_W = \\frac{[W][A_W]}{[WA_W]}$. The total Wnt concentration is given by the mass balance equation $W_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [W] + [WA_W]$.\nThe problem states to assume that the free antagonist concentration is well-approximated by its total concentration, so $[A_W] \\approx A_{W}$.\nFrom the equilibrium expression, we have $[WA_W] = \\frac{[W][A_W]}{K_W} \\approx \\frac{[W]A_{W}}{K_W}$.\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x) = [W](x) + \\frac{[W](x)A_{W}}{K_W} = [W](x)\\left(1 + \\frac{A_W}{K_W}\\right)$$\nThe free Wnt concentration is therefore:\n$$[W](x) = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x)}{1 + A_W/K_W}$$\nThe Wnt target gene is activated where $[W](x) \\ge \\theta_W$. Substituting the expression for $[W](x)$:\n$$\\frac{W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x)}{1 + A_W/K_W} \\ge \\theta_W \\implies W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x) \\ge \\theta_W\\left(1 + \\frac{A_W}{K_W}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the presence of the antagonist effectively increases the activation threshold. Let's define the effective threshold $\\theta'_W$:\n$$\\theta'_W = \\theta_W\\left(1 + \\frac{A_W}{K_W}\\right)$$\nThe new Wnt activation boundary, $x'_W$, is found by solving $W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(x'_W) = \\theta'_W$:\n$$x'_W = \\lambda_{W}\\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{0}}{\\theta'_{W}}\\right)$$\nBy exact analogy, the effective threshold for BMP is $\\theta'_B = \\theta_B\\left(1 + \\frac{A_B}{K_B}\\right)$, and the new BMP activation boundary, $x'_B$, is given by:\n$$x'_B = L - \\lambda_{B}\\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{0}}{\\theta'_{B}}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values for the antagonists.\n$A_{W} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{W} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\\theta'_W = (5\\,\\mathrm{nM})\\left(1 + \\frac{50}{25}\\right) = 5(1+2)\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 15\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$A_{B} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{B} = 15\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\\theta'_B = (10\\,\\mathrm{nM})\\left(1 + \\frac{30}{15}\\right) = 10(1+2)\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNow we calculate the new boundaries:\n$$x'_W = (250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})\\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{15}\\right) = 250\\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 474.28\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$x'_B = (1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) - (300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})\\ln\\left(\\frac{120}{30}\\right) = 1000 - 300\\ln(4)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 584.11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nIn this case, $x'_W \\approx 474.28\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} < x'_B \\approx 584.11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The two activation domains, $[0, x'_W]$ and $[x'_B, L]$, are now disjoint. There is an inactive gap between $x'_W$ and $x'_B$.\nThe total active length with antagonists is the sum of the lengths of the two domains:\n$$L_{\\text{with-antag}} = x'_W + (L - x'_B)$$\n$$L_{\\text{with-antag}} = 250\\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) + \\left(1000 - \\left(1000 - 300\\ln(4)\\right)\\right) = 250\\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) + 300\\ln(4)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$L_{\\text{with-antag}} \\approx 474.28 + (1000 - 584.11) \\approx 474.28 + 415.89 \\approx 890.17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n### Part 3: Decrease in Total Active Length\n\nThe decrease in the total length of active tissue is the difference between the active length without antagonists and with antagonists.\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{active}} = L_{\\text{no-antag}} - L_{\\text{with-antag}}$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{active}} = L - (x'_W + (L - x'_B)) = L - x'_W - L + x'_B = x'_B - x'_W$$\nThis difference is precisely the length of the inactive gap that forms between the two domains.\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{active}} = \\left(1000 - 300\\ln(4)\\right) - \\left(250\\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)\\right)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nUsing a calculator for higher precision:\n$$x'_W = 250 \\times \\ln(20/3) \\approx 250 \\times 1.89711998 \\approx 474.279996\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$x'_B = 1000 - 300 \\times \\ln(4) \\approx 1000 - 300 \\times 1.38629436 \\approx 1000 - 415.888308 \\approx 584.111692\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{active}} \\approx 584.111692 - 474.279996 \\approx 109.831696\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $109.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe overall effect of the antagonists is to shrink the Wnt domain from the anterior side and the BMP domain from the posterior side. Initially, these domains overlapped, covering the entire tissue. After the antagonists are added, the domains shrink enough to create a gap of inactive tissue between them. The decrease in total active length is the size of this gap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{109.8}$$", "id": "5051847"}]}
