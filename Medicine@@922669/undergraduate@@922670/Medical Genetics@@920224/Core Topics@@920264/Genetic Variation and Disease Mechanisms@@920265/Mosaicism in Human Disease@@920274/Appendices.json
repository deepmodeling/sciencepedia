The scenario described is a standard model used to understand the quantitative consequences of such an event. The assumptions, while being idealizations (e.g., perfectly equal contribution), are common and necessary simplifications for creating a tractable, first-principles problem and do not violate scientific laws. They are scientifically realistic idealizations.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated with all necessary information and definitions provided. The set of assumptions and initial conditions uniquely determines the solution. The question asks for a specific, calculable quantity (a fraction).\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjectivity or opinion.\n4.  **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic (within the context of a model), or ill-posed. The terms are well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A formal solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nLet $N$ be the total number of blastomeres at the embryonic stage under consideration. From the problem statement, we have $N=8$.\n\nA single postzygotic mutation event occurs in exactly one of these blastomeres. Let's denote the set of all blastomeres as $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_8\\}$. Without loss of generality, let the mutation occur in blastomere $B_1$.\n\nThe variant is heterozygous. This means that prior to the event, the cell's genotype at the relevant locus was homozygous reference, which we can denote as $A/A$. The mutational event changes the genotype of this single cell, $B_1$, to heterozygous, denoted as $A/a$, where $a$ represents the variant allele. The other $N-1=7$ blastomeres ($B_2, \\ldots, B_8$) remain with the genotype $A/A$.\n\nThe problem states that there are no further mosaic-generating events and no selection or differential proliferation. This implies that all cells descending from a given blastomere will faithfully inherit its genotype. Therefore, the lineage of cells derived from blastomere $B_1$ will all have the genotype $A/a$. The lineages derived from blastomeres $B_2, \\ldots, B_8$ will all have the genotype $A/A$.\n\nA cell \"carries the variant\" if its genotype is not homozygous reference. In this model, cells with genotype $A/a$ carry the variant, while cells with genotype $A/A$ do not. Thus, the population of cells carrying the variant consists precisely of the entire lineage derived from the single mutated blastomere, $B_1$.\n\nThe central assumption is that \"each of the $8$ blastomeres contributes equally to the final somatic cell population.\" Let $C_{total}$ be the total number of somatic cells in the mature organism. Let $C_i$ be the number of cells in the lineage derived from blastomere $B_i$. The principle of equal contribution implies that:\n$$C_1 = C_2 = \\dots = C_8$$\nThe total number of cells is the sum of the cells from all lineages:\n$$C_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i = N \\cdot C_1$$\nFrom this, the contribution of any single lineage to the total cell population is:\n$$C_i = \\frac{C_{total}}{N}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of somatic cells that carry the variant. Let this fraction be denoted by $f_{mosaic}$. This is the ratio of the number of cells carrying the variant to the total number of somatic cells.\n$$f_{mosaic} = \\frac{\\text{Number of cells carrying the variant}}{\\text{Total number of somatic cells}}$$\nAs established, the cells carrying the variant are exactly the descendants of the single mutated blastomere, $B_1$. The number of these cells is $C_1$.\n$$f_{mosaic} = \\frac{C_1}{C_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_1$ in terms of $C_{total}$ and $N$:\n$$f_{mosaic} = \\frac{C_{total} / N}{C_{total}} = \\frac{1}{N}$$\nGiven $N=8$, the expected fraction of somatic cells that carry the variant is:\n$$f_{mosaic} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\nIt is important to distinguish this quantity from the variant allele fraction (VAF), which is the proportion of variant alleles among all alleles at that locus in a population of cells. For the cells carrying the variant (the $A/a$ cells), the VAF is $\\frac{1}{2}$. For the entire organism, the overall VAF would be the product of the fraction of mosaic cells and the VAF within those cells: $VAF_{organism} = f_{mosaic} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16}$. The problem explicitly asks for the fraction of *cells* carrying the variant, not the fraction of variant alleles. Therefore, the correct result is $\\frac{1}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n$$", "id": "5061888"}, {"introduction": "To analyze mosaicism clinically, we must connect the biological state to measurable data. This practice introduces the Variant Allele Fraction ($v$), a key metric from bulk sequencing, and guides you in deriving the fundamental equation that links it to the fraction of mutant cells ($f$) in a sample.

Assume the following foundational facts and definitions from medical genetics and genomics:\n\n- Mosaicism is the presence of two or more genetically distinct cell populations derived from a single zygote in a single individual.\n- In bulk sequencing of a tissue composed of many cells, the variant allele fraction (VAF), denoted $v$, is defined as the fraction of allelic observations (reads) at a locus that carry the variant among all allelic observations at that locus.\n- Each cell contributes a certain number of locus copies (alleles) to the bulk pool; in a copy-number-neutral autosomal diploid region, each cell contributes $t=2$ locus copies.\n- In mutant cells, the variant may occupy $m$ copies of the locus per mutant cell (for a heterozygous single-nucleotide variant, $m=1$; for a homozygous variant, $m=2$).\n- Let $f$ denote the fraction of cells in the bulk sample that are mutant for the variant.\n- Sequencing reads at the locus are assumed to sample alleles proportionally without allelic bias, and the read counts are sufficiently large to reflect the underlying allele proportions.\n\nTask 1.

We will proceed with the solution in two parts as requested.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the general relationship.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of cells in the bulk sample. By definition, the number of mutant cells is the product of the fraction of mutant cells, $f$, and the total number of cells, $N$.\n$$ \\text{Number of mutant cells} = fN $$\nThe remaining cells are non-mutant (wild-type).\n$$ \\text{Number of non-mutant cells} = (1-f)N $$\nEach cell in the sample, whether mutant or not, contributes a total of $t$ locus copies (alleles). Therefore, the total number of alleles in the entire sample is:\n$$ \\text{Total alleles} = N \\times t = Nt $$\nThe variant alleles are contributed exclusively by the mutant cells. Each of the $fN$ mutant cells contains $m$ copies of the variant allele. Thus, the total number of variant alleles in the sample is:\n$$ \\text{Total variant alleles} = (fN) \\times m = fNm $$\nThe variant allele fraction, $v$, is defined as the fraction of all allelic observations at the locus that carry the variant. Assuming that sequencing is an unbiased process that samples proportionally from the pool of all alleles, the observed $v$ is equal to the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of all alleles in the tissue.\n$$ v = \\frac{\\text{Total variant alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ v = \\frac{fNm}{Nt} $$\nThe total number of cells, $N$, is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator and can be cancelled. This gives the general relationship between the variant allele fraction $v$, the mutant cell fraction $f$, the number of variant copies per mutant cell $m$, and the total locus copies per cell $t$:\n$$ v = \\frac{fm}{t} $$\n\nTask 2: Calculation of the mutant cell fraction $f$.\n\nFirst, we algebraically rearrange the derived relationship to solve for $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{vt}{m} $$\nThe problem provides the following specific values:\n- The variant is heterozygous, meaning a mutant cell has one variant allele and one wild-type allele at the locus. Therefore, the number of variant copies per mutant cell is $m=1$.\n- The locus is in a copy-number-neutral autosomal diploid region. This means each cell has two copies of the chromosome region, and thus two copies of the locus. Therefore, the total locus copies per cell is $t=2$.\n- The sequencing data shows $k=120$ variant reads out of a total of $R=480$ allelic reads. The variant allele fraction $v$ is their ratio:\n$$ v = \\frac{k}{R} = \\frac{120}{480} $$\nWe simplify this fraction:\n$$ v = \\frac{12}{48} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nNow, we substitute the values for $v$, $t$, and $m$ into the rearranged equation for $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{4}) \\times 2}{1} $$\n$$ f = \\frac{2}{4} $$\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTherefore, the fraction of cells in the sample that harbor the variant is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

This problem explores how concurrent genetic events, specifically a deletion that alters the chromosome copy number, can distort the Variant Allele Fraction ($v$).

In a bulk tissue sample, a fraction $f=0.40$ of cells carry a heterozygous deletion at this locus, reducing their total copy number at the locus from $2$ to $1$ (hemizygosity). In these deleted cells, a single nucleotide variant (SNV) is present on the remaining allele, so there is exactly one variant copy per deleted cell.

Assume high-coverage short-read sequencing where read sampling is proportional to allele copy number across the mixture and sequencing error is negligible.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition that the variant allele fraction (VAF) equals the ratio of the total number of variant allele copies to the total number of allele copies at the locus in the sampled cell population, derive the expected VAF $v$ under the described mosaic deletion.

The variant allele fraction (VAF) is defined as the ratio of variant allele copies to the total number of allele copies at a given locus.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of cells in the sample. The sample consists of two subpopulations:\n1. A fraction $f$ of cells with a heterozygous deletion. These cells have a copy number of $1$ at the locus. A single nucleotide variant (SNV) is present on the remaining allele. The number of such cells is $fN$.\n2. A fraction $1-f$ of cells that are diploid. These cells have a copy number of $2$ at the locus and do not carry the SNV. The number of such cells is $(1-f)N$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of allele copies, $C_{\\text{total}}$, in the entire sample. This is the sum of alleles from both subpopulations.\nThe contribution from the first subpopulation (hemizygous) is the number of cells multiplied by the copy number per cell:\n$$C_1 = (fN) \\times 1 = fN$$\nThe contribution from the second subpopulation (diploid) is:\n$$C_2 = ((1-f)N) \\times 2 = 2(1-f)N$$\nThe total number of allele copies is the sum $C_1 + C_2$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = fN + 2(1-f)N = N(f + 2 - 2f) = N(2-f)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of variant allele copies, $C_{\\text{variant}}$. According to the problem, the SNV is present only in the first subpopulation, and each cell in this population has exactly one copy of the variant allele.

Assuming they are heterozygous, each contributes one variant allele. Thus, the total number of variant allele copies, $C_{\\text{variant, naive}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{variant, naive}} = (fN) \\times 1 = fN$$\nThe naive VAF, $v_{\\text{naive}}$, is the ratio:\n$$v_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{variant, naive}}}{C_{\\text{total, naive}}} = \\frac{fN}{2N} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nThis is the standard formula for the expected VAF from a heterozygous mutation present in a fraction $f$ of diploid cells.\n\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative distortion factor $D$, defined as $D = v/v_{\\text{naive}}$.
