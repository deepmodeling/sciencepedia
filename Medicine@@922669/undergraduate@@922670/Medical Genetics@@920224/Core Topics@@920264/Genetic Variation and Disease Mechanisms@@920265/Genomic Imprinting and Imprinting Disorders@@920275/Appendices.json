A common point of confusion is the difference between an imprinted allele and an expressed allele. This practice problem focuses on clarifying this fundamental concept, which is essential for correctly interpreting all imprinting-related phenomena. [@problem_id:1494601]", "problem": "In mammals, genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. This process involves DNA and histone modifications that silence one of the two parental alleles. Consider a hypothetical gene, *Gene X*, which is essential for normal embryonic development. *Gene X* is known to be maternally imprinted. Assuming normal inheritance and expression patterns, which of the following statements accurately describes the activity of *Gene X* in a healthy offspring?\n\nA. The allele for *Gene X* inherited from the mother is expressed.\nB. The allele for *Gene X* inherited from the father is expressed.\nC. Both the maternal and paternal alleles for *Gene X* are expressed.\nD. Neither the maternal nor the paternal allele for *Gene X* is expressed.\nE. The expression of *Gene X* depends on the sex of the offspring, with males expressing one allele and females expressing the other.", "solution": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic regulation in which one parental allele is silenced via DNA methylation and histone modifications, resulting in monoallelic expression. The key principle is that the term \"maternally imprinted\" means the allele inherited from the mother carries silencing marks and is not expressed, while the paternal allele is not imprinted and therefore is expressed.\n\nApplying this to *Gene X*:\n- *Gene X* is maternally imprinted, so the maternal allele is silenced.\n- Consequently, in a healthy offspring with normal imprinting, only the paternal allele of *Gene X* is active.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the maternal allele is silenced.\n- B is correct because the paternal allele is expressed.\n- C is incorrect because imprinting leads to monoallelic, not biallelic, expression.\n- D is incorrect because one allele (paternal) is expressed in normal imprinting.\n- E is incorrect because imprinting depends on parent of origin, not the sex of the offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494601"}, {"introduction": "Scientists often deduce gene function and regulation by observing the consequences of gene deletion in model organisms. This exercise places you in the role of a researcher interpreting data from a hypothetical mouse experiment. By analyzing the different outcomes of paternal versus maternal gene deletion, you can determine the parent-of-origin expression pattern of a novel gene, a core skill in genetic analysis. [@problem_id:1494647]", "problem": "In a genetic study on developmental regulation in mice, a researcher investigates a newly discovered autosomal gene, designated *GrowReg1*. To understand its function and expression pattern, the researcher creates two lines of genetically engineered mice using a targeted deletion of the entire *GrowReg1* coding sequence.\n\nMouse line A is generated by breeding so that offspring inherit a paternal chromosome with the *GrowReg1* deletion and a normal maternal chromosome. These mice appear phenotypically normal and are indistinguishable from wild-type mice.\n\nMouse line B is generated such that offspring inherit a maternal chromosome with the *GrowReg1* deletion and a normal paternal chromosome. These mice consistently exhibit a severe growth-retardation phenotype.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the *GrowReg1* gene?\n\nA. The *GrowReg1* gene is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed).\nB. The *GrowReg1* gene is paternally imprinted (maternally expressed).\nC. The *GrowReg1* gene is located on the X chromosome.\nD. Both parental alleles of *GrowReg1* are required for a normal phenotype.\nE. The experimental results are contradictory and suggest a technical error in the gene deletion process.", "solution": "We are told the gene is autosomal and that two mouse lines differ only by the parental origin of the deleted allele:\n- Line A: paternal deletion of *GrowReg1*; maternal allele intact; mice are phenotypically normal.\n- Line B: maternal deletion of *GrowReg1*; paternal allele intact; mice show severe growth retardation.\n\nRelevant biological principle: Genomic imprinting is parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic silencing of one allele. If an allele is imprinted, it is silenced. Thus:\n- Maternally imprinted means the maternal allele is silenced and the paternal allele is expressed.\n- Paternally imprinted means the paternal allele is silenced and the maternal allele is expressed.\n\nLet $E_{m}$ denote expression from the maternal *GrowReg1* allele and $E_{p}$ denote expression from the paternal *GrowReg1* allele. The total functional expression is\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}}=E_{m}+E_{p}.\n$$\nInterpret the observations:\n\n1. Line A (paternal deletion): Only the maternal allele is present, so\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}}=E_{m}.\n$$\nThe mice are normal, so $E_{m}$ alone is sufficient to produce a normal phenotype. Therefore, a functional maternal allele provides adequate expression.\n\n2. Line B (maternal deletion): Only the paternal allele is present, so\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}}=E_{p}.\n$$\nThe mice are growth retarded, which implies that $E_{p}$ is insufficient. In imprinting terms, this is most parsimoniously explained if the paternal allele is silenced (imprinted), i.e., $E_{p}\\approx 0$ in the relevant tissues and developmental stages. Consequently, loss of the maternal allele abolishes effective expression and produces the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the data support that the maternal allele is the expressed allele and the paternal allele is imprinted (silenced), i.e., *GrowReg1* is paternally imprinted (maternally expressed).\n\nCheck alternatives:\n- If *GrowReg1* were maternally imprinted (paternally expressed), then Line A (paternal deletion) would remove the expressed allele and should cause disease, contrary to observation.\n- The gene is autosomal by premise, so it is not X-linked.\n- Both alleles are not required: Line A shows a single maternal allele suffices.\n- The results are coherent and consistent with imprinting; no contradiction is present.\n\nThus the correct conclusion is that *GrowReg1* is paternally imprinted (maternally expressed).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494647"}, {"introduction": "The inheritance patterns of imprinting disorders can be non-intuitive because they depend on the sex of the parent transmitting the mutation. This is due to the process of erasing and re-establishing imprints during the formation of sperm and eggs. This problem challenges you to apply this principle to calculate the risk of having an affected child, a critical skill in genetic counseling scenarios involving imprinting defects. [@problem_id:1494638]", "problem": "A hypothetical gene, the *Neuronal Growth Associated (NGA)* gene, is essential for proper synapse formation in the central nervous system. The *NGA* gene is subject to genomic imprinting, where only the paternally inherited allele is expressed. The maternally inherited allele is silenced via DNA methylation targeted to its Imprinting Control Region (ICR). A complete loss of *NGA* gene expression results in a severe neurological disorder.\n\nResearchers have identified a microdeletion within the *NGA* gene's ICR. This specific deletion removes a critical transcription factor binding site, rendering the allele on that chromosome permanently transcriptionally silent, irrespective of its parental origin or methylation status.\n\nAn individual who is a carrier of this ICR microdeletion is phenotypically normal. Based on the principles of gametogenesis and the re-establishment of genomic imprints, which of the following statements correctly describes the probability of this carrier individual having a child affected by the neurological disorder?\n\nA. The risk is 50% for each child, regardless of the carrier's sex.\nB. If the carrier is male, there is a 50% risk for each child; if the carrier is female, the risk is 0%.\nC. The risk is 25% for each child, regardless of the carrier's sex.\nD. If the carrier is female, there is a 50% risk for each child; if the carrier is male, the risk is 0%.\nE. The risk is 0% for each child, regardless of the carrier's sex, as the carrier is unaffected.", "solution": "The key principles are the rules of genomic imprinting and the erasure and re-establishment of imprints during gametogenesis. For the *NGA* gene, only the paternally inherited allele is expressed; the maternally inherited allele is silenced via methylation of its ICR. The identified ICR microdeletion removes a critical transcription factor binding site and makes that allele permanently transcriptionally silent in cis, independent of imprinting state. Complete loss of *NGA* expression causes disease.\n\nA heterozygous carrier is phenotypically normal because, in that individual, the expressed allele is the intact one. Given that the gene is normally expressed only from the paternally inherited allele, a phenotypically normal carrier must have the deletion on the maternally inherited allele in their soma; otherwise, if the deletion were on the paternally inherited allele, there would be no expression and the individual would be affected. However, for transmission risk, the critical principle is that during gametogenesis, genomic imprints are erased and reset according to the sex of the individual, so the parental origin of each allele in the carrier’s soma is irrelevant for their gametes. The cis-acting deletion remains permanently inactivating regardless of imprint.\n\nConsider two cases.\n\nCase 1: the carrier is male. In spermatogenesis, both alleles acquire the paternal imprint. Thus, whichever allele he transmits will be the paternally inherited allele in the child and will be the only allele capable of expression in that child. He transmits the deleted allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$; because that allele is permanently silent and the child’s maternally inherited allele (from a normal mother) is silenced by imprinting, the child will have no expressed *NGA* allele and will be affected. He transmits the normal allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, producing an unaffected child. Therefore, for a male carrier, the risk per child is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: the carrier is female. In oogenesis, both alleles acquire the maternal imprint and are silenced in the child irrespective of sequence integrity. Therefore, the child’s expression depends entirely on the paternally inherited allele from the (assumed normal) father, which will be functional and expressed. Whether she transmits the deleted or normal allele does not affect the child’s phenotype, because the maternal allele is silenced in either case. Therefore, for a female carrier, the risk per child is $0$.\n\nThese outcomes correspond to the statement: If the carrier is male, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ risk for each child; if the carrier is female, the risk is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494638"}]}
