Since the total pool of H2B is constant, the system is comprised of only two states. Therefore, the fraction of H2B that is in the unmodified state is $1 - f(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system can be described by a differential equation for $f(t)$. The rate of change of the monoubiquitinated fraction, $\\frac{df}{dt}$, is the rate of formation of monoubiquitinated H2B minus its rate of removal.\n\nThe formation of monoubiquitinated H2B occurs through the ubiquitination of the unmodified H2B pool. According to the problem, this process follows first-order kinetics. The rate of this reaction is therefore proportional to the fraction of unmodified H2B, $1 - f(t)$, with the rate constant $k_u$.\nRate of formation = $k_u (1 - f(t))$.\n\nThe removal of the ubiquitin mark occurs through deubiquitination of the monoubiquitinated H2B pool. This is also a first-order process, so its rate is proportional to the fraction of monoubiquitinated H2B, $f(t)$, with the rate constant $k_d$.\nRate of removal = $k_d f(t)$.\n\nCombining these two processes, we can write the differential equation governing the fraction of monoubiquitinated H2B:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = k_u (1 - f(t)) - k_d f(t)\n$$\n\nThe steady state is defined as the condition where the system's state variables no longer change over time.

If each event scales with the availability of contact with probability $p$, the relative propensity of forming the ON state scales as $p^{n}$.
