The governing equation is effectively $\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_s - k_d P(t)$.\n*   **Wild-Type Half-Life:** $t_{1/2, \\text{wt}} = 2$ h.\n*   **Mutant Half-Life:** $t_{1/2, \\text{mut}} = 8$ h.\n*   **Condition:** The system has reached steady state under the mutant condition.\n*   **Starting Principles:** Central Dogma (justifying constant $k_s$), standard first-order decay law, and the definition of half-life under first-order kinetics.\n*   **Objective:** Derive the steady-state concentration $P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}$ for the mutant protein as a closed-form analytical expression in terms of $k_s$ and standard mathematical constants.\n\n**Step 2: Validation against Criteria**\n*   **Scientific Grounding (Critical):** The problem is scientifically sound. It describes protein turnover regulation via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and models the kinetics using a standard mass-action approach (zero-order synthesis, first-order decay). This is a fundamental and widely used model in quantitative cell biology and biochemistry. The described biological scenario—a gain-of-function mutation that removes a degron sequence, leading to increased protein stability (and thus a longer half-life)—is a well-established molecular mechanism.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It supplies a clear mathematical framework, sufficient parameters to determine the model's coefficients for the mutant protein (i.e., $t_{1/2, \\text{mut}}$), and a specific condition (steady state) from which a unique solution for the requested variable ($P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}$) can be determined.\n*   **Objective (Critical):** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous, and objective scientific terminology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The assumption of constant transcription and translation provides a physical basis for the constant synthesis rate $k_s$. The increase in half-life from $2$ h to $8$ h is consistent with the described mutation that impairs protein degradation. The information about the wild-type half-life ($t_{1/2, \\text{wt}}$) is extraneous for calculating the mutant's steady-state concentration but does not introduce any contradiction.\n*   **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws. It is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or based on unverifiable claims. It constitutes a standard exercise in applying principles of chemical kinetics to a biological system.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n*   The problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentration, $P(t)$, are governed by the linear, first-order ordinary differential equation based on the specified mass-balance model:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_s - k_d P(t)\n$$\nIn this equation, $k_s$ represents the constant rate of protein synthesis (modeled as a zero-order process), and the term $k_d P(t)$ represents the rate of protein degradation (modeled as a first-order process with rate constant $k_d$).\n\nThe problem states that the cell line has reached steady state with the mutant protein. At steady state, the concentration of the protein is, by definition, constant. Therefore, the time derivative of the concentration is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nLet $P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}$ be the steady-state concentration of the mutant protein and $k_{d, \\text{mut}}$ be its specific degradation rate constant. Applying the steady-state condition to the governing equation for the mutant protein gives:\n$$\n0 = k_s - k_{d, \\text{mut}} P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}\n$$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}$ yields the general expression for the steady-state concentration:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{d, \\text{mut}}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the steady-state concentration is determined by the ratio of the synthesis rate to the degradation rate constant.\n\nThe next step, as dictated by the problem statement, is to relate the degradation rate constant $k_d$ to the protein's half-life $t_{1/2}$ using the definition of first-order decay. For a substance undergoing first-order decay from an initial concentration $P_0$ (in the absence of synthesis), the concentration at time $t$ is given by the law of unimolecular processes:\n$$\nP(t) = P_0 \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to one-half of its initial value, such that $P(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{P_0}{2}$. Substituting this definition into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{P_0}{2} = P_0 \\exp(-k_d t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $P_0$ (where $P_0 \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_d t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $k_d$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k_d t_{1/2})) = -k_d t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, this becomes:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_d t_{1/2}\n$$\nTherefore, the relationship between the first-order rate constant and half-life is:\n$$\nk_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nWe apply this relationship to the mutant protein. The problem provides the half-life of the mutant protein as $t_{1/2, \\text{mut}} = 8$ h. The corresponding degradation rate constant, $k_{d, \\text{mut}}$, is:\n$$\nk_{d, \\text{mut}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2, \\text{mut}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}\n$$\nThe units of $k_{d, \\text{mut}}$ are hours$^{-1}$, which is dimensionally consistent. The synthesis rate $k_s$ is stated to be unaffected by the mutation.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $k_{d, \\text{mut}}$ into our equation for the steady-state concentration $P_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{d, \\text{mut}}} = \\frac{k_s}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8}}\n$$\nBy algebraic manipulation, we arrive at the final closed-form analytical expression for the steady-state concentration of the mutant protein in terms of $k_s$ and the standard mathematical constant $\\ln(2)$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss,mut}} = \\frac{8k_s}{\\ln(2)}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8k_s}{\\ln(2)}}$$", "id": "5033642"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply increasing protein levels, gain-of-function mutations can alter a protein's intrinsic activity in more nuanced ways, especially for signaling receptors.

The analysis will proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Solution\n\nThe task is to determine the expected experimental signatures for two distinct gain-of-function (GoF) mechanisms: constitutive activation and increased ligand sensitivity.\n\n**1. Mechanism 1: Constitutive Activation**\n\nA constitutively active receptor signals in the absence of its natural ligand. This implies that the receptor can spontaneously adopt an active conformation.\n\n-   **Basal Signaling Assay ($[L] = 0$)**: Due to spontaneous signaling, the production of the second messenger (cAMP) will be elevated compared to the wild-type (WT) receptor. Thus, the basal reporter signal will be high.\n-   **Pharmacological Modulation ($[L] = 0$)**:\n    -   A **neutral competitive antagonist** is defined as having no effect on basal activity. It binds to the receptor but does not influence its conformational equilibrium. Therefore, it will not reduce the elevated basal signal.\n    -   An **inverse agonist** is defined by its ability to stabilize the inactive receptor conformation. This action shifts the equilibrium away from the spontaneously active state, thereby *reducing* or abolishing the elevated basal signal. This is a key diagnostic test for constitutive activity.\n-   **Ligand Binding Assay ($K_d$, $B_{\\max}$)**:\n    -   Constitutive activation is a change in the receptor's conformational dynamics, not necessarily its affinity for the ligand. Therefore, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is expected to be unchanged relative to WT.\n    -   The problem states that receptor expression is experimentally matched, so the total number of receptors, reflected by $B_{\\max}$, must be unchanged.\n-   **Ligand Dose-Response Curve ($EC_{50}$, $E_{\\max}$)**:\n    -   The curve will start from a higher baseline (the elevated basal signal). The maximal response achievable, $E_{\\max}$, which is the sum of basal and ligand-stimulated activity, is often unchanged if the downstream signaling pathway capacity is the same.\n    -   The $EC_{50}$ represents the ligand concentration needed to achieve $50\\%$ of the *maximal ligand-induced effect*. If the mutation does not alter how the ligand binds or further activates the receptor, the $EC_{50}$ (when calculated on the response range from basal to maximum) should be largely unchanged.\n\n**2. Mechanism 2: Increased Ligand Sensitivity**\n\nThis form of GoF means the receptor responds more potently to its ligand. This is typically caused by an increased affinity for the ligand. The receptor is not active without a ligand.\n\n-   **Basal Signaling Assay ($[L] = 0$)**: As the receptor is not spontaneously active, the basal signal at $[L] = 0$ should be normal, i.e., the same as WT.\n-   **Pharmacological Modulation ($[L] = 0$)**: Since there is no elevated basal activity to modulate, neither a neutral antagonist nor an inverse agonist will have any effect on the reporter signal when $[L] = 0$.\n-   **Ligand Binding Assay ($K_d$, $B_{\\max}$)**:\n    -   Increased ligand sensitivity due to higher affinity means the ligand binds more tightly. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is an inverse measure of affinity. Therefore, a hallmark of this mechanism is a **decreased** $K_d$.\n    -   As before, $B_{\\max}$ is unchanged due to matched expression.\n-   **Ligand Dose-Response Curve ($EC_{50}$, $E_{\\max}$)**:\n    -   Since the receptor has higher affinity for the ligand (lower $K_d$), a lower concentration of ligand is required to achieve a given level of receptor occupancy and subsequent signaling. This results in a **left-shifted** dose-response curve, which corresponds to a **decreased** $EC_{50}$.\n    -   If the mutation only affects ligand binding affinity and not the receptor's maximal signaling capacity, then $E_{\\max}$ should be unchanged compared to WT.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against these derived signatures.\n\n**A. Allele $1$ shows elevated basal reporter signal at $[L] = 0$, unchanged $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$ relative to wild type, and its basal activity is reduced by an inverse agonist but not by a neutral antagonist; its dose-response curve shows little change in $EC_{50}$ when normalized for the elevated baseline. Allele $2$ shows normal basal reporter signal at $[L] = 0$, a left-shifted dose-response with lower $EC_{50}$ and unchanged $E_{\\max}$, a decreased $K_d$ with unchanged $B_{\\max}$, and neither the neutral antagonist nor the inverse agonist alters basal signaling when $[L] = 0$.**\n\n-   **Allele 1 Description**: The description perfectly matches the predicted signature for **constitutive activation**: elevated basal signal, reduction by inverse agonist but not neutral antagonist, and unchanged $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$.\n-   **Allele 2 Description**: The description perfectly matches the predicted signature for **increased ligand sensitivity**: normal basal signal, decreased $K_d$ leading to a decreased $EC_{50}$ (left-shift), and unchanged $E_{\\max}$ and $B_{\\max}$. The lack of response to pharmacological agents at $[L] = 0$ is also correct.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately and comprehensively distinguishes the two mechanisms using the provided principles.\n\n**B. Allele $1$ and allele $2$ both show normal basal reporter signal at $[L] = 0$, but allele $1$ displays an increased $E_{\\max}$ without a change in $EC_{50}$ or $K_d$, while allele $2$ displays a decreased $EC_{50}$ with a proportional increase in $E_{\\max}$; neither responds to an inverse agonist in the absence of ligand.**\n\n-   This option incorrectly states that both alleles have normal basal signal. This rules out constitutive activation, which is one of the mechanisms to be classified. Increased $E_{\\max}$ is a possible GoF mechanism (enhanced efficacy) but is distinct from the two categories given.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Allele $1$ shows elevated basal reporter signal at $[L] = 0$ accompanied by a markedly decreased $K_d$ on binding assays, and basal signaling is unchanged by an inverse agonist; allele $2$ shows normal basal reporter signal but an increased $E_{\\max}$ at saturating ligand with no change in $K_d$ or $EC_{50}$.**\n\n-   The description for Allele $1$ is flawed. Stating that basal signaling is \"unchanged by an inverse agonist\" contradicts the fundamental definition of an inverse agonist, which is to reduce constitutive activity. This is a critical pharmacological error. It also conflates constitutive activation with increased affinity (decreased $K_d$).\n-   The description for Allele $2$ identifies a change in $E_{\\max}$, which is a change in efficacy, not sensitivity ($EC_{50}$).\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

Allele $2$ shows normal basal reporter signal but both $K_d$ and $EC_{50}$ are increased, and basal signaling is reduced by a neutral antagonist in the absence of ligand.**\n\n-   The description for Allele $1$ contains two fundamental errors: that an inverse agonist has no effect on constitutive activity, and that a neutral antagonist reduces it. Both are contrary to the provided definitions.\n-   The description for Allele $2$ claims increased $K_d$ and $EC_{50}$. This describes a **loss-of-function** (decreased sensitivity), not a gain-of-function.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Allele $2$ shows an apparent increase in ligand sensitivity due solely to an increased $B_{\\max}$ with unchanged $K_d$, resulting in both a left-shifted $EC_{50}$ and elevated basal signaling at $[L] = 0$; allele $1$ shows unchanged basal signaling but a right-shifted dose-response with higher $EC_{50}$ and decreased $E_{\\max}$, consistent with constitutive activation that occludes further response to ligand.**\n\n-   The description for Allele $2$ attributes the effect to an increased $B_{\\max}$. This directly contradicts the experimental setup, which explicitly states \"matched receptor abundance\".\n-   The description for Allele $1$ claims \"unchanged basal signaling\", which is incorrect for constitutive activation. It also describes a right-shifted curve (higher $EC_{50}$), which is characteristic of loss-of-function or antagonism, not GoF.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5033582"}, {"introduction": "After exploring gain-of-function mechanisms at the cellular level, it is crucial to understand their consequences for a whole population.
