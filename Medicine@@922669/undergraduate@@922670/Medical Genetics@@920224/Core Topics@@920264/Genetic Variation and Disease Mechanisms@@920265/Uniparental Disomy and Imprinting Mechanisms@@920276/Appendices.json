The concepts of uniparental disomy, genomic imprinting, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), STR analysis, and their relationship to chromosome $15$ are standard, factual, and central to the discipline. The clinical vignette accurately describes PWS.

The problem is a standard, formalizable genetic analysis.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** None. The necessary data is provided and is internally consistent across all markers.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** None.

The conclusion is verifiable through standard genetic principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Mechanism\n\nThe analysis proceeds by examining the inheritance pattern at each STR marker locus. According to Mendelian inheritance, the proband must inherit one allele from the father and one from the mother.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Marker $L_1$**:\n    -   Father's genotype: $170/170$. He can only pass on a $170$ allele.\n    -   Mother's genotype: $180/186$. She can pass on either a $180$ or a $186$ allele.\n    -   Proband's genotype: $180/186$.\n    -   **Conclusion**: The proband has not inherited the mandatory $170$ allele from the father. Instead, the proband has inherited *both* of the mother's alleles ($180$ and $186$). This violates Mendelian segregation and indicates the proband received both homologous chromosomes (or at least this segment) from the mother. This specific pattern, where a heterozygous parent passes on both of their distinct alleles, defines **heterodisomy**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Marker $L_2$**:\n    -   Father's genotype: $202/208$. He can pass on a $202$ or $208$ allele.\n    -   Mother's genotype: $214/220$. She can pass on a $214$ or a $220$ allele.\n    -   Proband's genotype: $214/220$.\n    -   **Conclusion**: The proband has not inherited an allele from the father. The proband has inherited both of the mother's alleles ($214$ and $220$). This confirms maternal **heterodisomy**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Markers $L_3$ and $L_4$**: The same pattern holds for both markers.\n    -   For $L_3$, the proband has the mother's $156/164$ genotype and lacks any paternal allele ($142$ or $148$).\n    -   For $L_4$, the proband has the mother's $200/206$ genotype and lacks any paternal allele ($190$ or $198$).\n    -   **Conclusion**: Both markers independently corroborate the finding of maternal **heterodisomy**.\n\n**Synthesis**: The consistent pattern across all four STR markers, which span the $15q11-q13$ region, demonstrates that the proband has inherited two distinct homologous copies of this chromosomal region from the mother and no copy from the father. This condition is defined as **maternal uniparental heterodisomy (mUPD)** of chromosome $15$.\n\n**Imprinting Consequence**: The $15q11-q13$ region is subject to genomic imprinting. Certain genes within this region are expressed exclusively from the paternally inherited chromosome. In a case of mUPD, there is no paternal chromosome $15$. Consequently, the proband is unable to express these paternally-expressed genes. The absence of expression of these specific genes is the molecular cause of **Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)**. The clinical features described (hypotonia, poor feeding, hyperphagia, obesity) are the classic signs of PWS, which aligns the molecular finding with the clinical presentation. Maternal heterodisomy results from a nondisjunction event during meiosis I of oogenesis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Maternal uniparental heterodisomy of chromosome $15$ across $q11$-$q13$, leading to absence of paternally expressed genes in this region, consistent with Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS).**\nThe analysis above confirms maternal uniparental heterodisomy based on the STR data (proband inherited both of the mother's heterozygous alleles at all loci). This mechanism leads to the absence of paternally expressed genes from the $15q11-q13$ region, which is the cause of PWS. The clinical features match PWS. This statement is accurate in all respects.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Paternal uniparental heterodisomy of chromosome $15$ across $q11$-$q13$, leading to absence of maternally expressed genes in this region, consistent with Angelman syndrome (AS).**\nThis is incorrect. The STR data unequivocally shows a maternal, not paternal, origin of the disomic chromosomes. For example, at marker $L_1$, the proband has alleles $180$ and $186$ (from the mother) and lacks allele $170$ (from the father). Paternal UPD would result in a lack of maternally expressed genes, causing Angelman syndrome, but this is contrary to the genetic data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome $15$ due to a meiosis $II$ error, predicting homozygosity across the region and potential unmasking of a recessive mutation.**\nThis is incorrect. The proband's genotype is heterozygous at all informative loci ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, $L_4$), directly contradicting the prediction of homozygosity associated with isodisomy. Isodisomy would mean inheriting two identical copies of a single maternal chromosome, resulting in genotypes like $180/180$ or $186/186$ at marker $L_1$. The observed heterozygosity ($180/186$) indicates heterodisomy, which typically arises from a meiosis I error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Biparental inheritance with a paternal microdeletion of $15q11$-$q13$, predicting hemizygosity at these STR loci and single maternal allele per locus.**\nThis is incorrect. A paternal microdeletion spanning the STR markers would result in the proband inheriting only the maternal chromosome's copy of this region. The proband would therefore have only a *single* allele from the mother at each locus (e.g., either $180$ or $186$ at $L_1$, but not both). The STR analysis would show a single peak, interpreted as homozygous or hemizygous. The data clearly shows the proband has *two* distinct maternal alleles at each locus ($180/186$, $214/220$, etc.), which refutes this hypothesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Segmental uniparental disomy restricted to a region not subject to imprinting, predicting no imprinting phenotype despite uniparental inheritance.**\nThis is incorrect on two counts. First, the problem explicitly states that the markers \"lie within the canonical imprinted region associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\" Second, the proband presents with a severe clinical phenotype that is characteristic of a disorder of this specific imprinted region. Therefore, the premise that the region is not subject to imprinting and that no phenotype is predicted is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5089148"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to identify UPD, we now explore its cellular origins.

It describes a classic scenario in medical genetics for determining the origin of UPD. The concepts of meiosis, nondisjunction, crossing over, trisomy rescue, and STR marker analysis are fundamental principles in genetics. The provided genotype data are consistent with the description of maternal UPD (proband possesses only maternal alleles) and present a logically solvable puzzle. The terms are well-defined, and the question is well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nThe central task is to determine whether the nondisjunction event leading to maternal UPD of chromosome $15$ occurred in meiosis $I$ or meiosis $II$. The key to this lies in analyzing the pattern of heterodisomy versus isodisomy at the centromeric marker and distal markers.\n\n**First Principles of Meiosis and Nondisjunction:**\n\n1.  **Meiosis $I$**: Homologous chromosomes separate. Before this, in Prophase $I$, crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous pair. A nondisjunction event in meiosis $I$ (M-I NDJ) results in a gamete receiving both homologous chromosomes from that parent.\n2.  **Meiosis $II$**: Sister chromatids separate. A nondisjunction event in meiosis $II$ (M-II NDJ) results in a gamete receiving two identical (or near-identical, if crossing over occurred) sister chromatids.\n3.  **Heterodisomy vs. Isodisomy**:\n    - **Heterodisomy**: The inheritance of two different homologous chromosomes from a single parent.\n    - **Isodisomy**: The inheritance of two identical copies of a single parental chromosome.\n4.  **Trisomy Rescue**: A trisomic zygote (formed from a disomic gamete and a normal monosomic gamete) post-zygotically loses one chromosome. For UPD to occur, the chromosome from the normal parent must be the one that is lost.\n\n**Analysis of the Proband's Genotype:**\n\nThe proband's genotype is $M_c = \\{10,14\\}$, $M_p = \\{200,206\\}$, $M_q = \\{140,140\\}$. All alleles are maternal.\n\n- At the centromeric marker $M_c$, the proband has alleles $\\{10,14\\}$. Since the mother's genotype is $M_c = \\{10,14\\}$, the proband has inherited both of the mother's different alleles for this marker. This condition is known as **heterodisomy**.\n- At the distal $p$-arm marker $M_p$, the proband has alleles $\\{200,206\\}$. This is also **heterodisomy**, as the mother is $M_p = \\{200,206\\}$.\n- At the distal $q$-arm marker $M_q$, the proband has alleles $\\{140,140\\}$. The mother is $M_q = \\{132,140\\}$. The proband has inherited two copies of the maternal allele $140$. This condition is known as **isodisomy**.\n\n**Inferring the Meiotic Origin:**\n\nLet's consider the two possible maternal nondisjunction events.\n\n**Scenario 1: Maternal Meiosis $I$ Nondisjunction (M-I NDJ)**\nIn M-I NDJ, the mother's two homologous chromosomes ($15_{m1}$ and $15_{m2}$) fail to separate. The resulting egg contains both homologous chromosomes. Upon fertilization and subsequent trisomy rescue (loss of the paternal chromosome $15$), the child ends up with both maternal homologous chromosomes.\n- **Centromere:** Because the egg inherited both homologous chromosomes, the child will also inherit both, resulting in **heterodisomy** at the centromeric marker (assuming the mother is heterozygous, which she is: $\\{10,14\\}$). This matches the proband's genotype $M_c = \\{10,14\\}$.\n- **Distal Markers:**\n    - If no crossing over occurs between the centromere and a distal marker, that marker will also show heterodisomy. This is the case for $M_p$: the proband is heterodisomic ($\\{200,206\\}$), consistent with no crossover on the $p$-arm between the centromere and $M_p$.\n    - If a single crossing over event occurs between the centromere and a distal marker, that segment of the chromosome becomes isodisomic. Let the mother's chromosomes be $H_1: [M_c=10, M_q=132]$ and $H_2: [M_c=14, M_q=140]$. A crossover between the centromere and $M_q$ creates recombinant chromatids. Following M-I NDJ and Meiosis $II$, the egg can receive combinations of chromatids that, after trisomy rescue, result in isodisomy for $M_q$. For the proband to be $\\{140,140\\}$, the segregation must have yielded two chromatid segments both carrying the $140$ allele. This is a known consequence of M-I NDJ with a crossover.\n- **Conclusion for Scenario 1:** The observed pattern of centromeric heterodisomy and distal isodisomy is the classic signature of a maternal Meiosis $I$ error with a crossover event.\n\n**Scenario 2: Maternal Meiosis $II$ Nondisjunction (M-II NDJ)**\nIn M-II NDJ, Meiosis $I$ is normal. The secondary oocyte receives one of the mother's homologous chromosomes, which consists of two sister chromatids. In Meiosis $II$, these sister chromatids fail to separate.\n- **Centromere:** Because the egg inherits two sister chromatids, which share the same centromere, the child will be **isodisomic** for the centromeric marker. The child's genotype would be either $M_c = \\{10,10\\}$ or $M_c = \\{14,14\\}$. This contradicts the proband's genotype of $M_c = \\{10,14\\}$.\n- **Distal Markers:** If a crossover occurred between the centromere and a distal marker, the region *distal* to the crossover would be heterodisomic, while the region *proximal* (including the centromere) would be isodisomic.\n- **Conclusion for Scenario 2:** A Meiosis $II$ error is ruled out because it would mandate isodisomy at the centromere, which is not observed.\n\nThe proband's genotype, specifically the heterodisomy at the centromere ($M_c = \\{10,14\\}$), is the definitive evidence for a maternal Meiosis $I$ nondisjunction event. The isodisomy at the distal marker $M_q$ confirms that a crossover occurred between the centromere and $M_q$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Maternal meiosis $I$ nondisjunction followed by trisomy rescue; diagnostic pattern: centromeric markers show heterodisomy (two different maternal alleles, $m_1 \\neq m_2$), while distal segments may show regions of isodisomy if a crossover occurred between the centromere and the distal marker.**\n- This option accurately describes the genetic mechanism and its resulting allelic pattern. Our derivation shows that a Meiosis $I$ error leads to centromeric heterodisomy. It also correctly states that crossing over can lead to isodisomy in distal regions. This perfectly matches the proband's data ($M_c$ heterodisomy, $M_q$ isodisomy).\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Maternal meiosis $II$ nondisjunction followed by trisomy rescue; diagnostic pattern: centromeric markers show isodisomy (homozygosity for a single maternal allele), and the entire chromosome tends to be isodisomic because the two sister chromatids are identical copies.**\n- This option incorrectly identifies the meiotic stage. As derived, a Meiosis $II$ error results in centromeric isodisomy, which contradicts the proband's genotype ($M_c=\\{10,14\\}$). The statement that the *entire* chromosome tends to be isodisomic is an oversimplification that ignores the effect of crossing over, but the primary error is the incorrect signature for the centromere.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Paternal meiosis $I$ nondisjunction followed by trisomy rescue; diagnostic pattern: centromeric markers show heterodisomy for paternal alleles, with absence of maternal alleles.**\n- This option is directly contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies that genotyping confirmed maternal UPD with an \"absence of paternal alleles\".\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction and mitotic recombination; diagnostic pattern: mosaicism with patchwork isodisomy/heterodisomy boundaries not anchored to the centromere, and no specific centromeric signature distinguishing meiosis $I$ versus meiosis $II$ origin.**\n- While postzygotic errors are a possible cause of UPD, they typically lead to mosaicism and produce patterns of isodisomy that are not necessarily linked to the centromere in the same way as meiotic errors. The clear pattern of centromere-wide heterodisomy combined with distal isodisomy is the hallmark of a meiotic error (specifically M-I NDJ with crossover), making it the most parsimonious explanation. The problem describes a scenario perfectly explained by a meiotic mechanism.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5089214"}, {"introduction": "Our focus now shifts from chromosomal analysis to the quantitative world of epigenetic diagnostics.

In a typical autosomal ICR with maternal allele methylated and paternal allele unmethylated, normal diploid individuals carry one methylated allele and one unmethylated allele. In uniparental disomy (UPD), both homologous chromosomes are inherited from one parent; maternal UPD yields two methylated alleles at this ICR, while paternal UPD yields two unmethylated alleles. Methylation-Specific Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MS-MLPA) quantifies the fraction of methylated DNA at an ICR across a bulk sample, which is interpreted using fixed thresholds: values greater than or equal to $T_{\\mathrm{high}}$ are called hypermethylated and values less than or equal to $T_{\\mathrm{low}}$ are called hypomethylated.

Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal fraction, $f^{\\ast}$, of a maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) cell line within a mosaic sample that also contains normal diploid cells, such that the sample is classified as hypermethylated. This requires a three-step process: first, determining the expected methylation fraction for pure cell populations; second, modeling the methylation fraction of the mosaic sample; and third, solving for the minimal fraction $f^{\\ast}$ that meets the hypermethylation criterion.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical methylation fraction, $M$, for each of the three pure cellular states described. The methylation fraction is the ratio of methylated alleles to the total number of alleles at the specified Imprinting Control Region (ICR). In a diploid cell, there are $2$ alleles.\n\n1.  **Normal Diploid State:** A normal individual has one maternally-derived, methylated allele and one paternally-derived, unmethylated allele.\n    Let the methylation state be $1$ for a methylated allele and $0$ for an unmethylated allele. The average methylation fraction for a normal cell, $M_{\\text{normal}}$, is:\n    $$M_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{1 + 0}{2} = 0.5$$\n\n2.  **Maternal UPD (mUPD) State:** An individual with mUPD has inherited both homologous chromosomes from the mother.

At this ICR, both alleles are paternally derived and unmethylated.\n    The average methylation fraction for a pUPD cell, $M_{\\text{pUPD}}$, is:\n    $$M_{\\text{pUPD}} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0.0$$\n\nThese values ($0.0$, $0.5$, and $1.0$) represent the expected methylation fractions for pure samples of pUPD, normal, and mUPD cells, respectively.\n\nNext, we consider the mosaic patient sample. The sample is a mixture of two cell populations: a fraction $f$ of cells with maternal UPD and a fraction $1 - f$ of genetically normal cells. The problem states that the measured methylation fraction of the bulk sample, $M_{\\text{sample}}$, is the weighted average of the methylation fractions of the constituent cell populations.\n\nThe formula for the sample's methylation fraction is therefore:\n$$M_{\\text{sample}} = f \\cdot M_{\\text{mUPD}} + (1 - f) \\cdot M_{\\text{normal}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $M_{\\text{mUPD}}$ and $M_{\\text{normal}}$ that we derived:\n$$M_{\\text{sample}} = f \\cdot (1.0) + (1 - f) \\cdot (0.5)$$\n$$M_{\\text{sample}} = f + 0.5 - 0.5f$$\n$$M_{\\text{sample}} = 0.5f + 0.5$$\n\nThe problem provides the threshold for a sample to be classified as hypermethylated: the measured methylation fraction must be greater than or equal to $T_{\\mathrm{high}}$. The given value is $T_{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.65$.\nThus, the condition for hypermethylation is:\n$$M_{\\text{sample}} \\ge T_{\\mathrm{high}}$$\n$$0.5f + 0.5 \\ge 0.65$$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimal value of $f$, denoted $f^{\\ast}$, that satisfies this condition. This minimal value will occur at the point of equality.\n$$0.5f^{\\ast} + 0.5 = 0.65$$\n\nNow, we solve this linear equation for $f^{\\ast}$:\n$$0.5f^{\\ast} = 0.65 - 0.5$$\n$$0.5f^{\\ast} = 0.15$$\n$$f^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.15}{0.5}$$\n$$f^{\\ast} = 0.3$$\n\nTherefore, a minimum of $30\\%$ of cells in the sample must have maternal UPD for the overall sample to be classified as hypermethylated by the given laboratory criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3}$$", "id": "5089175"}]}
