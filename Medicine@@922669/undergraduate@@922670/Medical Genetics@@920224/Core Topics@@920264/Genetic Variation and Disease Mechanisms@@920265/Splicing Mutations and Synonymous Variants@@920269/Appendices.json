The premise that a synonymous mutation can cause exon skipping is a known mechanism in genetics, often by disrupting exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) or creating exonic splicing silencers (ESSs). The problem is therefore scientifically plausible.\n\nWe must check for internal consistency. The genetic code is triplet-based, meaning each amino acid is encoded by a codon of $3$ nucleotides. The length of exon $12$ is given as $93$ nucleotides. The number of amino acids this exon should encode is therefore $\\frac{93}{3} = 31$ amino acids. The problem states that exon $12$ encodes residues $210$ through $240$. The number of amino acids in this range is calculated as $240 - 210 + 1 = 31$ amino acids. The provided data are self-consistent. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and a clear objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying foundational principles of molecular biology to the provided data.\n\n**Part 1: Reading Frame Preservation**\nThe first step is to determine if the skipping of exon $12$ preserves the translational reading frame. The reading frame is maintained if the number of nucleotides deleted is a multiple of $3$. The problem states that exon $12$, which is skipped in its entirety, has a length of $93$ nucleotides. We check if $93$ is divisible by $3$:\n$$\n\\frac{93}{3} = 31\n$$\nSince $93$ is an integer multiple of $3$, the deletion of exon $12$ from the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript is an in-frame deletion. This means that the codons in the downstream exon (exon $13$) will be read in the correct frame, and translation will continue normally after the deletion, without creating a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon (which is a common consequence of frameshift mutations).\n\n**Part 2: Immediate Amino Acid Change**\nThe skipping of exon $12$ results in the removal of the amino acids it encodes from the final protein product. The problem specifies that in the canonical protein, exon $12$ encodes residues $210$ through $240$, inclusive. Therefore, the immediate amino acid change is the deletion of this entire block of $31$ amino acids. The resulting mutant protein will be shorter than the canonical protein, with the amino acid sequence corresponding to exon $11$ being directly joined to the sequence corresponding to exon $13$.\n\n**Part 3: Quantification of Domain Impact**\nThe final task is to calculate the fraction, $f$, of the kinase catalytic domain that is removed by this exon skipping event. The fraction $f$ is defined as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}}{N_{\\text{domain}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}$ is the number of amino acids deleted that are within the catalytic domain, and $N_{\\text{domain}}$ is the total number of amino acids in the catalytic domain.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of amino acids in the catalytic domain, $N_{\\text{domain}}$. The domain spans residues $170$ to $410$, inclusive.\n$$\nN_{\\text{domain}} = 410 - 170 + 1 = 241 \\text{ amino acids}\n$$\nNext, we determine the number of deleted amino acids that lie within this domain, $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}$. The deleted residues are from position $210$ to $240$. The domain spans from position $170$ to $410$.\nThe interval of deleted residues is $[210, 240]$.\nThe interval of the catalytic domain is $[170, 410]$.\nSince $170 \\le 210$ and $240 \\le 410$, the entire block of deleted amino acids is located within the catalytic domain. The number of amino acids deleted is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{deleted}} = 240 - 210 + 1 = 31 \\text{ amino acids}\n$$\nTherefore, $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}} = 31$.\n\nNow we can calculate the fraction $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{31}{241}\n$$\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the decimal value of this fraction and round it to four significant figures.\n$$\nf \\approx 0.128630705...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nf \\approx 0.1286\n$$\nThis result indicates that approximately $12.86\\%$ of the kinase catalytic domain is removed, which would almost certainly lead to a non-functional or severely impaired enzyme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1286}$$", "id": "5083666"}, {"introduction": "The cell is not a passive observer of genetic errors; it has sophisticated quality control systems.

A synonymous single-nucleotide variant within a coding exon disrupts an exonic splicing enhancer, leading to exon skipping during splicing. The skipping event removes $87$ nucleotides from the coding sequence. This altered splicing pattern results in a premature termination codon (PTC) located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction in the mature mRNA.\n\nRecall the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) model of Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD): during splicing, EJCs are deposited on mRNA approximately one EJC per exon–exon junction, and a widely observed rule is that NMD is generally elicited if the ribosome terminates at a PTC located more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction, leaving at least one downstream EJC bound during the pioneering round of translation.\n\nUsing this EJC-based framework, determine whether NMD is expected for the described transcript by computing an indicator variable $I$ defined as $I = 1$ if NMD is expected and $I = 0$ if NMD is not expected.

No rounding is required; $I$ is dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of whether a specific mRNA transcript, altered by an exon skipping event, will be targeted for degradation by the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway. The decision is to be based on the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) model of NMD.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles. In eukaryotes, protein-coding genes are often composed of exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions). The initial transcript, or pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), contains both. The process of splicing removes the introns and ligates the exons to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). During splicing, a multi-protein complex known as the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA approximately $20$ to $24$ nucleotides upstream of each newly formed exon-exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing process.\n\nThe mature mRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation by the ribosome. A \"pioneering\" or first round of translation occurs, during which the ribosome moves along the mRNA, synthesizing a protein and simultaneously displacing the EJCs. This process also serves as a quality control mechanism.\n\nNonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). A PTC is a stop codon that appears earlier in the coding sequence than the normal stop codon. The EJC model for NMD posits that the trigger for NMD is the presence of an EJC remaining on the mRNA after the ribosome has terminated translation at a PTC.\n\nThe problem provides a specific rule for NMD activation: NMD is elicited if the ribosome terminates at a PTC located more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction. This distance ensures that the terminating ribosome complex is unable to interact with and displace the EJC associated with that downstream junction. The presence of this \"leftover\" EJC on the mRNA is the signal that recruits the NMD machinery to degrade the transcript.\n\nLet us analyze the specific data provided in the problem statement.\n1.  A synonymous single-nucleotide variant leads to the skipping of an exon. This is a known mechanism where a seemingly silent mutation alters splicing regulatory elements like an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE).\n2.  The size of the skipped exon is $87$ nucleotides. Since $87$ is a multiple of $3$ ($87 = 3 \\times 29$), this skipping event results in an in-frame deletion of $29$ codons.\n3.  Despite the in-frame nature of the deletion, the problem states that the altered splicing results in a premature termination codon (PTC). This is plausible if the new juxtaposition of the flanking exons creates a stop codon sequence. The existence of this PTC is a given premise of the problem.\n4.  The PTC is located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the *final* exon–exon junction in the mature mRNA. Let us define this distance as $d_{PTC}$. So, $d_{PTC} = 120$ nucleotides.\n5.  The NMD trigger threshold is a PTC-to-junction distance of more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides. Let's denote the critical threshold distance as $d_{threshold}$. Based on the problem, NMD is triggered if $d_{PTC} > d_{threshold}$. The range given is $50$ to $55$ nucleotides. We will use the more conservative upper bound of this range for our evaluation, meaning NMD is triggered if the PTC is more than $55$ nucleotides upstream of the junction.\n\nWe must now compare the given position of the PTC with the threshold for NMD.\nThe distance of the PTC from the final exon-exon junction is $d_{PTC} = 120$ nucleotides.\nThe threshold distance for triggering NMD is $d_{threshold} = 55$ nucleotides.\n\nThe condition for NMD activation is $d_{PTC} > d_{threshold}$.\nSubstituting the values, we evaluate the inequality:\n$$120 > 55$$\nThis inequality is true. The PTC is located significantly further upstream of the final exon-exon junction than the critical threshold distance. Consequently, during the pioneering round of translation, the ribosome will terminate at the PTC and dissociate from the mRNA without displacing the EJC associated with that final junction. The persistence of this EJC on the mRNA will signal that the transcript is aberrant, leading to its degradation via the NMD pathway.\n\nTherefore, NMD is expected for the described transcript.\n\nThe problem asks for an indicator variable $I$, where $I=1$ if NMD is expected and $I=0$ if NMD is not expected. Based on our analysis, NMD is expected.\nThus, the value of the indicator variable is $I=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "5083664"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the root cause: how can a \"silent,\" or synonymous, mutation disrupt splicing?

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the change in the total ESE score, `$\\Delta S$`, resulting from a single nucleotide substitution. The total score, `$S_{\\text{total}}$`, for a sequence is the sum of the log-odds scores of all its constituent length-$5$ windows. The `$9$`-nucleotide sequence contains five such windows, starting at positions `$1, 2, 3, 4$`, and `$5`.\n\nLet `$S_{\\text{ref}}$` be the reference sequence `$\\text{ACTGAACGT}$` and `$S_{\\text{var}}$` be the variant sequence `$\\text{ACTGAGCGT}$`.\nThe total scores are:\n$$\nS_{\\text{total}}(\\text{ref}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{5} S(w_j(\\text{ref}))\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\text{total}}(\\text{var}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{5} S(w_j(\\text{var}))\n$$\nwhere `$w_j$` is the window starting at position `$j$`.\n\nThe change in the total score is:\n$$\n\\Delta S = S_{\\text{total}}(\\text{var}) - S_{\\text{total}}(\\text{ref}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\left[ S(w_j(\\text{var})) - S(w_j(\\text{ref})) \\right]\n$$\n\nThe single nucleotide substitution occurs at position `$6$`, where an `$A$` is replaced by a `$G$`. We must identify which of the five windows are affected by this change. A window `$w_j$` starting at position `$j$` and of length `$5$` covers sequence positions `$j$` to `$j+4$`. A window is affected if position `$6$` falls within this range, i.e., `$j \\le 6 \\le j+4$`. This inequality simplifies to `$2 \\le j \\le 6$`. Since windows only start up to position `$5$`, the affected windows are those for `$j \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$`. The window `$w_1$` (positions `$1-5$`) is not affected by the change at position `$6$`, so its score contribution to `$\\Delta S$` is zero.\n\nTherefore, `$\\Delta S$` simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\left[ S(w_2(\\text{var})) - S(w_2(\\text{ref})) \\right] + \\left[ S(w_3(\\text{var})) - S(w_3(\\text{ref})) \\right] + \\left[ S(w_4(\\text{var})) - S(w_4(\\text{ref})) \\right] + \\left[ S(w_5(\\text{var})) - S(w_5(\\text{ref})) \\right]\n$$\n\nLet's analyze the score change for a single affected window `$w_j$`. The score is `$S(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\ln(P_i(b_i)/q(b_i))$`. The difference `$S(w_j(\\text{var})) - S(w_j(\\text{ref}))$` will only have a non-zero contribution from the single base that differs between the two windows.\nThe mutation at sequence position `$k=6$` corresponds to position `$i = k-j+1 = 6-j+1 = 7-j$` within the PWM for window `$w_j$`.\n\nFor a given window `$w_j$`, the change in score is:\n$$\n\\Delta S_j = S(w_j(\\text{var})) - S(w_j(\\text{ref})) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{7-j}(G)}{q(G)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{7-j}(A)}{q(A)}\\right)\n$$\nSince the background distribution `$q$` is uniform (`$q(A) = q(G) = 0.25$`), the expression simplifies:\n$$\n\\Delta S_j = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{7-j}(G)}{P_{7-j}(A)}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we compute this for each affected window, `$j=2, 3, 4, 5$`.\n\n1.  **Window `$w_2$` (`$j=2$`):** The mutation is at PWM position `$i = 7-2 = 5$`.\n    `$w_2(\\text{ref}) = \\text{CTGAA}$`, `$w_2(\\text{var}) = \\text{CTGAG}$`.\n    `$\\Delta S_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_5(G)}{P_5(A)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.5}\\right) = \\ln(0.4)$`.\n\n2.  **Window `$w_3$` (`$j=3$`):** The mutation is at PWM position `$i = 7-3 = 4$`.\n    `$w_3(\\text{ref}) = \\text{TGAAC}$`, `$w_3(\\text{var}) = \\text{TGAGC}$`.\n    `$\\Delta S_3 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_4(G)}{P_4(A)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.6}{0.1}\\right) = \\ln(6)$`.\n\n3.  **Window `$w_4$` (`$j=4$`):** The mutation is at PWM position `$i = 7-4 = 3$`.\n    `$w_4(\\text{ref}) = \\text{GAACG}$`, `$w_4(\\text{var}) = \\text{GAGCG}$`.\n    `$\\Delta S_4 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_3(G)}{P_3(A)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.6}\\right) = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$`.\n\n4.  **Window `$w_5$` (`$j=5$`):** The mutation is at PWM position `$i = 7-5 = 2$`.\n    `$w_5(\\text{ref}) = \\text{AACGT}$`, `$w_5(\\text{var}) = \\text{AGCGT}$`.\n    `$\\Delta S_5 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2(G)}{P_2(A)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.2}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0$`.\n\nThe total change `$\\Delta S$` is the sum of these individual changes:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\Delta S_1 + \\Delta S_2 + \\Delta S_3 + \\Delta S_4 + \\Delta S_5 = 0 + \\ln(0.4) + \\ln(6) - \\ln(3) + 0\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`$\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$` and `$\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$`):\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\ln(0.4) + \\ln(6/3) = \\ln(0.4) + \\ln(2) = \\ln(0.4 \\times 2) = \\ln(0.8)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\ln(0.8) \\approx -0.22314355...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives `$-0.2231$`.\n\nFinally, we address the conceptual question: \"briefly justify whether preservation of amino acid identity implies functional neutrality for splicing under this model.\"\nThe premise of the problem demonstrates that preservation of amino acid identity does not imply functional neutrality.
