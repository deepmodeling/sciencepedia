This exercise explores the fundamental process of passive demethylation, which occurs when the maintenance machinery is absent. By modeling methylation levels across cell divisions, you will derive the rate of dilution and gain insight into the default epigenetic state in the absence of active maintenance, a crucial baseline for studying all epigenetic regulation [@problem_id:5025333].", "problem": "A cultured human cell line lacks DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the canonical maintenance methyltransferase that copies cytosine methylation from the parental strand onto the newly synthesized daughter strand during semiconservative DNA replication. Cytosine methylation in cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides is typically symmetric across complementary strands in the parental duplex. During S-phase, replication is semiconservative: each daughter duplex contains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. In the absence of maintenance methylation and of any active demethylation or de novo methylation, the newly synthesized strand remains unmethylated at CpG sites whose parental strand was methylated, producing hemimethylated CpGs.\n\nLet the genome-wide CpG methylation level be quantified as the fraction $m$ of methylated cytosines across all CpG cytosines, and suppose the initial level at the start of the first S-phase is $m_{0} = 0.8$. Consider a sequence of $3$ consecutive cell divisions under these conditions. Define the per-division methylation dilution rate $r$ as the constant in the recurrence $m_{n+1} = (1 - r)\\,m_{n}$, where $n$ counts completed divisions. Using only the principles of semiconservative replication and the absence of maintenance methylation by DNMT1, derive the value of $r$ and report it as a pure number. No rounding is required, and no units should be included in the final answer.", "solution": "Let $m_n$ be the genome-wide CpG methylation level after $n$ completed cell divisions. This is defined as the fraction of all cytosines within CpG contexts that are methylated. Let $N_{C, \\text{total}}$ be the total number of cytosines in CpG contexts within a single diploid (G1 phase) genome. Let $N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)}$ be the number of these cytosines that are methylated in a cell after $n$ divisions.\n\nBy definition, the methylation level is:\n$$m_n = \\frac{N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)}}{N_{C, \\text{total}}}$$\n\nLet us consider a single cell that has just completed its $n$-th division. It is in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Its methylation level is $m_n$. The number of methylated cytosines is $N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)}$.\n\nThis cell then enters the S-phase and undergoes semiconservative DNA replication. Each strand of the DNA duplex serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. The cell's DNA content doubles, and it enters the G2 phase.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, there is no maintenance methylation by DNMT1. This means that while the parental strands retain their original methylation patterns, the newly synthesized strands are completely unmethylated. Consequently, the total number of methylated cytosines in the entire G2 cell remains unchanged from its G1 value.\n$$N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{\\text{(G2 cell)}} = N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)}$$\n\nHowever, the total number of CpG cytosines in the G2 cell has doubled due to replication.\n$$N_{C, \\text{total}}^{\\text{(G2 cell)}} = 2 \\cdot N_{C, \\text{total}}$$\n\nNext, the cell undergoes mitosis and cytokinesis, dividing into two identical daughter cells. The replicated chromosomes are segregated equally between the two daughter cells. Therefore, the total number of methylated cytosines is divided equally between them. Each daughter cell, which is now in the G1 phase of the $(n+1)$-th generation, contains:\n$$N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n+1)} = \\frac{N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{\\text{(G2 cell)}}}{2} = \\frac{N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)}}{2}$$\n\nEach daughter cell has a diploid genome, so the total number of CpG cytosines returns to the original value:\n$$N_{C, \\text{total}}^{\\text{(daughter cell)}} = N_{C, \\text{total}}$$\n\nThe methylation level in each daughter cell, $m_{n+1}$, can now be calculated:\n$$m_{n+1} = \\frac{N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n+1)}}{N_{C, \\text{total}}} = \\frac{N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)} / 2}{N_{C, \\text{total}}}$$\n\nWe can substitute $N_{C, \\text{methylated}}^{(n)} = m_n \\cdot N_{C, \\text{total}}$ into this expression:\n$$m_{n+1} = \\frac{(m_n \\cdot N_{C, \\text{total}}) / 2}{N_{C, \\text{total}}}$$\n\nThe term $N_{C, \\text{total}}$ cancels out, leaving a direct relationship between $m_{n+1}$ and $m_n$:\n$$m_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} m_n$$\n\nThe problem provides a recurrence relation of the form $m_{n+1} = (1 - r) m_n$, where $r$ is the per-division methylation dilution rate. By comparing our derived relation with the given one, we can equate the scaling factors:\n$$1 - r = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSolving for $r$ yields:\n$$r = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe value of $r$ is derived solely from the principle of semiconservative replication in the absence of maintenance methylation. The specific initial methylation level $m_0 = 0.8$ and the number of divisions $3$ are consistent with the scenario but are not required for the derivation of the constant rate $r$. The rate of dilution is half per division because exactly half of the DNA strands in the next generation are newly synthesized and unmethylated, effectively halving the overall density of methyl marks across the entire pool of DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "5025333"}, {"introduction": "Accurate quantification is the bedrock of experimental science, and epigenetics is no exception.

Conventional bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) reports the fraction of reads calling cytosine as methylated signal, which comprises both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, plus residual non-conversion of unmodified cytosine. Oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq) uses a prior oxidation step intended to convert 5-hydroxymethylcytosine into a form that is deaminated by bisulfite, so that only 5-methylcytosine is retained as cytosine, again with a small residual non-conversion of unmodified cytosine.
