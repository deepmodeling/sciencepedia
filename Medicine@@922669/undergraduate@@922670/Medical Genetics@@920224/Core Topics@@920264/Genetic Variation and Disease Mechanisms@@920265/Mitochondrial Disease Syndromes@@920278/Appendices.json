It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem requires mapping the specified deletion onto the human mitochondrial genome (rCRS) and deducing the consequences based on the functions of the affected genes.\n\n**1. Identification of Deleted Genes**\nThe human mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule of $16{,}569$ bp, encoding $13$ protein subunits of the OXPHOS system, $2$ ribosomal RNAs, and $22$ transfer RNAs. We must consult the rCRS gene map (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_012920.1) to identify which genes are located within the deleted segment from bp $10{,}770$ to bp $14{,}148$.\n\nThe coordinates of the relevant protein-coding genes surrounding and within this interval are:\n- *MT-ND3*: $10{,}059$ - $10{,}404$ (not in deletion)\n- *MT-ND4L*: $10{,}470$ - $10{,}766$ (not in deletion, ends just before the start)\n- *MT-ND4*: $10{,}760$ - $12{,}137$\n- *MT-ND5*: $12{,}337$ - $14{,}148$\n- *MT-ND6*: $14{,}149$ - $14{,}673$ (starts immediately after the end of the deletion)\n- *MT-CYB*: $14{,}747$ - $15{,}887$ (not in deletion)\n\nAnalyzing the overlap with the deletion interval ($10{,}770$ - $14{,}148$):\n- *MT-ND4*: The gene starts at bp $10{,}760$. The deletion begins at bp $10{,}770$. This means the first $10$ bp of the *MT-ND4* coding sequence are preserved, but the rest of the gene (from its $11^{\\text{th}}$ bp to its end at $12{,}137$) is deleted. The resulting transcript would encode a non-functional, severely truncated peptide. Therefore, for all functional purposes, the *MT-ND4* gene product is lost.\n- *MT-ND5*: The gene spans from bp $12{,}337$ to bp $14{,}148$. This entire region is contained within the specified deletion. Thus, the *MT-ND5* gene is completely removed.\n- *MT-ND6*: The gene begins at bp $14{,}149$, which is one base pair after the deletion ends. This gene is therefore intact.\n\nIn addition to protein-coding genes, several tRNA genes are located in this interval (*MT-TH*, *MT-TS2*, *MT-TL2*), but the question specifically asks to identify the protein-coding genes and the effect on Complex I.\n\nConclusion of gene identification: The protein-coding genes whose function is abolished by this deletion are *MT-ND4* and *MT-ND5*.\n\n**2. Prediction of Biochemical Consequence**\nThe identified genes, *MT-ND4* and *MT-ND5*, encode subunits of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Complex I is a massive enzyme complex with $44$ subunits in humans, $7$ of which are encoded by mtDNA (*MT-ND1*, *MT-ND2*, *MT-ND3*, *MT-ND4*, *MT-ND4L*, *MT-ND5*, and *MT-ND6*). These mtDNA-encoded subunits form the core of the membrane-embedded arm of Complex I, which is responsible for proton pumping and is essential for the stability and assembly of the entire complex.\n\nThe problem states that Complex I requires its full complement of mitochondrially encoded subunits for assembly and function. The loss of the *MT-ND4* and *MT-ND5* subunits, which are integral components of the proton-pumping membrane arm, would prevent the proper assembly of a functional Complex I. Consequently, the cell would suffer from a severe deficiency of Complex I activity. This deficiency manifests as:\n- Markedly reduced ability to oxidize NADH to NAD$^{+}$.\n- Markedly reduced ability to transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone.\n- Markedly reduced ability to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nThe functions of other OXPHOS complexes rely on different sets of mtDNA-encoded genes (*MT-CO1*, *MT-CO2*, *MT-CO3* for Complex IV; *MT-CYB* for Complex III; *MT-ATP6*, *MT-ATP8* for Complex V), which are not located in the deleted region. Therefore, the primary defect would be isolated to Complex I, and the synthesis and assembly of the other complexes would be primarily preserved. Secondary effects on other complexes may occur due to substrate imbalances (e.g., a highly oxidized ubiquinone pool affecting Complex III), but the primary, direct lesion is in Complex I.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. MT-ND4 and MT-ND5 are deleted; complex I shows markedly reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH):ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and proton pumping due to failed membrane arm assembly, with primary preservation of other complexes.**\n- **Gene identification:** Correctly identifies that *MT-ND4* and *MT-ND5* are the affected protein-coding genes.\n- **Biochemical prediction:** Correctly predicts a severe deficiency in Complex I activity (both catalysis and proton pumping) due to a failure in the assembly of the membrane arm. Correctly states that other complexes are primarily unaffected.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. MT-CO1 and MT-CO2 are deleted; complex I activity is normal but complex IV is deficient due to impaired cytochrome c oxidase subunits.**\n- **Gene identification:** Incorrect. The genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II (*MT-CO1* and *MT-CO2*) are located far outside the deletion interval ($5{,}904$-$7{,}445$ and $7{,}586$-$8{,}269$, respectively).\n- **Biochemical prediction:** Incorrect. The predicted defect is in Complex IV, but the deleted genes encode Complex I subunits.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. MT-ND4, MT-ND5, and MT-ND6 are deleted; complex I and complex III are both primarily deficient because the ubiquinone pool cannot be reduced.**\n- **Gene identification:** Incorrect. The *MT-ND6* gene starts at bp $14{,}149$ and is not part of the deletion, which ends at $14{,}148$.\n- **Biochemical prediction:** Incorrect. It incorrectly claims a *primary* deficiency in Complex III. The gene for the mtDNA-encoded subunit of Complex III, *MT-CYB*, is intact. A defect in Complex I would cause a *secondary* effect on Complex III activity due to a lack of reduced ubiquinone, not a primary deficiency.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No protein-coding genes are deleted (only transfer ribonucleic acids are affected); complex I activity is expected to be normal aside from minor translational inefficiencies.**\n- **Gene identification:** Incorrect. The deletion clearly removes the coding sequences for *MT-ND4* and *MT-ND5*.\n- **Biochemical prediction:** Incorrect. The loss of two core structural subunits of Complex I results in a catastrophic failure of its assembly and function, not \"minor translational inefficiencies.\" The predicted outcome is a gross underestimate of the damage.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5059645"}, {"introduction": "Building on the analysis of a single genetic lesion, this practice expands to the level of clinical differential diagnosis. It explores how a single syndrome, Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), can result from two distinct genetic etiologies: a primary large-scale deletion in mtDNA or mutations in nuclear genes that cause secondary mtDNA instability. This problem challenges you to think like a clinician, using fundamental principles to justify the different molecular mechanisms and the diagnostic strategies required to distinguish them [@problem_id:5059690].", "problem": "A $32$-year-old individual presents with slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and limitation of horizontal and vertical gaze over $4$ years. Limb strength is normal except for mild proximal fatigability; cognition and sensation are intact. Serum lactate is mildly elevated at $2.8\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ (reference $<2.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). A skeletal muscle biopsy shows ragged-red fibers and a mosaic pattern of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. The clinician considers Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). To plan genetic testing, they revisit foundational principles: the Central Dogma of molecular biology states that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed to ribonucleic acid (RNA) and translated to protein, and mitochondria depend on a dual genetic system in which mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) encodes key oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) components while nuclear DNA encodes the majority of mitochondrial proteins, including those required for mtDNA replication and repair. High-energy-demand tissues (such as extraocular muscles) are sensitive to OXPHOS impairment, and the threshold effect of heteroplasmy implies that a tissue exhibits dysfunction when the fraction of defective mtDNA surpasses a tissue-specific threshold $T$ (with $T$ commonly near $60\\%$ to $90\\%$ depending on the mutation and tissue). In light of these principles, the clinician asks which reasoning best justifies how CPEO can result from both single large-scale mtDNA deletions and nuclear gene defects that cause multiple mtDNA deletions, and which diagnostic distinctions follow from that reasoning.\n\nWhich option most accurately provides the justification and proposes scientifically sound diagnostic distinctions?\n\nA. CPEO arises when extraocular muscles exceed a heteroplasmy threshold $T$ for OXPHOS failure. A single large-scale mtDNA deletion removes multiple mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes at once, producing a clonally expanded mutant population in postmitotic muscle; conversely, defects in nuclear-encoded mtDNA maintenance genes (for example, DNA polymerase gamma (*POLG*), Twinkle helicase (*TWNK*), or adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (*SLC25A4*)) cause replication/repair failure that accumulates multiple distinct mtDNA deletions over time in muscle. Diagnostic distinctions include: long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot of muscle DNA showing a solitary rearranged band (for example, a $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ deletion) in single-deletion CPEO versus multiple rearranged bands or a smear in nuclear-defect CPEO; blood DNA often lacks detectable deletions, necessitating muscle testing; inheritance tends to be sporadic for single deletions (maternal transmission is rare) but autosomal dominant or recessive for nuclear defects; and nuclear gene sequencing is prioritized when multiple deletions are demonstrated.\n\nB. CPEO is caused exclusively by point mutations in mitochondrial transfer RNA genes; single large-scale deletions and nuclear gene defects do not cause CPEO. Diagnostic distinctions hinge on serum lactate, which is always normal in nuclear gene cases and elevated only in single-deletion cases.\n\nC. Nuclear gene defects produce mtDNA depletion only (quantitative reduction) and never deletions; therefore CPEO due to nuclear genes is primarily neuropathic from defective ocular motor innervation rather than myopathic. Diagnosis should focus on nerve conduction studies and cerebrospinal fluid analysis rather than muscle DNA.\n\nD. The presence of ragged-red fibers and COX-negative fibers on muscle biopsy proves an mtDNA single-deletion etiology and effectively excludes nuclear gene causes, so further molecular testing beyond muscle mtDNA deletion detection is unnecessary. Inheritance is maternally transmitted in single-deletion CPEO and paternal in nuclear-defect CPEO.\n\nE. The two mechanisms are genetically indistinguishable; diagnosis should rely solely on clinical features of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, because molecular testing cannot differentiate single deletions from nuclear gene-related multiple deletions.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings (elevated lactate), and histopathology (ragged-red fibers, COX deficiency) are classic for a mitochondrial myopathy like CPEO. The stated principles—Central Dogma, the dual genetic control of mitochondria, the threshold effect of heteroplasmy, and tissue-specific vulnerability—are all fundamental and accurate concepts in this field. The two major genetic etiologies for CPEO (single mtDNA deletions and nuclear gene defects) are well-documented.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific clinical scenario and asks for a mechanistic explanation and its diagnostic sequelae based on provided, sound principles. A unique, correct answer can be derived from existing scientific knowledge.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical. It avoids subjective or opinion-based statements. The question asks for a scientific justification, which is an objective task.\n4.  **Flaw Analysis:**\n    -   The problem does not violate scientific principles.\n    -   It is directly relevant to the topic of mitochondrial disease.\n    -   The information provided is sufficient and consistent for a specialist to reason through the problem.\n    -   The scenario is clinically realistic.\n    -   The question is clearly structured and asks for a specific type of answer (reasoning and distinctions).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution will proceed by deriving the answer from the given principles and then evaluating each option.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core pathophysiology of CPEO, as described, is the failure of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in muscle fibers, particularly the high-energy-demand extraocular muscles. According to the provided principles, this dysfunction materializes when the burden of defective mtDNA exceeds a critical tissue-specific threshold, $T$. The question requires explaining how two distinct genetic origins can lead to this common endpoint.\n\n1.  **Common Pathological Endpoint:** Both mechanisms must result in a sufficiently high proportion of dysfunctional mitochondria within muscle cells to surpass the threshold $T$. Since mtDNA encodes essential protein subunits for the OXPHOS complexes (e.g., Complex I, III, IV, and V), damage to mtDNA is the direct cause of OXPHOS failure.\n\n2.  **Mechanism 1: Single Large-Scale mtDNA Deletion.**\n    -   **Origin:** A single mutation event occurs in an mtDNA molecule within a progenitor cell (myoblast) or a post-mitotic muscle fiber. This event typically involves the deletion of a large segment of the mtDNA, spanning several thousands of base pairs and encompassing multiple genes (e.g., those for tRNAs and OXPHOS subunits).\n    -   **Progression:** In post-mitotic tissues like skeletal muscle, this single mutated mtDNA molecule can undergo clonal expansion over years. This process leads to an accumulation of the deleted mtDNA species within the cell, eventually reaching a high level of heteroplasmy that surpasses the functional threshold $T$. The result is a cell with impaired energy production, leading to the clinical phenotype.\n    -   **Inheritance:** Because this is typically a somatic mutation event, it is most often sporadic. It is not usually inherited, and if it were to be transmitted through the germline, maternal transmission would be the mode, but this is very rare for large deletions causing CPEO.\n\n3.  **Mechanism 2: Nuclear Gene Defects leading to Multiple mtDNA Deletions.**\n    -   **Origin:** The primary genetic defect is a mutation in a nuclear gene. As stated in the principles, nDNA encodes proteins vital for mtDNA maintenance, such as DNA polymerase gamma (*POLG*), the Twinkle helicase (*TWNK*), and the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (*SLC25A4*). A defect in any of these genes impairs the fidelity and processivity of mtDNA replication and repair.\n    -   **Progression:** This impaired maintenance machinery leads to the stochastic generation and accumulation of numerous, distinct mtDNA deletions over time within post-mitotic cells. The collective burden of these varied deletions eventually causes the total level of functional mtDNA to drop below the required level, crossing the same pathological threshold $T$. This is often described as secondary mtDNA instability.\n    -   **Inheritance:** Since the primary defect is in a nuclear gene, inheritance follows Mendelian patterns. Depending on the gene and specific mutation, it can be autosomal dominant (e.g., *TWNK*, *SLC25A4*) or autosomal recessive (e.g., *POLG*).\n\n### Diagnostic Distinctions Derivation\nBased on these two distinct molecular mechanisms, specific diagnostic approaches can differentiate them.\n1.  **Molecular Analysis of Muscle DNA:** The \"gold standard\" tissue is skeletal muscle, where the mtDNA defects accumulate.\n    -   For a single large-scale deletion, molecular analysis (e.g., Southern blot, long-range PCR) will reveal the normal full-length mtDNA band and a second, single, smaller band corresponding to the clonally expanded deleted mtDNA molecule.\n    -   For a nuclear gene defect, the same analysis will show the normal mtDNA band plus multiple smaller bands of varying sizes, or even a diffuse smear below the main band, reflecting the heterogeneous population of different deletions.\n2.  **Analysis of Blood DNA:**\n    -   In sporadic single-deletion cases, the mutation is often absent or at very low, undetectable levels in blood because hematopoietic cells have rapid turnover, which can select against cells with severe respiratory chain defects.\n    -   In nuclear gene defect cases, the primary mutation is in a nuclear gene and is present in all nucleated cells, including blood. Therefore, sequencing of the causative nuclear gene can be performed on a blood sample.\n3.  **Inheritance Pattern:**\n    -   Single-deletion CPEO is typically sporadic with no family history.\n    -   Nuclear gene-driven CPEO often has a positive family history consistent with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance.\n4.  **Diagnostic Workflow:** A logical workflow would be: a) Suspect mitochondrial disease based on clinical findings. b) Perform muscle biopsy confirming myopathy with features of OXPHOS defect (ragged-red fibers, COX deficiency). c) Analyze muscle DNA for mtDNA rearrangements. d) If a single deletion is found, the diagnosis is confirmed. e) If multiple deletions are found, this points to a nuclear gene defect, and sequencing of candidate genes (*POLG*, *TWNK*, etc.) from blood DNA is the required next step.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. CPEO arises when extraocular muscles exceed a heteroplasmy threshold $T$ for OXPHOS failure. A single large-scale mtDNA deletion removes multiple mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes at once, producing a clonally expanded mutant population in postmitotic muscle; conversely, defects in nuclear-encoded mtDNA maintenance genes (for example, DNA polymerase gamma (*POLG*), Twinkle helicase (*TWNK*), or adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (*SLC25A4*)) cause replication/repair failure that accumulates multiple distinct mtDNA deletions over time in muscle. Diagnostic distinctions include: long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot of muscle DNA showing a solitary rearranged band (for example, a $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ deletion) in single-deletion CPEO versus multiple rearranged bands or a smear in nuclear-defect CPEO; blood DNA often lacks detectable deletions, necessitating muscle testing; inheritance tends to be sporadic for single deletions (maternal transmission is rare) but autosomal dominant or recessive for nuclear defects; and nuclear gene sequencing is prioritized when multiple deletions are demonstrated.**\n-   This option correctly states the threshold principle. It accurately describes the pathophysiology of both single large-scale deletions (clonal expansion) and nuclear gene defects (impaired maintenance leading to multiple deletions), correctly citing relevant genes. The proposed diagnostic distinctions regarding muscle DNA analysis (single vs. multiple bands), the necessity of muscle testing, the different inheritance patterns (sporadic vs. Mendelian), and the logical diagnostic workflow are all scientifically accurate and consistent with the derived reasoning.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. CPEO is caused exclusively by point mutations in mitochondrial transfer RNA genes; single large-scale deletions and nuclear gene defects do not cause CPEO. Diagnostic distinctions hinge on serum lactate, which is always normal in nuclear gene cases and elevated only in single-deletion cases.**\n-   The first statement is factually incorrect. While tRNA point mutations can cause CPEO (often as part of a wider syndrome), single large-scale deletions are the most common cause of isolated CPEO, and nuclear gene defects are another major cause. The exclusivity claim is false. The second statement is also incorrect; serum lactate can be normal or elevated in both types of CPEO and is not a reliable differentiator.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Nuclear gene defects produce mtDNA depletion only (quantitative reduction) and never deletions; therefore CPEO due to nuclear genes is primarily neuropathic from defective ocular motor innervation rather than myopathic. Diagnosis should focus on nerve conduction studies and cerebrospinal fluid analysis rather than muscle DNA.**\n-   The claim that nuclear gene defects \"never\" cause deletions is false. Genes like *POLG* and *TWNK* are classic examples of genes whose defects cause multiple mtDNA deletions. While other nuclear genes cause pure mtDNA depletion, this statement makes an inaccurate generalization. The claim that CPEO is primarily neuropathic is also incorrect; it is a canonical mitochondrial myopathy. Consequently, the suggested diagnostic focus is misplaced.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The presence of ragged-red fibers and COX-negative fibers on muscle biopsy proves an mtDNA single-deletion etiology and effectively excludes nuclear gene causes, so further molecular testing beyond muscle mtDNA deletion detection is unnecessary. Inheritance is maternally transmitted in single-deletion CPEO and paternal in nuclear-defect CPEO.**\n-   The premise that ragged-red and COX-negative fibers are specific to single deletions is false. These are general histological markers of mitochondrial proliferation and respiratory chain dysfunction, respectively, and are seen in mitochondrial myopathies from various genetic causes, including nuclear gene defects. The statement on inheritance is also wrong: single-deletion CPEO is typically sporadic, not maternally transmitted, and nuclear defects follow autosomal (not paternal) inheritance.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The two mechanisms are genetically indistinguishable; diagnosis should rely solely on clinical features of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, because molecular testing cannot differentiate single deletions from nuclear gene-related multiple deletions. Family history is not informative in either mechanism.**\n-   This option is incorrect on all points. The two mechanisms are clearly distinguishable with molecular methods (Southern blot/long-range PCR) on muscle DNA. Therefore, molecular testing is essential. Family history is highly informative, as a Mendelian pattern strongly suggests a nuclear gene defect, distinguishing it from the typically sporadic single-deletion cases.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5059690"}, {"introduction": "The molecular defects in mitochondrial disease have measurable consequences for whole-body physiology.

Mitochondria oxidize pyruvate at flux $O$ (in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$), and any mismatch $G - O$ is reduced to lactate, which distributes in a volume $V_d$ (in $\\mathrm{L}$) and is cleared from blood by first-order kinetics with rate constant $k$ (in $\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$).

The rate of change of the total amount of lactate, $V_d C$, is equal to the rate of its production minus the rate of its clearance.\n\nThe production rate of lactate is given as the difference between the glycolytic pyruvate flux, $G$, and the mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation flux, $O$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Production} = G - O $$\nThe clearance of lactate is described by first-order kinetics with a rate constant $k$. The clearance rate is proportional to the total amount of lactate present, $V_d C$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Clearance} = k (V_d C) $$\nThus, the differential equation for the lactate concentration $C(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d(V_d C)}{dt} = (G - O) - k V_d C $$\nSince $V_d$ is a constant volume, this simplifies to:\n$$ V_d \\frac{dC}{dt} = (G - O) - k V_d C $$\nAt steady state, the lactate concentration is constant by definition, so $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the steady-state mass balance equation:\n$$ 0 = (G - O_{ss}) - k V_d C_{ss} $$\nwhere $O_{ss}$ and $C_{ss}$ are the flux and concentration at steady state, respectively. Rearranging this equation shows that at steady state, production equals clearance:\n$$ G - O_{ss} = k V_d C_{ss} $$\nThis equation is the basis for our analysis.\n\nFirst, we analyze the baseline (healthy) condition. Let the baseline steady-state oxidation flux be $O_0$ and the baseline steady-state lactate concentration be $C_0$. The given parameters are:\n- $G = 3.05~\\mathrm{mmol/min}$\n- $k = 0.030~\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$\n- $V_d = 15.0~\\mathrm{L}$\n- $C_0 = 3.00~\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\nApplying the steady-state equation to the baseline condition:\n$$ G - O_0 = k V_d C_0 $$\nWe can solve for the unknown baseline oxidation flux, $O_0$:\n$$ O_0 = G - k V_d C_0 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ O_0 = 3.05~\\mathrm{mmol/min} - (0.030~\\mathrm{min^{-1}})(15.0~\\mathrm{L})(3.00~\\mathrm{mmol/L}) $$\n$$ O_0 = 3.05 - 1.35~\\mathrm{mmol/min} $$\n$$ O_0 = 1.70~\\mathrm{mmol/min} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the condition with impaired OXPHOS. The problem states that a $40\\%$ decrease in capacity reduces the oxidation flux $O$ to $0.60$ of its baseline value. Let the new oxidation flux be $O_{new}$.\n$$ O_{new} = (1 - 0.40) O_0 = 0.60 O_0 $$\n$$ O_{new} = 0.60 \\times (1.70~\\mathrm{mmol/min}) = 1.02~\\mathrm{mmol/min} $$\nThe problem assumes that the glycolytic flux $G$ and the clearance rate constant $k$ remain unchanged. We can now find the new steady-state lactate concentration, $C_{new}$, by applying the steady-state equation to the new condition:\n$$ G - O_{new} = k V_d C_{new} $$\nSolving for $C_{new}$:\n$$ C_{new} = \\frac{G - O_{new}}{k V_d} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ C_{new} = \\frac{(3.05 - 1.02)~\\mathrm{mmol/min}}{(0.030~\\mathrm{min^{-1}})(15.0~\\mathrm{L})} $$\n$$ C_{new} = \\frac{2.03~\\mathrm{mmol/min}}{0.45~\\mathrm{L/min}} $$\n$$ C_{new} \\approx 4.5111...~\\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n\nThe question asks for the rise in the steady-state blood lactate concentration, which is the difference $\\Delta C = C_{new} - C_0$.\n$$ \\Delta C = C_{new} - C_0 $$\n$$ \\Delta C \\approx 4.5111...~\\mathrm{mmol/L} - 3.00~\\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n$$ \\Delta C \\approx 1.5111...~\\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $1$, so we round down.\n$$ \\Delta C \\approx 1.511~\\mathrm{mmol/L} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.511}$$", "id": "5059650"}]}
