A positive log-odds score indicates that the sequence is more probable under the motif model than the background model. The score of $8.867$ is a large positive value. This implies that the probability of this sequence arising from the TF-bound motif model is $\\exp(8.867) \\approx 7100$ times greater than the probability of it arising from the random background model. Such a high likelihood ratio strongly suggests that the sequence is a good candidate for a functional binding site.\n\nFurthermore, upon inspection of the PWM, the consensus sequence (the sequence constructed from the most probable nucleotide at each position) is A at position $1$ ($0.65$), C at position $2$ ($0.60$), G at position $3$ ($0.70$), T at position $4$ ($0.65$), A at position $5$ ($0.55$), C at position $6$ ($0.50$), G at position $7$ ($0.60$), T at position $8$ ($0.55$), A at position $9$ ($0.60$), and A at position $10$ ($0.70$). The consensus sequence is therefore ACGTACGTAA, which is identical to the candidate sequence provided. This means the calculated score is the maximum possible score for this PWM. A sequence that perfectly matches the consensus motif is the strongest possible candidate for a functional site based on sequence analysis alone. While in vivo function also depends on other factors like chromatin accessibility and combinatorial interactions with other proteins, the sequence itself is an ideal match for the TF's specificity. Therefore, the site is very likely to be a functional TF binding site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.867}$$", "id": "5034599"}, {"introduction": "A binding site score is more than just a number; it has a direct biophysical meaning that determines its regulatory impact. This exercise builds on the concept of sequence scores by linking them to the thermodynamics of protein-DNA binding and, consequently, to the rate of gene transcription.

The solution requires applying concepts from biophysical chemistry and molecular biology, specifically the mass-action model for protein-DNA binding and its relationship to transcriptional regulation.\n\nFirst, we establish the model for the fractional occupancy of the transcription factor (TF) on its DNA binding site. The binding of a TF to a single site can be represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$\n\\text{TF} + \\text{DNA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{TF-DNA}\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, for this reaction is given by:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[\\text{TF}][\\text{DNA}]}{[\\text{TF-DNA}]}\n$$\nwhere $[\\text{TF}]$ is the concentration of the free transcription factor, $[\\text{DNA}]$ is the concentration of the free binding site, and $[\\text{TF-DNA}]$ is the concentration of the bound complex.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total DNA binding sites that are occupied by the TF. It can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\text{TF-DNA}]}{[\\text{DNA}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF-DNA}]}{[\\text{DNA}] + [\\text{TF-DNA}]}\n$$\nBy rearranging the $K_D$ expression to $[\\text{DNA}] = \\frac{K_D [\\text{TF-DNA}]}{[\\text{TF}]}$ and substituting into the equation for $\\theta$, or more simply by substituting $[\\text{TF-DNA}] = \\frac{[\\text{TF}][\\text{DNA}]}{K_D}$, we can derive the standard Langmuir isotherm form for fractional occupancy:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\text{TF}]}{K_D + [\\text{TF}]}\n$$\nThe problem states that the transcriptional output, which we denote as $T$, is linearly proportional to the fractional occupancy, $T \\propto \\theta$. Therefore, we can write $T = c \\cdot \\theta$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality. The fold-change in transcription rate for the mutant relative to the wild-type is then the ratio of their respective fractional occupancies:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{T_{\\text{mut}}}{T_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{mut}}}{c \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{mut}}}{\\theta_{\\text{wt}}}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the fractional occupancy for the wild-type (wt) case.

The problem states that the SNP causes a reduction in the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) score by $3$ bits. In the information-theoretic model described, a change of $1$ bit in binding affinity corresponds to a factor of $2$ change in the equilibrium association constant, $K_A$. The association constant is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant, $K_A = 1/K_D$.\n\nA reduction in the PWM score signifies weaker binding. Weaker binding corresponds to a smaller association constant ($K_A$) and a larger dissociation constant ($K_D$). A reduction of $3$ bits means the association constant is reduced by a factor of $2^3 = 8$.\n$$\nK_{A,mut} = \\frac{K_{A,wt}}{2^3} = \\frac{K_{A,wt}}{8}\n$$\nWe can express this in terms of the dissociation constant:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{K_{D,mut}} = \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot K_{D,wt}}\n$$\nTherefore, the mutant dissociation constant is $8$ times larger than the wild-type one:\n$$\nK_{D,mut} = 8 \\cdot K_{D,wt} = 8 \\cdot (5 \\text{ nM}) = 40 \\text{ nM}\n$$\n\nWith the mutant dissociation constant, we can now calculate the fractional occupancy for the mutant case, using the same free TF concentration $[\\text{TF}] = 20$ nM:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}]}{K_{D,mut} + [\\text{TF}]} = \\frac{20 \\text{ nM}}{40 \\text{ nM} + 20 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the predicted fold-change in transcription rate as the ratio of the mutant to the wild-type fractional occupancies:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{mut}}}{\\theta_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{1/3}{0.8} = \\frac{1/3}{4/5} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{12}\n$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{5}{12} \\approx 0.416666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4167$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4167}$$", "id": "5034611"}, {"introduction": "The principles of sequence recognition by regulatory machinery are not limited to transcription; they are also central to pre-mRNA splicing.
