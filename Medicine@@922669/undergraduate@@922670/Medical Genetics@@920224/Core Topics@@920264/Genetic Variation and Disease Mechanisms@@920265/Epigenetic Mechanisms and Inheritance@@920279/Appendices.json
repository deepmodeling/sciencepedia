[@problem_id:5027171]", "problem": "A core principle of genomic imprinting is that certain genes are expressed from only one parental allele due to allele-specific epigenetic marks. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is typically expressed from the paternal allele because the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) near the H19/IGF2 locus is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated, the ICR binds the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), insulating IGF2 from shared enhancers and preventing transcription; when methylated, CTCF cannot bind, enhancer access is permitted, and the allele is transcriptionally active. Loss of Imprinting (LOI) refers to a state in which this parent-of-origin-specific control is disrupted, for example by aberrant methylation of the maternal ICR, allowing biallelic expression.\n\nConsider a large population of cells in which the fraction of alleles with methylated ICR is measured by bisulfite sequencing and reported as a methylation percentage. Assume that:\n- the methylation percentage for each allele equals the probability that a randomly chosen cell has that allele in the expression-permissive state,\n- an allele in the expression-permissive state contributes a normalized transcript output of $I_{0}$, and\n- an allele in the non-permissive state contributes $0$.\n\nUnder normal imprinting in this sample, the paternal allele has a measured ICR methylation of $0.90$, and the maternal allele has a measured ICR methylation of $0.05$. After Loss of Imprinting (LOI), the paternal allele methylation is $0.88$, and the maternal allele methylation is $0.70$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of expected value from probability theory and the biological mapping between ICR methylation and IGF2 expression described above, derive the expected total IGF2 expression per cell under each condition and compute the fold-change in total expected IGF2 expression (LOI divided by normal imprinting).

No units are required.", "solution": "Genomic imprinting sets the parental origin-specific expression pattern via epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. For the H19/IGF2 locus, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, which prevents CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding and permits enhancer access to IGF2, thereby allowing transcription. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated at the ICR, allowing CTCF binding to insulate IGF2 from enhancers, which represses IGF2 transcription. Loss of Imprinting (LOI) can aberrantly methylate the maternal ICR, abolishing CTCF binding and enabling IGF2 transcription from the maternal allele, producing biallelic expression.\n\nWe map methylation percentage to expression state probabilistically as follows. Let $m_{p}$ and $m_{m}$ denote the paternal and maternal ICR methylation fractions (each in $[0,1]$). By assumption, for a randomly chosen cell:\n- the paternal allele is expression-permissive with probability $m_{p}$ and non-permissive with probability $1 - m_{p}$,\n- the maternal allele is expression-permissive with probability $m_{m}$ and non-permissive with probability $1 - m_{m}$,\n- an expression-permissive allele contributes $I_{0}$ transcripts and a non-permissive allele contributes $0$.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation (a well-tested principle in probability), the expected IGF2 expression contributed by each allele equals the probability of the expression-permissive state times the output in that state plus the probability of the non-permissive state times the output in that state.

This justification rests on the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ Protein) and the principles of epigenetic regulation.\n\n1.  **Epigenetic Silencing**: The methylation of cytosine bases in CpG dinucleotides within a gene's promoter region is a primary epigenetic mechanism for regulating gene expression. High levels of promoter methylation are strongly associated with the recruitment of protein complexes that condense chromatin, making the DNA inaccessible to the transcriptional machinery (like RNA polymerase). This process, known as transcriptional silencing, effectively turns the gene \"off,\" preventing the production of its corresponding protein.\n\n2.  **The Role of MGMT**: The *MGMT* gene encodes the $O^6$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein. This protein is a DNA repair enzyme that specifically removes alkyl adducts from the $O^6$ position of guanine residues in DNA.\n\n3.  **Mechanism of Temozolomide**: Temozolomide is an alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma. Its cytotoxic effect stems from its ability to methylate DNA, creating lesions such as $O^6$-methylguanine. These lesions are mutagenic and cytotoxic; if left unrepaired, they cause DNA strand breaks during replication, ultimately triggering cell death (apoptosis).\n\n4.  **Connecting the Model to Biology**:\n    -   In a patient with **low** *MGMT* promoter methylation (low $m$), the *MGMT* gene is transcriptionally active. The resulting MGMT protein actively repairs the DNA damage caused by temozolomide. This repair mechanism confers resistance to the therapy, leading to a poor clinical response.\n    -   In a patient with **high** *MGMT* promoter methylation (high $m$), the *MGMT* gene is silenced. The cell cannot produce the MGMT repair protein. Consequently, the DNA damage induced by temozolomide accumulates, leading to high levels of cytotoxicity and a favorable clinical response.\n\n5.  **Clinical Utility**: The logistic regression model, $\\ln(p/(1-p)) = b_0 + b_1 m$, mathematically formalizes this biological relationship. The positive coefficient $b_1 = 5.0$ confirms that a higher mean methylation fraction $m$ is associated with a higher probability of response $p$. The clinical utility of this model is significant for personalized medicine. By measuring a patient's *MGMT* promoter methylation status, clinicians can generate a quantitative prediction of their likelihood of responding to temozolomide. This allows for patient stratification:\n    -   Patients with high methylation (like the one in this problem, with a predicted response probability of $\\approx 82\\%$) can be confidently treated with temozolomide.\n    -   Patients with low methylation might be spared the toxicity of an ineffective treatment and instead be directed toward alternative therapies or clinical trials, improving outcomes and avoiding unnecessary side effects.\n\nTherefore, the model provides a powerful, biologically-grounded biomarker for guiding treatment decisions in glioblastoma.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8163}$$", "id": "5027110"}, {"introduction": "The insights gained from epigenetic data are only as reliable as the measurements themselves.
