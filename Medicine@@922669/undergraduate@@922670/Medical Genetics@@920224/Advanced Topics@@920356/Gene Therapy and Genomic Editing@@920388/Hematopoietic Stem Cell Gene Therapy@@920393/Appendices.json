Calculate the mean number of infectious units per cell, known as the Multiplicity of Infection (MOI). This value will serve as the rate parameter, $\\lambda$, for the Poisson distribution.\n3.  Use the Poisson distribution to calculate the proportion of cells with zero integration events, and subtract this from $1$ to find the proportion of cells with at least one integration event.\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of Total Infectious Units**\nThe total number of infectious units, $N_{IU}$, is the product of the vector titer, $T$, and the volume of vector preparation used, $V$.\n$$N_{IU} = T \\times V$$\nGiven $T = 1.5 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ IU/mL}$ and $V = 0.020 \\text{ mL}$:\n$$N_{IU} = (1.5 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ IU/mL}) \\times (0.020 \\text{ mL})$$\n$$N_{IU} = 3.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ IU}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)**\nThe Multiplicity of Infection, or MOI, is the average number of infectious particles per target cell. As stated in the problem, this is the rate parameter, $\\lambda$, of the Poisson distribution. It is calculated by dividing the total number of infectious units, $N_{IU}$, by the total number of cells, $N_{cells}$.\n$$\\lambda (\\text{MOI}) = \\frac{N_{IU}}{N_{cells}}$$\nGiven $N_{IU} = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$ and $N_{cells} = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{6}}{2.5 \\times 10^{6}}$$\n$$\\lambda = 1.2$$\nThe mean number of integrations per cell is $1.2$.\n\n**Step 3: Application of the Poisson Distribution**\nThe probability of a cell having exactly $k$ integration events is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\nWe are interested in the proportion of cells that acquire at least one integration, which corresponds to $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to first calculate the proportion of cells that acquire zero integrations, $P(X=0)$, and then use the complement rule.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nFor $k=0$, the Poisson formula is:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!}$$\nRecalling that any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $\\lambda^0 = 1$) and that $0! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0) = e^{-\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\lambda = 1.2$:\n$$P(X=0) = e^{-1.2}$$\nThe proportion of cells with at least one integration is therefore:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - e^{-1.2}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.3011942$$\n$$P(X \\ge 1) \\approx 0.6988058$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) \\approx 0.6988$$\nThus, the expected proportion of cells that acquire at least one genomic integration is $0.6988$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6988}$$", "id": "5043963"}, {"introduction": "Moving from prediction to practical design, this problem challenges you to determine the precise amount of viral vector needed to achieve a specific therapeutic goal.

The problem instructs to calculate this by determining the probability that a randomly chosen cell from the initial population meets all the final criteria and then multiplying this probability by the initial number of cells, $N_0$.\n\nLet's define the fractions provided in the problem statement as probabilities for a single cell to pass through each stage successfully:\n- $f_{rec,1} = 0.90$: The probability of a cell being recovered after the medium exchange and concentration step.\n- $f_{via,1} = 0.93$: The probability of a cell being viable after the transduction and washout period.\n- $f_{td} = 0.62$: The probability that a cell is transduced, conditional on it being viable after the transduction period.\n- $f_{via,2} = 0.85$: The probability of a cell being viable after cryopreservation and thaw.\n- $f_{rec,2} = 0.95$: The probability of a cell being recovered in the final formulation step.\n\nA cell is counted in the final product if and only if it successfully navigates all relevant sequential steps. The problem states that these steps are independent. Therefore, according to the multiplication rule for independent events, the overall probability, $P_{final}$, of a single starting cell becoming a viable, transduced cell in the final product is the product of the probabilities of passing each individual step.\n\nThe sequence of events for a successful cell is as follows:\n1. It must be recovered from the initial medium exchange ($f_{rec,1}$).\n2. It must remain viable after transduction ($f_{via,1}$).\n3. It must be successfully transduced ($f_{td}$).\n4. It must survive the thaw process ($f_{via,2}$).\n5. It must be recovered in the final formulation ($f_{rec,2}$).\n\nThe assumption that transduction status does not affect subsequent survival is crucial, as it allows us to multiply these probabilities in a simple chain.\n\nThe overall probability $P_{final}$ is therefore:\n$$P_{final} = f_{rec,1} \\times f_{via,1} \\times f_{td} \\times f_{via,2} \\times f_{rec,2}$$\n\nThe expected number of final cells, $N_{final}$, is the initial number of cells, $N_0$, multiplied by this overall probability:\n$$N_{final} = N_0 \\times P_{final} = N_0 \\times f_{rec,1} \\times f_{via,1} \\times f_{td} \\times f_{via,2} \\times f_{rec,2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression.\n- $N_0 = 2.40 \\times 10^{8}$\n- $f_{rec,1} = 0.90$\n- $f_{via,1} = 0.93$\n- $f_{td} = 0.62$\n- $f_{via,2} = 0.85$\n- $f_{rec,2} = 0.95$\n\n$$N_{final} = (2.40 \\times 10^{8}) \\times (0.90) \\times (0.93) \\times (0.62) \\times (0.85) \\times (0.95)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product of the probabilities:\n$$P_{final} = 0.90 \\times 0.93 \\times 0.62 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.95$$\n$$P_{final} = 0.837 \\times 0.62 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.95$$\n$$P_{final} = 0.51894 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.95$$\n$$P_{final} = 0.441099 \\times 0.95$$\n$$P_{final} = 0.41904405$$\n\nNext, we multiply this overall probability by the initial cell number:\n$$N_{final} = (2.40 \\times 10^{8}) \\times 0.41904405$$\n$$N_{final} = 100570572$$\n\nIn scientific notation, this is $1.00570572 \\times 10^{8}$.
