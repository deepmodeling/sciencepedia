Extraction of Givens:**\n-   Total packaging capacity of a single-stranded Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vector, $L_{capacity}$: $4.7$ kilobases (kb).\n-   Conversion factor: $1$ kb $= 1000$ base pairs (bp).\n-   Length of the promoter, $L_{promoter}$: $650$ bp.\n-   Length of the $5'$ untranslated region (UTR) including a Kozak sequence, $L_{UTR}$: $80$ bp.\n-   Total length of additional regulatory elements, $L_{reg}$: $500$ bp.\n-   Length of the polyadenylation signal, $L_{polyA}$: $250$ bp.\n-   The coding sequence (CDS) is assumed to have no introns.\n-   The objective is to compute the maximum allowable length of the CDS, denoted as $L_{CDS,max}$, in base pairs.\n\n**2. Validation:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of gene therapy vector design, specifically concerning the physical packaging limits of AAV vectors. The cited capacity of $4.7$ kb is the canonical value for AAV. The components of the expression cassette (promoter, UTR, CDS, regulatory elements, polyA signal) are standard genetic elements, and their specified lengths are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution via a simple arithmetic calculation. The language is objective and uses standard molecular biology terminology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation:**\nThe fundamental principle governing the design of the AAV expression cassette is that the sum of the lengths of all its constituent components must not exceed the vector's total packaging capacity. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$L_{promoter} + L_{UTR} + L_{CDS} + L_{reg} + L_{polyA} \\le L_{capacity}$$\nTo find the maximum allowable length of the coding sequence, $L_{CDS,max}$, we set the total length of the cassette equal to the packaging capacity:\n$$L_{promoter} + L_{UTR} + L_{CDS,max} + L_{reg} + L_{polyA} = L_{capacity}$$\nFirst, we must express all lengths in a consistent unit, which is base pairs (bp) as requested for the final answer. The packaging capacity is given in kilobases (kb) and must be converted.\n$$L_{capacity} = 4.7 \\text{ kb} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ bp}}{1 \\text{ kb}} = 4700 \\text{ bp}$$\nNow, we can isolate $L_{CDS,max}$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$L_{CDS,max} = L_{capacity} - (L_{promoter} + L_{UTR} + L_{reg} + L_{polyA})$$\nLet's calculate the sum of the lengths of the non-CDS components, which we can call $L_{non-CDS}$:\n$$L_{non-CDS} = L_{promoter} + L_{UTR} + L_{reg} + L_{polyA}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{non-CDS} = 650 \\text{ bp} + 80 \\text{ bp} + 500 \\text{ bp} + 250 \\text{ bp}$$\n$$L_{non-CDS} = 1480 \\text{ bp}$$\nFinally, we subtract this sum from the total packaging capacity to find the maximum length of the coding sequence:\n$$L_{CDS,max} = 4700 \\text{ bp} - 1480 \\text{ bp}$$\n$$L_{CDS,max} = 3220 \\text{ bp}$$\nTherefore, the maximum allowable length of the coding sequence that can be packaged within the AAV vector is $3220$ base pairs.

The use of ELISA to quantify total capsids and ddPCR to quantify encapsidated genomes is a standard and well-established methodology in the field of gene therapy vector production and quality control.

The use of the Poisson distribution to model rare, independent events such as viral vector integration into a host cell genome is a standard and appropriate approach in quantitative biology and virology. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of integration events per cell. According to the problem statement, $X$ follows a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter $\\lambda$, which is defined as the average number of integrations per cell (multiplicity of infection, MOI). The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable is given by:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) representing the number of events.\n\nFirst, we derive the expected number of integrations per cell, denoted as $E[X]$.
