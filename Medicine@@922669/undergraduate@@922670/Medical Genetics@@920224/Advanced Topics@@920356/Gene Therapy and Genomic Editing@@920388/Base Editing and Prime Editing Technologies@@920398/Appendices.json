These include the `CRISPR-Cas9` system, the function of the PAM (`$N\\!GG$` for `SpCas9`), the Central Dogma of molecular biology, the standard genetic code, and the concepts of silent mutations and gene editing strategies. The premise is factually correct and realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information for a unique solution.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in molecular engineering.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe goal is to find a single-nucleotide substitution within codon `$3$` (`$AGG$`) that simultaneously disrupts the `$N\\!GG$` PAM and is a silent mutation.\n\n1.  **Analyze Codon $3$ and the PAM**:\n    - The sequence of codon `$3$` is `$AGG$`.\n    - The problem states this codon serves as the `$N\\!GG$` PAM for `SpCas9`. In this case, `$N=A$`, so the PAM is `$A\\!GG$`, which is a valid `SpCas9` PAM.\n    - To disrupt the `$N\\!GG$` PAM, the sequence must be altered so that it no longer matches the `$N\\!GG$` pattern. This requires changing either the second base (`$G$`) or the third base (`$G$`) to a different nucleotide. Changing the first base (`$N$`) would not disrupt the PAM. For example, changing `$AGG$` to `$CGG$` would still result in an `$N\\!GG$` PAM (`$N=C$`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Encoded Amino Acid**:\n    - Using the standard nuclear genetic code, the codon `$AGG$` encodes the amino acid Arginine (`$Arg$`).\n    - A silent mutation requires that the new codon, after the substitution, still codes for Arginine.\n\n3.  **Identify Silent Mutations for Arginine**:\n    - The codons for Arginine (`$Arg$`) are `$CGU$`, `$CGC$`, `$CGA$`, `$CGG$`, `$AGA$`, and `$AGG$`.\n    - We are starting with `$AGG$` and need to find a single-nucleotide substitution that results in one of the other five `$Arg$` codons.\n    - Let's check the possibilities for a single-base change from `$AGG$`:\n        - Change first base (`$A$`): `$CGG$` is a single-base change (`$A \\to C$`). This codon codes for `$Arg$`, so it is a silent mutation.\n        - Change second base (`$G$`): There are no single-base changes from `$AGG$` that result in another `$Arg$` codon. For example, `$AAG$` codes for Lysine (`$Lys$`).\n        - Change third base (`$G$`): `$AGA$` is a single-base change (`$G \\to A$`). This codon codes for `$Arg$`, so it is a silent mutation.\n\n4.  **Combine the Two Criteria**:\n    - We have found two potential silent mutations: `$AGG \\to CGG$` and `$AGG \\to AGA$`.\n    - We must now check which of these also disrupts the `$N\\!GG$` PAM.\n    - **Case 1: `$AGG \\to CGG$`**. The new sequence is `$CGG$`. This sequence still conforms to the `$N\\!GG$` pattern (with `$N=C$`). Therefore, this mutation is silent but does **not** disrupt the PAM. This choice is invalid.\n    - **Case 2: `$AGG \\to AGA$`**. The new sequence is `$AGA$`. This sequence does **not** conform to the `$N\\!GG$` pattern because the third base is now `$A$`, not `$G$`. Therefore, this mutation **disrupts** the PAM.\n\nThis analysis concludes that changing the third base of codon `$3$` from `$G$` to `$A$` (converting `$AGG$` to `$AGA$`) is the only single-nucleotide substitution that is both silent and PAM-disrupting.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Change the third base of codon $3$ from G to A, converting AGG to AGA at codon $3$.**\n- **Codon change**: `$AGG \\to AGA$`.\n- **Criterion (ii) - Silent mutation**: The codon `$AGG$` codes for Arginine (`$Arg$`). The codon `$AGA$` also codes for Arginine (`$Arg$`). This is a silent mutation.\n- **Criterion (i) - PAM disruption**: The original sequence `$AGG$` is a valid `$N\\!GG$` PAM. The resulting sequence `$AGA$` is not an `$N\\!GG$` PAM because the third position is `$A$`, not `$G$`. The PAM is disrupted.\n- **Verdict**: This option satisfies both criteria. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Change the second base of codon $3$ from G to A, converting AGG to AAG at codon $3$.**\n- **Codon change**: `$AGG \\to AAG$`.\n- **Criterion (ii) - Silent mutation**: The codon `$AGG$` codes for Arginine (`$Arg$`). The codon `$AAG$` codes for Lysine (`$Lys$`). This is a missense mutation, not a silent one. Criterion (ii) is not met.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Change the third base of codon $2$ from T to C, converting TCT to TCC at codon $2$.**\n- **Codon change**: The substitution is in codon `$2$` (`$TCT \\to TCC$`).\n- **Criterion (i) - PAM disruption**: The PAM is located at codon `$3$` (`$AGG$`). A modification to codon `$2$` does not alter the sequence of codon `$3$`. Therefore, the `$N\\!GG$` PAM at codon `$3$` is not disrupted. Criterion (i) is not met.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Change the third base of codon $1$ from G to A, converting ATG to ATA at codon $1$.**\n- **Codon change**: The substitution is in codon `$1$` (`$ATG \\to ATA$`).\n- **Criterion (i) - PAM disruption**: The PAM is located at codon `$3$` (`$AGG$`). A modification to codon `$1$` does not alter the sequence of codon `$3$`. Therefore, the `$N\\!GG$` PAM at codon `$3$` is not disrupted.

The description of BE4, SpCas9, the PAM sequence, the protospacer, the R-loop, and the concept of a base editing activity window are all standard and factually correct within the field of medical genetics and molecular biology. The concept of bystander edits is a critical and realistic consideration in base editing experiments.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

There are no subjective claims or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for two pieces of information: the set of editable cytosine positions and the probability of bystander editing.\n\nFirst, we determine the set of protospacer positions expected to be editable by BE4. This requires identifying the cytosine bases that fall within the specified BE4 activity window.\nThe locations of all cytosines in the protospacer are given as the set $C = \\{4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17\\}$.\nThe BE4 activity window is defined as positions $4$ through $8$, inclusive. This corresponds to the set of positions $W = \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.\nThe set of editable cytosines, $C_{editable}$, is the intersection of these two sets:\n$$C_{editable} = C \\cap W = \\{4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17\\} \\cap \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\} = \\{4, 5, 7, 8\\}$$\nThus, the cytosines at positions $4$, $5$, $7$, and $8$ are considered editable by BE4.\n\nSecond, we compute the bystander risk. The intended edit is at position $5$. Bystander edits are defined as unintended edits that occur on other susceptible bases within the activity window. Based on our determination above, the non-target cytosines within the BE4 activity window are at positions $4$, $7$, and $8$.\nThe bystander risk is the probability that *at least one* of these non-target cytosines is edited. Let $E_{i}$ be the event that the cytosine at position $i$ is edited. We are asked to calculate $P(E_{4} \\cup E_{7} \\cup E_{8})$.\n\nThe problem states that these editing events are independent. It is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: that *none* of the bystander cytosines are edited. This event is the intersection of the complementary events $E_{4}^c$, $E_{7}^c$, and $E_{8}^c$, where $E_{i}^c$ is the event that the cytosine at position $i$ is *not* edited.\n\nThe probability of a cytosine *not* being edited at position $i$ is $P(E_{i}^c) = 1 - P(E_{i}) = 1 - p_i$.\nThe given probabilities of editing are:\n$p_{4} = 0.35$\n$p_{7} = 0.30$\n$p_{8} = 0.20$\n\nThe probabilities of *not* editing are:\n$P(E_{4}^c) = 1 - p_{4} = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$\n$P(E_{7}^c) = 1 - p_{7} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n$P(E_{8}^c) = 1 - p_{8} = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n\nSince the events are independent, the probability that none of these bystander cytosines are edited is the product of their individual non-editing probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{no bystander edits}) = P(E_{4}^c \\cap E_{7}^c \\cap E_{8}^c) = P(E_{4}^c) \\times P(E_{7}^c) \\times P(E_{8}^c)$$\n$$P(\\text{no bystander edits}) = (1 - p_{4})(1 - p_{7})(1 - p_{8})$$\n$$P(\\text{no bystander edits}) = (0.65) \\times (0.70) \\times (0.80) = 0.364$$\n\nThe probability of at least one bystander edit (the bystander risk) is $1$ minus the probability of no bystander edits:\n$$P(\\text{bystander risk}) = P(E_{4} \\cup E_{7} \\cup E_{8}) = 1 - P(\\text{no bystander edits})$$\n$$P(\\text{bystander risk}) = 1 - 0.364 = 0.636$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated probability $0.636$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we add a trailing zero.\n$$P(\\text{bystander risk}) = 0.6360$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6360}$$", "id": "5015766"}, {"introduction": "After learning to quantify bystander risk, the next step is to mitigate it through intelligent experimental design.

Within the non-target window positions $5$–$8$, the coding-strand cytidines and their local sequence contexts (on the coding strand, read $5'$ to $3'$) are: position $5$: G-C-G, position $6$ (intended target): T-C-A, position $7$: G-C-T, position $8$: C-C-A.\n\n- Guide design $2$: A different guide RNA, also complementary to the bottom (template) strand, using an upstream PAM such that the non-target coding strand is exposed and the same coding-strand target cytidine sits at non-target position $6$, but the surrounding non-target window positions now capture different neighboring cytidines with contexts: position $5$: T-C-G, position $6$ (intended target): T-C-A, position $7$: T-C-T, position $8$: T-C-C.\n\nYou must choose a guide orientation to minimize bystander edits while preserving efficient editing of the intended target.

Choose guide design $2$ (non-target equals coding strand; PAM upstream) because the target remains in a $5'$-TC-$3'$ context at position $6$, and transcription-coupled repair on the non-transcribed strand will suppress the three bystander $5'$-TC-$3'$ contexts at positions $5$, $7$, and $8$.\n\nD.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided information is consistent and sufficient to arrive at a reasoned conclusion. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Solution\n\nThe primary goal is to induce a specific $C \\rightarrow T$ transition on the coding strand while minimizing off-target edits on nearby \"bystander\" cytidines. The outcome is determined by the interplay of three main factors: $(1)$ the base editor's mechanism, $(2)$ the deaminase's sequence preference, and $(3)$ cellular DNA repair pathways.\n\n1.  **Base Editing Mechanism**: A cytosine base editor (CBE) converts cytosine (C) to uracil (U) on single-stranded DNA. This is achieved by fusing a cytidine deaminase (rAPOBEC1) to a Cas9 nuclease. The guide RNA directs the Cas9 to the target locus, where it unwinds the DNA, forming an R-loop. The non-target strand is exposed as single-stranded DNA and is accessible to the deaminase. The UGI component protects the newly formed U from being excised by the cell's base excision repair (BER) pathway. During subsequent DNA replication, the U is read as a T, completing the $C \\rightarrow T$ conversion. To edit a C on the coding strand, the coding strand must be the non-target strand, which is correctly established in both guide designs by using a guide RNA complementary to the template strand.\n\n2.  **Deaminase Sequence Preference**: The key to minimizing bystander editing is to leverage the deaminase's sequence context preference. The problem states that rAPOBEC1 has a strong preference for editing C's within a $5'$-TC-$3'$ motif and disfavors C's in $5'$-GC-$3'$ and $5'$-CC-$3'$ contexts. The editing is most likely to occur at positions $5$ through $8$ of the protospacer on the non-target strand. An ideal guide design will place the target C in the favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context while placing any bystander C's within the window in disfavored contexts.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Guide Designs**:\n    *   **Guide design $1$**: The non-target (coding) strand cytidines in the active window are evaluated based on the given rAPOBEC1 preference.\n        *   Position $5$: The context is $5'$-GCG-$3'$. The C is preceded by a G, a $5'$-GC-$3'$ context, which is disfavored. Low probability of editing.\n        *   Position $6$ (target): The context is $5'$-TCA-$3'$. The C is preceded by a T, a $5'$-TC-$3'$ context, which is strongly favored. High probability of editing.\n        *   Position $7$: The context is $5'$-GCT-$3'$. This is a disfavored $5'$-GC-$3'$ context. Low probability of editing.\n        *   Position $8$: The context is $5'$-CCA-$3'$. This is a disfavored $5'$-CC-$3'$ context. Low probability of editing.\n        *   Conclusion for Design $1$: This design is excellent. It focuses the editing activity precisely on the intended target at position $6$ by placing it in a highly favorable context, while the surrounding bystander cytidines are in unfavorable contexts, thus minimizing the risk of unwanted edits.\n\n    *   **Guide design $2$**:\n        *   Position $5$: The context is $5'$-TCG-$3'$. This is a favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context. High probability of an unwanted bystander edit.\n        *   Position $6$ (target): The context is $5'$-TCA-$3'$. This is a favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context. High probability of the desired edit.\n        *   Position $7$: The context is $5'$-TCT-$3'$. This is a favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context. High probability of an unwanted bystander edit.\n        *   Position $8$: The context is $5'$-TCC-$3'$. The C is preceded by a T, a favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context. High probability of an unwanted bystander edit.\n        *   Conclusion for Design $2$: This design is poor. While it is likely to edit the target at position $6$, it is also highly likely to edit the bystander cytidines at positions $5$, $7$, and $8$, as they are all in the favorable $5'$-TC-$3'$ context. This would result in multiple unintended mutations.\n\n4.  **Role of Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR)**: TCR is a DNA repair pathway that specifically removes lesions from the template (transcribed) strand during transcription. In this problem, the editing occurs on the coding (non-transcribed) strand for both designs. Therefore, TCR is not expected to act on the U:G mismatches created by the editor. This means the editing outcome is governed primarily by the deaminase's intrinsic activity and sequence preference, not differential repair. The information about TCR reinforces that targeting the non-transcribed strand is a robust strategy for base editing, as it avoids having the intended edit reverted by this repair pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**: Guide design $1$ is vastly superior as it exploits the deaminase's sequence bias to achieve precise editing of the target cytidine while suppressing edits at bystander positions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Choose guide design $1$ (non-target equals coding strand; PAM downstream) because only the intended target at position $6$ is in a strongly favored $5'$-TC-$3'$ context, while bystander cytidines in the window are in disfavored $5'$-GC-$3'$ or $5'$-CC-$3'$ contexts; editing on the non-transcribed coding strand also avoids transcription-coupled removal that could otherwise differentially preserve bystanders.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with the derivation above. It correctly identifies guide design $1$ as the optimal choice. It correctly states that the basis for this choice is the favorable sequence context for the target and unfavorable contexts for the bystanders. It also correctly notes that editing on the non-transcribed strand avoids TCR, which is a relevant and correct consideration in base editing design.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Choose a guide complementary to the coding strand (non-target equals template strand) to expose the template strand, relying on transcription-coupled repair on the transcribed strand to clear bystander edits; the bystander contexts then become mostly $5'$-GC-$3'$ and should be disfavored.**\n    This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, to create a $C \\rightarrow T$ change on the coding strand, the base editor must deaminate that C. This requires the coding strand to be the non-target strand. Targeting the template strand with a CBE cannot produce the desired $C_{coding}:G_{template} \\rightarrow T_{coding}:A_{template}$ edit, as a CBE cannot edit a G. Second, relying on TCR to \"clear\" bystander edits is a flawed strategy, as it would also \"clear\" the intended edit, severely reducing efficiency. Repair pathways should be avoided, not exploited in this manner.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Choose guide design $2$ (non-target equals coding strand; PAM upstream) because the target remains in a $5'$-TC-$3'$ context at position $6$, and transcription-coupled repair on the non-transcribed strand will suppress the three bystander $5'$-TC-$3'$ contexts at positions $5$, $7$, and $8$.**\n    This option makes two critical errors. First, it recommends guide design $2$, which our analysis showed would cause extensive bystander editing. Second, it invokes a fictitious mechanism, claiming that TCR acts on the \"non-transcribed strand\". The problem and established biological fact state that TCR acts on the *transcribed (template)* strand. Thus, the proposed mechanism for suppressing bystander edits is invalid.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Motif biases are negligible within positions $5-8$, so either guide design $1$ or $2$ is equivalent; the strand of transcription does not meaningfully affect bystander outcomes in base editing and should not influence orientation choice.**\n    This statement is factually incorrect. The problem explicitly states that rAPOBEC1 has a \"strong\" sequence-context bias, which is the central principle for distinguishing the two guide designs. Therefore, the designs are not equivalent. The motif bias is the most important factor in this problem. While the strand of transcription doesn't differentiate between the two given designs (as both target the non-transcribed strand), the statement that it \"does not meaningfully affect bystander outcomes\" is a false generalization, as targeting the template strand would introduce the confounding factor of TCR.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5015718"}]}
