It describes a simplified but standard model of solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The concept of stepwise coupling efficiency and its multiplicative effect on overall yield is a fundamental principle in polymer chemistry and is directly applicable here.

It specifies the final length ($20$-mer) and the starting condition (preloaded support with the first nucleotide), which unambiguously defines the number of synthesis steps required. There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The conditions are idealized, as stated in the problem (\"assume the following idealized conditions\"), which is a standard approach for pedagogical problems in chemistry and engineering. The given efficiency is high but not physically impossible.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient data to arrive at a unique numerical solution.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is not trivial; it requires a correct understanding of the synthesis process to determine the number of steps and the application of probability theory to calculate the cumulative yield.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The problem is based on verifiable chemical and mathematical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the fraction, $Y$, of oligonucleotide chains that reach the full target length of $N=20$ nucleotides.\n\nThe synthesis starts with the first nucleotide already attached to the solid support. To create a $20$-mer, $19$ additional nucleotides must be sequentially coupled to the growing chain. Therefore, the synthesis process involves a total of $N-1 = 20-1 = 19$ elongation steps.\n\nThe problem states that each of these $19$ coupling steps is an independent event, and the probability of success for any single step is the stepwise coupling efficiency, $p = 0.990$.\n\nFor a chain to reach the full length of $20$ nucleotides, all $19$ of these sequential coupling steps must be successful. The probability of a series of independent events all occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the fraction $Y$ of full-length product is the probability of the first coupling step succeeding, AND the second, AND the third, and so on, up to the $19$-th step. This can be expressed as:\n$$\nY = p \\times p \\times \\dots \\times p \\quad (19 \\text{ times})\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nY = p^{N-1}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $N=20$ and $p = 0.990$:\n$$\nY = (0.990)^{20-1} = (0.990)^{19}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nY \\approx 0.82618933\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nY \\approx 0.8262\n$$\nThis result, $Y \\approx 0.8262$, means that under these ideal conditions, approximately $82.62\\%$ of the oligonucleotide chains synthesized on the support will be the desired full-length $20$-mer. The remaining fraction, $1 - Y \\approx 0.1738$ or $17.38\\%$, will consist of various truncated sequences (failure sequences), primarily $19$-mers, $18$-mers, and so on.\n\nFor the interpretation: This calculated crude purity of approximately $82.6\\%$ indicates that a substantial fraction of the product consists of shorter, therapeutically inactive or potentially harmful impurities, necessitating stringent purification methods like HPLC to isolate the full-length oligonucleotide and achieve the high purity (typically >95%) required for therapeutic applications.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8262}$$", "id": "5011931"}, {"introduction": "For an ASO to be effective, it must bind its target mRNA with high affinity and stability under physiological conditions.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, specifically the consequence of frameshift mutations and the mechanism of action for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics aimed at exon skipping. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the lengths of the relevant exons in coding nucleotides—and a clear, formalizable rule based on modular arithmetic to determine the outcome.\n\nThe central principle guiding the solution is derived from the triplet nature of the genetic code. A sequence of coding nucleotides is translated into a sequence of amino acids in non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of $3$ will shift the translational reading frame, leading to a completely different and typically non-functional protein product downstream of the mutation. The problem formalizes this as a \"length-modulo-$3$ rule\": the reading frame is preserved if and only if the total number of removed nucleotides, $L$, is congruent to $0$ modulo $3$, written as $L \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the effect of the patient's existing deletion, which spans exons $46$ through $50$.
