It presents a standard biochemical binding model and asks for a derivation and calculation based on the provided definitions. The model is scientifically sound, and the problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fraction of occupied receptors, $f$, as a function of the free antigen concentration, $[Ag]$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$. Subsequently, we must evaluate this fraction for given values of $[Ag]$ and $K_D$.\n\nWe begin with the definitions provided:\n1.  The equilibrium dissociation constant:\n    $$K_{D}=\\frac{[R][Ag]}{[RAg]}$$\n    where $[R]$ is the concentration of unbound receptors, $[Ag]$ is the concentration of free antigen, and $[RAg]$ is the concentration of the receptor-antigen complex.\n\n2.

The fraction of occupied receptors:\n    $$f=\\frac{[RAg]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n\nOur goal is to express $f$ in terms of only $[Ag]$ and $K_D$. To achieve this, we must eliminate $[R]$, $[RAg]$, and $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ by combining the given equations.\n\nFrom the receptor conservation equation (2), we can express the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$[R] = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RAg]$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the dissociation constant (1):\n$$K_{D}=\\frac{([R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RAg])[Ag]}{[RAg]}$$\n\nTo isolate the terms that constitute $f$, we rearrange this equation algebraically. First, multiply both sides by $[RAg]$:\n$$K_{D} [RAg] = ([R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [RAg])[Ag]$$\n\nDistribute $[Ag]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$K_{D} [RAg] = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[Ag] - [RAg][Ag]$$\n\nNext, we group all terms containing $[RAg]$ on one side of the equation. We add $[RAg][Ag]$ to both sides:\n$$K_{D} [RAg] + [RAg][Ag] = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[Ag]$$\n\nFactor out $[RAg]$ on the left-hand side:\n$$[RAg](K_{D} + [Ag]) = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}[Ag]$$\n\nOur target is the expression for $f = \\frac{[RAg]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$. To obtain this ratio, we divide both sides of the equation by $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and by the term $(K_D + [Ag])$:\n$$\\frac{[RAg]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{[Ag]}{K_{D} + [Ag]}$$\n\nBy definition (3), the left-hand side is $f$. Therefore, we have derived the required expression:\n$$f = \\frac{[Ag]}{K_{D} + [Ag]}$$\nThis equation is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the fraction of a macromolecule saturated by a ligand as a function of the ligand concentration.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires evaluating $f$ for the specific values $K_{D}=10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[Ag]=10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.
