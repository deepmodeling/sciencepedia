The biological premises regarding Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), the function of the *SMN1* and *SMN2* genes, exon splicing, and the mechanism of nusinersen are consistent with established medical genetics. The mathematical model, while a simplification, is built on plausible assumptions about gene transcription and translation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the expected total SMN protein output, denoted $P$, as a function of the *SMN2* copy number $N$, the per-copy expression factor $q$, and the Percent Spliced In ($PSI$) value relative to its baseline, $PSI_0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of *SMN2* transcripts produced per unit time, $T_{total}$. The problem states that the $i$-th copy of the *SMN2* gene produces $r_0 \\cdot q^{i-1}$ transcripts, where $r_0$ is a baseline transcription rate constant and $q$ is a scaling factor. For a patient with $N$ copies of *SMN2*, the total transcript production is the sum of the contributions from each copy:\n$$T_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_0 \\cdot q^{i-1}$$\nWe can factor out the constant $r_0$:\n$$T_{total} = r_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} q^{i-1} = r_0 (q^0 + q^1 + q^2 + \\dots + q^{N-1})$$\nThis is a finite geometric series. The sum of a geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k$ is given by the formula $a\\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$, provided $r \\neq 1$. In our case, the first term is $r_0$, the common ratio is $q$, and there are $N$ terms. However, factoring out $r_0$ as we did, the summation part has a first term of $1$. So, for $q \\neq 1$, the sum is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} q^{i-1} = \\frac{1 - q^N}{1 - q}$$\nThe problem states $0 < q \\le 1$. If $q=1$, the sum is simply $N$. For the general case where $q \\neq 1$, the total transcript production is:\n$$T_{total} = r_0 \\frac{1 - q^N}{1 - q}$$\n\nNext, we determine the number of full-length (FL) messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, $M_{FL}$. According to the problem, a fraction $PSI$ of total transcripts includes exon 7 and is thus productive.\n$$M_{FL} = PSI \\cdot T_{total} = PSI \\cdot r_0 \\frac{1 - q^N}{1 - q}$$\n\nThe final step in this stage is to calculate the total protein output, $P$.

Let's apply this to our equation for $P$:\n$$P(1, q, PSI_0) = (r_0 \\eta) \\cdot PSI_0 \\cdot \\frac{1 - q^1}{1 - q} = (r_0 \\eta) \\cdot PSI_0 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the constant term:\n$$(r_0 \\eta) = \\frac{1}{PSI_0}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this back into our general expression for protein output $P(N, q, PSI)$:\n$$P(N, q, PSI) = \\left(\\frac{1}{PSI_0}\\right) \\cdot PSI \\cdot \\frac{1 - q^N}{1 - q}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the relative increase in splicing:\n$$P(N, q, PSI) = \\frac{PSI}{PSI_0} \\cdot \\frac{1 - q^N}{1 - q}$$\nThis is the general formula for the expected SMN protein output as a function of $N$, $q$, and the ratio of $PSI$ to $PSI_0$.\n\nWith the general formula derived, we can compute the specific value for the patient described in the problem.

Substituting these values into the expression for $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{0.58}{0.10} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (0.85)^3}{1 - 0.85}$$\nFirst, we calculate the terms separately. The ratio of $PSI$ values is:\n$$\\frac{0.58}{0.10} = 5.8$$\nNext, we evaluate the term involving $q$:\n$$(0.85)^3 = 0.85 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.85 = 0.614125$$\nThe numerator of the fractional term is:\n$$1 - (0.85)^3 = 1 - 0.614125 = 0.385875$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\nSo, the entire fractional term involving $q$ is:\n$$\\frac{0.385875}{0.15} = 2.5725$$\nFinally, we multiply the two parts to find the total protein output:\n$$P = 5.8 \\times 2.5725 = 14.9205$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
