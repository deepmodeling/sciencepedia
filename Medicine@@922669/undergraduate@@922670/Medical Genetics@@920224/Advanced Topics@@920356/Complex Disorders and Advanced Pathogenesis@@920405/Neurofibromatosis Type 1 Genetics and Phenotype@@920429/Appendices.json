The roles of Ras, GAPs (like neurofibromin), and GEFs in the cell signaling cycle are accurately described. The link between NF1 gene mutation, reduced neurofibromin function, and altered Ras activity is a cornerstone of understanding the pathophysiology of Neurofibromatosis type 1. The use of a simplified kinetic model to analyze this system is a standard and valid approach in systems biology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, simplified kinetic model with all necessary parameters (initial rate constants and the specific perturbation) to calculate the requested quantity (the fraction of active Ras at steady-state). The objective is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements. All conditions are stated quantitatively.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or ambiguities that would prevent a rigorous solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a two-state system for Ras, cycling between a GDP-bound state and a GTP-bound state. We can represent this system as:\n$$\n\\text{Ras-GDP} \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\text{Ras-GTP}\n$$\nLet $[\\text{Ras-GDP}]$ and $[\\text{Ras-GTP}]$ denote the concentrations of the two states of Ras. The total concentration of Ras, $[\\text{Ras}]_{\\text{total}}$, is constant:\n$$\n[\\text{Ras}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{Ras-GDP}] + [\\text{Ras-GTP}]\n$$\nThe reactions are treated as pseudo-first-order. The rate of the forward reaction (activation) is $v_{\\text{fwd}} = k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}[\\text{Ras-GDP}]$, and the rate of the reverse reaction (inactivation/hydrolysis) is $v_{\\text{rev}} = k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}[\\text{Ras-GTP}]$.\n\nThe problem requires a steady-state analysis. At steady-state, the concentrations of $[\\text{Ras-GDP}]$ and $[\\text{Ras-GTP}]$ are constant. This implies that the rate of formation of Ras-GTP must equal the rate of its consumption, which is the \"steady-state flux balance\" condition.\n$$\nv_{\\text{fwd}} = v_{\\text{rev}}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{GEF}}[\\text{Ras-GDP}] = k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}[\\text{Ras-GTP}]\n$$\nWe need to find the fraction, $f$, of Ras in the active, GTP-bound state:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[\\text{Ras-GTP}]}{[\\text{Ras}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\text{Ras-GTP}]}{[\\text{Ras-GDP}] + [\\text{Ras-GTP}]}\n$$\nFrom the steady-state equation, we can express $[\\text{Ras-GDP}]$ in terms of $[\\text{Ras-GTP}]$:\n$$\n[\\text{Ras-GDP}] = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}[\\text{Ras-GTP}]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[\\text{Ras-GTP}]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}[\\text{Ras-GTP}]\\right) + [\\text{Ras-GTP}]}\n$$\nWe can cancel $[\\text{Ras-GTP}]$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{GAP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}} + 1}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}$ gives a simplified form:\n$$\nf = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}{k_{\\mathrm{GAP}} + k_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}\n$$\nThis general formula relates the fraction of active Ras to the effective rate constants for activation and inactivation.\n\nNow, we must apply the conditions for the NF1 heterozygous scenario. Let the new rate constants be denoted by $k'_{\\mathrm{GEF}}$ and $k'_{\\mathrm{GAP}}$.\nThe GEF activity remains unchanged, so the rate constant for activation is the same as in the wild-type cell:\n$$\nk'_{\\mathrm{GEF}} = k_{\\mathrm{GEF, wt}} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe GAP-mediated hydrolysis rate is reduced by $50\\%$. This means the new rate constant for inactivation is $50\\%$ of the wild-type value:\n$$\nk'_{\\mathrm{GAP}} = (1 - 0.50) \\times k_{\\mathrm{GAP, wt}} = 0.50 \\times 0.24\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the fraction $f$ for the NF1 heterozygous scenario using these new rate constants:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{NF1}} = \\frac{k'_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}{k'_{\\mathrm{GAP}} + k'_{\\mathrm{GEF}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{NF1}} = \\frac{0.06\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.06\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.18}\n$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless fraction.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{NF1}} = \\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{NF1}} = 0.333333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{NF1}} = 0.3333\n$$\nThis result is biologically consistent: a reduction in GAP activity, which inactivates Ras, leads to a higher steady-state fraction of active Ras-GTP compared to the wild-type case (where $f_{wt} = \\frac{0.06}{0.24+0.06} = \\frac{0.06}{0.30} = 0.2$). The fraction increases from $0.20$ to $0.3333$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3333}\n$$", "id": "5065605"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the molecular mechanism to family-level implications, this practice places you in a realistic genetic counseling scenario.
