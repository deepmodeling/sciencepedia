Digenic inheritance is a well-established model in medical genetics. The assumptions are standard for introductory genetics problems.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary information: the inheritance pattern, the parental genotypes, the specific genotype-phenotype map (penetrance), and the assumptions of unlinked loci and independent assortment. The objective is to calculate a specific probability.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Flaw Analysis**:\n    - **Incompleteness/Contradiction**: The problem is self-contained. A potential point of confusion is the phrase \"recurrence risk to siblings of an affected proband.\" In cases where parental genotypes are unknown, the existence of an affected child (proband) provides information to infer them. However, in this problem, the parental genotypes are explicitly given as $Aa\\,Bb$. The assumption \"sibling genotypes are independent conditional on parental genotypes\" makes the status of the proband irrelevant to the calculation for a subsequent sibling. Thus, the problem is not underspecified or ill-posed; it correctly tests the understanding of conditional independence in this context.\n    - **Other Flaws**: The problem does not violate any other criteria for validity. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, unrealistic, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the probability that a child is affected, given that the parents both have the genotype $Aa\\,Bb$. The problem defines this as the recurrence risk. Let $S$ denote the event that a sibling is affected.\n\nAn individual is affected ($Y=1$) if and only if their genotype is $aa\\,bb$. Therefore, the probability of being affected is equal to the probability of having the genotype $aa\\,bb$.\n$$P(S) = P(Y=1) = P(\\text{genotype is } aa\\,bb)$$\nThe parental cross is $Aa\\,Bb \\times Aa\\,Bb$. The problem states that the two loci, $A$ and $B$, are unlinked. According to Mendel's law of independent assortment, the inheritance of alleles at locus $A$ is independent of the inheritance of alleles at locus $B$. This allows us to calculate the probability for each locus separately and then multiply the results.\n\nFirst, consider the cross for locus $A$: $Aa \\times Aa$.\nAccording to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent transmits either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each. The probability of an offspring inheriting the genotype $aa$ is the product of the probabilities of inheriting an $a$ allele from each parent:\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } aa) = P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2})$$\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } aa) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSecond, consider the cross for locus $B$: $Bb \\times Bb$.\nSimilarly, each parent transmits either the $B$ allele or the $b$ allele with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each. The probability of an offspring inheriting the genotype $bb$ is:\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } bb) = P(b \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(b \\text{ from parent 2})$$\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } bb) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSince the loci are unlinked and assort independently, the probability of an offspring having the combined genotype $aa\\,bb$ is the product of the probabilities of having the genotype $aa$ and the genotype $bb$:\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } aa\\,bb) = P(\\text{genotype is } aa) \\times P(\\text{genotype is } bb)$$\n$$P(\\text{genotype is } aa\\,bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThe penetrance function states $P(Y=1 \\mid \\text{genotype } aa\\,bb) = 1$. Therefore, the probability of a child being affected is:\n$$P(Y=1) = P(Y=1 \\mid \\text{genotype } aa\\,bb) \\times P(\\text{genotype is } aa\\,bb)$$\n$$P(Y=1) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the recurrence risk, which is the probability that a subsequent sibling is affected, given that there is an already affected child (the proband). Let $A_p$ be the event that the proband is affected, and $A_s$ be the event that the sibling is affected. We are asked to compute $P(A_s \\mid A_p)$. By definition:\n$$P(A_s \\mid A_p) = \\frac{P(A_s \\cap A_p)}{P(A_p)}$$\nThe problem explicitly states that \"sibling genotypes are independent conditional on parental genotypes.\" Since the parental genotypes are known ($Aa\\,Bb$), the genotypes of any two siblings are independent events. Consequently, the events of them being affected are also independent.\n$$P(A_s \\cap A_p) = P(A_s) \\times P(A_p)$$\nSubstituting this into the conditional probability formula:\n$$P(A_s \\mid A_p) = \\frac{P(A_s) \\times P(A_p)}{P(A_p)} = P(A_s)$$\nThis confirms that the information about the proband does not alter the probability for the sibling, because the underlying stochastic process (meiosis in the known parents) is unchanged. The recurrence risk is therefore simply the a priori probability that any child of these parents will be affected.\n\nThe calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.

Assume Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) holds at each locus and there is independence between loci due to the absence of linkage.

The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe population prevalence of a genetic disease is defined as the frequency of affected individuals in the population. According to the problem statement, the disease has a recessive-recessive digenic inheritance pattern with full penetrance. This means an individual is affected if and only if they are homozygous for the risk allele at both loci, i.e., their genotype is $aa$ at locus $A$ and $bb$ at locus $B$.\n\nThe prevalence is therefore equal to the frequency of the combined genotype $aa\\,bb$ in the population. We can denote this frequency as $f(aa, bb)$.\n\nThe problem states that the loci $A$ and $B$ are unlinked. In a large, randomly mating population, unlinked loci assort independently. This principle of independence implies that the frequency of a combined genotype across multiple loci is the product of the genotype frequencies at each individual locus. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$f(aa, bb) = f(aa) \\times f(bb)$$\nwhere $f(aa)$ is the frequency of the $aa$ genotype at locus $A$, and $f(bb)$ is the frequency of the $bb$ genotype at locus $B$.\n\nThe problem also specifies that Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) holds at each locus. Under HWE, the frequencies of genotypes are determined by the frequencies of the alleles in the population.\nAt locus $A$, the frequency of the risk allele $a$ is given as $p_A$. The frequency of the homozygous genotype $aa$ is the square of the allele's frequency:\n$$f(aa) = p_A^2$$\nSimilarly, at locus $B$, the frequency of the risk allele $b$ is given as $p_B$. The frequency of the homozygous genotype $bb$ is:\n$$f(bb) = p_B^2$$\nBy substituting these HWE-derived genotype frequencies back into the equation for the combined genotype frequency, we obtain the general formula for the disease prevalence:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = f(aa, bb) = f(aa) \\times f(bb) = p_A^2 \\times p_B^2 = (p_A p_B)^2$$\nThis formula represents the expected population prevalence of the disease as a function of the risk allele frequencies $p_A$ and $p_B$.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate this prevalence numerically using the provided values: $p_A = 0.018$ and $p_B = 0.027$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = (0.018)^2 \\times (0.027)^2$$\nFirst, we calculate the square of each allele frequency:\n$$(0.018)^2 = 0.000324$$\n$$(0.027)^2 = 0.000729$$\nNext, we multiply these results to find the prevalence:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = 0.000324 \\times 0.000729$$\nExecuting this multiplication yields:\n$$\\text{Prevalence} = 0.000000236196$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures.
