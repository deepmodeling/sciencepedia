The researcher performs four assays at defined early and late time points to capture different biochemical features of apoptosis: (i) a membrane asymmetry assay using Annexin V together with Propidium Iodide (PI); (ii) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate Nick End Labeling (TUNEL); (iii) a protease activity assay using a caspase substrate reporter tuned to caspase-$3$ and caspase-$7$; and (iv) a mitochondrial membrane potential assay using the cationic dye JC-$1$ or Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE).\n\nStarting from the following core facts: (a) apoptosis is defined by activation of cysteine-aspartate proteases (caspases), regulated changes in plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry (including exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet), internucleosomal DNA fragmentation that generates accessible $3'$-hydroxyl ends, and loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ as part of intrinsic pathway signaling; (b) Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine in a $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent manner, while Propidium Iodide enters cells with compromised plasma membrane integrity; (c) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase adds labeled nucleotides to free $3'$-hydroxyl ends regardless of their origin; (d) caspase substrate reporters are cleaved at consensus peptide motifs by active caspases but can exhibit overlap in specificity; and (e) cationic dyes accumulate in polarized mitochondria according to the electrochemical gradient and redistribute upon depolarization,\n\nselect the single best option that accurately enumerates what each assay detects during apoptosis and contrasts at least one specific limitation of each assay that affects interpretation across apoptosis, necrosis, and non-apoptotic physiology.\n\nA. Annexin V with Propidium Iodide distinguishes early apoptosis (Annexin V positive, PI negative) from late apoptosis or secondary necrosis (Annexin V positive, PI positive), but cannot, at a single endpoint, unambiguously separate primary necrosis from late apoptosis without a time course; Annexin V binding requires extracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. TUNEL labels $3'$-hydroxyl DNA ends generated by endonucleolytic cleavage, but also labels ends produced during DNA repair, making false positives possible; it does not report early apoptotic changes before DNA fragmentation. Caspase-$3/7$ reporters measure proteolytic activity downstream of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, but signal can arise from non-apoptotic caspase roles and may be absent in caspase-independent cell death; substrate motifs can be cleaved by multiple caspases.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective question rooted in the principles of medical genetics and cell biology. It accurately describes a common experimental scenario and provides a set of correct foundational facts (labeled a through e) for evaluating the efficacy and limitations of four standard apoptosis assays. The task is to select the option that correctly describes what each assay measures and identifies key limitations.\n\nA principle-based derivation of the function and limitations of each assay is as follows:\n\n1.  **Membrane Asymmetry Assay: Annexin V with Propidium Iodide (PI)**\n    -   **Principle**: A core tenet of early apoptosis is the loss of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry. Specifically, the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS), normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is translocated to the outer leaflet. Annexin V is a protein that has a high affinity for PS, but this binding is strictly dependent on the presence of calcium ions ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$), as stated in fact (b). Thus, fluorescently labeled Annexin V can be used to detect PS exposure on the cell surface. Propidium Iodide (PI) is a fluorescent DNA intercalating agent that is membrane-impermeable. It can only enter cells that have lost their plasma membrane integrity, a characteristic of late-stage apoptosis (termed secondary necrosis) and primary necrosis.\n    -   **Interpretation**:\n        -   Annexin V-negative / PI-negative cells are live and healthy.\n        -   Annexin V-positive / PI-negative cells are in early apoptosis, with exposed PS but an intact membrane.\n        -   Annexin V-positive / PI-positive cells are in late apoptosis, secondary necrosis, or primary necrosis. They have exposed PS and a compromised membrane.\n    -   **Limitations**: The primary limitation is the ambiguity of the double-positive (Annexin V-positive / PI-positive) population at a single time point. It is impossible to distinguish a cell that underwent apoptosis and subsequently lost membrane integrity from a cell that underwent primary necrosis (which also involves membrane rupture and may expose PS). A time-course analysis is required to resolve this ambiguity, as apoptotic cells would transition from Annexin V-positive / PI-negative to Annexin V-positive / PI-positive. The assay's dependence on extracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is a crucial experimental requirement.\n\n2.  **Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)**\n    -   **Principle**: A hallmark of apoptosis is the activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD), an endonuclease that cleaves the genomic DNA in the linker regions between nucleosomes. This process generates a large number of DNA fragments with free $3'$-hydroxyl ($3'$-OH) ends, as mentioned in fact (a). The TUNEL assay utilizes the enzyme Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which, as stated in fact (c), adds labeled deoxyuridine triphosphates (dUTPs) to these free $3'$-OH ends, allowing for their detection.\n    -   **Limitations**: The main limitation, derived directly from fact (c), is the lack of specificity of TdT for apoptosis-induced DNA breaks. TdT will label *any* free $3'$-OH end, regardless of its origin. Therefore, DNA strand breaks generated during DNA repair processes or extensive DNA damage from necrotic cell death can also be labeled, leading to potential false positives. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation is a relatively late event in the apoptotic cascade, so the TUNEL assay is not a marker for early apoptosis.\n\n3.  **Protease Activity Assay for Caspase-$3$ and Caspase-$7$**\n    -   **Principle**: Apoptosis is executed by a family of cysteine-aspartate proteases called caspases. Caspase-$3$ and caspase-$7$ are the primary executioner caspases, activated by both the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) pathways. Their activation is a central event in apoptosis, as per fact (a). These assays use a synthetic peptide substrate containing a specific recognition sequence (e.g., DEVD for caspase-$3$/$7$) linked to a reporter (e.g., a fluorophore). Cleavage of the substrate by active caspases releases the reporter, generating a measurable signal.\n    -   **Limitations**: As noted in fact (d), specificity can be an issue. While DEVD is a preferred substrate for caspase-$3$ and -$7$, other proteases might cleave it, albeit less efficiently. Caspases also have known non-apoptotic roles in processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, which could lead to a signal in non-dying cells. Conversely, some forms of programmed cell death are caspase-independent (e.g., necroptosis), and would not be detected by this assay. Because caspase-$3$/$7$ are common downstream effectors, this assay does not, by itself, distinguish between the intrinsic and extrinsic initiation pathways.\n\n4.  **Mitochondrial Membrane Potential ($\\Delta \\Psi_m$) Assay using JC-$1$ or TMRE**\n    -   **Principle**: A high mitochondrial inner membrane potential ($\\Delta \\Psi_m$) is maintained in healthy, respiring cells. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis involves mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which leads to the dissipation of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$. Fact (e) states that cationic dyes like JC-$1$ and TMRE accumulate in the negatively charged matrix of polarized mitochondria.\n        -   With **JC-$1$**, high $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ causes the dye to form aggregates that fluoresce red-orange. Upon depolarization, the dye disperses into the cytoplasm as monomers that fluoresce green. A shift from red to green fluorescence indicates loss of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$.\n        -   With **TMRE**, the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to its accumulation and thus to $\\Delta \\Psi_m$. A decrease in fluorescence signifies depolarization.\n    -   **Limitations**: The loss of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ is not exclusive to apoptosis. Necrosis also involves a catastrophic loss of cellular homeostasis, including mitochondrial function and potential. Furthermore, chemical mitochondrial uncouplers or general metabolic dysfunction can cause depolarization without initiating apoptosis. Some cancer cells express multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps that can actively export these dyes, which would mimic a loss of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ and confound interpretation.\n\nHaving established these principles, each option can be evaluated.\n\n**A. Annexin V with Propidium Iodide distinguishes early apoptosis (Annexin V positive, PI negative) from late apoptosis or secondary necrosis (Annexin V positive, PI positive), but cannot, at a single endpoint, unambiguously separate primary necrosis from late apoptosis without a time course; Annexin V binding requires extracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. TUNEL labels $3'$-hydroxyl DNA ends generated by endonucleolytic cleavage, but also labels ends produced during DNA repair, making false positives possible; it does not report early apoptotic changes before DNA fragmentation. Caspase-$3/7$ reporters measure proteolytic activity downstream of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, but signal can arise from non-apoptotic caspase roles and may be absent in caspase-independent cell death; substrate motifs can be cleaved by multiple caspases. JC-$1$ or TMRE report loss of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ typical of intrinsic apoptosis, yet depolarization also occurs in necrosis, metabolic uncoupling, and in cells with active efflux transporters, so dye behavior can confound interpretation.**\n-   This option provides a completely accurate description of all four assays and their respective key limitations, consistent with the principles derived above and the provided facts (a-e). Each statement is factually correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. TUNEL specifically measures caspase activity and is not affected by DNA repair processes; Annexin V does not require $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and, with PI, cleanly distinguishes apoptosis from necrosis at any single time point; caspase-$3/7$ substrates are perfectly specific for apoptosis and never engage in non-apoptotic signaling; JC-$1$ and TMRE exclusively indicate apoptosis and are unaffected by necrosis or mitochondrial uncoupling.**\n-   This option contains multiple factual errors. TUNEL measures DNA fragmentation, not caspase activity directly. It is affected by DNA repair. Annexin V binding explicitly requires $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ (fact b). Caspase substrates are not perfectly specific (fact d), and caspases have non-apoptotic roles. Loss of $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ is not exclusive to apoptosis.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Annexin V positivity indicates necrosis only, while PI negativity indicates early apoptosis; TUNEL detects early apoptotic signaling before any DNA strand breaks form; caspase activity reporters cannot detect extrinsic pathway activation; JC-$1$ and TMRE primarily measure reactive oxygen species rather than $\\Delta \\Psi_m$, making them unsuitable for apoptosis assessment.**\n-   This option is filled with inaccuracies. Annexin V positivity is a hallmark of apoptosis. PI negativity alone does not indicate early apoptosis (live cells are also PI negative). TUNEL detects the breaks themselves, a later event. Caspase-$3/7$ reporters detect a convergence point for both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. JC-$1$ and TMRE are potentiometric dyes that measure $\\Delta \\Psi_m$, not reactive oxygen species.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Annexin V with PI can unambiguously separate intrinsic from extrinsic apoptosis at a single endpoint; TUNEL only labels double-strand breaks created during replication stress and is not triggered by endonucleases; caspase-$3/7$ reporters are unaffected by off-target proteases; JC-$1$ signal is independent of mitochondrial membrane potential and instead reflects mitochondrial mass.**\n-   This option is factually incorrect on all points. Annexin V/PI provides no information about the initiating pathway (intrinsic vs. extrinsic). TUNEL primarily detects apoptosis-induced fragmentation by endonucleases, not just replication stress breaks. Caspase reporters can have off-target effects (fact d). JC-$1$ signal is directly dependent on $\\Delta \\Psi_m$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Annexin V requires extracellular $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ rather than $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, and in combination with PI can distinguish apoptosis from necrosis without time dependence; TUNEL avoids false positives from DNA repair because Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase does not act on $3'$-hydroxyl ends produced by repair; caspase-$3/7$ reporters uniquely identify intrinsic apoptosis and are silent in extrinsic apoptosis; JC-$1$ and TMRE can discriminate intrinsic from extrinsic apoptosis based solely on dye accumulation patterns.**\n-   This option is entirely false. Annexin V requires $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, not $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ (fact b). It cannot unambiguously distinguish apoptosis from necrosis at a single time point. TUNEL is prone to false positives from DNA repair because TdT acts on any $3'$-OH end (fact c). Caspase-$3/7$ are activated by both pathways. $\\Delta \\Psi_m$ loss is characteristic of the intrinsic pathway but can also be a secondary consequence of the extrinsic pathway and does not on its own discriminate the two.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, Option A is the only choice that accurately and comprehensively describes the function and critical limitations of all four assays as requested by the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5012332"}, {"introduction": "After surveying the landscape of apoptosis assays, it's time to zoom in on the practical details that determine an experiment's success.

The biochemical basis to consider is that phosphatidylserine (PS) is normally confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent aminophospholipid flippases, and is externalized when caspase-regulated scramblases are activated in apoptosis. Annexin V binds PS in a calcium ion ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$)-dependent manner. In early necrosis, loss of membrane integrity exposes inner-leaflet lipids and allows extracellular proteins to access intracellular compartments. It is also known that Annexin V exhibits lower-affinity binding to other anionic phospholipids (for example, phosphatidylglycerol) in the presence of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. The researcher is considering several protocol changes.\n\nFor decision making, assume the following experimentally established dissociation constants under standard buffer with $2.5$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$: Annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine has dissociation constant $K_d^{\\text{PS}} \\approx 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$, and Annexin V binding to phosphatidylglycerol has dissociation constant $K_d^{\\text{PG}} \\approx 500$ $\\mathrm{nM}$. The standard staining concentration for Annexin V is $[A] = 100$ $\\mathrm{nM}$. No other numerical shortcuts are provided; reasoning should start from foundational definitions and well-tested biochemical facts.\n\nWhich of the following experimental conditions would be expected to increase the rate of false-positive Annexin V-FITC staining when the goal is to specifically identify early apoptosis (and not early necrosis)?

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cell biology and biochemistry, specifically the mechanisms of apoptosis and the function of the Annexin V assay. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to derive a\nlogical solution.\n\nThe central task is to identify experimental conditions that increase the rate of false-positive staining for early apoptosis. A \"true positive\" is an early apoptotic cell, which is characterized by an intact plasma membrane and the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS). A \"false positive,\" in the context of this problem, is a non-apoptotic cell that is incorrectly identified as apoptotic. The problem specifies that the primary concern is the false labeling of early necrotic cells. Early necrotic cells are defined by a loss of plasma membrane integrity, which makes the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, rich in PS, accessible to the extracellular Annexin V probe. Therefore, any condition that either (1) causes non-apoptotic cells to be stained with Annexin V or (2) prevents the distinction between truly apoptotic cells and necrotic cells will increase the rate of false positives.\n\nWe will analyze each proposed experimental condition based on these principles.\n\n**A. Staining cells in a buffer containing $2.5$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$ without including any membrane-impermeant viability dye (for example, Propidium Iodide (PI) or 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD)) to exclude membrane-compromised cells.**\n\nA viability dye such as Propidium Iodide (PI) is a fluorescent molecule that cannot cross the intact plasma membrane of live or early apoptotic cells. However, it can readily enter cells with compromised membrane integrity, such as necrotic or late apoptotic cells, where it intercalates with DNA and fluoresces strongly. In a standard flow cytometry assay for apoptosis, cells are co-stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI. This allows for the differentiation of cell populations:\n-   Live cells: Annexin V-negative and PI-negative.\n-   Early apoptotic cells: Annexin V-positive and PI-negative (the target population).\n-   Late apoptotic/necrotic cells: Annexin V-positive and PI-positive.\n\nEarly necrotic cells, due to their compromised membranes, will allow entry of both Annexin V (which then binds to the now-accessible inner leaflet PS) and PI. If a viability dye like PI is omitted from the protocol, the analysis cannot distinguish between cells that are Annexin V-positive/PI-negative (early apoptotic) and those that would have been Annexin V-positive/PI-positive (necrotic). Both populations would simply be measured as Annexin V-positive. This directly leads to the inclusion of necrotic cells in the count of \"apoptotic\" cells, thereby increasing the rate of false positives.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Adding $1$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the staining buffer to minimize nonspecific interactions by chelating divalent cations.**\n\nThe problem states that Annexin V binding to PS is dependent on calcium ions ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$). EDTA is a potent chelating agent that strongly binds and sequesters divalent cations, including $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. Adding $1$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ EDTA to the staining buffer, which contains $2.5$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$, would significantly reduce the concentration of free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. In the absence of sufficient free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, Annexin V cannot adopt the conformation required to bind PS. Consequently, all Annexin V binding, both to the externalized PS on apoptotic cells and to the accessible PS in necrotic cells, would be inhibited or completely abolished. This would lead to a dramatic decrease in all staining, resulting in false negatives (failure to detect true apoptosis), not an increase in false positives.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Increasing Annexin V-FITC concentration to $[A] = 1.0$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ in the presence of $2.5$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.**\n\nThe specificity of a ligand-receptor interaction is often dependent on the ligand concentration relative to the dissociation constants ($K_d$) for its various binding partners. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a binding site is given by the formula $\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}$, where $[A]$ is the free concentration of Annexin V.\n\nAt the standard concentration, $[A] = 100$ $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n-   Occupancy of PS ($K_d^{\\text{PS}} = 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $\\theta_{\\text{PS}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 50} \\approx 0.67$.\n-   Occupancy of PG ($K_d^{\\text{PG}} = 500$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $\\theta_{\\text{PG}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 500} \\approx 0.17$.\nAt this concentration, the binding to PS is significantly favored over the lower-affinity binding to other anionic phospholipids like PG.\n\nAt the increased concentration, $[A] = 1.0$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ = $1000$ $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n-   Occupancy of PS ($K_d^{\\text{PS}} = 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $\\theta_{\\text{PS}} = \\frac{1000}{1000 + 50} \\approx 0.95$.\n-   Occupancy of PG ($K_d^{\\text{PG}} = 500$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $\\theta_{\\text{PG}} = \\frac{1000}{1000 + 500} \\approx 0.67$.\n\nWhile the occupancy of PS increases from $67\\%$ to $95\\%$ (a factor of $\\approx 1.4$), the occupancy of the lower-affinity site PG increases from $17\\%$ to $67\\%$ (a factor of $\\approx 4$). This disproportionate increase in binding to lower-affinity sites reduces the specificity of the assay. The high concentration of Annexin V will cause significant labeling of any exposed anionic phospholipid, not just PS. This non-specific binding can occur on the surface of healthy cells and will be particularly pronounced in necrotic cells where the entire inner membrane surface is exposed. This increased non-specific signal enhances the fluorescence of non-apoptotic cells, increasing the likelihood that they are misclassified as positive, thus increasing the false-positive rate.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Harvesting adherent cells by mechanical scraping immediately before staining, with no recovery period, in the presence of $2.5$ $\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.**\n\nHarvesting adherent cells is a critical step. Mechanical scraping is a physically harsh method that is known to cause damage to cell membranes, leading to a loss of integrity. This iatrogenic damage mimics the phenotype of necrosis: the plasma membrane becomes permeable. When these mechanically damaged cells are stained with Annexin V, the probe can pass through the ruptured membrane and bind to the PS on the inner leaflet. These cells are not biologically apoptotic; they are artifacts of the harvesting procedure. Since they will stain positive for Annexin V, they represent a significant source of false positives. Staining immediately with no recovery period ensures that these damaged cells are included in the analysis before they can potentially repair their membranes or be cleared from the suspension.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Performing staining on ice at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to suppress scramblase activity and maintain membrane asymmetry during processing.**\n\nBiological processes, including enzymatic reactions, are highly sensitive to temperature. The externalization of PS in apoptosis is an active process mediated by enzymes called scramblases. Placing cells on ice and performing the staining at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ drastically reduces the rate of enzymatic activity. This is a standard and recommended practice in many cell-based assays. Its purpose is to \"fix\" the cells in the state they were in at the time of harvesting, preventing further progression of apoptosis or other cellular changes during the staining procedure (which can take $15$-$30$ minutes). By inhibiting scramblase activity, this condition prevents artifactual PS exposure that might occur during sample handling. It helps to preserve membrane integrity and asymmetry, thereby *reducing* artifacts and potential false positives. It would not be expected to increase the false-positive rate.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "5012369"}, {"introduction": "The hallmarks of apoptosis that we measure experimentally are the downstream consequences of a tightly regulated molecular decision.

This is a competitive binding scenario.\n\nFor a generic anti-apoptotic protein, $P$ (which can be either BCL-2 or MCL-1), its total concentration is the sum of its free form and its complexed forms:\n$$[P]_{\\text{tot}} = [P]_{\\text{free}} + [P:\\text{BAX}] + [P:\\text{BH3}]$$\n\nThe equilibrium relationships are given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P} = \\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{[P:\\text{BAX}]}$$\n$$K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P} = \\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{[P:\\text{BH}3]}$$\n\nFrom these, we can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free concentrations:\n$$[P:\\text{BAX}] = \\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}}$$\n$$[P:\\text{BH}3] = \\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation for $P$:\n$$[P]_{\\text{tot}} = [P]_{\\text{free}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P}}\\right)$$\n\nThis allows us to express the fraction of $P$ that is bound to BAX:\n$$\\frac{[P:\\text{BAX}]}{[P]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{\\frac{[P]_{\\text{free}}[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}}}{[P]_{\\text{free}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P}}}$$\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the BAX-protein complex is:\n$$[P:\\text{BAX}] = [P]_{\\text{tot}} \\frac{\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX}:P}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH}3:P}}}$$\n\nThe problem states to assume that the free concentrations of the ligands (BAX and BH3) are well-approximated by their total concentrations. This simplifying assumption is made to calculate the occupancy of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Thus, we use $[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}} \\approx [\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}$ and $[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{free}} \\approx [\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{tot}}$ in the expression above.\n\nWe now calculate the concentration of BAX sequestered by each anti-apoptotic protein.\n\nFor BCL-2:\nThe relevant parameters are $[\\text{BCL-2}]_{\\text{tot}} = 50$, $[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}} = 500$, $[\\text{BH3}]_{\\text{tot}} = 200$, $K_{D, \\text{BAX:BCL-2}} = 2$, and $K_{D, \\text{BH3:BCL-2}} = 10$.\n\nThe dimensionless ratios are:\n$$\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:BCL-2}}} = \\frac{500}{2} = 250$$\n$$\\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH3:BCL-2}}} = \\frac{200}{10} = 20$$\n\nThe concentration of the BAX:BCL-2 complex is:\n$$[\\text{BAX}:\\text{BCL-2}] = [\\text{BCL-2}]_{\\text{tot}} \\frac{\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:BCL-2}}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:BCL-2}}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH3:BCL-2}}}}$$\n$$[\\text{BAX}:\\text{BCL-2}] = 50 \\left(\\frac{250}{1 + 250 + 20}\\right) = 50 \\left(\\frac{250}{271}\\right) = \\frac{12500}{271}$$\n\nFor MCL-1:\nThe relevant parameters are $[\\text{MCL-1}]_{\\text{tot}} = 30$, $[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}} = 500$, $[\\text{BH3}]_{\\text{tot}} = 200$, $K_{D, \\text{BAX:MCL-1}} = 1$, and $K_{D, \\text{BH3:MCL-1}} = 5$.\n\nThe dimensionless ratios are:\n$$\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:MCL-1}}} = \\frac{500}{1} = 500$$\n$$\\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH3:MCL-1}}} = \\frac{200}{5} = 40$$\n\nThe concentration of the BAX:MCL-1 complex is:\n$$[\\text{BAX}:\\text{MCL-1}] = [\\text{MCL-1}]_{\\text{tot}} \\frac{\\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:MCL-1}}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BAX:MCL-1}}} + \\frac{[\\text{BH}3]_{\\text{tot}}}{K_{D, \\text{BH3:MCL-1}}}}$$\n$$[\\text{BAX}:\\text{MCL-1}] = 30 \\left(\\frac{500}{1 + 500 + 40}\\right) = 30 \\left(\\frac{500}{541}\\right) = \\frac{15000}{541}$$\n\nThe total concentration of sequestered BAX is the sum of BAX bound to BCL-2 and BAX bound to MCL-1:\n$$[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{sequestered}} = [\\text{BAX}:\\text{BCL-2}] + [\\text{BAX}:\\text{MCL-1}]$$\n$$[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{sequestered}} = \\frac{12500}{271} + \\frac{15000}{541}$$\nNumerically, $[\\text{BAX}:\\text{BCL-2}] \\approx 46.12546\\,\\text{nM}$ and $[\\text{BAX}:\\text{MCL-1}] \\approx 27.72643\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{sequestered}} \\approx 46.12546 + 27.72643 = 73.85189\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\nThe concentration of free BAX is the total concentration minus the sequestered concentration:\n$$[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}} = [\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}} - [\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{sequestered}}$$\n$$[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}} \\approx 500 - 73.85189 = 426.14811\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\nFinally, the fraction of BAX that is free is:\n$$f_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{free}}}{[\\text{BAX}]_{\\text{tot}}}$$\n$$f_{\\text{free}} \\approx \\frac{426.14811}{500} = 0.85229622$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.8523$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.8523} $$", "id": "5012374"}]}
