The study produced a $2 \\times 2$ cross-classification with the following counts: among ankylosing spondylitis cases, $a=120$ had HLA-B27 present and $b=60$ had HLA-B27 absent; among controls without the disease, $c=30$ had HLA-B27 present and $d=270$ had HLA-B27 absent.

It provides all necessary data from a case-control study to assess the association between the HLA-B27 allele and ankylosing spondylitis. The analysis requires the calculation of an odds ratio ($OR$), its natural logarithm, and a $95\\%$ confidence interval using the standard Woolf method, followed by a clinical interpretation. The problem is scientifically grounded, as the link between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis is a cornerstone of immunogenetics.\n\nThe data can be summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n\n|             | Disease (Cases) | No Disease (Controls) |\n|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| HLA-B27 (+) | $a=120$         | $c=30$                |\n| HLA-B27 (-) | $b=60$          | $d=270$               |\n\nFirst, we compute the odds ratio ($OR$). In a case-control study, the $OR$ is the ratio of the odds of exposure (presence of HLA-B27) among the cases to the odds of exposure among the controls.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is the ratio of exposed to unexposed cases:\n$$ O_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{120}{60} = 2 $$\nThe odds of exposure among controls is the ratio of exposed to unexposed controls:\n$$ O_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{30}{270} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ OR = \\frac{O_{\\text{cases}}}{O_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ OR = \\frac{120 \\times 270}{60 \\times 30} = \\frac{32400}{1800} = 18 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the odds ratio is $18.00$.\n\nNext, we compute the natural logarithm of the odds ratio, $\\ln(OR)$:\n$$ \\ln(OR) = \\ln(18) \\approx 2.8903747... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $2.890$.\n\nTo calculate the $95\\%$ confidence interval ($CI$) for the $OR$, we use the Woolf method, which is based on the large-sample normal approximation for the distribution of $\\ln(OR)$.

Individuals who carry the HLA-B27 allele have $18$ times the odds of having ankylosing spondylitis compared to those who do not carry the allele. The $95\\%$ confidence interval, $[11.05, 29.33]$, does not include the null value of $1.0$, which confirms that this association is statistically significant at the $p  0.05$ level. The narrowness of the interval relative to the magnitude of the effect suggests a precise estimate.\n\nFor risk stratification, the HLA-B27 allele is a major genetic risk factor for ankylosing spondylitis. Its presence significantly increases an individual's predisposition to the disease.\n\nIn terms of diagnostic utility, HLA-B27 testing can be a valuable component in the diagnostic workup for patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (e.g., inflammatory back pain). A positive test result in such a patient substantially increases the post-test probability of disease. However, it is important to note that HLA-B27 testing is not a standalone diagnostic test. As indicated by the control group data ($30$ out of $300$ controls, or $10\\%$, possessed the allele), the allele is present in a notable fraction of the general population without the disease. Therefore, its positive predictive value is low when used as a screening tool in the general asymptomatic population.

It provides sufficient information to calculate the key quantity of interest—the penetrance $P(D \\mid G)$—using fundamental principles of probability, namely Bayes' theorem.

All terms are defined quantitatively, and the question asks for an interpretation based on calculation, not subjective opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a realistic, well-posed, and scientifically grounded problem in quantitative medical genetics. The solution will proceed by calculating the penetrance and evaluating the given options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the penetrance of the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele for narcolepsy type $1$. As defined, penetrance is the conditional probability $P(D \\mid G)$. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$ P(D \\mid G) = \\frac{P(G \\mid D) P(D)}{P(G)} $$\n\nWe are given $P(G \\mid D) = 0.95$ and $P(D) = 3 \\times 10^{-4}$. We must first calculate the overall probability of carrying the genotype, $P(G)$, in the specified population. We use the law of total probability:\n\n$$ P(G) = P(G \\mid D)P(D) + P(G \\mid \\text{not } D)P(\\text{not } D) $$\n\nWe are given $P(G \\mid \\text{not } D) = 0.25$. The probability of not having the disease is $P(\\text{not } D) = 1 - P(D)$.\n$$ P(\\text{not } D) = 1 - 3 \\times 10^{-4} = 1 - 0.0003 = 0.9997 $$\n\nNow, substitute the values into the equation for $P(G)$:\n$$ P(G) = (0.95)(3 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.25)(0.9997) $$\n$$ P(G) = 0.000285 + 0.249925 $$\n$$ P(G) = 0.25021 $$\n\nSo, the prevalence of the HLA-DQB1*06:02 genotype in the general population is approximately $25.02\\%$.\n\nNow we can calculate the penetrance, $P(D \\mid G)$:\n$$ P(D \\mid G) = \\frac{P(G \\mid D) P(D)}{P(G)} = \\frac{(0.95)(3 \\times 10^{-4})}{0.25021} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid G) = \\frac{2.85 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.25021} \\approx 0.001139 $$\n\nThe calculated penetrance is approximately $0.00114$, or about $0.114\\%$. This is the absolute risk for an individual who carries the HLA-DQB1*06:02 genotype. While this risk is significantly higher than the baseline population risk of $3 \\times 10^{-4}$ (or $0.03\\%$), it is a very low absolute risk. A \"highly penetrant\" gene would imply a risk approaching $1$ (or $100\\%$). The value $0.114\\%$ clearly indicates low penetrance. The allele confers susceptibility (it increases risk) but is not determinative.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because $95\\%$ of cases carry HLA-DQB1*06:02, the genotype has high penetrance; more than $50\\%$ of carriers will develop narcolepsy type $1$, so the allele is effectively determinative rather than merely susceptibility-conferring.**\nThis statement incorrectly equates $P(G \\mid D)$ (the probability of genotype given disease, which is $0.95$) with $P(D \\mid G)$ (the penetrance). Our calculation shows the penetrance is $\\approx 0.114\\%$, which is far less than the claimed $ 50\\%$. Therefore, the genotype does not have high penetrance and is not \"effectively determinative\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. HLA-DQB1*06:02 reflects susceptibility, not high penetrance: most patients with narcolepsy type $1$ carry the allele, but the absolute risk for a carrier remains on the order of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (about $0.1\\%$) in this population, because the disease is rare and the allele is relatively common.**\nThis statement correctly distinguishes susceptibility from high penetrance. It correctly states that most patients carry the allele ($P(G \\mid D)=0.95$). It correctly identifies the absolute risk for a carrier, $P(D \\mid G)$, as being on the order of $10^{-3}$ or $0.1\\%$, which matches our calculation of $0.00114$. It also provides the correct reasoning: the low absolute risk for carriers is a consequence of the disease being very rare ($P(D)$ is small) and the susceptibility allele being relatively common in the general population ($P(G)$ is large). This combination, via Bayes' theorem, results in a small posterior probability $P(D \\mid G)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The allele has no meaningful association with narcolepsy type $1$; the risk for carriers is essentially the population prevalence of about $0.03\\%$, indicating no susceptibility effect.**\nThis statement is false. The allele has a very strong association with the disease. The risk for a carrier is $P(D \\mid G) \\approx 0.114\\%$, which is approximately $3.8$ times the population prevalence of $P(D) = 0.03\\%$. An almost four-fold increase in risk is a very significant susceptibility effect. The relative risk is substantial.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Penetrance and susceptibility are equivalent for HLA markers; since $95\\%$ of cases carry the allele, approximately $95\\%$ of carriers will develop narcolepsy type $1$, which means the allele is both necessary and sufficient for disease.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, penetrance ($P(D \\mid G)$) and susceptibility are not equivalent concepts. A low-penetrance allele can still be a major susceptibility factor. Second, it repeats the logical fallacy of equating $P(G \\mid D)$ with $P(D \\mid G)$. Third, it incorrectly concludes the allele is necessary and sufficient. It is not sufficient because penetrance is very low. It is not strictly necessary because $5\\%$ of cases do not carry the allele ($P(G \\mid D) = 0.95$, not $1.0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5046869"}]}
