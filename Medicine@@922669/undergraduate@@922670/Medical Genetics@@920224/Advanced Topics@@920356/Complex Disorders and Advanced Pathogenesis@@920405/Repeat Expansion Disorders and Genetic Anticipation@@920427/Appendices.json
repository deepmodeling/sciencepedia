Genetic anticipation refers to the observation that expansions of unstable repeats tend to increase across generations, leading to earlier and often more severe disease onset. Empirically, above a critical repeat length, the disease manifests and the expected age of onset declines with further expansion. A cohort study used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping to measure repeat counts and clinical records to estimate group mean ages of onset. Assume the expected age of onset, denoted by $E[\\text{onset}]$, is modeled as a reciprocal shift:\n$$E[\\text{onset}]=a+\\frac{b}{r-c},$$\nwhere $r$ is the repeat count, $a$ is a baseline minimum expected onset age (years), $b$ is a positive scaling constant (years), and $c$ is an unknown effective threshold repeat count (dimensionless) indicating the location of the vertical asymptote of the model.\n\nThree non-overlapping genotype groups yielded the following mean values (reporting ages in years):\n- Group $1$: repeat count $r_1=35$, mean onset $t_1=58$.\n- Group $2$: repeat count $r_2=50$, mean onset $t_2=22$.\n- Group $3$: repeat count $r_3=70$, mean onset $t_3=16$.\n\nAssuming the model holds exactly for these group means (negligible measurement noise at this scale), fit the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ analytically from first principles by solving the system implied by the three data points. Then, interpret $c$ in biological terms as an effective threshold for pathological repeat length within this modeling framework.\n\nReport only the fitted value of the threshold parameter $c$.

The provided data points, which relate the mean repeat count $r$ to the mean age of onset $t$, are $(r_1, t_1) = (35, 58)$, $(r_2, t_2) = (50, 22)$, and $(r_3, t_3) = (70, 16)$. We assume the model holds exactly for these points.\n\nFirst, we establish the system of three equations by substituting the data into the model equation $t = a + \\frac{b}{r-c}$:\n$$58 = a + \\frac{b}{35-c} \\quad (1)$$\n$$22 = a + \\frac{b}{50-c} \\quad (2)$$\n$$16 = a + \\frac{b}{70-c} \\quad (3)$$\n\nTo solve this non-linear system, we can first eliminate the parameter $a$ by subtracting the equations from one another.\n\nSubtracting equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$58 - 22 = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{35-c}\\right) - \\left(a + \\frac{b}{50-c}\\right)$$\n$$36 = \\frac{b}{35-c} - \\frac{b}{50-c}$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{1}{35-c} - \\frac{1}{50-c} \\right)$$\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{(50-c) - (35-c)}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right)$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{50 - c - 35 + c}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right)$$\n$$36 = b \\left( \\frac{15}{(35-c)(50-c)} \\right) \\quad (4)$$\n\nNext, we subtract equation $(3)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$22 - 16 = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{50-c}\\right) - \\left(a + \\frac{b}{70-c}\\right)$$\n$$6 = \\frac{b}{50-c} - \\frac{b}{70-c}$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{1}{50-c} - \\frac{1}{70-c} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{(70-c) - (50-c)}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{70 - c - 50 + c}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right)$$\n$$6 = b \\left( \\frac{20}{(50-c)(70-c)} \\right) \\quad (5)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations, $(4)$ and $(5)$, with two unknowns, $b$ and $c$. We can eliminate $b$ to find $c$. We solve for $b$ in both equations, assuming $b \\neq 0$.\nFrom equation $(4)$:\n$$b = \\frac{36}{15} (35-c)(50-c) = \\frac{12}{5} (35-c)(50-c)$$\nFrom equation $(5)$:\n$$b = \\frac{6}{20} (50-c)(70-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (50-c)(70-c)$$\n\nSetting the two expressions for $b$ equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{12}{5} (35-c)(50-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (50-c)(70-c)$$\n\nThe repeat counts are distinct, so $c$ cannot be equal to $35$, $50$, or $70$, as this would lead to division by zero in the original equations. Therefore, $(50-c) \\neq 0$, and we can divide both sides by this term:\n$$\\frac{12}{5} (35-c) = \\frac{3}{10} (70-c)$$\n\nTo solve for $c$, we can first clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by $10$:\n$$10 \\cdot \\frac{12}{5} (35-c) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} (70-c)$$\n$$2 \\cdot 12 (35-c) = 3 (70-c)$$\n$$24 (35-c) = 3 (70-c)$$\n\nDivide both sides by $3$:\n$$8 (35-c) = 70-c$$\n\nNow, expand and solve for $c$:\n$$8 \\cdot 35 - 8c = 70 - c$$\n$$280 - 8c = 70 - c$$\n$$280 - 70 = 8c - c$$\n$$210 = 7c$$\n$$c = \\frac{210}{7}$$\n$$c = 30$$\n\nThe fitted value for the threshold parameter $c$ is $30$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of $c$. In the model $E[\\text{onset}] = a + \\frac{b}{r-c}$, the term $\\frac{b}{r-c}$ represents the deviation from the baseline minimum age of onset $a$. The parameter $c$ is the value of the repeat count $r$ at which the denominator $r-c$ becomes zero, causing a vertical asymptote. As $r$ approaches $c$ from above (i.e., for repeat counts just over the threshold), the expected age of onset approaches infinity. Biologically, this means that for repeat counts at or below the threshold $c$, the disease is not expected to manifest within a normal human lifespan. Thus, $c$ represents the effective threshold repeat count for pathogenicity in this model. Repeat counts greater than $c$ are associated with a finite age of onset that decreases as $r$ increases. The value $c=30$ is biologically plausible, as it falls within the range often considered for the boundary between normal and premutation alleles for Huntington disease.\n\nThe question asks only for the value of $c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "5078316"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to clinical practice requires a deep understanding of diagnostic techniques and their limitations.

Repeat Expansion Biology: Unstable repeats may exhibit somatic mosaicism and genetic anticipation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement will now be validated against the required criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of medical genetics, specifically the diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and is caused by an expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the $5'$ untranslated region of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 ($\\textit{FMR1}$) gene on the X chromosome. The allele sizes provided ($30$, $90$, and $200$–$800$ repeats) correspond perfectly to the known clinical categories: normal ($<45$ repeats), premutation ($55$–$200$ repeats), and full mutation ($\\ge 200$ repeats). The described discordance between PCR and Southern blot results is a classic and well-documented diagnostic challenge due to PCR amplification failure over large, GC-rich repeats. The concepts of somatic mosaicism, partial methylation in females, and genetic anticipation are all central to the pathophysiology of this disorder. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a set of seemingly contradictory data and asks for a plan to reconcile them and formulate a report. This is a well-defined task. The provided data and guiding principles contain all the necessary information to deduce a single, coherent explanation. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n\n-   **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, quantitative, and objective clinical and laboratory terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n-   **Conclusion of Validation:** The problem statement is valid. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It presents a realistic and complex diagnostic scenario that requires the integration of technical knowledge and biological principles.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to reconcile the results from two different assays and outline a correct laboratory and reporting plan.\n\n1.  **Analysis of PCR Results:** The PCR assay detected two alleles of approximately $30$ and $90$ CGG repeats. Since the patient is female, she has two X chromosomes. A $30$-repeat allele is in the normal size range. A $90$-repeat allele is in the premutation size range. This result, by itself, would classify her as a carrier of a premutation allele for Fragile X syndrome.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Southern Blot Results:** The Southern blot detected two distinct patterns.\n    -   An unmethylated, discrete band corresponding to approximately $90$ CGG repeats. This result is concordant with the larger allele detected by PCR. The unmethylated status is expected for premutation alleles.\n    -   A broad, partially methylated smear corresponding to alleles ranging from approximately $200$ to $800$ CGG repeats. This finding is crucial. The size range ($\\ge 200$ repeats) is characteristic of a full mutation. The \"smear\" indicates size heterogeneity, which is the hallmark of somatic mosaicism (the repeat is unstable and has different lengths in different cells). The \"partially methylated\" status is expected in a female with a full mutation, reflecting random X-chromosome inactivation; cells where the X with the full mutation is active will have an unmethylated promoter, while cells where it is inactive will have a methylated promoter.\n\n3.  **Reconciliation of Discordant Results:** The discordance lies in the fact that the full mutation smear ($200$–$800$ repeats) seen on the Southern blot was not detected by the flanking PCR assay. This is explained by a known technical limitation of PCR, which is explicitly mentioned in the guiding principles: standard PCR using primers that flank the repeat region often fails to amplify very large, GC-rich repeat tracts. The polymerase cannot efficiently synthesize across hundreds of CGG repeats. Therefore, the PCR only amplified the smaller alleles present in the sample: the normal allele (~$30$ repeats) from one X chromosome and the premutation allele (~$90$ repeats) from a subpopulation of cells corresponding to the other X chromosome.\n\n4.  **Integrated Diagnosis:** The most logical and scientifically sound conclusion is that the patient has three populations of alleles:\n    -   One normal allele (~$30$ repeats) on one X chromosome.\n    -   A mosaic pattern on the other X chromosome, consisting of a premutation allele (~$90$ repeats) and a full mutation allele (smear from $200$–$800$ repeats).\n\n    This diagnosis of a female with a normal allele and a mosaic premutation/full mutation allele accounts for all observations from both assays.\n\n5.  **Formulation of a Plan:** A sound laboratory plan would first confirm the integrity of the initial steps (e.g., sample identity). Then, it would employ a third, confirmatory technology designed to overcome the limitations of the first assay. Repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) is an assay specifically designed to detect the presence of large repeat expansions that are missed by flanking PCR, providing qualitative evidence of a full mutation. Repeating the Southern blot confirms the size and methylation pattern. The final report must integrate all these findings to provide a complete and accurate clinical picture, including the diagnosis of mosaicism, the implications for the patient's phenotype (which can be variable due to X-inactivation patterns and the degree of mosaicism), and the significant reproductive risks, including the high probability of having a son with Fragile X syndrome due to anticipation (expansion of the repeat from the premutation/full mutation range during transmission).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Verify sample identity and patient sex, re-extract DNA to exclude degradation, and reflex to repeat-primed PCR to detect a signature of large expansions that may fail flanking PCR.

Reconcile the findings as mosaicism for a full mutation ($\\geq 200$ CGG repeats) coexisting with a premutation allele (approximately $90$ CGG repeats) on one X chromosome and a normal allele (approximately $30$ CGG repeats) on the other X chromosome.

It outlines standard quality control steps (verifying sample identity), proposes the correct reflex test (RP-PCR), provides the correct interpretation of the data (mosaicism of premutation and full mutation on one X, a normal allele on the other), and describes a model clinical report that is accurate, explanatory, and provides essential counseling information. This plan properly reconciles all the data based on the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Prioritize PCR because it provides precise repeat counts; report a premutation carrier based on the $90$ CGG repeat allele and disregard the Southern smear as a probable technical artifact, with no additional testing or comments on methylation, mosaicism, or anticipation.**\n\nThis option commits a major diagnostic error. It wrongly prioritizes the assay known to fail for large expansions and dismisses the Southern blot finding, which is pathognomonic for a full mutation. This would lead to a misdiagnosis with serious clinical consequences, as the patient's risk of having an affected child is much higher than that of a simple premutation carrier.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prioritize Southern blot because it detects large expansions; report a full mutation without mentioning the $90$ CGG PCR allele or the possibility of mosaicism, and do not perform any reflex testing or discuss reproductive risk or anticipation.**\n\nThis option is also flawed. While it correctly identifies the full mutation, it ignores the evidence for mosaicism (the $90$-repeat allele detected by both PCR and Southern) and fails to create an integrated report. An incomplete diagnosis of \"full mutation\" without acknowledging the mosaicism is inaccurate. The failure to discuss reproductive risk or anticipation is a serious omission in a clinical genetics report.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Increase PCR cycle number to force amplification of the large allele; if no larger band appears, conclude the patient is normal because two alleles are visible by PCR, and remove the Southern blot from consideration as non-specific smearing.**\n\nThis reflects a misunderstanding of PCR limitations. Increasing cycle numbers does not overcome the fundamental problem of amplifying extremely long, stable secondary structures like GC-rich repeats. Concluding the patient is \"normal\" is factually wrong (a $90$-repeat allele is a premutation), and dismissing the clear Southern blot evidence is unjustifiable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for FMR1 copy number; if two hybridization signals are present per cell, report a normal genotype and ignore both the PCR and Southern results as non-diagnostic for repeat expansions.**\n\nThis proposes using an irrelevant test. FISH for gene copy number tells nothing about the repeat expansion within the gene, which is the mechanism of Fragile X syndrome. A female is expected to have two copies of the $\\textit{FMR1}$ gene. This test would be uninformative for the question at hand, and ignoring the highly relevant PCR and Southern data would be grossly negligent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5078339"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate application of our genetic knowledge is to provide patients with accurate information for decision-making, especially concerning reproductive risk.

All necessary data are provided, and the question is formulated unambiguously.\n\nThe objective is to compute the residual probability that the male child will be affected with Fragile X syndrome, given the pregnant individual's negative carrier test result.

Using the law of total probability, we can expand this as:\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = P(A | C, T^{-}) P(C | T^{-}) + P(A | C^c, T^{-}) P(C^c | T^{-})$$\nAn affected child requires the mother to be a carrier. Therefore, if the mother is not a carrier ($C^c$), the child cannot be affected. This means $P(A | C^c, T^{-}) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$P(A | T^{-}) = P(A | C, T^{-}) P(C | T^{-})$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds in two main steps:\n1.  Calculate the posterior probability that the individual is a carrier, given the negative test result, $P(C | T^{-})$.\n2.  Calculate the probability that the child is affected, given the mother is a carrier, $P(A | C, T^{-})$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $P(C | T^{-})$**\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | C) P(C)}{P(T^{-})}$$\nWe need to find the terms $P(T^{-} | C)$ and $P(T^{-})$.\n\nFirst, let's find $P(T^{-} | C)$, the probability of a negative test given the individual is a carrier.

These are biologically independent processes. Therefore, the test result provides no new information about transmission to the child once we already know the mother is a carrier. This means we can assume conditional independence:\n$$P(A | C, T^{-}) = P(A | C)$$\nThe probability $P(A | C)$ is the probability that a carrier mother has an affected male child.

The premutation allele expands to a full mutation during oogenesis (probability = $E = 0.20$).\n3.
