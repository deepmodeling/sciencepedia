It is scientifically grounded in the principles of endocrinology and medical genetics, specifically concerning the diagnosis of disorders of sex development. The givens are self-contained, consistent, and well-defined, constituting a well-posed problem. The language is objective and the scenario is clinically realistic. I will therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis based on the provided data and assumptions. First, we must determine if the patient's post-hCG hormone profile meets the diagnostic criterion for steroid $5\\alpha$-reductase type $2$ (SRD5A2) deficiency. Second, we must estimate the patient's residual SRD5A2 enzyme activity relative to the median activity of a control population.\n\nLet $T$ represent the serum testosterone concentration and $DHT$ represent the serum dihydrotestosterone concentration.

We calculate the patient's post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{T}{DHT}\\right)_{post, pt} = \\frac{T_{post, pt}}{DHT_{post, pt}} = \\frac{540 \\text{ ng/dL}}{19 \\text{ ng/dL}} = \\frac{540}{19} $$\n$$ \\frac{540}{19} \\approx 28.42 $$\nSince $28.42 > 20$, the patient's results meet the specified diagnostic criterion for SRD5A2 deficiency.\n\nNext, we estimate the residual SRD5A2 enzyme activity. The problem states that \"the instantaneous rate of product formation is, to first order, proportional to enzyme activity and to the available substrate concentration.\" The reaction is the conversion of testosterone (substrate) to DHT (product), catalyzed by the $5\\alpha$-reductase enzyme.\nLet $R_{DHT}$ be the rate of DHT formation, $A$ be the SRD5A2 enzyme activity, and $[T]$ be the testosterone concentration. The relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ R_{DHT} \\propto A \\cdot [T] $$\n$$ R_{DHT} = k_{form} \\cdot A \\cdot [T] $$\nwhere $k_{form}$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nUnder the assumption of \"stable clearance,\" we can model the system at a pseudo-steady state where the rate of formation of DHT is balanced by its rate of clearance. Assuming first-order clearance, the rate of clearance is proportional to the DHT concentration, $[DHT]$:\n$$ R_{clear} = k_{clear} \\cdot [DHT] $$\nAt pseudo-steady state, $R_{DHT} = R_{clear}$:\n$$ k_{form} \\cdot A \\cdot [T] = k_{clear} \\cdot [DHT] $$\nRearranging this equation, we find the relationship between the hormone ratio and enzyme activity:\n$$ \\frac{[DHT]}{[T]} = \\frac{k_{form}}{k_{clear}} \\cdot A $$\nThis shows that the ratio of DHT to testosterone is directly proportional to the SRD5A2 enzyme activity, $A$. Let $K = \\frac{k_{form}}{k_{clear}}$ be the overall proportionality constant.\n$$ \\frac{[DHT]}{[T]} = K \\cdot A $$\n\nWe can apply this relationship to both the patient ($pt$) and the control median ($control$) using their post-hCG values:\nFor the patient:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt} = K \\cdot A_{pt} $$\nFor the control median:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, control} = K \\cdot A_{control} $$\n\nThe desired quantity is the patient's residual activity relative to the control median, which is the ratio $\\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}}$. We can find this by dividing the two equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt}}{\\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, control}} = \\frac{K \\cdot A_{pt}}{K \\cdot A_{control}} = \\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}} $$\n\nLet $A_{rel} = \\frac{A_{pt}}{A_{control}}$ be the relative residual activity. We now substitute the given values into this expression.\nThe patient's post-hCG DHT-to-testosterone ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{DHT}{T}\\right)_{post, pt} = \\frac{19}{540} $$\nThe control's median post-hCG testosterone-to-DHT ratio is given as $10$.

The exercise challenges you to calculate recurrence risk under different maternal genetic scenarios and, importantly, to correctly apply the principle that somatic X-inactivation (Lyonization) does not influence the probability of germline transmission [@problem_id:5039068].", "problem": "A couple is evaluated for recurrence risk of a disorder of sex development caused by a pathogenic variant in the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene. The AR gene is located on the X chromosome, and pathogenic variants that cause loss of function lead to Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), which manifests clinically in 46,XY individuals with hemizygous pathogenic AR variants. For this problem, define an “affected offspring” as a live-born 46,XY child who expresses AIS due to the pathogenic AR variant.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- Under X-linked inheritance, a 46,XY child inherits his single X chromosome from his mother and the Y chromosome from his father.\n- Standard Mendelian segregation implies that, absent selection, a heterozygous mother transmits the variant allele to offspring with probability $1/2$.\n- Assume the probability of a live-born child being 46,XY is $1/2$, prenatal selection is negligible, and the father is 46,XY with a wild-type AR allele and is not mosaic.\n- In 46,XY hemizygotes for the pathogenic AR variant, clinical expression (penetrance) is $p=0.97$.\n- X-inactivation (Lyonization) occurs in female somatic cells and does not bias which X-linked allele is transmitted in oocytes because the X chromosomes are reactivated during oogenesis before meiosis.\n\nEvaluate the risk that the next child born to this couple will be an affected offspring under each of the following maternal states:\n1.

The probability that the child is chromosomally male, $P(46,XY)$.\n2. The probability that the child inherits the pathogenic AR allele from the mother, $P(\\text{Transmit})$. This probability depends on the mother's genetic status.\n3. The probability that a 46,XY individual with the pathogenic allele will clinically express the disorder (penetrance), denoted as $p$.\n\nThe general formula for the risk is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{Affected Offspring}) = P(46,XY) \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The probability of a live-born child being 46,XY is $P(46,XY) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The penetrance of AIS in 46,XY hemizygotes is $p = 0.97$.\n- The father is 46,XY with a wild-type AR allele, so he cannot transmit the pathogenic variant.

A critical piece of information provided is that somatic X-inactivation patterns, whether random or skewed, do not bias the segregation of alleles in the germline. This is due to the reactivation of the X chromosomes during oogenesis prior to meiosis. Therefore, any data on somatic X-inactivation are irrelevant to calculating the recurrence risk.\n\n**1. Mother is $46,XX$ heterozygous, random somatic X-inactivation ($s=0.50$).**\nThe mother is heterozygous for the pathogenic AR variant. This means one of her X chromosomes carries the pathogenic allele and the other carries the wild-type allele. According to the principles of Mendelian segregation, she has a $1$ in $2$ chance of transmitting the X chromosome with the pathogenic allele to any given offspring. The fraction of somatic cells inactivating the variant-carrying X, $s=0.50$, is irrelevant to this germline transmission probability.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_1$, is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.97 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.97 = 0.2425$$\n\n**2. Mother is $46,XX$ heterozygous, skewed somatic X-inactivation ($s=0.90$).**\nThe mother's genetic status at the germline level is identical to the first scenario: she is heterozygous. The fact that her somatic X-inactivation is highly skewed ($s=0.90$) may have clinical implications for her own phenotype, but as explicitly stated in the problem's foundational facts, it does not affect the probability of allele transmission to her offspring. Meiosis in the oocytes still follows standard Mendelian segregation.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_2$, is identical to the first:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.97 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.97 = 0.2425$$\n\n**3.

Therefore, she will transmit a pathogenic allele to every one of her offspring, regardless of their sex. The probability of transmitting the pathogenic allele is certain.\nThus, $P(\\text{Transmit}) = 1$.\nThe risk for this scenario, $R_3$, is:\n$$R_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P(\\text{Transmit}) \\times p = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 0.97 = 0.485$$\nTo express this with four significant figures, we write $0.4850$.\n\nIn summary, the risks for the three scenarios are $0.2425$, $0.2425$, and $0.4850$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2425 & 0.2425 & 0.4850 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5039068"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetic counseling must often contend with incomplete information and biological complexities such as variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.
