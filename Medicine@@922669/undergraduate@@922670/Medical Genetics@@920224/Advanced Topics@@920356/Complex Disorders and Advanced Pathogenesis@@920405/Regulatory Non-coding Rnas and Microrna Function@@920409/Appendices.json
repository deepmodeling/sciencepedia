The rate of change of the miRNA concentration, $M(t)$, is given by the difference between its production rate (inflow) and its degradation rate (outflow).\nThe production occurs at a constant rate, $k_{\\text{prod}}$. This is a zero-order process.\nThe degradation is a first-order process, meaning its rate is directly proportional to the current concentration, $M(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{\\text{decay}}$. The degradation rate is therefore $k_{\\text{decay}}M(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass-balance equation is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{prod}} - k_{\\text{decay}}M(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial condition that the concentration is zero at time $t=0$, which is written as $M(0) = 0$.\n\nThe first objective is to find the steady-state concentration, which we denote as $M_{\\text{ss}}$.

A decrease in both Firefly and Renilla would suggest general cellular toxicity or a global effect on transcription/translation, not specific repression. The purpose of normalization is precisely to distinguish specific effects on the target reporter from such global effects.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The proposed design and interpretation methodology are fundamentally flawed and contrary to standard scientific practice in the field.\n\n**C. Insert the miR-X sites into the Firefly coding sequence upstream of the stop codon to avoid 3' UTR effects, use a reversed-complement miR-X mimic as a negative control, and declare specificity if both wild-type and mutant reporters decrease by a similar amount upon miR-X mimic.**\n\n*   **Experimental Design:** This option is misguided.\n    *   The problem is about testing regulation in the 3' UTR, which is the canonical location for miRNA target sites (foundational fact (i)). Moving the sites into the coding sequence (CDS) changes the biological question and is not the standard assay for 3' UTR-mediated repression.\n    *   A scrambled mimic is a better negative control than a reverse complement, as the latter might have its own unintended activity.\n*   **Data Interpretation:** The criterion for specificity is logically inverted. If both wild-type and mutant reporters are repressed, it implies a *non-specific* effect, as the repression is not dependent on the intact seed sequence. Specificity is demonstrated when the wild-type is repressed and the mutant is not.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The design is inappropriate for the stated goal, and the logic for determining specificity is fundamentally wrong.\n\n**D. Clone miR-X sites into the Renilla 3' UTR in a dual-luciferase vector and treat Firefly as the internal control, use a “mutant” that changes only flanking nucleotides but preserves the seed pairing, and interpret specificity if the wild-type reporter decreases by about $45\\%$ while the “mutant” still decreases by about $20\\%$.**\n\n*   **Experimental Design:** This option contains critical flaws.\n    *   Swapping the roles of Renilla and Firefly is a valid alternative design. However, the proposed \"mutant\" is incorrect. To test seed-dependent recognition, the mutation *must* be in the seed sequence itself to disrupt pairing. A mutant that preserves the seed but changes flanking nucleotides tests the importance of the sequence *context*, not the seed itself.\n*   **Data Interpretation:** The interpretation of specificity is too lenient. A $20\\%$ repression of the control \"mutant\" is not negligible and would suggest that a significant portion of the effect is either not dependent on the flanking context or is due to off-targeting. Rigorous proof of specificity requires the mutant control to be largely or completely unresponsive, as was the case in the problem's pilot data.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.
