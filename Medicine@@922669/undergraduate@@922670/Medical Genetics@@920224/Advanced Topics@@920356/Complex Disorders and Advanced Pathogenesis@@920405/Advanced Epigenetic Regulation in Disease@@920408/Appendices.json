For this locus, methylation at the ICR silences the associated allele, whereas an unmethylated ICR permits transcription.

Therefore, in such a cell, the ICR methylation fraction is $1.0$.\n- Bulk bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) reports the average methylation across all alleles and cells, which under a two-state mixture model is a convex combination of the per-state methylation fractions, weighted by their cellular fractions.\n- Transcriptional output per cell is determined additively by allelic states: an unmethylated ICR allele contributes $1$ unit and a methylated ICR allele contributes $0$ units. Thus, a normal imprinted cell produces $1$ unit (one unmethylated allele), while a hypermethylated cell produces $0$ units (both alleles methylated).\n- The allelic methylation imbalance index is defined as $I \\equiv f$, the fraction of cells in the hypermethylated state.\n\nLet $f$ denote the fraction of hypermethylated cells and $1 - f$ the fraction of normal imprinted cells. The bulk methylation fraction $M_{\\text{bulk}}$ observed by bisulfite sequencing is then\n$$\nM_{\\text{bulk}} = f \\cdot 1 + (1 - f) \\cdot 0.5.\n$$\nWe are given $M_{\\text{bulk}} = 0.8$.

They quantify the enhancer-associated histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) as normalized read density in counts per million mapped reads (CPM). Biologically, H3K27ac is enriched at active enhancers, whereas H3K4me1 marks enhancer priming. For a classification task, they propose constructing a single scalar “activity score” that increases from repressed to poised to active enhancers, and then choosing quantitative thresholds on this score to delineate the three states.\n\nAssume the following empirically measured and widely used modeling assumptions:\n- Genome-wide, each mark is standardized to a $z$-score using its mean and standard deviation across enhancers: $z = (x - \\mu)/\\sigma$.\n- Within each enhancer state (active, poised, repressed), the joint distribution of the $z$-scores for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 is approximately Gaussian with an isotropic covariance matrix and similar variance across classes, and the class priors are approximately equal in this disease cohort.\n\nFrom a labeled training set of enhancers, the mean $z$-score vectors for each state are estimated as:\n- Repressed mean vector $m_{R} = \\left( -0.8,\\,-1.0 \\right)$,\n- Poised mean vector $m_{P} = \\left( 0.2,\\,1.8 \\right)$,\n- Active mean vector $m_{A} = \\left( 2.8,\\,2.3 \\right)$,\n\nwhere each vector is ordered as $\\left( z_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, z_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} \\right)$. The proposed one-dimensional “activity axis” is defined biologically and statistically as the vector from repressed to active mean, i.e., the difference $m_{A} - m_{R}$.\n\nFor a specific enhancer in a patient sample, the observed normalized signals are:\n- H3K27ac $x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 5.2$,\n- H3K4me1 $x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 6.3$,\n\nwith genome-wide normalization parameters:\n- H3K27ac mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 3.0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 2.0$,\n- H3K4me1 mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 4.5$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 1.5$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the Gaussian equal-covariance, equal-prior modeling assumption, do the following:\n- Construct a scalar activity score $s$ by projecting the enhancer’s two-dimensional $z$-score vector onto the activity axis defined by $m_{A} - m_{R}$.\n- Using only first principles under the stated assumptions, justify how two decision thresholds on $s$ can be placed to separate repressed from poised and poised from active regions.\n- Compute the scalar activity score $s$ for the given enhancer.\n\nReport only the numerical value of $s$ as a dimensionless quantity, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a scalar \"activity score\" for a specific enhancer based on its histone modification signals, and a justification for how this score can be used for classification. The solution proceeds in three stages: first, standardizing the raw data; second, computing the activity score via projection; and third, providing a theoretical basis for placing decision thresholds on this score.\n\nFirst, we must convert the raw Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) signals for the given enhancer into standard scores, or $z$-scores. The $z$-score for a variable is calculated as $z = (x - \\mu)/\\sigma$, where $x$ is the observed value, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nThe observed signals are given as a vector $x = (x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (5.2,\\, 6.3)$.\nThe genome-wide means are given as a vector $\\mu = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (3.0,\\, 4.5)$.\nThe genome-wide standard deviations are given as a vector $\\sigma = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (2.0,\\, 1.5)$.\n\nThe $z$-score for the H3K27ac mark is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}}} = \\frac{5.2 - 3.0}{2.0} = \\frac{2.2}{2.0} = 1.1$$\n\nThe $z$-score for the H3K4me1 mark is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}} = \\frac{6.3 - 4.5}{1.5} = \\frac{1.8}{1.5} = 1.2$$\n\nThus, the two-dimensional $z$-score vector for the enhancer is $z = (1.1,\\, 1.2)$.\n\nNext, we define the \"activity axis\". The problem states this axis is the vector from the mean of the repressed state to the mean of the active state. The mean $z$-score vectors for these states are given as $m_{R} = (-0.8,\\, -1.0)$ and $m_{A} = (2.8,\\, 2.3)$.\n\nThe activity axis vector, denoted by $v$, is therefore:\n$$v = m_{A} - m_{R} = (2.8 - (-0.8),\\, 2.3 - (-1.0)) = (3.6,\\, 3.3)$$\n\nThe scalar activity score, $s$, is obtained by projecting the enhancer's $z$-score vector onto this activity axis. The standard definition of this scalar projection in this context is the dot product of the data vector $z$ and the direction vector $v$:\n$$s = z \\cdot v$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values of $z$ and $v$:\n$$s = (1.1,\\, 1.2) \\cdot (3.6,\\, 3.3) = (1.1)(3.6) + (1.2)(3.3) = 3.96 + 3.96 = 7.92$$\n\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $s = 7.920$.\n\nFinally, we must justify a method for placing two decision thresholds on the score $s$ to separate the three enhancer states: repressed, poised, and active. The justification stems from the principles of Bayesian decision theory and, more specifically, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), for which the problem's assumptions are tailor-made.\n\nThe problem assumes that for each of the three classes (Repressed $R$, Poised $P$, Active $A$), the joint distribution of $z$-scores is a multivariate Gaussian, with an isotropic covariance matrix that is the same for all classes (i.e., $\\Sigma_R = \\Sigma_P = \\Sigma_A = \\sigma_{iso}^2 I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\sigma_{iso}^2$ is a constant variance). It also assumes that the prior probabilities of the classes are equal, $P(R) = P(P) = P(A)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the Bayes optimal discriminant function simplifies significantly. To classify a new point $z$, we assign it to the class $k \\in \\{R, P, A\\}$ that has the maximum posterior probability, $P(k|z)$. By Bayes' theorem, $P(k|z) \\propto p(z|k)P(k)$. Since the priors $P(k)$ are equal, this is equivalent to maximizing the class-conditional likelihood $p(z|k)$. Maximizing $p(z|k)$ is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which, for a Gaussian distribution with covariance $\\sigma_{iso}^2 I$, is equivalent to minimizing the squared Euclidean distance $\\|z - m_k\\|^2$.\n\nThe decision boundary between any two classes, say class $i$ and class $j$, is the set of points $z$ that are equidistant from the two class means, $m_i$ and $m_j$:\n$$\\|z - m_i\\|^2 = \\|z - m_j\\|^2$$\nExpanding this equation gives:\n$$(z - m_i) \\cdot (z - m_i) = (z - m_j) \\cdot (z - m_j)$$\n$$\\|z\\|^2 - 2 z \\cdot m_i + \\|m_i\\|^2 = \\|z\\|^2 - 2 z \\cdot m_j + \\|m_j\\|^2$$\n$$2 z \\cdot (m_j - m_i) = \\|m_j\\|^2 - \\|m_i\\|^2$$\nThis equation defines a hyperplane (a line in this $2$D case) that is perpendicular to the vector connecting the two class means, $m_j - m_i$.\n\nThe problem simplifies the $2$D classification problem to a $1$D problem by projecting all data onto the single activity axis $v = m_A - m_R$. The score $s = z \\cdot v$ represents the coordinate of the point $z$ in this new $1$D space. A linear projection of a Gaussian distribution is also a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, in the $1$D space of the score $s$, each class is represented by a Gaussian distribution with an equal variance. The means of these $1$D distributions are the projections of the original means: $s_R = m_R \\cdot v$, $s_P = m_P \\cdot v$, and $s_A = m_A \\cdot v$.\n\nTo separate two $1$D Gaussian distributions with equal variance and equal priors, the optimal decision point (threshold) is simply the midpoint between their means.\nTherefore, the threshold $t_{RP}$ to separate the repressed and poised states is the midpoint of their projected means:\n$$t_{RP} = \\frac{s_R + s_P}{2} = \\frac{m_R \\cdot v + m_P \\cdot v}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(m_R + m_P) \\cdot v$$\nSimilarly, the threshold $t_{PA}$ to separate the poised and active states is the midpoint of their projected means:\n$$t_{PA} = \\frac{s_P + s_A}{2} = \\frac{m_P \\cdot v + m_A \\cdot v}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(m_P + m_A) \\cdot v$$\n\nThis provides a principled, statistically optimal method (under the given assumptions) for placing two thresholds on the scalar score $s$ to define decision boundaries that separate the three enhancer states. An enhancer with score $s$ would be classified as repressed if $s  t_{RP}$, poised if $t_{RP} \\le s  t_{PA}$, and active if $s \\ge t_{PA}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.920}$$", "id": "5010201"}, {"introduction": "Epigenetic patterns are not static; they are the result of dynamic enzymatic processes that are deeply intertwined with the cell's metabolic state.

This is modeled as a single-substrate enzyme reaction.
