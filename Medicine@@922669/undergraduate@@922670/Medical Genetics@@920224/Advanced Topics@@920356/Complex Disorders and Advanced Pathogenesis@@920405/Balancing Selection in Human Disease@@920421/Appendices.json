It is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of allele $a$. As there are only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to $1$, so $p+q=1$.\n\nThe problem states that mating is random, so the genotype frequencies among zygotes (at conception) follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions:\n-   Frequency of $AA$ zygotes: $p^2$\n-   Frequency of $Aa$ zygotes: $2pq$\n-   Frequency of $aa$ zygotes: $q^2$\n\nViability selection occurs after conception, with the relative viabilities given as $w_{AA}=1-s$, $w_{Aa}=1$, and $w_{aa}=1-t$. The frequencies of the genotypes in the adult population, after selection, are proportional to their initial frequencies multiplied by their respective viabilities. The mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the sum of these products and serves as the normalization constant:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} = p^2(1-s) + 2pq(1) + q^2(1-t) $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, denoted $p'$, is the frequency of $A$ alleles among the surviving adults. The frequency of $A$ alleles contributed by $AA$ survivors is $p^2 w_{AA}$, and the frequency contributed by $Aa$ survivors is $pq w_{Aa}$. Thus,\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nAt equilibrium, allele frequencies do not change from one generation to the next, so $p' = p$. We denote the equilibrium frequency as $p^*$. The condition for equilibrium is therefore $\\Delta p = p' - p = 0$.\nFor a polymorphic equilibrium, we require $0 < p^* < 1$, which implies $p^* \\neq 0$ and $q^* \\neq 0$.\n\nThe change in allele frequency $\\Delta p$ is given by the general equation:\n$$ \\Delta p = p' - p = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} - p = \\frac{p(pw_{AA} + qw_{Aa}) - p\\bar{w}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nSetting $\\Delta p = 0$ for a polymorphic equilibrium ($p \\neq 0$) requires the numerator to be zero:\n$$ p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} - \\bar{w} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} - (p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa}) = 0 $$\nUsing $p+q=1$, we can simplify this expression. An alternative and more direct approach for finding the internal equilibrium is to set the numerator of the standard $\\Delta p$ formula to zero.\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq[p(w_{AA}-w_{Aa}) + q(w_{Aa}-w_{aa})]}{\\bar{w}} $$\nFor a polymorphic equilibrium where $p, q \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$ p^*(w_{AA}-w_{Aa}) + q^*(w_{Aa}-w_{aa}) = 0 $$\nwhere $p^*$ and $q^*$ are the equilibrium frequencies.\nSubstituting the given viability values into this equation:\n$$ p^*((1-s) - 1) + q^*(1 - (1-t)) = 0 $$\n$$ p^*(-s) + q^*(t) = 0 $$\n$$ tq^* = sp^* $$\nSince $q^* = 1 - p^*$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ t(1 - p^*) = sp^* $$\n$$ t - tp^* = sp^* $$\n$$ t = sp^* + tp^* = p^*(s+t) $$\nSolving for the equilibrium frequency of allele $A$, $p^*$:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{t}{s+t} $$\nThis is the general solution for the equilibrium frequency of allele $A$ under heterozygote advantage.\n\n**1) Calculation of the equilibrium frequency $p^{*}$**\nThe problem provides the specific values for the selection coefficients: $s=0.1$ and $t=0.2$. We substitute these into the derived formula for $p^*$:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{0.2}{0.1 + 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.3} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\n**2) Calculation of the fraction of diseased homozygotes among zygotes at equilibrium**\nThe problem asks for the fraction of clinically diseased homozygotes ($aa$) among zygotes at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the allele frequencies are $p^* = 2/3$ and $q^* = 1 - p^*$.\n$$ q^* = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe frequency of the $aa$ genotype among zygotes is given by the Hardy-Weinberg principle as $(q^*)^2$.\nTherefore, the expected fraction of clinically diseased homozygotes among zygotes at equilibrium is:\n$$ f(aa)_{\\text{zygotes, eq}} = (q^*)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n\nThe two required values are $p^*=\\frac{2}{3}$ and the fraction of $aa$ zygotes at equilibrium is $\\frac{1}{9}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{1}{9} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5014974"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational model, this exercise applies the principles of balancing selection to its textbook example: the sickle-cell allele in malarial environments [@problem_id:5014948].

In a large, randomly mating population, the genotype frequencies among zygotes are given by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions. Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of allele $a$, with $p+q=1$. The HWE frequencies are:\n- Frequency of $AA$ zygotes $= p^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ zygotes $= 2pq$\n- Frequency of $aa$ zygotes $= q^2$\n\nViability selection occurs before reproduction.
