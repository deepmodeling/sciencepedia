Skin: Unexplained stretch marks (striae).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the 2010 revised Ghent nosology, which is the standard clinical diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome. The *FBN1* gene, fibrillin-1 protein, and the listed clinical features are all factually correct and central to the pathophysiology and diagnosis of this genetic disorder. The problem is firmly grounded in established medical genetics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear set of scoring rules and a complete list of the patient's relevant clinical findings. The instruction to avoid double-counting within categories is a crucial and well-defined constraint. The task is to calculate a single numerical value, $S$, for which a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical terminology. The scoring system is given, and the patient's findings are presented as documented facts, free of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It is a direct and formal application of a medical diagnostic algorithm.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe total systemic score, $S$, is calculated by summing the points from each relevant anatomical category, adhering strictly to the rule that only the highest-scoring feature is counted within any single category. Let $S_i$ be the scorecontribution from the $i$-th category.\n\n$S = S_{\\text{chest}} + S_{\\text{limb}} + S_{\\text{foot}} + S_{\\text{pulmonary}} + S_{\\text{skin}}$\n\n1.  **Chest Wall Score ($S_{\\text{chest}}$)**:\n    - The patient exhibits \"prominent pectus carinatum deformity with mild chest asymmetry\".\n    - The scoring options for this category are pectus carinatum ($2$ points) and chest asymmetry ($1$ point).\n    - Since both features are in the \"Chest wall\" category, they are overlapping. The rule dictates that we must not double-count. In such cases, the feature with the highest point value is chosen, as it represents the most significant finding.\n    - Therefore, we assign points for pectus carinatum.\n    - $S_{\\text{chest}} = 2$.\n\n2.  **Upper Limb Signs Score ($S_{\\text{limb}}$)**:\n    - The patient has \"both the wrist sign and the thumb sign\" positive.\n    - The scoring system explicitly provides a value for this combined finding: $3$ points.\n    - $S_{\\text{limb}} = 3$.\n\n3.  **Foot Morphology Score ($S_{\\text{foot}}$)**:\n    - The patient has a \"Hindfoot valgus deformity\" and \"pes planus\".\n    - The scoring options are hindfoot deformity ($2$ points) and plain pes planus ($1$ point).\n    - These features belong to the same \"Foot morphology\" category. The term \"plain pes planus\" implies pes planus as an isolated finding. The presence of a more complex hindfoot deformity, which often incorporates pes planus, is the more significant and higher-scoring finding. To avoid double-counting, we take the score for the hindfoot deformity.\n    - $S_{\\text{foot}} = 2$.\n\n4.  **Pulmonary Score ($S_{\\text{pulmonary}}$)**:\n    - The patient has a history of \"one episode of spontaneous pneumothorax\".\n    - This directly corresponds to the criterion \"History of spontaneous pneumothorax\", which is worth $2$ points.\n    - $S_{\\text{pulmonary}} = 2$.\n\n5.  **Skin Score ($S_{\\text{skin}}$)**:\n    - The patient presents with \"Stretch marks on the lower back and shoulders\" not attributable to weight change or pregnancy.\n    - This matches the criterion for \"Skin striae\", which is worth $1$ point.\n    - $S_{\\text{skin}} = 1$.\n\n**Total Score Calculation**:\nThe total systemic score $S$ is the sum of the points from each category.\n$$ S = S_{\\text{chest}} + S_{\\text{limb}} + S_{\\text{foot}} + S_{\\text{pulmonary}} + S_{\\text{skin}} $$\n$$ S = 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 $$\n$$ S = 10 $$\n\n**Conclusion on Diagnostic Threshold**:\nThe problem requires a determination of whether the diagnostic threshold of $S \\geq 7$ is met. With a calculated score of $S=10$, we evaluate the inequality:\n$$ 10 \\geq 7 $$\nThis statement is true. The patient meets the systemic score criterion for a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (in the context of having a known *FBN1* mutation, the diagnosis is already established, but this score quantifies a major criterion).\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of $S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "5056765"}, {"introduction": "Among the systemic features of Marfan syndrome, progressive aortic root dilatation is the most critical due to the risk of life-threatening dissection.

The use of Body Surface Area (BSA) to normalize cardiovascular measurements is standard clinical practice.

The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the expected population mean.

Marfan syndrome is a well-characterized autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the *FBN1* gene. The concepts of heterozygosity, Mendelian segregation, and age-dependent penetrance are fundamental principles in this field.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, identifying the inheritance pattern of Marfan syndrome based on the provided information, and second, calculating the recurrence risk for a child to be clinically affected.\n\n**Part 1: Identification of Inheritance Pattern**\nThe problem states that an individual with a single heterozygous pathogenic variant is clinically affected. A heterozygous genotype means the individual has one copy of the pathogenic allele and one copy of the wild-type (normal) allele. The fact that a single copy of the pathogenic allele is sufficient to cause the clinical phenotype is the definition of a dominant mode of inheritance. The *FBN1* gene is located on chromosome $15$, which is an autosome (a non-sex chromosome). Therefore, the inheritance pattern that best describes Marfan syndrome, based on the information provided, is autosomal dominant.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Recurrence Risk**\nThe recurrence risk for a child to be clinically affected is the product of two independent probabilities:\n$1$. The probability that the child inherits the pathogenic *FBN1* allele from the affected parent.\n$2$. The probability that the child, having inherited the allele, will express the clinical phenotype by age $20$ (i.e., the penetrance).\n\nLet `$A$` represent the pathogenic *FBN1* allele and `$a$` represent the wild-type allele.\n\nThe affected parent is heterozygous, so their genotype is `$Aa$`.\nThe partner is unaffected and has no detectable *FBN1* variant, so their genotype is homozygous for the wild-type allele, `$aa$`.\n\nThe possible genotypes of their offspring can be determined using a Punnett square:\n| | `$a$` | `$a$` |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: |\n| **`$A$`** | `$Aa$` | `$Aa$` |\n| **`$a$`** | `$aa$` | `$aa$` |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see there are four equally likely outcomes for the offspring's genotype: `$Aa$`, `$Aa$`, `$aa$`, and `$aa$`.\nThe probability of a child inheriting the pathogenic allele `$A$` (i.e., having the genotype `$Aa$`) is the number of `$Aa$` outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\nLet $P(\\text{genotype } Aa)$ be this probability.\n$$P(\\text{genotype } Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nThe problem states that the age-dependent penetrance of the pathogenic variant by age $20$ is $0.95$. Penetrance is the conditional probability of an individual expressing the phenotype given that they have the causative genotype. Let $C$ be the event that a child is clinically affected by age $20$. The penetrance is the conditional probability $P(C | \\text{genotype } Aa)$.\n$$P(C | \\text{genotype } Aa) = 0.95$$\n\nThe overall recurrence risk is the probability that a child both inherits the pathogenic allele AND is clinically affected. This corresponds to the joint probability $P(C \\cap \\text{genotype } Aa)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, this is calculated as:\n$$\\text{Risk} = P(C | \\text{genotype } Aa) \\times P(\\text{genotype } Aa)$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$\\text{Risk} = 0.95 \\times 0.5$$\n$$\\text{Risk} = 0.475$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
