Clearly state the assumptions required for your derivation. Express your final frequency as a decimal.", "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard application of the Hardy–Weinberg principle to an X-linked genetic locus, a fundamental concept in population genetics. All necessary data are provided, and the premise is factually sound within the context of medical genetics.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected frequency of women who carry at least one *FMR1* premutation allele in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The *FMR1* gene is located on the X chromosome.\n\nLet us define the alleles for the *FMR1* gene. Let the normal allele be denoted by $A$, and the premutation allele by $a$. According to the problem statement, the frequency of the premutation allele, $a$, in the population's gene pool of X chromosomes is given as $q$.\n$$q = 0.002$$\nSince there are only two alleles considered in this simple model, the frequency of the normal allele, $p$, is complementary to $q$.\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\n\nThe derivation relies on the Hardy–Weinberg principle applied to an X-linked locus. The key assumptions for this principle to hold are:\n1.  The population is large, such that the effects of genetic drift are negligible.\n2.  Mating is random with respect to the *FMR1* locus.\n3.  There is no natural selection acting on the genotypes; all genotypes have equal viability and fertility. The problem statement guarantees the population is at equilibrium, so we proceed under this condition.\n4.  There is no new mutation converting allele $A$ to $a$ or vice versa.\n5.  There is no gene flow (migration) from other populations.\n\nFemales have two X chromosomes ($XX$), while males have one ($XY$). Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies in females are determined by the random combination of alleles from the egg and sperm pools. Because the population has an equal sex ratio and is at equilibrium, the allele frequencies ($p$ and $q$) are the same for the X chromosomes in both males and females, and thus the same in the gametes they produce.\n\nThe expected genotype frequencies for females (genotype $XX$) are given by the expansion of the binomial $(p+q)^2$:\n-   Frequency of homozygous normal females ($X^A X^A$): $f(X^A X^A) = p \\times p = p^2$\n-   Frequency of heterozygous females ($X^A X^a$): $f(X^A X^a) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq$\n-   Frequency of homozygous premutation females ($X^a X^a$): $f(X^a X^a) = q \\times q = q^2$\n\nThe sum of these frequencies must equal $1$: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = (1)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency of women who carry **at least one** *FMR1* premutation allele. This group includes both heterozygous females ($X^A X^a$) and homozygous premutation-carrying females ($X^a X^a$). The total frequency of these women is the sum of their individual frequencies.\n$$f(\\text{carrier females}) = f(X^A X^a) + f(X^a X^a) = 2pq + q^2$$\n\nAlternatively, one can calculate this frequency by finding the complement of the frequency of women who have *no* premutation alleles, i.e., homozygous normal females ($X^A X^A$).\n$$f(\\text{carrier females}) = 1 - f(X^A X^A) = 1 - p^2$$\nThis expression is algebraically equivalent to the first one: $1 - p^2 = 1 - (1-q)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2q + q^2) = 2q - q^2$. Let's re-examine the first expression: $2pq + q^2 = 2(1-q)q + q^2 = 2q - 2q^2 + q^2 = 2q - q^2$. The expressions are indeed equivalent.\n\nLet's use the expression $1 - p^2$ for calculation, as it requires fewer steps. We have the value for $p$:\n$$p = 0.998$$\nFirst, we calculate $p^2$:\n$$p^2 = (0.998)^2 = 0.996004$$\nNow, we calculate the final frequency:\n$$f(\\text{carrier females}) = 1 - p^2 = 1 - 0.996004 = 0.003996$$\n\nTo verify this result, we can use the other formula, $2pq + q^2$:\n$$q = 0.002$$\n$$p = 0.998$$\n$$2pq = 2 \\times 0.998 \\times 0.002 = 0.003992$$\n$$q^2 = (0.002)^2 = 0.000004$$\n$$f(\\text{carrier females}) = 2pq + q^2 = 0.003992 + 0.000004 = 0.003996$$\nThe results from both methods are identical, confirming the correctness of the calculation. The expected frequency of women who carry at least one *FMR1* premutation allele is $0.003996$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.003996}$$", "id": "5039372"}, {"introduction": "Genetic counseling relies on accurately calculating the risk of passing a condition to the next generation.

The child manifests MRKH, conditional on being a female carrier (event $M$).\n4.  The child manifests congenital renal anomalies, conditional on being a female carrier (event $R$).\n\nThe problem provides the probabilities for these events.\n- The probability of having a daughter is given as $P(F) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The probability of inheriting the deletion, $P(D)$, depends on the maternal genetic scenario.\n- The penetrance for MRKH in a female carrier is $P(M|F \\cap D) = p_{\\text{MRKH}} = 0.25$.\n- The penetrance for renal anomalies in a female carrier is $P(R|F \\cap D) = p_{\\text{renal}} = 0.50$.\n\nThe problem states that conditional on carrying the deletion, MRKH and renal anomalies are independent. Therefore, the probability of a female carrier manifesting both is the product of their individual penetrances:\n$$P(M \\cap R | F \\cap D) = P(M | F \\cap D) \\times P(R | F \\cap D) = p_{\\text{MRKH}} \\times p_{\\text{renal}}$$\nThe overall probability of event $\\mathcal{E}$ can be calculated using the chain rule of probability:\n$$P(\\mathcal{E}) = P(F \\cap D \\cap M \\cap R)$$\nGiven the independencies, this simplifies to:\n$$P(\\mathcal{E}) = P(F) \\times P(D) \\times P(M \\cap R | F \\cap D)$$\n$$P(\\mathcal{E}) = P(F) \\times P(D) \\times p_{\\text{MRKH}} \\times p_{\\text{renal}}$$\n\nWe now calculate this probability for each of the two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario (a): De novo constitutional event**\nIn this scenario, the mother is a non-mosaic heterozygote for the $17q12$ deletion.

The probability of transmitting the deletion to an offspring is therefore equal to this fraction.\nLet $P(\\mathcal{E}|b)$ be the recurrence risk in this scenario. The probability of transmitting the deletion is $P(D|b) = q$.\nSubstituting this into the general formula for the risk:\n$$P(\\mathcal{E}|b) = P(F) \\times P(D|b) \\times p_{\\text{MRKH}} \\times p_{\\text{renal}}$$\n$$P(\\mathcal{E}|b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times q \\times p_{\\text{MRKH}} \\times p_{\\text{renal}}$$\n\n**Fold-Change Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the fold-change, defined as the ratio of the risk in scenario (a) to the risk in scenario (b).\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{P(\\mathcal{E}|a)}{P(\\mathcal{E}|b)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} p_{\\text{MRKH}} p_{\\text{renal}}}{\\frac{1}{2} q \\cdot p_{\\text{MRKH}} p_{\\text{renal}}}$$\nThe terms for penetrance, $p_{\\text{MRKH}}$ and $p_{\\text{renal}}$, cancel out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{q}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{q} = \\frac{2}{4q} = \\frac{1}{2q}$$\nNow, we substitute the given value for the mosaic fraction, $q = 0.10$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 0.10} = \\frac{1}{0.20}$$\nEvaluating this expression gives the final numerical value:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 5$$\nThe recurrence risk is $5$ times higher if the mother is a constitutional heterozygote compared to if she has gonadal mosaicism with a $10\\%$ allelic fraction in her germline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "5039431"}, {"introduction": "Modern medicine increasingly uses genetic data to refine a patient's individual risk profile.

It provides a complete set of data and a clear objective, allowing for a unique solution through standard biostatistical methods.\n\nThe task is to calculate the post-test probability of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) for a patient who tests positive for a specific genetic risk allele. We are instructed to use Bayes' theorem in odds form. Let $D$ denote the event that the patient has DOR, and let $A$ denote the event that the patient carries the risk allele (a positive genetic \"test\").\n\nThe relationship between pre-test odds, post-test odds, and the likelihood ratio is given by Bayes' theorem in odds form:\n$$ \\text{Post-test Odds} = \\text{Pre-test Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\nIn our notation, this is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|A) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR+ $$\nwhere $LR+$ is the likelihood ratio for a positive test result.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the pre-test odds of DOR.
