In the reference diploid human genome, there are $2$ alpha-globin genes per chromosome $16$ (one hemoglobin subunit alpha $1$ gene and one hemoglobin subunit alpha $2$ gene), yielding a total of $4$ intact alpha-globin genes in the normal genotype, written as $\\alpha\\alpha/\\alpha\\alpha$. The $-\\alpha^{3.7}$ allele denotes a single-gene deletion on one chromosome $16$, removing one intact alpha-globin gene, while the $--^{SEA}$ allele denotes a deletion of both alpha-globin genes on one chromosome $16$ (Southeast Asian, SEA, double-gene deletion).

The definitions of alleles, dosage, and phenotypes are unambiguous. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem is found to be free of flaws. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a formalizable problem within the scope of medical genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires calculating the gene dosage, $D$, for each specified genotype and then assigning the corresponding phenotype code, $P$. The gene dosage is the sum of intact alpha-globin genes from both homologous chromosomes. The genotype `X/Y` represents the genetic constitution of the two homologous chromosomes $16$, where `X` and `Y` are the haplotypes on each chromosome.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of intact alpha-globin genes for each possible haplotype based on the problem's definitions:\n- The normal haplotype, denoted $\\alpha\\alpha$, has $2$ intact alpha-globin genes.\n- The single-gene deletion haplotype, $-\\alpha^{3.7}$, has one gene removed from the normal haplotype, thus it has $2 - 1 = 1$ intact gene.\n- The double-gene deletion haplotype, $--^{SEA}$, has both genes removed from the normal haplotype, thus it has $2 - 2 = 0$ intact genes.\n\nNext, we establish the mapping from gene dosage $D$ to the phenotype code $P$ by combining the two mappings provided in the problem statement:\n- $D=3$ (silent carrier) $\\to P=1$\n- $D=2$ (trait) $\\to P=2$\n- $D=1$ (HbH disease) $\\to P=3$\n- $D=0$ (hydrops fetalis) $\\to P=4$\n\nNow, we can compute $(D, P)$ for each of the four requested genotypes.\n\n1.  **Genotype 1: $(-\\alpha^{3.7}/\\alpha\\alpha)$**\n    - The first haplotype is $-\\alpha^{3.7}$, which contributes $1$ intact gene.\n    - The second haplotype is $\\alpha\\alpha$, which contributes $2$ intact genes.\n    - The total gene dosage is $D_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n    - For $D=3$, the phenotype is \"silent carrier\", which corresponds to the phenotype code $P_1 = 1$.\n    - The pair for this genotype is $(D_1, P_1) = (3, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Genotype 2: $(-\\alpha^{3.7}/-\\alpha^{3.7})$**\n    - The first haplotype is $-\\alpha^{3.7}$, contributing $1$ intact gene.\n    - The second haplotype is also $-\\alpha^{3.7}$, contributing $1$ intact gene.\n    - The total gene dosage is $D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    - For $D=2$, the phenotype is \"alpha-thalassemia trait\", which corresponds to the phenotype code $P_2 = 2$. This is the *trans* configuration of alpha-thalassemia trait, as the deletions are on different homologous chromosomes.\n    - The pair for this genotype is $(D_2, P_2) = (2, 2)$.\n\n3.  **Genotype 3: $(--^{SEA}/\\alpha\\alpha)$**\n    - The first haplotype is $--^{SEA}$, which contributes $0$ intact genes.\n    - The second haplotype is $\\alpha\\alpha$, which contributes $2$ intact genes.\n    - The total gene dosage is $D_3 = 0 + 2 = 2$.\n    - For $D=2$, the phenotype is \"alpha-thalassemia trait\", which corresponds to the phenotype code $P_3 = 2$. This is the *cis* configuration of alpha-thalassemia trait, as both deletions are on the same homologous chromosome.\n    - The pair for this genotype is $(D_3, P_3) = (2, 2)$.\n\n4.  **Genotype 4: $(--^{SEA}/-\\alpha^{3.7})$**\n    - The first haplotype is $--^{SEA}$, contributing $0$ intact genes.\n    - The second haplotype is $-\\alpha^{3.7}$, contributing $1$ intact gene.\n    - The total gene dosage is $D_4 = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n    - For $D=1$, the phenotype is \"Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease\", which corresponds to the phenotype code $P_4 = 3$.\n    - The pair for this genotype is $(D_4, P_4) = (1, 3)$.\n\nFinally, the results must be presented as a single row matrix containing the values $D_1, P_1, D_2, P_2, D_3, P_3, D_4, P_4$ in order.\nThe sequence of values is $3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5086016"}, {"introduction": "A central role of medical genetics is to predict inheritance patterns and disease risk within families.

Partner $1$ has genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}$. Partner $2$ has genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}$.

Express your answer as a decimal without a percentage sign. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the per-pregnancy recurrence risk that a child of a specific couple will have beta-thalassemia major. This can be determined by applying the principles of Mendelian genetics.\n\nFirst, we must identify the genotypes of the two partners and the types of gametes each can produce. The problem states that the hemoglobin subunit beta gene ($HBB$) is autosomal. The alleles at this locus are $\\beta^{0}$ and $\\beta^{+}$.\n\nThe genotype of Partner $1$ is given as $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}$. According to Mendel's Law of Segregation, the two alleles at this locus will separate during gamete formation, so that each gamete receives only one allele. The problem specifies equal gamete frequencies. Therefore, Partner $1$ will produce two types of gametes, $\\beta^{0}$ and $\\beta^{+}$, with equal probability.\nThe probability of a gamete from Partner $1$ carrying the $\\beta^{0}$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete}_{1} = \\beta^{0}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, or $0.5$.\nThe probability of a gamete from Partner $1$ carrying the $\\beta^{+}$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete}_{1} = \\beta^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, or $0.5$.\n\nThe genotype of Partner $2$ is given as $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}$. This individual is homozygous for the $\\beta^{0}$ allele. Consequently, all gametes produced by Partner $2$ will carry the $\\beta^{0}$ allele.\nThe probability of a gamete from Partner $2$ carrying the $\\beta^{0}$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete}_{2} = \\beta^{0}) = 1$.\n\nNext, we determine the possible genotypes of the offspring and their respective probabilities. The genotype of an offspring is determined by the random combination of one gamete from each parent. We can calculate the probability of each possible offspring genotype by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent gametes.\n\nThere are two possible genotypes for a child of this couple:\n1.  Genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}$: This occurs if the child inherits a $\\beta^{0}$ allele from Partner $1$ and a $\\beta^{0}$ allele from Partner $2$. The probability of this event is:\n    $$P(\\text{genotype} = \\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}) = P(\\text{gamete}_{1} = \\beta^{0}) \\times P(\\text{gamete}_{2} = \\beta^{0})$$\n    $$P(\\text{genotype} = \\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\n2.  Genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}$: This occurs if the child inherits a $\\beta^{+}$ allele from Partner $1$ and a $\\beta^{0}$ allele from Partner $2$. The probability of this event is:\n    $$P(\\text{genotype} = \\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}) = P(\\text{gamete}_{1} = \\beta^{+}) \\times P(\\text{gamete}_{2} = \\beta^{0})$$\n    $$P(\\text{genotype} = \\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nThe sum of the probabilities of all possible offspring genotypes is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe final step is to relate these genotypes to the clinical phenotype of interest, which is beta-thalassemia major. The problem provides the necessary genotype-phenotype correlation:\n-   Individuals with genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}$ manifest beta-thalassemia major.\n-   Individuals with genotype $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{+}$ do not manifest beta-thalassemia major.\n\nThe recurrence risk for beta-thalassemia major is therefore equal to the probability of a child having the $\\beta^{0}/\\beta^{0}$ genotype.
