As per the instructions, the first step is to perform a rigorous validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Biological Process**: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in human females.\n- **Null Model**: Random XCI, where each progenitor cell independently inactivates the maternal or paternal X chromosome with equal probability. This is modeled as a series of identically distributed Bernoulli trials.\n- **Probability**: The probability of inactivating either the maternal or paternal X chromosome in a single trial is $p = 1/2$.\n- **Progenitor Cells**: A tissue develops from $N = 20$ independent progenitor cells.\n- **Mosaic Ratio Assumption**: The observed mosaic ratio in the tissue is assumed to be equal to the fraction of progenitors that chose each X chromosome for inactivation.\n- **Clinical Definition of Skew**: Skewed XCI is defined as an inactivation ratio of at least $80:20$. This is specified to mean that the fraction of cells expressing one parental X chromosome is greater than or equal to $0.8$ or less than or equal to $0.2$.\n- **Assumption**: No post-inactivation selection occurs.\n- **Objective**: Calculate the exact probability that the observed skew equals or exceeds the $80:20$ threshold purely by chance under the null model of random XCI.\n- **Required Format**: The answer must be a single reduced fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in medical genetics and population genetics. The concept of X-chromosome inactivation, Lyon's hypothesis, and the modeling of random XCI using a binomial distribution are standard and fundamental principles in the field. The $80:20$ threshold is a commonly used, albeit not universally standardized, clinical benchmark for significant skew. The assumptions, such as no post-inactivation selection and the progenitor bottleneck being the primary source of variance, are standard simplifications for such a model.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It defines a clear stochastic process (a sequence of Bernoulli trials), provides all necessary parameters (number of trials $N=20$, success probability $p=1/2$), and specifies a precise condition (skew $\\ge 80:20$) for which a probability is to be calculated. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective and precise language. All terms are clearly defined within the context of the problem (e.g., the meaning of \"exceeds $80:20$\"). It is free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (Scientific Unsoundness, Non-Formalizable, Incomplete Setup, Unrealistic, Ill-Posed, Pseudo-Profound, Outside Scientific Verifiability).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the probability of observing skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by chance in a tissue derived from $N=20$ progenitor cells, assuming a random inactivation process.\n\nLet $K$ be a random variable representing the number of progenitor cells out of the total $N=20$ that inactivate a specific parental X chromosome (e.g., the paternal X). Since each of the $N$ cells makes an independent choice with a constant probability $p=1/2$, the random variable $K$ follows a binomial distribution, denoted as $K \\sim B(n, p)$, where the number of trials is $n=N=20$ and the probability of success (inactivating the chosen parental X) is $p=1/2$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nFor our specific case, this becomes:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20-k} = \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nSkewed XCI is defined as a ratio of at least $80:20$. This means the fraction of cells inactivating one parental X, which is $K/N$, satisfies either $K/N \\ge 0.8$ or $K/N \\le 0.2$. With $N=20$, we can convert these fractions into integer counts for $K$:\n1.  High skew: $\\frac{K}{20} \\ge 0.8 \\implies K \\ge 16$.\n2.  Low skew: $\\frac{K}{20} \\le 0.2 \\implies K \\le 4$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of this event, which is $P(K \\le 4 \\text{ or } K \\ge 16)$. Since the events $\\{K \\le 4\\}$ and $\\{K \\ge 16\\}$ are mutually exclusive, the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = P(K \\le 4) + P(K \\ge 16)$$\n\nWe can express these probabilities as sums of PMF values:\n$$P(K \\le 4) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = \\sum_{k=16}^{20} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=16}^{20} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nFor a binomial distribution with $p=1/2$, the distribution of probabilities is symmetric around the mean $n/2 = 10$. This symmetry is a consequence of the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$. Therefore, $P(K=k) = P(K=n-k)$.\nApplying this symmetry to our problem ($n=20$):\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = P(K=16) + P(K=17) + P(K=18) + P(K=19) + P(K=20)$$\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = P(K=4) + P(K=3) + P(K=2) + P(K=1) + P(K=0) = P(K \\le 4)$$\nThus, the total probability of skew is:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = 2 \\times P(K \\le 4) = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nNow, we compute the sum of the binomial coefficients:\n$\\binom{20}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{20}{1} = 20$\n$\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = 190$\n$\\binom{20}{3} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1140$\n$\\binom{20}{4} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4845$\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} = 1 + 20 + 190 + 1140 + 4845 = 6196$$\n\nSubstituting this sum back into the probability expression:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = 2 \\times 6196 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20} = \\frac{2 \\times 6196}{2^{20}} = \\frac{6196}{2^{19}}$$\n\nTo express this as a reduced fraction, we find the prime factorization of the numerator.\n$6196 = 4 \\times 1549 = 2^2 \\times 1549$. The number $1549$ is not divisible by small primes (e.g., $3, 5, 7, 11, ...$). The denominator is a power of $2$.\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = \\frac{2^2 \\times 1549}{2^{19}} = \\frac{1549}{2^{17}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the value of the denominator:\n$2^{10} = 1024$\n$2^{7} = 128$\n$2^{17} = 2^{10} \\times 2^{7} = 1024 \\times 128 = 131072$.\n\nSo the exact probability is:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = \\frac{1549}{131072}$$\nSince $1549$ is an odd number and the denominator is a power of $2$, this fraction is in its simplest (reduced) form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1549}{131072}}\n$$", "id": "5082356"}, {"introduction": "This exercise bridges the gap between cellular mosaicism and a systemic clinical biomarker.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the steady-state serum CK concentration, $C$, for a manifesting carrier and then calculate its value.\n\nFirst, we determine the fraction of dystrophin-deficient domains, $f$. The problem states that the ratio of nuclei with the mutant X active to those with the wild-type X active is $85:15$. The fraction $f$ is the number of mutant-active nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei.\n$$f = \\frac{85}{85 + 15} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$$\nConsequently, the fraction of normal, dystrophin-positive domains is $1-f = 1-0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe model states that the total tissue is a mosaic composed of two populations of sarcolemmal domains: normal domains with a CK leakage rate of $r_n$ and deficient domains with a leakage rate of $r_m$. The average CK leakage rate for the entire muscle mass, $\\bar{r}$, is the weighted average of the rates from these two populations, where the weights are their respective fractions.\n$$\\bar{r} = (1-f) \\cdot r_n + f \\cdot r_m$$\n\nWe are given the relationship $r_m = \\lambda r_n$. Substituting this into the expression for the average leakage rate:\n$$\\bar{r} = (1-f) r_n + f (\\lambda r_n)$$\nFactoring out the common term $r_n$:\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( (1-f) + f\\lambda \\right)$$\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( 1 - f + f\\lambda \\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the steady-state serum CK concentration, $C$, is proportional to the average leakage rate, $\\bar{r}$. Let $k$ be the constant of proportionality, which encapsulates factors such as total muscle mass and the clearance rate of CK from the serum.\n$$C = k \\bar{r}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{r}$:\n$$C = k r_n \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n\nTo determine the term $k r_n$, we use the baseline condition for a healthy female. In this case, there are no mutant alleles, so $f=0$. The corresponding serum CK concentration is $C_b$.\n$$C_b = k r_n \\left( 1 + (0)(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n$$C_b = k r_n (1)$$\n$$C_b = k r_n$$\nThis result is biologically intuitive: the baseline CK concentration is proportional to the baseline leakage rate from healthy muscle tissue.\n\nNow, we substitute $C_b$ for $k r_n$ in the general expression for $C$:\n$$C = C_b \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the carrier's serum CK concentration in terms of the baseline concentration $C_b$, the fraction of deficient cells $f$, and the membrane fragility multiplier $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $C$ using the given parameters:\n- $C_b = 100\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$\n- $f = 0.85$\n- $\\lambda = 15$\n\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 0.85 (15 - 1) \\right)$$\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 0.85 \\cdot 14 \\right)$$\nThe product $0.85 \\times 14$ is calculated:\n$$0.85 \\times 14 = 11.9$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $C$:\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 11.9 \\right)$$\n$$C = 100 (12.9)$$\n$$C = 1290\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $1290$, is already expressed with three significant figures (the trailing zero is not significant in this context). In scientific notation, this is $1.29 \\times 10^3$.
