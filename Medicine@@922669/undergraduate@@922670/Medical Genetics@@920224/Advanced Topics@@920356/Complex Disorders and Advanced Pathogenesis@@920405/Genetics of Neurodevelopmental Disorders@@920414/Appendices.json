Let the wild-type allele be $A$ and the pathogenic allele be $a$. Both parents thus have the genotype $Aa$.\n-   **Inheritance Model:** The disorder is autosomal recessive. Mendel’s First Law (law of segregation) applies.\n-   **Allele Transmission Probabilities:** Each heterozygous parent transmits the pathogenic allele ($a$) with probability $1/2$ and the non-pathogenic allele ($A$) with probability $1/2$.\n-   **Disease Condition (Inherited):** The disorder manifests when a child possesses two pathogenic alleles ($aa$).\n-   **Penetrance:** The disorder has complete penetrance, meaning genotype reliably predicts phenotype.\n-   **De Novo Mutation:** A *de novo* inactivating mutation (\"second hit\") can arise on any wild-type allele ($A$) in the zygote.\n-   **De Novo Mutation Probability:** The probability is $r$ per allele, where $r=10^{-5}$.\n-   **Independence Assumptions:** De novo events are independent across alleles. De novo events are independent from segregation events.\n-   **Disease Condition (General):** Any biallelic inactivation (i.e., both alleles of the gene are non-functional, either inherited as $a$ or mutated from $A$ to a non-functional state) yields disease expression.\n-   **Objective:** Derive the total probability that a child is affected, expressing the answer as a decimal rounded to $6$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics (autosomal recessive inheritance) and molecular genetics (the concept of *de novo* mutations and the \"two-hit\" model, analogous to the Knudson hypothesis). The given mutation rate of $r=10^{-5}$ is a plausible value for a single-locus *de novo* mutation rate in humans. The scenario is a standard, albeit simplified, theoretical model used in genetic counseling and risk assessment. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary information is provided. The parental genotypes, inheritance pattern, segregation probabilities, and *de novo* mutation rate are explicitly defined. The assumptions of independence and complete penetrance are clearly stated. This allows for the calculation of a unique, stable, and meaningful probability.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is free of the listed flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total probability of a child being affected, $P(\\text{affected})$, can be calculated by considering the mutually exclusive inherited genotypes and the probability of being affected within each genotype category. The Law of Total Probability states:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = \\sum_{G} P(\\text{affected} | G) P(G)$$\nwhere $G$ represents the set of possible inherited genotypes $\\{AA, Aa, aa\\}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities of the three possible inherited genotypes from a cross between two heterozygous parents ($Aa \\times Aa$).\n-   Probability of inheriting genotype $AA$: $P(AA) = P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Probability of inheriting genotype $Aa$: $P(Aa) = [P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother})] + [P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother})] = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   Probability of inheriting genotype $aa$: $P(aa) = P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we calculate the conditional probability of being affected for each of these inherited genotypes, considering the possibility of *de novo* \"second hits\". Let $r = 10^{-5}$ be the per-allele probability of a *de novo* inactivating mutation on a wild-type allele.\n\n**Case 1: Inherited genotype is $aa$.**\nThe child inherits two pathogenic alleles. Due to complete penetrance, the child is affected with certainty. No *de novo* events are needed.\n$$P(\\text{affected} | aa) = 1$$\nThe contribution to the total probability from this case is:\n$$P(\\text{affected} \\cap aa) = P(\\text{affected} | aa) P(aa) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n**Case 2: Inherited genotype is $Aa$.**\nThe child inherits one pathogenic allele ($a$) and one wild-type allele ($A$). For the disorder to manifest (biallelic inactivation), the single wild-type allele $A$ must undergo a *de novo* inactivating mutation. The probability of this \"second hit\" is given as $r$.\n$$P(\\text{affected} | Aa) = r$$\nThe contribution to the total probability from this case is:\n$$P(\\text{affected} \\cap Aa) = P(\\text{affected} | Aa) P(Aa) = r \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{r}{2}$$\n\n**Case 3: Inherited genotype is $AA$.**\nThe child inherits two wild-type alleles ($A$). For the disorder to manifest, both wild-type alleles must independently undergo a *de novo* inactivating mutation. Since the *de novo* events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$P(\\text{affected} | AA) = r \\times r = r^2$$\nThe contribution to the total probability from this case is:\n$$P(\\text{affected} \\cap AA) = P(\\text{affected} | AA) P(AA) = r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{r^2}{4}$$\n\n**Total Probability**\nThe total probability of the child being affected is the sum of the probabilities from these three mutually exclusive cases:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(\\text{affected} \\cap aa) + P(\\text{affected} \\cap Aa) + P(\\text{affected} \\cap AA)$$\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r^2}{4}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical value $r=10^{-5}$:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{10^{-5}}{2} + \\frac{(10^{-5})^2}{4}$$\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = 0.25 + \\frac{0.00001}{2} + \\frac{10^{-10}}{4}$$\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = 0.25 + 0.000005 + 0.000000000025$$\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = 0.250005000025$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $6$ significant figures. The first six significant figures are $2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5$. The seventh digit is $0$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$P(\\text{affected}) \\approx 0.250005$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.250005}\n$$", "id": "5040481"}, {"introduction": "Shifting from individual risk assessment to large-scale gene discovery, this practice delves into the statistical methods that power modern medical genetics.

It should be intolerant to functional inactivation (i.e., be under strong purifying selection in the general population). This is measured by LOEUF. A low LOEUF indicates high intolerance.\n2.  It should harbor an excess of damaging de novo mutations in affected individuals compared to the expectation from the neutral mutation rate.\n\nLet's analyze each gene based on these principles.\n\n**1. De Novo Enrichment Analysis**\n\nThe problem states that under neutrality, the number of de novo LoF mutations in a cohort of size $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = N \\mu$.\n\n*   Cohort size: $N = 10{,}000$\n*   Per-trio de novo LoF mutation rate for each gene: $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe expected number of de novo LoF mutations for *each* gene is:\n$$ \\lambda = N \\mu = (10{,}000) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 10^4 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.02 $$\n\nSo, under the null hypothesis (that mutations in these genes are not associated with NDDs), we expect to see about $0.02$ de novo LoF mutations in this cohort for each gene.\n\n**Analysis for Gene $G_X$:**\n*   Expected count: $\\lambda_X = 0.02$\n*   Observed count: $k_X = 6$\n\nThe observation of $k_X = 6$ is substantially higher than the expectation of $\\lambda_X = 0.02$. Let's quantify the significance. The probability of observing $k$ or more events from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ is $P(X \\ge k) = 1 - \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^i}{i!}$.\n\nFor $G_X$, we want to calculate $P(X_X \\ge 6)$ with $\\lambda = 0.02$.\n$P(X_X \\ge 6) = 1 - [P(X_X = 0) + P(X_X = 1) + ... + P(X_X = 5)]$.\n$P(X_X = 0) = e^{-0.02} \\approx 0.9802$\n$P(X_X = 1) = e^{-0.02} (0.02)^1 / 1! \\approx 0.0196$\n$P(X_X = 2) = e^{-0.02} (0.02)^2 / 2! \\approx 1.96 \\times 10^{-4}$\nThe probabilities for $k=3, 4, 5$ will be even smaller.\nThe probability of observing $6$ or more events is extremely small.\nLet's calculate $P(X_X=6) = e^{-0.02} (0.02)^6 / 6! \\approx (0.98) \\times (6.4 \\times 10^{-11}) / 720 \\approx 8.7 \\times 10^{-14}$.\nThe p-value $P(X_X \\ge 6)$ is vanishingly small. This constitutes a highly significant enrichment of de novo LoF mutations in $G_X$.\n\n**Analysis for Gene $G_Y$:**\n*   Expected count: $\\lambda_Y = 0.02$\n*   Observed count: $k_Y = 1$\n\nThe observation of $k_Y = 1$ is also higher than the expectation of $\\lambda_Y = 0.02$.\nLet's calculate the probability of observing $1$ or more events:\n$P(X_Y \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X_Y = 0) = 1 - e^{-0.02} \\approx 1 - 0.9802 = 0.0198$.\nThis p-value is approximately $0.02$. This is statistically significant at a conventional $\\alpha = 0.05$ level, but far less significant than the result for $G_X$. Seeing one event when $0.02$ are expected is a $1/0.02 = 50$-fold enrichment. Seeing six events is a $6/0.02 = 300$-fold enrichment. Clearly, the statistical evidence for association is much stronger for $G_X$.\n\n**2. Gene Constraint Analysis (LOEUF)**\n\nThe problem provides LOEUF scores, which quantify intolerance to LoF.\n*   **Principle 3**: Lower LOEUF indicates stronger purifying selection and greater intolerance.\n\n**Analysis for Gene $G_X$:**\n*   $LOEUF_X = 0.25$.\nThis is a low LOEUF score. Genes in the first decile of LOEUF ($LOEUF  0.35$) are considered highly constrained and are strongly enriched for causing severe dominant diseases. A LOEUF of $0.25$ means that in a large reference population (like gnomAD), the gene has only $25\\%$ of the expected LoF variants, indicating that individuals carrying such variants are selected against (i.e., they have reduced fitness, often due to disease). This is strong *a priori* evidence that $G_X$ in an important, dosage-sensitive gene.\n\n**Analysis for Gene $G_Y$:**\n*   $LOEUF_Y = 0.75$.\nThis is a high LOEUF score. It indicates that the gene is relatively tolerant to LoF variation. In the general population, it has about $75\\%$ of the expected number of LoF variants. While there might be some weak selection, the gene is not considered highly constrained. LoF variants in such genes are much less likely to cause severe dominant disorders.\n\n**3. Synthesis of Evidence**\n\nTo determine the more plausible risk gene, we must integrate both lines of evidence.\n*   **Gene $G_X$**:\n    *   **De novo evidence**: Extremely strong statistical enrichment ($k_X = 6$ vs. $\\lambda = 0.02$).\n    *   **Constraint evidence**: Very intolerant to LoF ($LOEUF_X = 0.25$), which is a typical profile for a severe dominant disease gene.\n    The two lines of evidence are concordant and both point strongly towards $G_X$ being a risk gene.\n\n*   **Gene $G_Y$**:\n    *   **De novo evidence**: Statistically significant, but much weaker, enrichment ($k_Y = 1$ vs. $\\lambda = 0.02$).\n    *   **Constraint evidence**: Tolerant to LoF ($LOEUF_Y = 0.75$), which argues *against* it being a gene where haploinsufficiency causes a severe disease.\n    The two lines of evidence are conflicting. The weak statistical signal is at odds with the population-level data suggesting the gene is non-essential. While a single de novo LoF event in a patient could still be causal, the *a priori* evidence from LOEUF makes this less likely compared to $G_X$.\n\n**Conclusion**: Gene $G_X$ is the more plausible candidate. It has both highly significant enrichment of de novo LoF mutations in the disease cohort and a gene-level constraint metric (low LOEUF) that is characteristic of known NDD genes.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's now evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. $G_X$ is more plausible: its lower LOEUF ($0.25$) indicates stronger intolerance, and the observed $k_X = 6$ de novo LoF variants represent a highly significant enrichment over the Poisson expectation $\\lambda = 0.02$.**\n\n*   This option correctly identifies $G_X$ as more plausible.\n*   It correctly interprets the low LOEUF of $0.25$ as indicating stronger intolerance (constraint).\n*   It correctly identifies the observed $k_X = 6$ as a significant enrichment over the calculated expectation of $\\lambda = 0.02$.\n*   The reasoning integrates both pieces of evidence correctly and aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $G_Y$ is more plausible: its higher LOEUF ($0.75$) indicates greater tolerance to LoF in the general population, making any observed de novo LoF more likely to be pathogenic.**\n\n*   This option incorrectly identifies $G_Y$ as more plausible.\n*   The premise of the reasoning is flawed. It correctly states that high LOEUF means greater tolerance, but then makes the illogical leap that this makes de novo LoF *more* likely to be pathogenic. The opposite is true. A gene that is tolerant to LoF in the general population is, by definition, less likely to cause a severe disease when LoF occurs. Pathogenicity and tolerance are inversely related for dominant diseases.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Neither gene is plausible: with only $k_X = 6$ and $k_Y = 1$ events, the sample is too small to infer risk relative to the expectation.**\n\n*   This option dismisses the evidence. While $k_Y=1$ is a single event, $k_X = 6$ is not a small number *relative to the expectation*. The expectation is $\\lambda = 0.02$. Observing $6$ events when $0.02$ are expected is a massive signal and is statistically very powerful. In modern genetics, observing even $3-5$ de novo events in a constrained gene can be sufficient to establish a robust gene-disease association. Therefore, claiming the sample is too small, especially for $G_X$, is incorrect.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both genes are equally plausible: they have the same mutational target size and at least one de novo LoF event, so LOEUF differences are not informative.**\n\n*   This option wrongly claims equal plausibility. It ignores the vast difference in the statistical evidence ($k_X = 6$ vs. $k_Y = 1$) and wrongly dismisses the LOEUF score. The LOEUF score is a critical piece of orthogonal evidence that provides an *a priori* probability of a gene being disease-causing via a LoF mechanism. A low LOEUF score dramatically increases the prior probability. Stating that LOEUF differences are \"not informative\" is factually wrong and contrary to the principles of modern gene discovery.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Undecidable from genetics alone: without brain-specific expression data, de novo enrichment and LOEUF cannot prioritize $G_X$ versus $G_Y$.**\n\n*   This option introduces an external, unnecessary criterion. While brain expression data would add *more* evidence, it is not required to prioritize these genes based on the given information. The combination of strong statistical enrichment in a disease cohort and high gene-level constraint is already extremely powerful evidence. We can, and routinely do, prioritize genes based on these genetic data alone. Claiming it is \"undecidable\" is too strong and incorrect. The data clearly points to $G_X$ as being *more plausible*.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5040458"}]}
