It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in medical genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequencies from first principles begins with the state of the gene pool from which the next generation's zygotes will be formed. In this pool of gametes (sperm and eggs), the frequency of the normal allele $A$ is given as $p$, and the frequency of the deleterious allele $a$ is given as $q$. By definition, since these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\nThe principle of random mating implies that gametes unite to form zygotes randomly and in proportion to their frequencies in the gamete pool. The formation of a diploid zygote is the result of two independent probabilistic events: the selection of one allele from the male gamete pool and the selection of one allele from the female gamete pool. We can use the multiplication rule for independent probabilities to determine the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the next generation.\n\n- **Frequency of the homozygous normal genotype ($AA$)**: A zygote will have the genotype $AA$ if it is formed from the union of a sperm carrying allele $A$ and an egg carrying allele $A$. The probability of randomly selecting an $A$ sperm is $p$, and the probability of randomly selecting an $A$ egg is also $p$. Since these are independent events, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$ \\text{Frequency}(AA) = P(A \\text{ from male}) \\times P(A \\text{ from female}) = p \\times p = p^2 $$\n\n- **Frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$)**: Similarly, a zygote will have the genotype $aa$ if it is formed from the union of a sperm carrying allele $a$ and an egg carrying allele $a$. The probability of randomly selecting an $a$ sperm is $q$, and the probability of randomly selecting an $a$ egg is also $q$. The combined probability is:\n$$ \\text{Frequency}(aa) = P(a \\text{ from male}) \\times P(a \\text{ from female}) = q \\times q = q^2 $$\n\n- **Frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$)**: A zygote will be heterozygous ($Aa$) if it is formed in one of two mutually exclusive ways:\n    1. A sperm carrying allele $A$ fertilizes an egg carrying allele $a$. The probability of this event is $P(A \\text{ from male}) \\times P(a \\text{ from female}) = p \\times q = pq$.\n    2. A sperm carrying allele $a$ fertilizes an egg carrying allele $A$. The probability of this event is $P(a \\text{ from male}) \\times P(A \\text{ from female}) = q \\times p = qp$.\nThe total frequency of the heterozygous genotype is the sum of the probabilities of these two distinct events.\n$$ \\text{Frequency}(Aa) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq $$\n\nThus, the expected genotype frequencies in the population under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium are:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $p^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $2pq$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $q^2$\nAs a consistency check, the sum of these frequencies must equal $1$: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2$. Since $p+q=1$, we have $(1)^2 = 1$, which confirms the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected incidence of the disease. The disease is autosomal recessive and fully penetrant for the $aa$ genotype. Therefore, the incidence of the disease is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype.\n$$ \\text{Incidence} = \\text{Frequency}(aa) = q^2 $$\nWe are given the frequency of the deleterious allele $a$ as $q = 0.02$. We can now compute the incidence.\n$$ \\text{Incidence} = (0.02)^2 = 0.02 \\times 0.02 = 0.0004 $$\nThe final answer is a single real number in decimal form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0004}$$", "id": "5074798"}, {"introduction": "Genetic counseling translates complex genetic data into practical risk assessments for individuals and families.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $C$ be the event that the woman is a carrier (genotype $X^MX^m$) and $\\neg C$ be the event that she is not a carrier (genotype $X^MX^M$).

The probability of a negative test for a carrier (a false negative) is $P(N|C) = 1 - s = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\nThe test specificity is perfect, so the probability of a negative test for a non-carrier is $P(N|\\neg C) = 1$.\n\nWe must first calculate the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier, given her negative test result, which is $P(C|N)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C|N) = \\frac{P(N|C)P(C)}{P(N)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(N)$, is the total probability of a negative test result, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(N) = P(N|C)P(C) + P(N|\\neg C)P(\\neg C)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(N) = (0.02)(1 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1)(1 - 1 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$P(N) = 2 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.9999 = 0.999902$$\nNow we can compute the posterior probability:\n$$P(C|N) = \\frac{(0.02)(1 \\times 10^{-4})}{0.999902} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.999902}$$\n\n**1. Probability of an affected son**\nA son inherits his Y chromosome from his father and one X chromosome from his mother. The father's genotype is $X^mY$. The son's phenotype for an X-linked trait is determined solely by the X chromosome inherited from his mother. A son will be affected (genotype $X^mY$) if his mother is a carrier ($X^MX^m$) and passes the $X^m$ allele to him. The probability of a heterozygous mother transmitting a specific allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe risk for a son to be affected is conditional on the mother's updated (posterior) carrier status:\n$$P(\\text{Son affected}) = P(\\text{Son inherits } X^m \\text{ from mother})$$\n$$P(\\text{Son affected}) = P(\\text{mother is carrier } | N) \\times P(\\text{transmits } X^m | \\text{is carrier})$$\n$$P(\\text{Son affected}) = P(C|N) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(\\text{Son affected}) = \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.999902}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.999902}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$P(\\text{Son affected}) \\approx 1.000098 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the probability is $1.000 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n**2. Probability of an affected daughter**\nA daughter inherits one X chromosome from her father and one from her mother. The father ($X^mY$) will pass his $X^m$ allele to all of his daughters with a probability of $1$. For a daughter to be clinically affected with this X-linked recessive disorder, she must be homozygous for the mutant allele, i.e., have the genotype $X^mX^m$. This requires her to inherit the $X^m$ allele from her father (probability $1$) and also inherit the $X^m$ allele from her mother.\nThe probability of a daughter inheriting $X^m$ from her mother is identical to the calculation for an affected son:\n$$P(\\text{Daughter inherits } X^m \\text{ from mother}) = P(C|N) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTherefore, the probability of a daughter being affected (genotype $X^mX^m$) is:\n$$P(\\text{Daughter affected}) = P(\\text{inherits } X^m \\text{ from father}) \\times P(\\text{inherits } X^m \\text{ from mother})$$\n$$P(\\text{Daughter affected}) = 1 \\times \\left(P(C|N) \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} P(C|N)$$\nThis value is numerically identical to the risk for an affected son:\n$$P(\\text{Daughter affected}) = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.999902} \\approx 1.000098 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the probability is $1.000 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n**3. Histology Prediction**\nThe problem statement provides the essential biological link: \"loss-of-function in CD40L ... impairs ... germinal center formation.\" Germinal centers are specialized microstructures within secondary lymphoid organs where B cells undergo proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and class-switch recombination. This process is critically dependent on T-cell help, mediated by the interaction between CD40L on activated T cells and CD40 on B cells. In an affected individual with HIGM1, this interaction is defective. Consequently, germinal center formation is severely impaired or absent.\nThe required encoding is:\n- $0$: “germinal centers absent or severely hypoplastic”\n- $1$: “germinal centers present and well formed”\nBased on the given pathophysiology, the prediction for an affected individual is that germinal centers will be absent or severely hypoplastic.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Immunophenotype for Complete RAG1 Loss-of-Function**\n\nThe problem specifies a \"biallelic null mutation in recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1)\". According to the Central Dogma of molecular biology, this means no functional RAG1 protein can be synthesized. The RAG1 protein, in a complex with the RAG2 protein, functions as an endonuclease that is indispensable for initiating Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) segment recombination, or V(D)J recombination.\n\nThe ordered process of V(D)J recombination begins with the RAG complex recognizing and binding to specific DNA motifs called recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that flank the V, D, and J gene segments. The RAG complex then introduces a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) between the RSS and the coding segment. This is the **cleavage step**, which is the absolute first step in the recombination process.\n\nThe problem mandates that we treat antigen receptor expression as a prerequisite for the maturation of T and B lymphocytes.\n- For T lymphocytes, the assembly of a functional T cell receptor (TCR), composed of $\\alpha\\beta$ or $\\gamma\\delta$ chains, is dependent on successful V(D)J recombination of the corresponding `TRA`, `TRB`, `TRG`, and `TRD` gene loci.\n- For B lymphocytes, the assembly of a functional B cell receptor (BCR), a membrane-bound form of immunoglobulin (Ig), is dependent on successful V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy (`IGH`) and light (`IGK` or `IGL`) chain loci.\n\nIn the case of a complete loss of RAG1 function, the initial cleavage step of V(D)J recombination is blocked. No DSBs are created at the antigen receptor loci. Consequently, no gene rearrangement can occur, and no functional TCR or BCR proteins can be produced. Developing T cells (thymocytes) and B cells (pro-B/pre-B cells) fail to pass the developmental checkpoints that require signaling through a pre-TCR or pre-BCR/BCR, respectively. This failure leads to developmental arrest and apoptosis of these lymphocyte precursors. The result is a profound absence of mature T and B cells in the peripheral circulation. This phenotype is denoted as $T^{-}$ and $B^{-}$.\n\nThe problem also stipulates that Natural Killer (NK) cell development is independent of V(D)J recombination. The development and maturation of NK cells follow a distinct pathway that does not require gene rearrangement. Therefore, a defect in RAG1 does not affect NK cell counts. This is denoted as $NK^{+}$.\n\nCombining these results, the predicted immunophenotype for a complete, biallelic loss of RAG1 function is $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$. This corresponds to a classic presentation of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), consistent with the clinical information provided (recurrent infections, lymphopenia, absent TRECs).\n\n**Step 2: Contrast with Artemis (DCLRE1C) Deficiency**\n\nTo contrast this with an Artemis (`DCLRE1C`) deficiency, we must map the functions of RAG1 and Artemis onto the dependency graph of V(D)J recombination steps.\n1.  **Initiation/Cleavage**: The RAG1/RAG2 complex introduces a DSB, resulting in two types of DNA ends: a covalently sealed \"hairpin\" on the coding end and a blunt \"signal\" end. This is where RAG1 acts.\n2.  **End Processing/Repair**: The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway repairs the breaks. A key step involves the Artemis protein, which, after activation by DNA-PKcs, functions as an endonuclease to open the hairpin coding ends. Other NHEJ factors (Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, Ligase IV) then process and ligate the ends. This is where Artemis acts.\n\nIn an Artemis deficiency, the RAG complex is functional and successfully completes the cleavage step (Step 1). However, the resulting hairpin coding ends cannot be opened (a failure in Step 2). This also aborts the recombination process, leading to the same outcome as RAG1 deficiency: no functional TCRs or BCRs can be produced, T and B cell development is arrested, and NK cell development is normal. Therefore, the immunophenotype of Artemis deficiency is also $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$.\n\nThe critical distinction lies in the broader biological role of these proteins.\n- The function of RAG1 is almost exclusively confined to initiating V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes. Cells from a RAG1-deficient individual do not have a general defect in DNA repair.\n- Artemis, however, is a core component of the general NHEJ pathway. This pathway is responsible for repairing DSBs arising from various sources, including DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Because Artemis is a general NHEJ factor, all cells in an Artemis-deficient individual (e.g., fibroblasts) are unable to properly repair IR-induced DSBs. This manifests as cellular and clinical hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.\n\nThus, the key contrasting property is that Artemis deficiency causes a radiosensitive SCID due to its role in the general NHEJ pathway, whereas RAG1 deficiency causes a non-radiosensitive SCID because its function is specific to initiating lymphocyte antigen receptor gene recombination.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Complete RAG1 loss-of-function yields $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$ because recombination fails at the cleavage step; Artemis deficiency yields $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$ as well, but unlike RAG1 deficiency, Artemis-deficient fibroblasts are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation due to a broad non-homologous end joining defect.**\n- The predicted phenotype for RAG1 deficiency, $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$, is correct.\n- The reason, failure at the cleavage step, is correct.\n- The phenotype for Artemis deficiency, $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{+}$, is also correct.\n- The contrasting property, radiosensitivity in Artemis deficiency due to a broad NHEJ defect, is the precise distinction derived from first principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Complete RAG1 loss-of-function yields $T^{-}B^{+}NK^{-}$ because only T cell receptor genes require recombination; Artemis deficiency yields $T^{-}B^{-}NK^{-}$ because it is upstream of recombination and affects all lymphocytes equally.**\n- The RAG1 phenotype $T^{-}B^{+}NK^{-}$ is incorrect.
