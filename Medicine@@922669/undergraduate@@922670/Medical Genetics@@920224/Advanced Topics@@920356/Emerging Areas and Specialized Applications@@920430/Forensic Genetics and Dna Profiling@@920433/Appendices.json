A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary objective is to calculate the Random Match Probability (RMP) for a three-locus DNA profile. The RMP is defined as the probability that a randomly selected, unrelated individual from a reference population will have a DNA profile identical to the evidence profile by chance.\n\nThe derivation begins from the first principles of probability theory. Let $G_1$, $G_2$, and $G_3$ be the events that a random individual from the population has the specific genotype observed at locus $1$, locus $2$, and locus $3$, respectively. The genotype frequencies provided in the problem statement correspond to the probabilities of these individual events:\n- Probability of having the genotype at locus $1$: $P(G_1) = f_1 = 0.02$.\n- Probability of having the genotype at locus $2$: $P(G_2) = f_2 = 0.05$.\n- Probability of having the genotype at locus $3$: $P(G_3) = f_3 = 0.01$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the probability of observing all three of these genotypes in a single individual, which is the probability of the intersection of these events, $P(G_1 \\cap G_2 \\cap G_3)$.\n\nA critical assumption provided is that the loci are in linkage equilibrium. In the context of population genetics, this means that the allele present at one locus is statistically independent of the allele present at another locus. Consequently, the event of possessing a specific genotype at one locus is independent of the event of possessing a specific genotype at another locus.\n\nFor a set of mutually independent events, the probability of their joint occurrence is the product of their individual probabilities. This is known as the product rule of probability. Applying this rule to the three independent loci, the multilocus RMP is:\n$$ \\text{RMP} = P(G_1 \\cap G_2 \\cap G_3) = P(G_1) \\times P(G_2) \\times P(G_3) $$\n\nSubstituting the given genotype frequencies into this equation:\n$$ \\text{RMP} = f_1 \\times f_2 \\times f_3 $$\n$$ \\text{RMP} = 0.02 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.01 $$\n\nTo compute this product and express it in scientific notation, we can write each term in scientific notation first:\n$$ \\text{RMP} = (2 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-2}) $$\nMultiplying the coefficients and adding the exponents of $10$:\n$$ \\text{RMP} = (2 \\times 5 \\times 1) \\times 10^{(-2) + (-2) + (-2)} $$\n$$ \\text{RMP} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n\nTo conform to standard scientific notation where the coefficient is greater than or equal to $1$ and less than $10$, we adjust the expression:\n$$ \\text{RMP} = 1 \\times 10^1 \\times 10^{-6} = 1 \\times 10^{1-6} = 1 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThe multilocus Random Match Probability for the three-locus profile is $1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\n### Interpretation of the Result\nThe calculated RMP of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ is the estimated frequency of this specific three-locus DNA profile in the reference population. This value can be interpreted as a ratio:\n$$ 1 \\times 10^{-5} = \\frac{1}{10^5} = \\frac{1}{100,000} $$\nThis interpretation means that, on average, one would expect to encounter this exact DNA profile by chance in approximately one out of every $100,000$ unrelated individuals from the source population.

Contributors are independent (unrelated).\n-   **Allele Frequencies**: The population frequencies for alleles $10$, $11$, and $12$ are $p_{10}$, $p_{11}$, and $p_{12}$, respectively. Other alleles exist but were not observed.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the following criteria:\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of forensic genetics and population genetics. The concepts of STRs, alleles, genotypes, DNA mixtures, HWE, and probability calculations for evidence are central to the field. The simplifying assumptions (no drop-out, etc.) are standard for foundational problems in this domain. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined.

There are no subjective or metaphorical statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing information, ambiguity). The setup is a classic, textbook example of mixture deconvolution under idealized conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the full derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine the set of possible genotypes for the unknown contributor under the prosecution hypothesis ($H_p$) and to calculate the probability of the evidence given this hypothesis, $P(E \\mid H_p)$.\n\nLet $A_{obs}$ be the set of observed alleles in the mixture, $A_{POI}$ be the set of alleles from the Person of Interest, and $A_U$ be the set of alleles from the unknown contributor.\n\n1.  **Identify Allele Contributions**:\n    -   The observed allele set is $A_{obs} = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n    -   The POI has genotype $(10, 12)$, so their allele set is $A_{POI} = \\{10, 12\\}$.\n    -   Under the assumption of perfect detection and no drop-in/drop-out, the observed alleles are the union of the contributors' alleles: $A_{obs} = A_{POI} \\cup A_U$.\n\n2.  **Determine Constraints on the Unknown Contributor's Genotype**:\n    -   To account for all the observed alleles, the unknown contributor must supply any alleles present in $A_{obs}$ but not in $A_{POI}$. The set of such alleles is $A_{obs} \\setminus A_{POI} = \\{10, 11, 12\\} \\setminus \\{10, 12\\} = \\{11\\}$. Therefore, the unknown contributor **must** possess allele $11$.\n    -   The unknown contributor cannot possess any alleles that were not observed in the mixture. This means the alleles of the unknown, $A_U$, must be a subset of $A_{obs} = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n    -   Combining these constraints, the unknown contributor must have a genotype $(a, b)$ where at least one allele is $11$, and both alleles $a$ and $b$ are from the set $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n\n3.  **Enumerate Compatible Genotypes for the Unknown Contributor (U)**:\n    -   **Case 1: U is homozygous.** The only possibility that includes allele $11$ is the genotype $(11, 11)$. Let's check consistency: If $G_U = (11, 11)$, then $A_U = \\{11\\}$. The union is $A_{POI} \\cup A_U = \\{10, 12\\} \\cup \\{11\\} = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$, which matches $A_{obs}$. This genotype is compatible.\n    -   **Case 2: U is heterozygous.** The genotype must include allele $11$ and another allele from $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$. The other allele cannot be $11$ (that would be the homozygous case).\n        -   If the other allele is $10$, the genotype is $(10, 11)$. If $G_U = (10, 11)$, then $A_U = \\{10, 11\\}$. The union is $A_{POI} \\cup A_U = \\{10, 12\\} \\cup \\{10, 11\\} = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$, which matches $A_{obs}$. This genotype is compatible.\n        -   If the other allele is $12$, the genotype is $(11, 12)$. If $G_U = (11, 12)$, then $A_U = \\{11, 12\\}$. The union is $A_{POI} \\cup A_U = \\{10, 12\\} \\cup \\{11, 12\\} = \\{10, 11, 12\\}$, which matches $A_{obs}$. This genotype is compatible.\n    -   A genotype such as $(10, 12)$ for the unknown is incompatible, as it would not contribute allele $11$, resulting in a mixture profile of $\\{10, 12\\}$.\n\n    Thus, the set of compatible genotypes for the unknown contributor is $\\{(11, 11), (10, 11), (11, 12)\\}$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Probability $P(E \\mid H_p)$**:\n    -   $P(E \\mid H_p)$ is the probability that a randomly selected, unrelated individual from the reference population has one of these compatible genotypes.\n    -   We assume Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The genotype frequencies are:\n        -   Frequency of genotype $(11, 11)$ is $p_{11}^2$.\n        -   Frequency of genotype $(10, 11)$ is $2p_{10}p_{11}$.\n        -   Frequency of genotype $(11, 12)$ is $2p_{11}p_{12}$.\n    -   Since these are mutually exclusive genotypes, the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n        $$ P(E \\mid H_p) = P(G_U=(11,11)) + P(G_U=(10,11)) + P(G_U=(11,12)) $$\n        $$ P(E \\mid H_p) = p_{11}^2 + 2p_{10}p_{11} + 2p_{11}p_{12} $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Unknown genotypes: $(11,11)$, $(10,11)$, $(11,12)$. Computation: $P(E \\mid H_p) = p_{11}^2 + 2 p_{10} p_{11} + 2 p_{11} p_{12}$.**\n-   The list of compatible genotypes for the unknown contributor is correct, as derived above.\n-   The computation for the probability is also correct, summing the HWE frequencies for the listed genotypes.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Unknown genotypes: $(10,10)$, $(12,12)$, $(10,12)$. Computation: $P(E \\mid H_p) = p_{10}^2 + p_{12}^2 + 2 p_{10} p_{12}$.**\n-   The list of genotypes is incorrect. None of these genotypes would contribute allele $11$ to the mixture, which is required to explain the observed evidence.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Unknown genotypes: $(11,11)$, $(10,11)$, $(11,12)$, $(10,12)$. Computation: $P(E \\mid H_p) = p_{11}^2 + 2 p_{10} p_{11} + 2 p_{11} p_{12} + 2 p_{10} p_{12}$.**\n-   The list of genotypes is incorrect. It erroneously includes genotype $(10, 12)$. If the unknown contributor had genotype $(10, 12)$, the union of alleles with the POI would be $\\{10, 12\\} \\cup \\{10, 12\\} = \\{10, 12\\}$, which is inconsistent with the observed mixture profile $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Unknown genotypes: $(11,11)$ only. Computation: $P(E \\mid H_p) = p_{11}^2$.**\n-   The list of genotypes is incomplete. While $(11, 11)$ is a possible genotype for the unknown, it neglects the other compatible heterozygous genotypes $(10, 11)$ and $(11, 12)$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Unknown genotypes: $(11,11)$, $(10,11)$, $(11,12)$.

It provides a realistic scenario for evaluating the statistical interpretation of DNA evidence.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the correct application and interpretation of probabilities in a forensic context. Let $M$ be the event of a DNA match between the suspect and the crime scene evidence. Let $S$ be the proposition that the suspect is the source of the crime scene DNA, and $S^c$ be the proposition that the suspect is not the source (i.e., is \"innocent\" with respect to being the source). The problem provides the following:\n- Random Match Probability (RMP): This is the probability of a match given the person is not the source, $P(M|S^c) = 10^{-6}$.\n- The probability of a match given the person is the source: $P(M|S) \\approx 1$.\n- The Likelihood Ratio (LR) is the ratio of these probabilities, quantifying the weight of the evidence:\n$$ LR = \\frac{P(M|S)}{P(M|S^c)} = \\frac{1}{10^{-6}} = 10^6 $$\nThis high LR indicates that a match is one million times more likely if the suspect is the source than if they are not. We use these principles to evaluate each statement.\n\nA. Saying “the probability that the suspect is innocent given the DNA match is $10^{-6}$” is an example of the prosecutor’s fallacy when it is based solely on the RMP.\nThis statement translates to saying $P(S^c|M) = 10^{-6}$. The RMP is given as $10^{-6}$, but it represents $P(M|S^c)$. The prosecutor's fallacy is the error of equating $P(S^c|M)$ with $P(M|S^c)$, i.e., \"transposing the conditional\". To calculate $P(S^c|M)$, one must use Bayes' theorem and incorporate a prior probability, $P(S^c)$. Stating that $P(S^c|M)$ is equal to the RMP is the very definition of this logical error.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. In the database-trawl context with database size $5\\times 10^6$ and RMP $10^{-6}$, the expected number of adventitious (chance) matches is about $5$, so claiming that a unique hit eliminates the possibility of a coincidental match is unwarranted.\nLet $N$ be the size of the database, $N = 5 \\times 10^6$. Let $p$ be the RMP, $p = 10^{-6}$. Assuming the true perpetrator is not in the database, the number of adventitious matches follows a binomial distribution $B(N, p)$. The expected number of matches, $E[X]$, is given by $N \\times p$.\n$$ E[X] = (5 \\times 10^6) \\times 10^{-6} = 5 $$\nThis calculation shows that we expect to find approximately $5$ individuals in the database who match the crime scene profile purely by chance. The observation of a \"single hit\" does not invalidate this expectation; it simply means the observed outcome was $1$ when the expected value was $5$. More importantly, it highlights that the discovered match could very well be one of these expected coincidental matches. Therefore, the claim that this single hit *proves* the person is the source and eliminates the possibility of coincidence is logically and statistically unwarranted. The act of searching the database must be accounted for when assessing the weight of the evidence.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. In the targeted-suspect context, if non-DNA information implies prior odds of “suspect is the source” to “someone else is the source” of $1:999$, then combining the DNA evidence with RMP $10^{-6}$ yields posterior odds of approximately $1001:1$ that the suspect is the source, illustrating correct integration of prior information and avoiding both fallacies.\nThis statement proposes a calculation using the odds form of Bayes' theorem: Posterior Odds = Prior Odds $\\times$ LR.\nThe prior odds are given as $\\frac{P(S)}{P(S^c)} = \\frac{1}{999}$.\nThe Likelihood Ratio (LR) was calculated above as $LR = 10^6$.\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{P(S|M)}{P(S^c|M)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{999}\\right) \\times 10^6 = \\frac{1,000,000}{999} $$\nCalculating the value: $1,000,000 \\div 999 \\approx 1001.001$. This gives posterior odds of approximately $1001:1$. This calculation correctly applies Bayes' theorem, integrating the prior information (from non-DNA evidence) with the statistical weight of the DNA evidence (the LR). This avoids the prosecutor's fallacy (by not ignoring the prior) and the defense attorney's fallacy (by acknowledging the strong probative value of the evidence).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Because a city may have $10^7$ residents and the RMP is $10^{-6}$, there will be about $10$ matching individuals; therefore the DNA evidence has no probative value and should be excluded.\nThis is the classic defense attorney's fallacy. The premise that in a population of $N_p = 10^7$, the expected number of random matches is $N_p \\times \\text{RMP} = 10^7 \\times 10^{-6} = 10$ is correct. However, the conclusion that the evidence \"has no probative value\" is false. The evidence is extremely probative because it reduces the pool of potential suspects from $10,000,000$ to approximately $10$. This is a reduction by a factor of one million. The likelihood ratio of $10^6$ confirms the immense strength of this evidence. To argue that because the evidence is not absolutely conclusive (i.e., does not uniquely identify one person with certainty), it has *no* value is a severe logical error.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

Expressing weight as an LR: This separates the role of the scientist (evaluating the evidence under competing hypotheses) from the role of the trier of fact (determining the probability of guilt, which requires considering priors).\n2. Stating conditioning: The RMP and its interpretation are highly dependent on the chosen reference population and the investigative context (a targeted suspect has a different prior probability than a database-trawl hit). Transparency about these assumptions is critical for correct evaluation.\n3. Avoiding statements on guilt/innocence: The scientist's role is not to opine on the ultimate issue. The posterior probability of guilt, $P(S|M)$, depends on the prior probability, $P(S)$, which is based on all non-scientific evidence in the case and is the domain of the court, not the lab.
