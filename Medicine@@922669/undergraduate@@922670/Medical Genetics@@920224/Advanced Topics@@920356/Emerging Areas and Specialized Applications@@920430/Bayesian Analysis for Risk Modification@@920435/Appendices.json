This practice grounds Bayesian reasoning in the fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance. By working through this classic genetic counseling scenario, you will apply conditional probability to determine a sibling's carrier risk for an autosomal recessive condition, a foundational skill that demonstrates how a pedigree is itself a powerful form of evidence [@problem_id:5016302].", "problem": "In a family, an autosomal recessive disease is caused by a pathogenic allele $a$ at a single locus with complete penetrance and no de novo mutation. Let the normal allele be $A$. Both parents are clinically unaffected. The family has an affected child (the proband), and another child (a sibling) who is confirmed clinically unaffected. Under autosomal recessive inheritance, conditional on both parents being heterozygous carriers $Aa$, the genotype distribution among their offspring follows the well-tested Mendelian segregation ratio: $AA$ with probability $1/4$, $Aa$ with probability $1/2$, and $aa$ with probability $1/4$. Assume independence of siblings conditional on parental genotypes and that phenotype is fully determined by genotype under the stated assumptions.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and the recessive model, and explicitly accounting for the genotype distribution among siblings implied by the observation of an affected proband and unaffected parents, compute the posterior probability that the unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier $Aa$. Express your final answer as a single exact fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability that an unaffected sibling of an affected individual is a heterozygous carrier for an autosomal recessive disease, given the family history. The solution requires a rigorous application of Mendelian genetics and conditional probability, specifically Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we must establish the genotypes of the parents. The disease is autosomal recessive, caused by the pathogenic allele $a$. The normal allele is $A$. The possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n- $AA$: Clinically unaffected.\n- $Aa$: Clinically unaffected (heterozygous carrier).\n- $aa$: Clinically affected.\n\nThe problem states that the parents are clinically unaffected but have an affected child.\n1.  An affected child must have the genotype $aa$.\n2.  To have a genotype of $aa$, the child must inherit one $a$ allele from each parent.\n3.  Since both parents are clinically unaffected, their genotype cannot be $aa$.\n4.  The only way for two unaffected parents to each contribute an $a$ allele is if both are heterozygous carriers, with genotype $Aa$.\n\nTherefore, the parental cross is unambiguously identified as $Aa \\times Aa$. The problem statement confirms this premise by mentioning that calculations are \"conditional on both parents being heterozygous carriers $Aa$\".\n\nAccording to Mendelian laws of segregation for an $Aa \\times Aa$ cross, the prior probabilities for the genotype of any offspring are:\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the sibling is a heterozygous carrier ($Aa$), given that this sibling is clinically unaffected. Let us define the relevant events concerning this sibling:\n-   Let $C$ be the event that the sibling is a heterozygous carrier (genotype $Aa$).\n-   Let $U$ be the event that the sibling is clinically unaffected.\n\nWe are asked to compute the conditional probability $P(C | U)$.\n\nThe problem states \"independence of siblings conditional on parental genotypes\". Once the parental genotypes are established as $Aa \\times Aa$, the genotype of the proband provides no further information about the genotype of the sibling. The sibling's genotype is an independent draw from the probability distribution of offspring from an $Aa \\times Aa$ cross.\n\nWe can apply Bayes' theorem, or more directly, the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(C | U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)}$$\n\nLet's evaluate the probabilities in this formula.\n\nThe numerator, $P(C \\cap U)$, is the probability that the sibling is a carrier AND is unaffected. For an autosomal recessive disease with complete penetrance, a heterozygous carrier ($Aa$) is by definition clinically unaffected. Therefore, the event $C$ is a subset of the event $U$, and their intersection $C \\cap U$ is simply the event $C$.\nSo, the probability of the numerator is the prior probability that the sibling is a carrier:\n$$P(C \\cap U) = P(C) = P(\\text{genotype} = Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(U)$, is the probability that the sibling is clinically unaffected. An individual is unaffected if their genotype is either $AA$ or $Aa$. These are mutually exclusive events.\n$$P(U) = P(\\text{genotype} = AA \\text{ or genotype} = Aa) = P(\\text{genotype} = AA) + P(\\text{genotype} = Aa)$$\nSubstituting the Mendelian probabilities:\n$$P(U) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nNow we can compute the desired posterior probability by substituting the values for the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(C | U) = \\frac{P(C)}{P(U)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}}$$\n$$P(C | U) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the posterior probability that the unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier is $\\frac{2}{3}$. The information about the affected proband was crucial to determine the parental genotypes as $Aa \\times Aa$, but due to conditional independence, does not alter the probabilities for the sibling beyond that. The sample space for the unaffected sibling is restricted to the genotypes $\\{AA, Aa\\}$, which have prior probabilities in the ratio $1/4 : 1/2$, or $1:2$. Normalizing these probabilities gives a $1/3$ chance of being $AA$ and a $2/3$ chance of being $Aa$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "5016302"}, {"introduction": "Moving from family history to clinical testing, this exercise demonstrates how to formally update a patient's risk using data from a genetic assay.

You are asked to integrate two independent lines of genetic evidence—segregation in an extended pedigree and confirmed de novo status of the proband’s variant—into a single Bayesian analysis to update the probability that the variant is pathogenic.\n\nUse the following scientifically grounded starting points.\n\n1. Bayes’ theorem in odds form: posterior odds equal prior odds multiplied by the combined likelihood ratio, where independent evidence contributes multiplicatively to the total likelihood ratio.\n2. The definition of a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score in linkage and co-segregation analysis: the LOD score is the base-$10$ logarithm of a likelihood ratio for the observed pedigree data under a pathogenic model versus a benign model.\n3. A de novo event can be treated as a probabilistic observation whose evidential weight is the ratio of its probability under the pathogenic hypothesis to its probability under the benign hypothesis.\n\nData and assumptions for this case:\n\n- The baseline, pre-evidence probability that a rare missense variant in this gene is truly pathogenic is $P_{0} = 0.02$.\n- Segregation analysis in an extended pedigree, constructed independently of the proband’s trio, yields a LOD score of $\\mathrm{LOD}_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 1.0$ for co-segregation with the disease.\n- The proband’s variant is confirmed de novo with both biological parents available and unaffected. For this gene and phenotype, the fraction of truly pathogenic variants that present as de novo in affected individuals is $\\alpha = 0.05$ (reflecting a realistic contribution of de novo pathogenic variants in this disorder).

We will use Bayes' theorem in odds form to integrate this evidence.\n\nLet $H_P$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $H_B$ be the hypothesis that the variant is benign (not pathogenic).\n\nFirst, we establish the prior odds of pathogenicity. The baseline probability that a rare missense variant in this gene is pathogenic is given as $P(H_P) = P_0 = 0.02$. The probability that it is benign is therefore $P(H_B) = 1 - P(H_P) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.
