{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can trust our methylation measurements, we must first assess the quality of the bisulfite sequencing experiment itself. A critical quality control metric is the conversion rate, which measures how efficiently unmethylated cytosines were converted to thymines. This exercise guides you through estimating this key experimental parameter and its statistical uncertainty by leveraging the biological fact that non-CpG cytosines are almost entirely unmethylated, providing a built-in control for the procedure.", "problem": "In sodium bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite sequencing), unmethylated cytosines are deaminated to uracil and sequenced as thymine, while methylated cytosines resist conversion and are sequenced as cytosine. In mammalian somatic tissues, non-CpG contexts (that is, cytosines not followed by guanine) are typically negligibly methylated under physiological conditions. Therefore, cytosine observations in non-CpG contexts largely reflect failures of conversion rather than true methylation.\n\nA laboratory performs bisulfite sequencing on a human blood sample. Across all reads, they tally non-CpG cytosine positions and observe that out of a total of $n = 50{,}000$ non-CpG cytosine positions covered, $k = 600$ are called as cytosine (rather than thymine). Assume each non-CpG cytosine observation represents an independent Bernoulli trial with probability $p$ that an unmethylated cytosine fails to convert and remains a cytosine call.

It provides a complete and consistent setup for a standard problem in statistical inference applied to genomics.\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations based on the binomial model of bisulfite sequencing conversion failure. We are given the total number of non-CpG cytosine positions, $n = 50{,}000$, and the number of observed cytosine calls (failures of conversion), $k = 600$.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of unconverted cytosine calls. We model $K$ as a binomial random variable, $K \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$, where $n$ is the number of trials (non-CpG cytosine positions) and $p$ is the probability of a conversion failure for any given trial. The probability mass function (PMF) for observing $k$ failures in $n$ trials is given by:\n$$P(K=k | n, p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Estimator $\\hat{p}$**\n\nTo derive an estimator for $p$, we use the method of maximum likelihood. The likelihood function $L(p | k, n)$ is the probability of observing the data, $k$, as a function of the parameter $p$.\n$$L(p | k, n) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nMaximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing its natural logarithm, the log-likelihood function $\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p))$. This simplifies the calculus by converting products into sums.\n$$\\ell(p) = \\ln \\left( \\binom{n}{k} \\right) + k \\ln(p) + (n-k) \\ln(1-p)$$\nTo find the value of $p$ that maximizes $\\ell(p)$, we take the first derivative with respect to $p$ and set it to zero. The term $\\ln \\binom{n}{k}$ is a constant with respect to $p$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ \\ln \\binom{n}{k} + k \\ln(p) + (n-k) \\ln(1-p) \\right] = \\frac{k}{p} - \\frac{n-k}{1-p}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the maximum likelihood estimate, denoted $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\\frac{k}{\\hat{p}} - \\frac{n-k}{1-\\hat{p}} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{k}{\\hat{p}} = \\frac{n-k}{1-\\hat{p}}$$\n$$k(1-\\hat{p}) = \\hat{p}(n-k)$$\n$$k - k\\hat{p} = n\\hat{p} - k\\hat{p}$$\n$$k = n\\hat{p}$$\nSolving for $\\hat{p}$, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimator for $p$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{n}$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = -\\frac{k}{p^2} - \\frac{n-k}{(1-p)^2}$$\nSince $n > k > 0$ and $0 < p < 1$, both terms are negative, so the second derivative is always negative. This confirms that $\\hat{p} = k/n$ is indeed a maximum.\n\nUsing the given data, $n=50{,}000$ and $k=600$:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{600}{50{,}000} = \\frac{6}{500} = 0.012$$\n\n**2. Derivation and Computation of the 95% Confidence Interval**\n\nWe use large-sample likelihood theory, which states that for large $n$, the maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $p$ and variance given by the inverse of the Fisher information. For a binomial proportion, the variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\nAn approximate two-sided confidence interval for $p$ is constructed as:\n$$\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{p})$$\nwhere $\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})$ is the standard error of the estimator, and $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for a confidence level $1-\\alpha$.\n\nThe standard error is the square root of the estimated variance. We estimate the variance by substituting $\\hat{p}$ for the unknown true parameter $p$:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$$\nFor a confidence level of $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, we have $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The corresponding critical value is $z_{0.025}$, which is the upper $0.025$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. This value is approximately $1.96$.\n\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval is therefore:\n$$L, U = \\hat{p} \\pm z_{0.025} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$\\hat{p} = 0.012$\n$n = 50{,}000$\n$z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.012(1-0.012)}{50{,}000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.012(0.988)}{50{,}000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.011856}{50{,}000}} = \\sqrt{0.00000023712}$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) \\approx 0.0004869518$$\nNext, calculate the margin of error (ME):\n$$\\text{ME} = z_{0.025} \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.0004869518 \\approx 0.0009544255$$\nFinally, calculate the lower ($L$) and upper ($U$) limits of the confidence interval:\n$$L = \\hat{p} - \\text{ME} \\approx 0.012 - 0.0009544255 = 0.0110455745$$\n$$U = \\hat{p} + \\text{ME} \\approx 0.012 + 0.0009544255 = 0.0129544255$$\nRounding the final results to four significant figures as requested:\n$\\hat{p} = 0.01200$\n$L \\approx 0.01105$\n$U \\approx 0.01295$\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $[\\hat{p} \\;\\; L \\;\\; U]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.01200 & 0.01105 & 0.01295\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5016965"}, {"introduction": "Experimental artifacts, such as the incomplete conversion of unmethylated cytosines, can introduce systematic errors that skew our results. An incomplete conversion rate, even a small one, will consistently inflate the measured methylation fraction, leading to incorrect biological conclusions.

Assume there are no sequencing errors, no over-conversion of methylated cytosines, and that each read is an independent Bernoulli trial with respect to the outcome of being called cytosine. A standard estimator of methylation from reads is the observed fraction of cytosine calls, $\\hat{m} = c/n$, where $n$ is total coverage and $c$ is the number of reads observed as cytosine at this CpG.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and fundamental probability (law of total probability and expectation for Bernoulli trials), derive from first principles the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}]$ in terms of $m$ and $p$, and hence the bias $\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{m}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] - m$.

Your final answer should be only the single numerical value for the corrected methylation fraction.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and statistics, well-posed with a clear objective, and internally consistent.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expected value of the estimator $\\hat{m} = c/n$. Let $R_i$ be a Bernoulli random variable for the $i$-th read, where $R_i=1$ if the read is a cytosine (C) and $R_i=0$ if it is a thymine (T). The total number of cytosine reads, $c$, is the sum of these random variables over the $n$ total reads: $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i$.

This can be determined using the law of total probability, conditioning on the true methylation state of the CpG site from which the read originated.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that the DNA strand is methylated at the site, and $U$ be the event that it is unmethylated. The problem gives the true methylation fraction as $m$, so we have $P(M) = m$ and $P(U) = 1-m$. The event of interest is observing a cytosine read, which we denote as $C_{obs}$.\n$$\nP(C_{obs}) = P(C_{obs}|M)P(M) + P(C_{obs}|U)P(U)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- Methylated cytosines remain cytosine. This implies the probability of observing a cytosine read given the site was methylated is $P(C_{obs}|M) = 1$.\n- Unmethylated cytosines fail to convert to thymine with probability $p$, meaning they remain as cytosine. This implies the probability of observing a cytosine read given the site was unmethylated is $P(C_{obs}|U) = p$.\n\nSubstituting these probabilities into the equation:\n$$\nP(C_{obs}) = (1)(m) + (p)(1-m) = m + p - pm = m(1-p) + p\n$$\nTherefore, the expected value of the estimator $\\hat{m}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] = m(1-p) + p\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the bias of the estimator, $\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{m})$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{m}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] - m = (m(1-p) + p) - m = m - mp + p - m = p(1-m)\n$$\nThe bias is positive for $p>0$ and $m<1$, indicating that incomplete conversion leads to an overestimation of the true methylation level.\n\nTo find the bias-corrected estimator, $\\tilde{m}$, we solve the relationship for the true methylation fraction, $m$.

This chemical treatment and the subsequent sequencing outcome form the basis of methylation analysis. The statistical modeling approach is standard: the number of methylated reads ($k$) out of a total number of reads ($n$) at a specific site is fundamentally a binomial process, where the probability of success (observing a methylated read) is the true methylation fraction $m$.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The need for robust estimators is a critical, practical concern.\n6.  **Triviality:** The question is not trivial. It requires an understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff, the properties of Bayesian shrinkage estimators, the role of prior information, the asymptotic behavior of estimators, and the concept of hierarchical modeling.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, statistically well-posed, and describes a realistic and important problem in computational biology and medical genetics. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the frequentist estimator $\\hat{m}_{MLE} = k/n$ (which is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate) with a Bayesian estimator derived from the specified model.\n\n**Bayesian Framework Setup**\n\n*   **Prior:** The prior belief about the methylation fraction $m$ is modeled by a Beta distribution:\n    $$p(m) = \\mathrm{Beta}(m | \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)} m^{\\alpha-1} (1-m)^{\\beta-1}$$\n*   **Likelihood:** The probability of observing $k$ methylated reads out of $n$ total reads, given the methylation fraction $m$, is given by the Binomial probability mass function:\n    $$p(k|m, n) = \\binom{n}{k} m^k (1-m)^{n-k}$$\n*   **Posterior:** Due to the conjugacy of the Beta prior and Binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution of $m$ is also a Beta distribution. By Bayes' theorem, the posterior is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n    $$p(m|k,n,\\alpha,\\beta) \\propto p(k|m,n) p(m|\\alpha,\\beta)$$\n    $$p(m|k,n,\\alpha,\\beta) \\propto \\left( m^k (1-m)^{n-k} \\right) \\cdot \\left( m^{\\alpha-1} (1-m)^{\\beta-1} \\right)$$\n    $$p(m|k,n,\\alpha,\\beta) \\propto m^{k+\\alpha-1} (1-m)^{n-k+\\beta-1}$$\n    This is the kernel of a Beta distribution with updated parameters:\n    $$m | k, n, \\alpha, \\beta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha' = k+\\alpha, \\beta' = n-k+\\beta)$$\n\n**Bayesian Point Estimate**\n\nA common Bayesian point estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution. For a $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha', \\beta')$ distribution, the mean is $\\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha'+\\beta'}$.\nSo, the posterior mean estimator is:\n$$\\hat{m}_{Bayes} = E[m|k,n,\\alpha,\\beta] = \\frac{k+\\alpha}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}$$\n\nThis estimator can be rewritten as a weighted average of the MLE and the prior mean, $\\mu_{prior} = E[m] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}$:\n$$\\hat{m}_{Bayes} = \\frac{n}{n+\\alpha+\\beta} \\left( \\frac{k}{n} \\right) + \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{n+\\alpha+\\beta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\right)$$\n$$\\hat{m}_{Bayes} = \\left( \\frac{n}{n+\\alpha+\\beta} \\right) \\hat{m}_{MLE} + \\left( \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{n+\\alpha+\\beta} \\right) \\mu_{prior}$$\nThis form clearly shows that the Bayesian estimate is \"shrunk\" from the data-driven MLE towards the prior mean. The amount of shrinkage is determined by the relative strength of the prior (governed by $\\alpha+\\beta$, the \"pseudo-counts\" from the prior) and the data (governed by $n$, the number of reads).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**A. When coverage $n$ is small or observed counts are extreme (e.g., $k=0$ or $k=n$), a posterior estimate that shrinks toward the prior mean reduces expected mean squared error under squared loss compared to $\\hat{m}$, provided the prior reflects plausible methylation levels.**\n\nWhen coverage $n$ is small, the MLE $\\hat{m} = k/n$ can have very high variance. For instance, if $n=3$, the possible estimates are $0$, $1/3$, $2/3$, and $1$. A single stochastic read can dramatically change the estimate. The Bayesian estimator, by incorporating the prior, provides regularization. The term $\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}$ gives significant weight to the prior mean, pulling the estimate away from the potentially noisy value of $k/n$ and making it more stable.\n\nFor extreme counts like $k=0$ or $k=n$, the MLE is $\\hat{m}=0$ or $\\hat{m}=1$, respectively. These estimates are often biologically implausible (implying absolute certainty) and can cause numerical issues in downstream analyses (e.g., logit transformations). The posterior mean would be $\\frac{\\alpha}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}$ for $k=0$ and $\\frac{n+\\alpha}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}$ for $k=n$. These values are always within the open interval $(0,1)$ (for $\\alpha, \\beta > 0$), which is more realistic.\n\nThe reduction in variance from shrinkage, at the cost of introducing a small amount of bias (if the prior mean is not exactly the true value), very often leads to a lower overall mean squared error (MSE), where $\\mathrm{MSE} = \\mathrm{Variance} + \\mathrm{Bias}^2$. This is a well-known statistical phenomenon (related to James-Stein estimation). The condition \"provided the prior reflects plausible methylation levels\" is critical, as a wildly inaccurate prior could increase MSE.\n\nThis statement accurately captures a primary advantage of the Bayesian approach in low-information settings.\nThis statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. When coverage $n$ is large (formally, $n \\to \\infty$), the $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ prior dominates the likelihood, so the posterior mean is preferred to prevent overfitting to the data.**\n\nLet's examine the behavior of the posterior mean as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\hat{m}_{Bayes} = \\frac{k+\\alpha}{n+\\alpha+\\beta} = \\frac{k/n + \\alpha/n}{1 + (\\alpha+\\beta)/n}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the terms $\\alpha/n$ and $(\\alpha+\\beta)/n$ go to $0$. By the law of large numbers, $k/n \\to m$. Therefore, $\\hat{m}_{Bayes} \\to k/n \\to m$. The Bayesian estimate converges to the MLE, which in turn converges to the true parameter $m$.\nThis shows that for large $n$, the likelihood (the data) **dominates** the prior. The prior's influence becomes negligible. The statement asserts the opposite: that the prior dominates. Overfitting is a concern when the model is too complex for the amount of data available (i.e., for small $n$), not for large $n$. With large $n$, we have confidence in the data and *want* it to drive the estimate.\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect about the asymptotic properties of Bayesian inference.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. When estimates are needed genome-wide across many CpG sites with heterogeneous coverage, a hierarchical $\\mathrm{Beta}$ prior that pools information across sites yields more stable site-level estimates than $\\hat{m}$, especially for low-coverage sites.**\n\nThis statement introduces a natural and powerful extension of the basic Bayesian model: a hierarchical model. In this setup, we assume that the methylation levels $m_i$ for each site $i$ are drawn from a common prior distribution, e.g., $m_i \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$. However, instead of fixing $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, we estimate them from the data across all sites. This process is called \"empirical Bayes\" or, in a fully Bayesian treatment, involves placing a hyper-prior on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe effect is that sites with high coverage (large $n_i$) will strongly inform the genome-wide prior parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)$. This data-driven prior is then applied to all sites, including those with low coverage. For a low-coverage site, its noisy MLE, $\\hat{m}_i = k_i/n_i$, is shrunk towards the global mean estimated from all sites. This \"borrows strength\" across sites, leading to substantially more stable and reliable estimates for the low-coverage sites than if they were analyzed in isolation. This is a primary motivation for using Bayesian hierarchical models in genomics.\n\nThis statement accurately describes a key advantage of (hierarchical) Bayesian methods for high-throughput sequencing data.\nThis statement is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because bisulfite conversion is perfect, a prior is unnecessary; thus the posterior is preferred only for philosophical reasons, not for performance.**\n\nThis statement contains two major flaws. First, the premise \"bisulfite conversion is perfect\" is factually incorrect. It is a chemical process with non-zero error rates; both failure to convert unmethylated cytosines and erroneous conversion of methylated cytosines can occur, though rates are typically low. Advanced models often include parameters for these error rates.\n\nSecond, even if the chemistry were perfect, the issue of statistical sampling uncertainty remains. Observing $n$ reads is a random sample. A prior is a statistical tool used to manage this uncertainty, especially when $n$ is small. As detailed in the analysis of options A and C, using a prior provides tangible performance benefits (e.g., reduced MSE, stabilization of estimates), which are practical, not purely philosophical, advantages. The choice between statistical paradigms has real-world performance implications.\n\nThis statement rests on a false premise and draws a false conclusion.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. When informative prior knowledge is available (for example, promoter CpGs in the studied tissue are typically hypomethylated), incorporating a $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ prior is preferred to encode that information, particularly when $n$ is limited.**\n\nThis is a canonical application of Bayesian inference. The prior distribution provides a formal mechanism to incorporate existing, external knowledge into a statistical model. If prior biological research indicates that CpG sites in promoter regions are generally unmethylated (hypomethylated) in a particular tissue, one can select prior parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ that reflect this. For hypomethylation, one would choose $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that the prior mean $\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is low and the probability mass is concentrated near $0$ (e.g., $\\mathrm{Beta}(1, 10)$).\n\nThis is most impactful \"particularly when $n$ is limited.\" When data is scarce, the prior has a larger influence on the posterior, guiding the estimate towards a more plausible value than the high-variance MLE might suggest. When data is abundant (large $n$), the likelihood will overwhelm the prior, and the estimate will be driven primarily by the new data, which is desirable.\n\nThis statement correctly describes one of the fundamental strengths and purposes of the Bayesian framework.\nThis statement is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "5016930"}]}
