To confirm an association and obtain a precise effect size, researchers often combine results from multiple independent studies in a meta-analysis. This first exercise simulates this crucial step, allowing you to calculate a combined effect size for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and then determine the tiny fraction of total heritability it explains, giving you a direct, quantitative glimpse into the scale of the missing heritability problem [@problem_id:5086629].", "problem": "A complex trait in medical genetics, systolic blood pressure, has been standardized to have mean $0$ and variance $1$ across individuals. The narrow-sense heritability (additive genetic proportion of variance), estimated from pedigree-based analysis, is $h^{2}_{\\text{total}} = 0.30$. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovered in an initial Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is followed up in two independent replication cohorts. Each cohort reports an additive per-allele effect on the standardized phenotype and its standard error.

Derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the common effect $b$.\n\nUnder a fixed-effect model, the estimators $b_1$ and $b_2$ are independent samples from normal distributions with a common mean $b$ and variances $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$, respectively. The likelihood function $L(b)$ for the true effect $b$, given the observed effects $b_1$ and $b_2$, is the product of their individual probability density functions:\n$$L(b | b_1, b_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}s_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(b_1-b)^2}{2s_1^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}s_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(b_2-b)^2}{2s_2^2}\\right)$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), $\\hat{b}$, we maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(b) = \\ln(L(b))$:\n$$\\ell(b) = -\\ln(2\\pi) - \\ln(s_1) - \\ln(s_2) - \\frac{(b_1-b)^2}{2s_1^2} - \\frac{(b_2-b)^2}{2s_2^2}$$\nWe differentiate $\\ell(b)$ with respect to $b$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{db} = \\frac{b_1-b}{s_1^2} + \\frac{b_2-b}{s_2^2} = 0$$\nDefining the inverse-variance weights as $w_i = 1/s_i^2$, the equation becomes:\n$$w_1(b_1 - b) + w_2(b_2 - b) = 0$$\nSolving for $b$, we find the MLE $\\hat{b}$:\n$$\\hat{b} = \\frac{b_1 w_1 + b_2 w_2}{w_1 + w_2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} b_i/s_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} 1/s_i^2}$$\nThis is the inverse-variance weighted mean effect.

Derivation of the heterogeneity statistic $Q$.\n\nCochran's $Q$ statistic quantifies the heterogeneity between studies and is defined as the weighted sum of squared deviations of individual study estimates from the pooled estimate. For $k$ studies, it is given by:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i(b_i - \\hat{b})^2$$\nFor our two studies ($k=2$), we have:\n$$Q = w_1(b_1 - \\hat{b})^2 + w_2(b_2 - \\hat{b})^2$$\nUsing the value $\\hat{b} = 0.0326$ from part 1:\n$$b_1 - \\hat{b} = 0.055 - 0.0326 = 0.0224$$\n$$b_2 - \\hat{b} = 0.020 - 0.0326 = -0.0126$$\nSubstituting these values and the weights into the formula for $Q$:\n$$Q = 2500(0.0224)^2 + \\frac{40000}{9}(-0.0126)^2$$\n$$Q = 2500(0.00050176) + \\frac{40000}{9}(0.00015876)$$\n$$Q = 1.2544 + \\frac{6.3504}{9} = 1.2544 + 0.7056 = 1.96$$\n\n3. Derivation of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the SNP, $h^2_{\\text{SNP}}$.\n\nThe proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the SNP, $h^2_{\\text{SNP}}$, is the ratio of the additive genetic variance from the SNP, $V_{\\text{SNP}}$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_P$.\n$$h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{SNP}}}{V_P}$$\nGiven that the phenotype is standardized, its total variance is $V_P=1$. Thus, $h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = V_{\\text{SNP}}$.\nIn an additive model with allele count $G \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ and per-allele effect size $b$, the genetic variance due to the SNP is $V_{\\text{SNP}} = \\text{Var}(b \\cdot G) = b^2 \\text{Var}(G)$. We must derive $\\text{Var}(G)$ assuming HWE.\nLet $p$ be the minor allele frequency. The genotype frequencies for $G=0$, $G=1$, and $G=2$ are $(1-p)^2$, $2p(1-p)$, and $p^2$, respectively.\nThe expected value of $G$ is:\n$$E[G] = (0) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2) \\cdot p^2 = 2p - 2p^2 + 2p^2 = 2p$$\nThe expected value of $G^2$ is:\n$$E[G^2] = (0^2) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1^2) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2^2) \\cdot p^2 = 2p - 2p^2 + 4p^2 = 2p + 2p^2$$\nThe variance of $G$ is:\n$$\\text{Var}(G) = E[G^2] - (E[G])^2 = (2p + 2p^2) - (2p)^2 = 2p + 2p^2 - 4p^2 = 2p - 2p^2 = 2p(1-p)$$\nThe proportion of variance explained is thus $h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = b^2 \\cdot 2p(1-p)$. We use the meta-analytic estimate $\\hat{b}$ for $b$.\nWith $p = 0.40$ and $\\hat{b} = 0.0326$:\n$$h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = (0.0326)^2 \\cdot 2(0.40)(1-0.40)$$\n$$h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = (0.00106276) \\cdot 2(0.40)(0.60)$$\n$$h^2_{\\text{SNP}} = (0.00106276) \\cdot (0.48) = 0.0005101248$$\n\n4. Computation of the remaining \"missing\" heritability, $h^2_{\\text{missing}}$.\n\nThe missing heritability is defined as the difference between the total heritability and the heritability explained by the SNP:\n$$h^2_{\\text{missing}} = h^2_{\\text{total}} - h^2_{\\text{SNP}}$$\nGiven $h^2_{\\text{total}} = 0.30$, we have:\n$$h^2_{\\text{missing}} = 0.30 - 0.0005101248 = 0.2994898752$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$h^2_{\\text{missing}} \\approx 0.2995$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2995}$$", "id": "5086629"}, {"introduction": "If single SNPs explain so little variance, why can't we account for all heritability by simply adding up the effects of all variants across the genome? A primary reason is that genotyping arrays do not measure every one of the millions of variants in each person's DNA. Instead, they rely on a principle called linkage disequilibrium (LD) to use a measured \"tag\" SNP to infer the status of nearby, unmeasured variants. In this practice, you will work through a hypothetical model to see how the effectiveness of this tagging, represented by the correlation squared ($r^2$), differs for common versus rare variants, demonstrating how a significant portion of heritability is systematically lost due to technological limitations [@problem_id:5086633].", "problem": "A complex human trait is modeled additively as $Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\beta_{i} G_{i} + \\varepsilon$, where $Y$ is standardized to have variance $1$, each $G_{i}$ is an additive genotype dosage (coded $0$, $1$, $2$ and centered), $\\beta_{i}$ is the per-allele effect on $Y$, and $\\varepsilon$ is environmental noise independent of all $G_{i}$.

This implies they are in linkage equilibrium, meaning their genotypes are uncorrelated. Therefore, the variance of the sum of their effects is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$h^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_{i} G_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\mathrm{Var}(G_i)$$\nLet $v_i = \\beta_{i}^{2} \\mathrm{Var}(G_i)$ be the variance explained by the $i$-th causal variant.

Let the set of indices for common variants be $C$ and for low-frequency/rare variants be $LF$. The corresponding heritabilities are:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{com}}^{2} = \\sum_{i \\in C} v_i = 0.2$$\n$$h_{\\mathrm{lf}}^{2} = \\sum_{i \\in LF} v_i = 0.3$$\nThese sum to the total heritability, $h_{\\mathrm{com}}^{2} + h_{\\mathrm{lf}}^{2} = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5 = h^2$, as expected.\n\nThe genotyping array does not measure the causal variants $G_i$ directly but rather a set of tag variants $T_i$. The fraction of variance of a causal variant $G_i$ captured by its tag $T_i$ is equal to the squared Pearson correlation coefficient, $r_i^2 = [\\mathrm{Corr}(G_i, T_i)]^2$. Therefore, the variance actually captured by the tag $T_i$ is $r_i^2 v_i$.\n\nThe problem assumes that the tags $T_i$ for causal variants located far apart do not overlap in LD. This allows us to find the total variance captured by the array, which we denote as $h_{\\mathrm{captured}}^{2}$, by summing the contributions from each tag:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{captured}}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} r_i^2 v_i$$\nOur goal is to find the expected value of this quantity, $\\mathbb{E}[h_{\\mathrm{captured}}^{2}]$. The expectation is taken over the stochastic process of tagging, which determines the values of $r_i^2$. By the linearity of expectation, we can write:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[h_{\\mathrm{captured}}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{M} r_i^2 v_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i]$$\nWe can partition this sum into the two variant classes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[h_{\\mathrm{captured}}^{2}] = \\sum_{i \\in C} \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i] + \\sum_{i \\in LF} \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i]$$\nA crucial assumption is provided: \"within each variant class that the $r_i^2$ values of best tags are independent of the effect sizes and allele frequencies generating $v_i$\". In this model, the $v_i$ values are fixed parameters defining the genetic architecture of the trait, while the $r_i^2$ values can be viewed as random variables drawn from a distribution specific to the tagging process for a given class. The independence assumption means that for any variant $i$ in a class, its variance contribution $v_i$ is independent of the random variable $r_i^2$. Therefore, the expectation of their product is the product of their expectations: $\\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i] = \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2] \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$. Since $v_i$ is a fixed parameter, not a random variable, its expectation is itself, so $\\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i] = v_i \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2]$.\n\nApplying this to the sum for common variants:\n$$\\sum_{i \\in C} \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2 v_i] = \\sum_{i \\in C} v_i \\mathbb{E}[r_i^2]$$\nThe problem gives the mean of the best-tag squared correlation for all common variants as $\\mathbb{E}[r^{2} \\mid \\mathrm{common}] = 0.9$. We assume this mean applies to each variant in the class, so $\\mathbb{E}[r_i^2] = 0.9$ for all $i \\in C$.
