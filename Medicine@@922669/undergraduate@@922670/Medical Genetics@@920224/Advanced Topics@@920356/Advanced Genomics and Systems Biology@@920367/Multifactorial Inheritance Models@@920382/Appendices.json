It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative genetics that is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the contribution of a single biallelic locus to the population mean and variance of a multifactorial trait. Let the two alleles at this locus be the \"effect\" allele, denoted $A_1$, with population frequency $p$, and the \"non-effect\" allele, $A_2$, with frequency $q = 1-p$. The genotype is represented by the random variable $X$, which counts the number of effect alleles an individual carries. Thus, $X$ can take values in the set $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Under HWE, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($A_2A_2$, $A_1A_2$, $A_1A_1$) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2$. These frequencies can be interpreted as the probabilities for the random variable $X$:\n-   The probability of having $0$ effect alleles (genotype $A_2A_2$) is $P(X=0) = q^2 = (1-p)^2$.\n-   The probability of having $1$ effect allele (genotype $A_1A_2$) is $P(X=1) = 2pq = 2p(1-p)$.\n-   The probability of having $2$ effect alleles (genotype $A_1A_1$) is $P(X=2) = p^2$.\n\nWe can verify that these probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) = (1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) + p^2 = (1 - 2p + p^2) + (2p - 2p^2) + p^2 = 1$$\n\nThe problem states that the contribution of this locus to the trait is purely additive, given by $Y = aX$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the per-allele additive effect. The random variable $Y$ represents the genotypic value for this locus. We need to find the mean (expectation) and variance of $Y$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Mean Contribution ($\\mu_{\\text{locus}}$)**\n\nThe mean contribution of the locus, $\\mu_{\\text{locus}}$, is the expected value of the random variable $Y$, denoted $E[Y]$. Using the property of linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{locus}} = E[Y] = E[aX] = aE[X]$$\n\nWe first calculate the expected value of $X$ using the fundamental definition for a discrete random variable, $E[X] = \\sum_i x_i P(X=x_i)$:\n$$E[X] = (0) \\cdot P(X=0) + (1) \\cdot P(X=1) + (2) \\cdot P(X=2)$$\nSubstituting the HWE probabilities:\n$$E[X] = (0) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2) \\cdot p^2$$\n$$E[X] = 0 + 2p - 2p^2 + 2p^2 = 2p$$\nThis result indicates that the average number of effect alleles per individual in the population is $2p$.\n\nNow, we can find the mean contribution to the trait:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{locus}} = aE[X] = a(2p) = 2ap$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Variance Contribution ($\\sigma_{\\text{locus}}^{2}$)**\n\nThe variance contribution of the locus, $\\sigma_{\\text{locus}}^{2}$, is the variance of the random variable $Y$, denoted $\\text{Var}(Y)$. Using the properties of variance, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{locus}}^{2} = \\text{Var}(Y) = \\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X)$$\n\nThe variance of $X$ is defined as $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. We have already calculated $E[X] = 2p$, so $(E[X])^2 = (2p)^2 = 4p^2$.\nNext, we must calculate the expected value of $X^2$, $E[X^2]$, using the definition $E[X^2] = \\sum_i x_i^2 P(X=x_i)$:\n$$E[X^2] = (0^2) \\cdot P(X=0) + (1^2) \\cdot P(X=1) + (2^2) \\cdot P(X=2)$$\nSubstituting the HWE probabilities:\n$$E[X^2] = (0) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (4) \\cdot p^2$$\n$$E[X^2] = 0 + 2p - 2p^2 + 4p^2 = 2p + 2p^2$$\n\nNow we can calculate the variance of $X$:\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = (2p + 2p^2) - (2p)^2$$\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = 2p + 2p^2 - 4p^2 = 2p - 2p^2$$\nFactoring this expression gives:\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = 2p(1-p)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the variance contribution to the trait, which is known as the additive genetic variance for this locus:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{locus}}^{2} = a^2 \\text{Var}(X) = a^2 [2p(1-p)] = 2a^2p(1-p)$$\n\nThe mean contribution of the locus is $\\mu_{\\text{locus}} = 2ap$, and the variance contribution is $\\sigma_{\\text{locus}}^{2} = 2a^2p(1-p)$.

Provide only the numerical values as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, under two different models of phenotypic variance decomposition. First, we outline the fundamental principles.\n\nThe total observed phenotypic variance, $V_P$, for a multifactorial trait can be decomposed into genetic ($V_G$) and environmental ($V_E$) components. Assuming independence between genetic and environmental factors (i.e., no genotype-environment correlation), the model is additive:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E$$\nThe genetic variance can be further partitioned into additive genetic variance ($V_A$), dominance variance ($V_D$), and epistatic (interaction) variance ($V_I$):\n$$V_G = V_A + V_D + V_I$$\nThe environmental variance can be partitioned into shared (or common) environmental variance ($V_C$) and specific (or non-shared) environmental variance ($V_S$):\n$$V_E = V_C + V_S$$\nCombining these gives the full variance decomposition model:\n$$V_P = V_A + V_D + V_I + V_C + V_S$$\nNarrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is due to additive genetic variance:\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$$\nThis quantity is of central importance in genetics because it predicts the response to selection and the degree of resemblance between relatives due to additive genetic effects.\n\n**Part 1: Baseline Heritability Calculation**\n\nIn the initial baseline scenario, we are given:\n- Total phenotypic variance, $V_P = 10$.\n- Additive genetic variance, $V_A = 4$.\n- An explicit assumption that the shared environmental variance is negligible, which formally means $V_C = 0$.\n\nThe assumption for this calculation is that the provided $V_P = 10$ is the correct total phenotypic variance for a model that does not explicitly partition out a shared environmental component. Using the definition of narrow-sense heritability, we compute the baseline value, which we denote as $h_1^2$:\n$$h_1^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4$$\n\n**Part 2: Re-computation of Heritability with Shared Environment**\n\nNext, we are presented with new evidence suggesting a non-negligible shared environmental component with variance $V_C = 2$. We are told to incorporate this into the model. The problem states that this component is independent of other sources of variation.\n\nThe crucial assumption here is how to \"incorporate\" this new component. The principle of variance additivity for independent components implies that the total variance is the sum of all its constituent parts. The initial model accounted for a total variance of $V_P = 10$ using the components known or assumed at that time ($V_A = 4$ and other residual variances summing to $V_P - V_A = 10 - 4 = 6$). The discovery of a new, independent source of variance, $V_C = 2$, means the previous total phenotypic variance was an underestimate because it was based on an incomplete model. The new, more complete model must include this additional variance.\n\nTherefore, the updated total phenotypic variance, denoted $V_{P'}$, is the sum of the original phenotypic variance and the newly identified shared environmental variance component:\n$$V_{P'} = V_P + V_C = 10 + 2 = 12$$\nWe assume that the estimate of the additive genetic variance, $V_A = 4$, remains unchanged. The recomputed narrow-sense heritability, denoted $h_2^2$, is then:\n$$h_2^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_{P'}} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Values and Interpretation**\n\nWe are asked to express both heritability values as unitless decimals rounded to three significant figures.\nFor the baseline scenario:\n$$h_1^2 = 0.400$$\nFor the scenario including shared environment:\n$$h_2^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33333... \\approx 0.333$$\n\n**Interpretation of the change:**\nThe narrow-sense heritability decreases from $h_1^2 = 0.400$ to $h_2^2 = 0.333$. This change has a clear interpretation regarding family resemblance. Heritability ($h^2$) quantifies the proportion of a trait's variation attributable to additive genetic effects. A lower $h^2$ implies that genetics play a proportionally smaller role in explaining the differences observed among individuals in the population.\n\nThe introduction of the shared environmental variance component ($V_C$) forces a re-evaluation of the sources of familial similarity. Initially, with $V_C$ assumed to be zero, all resemblance between relatives (beyond what is expected by chance) would be partitioned into genetic sources. By recognizing that the shared environment contributes $V_C=2$ to the total variance, we acknowledge that individuals sharing a household are similar in part because of that shared environment (e.g., diet, socioeconomic status, parental habits). Consequently, the relative contribution of shared genes is lower than previously thought. The decrease in $h^2$ from $0.400$ to $0.333$ shows that once we properly account for the shared environment, additive genetic effects explain a smaller fraction (from $40\\%$ to $33.3\\%$) of the total phenotypic variance. This implies that for individuals sharing a household, a greater portion of their phenotypic resemblance is due to environmental factors, and a smaller portion is due to their genetic relationship.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.400 & 0.333\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5062911"}, {"introduction": "This practice brings together the concepts of genetic variance and liability into a direct clinical application: disease risk prediction.
