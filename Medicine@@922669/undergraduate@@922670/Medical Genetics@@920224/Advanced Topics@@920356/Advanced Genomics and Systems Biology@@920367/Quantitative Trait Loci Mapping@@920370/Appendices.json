In a variance component analysis based on unrelated individuals, the total phenotypic variance is estimated as $V_{P}=100$ (in trait units squared). The additive genetic variance is estimated as $V_{A}=40$, the dominance genetic variance as $V_{D}=20$, and the environmental variance as $V_{E}=40$. The epistatic genetic variance $V_{I}$ is not directly estimable in this design and should be kept symbolic.\n\nUsing the standard variance decomposition in quantitative genetics for complex traits and the standard definitions of narrow-sense and broad-sense heritability, compute the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ and the broad-sense heritability $H^{2}$. Report $h^{2}$ as a numerical value and $H^{2}$ as a closed-form expression in terms of $V_{I}$. Express both quantities as decimals or algebraic fractions without the percentage sign. Then, briefly interpret what these values imply for the expected quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect sizes detectable in this human cohort using models that prioritize additive effects.", "solution": "The foundational starting point is the standard decomposition of phenotypic variance in quantitative genetics. For a complex trait, the total phenotypic variance $V_{P}$ can be written as\n$$\nV_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E},\n$$\nwhere $V_{G}$ is the total genetic variance and $V_{E}$ is the environmental variance. The genetic variance can be further decomposed into component sources:\n$$\nV_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{I},\n$$\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the additive genetic variance, $V_{D}$ is the dominance genetic variance, and $V_{I}$ is the epistatic (interaction) genetic variance.\n\nNarrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ is defined as the proportion of the phenotypic variance attributable to additive effects:\n$$\nh^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}.\n$$\nBroad-sense heritability $H^{2}$ is defined as the proportion of the phenotypic variance attributable to all genetic effects:\n$$\nH^{2} = \\frac{V_{G}}{V_{P}} = \\frac{V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{I}}{V_{P}}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute $h^{2}$ numerically using the provided quantities:\n$$\nh^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4.\n$$\n\nFor $H^{2}$, we retain $V_{I}$ symbolically:\n$$\nH^{2} = \\frac{V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{I}}{V_{P}} = \\frac{40 + 20 + V_{I}}{100} = 0.6 + \\frac{V_{I}}{100}.\n$$\n\nInterpretation for QTL mapping in a human cohort:\n- The value $h^{2}=0.4$ indicates that additive genetic effects account for $40\\%$ of the phenotypic variance. Because standard human cohort QTL analyses and genome-wide association studies typically fit additive models, this suggests that the majority of the genetic signal accessible to such analyses is additive and of moderate magnitude.\n- The difference between $H^{2}$ and $h^{2}$, namely $H^{2} - h^{2} = 0.2 + \\frac{V_{I}}{100}$, reflects non-additive contributions (dominance and epistasis). In designs with unrelated individuals and additive-focused models, dominance ($V_{D}$) and epistasis ($V_{I}$) are generally harder to detect and often contribute to variance that is not captured as individual additive QTL effects. Consequently, expected QTL effect sizes detectable in this cohort will tend to be smaller and more numerous, corresponding to the additive portion, while non-additive effects inflate $H^{2}$ without proportionally increasing detectable additive QTL signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.4  0.6 + \\frac{V_{I}}{100}\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5076756"}, {"introduction": "Once we know that a trait has a genetic component, the next step is to model this influence statistically to test for associations with specific genetic variants.

In Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping, association testing for a quantitative trait $Y$ commonly uses linear models relating genotype to the expected trait value. From first principles, define the additive effect as the half-difference between homozygote means and dominance deviation as the departure of the heterozygote mean from the midpoint of homozygote means. Specifically, let the genotype-specific expectations be $\\mu_{AA}$, $\\mu_{Aa}$, and $\\mu_{aa}$.
