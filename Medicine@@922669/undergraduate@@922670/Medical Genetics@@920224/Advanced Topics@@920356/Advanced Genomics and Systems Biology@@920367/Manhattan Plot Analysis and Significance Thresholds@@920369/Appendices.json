In a standard Manhattan plot, the vertical axis for each tested single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is defined as the negative base-ten logarithm of its association test p-value. Consider a SNP that appears at vertical coordinate $y=12$ on such a plot. Using only the definition of the Manhattan plot axis and properties of logarithms, compute the corresponding p-value $p$ for this SNP. Then, starting from the same base definitions, rigorously justify why a difference of $1$ unit on the vertical axis corresponds to a tenfold change in $p$-value. Express the final p-value in scientific notation. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, resting on the standard definition of the vertical axis in a Manhattan plot used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We proceed with the solution by addressing the two parts of the problem statement in order.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the p-value.\n\nThe problem states that the vertical coordinate, $y$, on a Manhattan plot is defined as the negative base-ten logarithm of the association test p-value, $p$. This relationship can be expressed by the equation:\n$$y = -\\log_{10}(p)$$\nWe are given that a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has a vertical coordinate of $y = 12$. Substituting this value into the definitional equation gives:\n$$12 = -\\log_{10}(p)$$\nTo solve for the p-value, $p$, we first isolate the logarithm term by multiplying both sides of the equation by $-1$:\n$$-12 = \\log_{10}(p)$$\nBy the definition of a logarithm, the equation $\\log_b(x) = a$ is equivalent to $b^a = x$. Applying this principle to our equation, with base $b=10$, argument $x=p$, and value $a=-12$, we can rewrite the logarithmic equation in its exponential form:\n$$p = 10^{-12}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation. The value $10^{-12}$ is equivalent to $1 \\times 10^{-12}$. Thus, the p-value for the SNP is $1 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n\nPart 2: Justification of the tenfold change in p-value.\n\nWe are asked to demonstrate rigorously why a difference of $1$ unit on the vertical axis corresponds to a tenfold change in the p-value. Let us consider two distinct points on the vertical axis, $y_1$ and $y_2$, and their corresponding p-values, $p_1$ and $p_2$. According to the definition:\n$$y_1 = -\\log_{10}(p_1)$$\n$$y_2 = -\\log_{10}(p_2)$$\nLet us set the difference between these two vertical coordinates to be $1$:\n$$y_2 - y_1 = 1$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $y_1$ and $y_2$ into this difference equation:\n$$(-\\log_{10}(p_2)) - (-\\log_{10}(p_1)) = 1$$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$\\log_{10}(p_1) - \\log_{10}(p_2) = 1$$\nWe now apply the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that $\\log_b(u) - \\log_b(v) = \\log_b(\\frac{u}{v})$. Applying this rule to our equation yields:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) = 1$$\nTo find the relationship between $p_1$ and $p_2$, we convert this logarithmic equation back into its exponential form:\n$$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = 10^1$$\n$$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = 10$$\nThis result shows that $p_1 = 10 \\times p_2$. Since we defined $y_2 - y_1 = 1$, or $y_2  y_1$, this means that the p-value $p_2$ (corresponding to the higher, more significant y-value) is one-tenth of the p-value $p_1$ (corresponding to the lower y-value). Conversely, increasing the p-value by a factor of $10$ (a tenfold increase) causes the y-value to decrease by $1$. A decrease in p-value by a factor of $10$ (a tenfold decrease) causes the y-value to increase by $1$. Therefore, a change of $1$ unit on the $y$-axis precisely corresponds to a tenfold change in the p-value, $p$.

A smaller $p$-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nThe conventional threshold for genome-wide significance is $p  5 \\times 10^{-8}$.

Therefore, both SNPs represent highly significant associations.\n\nThe visual separation $S \\approx 0.6021$ on the logarithmic scale is indeed meaningful. The use of a logarithmic scale transforms multiplicative differences in statistical evidence (i.e., ratios of $p$-values) into additive, linear distances on the plot. In this case, the separation $S = \\log_{10}(4)$ directly reflects the fact that the $p$-value for SNP2 is four times larger than for SNP1. This implies that the statistical evidence for association is stronger for SNP1 than for SNP2. While both findings are robustly significant, the SNP with the smaller $p$-value (and thus higher position on the plot) is generally considered the 'lead' SNP in a given genomic locus and is prioritized for subsequent functional validation and fine-mapping studies. The visual difference on the plot provides an immediate, quantitative comparison of the relative strength of evidence between the two signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6021}$$", "id": "5056459"}]}
