We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$, for a trait is partitioned into three components under the additive genetics–common environment–unique environment (ACE) model. These components are the additive genetic variance ($V_{A}$), the common or shared environmental variance ($V_{C}$), and the unique or non-shared environmental variance ($V_{E}$). The model assumes these components are independent and sum to the total variance:\n$$V_{P} = V_{A} + V_{C} + V_{E}$$\nThe proportions of the total variance accounted for by each component are defined as:\n-   Narrow-sense heritability: $h^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}$\n-   Shared environment proportion: $c^{2} = \\frac{V_{C}}{V_{P}}$\n-   Unique environment proportion: $e^{2} = \\frac{V_{E}}{V_{P}}$\n\nBy definition, these proportions sum to unity:\n$$h^{2} + c^{2} + e^{2} = 1$$\n\nThe correlation ($r$) in the trait between two members of a pair (e.g., twins) is given by the ratio of their phenotypic covariance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2})}{V_{P}}$$\nwhere $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the phenotypes of the two individuals. The phenotype of an individual $i$ is modeled as $P_{i} = A_{i} + C_{i} + E_{i}$. Assuming the genetic and environmental components are uncorrelated, the covariance between two individuals is:\n$$\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = \\text{Cov}(A_{1} + C_{1} + E_{1}, A_{2} + C_{2} + E_{2}) = \\text{Cov}(A_{1}, A_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(C_{1}, C_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(E_{1}, E_{2})$$\n\nWe now apply this framework to monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.\n\nFor monozygotic (MZ) twins:\n-   They are genetically identical, so their additive genetic effects are perfectly correlated. Thus, $\\text{Cov}(A_{1}, A_{2}) = V_{A}$.\n-   They are reared together, so they share a common environment perfectly. Thus, $\\text{Cov}(C_{1}, C_{2}) = V_{C}$.\n-   By definition, the unique environmental influences are uncorrelated. Thus, $\\text{Cov}(E_{1}, E_{2}) = 0$.\n\nThe total covariance for an MZ twin pair is therefore $\\text{Cov}(P_{MZ1}, P_{MZ2}) = V_{A} + V_{C}$. The correlation is:\n$$r_{MZ} = \\frac{V_{A} + V_{C}}{V_{P}} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} + \\frac{V_{C}}{V_{P}}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for $h^2$ and $c^2$, we obtain the first key equation:\n$$r_{MZ} = h^{2} + c^{2}$$\n\nFor dizygotic (DZ) twins:\n-   They share, on average, $50\\%$ of their segregating genes, so the covariance of their additive genetic effects is $\\frac{1}{2}V_{A}$.

We have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $h^{2}$ and $c^{2}$:\n1.  $h^{2} + c^{2} = 0.76$\n2.  $\\frac{1}{2}h^{2} + c^{2} = 0.49$\n\nTo solve for $h^{2}$, we subtract the second equation from the first:\n$$(h^{2} + c^{2}) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}h^{2} + c^{2}\\right) = 0.76 - 0.49$$\n$$h^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}h^{2} = 0.27$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}h^{2} = 0.27$$\n$$h^{2} = 2 \\times 0.27 = 0.54$$\nThis is the estimate for the narrow-sense heritability. This derivation is often referred to as Falconer's formula: $h^{2} = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ})$.\n\nNext, we solve for $c^{2}$ by substituting the value of $h^{2}$ back into the first equation:\n$$0.54 + c^{2} = 0.76$$\n$$c^{2} = 0.76 - 0.54 = 0.22$$\nThis is the estimate for the proportion of variance due to the shared environment.\n\nFinally, we use the identity $h^{2} + c^{2} + e^{2} = 1$ to find $e^{2}$:\n$$0.54 + 0.22 + e^{2} = 1$$\n$$0.76 + e^{2} = 1$$\n$$e^{2} = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24$$\nThis is the estimate for the proportion of variance due to the unique environment.\n\nThe question asks whether the shared environment contribution is substantial. The value $c^{2} = 0.22$ indicates that $22\\%$ of the total phenotypic variance in the trait is explained by environmental factors common to both twins. In the context of quantitative genetics and twin studies, a contribution of this magnitude is considered substantial and mechanistically important. It is significantly different from zero and represents a major source of familial resemblance beyond genetics.\n\nThe final numerical values are $h^{2} = 0.54$, $c^{2} = 0.22$, and $e^{2} = 0.24$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.54  0.22  0.24 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5045704"}, {"introduction": "While the ACE model is a powerful starting point, nature is often more complex, involving non-additive genetic effects like dominance.

A key indicator is the relationship between $r_{DZ}$ and $r_{MZ}$. In a simple model with only additive genetic and unique environmental effects (an AE model), one would expect $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$. The presence of common environmental effects ($C > 0$) would make $r_{DZ} > \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$, while the presence of dominance genetic effects ($D > 0$) would make $r_{DZ}  \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$.\n\nLet's examine the given data:\n- $r_{MZ} = 0.85$\n- $r_{DZ} = 0.35$\n\nCalculating one-half of the MZ correlation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.85) = 0.425$$\nSince the observed $r_{DZ} = 0.35$ is less than $0.425$, this pattern ($r_{DZ}  \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$) suggests the presence of dominance genetic effects, making the ADE model potentially more suitable than the ACE model.\n\nTo confirm the unsuitability of the ACE model, we can attempt to solve for its parameters using the given correlations:\n$$A + C = 0.85$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}A + C = 0.35$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$(A + C) - (\\frac{1}{2}A + C) = 0.85 - 0.35$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}A = 0.50 \\implies A = 1.00$$\nSubstituting $A=1.00$ back into the first equation:\n$$1.00 + C = 0.85 \\implies C = -0.15$$\nA negative variance component ($C = -0.15$) is biologically and mathematically impossible. This result demonstrates that the ACE model provides a poor and invalid fit to the data.\n\nTherefore, we proceed with the ADE model, which is consistent with the observed data pattern.
