Let locus $C$ encode a protein that, when present in at least one dominant copy ($C$), would produce a measurable phenotype called the functional phenotype. Let locus $S$ encode a dominant suppressor that blocks the action of locus $C$ whenever at least one dominant $S$ allele is present. Thus, individuals with genotype $S-$ (that is, $SS$ or $Ss$) do not show the functional phenotype, regardless of their genotype at $C$. Individuals with genotype $ss$ show the functional phenotype only if they carry at least one dominant $C$ allele.

Penetrance is defined as the conditional probability $P(Y=1 \\mid X_1, X_2)$. Assume the following empirically supported foundations:\n- Penetrance $P(Y=1 \\mid X_1, X_2)$ is linked to the disease odds by $O(Y=1 \\mid X_1, X_2) = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid X_1, X_2)}{1 - P(Y=1 \\mid X_1, X_2)}$.\n- In case-control genetics, absence of epistasis on the log-odds scale means that the logarithm of the odds changes additively with $X_1$ and $X_2$ (no interaction term), which implies multiplicative odds across loci and dosages.\n\nSuppose the baseline penetrance at the double non-risk genotype is $P(Y=1 \\mid X_1=0, X_2=0) = p_{00} = 0.02$, and per-allele odds ratios are $\\text{OR}_1 = 1.7$ for locus $1$ and $\\text{OR}_2 = 2.3$ for locus $2$, each defined as the multiplicative change in disease odds per additional risk allele at the respective locus.

The frequency of any two-locus genotype is the product of the frequencies of the uniting gametes from the population's gamete pool. For a specific genotype, we must sum the probabilities of all possible gamete combinations that produce it.\n\nLet's demonstrate this for three representative two-locus genotypes:\n\n1.  **Homozygous-Homozygous Genotype ($AABB$):**\n    This genotype can only be formed by the union of an $AB$ gamete with another $AB$ gamete.\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AABB) = \\text{Freq}(AB) \\times \\text{Freq}(AB) = (p_A p_B) (p_A p_B) = p_A^2 p_B^2 $$\n    We can see that this factorizes into the product of the single-locus HWE frequencies:\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AABB) = (p_A^2) \\times (p_B^2) = \\text{Freq}(AA) \\times \\text{Freq}(BB) $$\n\n2.  **Heterozygous-Homozygous Genotype ($AABb$):**\n    This genotype can be formed by the union of an $AB$ gamete and an $Ab$ gamete, in either order.\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AABb) = \\text{Freq}(AB) \\times \\text{Freq}(Ab) + \\text{Freq}(Ab) \\times \\text{Freq}(AB) $$\n    $$ = (p_A p_B)(p_A q_B) + (p_A q_B)(p_A p_B) = 2p_A^2 p_B q_B $$\n    This also factorizes as required:\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AABb) = (p_A^2) \\times (2p_B q_B) = \\text{Freq}(AA) \\times \\text{Freq}(Bb) $$\n\n3.  **Double Heterozygous Genotype ($AaBb$):**\n    This genotype can be formed from four combinations of gametes: ($AB$, $ab$), ($ab$, $AB$), ($Ab$, $aB$), or ($aB$, $Ab$).\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AaBb) = \\text{Freq}(AB)\\text{Freq}(ab) + \\text{Freq}(ab)\\text{Freq}(AB) + \\text{Freq}(Ab)\\text{Freq}(aB) + \\text{Freq}(aB)\\text{Freq}(Ab) $$\n    $$ = (p_A p_B)(q_A q_B) + (q_A q_B)(p_A p_B) + (p_A q_B)(q_A p_B) + (q_A p_B)(p_A q_B) $$\n    $$ = 2 p_A q_A p_B q_B + 2 p_A q_A p_B q_B = 4 p_A q_A p_B q_B $$\n    This also factorizes:\n    $$ \\text{Freq}(AaBb) = (2p_A q_A) \\times (2p_B q_B) = \\text{Freq}(Aa) \\times \\text{Freq}(Bb) $$\n\nThis pattern holds for all $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible two-locus genotypes.
