A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe ACE model partitions the total phenotypic variance ($\\sigma_P^2$) of a trait into three components: additive genetic variance ($A$), common environmental variance ($C$), and unique environmental variance ($E$). The phenotype $P$ of an individual can be modeled as the sum of these influences: $P = G + C_{env} + E_{env}$, where $G$ represents the additive genetic effects, $C_{env}$ the common environmental effects, and $E_{env}$ the unique environmental effects. The respective variances are $A = \\text{Var}(G)$, $C = \\text{Var}(C_{env})$, and $E = \\text{Var}(E_{env})$.\n\nThe problem states that the total phenotypic variance is standardized to $1$. Under the assumption that genetic and environmental effects are uncorrelated, the total variance is the sum of the component variances:\n$$\n\\sigma_P^2 = A + C + E = 1\n$$\nThis is the first equation in our system.\n\nThe intraclass correlation for a pair of twins (denoted as twin $1$ and twin $2$) is defined as the covariance of their phenotypes divided by the total phenotypic variance:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2)}{\\sigma_P^2}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_P^2 = 1$, the correlation is simply equal to the covariance:\n$$\nr = \\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2)\n$$\nWe expand the covariance term using the model $P_i = G_i + C_{env, i} + E_{env, i}$:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2) = \\text{Cov}(G_1 + C_{env, 1} + E_{env, 1}, G_2 + C_{env, 2} + E_{env, 2})\n$$\nUsing the property of bilinearity of covariance and the model's assumption of no gene-environment correlation, all cross-covariance terms (e.g., $\\text{Cov}(G_1, C_{env, 2})$) are zero. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2) = \\text{Cov}(G_1, G_2) + \\text{Cov}(C_{env, 1}, C_{env, 2}) + \\text{Cov}(E_{env, 1}, E_{env, 2})\n$$\nNow, we evaluate each covariance term based on the type of twin pair:\n1.  **Genetic Covariance, $\\text{Cov}(G_1, G_2)$**:\n    -   For monozygotic (MZ) twins, who are genetically identical ($100\\%$ gene sharing), $G_1 = G_2$. Therefore, their genetic covariance is the additive genetic variance itself: $\\text{Cov}(G_{MZ,1}, G_{MZ,2}) = \\text{Var}(G) = A$.\n    -   For dizygotic (DZ) twins, who share on average $50\\%$ of their segregating alleles, their genetic covariance (assuming only additive effects) is half the additive genetic variance: $\\text{Cov}(G_{DZ,1}, G_{DZ,2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Var}(G) = \\frac{1}{2}A$.\n2.  **Common Environment Covariance, $\\text{Cov}(C_{env, 1}, C_{env, 2})$**: By definition, the common environment is perfectly shared between twins raised in the same household. Thus, $C_{env, 1} = C_{env, 2}$, and their covariance is the variance of the common environment: $\\text{Cov}(C_{env, 1}, C_{env, 2}) = \\text{Var}(C_{env}) = C$. This applies to both MZ and DZ twins under the equal environments assumption.\n3.  **Unique Environment Covariance, $\\text{Cov}(E_{env, 1}, E_{env, 2})$**: The unique environment encompasses all factors not shared between twins. By definition, these effects are uncorrelated for members of a twin pair. Thus, $\\text{Cov}(E_{env, 1}, E_{env, 2}) = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, we can write the expressions for the MZ and DZ correlations:\nFor MZ twins:\n$$\nr_{MZ} = \\text{Cov}(P_{MZ,1}, P_{MZ,2}) = A + C + 0 = A + C\n$$\nFor DZ twins:\n$$\nr_{DZ} = \\text{Cov}(P_{DZ,1}, P_{DZ,2}) = \\frac{1}{2}A + C + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}A + C\n$$\nWe now have a system of three linear equations for the three unknowns $A$, $C$, and $E$:\n1.  $A + C + E = 1$\n2.  $A + C = r_{MZ}$\n3.  $\\frac{1}{2}A + C = r_{DZ}$\n\nTo solve for $A, C, E$ in terms of $r_{MZ}$ and $r_{DZ}$, we subtract equation (3) from equation (2):\n$$\n(A + C) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}A + C\\right) = r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}A = r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for $A$, known as Falconer's formula for heritability:\n$$\nA = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ})\n$$\nNext, we solve for $C$. Substituting the expression for $A$ into equation (2):\n$$\nC = r_{MZ} - A = r_{MZ} - 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}) = r_{MZ} - 2r_{MZ} + 2r_{DZ}\n$$\n$$\nC = 2r_{DZ} - r_{MZ}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $E$. Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n$$\n(A + C) + E = 1 \\implies r_{MZ} + E = 1\n$$\n$$\nE = 1 - r_{MZ}\n$$\nThese are the derived expressions for $A$, $C$, and $E$.\n\nNow we compute their numerical values using the given correlations $r_{MZ} = 0.74$ and $r_{DZ} = 0.38$.\n$$\nA = 2(0.74 - 0.38) = 2(0.36) = 0.72\n$$\n$$\nC = 2(0.38) - 0.74 = 0.76 - 0.74 = 0.02\n$$\n$$\nE = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26\n$$\nAs a check, we verify that the components sum to $1$:\n$$\nA + C + E = 0.72 + 0.02 + 0.26 = 1.00\n$$\nThe calculation is consistent.

The model is $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i$. We need to find the OLS estimate for the calibration slope, $\\beta_1$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.\n\nThe data for the regression are:\n- PRS values ($x_i$): $(-0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4)$\n- Phenotype values ($y_i$): $(4.42, 4.86, 5.00, 5.34, 5.38)$\n\nFirst, we compute the means of $x$ and $y$:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{-0.4 - 0.2 + 0.0 + 0.2 + 0.4}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \\frac{4.42 + 4.86 + 5.00 + 5.34 + 5.38}{5} = \\frac{25.00}{5} = 5.00 $$\n\nThe formula for the OLS slope coefficient, $\\beta_1$, is:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\nLet's calculate the terms $S_{xy} = \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$ and $S_{xx} = \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\nSince $\\bar{x}=0$:\n$$ S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - \\bar{y} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i $$\n$$ S_{xy} = (-0.4)(4.42) + (-0.2)(4.86) + (0.0)(5.00) + (0.2)(5.34) + (0.4)(5.38) $$\n$$ S_{xy} = -1.768 - 0.972 + 0 + 1.068 + 2.152 = 0.48 $$\n\n$$ S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - 0)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 $$\n$$ S_{xx} = (-0.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (0.0)^2 + (0.2)^2 + (0.4)^2 $$\n$$ S_{xx} = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0 + 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.40 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the calibration slope $\\beta_1$:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{0.48}{0.40} = 1.2 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the coefficient of determination, $R^2$. The formula is:\n$$ R^2 = \\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx} S_{yy}} $$\nwhere $S_{yy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$.\n$$ S_{yy} = (4.42 - 5.00)^2 + (4.86 - 5.00)^2 + (5.00 - 5.00)^2 + (5.34 - 5.00)^2 + (5.38 - 5.00)^2 $$\n$$ S_{yy} = (-0.58)^2 + (-0.14)^2 + (0)^2 + (0.34)^2 + (0.38)^2 $$\n$$ S_{yy} = 0.3364 + 0.0196 + 0 + 0.1156 + 0.1444 = 0.616 $$\n\nNow, we compute $R^2$:\n$$ R^2 = \\frac{(0.48)^2}{(0.40)(0.616)} = \\frac{0.2304}{0.2464} \\approx 0.935064935... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding each numeric value to four significant figures.\n- Index individual's PRS: $0.1 \\rightarrow 0.1000$\n- Calibration slope: $1.2 \\rightarrow 1.200$\n- $R^2$: $0.93506... \\rightarrow 0.9351$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a single row matrix containing these three values in order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1000 & 1.200 & 0.9351 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "5071891"}]}
