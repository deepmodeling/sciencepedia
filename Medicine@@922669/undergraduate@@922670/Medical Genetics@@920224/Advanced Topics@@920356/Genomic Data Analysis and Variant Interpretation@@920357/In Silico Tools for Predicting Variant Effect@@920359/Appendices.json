You are given an effective column summary from a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) where sequence weights have already been applied to correct for redundancy. The column contains the following effective counts of residues: alanine ($\\mathrm{A}$) has $c_{\\mathrm{A}}=32$, valine ($\\mathrm{V}$) has $c_{\\mathrm{V}}=12$, isoleucine ($\\mathrm{I}$) has $c_{\\mathrm{I}}=4$, leucine ($\\mathrm{L}$) has $c_{\\mathrm{L}}=2$, and all other amino acids have zero counts.

Express the final value as a unitless probability (no percent sign).", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) score for a substitution to proline at a specific, highly conserved position in a protein. The SIFT score is operationally defined here as the normalized posterior probability of observing proline at this position, estimated using a Bayesian smoothing approach.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the Central Dogma of molecular biology, which outlines the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein. A protein's amino acid sequence, dictated by its corresponding gene, determines its three-dimensional structure and, consequently, its biological function. The principle of evolutionary conservation posits that positions in a protein sequence that are critical for structure or function are subject to strong negative (purifying) selection. This means that mutations at these positions are often deleterious and are thus weeded out from the population over evolutionary time. As a result, such functionally constrained positions show high conservation—a limited repertoire of amino acids—when compared across homologous proteins from different species in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The SIFT algorithm leverages this principle by assuming that an amino acid that is rarely observed at a position in an MSA is likely to be functionally intolerant if introduced by a new mutation.\n\nThe problem provides effective counts of amino acids at a specific column in an MSA: alanine ($c_{\\mathrm{A}}=32$), valine ($c_{\\mathrm{V}}=12$), isoleucine ($c_{\\mathrm{I}}=4$), and leucine ($c_{\\mathrm{L}}=2$). All of these are nonpolar, aliphatic amino acids, suggesting a functional or structural constraint for this type of residue. The total effective count is $N = c_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{\\mathrm{V}} + c_{\\mathrm{I}} + c_{\\mathrm{L}} = 32 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 50$. The count for proline, the amino acid of interest for the substitution, is $c_{\\mathrm{P}}=0$.\n\nA naive estimation of the probability of observing proline ($p_{\\mathrm{P}}$) would be its relative frequency: $p_{\\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{P}}}{N} = \\frac{0}{50} = 0$. This zero probability is problematic because it implies that a proline at this position is an absolute impossibility. This is an overconfident conclusion based on a finite, and potentially small or biased, sample of sequences. The true probability might be very small but non-zero.\n\nTo obtain a more robust estimate, we employ Bayesian smoothing using a Dirichlet prior. This method regularizes the probability estimates by incorporating prior beliefs about amino acid distributions. The posterior probability of observing amino acid $i$, given the observed counts $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{20})$, is calculated by combining the likelihood (from the data) with a Dirichlet prior distribution. The Dirichlet prior is defined by concentration parameters $\\alpha_i$, where $\\alpha_i = \\beta b_i$. Here, $\\beta$ is the total strength of the prior (also known as the pseudocount), and $b_i$ is the background frequency of amino acid $i$ in a large, general corpus of proteins.\n\nThe posterior probability for amino acid $i$, denoted $P(i | \\mathbf{c})$, is given by the formula:\n$$P(i | \\mathbf{c}) = \\frac{c_i + \\alpha_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{20} (c_j + \\alpha_j)} = \\frac{c_i + \\beta b_i}{N + \\sum_{j=1}^{20} \\beta b_j}$$\nSince the background frequencies sum to one, $\\sum_{j=1}^{20} b_j = 1$, the denominator simplifies to $N + \\beta$. The resulting formula for the posterior probability is:\n$$P(i | \\mathbf{c}) = \\frac{c_i + \\beta b_i}{N + \\beta}$$\nThis formula can be interpreted as adding pseudocounts ($\\beta b_i$) to the real counts ($c_i$) and then normalizing. This procedure \"smooths\" the distribution by pulling the estimated probabilities from the observed data towards the prior background frequencies, preventing zero probabilities for unobserved amino acids.\n\nWe are asked to compute this probability for proline ($\\mathrm{P}$). The given values are:\n- Observed count for proline, $c_{\\mathrm{P}} = 0$.\n- Total observed effective count, $N = 50$.\n- Strength of the Dirichlet prior, $\\beta = 10$.\n- Background frequency of proline, $b_{\\mathrm{P}} = 0.046$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives the SIFT score for the substitution to proline:\n$$\\text{SIFT Score}(\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathrm{P}) = P(\\mathrm{P} | \\mathbf{c}) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{P}} + \\beta b_{\\mathrm{P}}}{N + \\beta}$$\n$$\\text{SIFT Score}(\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathrm{P}) = \\frac{0 + (10)(0.046)}{50 + 10}$$\n$$\\text{SIFT Score}(\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathrm{P}) = \\frac{0.46}{60}$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{P} | \\mathbf{c}) = 0.007666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the SIFT score is $0.007667$.\n\nThis score is then interpreted by comparing it to a predefined threshold, commonly set at $0.05$. The rationale behind this threshold is rooted in the conservation-driven functional constraint. A very low probability, such as the one calculated, indicates that proline is highly underrepresented at this position compared to both the specifically observed amino acids (A, V, I, L) and the general background expectation. Such a low probability suggests that strong evolutionary pressure has acted against proline at this site. Therefore, a new mutation introducing a proline is predicted to be \"intolerant,\" meaning it is likely to disrupt the protein's function and be deleterious.\nSince our calculated score of $0.007667$ is less than the threshold of $0.05$, the substitution to proline would be classified as intolerant or damaging.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$$ P(\\mathrm{P} | \\mathbf{c}) = \\frac{0.46}{60} \\approx 0.007667 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.007667}$$", "id": "5049990"}, {"introduction": "Not all pathogenic variants alter the protein's amino acid sequence; many exert their effects by disrupting essential regulatory signals in the DNA or RNA.

During the pioneer round of translation, ribosomes displace EJCs that are upstream of the translating stop codon. If a premature termination codon (PTC) remains upstream of one or more downstream EJCs, Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) is typically triggered. Many in silico variant effect predictors implement a heuristic often called the greater-than $50$ nucleotide rule: a PTC is predicted to elicit NMD if it lies more than $50$ nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction. Consider a protein-coding human transcript with $4$ coding exons. Coding deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) numbering uses $c.1$ at the first base of the start codon.

The central dogma of molecular biology dictates that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is then translated into protein. In eukaryotes, the initial mRNA transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together. During this process, a multi-protein complex known as the exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each newly formed exon–exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing process.\n\nDuring the first, or \"pioneer,\" round of translation, the ribosome moves along the mature mRNA from the $5^{\\prime}$ to the $3^{\\prime}$ direction. As the ribosome translates the coding sequence, it displaces any EJCs it encounters. Translation normally terminates at a stop codon. If the ribosome encounters a premature termination codon (PTC) and terminates translation, the NMD surveillance machinery checks for the presence of any remaining EJCs downstream of the PTC. The presence of such a downstream EJC is a signal that the termination is premature, and the mRNA is targeted for degradation via the NMD pathway.\n\nThe greater-than $50$ nucleotide rule is a computational simplification of this biological process. It posits that an EJC located more than approximately $50$ to $55$ nucleotides downstream of a stop codon can trigger NMD. Since EJCs are deposited upstream of exon-exon junctions, the rule is operationally defined by the position of the PTC relative to the last exon-exon junction. A PTC is predicted to elicit NMD if it is located more than $50$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction. This provides a sufficient distance for the NMD factors to assemble and target the transcript for decay.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the indicator variable $S$, where $S=1$ if this rule is satisfied and $S=0$ otherwise. To do this, we must first calculate the distance, $d$, from the first nucleotide of the PTC to the position of the last exon-exon junction.\n\nThe transcript has $4$ coding exons. The lengths of the coding portions of the exons are given as:\n- Exon $1$ length, $L_1 = 330$ nucleotides.\n- Exon $2$ length, $L_2 = 225$ nucleotides.\n- Exon $3$ length, $L_3 = 195$ nucleotides.\n- Exon $4$ length, $L_4 = 480$ nucleotides.\n\nThe cDNA coordinates are constructed by concatenating the coding exons. The last exon-exon junction is the one between exon $3$ and exon $4$. The position of this junction in the cDNA sequence corresponds to the coordinate of the last nucleotide of exon $3$. We calculate this position, $P_{junction}$, by summing the lengths of the preceding exons:\n$$P_{junction} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3$$\n$$P_{junction} = 330 + 225 + 195 = 750$$\nThus, the last exon-exon junction is located immediately after nucleotide position $c.750$.\n\nThe problem states that the PTC is located at positions $c.690$ to $c.692$.
