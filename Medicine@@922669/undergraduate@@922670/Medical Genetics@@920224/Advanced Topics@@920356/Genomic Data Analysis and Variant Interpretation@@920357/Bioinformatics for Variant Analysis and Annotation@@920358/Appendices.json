All concepts—SNV, diploidy, Phred-scaled likelihoods, allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, Bayes' theorem, and Genotype Quality (GQ)—are established and fundamental components of variant analysis pipelines (e.g., as implemented in the Genome Analysis Toolkit, GATK).\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique numerical solution.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the Genotype Quality (GQ) for a given Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV). This involves several steps: converting the provided Phred-scaled Likelihoods (PL) into raw likelihoods, calculating genotype prior probabilities from the given allele frequency, applying Bayes' theorem to determine posterior genotype probabilities, identifying the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) genotype, and finally calculating GQ based on its definition.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Phred-scaled Likelihoods (PL) to Likelihoods**\n\nThe Phred scale is a logarithmic scale defined as $PL = -10 \\log_{10}(P)$, where $P$ is a probability. In the context of variant calling, PL values represent the likelihood of the data given a specific genotype, but on this logarithmic scale. The problem states the PL values are normalized so the minimum is $0$. This implies that the likelihoods, $L(G_i) = P(D|G_i)$ (where $D$ is the sequencing data and $G_i$ is the genotype), are related to the PL values by the following transformation:\n$$\nL(G_i) \\propto 10^{-PL(G_i)/10}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality is irrelevant as it will cancel out during the normalization step in Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe given PL values for the genotypes $G_{0/0}$, $G_{0/1}$, and $G_{1/1}$ are $35$, $0$, and $45$, respectively.\nThe relative likelihoods are:\n-   For homozygous reference ($G_{0/0}$): $L(G_{0/0}) \\propto 10^{-35/10} = 10^{-3.5}$\n-   For heterozygous ($G_{0/1}$): $L(G_{0/1}) \\propto 10^{-0/10} = 10^0 = 1$\n-   For homozygous alternate ($G_{1/1}$): $L(G_{1/1}) \\propto 10^{-45/10} = 10^{-4.5}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Prior Genotype Probabilities**\n\nWe are instructed to assume Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) to calculate the prior probabilities for each genotype. The alternate-allele frequency is given as $q = 0.02$. The reference-allele frequency, $p$, is therefore:\n$$\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\n$$\nUnder HWE, the prior probabilities of the three genotypes are:\n-   $P(G_{0/0}) = p^2 = (0.98)^2 = 0.9604$\n-   $P(G_{0/1}) = 2pq = 2(0.98)(0.02) = 0.0392$\n-   $P(G_{1/1}) = q^2 = (0.02)^2 = 0.0004$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Posterior Genotype Probabilities using Bayes' Theorem**\n\nBayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a genotype given the data is proportional to the likelihood of the data given the genotype multiplied by the prior probability of the genotype:\n$$\nP(G_i|D) = \\frac{P(D|G_i) P(G_i)}{\\sum_{j} P(D|G_j) P(G_j)} = \\frac{L(G_i) P(G_i)}{\\sum_{j} L(G_j) P(G_j)}\n$$\nLet's first compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities, which are the product of the relative likelihood and the prior, $U(G_i) = L(G_i) \\times P(G_i)$:\n-   $U(G_{0/0}) = 10^{-3.5} \\times (0.98)^2 = 10^{-3.5} \\times 0.9604 \\approx 0.000303703$\n-   $U(G_{0/1}) = 1 \\times 2(0.98)(0.02) = 1 \\times 0.0392 = 0.0392$\n-   $U(G_{1/1}) = 10^{-4.5} \\times (0.02)^2 = 10^{-4.5} \\times 0.0004 \\approx 1.26491 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\nThe normalization constant, $K$, is the sum of these unnormalized posteriors:\n$$\nK = U(G_{0/0}) + U(G_{0/1}) + U(G_{1/1})\n$$\n$$\nK \\approx 0.000303703 + 0.0392 + 1.26491 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 0.039503716\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the normalized posterior probabilities:\n-   $P(G_{0/0}|D) = \\frac{U(G_{0/0})}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.000303703}{0.039503716} \\approx 0.0076880$\n-   $P(G_{0/1}|D) = \\frac{U(G_{0/1})}{K} \\approx \\frac{0.0392}{0.039503716} \\approx 0.9923120$\n-   $P(G_{1/1}|D) = \\frac{U(G_{1/1})}{K} \\approx \\frac{1.26491 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.039503716} \\approx 0.0000003$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Genotype Quality (GQ)**\n\nFirst, we identify the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) genotype, which is the genotype with the highest posterior probability. By inspection, this is the heterozygous genotype $G_{0/1}$:\n$$\nG_{MAP} = G_{0/1} \\text{ since } P(G_{0/1}|D) \\approx 0.9923\n$$\nThe Genotype Quality (GQ) is defined as the Phred-scaled probability that the MAP genotype call is incorrect. The probability of an incorrect call, $P(\\text{error})$, is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all non-MAP genotypes. This is equivalent to $1$ minus the posterior probability of the MAP genotype.\n$$\nP(\\text{error}) = P(G_{0/0}|D) + P(G_{1/1}|D) = 1 - P(G_{MAP}|D)\n$$\nUsing the values from Step 3:\n$$\nP(\\text{error}) = 1 - P(G_{0/1}|D) \\approx 1 - 0.9923120 = 0.0076880\n$$\nEquivalently, and with potentially less rounding error, we can sum the probabilities of the other genotypes:\n$$\nP(\\text{error}) = P(G_{0/0}|D) + P(G_{1/1}|D) \\approx 0.0076880 + 0.0000003 = 0.0076883\n$$\nLet's use the more precise fraction form:\n$$\nP(\\text{error}) = \\frac{U(G_{0/0}) + U(G_{1/1})}{K} = \\frac{10^{-3.5}(0.9604) + 10^{-4.5}(0.0004)}{10^{-3.5}(0.9604) + 0.0392 + 10^{-4.5}(0.0004)} \\approx \\frac{0.0003037157}{0.0395037157} \\approx 0.00768828\n$$\nFinally, we compute GQ using its Phred-scale definition:\n$$\nGQ = -10 \\log_{10}(P(\\text{error}))\n$$\n$$\nGQ = -10 \\log_{10}(0.00768828) \\approx -10 \\times (-2.114146) \\approx 21.14146\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nGQ \\approx 21.14\n$$\n\nThe assumptions required for this calculation are:\n1.  The likelihood of the data given a genotype, $L(G)$, is related to the Phred-scaled likelihood $PL(G)$ by $L(G) \\propto 10^{-PL(G)/10}$.\n2.  The population from which the sample is drawn conforms to Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, which allows genotype priors to be calculated as $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$ from allele frequencies.\n3.  Bayes' theorem is the correct statistical framework for combining prior beliefs (genotype probabilities) with new evidence (sequencing data likelihoods) to form updated posterior beliefs.\n4.

Assume a large, randomly mating human population in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), where allele frequencies are stable and genotype frequencies follow $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$ for the three genotypes defined by major allele frequency $p$ and minor (putative pathogenic) allele frequency $q$, with $p+q=1$.

It uses standard, fundamental principles of population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium), medical genetics (prevalence, penetrance), and bioinformatics (variant filtering logic). The parameters provided ($P$, $g$, $a$, $\\pi$) are realistic for a rare autosomal dominant disorder. The derivation of a maximum credible allele frequency is a well-established, critical component of clinical variant interpretation guidelines. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific or logical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be formulated.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by connecting the population-level disease prevalence to the allele-level genetic parameters.\n\n1.  **Maximum Disease Prevalence Attributable to a Single Variant:**\n    The total prevalence of the disorder in the population is given as $P$. The gene of interest accounts for at most a fraction $g$ of this prevalence. Therefore, the maximum prevalence of the disorder attributable to pathogenic variants in this specific gene, $P_{\\text{gene}}$, is:\n    $$P_{\\text{gene}} = P \\cdot g$$\n    Furthermore, a single pathogenic variant within this gene is posited to account for at most a fraction $a$ of the gene-specific cases. Thus, the maximum credible prevalence of the disorder caused by this one variant, $P_{\\text{variant,max}}$, is:\n    $$P_{\\text{variant,max}} = P_{\\text{gene}} \\cdot a = P \\cdot g \\cdot a$$\n\n2.  **Prevalence Derived from Allele Frequency and Penetrance:**\n    The prevalence of a genetic disorder can also be expressed from the ground up, starting with the frequency of the causal allele(s). For a single causal variant with allele frequency $q$ in a population in HWE, the frequencies of the genotypes are:\n    - Homozygous wild-type: $p^2$\n    - Heterozygous: $2pq$\n    - Homozygous for the variant: $q^2$\n\n    For an autosomal dominant disorder, individuals with heterozygous ($2pq$) and homozygous variant ($q^2$) genotypes are at risk. The prevalence of the disease is the sum of the frequencies of these genotypes, each multiplied by its respective penetrance. Penetrance is the probability that an individual with a pathogenic genotype will manifest the phenotype.\n    Let $\\pi_{\\text{het}}$ be the penetrance for heterozygotes and $\\pi_{\\text{hom}}$ be the penetrance for homozygotes. The prevalence caused by the variant, $P_{\\text{variant}}$, is:\n    $$P_{\\text{variant}} = (2pq) \\cdot \\pi_{\\text{het}} + (q^2) \\cdot \\pi_{\\text{hom}}$$\n    The problem provides the penetrance for heterozygotes, $\\pi = 0.60$. We are also instructed to use the rare-allele approximation, where $q \\ll 1$. This has two consequences:\n    - First, $p = 1 - q \\approx 1$, so the heterozygous genotype frequency $2pq \\approx 2q$.\n    - Second, the frequency of homozygous variant individuals, $q^2$, is extremely small and considered negligible compared to the heterozygous frequency. For instance, if $q=10^{-4}$, then $2q=2 \\times 10^{-4}$ while $q^2=10^{-8}$, which is $2000$ times smaller.\n    Applying these approximations, the expression for the disease prevalence due to the variant simplifies to:\n    $$P_{\\text{variant}} \\approx (2q) \\cdot \\pi$$\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Maximum Credible Allele Frequency ($q_{\\text{max}}$):**\n    For a variant to be a plausible cause of the disorder, the prevalence calculated from its allele frequency must not exceed the maximum prevalence allowed by the epidemiological and heterogeneity data. This establishes the core inequality:\n    $$P_{\\text{variant}} \\le P_{\\text{variant,max}}$$\n    Substituting the expressions derived above:\n    $$2q\\pi \\le P \\cdot g \\cdot a$$\n    The maximum credible allele frequency, $q_{\\text{max}}$, is the frequency at which this condition is at its limit (i.e., the equality holds). Solving for $q$ gives the upper bound:\n    $$q \\le \\frac{P \\cdot g \\cdot a}{2\\pi}$$\n    Therefore, the maximum credible allele frequency is:\n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{P \\cdot g \\cdot a}{2\\pi}$$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n    - $P = 1/5000 = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$\n    - $g = 0.15$\n    - $a = 0.20$\n    - $\\pi = 0.60$\n    \n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.15) \\cdot (0.20)}{2 \\cdot (0.60)}$$\n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.03)}{1.2}$$\n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.2}$$\n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n    The problem requests the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$q_{\\text{max}} = 0.00000500$$\n\n5.  **Justification of the Filtering Threshold:**\n    The calculated value, $q_{\\text{max}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$, represents the theoretical ceiling for the allele frequency of any single variant responsible for this autosomal dominant disorder, given the specified constraints on prevalence, heterogeneity, and penetrance. In practical bioinformatics for clinical variant analysis, this value serves as a rational, evidence-based filtering threshold. Large-scale population databases (e.g., gnomAD) provide observed allele frequencies for millions of variants. If a candidate variant is observed in such a database with a frequency that exceeds $q_{\\text{max}}$, it is considered \"too common\" to be a cause of the rare disease in question. Its high frequency is mathematically inconsistent with the known epidemiology of the disease.\n\n    Therefore, the frequency-based filtering threshold for this dominant disorder should be set at $q_{\\text{max}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$. Any variant with an observed allele frequency greater than this value would be filtered out, or at the very least, strongly deprioritized, as it is highly unlikely to be pathogenic for this particular condition. This filtering step is crucial for reducing the vast number of benign variants and focusing the analysis on a small set of credible candidates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.00000500}\n$$", "id": "5016502"}, {"introduction": "A variant's ultimate significance lies in its effect on the gene's function.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by first constructing the mature mRNA sequence, then mapping the genomic coordinate of the variant to its corresponding transcript coordinate. From there, the affected codon is identified, and the impact of the nucleotide change on the amino acid sequence is determined using the standard genetic code.\n\nFirst, we determine the lengths of the exons and construct the spliced transcript sequence. Let $L_k$ be the length of exon $k$.\n- Exon $1$: $L_1 = 1008 - 1000 + 1 = 9$ nt. Sequence: `ATGGCTGAA`.\n- Exon $2$: $L_2 = 1108 - 1100 + 1 = 9$ nt. Sequence: `CCTGGTTAC`.\n- Exon $3$: $L_3 = 1211 - 1200 + 1 = 12$ nt. Sequence: `GAATTTGGCAAA`.\n\nThe mature transcript sequence is the concatenation of the exon sequences in order:\n`ATGGCTGAA` (Exon $1$) + `CCTGGTTAC` (Exon $2$) + `GAATTTGGCAAA` (Exon $3$)\nResulting transcript: `ATGGCTGAACCTGGTTACGAATTTGGCAAA`\nThe total length of the transcript is $L_{total} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = 9 + 9 + 12 = 30$ nucleotides.\n\nNext, we map the genomic coordinate of the variant to the transcript coordinate system. The mapping from a genomic coordinate $g$ within exon $k$ (where exons are indexed starting from $k=1$) to a $1$-based transcript coordinate $t$ is given by:\n$$t(g) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} L_j \\right) + (g - g_{start,k} + 1)$$\nwhere $g_{start,k}$ is the genomic start coordinate of exon $k$.\n\nThe variant is at $g=1103$, which is located in Exon $2$ ($k=2$). The genomic start of Exon $2$ is $g_{start,2} = 1100$. The only preceding exon is Exon $1$, with length $L_1=9$.\nThe $1$-based offset of the variant within Exon $2$ is $1103 - 1100 + 1 = 4$.\nThe transcript coordinate $t$ of the variant is:\n$$t = L_1 + (1103 - 1100 + 1) = 9 + 4 = 13$$\nSo, the variant occurs at the $13$th nucleotide of the mature transcript.\n\nThe problem states that the Coding Sequence (CDS) starts at the first nucleotide of Exon $1$. Thus, the transcript coordinates are identical to the CDS coordinates. The translation process reads the CDS in non-overlapping triplets, or codons. To find the index of the amino acid affected, we must first find the index of the codon containing the $13$th nucleotide.\n\nThe $1$-based index $i$ of a codon containing nucleotide at transcript position $t$ is given by the ceiling of $t$ divided by $3$:\n$$i = \\lceil \\frac{t}{3} \\rceil$$\nFor the variant at $t=13$, the affected codon index is:\n$$i = \\lceil \\frac{13}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 4.333... \\rceil = 5$$\nThe variant therefore affects the $5$th codon, and consequently the $5$th amino acid in the resulting polypeptide. The question asks for this index $i$.\n\nTo confirm the nature of the mutation, we identify the reference and alternate codons. The $5$th codon consists of nucleotides at transcript positions $13$, $14$, and $15$.\nThe spliced transcript is `ATGGCTGAACCTGGTTAC...`\n- The first $4$ codons occupy positions $1$ through $12$: `ATG GCT GAA CCT`.\n- The $5$th codon starts at position $13$. The nucleotides at positions $13$, $14$, and $15$ are `GGT`.\nThe reference codon is `GGT`.\n\nThe variant is a G$\\to$A substitution at genomic position $\\text{chr1}:1103$, which corresponds to transcript position $t=13$. This is the first nucleotide of the $5$th codon.\nThe alternate codon is therefore `AGT`.\n\nUsing the standard genetic code (represented with T for Thymine):\n- Reference codon `GGT` encodes the amino acid Glycine (Gly, G).\n- Alternate codon `AGT` encodes the amino acid Serine (Ser, S).\n\nThe mutation c.13G>A results in the amino acid change p.Gly5Ser. This is a missense variant, as stated in the problem. The one-based index $i$ of the amino acid in the polypeptide that is altered is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "5016539"}]}
