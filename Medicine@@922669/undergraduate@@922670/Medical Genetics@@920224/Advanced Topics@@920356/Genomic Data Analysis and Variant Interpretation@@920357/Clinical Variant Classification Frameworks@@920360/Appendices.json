Use the following well-established definitions as your starting point: disease prevalence $K$ is the proportion of affected individuals in the population; genetic heterogeneity $g$ is the proportion of all cases attributable to the gene of interest; allelic heterogeneity $a$ is the maximum proportion of cases in that gene attributable to the specific variant under consideration; penetrance $\\pi$ is the probability that a carrier of the variant manifests the disease.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics and the widely accepted ACMG/AMP framework for clinical variant classification. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data ($K, g, a, \\pi, AF_{\\text{obs}}$) to derive the formula and calculate the required ratio $R$. The terminology is precise and objective, and the assumptions (e.g., rare autosomal dominant disease where allele frequency is half the carrier frequency) are standard for this type of calculation. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nThe primary task is to derive a formula for the maximum credible population allele frequency, $AF_{\\max}$, for a pathogenic variant, and then use it to compute the ratio $R$.\n\nThe derivation begins with the definitions provided:\n- $K$: The prevalence of the disease in the population.\n- $g$: The genetic heterogeneity, representing the proportion of disease cases attributable to the gene in question.\n- $a$: The allelic heterogeneity, representing the maximum proportion of cases within that gene attributable to the specific variant being assessed.\n- $\\pi$: The penetrance, which is the probability that a carrier of the variant will manifest the disease.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum prevalence of the disease that can be attributed to the specific variant. This is found by multiplying the overall disease prevalence by the proportions for genetic and allelic heterogeneity. Let this variant-specific prevalence be $K_{\\text{variant}}$.\n$$K_{\\text{variant}} = K \\times g \\times a$$\n\nNext, we relate this prevalence to the frequency of individuals carrying the variant in the population. Let $CF$ be the carrier frequency of the variant. The number of affected individuals in the population due to this variant is the number of carriers multiplied by the probability that a carrier becomes affected (penetrance, $\\pi$). Therefore, the prevalence of the disease due to the variant can also be expressed as:\n$$K_{\\text{variant}} = CF \\times \\pi$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $K_{\\text{variant}}$, we can establish a relationship between the population genetics parameters and the carrier frequency. The maximum credible carrier frequency, $CF_{\\max}$, corresponds to the scenario where a variant accounts for its maximum possible contribution to the disease.\n$$CF_{\\max} \\times \\pi = K \\times g \\times a$$\n\nSolving for $CF_{\\max}$ gives:\n$$CF_{\\max} = \\frac{K \\times g \\times a}{\\pi}$$\n\nThe problem states that for a rare autosomal dominant disease, the population allele frequency ($AF$) is approximately one-half of the carrier frequency ($CF$). This is because in rare conditions, nearly all carriers are heterozygotes, carrying one copy of the variant allele. Thus, the frequency of the allele is half the frequency of the individuals who carry it.\n$$AF = \\frac{1}{2} CF$$\n\nApplying this relationship, we derive the formula for the maximum credible population allele frequency, $AF_{\\max}$.\n$$AF_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} CF_{\\max} = \\frac{Kga}{2\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n- $K = \\frac{1}{5000} = 0.0002$\n- $g = 0.2$\n- $a = 0.1$\n- $\\pi = 0.5$\n\n$$AF_{\\max} = \\frac{(0.0002) \\times (0.2) \\times (0.1)}{2 \\times (0.5)}$$\n$$AF_{\\max} = \\frac{0.000004}{1}$$\n$$AF_{\\max} = 0.000004$$\n\nThe problem defines the ratio $R$ as the observed allele frequency, $AF_{\\text{obs}}$, divided by the calculated maximum credible allele frequency, $AF_{\\max}$.\n$$R = \\frac{AF_{\\text{obs}}}{AF_{\\max}}$$\n\nWe are given $AF_{\\text{obs}} = 0.0006$. We can now compute the value of $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{0.0006}{0.000004}$$\n$$R = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-4}}{4 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{6}{4} \\times 10^{-4 - (-6)} = 1.5 \\times 10^{2}$$\n$$R = 150$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $150$ can be written as $1.50 \\times 10^2$, which has three significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is needed.

The data provided (callable fraction, depth, mapping quality, genomic context flags) are standard metrics used in genomics to assess data quality at a specific locus. The core principles provided for evaluation are fundamental to the correct interpretation of next-generation sequencing data. The problem is self-contained, with no internal contradictions or missing information required to make a reasoned judgment. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe decision to apply the ACMG/AMP criterion PM$2$ hinges on whether the absence of the variant in control databases (gnomAD) is informative. This requires a critical evaluation of the data quality at the variant's locus, c.$2276$ in the *PMS2* gene. We must analyze the provided data in the context of the core principles.\n\n1.  **Genomic Context:** The variant is located in two problematic contexts:\n    - A homopolymer of 8 adenines. Short-read sequencing technologies have high error rates for insertions and deletions (indels) within homopolymer tracts, especially those with length $\\ge 6$. The variant in question is a single-nucleotide deletion (c.$2276$delA), a type of indel. Therefore, its detection is inherently unreliable in this context.\n    - A segmental duplication and region of homology with the pseudogene *PMS2CL*. This is a critical issue. High sequence similarity between the gene and the pseudogene causes short sequencing reads to map ambiguously. This ambiguity leads to low mapping quality ($MQ$), which is a measure of confidence that a read has been placed correctly in the genome. The gnomAD v$3$ data confirms this, noting a median mapping quality $MQ_{\\text{median}} = 23$. This is a very low value; high-confidence variant calls typically require $MQ$ scores of at least 30, and often $>50$. Low $MQ$ reads are often filtered out, or down-weighted, meaning a true variant might be missed.\n\n2.  **Sequencing Coverage and Callability:**\n    - **gnomAD v2 (exomes):** A median depth of $D_{\\text{median}} = 12\\times$ is insufficient for confident heterozygous variant calling, particularly for an indel in a difficult region. Furthermore, the callable fraction at a minimal depth of $20\\times$ is only $f_c^{20\\times} = 0.38$. This means that at this anemic depth, we only have callable data for $38\\%$ of the exome-sequenced population. The remaining $62\\%$ cannot be confidently assessed.\n    - **gnomAD v3 (genomes):** While better, the callable fraction at $20\\times$ is still only $f_c^{20\\times} = 0.62$. This indicates that for $38\\%$ of the genome-sequenced population, the data is insufficient for reliable genotyping. For a criterion that relies on absence, having such a large fraction of the control population be uninformative is unacceptable.\n\n3.  **Allele Number ($AN$):** The provided allele numbers (e.g., European $AN = 1800$) represent the total number of alleles in that ancestry group, not the number of *callable* alleles. Given the low callable fractions ($0.38$ and $0.62$), the effective number of alleles for which a variant could have been confidently detected is much lower. For instance, using the v$2$ data, the effective European AN is at best approximately $1800 \\times 0.38 \\approx 684$. This sample size is too small to confidently assert rarity.\n\n**Conclusion on PM2 Application:**\nThe combination of a difficult genomic context (long homopolymer, segmental duplication), demonstrably low mapping quality ($MQ_{\\text{median}} = 23$), and poor coverage ($f_c^{20\\times}$ of $0.38$ and $0.62$) renders the population data from gnomAD non-informative at this locus. The absence of the variant c.$2276$delA does not mean the variant is rare; it means the databases were very likely unable to detect it had it been present. Therefore, applying PM$2$ is scientifically incorrect. The population data for this variant must be disregarded.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Apply PM$2$ because the variant is absent in gnomAD. A sufficient guardrail is simply absence in any gnomAD dataset without regard to $D$, $MQ$, or ancestry-specific $AN$.**\nThis option's recommendation to apply PM$2$ is incorrect, as derived above. The proposed guardrail is scientifically unsound, as it ignores all principles of data quality assessment in genomics. This approach would lead to frequent and significant errors in variant interpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Do not apply PM$2$ here. A guardrail should require that either exomes or genomes achieve callable fraction $\\ge 90\\%$ at $D \\ge 30\\times$, per-ancestry $AN \\ge 20000$ for all major groups, and the locus is not in segmental duplication or homopolymer; otherwise treat population data as non-informative.**\nThis option correctly recommends not to apply PM$2$. The proposed guardrail incorporates the correct principles (coverage, depth, ancestry, context). However, some thresholds are excessively stringent. A per-ancestry $AN \\ge 20000$ is far higher than most standard protocols and would severely limit the applicability of PM$2$. While safe, it is not a practical or standard guardrail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The reasoning is sound, but the proposed guardrail is impractically strict, making it not the \"best\" justification among the choices.\n\n**C. Apply PM$2$ at a reduced strength (PM$2$_Supporting) because gnomAD shows absence despite some technical flags. A guardrail should consider coverage sufficient if $\\ge 50\\%$ of samples have $D \\ge 10\\times$ and $MQ \\ge 20$, regardless of segmental duplication or homopolymer context.**\nThis option's recommendation to apply PM$2$, even at a supporting level, is incorrect. The data is not weakly informative; it is non-informative. The proposed guardrail is dangerously lenient, using thresholds ($D \\ge 10\\times$, $MQ \\ge 20$) that are well below accepted standards for confident variant calling and explicitly ignoring critical confounders (segmental duplications, homopolymers).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Do not apply PM$2$ here and treat population data as non-informative because coverage, mapping, and context are inadequate. A guardrail should require all of the following: site-level callable fraction $\\ge 85\\%$ at $D \\ge 20\\times$ in both exomes and genomes, $MQ \\ge 30$, no segmental duplication or homopolymer length $\\ge 6$, and per major ancestry $AN \\ge 2000$; only then can absence be used for PM$2$.**\nThis option correctly concludes that PM$2$ should not be applied and that the population data should be treated as non-informative due to inadequate quality. The proposed guardrail is excellent, comprehensive, and aligns with current best practices in clinical genomics.\n- $f_c \\ge 85\\%$ at $D \\ge 20\\times$: A strong and practical standard for coverage.\n- $MQ \\ge 30$: A reasonable minimum threshold for mapping quality, which correctly identifies the data for this *PMS2* variant ($MQ_{\\text{median}} = 23$) as inadequate.\n- no segmental duplication or homopolymer length $\\ge 6$: Specific and correct exclusion criteria for problematic genomic contexts. The given variant is in a homopolymer of length 8, so it would be correctly excluded.\n- per major ancestry $AN \\ge 2000$: A standard and statistically reasonable threshold for allele counts.\nThis option provides the correct action, the correct rationale, and the most scientifically sound and practical quantitative guardrail.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "5021401"}, {"introduction": "The ACMG/AMP framework provides general guidelines, but its true power is realized when tailored with gene-specific knowledge.

Your rules must be derived from first principles using foundational definitions and well-tested facts, without relying on shortcut formulas.\n\nBegin from the following foundational base:\n- The central dogma of molecular biology establishes that variants that alter protein sequence (for example, missense) can affect function if they occur within critical protein domains. This is a qualitative statement, but it motivates the mapping from genomic variant to protein position.\n- The ACMG and AMP framework defines PM1 as applicable when a variant lies in a mutational hot spot or functional domain critical to protein function and where benign variation is absent or rare. This supplies the structural basis for rule design but not a computational implementation.\n- Population genetics facts: regions that tolerate benign variation will show relatively higher densities of benign missense observations, while constrained regions will show lower densities.

We select the Interacting-heads domain due to its lower benign density ($0.7  2.0$).\n- Rule $4$: The selected domain (Interacting-heads) has properties: critical=True, $d=0.7$, $h=2.5$.\n    a. (Strong): The domain is critical, but $d=0.7$ is not $\\le 0.5$. Condition fails.\n    b. (Moderate): The domain is critical. We check the OR condition: ($d \\le 1.5$ OR $h \\ge 1.5$).

This domain is selected.\n- Rule $4$: The Converter domain is critical, $d=0.3 \\le 0.5$, and $h=4.2 \\ge 2.0$. The conditions for PM1 Strong are met.\n- Result: $3$.\n\n**Case 9: ($p=840$, $t=\\text{\"missense\"}$, $b=\\text{False}$)**\n- Rules $1$ and $2$: We proceed.\n- Rule $3$: Position $p=840$ falls only into the Coiled-coil rod domain ($p \\in [840, 1935]$).\n- Rule $4$:\n    a.

(Strong): Domain is critical, but $d=0.6$ is not $\\le 0.5$. Condition fails.\n    b. (Moderate): Domain is critical. We check ($d \\le 1.5$ OR $h \\ge 1.5$). Since $d=0.6 \\le 1.5$ and $h=1.8 \\ge 1.5$, the condition is met.\n- Result: $2$.\n\n**Case 11: ($p=1785$, $t=\\text{\"missense\"}$, $b=\\text{True}$)**\n- Rule $2$: The boolean $b$ is $\\text{True}$.\n- Result: $0$.\n\nSummary of results:\n- Case 1: $3$\n- Case 2: $0$\n- Case 3: $1$\n- Case 4: $0$\n- Case 5: $0$\n- Case 6: $0$\n- Case 7: $2$\n- Case 8: $3$\n- Case 9: $1$\n- Case 10: $2$\n- Case 11: $0$\n\nThe final output is the list $[3,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,1,2,0]$.
