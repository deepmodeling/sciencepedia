Assume base-calling errors across different reads are independent and model each base call as a Bernoulli trial with error probability $p$. \n\nPart A (derivation of expected error rate at a locus): Starting from the Phred quality definition and the linearity of expectation, derive an expression for the expected number of erroneous base calls at a locus with total depth $D$ and per-read quality scores $Q_{1},Q_{2},\\dots,Q_{D}$.

It is based on standard definitions and models used in bioinformatics for analyzing sequencing data, specifically the Phred quality score and the probabilistic treatment of base-calling errors. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nPart A: Derivation of expected error rate at a locus.\n\nThe Phred quality score $Q$ is defined in relation to the base-calling error probability $p$ as:\n$$Q = -10\\log_{10}(p)$$\nwhere $p = \\Pr(\\text{base is incorrect}\\mid Q)$. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the error probability $p$ as a function of the quality score $Q$:\n$$-\\frac{Q}{10} = \\log_{10}(p)$$\n$$p = 10^{-Q/10}$$\nAt a locus with sequencing depth $D$, there are $D$ reads covering that position. Let the quality scores for the base calls in these reads be $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, \\dots, Q_{D}$. The corresponding error probability for the $i$-th read is $p_i = 10^{-Q_i/10}$.\n\nWe model each base call as an independent Bernoulli trial. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for an error in the $i$-th read, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, D\\}$.\n$X_i=1$ if the base call is erroneous (with probability $p_i$).\n$X_i=0$ if the base call is correct (with probability $1-p_i$).\n\nThe expected value of this indicator variable is:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times p_i) + (0 \\times (1-p_i)) = p_i$$\nThe total number of erroneous base calls at the locus, which we can denote by the random variable $N_{err}$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$N_{err} = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of erroneous base calls is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$E[N_{err}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{D} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} p_i$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_i$ in terms of $Q_i$, we obtain the general expression for the expected number of erroneous base calls:\n$$E[N_{err}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} 10^{-Q_i/10}$$\nNow, we specialize this to the case where all reads at the locus satisfy a uniform minimum base quality threshold, $Q_{\\min}$. This means that for every read $i$, its quality score $Q_i$ satisfies $Q_i \\ge Q_{\\min}$.\n\nTo find a tight upper bound on the expected number of erroneous base calls, we analyze the relationship between the error probability $p$ and the quality score $Q$. The function $p(Q) = 10^{-Q/10}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $Q$. Therefore, if $Q_i \\ge Q_{\\min}$, it follows that:\n$$p_i = 10^{-Q_i/10} \\le 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$$\nApplying this inequality to each term in the sum for the expected number of errors:\n$$E[N_{err}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} p_i \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{D} 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$$\nSince the term $10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $i$, we can simplify the sum:\n$$E[N_{err}] \\le D \\cdot 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$$\nThis provides a tight upper bound on the expected number of erroneous base calls. The bound is tight because if all reads have a quality score exactly equal to the minimum threshold, i.e., $Q_i = Q_{\\min}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, D$, then the inequality becomes an equality.\n\nPart B: Setting a minimum base quality threshold for variant evidence.\n\nThe problem requires that a single-nucleotide variant be supported by at least $n$ independent reads, each meeting or exceeding a uniform base quality threshold $Q_{\\min}$. We are given the constraint that the probability that all $n$ supporting reads are erroneous calls must be at most $\\alpha$.\nLet the event that all $n$ supporting reads are erroneous be denoted by $\\mathcal{E}$. The reads are assumed to be independent. Therefore, the probability of this event is the product of the individual error probabilities of the $n$ reads:\n$$\\Pr(\\mathcal{E}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} p_j$$\nwhere $p_j$ is the error probability for the $j$-th supporting read. Each of these reads has a quality score $Q_j \\ge Q_{\\min}$, which implies $p_j \\le 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a conservative worst-case analysis. This means we must assume the highest possible error probability for each read that passes the quality filter. The highest error probability for a read with $Q_j \\ge Q_{\\min}$ occurs when $Q_j$ is at its minimum possible value, $Q_j = Q_{\\min}$. Thus, we assume $p_j = 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}$ for all $j=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nUnder this assumption, the probability $\\Pr(\\mathcal{E})$ becomes:\n$$\\Pr(\\mathcal{E}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} 10^{-Q_{\\min}/10} = \\left(10^{-Q_{\\min}/10}\\right)^n = 10^{-n \\cdot Q_{\\min}/10}$$\nThe constraint imposed by the pipeline is $\\Pr(\\mathcal{E}) \\le \\alpha$. We substitute the expression for $\\Pr(\\mathcal{E})$ into this inequality:\n$$10^{-n \\cdot Q_{\\min}/10} \\le \\alpha$$\nWe are given the values $n=3$ and $\\alpha=10^{-9}$. Substituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$10^{-3 \\cdot Q_{\\min}/10} \\le 10^{-9}$$\nTo solve for $Q_{\\min}$, we can take the base-10 logarithm of both sides. Since $\\log_{10}(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(10^{-3 Q_{\\min}/10}\\right) \\le \\log_{10}\\left(10^{-9}\\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{3 Q_{\\min}}{10} \\le -9$$\nNow, we solve for $Q_{\\min}$. We multiply both sides by $-10$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$3 Q_{\\min} \\ge 90$$\nFinally, we divide by $3$:\n$$Q_{\\min} \\ge 30$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal integer value of $Q_{\\min}$ that satisfies this constraint. The smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to $30$ is $30$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "5090803"}, {"introduction": "After identifying high-quality variants, a crucial next step for many rare disease cases is determining the phase of these variants—that is, whether they occur on the same chromosome copy (*cis*) or on different copies (*trans*).

It is highly relevant to the specified topic.\n    3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: There is a minor linguistic ambiguity. The statement \"at least one read spans both sites\" is in contradiction with the fact that the read length ($150$ bp) is less than the variant separation ($180$ bp). However, this is immediately clarified by the parenthetical clause, \"(i.e., both positions are directly observed on the same physical DNA fragment)\". This latter definition refers to a \"spanning read pair\" derived from a single DNA insert, which is standard terminology. Since the mean insert size ($350$ bp) is greater than the separation ($180$ bp), such spanning fragments are expected. We proceed by accepting the parenthetical as the intended, correct definition. The total count of spanning reads ($18+20+1+1 = 40$) is consistent.\n    4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The scenario is realistic.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed, leading to a unique statistical conclusion.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires a non-trivial application of probability and likelihood theory.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The conclusion is verifiable through standard statistical methods.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed valid and well-posed, with a minor, clarified ambiguity. We can proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem is to determine if the two heterozygous variants are in cis or in trans. This is a problem of haplotype phasing. We are given data from $N_{total}=40$ read pairs that span both variant sites, and we must compare the likelihood of this data under two mutually exclusive hypotheses.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1.  $H_{cis}$: The variants are in cis. The two parental chromosomes have haplotypes ($\\mathrm{Alt1}$, $\\mathrm{Alt2}$) and ($\\mathrm{Ref1}$, $\\mathrm{Ref2}$).\n2.  $H_{trans}$: The variants are in trans. The two parental chromosomes have haplotypes ($\\mathrm{Alt1}$, $\\mathrm{Ref2}$) and ($\\mathrm{Ref1}$, $\\mathrm{Alt2}$).\n\n**Probabilistic Model:**\nWe are given a per-site error probability $e = 0.01$. The probability of correctly reading a base at a site is $1-e = 0.99$. Since errors at the two sites are independent, the probability of observing a specific two-site read, given a true-originating haplotype, can be calculated. For any given read pair, we assume it samples one of the two parental chromosomes with equal probability ($p=0.5$).\n\nLet's calculate the probability of observing each of the four possible read-pair patterns under each hypothesis.\n\n**Likelihood under $H_{cis}$ (True haplotypes: $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ and $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$):**\n-   $P(\\text{observe Alt1-Alt2} | H_{cis})$: Sample $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ (prob $0.5$) and read both sites correctly (prob $(1-e)^2$), OR sample $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread both sites (prob $e^2$).\n    $p_{\\mathrm{AA}|cis} = 0.5 \\times (1-e)^2 + 0.5 \\times e^2 = 0.5(0.99^2 + 0.01^2) = 0.5(0.9801 + 0.0001) = 0.4901$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Ref1-Ref2} | H_{cis})$: Symmetric to the above.\n    $p_{\\mathrm{RR}|cis} = 0.5 \\times (1-e)^2 + 0.5 \\times e^2 = 0.4901$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Alt1-Ref2} | H_{cis})$: Sample $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread site 2 (prob $e(1-e)$), OR sample $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread site 1 (prob $e(1-e)$).\n    $p_{\\mathrm{AR}|cis} = 0.5 \\times e(1-e) + 0.5 \\times e(1-e) = e(1-e) = 0.01 \\times 0.99 = 0.0099$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Ref1-Alt2} | H_{cis})$: Symmetric to the above.\n    $p_{\\mathrm{RA}|cis} = e(1-e) = 0.0099$.\n\n**Likelihood under $H_{trans}$ (True haplotypes: $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ and $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$):**\n-   $P(\\text{observe Alt1-Ref2} | H_{trans})$: Sample $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ (prob $0.5$) and read correctly (prob $(1-e)^2$), OR sample $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread both sites (prob $e^2$).\n    $p_{\\mathrm{AR}|trans} = 0.5 \\times (1-e)^2 + 0.5 \\times e^2 = 0.4901$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Ref1-Alt2} | H_{trans})$: Symmetric to the above.\n    $p_{\\mathrm{RA}|trans} = 0.5 \\times (1-e)^2 + 0.5 \\times e^2 = 0.4901$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Alt1-Alt2} | H_{trans})$: Sample $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread site 2 (prob $e(1-e)$), OR sample $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ (prob $0.5$) and misread site 1 (prob $e(1-e)$).\n    $p_{\\mathrm{AA}|trans} = 0.5 \\times e(1-e) + 0.5 \\times e(1-e) = e(1-e) = 0.0099$.\n-   $P(\\text{observe Ref1-Ref2} | H_{trans})$: Symmetric to the above.\n    $p_{\\mathrm{RR}|trans} = e(1-e) = 0.0099$.\n\n**Comparing Likelihoods using the Data:**\nThe data are the counts: $N_{\\mathrm{AR}} = 18$, $N_{\\mathrm{RA}} = 20$, $N_{\\mathrm{AA}} = 1$, $N_{\\mathrm{RR}} = 1$.\nThe likelihood of the data $D$ under a hypothesis $H$ is given by the multinomial probability:\n$L(H|D) \\propto p_{\\mathrm{AA}|H}^{N_{\\mathrm{AA}}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{RR}|H}^{N_{\\mathrm{RR}}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{AR}|H}^{N_{\\mathrm{AR}}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{RA}|H}^{N_{\\mathrm{RA}}}$\n\n-   $L(H_{cis}|D) \\propto (0.4901)^{1} \\times (0.4901)^{1} \\times (0.0099)^{18} \\times (0.0099)^{20} = (0.4901)^2 \\times (0.0099)^{38}$\n-   $L(H_{trans}|D) \\propto (0.0099)^{1} \\times (0.0099)^{1} \\times (0.4901)^{18} \\times (0.4901)^{20} = (0.0099)^2 \\times (0.4901)^{38}$\n\nTo compare the hypotheses, we calculate the likelihood ratio $\\Lambda$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{L(H_{trans}|D)}{L(H_{cis}|D)} = \\frac{(0.0099)^2 \\times (0.4901)^{38}}{(0.4901)^2 \\times (0.0099)^{38}} = \\left( \\frac{0.4901}{0.0099} \\right)^{38-2} = \\left( \\frac{0.4901}{0.0099} \\right)^{36} $$\n$$ \\Lambda \\approx (49.5)^{36} $$\nThis is an exceedingly large number, indicating that the data are vastly more likely under the trans hypothesis than the cis hypothesis.

The variants are in cis with high confidence; most spanning reads showing $\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$ and $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ support cis phase, and the few discordant reads are explained by error.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The data show that the vast majority of spanning reads ($38$ out of $40$) support the *trans* configuration ($\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Ref2}$ and $\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Alt2}$). Only $2$ reads support the cis configuration. Hence, the conclusion that the variants are in cis is contrary to the evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The variants are in trans with high confidence; the spanning reads overwhelmingly support opposite-phase combinations, yielding a very large likelihood ratio favoring trans, consistent with compound heterozygosity in an autosomal recessive model.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n-   \"variants are in trans with high confidence\": Correct, as shown by the likelihood ratio of $\\approx (49.5)^{36}$ and a LOD score of $\\approx 61$.\n-   \"spanning reads overwhelmingly support opposite-phase combinations\": Correct, $38$ out of $40$ reads ($N_{\\mathrm{Alt1\\mbox{-}Ref2}}=18$, $N_{\\mathrm{Ref1\\mbox{-}Alt2}}=20$) support the trans phase.\n-   \"yielding a very large likelihood ratio favoring trans\": Correct, the ratio is astronomically large.\n-   \"consistent with compound heterozygosity in an autosomal recessive model\": Correct. For a recessive disease, two loss-of-function variants in the same gene must typically be on opposite chromosomes (in trans) to disrupt the function of both gene copies. This is known as compound heterozygosity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The data are insufficient to phase because the $180$ base pair distance exceeds the $150$ base pair read length, so no direct haplotype information can be obtained from WES.**\nThis statement is based on a misunderstanding of paired-end sequencing. While a single read of length $150$ bp cannot bridge a $180$ bp gap, a read *pair* is generated from a single, larger DNA fragment (the \"insert\"). The problem states the mean insert size is $350$ bp, which is much larger than the $180$ bp distance. Therefore, a single DNA fragment can, and in this case does, span both variant sites. The reads from this fragment provide direct haplotype information. The existence of $40$ such spanning read pairs in the data explicitly refutes this claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The variants are in trans, but the confidence is low due to allelic imbalance and limited spanning coverage; additional parental sequencing is required before any inference.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. The conclusion of trans configuration is correct, but the assessment of confidence and the reasoning are flawed.\n-   \"confidence is low\": Incorrect. The likelihood ratio calculation shows extremely high confidence.\n-   \"due to allelic imbalance\": There is no evidence of significant allelic imbalance. The VAFs at both sites are very close to $0.5$ ($0.49$ and $0.52$). The counts of the two trans haplotypes in the spanning reads ($18$ vs. $20$) are also very close, consistent with balanced sampling.\n-   \"limited spanning coverage\": A coverage of $40$ spanning read pairs is not considered limited for phasing and, as demonstrated, is sufficient for a very high-confidence call.\n-   \"additional parental sequencing is required\": While parental sequencing is a definitive method for phasing, it is not required in this case because the proband's own sequencing data provides a statistically unambiguous answer.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The phase cannot be established because exonic regions have repetitive content that invalidates mapping, rendering the $40$ spanning read pairs unreliable despite high mapping quality filtering.**\nThis is a speculative claim that contradicts the premises of the problem. The problem explicitly states that the data have been filtered for high mapping quality (MAPQ $\\ge 30$). This filter is designed precisely to remove reads that map ambiguously, such as those in repetitive regions. A MAPQ of $30$ corresponds to a $1$ in $1000$ chance of the read being mapped to the wrong location.

The scenario described—a synonymous variant at an exon-intron boundary affecting pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing—is a well-documented phenomenon. The tools mentioned (WES, CADD, SpliceAI) and databases (gnomAD) are standard in the field. The ACMG/AMP framework is the clinical standard for germline variant classification. The provided values for CADD ($27$) and SpliceAI ($0.92$) are realistic for a strong candidate variant. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the most appropriate set of evidence to achieve a \"likely pathogenic\" classification for a specific variant type under a defined framework (ACMG/AMP). This is a clear, specific, and answerable question within the domain of medical genetics.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. All details are objective facts pertaining to a hypothetical but realistic clinical case.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides sufficient information to reason through the ACMG/AMP framework. It describes the variant, its predicted effect, the gene context, and the patient's phenotype, which are the core components of variant interpretation. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to determine the most appropriate set of evidence to classify a specific variant as \"likely pathogenic\" under the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The variant in question is heterozygous, synonymous, and located at the last nucleotide of an exon.\n\n**Fundamental Principles:**\n1.  **Splicing Mechanism:** Pre-mRNA splicing, the process of removing introns and joining exons, is executed by the spliceosome. The spliceosome recognizes specific consensus sequences at the exon-intron boundaries. The splice donor site (at the 5' end of the intron) consensus is not limited to the canonical `GT` dinucleotide at intronic positions `+1` and `+2`. The final nucleotides of the preceding exon are also crucial for the recognition of this site by the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a key component of the spliceosome. A variant at the last base of the exon, even if synonymous (i.e., not altering the encoded amino acid), can disrupt this recognition and weaken or abolish the splice site.\n2.  **Consequences of Splice Disruption:** A compromised splice donor site can lead to several aberrant splicing outcomes, including:\n    *   **Exon skipping:** The entire exon is omitted from the mature mRNA.\n    *   **Intron retention:** The downstream intron is not removed.\n    *   **Cryptic splice site activation:** The spliceosome uses an alternative, nearby sequence as a splice site.\n    Any of these events can alter the reading frame, leading to a downstream premature termination codon (PTC). Transcripts containing PTCs are often targeted for degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. This results in a loss-of-function (LoF) allele, as little or no functional protein is produced.\n3.  **ACMG/AMP Framework:** This framework uses a point-based system where different types of evidence are coded and weighted (e.g., Very Strong, Strong, Moderate, Supporting) to reach a final classification (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Likely Benign, Benign). A \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification requires a specific combination of evidence, such as one Very Strong and one Moderate piece of evidence, or one Strong and at least two Supporting pieces of evidence. Crucially, computational predictions alone are considered only \"Supporting\" evidence (code `PP3`) and are insufficient for a high-confidence classification.\n\n**Analysis of the Variant Evidence:**\n*   **Gene & Mechanism:** The gene has an established LoF disease mechanism. This is a prerequisite for applying the `PVS1` (Pathogenic, Very Strong) criterion, which is reserved for predicted null variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, canonical `±1,2` splice site variants, or variants proven to cause LoF).\n*   **Computational Prediction:** The high CADD score ($27$) and, more specifically, the high SpliceAI $\\Delta$-score ($0.92$) provide strong *in silico* evidence (`PP3`, Supporting) that the variant disrupts splicing.\n*   **Population Frequency:** The variant's absence from gnomAD (allele count = $0$) is strong evidence of its rarity and qualifies for the `PM2` (Pathogenic, Moderate) criterion.\n*   **The Critical Gap:** The evidence so far consists of `PM2` (Moderate) and `PP3` (Supporting). This is not enough to reach \"Likely Pathogenic.\" The very strong SpliceAI prediction suggests that the `PVS1` criterion might be applicable, but `PVS1` cannot be invoked based on a prediction alone, especially for a non-canonical splice variant. The prediction must be a validated by functional evidence.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Rely on in silico support alone: high Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) and Splice Artificial Intelligence (SpliceAI) scores, plus absence in Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), are sufficient to conclude the variant is likely pathogenic.**\nThis approach is explicitly contrary to the ACMG/AMP guidelines. `PP3` (in silico predictions) and `PM2` (rarity in controls) are not sufficient to reach a \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification. Relying solely on predictions without empirical validation is a common cause of misclassification. This would lead to a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) classification, pending further evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Combine multiple orthogonal lines of evidence: demonstrate an aberrant splicing event in patient-derived RNA (for example, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] or RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) that shows out-of-frame exon skipping or cryptic splice usage predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), confirm that loss of function is an established disease mechanism for the gene, show rarity/absence in population databases, and document a phenotype consistent with the gene’s disease spectrum with supportive segregation in the family when available.**\nThis option describes the ideal, rigorous workflow. It proposes to obtain direct functional evidence by analyzing patient RNA (`RT-PCR` or `RNA-seq`). If this confirms an aberrant splice event leading to a frameshift and predicted NMD, this constitutes strong functional evidence (`PS3`, Pathogenic, Strong). This validation allows the confident application of the `PVS1` (Pathogenic, Very Strong) criterion, as the variant is proven to be a null variant in a gene where LoF is the known mechanism. Combining `PVS1` with `PM2` (absence from gnomAD) and `PP4` (phenotype consistency) and potentially `PP1` (segregation) provides an overwhelmingly strong case for a \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification. This is the most scientifically sound and appropriate approach according to the ACMG/AMP framework.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Use non-splicing functional assays (for example, overexpression of the wild-type complementary DNA in a non-relevant cell line) to demonstrate protein overabundance and combine with high in silico scores to infer likely pathogenicity, without RNA-level analysis.**\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed and illogical. The primary hypothesis is a splicing defect. Therefore, the relevant functional assay must investigate splicing. Using a complementary DNA (`cDNA`) construct inherently bypasses the splicing process, as cDNAs lack introns. Overexpressing the *wild-type* cDNA provides no information about the effect of the patient's *variant*. Furthermore, predicting \"protein overabundance\" is the opposite of the expected outcome for a LoF mechanism. This option demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of both the predicted variant effect and appropriate functional assay design.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Discount a splicing effect because the variant is synonymous and not at the canonical $+1/+2$ donor positions; classify as a variant of uncertain significance unless the same variant is reported in at least $5$ unrelated published cases with similar phenotypes, regardless of functional evidence.**\nThis reasoning is outdated and incorrect. The biological importance of nucleotides outside the canonical `GT/AG` splice sites is well-established. A synonymous variant at the last base of an exon is a classic candidate for a splice-disrupting variant. To discount this possibility in the face of strong *in silico* evidence (SpliceAI $\\Delta$-score $=0.92$) is a major interpretative error. While case-level data (`PS4` or `PM6` criteria) is valuable, demanding an arbitrary number of published cases (e.g., $5$) while ignoring the opportunity to generate definitive functional evidence is not a rigorous or efficient diagnostic strategy. It would lead to under-classification of a likely pathogenic variant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5090854"}]}
