The problem states that the variant is rare, so we can approximate the frequency of heterozygous carriers in the population as $2p$, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

The variant is currently listed in the ClinVar database (ClinVar) as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical genetics and population genetics, well-posed with all necessary data and clear objectives, and framed in objective, precise language. All provided data and established frameworks (OMIM, ClinVar, gnomAD, ACMG/AMP) are standard and realistic within the field.\n\nThe central principle guiding the use of allele frequency in variant curation for rare Mendelian diseases is one of logical exclusion. For a disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and moderate-to-high penetrance, it is expected that any pathogenic variant causing the disease will be rare in the general population. If a variant is observed at a frequency that is significantly higher than what is compatible with the disease's prevalence and penetrance, it can be inferred that the variant is not causative and is likely a benign polymorphism.\n\nThe problem describes a missense variant, initially classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS), in a gene associated with a known autosomal dominant disease. A VUS classification implies that the available evidence is insufficient or conflicting to definitively classify the variant as either pathogenic or benign. The introduction of new, more extensive allele frequency data, particularly from ancestry-stratified cohorts in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), can provide critical evidence to resolve this uncertainty.\n\nIt is essential to use ancestry-matched allele frequencies because of population stratification. Allele frequencies for many genetic variants differ, sometimes substantially, across different ancestral populations due to founder effects, genetic drift, and population bottlenecks. Using an allele frequency from a population group to which the individual does not belong can lead to erroneous conclusions about the variant's rarity and, consequently, its potential pathogenicity. In this case, the individual is of Latino/Admixed American ancestry, so the relevant allele frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{AF}}$, is the one observed in that population, which is $f_{\\mathrm{AF}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines provide a structured framework for using different types of evidence. The problem cites two specific criteria related to allele frequency that provide evidence for a benign classification: BS1 (a strong benign criterion) and BA1 (a stand-alone benign criterion).\n\n1.  **BS1 (Strong Benign):** This criterion is applied when the allele frequency is greater than the maximum expected for the disorder. For this specific gene-disease pair, the expert-calibrated threshold for BS1 is an allele frequency of $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$. The observed ancestry-matched allele frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{AF}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}$. Since $1.20 \\times 10^{-2} > 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, the BS1 criterion is met. This provides a strong piece of evidence that the variant is benign. According to the ACMG/AMP variant classification rules, one strong piece of benign evidence (BS1) can be combined with other, weaker evidence to reach a \"Likely Benign\" classification, thereby downgrading the variant from VUS.\n\n2.  **BA1 (Stand-alone Benign):** This criterion is applied when the allele frequency in any major population control group exceeds a high, pre-defined threshold, for which a value of $5\\%$ (i.e., an allele frequency of $0.05$) is commonly used. If this criterion is met, the variant is considered too common to cause a rare Mendelian disease and can be classified as \"Benign\" on this evidence alone. The observed ancestry-matched allele frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{AF}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}$, which is $0.012$. Since $0.012 < 0.05$, the BA1 criterion is not met in this case.\n\nTherefore, the updated gnomAD data provides evidence to trigger the BS1 criterion. This strong benign evidence is sufficient to justify a re-evaluation and potential downgrading of the VUS to \"Likely Benign,\" resolving the clinical uncertainty.\n\nWe now proceed with the requested calculations.\nThe ancestry-matched allele frequency is given as $f_{\\mathrm{AF}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}$.\nThe BA1 threshold is given as $0.05$.\nThe BS1 threshold is given as $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe first ratio to compute is $r_{\\mathrm{BA1}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{BA1}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{AF}}}{0.05} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-2}}{0.05} = \\frac{0.0120}{0.05} = 0.24$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.240$.\n\nThe second ratio to compute is $r_{\\mathrm{BS1}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{BS1}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{AF}}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.0120}{0.0010} = 12$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $12.0$.\n\nThe value $r_{\\mathrm{BS1}} = 12.0$ quantitatively demonstrates that the observed allele frequency is $12$ times higher than the maximum credible frequency for a pathogenic variant, strongly supporting the application of the BS1 criterion.

The point estimate for the allele frequency, denoted as $AF$, is calculated as the ratio of the allele count ($AC$) to the total number of alleles sampled ($AN$).\nGiven:\n$AC = 3$\n$AN = 200{,}000$\n\nThe allele frequency is:\n$$AF = \\frac{AC}{AN} = \\frac{3}{200{,}000} = 0.000015$$\nExpressed in scientific notation and rounded to four significant figures, this is $1.500 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nNext, we compute the exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for this binomial proportion. The confidence level is given as $0.95$, which corresponds to a significance level $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. The Clopper-Pearson interval $[p_L, p_U]$ is constructed by inverting two one-sided binomial tests. Let $k = AC$ be the number of observed successes (alleles) and $n = AN$ be the number of trials (chromosomes).\n\nThe lower bound, $p_L$, is the value of the binomial parameter $p$ for which the probability of observing $k$ or more successes is equal to $\\alpha/2$. This is defined by the equation:\n$$\\sum_{i=k}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} p_L^i (1-p_L)^{n-i} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the $\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ quantile of the Beta distribution with parameters $k$ and $n-k+1$.\nFor our problem, $k=3$, $n=200{,}000$, and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The lower bound is the $0.025$ quantile of a $\\text{Beta}(3, 200{,}000 - 3 + 1)$ or $\\text{Beta}(3, 199998)$ distribution.\nCalculation yields:\n$$p_L \\approx 0.0000030903$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $p_L = 3.090 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nThe upper bound, $p_U$, is the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing $k$ or fewer successes is equal to $\\alpha/2$. This is defined by the equation:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i} p_U^i (1-p_U)^{n-i} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the $1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ quantile of the Beta distribution with parameters $k+1$ and $n-k$.\nFor our problem, $k+1=4$, $n-k = 199997$, and $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The upper bound is the $0.975$ quantile of a $\\text{Beta}(4, 199997)$ distribution.\nCalculation yields:\n$$p_U \\approx 0.000043855$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $p_U = 4.386 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nThus, the point estimate and the $95\\%$ confidence interval are $AF = 1.500 \\times 10^{-5}$ and $[3.090 \\times 10^{-6}, 4.386 \\times 10^{-5}]$.\n\nSecond, we address the qualitative part of the problem. We are asked to consider a scenario where all $3$ observed alleles are found within a single ancestry subgroup with a total allele number $AN_{\\mathrm{sub}} = 30{,}000$. This phenomenon is known as population stratification.\n\nIn this scenario, the allele frequency specific to this subgroup, $AF_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, is:\n$$AF_{\\mathrm{sub}} = \\frac{3}{30{,}000} = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nThis ancestry-specific allele frequency ($1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$) is approximately $6.7$ times higher than the globally calculated allele frequency ($1.500 \\times 10^{-5}$). In other individuals of different ancestries (totaling $AN = 200{,}000 - 30{,}000 = 170{,}000$ alleles), the variant is completely absent ($AC=0$).\n\nThis finding significantly alters clinical interpretation. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for variant interpretation use allele frequency as a critical piece of evidence. Specifically, criterion BS1 (Benign, Strong) is met if the \"allele frequency is greater than expected for the disorder\". Information on disease prevalence and inheritance patterns, often cataloged in OMIM, is used to establish this expectation. For many severe, highly penetrant Mendelian disorders described in OMIM, pathogenic alleles are expected to be exceptionally rare. An allele frequency of $1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ ($1$ in $10{,}000$ alleles) within a subpopulation might be too high for such a disorder, suggesting the variant is more likely a benign polymorphism common in that specific ancestry group rather than a high-penetrance pathogenic variant. The initial, lower global frequency of $1.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ might not have triggered this suspicion.\n\nThis stratification also impacts the use of evidence from ClinVar. ClinVar aggregates variant classifications from multiple sources. Conflicting interpretations (e.g., one lab calls it \"Likely Pathogenic,\" another \"Uncertain\") can arise if different submitters have access to different levels of population data granularity. A laboratory that fails to account for stratification might base its assessment on the lower global frequency, potentially overestimating the evidence for pathogenicity. Conversely, a curator aware of the ancestry-specific enrichment can correctly apply the BS1 criterion, leading to a more conservative and accurate classification, such as \"Likely Benign\" or downgrading from \"Pathogenic\" to \"Uncertain Significance\". This underscores the critical importance of using ancestry-matched population data in variant curation to avoid misinterpreting benign, population-specific polymorphisms as disease-causing variants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.500 \\times 10^{-5} & 3.090 \\times 10^{-6} & 4.386 \\times 10^{-5} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5036692"}]}
