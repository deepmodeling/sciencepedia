Epistemic uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising from limited knowledge about the model and data-generating process; it can, in principle, be reduced through improved study design, validation, and transparency.\n\nTo evaluate methodological rigor and its implications for epistemic reliability, the study is to be scored using a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), defined here as a weighted sum of items that capture transparency, validity, and generalizability.

The study scored $+3$.\n- `Multiple segmentations`: Addresses feature stability to reader-dependent contouring (data uncertainty). The study scored $+2$.\n- `Feature reduction and overfitting control`: Directly mitigates model overfitting and improves generalizability (model uncertainty). The study scored $+3$.\n- `Discrimination performance reported with uncertainty`: Quantifies the statistical uncertainty of the performance estimate (model uncertainty). The study scored $+2$.\n- `Calibration assessed`: Ensures the model's probability outputs are reliable, which is a core part of quantifying predictive uncertainty (model uncertainty). The study scored $+2$.\n- `External validation`: The most critical test of a model's generalizability, directly probing for overfitting and dataset-specific biases (model uncertainty). The study scored $+4$.\n- `Open science`: Enhances transparency, allowing the community to vet the methods and code, thereby reducing systemic epistemic uncertainty. The study scored $+2$.\n\nThe subtotal for these specific items in this study is $0 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 18$.

These variance components are estimated from the mean squares (MS) obtained via a two-way ANOVA.\n\n**1. ANOVA Calculations**\n\nFirst, we organize the data and compute totals. Let $y_{ij}$ be the measurement for subject $i$ and rater $j$.\nThe number of subjects is $n=8$, and the number of raters is $k=2$. The total number of measurements is $N = nk = 16$.\n\nThe sums for each subject (lesion) $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} y_{ij}$ are:\n- $S_1 = 1.20 + 1.10 = 2.30$\n- $S_2 = 0.95 + 0.90 = 1.85$\n- $S_3 = 1.50 + 1.55 = 3.05$\n- $S_4 = 1.05 + 1.00 = 2.05$\n- $S_5 = 1.80 + 1.70 = 3.50$\n- $S_6 = 1.30 + 1.25 = 2.55$\n- $S_7 = 0.85 + 0.80 = 1.65$\n- $S_8 = 1.60 + 1.62 = 3.22$\n\nThe sums for each rater $R_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{ij}$ are:\n- $R_1 = 1.20+0.95+1.50+1.05+1.80+1.30+0.85+1.60 = 10.25$\n- $R_2 = 1.10+0.90+1.55+1.00+1.70+1.25+0.80+1.62 = 9.92$\n\nThe Grand Total $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} y_{ij} = R_1 + R_2 = 10.25 + 9.92 = 20.17$.\nThe Correction Factor is $CF = \\frac{T^2}{N} = \\frac{(20.17)^2}{16} = \\frac{406.8289}{16} = 25.42680625$.\n\nNext, we compute the Sums of Squares (SS):\n- Total Sum of Squares ($SS_{Total}$):\n$$ SS_{Total} = \\sum_{i,j} y_{ij}^2 - CF $$\n$$ \\sum_{i,j} y_{ij}^2 = 1.20^2 + 1.10^2 + \\dots + 1.60^2 + 1.62^2 = 27.0469 $$\n$$ SS_{Total} = 27.0469 - 25.42680625 = 1.62009375 $$\n\n- Sum of Squares for Subjects ($SS_S$):\n$$ SS_S = \\frac{\\sum_{i} S_i^2}{k} - CF $$\n$$ \\sum_{i} S_i^2 = 2.30^2 + 1.85^2 + \\dots + 3.22^2 = 54.0609 $$\n$$ SS_S = \\frac{54.0609}{2} - 25.42680625 = 27.03045 - 25.42680625 = 1.60364375 $$\n\n- Sum of Squares for Raters ($SS_R$):\n$$ SS_R = \\frac{\\sum_{j} R_j^2}{n} - CF $$\n$$ \\sum_{j} R_j^2 = 10.25^2 + 9.92^2 = 105.0625 + 98.4064 = 203.4689 $$\n$$ SS_R = \\frac{203.4689}{8} - 25.42680625 = 25.4336125 - 25.42680625 = 0.00680625 $$\n\n- Sum of Squares for Error ($SS_E$):\n$$ SS_E = SS_{Total} - SS_S - SS_R $$\n$$ SS_E = 1.62009375 - 1.60364375 - 0.00680625 = 0.00964375 $$\n\nNow, we construct the ANOVA table to find the Mean Squares (MS), where $MS = SS/df$.\n- Degrees of freedom for subjects: $df_S = n-1 = 8-1 = 7$\n- Degrees of freedom for raters: $df_R = k-1 = 2-1 = 1$\n- Degrees of freedom for error: $df_E = (n-1)(k-1) = 7 \\times 1 = 7$\n\n- Mean Square for Subjects: $MS_S = \\frac{SS_S}{df_S} = \\frac{1.60364375}{7} \\approx 0.22909196$\n- Mean Square for Raters: $MS_R = \\frac{SS_R}{df_R} = \\frac{0.00680625}{1} = 0.00680625$\n- Mean Square for Error: $MS_E = \\frac{SS_E}{df_E} = \\frac{0.00964375}{7} \\approx 0.00137768$\n\n**2. Estimation of Variance Components**\n\nThe expected mean squares for this model relate the MS values to the variance components:\n- $E(MS_S) = \\sigma_E^2 + k\\sigma_S^2$\n- $E(MS_R) = \\sigma_E^2 + n\\sigma_R^2$\n- $E(MS_E) = \\sigma_E^2$\n\nWe can estimate the variance components by substituting the calculated MS values:\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2 = MS_E \\approx 0.00137768$\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 = \\frac{MS_S - MS_E}{k} = \\frac{0.22909196 - 0.00137768}{2} = \\frac{0.22771428}{2} \\approx 0.11385714$\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 = \\frac{MS_R - MS_E}{n} = \\frac{0.00680625 - 0.00137768}{8} = \\frac{0.00542857}{8} \\approx 0.00067857$\n\n**3. ICC Calculation**\n\nNow we substitute the estimated variance components into the ICC formula:\n$$ ICC(A,1) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2}{\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}_E^2} $$\n$$ ICC(A,1) = \\frac{0.11385714}{0.11385714 + 0.00067857 + 0.00137768} $$\n$$ ICC(A,1) = \\frac{0.11385714}{0.11591339} \\approx 0.9822610 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9823$.\n\n**4. Qualitative Explanation**\n\nThe variance components provide insight into the sources of measurement variability.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 \\approx 0.1139$: This is the estimated variance between subjects (lesions). It represents the \"true\" biological or pathological variability of the radiomic feature across the patient cohort. For an instrument or feature to be useful, this \"signal\" variance must be large relative to the \"noise\" variances.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 \\approx 0.0007$: This is the estimated variance between raters. It quantifies the systematic bias between the two radiologists. A non-zero value indicates that, on average, one rater tends to produce higher or lower values than the other. This component directly degrades absolute agreement and thus **reproducibility**.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2 \\approx 0.0014$: This is the residual or error variance. It consolidates two sources of variability: (1) the subject-by-rater interaction, which is the non-systematic disagreement between raters (e.g., they disagree more on some lesions than others), and (2) pure random measurement error, which affects **repeatability** (the consistency of a single rater measuring the same thing twice).\n\nIn this specific calculation, the between-subject variance ($\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 \\approx 0.1139$) is vastly larger than both the systematic rater variance ($\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 \\approx 0.0007$) and the residual error variance ($\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2 \\approx 0.0014$). The total \"error\" variance from changing raters is $\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}_E^2 \\approx 0.0021$. The ratio of signal-to-total-variance ($\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 / (\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}_R^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}_E^2)$) is therefore very high, resulting in an excellent ICC of $0.9823$.\n\n**Contrast with Traditional Radiological Interpretation:**\n- For **traditional interpretation** (e.g., scoring a lesion on a $1-5$ scale), inter-rater variability is a known, significant problem. One would expect both $\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2$ to be much larger relative to $\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2$. A large $\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2$ would reflect that one radiologist is inherently more 'conservative' or 'aggressive' in their scoring. A large $\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2$ would reflect inconsistent application of subjective criteria, especially for ambiguous cases. The resulting ICC would typically be much lower, perhaps in the range of $0.4$ to $0.8$.\n- For **quantitative radiomics**, as demonstrated here, the goal is to minimize rater-dependent variability. The feature extraction is an automated, deterministic process. The only human input is the initial delineation of the region of interest. A robust segmentation protocol should lead to very small differences in the final feature value. Our results align with this expectation: the variance components associated with the raters ($\\hat{\\sigma}_R^2$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_E^2$) are two orders of magnitude smaller than the variance of the feature across lesions ($\\hat{\\sigma}_S^2$). This high reproducibility is a primary argument for the utility of radiomics over subjective human interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9823}$$", "id": "4558058"}, {"introduction": "When evaluating a new diagnostic test like a radiomics model, the \"ground truth\" is often obtained through an invasive procedure like a biopsy, which may not be performed on all patients.

The radiomics classifier results for these $R=1$ verified patients were:\n- Among $Y=1$ ($160$ cases): $T=1$ for $144$ and $T=0$ for $16$.\n- Among $Y=0$ ($40$ cases): $T=1$ for $12$ and $T=0$ for $28$.\n\nAmong the $R=0$ verified subsample ($80$ patients), clinical outcome confirmed $Y=1$ for $8$ and $Y=0$ for $72$. The radiomics classifier results for these $R=0$ verified patients were:\n- Among $Y=1$ ($8$ cases): $T=1$ for $4$ and $T=0$ for $4$.\n- Among $Y=0$ ($72$ cases): $T=1$ for $7$ and $T=0$ for $65$.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of diagnostic accuracy, the sensitivity is $P(T=1 \\mid Y=1)$ and the specificity is $P(T=0 \\mid Y=0)$. In the presence of verification that depends on $R$, consider the following two estimators of radiomics performance:\n1. The naive, unweighted estimator computed using only verified cases.\n2. An estimator that corrects for verification bias using Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), where each verified case with radiologist decision $R=r$ is weighted by $w(r)=1/\\pi(r)$.\n\nCompute:\n- The naive sensitivity and specificity using the verified subset.\n- The IPW-corrected sensitivity and specificity using weights $w(1)=1$ and $w(0)=10$.\n- The verification bias impact on sensitivity and specificity, defined as the naive estimate minus the IPW-corrected estimate for each measure.\n\nExpress the final verification bias impact on sensitivity and specificity as a two-entry row matrix, with each entry given in decimal form rounded to four significant figures. No units are required in the final answers.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions of diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity is $P(T=1 \\mid Y=1)$ and specificity is $P(T=0 \\mid Y=0)$. Under partial verification, if verification depends on the radiologist decision $R$, then using only verified cases without correction can induce verification bias. Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) uses weights $w(R)=1/\\pi(R)$, where $\\pi(R)$ is the probability that a patient with radiologist decision $R$ is verified, to reweight the verified sample so that it represents the target population under the assumption that verification is Missing At Random (MAR) given $R$ and that the positivity assumption holds ($\\pi(R)>0$ for all $R$ strata present).\n\nStep 1: Compute the naive, unweighted sensitivity and specificity using the verified subset.\n\nTotal verified with $Y=1$:\n$$\nN_{Y=1,\\text{ver}} = 160 + 8 = 168.\n$$\nAmong these, radiomics positive $T=1$:\n$$\nN_{T=1,Y=1,\\text{ver}} = 144 + 4 = 148,\n$$\nand radiomics negative $T=0$:\n$$\nN_{T=0,Y=1,\\text{ver}} = 16 + 4 = 20.\n$$\nHence, the naive sensitivity is\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Sens}}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{N_{T=1,Y=1,\\text{ver}}}{N_{Y=1,\\text{ver}}} = \\frac{148}{168} = \\frac{37}{42}.\n$$\n\nTotal verified with $Y=0$:\n$$\nN_{Y=0,\\text{ver}} = 40 + 72 = 112.\n$$\nAmong these, radiomics negative $T=0$:\n$$\nN_{T=0,Y=0,\\text{ver}} = 28 + 65 = 93,\n$$\nand radiomics positive $T=1$:\n$$\nN_{T=1,Y=0,\\text{ver}} = 12 + 7 = 19.\n$$\nHence, the naive specificity is\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Spec}}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{N_{T=0,Y=0,\\text{ver}}}{N_{Y=0,\\text{ver}}} = \\frac{93}{112}.\n$$\n\nNumerically,\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Sens}}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{37}{42} \\approx 0.8809523809,\n$$\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Spec}}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{93}{112} \\approx 0.8303571429.\n$$\n\nStep 2: Compute the IPW-corrected sensitivity and specificity using $w(1)=1$ and $w(0)=10$.\n\nIPW constructs weighted counts.
