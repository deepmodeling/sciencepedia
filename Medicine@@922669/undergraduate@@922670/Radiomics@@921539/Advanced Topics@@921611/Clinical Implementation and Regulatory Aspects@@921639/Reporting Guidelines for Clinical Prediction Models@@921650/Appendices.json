I will proceed to solve the problem.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we establish the state of the cohort before any filtering is applied.\nThe initial number of patients is $N_0 = 750$.\nThe initial number of patients with the target condition (diseased) is $D_0 = 225$.\nThe initial number of patients without the target condition (healthy) is $H_0 = N_0 - D_0 = 750 - 225 = 525$.\n\nThe initial prevalence, $P_0$, is the proportion of diseased patients:\n$$P_0 = \\frac{D_0}{N_0} = \\frac{225}{750} = \\frac{3 \\times 75}{10 \\times 75} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3$$\n\nThe initial disease odds, $O_0$, is the ratio of diseased to healthy patients:\n$$O_0 = \\frac{P_0}{1-P_0} = \\frac{D_0/N_0}{(N_0-D_0)/N_0} = \\frac{D_0}{H_0} = \\frac{225}{525} = \\frac{9 \\times 25}{21 \\times 25} = \\frac{9}{21} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nNext, we process the exclusions from Filter A.\nNumber of patients removed by Filter A: $N_A = 120$.\nNumber of diseased patients removed by Filter A: $D_A = 12$.\nNumber of healthy patients removed by Filter A: $H_A = N_A - D_A = 120 - 12 = 108$.\n\nThe state of the cohort after Filter A (denoted with subscript $1$):\nNumber of remaining patients: $N_1 = N_0 - N_A = 750 - 120 = 630$.\nNumber of remaining diseased patients: $D_1 = D_0 - D_A = 225 - 12 = 213$.\nNumber of remaining healthy patients: $H_1 = H_0 - H_A = 525 - 108 = 417$.\nWe can verify that $D_1 + H_1 = 213 + 417 = 630 = N_1$.\n\nNext, we process the exclusions from Filter B, which are applied to the remaining cohort.\nNumber of patients removed by Filter B: $N_B = 30$.\nNumber of diseased patients removed by Filter B: $D_B = 24$.\nNumber of healthy patients removed by Filter B: $H_B = N_B - D_B = 30 - 24 = 6$.\n\nThe state of the final cohort after both filters (denoted with subscript $f$):\nFinal number of patients: $N_f = N_1 - N_B = 630 - 30 = 600$.\nFinal number of diseased patients: $D_f = D_1 - D_B = 213 - 24 = 189$.\nFinal number of healthy patients: $H_f = H_1 - H_B = 417 - 6 = 411$.\nWe can verify that $D_f + H_f = 189 + 411 = 600 = N_f$.\n\n**Task 1: Post-filter prevalence and absolute change in prevalence.**\nThe post-filter prevalence, $P_f$, is:\n$$P_f = \\frac{D_f}{N_f} = \\frac{189}{600} = \\frac{63}{200} = 0.315$$\nThe absolute change in prevalence is $\\Delta P = P_f - P_0$:\n$$\\Delta P = 0.315 - 0.30 = 0.015$$\nThe prevalence increased by an absolute amount of $0.015$, or $1.5\\%$.\n\n**Task 2: Multiplicative factor of the disease odds.**\nThe post-filter disease odds, $O_f$, is:\n$$O_f = \\frac{D_f}{H_f} = \\frac{189}{411}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction. The sum of digits for $189$ is $18$, and for $411$ is $6$. Both are divisible by $3$.\n$$O_f = \\frac{189 \\div 3}{411 \\div 3} = \\frac{63}{137}$$\n$137$ is a prime number, so this fraction is fully simplified.\n\nThe multiplicative factor, which we will call $M_{bias}$, is the ratio of the post-filter odds to the pre-filter odds:\n$$M_{bias} = \\frac{O_f}{O_0}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$M_{bias} = \\frac{63/137}{3/7}$$\n$$M_{bias} = \\frac{63}{137} \\times \\frac{7}{3}$$\n$$M_{bias} = \\frac{63 \\times 7}{137 \\times 3} = \\frac{(21 \\times 3) \\times 7}{137 \\times 3} = \\frac{21 \\times 7}{137}$$\n$$M_{bias} = \\frac{147}{137}$$\nThis factor represents the selection bias introduced by the quality filters, expressed as a change in the odds of having the target condition. Since $M_{bias} > 1$, the filtering process has enriched the cohort with a higher proportion of cases relative to controls.\n\n**TRIPOD Reporting Elements:**\nThe problem asks to state, in brief, which TRIPOD reporting elements should document these steps. The transparent reporting of participant selection is a core tenet of the TRIPOD statement. The process described, including the quantitative impact on case-mix, should be documented under **Item 5 (Participants)**, which requires a full description of eligibility criteria and methods of participant selection. The entire flow of participants, from initial assessment to the final analysis set, must be visually depicted in a flow diagram as mandated by **Item 13a (Flow of participants)**. Finally, **Item 14a (Participants)** requires reporting the breakdown of the numbers of participants and outcome events in the development and validation cohorts, which would include the final counts ($N_f = 600$, $D_f = 189$) derived here. This documentation is critical for readers to assess the risk of selection bias and the generalizability of the final prediction model.\n\nThe final answer required is the odds-multiplicative factor from Task 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{147}{137}}$$", "id": "4558850"}, {"introduction": "A common and critical error in machine learning pipelines is \"information leakage,\" where data from outside the training set inadvertently influence model development, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.
