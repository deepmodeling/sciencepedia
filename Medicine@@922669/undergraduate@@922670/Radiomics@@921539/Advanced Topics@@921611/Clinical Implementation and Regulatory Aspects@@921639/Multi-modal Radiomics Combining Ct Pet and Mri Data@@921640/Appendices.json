It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI), well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to derive a general expression for the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ($ADC$) from two signal measurements, and second, to calculate its numerical value for a specific set of measurements.\n\nThe governing equation is the monoexponential Stejskal–Tanner model, which describes the attenuation of the DWI signal $S(b)$ as a function of the diffusion-weighting factor $b$:\n$$\nS(b) = S_0 \\exp(-b \\cdot ADC)\n$$\nHere, $S_0$ is the signal intensity at $b=0$, and $ADC$ is the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient. The term 'proportional attenuation' mentioned in the problem statement refers to the property of exponential decay, where the rate of decrease of the signal with respect to $b$ is proportional to the signal itself.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the general expression for $ADC$**\n\nTo derive an expression for $ADC$ in terms of two arbitrary measurements, let us consider two distinct $b$-values, $b_1$ and $b_2$, with their corresponding signal intensities $S(b_1)$ and $S(b_2)$. We assume $b_2 > b_1$.\n\nAccording to the model, we can write two equations:\n$$\nS(b_1) = S_0 \\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC) \\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nS(b_2) = S_0 \\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC) \\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe term $S_0$ is an unknown parameter (unless $b_1=0$). To eliminate $S_0$, we can take the ratio of equation $(2)$ to equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{S(b_2)}{S(b_1)} = \\frac{S_0 \\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC)}{S_0 \\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC)}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(x)/\\exp(y) = \\exp(x-y)$, we simplify the right side:\n$$\n\\frac{S(b_2)}{S(b_1)} = \\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC - (-b_1 \\cdot ADC)) = \\exp((-b_2 + b_1) \\cdot ADC) = \\exp(-(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC)\n$$\nTo solve for $ADC$, we must invert the exponential function. As prompted, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S(b_2)}{S(b_1)}\\right) = -(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $ADC$ by dividing by $-(b_2 - b_1)$:\n$$\nADC = -\\frac{1}{b_2 - b_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(b_2)}{S(b_1)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we can write the expression in a more intuitive form, showing signal decay from $S(b_1)$ to $S(b_2)$:\n$$\nADC = \\frac{1}{b_2 - b_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(b_1)}{S(b_2)}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $ADC$ derived from two measurements at arbitrary $b$-values $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $ADC$**\n\nThe problem provides the following specific measurements for a voxel:\n- Signal at $b=0$: $S(0) = 1000$. By definition, this is $S_0$.\n- Signal at $b=800 \\, \\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^2$: $S(800) = 300$.\n\nWe can identify our measurement points as:\n- $b_1 = 0 \\, \\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^2$ and $S(b_1) = S(0) = 1000$.\n- $b_2 = 800 \\, \\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^2$ and $S(b_2) = S(800) = 300$.\n\nWe can substitute these values directly into the derived general formula:\n$$\nADC = \\frac{1}{800 - 0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1000}{300}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nADC = \\frac{1}{800} \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The units of $b$ are $\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^2$, so the units of $ADC$ will be $\\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, as required.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) \\approx \\ln(3.3333...) \\approx 1.2039728\n$$\n$$\nADC \\approx \\frac{1.2039728}{800} \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nADC \\approx 0.001504966 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are determined by two reference points:\n1.

The scaling factor $1000$ is also dimensionless, confirming that the Hounsfield Unit is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n### Task 2: PET Standardized Uptake Value (SUV)\n\nThe body-weight Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is defined as the ratio of the decay-corrected activity concentration in tissue, $C$, to the injected activity, $A_0$, normalized by the patient's body weight, $W$. The expression is:\n$$\nSUV = \\frac{\\text{Activity concentration in tissue } [\\mathrm{activity/volume}]}{\\text{Injected activity per body mass } [\\mathrm{activity/mass}]}\n$$\nGiven values are:\n- Tissue activity concentration $C = 4.2 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Injected activity $A_0 = 370 \\ \\mathrm{MBq}$.\n- Body weight $W = 74 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nTo ensure consistency, we convert units.\n$A_0 = 370 \\ \\mathrm{MBq} = 370 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}$.\n$W = 74 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 74 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{g}$.\nThe denominator, representing the average activity concentration if distributed uniformly, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{W} = \\frac{370 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}}{74 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{370}{74} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kBq}}{\\mathrm{g}} = 5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kBq}}{\\mathrm{g}}\n$$\nThe problem states the use of the water-equivalent density approximation, where tissue density is assumed to be $\\rho \\approx 1 \\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$. This approximation makes the numerical value of concentration per unit mass ($\\mathrm{kBq}/\\mathrm{g}$) equal to the concentration per unit volume ($\\mathrm{kBq}/\\mathrm{mL}$).\nTherefore, the SUV for the voxel is:\n$$\nSUV_{\\mathrm{voxel}} = \\frac{C}{(A_0/W)} = \\frac{4.2 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}/\\mathrm{mL}}{5 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}/\\mathrm{g}} = 0.84\n$$\nThe resulting SUV is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n### Task 3: MRI Normalized Intensity Feature\n\nThe MRI feature is defined as the ratio of the voxel's T1-weighted intensity, $I$, to the reference intensity of white matter, $I_{\\mathrm{WM}}$.\nGiven values are:\n- Voxel intensity $I = 820$ (arbitrary units).\n- White matter reference intensity $I_{\\mathrm{WM}} = 1000$ (arbitrary units).\n\nThe normalized intensity feature, $M_{\\mathrm{voxel}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{voxel}} = \\frac{I}{I_{\\mathrm{WM}}} = \\frac{820}{1000} = 0.82\n$$\nThis feature is a dimensionless ratio.\n\n### Task 4: Z-Scores and Fused Score\n\nThe $z$-score for each modality is calculated using the formula $Z = \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x}$, where $x$ is the measured value, and $\\bar{x}$ and $\\sigma_x$ are the mean and standard deviation from the training cohort, respectively.\n\n**CT Z-Score ($Z_{\\mathrm{CT}}$):**\n- Voxel value $H_{\\mathrm{voxel}} = \\frac{2000}{19}$.\n- Mean $\\bar{H}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 40$.\n- Standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 30$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{voxel}} - \\bar{H}_{\\mathrm{CT}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CT}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2000}{19} - 40}{30} = \\frac{\\frac{2000 - 760}{19}}{30} = \\frac{1240}{19 \\times 30} = \\frac{124}{57}\n$$\n\n**PET Z-Score ($Z_{\\mathrm{PET}}$):**\n- Voxel value $SUV_{\\mathrm{voxel}} = 0.84$.\n- Mean $\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{PET}} = 2.0$.\n- Standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PET}} = 0.8$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{PET}} = \\frac{SUV_{\\mathrm{voxel}} - \\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{PET}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PET}}} = \\frac{0.84 - 2.0}{0.8} = \\frac{-1.16}{0.8} = -1.45\n$$\n\n**MRI Z-Score ($Z_{\\mathrm{MRI}}$):**\n- Voxel value $M_{\\mathrm{voxel}} = 0.82$.\n- Mean $\\bar{M}_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = 0.65$.\n- Standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = 0.10$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{voxel}} - \\bar{M}_{\\mathrm{MRI}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{MRI}}} = \\frac{0.82 - 0.65}{0.10} = \\frac{0.17}{0.10} = 1.7\n$$\n\nFinally, the fused score $S$ is computed as the weighted sum of the $z$-scores:\n$$\nS = w_{\\mathrm{CT}} Z_{\\mathrm{CT}} + w_{\\mathrm{PET}} Z_{\\mathrm{PET}} + w_{\\mathrm{MRI}} Z_{\\mathrm{MRI}}\n$$\nUsing the given weights $w_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 0.5$, $w_{\\mathrm{PET}} = 0.3$, and $w_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = 0.2$:\n$$\nS = (0.5)\\left(\\frac{124}{57}\\right) + (0.3)(-1.45) + (0.2)(1.7)\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{62}{57} - 0.435 + 0.34\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{62}{57} - 0.095\n$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{62}{57} \\approx 1.087719...$\n$$\nS \\approx 1.087719... - 0.095 = 0.992719...\n$$\nRounding the final fused score $S$ to four significant figures gives $0.9927$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9927}$$", "id": "4552632"}]}
