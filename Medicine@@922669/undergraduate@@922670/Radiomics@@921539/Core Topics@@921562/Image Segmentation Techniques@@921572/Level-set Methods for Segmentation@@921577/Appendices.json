The Euclidean distance between two pixel centers at coordinates $(i_{1}, j_{1})$ and $(i_{2}, j_{2})$ is defined as $\\sqrt{(i_{1} - i_{2})^{2} + (j_{1} - j_{2})^{2}}$, and pixel centers are located at integer coordinates $(i, j)$ with $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 127\\}$.

A level-set function $\\phi$ implicitly represents a contour as the set of points where $\\phi=0$. The sign of $\\phi$ indicates whether a point is inside ($\\phi0$) or outside ($\\phi0$) the region.\n\nThe most natural choice for an embedding function for a geometric shape is the signed distance function (SDF). For a point with coordinates $(i, j)$ and a circular contour of radius $r$ centered at $(i_0, j_0)$, the SDF is defined as the Euclidean distance to the center minus the radius:\n$$\n\\phi(i, j) = \\sqrt{(i - i_{0})^{2} + (j - j_{0})^{2}} - r\n$$\nThis function is negative for points inside the circle (where the distance to the center is less than $r$), positive for points outside, and zero for points exactly on the circle.\n\nThe problem specifies the center of the circular seed region as $(i_0, j_0) = (64, 64)$ and the radius as $r = 13$.

The sign convention for curvature ($\\kappa  0$ for a concavity relative to the outward normal) is consistent with the standard mathematical definition where curvature is positive for a curve turning \"towards\" its normal vector.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Convergence Condition\n\nThe evolution of the interface is governed by the normal speed $V_n$. By convention, a positive speed, $V_n  0$, corresponds to outward expansion of the contour. The contour will cease expanding when this outward speed becomes non-positive, i.e., $V_n \\leq 0$.\n\nThe model for the normal speed is given as:\n$$V_{n}=\\alpha \\kappa + \\gamma \\beta$$\n\nWe are analyzing a specific region where the contour is concave with respect to the outward normal. For this region, the signed curvature $\\kappa$ is given as:\n$$\\kappa = -\\frac{1}{R}$$\nwhere $R  0$ is the local radius of curvature.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\kappa$ into the equation for $V_n$:\n$$V_n = \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right) + \\gamma \\beta$$\n$$V_n = -\\frac{\\alpha}{R} + \\gamma \\beta$$\n\nThe term $-\\alpha/R$ represents the effect of curvature. As $\\alpha  0$ and $R  0$, this term is negative. It acts to smooth the curve by pulling the interface out of the concavity (i.e., causing a retraction or opposing the expansion). The term $\\gamma \\beta$ represents the balloon force. As $\\gamma  0$ and $\\beta  0$, this term is positive, driving the interface to expand outward into the concavity.\n\nThe interface will stop expanding when the inward pull from the curvature term equals or exceeds the outward push from the balloon term. This is the condition $V_n \\leq 0$:\n$$-\\frac{\\alpha}{R} + \\gamma \\beta \\leq 0$$\n\nTo find the condition on the radius of curvature $R$, we solve this inequality.\n$$\\gamma \\beta \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{R}$$\n\nSince $R  0$, we can multiply both sides by $R$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$R (\\gamma \\beta) \\leq \\alpha$$\n\nSince $\\gamma  0$ and $\\beta  0$, the product $\\gamma \\beta$ is positive. We can divide by it to isolate $R$:\n$$R \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$$\n\nThis inequality represents the condition under which the interface will cease its outward expansion into the concave region. If this condition is met, the curvature is sharp enough (i.e., $R$ is small enough) for the smoothing effect to counteract the balloon force. If the condition is not met, i.e., if $R  \\alpha/(\\gamma \\beta)$, then $V_n  0$, and the interface will continue to expand.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The interface will cease expanding into the concavity if and only if $R \\leq \\alpha / (\\gamma \\beta)$; otherwise it will continue to expand into the concavity.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our derived condition $R \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$ for the interface to cease expanding. The \"otherwise\" clause, stating that for $R  \\alpha / (\\gamma \\beta)$ the expansion continues, is also correct, as shown in our derivation where this leads to $V_n  0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The interface will cease expanding into the concavity if and only if $R \\geq \\alpha / (\\gamma \\beta)$; otherwise it will continue to expand into the concavity.**\nThis statement presents an inequality, $R \\geq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$, which is the logical opposite of the one derived. This would imply that shallower concavities (larger $R$) are more likely to stop the expansion, which contradicts the physical intuition of the curvature-smoothing term.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Whether the interface ceases to expand into the concavity is independent of the curvature weight $\\alpha$; it depends only on $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.**\nThe derived condition for halting expansion is $R \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$. The curvature weight $\\alpha$ is explicitly in the numerator of the right-hand side of this inequality. A larger $\\alpha$ increases the critical radius at which the front stops, making the stopping condition dependent on $\\alpha$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In any concave region where $\\kappa0$, any $\\beta0$ guarantees that the interface will stop due to the opposing action of curvature, regardless of $R$ and $\\alpha$.**\nThis statement claims that the interface will always stop in a concave region. However, our analysis shows that stopping is conditional. For any given set of parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, if the concavity is very shallow (i.e., $R$ is very large), it is possible for the condition $R \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$ to be violated. In such a case, where $R  \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma \\beta}$, the interface continues to expand. Therefore, stopping is not guaranteed and depends on $R$ and $\\alpha$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4548871"}]}
