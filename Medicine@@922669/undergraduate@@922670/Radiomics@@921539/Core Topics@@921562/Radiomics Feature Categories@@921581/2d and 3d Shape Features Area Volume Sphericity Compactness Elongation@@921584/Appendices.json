Using dimensional analysis and these normalization constraints, derive the functional form of $Q_2$ up to a multiplicative constant and determine that constant by enforcing the circle normalization.

Provide your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $Q_2(w,h)$. Do not round and do not include units; $Q_2$ is dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a two-dimensional compactness index $Q_2$ and its calculation for a specific geometry. The derivation will proceed from the given constraints using dimensional analysis and normalization.\n\nLet the compactness index be a function of the area $A$ and perimeter $P$ of a planar Region of Interest (ROI), so $Q_2 = f(A, P)$. The dimensions of area and perimeter are $[A] = L^2$ and $[P] = L^1$, where $L$ is the dimension of length.\n\nThe first constraint is that $Q_2$ must be dimensionless, i.e., $[Q_2] = L^0$. To satisfy this, $Q_2$ must be a function of a dimensionless combination of its arguments $A$ and $P$. We can form a dimensionless group by assuming a power-law combination $A^x P^y$. The dimension of this term is $[A^x P^y] = (L^2)^x (L^1)^y = L^{2x+y}$. For this to be dimensionless, the exponent must be zero: $2x+y=0$, which implies $y=-2x$.\nThus, any dimensionless quantity formed from $A$ and $P$ in this way must be proportional to $(A^x P^{-2x}) = (A/P^2)^x$. The simplest non-trivial dimensionless group is therefore $A/P^2$ (corresponding to $x=1$). Any dimensionless index $Q_2(A,P)$ must be a function of this group, i.e., $Q_2 = g(A/P^2)$.\n\nThe second constraint is invariance under uniform scaling. Let a shape be scaled by a factor $\\lambda > 0$. The area transforms as $A \\to \\lambda^2 A$, and the perimeter transforms as $P \\to \\lambda P$. The dimensionless group $A/P^2$ transforms as:\n$$\n\\frac{A}{P^2} \\to \\frac{\\lambda^2 A}{(\\lambda P)^2} = \\frac{\\lambda^2 A}{\\lambda^2 P^2} = \\frac{A}{P^2}\n$$\nThe group $A/P^2$ is inherently scale-invariant. Therefore, any function $g(A/P^2)$ will also be scale-invariant. The problem implies a simple relationship, so we assume the most fundamental form, which is a direct proportionality:\n$$\nQ_2 = c \\frac{A}{P^2}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\nThe third constraint is normalization. The index $Q_2$ is maximized for a circle, and its value for a circle is $1$. The isoperimetric inequality in two dimensions states that for any closed curve of perimeter $P$ enclosing an area $A$, the following holds:\n$$\nP^2 \\ge 4\\pi A\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{A}{P^2} \\le \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\n$$\nEquality holds if and only if the shape is a circle. This proves that the quantity $A/P^2$ is uniquely maximized by a circle. Our proposed form $Q_2 = c \\cdot A/P^2$ (assuming $c>0$) will therefore also be maximized for a circle. To fix the constant $c$, we set $Q_2=1$ for a circle:\n$$\nQ_{2, \\text{circle}} = c \\left( \\frac{A_{circle}}{P_{circle}^2} \\right) = c \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $c$ yields $c=4\\pi$. Thus, the functional form for the compactness index is:\n$$\nQ_2 = \\frac{4\\pi A}{P^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute this index for a rectangle of width $w$ and height $h$.\nThe area of the rectangle is $A = wh$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is $P = 2(w+h)$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for $Q_2$:\n$$\nQ_2(w,h) = \\frac{4\\pi (wh)}{(2(w+h))^2} = \\frac{4\\pi wh}{4(w+h)^2} = \\frac{\\pi wh}{(w+h)^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the compactness of a rectangle.\n\nFinally, we analyze its behavior for extreme aspect ratios. Let the aspect ratio be $r = w/h$. We can express $Q_2$ in terms of $r$ by substituting $w=rh$:\n$$\nQ_2(r) = \\frac{\\pi (rh)h}{(rh+h)^2} = \\frac{\\pi r h^2}{h^2(r+1)^2} = \\frac{\\pi r}{(r+1)^2}\n$$\nThis expression shows that $Q_2$ for a rectangle depends only on its aspect ratio.\nNow, consider the limit as $r \\to \\infty$. This corresponds to a rectangle that is infinitely wide compared to its height ($w \\gg h$).\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} Q_2(r) = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\pi r}{(r+1)^2} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\pi r}{r^2+2r+1} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{r}}{1+\\frac{2}{r}+\\frac{1}{r^2}} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nNext, consider the limit as $r \\to 0$. This corresponds to a rectangle that is infinitely tall compared to its width ($h \\gg w$).\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0} Q_2(r) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{\\pi r}{(r+1)^2} = \\frac{\\pi(0)}{(0+1)^2} = 0\n$$\nIn both extreme cases, where the rectangle becomes infinitely elongated, the compactness index $Q_2$ approaches $0$. This is physically and geometrically intuitive, as these elongated shapes represent maximal deviation from the perfectly compact circular shape, for which $Q_2=1$. The maximum compactness for a rectangle occurs for a square ($r=1$), where $Q_2 = \\pi(1)/(1+1)^2 = \\pi/4 \\approx 0.785 < 1$.\n\nThe final result required is the single closed-form analytic expression for $Q_2(w,h)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi wh}{(w+h)^2}}$$", "id": "4527867"}, {"introduction": "The principles used to define 2D shape features are directly applicable to the three-dimensional world of volumetric imaging.

The concepts of surface area, volume, and dimensionless shape metrics are standard in many STEM fields, including radiomics. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to proceed, with one point of ambiguity requiring careful interpretation. The statement claims a \"unique\" monomial form can be derived. Dimensional analysis alone provides one constraint on two exponents, leading to a family of solutions. However, the search for the simplest mathematical form that satisfies the physical constraints is a standard methodological principle in physics and engineering. The uniqueness can be established by seeking the lowest integer powers for the exponents that satisfy the dimensional constraint. This interpretation is not only plausible but also conceptually meaningful, as it relates to how quantities with different physical dimensions ($V \\propto L^3$, $A \\propto L^2$) are combined. The problem is therefore deemed valid under this reasonable interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Metric\nThe metric is given in the monomial form $Q_{3}(A,V) = c\\,V^{\\alpha}A^{\\beta}$.\nThe physical dimensions of volume $V$ and surface area $A$ are $[V] = L^3$ and $[A] = L^2$, where $L$ is the dimension of length. The constant $c$ and the metric $Q_{3}$ are dimensionless, so their dimension is $L^0$, or $1$.\n\nThe dimensional equation for the metric is:\n$$[Q_{3}] = [c][V]^{\\alpha}[A]^{\\beta}$$\n$$L^0 = (1) (L^3)^{\\alpha} (L^2)^{\\beta} = L^{3\\alpha} L^{2\\beta} = L^{3\\alpha + 2\\beta}$$\nFor this equation to hold, the exponent of $L$ must be zero:\n$$3\\alpha + 2\\beta = 0$$\nThis equation relates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. To find a unique solution, we must apply an additional constraint. The problem's assertion of uniqueness, combined with the principle of constructing the simplest form, directs us to find the lowest non-trivial integer solution for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The general integer solution is $\\alpha = 2k$ and $\\beta = -3k$ for any integer $k \\neq 0$. The simplest non-trivial choice is $k=1$, which yields:\n$$\\alpha = 2, \\quad \\beta = -3$$\nThis choice is conceptually robust because it combines $V^2$ (which scales as $(L^3)^2 = L^6$) and $A^3$ (which scales as $(L^2)^3 = L^6$) to form a ratio that is manifestly independent of the object's scale.\n\nWith these exponents, the metric has the form:\n$$Q_{3}(A,V) = c\\,V^2 A^{-3} = c \\frac{V^2}{A^3}$$\nThe constant $c$ is determined by the normalization condition that $Q_{3} = 1$ for a perfect sphere. For a sphere of radius $R$, the volume $V_s$ and surface area $A_s$ are:\n$$V_s = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$\n$$A_s = 4\\pi R^2$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Q_{3}$:\n$$Q_{3, \\text{sphere}} = c \\frac{V_s^2}{A_s^3} = c \\frac{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right)^2}{(4\\pi R^2)^3} = c \\frac{\\frac{16}{9}\\pi^2 R^6}{64\\pi^3 R^6}$$\nThe terms involving $R$ cancel, as expected for a shape feature.\n$$Q_{3, \\text{sphere}} = c \\frac{16\\pi^2}{9 \\cdot 64\\pi^3} = c \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 4\\pi} = c \\frac{1}{36\\pi}$$\nSetting $Q_{3, \\text{sphere}} = 1$ gives the value of $c$:\n$$c \\frac{1}{36\\pi} = 1 \\implies c = 36\\pi$$\nTherefore, the unique monomial form of the metric, under the interpretation of simplest integer exponents, is:\n$$Q_3(A,V) = 36\\pi \\frac{V^2}{A^3}$$\nBy the isoperimetric inequality, a sphere has the minimum surface area for a given volume. This implies that for any object, the ratio $V^2/A^3$ is maximized for a sphere. Thus, $Q_3 \\le 1$ for any shape, with equality holding only for a sphere.\n\n### Calculation for a Cube\nNext, we compute the value of $Q_{3}$ for a cube of side length $a$.\nThe volume of the cube is $V_c = a^3$.\nThe surface area of the cube is $A_c = 6a^2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived metric:\n$$Q_{3, \\text{cube}} = 36\\pi \\frac{(a^3)^2}{(6a^2)^3} = 36\\pi \\frac{a^6}{6^3 (a^2)^3} = 36\\pi \\frac{a^6}{216 a^6}$$\nThe terms involving $a$ cancel out.\n$$Q_{3, \\text{cube}} = \\frac{36\\pi}{216}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{36}{216} = \\frac{36}{6 \\times 36} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nThus, the value of the metric for a cube is:\n$$Q_{3, \\text{cube}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$$\n\n### Interpretation\nThe value $Q_{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx \\frac{3.14159}{6} \\approx 0.5236$ for a cube is significantly less than the value of $1$ for a sphere. This deviation quantifies the degree to which a cube is less \"compact\" or \"sphere-like\" than a sphere. The metric is founded on the ratio $V^2/A^3$. Since $V \\propto L^3$ and $A \\propto L^2$, the exponents $\\alpha=2$ and $\\beta=-3$ are the lowest integers that make the metric scale-invariant ($L^{(3)(2) + (2)(-3)} = L^0$). This choice of high-power exponents makes the metric highly sensitive to deviations from sphericity. Specifically, the $A^3$ term in the denominator heavily penalizes shapes that have a large surface area for a given volume. A cube, with its sharp edges and flat faces, has a substantially larger surface area relative to its volume compared to a sphere, resulting in a low $Q_3$ value. A different choice of exponents (e.g., $\\alpha=2/3$, $\\beta=-1$ for the standard \"sphericity\" metric) would result in a value closer to $1$, indicating lower sensitivity to shape differences. The chosen form $Q_3 \\propto V^2 A^{-3}$ thus represents a stringent measure of sphericity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$$", "id": "4527869"}, {"introduction": "The shape features we have derived so far exist in an idealized world of continuous mathematics.

For a uniform distribution, the coordinate means are $\\mu_x = \\mu_y = \\mu_z = 0$.\n\nThe variance of a continuous uniform distribution on an interval of length $D$ is $D^2/12$.\n- Variance along $x$: $\\sigma_x^2 = L^2/12$\n- Variance along $y$: $\\sigma_y^2 = W^2/12$\n- Variance along $z$: $\\sigma_z^2 = T^2/12$\n\nSince the cuboid is aligned with the coordinate axes, the covariance terms are zero (e.g., $\\text{Cov}(x, y) = 0$). The coordinate covariance matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is diagonal:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} L^2/12 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & W^2/12 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & T^2/12 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}$ are its diagonal entries. By convention, we order them $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3$. Given $L=100$, $W=80$, and $T=0.2$, we have $L > W \\gg T$. Therefore:\n- Major axis eigenvalue: $\\lambda_1 = L^2/12$\n- Intermediate axis eigenvalue: $\\lambda_2 = W^2/12$\n- Minor axis eigenvalue: $\\lambda_3 = T^2/12$\n\nThe feature $Q_3$ is the smallest eigenvalue, so $Q_3 = \\lambda_3 = T^2/12$.\nIn the limit $T \\to 0$, $Q_3 \\to 0$.\nFor the given ROI:\n$$ Q_3 = \\frac{(0.2\\ \\mathrm{mm})^2}{12} = \\frac{0.04\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2}{12} = \\frac{1}{300}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 \\approx 0.00333\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nElongation is defined as the ratio of spread along the intermediate versus the major axis.

For the given ROI:\n$$ \\text{Elongation} = \\frac{80\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{100\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 0.8 $$\n\n**Part 2: Analysis on the Discrete Voxel Grid**\n\nThe voxel spacing is $\\Delta = 1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The ROI thickness is $T = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Since $T < \\Delta$, the entire ROI is contained within a single layer of voxels. If the ROI is centered at $z=0$, all segmented voxel centers will have a z-coordinate of $z=0$.\n\nWhen calculating the variance from the set of voxel center coordinates, the variance in the z-direction would be exactly zero if calculated naively from the point set $\\{ (x_i, y_j, 0) \\}$. However, in digital image processing, a key principle is that a measurement is limited by the resolution of the instrument. When a feature is smaller than the sampling interval, its measured properties reflect the sampling interval itself. The quantization of a continuous variable introduces an error, and the variance of this quantization error for a uniform quantizer is $\\Delta^2/12$. This acts as an effective noise floor on the variance measurement.\n\nTherefore, for any dimension where the object's true extent is much smaller than the voxel size $\\Delta$, the measured variance of the coordinates will not be its true small value, but will instead be dominated by the quantization variance. The measured smallest eigenvalue, $Q_{3, \\text{measured}}$, will be approximately:\n$$ Q_{3, \\text{measured}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12} $$\nFor $\\Delta = 1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ Q_{3, \\text{measured}} \\approx \\frac{(1\\ \\mathrm{mm})^2}{12} \\approx 0.0833\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nThis demonstrates a saturation effect: even though the true continuum value of $Q_3$ is $\\approx 0.0033\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$, the discrete measurement yields a much larger value of $\\approx 0.0833\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$. The measurement cannot resolve the true thickness and is limited by the voxel size.\n\nFor elongation, the relevant eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ depend on $L$ and $W$. Since $L, W \\gg \\Delta$, the discretization has a very small effect. The discrete variance formula is $\\sigma^2 = (N^2-1)d^2/12$, where $N$ is the number of points and $d$ is their spacing. For the x-direction, $N_x \\approx L/\\Delta$ and $d=\\Delta$, so $\\sigma_x^2 \\approx \\frac{((L/\\Delta)^2-1)\\Delta^2}{12} = \\frac{L^2 - \\Delta^2}{12}$.\n$$ \\text{Elongation}_{\\text{measured}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{W^2 - \\Delta^2}{L^2 - \\Delta^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{80^2 - 1^2}{100^2 - 1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6399}{9999}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.6400} \\approx 0.8 $$\nThe measured elongation is virtually identical to the continuum value, so it remains stable.\n\n**Part 3: Limiting Factors**\n\nThe discrepancy in $Q_3$ is the difference between the true value ($\\approx 0.0033$) and the measured value ($\\approx 0.0833$). This error is entirely due to voxel discretization. Double-precision floating point has a machine epsilon of $\\approx 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}$. Numerical errors in matrix eigenvalue computation are typically proportional to machine epsilon times the largest eigenvalue magnitude. Here, $\\lambda_1 \\approx L^2/12 \\approx 833$.

Neither $Q_3 = T^2/12$ nor Elongation $= W/L$ involve division by $T$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Elongation primarily reflects sensitivity to $T$, so thinning the sheet (decreasing $T$) reduces elongation markedly, whereas $Q_3$ remains approximately constant because contributions along the thin axis are annihilated numerically by floating-point cancellation.**\n- `Elongation primarily reflects sensitivity to T`: False. Elongation is independent of $T$.\n- `$Q_3$ remains approximately constant`: In the continuum limit, this is false as $Q_3 \\propto T^2$. It becomes constant on a discrete grid once $T \\ll \\Delta$ due to saturation, but the reason given is wrong.\n- `annihilated numerically by floating-point cancellation`: False. The theoretical variance on a perfectly aligned grid is exactly zero, not due to floating-point cancellation. More importantly, the practical measured value is not zero but a floor value of $\\Delta^2/12$ due to the quantization effect, which is the opposite of annihilation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4527882"}]}
