A more robust interpretation is that kurtosis measures the propensity of a distribution to produce outliers (i.e., its \"tailedness\").\n\nIn this specific data set $\\{0, 0, 1, 1, 10\\}$, the value $10$ is an outlier relative to the other data points clustered around $0$ and $1$. The calculation of the fourth central moment, $m_4$, involves raising the deviations from the mean to the fourth power. The contribution of the outlier is $(10 - 2.4)^4 = (7.6)^4 = 3336.2176$, which dominates the sum, while the contributions from the other points are comparatively negligible (e.g., $(0 - 2.4)^4 = 33.1776$). This extreme sensitivity to distant points is the defining characteristic of the fourth moment. Therefore, the single extreme intensity at $10$ is the primary driver of the positive excess kurtosis, and it contributes to the statistic by creating a heavy tail in the distribution, not by creating a \"peak\" in the center.
