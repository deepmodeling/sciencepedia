The tasks are to identify all zones, populate the GLSZM, and compute the Small Zone Emphasis (SZE) feature. The analysis will proceed step-by-step from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe ROI is given by the gray-level matrix $G$:\n$$\nG = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe set of gray levels is $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. A zone is a maximally connected set of pixels with an identical gray level, where connectivity is defined by the $4$-connectivity rule (pixels are connected if they are adjacent cardinally). The size of a zone, $j$, is the number of pixels it contains.\n\n### Step 1: Enumeration of Zones\n\nWe will identify all zones by performing a connected-component analysis on the matrix $G$.\n\n**Zones for Gray Level $i=1$:**\nBy systematically scanning the matrix for pixels with gray level $1$, we identify the distinct connected components.\n1.  A large, interconnected zone is found. Let us trace its members using coordinates $(row, col)$:\n    The pixel at $(1,1)$ is connected to $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.\n    The pixel at $(2,1)$ is connected to $(3,1)$.\n    The pixel at $(3,1)$ is connected to $(3,2)$, which connects to $(3,3)$.\n    The pixel at $(3,3)$ is connected to $(3,4)$ and $(4,3)$.\n    The pixel at $(3,4)$ is connected to $(2,4)$.\n    The pixel at $(4,3)$ is connected to $(5,3)$.\n    The pixel at $(5,3)$ is connected to $(5,2)$.\n    All of these pixels with gray level $1$ form a single, maximally connected set. The pixels in this zone are:\n    $\\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)\\}$.\n    Counting these pixels gives the size of the zone. The size is $j=11$.\n    Thus, we have one zone with gray level $i=1$ and size $j=11$.\n\n2.  We inspect the matrix for any remaining pixels with gray level $1$. The pixel at $(5,5)$ has a value of $1$. Its neighbors under $4$-connectivity are at $(4,5)$ (gray level $2$) and $(5,4)$ (gray level $2$). Since none of its neighbors share its gray level, this pixel forms a zone by itself.\n    The size of this zone is $j=1$.\n    Thus, we have one zone with gray level $i=1$ and size $j=1$.\n\nIn summary, for gray level $i=1$, there are two zones: one of size $11$ and one of size $1$.\n\n**Zones for Gray Level $i=2$:**\nWe repeat the process for pixels with gray level $2$.\n1.  Let's trace the component starting at $(1,3)$:\n    The pixels at $(1,3)$, $(1,4)$, and $(1,5)$ are connected.\n    $(1,3)$ connects to $(2,3)$, which connects to $(2,2)$.\n    $(1,5)$ connects to $(2,5)$, which connects to $(3,5)$.\n    $(3,5)$ connects to $(4,5)$, which connects to $(4,4)$.\n    $(4,4)$ connects to $(5,4)$.\n    A careful check confirms that all these pixels form a single, maximally connected component. The pixels in this zone are:\n    $\\{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)\\}$.\n    The size of this zone is the number of pixels, which is $j=10$.\n    Thus, we have one zone with gray level $i=2$ and size $j=10$.\n\n2.  The remaining pixels with gray level $2$ are at $(4,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(5,1)$.\n    The pixel at $(4,1)$ is connected to $(4,2)$ and $(5,1)$. The pixel at $(4,2)$ is connected to $(4,1)$. The pixel at $(5,1)$ is connected to $(4,1)$. These three pixels form a distinct connected component.\n    The size of this zone is $j=3$.\n    Thus, we have one zone with gray level $i=2$ and size $j=3$.\n\nIn summary, for gray level $i=2$, there are two zones: one of size $10$ and one of size $3$.\n\nThe complete enumeration of zones is as follows:\n-   Zone 1: Gray Level $1$, Size $11$.\n-   Zone 2: Gray Level $1$, Size $1$.\n-   Zone 3: Gray Level $2$, Size $10$.\n-   Zone 4: Gray Level $2$, Size $3$.\n\n### Step 2: Population of the GLSZM\n\nThe Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix, denoted by $P(i, j)$, stores the number of zones with gray level $i$ and size $j$. Based on our enumeration, we populate the matrix. The number of gray levels is $N_g=2$, and the distinct zone sizes found are $\\{1, 3, 10, 11\\}$.\n\nThe non-zero entries of the GLSZM are:\n-   $P(1, 1) = 1$ (one zone of gray level $1$ and size $1$).\n-   $P(1, 11) = 1$ (one zone of gray level $1$ and size $11$).\n-   $P(2, 3) = 1$ (one zone of gray level $2$ and size $3$).\n-   $P(2, 10) = 1$ (one zone of gray level $2$ and size $10$).\n\nAll other entries $P(i,j)$ are $0$. The total number of zones, $N_z$, is the sum of all entries in the matrix:\n$$\nN_z = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} P(i, j) = P(1,1) + P(1,11) + P(2,3) + P(2,10) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n$$\nwhere $N_s$ is the maximum zone size.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Computation of Small Zone Emphasis (SZE)\n\nThe Small Zone Emphasis (SZE) feature is designed to give greater weight to smaller zones. Following this principle, we can construct the feature by assigning a score to each zone that is inversely related to its size, $j$. A standard and effective choice for this weighting is $1/j^2$, which strongly emphasizes smaller zones. The SZE is then the average of these scores over all zones found in the ROI.\n\nThe total weighted sum for all zones is $\\sum_{i,j} P(i,j) \\cdot (1/j^2)$. To obtain the average score, we normalize this sum by the total number of zones, $N_z$. This \"first principles\" derivation leads to the formal definition of SZE:\n$$\n\\text{SZE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} \\frac{P(i, j)}{j^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} P(i, j)}\n$$\n\nUsing our populated GLSZM and $N_z=4$, we can compute the SZE for this ROI. The numerator is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} \\frac{P(i,j)}{j^2} = \\frac{P(1,1)}{1^2} + \\frac{P(1,11)}{11^2} + \\frac{P(2,3)}{3^2} + \\frac{P(2,10)}{10^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the non-zero values:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} \\frac{P(i,j)}{j^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{11^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{10^2} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{121} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{100}\n$$\nTo calculate this sum precisely:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{121} = 1 + 0.1111\\ldots + 0.01 + 0.00826446\\ldots \\approx 1.12937557\n$$\nThe exact fractional value is:\n$$\n\\frac{108900}{108900} + \\frac{12100}{108900} + \\frac{1089}{108900} + \\frac{900}{108900} = \\frac{108900 + 12100 + 1089 + 900}{108900} = \\frac{122989}{108900}\n$$\nNow, we compute SZE:\n$$\n\\text{SZE} = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{N_z} = \\frac{122989/108900}{4} = \\frac{122989}{435600}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\text{SZE} \\approx 0.2823427456 \\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.2823$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2823}$$", "id": "4564811"}, {"introduction": "Once a GLSZM is constructed, its true power lies in the quantitative features that can be derived from it.

Let the index for this single gray level be $i=1$, so the number of gray levels $N_g=1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the structure of the zones in this ROI. A zone is defined as a maximally connected set of pixels sharing the same gray level. Since all $N_p$ pixels in the ROI have the same gray level ($i=1$), they all belong to a single, connected set. The term \"region of interest\" implies a contiguous area, so we assume the $N_p$ pixels form a single connected component. Therefore, there is exactly one zone in the entire ROI. The size of this zone is the total number of pixels, which is $j=N_p$.\n\nNext, we construct the GLSZM, denoted by $P(i,j)$. This matrix stores the count of zones with gray level $i$ and size $j$.\n- The number of gray levels is $N_g=1$.\n- The maximum possible zone size is $N_p$.\nIn our case, we have identified a single zone with gray level $i=1$ and size $j=N_p$. Thus, the count of such zones is $1$. This gives the matrix entry:\n$$P(1, N_p) = 1$$\nSince this is the only zone, all other entries in the GLSZM must be zero. That is, $P(1,j) = 0$ for all $j \\neq N_p$, and $P(i,j)=0$ for all $i \\neq 1$.\n\nFrom the GLSZM, we can calculate the total number of zones, $N_z$.\n$$N_z = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} P(i,j)$$\nGiven $N_g=1$ and only one non-zero entry in the matrix, the sum reduces to:\n$$N_z = P(1, N_p) = 1$$\nThis confirms our deduction that there is only one zone.\n\nNow, we compute the normalized GLSZM, $p(i,j) = \\frac{P(i,j)}{N_z}$, and the size-marginal distribution, $p_{.j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_g} p(i,j)$.\nWith $N_z=1$, the normalized matrix is identical to the original matrix:\n$$p(i,j) = P(i,j)$$\nSo, $p(1, N_p) = 1$ and all other entries are $0$.\nThe size-marginal distribution $p_{.j}$ is found by summing over the gray-level index $i$. Since $N_g=1$, this is trivial:\n$$p_{.j} = p(1,j)$$\nThis implies that $p_{.j}$ is non-zero only for $j=N_p$:\n$$p_{.N_p} = 1$$\nAnd for all $j \\neq N_p$, we have $p_{.j} = 0$. This distribution is a Kronecker delta function centered at $j=N_p$.\n\nWith the size-marginal distribution, we can now derive the closed-form expressions for the required features.\n\n1.  **Small Zone Emphasis (SZE)**\n    The definition is $\\mathrm{SZE} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} \\frac{p_{.j}}{j^{2}}$.

The resulting value $\\mathrm{SZE} = \\frac{1}{N_p^2}$ is a very small number, which decreases quadratically as the ROI size $N_p$ increases. This correctly reflects the absolute absence of small zones.\n-   **LZE**: This feature is designed to have high values for images with large zones. A uniform image is the quintessential example of an image dominated by a large zone. The resulting value $\\mathrm{LZE} = N_p^2$ is large and grows quadratically with the ROI size, correctly capturing the presence of a single, zone of maximal size.\n-   **ZP**: This feature measures the density of zones, or $N_z/N_p$.
