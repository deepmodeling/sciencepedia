A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe line integral $p$ is a function of the random variable $I$, given by:\n$$p(I) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_{0}}\\right) = \\ln(I_{0}) - \\ln(I)$$\nWe aim to find an approximation for the variance of $p$, $\\mathrm{Var}(p)$. We use a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $p(I)$ around the mean of $I$, which is $E[I] = \\lambda$. The general form of such an expansion is:\n$$p(I) \\approx p(\\lambda) + p'(\\lambda)(I - \\lambda)$$\nwhere $p'(\\lambda)$ is the first derivative of $p(I)$ with respect to $I$, evaluated at $I=\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $p(I)$:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dI} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left[ \\ln(I_{0}) - \\ln(I) \\right] = 0 - \\frac{1}{I} = -\\frac{1}{I}$$\nEvaluating this derivative at the mean $I = \\lambda$ gives:\n$$p'(\\lambda) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting this into the Taylor expansion, we get:\n$$p(I) \\approx p(\\lambda) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(I - \\lambda)$$\nNow, we find the variance of this approximate expression for $p(I)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}\\left( p(\\lambda) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(I - \\lambda) \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of the variance operator, specifically $\\mathrm{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants, we can simplify this expression. In our case, $X=I$, the constant additive term is $p(\\lambda) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(-\\lambda) = p(\\lambda) + 1$, and the constant multiplicative factor is $a = -1/\\lambda$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}\\left( -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}I + p(\\lambda) + 1 \\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(I)$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\mathrm{Var}(I)$$\nThe problem states that $I$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\lambda$. A core property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(I) = \\lambda$$\nSubstituting this property into our expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(p)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} (\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nThis is the desired approximation for the variance of the line integral $p$.\n\n**Assumptions Made**:\nThe primary assumption is that the first-order Taylor expansion provides a good approximation of the function $p(I)$ in the neighborhood of its mean $\\lambda$. This is valid when the standard deviation of $I$, $\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(I)} = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$, is much smaller than the mean $\\lambda$. The relative fluctuation is $\\sigma_I / \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\lambda = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda}$. For \"large mean counts\", $\\lambda \\gg 1$, this ratio is small, ensuring the fluctuations are within a region where the function is approximately linear. This justifies the approximation.\n\n**Influence of $I_{0}$**:\nThe derived expression for the variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx 1/\\lambda$, is independent of the incident photon count $I_{0}$. This can be understood from the initial definition $p = \\ln(I_{0}) - \\ln(I)$. The term $I_{0}$ is a non-random constant. Since the variance operator has the property $\\mathrm{Var}(X+c) = \\mathrm{Var}(X)$ for any random variable $X$ and constant $c$, the term $\\ln(I_{0})$ acts as an additive constant that shifts the mean of $p$ but has no effect on its variance.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(I_{0}) - \\ln(I)) = \\mathrm{Var}(-\\ln(I)) = (-1)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(I)) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(I))$$\nThe calculation confirms this, showing that the $I_{0}$ term analytically disappears during the derivation of the variance.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are asked to evaluate the derived expression for the variance using the given values:\n-   $\\lambda = 4.0 \\times 10^{4}$ counts\n-   $I_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$ counts (This value is not needed for the variance calculation, as established above.)\n\nUsing the derived formula $\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx 1/\\lambda$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx \\frac{1}{4.0 \\times 10^{4}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx 0.25 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThe projection data $p$ is dimensionless, as it is the logarithm of a ratio of counts. Consequently, its variance is also a dimensionless quantity. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(p) \\approx 2.500 \\times 10^{-5}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.500 \\times 10^{-5}} $$", "id": "4532982"}, {"introduction": "Unlike random noise, many artifacts are systematic, arising from the physical principles of image formation.

No violations of scientific principles, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of frequency encoding in MRI is that a linear magnetic field gradient, $G_x$, is applied along a spatial direction, conventionally denoted as $x$. This gradient causes the local magnetic field to vary with position: $B(x) = B_0 + G_x x$. Consequently, the Larmor frequency of proton spins also becomes position-dependent:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_0 + G_x x) = f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x$$\nwhere $f_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0$ is the Larmor frequency at the isocenter (where $x=0$).\n\nThe MRI system reconstructs an image by assuming that any deviation of a signal's frequency from $f_0$ is solely due to its spatial position. However, the chemical environment of protons also affects their resonance frequency. The chemical shift between water and fat, $\\Delta\\sigma$, causes fat protons to resonate at a slightly lower frequency than water protons at the same magnetic field strength. This frequency difference is given by $\\Delta f = \\Delta\\sigma \\times f_0$.\n\nTherefore, for a fat molecule located at the same physical position $x$ as a water molecule, its resonance frequency will be:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{fat}}(x) = f(x) - \\Delta f = \\left(f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x\\right) - \\Delta f$$\nThe MRI system receives the signal from the fat molecule at frequency $f_{\\mathrm{fat}}(x)$ but interprets its position based on the frequency encoding scheme. It assigns an apparent position, $x_{\\mathrm{app}}$, such that:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x_{\\mathrm{app}} = f_{\\mathrm{fat}}(x) - f_0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{fat}}(x)$:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\left(f_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x - \\Delta f\\right) - f_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x - \\Delta f$$\nSolving for the apparent position $x_{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{app}} = x - \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x}$$\nThe spatial displacement, $\\Delta x$, is the difference between the true position and the apparent position:\n$$\\Delta x = |x - x_{\\mathrm{app}}| = \\left| - \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x} \\right| = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x}$$\nThe problem defines the bandwidth per pixel, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}$, as the frequency interval corresponding to a single pixel. If a pixel has a width of $w_{\\mathrm{pix}}$, then $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}$ is the change in frequency across this width due to the gradient:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}} = \\left| \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x w_{\\mathrm{pix}} \\right|$$\nAssuming $G_x > 0$, we have $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x = \\frac{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}}{w_{\\mathrm{pix}}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta x$:\n$$\\Delta x = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}}{w_{\\mathrm{pix}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}} w_{\\mathrm{pix}}$$\nThe displacement in units of pixels, let's call it $N_{\\mathrm{pix}}$, is the spatial displacement $\\Delta x$ divided by the pixel width $w_{\\mathrm{pix}}$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{pix}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{w_{\\mathrm{pix}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}} w_{\\mathrm{pix}}}{w_{\\mathrm{pix}}} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}}$$\nThis derived relation explicitly shows that the chemical shift displacement in pixels, $N_{\\mathrm{pix}}$, is inversely proportional to the bandwidth per pixel, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}$. Thus, increasing $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}$ reduces the displacement artifact.\n\nThe problem requires this displacement to be strictly less than half a pixel:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{pix}}  0.5$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}}  0.5$$\nRearranging for $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}}$ yields the condition:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix}} > 2 \\Delta f$$\nThe minimum required bandwidth per pixel is therefore the value at the boundary of this condition, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{pix, min}} = 2 \\Delta f$.

All necessary parameters and definitions for solving the problem are provided. The scenario described is a standard model for analyzing the effects of finite k-space sampling and zero-filling in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), based on the fundamental principles of Fourier analysis. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1.  Derivation of the point spread function (PSF) and ringing period:\n\nThe finite acquisition in k-space from $k \\in [-k_{\\max}, k_{\\max}]$ is equivalent to multiplying the ideal, complete k-space data by a rectangular window function, $W(k) = \\text{rect}(k / (2k_{\\max}))$, which is equal to $1$ for $|k| \\le k_{\\max}$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nAccording to the convolution theorem, the reconstructed image in the spatial domain, $f_{\\text{recon}}(x)$, is the convolution of the true image, $f(x)$, with the inverse Fourier transform of the window function $W(k)$. This inverse transform is the system's point spread function, $\\text{PSF}(x)$.\n\nThe Fourier transform pair is defined as $F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,\\exp(-i 2 \\pi k x)\\,dx$ and its inverse is $f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(k)\\,\\exp(i 2 \\pi k x)\\,dk$. We calculate the $\\text{PSF}(x)$ by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangular window:\n$$ \\text{PSF}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} W(k) \\exp(i 2 \\pi k x) dk = \\int_{-k_{\\max}}^{k_{\\max}} 1 \\cdot \\exp(i 2 \\pi k x) dk $$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$ \\text{PSF}(x) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(i 2 \\pi k x)}{i 2 \\pi x} \\right]_{-k_{\\max}}^{k_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\exp(i 2 \\pi k_{\\max} x) - \\exp(-i 2 \\pi k_{\\max} x)}{i 2 \\pi x} $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\sin(\\theta) = (\\exp(i\\theta) - \\exp(-i\\theta)) / (2i)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$ \\text{PSF}(x) = \\frac{2i \\sin(2 \\pi k_{\\max} x)}{i 2 \\pi x} = \\frac{\\sin(2 \\pi k_{\\max} x)}{\\pi x} $$\nThis function is a scaled sinc function, $\\text{PSF}(x) = 2k_{\\max} \\text{sinc}(2k_{\\max}x)$, where $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\sin(\\pi u)/(\\pi u)$.\n\nThe zeros of the $\\text{PSF}(x)$ occur when the numerator, $\\sin(2 \\pi k_{\\max} x)$, is zero, and the denominator is non-zero. This happens when the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$:\n$$ 2 \\pi k_{\\max} x = m \\pi, \\quad \\text{for } m \\in \\mathbb{Z}, m \\neq 0 $$\nThe locations of the zeros are thus $x_m = \\frac{m}{2k_{\\max}}$.\n\nThe physical oscillation period of the Gibbs ringing, $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}$, is the distance between consecutive zeros. For example, the distance between the zeros at $m=1$ and $m=2$ is:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} = x_2 - x_1 = \\frac{2}{2k_{\\max}} - \\frac{1}{2k_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{2k_{\\max}} $$\nThis is the characteristic physical wavelength of the ringing artifact.\n\n2.  Computation of the apparent discrete ringing frequencies:\n\nFirst, we establish a relationship between $k_{\\max}$ and the given sampling parameters. The problem states that $N$ samples are acquired with interval $\\Delta k$ to cover the range $[-k_{\\max}, k_{\\max}]$. The total width of the acquired k-space is $2k_{\\max}$. This must correspond to the span of the $N$ samples, which is $N \\Delta k$. Therefore, we have the relation $2k_{\\max} = N \\Delta k$.\nUsing the given relation $\\Delta k = 1/L$, we can write:\n$$ 2k_{\\max} = N \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{N}{L} $$\nNow, we can express the physical ringing period in terms of $N$ and $L$:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} = \\frac{1}{2k_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{N/L} = \\frac{L}{N} $$\nThis is a critical intermediate result: the physical period of the Gibbs ringing is equal to the pixel size of the original, non-zero-filled image.\n\nThe problem defines the apparent discrete ringing frequency as $f_{\\text{pix}} = \\Delta x / \\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}$, where $\\Delta x$ is the pixel spacing.\n\nCase A: Before zero-filling.\nThe pixel spacing is given as $\\Delta x_{\\text{before}} = \\Delta x = L/N$.\nThe physical ringing period $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}$ is $L/N$.\nThe apparent frequency before zero-filling is:\n$$ f_{\\text{pix, before}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\text{before}}}{\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}} = \\frac{L/N}{L/N} = 1 $$\nThis is in units of cycles per pixel.\n\nCase B: After zero-filling by a factor of 2.\nThe key information is that zero-filling does not change the acquired k-space extent, so $k_{\\max}$ is unchanged. Consequently, the physical PSF and its characteristic ringing period, $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}$, remain the same: $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} = L/N$.\nHowever, the image is now reconstructed onto a finer grid. The new number of pixels is $2N$ over the same field of view $L$. The new pixel spacing is given as $\\Delta x_{\\text{after}} = \\Delta x' = L/(2N)$.\nThe apparent frequency after zero-filling is:\n$$ f_{\\text{pix, after}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\text{after}}}{\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}}} = \\frac{L/(2N)}{L/N} = \\frac{L}{2N} \\cdot \\frac{N}{L} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis is in units of cycles per pixel.\n\n3.  Computation of the ratio $r$:\nThe ratio is defined as $r = f_{\\text{pix, after}} / f_{\\text{pix, before}}$.\n$$ r = \\frac{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nExplanation of the phenomenon and its radiomics implication:\n\nZero-filling changes the apparent ringing frequency in pixel coordinates but not the true resolution. The true spatial resolution is fundamentally determined by the maximum spatial frequency acquired, $k_{\\max}$. This value defines the width of the main lobe of the point spread function (PSF), which dictates the smallest resolvable feature size, approximately $\\Delta x_{\\text{res}} \\propto 1/k_{\\max}$. The characteristic physical period of the Gibbs ringing artifact, $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} = 1/(2k_{\\max})$, is also fixed by the acquisition physics. Since zero-filling is a post-processing step that adds no new high-frequency information (it only adds zeros to the k-space data), it cannot improve the true resolution or alter the physical structure of the PSF.\n\nWhat zero-filling does is interpolate the image data. By padding the k-space array from $N$ to $2N$ points, the inverse Fourier transform produces an image with $2N$ pixels in the same field of view $L$. This halves the pixel spacing from $\\Delta x = L/N$ to $\\Delta x' = L/(2N)$. The fixed physical pattern of the Gibbs ringing is now sampled by smaller pixels. As a result, the oscillation, which has a wavelength of $\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} = L/N$, now spans two of the new pixels ($\\Delta x_{\\text{zero}} / \\Delta x' = (L/N) / (L/(2N)) = 2$). This makes the oscillation appear to have a lower frequency in pixel-based units (from $1$ cycle/pixel to $0.5$ cycles/pixel), effectively making the ringing more visually apparent as a smoother ripple.\n\nOne implication for edge-based radiomics features is a significant loss of reproducibility and robustness. Radiomics features designed to measure texture, such as wavelet-based features or those from Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), are sensitive to the spatial frequency content of the image. The Gibbs ringing artifact introduces a specific oscillatory pattern, particularly at tissue boundaries. As we have shown, zero-filling alters the apparent frequency of this artifact in the discrete pixel grid. A texture feature analyzing the high-frequency content of the original image might interpret the artifact as a fine texture, while in the zero-filled image, it would be measured as a medium-frequency texture. Therefore, radiomics feature values can be strongly dependent on the reconstruction parameter of zero-filling, not on the underlying biology, which compromises the potential for standardizing and comparing radiomics models across different sites or scanners that may use different reconstruction protocols.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "4533031"}]}
