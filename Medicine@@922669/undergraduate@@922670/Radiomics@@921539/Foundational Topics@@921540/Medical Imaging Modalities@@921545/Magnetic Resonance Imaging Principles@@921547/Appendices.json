The equation relates the angular precession frequency, $\\omega_0$, to the magnetic field via the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0 $$\nThe frequency in Hertz, $f_0$, is related to the angular frequency by $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0$.

Expressing this in standard scientific notation gives:\n$$ f_0 = 6.387 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Hz} $$\n\n**Part 2: Accrued Off-Resonance Phase**\n\nPhase, $\\phi$, is the time integral of angular frequency, $\\omega$. For a constant frequency offset, the accrued phase over a time interval $T$ is given by $\\phi = \\omega T$.\nThe problem states a constant off-resonance frequency of $\\Delta f = 100\\,\\text{Hz}$.

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it subject to the initial condition immediately after the $90^\\circ$ pulse at $t=0$. Before the pulse, the magnetization is fully longitudinal: $\\vec{M}(0^-) = (0, 0, M_0)$. The $90^\\circ$ pulse tips this vector entirely into the transverse plane.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe decay of transverse magnetization, $M_{xy}$, is governed by the Bloch equations. For a population of spins, the signal decay is influenced by two primary mechanisms: irreversible spin-spin interactions (characterized by the time constant $T_2$) and reversible dephasing due to static magnetic field inhomogeneities (e.g., from main field imperfections or local magnetic susceptibility variations).\n\nThe total rate of transverse relaxation is the sum of the rates from these two effects. This is expressed in terms of their respective time constants:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = \\frac{1}{T_{2}} + \\frac{1}{T_{2, \\text{inhom}}} $$\nHere, $T_2^*$ is the effective transverse relaxation time, which includes both irreversible and reversible effects, and $T_{2, \\text{inhom}}$ characterizes the component of decay due to static field inhomogeneities alone.\n\nA gradient-echo (GRE) sequence is sensitive to all sources of dephasing. Therefore, the signal intensity, $S_{\\text{GRE}}$, at an echo time $\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}$ decays according to $T_2^*$. Starting with an initial transverse magnetization magnitude proportional to a constant $S_0$ (which depends on proton density, hardware gain, and initial excitation, and is stated to be the same for both acquisitions), the signal is given by:\n$$ S_{\\text{GRE}} = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}}{T_{2}^{*}}\\right) $$\n\nA spin-echo (SE) sequence utilizes a $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulse at a time $\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}/2$. This pulse reverses the phase evolution of the spins. By the time the echo is formed at $\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}$, the dephasing caused by static, time-independent field inhomogeneities has been cancelled out. However, the decay resulting from time-dependent, random spin-spin interactions (the $T_2$ effect) is not refocused. Consequently, the signal decay for an SE sequence is governed solely by the intrinsic $T_2$ of the tissue. The signal intensity, $S_{\\text{SE}}$, at echo time $\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}$ is:\n$$ S_{\\text{SE}} = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}}{T_{2}}\\right) $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = S_{\\text{GRE}}/S_{\\text{SE}}$. Using the derived expressions:\n$$ R = \\frac{S_{\\text{GRE}}}{S_{\\text{SE}}} = \\frac{S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}}{T_{2}^{*}}\\right)}{S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}}{T_{2}}\\right)} $$\nThe initial signal strength $S_0$ cancels out:\n$$ R = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}}{T_{2}^{*}}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}}{T_{2}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}}{T_{2}} - \\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}}{T_{2}^{*}}\\right) $$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n$T_{2} = 60\\,\\text{ms}$\n$T_{2}^{*} = 25\\,\\text{ms}$\n$\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}} = 80\\,\\text{ms}$\n$\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}} = 30\\,\\text{ms}$\n\nThe exponents are dimensionless, as the time units (ms) cancel.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{SE}}}{T_{2}} = \\frac{80}{60} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\text{TE}_{\\text{GRE}}}{T_{2}^{*}} = \\frac{30}{25} = \\frac{6}{5} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{6}{5}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{20 - 18}{15}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right) $$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the exponential:\n$$ R \\approx \\exp(0.133333...) \\approx 1.1428006... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ R \\approx 1.143 $$\n\n### Qualitative Justification\n\nThe problem also asks for a qualitative justification for why GRE acquisitions are more sensitive to magnetic susceptibility variations than SE acquisitions. As established in the derivation, the GRE signal decay is governed by $T_2^*$, while the SE signal decay is governed by $T_2$. The relationship $\\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} = \\frac{1}{T_{2}} + \\frac{1}{T_{2, \\text{inhom}}}$ shows that $T_2^*$ incorporates the effects of static field inhomogeneities ($T_{2, \\text{inhom}}$), whereas $T_2$ does not.\n\nVariations in magnetic susceptibility within or between tissues create microscopic gradients in the local magnetic field. These are static, position-dependent field inhomogeneities. Because the GRE signal is directly attenuated by such static dephasing (the $T_{2, \\text{inhom}}$ component in $T_2^*$), it is highly sensitive to susceptibility effects. In contrast, the $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulse in an SE sequence effectively cancels the dephasing from these static field variations. Therefore, the SE signal is largely immune to susceptibility-induced signal loss. This fundamental difference is why GRE sequences, particularly those with longer echo times, are the basis for techniques like Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI), which are specifically designed to visualize blood products, calcifications, and iron deposits that have distinct magnetic susceptibilities.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.143} $$", "id": "4550037"}]}
