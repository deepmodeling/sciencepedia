I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle stated is that the rate of decrease of intensity, $-dI$, over an infinitesimal path length, $dx$, is proportional to the current intensity, $I(x)$, at that position. The constant of proportionality is the linear attenuation coefficient, $\\mu$. This relationship can be formulated as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-dI = \\mu I(x) dx\n$$\nTo find the intensity $I$ after traversing a total length $L$, we must solve this differential equation. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables $I$ and $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I(x)} = -\\mu dx\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation. The path length $x$ ranges from $0$ to $L$. The corresponding intensity $I(x)$ ranges from the incident intensity $I(0) = I_0$ to the transmitted intensity $I(L) = I$.\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{1}{I'} dI' = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\mu dx'\n$$\nThe material is stated to be homogeneous, which means the linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu$ is constant and can be taken out of the integral on the right side.\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{1}{I'} dI' = -\\mu \\int_{0}^{L} dx'\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals on both sides yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I} = -\\mu [x']_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\mu (L - 0)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\mu L\n$$\nTo find the transmitted intensity $I$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu L)\n$$\n$$\nI = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu L)\n$$\nThis is the Beer-Lambert law for X-ray attenuation. We are given the numerical value $\\mu = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Substituting this value into the expression for $I$ gives the first part of the answer:\n$$\nI = I_0 \\exp(-0.25 L)\n$$\nFor this expression to be dimensionally consistent, if $L$ is measured in $\\mathrm{cm}$, the product $0.25 L$ is dimensionless, making the exponential term a dimensionless scaling factor. Thus, $I$ has the same units as $I_0$, as required.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the logarithmic projection, $p$. The problem provides its definition:\n$$\np = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)\n$$\nFrom our previous derivation, we found that $\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\mu L$. We can directly substitute this result into the definition of $p$:\n$$\np = -(-\\mu L)\n$$\n$$\np = \\mu L\n$$\nAlternatively, we could substitute the expression for the ratio $\\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu L)$ into the definition of $p$:\n$$\np = -\\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\mu L)\\right)\n$$\nSince the natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ and the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ are inverse functions, $\\ln(\\exp(y)) = y$.

This relationship can be expressed in the general form of a linear equation:\n$$\n\\text{HU}(\\mu) = A \\cdot \\mu + B\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. To determine these constants, we use the two calibration points provided in the definition of the HU scale:\n1.  For water, the HU value is $0$. With the given $\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\text{HU}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}) = A \\cdot \\mu_{\\mathrm{water}} + B = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    A \\cdot (0.020) + B = 0 \\quad \\cdots \\quad (1)\n    $$\n2.  For air, the HU value is $-1000$. With the given approximation $\\mu_{\\mathrm{air}} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\text{HU}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{air}}) = A \\cdot \\mu_{\\mathrm{air}} + B = -1000\n    $$\n    $$\n    A \\cdot (0) + B = -1000 \\quad \\cdots \\quad (2)\n    $$\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we immediately find the value of the constant $B$:\n$$\nB = -1000\n$$\nSubstituting this value of $B$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\nA \\cdot (0.020) - 1000 = 0\n$$\nSolving for the constant $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{1000}{0.020} = 50000\n$$\nThe units of $A$ would be $\\mathrm{mm}$. Thus, the specific mapping from $\\mu$ (in $\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$) to HU is:\n$$\n\\text{HU}(\\mu) = 50000 \\cdot \\mu - 1000\n$$\nThis is the derived mapping based on the given calibration values. It is often more convenient to express this relationship in terms of the attenuation coefficient of water. We can factor out the constant $A$ in a different way from the initial equations. The general formula can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{HU}(\\mu) = K \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}}\n$$\nLet's verify this form. For $\\mu = \\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}$, $\\text{HU}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}) = 0$. For $\\mu = \\mu_{\\mathrm{air}} \\approx 0$, we have $\\text{HU}(0) = K \\frac{0 - \\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}} = -K$. Since we know $\\text{HU}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{air}}) = -1000$, it follows that the scaling constant is $K = 1000$. The general mapping is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{HU}(\\mu) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}} \\right) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the standard definition of the Hounsfield scale under the assumption that $\\mu_\\mathrm{air}$ is negligible.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Tissue's HU Value**\n\nWe are given the attenuation coefficient for a homogeneous soft tissue as $\\mu = 0.022\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$ and for water as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$. We use the derived mapping to compute the HU value for this tissue.\n$$\n\\text{HU}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = 1000 \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{tissue}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{water}}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\text{HU}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = 1000 \\left( \\frac{0.022\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}}{0.020\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{HU}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = 1000 \\left( 1.1 - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{HU}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = 1000 \\left( 0.1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{HU}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = 100\n$$\nThe calculated HU value for the tissue is an integer, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of Beam Hardening and Bias in HU**\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law, $I = I_{0}\\exp(-\\mu \\ell)$, is strictly valid only for a monoenergetic X-ray beam. However, X-ray tubes used in CT scanners produce a polychromatic spectrum of energies, primarily through bremsstrahlung radiation. The linear attenuation coefficient, $\\mu$, is a function of photon energy, $\\mu(E)$. For materials relevant to diagnostic imaging (e.g., water, tissue, bone), $\\mu(E)$ generally decreases as energy $E$ increases.\n\nWhen a polychromatic X-ray beam passes through a material, the lower-energy photons are attenuated more readily than the higher-energy photons. This is because the attenuation coefficient $\\mu(E)$ is larger at lower energies. As a result, the composition of the X-ray spectrum changes as it traverses the object; the proportion of high-energy photons increases, and the mean energy of the beam shifts to a higher value. This phenomenon is known as **beam hardening**.\n\nCT reconstruction algorithms are typically based on a linearized model that assumes a single effective energy. They calculate a single effective attenuation coefficient $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for each point in the object based on the total measured attenuation along many paths. Because of beam hardening, the effective attenuation coefficient for a given material is not constant; it depends on the total path length and the composition of the material traversed by the beam. A longer path through an attenuating medium results in a \"harder\" beam (higher mean energy). Since $\\mu(E)$ decreases with $E$, a harder beam experiences less attenuation. Consequently, the measured effective attenuation coefficient, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, for a given material will be *lower* if it is measured with a beam that has already been hardened by passing through a significant amount of tissue.\n\nThis directly introduces a bias in the HU values. The HU scale is a linear function of the measured $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. For a water-like soft tissue deep inside a large object (e.g., at the center of a large patient or a large cylindrical phantom), the X-ray beam has been significantly hardened by the surrounding tissue. The measured $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for this central tissue will be artifactually low compared to the $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the same tissue at the periphery, where the beam has traversed less material. Since a lower $\\mu$ corresponds to a lower HU value, the HU for a water-like soft tissue deep inside a large object is expected to be biased **downward** relative to the monoenergetic ideal. This effect gives rise to the \"cupping artifact\" seen in CT images of uniform objects, where the HU values in the center are lower than at the edges.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{100}\n$$", "id": "4533528"}, {"introduction": "A CT image is not a perfect representation of reality; it is a discretized grid of voxels, each with a finite size.

Then:\n$$x_{90} = z_{0.8} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$$\n$$x_{10} = \\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(-0.8) \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}} = -z_{0.8} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$$\nThe rise distance is:\n$$D_{10\\text{–}90} = x_{90} - x_{10} = z_{0.8} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}} - (-z_{0.8} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}) = 2 z_{0.8} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$, we get the desired closed-form expression:\n$$D_{10\\text{–}90} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.8) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sigma_k^2 + \\frac{d^2}{12}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this for $\\sigma_k = 0.35 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $d = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nFirst, calculate the effective variance:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}^2 = (0.35)^2 + \\frac{(0.70)^2}{12} = 0.1225 + \\frac{0.49}{12} \\approx 0.1225 + 0.0408333... = 0.163333... \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nThe effective standard deviation is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{0.163333...} \\approx 0.404145 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe value of the inverse error function is $\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.8) \\approx 0.906194$.\nNow, we calculate $D_{10\\text{–}90}$:\n$$D_{10\\text{–}90} \\approx 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (0.906194) \\cdot (0.404145) \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$D_{10\\text{–}90} \\approx (2.828427) \\cdot (0.906194) \\cdot (0.404145) \\ \\mathrm{mm} \\approx 1.0359 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.036 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n446.0 & 1.036\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4533480"}]}
