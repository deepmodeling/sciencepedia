Not all autoimmunity is the same; the clinical course and prognosis depend critically on the underlying immune mechanism.

Consider the following two prototypical clinical trajectories and the core immunologic principles that govern self–nonself discrimination and the generation of adaptive immune responses:\n\n- Self-tolerance normally eliminates or anergizes high-affinity lymphocytes against self antigens during thymic and bone marrow selection. Tumors can aberrantly express developmentally restricted or ectopic self antigens, providing a persistent source of antigen that sustains high-avidity cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. In this context, autoimmunity can arise via cross-reactivity to shared antigens between the tumor and host tissue (onconeural antigens), often accompanied by epitope spreading and progressive tissue damage if the tumor persists.\n- In contrast, infections can initiate autoimmunity via molecular mimicry, in which pathogen-derived epitopes resemble host structures. The adaptive response is typically triggered by a transient antigenic exposure, often followed by partial or full resolution as the infectious stimulus abates. Antibody specificities frequently target cell-surface or myelin-associated glycolipids, and the clinical course often parallels antigen clearance and responds to immunomodulation.\n\nCase A: A $68$-year-old woman develops a subacute ($\\approx 6$ weeks) progressive gait ataxia and downbeat nystagmus without antecedent febrile illness. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) shows mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is unremarkable. Serum testing identifies anti-Yo (Purkinje cell cytoplasmic) onconeural antibodies. Despite corticosteroids, deficits progress. Tumor-directed imaging reveals an occult breast carcinoma. Neurologic stabilization follows oncologic therapy. \n\nCase B: A $24$-year-old man develops acute ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia $2$ weeks after a diarrheal illness.

The analysis hinges on the location of the target antigen and the resulting immune effector mechanism.\n\n- In **Case A**, the syndrome is associated with anti-Yo antibodies, which target an **intracellular** protein within cerebellar Purkinje cells. An immune response against an intracellular antigen is primarily mediated by **cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD$8^+$ T-cells)**, which cause irreversible neuronal death. This process is driven by the persistent antigenic stimulus from the underlying breast carcinoma, explaining the progressive course and stabilization only after cancer treatment.\n\n- In **Case B**, the syndrome is associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies, which target a ganglioside on the **cell surface** of neurons. This process is directly mediated by the antibodies themselves, often triggered by a transient infection. The resulting neuronal dysfunction is often reversible and responds well to immunotherapies like IVIG that remove or neutralize the antibodies.\n\nNow, we analyze the options:\n\n**A. Autoantibodies directed against intracellular neuronal antigens, indicating a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CD$8^+$)-mediated neuronal loss that persists unless the neoplasm is controlled.**\n- This statement accurately describes the pathophysiology of Case A.
