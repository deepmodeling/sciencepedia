Fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors, $[RL]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $[R_{total}]$.\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of unbound ($[R]$) and bound ($[RL]$) receptors:\n$$[R_{total}] = [R] + [RL]$$\nThus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{total}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nFrom the given definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{D} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, we can solve for the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{D}[RL]}{[L]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{D}[RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nWe can factor out $[RL]$ from the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1\\right)}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of complexes, $[RL] \\neq 0$, we can cancel this term:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nThe problem states that the effective antigen density $D$ substitutes for the ligand concentration $[L]$. Therefore, the fractional occupancy as a function of $D$ and $K_{D}$ is:\n$$\\theta(D) = \\frac{D}{K_{D} + D}$$\nNow, we compute the fractional occupancy for the tumor and normal tissues using the given values.\n\nFor the tumor tissue, with $D_{t} = 1 \\times 10^{5}$ and $K_{D} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$:\n$$\\theta_{t} = \\frac{D_{t}}{K_{D} + D_{t}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{2 \\times 10^{4} + 1 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{0.2 \\times 10^{5} + 1 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{1.2 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1}{1.2} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nFor the normal tissue, with $D_{n} = 5 \\times 10^{3}$ and $K_{D} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$:\n$$\\theta_{n} = \\frac{D_{n}}{K_{D} + D_{n}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{2 \\times 10^{4} + 5 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{20 \\times 10^{3} + 5 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{25 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nThe problem states that the effective stimulus for activation is proportional to the fractional occupancy. Let a generic activation stimulus be $S$.

The fractional occupancy in normal tissue, $\\theta_{n}$, is calculated to be $1/5$, or $0.2$. This is a substantial level of receptor engagement. Since CAR T-cell activation is proportional to this occupancy, it implies a significant degree of activation will occur in the normal tissue. The relative activation ratio of tumor to normal tissue is only $\\approx 4.17$. This low ratio represents a narrow therapeutic window. It suggests that in order to achieve a therapeutically effective level of activation against tumor cells (which have an occupancy of $\\theta_t = 5/6 \\approx 0.833$), a significant and potentially harmful level of activation against normal cells is unavoidable. Therefore, there is a high predicted risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity, where CAR T-cells attack healthy tissues that express the target antigen at lower levels.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.17}\n$$", "id": "4770280"}, {"introduction": "As immunotherapies become more common, predicting which patients will suffer severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is a critical clinical need.
