We are asked to compute the fold-change in downstream target gene expression, which is the ratio $\\frac{E_T}{E_B}$, where $E$ represents the expression level of the target gene.\n\nLet's follow the chain of causality as described in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **MYC Protein Concentration $([\\mathrm{MYC}])$**\n    Let $G$ be the gene copy number (gene dose) and $R_p$ be the per-copy transcription rate. The problem states that the total transcript production, let's call it $R_{total}$, scales with the product of these two quantities.\n    $$R_{total} \\propto G \\cdot R_p$$\n    The problem also states that the steady-state protein concentration, $[\\mathrm{MYC}]$, is proportional to the total transcript production.\n    $$[\\mathrm{MYC}] \\propto R_{total}$$\n    Combining these two proportionalities, we have:\n    $$[\\mathrm{MYC}] \\propto G \\cdot R_p$$\n    We can write this relationship for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B = k_1 G_B R_{p,B}$$\n    $$[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T = k_1 G_T R_{p,T}$$\n    where $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in $\\mathrm{MYC}$ protein concentration is the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T}{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T}{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B} = \\frac{k_1 G_T R_{p,T}}{k_1 G_B R_{p,B}} = \\left(\\frac{G_T}{G_B}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_{p,T}}{R_{p,B}}\\right)$$\n    From the givens, we have:\n    - Gene copy number fold-change: $\\frac{G_T}{G_B} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\n    - Per-copy transcription fold-change: $\\frac{R_{p,T}}{R_{p,B}} = 4$.\n\n    Substituting these values:\n    $$\\frac{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T}{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B} = (4) \\cdot (4) = 16$$\n\n2.  **Fractional Promoter Occupancy $(O)$**\n    The problem states that promoter binding exhibits Hill-type behavior with a Hill coefficient $n=2$, and that in the low-occupancy regime, the fractional occupancy $O$ is proportional to $[\\mathrm{MYC}]^n$.\n    $$O \\propto [\\mathrm{MYC}]^n$$\n    We can write this for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$O_B = k_2 [\\mathrm{MYC}]_B^n$$\n    $$O_T = k_2 [\\mathrm{MYC}]_T^n$$\n    where $k_2$ is another constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in fractional occupancy is the ratio $\\frac{O_T}{O_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{O_T}{O_B} = \\frac{k_2 [\\mathrm{MYC}]_T^n}{k_2 [\\mathrm{MYC}]_B^n} = \\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T}{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B}\\right)^n$$\n    We have already calculated $\\frac{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_T}{[\\mathrm{MYC}]_B} = 16$, and we are given $n=2$.\n    $$\\frac{O_T}{O_B} = (16)^2 = 256$$\n\n3.  **Downstream Target Gene Expression $(E)$**\n    Finally, the problem states that the downstream target gene expression $E$ is proportional to the fractional promoter occupancy $O$.\n    $$E \\propto O$$\n    Thus, for the baseline and tumor states:\n    $$E_B = k_3 O_B$$\n    $$E_T = k_3 O_T$$\n    where $k_3$ is a third constant of proportionality.\n\n    The fold-change in expression, which is the desired final answer, is the ratio $\\frac{E_T}{E_B}$:\n    $$\\frac{E_T}{E_B} = \\frac{k_3 O_T}{k_3 O_B} = \\frac{O_T}{O_B}$$\n    From the previous step, we found that this ratio is $256$.\n    $$\\frac{E_T}{E_B} = 256$$\n\nThe fold-change in downstream target gene expression in the tumor relative to the baseline is $256$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{256}$$", "id": "4808301"}, {"introduction": "While oncogenes are activated in cancer, tumor suppressor genes must be inactivated. This practice focuses on p53, a critical tumor suppressor that functions as a tetramer, to explore the crucial distinction between haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative mutations [@problem_id:4808327]. Through probabilistic modeling, you will calculate the starkly different impacts these two mechanisms have on p53 function, providing a quantitative basis for understanding their roles in carcinogenesis.", "problem": "Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is a transcription factor that functions as a tetramer composed of four identical subunits. In carcinogenesis, loss of p53 function can arise through dominant-negative missense mutations that retain tetramerization but impair function when incorporated, or through haploinsufficiency in which reduced dosage of functional subunits lowers overall activity without poisoning mixed complexes. Starting from fundamental definitions, recall that, by the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, allelic variation alters protein sequence and function, and that oligomeric complexes assemble from monomer pools according to mass action in a well-mixed cellular environment. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) p53 must bind deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a tetramer to activate target gene transcription, (ii) mixed tetramers assemble randomly from the available monomer pool, and (iii) the cellular monomer pool contains a fraction $q$ of mutant subunits and a fraction $1 - q$ of wild-type subunits, with $0 \\le q \\le 1$, reflecting a heterozygous mutant state with equal expression from both alleles but allowing for any $q$ due to variable stability or expression.\n\nExplain, in mechanistic terms grounded in molecular pathophysiology, the difference between dominant-negative loss of function and haploinsufficiency for TP53. Then, model random tetramer assembly by selecting $4$ subunits independently from the monomer pool. Define the functional activity of a tetramer under two distinct mechanisms:\n- Dominant-negative: any tetramer containing at least one mutant subunit has activity $0$, and only an all wild-type tetramer has activity $1$.\n- Haploinsufficiency: the activity of a tetramer is proportional to the number of wild-type subunits it contains; a tetramer with $k$ wild-type subunits has activity $k/4$, with an all wild-type tetramer normalized to activity $1$.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and well-tested probability facts, derive a closed-form expression for the expected functional p53 tetramer fraction as a function of $q$ for each mechanism. Report your two expressions together as a row matrix, with the first entry corresponding to haploinsufficiency and the second entry corresponding to dominant-negative. No numerical substitution is required, and no rounding is needed.", "solution": "The central task is to explain the molecular pathophysiological distinction between haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative loss of function for the p53 protein and then to derive quantitative models for the expected functional activity in each case.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanistic distinction. The p53 protein functions as a tetramer, a complex of four identical protein subunits, to bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor. In a state of heterozygosity for a `TP53` mutation, cells produce both wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) p53 monomers.\n- **Haploinsufficiency**: This term describes a situation where the total level of functional protein is reduced simply because one of the two gene copies (alleles) is non-functional. For p53, a haploinsufficient mutation might be a null mutation that produces no protein or a protein that is immediately degraded. The consequence is a reduction in the total pool of available p53 monomers. The problem specifies a more general model where the activity of a tetramer is proportional to the number of WT subunits it contains. This means a mixed tetramer is not completely non-functional, but its activity is diminished. It models a dose-dependent effect where each WT subunit contributes a quantum of activity, and the loss of activity is directly proportional to the loss of WT subunits.\n- **Dominant-Negative Effect**: This mechanism is more severe. A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that is structurally stable and can co-assemble with WT subunits into a tetramer. However, the presence of even one such mutant subunit within the tetramer is sufficient to \"poison\" the entire complex, rendering it non-functional. The mutant protein actively interferes with the function of the WT protein, dominating its phenotype. For p53, this means a mixed tetramer cannot bind DNA correctly or otherwise fails to activate transcription, making the functional output much lower than what would be predicted by simple gene dosage reduction.\n\nTo derive the functional fractions, we model the assembly of tetramers as $4$ independent Bernoulli trials. The probability of selecting a wild-type subunit is $p_{WT} = 1-q$, and the probability of selecting a mutant subunit is $p_{MUT} = q$. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of wild-type subunits in a tetramer. $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ (number of subunits) and $p = 1-q$ (probability of selecting a wild-type subunit). The probability mass function for $K$ is:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nwhere $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**1. Haploinsufficiency Model**\n\nThe activity of a tetramer with $k$ wild-type subunits is defined as $A_H(k) = \\frac{k}{4}$. The expected functional activity, $E[A_H]$, is the sum of the activities of all possible tetramer compositions, each weighted by its probability of formation.\n$$ E[A_H] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} A_H(k) P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\left(\\frac{k}{4}\\right) \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nWe can factor out the constant $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ E[A_H] = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=0}^{4} k \\binom{4}{k} (1-q)^k q^{4-k} $$\nThe summation $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} k P(K=k)$ is the definition of the expected value of the binomial random variable $K$, which is given by $E[K] = np$. In this context, $n=4$ and $p=1-q$.\nTherefore, the expected number of wild-type subunits per tetramer is:\n$$ E[K] = 4(1-q) $$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for $E[A_H]$:\n$$ E[A_H] = \\frac{1}{4} E[K] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4(1-q) \\right) = 1-q $$\nThe expected functional fraction for the haploinsufficiency mechanism is $1-q$.\n\n**2. Dominant-Negative Model**\n\nThe activity of a tetramer is defined as $A_{DN}(k) = 1$ if and only if $k=4$, and $A_{DN}(k) = 0$ for $k4$. A tetramer is functional only if it is composed exclusively of wild-type subunits.\nThe expected functional activity, $E[A_{DN}]$, is:\n$$ E[A_{DN}] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} A_{DN}(k) P(K=k) $$\nSince $A_{DN}(k)$ is non-zero only for $k=4$, the sum collapses to a single term:\n$$ E[A_{DN}] = A_{DN}(4) \\cdot P(K=4) = (1) \\cdot P(K=4) = P(K=4) $$\nWe now calculate the probability that a tetramer has exactly $4$ wild-type subunits by setting $k=4$ in the binomial probability formula:\n$$ P(K=4) = \\binom{4}{4} (1-q)^4 q^{4-4} = (1) \\cdot (1-q)^4 \\cdot q^0 = (1-q)^4 $$\nThe expected functional fraction for the dominant-negative mechanism is $(1-q)^4$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting these two expressions as a row matrix, with haploinsufficiency first and dominant-negative second.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1-q  (1-q)^4 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4808327"}, {"introduction": "A tumor is an evolving population of cells, and this heterogeneity is a major clinical challenge.

The variant allele frequency (VAF), denoted $v$, is defined operationally as the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the mutated allele at a locus.

Let $f$ be the fraction of cancer cells that harbor this mutation. The number of cancer cells carrying the mutation is $N_{c,mut} = f N_c = f \\pi N_{total}$.\n\nThe problem states that the mutation is heterozygous in the cancer cells that have it. This means each mutated cancer cell has one mutated allele and one wild-type allele. Normal cells, by definition for a somatic mutation, do not carry the mutated allele. The total number of mutated alleles, $A_{mut}$, in the sample is therefore:\n$$ A_{mut} = (1 \\text{ allele/mutated cell}) \\times N_{c,mut} + (0 \\text{ alleles/normal cell}) \\times N_n $$\n$$ A_{mut} = 1 \\times (f \\pi N_{total}) + 0 = f \\pi N_{total} $$\n\nThe variant allele frequency, $v$, is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the mutated allele.
