The solution will be derived from first principles using the provided assumptions and Poiseuille's law.\n\nThe problem statement provides the following assumptions:\n1.  The flow of blood, a Newtonian fluid, is steady and laminar through the arteriolar network.\n2.  The arterioles are modeled as cylindrical tubes.\n3.  The arteriolar network is the dominant contributor to SVR.\n4.  SVR is proportional to the total hydrodynamic resistance of the arteriolar network.\n5.  Blood viscosity, $\\eta$, and the lengths of the arteriolar segments, $L$, remain constant.\n6.  The average arteriolar radius, $r$, increases uniformly by $20\\%$.\n\nWe begin with Poiseuille's law for the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through a single cylindrical tube:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nHydrodynamic resistance, which we will denote as $R_{hydro}$, is defined as the ratio of the pressure drop to the volumetric flow rate:\n$$R_{hydro} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\n\nBy rearranging Poiseuille's law, we can express the resistance of a single arteriolar segment as:\n$$R_{hydro} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\n\nThe problem states that SVR is proportional to the hydrodynamic resistance of the entire arteriolar network. The total resistance of the network, regardless of the specific parallel and series arrangement of the vessels, will be a function of the individual vessel resistances, $R_{hydro}$. Assuming the number of vessels and their configuration do not change, the total network resistance is directly proportional to the resistance of a single representative vessel segment. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\text{SVR} \\propto R_{hydro}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{hydro}$, we get:\n$$\\text{SVR} \\propto \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\n\nAccording to the problem, the viscosity $\\eta$ and length $L$ are constant. The terms $8$ and $\\pi$ are also constants. Therefore, we can express the relationship between SVR and the arteriolar radius $r$ as a simple proportionality:\n$$\\text{SVR} = \\frac{k}{r^4}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that consolidates all the invariant terms ($k \\propto \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi}$).\n\nLet $R_{\\text{old}}$ be the baseline SVR when the radius is $r_{\\text{old}}$, and let $R_{\\text{new}}$ be the SVR after vasodilation when the radius is $r_{\\text{new}}$.

The calculated value of $649 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$ is significantly reduced, primarily due to the patient's anemia ($\\text{Hb} = 10 \\text{ g/dL}$) which cannot be fully compensated for by the high cardiac output state ($CO = 5 \\text{ L/min}$). A normal resting $VO_2$ is approximately $250 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$. The calculated $VO_2$ of $207 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{min}$ is low, which in the context of sepsis (a high metabolic demand state) suggests that oxygen consumption is limited by supply. The normal oxygen extraction ratio is $0.25$ to $0.30$. The calculated $O_2ER$ of $0.319$ is elevated, indicating that tissues are extracting a larger fraction of the delivered oxygen to meet metabolic needs. This compensation mechanism demonstrates that the patient is on the verge of, or already experiencing, supply-dependent oxygen consumption. This state, where $VO_2$ becomes directly proportional to $DO_2$, signifies dysoxic shock and a high risk of cellular hypoxia and subsequent organ dysfunction (MODS), even in the presence of high cardiac output. The underlying pathophysiology in sepsis includes microcirculatory dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment, which can raise the critical $DO_2$ threshold below which supply dependency occurs.

The key is the near-equilibrium lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction:\n$$ \\text{pyruvate} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\leftrightarrow \\text{lactate} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ $$\n\nAssuming this reaction is near equilibrium, the law of mass action states that the ratio of products to reactants is approximately equal to the equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$:\n$$ K_{eq} \\approx \\frac{[\\text{lactate}][\\mathrm{NAD}^+]}{[\\text{pyruvate}][\\mathrm{NADH}][\\mathrm{H}^+]} $$\nwhere the brackets denote concentrations.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the cytosolic redox state, represented by the ratio $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^+]$:\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{NADH}]}{[\\mathrm{NAD}^+]} \\approx \\frac{1}{K_{eq} \\cdot [\\mathrm{H}^+]} \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{lactate}]}{[\\text{pyruvate}]} $$\n\nThis equation shows that the cytosolic $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^+]$ ratio is directly proportional to the lactate-to-pyruvate (L/P) ratio. The term $1/(K_{eq} \\cdot [\\mathrm{H}^+])$ can be considered a constant under relatively stable intracellular pH conditions.\n\nThe normal cytosolic L/P ratio in resting, healthy cells is approximately $10:1$. The patient's L/P ratio is given as $10$ ($6.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} / 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). This indicates that despite the pathological state, the cytosolic redox ratio, $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^+]$, is near its normal or baseline level.\n\nHowever, the absolute concentrations of both lactate ($6.0$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) and pyruvate ($0.60$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) are significantly elevated.\n- Normal lactate is typically $< 2.0$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n- Normal pyruvate is typically $0.05-0.10$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\nWe must interpret this situation: a normal redox state (normal L/P ratio) in the presence of marked hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvatemia.\n\n1.  **High Pyruvate**: Pyruvate is the end-product of glycolysis. A high level suggests that the rate of glycolytic flux is very high, producing pyruvate faster than it can be consumed by downstream pathways. This \"aerobic glycolysis\" is a known feature of the septic state, driven by catecholamine stimulation.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate's Fates**: Pyruvate has two main fates:\n    a) Conversion to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ($\\text{PDH}$) for entry into the mitochondrial $\\text{TCA}$ cycle.\n    b) Conversion to lactate by $\\text{LDH}$ in the cytosol.\n\n3.  **The Bottleneck**: The simultaneous elevation of both pyruvate and lactate, while their ratio remains normal, points to a bottleneck downstream of pyruvate but upstream of the processes that would drastically alter the cytosolic redox state. A severe failure of the electron transport chain ($\\text{ETC}$), for example due to profound tissue hypoxia, would prevent the reoxidation of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ to $\\mathrm{NAD}^+$. This would cause a massive increase in the cytosolic $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^+]$ ratio, forcing the $\\text{LDH}$ equilibrium far to the right and leading to a very high L/P ratio (e.g., > $20$). Since the L/P ratio is normal, severe $\\text{ETC}$ failure is not the primary mechanism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The most logical explanation is that the high glycolytic flux is overwhelming the capacity of the $\\text{PDH}$ complex to shuttle pyruvate into the mitochondria. $\\text{PDH}$ activity is known to be inhibited in sepsis by inflammatory mediators. This creates a \"traffic jam\" at the entry point to the mitochondria. The accumulating pyruvate is then shunted to lactate to regenerate the $\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ needed to sustain the high rate of glycolysis. Because both substrate (pyruvate) and product (lactate) increase proportionally, the L/P ratio (and thus the cytosolic redox state) remains relatively unchanged. This indicates that the $\\text{ETC}$ is still functional enough to handle the cytosolic redox load and is not the site of profound limitation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio is markedly elevated, indicating severe ETC failure and tissue hypoxia as the dominant mechanism of hyperlactatemia.**\nAs derived, the cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio is proportional to the L/P ratio. The given L/P ratio of $10$ is normal, not markedly elevated. A markedly elevated redox ratio would produce an L/P ratio significantly greater than $10$. Therefore, this option's premise contradicts the data.\n\n**B. The cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio is near baseline, consistent with high glycolytic flux and impaired PDH-mediated entry of pyruvate into mitochondria; ETC activity is not profoundly limited.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our derivation. A near-baseline L/P ratio of $10$ implies a near-baseline cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio. The combination of high glycolytic flux (producing excess pyruvate) and impaired $\\text{PDH}$ activity (blocking pyruvate's entry into mitochondria) explains the proportional rise in both pyruvate and lactate. The normal L/P ratio confirms that there is no profound $\\text{ETC}$ failure causing a systemic redox shift.\n\n**C. The cytosolic $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio is normal, and the hyperlactatemia is best explained by impaired hepatic clearance alone, with normal mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate.**\nWhile impaired hepatic clearance contributes to hyperlactatemia in sepsis, it does not explain the very high level of pyruvate ($0.60$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). If mitochondrial oxidation were normal, the high glycolytic flux would have to be perfectly matched by lactate production, but there would be no reason for pyruvate to accumulate to such a high degree. The elevated pyruvate is a key finding that points to a production/utilization imbalance at the level of $\\text{PDH}$, not just a clearance issue.\n\n**D. The cytosolic redox is shifted toward oxidation (higher $\\mathrm{NAD}^+$), implying reduced glycolysis and low lactate production, so the elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of $10$ reflects measurement error rather than pathophysiology.**\nA shift toward oxidation means a *lower* $\\mathrm{NADH}/\\mathrm{NAD}^+$ ratio, which would result in an L/P ratio *lower* than $10$. Furthermore, the patient has hyperlactatemia ($6.0$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$), which reflects high, not low, lactate production/accumulation.
