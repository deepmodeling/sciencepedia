To reason about oxygen delivery in shock from first principles, begin with the following core facts: (i) each gram of hemoglobin ($Hb$) can bind up to a fixed volume of oxygen when fully saturated, and the actually bound oxygen scales linearly with the arterial oxygen saturation ($S_{aO_2}$); (ii) oxygen dissolved in plasma obeys Henry’s law, with a constant solubility coefficient that relates the dissolved oxygen content to the arterial oxygen partial pressure ($P_{aO_2}$). Let $C_{aO_2}$ denote the arterial oxygen content in milliliters of oxygen per deciliter of blood (mL O$_2$/dL).

It is based on the fundamental principles of respiratory physiology, specifically the transport of oxygen in the blood. All necessary constants and variables are provided, and their values are physiologically realistic. The problem is a standard, formalizable exercise in quantitative physiology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe total arterial oxygen content, denoted as $C_{aO_2}$, is the sum of two components: the oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin ($Hb$) and the oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma. This can be expressed as:\n$$C_{aO_2} = (\\text{Oxygen bound to } Hb) + (\\text{Oxygen dissolved in plasma})$$\n\nLet us analyze each component based on the provided first principles.\n\nFirst, we consider the oxygen bound to hemoglobin. The problem states that each gram of hemoglobin can bind up to a fixed volume of oxygen, given as a capacity of $1.34$ mL O$_2$ per gram of $Hb$. The total hemoglobin concentration is given as $Hb$ in units of g/dL. Therefore, the maximum oxygen-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin in one deciliter of blood is the product of these two quantities:\n$$\\text{Maximum } O_2 \\text{ capacity via } Hb = 1.34 \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{g Hb}} \\times Hb \\left[\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}}\\right]$$\nThe problem further states that the actually bound oxygen scales linearly with the arterial oxygen saturation, $S_{aO_2}$ (a unitless fraction representing the proportion of hemoglobin that is saturated). Thus, the component of arterial oxygen content contributed by hemoglobin-bound oxygen, let's call it $C_{HbO_2}$, is:\n$$C_{HbO_2} = 1.34 \\cdot Hb \\cdot S_{aO_2}$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{g}}) \\cdot (\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}}) \\cdot (\\text{unitless}) = \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}}$.\n\nSecond, we consider the oxygen dissolved in the plasma. The problem states that this follows Henry’s law, where the amount of dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure. The proportionality constant is the solubility coefficient, given as $0.003$ mL O$_2$ per deciliter per mmHg. The arterial oxygen partial pressure is $P_{aO_2}$. The component of arterial oxygen content contributed by dissolved oxygen, let's call it $C_{dissolved O_2}$, is:\n$$C_{dissolved O_2} = 0.003 \\cdot P_{aO_2}$$\nThe units are also consistent: $(\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}) \\cdot (\\text{mmHg}) = \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}}$.\n\nCombining these two components gives the closed-form expression for the total arterial oxygen content, $C_{aO_2}$, as requested:\n$$C_{aO_2} = (1.34 \\cdot Hb \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (0.003 \\cdot P_{aO_2})$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the fraction of total arterial oxygen content contributed by dissolved oxygen for a specific set of typical physiological values.

Governing Equations**\nThe relationship between Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$), Central Venous Pressure ($CVP$), Cardiac Output ($CO$), and Systemic Vascular Resistance ($SVR$) is the circulatory analogue of Ohm's Law:\n$$MAP - CVP = CO \\times SVR$$\nSystemic oxygen delivery ($DO_2$) is the product of cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content ($CaO_2$):\n$$DO_2 = CO \\times CaO_2$$\nArterial oxygen content ($CaO_2$) is calculated as the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma:\n$$CaO_2 = (Hb \\times 1.34 \\times SaO_2) + (PaO_2 \\times 0.003)$$\nwhere the constant $1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/g\\,Hb}$ is the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, and $0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL/mmHg}$ is the solubility coefficient of oxygen in plasma.\n\n**2. Calculation of Baseline and New Parameters**\n\n**A. Baseline SVR ($SVR_0$)**\nFirst, we calculate the initial systemic vascular resistance using the baseline values.\n$$SVR_0 = \\frac{MAP_0 - CVP_0}{CO_0} = \\frac{55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{8.0\\,\\mathrm{L/min}} = \\frac{45\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{8.0\\,\\mathrm{L/min}} = 5.625\\,\\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot min/L}$$\n\n**B. Calculation of New MAP ($MAP_1$)**\nWe are given the changes in $SVR$ and $CO$.\n- New $SVR_1 = 1.40 \\times SVR_0 = 1.40 \\times 5.625\\,\\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot min/L} = 7.875\\,\\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot min/L}$\n- New $CO_1 = 0.85 \\times CO_0 = 0.85 \\times 8.0\\,\\mathrm{L/min} = 6.8\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$\n- $CVP$ is stated to be unchanged, so $CVP_1 = CVP_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the new mean arterial pressure, $MAP_1$:\n$$MAP_1 = (CO_1 \\times SVR_1) + CVP_1$$\n$$MAP_1 = (6.8\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 7.875\\,\\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot min/L}) + 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$MAP_1 = 53.55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} + 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 63.55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThis value is approximately $64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\n**C. Calculation of Baseline and New Oxygen Delivery ($DO_2$)**\nFirst, we calculate the arterial oxygen content, $CaO_2$. Since $Hb$, $SaO_2$, and $PaO_2$ are unchanged, $CaO_2$ is constant.\n$$CaO_2 = (10\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} \\times 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g} \\times 0.98) + (80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL/mmHg})$$\n$$CaO_2 = 13.132\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} + 0.24\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} = 13.372\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\nTo calculate $DO_2$ in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, we must convert $CO$ from $\\mathrm{L/min}$ to $\\mathrm{dL/min}$ by multiplying by $10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L}$.\n- Baseline $DO_2$ ($DO_{2,0}$):\n$$DO_{2,0} = CO_0 \\times CaO_2 = (8.0\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L}) \\times 13.372\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\n$$DO_{2,0} = 80\\,\\mathrm{dL/min} \\times 13.372\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} = 1069.76\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min} \\approx 1070\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}$$\n- New $DO_2$ ($DO_{2,1}$):\n$$DO_{2,1} = CO_1 \\times CaO_2 = (6.8\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L}) \\times 13.372\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\n$$DO_{2,1} = 68\\,\\mathrm{dL/min} \\times 13.372\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} = 909.296\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min} \\approx 910\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}$$\nThe percentage change in $DO_2$ is $\\frac{909.296}{1069.76} \\approx 0.85$, which represents a $15\\%$ decrease. This is expected, as $DO_2$ is directly proportional to $CO$, which decreased by $15\\%$.\n\n**3. Pathophysiological Explanation**\nThe core of the question lies in understanding why raising $MAP$ (a macrocirculatory goal) may not improve tissue oxygenation in septic shock. The calculations show that while $MAP$ increased from $55$ to $\\approx 64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the total amount of oxygen delivered to the body per minute ($DO_2$) actually decreased from $\\approx 1070$ to $\\approx 910\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. This highlights the disconnect between macro- and microcirculation.\nIn septic shock, systemic inflammation leads to profound microvascular dysfunction. This includes:\n- **Maldistribution of blood flow:** Heterogeneous perfusion where some capillaries are closed or constricted while blood is shunted through others, bypassing tissue that needs oxygen.\n- **Functional shunting:** Blood flows from the arterial to venous circulation without participating in gas exchange.\n- **Endothelial and glycocalyx injury:** The inner lining of the capillaries is damaged, leading to increased permeability (fluid leaks into tissues, causing edema) and impaired regulation of local blood flow and oxygen diffusion.\n- **Loss of capillary recruitment:** The microvasculature loses its ability to open additional capillary beds in response to increased metabolic demand.\nTherefore, even if a vasopressor like norepinephrine raises the systemic blood pressure, this pressure may not be effectively transmitted to the capillaries where oxygen exchange occurs. The vasoconstriction might even exacerbate the shunting and maldistribution. True improvement in tissue oxygenation requires the resolution of this underlying microcirculatory pathology, allowing for effective perfusion and oxygen extraction at the cellular level.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. New $MAP \\approx 64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$; DO$_2$ decreases by about $15\\%$ (from $\\approx 1{,}070$ to $\\approx 910\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}$); increasing SVR may fail to improve tissue oxygenation because persistent microvascular dysfunction (maldistribution, shunting, endothelial and glycocalyx injury) limits capillary recruitment and oxygen extraction until microvascular recovery occurs.**\n- **Evaluation**: The calculated $MAP$ of $63.55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is well-approximated by $64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. The calculated $DO_2$ values (initial $\\approx 1070\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$, final $\\approx 910\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$) match the option, as does the $15\\%$ decrease. The explanation correctly identifies the critical role of microvascular dysfunction in sepsis, explaining why improving a macro-hemodynamic variable like $MAP$ does not guarantee improved tissue oxygenation. The reasoning is sound and consistent with current understanding of septic shock pathophysiology.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B.

However, the claim that $DO_2$ is unchanged is false; it decreases by $15\\%$.
