You are tasked with quantifying renal handling of electrolyte-free water and interpreting the result to guide therapy. Begin from core definitions in renal physiology: the clearance of a solute $x$ is $C_{x} = \\frac{U_{x} \\, V}{P_{x}}$, where $U_{x}$ is the urine concentration of $x$, $P_{x}$ is the plasma concentration of $x$, and $V$ is the urine flow rate.

Using these foundational ideas, derive an expression for the electrolyte-free water clearance in terms of $V$, $U_{Na}$, $U_{K}$, and $P_{Na}$, then compute its value for the following patient data and explain how the sign of this quantity should influence the therapeutic approach to dysnatremias.\n\nPatient data:\n- Plasma sodium concentration $P_{Na} = 120$ mmol/L.\n- Urinary sodium concentration $U_{Na} = 55$ mmol/L.\n- Urinary potassium concentration $U_{K} = 25$ mmol/L.\n- Total urine volume collected over $90$ minutes is $950$ mL.\n\nUse the derived expression to calculate the electrolyte-free water clearance.

The first component is the volume required to excrete urinary solutes at a concentration that is isotonic with plasma. This is known as the osmolar clearance, $C_{osm}$. The second component is the volume of solute-free water that is either added to or removed from this isosmotic fluid, known as the free water clearance, $C_{H_{2}O}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$V = C_{osm} + C_{H_{2}O}$$\nFrom which we can define free water clearance as:\n$$C_{H_{2}O} = V - C_{osm}$$\nThe osmolar clearance is defined analogously to the clearance of any other solute:\n$$C_{osm} = \\frac{U_{osm} \\, V}{P_{osm}}$$\nwhere $U_{osm}$ is the total urine osmolality and $P_{osm}$ is the plasma osmolality.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the **electrolyte-free water clearance**, denoted here as $C_{H_{2}O}^e$. This is a clinical concept that simplifies the analysis by considering only the primary effective monovalent cations, sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$), as the determinants of urine tonicity relative to plasma. The primary determinant of plasma tonicity is the plasma sodium concentration, $P_{Na}$.\n\nFollowing this directive, we define an analogous \"electrolyte clearance,\" $C_{e}$, which represents the hypothetical volume of urine required to excrete the measured amounts of sodium and potassium at a concentration equal to the plasma sodium concentration.\n\nThe total excretion rate of these electrolytes per unit time is given by the product of their combined concentration in urine and the urine flow rate: $(U_{Na} + U_{K}) \\, V$.\n\nTo find the electrolyte clearance, $C_{e}$, we determine the volume of fluid that would contain this amount of electrolytes at a concentration equal to $P_{Na}$:\n$$C_{e} \\cdot P_{Na} = (U_{Na} + U_{K}) \\, V$$\nSolving for $C_{e}$:\n$$C_{e} = \\frac{(U_{Na} + U_{K}) \\, V}{P_{Na}}$$\nThe total urine flow rate, $V$, can now be partitioned into this electrolyte clearance and the electrolyte-free water clearance, $C_{H_{2}O}^e$:\n$$V = C_{e} + C_{H_{2}O}^e$$\nSolving for the electrolyte-free water clearance gives our desired expression:\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e = V - C_{e}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{e}$:\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e = V - \\frac{(U_{Na} + U_{K}) \\, V}{P_{Na}}$$\nFactoring out the urine flow rate $V$, we arrive at the final expression for derivation:\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e = V \\left( 1 - \\frac{U_{Na} + U_{K}}{P_{Na}} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we compute the value of $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ using the provided patient data.\nThe givens are:\n- Plasma sodium concentration $P_{Na} = 120$ mmol/L.\n- Urinary sodium concentration $U_{Na} = 55$ mmol/L.\n- Urinary potassium concentration $U_{K} = 25$ mmol/L.\n- Total urine volume $U_{vol} = 950$ mL collected over a period $T = 90$ minutes.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the urine flow rate, $V$, in mL/min:\n$$V = \\frac{U_{vol}}{T} = \\frac{950 \\text{ mL}}{90 \\text{ min}}$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the derived expression for $C_{H_{2}O}^e$:\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e = \\left( \\frac{950}{90} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{55 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}} + 25 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}}}{120 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}}} \\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the urinary electrolyte concentrations:\n$$U_{Na} + U_{K} = 55 + 25 = 80 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}}$$\nNow, we evaluate the term in the parenthesis:\n$$1 - \\frac{80}{120} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nFinally, we compute the value of $C_{H_{2}O}^e$:\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e = \\left( \\frac{950}{90} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{950}{270} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{95}{27} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\n$$C_{H_{2}O}^e \\approx 3.518518... \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $3.519$ mL/min.\n\nFinally, we must explain the significance of the sign of $C_{H_{2}O}^e$. The sign is determined by the ratio of urinary electrolytes to plasma sodium, $\\frac{U_{Na} + U_{K}}{P_{Na}}$.\n\nA **positive electrolyte-free water clearance ($C_{H_{2}O}^e  0$)**, as calculated for this patient, signifies that the kidneys are excreting a fluid that is hypotonic with respect to electrolytes relative to plasma. This occurs when $(U_{Na} + U_{K})  P_{Na}$. In this state, the body is experiencing a net loss of free water. This physiological response tends to increase the plasma sodium concentration. Such a response is mediated by the suppression of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which reduces water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, leading to the excretion of a large volume of dilute urine.\n- **For the hyponatremic patient in this problem ($P_{Na} = 120$ mmol/L)**, a positive $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ is the appropriate corrective response. It indicates that the cause of the hyponatremia is not renal water retention but likely excessive water intake (primary polydipsia) or recent hypotonic fluid administration. The therapeutic approach would primarily involve water restriction, allowing the kidneys to excrete the excess water and correct the sodium imbalance.\n- **In a patient with hypernatremia**, a positive $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ would be pathologic. It would signify ongoing renal free water loss, which would worsen the hypernatremia. This is the characteristic finding in diabetes insipidus, a condition of inadequate ADH action.\n\nA **negative electrolyte-free water clearance ($C_{H_{2}O}^e  0$)** signifies that the kidneys are excreting a fluid that is hypertonic with respect to electrolytes relative to plasma. This occurs when $(U_{Na} + U_{K})  P_{Na}$. In this state, the body is effectively retaining free water, which tends to decrease the plasma sodium concentration. This response is mediated by the action of ADH, which increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, leading to the excretion of a concentrated, low-volume urine.\n- **In a patient with hyponatremia**, a negative $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ would be the primary pathology. It would indicate that the kidneys are inappropriately retaining water, causing or exacerbating the hyponatremia. This is the hallmark of the Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH). The therapeutic approach would need to be more aggressive, possibly including severe fluid restriction, loop diuretics with salt tablets to increase solute excretion, or ADH-receptor antagonists (vaptans).\n- **In a patient with hypernatremia**, a negative $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ is the expected, appropriate physiological response. It shows that the kidneys are functioning correctly to conserve water to combat the high plasma sodium. The cause of the hypernatremia would thus be non-renal, such as insufficient water intake or excessive extra-renal water losses (e.g., from the skin or gastrointestinal tract). Therapy would focus on replenishing the water deficit.\n\nIn summary, the calculated positive $C_{H_{2}O}^e$ of $+3.519$ mL/min for this hyponatremic patient indicates a proper renal response to a water load, guiding therapy toward simple water restriction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.519}\n$$", "id": "4836444"}, {"introduction": "Clinical management of fluid balance is a dynamic process, not a static calculation.
