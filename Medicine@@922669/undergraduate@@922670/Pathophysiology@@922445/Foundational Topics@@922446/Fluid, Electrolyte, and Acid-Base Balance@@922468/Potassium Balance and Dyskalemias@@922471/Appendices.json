A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core principle governing this problem is the conservation of mass applied to a system in steady state.\n\nLet us define the following quantities:\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{intake}}$: The rate of potassium intake from the diet, given as $100\\,\\text{mmol/day}$.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$: The total rate of potassium elimination from the body.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{urine}}$: The rate of potassium excretion in urine.\n-   $K_{\\mathrm{feces}}$: The rate of potassium excretion in feces.\n-   $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}}$: The net change in total body potassium stores over a given time interval (in this case, one day).\n\nThe principle of mass balance can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}} = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} - K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the adult is in a \"steady state\" and that \"net body potassium stores are unchanged over the day.\" This is the definition of a zero net balance, which mathematically translates to:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{body}} = 0 $$\n\nSubstituting this condition into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$ 0 = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} - K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\nThis implies that in a steady state, the total rate of output must equal the total rate of intake:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = K_{\\mathrm{intake}} $$\n\nWe are given that $K_{\\mathrm{intake}} = 100\\,\\text{mmol/day}$. Therefore, the total daily potassium elimination must also be:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = 100\\,\\text{mmol/day} $$\n\nThe problem also specifies the routes of elimination. Total elimination is the sum of urinary and fecal excretion:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} = K_{\\mathrm{urine}} + K_{\\mathrm{feces}} $$\n\nFurthermore, we are given the fractional contribution of each route to the total elimination:\n-   Renal (urinary) excretion accounts for $90\\%$ of total elimination: $K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$\n-   Fecal excretion accounts for $10\\%$ of total elimination: $K_{\\mathrm{feces}} = 0.10 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$\n\nThe question asks for the expected urinary potassium excretion, $K_{\\mathrm{urine}}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times K_{\\mathrm{output, total}} $$\n\nSubstituting the value we found for $K_{\\mathrm{output, total}}$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 0.90 \\times 100\\,\\text{mmol/day} $$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{urine}} = 90\\,\\text{mmol/day} $$\n\nThus, the expected urinary potassium excretion for this day is $90\\,\\text{mmol}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{90}$$", "id": "4826530"}, {"introduction": "While long-term balance is crucial, the body must also manage acute changes in potassium levels to prevent dangerous fluctuations in plasma concentration.

Based on the provided assumptions, this is equivalent to the change in the potassium concentration of the extracellular fluid (ECF), $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}}$. The solution proceeds by applying the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of potassium that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream (which is part of the ECF).\nLet $K_{\\text{load}}$ be the ingested potassium load and $\\eta_{\\text{abs}}$ be the absorption efficiency. The total absorbed potassium, $K_{\\text{abs}}$, is:\n$$K_{\\text{abs}} = K_{\\text{load}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{abs}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$K_{\\text{abs}} = 100\\,\\text{mmol} \\times 0.9 = 90\\,\\text{mmol}$$\n\nNext, this absorbed potassium is distributed between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF. The problem states that a fraction $f_{\\text{ICF}} = 0.8$ of the absorbed potassium moves into the intracellular compartment. The remaining fraction, $(1 - f_{\\text{ICF}})$, stays in the ECF. This remaining amount, $\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}}$, is the net increase in the quantity of potassium in the ECF.\n$$\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = K_{\\text{abs}} \\times (1 - f_{\\text{ICF}})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = 90\\,\\text{mmol} \\times (1 - 0.8) = 90\\,\\text{mmol} \\times 0.2 = 18\\,\\text{mmol}$$\nThis quantity, $\\Delta K_{\\text{ECF}} = 18\\,\\text{mmol}$, is the total amount of potassium added to the ECF compartment.\n\nThe increase in concentration within the ECF, $\\Delta[K^+]_{\\text{ECF}}$, is this added amount divided by the volume of the ECF, $V_{\\text{ECF}}$. The ECF volume is given as a fraction $v_{\\text{ECF}} = 0.2$ of the body mass $m = 70\\,\\text{kg}$.

The clinical scenario, including the patient's diagnosis and lab values, is plausible.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The problem provides a rich dataset that includes the patient's clinical status, underlying disease, multiple risk factors for pseudohyperkalemia, and a set of discordant laboratory results from different sample types and handling conditions. The discordance is the central element to be resolved, not an internal contradiction in the problem's premises.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem uses precise, quantitative data and objective clinical descriptions, asking for a logical interpretation based on these facts.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by analyzing the provided data in the context of the fundamental principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe core task is to determine if the patient's *in vivo* potassium level is truly elevated. This requires a systematic evaluation of all available evidence.\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation vs. Serum Potassium:** A serum potassium level of $6.6-6.8\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ constitutes severe hyperkalemia. Such a level is a medical emergency and is typically associated with observable clinical signs, most importantly, characteristic ECG changes (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS complex). This patient is asymptomatic and has a completely normal ECG. This major discrepancy strongly suggests that the serum potassium value does not reflect the true physiological state.\n\n2.  **Risk Factors for Pseudohyperkalemia:** The patient presents with a triad of powerful risk factors for pseudohyperkalemia:\n    -   **Severe leukocytosis:** The WBC count is $250 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$. The leukemic lymphocytes are known to be fragile and prone to lysis *in vitro*, releasing their high intracellular potassium content into the serum.\n    -   **Pronounced thrombocytosis:** The platelet count is $800 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$. Platelets are activated during the clotting process required to produce serum, and they release potassium. This effect is significant at high platelet counts.\n    -   **Hemolysis:** The lab flagged a high hemolysis index, confirming that red blood cells ruptured *in vitro*, another source of artifactual potassium elevation.\n    -   **Phlebotomy Technique:** The prolonged tourniquet time and fist clenching are known to cause both local release of potassium into the blood being drawn and mechanical hemolysis.\n\n3.  **Comparison of Serum vs. Plasma/Whole Blood Potassium:** The key to resolving the issue lies in comparing the results from different sample types.\n    -   **Serum samples (clot tubes):** Both measurements are highly elevated ($6.8$ and $6.6\\,\\text{mmol/L}$). Serum is produced by allowing blood to clot. This process itself, combined with the extreme thrombocytosis and fragile leukocytes, provides a clear mechanism for the massive *in vitro* release of potassium.\n    -   **Plasma sample (lithium heparin tube):** This sample is anticoagulated, so no clot forms, and platelet activation is minimized. It was also processed rapidly (within $10$ minutes), reducing the time for fragile white cells and red cells to lyse. The resulting potassium of $4.6\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ is within the normal range.\n    -   **Whole-blood sample (blood gas analyzer):** This sample was also anticoagulated and analyzed almost immediately (within $2$ minutes), providing the most accurate snapshot of the circulating potassium concentration with minimal *in vitro* artifact. The result of $4.7\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ is also normal and corroborates the plasma value.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The concordance between the two normal, rapidly-analyzed, anticoagulated samples ($4.6$ and $4.7\\,\\text{mmol/L}$) and the patient's benign clinical picture confirms that the true *in vivo* potassium level is normal. The elevated serum potassium is an artifact, a classic case of pseudohyperkalemia, caused by the patient's hematologic condition and exacerbated by sample collection and processing. The most appropriate strategy to confirm this is precisely what was done: measure potassium on a sample that avoids the artifact-generating steps, namely a heparinized plasma or whole-blood sample.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The elevated serum potassium is most consistent with pseudohyperkalemia due to in vitro potassium release from platelets, leukocytes, and hemolyzed red blood cells during clotting and handling; confirm by relying on rapidly processed plasma from a lithium heparin tube or immediate whole-blood potassium on a blood gas analyzer rather than serum from clotted samples.**\nThis option correctly identifies the phenomenon as pseudohyperkalemia. It accurately lists the multiple contributing factors present in this patient (platelets, leukocytes, hemolysis) and correctly states that the gold-standard confirmatory method is to use a rapidly processed anticoagulated sample (plasma or whole blood). This statement perfectly aligns with the logical derivation from the provided data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The patient has true life-threatening hyperkalemia because the serum potassium exceeds $6.5\\,\\text{mmol/L}$; immediate therapy with intravenous calcium, insulin, and dextrose is indicated regardless of the ECG or repeat plasma measurements, and repeating samples is an unsafe delay.**\nThis option incorrectly diagnoses true hyperkalemia by fixating on the serum value while ignoring overwhelming contradictory evidence (normal ECG, asymptomatic patient, normal plasma/whole-blood potassium). Initiating emergency treatment would be inappropriate and potentially harmful, as it would risk causing iatrogenic hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The severe leukocytosis causes an in vivo shift of potassium out of cells resulting in true hyperkalemia; the best confirmatory test is urinary potassium excretion to assess renal handling rather than repeating plasma or whole-blood potassium.**\nThis option incorrectly posits an *in vivo* mechanism (potassium shift) when the evidence points to an *in vitro* artifact. The normal plasma and whole-blood values directly refute the claim of an *in vivo* shift. Furthermore, a urinary potassium test is used to evaluate the cause of *true* hyperkalemia (i.e., renal vs. non-renal cause) and is not the appropriate test to distinguish true hyperkalemia from pseudohyperkalemia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The first serum potassium is the most reliable; plasma and blood gas potassium values are prone to dilution and instrument bias and should be disregarded; true hyperkalemia is present and therapy should proceed.**\nThis option makes a factually incorrect claim. In situations of suspected pseudohyperkalemia, serum potassium is the *least* reliable measure, while rapidly processed plasma or whole-blood potassium is the *most* reliable. The discrepancy between $6.8\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ and $4.6\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ is far too large to be explained by typical instrument bias or dilution and is perfectly explained by the known pre-analytical artifacts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. To avoid pseudohyperkalemia, repeat a serum potassium after storing the clotted tube at $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ for $60$ minutes to suppress cell metabolism; if still elevated, treat as true hyperkalemia.**\nThis recommended procedure is scientifically flawed. Cooling blood samples to $4\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ *inhibits* the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase pump, which causes potassium to leak *out* of cells. This would *worsen*, not suppress, pseudohyperkalemia. The correct procedure is to keep the sample at room temperature and process it as quickly as possible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4826460"}]}
