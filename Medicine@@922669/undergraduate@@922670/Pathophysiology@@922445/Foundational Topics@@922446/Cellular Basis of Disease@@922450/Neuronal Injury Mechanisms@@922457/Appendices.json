Investigators want to predict which population will show earlier structural injury under each perturbation and why, using first principles of energy balance and calcium handling.\n\nUse the following foundational bases:\n\n- Neuronal Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) supply relies primarily on oxidative phosphorylation, so ATP supply $S$ scales with oxygen availability. ATP demand $D$ grows with action potential firing frequency and the work of the Sodium–Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase ($\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ ATPase).

During hypoxia, parvalbumin interneurons are injured earlier than pyramidal neurons because the reduced ATP supply $S$ at $50\\%$ of baseline cannot meet their higher fast-spiking ATP demand $D$, collapsing ion homeostasis sooner; during isolated glutamate excess under normoxia, pyramidal neurons are injured earlier because their larger NMDA-mediated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and lower buffer capacity yield a greater rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ than in parvalbumin interneurons.\n\nB.

We will analyze each perturbation separately.\n\n**Perturbation (i): Transient Hypoxia**\n\n1.  **Effect of Hypoxia:** The condition is a reduction of oxygen availability to $50\\%$ of baseline. According to the foundational principles, $\\mathrm{ATP}$ supply ($S$) primarily relies on oxidative phosphorylation and scales with oxygen. Therefore, hypoxia reduces the $\\mathrm{ATP}$ supply $S$ to approximately $50\\%$ of its normal level for both neuron types.\n2.  **Energy Balance ($D$ vs. $S$):** The problem states that injury occurs when $\\mathrm{ATP}$ demand ($D$) exceeds $\\mathrm{ATP}$ supply ($S$). The critical factor for differential vulnerability is the baseline $\\mathrm{ATP}$ demand, $D$.\n3.  **Cell-Type Comparison:**\n    -   **Parvalbumin interneurons:** These are \"fast-spiking\" neurons. The principles state that fast-spiking neurons have higher baseline firing frequencies, which leads to a higher $\\mathrm{ATP}$ demand $D$. Let's call this $D_{PV}$.\n    -   **Pyramidal neurons:** These have \"lower baseline firing rates\", which implies a lower baseline $\\mathrm{ATP}$ demand $D$. Let's call this $D_{PYR}$.\n    -   Therefore, $D_{PV} > D_{PYR}$.\n4.  **Conclusion on Hypoxia:** When the supply $S$ is critically reduced for both cell types, the cell with the higher intrinsic demand, $D_{PV}$, is more likely to experience an energy deficit ($D_{PV} > S_{reduced}$) before the cell with the lower demand ($D_{PYR} > S_{reduced}$). The higher metabolic rate of parvalbumin interneurons makes them more vulnerable to a supply-side crisis. Thus, parvalbumin interneurons are predicted to show structural injury earlier than pyramidal neurons.\n\n**Perturbation (ii): Glutamate Perfusion**\n\n1.  **Effect of Glutamate:** The condition is an elevation of extracellular glutamate to $10\\,\\text{$\\mu$M}$ under normoxia. Normoxia implies that $\\mathrm{ATP}$ supply ($S$) is not compromised. The primary injury mechanism is excitotoxicity, driven by excessive $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through glutamate receptors.\n2.  **Calcium Dynamics:** Injury depends on the magnitude of the increase in cytosolic free calcium, $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$. The problem provides two key factors determining this rise: the influx $J_{\\mathrm{in}}$ (via NMDA receptors) and the buffer capacity $\\kappa_{B}$. The peak rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is attenuated by $\\kappa_{B}$ (proportional to $\\frac{1}{1+\\kappa_{B}}$).\n3.  **Cell-Type Comparison:**\n    -   **Parvalbumin interneurons:** These neurons possess \"substantial calcium buffer capacity\" due to the expression of parvalbumin. This means they have a large $\\kappa_{B}$, let's call it $\\kappa_{B,PV}$. A large $\\kappa_{B,PV}$ will strongly attenuate any rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n    -   **Pyramidal neurons:** These neurons have \"lower calcium buffer capacity\" (small $\\kappa_{B,PYR}$) and \"abundant NMDA receptors\". The abundance of NMDA receptors suggests a large potential for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx ($J_{\\mathrm{in}}$).\n    -   Comparing the two, pyramidal neurons have the combination of a high susceptibility to $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx (abundant NMDA receptors) and a low capacity to buffer that influx (low $\\kappa_{B,PYR}$). Parvalbumin interneurons are protected by their high buffer capacity ($\\kappa_{B,PV} \\gg \\kappa_{B,PYR}$).\n4.  **Conclusion on Glutamate:** The combination of large $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and poor buffering capacity in pyramidal neurons will lead to a much larger and more toxic rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ compared to parvalbumin interneurons. Therefore, pyramidal neurons are predicted to show structural injury earlier than parvalbumin interneurons.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   **Hypoxia:** Parvalbumin interneurons are injured first.\n-   **Glutamate:** Pyramidal neurons are injured first.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. During hypoxia, parvalbumin interneurons are injured earlier than pyramidal neurons because the reduced ATP supply $S$ at $50\\%$ of baseline cannot meet their higher fast-spiking ATP demand $D$, collapsing ion homeostasis sooner; during isolated glutamate excess under normoxia, pyramidal neurons are injured earlier because their larger NMDA-mediated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and lower buffer capacity yield a greater rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ than in parvalbumin interneurons.**\n-   This option's explanation for hypoxia correctly identifies the mismatch between the high energy demand ($D$) of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons and the reduced energy supply ($S$), consistent with our derivation.\n-   This option's explanation for glutamate excess correctly identifies the combination of large $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx (implying high NMDA receptor density) and low buffer capacity in pyramidal neurons as the cause for their greater vulnerability, consistent with our derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Pyramidal neurons are injured earlier in both perturbations because their extensive dendritic arbors and spines increase total membrane area and thus ATP use more than firing frequency does, and because dendritic spines concentrate $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to toxic levels regardless of buffering.**\n-   The claim that pyramidal neurons are injured earlier in both perturbations contradicts our finding for the hypoxia scenario.\n-   The reasoning that membrane area is a more significant determinant of $\\mathrm{ATP}$ use than firing frequency contradicts the problem's explicit statement that demand $D$ \"grows with action potential firing frequency\".\n-   The claim that calcium toxicity occurs \"regardless of buffering\" directly contradicts the provided principle that buffer capacity $\\kappa_{B}$ attenuates the rise in $\\left[\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\right]_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Parvalbumin interneurons resist hypoxia due to higher mitochondrial density that maintains ATP supply $S$ even at $50\\%$ oxygen, but they are more vulnerable to glutamate because their $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are less $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ permeable, causing sodium rather than calcium overload that overwhelms the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ ATPase.**\n-   This option introduces \"higher mitochondrial density\" as a protective factor, which is external information not provided in the problem statement. The conclusion that parvalbumin interneurons *resist* hypoxia is opposite to the one derived from the given principles.\n-   The explanation for glutamate vulnerability invokes mechanisms (AMPA receptor permeability, sodium overload) that are not part of the provided foundational bases, which focus on NMDA receptors and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ overload.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Hypoxia affects both neuron types equally because astrocytic lactate fully compensates energy needs when oxygen is halved, whereas glutamate injures parvalbumin interneurons more because parvalbumin acts as a mobile buffer that enhances $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ delivery to mitochondria, promoting mitochondrial $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ overload in these cells.**\n-   The explanation for hypoxia introduces \"astrocytic lactate,\" an external concept. The claim of \"full compensation\" contradicts the principle that $\\mathrm{ATP}$ supply relies \"primarily on oxidative phosphorylation\" and scales with oxygen.\n-   The explanation for glutamate vulnerability proposes a complex role for parvalbumin (enhancing mitochondrial $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ delivery) that is not described by the simple buffering model provided ($\\Delta[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\propto \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa_{B}}$), which implies protection.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4812482"}]}
