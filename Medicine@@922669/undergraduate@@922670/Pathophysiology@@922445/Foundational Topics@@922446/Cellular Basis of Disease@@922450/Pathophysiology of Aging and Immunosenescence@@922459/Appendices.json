A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nLet $N$ be the replicative capacity, defined as the total number of completed cell divisions before senescence.\nLet $L_0$ be the initial average telomere length.\nLet $L_s$ be the average telomere length at which senescence is triggered.\nLet $\\Delta L$ be the constant length of telomere lost per cell division.\n\nFirst, we establish consistent units. The lengths are given in kilobase pairs ($\\mathrm{kb}$) and base pairs ($\\mathrm{bp}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$. We will convert all lengths to base pairs.\n$L_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 10 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n$L_s = 4\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 4 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 4000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n\nThe total permissible loss of telomere length, let's call it $L_{total}$, is the difference between the initial and senescence-triggering lengths:\n$$L_{total} = L_0 - L_s = 10000\\,\\mathrm{bp} - 4000\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 6000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$$\n\nThe problem states that a constant length $\\Delta L$ is lost with each of the $N$ divisions. Therefore, the total length lost after $N$ divisions is the product $N \\cdot \\Delta L$. Senescence occurs when this total loss equals $L_{total}$. From this first principle, we can write the equation:\n$$N \\cdot \\Delta L = L_0 - L_s$$\n\nSolving for the replicative capacity $N$ as a function of the per-division shortening $\\Delta L$ yields the desired expression:\n$$N(\\Delta L) = \\frac{L_0 - L_s}{\\Delta L}$$\n\nNow, we compute the range of possible replicative lifespans. The problem provides a range for the per-division shortening:\n$\\Delta L \\in [50\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}, 100\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}]$.\n\nFrom the derived expression, $N$ is inversely proportional to $\\Delta L$.\nThe maximum number of divisions, $N_{max}$, corresponds to the minimum shortening rate, $\\Delta L_{min} = 50\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}$:\n$$N_{max} = \\frac{L_0 - L_s}{\\Delta L_{min}} = \\frac{6000\\,\\mathrm{bp}}{50\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}} = 120\\,\\text{divisions}$$\n\nThe minimum number of divisions, $N_{min}$, corresponds to the maximum shortening rate, $\\Delta L_{max} = 100\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}$:\n$$N_{min} = \\frac{L_0 - L_s}{\\Delta L_{max}} = \\frac{6000\\,\\mathrm{bp}}{100\\,\\mathrm{bp/division}} = 60\\,\\text{divisions}$$\n\nThus, the range of possible replicative lifespans for this cell population is $60$ to $120$ completed cell divisions.\n\n**Sources of Variance**\n\nIn a biological system, this calculated range would be affected by additional factors. Elevated oxidative stress, for example from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microenvironment, accelerates telomere damage and shortening, which would increase $\\Delta L$ and thus reduce the replicative lifespan. Conversely, heterogeneity in initial telomere length ($L_0$) across the population means that cells starting with longer-than-average telomeres would undergo more divisions, while those starting with shorter telomeres would senesce earlier, broadening the observed distribution of fates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 60 & 120 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4820431"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cellular to the systemic level, one of the most significant changes in the aging immune system is the involution of the thymus.
