No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the change in net filtration pressure across a capillary wall during an acute inflammatory response, based on specified changes in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. The fundamental physiological principle governing fluid exchange across microvascular endothelium is the Starling equation.\n\nThe net filtration pressure, $P_{net}$, which represents the net driving force for fluid movement, is given by the Starling equation. Adhering to the sign convention that a positive pressure favors filtration from the capillary to the interstitium, the equation is:\n$$P_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$$\nwhere:\n- $P_c$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure.\n- $P_i$ is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure.\n- $\\pi_c$ is the capillary (plasma) oncotic pressure.\n- $\\pi_i$ is the interstitial oncotic pressure.\n- $\\sigma$ is the endothelial reflection coefficient for plasma proteins, which quantifies the effectiveness of the capillary wall in preventing protein leakage.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the total change in the net filtration pressure, $\\Delta P_{net}$, resulting from the given alterations. We can find this by considering the change between an initial state (subscript $1$) and a final state (subscript $2$).\nThe initial net filtration pressure is:\n$$P_{net,1} = (P_{c,1} - P_{i,1}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c,1} - \\pi_{i,1})$$\nThe final net filtration pressure after the changes is:\n$$P_{net,2} = (P_{c,2} - P_{i,2}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c,2} - \\pi_{i,2})$$\nThe problem states that the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, is constant for this calculation. The change in net filtration pressure is $\\Delta P_{net} = P_{net,2} - P_{net,1}$.\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = \\left[ (P_{c,2} - P_{i,2}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c,2} - \\pi_{i,2}) \\right] - \\left[ (P_{c,1} - P_{i,1}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c,1} - \\pi_{i,1}) \\right]$$\nRearranging the terms to group them by variable:\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = (P_{c,2} - P_{c,1}) - (P_{i,2} - P_{i,1}) - \\sigma \\left[ (\\pi_{c,2} - \\pi_{c,1}) - (\\pi_{i,2} - \\pi_{i,1}) \\right]$$\nThis can be expressed using the delta notation for changes, where $\\Delta X = X_2 - X_1$:\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = \\Delta P_c - \\Delta P_i - \\sigma (\\Delta \\pi_c - \\Delta \\pi_i)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values provided in the problem statement into this equation. The givens are:\n- The increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure: $\\Delta P_c = +5$ mmHg.\n- The decrease in plasma oncotic pressure: $\\Delta \\pi_c = -3$ mmHg.\n- No change in interstitial hydrostatic pressure: $\\Delta P_i = 0$ mmHg.\n- No change in interstitial oncotic pressure: $\\Delta \\pi_i = 0$ mmHg.\n- The reflection coefficient is assumed to be constant: $\\sigma = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta P_{net}$:\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = (+5) - (0) - (1) \\times ((-3) - (0))$$\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = 5 - (1) \\times (-3)$$\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = 5 - (-3)$$\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = 5 + 3$$\n$$\\Delta P_{net} = 8 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe calculation shows that the change in net filtration pressure is an increase of $8$ mmHg. This positive change signifies an increased driving force for fluid to move from the capillaries into the interstitial tissue, which is consistent with the pathophysiology of edema formation in acute inflammation. The increase is due to two contributing factors: the increased hydrostatic pressure pushing fluid out ($\\Delta P_c = +5$ mmHg) and the decreased oncotic pressure pulling fluid in (which is equivalent to an additional push out, contributing $-(-3) = +3$ mmHg to the net outward pressure).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "4842913"}, {"introduction": "Following the initial inflammatory phase, the body begins the remarkable process of closing the wound through cell migration and proliferation.
