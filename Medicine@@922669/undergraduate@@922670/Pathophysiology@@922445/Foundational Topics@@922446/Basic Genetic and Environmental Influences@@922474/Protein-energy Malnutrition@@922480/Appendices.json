The provided values for weight, height, median, and standard deviation are physiologically plausible for a pediatric patient. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear definition and all necessary data for the calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to compute the Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ). The problem defines a Z-score as a measure of the deviation of an observed value from the reference median, expressed in units of the standard deviation. This definition translates directly into a standard statistical formula.\n\nLet $X$ represent the observed value, $\\mu_{ref}$ represent the reference median, and $\\sigma_{ref}$ represent the reference standard deviation. The Z-score, denoted as $Z$, is calculated as:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu_{ref}}{\\sigma_{ref}}$$\n\nIn the context of this problem, these variables correspond to the given anthropometric data for the patient's specific height of $65$ cm:\n- The observed body weight is $X = 6.0$ kg.\n- The reference median weight is $\\mu_{ref} = 7.5$ kg.\n- The reference standard deviation is $\\sigma_{ref} = 0.8$ kg.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Z-score formula to calculate the WHZ:\n$$WHZ = \\frac{6.0 - 7.5}{0.8}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the deviation of the observed weight from the median weight:\n$$X - \\mu_{ref} = 6.0 - 7.5 = -1.5 \\text{ kg}$$\nThis negative value indicates that the patient's weight is below the reference median for their height.\n\nNext, we normalize this deviation by dividing it by the standard deviation. This expresses the deviation in units of standard deviations.\n$$WHZ = \\frac{-1.5}{0.8}$$\n\nTo find the exact numerical value, we can express the fraction using integers:\n$$WHZ = \\frac{-1.5 \\times 10}{0.8 \\times 10} = \\frac{-15}{8}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact decimal value:\n$$WHZ = -1.875$$\n\nThe WHZ is a dimensionless quantity, as the units (kg) in the numerator and denominator cancel out. The result, $-1.875$, indicates that the patient's weight is $1.875$ standard deviations below the median weight for a child of the same height according to the reference standards.

In malnutrition, insulin secretion rises during refeeding, driving rapid intracellular uptake of phosphate to regenerate Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and other phosphorylated intermediates, which can precipitate hypophosphatemia. Assume the following physiologically grounded facts and definitions: conservation of mass applies to solutes, the concentration of a solute is its amount divided by its distribution volume, and clinical laboratories report “serum phosphate” by measuring elemental phosphorus as milligrams of phosphorus per deciliter. The child weighs $20$ kg, has an apparent distribution volume for serum phosphorus of $20$ L over the next $24$ hours, and experiences an intracellular uptake of $25$ mmol of phosphate during this period.
