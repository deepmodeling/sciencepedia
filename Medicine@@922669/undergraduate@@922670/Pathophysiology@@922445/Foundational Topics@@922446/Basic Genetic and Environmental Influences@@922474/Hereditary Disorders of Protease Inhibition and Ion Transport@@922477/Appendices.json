The provided information describes the pathophysiology of $\\alpha_1$-antitrypsin deficiency, using standard nomenclature ($Pi\\mathrm{MM}$, $Pi\\mathrm{ZZ}$) and established mechanisms (protein misfolding, reduced secretion of the $Z$ variant). The given values for baseline concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and fractional secretion ($f_Z = 0.15$) are physiologically reasonable approximations. The model specified—codominant expression and linear proportionality between secretion and serum concentration—is a standard and appropriate simplification for this type of calculation. The problem is complete, consistent, and solvable. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution based on the provided model. The core principle is that the steady-state serum concentration of $\\alpha_1$-antitrypsin ($A1AT$), denoted by $C$, is directly proportional to the total rate of protein secretion into the bloodstream, $S_{total}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$C = k \\cdot S_{total}$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant that incorporates factors such as plasma volume and protein clearance rate, which are assumed to be constant for all genotypes as per the problem statement.\n\nThe gene $SERPINA1$ is expressed codominantly, meaning the protein products from both alleles contribute to the total amount. For a genotype with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$, the total secretion rate is the sum of the secretion from each allele: $S_{total} = S_{A_1} + S_{A_2}$.\n\nFor the normal genotype, $Pi\\mathrm{MM}$, the individual has two $M$ alleles. Let $S_{\\mathrm{M}}$ be the secretion rate from a single $M$ allele. The total secretion rate is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{MM}} = S_{\\mathrm{M}} + S_{\\mathrm{M}} = 2S_{\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe corresponding serum concentration is given as $C_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Using our proportionality relationship:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{MM}} = k \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{MM}} = k \\cdot (2S_{\\mathrm{M}}) = 2kS_{\\mathrm{M}}$$\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$$2kS_{\\mathrm{M}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nNext, we consider the $Z$ variant allele. The problem states that its secretion is a fraction, $f_Z = 0.15$, relative to a normal $M$ allele. The secretion rate from a single $Z$ allele, $S_{\\mathrm{Z}}$, can be written as:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{Z}} = f_Z \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.15 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{M}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the serum concentration for the genotype $Pi\\mathrm{ZZ}$, denoted $C_{\\mathrm{ZZ}}$. An individual with this genotype has two $Z$ alleles. The total secretion rate is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} = S_{\\mathrm{Z}} + S_{\\mathrm{Z}} = 2S_{\\mathrm{Z}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{Z}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} = 2(f_Z \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{M}})$$\nThe serum concentration for this genotype is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} = k \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} = k \\cdot (2f_Z S_{\\mathrm{M}})$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to relate it back to the known quantities:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} = f_Z \\cdot (2kS_{\\mathrm{M}})$$\nWe previously established that $2kS_{\\mathrm{M}} = C_{\\mathrm{MM}}$.

In the sweat gland, the secretory coil produces primary sweat that is approximately isotonic to plasma in chloride ions, while the duct reabsorbs chloride via CFTR-mediated transport.

The model, which posits a proportional relationship between CFTR function and chloride reabsorption, is a standard and appropriate simplification. The provided values are physiologically plausible and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution is based on the principle of mass balance for chloride ions. The final chloride concentration in sweat, $C_f$, is the initial concentration entering the duct, $C_0$, minus the amount reabsorbed. The amount reabsorbed is a fraction, $F$, of the initial amount. Assuming the volume of sweat does not change, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$C_f = C_0 (1 - F)$$\nThe problem states that the fraction of reabsorbed chloride, $F$, is proportional to the CFTR function, $f$. For a normal duct with $f=1$, the maximal reabsorbed fraction is $F_{\\max} = 0.8$. This establishes the relationship:\n$$F(f) = F_{\\max} \\cdot f = 0.8f$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation yields the general model for the final sweat chloride concentration as a function of CFTR function $f$:\n$$C_f(f) = C_0 (1 - F_{\\max} \\cdot f) = 100 \\cdot (1 - 0.8f)$$\nWe now compute the concentrations for the given levels of CFTR function.\n\nFor $f=0.10$ (representing 10% of normal CFTR function):\n$$C_f(0.10) = 100 (1 - 0.8 \\cdot 0.10) = 100 (1 - 0.08) = 100 (0.92) = 92\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the concentration is $92.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.
