This practice explores a common scenario in clinical genetics: a Robertsonian translocation, where two chromosomes are fused. While carriers can be perfectly healthy, the altered chromosome structure complicates segregation during gamete formation, creating a risk for unbalanced offspring. This exercise will guide you through the classification of possible gametes from a carrier and the calculation of the probability of conceiving a child with a viable aneuploidy like Trisomy 21.", "problem": "A clinically normal individual is a balanced heterozygous carrier of a Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes $14$ and $21$, with constitutional karyotype $45,\\ \\mathrm{rob}(14;21)$. In meiosis I, the single derivative chromosome $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ and the single normal homologues of $14$ and $21$ form a trivalent that undergoes segregation. Use the following foundational facts and assumptions as the starting base for your derivation:\n\n- A Robertsonian translocation fuses the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes into a single chromosome with one functional centromere; the short arms are lost without phenotypic consequence.\n- In a Robertsonian translocation heterozygote, the trivalent can segregate by alternate or adjacent modes. Alternate segregation places the derivative to one pole and both normal homologues to the other. Adjacent modes place the derivative with one normal homologue to the same pole and the remaining normal homologue to the opposite pole. For the purposes of this problem, define adjacent-$1$ as the mode in which nonhomologous centromeres go to the same pole, and adjacent-$2$ as the mode in which homologous centromeres go to the same pole.\n- Assume the functional centromere of $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ is derived from chromosome $14$.\n- The carrier mates with a cytogenetically normal partner producing gametes carrying one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$.\n- Viability assumptions at the conceptus level: disomy for both $14\\mathrm{q}$ and $21\\mathrm{q}$ yields a phenotypically normal or balanced translocation conceptus; monosomy $14$, monosomy $21$, and trisomy $14$ are not viable; trisomy $21$ (Down syndrome) is viable.\n\nSuppose the trivalent segregates with the following probabilities per meiosis: $p_{\\mathrm{alt}}=0.80$ for alternate, $p_{\\mathrm{adj1}}=0.18$ for adjacent-$1$, and $p_{\\mathrm{adj2}}=0.02$ for adjacent-$2$. Within any given segregation mode, assume that the two reciprocal gamete classes produced by that mode occur with equal probability.\n\nTasks:\n\n1. Starting from the above definitions, enumerate the possible gamete chromosomal contents contributed by the carrier for each segregation mode (alternate, adjacent-$1$, adjacent-$2$) under the stated centromere assumption, using the notation $\\mathrm{N}14$ for a normal chromosome $14$, $\\mathrm{N}21$ for a normal chromosome $21$, and $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ for the derivative. For each gamete class, state the resulting zygotic $14\\mathrm{q}$ and $21\\mathrm{q}$ copy numbers after fertilization by a normal gamete and classify the zygote as balanced, monosomic, or trisomic, specifying which trisomy if present.\n2. Using your classification and the stated segregation probabilities, compute the overall probability that a randomly formed conception from this couple is a viable trisomic conceptus.

We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the meiotic products of a carrier of a Robertsonian translocation, $\\mathrm{rob}(14;21)$, and then calculating the probability of a specific type of viable conception. The carrier's karyotype is $45, \\mathrm{rob}(14;21)$, meaning they have one normal chromosome $14$ (denoted $\\mathrm{N}14$), one normal chromosome $21$ (denoted $\\mathrm{N}21$), and one derivative chromosome $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ formed by the fusion of the long arms of a chromosome $14$ and a chromosome $21$.\n\nIn meiosis I, these three chromosomes form a trivalent structure. The segregation of this trivalent determines the chromosomal content of the resulting gametes. We are given that the centromere of the derivative chromosome $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ is from chromosome $14$. Therefore, the centromeres involved in the trivalent are: one from $\\mathrm{N}14$, one from $\\mathrm{N}21$, and one from $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ which is functionally a chromosome $14$ centromere. The homologous centromeres are those of $\\mathrm{N}14$ and $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$. The centromere of $\\mathrm{N}21$ is nonhomologous to the other two.\n\nBased on the problem's definitions, we can determine the chromosomal segregation for each mode:\n- **Alternate segregation**: The derivative chromosome goes to one pole, and the two normal homologues go to the other. Segregation is $\\{\\mathrm{der}(14;21)\\}$ vs. $\\{\\mathrm{N}14, \\mathrm{N}21\\}$.\n- **Adjacent-1 segregation**: Nonhomologous centromeres go to the same pole. In an adjacent mode, the derivative chromosome segregates with one of the normal homologues. For the centromeres of $\\{\\mathrm{der}(14;21), \\mathrm{N}21\\}$ to co-segregate, a chromosome $14$ centromere and a chromosome $21$ centromere move to the same pole. This fits the definition. Segregation is $\\{\\mathrm{der}(14;21), \\mathrm{N}21\\}$ vs. $\\{\\mathrm{N}14\\}$.\n- **Adjacent-2 segregation**: Homologous centromeres go to the same pole. The homologous centromeres are on $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ and $\\mathrm{N}14$. Segregation is $\\{\\mathrm{der}(14;21), \\mathrm{N}14\\}$ vs. $\\{\\mathrm{N}21\\}$.\n\nFertilization of each possible gamete from the carrier is by a normal gamete from the partner, which contains $\\{\\mathrm{N}14, \\mathrm{N}21\\}$.\n\n### Task 1: Enumeration of Gametes and Zygotic Outcomes\n\n**1.

We must examine the classifications from Task 1 to identify outcomes that are both \"viable\" and \"trisomic\".\n\nBased on the provided viability assumptions:\n- Trisomy $14$ is not viable.\n- Trisomy $21$ is viable.\n\nFrom our analysis, only one type of conception fits the description:\n- The zygote classified as \"Trisomy 21, viable\".\n\nThis outcome results from the fertilization of a Gamete Class 3, with content $\\{\\mathrm{der}(14;21), \\mathrm{N}21\\}$. This gamete is produced by adjacent-1 segregation. The probability of forming this specific gamete is half the probability of the adjacent-1 segregation mode occurring.\n\nLet $P(\\text{VTS})$ be the probability of a viable trisomic conceptus.\n$$ P(\\text{VTS}) = P(\\text{Gamete Class 3}) $$\n$$ P(\\text{Gamete Class 3}) = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{adj1}}}{2} $$\nSubstituting the given value for $p_{\\mathrm{adj1}}$:\n$$ P(\\text{VTS}) = \\frac{0.18}{2} = 0.09 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.09$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.0900$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0900}\n$$", "id": "4806652"}, {"introduction": "Moving from large-scale chromosomal changes to single-gene mutations, we encounter different kinds of clinical puzzles. A common challenge arises when a child is born with an autosomal dominant disorder, yet both parents are unaffected, suggesting a new or *de novo* mutation. This practice delves into the important concept of germline mosaicism, where a parent carries the mutation in a fraction of their reproductive cells. You will learn to deconstruct and quantify the recurrence risk by systematically combining the probabilities of mosaicism, successful transmission, and incomplete penetrance.", "problem": "A couple has a first child with a heterozygous pathogenic variant at a single autosomal locus that causes an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder with incomplete penetrance. Both parents have negative findings for the variant in peripheral blood. Targeted sequencing of the father's semen detects germline mosaicism: an estimated fraction $f = 0.032$ of his gametes carry the pathogenic variant. Epidemiologic data for this variant indicate that, conditional on a paternal gamete carrying the variant, the probability that the variant is transmitted into a live-born offspring's genotype (accounting for preimplantation and prenatal selection against the mutant genotype) is $p_t = 0.86$. The penetrance in heterozygotes is $\\pi = 0.75$.\n\nUsing only core definitions of Mendelian inheritance, germline mosaicism, transmission, and penetrance, derive from first principles the recurrence risk for the couple's next live-born child being affected with the disorder. Express the final risk as a single decimal fraction. Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the recurrence risk for an autosomal dominant disorder in a family where the father exhibits germline mosaicism. The recurrence risk, denoted by $R$, is the probability that the couple's next live-born child will be clinically affected by the disorder. This calculation must be derived from first principles.\n\nThe overall risk is a compound probability based on a sequence of independent events. A child can only be affected if two conditions are met: first, the child must inherit the pathogenic genotype, and second, the genotype must lead to the expression of the clinical phenotype.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the next live-born child is affected by the disorder.\nLet $G$ be the event that the next live-born child has the pathogenic genotype (i.e., is a heterozygote for the variant, as the disorder is dominant).\n\nThe recurrence risk $R$ is the probability of event $A$, denoted $P(A)$. Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(A)$ in terms of the event $G$:\n$$R = P(A) = P(A|G) \\times P(G) + P(A|G^c) \\times P(G^c)$$\nwhere $G^c$ denotes the event that the child does not have the pathogenic genotype.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the disorder is caused by the pathogenic variant. Therefore, an individual without the variant cannot be affected. This implies that the probability of being affected, given the absence of the pathogenic genotype, is zero: $P(A|G^c) = 0$.\n\nThe conditional probability $P(A|G)$ is the penetrance of the disorder. Penetrance is defined as the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant who also express the associated phenotype. The problem provides this value as $\\pi$:\n$$\\pi = P(A|G) = 0.75$$\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $R$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$R = \\pi \\times P(G) + 0 \\times P(G^c) = \\pi \\times P(G)$$\n\nThe subsequent task is to determine $P(G)$, the probability that a live-born child inherits the pathogenic variant. An offspring inherits one allele at any given autosomal locus from each parent.\n\nWe first consider the maternal contribution. The problem states that the mother tested negative for the variant in her peripheral blood. In the absence of evidence for maternal germline mosaicism, the standard assumption in genetic counseling is that her germline is also free of the variant. Therefore, the probability that she transmits the pathogenic allele to her child is $0$.\n\nWe next consider the paternal contribution. The father also tested negative in his peripheral blood, but targeted sequencing of his semen confirmed germline mosaicism. This indicates that a fraction of his germ cells carry the pathogenic variant. The problem provides the necessary parameters:\n1. The fraction of the father's gametes (sperm) that carry the pathogenic variant is $f = 0.032$. This is the probability that a randomly-selected paternal gamete carries the variant.\n2. The conditional probability that a variant-carrying paternal gamete results in a live-born offspring with the variant is $p_t = 0.86$. This value accounts for all factors affecting transmission post-meiosis, including fertilization success and any selective pressures against the embryo during gestation that would prevent a live birth.\n\nThe probability of a live-born child inheriting the pathogenic allele from the father is the product of the probability of producing a variant-carrying gamete and the probability of that gamete leading to a live birth.\n$$P(\\text{Inheritance from father}) = f \\times p_t$$\nSince the probability of inheritance from the mother is $0$, the total probability of the child having the pathogenic genotype, $P(G)$, is determined solely by the paternal contribution:\n$$P(G) = P(\\text{Inheritance from father}) + P(\\text{Inheritance from mother})$$\n$$P(G) = (f \\times p_t) + 0 = f \\times p_t$$\n\nWe now substitute this expression for $P(G)$ into our equation for the overall recurrence risk, $R$:\n$$R = \\pi \\times (f \\times p_t)$$\n\nUsing the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- Penetrance, $\\pi = 0.75$\n- Father's germline mosaicism fraction, $f = 0.032$\n- Transmission probability, $p_t = 0.86$\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for the risk $R$:\n$$R = 0.75 \\times (0.032 \\times 0.86)$$\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the child inheriting the pathogenic genotype from the father:\n$$P(G) = 0.032 \\times 0.86 = 0.02752$$\nNext, we incorporate the penetrance to find the probability of the child being clinically affected:\n$$R = 0.75 \\times 0.02752 = 0.02064$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

This is particularly evident in autosomal recessive conditions, where consanguinity significantly increases risk by raising the chance that a child inherits two copies of a rare pathogenic allele from a single common ancestor. This practice applies the inbreeding coefficient, $F$, to modify classical Hardy-Weinberg predictions, allowing you to precisely calculate the heightened disease risk for the offspring of first cousins.", "problem": "A large, panmictic population is in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), with autosomal alleles $A$ (normal) and $a$ (disease) at a single locus.

The complementary event, that the two alleles are not identical by descent, has a probability of $1-F$.\n\nWe can find the total probability of the child having the genotype $aa$ by considering these two mutually exclusive events, using the law of total probability:\n$P(\\text{genotype is } aa) = P(\\text{genotype is } aa \\mid \\text{alleles are IBD}) \\cdot P(\\text{alleles are IBD}) + P(\\text{genotype is } aa \\mid \\text{alleles are not IBD}) \\cdot P(\\text{alleles are not IBD})$\n\nLet's analyze each term in this expression.\n\n1.  **Case 1: The two alleles in the child are identical by descent (IBD).**\n    The probability of this event is given by the inbreeding coefficient, $F$.\n    $$P(\\text{alleles are IBD}) = F$$\n    If the two alleles are IBD, they are exact copies of a single ancestral allele.
