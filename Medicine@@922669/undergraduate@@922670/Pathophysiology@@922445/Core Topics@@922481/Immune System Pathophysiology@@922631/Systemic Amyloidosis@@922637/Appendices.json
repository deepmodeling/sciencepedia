This exercise introduces the concept of the difference Free Light Chain ($dFLC$), a critical biomarker that measures the burden of the amyloidogenic protein produced by a clonal plasma cell population. By calculating the $dFLC$, you will practice a fundamental skill used in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment monitoring of AL amyloidosis.

Bone marrow and tissue proteomics demonstrate a clonal kappa light chain, establishing that the involved light chain is $\\kappa$ and the uninvolved light chain is $\\lambda$. In systemic AL amyloidosis, the difference free light chain (dFLC) is a quantification used in risk stratification and response assessment; it is defined as the numerical difference between the involved and the uninvolved free light chain concentrations, reflecting excess monoclonal production.\n\nStarting from the core immunopathological principles that clonal plasma cells produce a single immunoglobulin light chain type, leading to elevation of the involved free light chain and suppression or relative reduction of the uninvolved light chain, and using the operational definition above, compute the value of $dFLC$ for this patient. Then, evaluate whether the patient meets a high-burden threshold by defining an indicator $J$ such that $J=1$ if $dFLC \\ge 180$ mg/L and $J=0$ otherwise.\n\nReport your final result as a row matrix containing two entries, $\\left(dFLC, J\\right)$.

It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe fundamental principle in this problem is the pathophysiology of a monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia, such as Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. In this condition, a clonal population of plasma cells proliferates and produces a single type of immunoglobulin light chain (either kappa, $\\kappa$, or lambda, $\\lambda$) in excess. This specific light chain is termed the \"involved\" free light chain ($C_{involved}$), while the other, produced by normal polyclonal plasma cells, is the \"uninvolved\" free light chain ($C_{uninvolved}$). The production of the uninvolved light chain is typically suppressed.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we are given the following serum free light chain concentrations:\n- Free kappa light chain concentration, $\\kappa = 120 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n- Free lambda light chain concentration, $\\lambda = 10 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the clonal light chain is of the kappa type. Therefore, we can assign the involved and uninvolved concentrations as follows:\n- Involved free light chain concentration: $C_{involved} = \\kappa = 120 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n- Uninvolved free light chain concentration: $C_{uninvolved} = \\lambda = 10 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n\nThe problem defines the difference free light chain ($dFLC$) as the numerical difference between the involved and the uninvolved free light chain concentrations. We compute this value:\n$$dFLC = C_{involved} - C_{uninvolved}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$dFLC = 120 \\, \\text{mg/L} - 10 \\, \\text{mg/L} = 110 \\, \\text{mg/L}$$\n\nNext, we must evaluate the indicator variable $J$, which is defined based on a threshold for $dFLC$. The definition is:\n- $J=1$ if $dFLC \\ge 180 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n- $J=0$ if $dFLC < 180 \\, \\text{mg/L}$.\n\nWe compare our calculated value of $dFLC$ to the threshold of $180 \\, \\text{mg/L}$:\n$$110 \\, \\text{mg/L} < 180 \\, \\text{mg/L}$$\nSince the condition $dFLC < 180 \\, \\text{mg/L}$ is met, the value of the indicator $J$ is $0$.\n\nThe final result is to be reported as a row matrix containing the two computed values, $(dFLC, J)$.\nThus, the final result is $(110, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 110 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4901448"}, {"introduction": "Once AL amyloidosis is diagnosed, determining the patient's prognosis is a critical next step that guides treatment decisions.
