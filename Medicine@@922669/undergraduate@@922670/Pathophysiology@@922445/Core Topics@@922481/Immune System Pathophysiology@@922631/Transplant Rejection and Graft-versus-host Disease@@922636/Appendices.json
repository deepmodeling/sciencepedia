In transplant immunology, the breadth of sensitization to alloantigens is quantified to estimate the risk of antibody-mediated rejection and the likelihood of finding a compatible donor. Consider the following empirical observations and population data:\n\n1. A serum reactivity test is performed against a representative lymphocyte panel of size $N = 60$ donors. The recipient’s serum produces cytotoxic or flow-based positivity against $k = 36$ distinct panel members.\n2. Independent single-antigen bead testing identifies three clinically significant unacceptable antigens: HLA-A2, HLA-B8, and HLA-DR3.

Assume antigens reside on distinct loci and that locus expression across donors is independent at the population level.

The concepts of Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA), Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA), unacceptable antigens, and phenotype frequencies are core to the field. The probabilistic approach described is the standard methodology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data ($N$, $k$, and the frequencies $f$ for all unacceptable antigens) and a clear set of assumptions (independence of antigen expression) to calculate the requested values. The question is unambiguous and leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the definition and calculation of two key metrics in transplant immunology: Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) and Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA).\n\n**1. Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA)**\nThe PRA is an empirical measure of sensitization. As stated in the foundational bases, it is the \"observed relative frequency of reactivity in a panel.\" It is calculated as the percentage of donors from a representative panel whose cells react with the recipient's serum.\n\nGiven:\n- Panel size, $N = 60$.\n- Number of reactive panel members, $k = 36$.\n\nThe PRA is calculated using the relative frequency formula:\n$$\n\\text{PRA} = \\frac{k}{N} \\times 100\\%\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PRA} = \\frac{36}{60} \\times 100\\% = 0.6 \\times 100\\% = 60\\%\n$$\nThe PRA is $60\\%$. This value represents the historical, lab-based estimate of the recipient's sensitization.\n\n**2. Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA)**\nThe cPRA is a more modern and precise estimate of sensitization. Instead of relying on a small, physical panel of donors, it uses a list of the recipient's specific \"unacceptable antigens\" (those to which the recipient has preformed antibodies) and the frequencies of these antigens in a large, virtual donor population. The cPRA represents the calculated probability that a randomly selected donor from this population will be incompatible.\n\nA donor is incompatible if they express *at least one* of the unacceptable antigens (HLA-A2, HLA-B8, or HLA-DR3). The probability of this event, $P(\\text{incompatible})$, is $P(\\text{A2} \\cup \\text{B8} \\cup \\text{DR3})$.\n\nGiven the assumption of independence, it is most straightforward to calculate the probability of the complementary event: a donor being compatible. A donor is compatible if and only if they express *none* of the unacceptable antigens.\n$$\nP(\\text{compatible}) = P(\\text{not A2} \\cap \\text{not B8} \\cap \\text{not DR3})\n$$\nDue to independence, this is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{compatible}) = P(\\text{not A2}) \\times P(\\text{not B8}) \\times P(\\text{not DR3})\n$$\nThe probabilities of not expressing an antigen are the complements of their phenotype frequencies:\n- $P(\\text{not A2}) = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{A2}} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n- $P(\\text{not B8}) = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{B8}} = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n- $P(\\text{not DR3}) = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{DR3}} = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of compatibility:\n$$\nP(\\text{compatible}) = (0.75) \\times (0.90) \\times (0.88) = 0.675 \\times 0.88 = 0.594\n$$\nThe cPRA is the probability of incompatibility, which is the complement of compatibility:\n$$\n\\text{cPRA} = P(\\text{incompatible}) = 1 - P(\\text{compatible})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{cPRA} = 1 - 0.594 = 0.406\n$$\nExpressed as a percentage, the cPRA is $40.6\\%$.\n\n**Summary of Correct Values and Definitions:**\n- **PRA**: The percentage of a physical donor panel that is reactive to the recipient's serum. Calculated as $60\\%$.\n- **cPRA**: The calculated percentage of donors in a population who are predicted to be incompatible based on the frequencies of the recipient's specific unacceptable antigens. Calculated as $40.6\\%$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. PRA is the percentage of a representative donor panel that reacts with the recipient’s serum; cPRA is the estimated percentage of donors in the population that would be incompatible based on unacceptable antigen frequencies. For this recipient, $PRA = \\dfrac{36}{60} \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$, and $cPRA = 1 - (1 - 0.25)(1 - 0.10)(1 - 0.12) = 40.6\\%$.**\n- **Definitions:** The definitions for both PRA and cPRA are correct and align with standard immunological terminology and the derivation above.\n- **Calculations:** The calculation for PRA is $\\frac{36}{60} = 0.6$, or $60\\%$, which is correct. The calculation for cPRA is $1 - (0.75)(0.90)(0.88) = 1 - 0.594 = 0.406$, or $40.6\\%$, which is also correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. PRA is the percentage of unacceptable antigens present in the donor pool; cPRA is the percentage of donors expected to be compatible (the complement of incompatibility). For this recipient, $PRA = 60\\%$, and $cPRA = (1 - 0.25)(1 - 0.10)(1 - 0.12) = 59.4\\%$.**\n- **Definitions:** The definition of PRA is incorrect; it is a measure of reactivity to a panel of *donors*, not a percentage of *antigens*. The definition of cPRA is also incorrect; cPRA measures the percentage of *incompatible* donors, not *compatible* donors.\n- **Calculations:** The value for PRA is coincidentally correct ($60\\%$), but it is not derived from the flawed definition. The value calculated for cPRA ($59.4\\%$) is the compatibility rate, not the cPRA.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. PRA is determined solely by the number of unacceptable antigens detected; cPRA is the sum of the independent frequencies of each unacceptable antigen. For this recipient, $PRA = 3/60 \\times 100\\% = 5\\%$, and $cPRA = 0.25 + 0.10 + 0.12 = 47\\%$.**\n- **Definitions:** The definition of PRA is incorrect. Dividing the number of unacceptable antigens ($3$) by the panel size ($60$) is nonsensical. The definition of cPRA is also incorrect. Simply summing the frequencies ($f_{\\mathrm{A2}} + f_{\\mathrm{B8}} + f_{\\mathrm{DR3}}$) fails to account for donors who express more than one of the unacceptable antigens, thus violating the principle of inclusion-exclusion and overestimating the true incompatibility rate.\n- **Calculations:** Both the PRA and cPRA calculations are fundamentally flawed and yield incorrect results.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. PRA is the mean fluorescence intensity of the strongest antibody response converted to a percentage; cPRA is the largest single antigen frequency in the population. For this recipient, $PRA = 60\\%$, and $cPRA = 25\\%$.**\n- **Definitions:** The definition of PRA is incorrect. Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) measures the strength of an antibody-antigen reaction, not the breadth of sensitization (PRA). The definition of cPRA is incorrect; it must account for all unacceptable antigens, not just the one with the highest frequency.\n- **Calculations:** The value for PRA is coincidentally correct ($60\\%$), but it is unrelated to the fallacious definition. The cPRA value of $25\\%$ incorrectly considers only the most frequent antigen ($f_{\\mathrm{A2}} = 0.25$).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4843769"}, {"introduction": "When a potential organ donor is identified, the general risk assessment must be refined to a specific, donor-recipient compatibility check.

A virtual crossmatch is positive if IgG DSAs are present.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on the principles of transplant immunology. It uses standard laboratory tests (single-antigen bead assay, C1q/C3d assays), correct terminology (HLA, DSA, MFI), and established concepts of antibody-mediated rejection. The data patterns, including the C1q-negative but C3d-positive result for one antibody, reflect real-world clinical complexities and are scientifically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (recipient antibody specificities and strengths, donor HLA typing, and interpretation thresholds) to perform the requested task of a virtual crossmatch and risk assessment. The question is specific and allows for a unique, stable conclusion based on the provided data and principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem is objective, relying on quantitative data (MFI values) and qualitative, but standardized, laboratory results (positive/negative for C1q/C3d). The language is precise and avoids subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe virtual crossmatch (vXM) is performed by comparing the recipient's anti-HLA IgG antibody profile against the donor's HLA antigens to identify any donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). A DSA is defined as an IgG antibody present in the recipient that is directed against an HLA antigen expressed by the donor, with an MFI meeting the laboratory's threshold for positivity (MFI $\\geq 1000$).\n\n1.  **Identification of Donor-Specific Antibodies (DSAs):**\n\n    - **HLA-A Locus:** The donor is typed as A\\*02:01 and A\\*24:02.\n        - The recipient has anti-A\\*02:01 antibodies with MFI $2800$. Since $2800 \\geq 1000$, this is a **Class I DSA**.\n        - The recipient has anti-A\\*24:02 antibodies with MFI $600$. Since $600 < 1000$, this is below the threshold and not considered a positive DSA for vXM purposes.\n\n    - **HLA-B Locus:** The donor is typed as B\\*08:01 and B\\*07:02.\n        - The recipient has anti-B\\*08:01 antibodies with MFI $9000$. Since $9000 \\geq 1000$, this is a **Class I DSA**.\n        - The recipient has anti-B\\*07:02 antibodies of the IgM isotype only. As stated, IgM antibodies are not considered in standard vXM risk prediction for AMR. Therefore, there is no IgG DSA against B\\*07:02.\n\n    - **HLA-C Locus:** The donor is typed as C\\*07:01 and C\\*07:02.\n        - The recipient has anti-C\\*07 (broad) antibodies with MFI $1500$. This antibody will recognize both C\\*07:01 and C\\*07:02 antigens on the donor kidney. Since $1500 \\geq 1000$, this is a **Class I DSA**.\n\n    - **HLA-DRB1 Locus (Class II):** The donor is typed as DRB1\\*03:01 and DRB1\\*15:01.\n        - The recipient has anti-DRB1\\*03:01 antibodies with MFI $4000$. Since $4000 \\geq 1000$, this is a **Class II DSA**.\n\n    - **HLA-DQB1 Locus (Class II):** The donor is typed as DQB1\\*02:01 and DQB1\\*06:02.\n        - The recipient has anti-DQB1\\*02:01 antibodies with MFI $2200$. Since $2200 \\geq 1000$, this is a **Class II DSA**.\n\n2.  **Virtual Crossmatch (vXM) Result:**\n    Since multiple IgG DSAs are identified (against A\\*02:01, B\\*08:01, C\\*07, DRB1\\*03:01, and DQB1\\*02:01), the virtual crossmatch is unequivocally **positive**.\n\n3.  **Rejection Risk Profile Assessment:**\n    The risk is stratified based on the strength (MFI) and pathogenic potential (complement-binding activity) of the identified DSAs.\n\n    - **Anti-HLA-B\\*08:01 DSA:** This is the most critical antibody. It has a very high MFI of $9000$ and is positive for both C1q and C3d binding. C1q is the initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway. A C1q-binding DSA is a very strong predictor of severe, early, complement-mediated antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The presence of this single DSA places the recipient at extremely high risk.\n\n    - **Other Class I DSAs:**\n        - Anti-A\\*02:01 (MFI $2800$) and anti-C\\*07 (MFI $1500$) are also present. Although they are not C1q-binding in this assay, their presence contributes to the overall burden of anti-donor immunity.\n\n    - **Class II DSAs:**\n        - Anti-DRB1\\*03:01 (MFI $4000$) is C3d-positive, even though it is C1q-negative. This suggests it can activate complement, possibly through a pathway that is less reliant on high-avidity IgG clustering (required for robust C1q binding) or via the lectin pathway, but still results in downstream C3d deposition. This DSA contributes to the risk of AMR.\n        - Anti-DQB1\\*02:01 (MFI $2200$) is non-complement-binding in these assays. Class II DSAs, in general, are more strongly associated with chronic AMR and transplant glomerulopathy, but can also contribute to acute AMR.\n\n    - **Synthesis:** The dominant factor for immediate risk is the high-titer, C1q-binding Class I DSA against HLA-B\\*08:01. This portends a very high likelihood of early and severe AMR, characterized by complement-mediated endothelial injury. Proceeding with transplantation without specific intervention (such as desensitization or antibody removal therapies like plasmapheresis) would be considered extremely unsafe and contraindicated by most transplant centers.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Virtual crossmatch negative; low risk of rejection because only class II DSAs are present and they are non-complement-binding.**\n  - This statement is incorrect. The virtual crossmatch is positive. Both Class I and Class II DSAs are present. A key Class I DSA (anti-B\\*08:01) is strongly complement-binding. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. Virtual crossmatch positive due to a strong, complement-binding class I DSA (anti-HLA-B*08:01); high risk of early antibody-mediated rejection driven by complement-mediated endothelial injury, making proceeding without desensitization unsafe.**\n  - This statement accurately reflects the analysis. The vXM is positive. The primary driver of risk is the strong (MFI $9000$), complement-binding (C1q+) anti-B\\*08:01 DSA. This creates a high risk of early, complement-driven AMR, making the procedure unsafe without intervention. **Correct**.\n\n- **C. Virtual crossmatch positive but moderate risk because DSAs are limited to non-complement-binding class I antibodies; risk predominantly cell-mediated rather than humoral.**\n  - This statement is incorrect. The risk is high, not moderate. The DSAs are not limited to non-complement-binding antibodies; the most potent DSA is complement-binding. Class II DSAs are also present. The predicted risk is predominantly humoral (antibody-mediated), not cell-mediated, due to the DSA profile. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Virtual crossmatch indeterminate due to presence of IgM anti-HLA-B*07:02 and low-level anti-HLA-A*24:02, preventing meaningful risk assessment.**\n  - This statement is incorrect. The vXM is clearly positive based on multiple significant IgG DSAs. Standard protocols explicitly exclude IgM and sub-threshold IgG antibodies from the primary vXM determination. A meaningful and severe risk assessment is possible. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. Virtual crossmatch positive; risk mainly chronic due to DR and DQ antibodies, with early rejection unlikely because class I antibodies are below clinically significant levels.**\n  - This statement is incorrect. While Class II DSAs contribute to risk (often chronic), the assertion that early rejection is unlikely is false. The anti-B\\*08:01 Class I antibody, with an MFI of $9000$ and C1q-binding capacity, is far above any clinically significant threshold and poses a major risk for early, acute AMR. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4843719"}, {"introduction": "Even with careful matching, the threat of rejection remains a central concern after transplantation.

T cell–mediated rejection Grade III", "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Patient context**: Day $45$ post-deceased-donor kidney transplant.\n- **Clinical finding**: Rise in serum creatinine from $1.4$ to $2.6$ mg/dL.\n- **Biopsy Histology (H&E stain)**:\n    - Mononuclear interstitial inflammation involving approximately $40\\%$ of the cortical parenchyma.\n    - Several non-atrophic tubules with focal intraepithelial lymphocytes averaging $7$ lymphocytes per tubular cross-section.\n    - No fibrinoid change, no transmural arterial inflammation, no arterial endothelial lifting.\n    - Intact arterial intima without luminal compromise on elastic stains.\n- **Immunohistochemistry**: Complement component 4d (C4d) in peritubular capillaries is negative.\n- **Molecular Diagnostics (RNA-seq)**:\n    - Upregulation of cytotoxic T cell–associated transcripts (granzyme B, perforin, interferon gamma) with fold change $>3$.\n    - Enrichment of T cell receptor signaling pathway.\n    - No significant B cell or plasma cell transcriptional signatures.\n- **Provided Banff Lesion Scores**:\n    - Interstitial inflammation score: $i=2$.\n    - Tubulitis score: $t=2$.\n    - Intimal arteritis score: $v=0$.\n- **Question**: To determine the T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) grade based on the provided information and scores, according to the Banff classification framework.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly grounded in the field of transplant pathology. The clinical presentation, diagnostic workup (biopsy, histology, IHC, RNA-seq), and the use of the Banff classification for allograft rejection are standard and represent the current state of medical science in this domain.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides specific, quantitative pathological findings and translates them into the standardized Banff lesion scores ($i$, $t$, $v$). The question asks for the application of a well-defined classification system (Banff) to these scores, which leads to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The description is entirely objective, using established pathological terminology and quantitative data (e.g., \"$40\\%$\", \"$7$ lymphocytes\", \"$i=2, t=2, v=0$\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Consistency Check**:\n    - The given score $i=2$ corresponds to inflammation in $26-50\\%$ of the cortex. The finding of \"approximately $40\\%$\" is consistent with this score.\n    - The given score $t=2$ corresponds to $5-10$ mononuclear cells per tubular cross-section. The finding of \"averaging $7$ lymphocytes per tubular cross-section\" is consistent with this score.\n    - The given score $v=0$ corresponds to the absence of intimal arteritis. The description of \"no transmural arterial inflammation, and no arterial endothelial lifting... intact arterial intima\" is consistent with this score.\n- The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution can be derived by applying the principles of the Banff classification for T cell-mediated rejection.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe classification of T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) in a kidney allograft is determined by the Banff classification system, which primarily uses three lesion scores: interstitial inflammation ($i$), tubulitis ($t$), and intimal arteritis ($v$). The rejection is graded based on the severity and combination of these lesions.\n\nThe provided lesion scores are:\n- $i=2$\n- $t=2$\n- $v=0$\n\nLet us review the Banff diagnostic categories for TCMR based on these scores:\n\n1.  **Vascular Rejection (Grades II and III)**: These grades are defined by the presence of intimal arteritis ($v > 0$).\n    - Grade IIA: Mild-to-moderate intimal arteritis ($v=1$).\n    - Grade IIB: Severe intimal arteritis ($v=2$).\n    - Grade III: Transmural arteritis or arterial fibrinoid necrosis ($v=3$).\n    Since the provided score is $v=0$, all vascular rejection grades (II and III) are excluded.\n\n2.  **Tubulointerstitial Rejection (Grades IA and IB)**: These grades are defined by significant interstitial inflammation and tubulitis in the absence of arteritis ($v=0$).\n    - **Grade IA**: Requires significant interstitial inflammation ($i \\ge 2$) AND moderate tubulitis ($t=2$).\n    - **Grade IB**: Requires significant interstitial inflammation ($i \\ge 2$) AND severe tubulitis ($t=3$).\n    The provided scores are $i=2$ and $t=2$. This combination precisely matches the criteria for **Grade IA TCMR**. The inflammation affects more than $25\\%$ of the cortex and there is moderate tubulitis. It does not meet the criteria for Grade IB, as that would require $t=3$.\n\n3.  **Borderline changes suspicious for TCMR**: This category is used when there is tubulointerstitial inflammation, but it does not meet the full criteria for definite Grade I TCMR. This typically involves cases with $i \\geq 1$ and $t \\geq 1$, but where the combination does not reach the threshold of $i \\geq 2$ and $t \\geq 2$. For example, a biopsy with scores of $i=2$, $t=1$ or $i=1$, $t=2$ would be classified as borderline. Since the biopsy in this problem has scores of $i=2$ and $t=2$, it surpasses the borderline category and meets the criteria for definitive rejection.\n\n4.  **Ancillary Information**: The negative C4d stain and the lack of B cell/plasma cell signatures on RNA-seq argue against concurrent antibody-mediated rejection. The strong upregulation of T cell-associated transcripts on RNA-seq provides molecular evidence that corroborates the histological diagnosis of an active T cell-mediated process, strengthening the confidence in the TCMR diagnosis over borderline changes.\n\nBased on the direct application of the Banff 2019/2022 criteria to the given scores $i=2$, $t=2$, and $v=0$, the correct classification is T cell–mediated rejection, Grade IA.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Borderline changes suspicious for T cell–mediated rejection**\nThis classification is for inflammatory changes that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for definite TCMR Grade I. The given scores of $i=2$ and $t=2$ meet the specific threshold for Grade IA. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. T cell–mediated rejection Grade IA**\nThe criteria for TCMR Grade IA are interstitial inflammation affecting $>25\\%$ of the cortex ($i \\ge 2$) and moderate tubulitis ($t=2$), in the absence of arteritis ($v=0$). The provided scores ($i=2$, $t=2$, $v=0$) exactly match these criteria.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. T cell–mediated rejection Grade IB**\nThe criteria for TCMR Grade IB are interstitial inflammation affecting $>25\\%$ of the cortex ($i \\ge 2$) and severe tubulitis ($t=3$). The patient’s tubulitis score is $t=2$, which is not severe enough for this grade.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. T cell–mediated rejection Grade II**\nThis grade requires the presence of intimal arteritis ($v=1$ or $v=2$). The problem states that the intimal arteritis score is $v=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. T cell–mediated rejection Grade III**\nThis grade requires severe vascular inflammation, such as transmural arteritis or fibrinoid necrosis ($v=3$). The problem states that the intimal arteritis score is $v=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4843875"}]}
