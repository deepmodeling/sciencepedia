The complement system, its pathways (classical, alternative, terminal), and its components ($C1q$, $C2$, $C3$, etc.) are well-established concepts. The CH50 and AH50 assays are standard functional tests used to evaluate the complement system. The clinical presentation is a classic triad for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), which has a known strong association with deficiencies in the early components of the classical complement pathway.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The provided laboratory data (CH50, AH50, $C3$ level) and clinical information are sufficient and consistent, allowing for a logical deduction of the location of the defect within the complement cascade. A specific set of possible deficiencies can be uniquely identified.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective and precise medical and scientific terminology. The data are quantitative and accompanied by standard reference ranges. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question that can be answered through logical deduction based on foundational principles of immunology. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe complement system is a critical part of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of plasma proteins that can be activated by three primary pathways: the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. The problem provides data to assess the classical and alternative pathways.\n\n### Core Principles of Complement Pathways and Assays\n\n1.  **Classical Pathway**: This pathway is typically initiated by the binding of the $C1$ complex ($C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$) to the Fc portion of antigen-bound IgM or IgG antibodies. The activated $C1$ complex then cleaves $C4$ and $C2$ to form the classical pathway $C3$ convertase, $C4b2a$. This enzyme cleaves $C3$ into $C3a$ and $C3b$.\n2.  **Alternative Pathway**: This pathway is part of the innate immune system and is continuously active at a low level through spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ (\"tick-over\"). It can be amplified on the surface of pathogens. It involves Factor B and Factor D, which, along with $C3b$, form the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$. This enzyme is stabilized by properdin.\n3.  **Common Terminal Pathway**: Both the classical and alternative pathways converge at the cleavage of $C3$. The subsequent steps involve the formation of a $C5$ convertase, which cleaves $C5$. This initiates the assembly of the terminal components $C5b$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, and $C9$ into the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which lyses target cells.\n4.  **CH50 Assay**: The CH50 assay measures the functional integrity of the **entire classical pathway**, including the common terminal pathway components ($C1, C4, C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9$). It uses antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes, which specifically trigger the classical pathway. A zero or near-zero CH50 value implies a functional deficiency of at least one of these components.\n5.  **AH50 Assay**: The AH50 assay measures the functional integrity of the **alternative pathway** and the **common terminal pathway** ($C3$, Factor B, Factor D, properdin, $C5, C6, C7, C8, C9$). It uses rabbit erythrocytes, which activate the alternative pathway. A normal AH50 value implies that all components of the alternative and terminal pathways are present and functional.\n\n### Analysis of the Patient's Results\n\n1.  **CH50 $= 0$ $\\mathrm{U/mL}$ (undetectable)**: This result indicates a complete absence of function in the classical pathway or the common terminal pathway. This points to a homozygous deficiency of one of the following components: $C1$ (including its subcomponents $C1q, C1r, C1s$), $C4$, $C2$, $C3$, $C5$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, or $C9$.\n2.  **AH50 $= 105$ $\\mathrm{U/mL}$ (normal)**: This result indicates that the alternative pathway and the common terminal pathway are fully functional. This means that Factor B, Factor D, properdin, $C3$, $C5$, $C6$, $C7$, $C8$, and $C9$ are all present in sufficient quantities and are functional.\n3.  **Serum $C3 = 120$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ (normal)**: This measurement of $C3$ protein concentration confirms that $C3$ is not deficient, which is consistent with the normal AH50 result as $C3$ is essential for that pathway.\n4.  **Synthesis**: We have a conflict if we assume the defect is in the common terminal pathway. The CH50 result suggests the defect *could* be in the terminal pathway ($C3, C5-C9$), but the normal AH50 result proves that these components *are functional*. Therefore, the components of the alternative and terminal pathways ($C3, C5-C9$, properdin, etc.) are intact. The defect must be in a component required **only** for the classical pathway and which acts **upstream** of the common pathway. The components that are unique to the classical pathway are $C1$, $C4$, and $C2$. A deficiency in any of these three components would lead to a failure to form the classical $C3$ convertase ($C4b2a$), resulting in a CH50 of $0$, while leaving the alternative pathway (and thus AH50) completely intact.\n\nThe clinical presentation (malar rash, photosensitivity, arthralgia, anti-nuclear antibodies) is highly characteristic of an SLE-like autoimmune disease. Deficiencies of the early classical pathway components ($C1q$, $C4$, $C2$) are the strongest known genetic risk factors for developing SLE due to impaired clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. The absence of recurrent *Neisseria* infections further argues against a deficiency in the terminal components ($C5-C9$), which are crucial for defense against these encapsulated bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the laboratory pattern (CH50 $= 0$, normal AH50, normal $C3$) is pathognomonic for a deficiency in one of the early components of the classical pathway: $C1$, $C4$, or $C2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Deficiency of $C1q$**\n$C1q$ is part of the $C1$ complex that initiates the classical pathway. A deficiency of $C1q$ would completely abrogate the classical pathway, leading to a CH50 of $0$. It is not involved in the alternative pathway, so the AH50 would be normal. This perfectly matches the patient's results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Deficiency of $C2$**\n$C2$ is a component unique to the classical and lectin pathways. A deficiency of $C2$ prevents the formation of the classical $C3$ convertase ($C4b2a$). This would result in a CH50 of $0$. The alternative pathway does not use $C2$, so the AH50 would be normal. This perfectly matches the patient's results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Deficiency of $C4$**\n$C4$ is also unique to the classical and lectin pathways. A deficiency in $C4$ prevents the formation of the classical $C3$ convertase. This would lead to a CH50 of $0$. The alternative pathway does not use $C4$, so the AH50 would be normal. This perfectly matches the patient's results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Deficiency of $C3$**\n$C3$ is the central component of the complement system, essential for all three pathways. A deficiency in $C3$ would lead to an undetectable CH50 **and** an undetectable AH50. The patient's AH50 is normal, and the serum $C3$ concentration is also normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Deficiency of properdin**\nProperdin stabilizes the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase. Its deficiency impairs the alternative pathway, leading to a low or undetectable AH50. The classical pathway would be unaffected until the $C3$ step, so CH50 might be low but not necessarily zero if there is some alternative pathway-independent function, but crucially, AH50 would be abnormal. The patient's AH50 is normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Deficiency of $C5$ through $C9$**\nThese components form the terminal MAC. A deficiency in any of these components would prevent cell lysis, which is the endpoint for both the CH50 and AH50 assays. Therefore, a deficiency in $C5, C6, C7, C8,$ or $C9$ would cause both CH50 and AH50 to be undetectable. The patient's AH50 is normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "4436933"}, {"introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is rarely about a single test result; it is about piecing together a puzzle from the patient's history, physical exam, and diverse laboratory findings.

The problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to differentiate between Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) and DOCK$8$ deficiency based on the provided information and first principles.\n\n**1. Analysis of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)**\n- **Pathophysiology**: WAS is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the *WAS* gene, which encodes the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP). WASP is a critical regulator of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization in hematopoietic cells.\n    - **Platelet Biogenesis**: From first principles, platelets are anucleate fragments derived from megakaryocytes. This process, involving proplatelet formation, is highly dependent on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Defective WASP in megakaryocytes disrupts actin reorganization, leading to faulty proplatelet formation and the release of abnormally small platelets (microthrombocytes). These small platelets are also dysfunctional and are cleared rapidly from circulation, resulting in thrombocytopenia.\n    - **Immunology**: WASP is essential for the function of lymphocytes. Its absence impairs T-cell activation, proliferation, and migration, and also affects B-cell function, leading to a combined immunodeficiency. This manifests as susceptibility to recurrent infections. The immunologic dysregulation also leads to atopic features like eczema and elevated IgE levels.\n- **Consistency with Patient Data**:\n    - **Inheritance**: The family history of two affected maternal male relatives with early lethal outcomes is strongly suggestive of an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, which is characteristic of WAS.\n    - **Microthrombocytopenia**: The patient presents with both a low platelet count ($48 \\times 10^{9} / \\text{L}$) and, critically, a low Mean Platelet Volume ($5.0$ fL). This combination, known as microthrombocytopenia, is the pathognomonic laboratory finding in WAS and directly reflects the underlying cytoskeletal defect in megakaryocytes. The bleeding manifestations (bruising, epistaxis, petechiae) are a direct consequence.\n    - **Eczema and Infections**: The patient's history of eczema and recurrent sinopulmonary infections is part of the classic WAS triad.\n    - **Atopy**: The elevated IgE ($1800$ IU/mL) and eosinophilia ($1.2 \\times 10^{9} / \\text{L}$) are consistent with the atopic manifestations often seen in WAS.\n\n**2. Analysis of DOCK8 Deficiency**\n- **Pathophysiology**: DOCK$8$ deficiency is an autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency, often considered a form of Hyper-IgE Syndrome (HIES). The DOCK$8$ protein is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, particularly in lymphocyte migration and survival.\n    - **Immunology**: Deficiency leads to severe T-cell and B-cell defects. This results in extreme atopy with markedly elevated IgE (often much higher than seen in this case, sometimes $> 50,000$ IU/mL), severe eczema, and profound susceptibility to infections, especially severe and persistent cutaneous viral infections (e.g., Herpes simplex, Varicella zoster, molluscum contagiosum).\n    - **Platelet Biogenesis**: DOCK$8$ is not known to play a primary role in megakaryopoiesis or platelet formation. Thrombocytopenia can occur in DOCK$8$ deficiency, but it is typically secondary to autoimmune phenomena (immune thrombocytopenic purpura, ITP). In ITP, the bone marrow responds by increasing platelet production, leading to the release of young, large platelets. Therefore, if thrombocytopenia is present, the MPV would be expected to be normal or elevated, not decreased.\n- **Consistency with Patient Data**:\n    - **Inheritance**: An autosomal recessive pattern is inconsistent with the patient's family history.\n    - **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's microthrombocytopenia (low MPV) is a strong argument *against* a diagnosis of DOCK$8$ deficiency.\n    - **Atopy and Infections**: The elevated IgE, eosinophilia, eczema, and history of molluscum are consistent with DOCK$8$ deficiency. However, the problem notes the absence of *severe or disseminated* cutaneous viral infections, which would be more typical for DOCK$8$.\n\n**3. Differential Diagnosis and Test Prioritization**\nThe most discriminating feature between WAS and DOCK$8$ deficiency in this case is the character of the thrombocytopenia. The finding of **microthrombocytopenia (low count with low MPV)** is a specific hallmark of the cytoskeletal defect in WAS megakaryocytes and is not a feature of DOCK$8$ deficiency. This single laboratory value, when combined with the X-linked inheritance pattern suggested by the family history, creates a very strong case for WAS. The features that overlap (eczema, high IgE, infections) are less specific. Therefore, the most logical and efficient diagnostic approach is to prioritize the genetic test for the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Conclusion**: The diagnosis is most likely Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The primary genetic test should be sequencing of the *WAS* gene. The most decisive supporting feature for this prioritization is the presence of microthrombocytopenia with a decreased mean platelet volume.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Sequence the WAS gene first, because microthrombocytopenia with decreased mean platelet volume specifically indicates a megakaryocytic cytoskeletal defect consistent with Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome.**\n- This option correctly identifies the prioritized genetic test (*WAS* gene sequencing).\n- The justification is precise and pathophysiologically sound. It correctly identifies microthrombocytopenia as the key distinguishing feature and accurately links it to the fundamental defect in megakaryocyte cytoskeletal dynamics in WAS.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Perform deletion/duplication analysis of DOCK8 first, because elevated IgE and eczema are hallmark features of DOCK8 deficiency, and small platelets are typical in DOCK8 deficiency.**\n- This option prioritizes the incorrect test based on the evidence.\n- The justification contains a critical factual error. The statement that \"small platelets are typical in DOCK$8$ deficiency\" is false. Thrombocytopenia in DOCK$8$ deficiency, if present, is generally associated with normal or large platelets.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Sequence Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) first, because hyperimmunoglobulin E and eczema point to autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, which commonly includes microthrombocytopenia.**\n- This option proposes testing for a different disorder, autosomal dominant HIES (Job's Syndrome).\n- While the patient has high IgE and eczema, he lacks other key features of STAT$3$-deficient HIES such as retained primary teeth and pathologic fractures (explicitly noted as absent).\n- The justification contains a major factual error: STAT$3$-deficient HIES is **not** associated with thrombocytopenia, and certainly not microthrombocytopenia.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Undertake whole-exome sequencing without prioritization, because overlapping atopic and infectious features preclude distinguishing Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome from DOCK8 deficiency on clinical grounds.**\n- This option argues against prioritization.\n- The premise that the conditions are clinically indistinguishable is false. As established, the specific finding of microthrombocytopenia, in conjunction with the family history, strongly points to WAS and away from DOCK$8$ deficiency. Prioritization of a targeted gene test is not only possible but is the standard of care in such a scenario.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4798690"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of antibody deficiency is made, the focus shifts to effective management, which often involves lifelong replacement therapy.

We set $C_{ss,\\text{trough}} = T$ (after converting $T$ to mg/L) and solve for the required concentration increment $C_0$:\n$$ T = C_0 \\frac{e^{-k\\tau_A}}{1-e^{-k\\tau_A}} \\implies T(1-e^{-k\\tau_A}) = C_0 e^{-k\\tau_A} \\implies T(e^{k\\tau_A}-1) = C_0 $$\nThe dose $\\Delta D_1$ required to produce this increment $C_0$ in the volume $V_d$ is given by $C_0 = \\Delta D_1 / V_d$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta D_1 = C_0 \\times V_d = T \\times (e^{k \\tau_A} - 1) \\times V_d $$\nThe dose is calculated in milligrams (mg) and converted to grams (g) for the final report, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Task 2: Maximal Dosing Interval for a Fixed Dose**\n\nThis task uses the same steady-state trough formula but solves for the maximum interval, $\\tau_{\\max}$. A fixed per-infusion dose $D_{\\text{fixed}}$ (in mg/kg) is given. The total dose is $\\Delta D_{\\text{fixed}} = D_{\\text{fixed}} \\times W$. The corresponding concentration increment is:\n$$ C_{0, \\text{fixed}} = \\frac{\\Delta D_{\\text{fixed}}}{V_d} = \\frac{D_{\\text{fixed}} \\times W}{v_d \\times W} = \\frac{D_{\\text{fixed}}}{v_d} $$\nThe condition is that the steady-state trough must be at least the target value $T$:\n$$ C_{ss,\\text{trough}} \\geq T \\implies C_{0, \\text{fixed}} \\frac{e^{-k\\tau}}{1-e^{-k\\tau}} \\geq T $$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$ C_{0, \\text{fixed}} e^{-k\\tau} \\geq T(1-e^{-k\\tau}) $$\n$$ (C_{0, \\text{fixed}} + T) e^{-k\\tau} \\geq T $$\n$$ e^{-k\\tau} \\geq \\frac{T}{C_{0, \\text{fixed}} + T} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm and multiplying by $-1/k$ (which reverses the inequality):\n$$ \\tau \\leq -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{C_{0, \\text{fixed}} + T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0, \\text{fixed}} + T}{T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{C_{0, \\text{fixed}}}{T}\\right) $$\nThe maximal interval $\\tau_{\\max}$ is the upper bound of this inequality. It is reported in days, rounded to one decimal place.\n\n**Task 3: Simulation of Trough Concentrations**\n\nThis task requires simulating the buildup of IgG concentration over $N=6$ monthly infusions, where a month is $\\tau_M = 30$ days. The dose used is the exact, unrounded dose $\\Delta D_1$ calculated in Task 1, which produces the concentration increment $C_0 = \\Delta D_1 / V_d$.\n\nThe problem states \"compute the trough before dose $n$ at time $t = n \\tau_M$\". This phrasing is ambiguous. The standard convention is that the trough before dose $n$ occurs at time $t = (n-1)\\tau_M$. However, a literal interpretation is that we must calculate the concentration at times $t = \\tau_M, 2\\tau_M, \\ldots, N\\tau_M$. This corresponds to the trough concentrations just before doses $2, 3, \\ldots, N+1$. We will proceed with this literal interpretation.\n\nWe can define the troughs recursively. Let $C_{\\text{trough}, n}$ be the trough concentration at time $t = n\\tau_M$. The initial condition is zero concentration at $t=0$.\nThe peak concentration immediately after the first dose at $t=0$ is $C_0$.\nThe trough at time $t=\\tau_M$ is $C_{\\text{trough}, 1} = C_0 e^{-k\\tau_M}$.\nAt time $t=\\tau_M$, another dose is given, raising the concentration to $C_{\\text{trough}, 1} + C_0$.\nThe trough at $t=2\\tau_M$ is then $C_{\\text{trough}, 2} = (C_{\\text{trough}, 1} + C_0) e^{-k\\tau_M}$.\nThe general recursive formula is:\n$$ C_{\\text{trough}, n} = (C_{\\text{trough}, n-1} + C_0) e^{-k\\tau_M} $$\nwith the initial value for the recursion being the trough before the first dose, $C_{\\text{trough}, 0} = 0$. We compute this for $n=1, \\dots, N$. The resulting concentrations in mg/L are converted to mg/dL and rounded to one decimal place.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the pharmacokinetic problem for three test cases, providing dose,\n    max interval, and trough simulation results.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite: (t_half, v_d, W, T, tau_A, D_fixed)\n    # Units: days, L/kg, kg, mg/dL, days, mg/kg\n    test_cases = [\n        (21, 0.2, 70, 600, 28, 400),\n        (14, 0.25, 70, 700, 21, 600),\n        (30, 0.15, 50, 500, 35, 300)\n    ]\n    \n    # Constants defined in the problem\n    TAU_M = 30  # Monthly interval in days for simulation\n    N_CYCLES = 6 # Number of cycles for simulation\n    DL_TO_L_CONVERSION_FACTOR = 10 # 1 dL = 0.1 L -> 10 dL = 1 L\n    \n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        t_half, v_d, W, T_mg_dl, tau_A, D_fixed_mg_per_kg = case\n        \n        # --- Shared Parameter Calculations ---\n        # All internal calculations use consistent units: L, mg, days\n        k = np.log(2) / t_half       # Elimination rate constant (days^-1)\n        Vd = v_d * W                 # Total distribution volume (L)\n        T_mg_l = T_mg_dl * DL_TO_L_CONVERSION_FACTOR  # Target trough (mg/L)\n        \n        # --- Task 1: Minimum Dose Calculation ---\n        # Calculate the required immediate concentration increment (C0) in mg/L\n        C0_task1 = T_mg_l * (np.exp(k * tau_A) - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the dose in mg required to achieve this C0\n        dose_mg_unrounded = C0_task1 * Vd\n        \n        # Convert dose to grams and round to two decimal places for reporting\n        dose_g = round(dose_mg_unrounded / 1000, 2)\n        \n        # --- Task 2: Maximal Dosing Interval ---\n        # Calculate the C0 from the fixed dose (D_fixed)\n        # C0 = (D_fixed_mg_per_kg * W) / Vd simplifies to D_fixed_mg_per_kg / v_d\n        C0_fixed = D_fixed_mg_per_kg / v_d  # Increment from fixed dose (mg/L)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximal interval tau_max in days\n        # tau = (1/k) * ln(1 + C0_fixed / T_mg_l)\n        tau_max = (1 / k) * np.log(1 + C0_fixed / T_mg_l)\n        \n        # Round to one decimal place for reporting\n        tau_max_rounded = round(tau_max, 1)\n\n        # --- Task 3: Trough Concentration Simulation ---\n        # Use the unrounded dose from Task 1, which corresponds to C0_task1\n        C0_sim = C0_task1 # mg/L\n\n        trough_list_mg_dl = []\n        current_trough_mg_l = 0.0 # Start from zero concentration\n        \n        # Calculate the decay factor for the monthly interval\n        decay_factor = np.exp(-k * TAU_M)\n\n        for _ in range(N_CYCLES):\n            # Peak concentration immediately after adding a dose\n            peak_mg_l = current_trough_mg_l + C0_sim\n            # Trough concentration after one interval of decay\n            next_trough_mg_l = peak_mg_l * decay_factor\n            \n            # Convert trough to mg/dL for reporting and round\n            trough_mg_dl = next_trough_mg_l / DL_TO_L_CONVERSION_FACTOR\n            trough_list_mg_dl.append(round(trough_mg_dl, 1))\n            \n            # Update the current trough for the next iteration\n            current_trough_mg_l = next_trough_mg_l\n            \n        case_result = [dose_g, tau_max_rounded, trough_list_mg_dl]\n        results.append(case_result)\n\n    # --- Format Final Output ---\n    # Construct the final string exactly as specified, without extra spaces.\n    formatted_results = []\n    for res in results:\n        dose_val, tau_val, trough_list = res\n        trough_list_str = f\"[{','.join(map(str, trough_list))}]\"\n        result_str = f\"[{dose_val},{tau_val},{trough_list_str}]\"\n        formatted_results.append(result_str)\n        \n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n```", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[[127.8,8.7,[338.9,464.1,537.4,564.3,574.3,578.0]],[169.58,11.8,[500.2,650.1,687.6,696.9,699.2,699.8]],[56.88,14.6,[227.1,380.0,451.1,479.5,491.4,496.2]]]}$$", "id": "4798632"}]}
