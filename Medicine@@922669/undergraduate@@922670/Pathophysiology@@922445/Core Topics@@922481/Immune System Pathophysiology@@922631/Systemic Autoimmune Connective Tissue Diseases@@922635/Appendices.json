Beyond simply measuring the levels of individual components like $C3$ or $C4$, it is crucial to understand the functional integrity of its different activation routes. This practice challenges you to work through a hypothetical case of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) to predict the results of functional complement assays, the CH$50$ and AH$50$. By connecting a specific pattern of complement consumption to its functional consequences, you will build a more robust understanding of how the classical and alternative pathways operate independently and how we test them in a clinical setting. [@problem_id:4838586]", "problem": "A patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents with arthralgias and a malar rash during a disease flare. Immune complex formation is suspected to be driving complement activation. Antigenic complement measurements show markedly decreased serum $C4$ with normal $C3$, and normal terminal pathway components $C5$ through $C9$ by immunoassay. There is no evidence of infection or membrane attack complex deposition on biopsy. You are asked to predict the pattern of functional hemolytic complement assays and justify your answer mechanistically.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- The complement system comprises three initiation routes: the classical pathway (triggered by immune complexes via $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$ acting on $C4$ and $C2$), the lectin pathway (mannose-binding lectin–associated serine proteases acting on $C4$ and $C2$), and the alternative pathway (constitutive “tickover” of $C3$ with amplification by factor $B$, factor $D$, and properdin). All three converge at $C3$ and then the terminal pathway ($C5$–$C9$).\n- Total classical pathway hemolytic activity (CH$50$) quantifies the ability of serum to lyse antibody-coated erythrocytes through the classical pathway, requiring intact $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, $C2$, $C3$, and $C5$–$C9$.\n- Alternative pathway hemolytic activity (AH$50$) quantifies the ability of serum to lyse unsensitized erythrocytes through the alternative pathway, requiring intact $C3$, factor $B$, factor $D$, properdin, and $C5$–$C9$, while functionally bypassing $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, and $C2$.\n- In immune complex–mediated classical pathway activation, early classical components (especially $C4$ and $C2$) are preferentially consumed; the terminal components $C5$–$C9$ may remain preserved if activation does not proceed to terminal assembly.\n\nWhich pattern of CH$50$ and AH$50$ results is most consistent with classical pathway activation with preservation of the terminal pathway, given the provided antigenic profile, and why?\n\nA. Decreased CH$50$ with normal AH$50$, because consumption of $C1$ complex, $C4$, and $C2$ impairs classical pathway–dependent hemolysis, while intact $C3$, factor $B$, factor $D$, properdin, and $C5$–$C9$ support normal alternative pathway hemolysis.\n\nB. Decreased CH$50$ and decreased AH$50$, because any upstream activation inevitably consumes $C5$–$C9$, so both assays fall due to terminal pathway depletion.\n\nC. Normal CH$50$ with decreased AH$50$, because selective activation of the classical pathway spares $C4$ and $C2$ but depletes factor $B$ and factor $D$, thereby reducing alternative pathway activity.\n\nD. Normal CH$50$ and normal AH$50$, because preserved $C5$–$C9$ ensure full hemolytic function regardless of defects in early pathway components.\n\nE. Decreased CH$50$ with increased AH$50$, because classical pathway consumption of $C4$ and $C2$ diverts more $C3$ into the alternative pathway amplification loop, enhancing alternative pathway hemolysis.", "solution": "We begin from the complement pathway architecture and assay definitions. The classical pathway is initiated by $C1q$ binding to immune complexes (typically IgG or IgM), activating $C1r$ and $C1s$, which cleave $C4$ and $C2$ to form the classical $C3$ convertase ($C4b2a$). The alternative pathway proceeds by spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ with assembly of $C3bB$ and activation by factor $D$ to $C3bBb$, stabilized by properdin. All pathways converge at $C3$, then activate the terminal components $C5$–$C9$ to form the membrane attack complex.\n\nThe CH$50$ assay requires the integrity of classical pathway–specific components ($C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, $C2$) plus the shared components $C3$ and the terminal pathway $C5$–$C9$ to lyse antibody-coated erythrocytes. The AH$50$ assay functionally bypasses the classical components by chelating $Ca^{2+}$ (or using conditions that block $C1$), and requires $C3$, factor $B$, factor $D$, properdin, and $C5$–$C9$.\n\nThe patient’s antigenic profile shows markedly decreased $C4$, normal $C3$, and preserved $C5$–$C9$. This is consistent with immune complex–driven classical pathway activation that preferentially consumes $C4$ (and often $C2$), without sufficient propagation to deplete $C3$ and the terminal pathway. Under these conditions:\n- CH$50$ should be decreased because the classical pathway is impaired by low $C4$ (and likely $C2$), so the serum cannot efficiently generate the classical $C3$ convertase ($C4b2a$) to mediate hemolysis of sensitized erythrocytes, even though $C5$–$C9$ are present.\n- AH$50$ should be normal because AH$50$ does not depend on $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, or $C2$. With normal $C3$, intact factor $B$, factor $D$, properdin, and preserved $C5$–$C9$, the alternative pathway can generate $C3bBb$ and proceed to terminal lysis normally.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\nA. Decreased CH$50$ with normal AH$50$, because consumption of $C1$ complex, $C4$, and $C2$ impairs classical pathway–dependent hemolysis, while intact $C3$, factor $B$, factor $D$, properdin, and $C5$–$C9$ support normal alternative pathway hemolysis.\nAnalysis: This aligns with the pathway dependencies and the provided antigenic data (low $C4$, normal $C3$, preserved $C5$–$C9$). The classical pathway is compromised; the alternative pathway remains functional. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Decreased CH$50$ and decreased AH$50$, because any upstream activation inevitably consumes $C5$–$C9$, so both assays fall due to terminal pathway depletion.\nAnalysis: The premise is incorrect. Terminal pathway $C5$–$C9$ are preserved by immunoassay, and upstream activation does not inevitably deplete terminal components; partial or regulated activation can preferentially consume early classical components (e.g., $C4$) without exhausting $C5$–$C9$. With normal $C3$ and terminal components, AH$50$ should be normal. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Normal CH$50$ with decreased AH$50$, because selective activation of the classical pathway spares $C4$ and $C2$ but depletes factor $B$ and factor $D$, thereby reducing alternative pathway activity.\nAnalysis: This contradicts the provided data. Classical activation does not spare $C4$ and $C2$; it consumes them. The antigenic profile shows low $C4$, not depleted factor $B$ or factor $D$. CH$50$ depends critically on $C4$ and $C2$ and would be reduced. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Normal CH$50$ and normal AH$50$, because preserved $C5$–$C9$ ensure full hemolytic function regardless of defects in early pathway components.\nAnalysis: Hemolytic assays require intact initiation and amplification steps, not solely the terminal pathway. CH$50$ specifically depends on $C1q$, $C1r$, $C1s$, $C4$, and $C2$. Low $C4$ impairs CH$50$ even if $C5$–$C9$ are preserved. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Decreased CH$50$ with increased AH$50$, because classical pathway consumption of $C4$ and $C2$ diverts more $C3$ into the alternative pathway amplification loop, enhancing alternative pathway hemolysis.\nAnalysis: While crosstalk exists, AH$50$ is not physiologically “upregulated” in the hemolytic assay by passive diversion from the classical pathway. The assay outcome reflects component sufficiency, not enhancement by diversion. With normal $C3$ and alternative factors, AH$50$ would be normal, not increased. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the expected pattern is decreased CH$50$ with normal AH$50$, justified by classical pathway component consumption with preserved $C3$ and terminal pathway function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4838586"}, {"introduction": "In modern pathophysiology, autoantibodies are more than just diagnostic flags; they are powerful tools for predicting a patient's clinical course and risk for specific complications.

To interpret the tests, begin from the following fundamental base in systemic sclerosis pathophysiology: systemic sclerosis reflects a triad of microvascular injury, dysregulated autoimmunity, and fibroblast activation with excessive extracellular matrix deposition, producing organ-specific fibrosis. The spatial distribution of cutaneous fibrosis (limited to distal extremities and face versus diffuse involving proximal limbs and trunk) correlates with internal organ involvement because the same immune-fibrotic processes variably target vascular beds and parenchyma (for example, pulmonary arterioles versus interstitium, renal vasculature versus glomeruli).
