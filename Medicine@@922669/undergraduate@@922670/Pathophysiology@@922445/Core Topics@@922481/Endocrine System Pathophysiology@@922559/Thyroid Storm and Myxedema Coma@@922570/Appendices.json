To move from a subjective clinical impression to an objective diagnosis, clinicians use scoring systems like the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS).

The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) is a recognized diagnostic tool, and the patient parameters provided are clinically plausible for the condition described. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total score on the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) for a given patient and to classify the diagnosis based on this score. The final result is to be presented as a row matrix containing the total score and a corresponding numerical classification code.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by systematically evaluating the patient's presentation against each category of the BWPS rubric.

The BWPS rubric for moderate CHF is \"bibasilar rales\".\n    $$S_{\\text{CHF}} = 10$$\n\n4.  **Cardiovascular Dysfunction — Atrial Fibrillation ($S_{\\text{AF}}$):**\n    The problem states that atrial fibrillation is \"present\".\n    $$S_{\\text{AF}} = 10$$\n\n5.  **Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects ($S_{\\text{CNS}}$):**\n    The patient's condition is described as \"severe CNS agitation with seizure-like activity\".

[@problem_id:4842347]", "problem": "A clinician evaluates a patient with suspected extreme hypothyroid decompensation. Severe deficiency of thyroid hormones decreases basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis, depresses cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, slows ventilatory drive and gastrointestinal motility, and impairs free-water clearance via increased antidiuretic hormone release and reduced effective arterial blood volume. Superimposed stressors such as infection can precipitate decompensation.

A GCS score of $8$ or less is the clinical definition of coma. The CNS scoring rubric is:\n    -   Somnolence or lethargy: $10$ points\n    -   Obtundation: $15$ points\n    -   Stupor: $20$ points\n    -   Coma or seizures: $30$ points\n    The patient's state corresponds to coma.\n    Therefore, $S_{\\text{CNS}} = 30$.\n\n3.  **Cardiovascular Dysfunction ($S_{\\text{cardio}}$):**\n    This score is a sum of points for bradycardia, hypotension, and other features.\n    -   **Bradycardia:** The patient's heart rate is $40$ beats per minute.

The rubric assigns $20$ points for hypotension.\n    -   **Other Cardiopulmonary Features:** The problem explicitly states there is no clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of pericardial effusion (worth $10$ points) and no pulmonary edema on imaging (worth $15$ points). Thus, the score for these features is $0$.\n    The total cardiovascular score is the sum of these components: $S_{\\text{cardio}} = 20 (\\text{bradycardia}) + 20 (\\text{hypotension}) + 0 (\\text{other}) = 40$.\n\n4.  **Gastrointestinal (GI) Dysfunction ($S_{\\text{GI}}$):**\n    The problem states there is no ileus.
