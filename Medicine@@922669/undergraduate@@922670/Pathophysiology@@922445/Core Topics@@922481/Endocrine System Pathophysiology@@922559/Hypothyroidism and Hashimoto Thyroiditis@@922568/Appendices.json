Let $S$ denote serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) concentration and $F$ denote serum free thyroxine ($fT_4$) concentration. The thyroid gland capacity is represented by a dimensionless parameter $G$.\n\nUse the following well-validated physiological bases and model abstractions:\n1. At steady state, thyroid hormone production balances clearance. Over a moderate operating range, thyroidal $fT_4$ output is approximately proportional to TSH and gland capacity, so $F = a\\,G\\,S$, where $a$ is a composite proportionality constant.\n2. Pituitary TSH secretion is inhibited by circulating $fT_4$ via negative feedback that can be captured by a first-order Hill-type hyperbolic form: $S = \\dfrac{b}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{F}{F_{50}}\\right)^{m}}$, where $b$ is the pituitary drive constant in the absence of feedback, $F_{50}$ is the $fT_4$ concentration producing half-maximal feedback inhibition, and $m$ is the Hill exponent. For small to moderate deviations around euthyroid conditions, take $m=1$.\n\nYou are given the following parameter values chosen to reflect euthyroid calibration before injury:\n- Baseline gland capacity $G_0 = 1$.\n- Thyroid output per TSH per unit gland capacity $a = 8\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,L^{-1}\\,(mIU\\,L^{-1})^{-1}}$.\n- Pituitary drive constant $b = \\dfrac{62}{15}\\,\\mathrm{mIU\\,L^{-1}}$.\n- Half-inhibition $fT_4$ level $F_{50} = 15\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n- Hill exponent $m = 1$.\n\nAutoimmune thyroid injury is modeled as a reduction in gland capacity: $G_{\\text{new}} = 0.70\\,G_0$.
