In pathophysiology, osmolality is defined as the sum of all dissolved particles per unit mass of solvent, whereas tonicity is the effective osmolality that determines transmembrane water movement and therefore depends on solute permeability across the cell membrane. Using the following fundamental bases:\n- The osmotic pressure generated by solutes is described by the van’t Hoff relation, where the contribution of each solute to effective osmotic pressure depends on the number of particles it yields in solution and whether it can cross the membrane.\n- Electrically neutral extracellular fluid requires cations to be accompanied by anions.\n- Urea equilibrates rapidly across cell membranes and thus is an ineffective osmole for transcellular water shifts, while sodium salts and, acutely, glucose behave as effective osmoles.\n- The molar mass of glucose is $180\\,\\text{g/mol}$, and $[\\text{Na}^+]$ is reported in $\\text{mEq/L}$, which for a monovalent ion equals $\\text{mmol/L}$.\n\nStarting from these bases and defining an effective osmole as a solute with negligible transmembrane permeability on the timescale of water movement, derive an expression for the plasma tonicity in terms of the extracellular sodium concentration $[\\text{Na}^+]$ and the plasma glucose concentration measured in $\\text{mg/dL}$, explicitly excluding urea.

Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express the result in $\\text{mOsm/kg}$.", "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of pathophysiology and physical chemistry, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for plasma tonicity and then calculate its value for a specific patient. Tonicity, or effective osmolality, is defined as the sum of the concentrations of solutes that are effective osmoles, meaning they do not readily cross the cell membrane and thus exert an osmotic force that drives water movement. The problem specifies that sodium salts and glucose are to be considered effective osmoles, while urea is to be excluded. The final result should be in units of milliosmoles per kilogram of solvent ($\\text{mOsm/kg}$). The concentrations are given in units per volume of solution (e.g., $\\text{mEq/L}$, $\\text{mg/dL}$), and we will use the standard clinical approximation that the concentration per liter of plasma is approximately equal to the concentration per kilogram of plasma water.\n\nLet $T$ represent the plasma tonicity. Based on the problem definition, $T$ is the sum of the osmolar contributions of all effective osmoles.\n$$T = (\\text{Contribution from sodium salts}) + (\\text{Contribution from glucose})$$\n\nFirst, we derive the contribution from sodium salts. The concentration of sodium ions is given as $[\\text{Na}^+]$. The problem states that for a monovalent ion, concentration in $\\text{mEq/L}$ is equivalent to concentration in $\\text{mmol/L}$. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation. The principle of electroneutrality requires that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must balance the total concentration of negative charges (anions). Sodium ions are primarily accompanied by chloride ($[\\text{Cl}^-]$) and bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$) anions, which are also effective osmoles. A standard and clinically accepted simplification, justified by the provided principles, is to assume that the concentration of accompanying anions is approximately equal to the concentration of sodium ions. Since sodium salts like $\\text{NaCl}$ dissociate into two particles (e.g., $\\text{Na}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$), the total number of osmoles contributed by sodium and its associated anions is approximately twice the molar concentration of sodium.\n$$ \\text{Contribution from sodium salts} \\approx [\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{accompanying anions}] \\approx [\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{Na}^+] = 2 \\times [\\text{Na}^+] $$\nGiven that $[\\text{Na}^+]$ is in $\\text{mmol/L}$, this contribution is in $\\text{mOsm/L}$, which we approximate as $\\text{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nNext, we derive the contribution from glucose. Glucose does not dissociate in solution, so one mole of glucose contributes one osmole of particles. Its contribution to tonicity is therefore equal to its molar concentration. The plasma glucose concentration, let's call it $C_G$, is given in units of milligrams per deciliter ($\\text{mg/dL}$). We must convert this to millimoles per liter ($\\text{mmol/L}$).\nThe molar mass of glucose, $M_G$, is given as $180\\,\\text{g/mol}$.\n\nWe perform the unit conversion for the glucose concentration $C_G$:\n1.  Convert mass from $\\text{mg}$ to $\\text{g}$: $1\\,\\text{mg} = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{g}$.\n2.  Convert volume from $\\text{dL}$ to $\\text{L}$: $1\\,\\text{dL} = 10^{-1}\\,\\text{L}$.\n\nSo, the concentration in $\\text{g/L}$ is:\n$$ C_G \\left[\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}\\right] \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\text{g}}{1\\,\\text{mg}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{dL}}{10^{-1}\\,\\text{L}} = C_G \\times 10^{-2} \\left[\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{L}}\\right] = \\frac{C_G}{100} \\left[\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{L}}\\right] $$\nNow, we convert this mass concentration to molar concentration by dividing by the molar mass, $M_G = 180\\,\\text{g/mol}$:\n$$ [\\text{Glucose}]_{\\text{mol/L}} = \\frac{C_G / 100 \\,\\text{[g/L]}}{180 \\,\\text{[g/mol]}} = \\frac{C_G}{18000} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}}\\right] $$\nTo express this in $\\text{mmol/L}$, we multiply by $1000\\,\\text{mmol/mol}$:\n$$ [\\text{Glucose}]_{\\text{mmol/L}} = \\frac{C_G}{18000} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}}\\right] \\times 1000 \\left[\\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{mol}}\\right] = \\frac{C_G}{18} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}}\\right] $$\nSince glucose is a non-dissociating solute, its osmolar concentration in $\\text{mOsm/L}$ is equal to its molar concentration in $\\text{mmol/L}$. Thus, the contribution of glucose to tonicity is $\\frac{C_G}{18}$, where $C_G$ is the concentration in $\\text{mg/dL}$.\n\nCombining the contributions from sodium salts and glucose, we obtain the derived expression for plasma tonicity, $T$:\n$$ T \\approx 2 \\times [\\text{Na}^+] + \\frac{C_G}{18} $$\nHere, $[\\text{Na}^+]$ is in $\\text{mEq/L}$ (or $\\text{mmol/L}$) and $C_G$ is the glucose concentration in $\\text{mg/dL}$. The resulting tonicity $T$ is in $\\text{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nNow we apply this formula to the patient's data:\n- $[\\text{Na}^+] = 122\\,\\text{mEq/L}$\n- $C_G = 432\\,\\text{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression:\n$$ T \\approx 2 \\times (122) + \\frac{432}{18} $$\nFirst, calculate the contribution from sodium:\n$$ 2 \\times 122 = 244 $$\nNext, calculate the contribution from glucose:\n$$ \\frac{432}{18} = 24 $$\nSumming the two contributions gives the total plasma tonicity:\n$$ T \\approx 244 + 24 = 268 $$\nThe calculated value is $268\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The analysis will be based on the principles of conservation of mass for water and effective osmoles (sodium and potassium ions).\n\nFirst, we establish the reference tonicity, which is the initial serum effective tonicity, denoted as $C_s$.

This is the balance of electrolyte-free water gained from all inputs and lost through all outputs. The total change, $\\Delta V_{efw, \\text{net}}$, is the sum of the free water contributed by inputs minus the sum of the free water removed by outputs.
