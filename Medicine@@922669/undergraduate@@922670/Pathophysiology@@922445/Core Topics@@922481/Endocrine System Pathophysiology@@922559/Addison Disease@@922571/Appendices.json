The adrenal zona glomerulosa is intact.\n- Foundational Fact 1: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal zona glomerulosa in response to effective arterial blood volume and potassium. Aldosterone promotes distal nephron reabsorption of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and secretion of $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ via actions on the epithelial sodium channel and basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}\\text{-ATPase}$.\n- Foundational Fact 2: Cortisol deficiency increases antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and impairs free water excretion, which can cause dilutional hyponatremia, independent of aldosterone.\n- Foundational Fact 3: In primary adrenal insufficiency, both glucocorticoids (like cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (like aldosterone) are deficient, despite RAAS activation.\n- Foundational Fact 4: In secondary adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoids are deficient, but mineralocorticoid production is largely preserved because its regulation by RAAS is intact.\n\nThe question asks for the predicted steady-state serum patterns for sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$), and bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) in each patient, and the correct mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of endocrinology and renal physiology. The descriptions of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, the RAAS, and the actions of aldosterone, cortisol, and ADH are all factually correct and form the basis of clinical pathophysiology.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct clinical scenarios and a set of fundamental principles. The task is to apply these principles to predict outcomes, which is a standard deductive reasoning exercise in science. A unique and logical solution can be derived from the given information.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjectivity. Terms like \"primary adrenal insufficiency,\" \"zona glomerulosa,\" and \"RAAS\" are well-defined within the field.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided facts are internally consistent and sufficient to solve the problem. The key distinction between primary and secondary insufficiency regarding mineralocorticoid status is explicitly stated, which is the crucial piece of information needed for the derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be derived by applying the foundational facts to each patient scenario.\n\n**Analysis for Patient X (Primary Adrenal insufficiency)**\n\n1.  **Hormone Status**: Based on the problem definition and Foundational Fact 3, Patient X has a deficiency of both glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone). The adrenal cortex is destroyed and cannot respond to stimuli.\n2.  **Sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$)**: Aldosterone deficiency leads to impaired renal $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption (per Fact 1), causing urinary sodium loss, volume depletion, and hyponatremia. Concurrently, cortisol deficiency leads to increased ADH release and impaired free water excretion (per Fact 2), causing water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Both mechanisms contribute to lowering serum sodium. Therefore, we predict $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.\n3.  **Potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$)**: Aldosterone deficiency leads to impaired renal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion (per Fact 1). This inability to excrete potassium results in its accumulation in the blood. Therefore, we predict $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$.\n4.  **Bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$)**: Aldosterone deficiency leads to impaired renal $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion (per Fact 1). The retention of hydrogen ions leads to a systemic metabolic acidosis. In metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate is consumed in buffering the excess acid, leading to a decreased serum concentration. Therefore, we predict $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This is specifically a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n**Summary for Patient X**: The expected pattern is $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.\n\n**Analysis for Patient Y (Secondary Adrenal insufficiency)**\n\n1.  **Hormone Status**: Based on the problem definition and Foundational Fact 4, Patient Y has a deficiency of glucocorticoids (cortisol) due to low ACTH, but mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) production is largely preserved. The intact zona glomerulosa can still respond to the RAAS.\n2.  **Sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$)**: Since mineralocorticoid function is intact, there is no significant aldosterone-mediated renal sodium wasting. However, the cortisol deficiency is present, which leads to increased ADH and dilutional hyponatremia (per Fact 2). Therefore, we predict $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.\n3.  **Potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$)**: Since aldosterone secretion is regulated by RAAS and is largely preserved, the kidney's ability to secrete potassium is maintained. Therefore, serum potassium is expected to be normal. We predict normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$.\n4.  **Bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$)**: With aldosterone function preserved, renal secretion of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ is also maintained. Therefore, acid-base status should be largely normal. We predict normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.\n\n**Summary for Patient Y**: The expected pattern is $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the derivation:\n- Primary AI: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\n- Secondary AI: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\n\n**A. Primary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; Secondary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal to mildly $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Mechanism: In primary, aldosterone deficiency despite high renin causes impaired distal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion; in secondary, aldosterone is intact via RAAS so $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and acid-base are largely preserved while hyponatremia reflects increased ADH from cortisol deficiency.**\n- **Electrolyte Pattern**: This matches our derived pattern. The \"normal to mildly $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\" for secondary is clinically reasonable and does not contradict the primary prediction of \"normal\".\n- **Mechanism**: The explanation is perfectly aligned with our derivation. It correctly identifies aldosterone deficiency as the cause of hyperkalemia and acidosis in primary AI. It correctly states that aldosterone is preserved in secondary AI, thus preserving normal potassium and acid-base balance. It also correctly attributes the hyponatremia in both conditions (but as the primary cause in secondary AI) to the effects of cortisol deficiency on ADH.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Primary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; Secondary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Mechanism: In primary, RAAS activation compensates aldosterone; in secondary, low ACTH reduces aldosterone causing hyperkalemia and acidosis.**\n- **Electrolyte Pattern**: This pattern is the exact opposite of the correct one, incorrectly swapping the mineralocorticoid-related effects between primary and secondary AI.\n- **Mechanism**: The reasoning is false. In primary AI, RAAS activation *cannot* compensate for a destroyed adrenal cortex (violates Fact 3). In secondary AI, low ACTH does *not* significantly reduce aldosterone, as aldosterone is regulated by RAAS (violates Fact 4).\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Primary: $\\uparrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; Secondary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Mechanism: In primary, RAAS overactivation increases aldosterone leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and metabolic alkalosis; secondary has only dilutional hyponatremia.**\n- **Electrolyte Pattern**: The pattern for primary AI ($\\uparrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\downarrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) describes a state of mineralocorticoid *excess* (e.g., Conn's syndrome), which is the opposite of the pathology in Addison disease.\n- **Mechanism**: The mechanism for primary AI is factually wrong. RAAS is overactivated, but it *fails* to produce aldosterone because the gland is destroyed.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Primary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; Secondary: $\\downarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$, normal $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Mechanism: Both forms reduce aldosterone causing hyperkalemia, but only primary increases bicarbonate due to volume contraction alkalosis.**\n- **Electrolyte Pattern**: The pattern incorrectly states that bicarbonate is increased ($\\uparrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) in primary AI and that potassium is increased ($\\uparrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}$) in secondary AI.\n- **Mechanism**: The reasoning is flawed. It incorrectly claims both forms reduce aldosterone, contradicting Fact 4. It also wrongly attributes an alkalosis to primary AI, when the dominant effect of aldosterone deficiency is a metabolic acidosis ($\\downarrow \\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) due to impaired $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4761231"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to clinical practice, confirming a diagnosis of Addison disease requires objective testing.

I will now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of cortisol increments at two time points, followed by an evaluation of adrenal response adequacy based on a set of two specific criteria.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cortisol increment, $\\Delta_t$, which is defined as the difference between the cortisol concentration at time $t$ and the baseline concentration at $t=0$. The formula is given as:\n$$\n\\Delta_t = C(t) - C(0)\n$$\n\nFor the time point $t=30$ minutes, the increment $\\Delta_{30}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{30} = C(30) - C(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta_{30} = 12.61 - 5.36 = 7.25\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed with four significant figures. To achieve this, we write $7.25$ as $7.250$. So, $\\Delta_{30} = 7.250$.\n\nFor the time point $t=60$ minutes, the increment $\\Delta_{60}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{60} = C(60) - C(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta_{60} = 13.07 - 5.36 = 7.71\n$$\nSimilarly, expressing this value with four significant figures gives $7.710$. So, $\\Delta_{60} = 7.710$.\n\nNext, we must determine the adequacy of the adrenal response by evaluating two criteria jointly. The adequacy indicator $I$ is $1$ only if both criteria are met.\n\n**Criterion 1: Peak cortisol response.**\nThe peak cortisol, $C_{\\text{peak}}$, is the maximum concentration observed post-stimulation.\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} = \\max(C(30), C(60)) = \\max(12.61, 13.07) = 13.07\\,\\mu\\text{g/dL}\n$$\nThe criterion requires that $C_{\\text{peak}} \\ge 18\\,\\mu\\text{g/dL}$.\nWe check this condition:\n$$\n13.07 \\ge 18\n$$\nThis statement is false. Therefore, Criterion 1 is not satisfied.\n\n**Criterion 2: Cortisol increment response.**\nThe criterion requires that the increment, $\\Delta_t$, be at least $7\\,\\mu\\text{g/dL}$ at either $t=30$ minutes or $t=60$ minutes. This is a logical OR condition: $(\\Delta_{30} \\ge 7) \\lor (\\Delta_{60} \\ge 7)$.\nWe check the condition for $\\Delta_{30}$:\nIs $7.250 \\ge 7$? Yes, this is true.\nSince the condition is met for $t=30$ minutes, the logical OR statement is true. For completeness, we also check the condition for $\\Delta_{60}$:\nIs $7.710 \\ge 7$? Yes, this is also true.\nTherefore, Criterion 2 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we determine the adequacy indicator, $I$. The value of $I$ is $1$ if and only if both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 are satisfied.

Now we can use this to calculate the potential at baseline and during the crisis.\n\nThe baseline resting potential, $V_{\\text{baseline}}$, is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe crisis resting potential, $V_{\\text{crisis}}$, is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{crisis}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the change in potential, $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{crisis}} - V_{\\text{baseline}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\left[ \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out the constant term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$ and using the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}} / [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}} / [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe intracellular concentration $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ cancels, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}}} \\right)\n$$\nNow we substitute the given values:\n- $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $z = +1$\n- $F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}$\n- $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}} = 7.5\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n\nLet's compute the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{zF}$:\n$$\n\\frac{RT}{zF} = \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) (310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{(+1) (96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}})} \\approx 0.026712\\ \\mathrm{J/C} = 0.026712\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, let's compute the concentration ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, crisis}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out, baseline}}} = \\frac{7.5\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{4.0\\ \\mathrm{mM}} = 1.875\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = (0.026712\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln(1.875)\n$$\n$\\ln(1.875) \\approx 0.6286087$\n$$\n\\Delta V \\approx (0.026712\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times (0.6286087) \\approx 0.0167909\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millivolts ($mV$).
