He has a recent history of polyuria and polydipsia and a family history of autoimmune disease. Physical examination reveals dehydration and a fruity odor on the breath. Arterial blood gas shows $pH = 7.12$. Basic metabolic panel reports the following serum values: sodium $[Na^+] = 137.5$ milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), chloride $[Cl^-] = 101.3$ mEq/L, bicarbonate $[HCO_3^-] = 8.72$ mEq/L, potassium $[K^+] = 5.3$ mEq/L.

It presents a classic clinical scenario of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and asks for a standard calculation and interpretation based on fundamental physiological principles.\n\nThe derivation and calculation will proceed as follows.\n\nThe foundational principle for understanding the serum anion gap is the law of electroneutrality, which states that in any macroscopic volume of plasma, the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions).\n\nLet $C_{total}$ be the total concentration of cations and $A_{total}$ be the total concentration of anions in the serum, both expressed in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The principle of electroneutrality dictates:\n$$C_{total} = A_{total}$$\n\nThese totals can be broken down into measured and unmeasured components. The routinely measured cations in a basic metabolic panel are primarily sodium ($[Na^+]$) and sometimes potassium ($[K^+]$). The routinely measured anions are chloride ($[Cl^-]$) and bicarbonate ($[HCO_3^-]$).\n\nLet $C_{measured}$ be the sum of measured cations and $A_{measured}$ be the sum of measured anions.\nLet $U.C.$ (Unmeasured Cations) and $U.A.$ (Unmeasured Anions) represent the concentrations of all other cations (e.g., $[K^+]$ if not included in the primary calculation, $[Ca^{2+}]$, $[Mg^{2+}]$) and anions (e.g., albumin, phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions like lactate or ketoacids), respectively.\n\nThe electroneutrality equation can be expanded as:\n$$C_{measured} + U.C. = A_{measured} + U.A.$$\n\nThe standard clinical definition for measured cations includes only sodium, and for measured anions, it includes chloride and bicarbonate:\n$$C_{measured} = [Na^+]$$\n$$A_{measured} = [Cl^-] + [HCO_3^-]$$\n\nSubstituting these into the electroneutrality equation gives:\n$$[Na^+] + U.C. = ([Cl^-] + [HCO_3^-]) + U.A.$$\n\nThe serum Anion Gap ($AG$) is defined as the difference between the concentration of unmeasured anions and unmeasured cations:\n$$AG \\equiv U.A. - U.C.$$\nThis value represents the net concentration of anions that are not routinely measured. A normal, healthy individual has a baseline anion gap primarily due to negatively charged proteins, with albumin being the most significant contributor.\n\nBy rearranging the electroneutrality equation to solve for $U.A. - U.C.$, we derive the standard expression for the anion gap:\n$$[Na^+] - ([Cl^-] + [HCO_3^-]) = U.A. - U.C.$$\nTherefore, the standard expression for the serum anion gap is:\n$$AG = [Na^+] - ([Cl^-] + [HCO_3^-])$$\n\nNow, we will compute the value of the anion gap for the given patient using the provided serum values:\n- $[Na^+] = 137.5 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- $[Cl^-] = 101.3 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- $[HCO_3^-] = 8.72 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$AG = 137.5 - (101.3 + 8.72)$$\n$$AG = 137.5 - 110.02$$\n$$AG = 27.48 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$AG \\approx 27.5 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nNext, we must interpret this result in the context of the patient's condition, which is highly suggestive of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) as a complication of Type $1$ Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).\nThe normal range for the serum anion gap is typically $3$ to $11$ mEq/L. The calculated value of $27.5$ mEq/L is markedly elevated, indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\nThis finding is entirely consistent with the accumulation of ketoacids. The pathophysiology of DKA in T1DM stems from an absolute deficiency of insulin. This deficiency has two major metabolic consequences:\n$1.$ Hyperglycemia: Glucose cannot be effectively utilized by peripheral tissues, and the liver engages in unopposed gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This leads to the observed high serum glucose of $450$ mg/dL.\n$2.$ Ketogenesis: Lack of insulin promotes rampant lipolysis, releasing large quantities of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they undergo beta-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. In the low-insulin, high-glucagon state, acetyl-CoA is shunted away from the Krebs cycle and towards the synthesis of ketone bodies: acetoacetic acid ($CH_3COCH_2COOH$) and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid ($CH_3CH(OH)CH_2COOH$).\n\nThese ketoacids are moderately strong acids and dissociate in the blood, releasing hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and their corresponding conjugate bases (keto-anions: acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate).\nThe increase in $[H^+]$ overwhelms the body's buffering capacity, primarily the bicarbonate buffer system ($H^+ + HCO_3^- \\rightarrow H_2CO_3 \\rightarrow H_2O + CO_2$). This consumption of bicarbonate leads to a decrease in serum $[HCO_3^-]$ (as seen in the patient, $8.72$ mEq/L) and a drop in blood $pH$, causing metabolic acidosis ($pH=7.12$). The body attempts to compensate by expelling $CO_2$ through hyperventilation, resulting in the deep, labored breathing (Kussmaul respirations) observed.\n\nCritically, the keto-anions (acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate) are not measured in a standard metabolic panel. They therefore contribute to the \"Unmeasured Anions\" ($U.A.$) term. Their massive accumulation in DKA is precisely what causes the anion gap to widen significantly. The fruity odor on the patient's breath is due to the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetic acid to acetone, which is volatile and exhaled.\n\nIn summary, the calculated high anion gap of $27.5$ mEq/L is a direct biochemical consequence of the accumulation of unmeasured keto-anions in the blood. This result confirms the diagnosis of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and is perfectly consistent with the pathophysiology of Diabetic Ketoacidosis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{27.5}\n$$", "id": "4353642"}, {"introduction": "The severe hyperglycemia in uncontrolled T1DM creates a powerful osmotic force, drawing water out of cells and diluting the sodium in the bloodstream. This effect can mask a patient's true sodium and fluid status, which is critical for guiding intravenous fluid therapy. This practice demonstrates how to calculate the \"corrected\" serum sodium, providing a more accurate picture of the patient's electrolyte balance by accounting for the osmotic effect of glucose [@problem_id:4781164].", "problem": "A $22$-year-old individual with Type $1$ Diabetes Mellitus presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and progressive fatigue. Laboratory evaluation reveals measured serum sodium of $130$ mEq/L and plasma glucose of $600$ mg/dL. In acute hyperglycemia such as diabetic ketoacidosis, osmotic movement of water from the intracellular fluid compartment into the extracellular fluid compartment dilutes extracellular sodium, producing a lower measured serum sodium than the effective sodium concentration at euglycemia. The extracellular fluid osmolality must equal intracellular fluid osmolality at equilibrium, and glucose acts as an effective osmole in the extracellular fluid in this context. Well-tested clinical observations consistent with this osmotic water shift model show that the dilutional fall in measured serum sodium is approximately linear in the rise in plasma glucose above a reference euglycemic value of $100$ mg/dL, with a proportionality coefficient $\\alpha$ of $1.6$ mEq/L per $100$ mg/dL glucose increment.\n\nUsing these principles, determine the corrected serum sodium concentration referenced to a glucose of $100$ mg/dL for this patient. Express your final answer in mEq/L and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the corrected serum sodium concentration in a patient with hyperglycemia. The underlying principle, as stated in the problem, is that an elevated plasma glucose concentration osmotically draws water from the intracellular fluid compartment into the extracellular fluid compartment. This influx of water dilutes the solutes in the extracellular fluid, including sodium ions, leading to a measured serum sodium concentration that is artificially low. This phenomenon is often termed hyperglycemic pseudohyponatremia.\n\nThe problem provides a linear model to correct for this dilutional effect. The corrected serum sodium, which we denote as $Na_{corrected}$, is the estimated sodium concentration that would be measured if the plasma glucose were at a normal, euglycemic level.\n\nLet the measured serum sodium be $Na_{measured}$, the measured plasma glucose be $P_{glucose}$, and the reference euglycemic glucose level be $P_{glucose, ref}$. The problem states that the dilutional fall in measured serum sodium is proportional to the rise in plasma glucose above the reference level. The proportionality coefficient, $\\alpha$, is given.\n\nThe relationship can be formulated as an equation for the corrected sodium concentration. The corrected value is obtained by adding a correction term to the measured value. This correction term accounts for the dilution caused by the excess glucose. The excess glucose concentration is the difference between the measured glucose and the reference glucose: $\\Delta P_{glucose} = P_{glucose} - P_{glucose, ref}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the correction factor, $\\alpha$, is $1.6$ mEq/L for every $100$ mg/dL increment in plasma glucose. Therefore, the total correction to be added to the measured sodium is the product of $\\alpha$ and the number of $100$ mg/dL increments of excess glucose. The number of such increments is given by the ratio $\\frac{P_{glucose} - P_{glucose, ref}}{100}$.\n\nThe formula for the corrected serum sodium concentration is thus:\n$$Na_{corrected} = Na_{measured} + \\alpha \\times \\frac{P_{glucose} - P_{glucose, ref}}{100}$$\n\nThe givens from the problem are:\n- Measured serum sodium, $Na_{measured} = 130$ mEq/L.\n- Measured plasma glucose, $P_{glucose} = 600$ mg/dL.\n- Reference euglycemic glucose, $P_{glucose, ref} = 100$ mg/dL.\n- Proportionality coefficient, $\\alpha = 1.6$ (with implicit units of mEq/L per $100$ mg/dL).\n\nWe substitute these values into the formula. First, we calculate the excess glucose concentration relative to the reference level:\n$$P_{glucose} - P_{glucose, ref} = 600 \\text{ mg/dL} - 100 \\text{ mg/dL} = 500 \\text{ mg/dL}$$\n\nNext, we determine the number of $100$ mg/dL increments this represents:\n$$\\frac{500 \\text{ mg/dL}}{100 \\text{ mg/dL}} = 5$$\n\nNow, we calculate the total correction amount to be added to the measured sodium:\n$$\\text{Correction} = \\alpha \\times 5 = 1.6 \\times 5 = 8.0 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the corrected serum sodium concentration by adding the correction to the measured value:\n$$Na_{corrected} = Na_{measured} + \\text{Correction} = 130 \\text{ mEq/L} + 8.0 \\text{ mEq/L} = 138 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $138$, which already consists of three significant figures ($1$, $3$, and $8$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.

The TDD is based on the patient's body weight and the provided dosing rule.\nLet $W$ be the patient's weight, and $R_{TDD}$ be the dosing rule.\nGiven:\n$W = 70$ kg\n$R_{TDD} = 0.5$ units/(kg·day)\n\nThe TDD is calculated as:\n$$TDD = W \\times R_{TDD} = 70 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.5 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 35 \\text{ units/day}$$\nThe problem states that the basal component, let's call it $D_{basal}$, is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the TDD.\n$$D_{basal} = TDD \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 35 \\text{ units/day} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 17.5 \\text{ units/day}$$\nThis value is already expressed to three significant figures as required.\n\n**2.

High Glucose Correction Dose ($D_{corr}$)**\nThis component aims to lower the premeal blood glucose to the target level.\nGiven:\nPremeal glucose, $G_{premeal} = 220$ mg/dL\nTarget glucose, $G_{target} = 100$ mg/dL\nInsulin Sensitivity Factor, $ISF = 1 \\text{ unit} : 50 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}$ or $50 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{unit}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the required glucose reduction ($\\Delta G$):\n$$\\Delta G = G_{premeal} - G_{target} = 220 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} - 100 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} = 120 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}$$\nThe correction dose is calculated by dividing the required glucose reduction by the amount of glucose reduction per unit of insulin (the ISF).\n$$D_{corr} = \\frac{\\Delta G}{ISF} = \\frac{120 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}}{50 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{unit}}} = 2.4 \\text{ units}$$\n\n**c.
