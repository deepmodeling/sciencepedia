It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in fluid mechanics applied to a biological context. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe flow of a Newtonian fluid under steady, laminar conditions in a cylindrical tube of constant radius is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, the tube geometry, and the fluid viscosity. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the internal radius of the tube, $L$ is its length, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across that length, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nWe will apply this equation to both the baseline (pre-disease) and stenosis (post-disease) states of the coronary artery segment.\n\n**1. Baseline Case:**\nFor the healthy artery segment, the internal radius is given as $r_0$. Let the volumetric flow rate be $Q_{\\text{baseline}}$. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nThe problem states that $\\Delta P$, $\\mu$, and $L$ are constants throughout the analysis.\n\n**2. Stenosis Case:**\nThe problem states that after the development of atherosclerotic plaque, the internal diameter is reduced uniformly by $50\\%$.\nLet the baseline diameter be $d_0$. By definition, $d_0 = 2 r_0$.\nThe new diameter, $d_{\\text{stenosis}}$, is $50\\%$ smaller than the baseline diameter.\n$$d_{\\text{stenosis}} = d_0 - 0.50 d_0 = 0.50 d_0$$\nThe new radius, $r_{\\text{stenosis}}$, is half of the new diameter:\n$$r_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{stenosis}}}{2} = \\frac{0.50 d_0}{2} = 0.50 \\left(\\frac{d_0}{2}\\right) = 0.50 r_0$$\nSo, the radius of the stenotic segment is half of the baseline radius:\n$$r_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{1}{2} r_0$$\nLet the volumetric flow rate through the stenotic segment be $Q_{\\text{stenosis}}$. Since $\\Delta P$, $\\mu$, and $L$ remain unchanged, we apply the Hagen-Poiseuille equation with the new radius:\n$$Q_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{stenosis}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nSubstituting $r_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{1}{2} r_0$:\n$$Q_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2} r_0\\right)^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} = \\frac{\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{16} r_0^4\\right) \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n$$Q_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\\right)$$\nBy comparing this with the equation for the baseline flow, we find the relationship between the two flow rates:\n$$Q_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{1}{16} Q_{\\text{baseline}}$$\n\n**3.

A $50\\%$ reduction in radius leads to a $93.75\\%$ reduction in flow, assuming the pressure drop remains constant.\n\nThe final answer is required to four significant figures.

Express your final answer as a dimensionless number without units.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the fractional flow reserve (FFR) from first principles and its calculation from given pressure measurements. The validation confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing blood flow through the vascular system is analogous to Ohm's law for electrical circuits. This hemodynamic principle states that flow ($Q$) is directly proportional to the pressure difference ($\\Delta P$) across the vascular bed and inversely proportional to the resistance ($R$) of that bed:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\n\nFractional flow reserve (FFR) is defined as the ratio of the maximum possible blood flow through a coronary artery in the presence of a stenosis ($Q_{\\text{stenosis}}$) to the hypothetical maximum flow if that same artery were normal (i.e., without the stenosis, $Q_{\\text{normal}}$). This measurement is standardized under the condition of maximal hyperemia, which is induced pharmacologically to ensure that the microvascular resistance is minimal and constant.\nThe definition is expressed as:\n$$\\text{FFR} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{stenosis}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}}$$\n\nFirst, let us derive an expression for the maximal flow in the stenotic artery, $Q_{\\text{stenosis}}$. The blood flow through the myocardial tissue supplied by the artery is driven by the pressure gradient across the myocardial microcirculation. The pressure at the beginning of this microcirculatory bed is the mean pressure measured distal to the stenosis, $P_d$. The pressure at the end of the coronary venous circulation, where blood returns to the heart, is the right atrial or central venous pressure, $P_v$. Therefore, the driving pressure is $\\Delta P_{\\text{stenosis}} = P_d - P_v$. Let the resistance of the myocardial microvascular bed during maximal hyperemia be $R_{\\text{myo}}$. Applying the fundamental flow principle:\n$$Q_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{\\text{myo}}}$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the hypothetical normal maximal flow, $Q_{\\text{normal}}$. In a hypothetical situation where the stenosis does not exist, there would be no pressure loss along the epicardial coronary artery. Thus, the pressure at the point where $P_d$ was measured would be equal to the mean aortic pressure, $P_a$. The driving pressure across the same myocardial bed would therefore be $\\Delta P_{\\text{normal}} = P_a - P_v$. Since the condition is still maximal hyperemia, the microvascular resistance remains $R_{\\text{myo}}$. The hypothetical normal flow is:\n$$Q_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{\\text{myo}}}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the definition of FFR. The crucial insight is that under maximal hyperemia, the myocardial resistance $R_{\\text{myo}}$ is assumed to be the same in both the stenotic and the hypothetical normal states.\n$$\\text{FFR} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{stenosis}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{\\text{myo}}}}{\\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{\\text{myo}}}}$$\nThe term for myocardial resistance, $R_{\\text{myo}}$, cancels out, yielding the expression for FFR purely in terms of the measured pressures:\n$$\\text{FFR} = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{P_a - P_v}$$\nThis is the expression for FFR derived from first principles. It should be noted that a common clinical simplification approximates FFR as $\\frac{P_d}{P_a}$ by assuming that $P_v$ is negligible ($P_v \\approx 0$). However, the problem provides a non-zero $P_v$ and asks for a derivation from first principles, making the complete formula the correct one to use.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of FFR using the given data:\n- Mean proximal aortic pressure, $P_a = 92\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Mean distal coronary pressure, $P_d = 68\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Mean right atrial pressure, $P_v = 12\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\text{FFR} = \\frac{68 - 12}{92 - 12} = \\frac{56}{80}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\text{FFR} = 0.7$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value is $0.7000$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if the stenosis is hemodynamically significant. The evidence-based threshold for revascularization is an FFR less than or equal to $0.80$. Our calculated FFR is $0.7000$.
