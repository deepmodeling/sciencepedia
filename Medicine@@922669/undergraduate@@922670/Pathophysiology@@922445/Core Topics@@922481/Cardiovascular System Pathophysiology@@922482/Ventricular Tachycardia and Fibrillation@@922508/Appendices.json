Initially, this proximity means that a smaller stimulus is needed to depolarize the cell to threshold, thus increasing myocyte excitability. This can lead to ectopic beats and re-entrant arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia.\n3.  **Impact on Conduction**: The persistent depolarization has a second, crucial effect: it leads to the steady-state inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels ($Na_v$). A fraction of these channels enters an inactivated state from which they cannot be opened by a subsequent depolarization. With fewer available $Na_v$ channels, the upstroke velocity (phase $0$) of the action potential decreases significantly. According to cable theory, conduction velocity is proportional to the rate of rise of the action potential. Therefore, a slower upstroke leads to a slowing of conduction velocity. In severe hyperkalemia, profound $Na_v$ channel inactivation can render the myocardium inexcitable, leading to conduction block and asystole. This slowing of conduction is a key mechanism by which hyperkalemia promotes re-entrant circuits, which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.\n\nIn summary, the rise in extracellular potassium depolarizes the resting membrane potential, which has a dual effect of initially increasing excitability while simultaneously slowing conduction and potentially leading to a loss of excitability.

It also mandates the use of the kinematic identity that distance equals speed multiplied by time.\n\nLet's map the variables to this identity:\n-   Distance = Electrical Wavelength, $\\lambda$.\n-   Speed = Conduction Velocity, $\\text{CV}$.\n-   Time = Effective Refractory Period, $\\text{ERP}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the identity, we obtain the expression for the electrical wavelength:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\text{CV} \\times \\text{ERP}\n$$\n\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Electrical Wavelength ($\\lambda$)**\n\nWe are given the values for the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period:\n-   $\\text{CV} = 0.3 \\text{ m/s}$\n-   $\\text{ERP} = 200 \\text{ ms}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency in the calculation, the effective refractory period must be converted from milliseconds ($\\text{ms}$) to seconds ($\\text{s}$).\n$$\n\\text{ERP} = 200 \\text{ ms} = 200 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s} = 0.2 \\text{ s}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = (0.3 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (0.2 \\text{ s})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = 0.06 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe electrical wavelength is $0.06$ meters.\n\n**Part 3: Deduction of the Minimum Circuit Path Length ($L_{min}$)**\n\nThe problem provides the criterion for sustained reentry: the circuit path length, $L$, must exceed the electrical wavelength, $\\lambda$. This can be written as an inequality:\n$$\nL > \\lambda\n$$\n\nThis condition is necessary because for a reentrant wave to propagate continuously around the ring, the wavefront must encounter tissue that has fully recovered from its previous excitation. The \"tail\" of the wave, where the tissue is refractory, has a length equal to the wavelength, $\\lambda$. Therefore, the total length of the circuit, $L$, must be greater than this refractory tail length, $\\lambda$, to provide a \"gap\" of excitable tissue for the wavefront to re-excite.\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* circuit path length required for sustained reentry. Mathematically, the set of all possible path lengths $L$ that sustain reentry is the open interval $(\\lambda, \\infty)$. The infimum, or greatest lower bound, of this set is $\\lambda$. In the context of physics and physiology, this boundary value is considered the critical or minimum required length. At a path length of exactly $\\lambda$, the wavefront would arrive at a point just as it exits its refractory period, representing the borderline case. Any length infinitesimally greater than $\\lambda$ allows for sustained reentry. Therefore, we define the minimum required path length, $L_{min}$, as this critical value.\n$$\nL_{min} = \\lambda\n$$\n\nUsing the value of $\\lambda$ calculated in Part 2:\n$$\nL_{min} = 0.06 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe minimum circuit path length required for sustained reentry in this model is $0.06$ meters.
