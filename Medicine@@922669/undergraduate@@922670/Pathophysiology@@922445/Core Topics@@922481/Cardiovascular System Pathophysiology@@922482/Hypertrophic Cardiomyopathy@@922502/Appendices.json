The governing principle for an ideal fluid (inviscid, incompressible) in steady flow is Bernoulli's equation, which states that the total mechanical energy per unit volume is constant along a streamline.\n\nThe full Bernoulli equation is:\n$$ P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho g h = \\text{constant} $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height.\n\nWe apply this equation between two points along a streamline: point $1$ in the left ventricle, proximal (upstream) to the obstruction, and point $2$ at the narrowest section of the LVOT where the jet velocity is maximal.\n\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2 $$\n\nThe problem provides several simplifying assumptions:\n$1$. \"height differences across the LVOT are negligible\". This implies $h_1 \\approx h_2$, so the potential energy terms $\\rho g h_1$ and $\\rho g h_2$ cancel each other out.\n$2$. \"upstream flow velocity proximal to the obstruction is small relative to the jet velocity\". This allows us to approximate the proximal velocity $v_1$ as zero ($v_1 \\approx 0$). This is a reasonable assumption because the cross-sectional area of the LV chamber is much larger than that of the stenotic LVOT, and by the continuity equation ($A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$), $v_1$ must be much smaller than $v_2$.\n\nApplying these simplifications to the Bernoulli equation:\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (0)^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\n$$ P_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"instantaneous LVOT pressure gradient,\" which is the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, between the upstream and constricted points: $\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$.\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\n\nThe given peak systolic jet velocity is $v = 4.5\\,\\text{m/s}$, which corresponds to $v_2$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation and calculation proceed as follows.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Pressure Gradient Expression**\n\nThe problem asks to start from the Bernoulli principle for steady, incompressible flow. The Bernoulli equation relates pressure ($P$), velocity ($v$), and height ($z$) between two points (point A, proximal to the obstruction, and point B, at the site of the high-velocity jet) along a streamline:\n$$\nP_A + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2 + \\rho g z_A = P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_B^2 + \\rho g z_B\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the static pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the vertical height.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  **Negligible differences in height**: The LVOT is oriented nearly horizontally, so we can assume $z_A \\approx z_B$. This allows the potential energy terms, $\\rho g z_A$ and $\\rho g z_B$, to be cancelled from the equation:\n    $$\n    P_A + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2 = P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_B^2\n    $$\n2.  **Negligible proximal velocity**: The velocity in the main chamber of the left ventricle (point A) is much smaller than the jet velocity through the narrow obstruction (point B). Thus, we can approximate the proximal velocity $v_A \\approx 0$. The kinetic energy term $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2$ becomes negligible.\n\nLet $v_B$ be the measured peak jet velocity, which we will denote simply as $v$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nP_A \\approx P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2\n$$\nThe pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, across the LVOT is defined as the difference between the proximal pressure (in the left ventricle, $P_A$) and the pressure within the jet (in the LVOT, $P_B$).\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_A - P_B\n$$\nSubstituting the simplified Bernoulli relation, we derive the expression for the pressure gradient in terms of the jet velocity:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2\n$$\nThis is the simplified Bernoulli equation commonly used in echocardiography to estimate pressure gradients from Doppler velocity measurements.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Pressure Gradient**\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in the peak instantaneous LVOT pressure gradient, $\\Delta(\\Delta P)$, due to the Valsalva maneuver.

This rise in pressure impedes venous return to the right atrium, subsequently reducing filling of a non-compliant left ventricle. This reduction in left ventricular preload (end-diastolic volume) is a key factor in the hemodynamics of obstructive HCM. In this condition, the LVOT obstruction is dynamic, caused by the systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve leaflet toward a hypertrophied interventricular septum. A smaller, underfilled left ventricle brings the septum and mitral leaflet into closer proximity, which exacerbates SAM and worsens the functional obstruction. The increased obstruction requires the ventricle to generate a higher pressure to eject blood, leading to a higher velocity jet through the narrowed outflow tract. The calculation confirms this principle: the reduction in preload from the Valsalva maneuver increased the jet velocity from $3.5\\,\\text{m/s}$ to $4.5\\,\\text{m/s}$, resulting in a clinically significant augmentation of the peak pressure gradient by $31.8\\,\\text{mmHg}$.

The chamber is under a uniform internal pressure $P$ relative to the outside (transmural pressure). To find the circumferential stress $\\sigma$ in the wall, we consider the equilibrium of forces acting on one hemisphere.\n\nImagine dividing the sphere into two hemispheres. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$ pushing the two hemispheres apart is equal to the pressure multiplied by the projected area of the cut, which is a circle of area $\\pi r^2$.\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = P \\cdot A_{\\text{circle}} = P (\\pi r^2)$$\nThis outward force is balanced by the internal tensile force within the material of the wall. This force acts on the cross-sectional area of the wall along the cut. For a thin wall ($h \\ll r$), this cross-sectional area can be approximated as the circumference of the cut multiplied by the wall thickness.\n$$A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx (2\\pi r)h$$\nThe total tensile force in the wall is the product of the average wall stress $\\sigma$ and this cross-sectional area.\n$$F_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nFor the sphere to be in equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = F_{\\text{wall}}$$\n$$P (\\pi r^2) = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nWe can now solve for the wall stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P (\\pi r^2)}{2\\pi r h}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common factors ($\\pi$ and $r$) yields the relationship known as Laplace's law for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$$\nThis is the required relationship between wall stress $\\sigma$, pressure $P$, radius $r$, and thickness $h$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Wall Stress ($\\Delta \\sigma$)**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Pressure: $P = 120\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Radius: $r = 2.5\\,\\text{cm}$\n- Initial thickness: $h_{\\text{initial}} = 1.2\\,\\text{cm}$\n- Final thickness: $h_{\\text{final}} = 1.8\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nThe problem states that $P$ and $r$ remain constant.
