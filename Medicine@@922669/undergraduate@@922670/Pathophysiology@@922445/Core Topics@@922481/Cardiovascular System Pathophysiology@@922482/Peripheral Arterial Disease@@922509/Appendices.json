The validation criteria are met.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which interstitial pH reaches a nociceptor activation threshold. The derivation must start from mass conservation and the definition of buffer capacity.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the molar amount (in mmol) of excess protons that have accumulated in the interstitial compartment at time $t$ relative to the baseline state at $\\mathrm{pH}_0$. The initial condition is that at $t=0$, there is zero net excess proton content, so $N(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Conservation**\nThe principle of mass conservation for the excess protons in the well-mixed compartment is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of proton generation}) - (\\text{Rate of proton removal}) $$\nThe problem states a constant net proton generation rate, $r_{\\mathrm{prod}}$. The removal process is first-order with respect to the amount of excess protons, with a rate constant $k$.
