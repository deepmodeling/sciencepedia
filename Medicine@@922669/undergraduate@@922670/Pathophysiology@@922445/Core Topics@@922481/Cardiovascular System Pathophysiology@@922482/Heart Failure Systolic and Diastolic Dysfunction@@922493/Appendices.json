Stroke Volume ($\\text{SV}$)**\nStroke volume is defined as the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle in a single contraction. It is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume.\n$$\n\\text{SV} = \\text{EDV} - \\text{ESV}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{SV} = 160\\,\\text{mL} - 110\\,\\text{mL} = 50\\,\\text{mL}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{SV} = 50.00\\,\\text{mL}\n$$\n\n**2. Ejection Fraction ($\\text{EF}$)**\nEjection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected during systole. It is a key index of ventricular contractility.\n$$\n\\text{EF} = \\frac{\\text{SV}}{\\text{EDV}}\n$$\nUsing the calculated value for $\\text{SV}$ and the given value for $\\text{EDV}$:\n$$\n\\text{EF} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{mL}}{160\\,\\text{mL}} = 0.3125\n$$\nThis value is unitless, as required. It is already expressed with four significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary. A normal $\\text{EF}$ is typically greater than $0.55$, so this value is consistent with the diagnosis of systolic heart failure.\n\n**3. Stroke Work ($W$)**\nStroke work is the external mechanical work performed by the ventricle during one cardiac cycle. It can be graphically represented by the area of the pressure-volume (PV) loop. A common and reasonable approximation for the area of this loop is the product of the stroke volume and the mean pressure against which the blood is ejected. The pressure component is not simply the mean arterial pressure, but the net pressure generated by the ventricle during ejection. This is the difference between the afterload (approximated by $\\text{MAP}$) and the preload (the pressure in the ventricle at the start of ejection, which is approximated by the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, LVEDP).\n\nThe problem provides the Central Venous Pressure ($\\text{CVP}$). While $\\text{CVP}$ directly reflects right atrial pressure, in the absence of more specific left-sided pressure data (such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), it is used in this context as the only available surrogate for LVEDP. Therefore, the net pressure is approximated as $\\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}$.\n$$\nW \\approx (\\text{Mean Ejection Pressure} - \\text{Preload Pressure}) \\times \\text{SV}\n$$\n$$\nW \\approx (\\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}) \\times \\text{SV}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values and the calculated $\\text{SV}$:\n$$\nW \\approx (90\\,\\text{mmHg} - 10\\,\\text{mmHg}) \\times 50\\,\\text{mL}\n$$\n$$\nW \\approx 80\\,\\text{mmHg} \\times 50\\,\\text{mL} = 4000\\,\\text{mmHg}\\cdot\\text{mL}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.
