In this territory, oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria stops abruptly due to loss of oxygen delivery, while cytosolic glycolysis continues, powered by pre-existing glycogen and maintained nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) regeneration. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis powers cross-bridge cycling and ion pumps; creatine kinase (CK) rapidly and reversibly transfers phosphate between phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), effectively buffering ATP on the time scale of seconds. Assume the following, all per gram of ischemic myocardium:\n- At the onset of ischemia, ATP content is $8$ µmol g$^{-1}$ and PCr content is $16$ µmol g$^{-1}$.\n- The ongoing ATP utilization rate (mechanical plus basal) is constant at $0.40$ µmol g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Oxidative phosphorylation contributes $0$ µmol g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ after ischemia onset in this territory.\n- Glycolysis continuously supplies ATP at a constant rate of $0.10$ µmol g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ over the time interval of interest (assume glycogen and redox balance are sufficient so that this rate is sustained).\n- Contractile failure in this territory is defined to occur when ATP content falls to $5$ µmol g$^{-1}$; below this threshold, cross-bridge cycling cannot be maintained.\n\nUse conservation of high-energy phosphate equivalents and the CK buffering property to derive from first principles the time required for ATP to reach the failure threshold after the onset of ischemia. Treat CK as fast enough to maintain ATP at its pre-ischemic level until PCr is exhausted, after which ATP alone declines. Ignore any volume changes, metabolite leakage, or changes in ATP utilization rate over this time scale.\n\nWhat is the time to contractile failure, expressed in seconds?

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in quantitative pathophysiology, grounded in the established principles of muscle bioenergetics during ischemia.\n\nThe solution is found by applying the principle of conservation of energy, specifically focusing on the high-energy phosphate bonds stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr). We begin by defining symbolic variables for the quantities provided in the problem statement:\n-   Initial ATP concentration: $[\\text{ATP}]_0 = 8~\\text{µmol g}^{-1}$\n-   Initial PCr concentration: $[\\text{PCr}]_0 = 16~\\text{µmol g}^{-1}$\n-   ATP utilization rate: $k_{util} = 0.40~\\text{µmol g}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   Glycolytic ATP production rate: $k_{glyc} = 0.10~\\text{µmol g}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   ATP concentration at contractile failure: $[\\text{ATP}]_{fail} = 5~\\text{µmol g}^{-1}$\n\nIn the described ischemic condition, ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation is zero. The net rate at which ATP is being consumed, which must be balanced by the cell's finite high-energy phosphate reserves, is the deficit rate, denoted $k_{deficit}$. This rate is the difference between the total utilization rate and the ongoing glycolytic production rate.\n$$k_{deficit} = k_{util} - k_{glyc} = 0.40~\\text{µmol g}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1} - 0.10~\\text{µmol g}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.30~\\text{µmol g}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem specifies a simplified model wherein the creatine kinase (CK) system acts as a perfect buffer, maintaining the ATP concentration constant until the PCr reserve is completely depleted. This description partitions the process into two distinct, sequential phases. The total time to contractile failure, $T_{fail}$, is the sum of the durations of these two phases.\n\n**Phase 1: PCr Depletion**\nDuring this initial phase, the concentration of ATP is held constant at its initial level, $[\\text{ATP}]_0$. The CK reaction ($[\\text{PCr}] + [\\text{ADP}] \\leftrightarrow [\\text{Cr}] + [\\text{ATP}]$) immediately replenishes any consumed ATP by converting PCr. Therefore, the PCr concentration must decline at a rate exactly equal to the ATP deficit rate, $k_{deficit}$.\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{PCr}]}{dt} = -k_{deficit}$$\nThe duration of this phase, $t_1$, is the time required to deplete the entire initial PCr pool, from $[\\text{PCr}]_0$ to $0$.\n$$t_1 = \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]_0}{k_{deficit}} = \\frac{16}{0.30}~\\text{s}$$\n\n**Phase 2: ATP Depletion**\nThis phase commences the instant that PCr is fully exhausted. The CK buffer is now gone. The ATP concentration, starting from $[\\text{ATP}]_0$, begins to fall. The rate of ATP decline is governed by the net deficit between utilization and glycolytic production.\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{ATP}]}{dt} = k_{glyc} - k_{util} = -k_{deficit}$$\nThis phase continues until the ATP concentration reaches the contractile failure threshold, $[\\text{ATP}]_{fail}$. The total change in ATP concentration required for this is $[\\text{ATP}]_0 - [\\text{ATP}]_{fail}$. The duration of Phase 2, $t_2$, is therefore:\n$$t_2 = \\frac{[\\text{ATP}]_0 - [\\text{ATP}]_{fail}}{k_{deficit}} = \\frac{8 - 5}{0.30}~\\text{s} = \\frac{3}{0.30}~\\text{s}$$\n\n**Total Time to Contractile Failure**\nThe total time to failure, $T_{fail}$, is the sum of the durations of the two phases, $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n$$T_{fail} = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]_0}{k_{deficit}} + \\frac{[\\text{ATP}]_0 - [\\text{ATP}]_{fail}}{k_{deficit}}$$\nThis can be combined into a single expression that represents the depletion of the total available high-energy phosphate reserve (all of the PCr plus the portion of the ATP pool above the failure threshold) at the net deficit rate:\n$$T_{fail} = \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]_0 + [\\text{ATP}]_0 - [\\text{ATP}]_{fail}}{k_{deficit}}$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$T_{fail} = \\frac{16 + 8 - 5}{0.30}~\\text{s} = \\frac{19}{0.30}~\\text{s} \\approx 63.333...~\\text{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$T_{fail} \\approx 63.3~\\text{s}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63.3}$$", "id": "4759120"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the \"demand\" side of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand equation is crucial in managing acute coronary syndromes.

The Law of Laplace is a standard, albeit simplified, model used to describe the relationship between pressure, radius, and wall tension in hollow organs. The provided form, $T = \\dfrac{P \\cdot r}{2 h}$, is a common approximation for average circumferential stress in a thick-walled sphere. The link between wall stress and $MVO_2$ is a cornerstone of cardiovascular pathophysiology, as wall stress is a primary determinant of myocardial energy demand.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical values ($P_1, r_1, h_1, P_2, r_2, h_2$) and the explicit formula required to calculate the change in wall stress. The question follows directly from the calculated result and the given physiological principle.\n- **Objective**: The language is clinical and objective. The values, while representing a state of severe physiological stress, are within a plausible range for an acute cardiac event.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The simplifying assumption that wall thickness ($h$) remains constant is explicitly stated. While in a real physical system, an increase in radius would likely be accompanied by some decrease in wall thickness to conserve myocardial volume, the problem's instruction to hold it constant is a standard pedagogical simplification that makes the problem solvable with the given data. It is an instruction, not a contradiction.\n- **Realism**: The scenario of sympathetic surges leading to simultaneous increases in blood pressure (afterload) and ventricular volume (due to potential stunning or volume shifts) is clinically realistic in the context of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a scientifically and physiologically sound scenario that can be analyzed using the provided model and data. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the factor by which the LV wall stress ($T$) changes and to infer the consequence for myocardial oxygen consumption ($MVO_2$).\n\nThe wall stress is given by the formula $T = \\dfrac{P \\cdot r}{2 h}$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial wall stress ($T_1$)**:\n    Using the initial state values: $P_1 = 120\\ \\text{mmHg}$, $r_1 = 3.0\\ \\text{cm}$, and $h_1 = 1.2\\ \\text{cm}$.\n    $$T_1 = \\frac{P_1 \\cdot r_1}{2 h_1} = \\frac{(120\\ \\text{mmHg}) \\cdot (3.0\\ \\text{cm})}{2 \\cdot (1.2\\ \\text{cm})} = \\frac{360}{2.4}\\ \\text{mmHg} = 150\\ \\text{mmHg}$$\n    Note: The units of stress here are unconventional ($\\text{mmHg}$), but since we are calculating a dimensionless ratio, the units will cancel.\n\n2.  **Calculate the final wall stress ($T_2$)**:\n    Using the final state values: $P_2 = 180\\ \\text{mmHg}$, $r_2 = 3.6\\ \\text{cm}$, and $h_2 = 1.2\\ \\text{cm}$.\n    $$T_2 = \\frac{P_2 \\cdot r_2}{2 h_2} = \\frac{(180\\ \\text{mmHg}) \\cdot (3.6\\ \\text{cm})}{2 \\cdot (1.2\\ \\text{cm})} = \\frac{648}{2.4}\\ \\text{mmHg} = 270\\ \\text{mmHg}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the factor of change in wall stress**:\n    The factor of change is the ratio of the final stress to the initial stress, $\\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}$.\n    $$\\text{Factor of change} = \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{270\\ \\text{mmHg}}{150\\ \\text{mmHg}} = \\frac{27}{15} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8$$\n    The LV wall stress increases by a factor of $1.8$.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio can be calculated symbolically:\n$$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2 \\cdot r_2 / (2 h_2)}{P_1 \\cdot r_1 / (2 h_1)}$$\nSince $h_1 = h_2$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\cdot \\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\left(\\frac{180}{120}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3.6}{3.0}\\right) = (1.5) \\cdot (1.2) = 1.8$$\n\n4.  **Analyze the change in Myocardial Oxygen Consumption ($MVO_2$)**:\n    The problem states that \"myocardial oxygen consumption ($MVO_2$) per unit time increases when wall stress per beat increases\". Since the wall stress has significantly increased (by a factor of $1.8$), the myocardial oxygen demand ($MVO_2$) is predicted to increase. This is because the heart muscle must generate more force to overcome the higher stress, which requires more ATP hydrolysis and thus more oxygen.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Wall stress increases by a factor of $1.5$; $MVO_2$ remains unchanged because heart rate is constant.**\n- The calculated factor of increase in wall stress is $1.8$, not $1.5$. The value $1.5$ is only the factor of pressure increase.\n- The reasoning for $MVO_2$ is flawed. The problem explicitly states that $MVO_2$ increases with wall stress, even for a given heart rate.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Wall stress increases by a factor of $1.8$; $MVO_2$ increases due to greater wall stress at a constant heart rate.**\n- The calculated factor of increase in wall stress is $1.8$, which is correct.\n- The reasoning for $MVO_2$ is correct. Increased wall stress is a primary driver of increased $MVO_2$. The option correctly applies the physiological principle provided in the problem statement. The mention of constant heart rate is a condition under which the principle holds, and it isolates wall stress as the cause.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Wall stress increases by a factor of $2.25$; $MVO_2$ decreases because stroke work falls when the ventricle dilates.**\n- The calculated factor of increase in wall stress is $1.8$, not $2.25$. The value $2.25$ is $(1.5)^2$, which is an erroneous calculation.\n- The reasoning for $MVO_2$ is physiologically incorrect. $MVO_2$ is more strongly dependent on wall stress than on external stroke work. A dilated, failing heart is notably inefficient, with high $MVO_2$ for a given amount of work. The claim that $MVO_2$ would decrease is contrary to established principles.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Wall stress does not change because wall thickness is unchanged; $MVO_2$ remains unchanged.**\n- The initial premise is false. Wall stress depends on pressure ($P$) and radius ($r$) in addition to wall thickness ($h$). Since both $P$ and $r$ increased, wall stress must increase.\n- The conclusion about $MVO_2$ is based on this false premise.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Wall stress increases by a factor of $3.0$; $MVO_2$ increases only if contractility also increases.**\n- The calculated factor of increase in wall stress is $1.8$, not $3.0$.\n- The reasoning for $MVO_2$ is flawed. The problem specifies that $MVO_2$ increases with wall stress \"for a given contractility,\" meaning an increase in wall stress alone is sufficient to raise $MVO_2$. The word \"only\" makes the statement incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the calculations and physiological principles, option B is the only one that presents both a correct calculation and a correct physiological interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4759088"}, {"introduction": "The heart's ability to function is critically dependent on a consistent supply of oxygen, a process vulnerable to systemic conditions like anemia.

The oxygen extraction fraction, $E$, is defined as the proportion of oxygen removed from the blood as it passes through the myocardium:\n$$E = \\frac{C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2}}{C_{aO_2}}$$\nRearranging this, the arteriovenous oxygen difference can be expressed as $(C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2}) = E \\cdot C_{aO_2}$. Substituting this into the Fick equation yields:\n$$V\\!O_2 = Q \\cdot E \\cdot C_{aO_2}$$\nMaximal sustainable oxygen consumption, $V\\!O_2^{\\max}$, is achieved when both blood flow and oxygen extraction are maximized. In this scenario, flow is limited to $Q_{\\text{stress}}$ and extraction is limited to $E_{\\max}$. Thus:\n$$V\\!O_2^{\\max} = Q_{\\text{stress}} \\cdot E_{\\max} \\cdot C_{aO_2}$$\nNext, we must formalize the expression for $C_{aO_2}$ in terms of hemoglobin concentration, $[Hb]$. The arterial oxygen content is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma. Oxygen content is typically measured in mL of O₂ per dL of blood.\n$$C_{aO_2} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL blood}}\\right] = (\\text{O}_2\\text{-binding capacity}) \\cdot [Hb] \\cdot S_{aO_2} + (\\text{O}_2\\text{ solubility}) \\cdot P_{aO_2}$$\nSubstituting the given constants:\n$$C_{aO_2} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL blood}}\\right] = 1.34 \\cdot [Hb] \\cdot S_{aO_2} + 0.003 \\cdot P_{aO_2}$$\nThe units for $V\\!O_2$ and $Q$ are per minute per $100$ g of tissue, with flow in mL of blood. For dimensional consistency in the Fick equation, $C_{aO_2}$ must be in units of mL O₂ per mL of blood. We convert from per dL to per mL by dividing by $100$:\n$$C_{aO_2} \\left[\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{mL blood}}\\right] = \\frac{1}{100} \\left( 1.34 \\cdot [Hb] \\cdot S_{aO_2} + 0.003 \\cdot P_{aO_2} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{aO_2}$ into the equation for $V\\!O_2^{\\max}$ gives the final derived expression:\n$$V\\!O_2^{\\max} = Q_{\\text{stress}} \\cdot E_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} \\left( 1.34 \\cdot [Hb] \\cdot S_{aO_2} + 0.003 \\cdot P_{aO_2} \\right)$$\n\n**Task 2: Compute the minimum hemoglobin concentration, $[Hb]_{\\min}$**\n\nIschemia occurs when myocardial oxygen demand ($V\\!O_2^{\\text{req}}$) exceeds maximal oxygen supply ($V\\!O_2^{\\max}$).

In the context of a flow-limiting coronary stenosis, the heart cannot compensate for this reduced oxygen content by increasing blood flow ($Q$) beyond $Q_{\\text{stress}}$. Consequently, the maximal rate of oxygen delivery to the myocardium, $V\\!O_2^{\\max}$, is lowered. If $V\\!O_2^{\\max}$ falls below the oxygen demand imposed by exertion, $V\\!O_2^{\\text{req}}$, an oxygen supply-demand mismatch occurs, leading to myocardial ischemia. Therefore, anemia critically increases ischemic risk in patients with fixed coronary artery disease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.81}$$", "id": "4759139"}]}
