The clinical context of DCM is well-established. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data for the required calculations.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of two key hemodynamic parameters, the stroke volume ($SV$) and the ejection fraction ($EF$), followed by a pathophysiological interpretation.\n\n1.  **Calculation of Stroke Volume ($SV$)**\n    The stroke volume is defined as the volume of blood ejected from a ventricle during one contraction (systole). It is calculated as the difference between the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole ($EDV$) and the volume remaining at the end of systole ($ESV$). The fundamental definition is:\n    $$SV = EDV - ESV$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$SV = 180\\,\\text{mL} - 120\\,\\text{mL} = 60\\,\\text{mL}$$\n    The calculated stroke volume is $60\\,\\text{mL}$.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Ejection Fraction ($EF$)**\n    The ejection fraction is a measure of the heart's pumping efficiency. It represents the fraction (or percentage) of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat. The definition is:\n    $$EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $SV$:\n    $$EF = \\frac{EDV - ESV}{EDV}$$\n    Using the given values and the previously calculated $SV$:\n    $$EF = \\frac{60\\,\\text{mL}}{180\\,\\text{mL}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n    As a decimal, this is $EF \\approx 0.3333...$. The problem requires rounding to three significant figures, which yields:\n    $$EF \\approx 0.333$$\n\n**Pathophysiological Interpretation**\n\nThe final part of the task is to interpret these findings in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and assess the severity of systolic dysfunction.\n\n1.  **Consistency with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)**\n    - **End-Diastolic Volume ($EDV$)**: A normal left ventricular $EDV$ in an adult is typically in the range of $100-160\\,\\text{mL}$. The measured value of $180\\,\\text{mL}$ is significantly elevated. This indicates ventricular dilatation (enlargement), which is the cardinal feature of dilated cardiomyopathy. The term \"dilated\" directly refers to this increase in chamber volume.\n    - **End-Systolic Volume ($ESV$)**: A normal left ventricular $ESV$ is typically around $30-60\\,\\text{mL}$. The measured value of $120\\,\\text{mL}$ is markedly elevated. A high $ESV$ is a direct consequence of impaired myocardial contractility (systolic dysfunction), as the ventricle is unable to empty effectively.\n    - **Ejection Fraction ($EF$)**: A normal $EF$ is generally considered to be $\\ge 0.55$ (or $55\\%$). The calculated $EF$ of $0.333$ is severely reduced. This is a hallmark of systolic heart failure. HFrEF (Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction) is diagnosed when $EF \\le 0.40$.\n\n    In summary, the combination of a high $EDV$ (dilatation) and a severely reduced $EF$ (systolic dysfunction) is precisely the pathophysiological signature of dilated cardiomyopathy. The findings are highly consistent with the suspected diagnosis.\n\n2.  **Inference of Clinical Severity**\n    The ejection fraction is a primary metric for staging the severity of systolic heart failure and for determining prognosis.\n    - $EF  0.50$: Normal function.\n    - $EF = 0.41 - 0.49$: Mildly reduced systolic function (HFmrEF).\n    - $EF = 0.30 - 0.40$: Moderately reduced systolic function (HFrEF).\n    - $EF  0.30$: Severely reduced systolic function (HFrEF).\n\n    The calculated $EF$ of $0.333$ places the patient in the category of moderately to severely reduced systolic function. Clinically, an $EF$ below $0.35$ is a critical threshold associated with a significantly increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Such patients are typically evaluated for primary prevention with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Therefore, the findings indicate a **severe degree of clinical severity** in terms of systolic dysfunction, warranting aggressive medical management and risk stratification for life-threatening events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.333}$$", "id": "4783356"}, {"introduction": "A failing heart does not operate in isolation; the cardiovascular system has powerful compensatory mechanisms. Given the reduced stroke volume characteristic of DCM, how does the body maintain adequate blood flow to the organs, at least at rest?

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution will be structured by first deriving the analytical expressions for stroke volume ($SV$) and cardiac output ($CO$) from the provided definitions, then substituting the given numerical values to compute them, and finally interpreting the results in the context of the patient's condition and the provided reference range.\n\n**1. Derivation and Calculation of Stroke Volume ($SV$)**\nThe problem defines stroke volume as the net volume of blood ejected from a ventricle during a single cardiac cycle. The volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of filling (diastole) is the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$. The volume remaining after contraction (systole) is the end-systolic volume, $ESV$. The difference between these two volumes is the volume ejected. Therefore, the expression for stroke volume is:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$SV = 200\\,\\text{mL} - 150\\,\\text{mL} = 50\\,\\text{mL}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The calculated value is $50\\,\\text{mL}$, which, when expressed to three significant figures, is $50.0\\,\\text{mL}$.\n$$SV = 50.0\\,\\text{mL}$$\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Cardiac Output ($CO$)**\nThe problem defines cardiac output as the volumetric flow per unit time, given by the product of the volume ejected per beat and the number of beats per unit time. The volume ejected per beat is the stroke volume, $SV$. The number of beats per unit time is the heart rate, $HR$. Thus, the expression for cardiac output is:\n$$CO = SV \\times HR$$\nUsing the calculated value of $SV$ and the given $HR$:\n$$SV = 50\\,\\text{mL/beat}$$\n$$HR = 90\\,\\text{beats/min}$$\nThe cardiac output in units of $\\text{mL/min}$ is:\n$$CO = (50\\,\\text{mL/beat}) \\times (90\\,\\text{beats/min}) = 4500\\,\\text{mL/min}$$\nThe problem requires the cardiac output to be expressed in liters per minute ($\\text{L/min}$). The conversion factor is $1\\,\\text{L} = 1000\\,\\text{mL}$.\n$$CO = 4500\\,\\text{mL/min} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{L}}{1000\\,\\text{mL}} = 4.5\\,\\text{L/min}$$\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives:\n$$CO = 4.50\\,\\text{L/min}$$\n\n**3. Interpretation of Results**\nThe calculated cardiac output for the patient is $4.50\\,\\text{L/min}$. The typical resting range for an adult is provided as $4$ to $8\\,\\text{L/min}$. The patient's cardiac output falls at the lower boundary of this normal range.\n\nIn dilated cardiomyopathy, the ejection fraction, defined as $EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV}$, is significantly reduced due to impaired contractility. For this patient, $EF = \\frac{50\\,\\text{mL}}{200\\,\\text{mL}} = 0.25$, or $25\\%$, which is severely low (a normal $EF$ is typically $ 55\\%$). The low stroke volume ($50.0\\,\\text{mL}$ compared to a normal of $\\approx 70\\,\\text{mL}$) is a direct consequence of this poor contractility.\n\nTo maintain adequate systemic blood flow (i.e., cardiac output), the cardiovascular system compensates for the low $SV$ by increasing the heart rate. This patient's heart rate of $90\\,\\text{beats/min}$ is elevated above a typical resting rate (e.g., $60-80\\,\\text{beats/min}$), a condition known as sinus tachycardia. This compensatory mechanism has successfully maintained the resting cardiac output within the low-normal range ($4.50\\,\\text{L/min}$).\n\nConclusion on perfusion: At rest, systemic perfusion is likely to be minimally adequate. However, the patient's cardiac reserve (the ability to increase $CO$ in response to increased metabolic demand, such as exercise) is severely limited. The heart rate is already high, and the impaired ventricle cannot significantly increase its stroke volume. Therefore, any physical exertion would likely lead to an inability to meet the body's oxygen demand, resulting in symptoms of heart failure (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue). The resting state is being maintained at the cost of high cardiac work and minimal reserve capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 50.0  4.50 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4783396"}, {"introduction": "To understand why dilated cardiomyopathy is often a progressive disease, we must look beyond blood volumes and flows to the mechanical forces acting within the heart muscle itself. The Law of Laplace provides a powerful, though simplified, model to quantify ventricular wall stress.

Consider the LV approximated as a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel with uniform transmural pressure.

This model approximates the left ventricle. Let the internal chamber radius be $r$, the wall thickness be $h$, and the uniform internal pressure be $P$.\n\nWe analyze the forces acting on a hemisphere of this vessel. The internal pressure $P$ exerts a force that tends to separate the two halves of the sphere. The total force due to this pressure, $F_P$, can be calculated by integrating the pressure over the internal surface area of the hemisphere. However, by considering equilibrium along the axis of symmetry, this force is equivalent to the pressure $P$ acting on the projected circular area of the hemisphere's base, which has an area of $\\pi r^2$.\n$$F_P = P (\\pi r^2)$$\nThis separating force must be balanced by the restraining force generated by the tension within the wall material at the cut. This force, $F_{\\sigma}$, is the product of the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$, and the cross-sectional area of the wall, $A_{wall}$. For a thin-walled sphere ($h \\ll r$), this area can be approximated as the circumference of the cut multiplied by the wall thickness.\n$$A_{wall} \\approx (2\\pi r)h$$\nThus, the total restraining force is:\n$$F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma A_{wall} = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nFor the hemisphere to be in static equilibrium, the separating force must equal the restraining force:\n$$F_P = F_{\\sigma}$$\n$$P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nSolving for the wall stress $\\sigma$ yields the Law of Laplace for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r h} = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$$\nThis expression shows that wall stress is directly proportional to the internal pressure and the chamber radius, and inversely proportional to the wall thickness.\n\nThe second step is to compute the ratio of the wall stress in the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ventricle to that in a normal ventricle. Let the parameters for the DCM and normal ventricles be denoted by the subscripts '$DCM$' and '$Normal$', respectively.\nThe wall stress for the DCM ventricle is:\n$$\\sigma_{DCM} = \\frac{P \\cdot r_{DCM}}{2h_{DCM}}$$\nThe wall stress for the normal ventricle is:\n$$\\sigma_{Normal} = \\frac{P \\cdot r_{Normal}}{2h_{Normal}}$$\nThe problem states that the pressure $P$ is the same for both cases, given as $120\\,\\text{mmHg}$.

The calculated value is $1.925$.

The derived relationship $\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$ is central to understanding cardiac remodeling. Our calculation shows that the wall stress in the specified DCM ventricle is approximately $1.93$ times greater than in the normal ventricle, even at the same internal pressure. This significant increase in wall stress is driven by two geometric changes characteristic of DCM: an increase in radius ($r_{DCM}  r_{Normal}$) and a decrease in relative wall thickness ($h_{DCM}  h_{Normal}$). Elevated wall stress is a key pathological stimulus. It represents an increased mechanical load on each myocyte, which drives maladaptive remodeling processes. Chronically high stress leads to further ventricular dilation, myocyte loss (apoptosis), and fibrosis, creating a vicious cycle that progressively impairs cardiac function and leads to the clinical syndrome of heart failure.
