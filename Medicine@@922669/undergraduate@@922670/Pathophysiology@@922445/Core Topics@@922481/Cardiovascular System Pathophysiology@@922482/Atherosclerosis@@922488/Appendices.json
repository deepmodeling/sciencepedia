The objective is to calculate a specific ratio ($F$) given a clear constraint ($Q_1 = Q_0$) and a defined change in a system parameter ($r_1 = 0.5\\,r_0$). A unique, stable solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for steady, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$ is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure drop along the tube, $\\Delta P$, the fluid's dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, and the tube's geometry. The equation is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the requested dependence of $Q$ on $r$ and $\\Delta P$. The flow rate is directly proportional to the pressure drop, $Q \\propto \\Delta P$, and strongly dependent on the radius, being proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $Q \\propto r^4$.\n\nWe can apply this general relationship to the two specified conditions: the initial (healthy) state and the final (diseased) state.\n\nFor the initial state, denoted by subscript $0$:\n$$\nQ_0 = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nFor the final state, denoted by subscript $1$:\n$$\nQ_1 = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the factor $F = \\Delta P_1 / \\Delta P_0$ that is necessary to maintain the same volumetric flow rate. This imposes the constraint $Q_1 = Q_0$. Therefore, we can set the two expressions for flow equal to each other:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\mu L} = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\frac{\\pi}{8 \\mu L}$ are present on both sides of the equation and can be cancelled. This simplification yields:\n$$\nr_0^4 \\Delta P_0 = r_1^4 \\Delta P_1\n$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $F = \\Delta P_1 / \\Delta P_0$. Rearranging the equation to solve for this ratio gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the plaque narrows the lumen such that the new radius is half the original radius, $r_1 = 0.5\\,r_0$, or $r_1 = \\frac{1}{2}r_0$. Substituting this relationship into our expression for the pressure drop ratio:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\frac{1}{2}r_0}\\right)^4\n$$\n\nSimplifying the term inside the parentheses:\n$$\nF = (2)^4\n$$\n\nCalculating the final numerical value:\n$$\nF = 16\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that to maintain the same blood flow through an artery whose radius has been halved, the pressure drop across the stenotic segment must increase by a factor of $16$.\n\nRegarding the clinical significance: A $16$-fold increase in the pressure gradient required to perfuse a tissue bed is physiologically extreme and generally unsustainable. The circulatory system has limited capacity to increase upstream arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure). Such a dramatic demand for increased pressure to overcome the heightened resistance means that, in practice, the flow rate $Q_1$ will not be maintained equal to $Q_0$. Instead, the flow will decrease substantially. A stenosis of this magnitude ($50\\%$ reduction in radius, which corresponds to a $75\\%$ reduction in cross-sectional area) is considered a \"critical stenosis\" because it significantly compromises blood flow even when the tissue is at rest, leading to a high risk of ischemia (tissue dysfunction or damage due to inadequate blood supply). Under conditions of increased demand (e.g., exercise), the mismatch between supply and demand would be even more severe, likely precipitating symptoms such as angina pectoris if the coronary arteries are affected.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "id": "4329895"}, {"introduction": "While chronic stenosis can cause symptoms, the most catastrophic events, like heart attacks, are often caused by the abrupt rupture of a vulnerable plaque.
