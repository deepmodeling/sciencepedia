The stressed volume is the volume that exerts pressure on the walls of the vasculature. Therefore, the change in stressed volume, $\\Delta V_{stressed}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{stressed} = f \\times V_{total, venous} = 0.10 \\times 3000 \\text{ mL} = 300 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThe problem defines venous compliance, $C_v$, as the ratio of the change in volume to the change in pressure, $C_v = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$. It is specified that for the systemic circulation, this change in volume corresponds to the change in stressed volume, and the change in pressure is the change in mean systemic filling pressure, $\\Delta P_{msf}$.

The modeling of the left ventricle as a thin-walled sphere and the application of mechanical equilibrium to derive wall stress (a form of the Law of Laplace) is a standard and valid simplification in cardiac physiology. The scenario described—an increase in afterload (pressure) due to neurohormonal activation in heart failure, and the concept of a compensatory change in wall thickness to normalize stress—is clinically relevant. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive the required formula and compute the requested factor. The language is objective and the parameters are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the wall stress formula.\n\nWe model the left ventricle as a thin-walled sphere of internal radius $r$ and uniform wall thickness $h$. The internal pressure is $P$, and the resulting circumferential stress in the wall is $T$. To find the relationship between these quantities, we apply the principle of mechanical equilibrium.\n\nConsider the sphere to be cut into two hemispheres. The force exerted by the internal pressure tends to push the two hemispheres apart. This force, $F_{\\text{pressure}}$, is equal to the pressure $P$ multiplied by the projected area of the hemisphere onto the plane of the cut. The projected area is a circle of radius $r$.\n$$ F_{\\text{pressure}} = P \\times (\\pi r^2) $$\n\nThis outward force is counteracted by the tensile force within the wall material at the cut. This force, $F_{\\text{wall}}$, is the product of the circumferential stress $T$ and the cross-sectional area of the wall at the cut, $A_{\\text{wall}}$.\nUnder the thin-wall approximation ($h \\ll r$), the cross-sectional area of the wall can be approximated as the circumference of the sphere multiplied by the wall thickness.\n$$ A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx (2 \\pi r) h $$\nThe total tensile force holding the hemispheres together is:\n$$ F_{\\text{wall}} = T \\times A_{\\text{wall}} = T (2 \\pi r h) $$\n\nFor the chamber to be in mechanical equilibrium, the outward force due to pressure must be balanced by the inward tensile force in the wall.\n$$ F_{\\text{pressure}} = F_{\\text{wall}} $$\n$$ P \\pi r^2 = T (2 \\pi r h) $$\n\nWe can now solve for the circumferential wall stress $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r h} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{Pr}{2h} $$\nThis is the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled sphere, which relates wall stress $T$ to the internal pressure $P$, internal radius $r$, and wall thickness $h$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the required change in wall thickness.\n\nLet the initial, baseline state of the ventricle be denoted by the subscript $0$. The wall stress is $T_0$, the systolic pressure is $P_0$, the radius is $r_0$, and the wall thickness is $h_0$. According to the derived formula:\n$$ T_0 = \\frac{P_0 r_0}{2 h_0} $$\n\nThe patient experiences an increase in afterload. Let the new state be denoted by the subscript $1$. We are given the following conditions:\n1. The systolic pressure increases by a fraction of $0.30$ relative to baseline.\n   $$ P_1 = P_0 + 0.30 P_0 = (1 + 0.30) P_0 = 1.30 P_0 $$\n2.
