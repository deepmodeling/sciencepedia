These are standard and well-established engineering principles routinely applied in biomechanics to model arteries and aneurysms. The provided physiological values ($P \\approx 97.5\\,\\text{mmHg}$, radii in the cm range, wall thickness in the mm range) are clinically realistic for thoracic aortic aneurysms.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a qualitative explanation supported by a quantitative comparison based on the provided data and principles.

The analysis may proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION AND SOLUTION\n\nThe central task is to compare the maximum wall stress in the fusiform aneurysm model with the maximum wall stress in the saccular aneurysm model. Rupture is assumed to occur when the local stress exceeds a critical failure threshold. The aneurysm geometry that produces a higher wall stress under the given conditions is at a greater risk of rupture.\n\n**1. Stress in the Fusiform Aneurysm (Cylindrical Model)**\n\nFor a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an internal pressure $P$, the circumferential stress, also known as hoop stress ($\\sigma_f$), is given by the formula:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{P R_f}{h_f} $$\nSubstituting the given values, ensuring consistent units (e.g., meters and Pascals):\n- $P = 13\\,\\text{kPa} = 13 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Pa}$\n- $R_f = 2.5\\,\\text{cm} = 0.025\\,\\text{m}$\n- $h_f = 0.3\\,\\text{cm} = 0.003\\,\\text{m}$\n\nThe stress is calculated as:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{(13 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Pa}) \\times (0.025\\,\\text{m})}{0.003\\,\\text{m}} = \\frac{325\\,\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.003\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 108333\\,\\text{Pa} = 108.3\\,\\text{kPa} $$\n\n**2. Stress in the Saccular Aneurysm (Hemispherical Model)**\n\nFor a thin-walled sphere (or hemisphere) subjected to an internal pressure $P$, the membrane stress ($\\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}}$) is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} = \\frac{P R_s}{2 h_s} $$\nThis represents the nominal stress in the dome of the saccular aneurysm, away from the geometric discontinuity at the neck.\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $P = 13 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Pa}$\n- $R_s = 1.5\\,\\text{cm} = 0.015\\,\\text{m}$\n- $h_s = 0.15\\,\\text{cm} = 0.0015\\,\\text{m}$\n\nThe nominal dome stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} = \\frac{(13 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Pa}) \\times (0.015\\,\\text{m})}{2 \\times (0.0015\\,\\text{m})} = \\frac{195\\,\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.003\\,\\text{m}} = 65000\\,\\text{Pa} = 65.0\\,\\text{kPa} $$\n\nHowever, the problem specifies a geometric discontinuity at the neck, which creates a stress concentration. The peak local stress, $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}}$, is found by multiplying the nominal stress by the stress concentration factor, $K_t$.\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = K_t \\times \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} $$\nUsing the given $K_t = 2.2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = 2.2 \\times 65.0\\,\\text{kPa} = 143.0\\,\\text{kPa} $$\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nComparing the maximum stress in each configuration:\n- Maximum stress in fusiform aneurysm: $\\sigma_f = 108.3\\,\\text{kPa}$.\n- Maximum stress in saccular aneurysm: $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = 143.0\\,\\text{kPa}$.\n\nThe analysis shows that $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} > \\sigma_f$. Despite the saccular aneurysm having a smaller radius ($R_s < R_f$), the combination of its relatively thinner wall (the ratio $R_s/h_s = 10$ is greater than $R_f/h_f \\approx 8.33$) and the significant stress concentration at its neck leads to a higher peak stress. Therefore, under these conditions, the saccular aneurysm is at a higher risk of rupture, which explains why rupture can occur at smaller-diameter saccular aneurysms compared to fusiform ones.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Using thin-walled vessel mechanics, the nominal dome stress in a saccular aneurysm scales as $P R_s / (2 h_s)$, and the local stress near the neck is amplified by $K_t$. Because $h_s$ is smaller and $K_t > 1$, the local circumferential stress can exceed the fusiform hoop stress $P R_f / h_f$ despite $R_s < R_f$, making rupture at smaller diameter plausible.**\n- This statement correctly provides the formulae for stress in a sphere ($P R_s / (2 h_s)$) and a cylinder ($P R_f / h_f$).\n- It correctly identifies the role of the stress concentration factor $K_t$ in amplifying the local stress.\n- It provides a sound and complete physical explanation for why the peak stress in the saccular aneurysm can be higher, despite its smaller radius.\n- The conclusion is fully supported by the\nderivation above ($\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} \\approx 143\\,\\text{kPa} > \\sigma_f \\approx 108\\,\\text{kPa}$).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because spherical shapes distribute stress more evenly, the saccular dome necessarily has lower wall stress than a fusiform aneurysm at the same pressure, so rupture requires larger diameters.**\n- While a sphere has lower stress than a cylinder for the *same* $P$, $R$, and $h$, this option incorrectly generalizes this to \"necessarily has lower wall stress\" without considering that $R$ and $h$ are different in the problem.\n- Most critically, it completely ignores the stress concentration at the neck, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem setup and is the location of the peak stress. The conclusion that rupture requires larger diameters is contrary to the result of a complete analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Blood pressure within a saccular pouch is higher than in the parent aorta due to flow stagnation, explaining rupture at smaller size independent of wall properties.**\n- The premise regarding fluid dynamics is flawed in its significance. While stagnation pressure exists (Bernoulli's principle), the increase in pressure due to flow stagnation in the aorta is minuscule compared to the mean arterial pressure. The dynamic pressure, $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$, is on the order of $0.5\\,\\text{kPa}$, while the transmural pressure $P$ is $13\\,\\text{kPa}$. This effect is not the primary driver.\n- The claim that this explains rupture \"independent of wall properties\" is fundamentally incorrect. Rupture is a mechanical failure of the wall, which is intrinsically dependent on wall properties like thickness and material strength, which determine the resulting stress.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Wall calcification increases stiffness, which raises wall stress at a given pressure, explaining earlier rupture of saccular aneurysms.**\n- This statement confuses material stiffness (Young's modulus) with stress. For a given pressure and geometry, the equilibrium stress in a thin-walled elastic structure is determined by the balance of forces, not the material's stiffness. The formulae $\\sigma = PR/h$ and $\\sigma = PR/(2h)$ do not contain the elastic modulus.\n- Increased stiffness means the material will deform less (lower strain) for a given stress. While calcification can make the wall more brittle (reducing its failure strain or toughness) and thus increase rupture risk, it does not \"raise wall stress\".\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The presence of a narrow neck reduces transmission of pressure to the dome, protecting the saccular aneurysm against rupture at small size.**\n- This statement violates Pascal's principle. In a fluid at rest or in slow-moving flow, pressure is transmitted nearly undiminished throughout the fluid. The full transmural pressure $P$ acts on the internal surface of the aneurysm dome.\n- Furthermore, the narrow neck and sharp transition are a source of stress concentration, which *increases* stress and rupture risk, the exact opposite of the \"protective\" effect claimed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4763932"}, {"introduction": "Clinical management of aortic aneurysms relies on vigilant surveillance to detect growth and determine the optimal time for intervention.

It is scientifically grounded in a simplified biomechanical model of aortic aneurysm expansion, is mathematically and logically well-posed, and contains all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to classify aortic aneurysm expansion as eccentric or not, based on time-series data of aneurysm volume and diameter. The classification relies on comparing the observed rate of volume change with a predicted rate of volume change derived from a simple geometric model.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on three components: the geometric model, the method for estimating growth rates, and the classification rule.\n\nFirst, the aneurysm is approximated as a right circular cylinder of length $L$ and diameter $D$. The volume $V$ is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{\\pi}{4} L D^2$$\nFor a series of diameter measurements $D_i$ taken at times $t_i$, we can compute a corresponding series of model-predicted volumes, $V_i^{\\mathrm{pred}}$, assuming the length $L$ is constant:\n$$V_i^{\\mathrm{pred}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} L D_i^2$$\n\nSecond, the linear growth rate of any time-varying quantity $y$ (in this case, $V$ or $V^{\\mathrm{pred}}$) is estimated using the slope of a least-squares regression line fitted to the data points $\\{(t_i, y_i)\\}$.

The model-predicted volume growth rate, $\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}$, calculated from the data $\\{(t_i, V_i^{\\mathrm{pred}})\\}$.\n\nThird, the classification of expansion as eccentric is performed using a two-part logical rule based on these two growth rates. An expansion is flagged as eccentric if there is a significant discrepancy between the measured and predicted growth. This discrepancy is quantified in two ways.\n\nThe primary measure is the Eccentric Expansion Index, $E$, defined as the ratio of the two growth rates:\n$$E = \\frac{\\hat{m}_V}{\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}}$$\nAn index $E \\geq 1.15$ indicates that the measured volume is growing at least $15\\%$ faster than predicted by the change in diameter alone, suggesting eccentric expansion.\n\nA special case handles scenarios where the model predicts negligible or no growth. If the predicted growth rate $\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}$ is negligible, the index $E$ is ill-defined or numerically unstable. In this situation, eccentricity is determined by comparing the measured growth rate $\\hat{m}_V$ to a noise floor. The problem defines a tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-9} \\; \\text{mm}^3/\\text{month}$ to identify negligible predicted growth and a noise floor $\\delta_V = 500 \\; \\text{mm}^3/\\text{month}$ for significant measured growth.\n\nThe complete classification rule is as follows: an expansion is classified as eccentric if either of the following conditions is met:\n1.  The predicted growth rate is sufficiently large to allow for a stable calculation of $E$, and $E \\geq 1.15$.\n2.  The predicted growth rate is negligible ($\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}} < \\epsilon$) while the measured volume growth is significant ($\\hat{m}_V \\geq \\delta_V$).\n\nTo implement this logic robustly and avoid division by zero when $\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}$ is near zero, the conditions can be combined into a single logical expression. The classification for each case will be `True` (eccentric) if the following expression evaluates to true, and `False` (not eccentric) otherwise:\n$$ (\\text{abs}(\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}) \\geq \\epsilon \\quad \\text{AND} \\quad \\frac{\\hat{m}_V}{\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}}} \\geq 1.15) \\quad \\text{OR} \\quad (\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}} < \\epsilon \\quad \\text{AND} \\quad \\hat{m}_V \\geq \\delta_V) $$\nThis logic will be applied to each of the four test cases provided.\n\nLet's trace Case $3$ as an example:\n- Given data: $t = \\{0, 12, 24\\}$, $D = \\{50, 50, 50\\}$, $L = 100$, and $V = \\{196349.54..., 214349.54..., 232349.54...\\}$.\n- The diameter $D_i$ is constant, so the predicted volume $V_i^{\\mathrm{pred}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (100)(50)^2$ is also constant.\n- For a dataset with constant $y$-values, the least-squares slope is exactly $0$. Thus, $\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}} = 0 \\; \\text{mm}^3/\\text{month}$.\n- The measured volumes $V_i$ are linearly increasing. Calculation yields $\\hat{m}_V = 1500 \\; \\text{mm}^3/\\text{month}$.\n- Now we apply the rule with $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}$ and $\\delta_V = 500$.\n- The first part of the logical OR is `False` because `abs(0) >= epsilon` is false.\n- The second part is evaluated: $(\\hat{m}_{V,\\mathrm{pred}} < \\epsilon)$ is $(0 < 10^{-9})$, which is `True`. And $(\\hat{m}_V \\geq \\delta_V)$ is $(1500 \\geq 500)$, which is also `True`. The conjunction is `True`.\n- The final result of `False OR True` is `True`. Case $3$ is classified as eccentric expansion.\n\nThe final program will systematically apply this validated algorithm to all test cases.", "answer": "[False,True,True,False]", "id": "4763969"}]}
