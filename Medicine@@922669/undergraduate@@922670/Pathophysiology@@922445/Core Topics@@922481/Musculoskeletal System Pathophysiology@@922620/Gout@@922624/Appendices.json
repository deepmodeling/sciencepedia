The core concept to be used, the temperature dependence of solubility, is a fundamental principle of physical chemistry.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear scenario with specific, physiologically relevant values for temperature and urate concentration. It asks a well-defined qualitative question that can be answered using the specified scientific principles.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is precise and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The data provided are sufficient to answer the qualitative question. The serum urate concentration of $6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is known to be the approximate saturation point of monosodium urate in physiologic saline at $37\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, which makes the problem setup internally consistent and clinically relevant. No contradictions are present.\n5.  **Realism:** The temperatures and urate concentration are within realistic physiological and pathophysiological ranges. Peripheral joints are known to be cooler than the core body, and this temperature difference is a key factor in the predilection of gout for these joints.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on realistic physiological parameters. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe formation of crystals from a solution is governed by the principles of chemical equilibrium and solubility. The dissolution of a solid, such as monosodium urate (MSU), in a solvent, such as the synovial fluid (approximated as an aqueous solution), is an equilibrium process:\n$$ \\text{MSU(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Na}^+ (\\text{aq}) + \\text{Urate}^- (\\text{aq}) $$\nThe solubility, $S$, is the maximum concentration of the solute that can remain dissolved in the solvent at a given temperature and pressure. When the concentration of the solute exceeds the solubility, the solution is termed supersaturated, and the excess solute will tend to precipitate out as a solid (i.e., form crystals) to re-establish equilibrium.\n\nThe effect of temperature on solubility is determined by the enthalpy of solution ($\\Delta H_{soln}$). This relationship is described by Le Chatelier's principle and more quantitatively by the van 't Hoff equation. For the dissolution of most solids in liquids, the process is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings ($\\Delta H_{soln} > 0$).\n$$ \\text{MSU(s)} + \\text{heat} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{MSU(aq)} $$\nBased on Le Chatelier's principle, if we decrease the temperature (remove heat) of a saturated system at equilibrium, the equilibrium will shift to the left to counteract the change—that is, it will favor the exothermic process, which is crystallization. This shift results in a decrease in the concentration of the dissolved species, meaning the solubility, $S$, decreases at lower temperatures.\n\nIn this problem:\n1.  The patient's serum, at a core body temperature of $T_1 = 37\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, has a urate concentration of $C = 6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n2.  The solubility of MSU at $37\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ is known to be approximately $S_1 \\approx 6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Thus, the patient's serum is saturated with urate.\n3.  The synovial fluid in the first metatarsophalangeal joint cools to a temperature $T_2 = 33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.\n4.  Because the dissolution of MSU is endothermic, a decrease in temperature from $T_1$ to $T_2$ will cause a decrease in its solubility. Therefore, the new solubility at $33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, let's call it $S_2$, will be less than the solubility at $37\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ ($S_2 < S_1$).\n5.  This means $S_2 < 6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n6.  The synovial fluid entering the joint still has a urate concentration of $C = 6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Since this concentration is now greater than the local solubility limit ($C > S_2$), the fluid in the joint is supersaturated.\n7.  A supersaturated solution is thermodynamically unstable and provides the driving force for precipitation. The excess urate will crystallize out as solid MSU.\n\nConclusion: The likelihood of MSU crystal formation is significantly higher at the lower temperature of $33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ because the decrease in temperature reduces the solubility of MSU, causing the fluid to become supersaturated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, crystallization is more likely because solubility of monosodium urate decreases as temperature falls, so $6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ becomes supersaturating.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement correctly concludes that crystallization is more likely at the lower temperature. It provides the correct physical-chemical reason: solubility decreases as temperature falls. It then correctly deduces the consequence: the given concentration of $6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ exceeds the new, lower solubility limit, thus becoming a supersaturating concentration. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. At $33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, crystallization is less likely because cooling increases solubility by favoring dissolution.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect. Cooling an endothermic dissolution process does not increase solubility; it decreases it. The claim that cooling favors dissolution directly contradicts Le Chatelier's principle for this system. Therefore, the premise and the conclusion are both flawed.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The likelihood of crystallization is unchanged because $6.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is a temperature-independent saturation threshold.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The solubility of virtually all solids, including monosodium urate, is dependent on temperature. The problem itself instructs the use of \"temperature dependence of solubility\". Claiming the saturation threshold is temperature-independent is a violation of basic chemical principles.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. At $33\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, crystallization is more likely, but only because cooling acutely increases uric acid production; solubility changes are not relevant.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement correctly concludes that crystallization is more likely, but the reasoning provided is incorrect. Local cooling of a joint does not cause an acute increase in the systemic or local *production* of uric acid. The primary local effect of temperature is on the *solubility* of the already-present urate. The statement's dismissal of solubility changes as \"not relevant\" is a major scientific error, as this is the principal mechanism.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4787440"}, {"introduction": "While local temperature explains the common sites of gout, the root cause is systemically high levels of uric acid, or hyperuricemia.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in clinical medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, and compute its value.\n\nThe renal clearance of any substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is defined as the rate of its excretion in urine divided by its concentration in plasma. The excretion rate is the product of the urine concentration of the substance, $U_x$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$\nC_x = \\frac{U_x \\cdot V}{P_x}\n$$\nwhere $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of substance $x$.\n\nApplying this definition to urate, its clearance, $C_{\\text{urate}}$, is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the clearance of creatinine, $C_{\\text{Cr}}$, which is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, as the ratio of urate clearance to creatinine clearance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{urate}}}{C_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for $C_{\\text{urate}}$ and $C_{\\text{Cr}}$ into the equation for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, is present in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be canceled. This is a critical feature, as it permits the calculation of fractional excretion from spot urine and plasma samples without requiring a timed urine collection to measure $V$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}}}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\text{Cr}}}{U_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the fractional excretion of urate in terms of the four given concentration measurements.\n\n### Computation\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ using the provided data:\n- $U_{\\text{urate}} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{urate}} = 8 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $U_{\\text{Cr}} = 100 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{Cr}} = 1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40 \\text{ mg/dL}}{8 \\text{ mg/dL}} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ mg/dL}}{100 \\text{ mg/dL}}\n$$\nThe units ($\\text{mg/dL}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a fractional ratio.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 0.05\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.05$. To represent this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.05000$.\n\n### Clinical Interpretation\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of gout pathophysiology. Hyperuricemia (elevated $P_{\\text{urate}}$) can result from two primary mechanisms: overproduction of urate or renal underexcretion of urate. The fractional excretion of urate helps differentiate these causes. The normal range for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ is typically cited as $6\\%$ to $10\\%$ (or $0.06$ to $0.10$). In a patient with hyperuricemia, an $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ below a certain threshold (commonly $< 6\\%$ or $0.06$) is considered evidence of renal underexcretion as the predominant cause. The kidney is failing to excrete an adequate fraction of the filtered urate load, leading to its accumulation in the plasma.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = 0.05$, which corresponds to $5\\%$. Since $5\\% < 6\\%$, this result indicates that the patient is an \"underexcretor\" of urate. This finding is significant as underexcretion is the underlying cause of primary gout in approximately $90\\%$ of patients and can guide therapeutic choices, for instance, towards uricosuric agents which increase renal urate excretion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05000}\n$$", "id": "4840641"}, {"introduction": "We have seen how temperature affects where crystals might form and how renal function determines the overall risk.

For our purpose, it is more convenient to use the form derived by rearranging the equation before multiplying by $-1$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) = -pK_a + pH = pH - pK_a$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ gives the final expression for the ratio:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate this ratio for the two given $pH$ conditions, using $pK_a \\approx 5.4$.\n\n**Case 1: At rest, $pH \\approx 7.4$**\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(7.4 - 5.4)} = 10^2 = 100$$\nThe fraction of urate present as the conjugate base, $f_{A^-}$, is given by:\n$$f_{A^-} = \\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$f_{A^-} = \\dfrac{\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 100} = \\dfrac{100}{101}$$\n$$f_{A^-} \\approx 0.990099$$\nThis means approximately $99.0\\%$ of the total urate is in the ionized form, $A^-$.\n\n**Case 2: During inflammation, $pH \\approx 6.8$**\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(6.8 - 5.4)} = 10^{1.4}$$\nTo approximate $10^{1.4}$:\n$$10^{1.4} = 10^1 \\times 10^{0.4}$$\nSince $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.301$ and $\\log_{10}(3) \\approx 0.477$, $10^{0.4}$ is a value between $2$ and $3$.

Our calculations show that a decrease in $pH$ from $7.4$ to $6.8$ (acidification) causes the fraction of urate in the more soluble ionized form to decrease from $\\approx 99\\%$ to $\\approx 96\\%$. Concurrently, the fraction in the less soluble neutral form ($HA$) increases from $\\approx 1\\%$ (since $1/101 \\approx 0.01$) to $\\approx 4\\%$ (since $1/26 \\approx 0.038$). This four-fold increase in the concentration of the less soluble species, $[HA]$, for a fixed total urate pool $C_T$, reduces the overall capacity of the synovial fluid to keep urate dissolved.

A ratio of $\\approx 1$ would occur if $pH \\approx pK_a$, which is not the case here ($pH=7.4$ vs $pK_a=5.4$).\n- The numerical values are grossly inconsistent with the derivation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only option A provides the correct numerical results and the correct physiological interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4787426"}]}
