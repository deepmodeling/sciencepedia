As an X-linked recessive disorder, its pattern of inheritance has profound implications for families and genetic counseling. This first practice problem challenges you to apply the principles of Mendelian genetics to a realistic scenario, calculating the risk for an individual based on their family history. Mastering this type of analysis is a fundamental skill for grasping the prevalence and transmission of single-gene disorders. [@problem_id:1521079]", "problem": "A genetic counselor is meeting with a woman who is concerned about the risk of having a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a well-documented X-linked recessive disorder. The woman provides her family history: her brother has DMD, but she and both of her parents are phenotypically unaffected by the disorder. The woman's partner is also unaffected and has no family history of DMD. Assuming there are no new mutations occurring in the germline, calculate the probability that the woman's first son will have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\n\nExpress your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let $X^D$ represent the dominant allele for the normal phenotype and $X^d$ represent the recessive allele that causes Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Since DMD is an X-linked disorder, we must consider the X and Y chromosomes.\n\nThe genotypes for unaffected males and females are $X^D Y$ and $X^D X^D$ or $X^D X^d$ (carrier), respectively. The genotype for an affected male is $X^d Y$. An affected female would have the genotype $X^d X^d$, which is extremely rare and often not viable, but more importantly, all females in this problem are described as unaffected.\n\nThe problem can be solved in two main steps:\n1. Determine the probability that the woman is a carrier of the DMD allele.\n2. If she is a carrier, determine the probability of her passing that allele to her son.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the probability that the woman is a carrier.**\n\nWe first establish the genotypes of the woman's parents.\n- Her father is unaffected, so his genotype must be $X^D Y$.\n- Her mother is unaffected, but they have an affected son (the woman's brother). An affected son has the genotype $X^d Y$. He must have inherited the Y chromosome from his father and the $X^d$ chromosome from his mother.\n- Therefore, the mother must possess the $X^d$ allele. Since she is unaffected, she must be a carrier, and her genotype is $X^D X^d$.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible genotypes for the woman in question. She is the daughter of a father with genotype $X^D Y$ and a mother with genotype $X^D X^d$. We can set up a Punnett square for their offspring:\n\n| | Mother $X^D$ | Mother $X^d$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Father $X^D$** | $X^D X^D$ | $X^D X^d$ |\n| **Father Y** | $X^D Y$ | $X^d Y$ |\n\nThe possible offspring are:\n- $X^D X^D$: Unaffected daughter\n- $X^D X^d$: Unaffected carrier daughter\n- $X^D Y$: Unaffected son\n- $X^d Y$: Affected son (this is her brother)\n\nThe woman is an unaffected daughter. Looking at the possible outcomes for daughters, there are two possibilities: $X^D X^D$ and $X^D X^d$. Each has an equal chance of occurring.\n- Probability of being $X^D X^D$ (non-carrier) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of being $X^D X^d$ (carrier) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the probability that the woman is a carrier, let's call this event $C$, is $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of her son being affected.**\n\nWe want to find the probability that her first son is affected, let's call this event $A$. This probability is conditional on the woman's genotype. We can use the law of total probability:\n$P(A) = P(A | C) \\cdot P(C) + P(A | \\text{not } C) \\cdot P(\\text{not } C)$\n\n- $P(A | C)$ is the probability the son is affected, given the woman is a carrier ($X^D X^d$). If she is a carrier, she will pass one of her two X chromosomes to her son. There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance she passes on $X^D$ (resulting in an unaffected son) and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance she passes on $X^d$ (resulting in an affected son). Thus, $P(A | C) = \\frac{1}{2}$. (The son inherits a Y chromosome from his father, whose genotype does not affect this outcome).\n\n- $P(A | \\text{not } C)$ is the probability the son is affected, given the woman is not a carrier. If she is not a carrier, her genotype is $X^D X^D$. She can only pass on the $X^D$ allele to her son. Therefore, the probability of her son being affected is 0. Thus, $P(A | \\text{not } C) = 0$.\n\n- We already found $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{not } C) = 1 - P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n$$P(A) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (0) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$P(A) = \\frac{1}{4} + 0$$\n$$P(A) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTherefore, the total probability that her first son will have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1521079"}, {"introduction": "Moving from inheritance patterns to the molecular level, the severity of muscular dystrophy often depends on how a mutation affects the protein's reading frame. This exercise explores the molecular logic behind therapeutic exon skipping, a promising strategy for DMD that aims to convert a severe out-of-frame mutation into a milder in-frame one. By working through the provided hypothetical data, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the 'reading frame rule' and the sophisticated basis of modern genetic therapies. [@problem_id:4359997]", "problem": "A single-gene disorder of muscle fibers arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene, producing either Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Use the following fundamental bases: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to messenger ribonucleic acid to protein), the triplet nature of the genetic code (codons of $3$ nucleotides), and the rule that reading frame at an exon-exon junction depends on the splice site \"phase\": the number of nucleotides within a codon at the splice boundary. For a splice between an upstream exon with $3'$ donor phase $a$ and a downstream exon with $5'$ acceptor phase $b$, the reading frame is preserved if and only if $a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nConsider a patient with a genomic deletion spanning dystrophin gene exons $48$-$50$. This deletion causes messenger ribonucleic acid splicing to join exon $47$ directly to exon $51$. Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is proposed to skip exon $51$, instead joining exon $47$ directly to exon $52$. You are given the following splice site phases for this dystrophin gene region:\n- Exon $47$ $3'$ donor phase: $2$.\n- Exon $51$ $5'$ acceptor phase: $2$.\n- Exon $52$ $5'$ acceptor phase: $1$.\n\nAdditionally, consider the domain architecture of full-length dystrophin $427$ kilodalton isoform (Dp427). Dp427 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central rod domain composed of $24$ spectrin-like repeats and interspersed hinges, a cysteine-rich domain, and a C-terminal domain. For the purposes of this problem, assume that exons $48$-$51$ collectively encode spectrin-like repeats $18$ and $19$ and the third hinge (H3) within the central rod domain.\n\nDefine an indicator variable $I$ that equals $1$ if exon $51$ skipping restores the reading frame for the deletion spanning exons $48$-$50$, and equals $0$ otherwise. Define $f$ as the fraction of spectrin-like repeats retained in the central rod domain after removal of exons $48$-$51$, relative to the $24$ repeats of full-length Dp427. Compute the product $M = I \\times f$ and express it as a unitless decimal, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a product $M = I \\times f$, where $I$ is an indicator variable for the restoration of the genetic reading frame by a therapeutic intervention, and $f$ is the fraction of retained structural repeats in the resulting protein. The context is a patient with a specific deletion in the dystrophin gene.\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of the indicator variable, $I$. This variable is defined to be $1$ if the therapeutic skipping of exon $51$ restores the reading frame that was disrupted by the initial deletion of exons $48$-$50$, and $0$ otherwise. The rule for preserving the reading frame across a splice junction is that the sum of the $3'$ donor phase of the upstream exon ($a$) and the $5'$ acceptor phase of the downstream exon ($b$) must be a multiple of $3$. This can be expressed as the congruence relation $a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nLet us analyze the initial state of the patient, who has a genomic deletion spanning exons $48$ through $50$. This deletion results in the splicing of exon $47$ directly to exon $51$.\nFor this splice junction:\n- The upstream exon is exon $47$, which has a $3'$ donor phase given as $a = 2$.\n- The downstream exon is exon $51$, which has a $5'$ acceptor phase given as $b = 2$.\n\nWe compute the sum of these phases:\n$a + b = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nTo check if the reading frame is preserved, we evaluate this sum modulo $3$:\n$4 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 1$.\nSince $1 \\not\\equiv 0$, the reading frame is disrupted. This is a frameshift mutation, which typically leads to a premature stop codon and a truncated, non-functional protein, characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the proposed therapeutic intervention: antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon $51$. In this scenario, with the original deletion of exons $48$-$50$ still present, skipping exon $51$ causes exon $47$ to be spliced directly to exon $52$.\nFor this new therapeutic splice junction:\n- The upstream exon remains exon $47$, with its $3'$ donor phase $a = 2$.\n- The new downstream exon is exon $52$, which has a $5'$ acceptor phase given as $b = 1$.\n\nWe compute the sum of these new phases:\n$a + b = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nWe evaluate this sum modulo $3$:\n$3 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0$.\nSince the sum is congruent to $0 \\pmod{3}$, the reading frame is preserved. This therapeutic intervention converts a frameshift mutation into an in-frame deletion, allowing for the production of a shorter but potentially partially functional protein, which is characteristic of the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) phenotype.\n\nThe indicator variable $I$ is $1$ if the therapy restores the reading frame. Our analysis shows the initial state has a disrupted frame ($a+b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$) and the therapeutic state has a preserved frame ($a+b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$). Therefore, the therapy does restore the reading frame.\nThus, $I = 1$.\n\nSecond, we must calculate the variable $f$. This is a unitless fraction representing the portion of spectrin-like repeats retained in the central rod domain of the dystrophin protein after the total removal of exons $48$ through $51$.\nThe full-length dystrophin protein (Dp427) contains a total of $N_{total} = 24$ spectrin-like repeats.\nThe problem states that exons $48$-$51$ collectively encode for spectrin-like repeats $18$ and $19$. This means the number of repeats removed, $N_{removed}$, is $2$.\nThe number of spectrin-like repeats retained in the modified protein is:\n$N_{retained} = N_{total} - N_{removed} = 24 - 2 = 22$.\n\nThe fraction $f$ of retained repeats is the ratio of the number of retained repeats to the total number of repeats in the full-length protein:\n$$f = \\frac{N_{retained}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{22}{24}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified to:\n$$f = \\frac{11}{12}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the product $M = I \\times f$:\n$$M = 1 \\times \\frac{11}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$M = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\nRounding this to four significant figures, we look at the fifth significant figure. The first four are $9$, $1$, $6$, and $6$.
